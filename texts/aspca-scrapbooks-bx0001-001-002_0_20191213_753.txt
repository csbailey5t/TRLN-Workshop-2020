Receiving. a'mysteriens: intimation that an all:
:iair of some importance.:in sporting circles was about1
so come off, yesterday afternoon, at an out-of-the-‘
may place in the outskirts of, Hoboken, we started in 1
that direction, with the design of laying beforeour
readers a full account -.of .the occurrences which
1,;might- take place. II 1
,It-was said that. careful,,and secret preparations1
Thad been made for the ipurpose of getting upan ex— 1
jisraordinary exhibition sci cock ﬁghting, a great 1
1“ main ” having been .made for the occasion, Which 1
1 wouldcall out a full representation of the “ fanny ” 1
as wellas the - “ roughs“ of New-York. Not having
.a fancy for roughing item‘selves, we felt somewhat 1
anxious to conceal our purposes in “ mixing in“1
' with such an affair; but owing to the latenessof the 1
.hourat which our information was received, we were ‘
obliged to set out in our usual costume, trusting to
the universal adaptability of a newspaper man tori
1 the means of getting extricated from any difﬁculties 1
1 which might arise in the course of our investigations. 1
Crossing the Barclay—street ferry, we entered theI
“horse car for “ Union Hill and Weehawken,” to-
gether with-about a dozen good-humored gentlemen, '
whose. general appearance wasvsuggestive of gin-
aaocktails and brandy-smashes, and after a
xi is of . about three miles and a” half, dur-
ing which we strove to cultivate" an inti-
mate acquaintance. with our fellow-travelers, and

1 become possessed. of some items of information re-
specting the object of our journey, we arrived at
1 two big lager-beer breweries and a collection of'
houses, known as “ Union Hill.” Following in the
wake of our companions, we (presently appeared in I

 

 

 

the bar-room of MITCHELL’S Hotel, where twenty-ﬁve 1 ,

or thirty men were engaged in smoking, drinking '1
and talking. It was quite evident that there was no .
particular desire to keep the aﬂair secret, and, in
fact, we soon learned that in that part of the world“
cool; ﬁghting is regarded as an innocent and divert-‘77
ing pastime, Combining pleasure with proﬁt, patron- ;
ized occasionally by the guardians of the public1

peace, and deserving of encouragement by every one
inter-ceded in the improvement of Shanghais and1
Cochin Chinas. ' 1

THE ’ COCK-PIT 1
was discovered in a rickety frame building in the1
rear of_, the hotel, and consisted of a circular area1
about twelve feet in diameter, surrounded by a low1

railing and covered with a rag carpet, upon which1

6 were chalked in the centre of the ring, two lines I1

11 about two feet apart, where the cooks were to be set 1

up. An arrangement of seats of a primitive descrips ‘,
non environed the inclosure. One corner of the 1
room was occupied by a. red-hot stove, and another!“
by a decrepit individual w1th a. withered hand ands

club foot, seated before a table improvised out of a1
couple of boards and spread with a “ sweat-cloth” on1

a. which he invited the bystanders to engage in!

I Tl what he called his Flittle guess game. "

P'

m i
;, At about 3 o’clock P. M. the votaries of the cock-1
pit began to enter the room, each paying the triﬂing1

‘On Tuesday last a ‘7 cock main came 00‘ at New
Jersey between fowls owned by Mulholland of New
York and Bray of-Albany, which proved to be one of

the most interesting and exciting mains of the entire

season. The main was for a purse of $500 and $50 on
each ﬁght. each party to show ﬁfteen cocks between four
pounds four ounces and ﬁve pounds eight ounces in
weight. At the time and place agreed upon a large
crowd was on hand; but as the people who dwell in this
vicinity are somewhat Puritanical regarding such sports
as cock ﬁghting the assemblage was as quiet and orderly
‘ as if it Were merely a society meeting, and even Captain
Todd’s exceedingly vigilant corps would have been puz-
I'zled to ascertain the true. cause of the gathering. The
birds presented were all noble specimens, and each one
seemed to understandjust. what was expected of it, so
cleverly had they been trained and planned. The ‘ sport
commenced about nine o’clock P, M., and from the
time the ﬁrst pair were pitted until the crow of the
ﬁnal victor the interest in the match never ﬂagged.
There were nine battles in all, and out of these the New
Yorker’s birds won ﬁve, thus securing for their trainer
and owner the purse of the main and the title of cham-
pion. A large amount of money changed hands on the
. occasion; but so nearly equal did the birds appear be-
fore t' a ﬁght that the odds offered on either side were
» very small. This was the wind up of the season, which
' has-been comparatively lively; but some of the defeated
:- parties may scare up a few birds with which to attempt
l to take the laurels from New York; in that event there
V can be no doubt that .Mulholland will manage to meet

Chicago is a. sportive city. Its inhabitants, whetheri
. two or four—legged, take naturally to the ring or the pit?
Consequently, when a love for the “manly art” is arous4
ed, by such scenes as the above, its votaries rest not un-
til ether and more extensive exhibitions are Inaded
Scarcely had the “fancy” rccltvered from the above bi—i
pedal emeuz‘e, than they were called to witness a similarl
one between Sportive canines, who likewise belonged to:
the brute creation. This match had been pending sincel
the 15th of last month. between the respective owners of .
the English bull terrier “Crib,” of this city, and thel
American terrier “Mac,” of Milwaukee. Both these!
animals are “old stagers,” and have frequently beforet
entertained the “fancy,” from the regions of the pit, and .
consequently their rel—appearance attracted great atten- ‘1
tion among the “milling coves.” The match was une-i
quivocal—“ﬁght or come down” being the word. “Mac” ,
was owned by “Jim” Rowan, of Milwaukee, and “Ben” ‘
Sabin, of this city, was the. proprietor pf “Crib.” Like ‘
the belligerents in the Sunday “mill” on the “Sands,”
bo‘h these animals were put through a rigid course of
“sprouts” previous to the ﬁnal grand “set-to.” The re-
collection of the great ﬁght on the prairie near Calumet,
in ’66, and its attendant excitement, the immense crowd t
l

 

of "buffers” it attracted, &c., loomed up before the fer-
tile imaginationsof the “fancy.” , .,
The ever—vigilant “ﬂy-cops” must not get wind of the i
affair, not they. Should Capt. Jack Nelson get an ink- f
ling of it, the ﬁght would be transferred from the dogs }
to the dog-fanciers and the police, and then would follow
a night in the Armory, without even a “smell” of any- »

lsa‘oon is‘r‘eared aloft on piles, standing full twelve feet
i from terra ﬁrma. Entering from Clark street, you
passedthrough the saloon into a back room, then down
. a pair of rickety stairs. through the cellar, and ﬁnally
/' emerge into the pit. This arrangement proved satisfac-
,i tory to the short—haired “milling coves” who had an in- i

' i'vitation to the ﬁght. . .
‘ At 10 o’clock on the appointed day, this delightful lo— I .

cality swarmed with the “fancy,” attired in their most L
“nobby” get up. Only the “knowing ones” were allowed !
to pass the inner door, and enter the templeof Mars.
There the “jabber” was akin to Babel, the audience be-
ing composed of “hobinobs,” “hogs in togs,” “heisters,” ‘
Whookers,” numerous “natty'kids,” and a large sprinkf ,
ling of “na'zy coves.” When all was in readiness for the 1
“‘mill” to cdmmence, “outside pals” were chosen; who I
took up their positions in front of the saloon, and at the
inner doors thereof, to wat’vh for the approach of-any
stray “ﬂatty cop” who might come along. The darkness
. of the place was relieved by two cracke< kerosene lamps
which lie (led from the ceiling over the “pit.” ,

The canines made their appearance at half-past two;
. o’clock, upon which the entire assemblage cheered and 3
; roared. “Little Mac” first entered the ring, led by his
'trainerand owner, Jim Rowan, of Milwaukee. “Mac”
‘ is a white bull terrier, ﬁfteen months old, and weighed
29 1-2 pounds. He is a veteran of the pit, this being his I
fourth “mill.” His hair was straight, and showed the ‘
polish of health and niuscular'activity. He looked the
very bull-dog, which, however, hedid not prove himself,
.to be. “Crib,” the Chicago . dog, . next followed his 3

_ ‘liandler, Ben Sabin, into the ring, and a shout greeted
the pair. His 101i g yellow hair glistened in the faint
light, and ‘his eyes snapped ﬁre as they met those of his
. antagonist. “Crib” was evidently not a common foe to;
deal with. , ' _ ‘
Three o’clock arrived, and the dogs were unmuzzled,
the handlers going to their respective corners: The l
chains were slipped, and the encountered began in good ‘
iearnest. :
“Little Mac” seized “Crib” by the “ gullet” and threw ',
him, holding him there as if in a. vice. At this unexef
ected opening, odds were offered ﬁfty to one hundred,
‘ln favor of the Milwaukee cur. At length “Crib” man-
aged to wriggle his throat from the “mazzard” of his ad-
versary, but at great damage to his “jugular,” and in- ,
siantly seizin Mac threw him. (Cries of 100 to 15 on f
. "Crib.”) Bot i having now tasted blood, the ﬁghtgrew1
lintensely exciting. Mac getting free made for “Crib’s”
“‘ki’iowledge—box” and inserted his “ivories” over his l
“lamps” which brought forth a prolonged howl. Symp- l
toms of “wind 11p” were now visible in the actions ofthe l
Milwaukee" favorite, and the Chicago terrier followe l
closely his advantage. Finally “Crib” seized “Mac” by
the “gob,” and they both went to the ground together,
the latter evincing no signs of an intention to renew the ,
struggle. They were separated and taken to their re- }
spective 'corners, where after a little rest, they were ‘
“scratched” by their respective handlers. "Crib” made .
another furious dash at " M ac,” but the latter refused to .
come to time. The sponge was thrown up and the Chi-
cago dog declared the winner.

The ﬁght lasted 43 minutes, and a large sum of; money
changed hands. ,A more disgusting affair never came off
so successfully in the midst of civilization, and under'
the very eaves—droppingspf our city sanctuaries. It is
probable that the Rev. Dr. Hatﬁeld will deliver his next ,
discourse upon the “prize ring,” having exhausted his.

thought I ought to have let go my dog. I don’t think so. I
want to see a dog catch my dog before I loose him. The Butcher
. party and referee left bk pit;’and_ciine and told me to leave
with my dog, as he called its draw; because Mr. Referee and his
friend had $10 each in the» match, which was only for $100. My
dog was the favorite at $100 to $26, and the referee was empow-
ered before lighting to give the battle to the best dog, and never
mind the handling. How can this match be called a draw, when
they themselves refused to let the dogs ﬁght on. and took him

Pit, and see if I was not robbed out of the money; yet I never
said a word about it until now, when I am obliged to. The next
day we met and fought Badger and the Irish dog Crib, 19115, for
$250 a side, and after making several scratches I gave in for

of mine, and of course never defeated, because they would never
match him for a dollar again.

$50 he would, or try to, which he did, to the astonishment of every-
body, he falling on his fore quarters, and still going all the time.
, Paddy's handler picked up his dog and I claimed. And although

i pistols to the referee’s head and carried him away by force; in
addition, offered to let him keep $250 and give them the rest.
The referee will make an aiﬁdavit to this fact. In their presence
he handed me the money, viz., $500, which fact was not stated.
In this case 1 got the decision and the money; and yet, according
to this week’s account, the New 1 orker’s Won all. I have hun-

 

dreds of friends who want the truth of this matter, for thousands
of dollars depend on it. I wish to convince the public that, al-
though I came home minus two dogs, there are plenty more
where they came irom, and I am prepared to make all the ﬁve

justice to Mr. Jennings. As I was there, I will. give, you an .ac-

‘ George picked up his dog and claimed the ﬁght, when a scene
of confusion ensued; the referee was threatened on all sides

THE CERIGG EB... -

PIGEON MATCH AT NEWTOWN, L. I.

Webb King’s,a short distance from Newtown, L. L. was the
great centre of attraction for many of the leading sporting men
of the metropolis and vicinity on the 4th inst, which was t1 e:
ﬁxture for the decision of the two hundred dollar match be.
tween Scott Rodman (who recently defeated John Steele) and
James Steele. The conditions were to shoot at ﬁfteen singles
each, with 1%,:02. shot, the distance same as usual. Considering
the state of the weather, which was anything but favorable for '
the sport, owing to the prevalence of a. high wind rendering it

 

‘exceedingly difﬁcult to draw a bead, the skill displayed wag-

1 at New Brunswick, N. J ., in three weeks from this date, and if this.
i; proposition is accepted Mr. Johnson can at once communicate

l creditable. Rodman'came'oﬁ‘ with the honors, pinking thirteen
‘ birds to the eleven brought down by his opponent.

After the principal event of the day had been disposed of, and
all present had refreshed the inner man with the luncheon and
bibibles which had~ been prepared upon the grounds, a number
of impromptu matches were shot off between the spectators,
over one hundred and forty of the feathered tribe being com»
pelled to run the gauntlet ere the ambition of the amateur ‘
marksmen was gratiﬁed. Among those who distinguished them-
selves was Joe Coburn, Ex—champion of the P. R., who dropped
three birds in succession and proved himself well nigh as clever
with the trigger as with his digits.
time was enjoyed by all present.

THE Tenn—On the 10th inst. a shooting match will take place

in New Jersey, between Messrs. Carson, Painter, and Haddell.

on the one side, and Mount, Neole and Payne on the other, nine
birds to each man. On the 15th a. match, said to be for $200 a

side, will be contested by Miles Johnson and Wm Carson, at 25

double birds each.

CHALLENGE TO MILES Jonuson.—We are authorized to say A

that in consequence of Miles Johnson having expressed himself“
dissatisﬁed at his defeat by William Taylor, of Jersey City, in
their recent'match at pigeon shooting, and his desire for another
contest, Mr. Taylor will accommodate him, and shoot him for
$200 or $250 a side, at ﬁfty single birds, 21 yards rise, 80 yards»
boundary, and an ounce and a half shot. The match to be shot

CHALLENGE TO PIGEON SHOOTEBS.—-We are authorized to state“

. that Messrs. H. Scott Rodman, Paul Mead and Robert Boomson, .
are prepared to make a. match to shoot any three amateur gem
tlemen pigeon shots in America, at twenty-one single birds each,
twenty-one yards rise, and eighty yards Loundary, and will shake

one thousand dollars. against eight hundred dollars on the result. ,

- ‘ PIGEON SLAUGHTER‘IN TREMON'L—On Saturday afternoon, the ‘

, 6th inst, there was a gathering of the lovers of the trigger near
Tremont, in the County of Westchester, to witness a pigeon kil- .
ling match between Joe Harrison and Bob Murray, the latter an».
old hand at. the game. Throughout the contest—which was Only
decided in favor of Harrison by one bird—the utmost excitement
preVailed among the spectators, who entered into the spirit of '
the affair with an unusual amount of interest. The match Was. ‘
for $25 a side, seven birds, and resulted in a “tie,’{ when it was»
agreed that as ch man should shoot until he missed his bird. The .
following is the score of the contestantsz—Harrison, 1 1 0 1 1 0 0
6 0 1—5; Murray, 1 1 0 1 0 1'0 0 0 0—4. In consequence of the
windy nature of the weather, a great deal of difﬁculty was expe-
rienced in gettio g the birds to rise, otherwise the shooting would
probably have been better.

PIGEQ‘N’ Snoorme AT NEW BRUNSWICK, N. J .-—-On Saturdayﬁ
13th inst, there was a large gathering of the lovers of the sports ‘
of the trigg er at H. French’s, about three miles from New Bruns-l

ﬁrst mat-ch was between George Everett and John Bennett for l
$100 a side at ﬁfteen birds each, and was won by Bennett, who ~.
killed eleven out of his ﬁrst. thirteen “'rirds, while Everett only"

e brought down eight but of the same number. The next was a
sweepstakes for $10 each, for which Miles John son, George
Wood, A. Abbott, R. Wells, Chas. Morgan. George Everett and
two others entered. lt- resulted in a tie between Miles Johnson

stood, "not a hirsute bartender, but a.
remarkably pretty and; modest-looking young girl. Neatly
dressed and; smi ng she presented a strange contrast to
the vulgar rowdyism by which she was surrounded. . It
was a painful thought that she must have had long ex-
, perience, young as she Was,'thus to encounter unabashed
'1 the brutal‘language, and still more brutal lpoks of the
: ruﬂians she served with drink. The greater part of the
1, company, in the intervals between drinks, crowded
round a stove in the middle 01 the room—most of them
could be recognized at a glance as sports, gamblers,
fsh'arpers and pimps; there was also a sprinkling of
students from the medical colleges and one or two
oﬁicers from a ship-of—war in the harbor. The proprie-
tor of the house, a thick set Englishman, seemed :
well-acquainted with my conductor, for he not only
furnished tickets for our .admission to the coming
ﬁght, but offered to take us up stairs to see his canine
menagerie. We accepted the offer, and climbed up to the
‘ attic, which smelt badly enough, but not so bad as the
, barroom. Here there seemed to be dogs of all sizes, ~
ages, shapes-and hues. The preprietor produced two or
. three pet puppies for our admiration, dilated on the su-
periority of his dogs and then led us down stairs again to
the rat pit, which was in the cellar, probably for secur-
ity from the attacks of the police. It was a dark, dirty
place; rough plank seats rose in tiers from the pit in the ‘
centre to the mouldy, snail tracked walls, with here and
there a gas light 8 'cking out in a vain attempt to enliven
the dreary den, he rat pit itself was circular, about
six feet in diameter, .with a. fence round it to 1
keep the rats from jumping out. The bot— _
tom was covered with sawdust. The seats
were soon ﬁlled, and then a bull-headed little man,
dressed in ﬁghting trim, shorts and tights, jumped into '
the ring and informed us that he was disappointed in _
the non-arrival of a celebrated dog he expected from
New York, but in order that we might not lose our Sport,
the rats should he put into the ring and he would either
match a dog of his own against them, or kill them himm
self, just as we pleased. The majority of the crowd j
seemed delighted at this, and howled out a request that ‘
he would kill them himself. A boy then brought in a

large bag, and, holding it by the corners, emptied two ,
dozen big ship rats out of it into the pit, pretty

much in the style that Professor Anderson shakes

out his egg hag._ The unsightly animals ran round‘
the pit for a few seconds, trying to jump over
the fence, or ﬁnd some other mode of escape,
but failing in this they collected in big black
ugly masses, with their little eyes shining like beads.
The ratcatcher then jumped into the pit and knelt on
one knee in‘the middle of it. A' confederate stood out-
side, holding a stop watch, and all at once gave the sig- ;
nal to begin. Then came a horrible spectacle. Quick as =
lightning the man plunged his hand into the mass 1
oi“ rats, seized one by the back and carried it to his 3
mouth-then a squeak and a crunch and the lifeless car-

case was tossed ends with a broken neon As soon as .

the rats found what was going on and that there was no-
escape for them, they attacked the man, climbing up on
his thighs, but he was too quick to let them get higher;.
he kept both hands busy and looked as if he was a ma-
gician, pulling a constant stream of dead rats from his
mouth. Before as long as it has taken to tell it, the bot»
tom of the pit was covered with dead bodies. One or'
two terriliedsurvivors were caught and killed, and then,
amid acclamations of delight from the audience, the man '
jumped up, felt his lip which had been bitten once or
twice, pulled the rat hairs from between his teeth, and
washed away the taste with a glass of liquor. Such at
description needs no further comment.

tapis between Harry Hill’s hunting dog ' ‘ Charlie”
and Captain Schirmer’s blacK-and-tan terrier
“Neptune. ” The man was to have taken place on
Friday last, but was postponed owing to the dim-

’ RAT CATCHING IN NEW-YORK.

Rat' catching is not included under the,
head of the “learned professions,» nor”
have rat catchers as a class, occupied a

prominent position in the history of the world
These are facts incontrovertible, and yet the profes4
sion is one requiring no small amount of skill and

- . ability, and doubtless many followers in its devious:

paths have been the pride of the conirateinity to

;which they may have belonged. But Withal 1.0 is

; not a herom calling, nor one likely to be recommend—
j ed by a man of wealth to his son for adoption.
? ~ in London and Paris there are regularly organized
; bodies of rat catchers. This may be a fact known t0»
3 all, but probably few are aware that here in the me-
, tropolis of New-York a very large number or men
‘ procure a livelihood in pursuing a similar vocation ..
t From statistical sources we learn that there are
? from forty to ﬁfty recognized ratcatcuers in our me»
tropolis. The city is parcelled on“ into so many dis .
- iricts, and to each is allotted one, two, or three
men, according to its importance in a. “rat” point ,
of View. This calculation is possibly arrived at by
. rat-iocination (a geek). 0f the various districts,
the one considered of the most importance is

that comprised in the ’ Fourth and
a portion of the Seventh Wards. A
large number oi stables and grain.

- stores in the neighborhood ali’ord the rats comforta-
able quarters, and here they exercise the most ex-
traordinary fecundity. This portion of the city is
assigned to the tender care of Jack Jennings,
brother to Harry, who formerly kept a well-ordered
rat-pitin White street. He is the rat-catcher par
mellence, the champion of his profession. The-
capture of from 100 to 150 of these animiles is cons
sidered by him a fair night’s work, and he has ofte .
caught and bagged so many as 200. It s
not, however, to be supposed that all the
followers of this trade make out so well. By no
means. In some neighborhoods rats are much
scarcer, much more cunning, and the sports?

. man may not be so expert. These all inﬂuence the
haul, and 25 per nox may be set down as the aver-
age capture . .

HOW THE GAME Is BAGGED.

Rat hunting differs from the pursuit of other
game materially. While a sportsman boasts, with
good reason, in killing thirty brace 01' partridge or
a dozen hares or two dozen rabbits, the rat hunter
would look upon his killing one hundred rats.

1 as a very bungling job. He must catch

3 them alive. In this is constituted the great secret of

l the profession, and tire great diﬂiculty of it likewise.

, phernalia. Impm'mts two large canvas bags, 9.
strong trap of iron wire, and a large bottle of subtle;
, compound, said to have a certain magic charm for,1
l—enticing the game. He has acrowber,ajack-knife, ‘1’
, and a dark lantern. Starting down Catherine
street we reach the river and proceed along Front?
street. After following this street for some time we ‘
strike oﬁ‘into an alley, and Jack tells us to keep
’ quiet and look out for the “cops,” meaning the
g M. Ps. He reaches astable door, and obtaining 1
’ admission proceeds cautiously along the wall. 5
1 Then turning the light of thelantern on surround- l
" ing objects, he discloses several of the objects or his
; search quietly feasting off some choice:1
‘ provender. Now comes the time for action. :
Placing the trap on the ground and; ,
in the vicinity of the game, he waits for the result, ,
j and presently we hear a slight click, showing that
‘ some of the unsuspecting have been ensnared. But ‘
he has not been idle. Having poured some of the-
-liquid contained in the bottle beforementioned upon ‘
his hands, he gets down his full length on the
ground, and crawls towards the rats. Seizing one after'
the other, he drops each quietly into the bag, other- ‘
wise ‘ ‘gives them the sack. ” The compound on his ‘
hands, known as the oil of Rhouium, prevents th
rats from biting them. It is no unusual thing for"

the rat-catcher to plunge hand and arm into the .

rat-hole and seize the unfortunate animals, unmind-v ,‘
‘ ful of their frantic efforts at escape. This he con- ,
4. tinues until all have been captured save those who-1

have shown their discretion by running away, and:

Jack, throwing his now partially ﬁlled bag over his
shoulder, proceeds to some other ﬁeld, or, rather .
‘ stable, where to ply his proiession. ,
, place he goes, with more or less success, returning ‘

by daybreak, generally laden with the proﬁts of his»

labors, in the shape of a ﬁne haul of rats.

WHAT RATS ARE WORTH.

Rats before the war were cOnsidered dear at ﬁve:
cents, but with all other commodities they have
risen in price, and cannot now be purchased under ,
ﬁfteen cents a-piece, and no reduction in buying:
by the dozen. The rat market is ﬁrst, of course
With the rat-pit, and as sporting characters are no: '
tably far irom being illiberal when the gratiﬁcation;
of their tastes is considered, the rat-catchers en-
Icroach, and thus is the enormous charge of ﬁfteen
cents accounted for. It is supposed that the fall in-

): the price of gold may in some way inﬂuence the rat ,
‘ market, but so long as there is a monopoly of the”
trade and so little competition such a consumma-a:
tion, however devoutly to he wished for, can!
scarcely be expected. Indeed, in some cases even]?
higher priCes are given, that is when game is..
scarce, or the sportsman has met with some more
than usual run of ill luck. For instance ‘
should Jennings get drunk, and it is alleged he
occasionally does, the market of‘the Fourth Ward ‘
is unprovided for, and the noble sport must be fore-
gone, as, according to the rules or the fraternity,
‘ ‘ no person or persons licensed rat-catchers, shall ;

at any time hunt for or dispose of game in any i ‘

other district or districts save in that or thoseto ‘
which he or they have been allotted by the associa- 1
ton.” ‘
THE RAT-CATCHER AT HOME.

, It must not be supposed that a man
is necessarily of a low or depraved dis-
posmon who follows this business. Far
irom it. Many of them are of quiet
dispomtion and abstemio us habits, and some almost
gentlemanly in department. Some whom we have
met have doubtlessly seen better days, and when
we adverted to their early history, one or two turned

aside to hide their emotion. Many of them, too, have ‘

catcher, it is to say the least, pecul‘ar. Under this ‘
head may be placed the story told so pathetically of
the oﬂ‘spring of a certain member of the professton.

in the neighborhood of London, in Vestminster, or, \
rather, not quite there, but at the “tlother Side of i
“the vater. ” Her own and her father’s calling is
thus quaintly told by the gilted lyric writer: ,
‘ ‘Her father caught rats, and she sold sprats,
All round and about that quarter. ”
And the respect in which she was held is proven
by the fact that
‘ -The gentlefolks all took off their hats
To the pretty little rat- calcher’s daughter.”
Alter describing her attractions, whlcn must have
been considerable, we gather from the fact that her
; hand was sought both by high and
low ‘ for many a mile around the
neighborhood in which she lived. She spurned
all her rich suitors, and fell in love with a poor but
honest vender of ‘ ‘lllY-Vlte sand.” It was one of
those cases where the love was mutual, but, as is
oiten the case, . ‘the course of true love seldom runs
smooth.” They had deCided to be married on the en-
suing Easter Sunday; but alas! she went shortly
after to buy some sprats, fell into the water, and
was drowned. The effect of the news on her intend- .
ed is thus graphically told: ' l
‘ ‘Ven lily-vite sand he heard the news,
His eyes ran down With water;

Said he ‘m love I’ll'constiant prove,
And blow me if I’ll live long arter. ’

So he cut his throat vith a pane of glass,
And stabbed hlS donkey arter;

So here is an end or lily-Vite sand,
Donkey, and the rat-catcher’s daughter. ”

This sorrowful story not only proves the fact of ,1
ihe‘possicility of there being sentiment in a rat- "
catcher’s family, but also establishes the fact or the 1
antiquil of the business, the spelling of the above
ballad eing evidently of the time or Chaucer.

. RAT'lKILLING IN NEW-YORK. ‘

Rat-killing has been in England, for many years, a l
favorite sport. Dogs are specially trained for the ‘
sport, and proprietors of rat-pits have made a ,
agreat deal of money by it. In New-York it is no
less popular amongst certain classes, and is prob- 5
ably amongst the least repulsive of the favorite
amusements of this class. In the old days of N‘ew-
York there were several well-known rat-pits. Re-'
cently, Harry Jennings’s house in White street was
_ one of the most popular, and for many years a house
situated in Madison street, near Oliver, was much
hearted to, At present there are several good pits
both in this city and in Brooklyn; but it
is to be regretted that there is no
pit used exclusively for rat-killing, most of them A
serving the purpose for cock and dog ﬁghts as well.
The amusement is as popular as ever here, and many
Who would not be present at either a dog ﬁght or a
prize ﬁght, make no objections to witness an exhi-
bition or this nature. Matches are frequently made
between owners of dogs as to the number of rats
each will kill in a given time, or how long each will
take to get away with a certain number.
at is generally the case that dogs of the same kind
are pitted against one another; but on yesterday a
match of a peculiar nature-came 011‘ where two dogs
of opposite breeds were matched for $100 a side.
The ma: ch came 011’ with great success.

THE RAT PIT AND ITs OCCUPANTS.

At 2 P. H. a number or the leading sports of New-
!ork were congregated at Harry Hill’s well-known
restaurant in Houston street. Alter some time spent

I’m there; a man oughter know wen he gets a good
mashin’, and oughter stop wen he gets enough, if
he a’nt a d—d fool. I know I allers do; but then,
yer see, I never did get enough.” Mostpf those
present were in the ‘ ‘Iancy line, ’7 and, as Hood has
it, . ‘fancied spirits instead of wine, and call all lap-
dogs ‘WenusJ” There was not, however, present
one single representative of the type “rou h.”
True, there were those who looked dissipated and
knowtng, and many of the betting case; but
there were no “mashers” nor “nose.
eaters,” always supposed to form the
ingredients of a crowd of this class.
They had come to see a rat.killing, and the very
fact of its being Evacuation Day imparted to all a
good humor that seemed to convey itseli to the
dogs, who yelped joyously at the prospect of some-
thing ior them to do, and for which they would be
pi aised or blamed according as they acquitted them-
selves.
AMONGST THE RATS.

Soon, however, the conversation was put a stop
'10 by the appearance ol “Kit ” himself in the pit,
With a large sack—a plainlyliv-ing sack, for an ce-
caSional squeal emanated from it. Kit is alarge
man, anda muscular one at that. His face is non
exactly one that would attract the admiration 01' a
very romantic young lady, but still there is some-
thing good humored about it, and something that
tells one that however rough he may seem, he has
at least a good disposition. He deposits the’ sack
in the pit and draws from it a cage crammed lull of
.rats. Releree and time-keeper haying been ap-
pointed, Kit, with a small tongs, counted
out eighteen rats. Small rats and large
.rats, old rats and young rats, all kinds
‘and 'shapes and patterns_ of rats. They
scamper about surprised at receiving their liberty,
but suspicious of foul play they strive to cross the
paling surrounding the pit, but are beaten down.
All this time the two dogs are yelling to get at them,
and a chorus of yells far from musmal answer from
some unknown region. The "Chorus ofInvisibles”
in "Der Freischutz” is nothing to it. Then Kit

‘ takes Captain Schirmer’s in his hands. It is a black-

.and-tan terrier crossed with one of those short-legs,
ged German dogs. Harry cries out, “Oh, G—,
dan’s back is too long. He’s only
four legs. Take him home. Cap.” “Not as I
knows-on,” replies Cap. “Go,” cries the time-
keeper,” and in the dog jumps. He makes a dash
for the nearest rat to him, shakes him in his teeth,

and drops him dead; then he chases anotnerround ;
the pit, andﬁnally extinguishes him; then into a :

pile ofi'our or ﬁve, and demolishes them. Heavens,

how they run about now! how they squeal and ’

run between his legs, and dodge him; and one old
fellow doubles on him like a fox. He has killed six
of them. and seems tired or sick of ’ the
sport. Then his owner is again invited to take him
home, and Kit gets mad about it, and cries,
"Ratslll and Nep. goes in again, and spreads
consternation among the rats. lie has lost time,
and strives to make up ior it; and now the ﬂoor is
strewn with the dead and dying, and at last Kit
cries out, -" ‘All dead.” and Neptune is taken from
the pit. Time, ﬁve and a half minutes.

.CHARLLE’S TRIUMPH.

j revels in the sport, and knocks their rats’hips about
3 With very little semblance of respect. They squeal
‘ and squirm and ﬁnally make a die of it. It is
amusing when Charlie comes to his last rat. He
'hasbeen lying among the dead iii the hope of
wescaping detection; but Charlie is not to be de-
«netted; he smells about, and ﬁnally the cunning

("back as the sharp teeth of the rat meet in his leg.

with the greatest good will, and the rat gives up
the ghost. All dead. Time—two minutes. Thus
bharlie is pronounced the Winner.

Then Dick Hill must have some rats for his pretty .

little dog Nelly, and sue gets halt a dozen, and

to his delight demolishes them well in less than a
minute, ,

‘ AMONGST THE DOGS.

Then Kit, at the solicitation 01' several present,
Promisesa “shake up,” and goes down to get up
the dogs. Down a dingy stairs, and in a dark cel-
lar, he has a rare collection of some twenty-eight
ﬁghaing dogs. A row of small kennels is ranged
aong the wall, and in each of these is chained a
dog. Each animal has a glowmg re-
cord of sundry well-fought battles. An ear

. on here, an eye out there, are surlicient indications
of certain .sangciinary conﬂims in whicti each has
sustained a prominent part.
chained or Heaven help the stranger Who dare trust
himself Within range of their shiny jaws. Each has
a pedigree, and their owner is as proud ofthezn as
were he possessor of so many Flora Temples or Dex-
ters. There is a rough, shaggy, dangerous brute
called Yankee Sullivan. He is now kept for stallion
purposes; and the dog said to have been stolen years
since from a soap-lat man is kept for practising on
in _the pit for being punished for the sake of

‘ trying the mettle of the rest. Kit
selected some two bull dogs, as handsome as these
ungainly brutes can lock. One was a white and
black, in the other, red supplied the place oi
black.

A SHAKE-UP.

It was plain now that a ~‘ ‘shake-up” meant a
dog ﬁght. Kit and his companion each brought up
a cog and 180111}; them they .let them go. Immedi-
ately on being let. go they closed, the one seizing
hold or the OLDBI‘7S jaw. They roll over in the" pit,

has him by the back of the neck andholds on like
grim death. How the other wriggles and tWists and
snaps, while blood streams from the faces of both.
Again on hind legs they sway to and
110 for the masaery. Eacn has held of the
other with a tenacious grip, and a mingled stream
Ol blood and foam track-s its way down their throats
and legs. It IS not a pleasant sight. No one
speaks, and still the dogs tussle and tear each
other. There are no rounds, no ca'ling ior time;
they ﬁght with. the energy of madness, and when
Kit, at the request or the spectators, attempted to
separate them. he found it imposs1ble. Still they
held on, growling angrily. Three times he at-
tempted to separate them, and three times failed.
A fourth time he was successful, and With a sigh of
relief the spectators ﬁnd the contest is at an end.
. These are looked upon by Kit as merely playful
struggles. The dogs seldom sustain any serious in-
jury, and a day or so Of careful treatment generally
restores them to their ordinary good condition.
A PROPOSITION.

The “shake-up” over several of the spectators
departed and the remainder adjourned to the par,
where they refreshed themselves With some “good
tipple.” Then returning to the pit, a sailor, Jacr:
Moore by name, in poking round came across
“bruin,” Who growled him a welcome. Jack re-
sponded with an “avaSt heave,“and “shivered
liisiimhersv if he wouldn’t “tight the bear for
drinks.” The proposition was at'hrst received
With laughter, but the sailor was in earneSt and
in prooi of his Sincerity, posted the money. Kit
not at all unused to this novel trial of strength, con-
sented to stand security for the bear’s share of the
money, and so it was arranged.

THE COMBATANTS.

Elfin-FIGHTING- IN SPAIN.
. ———+—-—~
Public Opinion in Regard to the Sport
‘ —CurlouS’Statistlcs.
From the London Daily Telegraph. ‘
“ For some time past,” we are told, the Press
of Madrid have been publishing articles against bull-
ﬁghting. Ver1lyaﬁ‘airs in Spain appear to be‘ap-

‘prbachingamost extraordinary pass. Attack bull- ‘

ﬁghting! Why we should have as soon expected the
Madrileno journals to attack the Jota Aragonese, or to
.speak disrespectfully of puckero, or to question the

 

virtues of cold water. Attack Tauromachia! wage "
‘1 war against the mediacorrtda, libel the science pro- ‘-

lfessed by a Montis, a Cuchans, and a Gorditol why
the next thing we may look for from a Castilian cabal-

Zero will be for him to lay aside his cloak, abandon '

'pcz‘garz’tos, and pay his debts. The beginning of the _
end is clearly imminent in the Peninsula. If the

bull-ring is not to be secure from attack the ,

guitar is in danger; the castanets are menaced;

pronunciamientos W111 vanish out of the land; the ‘

“ mooners ” will cease to haunt the Puerta del Sol;
Padre JAUT will cease to be inﬂuential; there will be
no more comic operas at the Zarzuela; tertullias
where you sit up till three in the morning, regaling
yourself on lumps of sugar and cold water, will be -
deserted; the Manzanaris will beecme a river; Our
Lady of Atocha will leave oﬂ" performing miracles;
; the trains on the Madrid and Zaraeoza Railway will

grun with tolerable punctua 'ty; Seﬁoras will cease to '

wear mantillas and ﬂirt with fans; caballeros will no
longer play mont'i ; in a word, all the Cases de Espaita
will shrink to their second cause, and unobserved
expire. * Plus ultra. is the proud motto of the Spanish

monarchy; but no Castilian could have expected ‘

such a culmination of his country’s woes as the im-
pugn-merit of bull-ﬁghting- It is time to turn the
Pillars of Hercules into post-oﬁice letter-homes if the
national recreation of the Spanish people is to be
spoken of with such shocking disrespect by the

Madrid Press. It may be, after all, that our Madrileno ‘-

contemporaries are shy of talking politics justrat

l

 

present; and, being rather at a loss for topics to dis-
cuss, are‘fain to taire it out of bull-ﬁghting.

The “attacks,” however, made against a sport

which, trom time immemorial, has ﬁlled the Spanish
mind with ﬁerce enjoyment have brought to light
some curious statistics. We are enabled now to

strike a balance in the books of the national pastime. 0
The number of bull-ﬁghts has of late considerably - ~

increased; and it is calculated that in the single year
.1861 as many as 1,990 toros ole muerte were tortured to
death. The sardonic historian of the Decline and
Fall calculated the “annual consumption of mar-
tyrs ” from NERO to DIOCLETIAN to be about seventy~
ﬁve. On a sounder basis, it may be assumed
that Spain, to gratify a wanton spirit of (cruelty,
kills three bulls a day. The average may be

slightly increased when it is borne in mind that ’

during the forty days of Lent the tos'eadores
piously refrain from stabbing their bulls; and hold
corridors de novillos in which the animal’s horns

are 'ipped with wooden buttons, and. in which he

is only driven half mad with baiting, but islet off
'With his life until Easter. The value of the bulls

killed every year is estimated at a million of rcals, or f
”ten thousand pounds sterling. The slaush tezed car- .

:casses are all but useless, for the skin has been

pierced in innumerable places, and scorched up by -

the ﬁzzing crackers of the banderz‘llos, and the reverse.

{iceria is sold atavile price to the meanest ot the
populace. Epicures may declare that a hare never
eats well unless it has been hunted, but it would need
3 strong stomach to digest “fought " beef. In 1861
three thousand. horses are , supposed to .have
perished in the bull-ring, and as the ammals
fidden by the picadores are usually the most

deplorable old Rosinantes that it 18 poss1ble

u ere than nine thousand pounds. rue eatalogue of
slaughter in 1866 is still heavier. In thatyear 2,375
bulls and-48,561 horses perished, representing a total
Value of_al:jout sixteen thousand pounds. The money
paid foryadmission to the four hundred and seventy-
Iivefunc'io which took place last year amounted to .
twenty-Six; heusand pounds, and the total cost to
the country‘e'f the “amusement ” during 1866 was
not less than twoihunored thbusand pounds. We
are not told whether this amount includes the vast
sums for wageslost by the working cl sees, who
abandon their avocations to rush to the beloved
arena, or the still larger sums lost in frenzied gamb—
linp: and betting as to the number of horses that the
bull will slay—eighteen have been known to be
ripped up by one animal—or as to the time. which
.yill elapse between his rushing into the arena and
his falling under, the knife of the carnicero.
The noble sport! Nobler than prize ﬁghting,
aobler than cock or dog ﬁghting, noblcr than duck-
nunting, noblcr than rat-killing! Who, but the
most degenerate oi Spaniards would dare to breathe
a word against the gallant recreation? What a
brilliant picture is that of “Bravo Tore!” now on
View in the English Fine Arts Gallery in the Theme
I'le Mars! What etchings are those 01 Fransisco
GOYA—the Duchess of ALBA’S Goya—representing
ill the. episodes of Tauromachy. GOYA and the bean-
biflll, eccentric Duchess were both aﬁcionados or
amateur bull—ﬁghters. At the present day more than
one Grandee of the blues: blood keeps a private
bull-ring, and wields, from time to time, the, .
espada dc muerte of the matador. Nay,r""if report
speaks true, one of the _t’ai1'est and gentlest
of EurOpean Empresses was in early life pas-
sionately fond of bull-ﬁghting. The Spain.-
lards themselves declare that the ﬁrst time
a Senora goes to the Plaza de Toros she taints away.
On her second visit she is onlyalittle sick. The
third time she screens her face with her ﬁsh, but
"peeps intently round the corner at the combat going
on below. After her fourth corrida she becomes a
onﬁrmed bull-fighter. It is but. just to state that
he present Queen of Spain has rarely. if ever, at-
ended a bull-ﬁght, and that among the higher ranks
of the female aristocracy in Madrid the brutal pass-
time has ceased to be fashionable. But among the

' . middle classes and the mass of the people—men,
women and children—there is as strong apassion as

ever for the sanguinary spectacles.g'The1-e are bull—
ﬁghts everywhere—in Leon; in“ Aragon, in the
Castiles, in Andalusia. A company of toreadores pe~
‘riodically visit the little town of San Rogue tor
the especial beneﬁt of the ofﬁcers in the British
garrison of Gibraltar. The bull-ring in Madrid

play at bull-fighting. * What the scene’i’s like the pub-H . .

he knows pretty well from pictures and from beets
of travels. But both painters and tourists have usu-
ally shrunk from doing full justice tot-he most prom.
inent feature. That ieature is blood. The sand of
the arena is literally dabbled in gore. The place be-
comes at last a shambles. The wretched horses, rip~
ped up by the infuriated bull, limp round the ring
with their bowels hanging out; and the chulos run up

- to out oh“ the protruding entrails and stuff tow into

the wounds. Thena man follows behind to cudgel
the miserablelhorse, which must carry the picador
on his back until he amps and dies. Sometimes the
picadores are tossed, often they are killed. Sometimes
the chulos and banderilleros are gored by the terriﬁc
horns of the beast they are torturing. Sometimes
the bull ,makes a rush at the matador himself, and
slays the slayer. We mention these revolting facts
.with a. view to show that in a Spanish bull-ﬁght the
{slaughter-house element largely predominates over .
{the “ct-picturesque,” I . . , , .,-,.....w.......,. ., .. . ..
‘5. .Dbtestable and well-nigh. demoniacal as an amuse-
‘ment, this “sport” yet presents, from an archaeolog-
ical point of view, much curious material for study. .
The Plaza de Toros in Spain is the lineal successor of ‘
the old Roman amphitheatre. The bull-ring and the ‘
Colisseum are brothers, and mat-adores and picadores
are the direct descendants of the old gladiators.
Some Spanish antiquarians maintain that the Moors
brought bull-ﬁghting into Spain, and all the torcac
dores whom GOYA has depicted are dressed in Moor-
‘ish costume; but it is held by other authorities that
the Mussulman conquerors must not be held re-
‘sponsible for anything worse than the naturalization
tot cock-ﬁghting in Andalusia, and that Tau-
.romacny came right through the Romans
and the Goths to the modern Spaniards. Be
.that as it may, there were , certainly bull-ﬁghts
.in the Coliseum at Rome when gladiators were shy,
‘or Christian martyrs were few, or barbarian captives
'ran scarce; and so late as the fourteenth century,
just before the great earthquake which rendered the
Coliseum untenantable, a magniﬁcent bull~ﬁght,

' merely unimpaired by sogginess, but in an enlarged Or;
- otherwise improved condition.

The most enthusiastic ‘
theorizers have learned that thus much deference must
be paid to the hard, practical sense of mankind. And so,
however well assured the philanthropists may themselves
be of the abstract loveliness of benevolence, and with

' whatever earnestness theyprivately stimulate one an-

other, to pursue it‘for its own sake, their prospectuses,
reports, and other public appeals dwell mainly upon the
beneﬁts sure to accrue to the community at large from
the abrogation of abuses which oppress any portion of it.
The suppository public, notoriously, is enlightened, lib-
eral, large-minded, and otherwise estimable in the" high-

est degree ; but the actual public, unless misery of some ,

kind is made unusually tangible to its senses, is asindif-
ferent to the duties of a catholic charity, unaccompanied

by’a‘reciprocal proﬁt, as was Shylock to the beauties of E

. mercy when Portia portrayed them.

From these and similar considerations which readily
suggest themselves, it is very evident thatthe American
Society for the Prevention of __Cruelty to Animals has
been organized upon a radically erroneous basis ; or rather,
perhaps, it resembles a locomotive which has the machin-
ery for propelling the driving-wheels on only one side, so

that a frequent dead-lock must occur unless a supplement- 7

ary apparatus. be attached on the other side to co-operate

- with it. The society at present has an essentially one-

sided arrangement of this Sort, such as no organization
of the kind can maintain. ‘ The societies, for“ example,
which undertook the evangelization of the cannibal
islands in the South seas would have had little success in

collecting either funds or missionaries had it been appre-I

hended that no increase of commerce was likely to result,
or that -the missionaries would be Called upon to enter
not only the islands but their inhabitants also. Yet it is

. with just as unﬂattering a prospect as this that the So-

' ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty. is appealing to public

- sympathy in behalf of the animals. In fact, there is every

certainty that no effort will be made to imbue them with
a proper sense of gratitude. Mr. Bergh is no doubt per-

fectly aware that he is himself as liable to be kicked by

a mule, or bitten by a dog, or to have his rest broken by

‘c, , wailing cats, as if he did not devote his time and money
i to ameliorating their condition. To be sure, the mules
:t and dogs and cats are, probably, many of them unac~ l'
“ quainted with Mr. Bergh; but even if he succeedsin bring-
. ing the entire human race to the adoption of his theories
3 and practice, there is no likelihood of a corresponding
vﬁhange in the deportment of the brute creation toward

ldisposed to do, that man is alone to blame for the un-
Ilpleasant relations subsisting between himself and other
forders of animals. It is self-evident that the treatment
5 we experience at the hands—or rather at the feet, claws,
teeth, and stings—of many of them is gratuitously disas
agreeable and injurious. To mosquitoes we originally af-
;ford no provocation, yet their persistent persecution is so
lindecorous and exasperating that even Socrates, proof as

gimpossible to dissemble his resentment. The entire

that mutual esteem and” good will may be promoted.
They have abundant examples that the manifestation of
such a disposition would be frankly and cordially recipro-
cated. Where, for instance, can a case be adduced of
maltreatment (by men) of a cricket or a katydid or a ca-
nary bird—creatures of a genial and inoffensive tempera-
ment. There must be mutual forbearance, as the horse,
for example, could not demand from a poor owner the
grooming and attention given by the proprietor of a
racing stud, nor could men reasonably insist that the ass
should speak only in mild tones or the goat divest him-
self of perl'umery. But if man is to be revolutionized, a
basis of reciprocal agreement should be arrived at. The
manner of attaining it falls naturally within the province
of the people who inaugurated the benevolent movement.
But inasmuch as, with reasonable diligence, the full ac-
complishment of their. present task may require several
centuries, and expedition is desirable, it might be ex-

MR. 31131111 MR. BARNUM, AND THE 1301‘

THE correspondence with which the public has lately3

been ediﬁed between or respecting these three celebri-i
ties has had the eﬁ‘ect to show that the ﬁrst has been3
a triﬂe too sentimental, the second a good deal too im-3
pudent, and that the third, like the devil, his prototype, 3
is not so black as he is painted. Mr. Bergh, in the ten-,,
derness of his heart, has probably overrated the new l
ous susceptibility of rabbits, upon whom a great many:
things besides constrictors will produce the effect of fear/3
ﬂ and trembling, and who will commonly run from their
. shadows as fast as from snakes. Mr. Barnum, with his
usual offensive readiness to turn everything into an

advertisement, has employed language much too gross;
and self-complacent to be addressed to a courteous, re-3

ﬁned, and well- meaning gentleman whose weakness ever 1
leans to virtue’ s side, and who is as much the renowned;
showman’s superior in social position as he 1s in thel

attributes which ought but do not always go to secure3

  
 

 

, 3 3' it. As for the Boa, he ﬁlls his niche with commendable3

‘ dignity and would probably ﬁll his stomach with eitherl
£_Mr. Barnum or Mr. Bergh with as much satisfaction as
:with rabbits, if he could only get the opportunity. 3
3 Mr. Barnum’ s fustian about giving people four times

’1’ :the worth of their money will pass as usual with the

proper grains of salt. He' 1s so notoriously' 1n the habit»
of giving more than he receives, even in the matter of

, angry co1respondence, that if his obj ections to Mr. Bergh’s

course rested on no other basis than this delicate assunip-3

 

 
 

pedient to create a branch organization, a zoological
benevolent society, which should educate and send forth 3

oion, the latter might well have forborne reply.-— But Mr.
Bergh, actuated by considerations which deserve every
possible respect and honor, probably went too far in
attributing human foresight and apprehensiveness to his,
poor little friends the rabbits. Pigeons and rabbits havel
various ways of suggesting their dislike to incarceration,,3
but it is certainly assuming too much to ascribe to either;
that vivid consciousness of impending doom which a man;
or even a showman might feel if shut up with an empty
serpent. The American public have really had almost
enough of Mr. Barnum, and, whatever their general.
esteem for the individual who stirs him up, the conse-
quences are never such as to excite their gratitude. If,1
indeed, he is to honor Connecticut by representing hen
in Congress, perhaps the best thing he can do will be to;
take the Boa with him ; there will be plenty of congenial“;
society for both, and if the great snake should acciden-1
tally get loose and make rabbits of a few of his cempan-f
ions the country would assuredly be none the worse for it. 3

Meanwhile it should be admitted that if there must be3

error in ou1 treatment of animals, whether boas or their! '

victims, it is much better that it should be on mercy ’8‘.
side. Far better that Mr. Bergh and his benevolent so-
ciety should make blunders by the score than that bar-
barism of any kind should go unrebuked and unpunished.

We recommend Mr. Bergh to let Barnum and his Boa
religiously alone for the future; for although he may be
willing to risk the deﬁlement of pitch for a generous end

so—he is no matchin billingsgate for his antagonist, and
if he were the game is hardly worth the candle. Barnum
and his Boa together constitute a team which is not easily

to rid us of them. Perhaps the removal of the former to

another ﬁeld of humbug and windy vituperation may

aford the community a temporary relief; and, as the
chance of disgracing a Congress like our present one is
too difficult, remote, and speculative to constitute a risk

worth counting, we hope Mr. Barnum may go there. If

REVIVAL OF THE EXCITEMENT~FRESH EXPOSURES '
OF ABUSES. ' ,

A number of years ago the I”will milk ” ex-
pOsure effected an immense amount" of good for the -
time being. That is, it made known and brought
under Police notice the wicked frauds by which the
people Were imposed upon in the sale of pnilk; and
.many of the criminal, establishments l were broken
up, and the pubho put upon an allowance of decent

 

 

 

cold water, or a respectable resemblance to milk. But .
the subject was permitted to gradually die out, and

the occurrence of the great Rebellion absorbed almost

immediate abuses and perils. _ As "the weeds of ”the field .

multiply,» when the eye of the husbandman is care- _
less, so the growth of any great wickedness must in- '

crease in strength and vigor ‘when there is a
laxity 7 of restriction and vigor. ‘But . it
is probably owing more to the inﬂuence of

the watchfu-Iness of the “'Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals" that we are this time apprised of the
fresh outbreak ;.._ this loathsome evil. Our citizenstare

horses. It is no uncommon thing to see an

Cruelties to Horses and Passengers.

' IT is diﬂicult to tell whether the bill just,
submitted to the Legislature at Albany, to pre-‘

vent the overcrowding of public conveyances,i
‘is meant to be for the protection of the pas-l
sengers or of horses. That Mr. Bergh is its,
author would seem to warrant the conclusion.Q
that the interests of the brute animals would not:
' be made secondary to those of the human, and
we mean no reﬂection on the motives of a.
useful and estimable citizen if we suppose
that the overcrowding of the cars and omni-

buses Was in his eyes only an oﬂ'ense and a _

nuisance because it is cruel to the horses. To
be sure one is, to a. great extent, the comple-i
ment of the other. No provision is 11111113,;
however, for requiring extra horses for extra.
jweights, and therefore the public may perhaps
fsuppose that overcrowding-purely and simply
5 ——is the evil which it is sought to remedy.

We are sorry to say that we think the mea-
sure proposed by Mr. Bergh will fail in
arresting the detestable practice of overcrowdmf
ling our public conveyances. It simply pro-
wides that. no stage shall carry more than
ttwelve persons besides the driver and a con-
ductor, and no streetcar more than twenty-y
four persons besides the driver and conductor, f

and that any person violating this act shall. be \

deemed guilty of a misdemeanor. It is pro—
posed that this act shall come into eﬁ‘ect' 1m-1?
mediately. Let us suppose it came into eﬁ'ect
to- day. As we write, snow is falling hea ily,
and the cars are running at long intervals, and

people who reside four to six miles from the

7 CRUELTY TO BIPEDS.

'* HAhPER’S WEEKLY. 4

l

L

Mn. BERGH, the President of the Society for 1
the prevention of cruelty to animals, has sub- E

mitted a bill to the New York Legislature to f

prevent the overcrowding of cars and omni-
buses. Whether it is his chief intention to re—

lieve the cruelty to the animals inside or out- 5

side of those carriages is not stated, but the

passage of his humane bill will be of the great- 5

est service to both. Passengers are now packed 1

i

into cars like ﬁsh in barrels. Every body com-

plains, every body suffers, and every fare paid
by a passenger who is not accommodated with

i

l

a seat, is virtually a swindle upon the part of the §
1 Company.

The apology of these Companies is exquisite— _

1y absurd. After‘spending vast sums of men-
ey to secure their charters and cramming their
cars they tell us that they can hardly make the
two ends meet.

at a certain price. If they can not live at the
price, let them raise it; but they have no right
to save the money by withholding the thing.
Yet if they should raise the price, they would
ﬁnd so many quite ready to continue the busi-
ness upon the same terms that the present Com-
panies would probably reconsider. But as there
is plainly no remedy in theCompanies, and as

i the offense increases yearly, we hope sincerely
“ that the Legislature will relieve us. When the

‘reform is once begun, when New York has
‘ shown that it is possible to regulate travel by

street cars and to secure comparative deCency

‘ and comfort, other States will follow. The
? Legislatures must stand between the people and

these vast monopolies or we shall be oppressed
without remedy.

 

FEBRUARY ‘23, 18467.]
A d ORUELTY TO ANIMALS.

i

That is none of the public’s;
business. "The Companies offer a certain thing :

 

THE Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to;
Animals was established by Mr. HENRY BERGH,
of New York, in 1865, having for its purpose the i
prosecution and punishment of all persons guilty
of inhuman treatment of dumb brutes. There.
was great demand for such an association, for
the practice of such cruelties to animals as are de- ?
- picted in the sketch accompanying the portrait of ‘
the President; which we publish this week, was,
and still is, of painful frequency. Cock and dog I
ﬁghts take place almost every night in the low
dens of the metropolis, while every metropolitan :
reader will have noticed the cruel manner ‘in
which car and stage horses are treated by brutal
drivers. One looks at the several pictures which 1

we give, and the question naturally occurs to
his mind, “ \Vhich are the brutes ?”

l
l

HENRY BERGH, President of the ‘Society, is ‘
one of the ﬁrst philanthropists of the country, f

and has made a reputation for himself that will

long endure. ' Mr. BERGH, though still a young

t
i
u

l

j

 
 

 

man, has E geninzthepublic service of the couﬁ' “

try fora nii’inberof 1.35am. ,He'was appointed,
by the late-PreSidentf’L-INCOLN, in 41861, Secre-‘
tary of Legationtto Russia; andacted in; that1
capacity, and as Consull'at St. Petersburg, until
18.64.-. 'Hewasthen compelled to resigninccn:
sequence of hisLill-health and the severity of the
Russian climate. Shortly before his departure
from St. Pétefsburg he was the recipient of a!
high honor frOm the Czar, who, in reply to Mr.
BERGH’s request for permission to visit the fa-
mous fortress of Cronstadt, tendered him the
use of his own royal yacht, a compliment rarely,
if ever before, paid to a private citizen. ‘
On his return to America, in 1865, Mr. BERGH
organized and obtained the charter of the Asso-
ciation which he now heads. This Society has'9
made great headway, and is all the While makingi
more, as is proved by the constant arrests and
convictions—only about half of which, for somel
reason, are reported by the employés of the press. \
The measures thus far put in operation at the]
instance of Mr. BERGH have been of most mam—g
fest advantage in the punishment of those gulltyi
of cruelty to animals; and if the measures
urged by him upon the Legislature are adopted, ‘,
and more stringent laws for the protection of
dumb animals are promptly passed, we may look]
to an early millennium for the brute creation.

President of the y‘Society for} the Preventionot
Cruelty to Animals, appeared before Justice‘i
Cornwall to prefer a charge againstone Morris

Phelan, a cow-keeper, residing on j'Franklin. -

3 street, near Flushing avenue, to ti)!” effect that,
i said Morris Phelan did unlawfully, cruelly, and
inhumanly torture a large number of cows by:
keepingthem conﬁned in a stable without proper
ventilation, and in such manner as to cause dis-
ease and death among them. a ' a

Mr. Bergh’s evidence was ‘in substance asjol-l
lows: On the 23d of February, in camp-any with
one of the detectives of the Society and .a
policeman, he visited the premises of the de-
iendant and made an inspection. Owing to
thex premises being 'very dark and very
close he could only see the cows that

were . near the door, but there
long lines and rows of cows extending into the

, darkness. Though it was the middle 01 the day, .

Mr. Bergh could only see rib-outﬁthirty feet into,
the stable. The cows near the door were fasten-

ed by ehains round their necks, these chains

being: attached to an iron bar ﬁxed in an upright‘
position against the partition which divided the}
cows. The cows were chained so as to leave.
only about six inches 0i space for the animals tel
move in. There was a space oi about tour leet

where they fed. On viewing the premises from

the outside, he saw that a low building of brick
was erected in the yard, one side of which trbntr
ed on the street or avenue. The building was
about one hundred feet long, and nearly square,
having ‘ no ventilation ' except through; the
door. The place . was very ﬁlthyri‘and

‘ the atmosphere in the building hot, ioetid, and,
heavy. Previous to making this inspection, wit-

‘ ness had seen defendant, who admitted to being
the owner of the cows and premises. On Mr.
Bergh asking how long the cows had been kept
in that position, defendant seemed some-what,
uncertain, but saidthat they. had been thus con-
ﬁned some ﬁve, six, or seven months.

’ Mr. Bergh said that he had for several yearsi

contemplated the subject of, cruelty to animals, .

and that his observation had been very extensivef?i

In reply to a question as to what eﬁect is pro-y,

duecd on these animals by the absence at light z.

and heat, he said that it diseased the body, and, 1

consequently, the milk. . . ’ 4

On being cross—examined he said that his in-
vestigation in regard to the treatment of animals
had been conﬁned to cows Kept in stables—it had
been general; and his conclusions were not de
rived from any previous Observation: in the
present case he observed that there were tria~__
don s in the stable, but they were an closed.
though the day was not cold ‘; he saw no venti—
later in the root of the bedding“. nor whethcrthe.
barn was connected with thesewer; he saw nqhay—
mow ; he did not see ev1denee 0! disease in the
cows, because he did not examine with reference

to that point. ~ .

A. F. Mudie,’_ .cticing physician, said- that he.
had heard the testimony in the case ;, that the
effect oi the chaining 0f the cows, and preven.
tion 01 exercise, would prevent the crrculation
oi the blood, and the absence of ventilation
would prevent the reception of oxygen from
the. air. rendering the cows liable to diseases

which tend to ulceration, and which, if con?
tinned, would" result in death; the ettec-t upan -
the nerves of the animals would: be very pain-
fulg. the speciﬁc result would be disease ot

‘the lungs; the rotting oi the hoof would

be another. form of ulceration; the ab-
sence 01 light woulchbc the same as the
absence 01 heat, which is one of the essential

, 5 elements of health; his practice had been con-

}ﬁned‘ to diseases oi man, and his observation as
to diseases of animals had been as to general
1 principles; darkness, with ventilation, would.
produce'blindness, and deteriorate an animal ;'
it'ne, door of a barn would not bea sufﬁcient
lmeans of ventilation for a stable containing. a
* large number or animals. . ~ '
E William S. Southwick, ot 826Broadway, was
next sworn, and his evidence fully corroborated
that of Mr. Bergh. ..
, ’Ihe lurther hearing of the case was postponed
1 until Thursday next, when the case oi Rogers
‘ wﬂLa‘zlse be taken up.

A Damsmc ‘Pasrma. e—One phase of the1
undercurrent of life' in large cities and their'1
environs, which will doubtless be a revela-

1 tion to many staid and respectable folk, is
1 reported' in our local columns this morning.
"*3 refer to a cock-ﬁght which occurred yes- i

terday at ﬁnion ﬁill, N J11 131%: the presencei

of a large number of the “ spur- ing frater-
nity. ” It seems that our vigilant Police and‘
the aigus—eyed agents oi Mr. BERGH have 1
made the barbarous pastime dangerous on
this side of the river, and it has found a more
congenial locale in New—Jeisey, where it is
prosecuted without any attempt at secrecy, 1
and occasionally is graced by the presence of
the peace—ofﬁcers of the cennty. -We are

aware that many persons consider cock-ﬁght-a
ing as an amusement in itself harmless, if}
not productive of positive good, by improv-
ing the breed of the noble fowl whose
clarion n. teas the synonym of early morning,
and" is ass‘ ’ ted with the most. pleasing fea-
tures of rustic life. But this is a specious
fallacy. These birds are pitted against each
other, and the contests are waged for the sole
purpose of betting on the result. There is1
not the poor excuse of excitement in the ﬁght 1
per 36. It lacks the element of chivalry which 1
characterizes the Spirited encdunter of '1two

rival birds' in a barn-yard for the dominance 1
of a harem and the possession of a dunghill

The victory depends not upon the game quali-
ties of the cock, but entirely upon the for-11
tuitous thrust of a sharp steel spur into a vital
part. The whole proceeding is brutalizing in1

1' really seems as if the men to whom are en— 1
:trusted the management of our horses had
been maddened with some strange distemper,

whose most violent outbreak needed only the

» stumble or fall of an animal. A generous, ‘
hard-working horse, with an immense load at
his back, pgnts’ and struggles along the slip-

pery way—made nervous by the idiot who
jerks his reins, frightened by the shouting and
summing of other idiots, disheartened by the

apparent vanity of his eﬂ‘ort-é-sfidéenly 5111138;
stumbles, and falls heavily to the ground.
Of course he is frightened. The driver at

gets down and pulls at his head; after a little

he kicks him in the stomach, and' in his rage

" fand discomﬁture pulls his tail, hauls at his

mane, runs the bit far to one side, and so en-
tirely demoralizes the poor horse that he' is
utterly distracte‘sd , ._ We met an em inent' 1n-

Tstancebf this kind of management yesterday

afternoon, opposite the Metropolitan Hotel.
A huge sled, heavily laden with bags
of feed or grain, was being drawn ,
up the Stieet, when it came to the “ Brooks’
Budge ” of bare stones, and there the pant- 1
ing,‘ sweating team gave out. The driver
shouted and swore, raged and tom, whipped
and yanked, but to no good purpose, for the 2
willing horses were literally good for nothing. ‘
Their head and heart and legs were gone. ;
After ﬁfteen minutes of useless inhumanity,
the driver dismounted, and using the butt end
of his heavy whip, again and again belabored
the horses. He kicked andepulled and goaded
them, with the normal result. Presently a
gentleman stepped from the crowd, took the
head of the trembling horse in his "hand,

, smoothed and patted him,and ﬁnally succeeded

1 in partially undoing the great folly of the dri-
1 ver. After a little, by the assistance of others,
1' the sled was got off the pavement and the

horses started along. It is quite time that.
some remedy'was enforced against these £61.;

humanity by their brutality. We need a race1

. CRUELTY T0 ANIMALS: ALSO T0 WIVES AND
CHILDREN.
, It is right that maltreated dumb creatures
should have their wrongs avenged, and the so-
. ciety organized for the purpose of protecting
. them and bringing their tormentors to grief, de-
serves the countenance and encouragement ofthe
‘ public. The man who wantonly'misuses a horse,
or a dog, or any other animal, is primajacie a
brute, and should be punished for his brutality.
. But when it comes to depriving the anaconda of 1
his dinner of live Spring chicken, or rabbit, we
hardly know what to say. Protest .has been
made in London against serving caged reptiles
_ of the constrictor species with animated rations,
and the protest has been repeated here; but it
should be considered that if not allowed. to
, , butcher for themselves, they decline as pers1st—
,, 1": ently as if they Were strait-laced Hebrews, to eat
meat at all. Moreover, it is quite certain that

 

 

» in their native jungle they would have foraged
1 ' 73,".- on live stock. What then can be done? Would
it be right, on the plea of humanity,to reduce

 

, g the menagerie anaconda to the suicidal neces-
sity of swallowing his own blanket in order to

"-- ‘ , save from his chutches the fowl or rabbit which
‘ » is sure to be killed under any circumstances? It '
is a nice case—susceptible of a world of moral

":33 illustration—and we leave its decision to the

eminent philanthropists who have taken it in
hand, feeling assured that equal and exact lus-

tice will be done to both sides, and not caring

particularly which whips. .
Perhaps it would not be amiss to suggest 1n

 

{I‘d-*5; this connexion, that the Society for the’ Preven-

tion of Cruelty to Animals should extend the
sphere of its labors so as to include a few classes
of ill-used bipeds—such as children who are
mercilessly whipped and starved by their brutal
parents; poor sewing girls who are swindled
’2 out of their hard earnings by soulless employ-
ers; broken-spirited wives who are habitually
'cuﬁ’ed and kicked by drunken husbands, and the
., like. Nobody interferes to prevent such cruel-

.. , . ties as these ; and except in a few ﬂagrant cases
' z that _ force themselves upon the attention of the E
.13.,19 authorities, they are perpetrated with entire im- ‘
punity. We submit that a cudgelled woman, or
. a ﬂayed and starved child, or a seamstress swin-
cfgi’,’ dled out of her daily bread, deserves commiscr—
ation as much as a horse with a sore back, or a

‘ Mr. Bergh has caused tobe published the?

Ling the last week of its session. The provi ‘
~- sions ' are comprehensive and stringent} -
‘ enough to prevent cruelty to animals so'fari,
j as legislation Can prevent it. They declare a:
9guilty of a misdemeanor any person who;
shall overdrive, overload, torture, beat, mu—
i tilate, or deprive of proper sustenance, any
i animal ; who shall keep, use, or be in any
‘ way connected with, any place kept or used
l for ﬁghting or baiting any animal; who;
‘3 shall impound any animal and neglect-do
furnish it proper sustenance, or shall carry
} any animal in a cruel manner, or shall aban-
don it when sick or disabled. If any animal
i is impounded without proper sustenance for
; more than twelve successive hours, any per- ,
‘Tson may supply food as needed at the cost
\ of the owner. Persons using dogs for
}. drawing or helping to draw carts must take.
jout a license therefor. Any agent of Mr.
; Bergh’s society, upon being designated there—
ito by the sheriff of any county may arrest
[persons violating the act. in such county,
land all ﬁnes shall go to the society, fr theo
lfurtherance of its purposes. g" The act is to

to nothing else than vivisection, must
have been inserted against Mr. Bergh’s

ithat his is not the ﬁrst good cause which has

have no occasion to speak of him otherwise

“I visthos a, haiiimal,”ssys apeor out-

cast in the play, “ I’d git took care of.” Doubt-
dess, a number of our maimed and destitute

 

 

 

tenement houses, entertain a similar aspira-
tion occasionally. Who ever heard of a “ So-
clety for the Prevention of Cruelty to Human
Beings ‘3” Who believes such a societv could
collect money enough to pay for its advertis—
zang? : But not so with our pet inscitution of
Mr. 'Bergh, who is a philanthropist and a scholar
and to whom we wish entire success—Joel; so:
We say, with his “Society for the Prevention oi?
Cruelty to Animals.” \ This noble charity ﬁnds
plenty of backers; God bless ’emlmand ac—
knowledges abundant supplies. And the
nearer human beings approach to the condi—
tionof “animals,” the more sympathy will be
manlfested for them. Witness, your ﬁrst-class
gutter—drunkard, for instance! how Philan-
thropy weeps, and prays, and contributes cash,
and gets up Asylums for him! The dirtierhe

\

\ becomes, and the deeper he wallows in the mire,

mad” ought, by all means, to be encouraged
among our poorer fellow-citizens. In the
meantime, however, until such a millenial

transformation shall take place, we take pleas— ‘

IN BEHALF OF THE ANIBIAL, LIAN.

The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals, at a meeting held on Monday
last, resolved that the directors of street rail-

roads be requested to increase the number

of horses by which their cars are drawn. We
propose as an amendment, that they be re-
quested to decrease the number of passen-
gers that are crowded into the cars. By such

an arrangement an act or kindness will be
.done to the passengers, as Well as to the

horses. ‘We do not think» that ’ all the sym-
pathy should be beetowed"' uponthe brute
creation. Suffering humanity has long ap-
pealed in vain for relief from the cruelties

practiced in those torture dens, in which suf-

focating, squeezed and"jostled mortals are
wheeled up and down our thorough-
, If the companies increase the
number of horses, it will be an excuse
for increasing the number of passengers.
It is useless to argue that that would be
impossible; for where is the conductor that,
under any circumstances, would admit that
his car was full? There is no such men.
Though the passengers be packed like sardines
——though they hang by straps and cling to
the rails of platforms like clusters of swarm-
ing bees—stillthere is always room, in the
conductor’s imagination, for one more. His
motto is that detestable one—the more, the
merrier. If man is an animal—4nd we will
not dispute the theory if it brings us under
the protection of the Society—~41 man is an
animal, we demand that, in these measures for
the prevention of cruelty, he be placed at least
on an equality with the horse. We submit
our amendment to the honorableand bone.
volent Society—not that We love horses less,

but that We love our own genus of. animals 3

Chief J ust1ce- Hale, one of the most prominent Eng-

. towards the human species, neither it should be' 1n-
dulged toward the animal tribes. I ever thought that
there 15 a certain degree of justice due from man to

THE RESULTS or HABITS or CRUELTY.

Habitual cruelty to animals is felt in the family and
in society at large; its consequence is a ferocious and
1 ungovernable temper, ready to exhaust its fury in the
seeial circle. it becomes a second nature, scattering
“is everywhere “ ﬁrebrands, arrows and death.” A cruel
master is likely to be a cruel parent and a dangerous
associate. The torture and killing of animals is often
It the precursor if not the immediate cause of the mur-
der of men. A cruel child is almost certain to be a
hard-hearted and unprincipled man. An eminent:
A writer declares it to be of the ﬁrst importance in the
training of a child that he should be made to feel that
cruelty is a crime.

, A PAGAN JUDGMENT.

tory relates, thought an instance of cruelty in a child

By the same instrumentality the same thing may be ;

accomplished here. Already in the city of New York
a similar- society, oi'which Henry Bergh, Esq, is the
most eﬂicient and laborious presiding ._oiiicer, has

commenced its work. The ﬁrst men in the city, men ,
.oi' the highest character, the largest wealth and the'
greatest inﬂuence, are giving their names and their;
1 money to the Society, who are vigorously enforcing a

reformation in the American London.

Shall not this noble example be fellowed in Buffalo?
Will not our citizens unite to put down an evil which
cries to Heaven, :1. sin which is corrupting their chil-
111 err and demoralizing society. The great poet of
nature has said:

“Sweet mercy is nobility’s t1 ue badge;
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven-—
It is an attribute of God himself. ’7 ‘

Citizens of Buffalo, friends of humanity, lovers of
justice, haters of cruelty and cowardice, will you not
unite in such a work? Will you not come to the res-
cue of the poor dumb servants to whom we owe so
much, remembering the words of our Lord and Sav-
iour: “Blessed are the merciful f'or they shall obtain
mercy.”

At the conclusion of his remarks Dr. Lord announe
ed that Rev. J. Hazard Hartzell would deliver a dis-
. course on the same subject next Sunday evening.

i Cruelty to Animals {— Discourse by
Rev. J- Hazard Hartwell.

       
   
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
  
 
 

Rev. J. Bastard. 1444444434., the eloquent pastor of the
Church. 43f the Messiah, according to previous an-
; houncement, delivered a discourse last evening on the
subject of cruelty to animals, the . number in attend-
ance being quite large. The eﬂ’orts of those who orig—
inated this wholesome reform, aided by the reverend f
clergy, are, we are pleased to know, likely to be 1
crowned with success, and the evil complained of,
~measurablyif not wholly remedied. The discourse i
of_Mr. Hartzell was as follows: ‘ f

I “They shall lay hold on how and spear; they are
cruel and have no mercy.”——Jer. vi: ‘23.

These werds of the Prophet have reference to the
people of the North, who should come in battle array
against the city of David. They were to come on 3»
horses and in elgiariots7 With waving banners, pillag- ;
ing and. destroying, and darkening the earth With the .
deeds of cruelty. They are described by the Prophet
as being cruel and having no mercy; riding, as It
were, on the whirlwind of passion, and leavmg de=
1 struction in their train. But we propose to apply the ,
words of the Prophet not to any people. of the North ‘
who have come, or shall Come from their cold hills In
E battle array, but to those who are cruel to and harm
no mercy upon the inferior animals which feed In the ,
meadows and toil in the streets.
In accordance with the notice given we now . come.
to the discussion of, this subject. It is a subject 01
interest to the humane and intelligent of every commu-
nity. And we are pleased to learn that the people
throughout the country are beginning to manitest
their interest in this subject inthe enactment of laws
for the kindly treatment of the inferior animals. _ And
we are pleased to learn that in several places soc1et1es
are organized for the purpose of seeing that these laws
are executed upon the o 'ender. The humane and re-
ﬁned of every community have felt outraged, times - _
Without number, by the wicked cruelty which has .
been practiced upon those creatures over which God .4
has given man dominion. ‘ ,
. We are not only astonished, but saddened, when we <
behold the prevalence of this cruelty. It is almost
‘ impossible to walk the streets without being stunned
and outraged by an exhibition of this wickedness.
We are pained and shocked almost every week by the ,
. violent treatment of animals. by men who have neither
’Judgment nor feeling. These animals have been cre.
ated to serve humanity and civilization, and no class
ofmen have the right to abuse them. They belongto
. the--history of humanity andto the progress of ClVillZ-
4] ation, and ”they deserve to be treated with kindness. ‘
And those ..who cannot treat them with kindness ;
should never be allowed. to draw the line, put“ on the
l yoke, or to out the ﬂeece. ,4 ~
, . There are many reasons why this cruelty-should not.
be tolerated. one reason is that it hardens the ﬁner
feelings of the offender. Itblunts the edge 0i tender-
ness; blights the openin g ﬂower of mercy, andilmakes.
a man savage in c aracter and disposition. In the
abuse of these uncomplaining creatures man" abuses
his higher nature. The blow he gives to the animal
: comes back with redoubled force upon the uncon-
; serous soul. And this blow breaks the links in the
, chain of reason, and crushes the bud of compaSsion, {
and leaves the heart in an-unfruitt‘ul condition. The E
. deeds of Violence and cruelty tend to strip man of 51 1 :
hlS nobler qualities, and to clothe him. in the hideous ‘
character ot’ a rcmorscless intelligence.
_ Another reason is that the example has a pernicious l
lnﬂuence “9011 the voting. Their natures are plastic,

mercyis one of the leading attributes of the Deity, we
shouldexercise mercy to the worm that crawls at our
feet as well. as to the erring brother who carries upon.
his heart the Divine Image. . ,

,Another reason is that we commit a great wrong
when we abuse the uncomplaining creatures which
have been placed under our authority. We have no
more right toabuse them than we have to abuse those
of our own race and our own blood. Their defenseless
condition, their willing subjugation, and, their obedi-
ent disposion, all-should tend to call out our sympa-
thy, our kindness,'and our mercy. God made them to
serve man in ways. innumerable, and man to serve
Him in the exercise of his noblest faculties and in the
ptactice ol'his highest. principles among the rational
and the irrational. We are forbidden to mistreat the
creatures of an inferior order by the law of Reason,
by the law of Conscience, and by the law of God.

If these reasons are cogent, then the practice of this 3
cruelty should be ended. We have no rightto carry :

this relic of barbarism in the lap of this civilization. .
This cruelty is'a disgrace to this period, and a shame
to our humanity. It indicates more of the brute than
the man; more ’)f the untutored savage than the en-
lightened Christian. It developes the lower passions,
and touches ‘the ﬁner issues of individual progress
with a ﬂame that destroys. It obdurates the nobler
nature and prevents the Sprouting and growrng of

‘ those higher attributes which blossom with the sweet-

est fragrance. The warm light of sympathy and ten—
derness does not fall upon the heart when man is
living in the austere climate of cruelty. When Doctor
Kane toiled on the Arctic Sea no sun warmed his up-
turned face, no flower cheered his longing hear. It
was an austere climate with icebergs moving in s1-
lencc‘ and grandeur, with no dancing of summer

'leaves, and no melody of summer birds.

Man has been mistaken in regard to the inﬂuence
of cruelty. He has supposed that crueltytended to .
restrain andcorrect. But. he has been _mistaken as 2
history fullylshows. Men are not restrainednor cor- ;
rected by means of cruelty. Cruelty does not improve .
It arouses
the spirit of retaliation; it wliets the knife of ven- .
geance; it poisons the arrowof hatred. Therefore we
are Opposed to cruelty in religion, in government and
in the treatment of the inferior animals which God,
has placed in our hands. . . .

Mankind are impressed for good or. for ewl by the ’
customs and practices which they are called tmwit—
ness. In the reign of Henry the Eighth of gangland,
the laws were never more severe and bloody, and; it
is a 'fact that crime in that country was never so rife

l.___..o

and terrible as under the sway of that monarch. No ;

less than seventy-two thousand executions took plage ‘
in that country for robbery alone, with the dripping
of blood and the muttering of despair, and yet 80016.th

was not protected nor elevated; man was ’notjre-‘--

strained nor reformed by this reign of cruelty. : When

Louis the Sixteenth of France ‘was executed, the reign v

of terror commenced, and held an awful sway in that :
turbulent land. The guillotine drank the blood of ',
unnumbered thousands, while the pleading of mercy
fell upon ears tli‘atw’hredeaf and upon hearts that
were cruel. Under this reign of cruelty no sublime ;
virturewvas deVeloped; normajestic character was un— ‘-
folded; none of those moral; triumphs which some-
times illuminate aperiod were achieved. Man was
not restrained; the vices andabuses- of the age were

i not corrected; though Danton with his superior

once of cruelt

ability and Mimbeau with his matchless pewer and
rugged eloquence, thundering; and ﬂaming, strove to ‘
arrest Passion, and evolve harmony out of chaos
Even the youth of that country instead ohhecoming
fearful of the guillotine, introuuced it into ﬂam- plays
and guilloﬁned domestic animals in the mace of ﬁlm-

ian' beings. Their natures were steeled against
mercy and tenderness, and the introductioninf the

ness of man. Vicious horses, for instance, are often}
made so by the cruelty of vicious drivers, who know ,
no more about the nature and disposition of these no- .
b1?) 1 animals, than a Hindoo does about the Atlantic
ca e. . .

Mercy, as before remarked, is one of the prominent l
attributes of Deity. Wherever it is exhibited it
tOuclies the heart and expands ihe soul. It calls into
exercise gratitude and». veneration, and touches the
spring of reform in character. It is the warm light

~ which steals over the heart, charged with q‘uickening

power and expansive energy. It calls into bloom the
higher principles and the nobler virtues, and under

We all need more kindness in our disposition and
our treatment of those who ,may have follies and ;
weaknesses; who may be living and grappling under i

, compassion of God.

And this mercy, which we exercise towards man. we
should exercise towards the inferior animals. They ‘
are susceptible of improvement in disposition andw
habit, like man, by the ministry of kindness. They l
can be made gentle and obedient by primer treatment, l,
and this they deserve Kindness-has that gentle in-
ﬂuence over them which it has over man, and it brings
out their better qualities. And man has shown us
that the horse, however vicious and ugly, can be made
kind and gentie by humane treatment. And in this
way he has shown us that the dog may be taught to
perform almost any duty as a hunter, a servant or a
sentinel. And, in consideration of the kindly results
of this humane treatment of the inferior animals, it
is our duty to urge it, and see that men put it into
practice. Whittier has written a poem on Piero Luca,
the Brother of Mercy, who was so ﬁlled with the spirit

and his religion was one of mercy, but he was visited

Bergh and Barnum.

As the subject of cruelty to animals is under-
going a spirited discussion at present, we print
elsewhere a Spicy correspondence, between
President Bergh and P. T. Barnum, relating
thereto. It strikes us that the showman has
rather the best of the argument. Mr. Bergh
seems to have been led into excesses of langu-
age, and an untenable position, by his overﬂow-
ing sympathies. Nevertheless, he appears in
the correSpondence more creditably, as a man,

than Barnum. The letters will be found very,
entertaining. They are able on both sidespand

Cruelty to Animals—Meeting of Cit.
Hens—Formation of a Society.

 

Deepiterthe very disagreeable weather last night,
the general interest felt in the object of this meeting
brought together a suﬁicientlylarge number of per-

, sons to proceed with the business in hand. The
1 meeting was called to order by Hon. Wm. Ketchum,
upon whose motion the Hon. Millard Fillmore was
called to the chair, and upon motion of Jason Sexton,
Esq., Thomas Kean and W. R. Scott were appointed
Secretaries.

Mr. Fillmore said that the object of the meeting
was known and understood by all present. No man
could walk the streets of our city without having his
feelings outraged; and there could be no difference of
Opinion among humane men as to what should be
done. Mr. Fillmore thought that in the generality of ‘
instances the cruelty exercised toward animals was .
not so much the outbreaking of malice as of anger.
After further remarks of a similar nature

Rev. Dr. Lord said that Major Lanccy, of the New
York Society, was expected to address the meeting,
but was probably detained on the railroads. He
thought that societies organized outside of New York
city, would be auxiliaries, and would be beneﬁttcd

In London the societies had actually put a stop to ,

cruelty to animals. Diivers of horses, and others‘ in
i charge of animals, knew they were watched although
they could not tell by whom.

Afte1 a little a1 gumentation upon the nature of the
law 111001 porating the New Yo1k Society, the chair
announced the following .

Silas Kingsley, Esq, next made some appropriate .

remarks upon, and gave a synopsis of his ~ observa-
tions of cruelty to animals. '
Mr. Ketchum followed with reminiscences of his

3 experience of cruelty to animals during the period

when he was Mayor of the city The enforcement of
the laws against cruelty to animals must be popular
ized before they would become eﬁicient.

Geo. J. Bryan spoke brieﬂy of the value of such an

organization as was Spoken of, and thought there was

a wide ﬁeld for its Operations in this city.

Hereupon Major Lancey arrived, and, being intro-
duced to the meeting, gave a concise history of the
ope1ations of the New York Society. Maj01 L had
held a conve1sation with Superintendent oftPolice
Reynolds, of this city, and was satisﬁed that the S11-
perintendent would do all in his power to p1 omo

1 the cause of the Society in Buﬁalo. In 1egard to my 1- .

section, the speaker said a wrong impiession had
gone abroad; the Society had no desire to interfere

with the legitimate and proper Operations in this‘

Dr. L01d moved that when the meeting adjomn it
adjourn for one week; and upon motion of Mr. Ketch-

' The cemmittee appointed at the last meeting to se-

' rto 1eport, Dr. Lord offered the following resolution:

Resolved, That this society intend that its platiorm
shall be broad enough to secme the co- operation of all
the f1iends of humanity. irrespective of profession or
creed, and that its single object is to create a public
sentiment jg favor of the prompt execution of the
laws and 0t erwise to aid the police in the enter-cc

' ment of the act of the Legislature 01 the State for 11113

, p1evention of cruelty to animals

132.1 Lord spoke brieﬂy but forcibly in relation to a
article 111nm recently appear ed in the Buﬂ'alp Medical,
and Sat: gical Journal, on the subject of cruelty to ani-
male and in defence of the cﬁ'or ts of these engaged _"

. to necessmy scientiﬁc investigation. He denihd the

of Buffalo 0: the clergy had engaged in an anti surgica
crusade, at the instance of Mr. Bergh, of New York,
or that they weie put up to this movement by any out- i

, side inﬂuence.

In refutation of another portion of the article in the
Journal, to the effect that cruelty towards animals did?
Lo1d related an instance

which occurred in the city within the last few days,
1where a man but It a the under his horse and burnt
5 his ﬂesh, not because the animal was halky, but be-
cause he was unable‘to draw the load fro at a mud

to speak in a; spirit of unkindncss of the article in the}
Jam no ~,-Z but he regretted that it had been published,

Dr. Lord was folloWed by Reﬁ .'Hazard Hartzcll,

kind contemplated was necessary in this place. We ' _
had laws against cruelty to animals, but they were; . . ' »
not executed. When in Naples he inquired why itl- ; “

was that men were arrested and incarcerated without

the forms of law, and learned; from a gentlemani 2'":

speaking his own language, that the laws did not
diﬂ‘er mateiially from those of Great B1itain, although
timl by jury was not tolerated and testimony was
taken in w1iting; but the laWs protecting the person
were not enforced. The law was ample but was not ,
'1' xecuted; and so with 1e-"e1ence to that in relation to ‘
cruelty to animals. He referred to the workings of
thehnmane society in London, and said that reform
in London had accomplished a great good: In Italy
.he found the people gentle and kind to the inferim j
animals, but in Spain the most terrible cruelties were

‘practiced; and the e he regmded as the legitimate,‘

outgrowth of the bull ﬁghts. Speaking of .the. ques- ;

Lion of vivisection he said if it was necessary for
physiological purp‘oses W e must submit—but it was r 7

nevertheless horrible. The piecess ‘of entting up a‘

hersenlive, commencing at his extremities, and dis- . -

secting him to pieces, he could not 1"ega1d with any» {
thing but a feeling of horr01 , but if he were satisﬁed
01‘ its absolute necessity he, personally, might submit
to it with a‘better gr.ace _
The 1esolution p1 eviously oil'ered by Dr. Lord we.
unanimously adopted, after which Eon. William
Ketchum made a partial report, in which he stated
that Mr. Silas Kingsley had been named as President;
that twenty Vice Presidents had been selected, con—

sisting of the Hon. Millard Fillmore, Mayor Wells, ‘;

the ex- \Iayp 's of Bnii'alo, now in the city, and other i

gentlemen; that an Exe utive Committee of twenty

was also appointed headed by Bon. Orlando Allen,

Dr. Lordxmovcd that the report be referred back to
the Committee with instructions to report in full at

It was moved and carried that when the meeting

One of the Secretaries read a letter from the
Hon. Orlando Allen to the Chairman, the Hon.
Millard Fillmore, in which he stated his inabil‘
ity to be present at the meeting on account of
ill health; that he cordially appoved of the
plan, and that it would afford him much pleas-
ure to cooperate with his fellow citizens in
carrying out the objects of the organizatid‘h.
The Rev. Dr. Lord moved that the Executive l
Committee'be authorized to appoint a commit-
tee of three to canvass the city, for the purpose,
of obtaining subscriptions and memberships.

 

 

 

In reference to the terms of membership, as
set forth in Chap. IV. of the By—Laws submit-

tained love in equal degree for a numerous fam- ,
ily of children and grand-children. He thought - .
it possible that the heart of tthe-editor of the ‘
Alli-ectzte might expand if he interested him'
self in more numerous objects. We might sug-
gest on our own account, that this matter 01“
growth presupposes a something, having capa_
city for growth, and if a man hasn’t the ﬁrst
healthy germ of nobility in his soul,his prospect
ofultimately becoming a gentleman a human-
itarian or a Christian, must be considered very
remote. ' ‘
Mr. Fillmore remarked facetiously that he‘
was not in the habit of omitting any duty :
whatever the papers might say. He referred}
to the ﬁrst letter he had received from Mr. ,1 '
Bergh, some time ago in relation to the forma- i
tion of a branch society in Buii'alo; and spoke l
of the reluctance with which both himself and .
the President of the society identiﬁed them-
selves with the movement, although fully ap-
preciating its importance. But there is a lady

 

 

 

 

' combined;

present, he said, who has done more towards
establishing the organization than all the others
and could the dumb animals
appreciate the energy with which she ‘
has worked, and the great sacriﬁces she
‘ has made, they would thank her I
with one accord,-——that lady is Mrs. Dr. Lord; i
and the time will come when the cityof, Buffalo
will be proud of the Society which owes its e};-
istence to her efforts.

The meeting, we should have mentioned, was
largely attended, notwithstanding the disagree-
able weather. It adjourned subject to the call
of the Executive Committee.

, The organizatiOn for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals

Our remarks in our last issue, in regard to
the above organization, seem to have somewhat
Eruﬁed the feeling. of those connected with it.

The editor of The Advocate was pronounced
“a pagan. ” a “barbarian”, as "actuated by a
spirit of malignity,” mo.

It strikes no that these were strange conclu—
sions for Christian men to. draw, simply from
the fact, that we thought that the distress,
among mankind, ought to take precedence of

we represented the fermer as actuated by an— ,

 

 

E‘Epaganism’ or ‘barbarism’ is simply absurd.

Pagans and barbarians are not in the habit of:

. Now we would not "have it understood for E
i one moment that we are opposed to the objects A
E of this organization. And nothing in our ar-
' ticle can be tortured into any such construction.
It was srmply a question as to priority of claim
E or relative importance We had come in fresh
E from a survey of scenes of wr etchedness among
Ethc poor and the lowly, and were thinking 0 f
E the slender means employed for lifting these
people out oi the dust, and ntaying the tide of
E vice and corruption in our midst. , it occurred ,
E to us that while some other cities had a home
E for the friendlesa, Bhﬁhlo had none; that while E,
in other places there existed organizations forEz
the rescue of the fallen and"thcir return to vir- E
tue, there was none in . this city; that ,while

Haring taken this View of matters, it seemed
a pity that so imposing an, organization, gotten
up by clergymen, the ﬁrst in the city whose. E
immodmto object was to prevent suffering
should be devoted to the happmess of the low-

and lanes of the city, there was going up such
a wail of diatreesx And we think that those
gentlemen aft or making a survey of the city
would come to acrmilar conclumon. At any
rate coming from the bedside of the tarnishing

Fight between an Elephant and a Rat.
A very extraordinary encounter between a rat and

elephant took place recently in a menagerie at Memphis, ‘
Tenn. The keepers were engaged in destro oying a great ‘

number of rats, when one of them escaped and ran to
the spot allotted to the elephant. Seeing no other
refuge, in the twinkling of an eye the rat snugly en-

sconced himself in the trunk of the elephant, very much -
to the elephant’s dissatisfaction. He stamped his foot ’ .
and twisted his trunk round like the seal of a w1ndmill. .

After these evolutions he stood suddenly still, evidently
reﬂecting on what was best to do. Then turning to
the trough where he is accustomed to drink, he plunged

‘ his trunk into the water, then raising his trunk, with j

the water he had absorbed, he dashed out the unfortu-
nate rat, which was in a sheet of water like that issuing
from a ﬁre engine. When the rat fell to the ground the

elephant seized him and made him undergo the immer- ,

sion and projection four times. At the fourth throw it
fell dead. The elephant, with a majestic air, but cool
and placid, crushed his annoying little enemy with his
foot, and then went on receicing his usual oﬁ'erings of

sugar and other dainties. The victory was received .

‘ with vociferous applause by those looking on, which
F: the elephant seemed fully to understand and ap-
1 preciate.

Near one of the grain warehouses, situated on the
river bank, in Milwaukie, Wis, large swarms of rats
have been in the habit of feasting on the wheat which
ihas been scattered around. Afew days since a black

‘1‘and tan terrier. getting.r wind of the rendezvous. made

an attack upon a couple of rats that had ventured too
ffar into the open air. Seizing one in its teeth, it shook
;it vigorously. The rat squealed piteously, attracting to
the spot a dozen or more companions. These, on
{seeing the ,situation of affairs, joined in raising the
‘alarm. In less time than it takes us to tell the incident,
the ice around was black with a swarm of rats, number-
ing several hundreds. The terrier, after dispatch-
;ing the ﬁrst victim, charged into the swarm with the

, éevident determination of serving the remainder in like.

manner. But for once a terrier was doomed to meet‘
with ﬁght from the poor animals he had so long
devoured at pleasure, and in a trice he was surrOunded
1on all sides by a swarm of ferocious brutes, anxious to

:ensued the most frightful scene imaginable. The rats}
,starmed around their adversary, and fastened their
claws and teeth in his ﬂesh. The dog, enraged by the

pain, fought bravely, killing scores of his enemies in
his contest for life. But the odds against him were too
great, and, after a sharp conﬂict, which lasted for about
ﬁve minutes, he was forced to suécumb. His body was ,
1literally devoured by the rats, they seeming to take a
‘savage pleasure in tearing their vanquished enemy

"piecemeal. Scarcely a vestige of the animal remained

behind. The terrier died game, however, for there
were about a half hundred rats left upon the ﬁeld,
bleeding and mangled, and as many more, n101e or less

In theearly part of the month of August last, a girl
named Eliza. Drummond, about eleven years of age,
whose parents live near the town of West Monroe, N. Y.,
left or home one morning for the purpose of picking
berries, and never returned. The most diligent search
Was made for her by the parents and neighbors, but no,
traces could be found. The event, which created a pro-,-
h found sensation at the time, had almost passed from the“:

  
  
 
 
 
 
  
  
    
  
  
   
 
 
  
 
  

minds ofall save the stricken parents. » . ,
One day five or six lads went out hunting in the vicin-
ity, and during the day came upon a spot where a large
number of blaCk snakes were discovered and killed.
1e appearance of the reptiles in. such numbers and at
this season of the year, was considered remarkable, and
it was suggested by one of the party that a breeding den
must be somewhere near. A search \ *as immediately
commenced which resulted in a manner far different from
their expectations. ‘
In the side ot‘a little hill near the edge of a swamp was
, founzl'a sort of opening, which, in the summer, was con—
-.;_cmled by tall grass and bushes. In this opening was
found a human skeleton, from which every particle of
z -, ﬂesh had been taken. The bones were as white as ivory

,.‘ dition, and a tin cup. The boys were terribly frightened

mouth of the den, and an examination showed that the
place had been, and probably now was, a breeding place

entrance, which was large enough for the admission ot‘a
man’s body, grew smaller and tended dowm rard. Light-
ed balls of hay soaked in kerosene were thrown into the
leavity. and in less than fifteen minutes 82 snakes, rang—
‘ing in length from 1 1-2 to four feet, were killed;

War to the Death.

A family in Danbury, Connecticut, recently lost a
favorite cat, and found her a few days afterward ina
vacant neighboring lot, wrapped up in the coils of a
snake. They were both dead, the cat from the pressure
of the snake’s folds, and the snake from the bites of the
cat. The contest, it seemed, had been a. very severe
one, judging from the marks of scratches in the vicinity
of the spot where the antagonists were found.

Attacked by a. Muskrat.

Recently in Baltimore, about nine o’clock in the even~
ing, as Mr. Michael Welch was.‘passing through West
Baltimore street, when near the corner of N ahant street,
he noticed a small animal crossing the street and com-
ing toward him. As it“ came up” to him, the creature
sprang ﬁercely at his legs and tried to bite him. By
the light of a street lamp Mr. Wale“ saw that it was a
good-sized muskrat, which repeated its attacks several
times, leaping up and at him very savagely. Mr. Welch
was obliged to defend himself, and struck the creature
with a tin pail which he had in his hand, and ﬁnally
killed it. How the muskrat came to be in such a place,
and what could have induced it to attack a man under
such circumstances, is certainly a mystery. We never
heard of an occurrence hke it before.

TherrGocat and the lilirrorr

0
A few days since, says the Indi napolis Herald, of
July 24th, a family had occasion to move to South Mis-
sissippi street. The direct line of travel from the oldgtoi

l the new house was through Louisiana street, past thel

. stable of the Street Railway Company. The lady had a

‘ large mirror which she concluded to carry in her hands,‘
to insure against accidents. Just opposite the stables“
before mentioned, something in the street attracted her 2‘
attention, and she stopped to look at it, resting one end {
of the mirror on the curb stone. A small goat of the‘
male persuasion loafs around the stables, wasting his }

, sweetness on the surrounding neighborhood, and having '
-. erocious combats with dogs, hogs, and small boys. VVil— l
liam was daintily nibbling at a bundle of hay in the door- f

‘ way of the stable, when, to his amazement, he saw what;
he took to be another goat, saiicily shaking his horns at 1
him. No one ever doubted Billy’s courage, though his‘

‘ discretion had been repeatedly called in question. Con— l

l sidering it a challenge, he gathered himself on his feet, “

l and emitting a sharp, savage m~a-a, he sprang into the

3 air as it"shot from a' catapult, and dashed, head, horns,

‘ body and tail, through the mirror. There was a i’rig t- ,
ened scream, mingled with the sound of shivered glass, l
and the woman stood amid the wreck of her pet look-
ing-glass. But Billy’s blood was up. A s she stooped to E

‘ save the pieces, he “bucked” her over, and repeated the j

THE GOAT AND THE MIRROR.

Operation as often as she tried to get up, until some of
the stable men took him off. _

The next day the outraged and insulted woman called ‘
on Harry Catherwood, representing what his “nasty .
goat” had done, and demanded $3 in payment of the
damages to self and property. Harry promised to in—
quire into it, and if he found the goat was to blame he
would settle up. Finally the matter was compromised
by his taking the mirror frame and agreeing to get a
new glass put in it. In the meantime, Capricorn is un-
der a cloud, and goes sheepishly around, with a pine
board across his horns. No more butting from him.

An Enraged ‘01 on the Rampage.

1 An intense excitement was created in thesouthern",

“ section of St. Louis a few day ssince, by a steer running ,

; off from a drove, which was, being driven to the ;

‘; shambles. The enraged animal dashed through severa
streets, knocking down and injuring several persons in
his progress. A mute boy was tossed byithe animal
and badly bruised, and Mrs. Tully, aged forty, who
resides at Sixteenth and Federal streets, was badly in-

‘ jured about the head. At another point, the driver of a
team attached to a. car saw the animal dashing up the
street, and went to the protection of his-horses. As
the animal reached the lead horse the driver struck.
at him with his whip, and was gored under the left
arm, inﬂicting a severe wound. A number of persons

‘threw coal at the steer from the cars, but this only

‘ tended to make him more furious, and he dashed along

‘ until he reached Broad street, above Catharine, where a

a member of the Harmony Fire Company shot it, and it
fell dead in the street. Mrs. Tully was then placed in

' the ambulance of the company and taken to the hos-
pital, and the driver of the car-team had his wound”
dressed and went hOme in a passenger-car. It is a

' A Thriiiing Woi’f Story. ,
The following story cOmes to us from Compton, a1 a
little town in the wilds of Upper Canada. A resident of . t
that place, Mr. Roberts, was, last autumn, engaged in
1 felling trees at some distance from the house. His
little son,'cight years old, was sin the habit, while his ‘
" mother was busy with householdvcares, of running out ‘2
i into the ﬁelds and woods afound'the house, and often ‘
i going where his father was at work. One day, after the
i frost had 1 obbed the trees of their foliage, he left his
3 work rather sooner than usual, and started home. Just
"on the edge of the forest he saw a curious pile of leaves, ‘
and stopping to think what had made it, he cautiously ‘

A THRILLING WOLF STORY. 1, J,
" removed the leaves, when what was his astonishment i
‘to ﬁnd his own darling there asleep, ’TWas but the ‘
i work of a moment to take up the sleeper, put in his ;’ '
j place a log of wood, carefully replace the leaves, and l
: conceal himself among the bushes to watch the result. ‘
1 After waiting there a short time, he heard the wolf’s
‘1 distant how], quickly followed by others, till the woods ' .
lseemed alive with fearful sounds. The howl camel \ M
inearer, and in a few minutes a large, gaunt, savage- ‘
1 looking wolf, leaped into the opening, closely followed 1 .
j by the whole pack. The leader sprang directly on the
‘1‘ pile of leaves, and in an instant scattered them in every ﬂ
‘direction. As soon as he saw the’deception, his look of
i’ﬁerceness and conﬁdence changed to abject‘fear. He‘
' shrank back, cowered to the ground, and passively
:waited his fate, for the rest, enraged by the supposed
‘cheat, fell upon him, tore him to pieces, and devoured
‘him on the spot. When they had ﬁnished their com-
rade, they wheeled around, plunged into the forest, and
disappeared; within ten minutes of their ﬁrst appear-
ance, not a wolf was to be seen. The bov. after playing,
till he was weary, had laid down and fallen asleep, and ,
in that situation the wolf had found him, and covered
, him with leaves, until he could Bring his comrades to

United States and other partsof America.

. The breeding cock should be selected from a strain which has i
3' generally, if not always, gained the odd battle, when equally:
9‘ matched; be also thoroughly convinced that he is quite sound ;
' where, should he eat corn 5

  
  

he eats but little, and has besides a bad digestion. “
To be still more sure, try also by running him down in a ﬁeld, .

' and sparring with another cock, at either of which, if he .is un- l

l sound, he will turn black in the face. Try the hens 1n like ;

l The cock ought to have a long, thin head, or very taper, If,

.' ' short; full large eyes, stout crooked beak, thick long neck, short;
' compact body, round breast, ﬁrm stout thighs, well placed up to,
the shoulders, long strong legs, and if they agree in color With /

the beak it is reckoned a perfection; broad thin feet, and very
long claws; a stately walk, and an upright easy carriage, theE
wings not lying close on his back, but rather eatended. _ .
A cock possessed of the preceding qualiﬁcations, in condition
‘ 0 ﬁght, ought not to weigh more thanv 4113. 100z., for when .
above that weight, and the hens ofa good Size,

with cocks that are true bred. The hens should cOrrespond to g
the cock in feather, shape and make, with bodies sufﬁciently
roomy behind for the production of large eggs.

The breeding walk should be where there are outbouses for
shelter in bad weather, on a dry soil, all the better if gravelly, f 4 g
at a distance from any house where fowls are kept, lest the hens 3;, ,
should be trod by other cocks; and, if possible, where there is a i“ ‘
f constant rill of clear water running near the house, as all foul
“ water, especially soap suds, causes the roop, a fatal disease that ,

never can be thoroughly cured.

In February, put the cock and not more than three or four
hens together, and let them be sisters, if posSible, for greater,
certainty in breeding. Before the hens begin laying, prOVide ‘
dis ’inct and separate nests for them, else theywﬂl be apt to J

' The ﬁrst egg being usually smaller than the others, mark and

are laid, write on and put them in a box With bran. When the '

f hen begins to grow broody, put the eggs laid by in the nest, as

‘ mt st likely to produce good chickens. Plenty of food and water ;

should always be near the setting hens, and if they are in a
ﬂoored place, lay a quantity of gravel upon it. Those chickens
are of little value that are hatched later than May; and those
hatched before the end of March are often cramped bycold;

: such as are later than the beginning of June never run cocks so a

is they cannot get insects, let them have some raw bones of beef ‘

three times a day with as much as they can eat. After the hens .

are removed, put the brood cock along With the cock chickens,

THE Pm: IN CHICAGO.—A doglastic bone of contention was de-
cided on March 6th between Bill Gardner alias “Comosover Bill,”
the keeper of the well known sporting “drum” at 175 West J ack-
son st., owner of the celebrated imported dog, Sport, against
James Rowan’s dog, Mae, of Milwaukee, at catch weight, for $250

‘ a side, Ben Sabine doing the needful for Rowan and his dog. The
match was made at Comosovor Bill’s and fought at J em McCaw-
ley’s pit on North Clark st. Dick Leary, the formidable antago-

nist of Jerry Donovan, Dutch Frank, Roger Plant, Geo. Eager
and a host of the fraternity that like the sports of the pit were
present. The judges and referee being chosen, lamps being lit,

. Ben Sabins with Mac and Comos with Sport entered the pit.
The time-keeper called time, and at exactly 2% o’clock, P. M., the
dogs were set to work. Sabin’s dog' succeeded in catching hold
of Sport’s throat and threw him heavily. First fall for the NHL ,
waukee dog Mae, when two to one was offered on his winning.
They fought very lively for 15 minutes, when Sport broke loose,
and seizing Mac by the butt of the ear, Sabin’s dog screeched;
and howled‘intensely, and, in 'spite of 'all his cries, Ben, like all‘
of his previous struggles, was doomed to defeat af: er ﬁghting just
80 minutes. The dog Mac made the ﬁrst turn, was sponged out,“
but he had got enough. Sabine then threw up the sponge, and
the Frenchman was hailed the winner, Sabin’s dog being very1
badly punished. As this was Como’s ﬁrst battle in America, the
fancy think a great deal of him. Bill has a lot of canines that he
proposes to ﬁght with any one in the town, weights ranging from
18 to 32115.

SKIBMISE On'r Wnsr.-A lively battuale was brought off at a
Well known resorte of the Milwaukee, Wis., fanciers, on the 4th
inst, between D. II. Delmy,’s "yaller dprg” Yankee, and a canine
of Teutonic extraction, yclept Jack. 'lhe former was handled:
by J. Eagger, while Jimmy Rowan manipulated ’tother critter. ;
The ﬁght, which was for $50, was pulled ed by Jack in fourteen
minutes.

CANINE DISPUTE SETTLED.—'M0ndaiy, Feb. 4th, caused a great 3
gathering of the canine fraternity from Washington and its sub-
urbs, to witness a contest for $200 between D. C. Callahan’s
brindle dog, Jack, known as the Express, of Georgetown, and
Tom Mack’s white dog, Jack, of West End, at 28115 each, which
came off at Kurck’s pit, ﬁve miles from the great metropolis, on
the Malborough road, and after a. hard contested ﬁght of eighty-
ﬁve minutes the brindle came out the victor. He is now open
to ﬁght any dog in the District of Columbia for frem $100 to $200

COCK-FIGHT BROKEN UP. 7
On Thursday night a large party of roughs from
the Fourth, Sixth and Twefth Wards crossed into West-
ehester County for the purpose of amusing themselves
with a cock main. This fact was learned by Capt. Slott

of the Thirtieth Precinct, and he at once telegraphed the
inform atl on to Capt.W1l.son of the Thirty-second Precinct.
Taking With him Roundsman Woodward and a section of
men, Capt. Wilson .iursued the gang, and at length found
them secreted in t e cellar of the residence of Patrick
McQueeney, in the little village of Danger, Westehester
County. They were dispersed, but as the brutal sport
had not commenced, although all the arrangements were
made, none of. the party were arrested. . -

LIVELY “Done” SKIRMISH IN NEWARK—On Monday evening,
8th inst., Stedwell Hall, Newark, N. J., was the scene of a pro- J
liracted tussle between two butchers’ dogs, named respectively I

» jBeddy and Black Tom. Roddy is the personal property of Harry

» ‘Stevens, Black Tom belonging to Jack McLaughlin, . and the

match between them was for a hundred “chucks.” About 250

. people were present, and having selected Dad Leary as umpire,
at about nine P. M., the “animiles” were letjloose, and at it they ,

’ went like grim death, Reddy getting hold of Tom’s right fore-

‘ leg, near its junction with the shoulderpwhile his antagonist

l fastened his teeth in Reddy’s head directly over the right eye.

Each held on with the tenacity peculiar to the breed, and struggled
from one part of the ring to the other in almost indistinguishable -

‘confusion, raising the enthusiasm and interest of the spectators
:to the highest pitch, and making it next to impossible to tell,

,3 which was getting the best of the ﬁght. The hold of Black Tom

on the eye of Reddy was ﬁnally unloosened, not by the strength
of the latter, but by the fact that the aforesaid eye itself gave '
way under the faults of the other beast, the eye-ball being pulled »
‘ out of its socket, and lying a mangled, bleeding fragment on the »

‘r side of the animal’s face. During all this tugging of twenty

‘ minutes Reddy had been far from idle, and when the dogs were
’ ‘ pulled .apart, it was found that he had crunched the bone of '

i
J
i

 

 

  

Black Tom’s leg. Neither backer could claim much advantage »
for his dog under these circumstances, and one more round-
» was had, this time between a dog with one eye and a dog with
but three legs. Neither so eagerly nor viciously did the dogs
‘On this occasion make for each other, but still,the Vim with
jwhich they went at the work showed there was not a little ﬁght
lleft in each yet spite of the results of the preceding round.
Raddy seized Black Tom at the neck, and was himself seized
upon the old sore spot in the place where the eye had been. In
this position the brutes fought with varying success, for over
half an hour, tearing one another’s ﬂesh and leaving it doubtful
if either would survive the ﬁght. At last Reddy’s strength gave

FOR THE WEEK ENDING JUNE 8,1867.

H TTIEFiglrtinngogﬁBowler.

“ This celebrated dog was imported from Liverpool,
England, in 1.865. Not long after his arrival he was
matched against Rocky Moore’s Tip, of Philadel-

phia, at 251-4 lbs., for two thousand dollars, which
was won by Bowler in one hour and eight minutes,

l

. This ﬁght gave Bowler great celebrity in sporting
Circles, and not long after a match was made with

Bill Savin’s dog Billy, pf Chicago, at 24 1-2 lbs. for >

one thousand dollars “a side, and proceeds of the
pit. The ﬁght took place on thel4th of February,
1866. After a very game contest, lasting two hours.
and twenty minutes, the Chicago dog died, ands
Bowler after having the best care, died during the
? night. he odds on Bowler during the progress'or
‘ the ﬁght was 1,000 to 100.
Mr. Harry Jennings, so well known in sporting
, circles as a dog trainer and fancier of great experi-
ence and abilities, gives us as his opinion that there
never was a dog fought under such trying circum-
stances as in the Chicago match. The thermome-
ter ranged considerably below zero, and the handlers
were obliged to appear in heavy overcoats, mufﬂers,
Ste. Yet notwithstanding this, the ﬁght lasted two
hours and twenty minutes. Although Bowler’s
career was. short, it was a thoroughly brilliant one,
and we believe that his two ﬁghts were for more
money than any others that ever took place.

NEW YORK SPORTSMEN’S CONVENTION.—At th
New York Sports en’s Convention held at LeRoy
last week, H. H. . ieldon, of Niagara Falls, won the
ﬁrst prize for pistol shooting, and John Taylor, of
Jersey City, the ﬁrst prize at double birds. On the
second prize for double birds N ewell, of Buffalo, and
Drake, of Toledo, were tied. Newell, having won
prizes for several years in succession, generously
withdrew in favor of Drake. Taylor won in the
match of twenty-ﬁve single birds, J. Ward, of
Toronto, being his adversary. J. H. Foster, of
Chicago, and Mr. Ward shot a match at ﬁfty single
birds, which was won by Mr. Ward. ,

The following gentlemen were elected oﬂ‘icers for

the ensuing year: President, Hon. George W. Clin?

-,‘ ton, of Buffalo; Vice Presidents, C. C. Morse, of
l Rochester, ——-— Beech, of Syracuse; Recording Sec?
[retary, John B. Sage, of Buﬁ‘alo; Corresponding
.‘1 Secretary, Randolph Ballard, of LeRoy; Treasurer,
i S. S. Spencer, of Rochester.
l The date of holding the next annual Convention
was ﬁxed between the third Tuesday in May and
a the third Tuesday in June, the special date to be
‘ ﬁxed by the Forrester Clubof Buffalo, at which
place the Convention will meet.

BATTING.

 

,. Ratting Match for 21. Stake of $200 Between
Green Dogs—An Interresting Event Among
the Fancy—Set-to Between Bull Terriers.
Aratting match occurred yesterday afternoon at Kit

Burn’s Sportsman’s Hall, on Water street, which was pro-

ductive of much excitement among the circles directly

interested, although the strictest measureswere adopted

‘ to prevent news of it from reaching outside parties. A

3‘ few weeks since a party of sporting characters were

‘ assembled at a sporting house on Houston street ‘

one evening, when, after considerable parleying, a ‘

match was made of $100 a side, between a dog
owned by the keeper of the, house and a. canine
controlled by the captain of ‘ one of the river
steamers—the animal succeeding in despatching twenty
rats in the shortest space of time to be declared the
winner. Neither of the animals thus pitted had gamed ;

aname for rat killing; indeed it was understood that 3

this was the ﬁrSt appearance of each in a ratpit. It

was essentially a "mufﬁn” match, and it was desrgned ‘
more to afford amusement than to win a large sum of

money. The Houston street man’s dog, Charley. isa
wine colored spaniel of very handsome build, and was
yesterday in the ﬁnest condition. The contesting dogis

a black and tan of clumsy form and action, but had dis-

played much aptness in ridding a steamboat of rats at a
former period.

 

SCENE on THE MATCH.

At two o’clock yesterday the parties interested met
with the dogs at a sporting house in Houston street,
whence they proceeded, separating into different squads,
by various routes, to the scene of action in Water street.
This place has been previously described in the HERALD
, and requires now no Special mention, save that it is the ‘
. acknowledged headquarters for dog ﬁghting and amuse-
ments of the same character in this City. On
this occasion so completely had the affair
been hushed that only the principals, the own-
ers of the dogs and their adherents were
present. This constituted a gathering of. about ﬁfty.
After stopping in the barroom to pay their respects to g

the manager of the concern by drinking his liquor, the
‘ assemblage proceeded through the demons and winding
passages to the amphitheatre, in the centre of which was
located the pit. The party ranged themselves about on the
seats, the dogs being held to prevent their leaping in
before the appointed time. ‘A referee and timekeeper
were appointed, and the usual preliminaries arranged,
when Burns soon made his appearance in the pit with a
. large cage enveloped in sacking.

. THE worms. -

When this had been removed there were seen about
ﬁfty rats packed ina cage, having a capacity_hardly
1 larger than a comman pail. The cage was deposxted on

 

 

 

 

with ,

‘ which to pay tolls over, bridges, and to strengthen

‘ conﬁdence and vice versa if Neil will come .to the

; thought of the deadly hug he might give were he so l
, inclined. Moore seemed determined to stand his 1
ground, and so the hear was let loose. ‘ J
Round} M TEEdFngm " i
,— oore s an eterminedly awaitin 'an 5

* attack, while ‘fBruin” waddles wickedly ro%nd'
: the pit, eyeing his adversary in avery unpleasant ,

3 manner. Not knowing :what might re- 1
: suit Irom delay, Moore “determines ot
:force the ﬁght, and so delivers a leit
I hander well between Bruin’s eyes 3'1

“ Bruin” slowly raised himself and placed a paw l
on Moore’s shoulders. Moore . strove to seize the '
brute by the throat, but of no avail; then pushing ?
the bear oii’ he planted another blow on Bruin’s {
nose. Bruin tore down his paw, bringing a large 3'
portion of Moore’s ﬂesh with it. First blood al-
lowed ior Bruin. Moore fell back. ' l
a Round 2.-—Moore appeared exasperated, Bruin
as cool as a bear could look.
was the aggressor endeavoring to seize and throw 3”
the bear. Bruin came up to the scratch literally 3
l by Slnklng Moore’s cheek, and laying bare the bone. 1
gloore reeled, and fell. First knockdown for
rum. '

Round 3..-An attempt was here made to prevent
matters gomg further, but Moore would not hear or ,
it. ,He persisted in continuing the ﬁght; and
as Bruin raised himself on, his hind legs,
with the evxdent intention ' of practising "
the “hug,” Moore tripped him, and seizmg him
by the throat ran on him.

In this position Bruin could do but little. Moore
planted his knee on the brute’s belly and tightened
his grasp on his throat. It was now evident Moore 1
had the tight his own way. Kit now, for the sake l
ot the bear, thought proper to interfere, and though i
Moore strenuously insisted on retaining his hold
the combatants were separated. ' 5

THE RESULT. l

Bruin defeated but not subdued was forced growi- E
ingly to his kennel. Moore presented anything buta l
pleasant appearance. His face and arm bled pro-- 5
Iusely, and still he offered to ﬁght the bear in the l
street for $50. Moore .won the dranS, which were l
lreely given. After this the spectators separated, ‘
much pleased with the day’s Sport.

BRUTAL FIGHT,.BErv_v1-tn; Does.-——-A dog ﬁght

came off last evening at a sporting house in Williams-
burgh. The contestants were Jackson’s dog Jupiter
and J. Small’s dog Pedro. The match was made last
week. Each dog was to scale at twenty~two pounds or
under. Small’s dog stands about eight inches high

~ and weighed twenty-one pounds. Jupiter is nine

I inches high, and weighed twenty-one and one-half

; pounds. Pedro was handled by Jack Caldwell, and J u- ‘

:~ tariff of $150 admission under the representation of

. “a ramefor an eight-day clock.”

; At 8 o’clock the handlers let them go, and a. hard

‘ struggle ensued. Jupiter out-fought Pedro at all
points. Jupiter was the favorite, and his handler
offered $.50 that he would ﬁght two hours, which was
accepted, as was also several simllar bets. The ﬁght
lasted two-hours and ten minutes, and was declared a. :
drawn battle, Jupiter holding his antagonist by the ‘

‘- back of the neck and Pedro by the throat at the, time
the ﬁght was ﬁnished. The ﬁght, probably, was only 1

{us ~ say, , twenty misdemeanors? Or‘r'are the

 
  
   

ftwenty unfortunate. pasSengiei-‘s each guilty of -

?a misdemeanor for gettingsihto a Car in which
twenty~four fortunate passengers have got

before them? The fact ’ isgithat the blame of ‘

jthis almost‘intolerable nuisanCe of overcrowd-
ing must be divided between the public and
the railway companies. People see perfectly

well that a car is quite full. They know there 5

is ' scarcely room to stand on the platform.
They know they will be crushed, and will
«crush others, and will have a good chance’oi'

their pockets being picked. In spite of all

this they persist in forcing themselves on the

car. It may be very inconvenient and dis-1

agreeable to crush and be crushed, but it is

still more inconvenient to be left behind. It '

is a mere choice of evils, and they choose what
they think is the lesser. Their business is per-
haps of pressing importance, they desire to
; catch a train or a boat, or they are anxious to re-
; join their families. . To ‘do this they are willing
'. to stand if they cannot obtain a seat. Even with
twenty-four seated passengers there is plenty
«of room for a few to stand, yet Mr. Bergh’s
"bill makes it a misdemeanor for the conductor

to admit them, or in them to gain admittance, ‘
far it is by no means clear as the bill reads who ;

are to be deemed the guilty parties. We may
depend upon it that. a regulation which both;
sides are interested - in disregarding can

never be enforced, and if the attempt were '
made, no conductorsor drivers could be found
to run the risk of being imprisoned for whatj

they could not avoid.

It is surprising that a more effectual way’ of,
'reaching the root of this evil did no t' occur to Mr.

Bergh. It is thatof licensing each stage or car _

to carry a certain number of passengers, ﬁﬂg

the number according to the dimensions of th ‘

vehicle and the number of horses attached to

it. Inﬁict a ﬁne of from one to ﬁve dollars

upon the company owning the conveyance}
for every passenger carried above the licensed
number, and give half the penalty to the informer.

You then unite the interests of the owners and; '

of the public. The former would take"'care,‘j

by an alteration in the form of the cars, that

no one could step 9n without the knowledge
and consent of the conductor—a thing quite
too easy at present—and among the latter there
would be plenty interested in watching that
the conductors did their duty. If it is said
that encouraging informers is a bad policy, we
ask wherein, their self-assumed duties would
differ from that of the ordinary policeman?
‘They would be paid according to their dili-
gence, and the latter certainly would not be
zealous in looking for a misdemeanor which
was a luxury to a small crowd. Besides, un—
der the Revenue and Customs system, the
brood of informers is encouraged, and we see
no reason, if the pockets of our respected Uncle
are to be protected by such means, why our

social comforts may not be likewise. We grant .

the occupation. would. not be congenial to a

. rigor.

:man of nicesenSe of honor, but them is no;
lthing decidedly immoral in it; and while the 3
lrailway companies mantain a system of “ spot-
?ters ” to detect the shortcomings of their col-
Electors, it would gratify a sense of retributive
justice if a similar measure were dealt to them.

The public is certainly under many obliga-
itions to Mr. Bergh, and if he will take this
imatter in hand, we care not whether in the
interests of the horses or of men, with the
same zeal he has carried out other matters, he
will earn the fervent thanks of the community.
It has, no doubt, n'ot escaped his consideration
that by diminishing the,number each car (the
fstage matter is of less importance) is allowed
5to carry, the number of cars running must be.
5 increased if the same number of passengers
3are to be accommodated. To do this would
require extensive alterations in the internal
economy of the companies. The platforms of
their cars must be removed, more horses and
more cars must be provided, and additional
conductors and drivers be engaged. To insist
ithat this shall be done on the day the act
ipasses, is to commit a great injustice on the
proprietors. We have not much sympathy
with thesq__g§ntIY- They will. probably do all

‘ they can to impede the executiOn of the act;

But that is no reason they should be treated
unjustly; and we would depri’Ve them of the
least shadow of excuse for not doing their.

If we arerldo‘omedto have our City railroad
cars crowded to suffocation,is it not possible to dew ‘
vise some way of providing extra seats! Is the!
inventive genius of the country unequal to this
simple task! One would suppose that a car
might be devised which should contain three
benches instead of two. One“ of the roads tried
the experiment, which succeeds so well in both
Ilondon and Paris, of furnishing seats on tep;

\ but this, we believe, was found to add too much

to the weight of the load, and out of pure sym-
pathy for the horses,rthc company gave it up.
But certainly American ingenuity is not to be so
easily balked. We venture to say that if the
companies would offer a premium for a car which
WOUI'd seat forty pasmgers instead of twenty-four
it would speedily be forthcoming. It would, at
all events, be worth. their trying.

Water Privile fies for Horses;
Tim attention of the Society for the pI'G-;
vention of cruelty to animals, was directed,

some time ago, to the subject of pro-‘

viding comfort for weary horses, in;
the manner of‘an abundant supply of water.
At present there are\ very few watering,
places for the convenience of tired and
famished beasts oi burthen. This want is

painfully evident in the appearance of this " ‘

poor brutes that are compelled to work hour
after hour in'hot and dusty streets withoht
anv refreshment. If any treatment; is cruel
this ( ertainly is; but drivers cannot be blam-

; ed unless there are public horse-troughs at

Which the animals can step When occasion
requires. It-would be deemed attrocious to .
keep a human being at work for hours to-
gether in the hottest weather, without a»
drop of water; yet horses suffer from the
same privation even more than men. ' This
is a case in which the cause of humanity

. may be rendered essential service at a com?

paratively small outlay. The Society:
should urge the matter on the authorities at:
once, that the improvement may be made,“
before the weather becomes really hot. 10‘

"would be well if the public drinking foun‘o‘

tains also were increased in number at the

same time. An abundant supply of fresh*
_ water, easily obtainable, will prevent thou-p
, sands from indulging in less innocent pots-T
: tions and will materially contribute to the j
public health and comfort. Water for;
rman and beast is a boon which the authori- ,
‘ ties 'cannot reasonably withhold. ‘

Drinking 7 fountains are-to be erected ini
different part-s of' the city in the course of a ‘
week. The Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals pay theVexpenses. They '
are of iron, in three departments, the upper
one for the public, the middle one for‘
horses, and the lower one for dogs.

, tion of cruelty to animals is producing the most bene? ‘
ﬁ‘cial results. A man now thinks twice before he beats f

. his wife ;, and, wonder of wonders, there is a chance or L

‘ even compelling those irresponsible monsters, the ‘

- managers of the railroads from ill-using the cattle which 1
i draw the carstor the cattle which ride in their miser- '
. able vehicles. We have no wish to be alurmists, but .

we are convinced that if that terrible but well-invited and f:

.; well-deserved scourge and guest, the Cholera, ever ‘

‘ comes here, it will be in consequence of the joint im- l
l 'portunities of the tenement-houses and those still more 2
disgracefully ova-crowded tenement-s, the rail oad cars l
--which, as conducted now, are sarcasms upon the tor- 4‘
bearance of that soulless epicene, the public of New

t-with the grossest frauds is something wonderful,
l and makes us doubt whether we are not Chinese
{instead or Anglo-Norman Americans. The ferries of'
is Hoboken and Williamsburg are really facetiously had—
more especially the former. There is more regard paid --
r to the calves and pigs in London and Paris than there 2
; is to corresponding animals of the human Species in '
Hoboken. There is a lively mixture of octogenarian.

"the mistaken notions of some philosophers. They i

ancient philosophers generally agreed that rutes
reason, including Anaxagoras, Celsus, Galen, Plu-
‘tarch and Plato. Lactantius accorded them
everything that men ,_ possess, except reli-
gion. The metempsechosm theory .of the Pytha-
goreans proved that they believed this. Des Cartes
claimed that brutes were mere breathing machines,
or automate, destitute of all reason, thought and per-
ception, and that their acts are onlﬁthe consequences

“A merciful man is merciful to his beast ”—Wt‘nﬁs
not found in the Scriptures, though often quoted as a
part of the divine word. The nearest approach to this
ancient maxim in the Bible is, formd in the text, from
WhiCh it is undoubtedly derived. Yet there firs-more

 

force in the original Scripture than in the maxim '

which has been evolved from it, for in the latter kind-
ness to the inferior creation is made an attribute of

istic of rectitude Humanity to animals is made in
the text a necessary proof of a man’s r.ectitude.. f He
has no claims to be considered a just nran who abuses
the power entrusted to him over the irrational races,

der mercies are 01uel.”

DIVISION OF THE SUBJECT.

I prOpose to consider

1. The criminality of cruelty to animals

2. The alarming p1 evalance of this sin.

3. The methods by which a reform may be effected.

The cziminality of cruelty to animals is manifest
fromthe fact that it is a violation of the Law of God,

The law of God enjoins compassion for the weak -
and helpless. We are to place ourselves in the con;

dition of those under our author ity, and deal with
them as we should expect and desire to be treated in

the lrkecrrcumstan ces. In the Hebrew econor'nytheie :
, were specral enactments protecting animals, of which ,
the fellcwrnc in; auction is an example: “ Thou shalt
not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the
1 corn; ” and this is used by the Apostle in the New
Testament to illustrate the truth that the “labor-er is;

worthy of his hire.” He inquires: “Doth god take

' care of oxen ‘?‘ " inferring that He will much more re-

gard the claims of those who labor in his service in
the church Of asimilar character are some of the

I illustrations of our Lord: “Behold the fowls of the

air, for they sow not, neither do they reap n01. gather
into barns, yet your Heavenly Father feedeth Them;
are ye not much better t nthey‘p) He says of the
sparrows, “that not one“, them falleth to the ground
without his notice. ” ;;

m'l‘here are many reasons why this cruelty should?
not be tolerated. One raeson is that it hardens
the ﬁner feelings of the offender. It blunts the;
edge of tenderness; blights the opening ﬂower of
mercy. and makes m‘an savage in character and
disposition. Another reason is that the example
has a pernicious inﬂuence upOn the young. Their
natures are plastic and they are readily, moulded
by the hand of association. In imitation of this
example {they will begin to practice the same

  

 

 

 

' cruelty With the same indifference. Another

reamn is that it is in opﬁo’sition‘ tot at religion ,
which is full of tenderness and comp ssion. Noi
man can esteem and practice the principles of
Christianity, and at the same time exercise cruelty
l’to the irrational animals. Another reason is that
we commit a great wrong when we abuse ,
these creatures 9; a lpwer order. We have no
more right to abuse them than we have to abuse 4
these 01 our own ‘race'or own hindred. Their de-
fenceless condition, ' their willing subjugation and
their obedient dispositions should call out our;
sympathy, our kindness, and our mercy. We are
forbidden to mistreat them by the law of reason,
by the law of.conscienee and by the law of God ,
it these reasons arena ,nt.» then the practice of.
this crueltv should be ena '90.. We have no right.
to carry this relict of barbarian: in the lap of this j
civilization. '1 his Cruelty is a disgrace to this pe- ll
riod, and a shame to our community. It indicates
nice of the brute than the man; more of the un- ‘
tutored savage than the intelligent Christian. lt‘j
developes the lowest passions and touches the ,
strings of moral power withaﬂame that destroys. J.
The warm light of. sympathy and tenderdess does j
not fall upon the heart when men is living in the I
austere climate of cruelty- When Doctor Kane
sailed on the Arctic b‘ea no sun warmed his up-
turned face; no ﬂower cheered his longing heart.
Man has been mistaken in regard to the in- a
ﬂuence of cruelty. He had supposed that cruelty l
tended to restrain and correct... But he has been 1
mistaken, as shown by exp ience and hiswry. .
Cruelty does not, improve the disposition nor. re. 1
form the character. It archaes the spirit of retail: .
ation.; it whets the sword of vengeance; it poisons
the arrow of hatred. _ In the reign of Henry the
V111. the laws . Were never {more severe and
bloody; and it is a fact that crime. in that counv
lily was never so~ rife and. temble as under-i
tte sway of that monarch. 'When Louis the Six- y
tecnth was executed the reign of terror commenced,
:aud held an‘ awful sway in that darkened land. .
The guillotine dran u the‘blood of thousands, whilst
the pleading ofmany fellupon ears that were cruel.
Under this reign of cruelty no sublime-virtue was
developed; no majestic character was unfolded;
honor those moral triumphs which sometimes
illuminate a period were achieved. Man was not
restrained; the vices and abuses of the age were
not. corrected; though Danton with his superior ‘

 

 

 

 

 

 

endeavored to arrest Passion and evolve harmony
out 01 chaos. . Even the youth of France instead of
becoming‘fearful of the: guillotine introduced it
into their plays, and thus strove to imitate the
madman who swept through the streets of Paris.
'ivlanhas likewise been mistaken in his opinion
oi the influence of cruelty upon animals. He has
thought that cruelty tended to make them gentle

and obedient; and with this barbarous conviction

E He thought it very strange that a Christian

E not hesitate to say that the subject had been
1 treated in a manner altogether tunbecoming a
minister of the Christian religion, and in. a
manner worthy of a Pagan. The speakerﬂre~ E

' ferred to arguments which had been adduced
’; which demonstrated that cruelty to the lower E

l animals had inevitably to cruelties to those (if

. l the article in the Advocate in digniﬁed but se-

l were terms.

A Mr. Fillmore, had not seen the paper, but he .
had been attacked so many times in certain
papers that he paid no attention to the matter.

At the request of the audience the article in .
question was read by Mr. Bass; and if a vote _-
a expressive of the most unqualiﬁed indignation,
were moved about this time, it would have had
I . a unanimous adoption. , a
l Hon. Wm. Ketchum said he did not attach
much importance to the notice. There are I
: 1 men so completely given over to party, and E
‘: Itheir own small notions, that they cannot ap—'
1t preciate a movement in "favor of humanity at 5'
large. They are so narrow, so imbued with
7. .' bigotry, that they can only recognize that which .
E E contributes to their own party interests. He

man. With our boasted civilization we are
barbarous, and when men talk , as the editor 0!“

'1', this barbar’ism.

Mr. Julius Walker said he was asked, as he

. entered the hall, by a gentleman, if he had read
the article in the Advocate. He had not: but
, having heard it read, and looking at it from a
christian stand-point, he protested against the
utterance of such sentiments. They were
moved by malignity, political animosity and
bigotry, and a paper that would publish such
an article was not worthy of patronage in this
community. If he never had a reason he had
one now to stop this paper,and he would do so.
. This organization, he said, teaches men to ex-
ercise reason in their treatment of the lower
animals ~it inculcates a spirit of kindness~it
is alike creditable to the culture and refinement i
of our citizens, and it is a privilege to engage
in any enterprise looking toward the elevation
of man and the amelioration of the condition 01
the lower animals. He felt a deep interest in ‘
the success of the Society and he would labor
to promote its objects. Mr. Walker’s remarks
were roundly applauded.

Rev. Mr. Bingham thought after what had
been read, we had need of prayer. The objects
of the Society were grand, benevolent and glor-
ious; and he had no doubt that the gentlemen
Who compose the Society would do more for the E
beneﬁt of the widows and orphans (referred to E
in the Advocate) than those who oppose it. .

Mr. G. J. Bryan made some remarks, in E
which he showed that the gentlemen ol’ the
Society had always been among the ltlll‘lllUFl
in benevolent enterprises. .

Rev. J. Hazard Hartzell,’suggcstwl 'thut the

nati, Ohio, a ferocious monkey of large size escaped
from his cage, and reached the provision wagon, where
it connmnved to regale itself. Over this animal the

seized a whip and threatened the animal, who, before
l‘t‘t‘“l\’lll:" a blow, ﬂow at him, threw him on his back,
and i!‘.il‘lllf.,' at his ﬂesh, was crunching the bones of his
arm. win-n the shrieks of the wretched victim attracted
the \Vlmiv ,m rmmu l of the menagcrie, but no one among
thm: «land to approach the beast. Suddenly the un-

Bratt, “fluid on the way from his residence to his place

of business, was attacked by a savage bull dog. and as
thebrute came forward he took a jaekknife from his
pocket for the purpose of defending himself. As the
animal made a. desperate leap at his throat, Mr. Pratt
partially held him off with one hand, and with the other

thrust the knife into the body of the dog. Five times l

the dog leaped, each time receiving a thrust from the

knife, the last one proving fatal. The animal was ex- .

ceedingly ferocious, and every time he made a jump for 1

Mr. Pratt’s throat his big jaws rattled together with a.
subdued howl. Mr. Pratt’s position at one time was
exceedingly perilous; but he mustered up all his cour—
age to face the brute. who was thirsting for blood. A

:moresavage animal has not been seen in thatvirinity.

of all her milk. Finally, by close watching, he one day
detected the duel, and to his surprise found it a snake
of the kind known as a cow-snake. The creature was

at least ﬁve feet long, and as large as a man’s arm at the

A MAN SEWED UP IN A SACK SEES A BULL:

COMING AFTER HIM AND ROLLS AWAY. ,
sewed up in a sack, and so secure a basis of safe betting”
they repaired to a distant ﬁeld of a wealthy citizen, and"
just as they had got a young man sewed up in a sack.
they heard a rumbling sound in the distance. They took

it for distant thunder; but looking westward. one of
them saw dust and turf ﬂying high, in the air as if lifted:
by a tempest; and in a moment more a mad bull, roar-i
ing and pawing the sod, came tearing down in the direc-j
tion of the company of sports. One of the men, tall”
well—formed, athletic and spunky, seized a rail and went
out to meet the adversary; another took to his heels and

made the tallest time on. record; another ascended the,
nearest tree, our informant says, feet foremost, and the

poor fellow sewed up in the sack, partaking of the fears

of his ﬂying comrades, fell to the ground and rolled to

the barway, but could not go further. But the bull, af-

ter making one dash at the man in the bag, with his

hornshgurned and run away, awed by the bold front and
ﬂashi eyes of the man of pluck, muscle, and rail, and
the Whole party, to their inﬁnite joy, came 011' without,
a scratch.

A; Ram om the'Rami-page.

A case involving some fun as well as money is to be
tried in Northampton next week. Thomas Poole claims
$106 for injuries done to his wife by a ram owned. by L.
W. Langdon. The ram ﬁrst attacked Poole, who took‘

. refuge in an apple tree, and then the beast seeing Mrs.j

Poole running attac {ed 1: r, knocked her down, tore her‘

dress, etc. The activity oi‘ Mr. Poole, in climbing a tree,

is equal to his heroism in looking quietly on while the :

'wife ofhis bosom was made a butt of by a horned mon—

ster, whose horns ought to be worn bymMr. Poole, as a ‘
present from his Wife, for the courageous manner in which
he protected her. It is fortunate for Mr. P., that while
roosting in that tree, some carelessesportsman did ' not
come along and shoot him for a tree toad. We presume
no earthly consideration -—not even a drink of sour cider
made from the apples of that tree—could have coaxed.§
Mr. P. down from his safe position, while the ram was‘L
