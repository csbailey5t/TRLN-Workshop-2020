430 EAST 57TH STREET

29 November 1965

Dear Mrs. Stevens -

:This morning's mail brought a letter
appealing for support for a new group,
the Committee for Humane Legislation,
which is dedicated to the passage of
humane slaughter laws in New York and
New jersey. Among the founding members

of this organization are Orson Bean,
Peggy Cass, and — as Chairman and Albany
Representative - Alice Herrington Schmid.

Since the cause is so worthy and we are
all more anxious than ever to get action,
I am wondering whether you feel a new
group of this kind could prove helpful
in the overall picture? I am well aware
that a Federal humane slaughter law is
the essential need; on the other hand,
if these peOple have a hope of function-
ing effectively, perhaps one should not
ignore interim steps which would better
the situation in New York and New Jersey.

Being unable to assess the situation my-
self, 1 am turning to you for possible
clarification.

All good wishes.

Sincerely,

(/M /W’Z/ﬂ:ﬂ7wc /

A Message to Non-Kosher Meat Consumers—Both Christians and Jews

THE MEAT YOU EAT IS
SEARED WITH PAIN

In New York and New Jersey the handling and killing of food animals is done with such brutality it
may be said they are tortured to death, not slaughtered. In non-kosher slaughterhouses animals are bludgeoned
with pole axes and hogs are dropped alive into scalding water. In kosher slaughter the fully conscious animal
is hoisted by a chain wrapped around its hind legs. One foreleg is then secured to a wall and the head is
pulled in the opposite direction by an iron hook inserted in the animal’s nostril. Rabbi Benjamin Rosen calls
for an end to “this evil” because “The animal screams and bellows with agonizing pain until the Shochet cuts
its throat, thus putting it out of its misery . . .”

    
   
 
 
   
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
   
 
   
       
   
   
   
     
 

 

SUPPORT FRIENDS OF ANIMALS, INC.’S BILL FOR HUMANE SLAUGHTER

Friends of Animals, Inc.’s Humane Slaughter Bill will end the cries of pain and terror in all slaughter-
houses, Without bringing Jewish religious law under civil law. This bill will be considered by the legislatures

of both New York and New Jersey.

FOA’s Bill Sets a Humane Standard for Non-Kosher Slaughterers. Packers are required to render
animals insensible to pain by a humane method before they are shackled, hoisted, cast, thrown, or cut.

FoA’s Bill Eliminates Shackling and Hoisting in Kosher Slaughter Without Placing Jewish
Religious Law Under Civil Law. This inspiration comes from Israel’s ban on the import of “U. S. kosher
meat processed by the shackling and hoisting method.” Jewish religious law requires the animal be fully con-
scious and uninjured at the moment of shechita (the ritual kill) and injuries are inevitable in shackling and
hoisting. In the U. S. the Rabbis who supervises kosher slaughter reject injured animals and they are then sold
as non-kosher meat. Kosher packers now sell between 60% and 75% of their total production to non-kosher
consumers.

Following Israel’s guideline, the FOA Bill closes the non-kosher market to packers who shackle and hoist.
This puts brutal packers out of business. They can’t sell injured animals as kosher under religiOus law and they
can’t sell injured animals as non-kosher under civil law. But the bill permits packers who use humane posi-
tioning methods for ritual slaughter to sell on both markets.

Humane methods are used under law in Israel, Canada, and Europe. FoA’s Bill will force their use in
New York and New Jersey.

§ 96—aa. Declaration of legislative determination and policy. The legislature of
this state hereby finds that the use of humane methods in the slaughter of livestock
prevents needless suffering, results in safer and better working conditions for persons
engaged in the slaughtering industry, brings about improvement of products and economy

consumers which tend to expedite the orderly flow of livestock and their products. It
is therefore declared to be the policy of the state of New York to require that the 9.9.1.1}:
mercial slaughter of all livestock and the handling of livestock in connection with such
slaughter, shall be carried out only by humane methods as and when such methods shall

be made available to commercial slaughterhouses.

§ 96—bb. Definition of humane methods. The following methods of slaughtering
cattle, calves, horses, mules, sheep, swine and other livestock are hereby found to
be humane: (1) a method whereby the animal is rendered insensible to pain by mechani—
cal, electrical, chemical or other means that is rapid and effective, before being
shackled, hoisted, thrown, cast or cut; or (2) a method in accordance with ritual re-
quirements of the Jewish faith or any other religious faith whereby the animal suffers
loss of consciousness by anemia of the brain caused by the simultaneous and instantaneous

severance of the carotid arteries with a sharp instrument.

E: visions of section 26~a of this chapter, finds that there is available at reasonable

cost a ritually acceptable, practicable and humane method of handling or otherwise

preparing conscious calves and sheep for slaughter. The findings of the commissioner

in the application of such subdivision shall be subject to review in the manner provided

by article seventy—eight of the civil practice law and rules. IpItwshnll therefore be the

means of referring to section 26*a of the Agriculture and Markets Law of which the
proposed humane slaughter bill would be an amendment. In other words, the Agriculture ‘
and Markets Law is Chapter 48 of the New York State Laws or 1922, and the proposed
Humane Slaughter Law would be a new Article 5-0 of Chapter 48, or "section 26—a of

this chapter. "

. Memorandum on behalf of
The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals

In SUPPORT of Senate Introductory 4393 introduced April 7, 1965,
and referred to the)Committee/Yen—Ra—les—

 

The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals supports
this bill Which for the first time offers to the peOple of the State of
New York an economical, defensible, and persuasive law to eliminate the
two most inhumane features of food=animal slaughterhouse practices. This
law would become effective January 1, 1966,,

In 1958 the Congress of the United States enacted a somcalled humane
slaughter law which, under the Constitution, could apply only to animals
used in livestock products purchased by agencies of the Federal Government,
Subsequent to passage of the nationallaw l6 states enacted similar
legislationo Scores of times since 1958, however, in states all over
the Union, similar laws have been uniformly proposed but uniformly and
consistently have failed of passage,

In the State of New York alone since 1959 a dozen or more "humane
slaughter” bills have died in committee, Not one has come before the
Senate or the Assembly for a voteo

The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals consistently
has deplored major slaughterhouse inhumanitieso This Society was in the
forefront when the Federal legislation was enacted, and over the years has
given support to humane slaughter bills introduced in Albany,

Beginning some ten years ago, humanitarians, religious leaders of all
faiths and processors of meat struggled together in. an effort to define, by
public law, what the words ”humane method” should mean as a guide to relief
of pain and anguish suffered by animals killed to feed mankindo Out of
this struggle came the Federal law and the 16 state statutes, but in the
enactment of every one of these laws it became necessary to isolate and
then disassociate deep historic religious practices from what otherwise
would have constituted one overaall "humane" method of coping with the

problem at i ssue o

The kosher ritual of instantaneous death to a conscious animal is in
itself a humane act, The cruelty lies only in the means by which the
animal is positioned for such slaughter: the hoisting and shackling of a

Conscious, frightened, struggling animalo

 




From the humane point of View ten years ago the vice of non—kosher
slaughtering lay in the use of hammers, sledges, and pole axes to beat
an animal into insensihility; whereas animal pain and suffering attendant
to kosher slaughter stemmed from the fact that life could be claimed only
from a fully conscious creatureo In the United States at that time under
public law coupled with slaughterhouse economics, this meant that the
animal had to be shackled and hoisted in presentation for the ritual of
death,

In this dilemma, legislation consonant with preservation of religious
freedom could have resulted am and did result an only in a ”humane method"
solution Which exempted the cruel shachling and hoisting attendant to
ritualistic slaughter of conscious animalso This pleased nobody, least
of all, perhaps, those orthodox Jewish leaders who for generations have
deplored the necessity for the shachling and hoistingo

All over the United States for the last halfmdozen years important and
influential segments of the Jewish com unity have smarted under innuendos
that their method of foodmanimal slaughter was both cruel and inhumane.

As a result, what might, and should have been a united crusade against
inhumanity flared into a fire of emotional human conflicto The ASPCA at
times was party to this sort of thingo No humane slaughter bill had a
chance of passage in such an atmosphereo

A new perspective is found in the bill this memorandum supports. For
the first time ever, Senate introo 4393 turns abruptly away from hitherto
unsuccessful and frustrating efforts exclusively to legislate humane methods
of slaughtering animalso Instead, it soberly outlines public policy, next
specifies humane methods of slaughter, and then spells out and prohibits
inhumane methodso Thus, in a few short but clear paragraphs it illuminates
that which is right and then forbids only that which iswrongo

Section 96mcc of the proposed law disposes of the only twc> questions
at issueo

First it should be noted that in New York State today there remains
not a shred of justification for using a hammer or a sledge or a pole ax
on any animalo A dozen or more governmentmapproved substitute instruments
and devices for instantaneous and painless animal stunning are available
at cost so modest as to be within the means even of the small farmer who
butchers his own animalso Thus the clear language of Section 96mcc-2 is

not legally, economically or morally arguableo

Remaining for comment here is the matter of outlawing the shackling
hoisting of conscious creatures in preparation for slaughter in a manner

 




consonant with uninterrupted continuation of historical ritualistic practices
and at the same time comfortably within restrictions of public lawo To the
extent that this inhumanity may be curbed with no offense even to the
economics of the packing industry, Section 96—cc—l is to the pointo Of
necessity the legal prohibition of 96-ccal can apply currently only to the
handling of large beef animals um steers, cows and bullso Later, appropriate
and timely expansion of the coverage would pose only an insignificant bill-
drafting problem,

On the subject of shackling and hoisting The American Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals can speak authoritatively, as follows:

This problem embraces kosher slaughterhouses, non-kosher slaughterhouses,
and establishments practicing both methods of butcheringo

- Large animals involved in this bill are steers, cows and bulls. Small
animals, later susceptible of involvement, are sheep, lambs and calves.
Ikgs —— never kosher killed mm are nevertheless included in the
pmohibitions found in Section 96~co—2o To the best knowledge and belief
ci'the ASPCA there currently is no shackling and hoisting problem involved
in slaughter of hogso

Since May 1, 1964, the ASPCA has exclusively owned patents completely
covering a proved, economical device eliminating shackling and hoisting
cf conscious large beef animalso License to use this device is offered
waalty—free and without profit to the Society to any slaughterhouse
anywhereo This ASPCA Holding Pen is adaptable for both koSher and non—kosher
cmerations and now is functioning on a moneynsaving basis in four
slaughterhouses, no one of which.is in NewYorko Each of the four
installations has been approved by the United States Government, and the ASPCA
venture also has been hailed by the Rabbinical Council of America as an
"unprecedented contribution" and as ”a dramatic breakthrough in the problem

of preparing and handling animals for slaughter,"

Availability of the beefnanimal holding pen now justifies legislation
Emohibiting shackling and hoisting of steers, cows and bulls.

Since November, 1963, the ASPCA has been working on a small—pen device
for elimination of Shackling'and.hoisting of sheep, lambs and calves, none
of'Which can be accommodated.in the large—animal pen because of the smaller
size of all of these animals as well as the fact that sheep and lambs must
he presented for slaughter in a radically different position from that
vmmkable for beef animals, and with much greater rapidity.

construction of a prototype of the ASPCA Small Animal Pen

Currently,
Schedules call for its delivery for

is nearing completion in Cindiﬂnatlo

 




testing with living animals at the College of Agriculture of The Ohio State
University in Mayo

It would be imprudent to forecast, or be led to believe, however, that
the small pen will be proved and marketable within the near futureo ASPCA
designers and engineers have overcome certain obstacles, but until live
testing takes place it is dangerous to be too sanguineo In light thereof
it will be noted that shackling and hoisting of other than large beef
animals is not to be prohibited in the bill this memorandum supports and
the Jewish peOple are therefore not denied such part of their present
kosher—killed meat diet as comes from sheep, lambs and calveso

When the ASPCA small pen or any other successfully developed similar
device can be made available to the meat industry following an appropriate
finding by the Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets the Society hOpes
New York law will be amended to eXpand coverage of inhumane animal
restraining practices to cover food animals of all sizeso

For all of the foregoing reasons The.American Society for the Prevention

of Cruelty to Animals respectfully urges immediate passage of these bills.
No legitimate opposition has been indicated and no valid resistance seems

conceivableo

At the request of Mrs. Christine Stevens, president of the New York State
Humane Association, I hand you the draft of a proposed 1966 New York humane slaughter
bill.

This draft was completed late yesterday at the end of the last of a series of
conferences and many telephone exchanges, some of them involving you gentlemen.

May I say to you that Mrs. Stevens has provided helpful leadership in this
matter to the end that the 1966 proposed legislation may be sponsored by the New York
State organization, of which the ASPCA and virtually all other humane societies in the
state are members.

May I also say, in a personal way, that Mrs. Stevens has accomplished a
great deal in trying to cut through many suggestions, etc. , etc. In this she has sought
the advice of two attorneys, and, as you know, both Mr. Nichols and Mr. Wager have
labored in the matter. Mrs. Stevens tells me this morning that she has a complete
green light from her legal advisors on the draft that is going to you herewith. Conse—
quently I think all we now need is to find out how you feel about it.

It would be our hope that the suggested language could stand up under scrutiny
by all concerned. My personal feeling is that if we start to dwell on semantics we well
may open a Pandora’s box because, verily, everybody seems to be full of ideas that
really do little or nothing to change the substance of the proposition, but, rather, seek

all sorts of ways to improve the language.

I have underlined in red all of the changes made in the final printing of the
bill this organization sponsored last year, a copy of which also is attached. Perhaps
it would be helpful for me to spell out the ”whys" of the proposed changes, as follows:

1. The use of ”LIVESTOCK IN COMMERCE" in the title of the Act and the
reference to "commercial" in Subsection 96—aa limit the application of the law to com-

mercial slaughterers.

WILLIAM MAPEL, Administrative Vite-President, 441 EAST 92M) STREET. New YORK 28, N. Y. TRAFALGAR 6~7700

 




(It will be noted that in Sin—dd the earlier exemptions
of farmers ,and slaughterers dispatching fewer than
20 conscious beef animals per week have been deleted. )

2. In 96~bb the term. ”mechanical" is substituted for last year '3 use of "by
a single blow or gunshot. " it has been reCOgnized that use of "single blow or gunshot"
last year was infelicitous. Why the writer used that phraseology is disclosed nowhere
in the notes or files on the subject.
(It should be noted that the proposed changes in both
96—bb and 96—cc are in harmony with the language of

the Council of State Governments "model" bill. )

3. The underlined sentence in 96—00 is to correct an inadvertent omission
in last year's hill.

4. Revisions in 96—dd serve to
a. Accentuate protection of religious freedom;

b. incorporate reference to the Kosruth committee,

as suggested by one or more of you gentlemen;

Provide the necessary "duty" on the commissioner
to conform to the requirement to sustain certiorari
under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules.
Reference to appropriate "annual" findings is pro-
posed to free the commissioner from frequent and
possibly often unjustified demands on him.

Proposed changes in 96-ee—1 are in line with observations above made.

6. The date change in Section 2 is merely updating last year's law.

Mrs. Stevens and some others of us hope to offer the attached draft as a New
Your State Humane Association convention resolution next month. By the bylaws of
the organization we are required to memorialize the membership 40 days in advance.

Consequently, a deadline is imminent.

Moreover, it is the plan of the ASPCA to take the proposed bill to the con~
vention of the Ammican Humane Association in Denver, on October 15. A hearing is
assured, and significant interest is developing. Idare hope that the AHA might use
its good offices to use the forthcoming New York bill in part as an amendment to the
"model” bill. This might go a long way toward minimizing arguments for wholesale

Cas e-w J avits amendments .

 




1‘
1};

Obviously in many states of the Union the New York legislation would not be
word-for—word applicable because, for example, there may not be Kcsruth committees
written into other state laws.

' Unless I do not ”read“ the situation accurately I dare hope you will look with
favor on the proposed submission. If not, we, of course, wish the benefit of your counsel.
Please, therefore, give me yeur reaction just as promptly as you can.

8‘ cerely yours, _

the use of English in prayers. _ .

Reform Jews differ sharply from the Orthodox on
the matter of Revelation. A Reform Jew accepts as,
binding only the moral laws of the Bible and those
ceremonies that “elevate and sanctity our lives.” He
does not follow customs he~believes “not adapted to
the views and habits of modern civilization.” ~

Reform Jews feel that faith must be rational and”T
capable _of withstanding the careful scrutiny of reai

. son and science. The worship of Reform Judaism tie-A

parts. from traditional forms. There- is. complete
equality of the sexes in the temple. Prayer is largely

_in English (or the vernacular). There is greater

flexibility in the choiCe of prayers. Instrumental music,
is permitted in the temple. The prayer shawl (tallith).1

‘ is not worn by the male worshipers.

Exactly what is azrabbi and what does he do?

. The authority of a rabbi is based not on his posiL.
tion but upon his learning. He has no special privié
leges. He is in no sense ‘an intermediary between
man and God. .

In Orthodox Jewish. practice, the rabbi rarely}
leads in thefservices; it is the cantor who conducts
worship. And any well-informw layman may rise,
to the pulpit _to lead the congregation in prayer.

There is no religioushierarchy in the Jewish faith:
The inﬂuence "of an individual rabbi is determined-
solely by his ability to keep the respect of laymen
and colleagues as an interpreter of Jewish law. '

The modern rabbi, like the minister, is responsible
for religious education, for worship in the synagogue,

  

..  ?. and death. and...tor pastoral guidance. 2 ‘

. Yes. Many times in history, Jews have been for-
--bidden to worship publicly: Synagogues and temples
have been closed by law. Yet Jewish religious life has
continued intact. ’ . p .

‘ The center of Judaism resides in --the family and
the home. Jews regard the .. home as a ﬁttingplgce
of worship—just as they regard marriage as a three-
way partnership between. husband, wife and God.

Our religion is essentially a family religion. The
mot-her, lighting the Sabbath candles; the father,
blessing his. . children at the table; the many happy
rituals that surround holidays, the scroll (mezuzah‘)
on the doorpost which» signiﬁes that God is in the
home—each of these is an integral part of Jewish life.

September 17, 1965

Mr. Rutherford T. Phillips, Executive Director
The American Humane Association

P. O. Box 1266

Denver, Colorado 80201

Dear Mr. Phillips:

Several times over the last year you have indicated that efforts being made in
New York and possibly elsewhere might some day call for taking a look at —-- and
possibly thinking of some modifications in -- the so~called "model” bill as recom—
mended by the Council of State Governments some years ago and as recommended
since then by the American Humane Association to persons prosecuting efforts toward
humane slaughter legislation in the various states.

Some time within the last two or three months you told me you thought it might
be entirely appropriate for me to discuss with your Board what we have been seeking
to bring about in New York by way of passing legislation which, in whole or in part,
would obviate the necessity for the Case—Javits amendment. You and I both lmow that
many of the leading rabbinical and orthodox figures have not been happy with legisla—
tion which has referred to the inhumanity of shackling and hoisting conscious creatures
but of necessity has had to exempt kosher slaughtering from any covered category in
this respect. Most of the Jewish leaders I know are outspoken in their regret that

Case—Javits amendments have been "nec essary. ”

Attached is a copy of the draft of a bill for which New York State Humane
Association sponsorship is to be sought at the upcoming convention of that organ-
ization. Even as I give it to you, I urge you to know that the ASPCA would not wish
to suggest or Sponsor the complete precise language of this bill as a type of model
statute for other states. Ishould like to amplify this admonition.

The language under Consideration in New York is the product of the two last
months of careful exploration by widespread humane leaders in New York State.
This exploration has embraced exposure of problems and suggestions to individuals
and agencies of the Jewish community who or which last year found the bill we had

introduced in Albany acceptable.
As I have told you,there are certain elements among the Jewish people who

voice strong opposition to any law which relates to historic, religious precepts and
practices. By the same token, on the other side of the coin there is a limited group

Mr. Rutherford T. Phillips . September 17, 1965

of persons in the humane movement who would seek to pass legislation which in the
opinion of the ASPCA would not deal realistically and fairly with important matters
having to do with Schechita and Halaich law.

The humane movement may never be completely united in support of any
measure, and the same thing certainly would appear to hold true insofar as the all—
inclusive Jewish community is concerned. As we have come so definitely to under—
stand, neither the entire Jewish group not the entire humane movement may by any
means be said to be monolithic.

In light of the foregoing may I point out to you two ways in which the attached
bill differs from the bill we sponsored last year, and the reasons for bringing about
these differences. Perhaps the best way to approach this is to indicate to you the
two subjects which, to one degree or another, formed a barrier to the passage of
last year's widely supported measure, as follows:

1. As indicated, there is one segment in the ultra—orthodox element
of the Jewish community which openly'opposes any legislation having
to do with the subject in question.

To be realistic, I think we must recognize that this so-called objection probably
never can be met. Perhaps, however, it can be diluted. We believe it to be correct
that the foregoing objection is put into words when it is said that there is strong and
highly vocal opposition to permitting any governmental official or agency to rule on
what is "ritually acceptable. " Nevertheless, when a limited exemption is granted for
what hopefully would be only a matter of time, there is necessity for including in the
law a provision paving the say for a future finding as to "ritualistic acceptability, ” etc.
This we did last year with respect to exempting conscious calves and sheep from the
no—shackling provision until such time as adequate restraining devices to eliminate
shackling and hoisting could be found reasonable in cost, ritually acceptable, practi—
cable and humane. Necessarily, to write such an in—future provision into a law which
could stand up to normal tests, it became necessary to provide a means for appropriate
findings. This we did by referring to the Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets

in the State of New York.

Parenthetically, Governor Scranton has just signed a Pennsylvania law of some-
what identical legislative intent which makes possible such findings by the Secretary
of Agriculture of that state. In both New York and Pennsylvania provision has been
made for judicial review of any such finding by the public official in government.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the word was circulated widely by a segment of
the Jewish community that in reality the New York proposal placed the decision in the
hands of a public official who might be neither Jewish nor of the cognoscenti in matters

of Halaich law.

 




Mr. Rutherford T. Phillips , September 17, 1965

On August 16, this year, a prominent figure in the New York State Humane
Association (a lawyer well versed in humane slaughter legislation) and the writer
sought legal guidance from an eminent Jewish figure who has been a strong and warm
inﬂuence for a period of years. We met for more than an hour, and out of the con—
ference came the observation that for three or four decades there has existed by law
in New York State a so~called Kosruth committee. to counsel with the Commissioner
of Agriculture and Markets on kosher matters. There was the thought that if this
committee were to be incorporated by reference in the proposed bill, this might
serve to answer the objection that a state official alone would be taking unto himself
the responsibility for making a decision on ecclesiastic matters.

Solely on the foregoing grounds we are proposing an amended Section 96—dd,
to read "acting on the advice of the advisory board on kosher law enforcement, in
accordance with the provisions of section 26—a of this chapter. " For your informa—
tion, "this chapter" is the legal way of referring to the Agriculture and Markets Law
to which a New York State humane slaughter bill would be an amendment.

One more paragraph on the delicacy of this matter, as follows:

I know of no other state in the Union with a so~called Kosruth committee, and
I think it well might be hazardous to propose a bill outside of New York which might
indicate the necessity for setting up such a committee. I think there well might be
humanitarian opposition as well as Jewish opposition to such a proposition. I under—
stand that in New York State the Kosruth committee always has been made up of-
prominent and authoritative Jewish figures. This well might not be true elsewhere,
and I can foresee that many rabbinical leaders under such circumstances might echo
the conviction that only Jewish people should try to interpret historic, sacred Jewish

law.

The bifurcated other objection to our bill last year came primarily
from other than Jewish sources. Broadly, we were asked why we
"condoned any type of alleged inhumanity" by exempting beef slaugh-
terhouses handling fewer than 20 animals per week, and also why we

. highlighted the exemption for farmers.

These two objections were easy to meet. In the first place we cured the farmer
Situation by making the new proposal refer entirely to commercial slaughtering. In
the second place we investigated the New York and New Jersey area as carefully as
we could and we were unable to find one single commercial slaughterhouse that would

fall within the provisions of the less—than-20 exemption.

Other than the foregoing I think the language of the proposed bill is clear. My
personal feeling is that as of now the new Pennsylvania law probably is the best so far

 




Mr. Rutherford '1‘. Phillips , September 17, 1965

in the United States. Nevertheless, I feel that with the sole exception of this matter
of reference to a Kosruth committee, the proposed New York bill would be an even
better law.

Ihave written you fully on this matter for two reasons: (1) Iwish you to know
about our reservation on this Kosruth committee subject and to understand that it is
a peculiar local New York expedient, and (2) I stand ready to discuss this matter with
your Board if you would permit it. Certainly the ASPCA might come out of Such a
conference with helpful advice, and perhaps some of the things that I have not written
in this letter could be dwelt on in the privacy of such a meeting. Also, I wonder if
humane slaughter is to occupy any place on the agenda for the open convention.

Because I hope you will elect to acquaint all of your Board members with this
letter, I am sending to you under separate cover 25 copies along with an equal number
of copies of the proposed New York legislation.

Will. you please let me hear from you in response to this letter at your earliest
convenience, by telephone to me at either my office or my residence if more conven—
ient to you.

S/inéerely yours , e,

DRAFT OF PROPOSED 1966 NEW YORK HUMANE SLAUGHTER BILL
* * * >l< * *
AN ACT

To amend the agriculture and markets law, in relation to the humane slaughtering of
livestock

The People of the State of New York, represented in Senate and Assembly, do
enact as follows:

Section 1. The agriculture and markets law is hereby amended by inserting
therein a new article five—c, to read as follows:

ARTICLE 5—C
HUMANE SLAUGHTERING’OF LIVESTOCK IN COMMERCE

Section 96—aa. Declaration of legislative determination and policy.
96—bb. Definition of humane methods.
96-cc. Methods of slaughter prohibited.
96—dd. Application of article.
96—ee. Administration; violations.

§ 96-aa. Declaration of legislative determination and policy. The legislature of
this state hereby finds that the use of humane methods in the slaughter of livestock
prevents needless suffering, results in safer and better working conditions for persons
engaged in the slaughtering industry, brings about improvement of products and economy
in slaughtering operations, and produces other benefits for producers, processors, and
consumers which tend to expedite the orderly ﬂow of livestock and their products. It
is therefore declared to be the policy of the state of New York to require that the com—
mercial slaughter of all livestock and the handling of livestock in connection with such.
slaughter, shall be carried out only by humane methods as and when such methods shall
be made available to commercial slaughterhouses.

§ 96—bb. Definition of humane methods. The following methods of slaughtering
cattle, calves, horses, mules, sheep, swine and other livestock are hereby found to
be humane: (1) a method whereby the animal is rendered insensible to pain by mechani—
cal, electrical, chemical or other means that is rapid and effective, before being
shackled, hoisted, thrown, cast or cut; or (2) a method in accordance with ritual re—
quirements of the Jewish faith or any other religious faith whereby the animal suffers
loss of consciousness by anemia of the brain caused by the simultaneous and instantaneous
severance of the carotid arteries with a sharp instrument.

§ 96—cc. Methods of slaughter prohibited. No commercial slaughterer shall bleed
or slaughter any livestock except by a humane method. The following methods of slaughter
within the meaning of this. article are in all instances prohibited:

 




1. Using a manually Operated hammer, sledge or pole ax as a means of
slaughtering any animal or of rendering any animal unconscious in preparation for
slaughter.

2. Shackling and hoisting or hanging any animal while such animal is conscious,
in the positioning of such animal for slaughter.

§ 96—dd. Application of article. In order to protect freedom of religion,
subdivision 2 of section ninety—six—cc shall not apply with respect to calves and
sheep being positioned for ritual slaughter as defined in subdivision (2) of section
ninety—six—bb of this article until one year after the commissioner, acting after con-
sultation with the advisory board on kosher law enforcement, finds there is available
at reasonable cost a ritually acceptable, practicable and humane method of handling
or otherwise preparing conscious calves and sheep for slaughter. The findings of the
commissioner in the application of such subdivision shall be subject to review in the
manner provided by article seventy—eight of the civil practice law and rules. It shall
therefore be the duty of the commissioner to make appropriate findings annually "under
this Subdivision.

§ 96—ee. Administration; violations.

1. The commissioner shall administer the provisions of this act. He shall
promulgate and may from time to time revise rules and regulations in connection .
with this article, and may, by administrative order, exempt from compliance with
this article, for a period of not to exceed one year after the effective date of this
article, any commercial slaughterer if in the judgment of the commissioner earlier

compliance would cause undue hardship.

2. Any violation of the provisions of this article or of the rules and regulations
promulgated by the commissioner thereunder shall be deemed a misdemeanor.

§ 2. This act shall take effect January first, nineteen hundred and sixty—seven.

of Cruelty to Animals

441 East 92nd Street

New York, N. Y. 10028

Dear Mr. Amundsen:

You have asked us, under Paragraph No. 5 of our
license agreement with you for use of the ASPCA Holding Pen,
to give you an indication.as to the approximate savings to
us as attributable to use of the pen rather than under the
earlier shackling and hoisting procedure for kill of large
beef animals.

Our story continues to be about the same as related
to you before you purchased the patent from us namely:

We estimate that by using the pen we save the cost
of one slaughterhouse employee because it no longer is necessary
to have a man hold the head of the animal for performance of
the actual slaughter by the Schochet or the person who uses the
captive bolt pistol. Under our current rates of pay, with an
appropriate allowance for fringe benefits, we estimate this to

be $7500 per year.

Furthermore, we estimate that use of the pen definitely
brings about a saving in bruised beef. This we estimate to be
$5000 per year. Thus, you will see that for other slaughterhouses
similarly situated, the pen would pay for itself in less than one
year., For example, we understand the retail price of the pen from
the manufacturer is $8,000, and we know that there is a normal
delivery and installation factor. Assuming, therefore, that a
new installation costs the slaughterhouse as much as $12,000, you
can see from the savings we have indicated just how rapidly this
investment would be liquidated. From then on, the saving is

constantly significant.

 




CROSS BROS. MEAT PACKERS INC.

We assume that you are pointing out to prospective
purchasers the intangible saving that comes from the safety
factor of the pen. You must know that the hoisting and
shackling of heavy beef animals inescapably threatens human
beings who must restrain them and dispatch them.

Finally, we believe the installation of the Cross pen —-
now called the ASPCA Holding Pen ~~ brought about a marked
and favorable employee—morale factor.

With personal regards to you and your associates,

Sincerely yours,

CROSS BROS. NEAT PACKERS, INC.

New York, New York

Dear Mr . Amund-s en:

Our ASPCA Holding Pen for beef animals soon will have been in Operation
for a year. We are well satisfied with it.

Because of structural changes necessary in our killing room, and the
necessity for purchasing an air compressor and tank, we spent some $3873
on top of the $8135 cost of the pen from the Food Handling Machinery
Corporation. This expenditure included shipping the device from Phila. to
Newark. '

The installation was accomplished over the Labor Day week-end. Thus
we lost no productive time in our slaughtering operation.

We are keeping careful records on the cost of using the ASPCA pen
against the prior practice of shackling and hoisting. Later on we shall
be pleased to give you a report on economies. Suffice it to say at this
time that we are saving on manpower and we are minimizing bruised beef
through use of the ASPCA pen. Moreover, we find your patented method a
source of gratification to our emplyees. The earlier hazards to human be—
ings no longer are present. The Schochets are particularly pleased.

In conclusion, let me say that we confidently hope to pay out on this
investment within another year or so. From then on our annual saving
will be most significant.

Cordially,

From tha humane innt of View ten years ago the vice of nonukosher
slaughter1ng lay in the use of hammers, sledges, and pole axes to beat
an animal into-insensibility: whereas animal pain and suffer1ng attendant
t0 kosher Slaughter stemmed from.the fact that life could be claimed only
from a fully conscious creature. In the United States at that time under
publ1c lawcoupled with slaughterhouse economics, this meant that the
animal had to be shackled and hoisted in presentation for the ritual of
death .

In this dilemma, legislation consonant with preservation as religious
freedom oeuld have reenlted ~— and did result -» only in a.hhumane method“
solut.1on which exempted the cruel shackli.ng and hoist1ng attendant to
r1tual.1stic slaughter of consc1ous animals. Th1s pleased nobody, least
: n+ 111 Pﬁrbagg +1111 n11,1_11 111111 1111111 111 is. 1sner111ons have
1191oted the nrcessxty for the shac kl ing and hoist1ng

All  over the United States for the last half—dozen years important and
influential segments of the Jewish community have smarted under innuendos
that their method_of food~ animal slaughter'was both cruel and 1nhumane.

As a result, what might, and should have been_a united crusade against
inhumanity flared into a fire of emotional human conflict. The ASPCA at
.t1mes was party to this sort as thing. No humane slaughter bill had a
chance of pasSage in such an atmosphere.

A new perspective is found in the bill this memorandum supports. For
the f1rst time ever, Senate Intro. 4393 turns abruptly away from hitherto
unsuccessful and frustrating efforts exclus1vely to legislate humane methods
of slaughtering animals“ Instead, it soberly outlines public pol1cy, next
specifies humane methods of slaughter, and then spells ou.t and prohibits
inhumane methods. Thus, in a few short but clear paragraphs it illumxnates
that which is right and then forbids only that whiCh is wrong»

Section Qavcc of the grogoseﬂ 11w dispomes of 111 wu}v two qweetlowq
' at 1851180

First it should be noted that in New York State today there rema1ns'
not  a shred of justification for using a hammer or a sledge or a pole ex
on any animal. A dozen or more governmentwapproved substitut.e ~nctruments

and dev1oes for instantaneous and pa1nles 3 animal stunning are available
 at cost so modest as to be  with1n the means even of the small farmer who

butchers  h1s own anlmals. Thus the clear language of  Sec'tt1on 96 cc 2 is
not legall y, economically or morally arguable.

V Remaining for comment here is the matter of outlawing the shae1l1ng‘ano
hoisting of conscious creatures in preparation for siaughter 1n a manner

consonant with uninterrupted continuation of historical ritualisti:
practices and at the same time comfortably within restrictions of 3,2231

lav. To the extent that this inhumanity may be curbed with no Ofterxu ev

Of practical as well as religious necessity the legal prohibition of 96 cc—Z

apply to all other animals Later apprOpriate and 125.13%};3 expan 5:102“: of tie
coverage to eliminate the exception as to calves and sheep would pose only
an insignificant bill- wdrafting problem

Prevention of Cruelty to Animals can speak authoritatively, as; £0,111,332"

September 9 , 1965

Mrs. Christine Stevens
1411 34th Street, N. W.
Washington, D. C. 20007

Dear Mrs. Stevens:

This letter is being written immediately following a conference held this
afternoon and attended by the undersigned and Howard B. Nichols, Esq. ; Philip
Jacobson, Esq. ; Dr. Leo Pfeffer; Rabbi Israel Klavan and Arthur L. Amundsen.
Dr. Pfeffer is a nationally known constitutional lawyer who represents a sig—
nificant element of the Jewish community. Mr. Jacobson is an officer of the
National Community Relations Advisory Council, an organization member of the
Rabbinical Council of America and 156 Jewish organizations all over the country.
Rabbi Klavan, as you know, is the executive vice—president of the Rabbinical
Council.

At the conclusion of this conference it was determined that the next
indicated step toward the end that there might emerge this fall a humane
slaughter bill sponsored by the New York State Humane Association and its
member groups and individuals would be to ask your approval for submission of
the text of the attached draft of a bill to all of the members of the State Associa—
tion at once. If you approve, this would be a proposed resolution calling for
sponsorship of the proposed bill by the State organization. Collis Wager would
propose the resolution and, if you desire, William Mapel would be pleased to

second it.

It was the considered judgment of all present that the language handed you
herewith would tend to reconcile and incorporate all the suggestions earlier made
with respect to new subject matter in a bill. The conferees weighed all reasons
advanced pro and con with respect to incorporating reference to the Advisory
Board on Kosher Law Enforcement. Those present frankly and openly weighed
reported distrust by certain elements of the Jewish community in the giving of
even limited authority to the Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets, as well
as certain other points of distrust with respect to the Kosher Advisory Board.

It was pointed out that both types of reservation would be met if the ultimate
reliance were to be on the courts, as incorporated in the last sentence of

Section 96—dd on Page 3 of the attachment.

 




Mrs. Christine Stevens , September 9, 1965

If you approve the language of the enclosure, will you please telephone
either or both of the undersigned?

As both the Humane Society of the United States and the American Humane
Association have conventions prior to the State convention, if the present pro—
posal is approved by you we believe efforts should be made to get the support
of both those organizations at the time of their conventions.

Finally, if you can give your approval over the telephone, we will provide
Mrs. S'choepperle with sufficient c0pies of the resolution for immediate circu—
lation to the New York State Humane Association membership, as indicated by
the by—laws. The objective would be to make this a New York State Association
bill and to get widespread endorsement from other groups.

Sincerely yours ,

Echinshbn said: it is not necessary to,put the refarence to the courts in the law
since it is already there. The way the bill is now written, there is no duty on

the advisar? taard on kosher law enforcement to act. They cauld file and forget

it. He asked whtt ara the board's functions. He pointed out various ways in which
racoarsa to the mamrts cauld be used by_oppononts of a humane pen for calves and
shaap: l) teahnimal objectians by rabbinical groups, 2) substanca, for example, that
the ﬁaterminatibn af the_Cammissioner was based'in insufficient or misleading ‘

Dear 2%. Mapel,

This draft incorporates some of the
things we were talking about and will
give us a basis for discussion.

Mr. Robinshohn has something further ﬁn
mind, but in order to have something
available for early tomorrow morning,
I've gone ahead with this admittedly’
imperfect draft.

STATE HUMANE SLAUGHTER ACT

Recently the general public has been much concerned over the use of old-
fashioned, out-dated slaughtering methods which bring a needlessly cruel death
to livestock. In addition to the cruelty, statistics have shown an excessively
high accident rate among packing house workers and meat loss through improper
handling and inefficiency. This concern has resulted in a demand for legislation
to speed the use of acceptable methods throughout the packing industry. Public
interest and pressure on Congress resulted in the passage of federal legislation-—
Public Law 85-765 (7 U.S.C.A., sec. 1901-6) establishing the use of humane methods
in the slaughter of livestock.

The federal law will affect only those packers selling to the U. S. Government,
leaving the greater number of packers subject only to state legislation. In 1959,
a number of humane slaughter bills have been introduced in the various state
legislatures with varying provisions . Continuance of such uncoordinated pro—
pOsals will only cause confusion. California, Minnesota, Washington and Wis-
consin have already enacted humane slaughter laws in 1959. To simplify com—
pliance and to promote the adoption of acceptable methods, a suggested state
humane slaughter act, conforming in general to the federal law, would make
available the same acceptable methods to all packers, working under federal or
state laws and regulations.

Purpose of the federal legislation, Public Law 85-765, is to:

1. Prevent needless suffering of animals at the time
of slaughter;

2. Provide safer and better working conditions for
persons engaged in the slaughtering industry;

3. Bring about improvement of products and economies
in slaughtering operations;

4. Produce other benefits for producers, processors
and consumers which tend to expedite an orderly
ﬂow of livestock and livestock products in inter—
state and foreign commerce.

When certain provisions of Public Law 85-765 become effective June 30, 1960,
the affected packers must use methods designated by the Secretary of Agriculture.
The Federal Register of March 3, 1959, designates three methods as humane.
They are:

 

Chemical (the use of carbon dioxide gas for sheep and swine);

 




60 Suggested State Legislation

Mechanical (the use of captive-bolt stunners or gunshot on sheep, swine,
goats, calves, cattle, horses and mules);

Electrical (the stunning of swine, sheep, calves and cattle with electric
current).

The suggested state act will provide for use of similar tested and accepted
methods of humane slaughter.

The suggested state law will exempt slaughtering in accordance with ritual
requirements of the Jewish faith or any other religious faith, so as to avoid any
interference with religious freedom. It further exempts the individual farmer
who may slaughter an occasional animal for his own food by defining a slaughterer
as "any person regularly engaged in the commercial slaughtering of live stock."

Suggested Legislation

 

L'I‘itle should conform to state requirements.
The following is a suggestion: "An not to provide for
the humane slaughter of livestock."..i

(Be it enacted, etc.)

Section 1. The Llegislature of this state: finds that the use of humane
methods in the slaughter of livestock prevents needless suffering; results in
safer and better working conditions for persons engaged in the slaughtering
mdUSth; brings about improvement of products and economy in slaughtering
Operations; and produces other benefits for producers, processors and con-
sumers which tend to expedite the orderly ﬂow of livestock and their products.

It is therefore declared to be the policy of the state of C __J to
require that the slaughter of all livestock and the handling of livestock, in con-
nection with slaughter, shall be carried out only by humane methods and to
Provide that methods of slaughter shall conform generally to those employed
in other states where humane slaughter is required by law and to those author—
ized by the Federal Humane Slaughter Act of 1958, and regulations thereunder,

(and any amendments thereto): Provided, however, that the use of a man-
ually operated hammer, sledge or poleax is declared to be an inhumane
method of slaughter within the meaning of this act.

Section 6. Any person who violates any provision of this act shall, upon
conviction thereof, be punished by a fine of not more than [: jdollars,

or by imprisonment for not more than E Zdays, or both.

New York-—\\7hat is really at stake in the issue of
Vietnam? I submit that the following propositions are the
basic ones and that it is really the duty of educators to
studv the historical data relevant to them before they

a

educate about the subject of Vietnam.

(1) The Republic of Vietnam—South Vietnam,“
became independent after a struggle against the colonial
power of France. This happened between 1954—55.

(2) This Republic did not, as the US. did not, be—
come a signatory to the Geneva Accords of 1954. It is not
bound by them.

(3) The anti-colonial struggle in Vietnam included
many elements, among them being bona—fide nationalists,
Communists and others. In the north, above the 17th
Parallel, the Communists won out. They successfully de-
feated the French and murdered nationalists and others

Traffic Trickery

Franklin Square—I consider myself a lawabiding citi—
zen, which includes obeying traffic laws. Today I was given
a summons for passing a “full stOp” sign. Technically I’m
guilty, it justice is as cut and dried as that.

_ I’ve been living in Franklin Square for more than
eight years, and I’ve been traveling over the same street
(Oaks Drive) twice a day. For the last week I have been
onvacation, and this morning as I drove down the street
toward Franklin‘Avenue once again, a brand new full stop
Sign suddenly stared me in the, face. At that same instant I
Saw a patrol car just waiting to spring on some innocent
motorist who, not knowing a stop sign had recently been
posted, would ride right past it. .

I tried to explain to the officer that I didn’t expect to
see a stop sign and, with all the trees along this residential
street, Ididn’t notice it until I was on top of it. Instead
of saying to me, “All right, but watch it next time,” the
officer'gave me-a summons as though the violation were
done on purpose. . .

Why should the police department have to resort to
trickery? A policeman should not be posted there for two
or three weeks, so that everyone is given the opportunity
to notice the new sign. ' —Harold A. Goldberg

Glib Words

New Hyde Park—Honor, face, commitment: how
glibly these words are spoken by Mr. Johnson, Mr. Mc-
Namara and‘Mr. Rusk. They were spoken as glibly by
Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin and Hirohito. And each time that
they are spoken, young men are led into the pit of death,
there to remain until their once—pulsating living bodies
turn. into corpses.

This too shall pass; a peace shall come. Each side will
save a little honor, some face, and have fulfilled its com—
mitment. Then again: honor, face, commitment, spoken
just as glibly.“ ,

NVhen? When will it be that we defend the honor of
young men, the faces of young men, and'the young men’s
commitment to life? ' ' —F. W'underlich

_ DECEMBER 7, 1965:

HUMANE SLAUGHTER MEETING-IN ALBANY. People present: Mr. Kleinstuber,
Mr. Naramore, Mr. Wager, Mr. Mapel, Hrs. halter, Mr. westlako, Hr. Ripley,
Mr. Hardenbrook, and Mr. Cell.

03 plane was late, so there had been a long discussion before CS got there
and CS had the impression that they were fully prepared to support removing
the small animals in kosher slaughter. However, Mr. Nepal said that it was
against the law for the Agriculture Department to make any statement about
its position onta bill prior to introduction. Once introduced, however, if

. asked for an opinion, it would be given officially. Thus if the some opinion
were given and the Committee decided to amend the bill, then this would be
removed from the jurisdiction of the how York State Humane Association. ‘Ke
further pointed out that if this were done, Opponents might attack the sec-
tion about the small animals, which, if removed, would then leave the way
somewhat clearer since part of the force of their opposition would have been
spent.

Mr. Eardonbrook had assumed that if the part about the small animals were
stricken, there would be no conceition from Orthodox Jewish groups. jhr.
Mapel made it clear that there would be just as much opposition from Agudes
Israel and other similar groups. ‘

Mr. Naramore asked for a motion to strike the part relating to small animals
killed kosher, but Mr. Mapel said that he would vote against such a resolu-
tion. A long discussion ensued, the final result of which was that Mr.
Naramore asked for a resolution to have the bill introduced as it stood. CS
made such a motion, and it was seconded after a long pause by Mr. Kleinstuber,
who mentioned in ascending it that this was being fair to the people who came
to Bath. hrs.‘Wa1ter then stated that if we were going to put the bill in as
it was, there is no need for any motion of any'kind; and Mr. Mapel said that
was a good idea. Mr. Wager made one last desperate attempt to have a motion
stating that the bill should go in as is but that we all agreed to see it
amended. However, after more discussion, this motion was dropped. Mr. Mapel
said he wanted it understood that though he would vote to have the bill intro—
duced as it was, he also would agree to an amendment to drop the small animals.

do said he had talked with John.H. Stone, Assistant Commissioner on Livestock,
and George Gloming, Assistant Counsel, and they had consulted with several
others, including Dr. Jennings, the meat inspector. GS tried to reach Dr.
Jennings before leaving, but he was out of town for the week. Mrs. Walter
agreed to try to make an appoinmnent for CS and her to see Leo O‘Brien.

Malcolm Ripley, after the meeting was over, said that Rey'Naramore had told
him that there would be no hearings on the laboratory animal bill this year,
that there was too much opposition, and that, therefore, it had been dropped.
However, he did not know the source; but it seems almost certain that it must
be Jo Morgan.

 




JOINT COUNCIL FOR HUMANE LEGISLATION
17 WEST 60TH STREET - NEW YORK, N. Y. 10023

ARE WE LESS HUMANE THAN THE ISRAELIS?

March 21, 1965

ISRAEL BANS U.S. MEAT
Brands All U.S. Meat "Non-Kosher"
Cites Brutal U.S. Slaughtering Methods

Israel bans the importation of all 0.5. meat, terming it ”non-kosher"

because of the cruelty with which animals are handled prior to the ritual killing.

Humane Slaughter Legislationin
New York Opposed by Orthodox Rabbinate.

Speaking for about 1% of New York
State's population, Orthodox Rabbinical
groups claim that humane methods could
increase the price of kosher meat and
thereby cause Orthodox Jews to abandon
dietary observances.

On this basis, they term humane
slaughter bills an attempt to abridge
religious freedom. These charges
intimidate many legislators and the
bills do not pass. But, can we permit
our concept of religious freedom to
focus on possible fluctuations in the
price of meat?

The only religious problem invOlved
in our slaughtering methods is Israel's
condemnation that:

New York kosher meat is not truly
kosher.

According to Israeli standards
kosher killing means solicitude for the
welfare of God's animals, both before
and during the ritual act of killing.
The animal must be fully conscious, but
unbruised and unbroken.

In the ritual act itself (shechita)

the animal's throat is slit swiftly and
painlessly by a shochet (kosher meat
‘1‘“8hterer) under the supervision of a
rabbi.

This method is accepted by humani-
tarians of all faiths as humane and is
not in question.

Members: FRIENDS
THE HUMAN

 

Sadistic Slaughter in New York.
New York Orthodox Rabbis condone the
sadistic handling of animals prior to
the ritual killing - described in the
enclosed reprint written by 3 232222?
who implores the New York Rabbis to
forego their evil ways.

The method the shochet describes
produces the meat branded by the
Israeli Government as non-kosher,
but which the Orthodox Rabbinate of
New York labels kosher.

The New York Rabbinate accepts
horribly brutalized animals as "kosher"
meat - except those where nostrils were
actually pulled loose by the iron
clamps, or backs and legs were broken
in the handling. In these instances -
and they are many - the New York
Rabbis pay lip-service to their
religion by throwing the whole animal
on the non-kosher pile as unfit for
their Orthodox flock, but perfectly
all right for any one else. '

What Can be Done to Step This
Shocking Brutality Which Degrades Men,
Mocks a Great Religion, and Tortures
Animals?

Methods for the humane handling
of animals prior to any slaughter -
ordinary or ritual - are in use in
Israel, Canada, Europe and many other
countries throughout the world. Their
use takes away searing pain. And, in
the long run, they provide for more
efficient and economical slaughterhouse
operation. (OVER...

Voluntarism_gr Legislation?

A few Rabbinical groups spoke out,
years ago, for the voluntary use of
humane methods. Nothing has been done
in New York to date. That is why
legislation is needed.

Are There Any Humane Slaughter Bills
Now in Albany?
There are two. Both are excellent.

Assembly Intro 2398, sponsored by
Senator Robert W. Pomeroy and
Assemblyman.A1bert J. Hausbeck.

This bill requires the use of
humane methods in all slaughterhouses
in the state. It would eliminate the
agonizing shackle-and-hoist of conscious
animals which is peculiar to the New
York "kosher" method.

It would also and suffering in
non~kosher slaughterhouses where
animals are bludgeoned with many blows
into unconsciousness and where pigs
are dropped, often still conscious,
into scalding water.

Slaughterers have three years from
this date in which to install humane
methods. ,

 

Assembly Intro 3711, also sponsored
by Senator Pomeroy and Assemblyman Hausbeck,
is an alternate to the first bill. It
requires the use of humane methods only
in non-kosher slaughtering. But it
also protects humanitarians from the
unknowing purchase of meat which has
been killed by the so-called "kosher"
shackle-and-hoist method. It requires
humane handldng prior to ritual
slaughter if the product is to be sold
on the open market as well as to the
kosher trade.

In the absence of humane handling,
the bill requires that the product be
sold only as "kosher."

This provision limiting sales will
cause "kosher" slaughterers to use
humane methods because in the United
States only the forequarters of each
animals is now labeled "kosher" - the
hindquarters always being sold as non-
kosher on the open market.

In Both Bills, Shechita, Jewdsh.Ritual
Killin Is Fully Protected and
Respected Throughout.

WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP

1. Call on the Neerork Orthodox Rabbinate to cease its opposition to humane
slaughter legislation. Address your protest to the Rabbinical Council of

America, 84 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y.

bills will

(a) protect helpless animals.

Point out that passage of these

(b) remove New York Jews from unsought and.undeserved
involvement in cruelty to animals.

(0) ensure the Orthodox faithful of meat killed according
to the ancient Jewish traditions.

Write your own Senator, your own Assemblyman do vote for these 131118. Also
write the Chairman of the.Agriculture Committee in the Assembly to put these

bills before the whole legislative body.

Address them all care of

Th3 Capitol, Albany: New York. If you do not know the names of your
legislators, your local newspaper will tell you.

Talk to leaders of church groups, clubs and ask them to send official letters

to the legislature endorsing the bills.

.Ask your newspaper to print editorials.

Send a contribution if you can to the Joint Council for Humane Legislation,

Brutality Toward Animals
and Shechita

By (Schohet) Benjamin Rosen

S hackling

The heavy animals such as steers, cows
and bulls are driven into a pen (an enclosure
for animals) by a cattle driver. When they
don’t ”walk fast enough to suit him he prods
them along with the help of a heavy whip
or a shocking rod. This rod is an ingenious
device invented by a sadist to shock the ani-
mals into obedience. It is a metallic round
hollow rod containing electric batteries and
a switch. When a cattle driver has difﬁcul-
ties with a steer he pushes the rod against
its hind part including the rectum if neces—
sary and opens the switch, thus giving the
steer- an electric shock. This treatment
arches the entire spine of the animal and
makes him quiver with pain and safe for
shackling.

Then a man called a shackler takes an
iron chain, loops it skillfully around the hind
legs of the animal, pulls it through a ring
at the end of the chain, and connects it to
the hook of a long heavy chain suspended
from the ceiling which can be raised and
lowered by electricity. The animal is then
hoisted up in the air by its hind legs with
the rest of the body and head suspended
downwards. The animal is slaughtered while
haIlg'ing in the air suspended by its hind legs
with the head at the right height for the
shochet to reach it.

Hoisting

In order to do this properly it must be
forced to remain perfectly still during the
time of slaughter. To render it incapable .of
movement, a rope is attached to one of its
front legs then tied securely to the wall by
means of pulley and hooks while the head
is made secure and immobile in the following
horrible fashion (pay close attention to this?.
A plier with an iron hook at either end is

inserted in the animal’s nostril, tightened
against its mucus. The plier is then pulled
by a rope and secured to the opposite wall
so that the front leg is pulled to one wall
while the head with the help of the hook
is pulled to the other wall, thus subjecting
it to the most excruciating pain imaginable.
Many times the entire nostril is torn away
when the steer tries to loose himself from
the torture. The animal generally screams
and bellows with agonizing pain until the
Shochet cuts its throat thus putting it out
of its misery.

Humaneness of Shechita

The law pertaining to Shechita certainly
is humane. However, there is no speciﬁed
law concerning the handling of animals prior
to Shechita unless we will apply the law of
cruelty to animals. It is inconceivable that
the Torah which took every precaution to
eliminate this cruelty in the process of
slaughtering should be completely indifferent
to the cruelties inﬂicted on the animals in
the preparation thereof. Does itmake any
difference whether the pain is inﬂicted on
the windpipe during Shechita or on the nos-
tril or any other part of the anatomy prior
to and during the slaughter?

The fact is that the brutal handling of
animals prior to Shechita is a product of
the 20th century machine-age speed up sys-
tem. The ones who developed this method
are the packers. They were not interested
in cruelty to animals. Their main interest
was and is expediency, quicker and cheaper
methods of disposing of the animals. Had
these methods been prevalent during the
time of the Talmud, the Rabbis would have
deﬁnitely put a stop to it. They would have
deﬁned and spelled out rules governing hu-
mane handling of animals prior to Shechita.
The only ones gaining out of leaving mat-
ters as they are, are the packers, since it
would involve quite an expense to install
new humane methods. It is the responsibil-
ity of the Rabbis to eliminate this evil. The
Torah laid down the principles. Let us be
guided by them.

Humane Slaughter
ASPCA sponsors

The American Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals this year is sponsor of
a humane slaughter bill in the New York
legislature.

Introduced in the Senate (Senate Intro-
ductory 4393) and in the Assembly (As-
sembly Introductory 5995), the companion
bills are receiving wide support, particularly
among orthodox Jewish groups which in
the past have been known to be fearful of
similar legislation.

The full text of S. I. 4393, as amended,
(which is the same as the Assembly com-
panion measure) is printed on the outside
back cover.

In sponsoring the bill, which would become
effective January 1, 1966, the ASPCA char-
acterizes it as a measure which “for the ﬁrst
time offers to the people of the State of
New York an economical, defensible, and
persuasive law to eliminate the two most
inhumane features of food-animal slaughter-
house practices.”

The practices are manual slugging of ani-
mals with a hammer, sledge 0r pole ax, and
shackling and hoisting conscious creatures
that otherwise can be humanely and pain-
lessly positioned for butchering.

A Clear Proposal

The ASPCA notes that amendments to the
original Senate bill have resulted in a much
clearer and more comprehensive proposal.
For many suggested improvements of the
0r1gina1 measure, the Society is indebted to
half a dozen lawyers and sincere humanitar-
ians who are not even members of the
ASPCA. Some of these individuals had been
strong supporters of earlier 1965 humane-
Slaughter legislation introduced in Albany
but apparently vigorously and controllingly
opposed by religious and commercial forces.

Over the last half-dozen years, the path-

 

way toward humane handling of slaughter-
house animals has been a torturous and frus-
trating one for humanitarians.

In 1958 the Congress of the United States
enacted a so-called humane slaughter law
which, under the Constitution, could apply
only to animals used in livestock products
purchased by agencies of the Federal Govern-
ment. Subsequent to passage of the national
law, 16 states enacted similar legislation.
Scores of times since 1958, however, in
states all over the Union, similar laws have
been uniformly proposed but uniformly and
consistently have failed of passage.

In the State of New York alone since 1959
a dozen or more “humane slaughter” bills
have died in committee. Not one has come
before the Senate or the Assembly for a vote.

The American Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals consistently has de-
plored major slaughterhouse inhumanities.
This Society was in the forefront when the
Federal legislation was enacted, and over the
years has given support to humane slaughter
bills introduced in Albany.

Kosher Slaughter Humane

Beginning some ten years ago, human-
itarians, religious leaders of all faiths and
processors of meat struggled together in ef-
forts to define, by public law, what the words
“humane method” should mean as a guide to
relief of pain and anguish suffered by ani-
mals killed to feed mankind. Out of this
struggle came the Federal law and the 16
state statutes, but in the enactment of every
one of these laws it became necessary to iso-
late and then disassociate deep historic reli-
gious practices from what otherwise would

° C‘ ,7
have constltuted one over-all humane

method of coping with the problem at issue.

The kosher ritual of instantaneous death
to a conscious animal is in itself a humane
act. The cruelty lies only in the means by




which the animal is positioned for such
slaughter: the hoisting and shackling of a
conscious, frightened, struggling animal.

From the humane point of view, over the
years the vice of non-kosher slaughtering has
been the use of hammers, sledges, and pole
axes to beat an animal into insensibility;
whereas animal pain and suffering attendant
to kosher slaughter stemmed from the fact
that life could be claimed only from a fully
conscious creature. In the United States under
public law coupled with slaughterhouse eco-
nomics, this has meant that the animal had to
be shackled and hoisted in presentation for
the ritual of death.

Legislative Dilemma

In this dilemma, legislation consonant with
preservation of religious freedom could have
resulted—and did result—only in a “hu-
mane method” solution which exempted the
cruel shackling and hoisting attendant to
ritualistic slaughter of all conscious animals.
This pleased nobody, least of all, perhaps,
those orthodox Jewish leaders who for genera-
tions have deplored the necessity for the
shackling and hoisting.

All over the United States for the last half-
dozen years, important and influential seg-
ments of the Jewish community have smarted
under innuendos that their method of food-
animal slaughter was both cruel and inhu-
mane. As a result, what might and should
have been a united crusade against inhu-
manity flared into a ﬁre of emotional human
conflict. The ASPCA at times was party to
this sort of thing. No humane slaughter bill
had a chance of passage in such an atmos-
phere.

A new perspective is found in the ASPCA
bill in Albany. For the first time ever, the
Senate and Assembly companion bill turns
abruptly away from hitherto unsuccessful
and frustrating efforts exclusively to legislate

r Bill Is Introduced

r3 a new concept in Albany

humane methods of slaughtering animals.
Instead, it soberly outlines public policy, next
speciﬁes humane methods of slaughter, and
then spells out and prohibits inhumane meth-
ods. Thus, in a few short but clear para-
graphs it illuminates that which is right and
then forbids only that which is wrong.

Section 96-cc of the proposed law outlaws
and prohibits manual slugging, and, so far
as now is practicable, does the same with
shackling and hoisting.

No Need for Cruelty

First it should be noted that in New York
State today there remains not a shred of jus-
tiﬁcation for using a hammer or a sledge or
a pole ax on any animal. A dozen or more
government-approved substitute instruments
and devices for instantaneous and painless
animal stunning are available at cost so mod-
est as to be within the means even of the
small farmer who butchers his own animals.
Thus the clear language of Section 96-cc-1 is
not legally, economically or morally arguable.

Remaining for comment here is the matter
of outlawing the shackling and hoisting of
conscious creatures in preparation for slaugh-
ter in a manner consonant with uninterrupted
continuation of historical ritualistic practices
and at the same time comfortably within re-
strictions of public law. To the extent that
this inhumanity may be curbed with no of—
fense even to the economics of the packing
industry, Section 96-cc-2 is to the point. Of
practical as well as religious necessity the
legal prohibition of 96-cc-2 cannot apply cur-
rently to the handling of calves and sheep,
but it would apply to all other animals. Later,
appropriate and timely expansion of the cov-
erage to eliminate the exception as to calves
and sheep would pose only an insigniﬁcant
bill-drafting problem.

On the subject of shackling and hoisting
The American Society for the Prevention of

Cruelty to Animals can speak authoritatively.

This problem embraces kosher slaughter-
houses, non-kosher slaughterhouses, and
establishments practicing both methods of
butchering.

One of the legislative stumbling blocks
over the years with respect to shackling and
hoisting has been that under the requirements
of Jewish ritualistic slaughter all animals
must be conscious at the moment of death.
This does not hold true with respect to ani-
mals slaughtered in a nonritualistic manner.

Holding Pen Available
Since May 1, 1964, the ASPCA has had

exclusive rights to a proved, economical de-
vice eliminating shackling and hoisting of
conscious large beef animals. License to use
this device is offered royalty-free and without
proﬁt to the Society to any slaughterhouse
anywhere. This ASPCA Holding Pen is adapt-
able for both kosher and non-kosher opera-
tions and now is functioning on a money-sav-
ing basis in four slaughterhouses, no one of
which is in New York. Each of the four in-
stallations has been hailed by the Rabbinical
Council of America as an “unprecedented
contribution” and as “a dramatic break-
through in the problem of preparing and
handling animals for slaughter.”

Availability of the beef-animal holding pen
now justiﬁes legislation prohibiting shack-
llng and hoisting of such animals in all except
small slaughterhouses for which purchase and
installation of the large holding pen patently

James H. Jenkins, ASPCA president, accepts citation to
Rabbinical Council of America. Joining in the Presenmm" “re'
Kowalsk'y, Rabbi Emanuel Holzer, Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik, R
and William Mapel, ASPCA administrative vice president-

 

would be an unbearable ﬁnancial burden.
Therefore, the Senate and Assembly bills
exempt commercial establishments ritually
slaughtering fewer than 20 beef animals per
week, and also exempts the farmer who
slaughters his own animals.

It is not necessary to exempt the small
slaughterhouse processing fewer than 20 ani-
mals per week in non-ritualistic slaughtering
because such an establishment can render
animals unconscious before slaughter in a hu-
mane and proved method—making use of
one of the aforementioned instruments or de-
vices for instantaneous and painless stunning.

Since November, 1963, the ASPCA has
been working on a small-pen device for
elimination of shackling and hoisting of
sheep, lambs and calves, none of which can
be accommodated in the large-animal pen
because of the smaller size of all of these ani-
mals as well as the fact that sheep and lambs
must be presented for slaughter in a radically
different position from that workable for beef
animals, and with much greater rapidity.

Currently, construction of a prototype of
the ASPCA Small Animal Pen is nearing
completion in Cincinnati. It will shortly be
tested with living animals at the College of
Agriculture of The Ohio State University.

Concurrently, the Society has shipped to
Cincinnati for reﬁnement and testing another
device for which it has the rights. One of the
latter small-animal pens admittedly will not
meet the requirements of large slaughter-
houses, but it might sufﬁce for smaller opera-

tions or twin installations might even be eco-
nomically feasible for the larger establish-
ments.

It would be imprudent to forecast, or be
led to believe, that either small animal pen
will be proved and marketable within the
near future. ASPCA designers and engineers
haVe overcome certain obstacles, but until
liVe testing takes place, it is dangerous to be
tOO sanguine. For example, when the device
Was ﬁrst operated with dead weights instead
0f liVing animals, two deﬁciencies called for
more powerful activating elements. These
Were ordered immediately.

In light of the foregoing, it will be noted
that shackling and hoisting of calves and
Sheep being positioned for ritual slaughter IS

not presently to be prohibited in the new
bill and the Jewish people are therefore not
denied such a part of their present kosher-
killed meat diet.

When the ASPCA small pen or any other
successfully developed similar device can be
made available to the meat industry following
an appropriate ﬁnding by the Commissioner
of Agriculture and Markets, the Society hopes
New York law will be amended to make its
coverage 100 per cent.

Reference was previously made to many
years of orthodox Jewish opposition to hu-
mane slaughter bills introduced in the New
York State Legislature. Such opposition has
been strong, unified and controlling.

With the introduction of the ASPCA’s new

5

 

 

 




 

bill opposition has turned into cooperation.

Admittedly no one institution—be it in
the Jewish Community or in the humane
movement—can guarantee spokesmanship
for all concerned. Those Who hear or read
testimony, therefore, can only seek to weigh
that which is presented.

When the ASPCA—~acting on its own
and assuming no more—~sought to bring
about acceptable and workable humane
slaughter legislation in the State of New
York in 1965 the Society solicited and re-
ceived critical but cooperative attention from
ofﬁcers of, and attorneys for, the Rabbinical
Council of America and the Jewish National

Community Relations Advisory Council. As-
suredly these two nationwide organizations
are representative of serious orthodox think-
ing on religious policy.

With permission, the ASPCA quotes from
an ofﬁcial letter to a third party over the sig-
nature of the Executive Vice-President of the
Rabbinical Council of America, as follows:

“It should interest you that Senate Bill
#4393, introduced by the ASPCA, which
would outlaw shackling and hoisting, is a far
better bill and one which we would ﬁnd most
acceptable. May we suggest that if your in-
terest is animal welfare, that you support Sen-

ate Bill #4393.”

 

Members and friends of the ASPCA
are entitled to know the status of Sen-
ate Introductory 4393 and Assembly
Introductory 5995 and the course this
bill must follow to become law.

In the Senate, the bill was introduced
by the Rules Committee of which Sen-
ator Joseph Zaretzki is chairman. The
bill was referred to the Agriculture and
Markets Committee whose chairman is
Senator Paul P. E. Bookson.

In the Assembly, Introductory 5995
was referred to the Rules Committee of
which Anthony J. Travia is chairman.

The measure might be taken up si-
multaneously in both houses or separ-
ately in either house. First, however, it
has to emerge from committee.

In any event, the bill must be passed
by both houses before going to the
Governor for signing. The immediate
Objective is to get the bills reported out

favorably from either or both com-
mittees.

Members and friends of the ASPCA
should know that the Society——throu:‘=’§h
its lawyers, legal briefs, and personal
contact involving the President, other
ofﬁcers, and certain members of the
Board of Managers — has made ofﬁcial
and strong representation in Albany
with respect not only to the humane
slaughter bill but also other bills hav-

 

The Status of the ASPCA Bill

ing to do with the Society, its activities,
and its responsibilities.

In light of the foregoing, the Society
has not asked its members to indulge
in a widespread barrage of communica-
tions to Senators and Assemblymen. The
ASPCA welcomes any personal attention
given to legislation by identified con-
stituents who address themselves directly
to their own representatives or their
own personal friends in either house of
the Legislature. Advices from Albany
to the Society are that the ofﬁcial posi-
tion of the ASPCA always is solicited
and that individual Senators and Assem-
blymen constantly are interested in
knowing the personal opinions of their
own constituents.

Senator Bookson particularly re-
quested that he be relieved of the re-
sponsibility of acknowledging a host of
ASPCA letters in support of the hu-
mane slaughter bill.

“We have the whole story ofﬁcially
from your ofﬁcers and your attorneys,”
he said. “I am mindful of the efforts
the ASPCA is making to solve a difﬁcult
and delicate problem. You may be sure
your bill is not being overlooked. As
amended, it was one of the last bills
referred to our committee. It already
is receiving serious attention and will
continue to do so. You will be hearing

from us.”

 

 




 

EDITORIAL
Live and Let Live

It is serious and practiced policy of the
ASPCA not to be publicly critical of other
societies or institutions in the humane field or
of any of their leaders.

The ASPCA holds that if individuals or
organizations share a deep and sincere con-
cern for the welfare of animals this should be
, the determining factor toward working to-
gether to achieve the ultimate in welfare for
the creatures we cherish so much.

Thus, the ASPCA does not indulge in
name-calling or in ridicule of those whose
different pathways to the common goal at
times may seem strange. Unfortunately this
philosophy frequently does not work both
ways. Consequently, many of those who love
the ASPCA deplore the compounding of libel
and slander of the Society. This is particularly
true when fair acknowledgment of careless
or reckless falsiﬁcation is not forthcoming
after the truth has been made known to those
responsible for the defamation.

It is human nature not to take kindly to
such treatment. Nevertheless, it is the con-
sidered judgment of those of us who devote
our time to the leadership of the ASPCA that
when animal lovers spend their time quarrel-
ing one with another the real suffering comes
to the animals who thus are neglected.

The operation of the ASPCA is entrusted
to professional custodians of animal welfare.
Neither these men and women nor the ASPCA
as a whole can have the Society’s resources
diverted to time-consuming low-level con-
troversy.

On occasion, however, it becomes neces-
sary to highlight transparently deliberate
and harmful activity.

Speciﬁcally, this issue of Animal Protec-
tion is devoted in large part to a careful
analysis of a humane slaughter bill now up
for action in the New York State Legislature.
The ASPCA was able to sponsor this measure
only after our Society had made long strides
toward providing, royalty-free and without

 

proﬁt to the ASPCA, devices to eliminate
shackling and hoisting of millions of con-
scious slaughterhouse animals.

Many members of the Legislature have
Spoken approvingly of the ASPCA bill, but
some of them — as well as some of our own
members— have inquired about propaganda
which has been interpreted as arguing that
the devices now made available to the
slaughterhouse industry are unnecessary. The
statement has been circulated widely, by per-
sons who refer to themselves as friends of
animals, (1) that a cheap canvas sling is
available for positioning large beef animals
and (2) that a prominent packing house
when located in New York kosher-killed 3800
lambs per day by using a trough rather than
by shackling and hoisting these animals for
slaughter.

These statements are utterly false.

There is no sling available to packers to
immoblize and dispatch large beef animals
that has proved practical to the industry.

As for the slaughtering of 3800 lambs in
a day, the ASPCA talked with four 30-year
employees of the corporation which allegedly
did this by use of a trough. All of these men
worked on the New York job. All are still
with the company.

“Who dreamed that one up?” one man
asked. “Yes, we ran 3800 through but we
shackled and hoisted all of them. There
wasn’t, and isn’t, any other available kosher
way to do it.”

The ASPCA has an official company con-
ﬁrmation of this statement.

Perhaps forever the ASPCA must smart
and at times suffer from the diatribes of
individuals who dislike us. When, however,
such utterances, as in this case, strike at an
effort to relieve animal pain and suffering
and threaten the passage of legislation de-
votedly sought by dedicated humanitarians,
our members and friends at least should
have the truth.

SENATE INTRODUCTORY 4393 *

AN ACT

to amend the agriculture and markets law, in relation to the humane slaughtering of livestock.
The people of the State of New York represented in the Senate and Assembly do enact as follows:

Section 1. The agriculture and markets law is hereby amended by inserting therein a new
article ﬁve-c, to read as follows:

ARTICLE S-C
HUMANE SLAUGHTERING 0F ANIMALS

Section 96-aa. Declaration of legislative determination and policy.
96~bb. Deﬁnition of humane method.
96-cc. Inhumane methods of slaughter prohibited.
96-dd. Application of article.
96-ee. Administration; violations.

§ 96-aa. Declaration of legislative determination and policy. The legislature of this state hereby
ﬁnds that the use of humane methods in the slaughter of livestock prevents needless suffering;
results in safer and better working conditions for persons engaged in the slaughtering industry;
brings about improvement of products and economy in slaughtering operations; and produces
other beneﬁts for producers, processors and consumers which tend to expedite the orderly ﬂow of
livestock and their products. It is therefore declared to be the policy of the state of New York to
require that the slaughter of all livestock and the handling of livestock, in connection with slaughter,
shall be carried out only by humane methods as and when such methods shall be made available
to commercial slaughterhouses.

§ 96-bb. Deﬁnition of humane method. Either of the following two methods of slaughtering and
handling is hereby found to be humane: (l) in the case of cattle, calves, horses, mules, sheep,
swine, and other livestock, all animals are rendered insensible to pain by a single blow or gunshot
or an electrical, chemical or other means that is rapid and effective, before being shackled, hoisted,
thrown, cast, or cut; or (2) by slaughtering in accordance with the ritual requirements of the
Jewish faith or any other religious faith that prescribes a method of slaughter whereby the animal
suffers loss of consciousness by anemia of the brain caused by the simultaneous and instantaneous
severance of the carotid arteries with a sharp instrument.

§ 96-cc. lnhumane methods of slaughter prohibited. The following are .declared to be inhumane
methods of slaughter within the meaning of this article and therefore are 1n all Instances prohibited.

1. Using a manually operated hammer, sledge or pole ax as a means of slaughtering any
animal or of rendering any animal unconscious in preparation for slaughter.

2. Shackling and hoisting or hanging any animal while such animal is conscious, in the
positioning of such animal for slaughter.

§ 96-dd. Application of article. Subdivision 2 of Section 96-cc shall not. apply (1) ‘0 any bona ﬁde
farmer who butchers his own domestic animals on his farm, 1101‘ (2) in .order to meec‘ freedom
of religion, shall it apply (a) to the operator of a commercial establishment wnth respect to
the positioning of no more than 20 conscious beef animals per week .for “ma! slaughter as such
term is deﬁned in subdivision (2) of section ninety~six~bb of this .article; and (db) wilth respect
to calves and sheep being positioned for ritual slaughter as heremabove define unti one year
after the commissioner ﬁnds that there is available at reasonable cost a ritually acceptable,
Praeticable and humane method of handling or otherwise preparing conscro us calves and sheep for
slaughter. The ﬁndings of the commissioner in the application at: wah subdmswn shall 1136 subject to
review in the manner provided by article seventy-eight of the ClVll practice law and ru es.

§ 96-ee. Administration; violations.

1. The commissioner shall promulgate and from time to time revise rules and. regulations in
connection with this article, and may, by administrative order, exempt “‘3’“ compliance W‘th “118
article, for a period of not to exceed one year after the effective date of this article, any slaughter”
or packer if in the judgment of the commissioner earlier compliance would cause undue hardship.

2. Any violation of the provisions of this article or of the rules and. regulations promulgated
by the commissioner thereunder shall be deemed a misdemeanor.

§2. This act shall take effect January ﬁrst, nineteen hundred and sixty-Six.

liberty in the United States of America, it is hereby declared that the
provisions of this article shall apply only to persons certified as
”non-kosher slaughterers“ by the Commissioner of Agriculture. Each
slaughterer shall apply to the Commissioner of Agriculture for a
certificate of Iauthorization to engage in either "kosher slaughtering”

or ”non-kosher slaughtering." The certificate shall be issued in
accordance with the request of the applicant except that each slaughterer
shall receive only one certificate. No livestock, or part of any
livestock, slaughtered under certification of fknxhsxkxshaki ”non-kosher"
Shall be sold as "kosher." No livestock, or part of any livestock,
slaughtered under certification of "kosher" shall be sold as “non-kosher,"
except that the Commissioner of Agriculture shall authorize kosher
slaughterers who have installed methods for the painless handling of
animals prior to slaughter to sell as "non-kosher” the hindquarters of
animals. The determination of such painless methods of handling shall

be under the jurisdiction of the New York Board of Rabbis.

Definitions. . . .
a The term "kosher" means a method in accordance with ritual

requirements of the Jewish faith.
b. The term "non-kosher" means any method of slaughter other

than a method in accordance with ritual requirements of the Jewish faith.

NCQES ON SLAUGHTER BILL AMENDMENT:

About 250 of New York State's 270 slaughterhouses are now kosher.
This perhaps gives the Rabbis the feeling that the conduct of this
business is primarily their concern. However, it should not be over-
looked that only about 2% of the meat produced in kosher slaughterhouses
is sold as kosher. Clearly, then, the handling of these animals prior
to slaughter is a matter of deep concern to all the peOple of this
State and must be given expression through their voice, the State
Legislature.

The allegations of religious bigotry as the motivation in seeking
humane handling of animals prior to slaughter are very disturbing and
what is needed to put the question on a rational basis is to separate
religion from economics. The prOposed amendment accomplishes this
because kosher slaughterers are exempt from the provisions and otherwise
too there can be no religious objections because the price of kosher
meat is unaffected.

The classification of slaughterhouses as either ”kosher" or
"non-kosher" is simple and in no way disrupts the production of meat.
The effect of the kosher exemption would be to reduce the number of
kosher slaughterhouses to that which is needed to supply only the
kosher market - about 8, depending on the size of the slaughterhouses
(there are approximately 300,000 purchasers of kosher meat) It will
be far easier for the Rabbis to obtain voluntary installation of
restraining pens in 8 slaughterhouses than in 250. With such
installations of pens the price of meat will be unaffected since
the bill permits the sale of hindquarters of meat as ”non-kosher”
by slaughterhouses which have painless methods of handling animals

prior to slaughter.

A primary justification for this bill is this: New York law
is filled with protections for the purchasers of kosher meat. There
can therefore be no logical objections to the request for similar
protections for purchasers of non-kosher meat, particularly if it
is borne in mind that, under Jewish law, animals whose backs and
legs are broken as they are shackled and hoisted may not be labeled

kosher but only sold as non‘kosher.

I urge that only the slaughter bill, as amended, be placed
before the Legislature this year.

New York 19, New York

Bills affecting animal welfare have been introduced in the current session
of the New York State Legislature.

Battle lines are now forming in this legislative fight for animal protec-
tion and New York humanitarians and humane societies are urged to help in these

ways:

1.

6i

Write your State Assemblyman and aSk him to vote for, or against,
the Assembly bills as indicated on the enclosed sheet.

Write your State Senator asking that he vote as indicated on the
enclosed sheet for the bills pending in--the- Senate. (If you. .don't
have the name‘of‘ your own State Senator or Assemblyman, you can get
it easily from your local newspaper, library, courthouse, or city
hall.)

Persuade a few of your friends and relatives to write similar
letters.

Write a letter to the editor of your local newspaper, for publica-
tion, urging other people to write their own Senators and Assemblyman.

Ask church organizations, Granges, women’s clubs or any other organ-
ization to which you belong to adopt a resolution supporting the de-
sirable bills and condemning the undesirable bills. Send copies of
such resolutions to Governor Nelson Rockefeller and your State Senator.

Every humane society should send a bulletin to its members and sup-
porters, asking them to take similar steps.

The legislation under consideration affects large numbers of animals and
immediate, vigorous action is therefore necessary. The HSUS and other humane

societies will be fighting all the way, bU'C your help is needed.

I I Editor: We are all interested in
treatin anima uiﬁﬁe as s-

, sible. I was very surprised to:
hear of the inhuman way seals"
were being slaughtered and have
already began. along with others, F
writing to different governmental ‘
agencies in Canada to try to get
some sort of control on this. ‘ ;

However, things like this are
happening all over. Last w any;

. one particular radio program a
.man was telling of living close toj
a slaughterhouse, in B u f f a l o,
where he couldn’t sleep nights.
because the animals being killed
were screaming so loud. They
claim these animals are not
knocked unconscious before being
killed. ,

Isn’t the SPCA supposed to
check on this? If anyone mm;
more of conditions in our Buffalo
slaughterhouses. please let’s hear
from you. Also._let’s get the SPCA”?

For Children

In regard to your story in
Monday‘s paper about how
“Decent Law-Abiding Citi-
zens Walk in Fears” quite a
long time ago there was talk
about l‘1a‘vi11g all Children up
» to the age of 18 under cur-
few. But nothing was ever
done.

I have two Children. Right
now they are only 8 and 5,
but they too will be a part
of our American teens some-
day. “Then the day comes
that they are old enough to
date or go to parties, I would
like to feel that thex “ill
1:e111111 horn e unharmed. And
not like 17 .veai-old Andrew
IVIormile. I know there are“
many other mothers who
feel the same way.

There should he an 11
P M, curfew on all children.
under 18, unless accompa-
nied by parents. I know there
will he diffimilties. and that
‘ the police max" feel jails Will
always be filled with boys
and girls "who won’t obey
the curfew. but they could
post a $50, or at least, a
$25 fine upon release of all
children out on the streets
after 11 F. M.

This letter is rough. "but I
think you have. the general
idea.

The Bill was introduced

by Sen. Warner and Assemblyman Murray Lewinter.

As more and more slum clearance goes on, new buildings go up

that do not allow pets.

For a family to move into better housing in

most of these places means that the child in the family must see his pet
given away or often destroyed as the price for moving into improved

housing.

Is this how we teach respect for justice?

The elderly man or

woman who lives alone with no companion but his cat or dog cannot move
back to a house on the street from which he was evicted to make room for
new houSLng for which he is otherwise eligibk; unless he abandons his

pet.

In many cases these animals are all that link the elderly with the

outside world and give them a reason to get up and leave their rooms daily.
In both these instances psychiatrists testify to the importance of pets

Two bills on hugane slaughter ‘,

Senator Robert W. Pomeroy has
been referred to the committee
on agriculture and marketing.
ASsembly Intro. No. 2398 intro-
duced by Assemblyman Albert
J. Hausman has been referred
to, the agriculture committee.
These companion bills would

Humane slaughter legislation.

has been adopted by California,

' sin. The state law is designed
to protect food animals not,

covered by the federal legisla-
tion.

Federal and state humane
slaughter laws serve four, im-~
portant purposes. They of course
prevent needless suffering of

livestock. They provide safer .

andbette'r working conditions for
persons engaged in the slaugh-

,’ tering industry. These laws

they produce 0 her benefits—for
producers, processors and con-
sumers—which tend to ”expedite
an orderly flow of livestock and
livestock products in interstate

The federal humane slaughter
bill was enacted in 1958. When
will New York join the other 15
progressive states and pass
humane slaughter legislation? .

THE WARM WAR
Manhattan: So President John-

son has declared war in Viet
Nam by declaring it a combat
zone. Watch it spread! Shades
of Barry Goldwater!

ED SWAYNE.

l Queens: President Johnson’s
[policy in Viet Nam is the only
7 possible and sane policy there.
If we pull out, the southeastern
portion of Asia will be en-
gulfed by Communism. Further-
more, we were requested by the
I Diem regime to help, and this re-
; quest is continued by the present
3 regime. Our President was elected
by 61.8% of the people who
bothered to come out and vote.
The other 40-odd million shouldn’t
criticize what the President does
now. PAUL SCHWARTZ.

HIS CRYSTAL BALL

Brooklyn: From where I sit, it
looks like the Yanks and the
Phils for the ’65 World Series.
The White Sox and Prof. Al Lo-
pez are the only ones that might
stop the Yanks’ record pennant
streak. The Phils should be
smoldering after last year’s de-
feat, and shouldn’t slip this time.

WILLIAM LONG.

HARD-CASH BARGAINS

Bronx: I have a plan that
would end the coin-shortage
problem at most stores. Let'
stores put up a few items to be
sold at real bargain prices only
to those who have the correct
price in coins. It would work
wonders.

ANTHONY SFERLAZZA.

ADLAI’S ACT

Bronx: Do you know that, after
that bristling speech of Adlai
Stevenson that Russia pay up
her two-year deficit, Stevenson
voted with the violators of the
UN Charter to refuse to consider
the debt issue? Instead of “speak-
ing softly and carrying a big
stick,” Stevenson speaks loudly
and carries a wet noodle.

ON TRADE WITH THE ENEMY

Staten Island: Several ships .
flying Liberian, English and
Panamanian flags have put into
New York ports after having

dealt openly with the North Viet
Nam regime. I firmly believe that
our government should say “no"
to these companies and make
them choose between trade with
our democracy and trade with the
conquest—seeking Communist in-
vaders. Such action is an essen-
tial step in waging the fight
against Communist aggression.
This economic sanction of block-

ing these ships from trading here . I

may very well convince the own—
ers of the folly of bolstering the '
North Viet Nam cause.

Rep. JOHN M. MURPHY.

THE PIERSIDE BITE
Wantagh: While visiting
friends who were leaving on a
cruise, we were forced to pay a
50c-per-person “contribution” to
get aboard ship. The money was

supposed to ' go to “Seamen’s
Charities,” but I noticed that the
money was handled very loosely
by expensively dressed, unsuper-
Vlsed personnel, and simply
landed in a cardboard box. Who
audits an operation like this? If
it’s legitimate, why is it not run
by unpaid people from Catholic
Charities or the Salvation Army
or other established charities?

ate under sponsorship of the
American Society for the Pre-
vention of Cruelty to Animals.
The ASPCA said the bill for
“an eco-
nomical, defensible, and persua-

house practices—“the shackling
and hoisting of conscious large
beef-animals in preparations for
slaughter and the use of manual»

or pole axes.”
The proposed amendment to

It would go into effect Jan. 1,

‘ Jewish Opposition

In a statement urging: imme-
diate passage of the bill, ASPCA
president James H. Jenkins
pointed out that more than a
dozen so-call-ed humane. slaugh-
ter bills have died in New York
legislative committees s in c e
1959. “A major deterrent to pas-
sage of these bills,” Mr. Jen-
“was Jewish opposi-
tion. Religious leaders reported-

threatening their Jewish ritual-
istic, method of slaughtering ani-
mals, known as shechita. Ac-
tually this method in itself is
humane.

“No such feeling has been ex-

 

ASPCA bill,” the Society’s pres-
ident continued. "Before offer-
ing this bill in Albany we
5 creened" the entire meas-
ure with rabbinic leaders and
their attorneys. We have been
told by them that our bill is
“acceptable.”

“In other words, no opposi-
tion to our bill has been indi-
cated and no valid resistance to
it seems conceivable.

Editor, The Star:

1I am Still interested in hu-
mane treatment of animals and
suggest readers write or wire
their state senator in Support of
the Humane Slaughter Bill and
companion.

This bill has ben introduced
by ,Senator Robert Pomeroy
and referred to the Senate com-
mittee on Agriculture & Mar-
keting. The bill would re-
quire that all animals'be band-
led humanely prior to slaughter.

Also Senate Intro. No. 607,
Print No. 607 introduced by
Senator Irving D. Mosberg. Re-
ferred 'to- the Senate Committee
on Public Health, this bill would
regulate the care, housing and
use of research animals used in
laboratories within the state.

We need laws desperately to
give humane care to animals
before use in research in New
York State. Please hear my plea

THE NATIONAL PROVISIONER, APRIL l7,‘ 1965

500,000 for the study. The House—
passed bill (HR-5702) was sent to
the Senate, where a companion
measure was pending.

Among Congressmen speaking in
support of the bill were four of the
five House members of the 15-mem—
ber Commission, including Rep.
Graham Purcell (D-Tex.), who at-
tended the first hearing at Chey-
enne.

“Ample evidence was given at this
one set of meetings alone to justify
the need for the
Commission and
the study ex—
pected of it,”
Rep. Purcell said
of the Cheyenne
hearing. “Con—
siderable evi-
dence was given
which pointed
out the striking
changes that
have taken place
in our food industry. The Commis-
sion found that these new and more
complex problems have reached
staggering proportions in certain
segments of the industry.

“Further, these problems are not
generally susceptible to solution by
the individual farmer, processor or
retailer; most certainly not unless
there is a better understanding of
the entire food marketing process
and the pressures which influence it.

“At the hearings, the Commission
found continued support for the be—
1lief that the greatest asset in our na-
tion is the food industry. It has con-
tinued to supply the American peo-
ple with a flow of food abundance
unparalleled any place in the world.
Yet, within that industry, testimony
was given which pointed out the dif-
ficulties that it faces now and the
dangers which exist in the future.”

The Commission’s hearings and
other studies “are essential to the
Congress in its efforts to make it
possible for the food industry to con-
tinue to grow and prosper with the
rest of the nation,” the Texas Con-
gressman concluded.

 

REP. PURCELL

St k d ., Humane Bill Would Cover
oc yar s, /

Kosher Cattle Restraint

A humane slaughter bill has been
introduced in the New York Senate
as Senate Intro. 4393 under sponsor-
ship of The American Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals,
headquartered in New York City

The measure, which carries an ef—
fective date of January 1, 1966,

 

presents the usual definition of hu-
mane slaughter, including ritual
slaughter, but would prohibit shac-
kling and hoisting of conscious beef
animals in kosher as well as non-
kosher slaughter. .

The prohibition against shackling
and hoisting of conscious animals
would not apply to kosher pre-
slaughter restraint of calves or sheep
“until one year after the commis-
sioner (of agriculture and markets)
finds that there is available at rea-
sonable cost a ritually acceptable,
practicable and humane method of
handling or otherwise preparing
calves and sheep for slaughter.”

The ASPCA has developed a large
animal holding pen, which “now is
functioning on a money-saving basis ,
in four slaughterhouses, no one of
which is in New York,” it says in a
memorandum supporting the bill.
The memorandum also explains that
construction of an ASPCA small an-
imal pen prototype is nearing com-
pletion in Cincinnati, and the unit is
scheduled to be delivered for testing
with live animals at the College of
Agriculture of The Ohio State Uni-
versity in May. The memo suggested
that it might take some time before
the small animal pen is proved and
marketable.

“When the ASPCA small pen or
any other successfully developed
similar device can be made available
to the meat industry following an
appropriate finding by the commis-
sioner of agriculture and markets,
the Society hopes the New York law
will be amended to expand coverage
of inhumane animal restraining
practices to cover food animals of all
sizes,” the memo says.

In a statement urging immediate
passage of the bill, which has been
referred to the Senate agriculture
committee, ASPCA president James
H. Jenkins noted that more than a
dozen so-called humane slaughter
bills have died in New York legisla-
tive committees since 1959.

“A major deterrent to passage of
these bills was Jewish opposition,”
he said. “Religious leaders reported-
ly considered these bills as threat-
ening their Jewish ritualistic method
of slaughtering animals, known as
Shechita. Actually, this method in
itself is humane.

“No such feeling has been ex-
pressed with respect to the new
ASPCA bill. Before offering this bill
in Albany, we screened the entire
measure with rabbinic leaders and
their attorneys. We have been told
by them that our bill is ‘acceptable.’
In other words, no opposition to our
bill has been indicated and no valid
resistance to it seems conceivable.”

USDA Charges Morrell with Violating
P&S Act by ‘Point Promotion' Programs

A second case involving packer
“point promotions” was instituted by
the Packers and Stockyards Divi-
sion, U. S. Department of Agricul-
ture, last week with the filing of a
complaint charging John Morrell &
Co., Chicago, with violating the
Packers and Stockyards Act in con-
nection with “numerous sales pro-
motion programs” conducted since
February, 1963.

Under these sales promotion pro-
grams, according to the complaint
(P&S Docket No. 3500), Morrell “of-
fered to give, and gave, to its retail
food dealer customers, or to the store
managers, buyers and other em-
ployes of such customers, with and
without the knowledge and consent
of their employers, a variety of valu-
able personal gifts based upon the
number of prize coupons obtained
from boxes, cases or cartons of
processed meat products purchased
from respondent (Morrell), or the
number of pounds of processed meat
products purchased from respond-
en-t.

“Such offered gifts ranged from
dress shirts, pocket radios, cameras,
small appliances and sports equip-
ment to mink stoles, home freezers
and refrigerators, color television
sets, diamond rings and watches,
outboard boats and motors, and au-
tomobiles.”

These sales promotion pro-grams
allegedly were conducted by the
company in connection with the sale
and distribution of its “Morrell
Pride,” “Del Norte,” “Rodeo,” “Sara-
toga Scott Petersen” and “Hunter”
brands of processed meat products in
the areas covered by its plants and
sales units operating under the
names of John Morrell & Co. at Ot—
tumwa, Ia., and Sioux Falls, S. D.;
Peyton Packing Co., El Paso, Tex.;
Maurer-Neuer Meat Packers, Ar-
kansas City, Kan.; Illinois Meat Co.,
Chicago, and Hunter Packing Co., St.
Louis.

In sponsoring and conducting such
programs, the complaint says, Mor-
rell sought to and did induce retail
food dealers and their employes to
1) grant Morrell greater or special
services in stocking and displaying
its brands of processed meat prod-
ucts; 2) feature and advertise Mor—
rell’s brands of processed meat prod-
ucts, and 3) refrain from purchasing,
displaying, advertising and selling,
or restrict or limit the purchasing,
displaying, advertising and selling of,
processed meat products prepared

22

and sold by Morrells’ competitors.

By such programs, the P&S Divi-
sion charges, Morrell has engaged in
unfair trade practices, subjected
competitors to undue prejudices or
disadvantages, and engaged in a
course of business which tended to
restrict competition in the sale of
processed meat products, in violation
of Section 202(a), (b) and (e) of the
P&S Act.

Morrell has 20 days after receipt of
the complaint, issued on April 5, in
which to file an answer with the
USDA hearing clerk in Washington,
D. C. A hearing before a USDA
hearing examiner has been sched-
uled tentatively for June 29 in Okla—
homa City.

The complaint against Morrell was
filed less than a week after the is-
suance of a USDA consent order un-
der which Armour and Company
agreed to cease and desist from
sponsoring or conducting any sales
promotion program in which person-
al gifts of more than nominal value
are offered or given to retail food
stores based upon the amount of re-
frigerated processed meat products
purchased from Armour.

The order against Armour, effec-
tive May 15, provides for its modifi-
cation after one year to eliminate
any restriction or requirement not
then applicable to similar activities
and conduct of all other packers
subject to the P&S Act, as evidenced
by a court decision, administrative
order, regulation or change of policy
under the Act. Armour admitted
only USDA jurisdiction in the case.

P&S Proposals Provide
For Monorail Scale Tests

The Consumer and Marketing
Service, US. Department of Agricul-
ture, has proposed amending the
scales and weighing regulations is—
sued under the Packers and Stock-
yards Act to include specifically
packer “monorail scales used for the
purpose of purchase of livestock on
grade and yield or other dressed
weight basis.” Additional scale test-
ing instructions to implement the
proposed amendment are included in
a separate proposal.

The proposed scale testing in—
structions would require that 1)
monorail scales used by packers for
purchasing livestock on a dressed
weight basis be tested semi-annually
acCording to presCribed procedures;
2)” such scales must perform within

prescribed tolerances for accuracy,
and 3) a report of each test be filed
with the Packers and Stockyards
Division.

Regulations and instructions
covering the weighing of livestock
and testing of livestock scales have
been issued under the P&S Act for
many years, P&S director Donald A.
Campbell pointed out. With the ad-
vent in recent years of grade and
yield buying, he said, various ele-
ments of the livestock industry have
requested that P&S scale testing re-
quirements be extended to include
the monorail scales used by packers
in such transactions.

The two proposals would clarify
current regulations and supplement
existing scale testing instructions for
other types of livestock scales, pro-
viding additional protection to pro-
ducers, he noted.

The proposed instructions conform
basically with the requirements for
testing and accuracy recommended
by the National Bureau of Standards
and have been discussed with repre-
sentatives of the major scale manu-
facturers and meat packing trade as—
sociations, P&S director Campbell
pointed out.

Both proposals were published in
the Federal Register of April 7.
Comments may be submitted until
May 10 to the Hearing Clerk, US.
Department of Agriculture, Wash-
ington, D. C., 20250.

Livestock Buying Cases

Perlin Packing Co., Inc., Norfolk,
Va., has been charged with engaging
in an unfair trade practice in viola-
tion of the Packers and Stockyards
Act in purchasing livestock from
October, 1964, through January,
1965. '

The complaint (P&S Docket 3491),
issued by the Packers and Stock—
yards Division, U. S. Department of
Agriculture, alleges that the Perlin
firm failed to pay when due approx- ,
imately $61,530 for livestock pur-
chased at four livestock markets in
North Carolina, Virginia and West
Virginia.

In other action under the P&S
Act, USDA Judicial Officer Thomas
J. Flavin has issued a consent order
directing George Duma, doing busi—
ness as Duma Packing Co., Clinton,
0., to cease and desist from: 1)
purchasing livestock in commerce
while his current liabilities exceed
his current assets unless the full
price is paid at the time of purchase;
2) issuing “insufficient funds”
checks in payment for livestock, and
3) failing to pay the purchase price
of livestock when due.

The American Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals this year is sponsor of
a humane slaughter bill in the New York
legislature.

Introduced in the Senate (Senate Intro-
ductory 4393) and in the Assembly (As-
sembly Introductory 5995), the companion
bills are receiving wide support, particularly
among orthodox Jewish groups which in
the past have been known to be fearful of
similar legislation.

The full text of S. I. 4393, as amended,
(which is the same as the Assembly com-
panion measure) is printed on the outside
back cover.

In sponsoring the bill, which would become
effective January 1, 1966, the ASPCA char-
acterizes it as a measure which “for the ﬁrst
time offers to the people of the State of
New York an economical, defensible, and
persuasive law to eliminate the two most
inhumane features of food-animal slaughter-
house practices.”

The practices are manual slugging of ani-
mals with a hammer, sledge or pole ax, and
shackling and hoisting conscious creatures
that otherwise can be humanely and pain-
lessly positioned for butchering.

A Clear Proposal

The ASPCA notes that amendments to the
original Senate bill have resulted in a much
clearer and more comprehensive proposal.
For many suggested improvements of the
original measure, the Society is indebted to
half a dozen lawyers and sincere humanitar-
ians who are not even members of the
ASPCA. Some of these individuals had been
strong supporters of earlier 1965 humane-
slaughter legislation introduced in Albany
but apparently vigorously and controllingly
opposed by religious and commercial forces.

which the animal is positioned for such
slaughter: the hoisting and shackling of a
conscious, frightened, struggling animal.

From the humane point of view, over the
years the vice of non-kosher slaughtering has
been the use of hammers, sledges, and pole
axes to beat an animal into insensibility;
whereas animal pain and suffering attendant
to kosher slaughter stemmed from the fact
that life could be claimed only from a fully
conscious creature. In the United States under
public law coupled with slaughterhouse eco-
nomics, this has meant that the animal had to
be shackled and hoisted in presentation for
the ritual of death.

Legislative Dilemma

In this dilemma, legislation consonant with
preservation of religious freedom could have
resulted—and did result—only in a “hu-
mane method” solution which exempted the
cruel shackling and hoisting attendant to
ritualistic slaughter of all conscious animals.
This pleased nobody, least of all, perhaps,
those orthodox Jewish leaders who for genera-
tions have deplored the necessity for the
shackling and hoisting.

All over the United States for the last half-
dozen years, important and influential seg-
ments of the Jewish community have smarted
under innuendos that their method of food-
animal slaughter was both cruel and inhu-
mane. As a result, what might and should
have been a united crusade against inhu-
manity flared into a ﬁre of emotional human
conflict. The ASPCA at times was party to
this sort of thing. No humane slaughter bill
had a chance of passage in such an atmos-
phere.

A new perspective is found in the ASPCA
bill in Albany. For the first time ever, the
Senate and Assembly companion bill turns
abruptly away from hitherto unsuccessful
and frustrating efforts exclusively to legislate

“ll ls Introduced

humane methods of slaughtering animals.
Instead, it soberly outlines public policy, next
specifies humane methods of slaughter, and
then spells out and prohibits inhumane meth-
ods. Thus, in a few short but clear para-
graphs it illuminates that which is right and
then forbids only that which is wrong.

Section 96-cc of the proposed law outlaws
and prohibits manual slugging, and, so far
as now is practicable, does the same with
shackling and hoisting.

No Need for Cruelty

First it should be noted that in New York
State today there remains not a shred of jus-
tification for using a hammer or a sledge or
a pole ax on any animal. A dozen or more
government-approved substitute instruments
and devices for instantaneous and painless
animal stunning are available at cost so mod-
est as to be within the means even of the
small farmer who butchers his own animals.
Thus the clear language of Section 96-cc-1 is
not legally, economically or morally arguable.

Remaining for comment here is the matter
of outlawing the shackling and hoisting of
conscious creatures in preparation for slaugh-
ter in a manner consonant with uninterrupted
continuation of historical ritualistic practices
and at the same time comfortably within re-
strictions of public law. To the extent that
this inhumanity may be curbed with no of-
fense even to the economics of the packing
industry, Section 96-cc-2 is to the point. Of
practical as well as religious necessity the
legal prohibition of 96-cc-2 cannot apply cur-
rently to the handling of calves and sheep,
but it would apply to all other animals. Later,
appropriate and. timely expansion of the cov-
erage to eliminate the exception as to calves
and sheep would pose only an insignificant
bill-drafting problem.

Cruelty to Animals can speak authoritatively.

This problem embraces kosher slaughter-
houses, non-kosher slaughterhouses, and
establishments practicing both methods of
butchering.

One of the legislative stumbling blocks
over the years with respect to shackling and
hoisting has been that under the requirements
of Jewish ritualistic slaughter all animals
must be conscious at the moment of death.
This does not hold true with respect to ani-
mals slaughtered in a nonritualistic manner.

Holding Pen Available
Since May 1, 1964, the ASPCA has had

exclusive rights to a proved, economical de-
vice eliminating shackling and hoisting of
conscious large beef animals. License to use
this device is offered royalty-free and without
proﬁt to the Society to any slaughterhouse
anywhere. This ASPCA Holding Pen is adapt-
able for both kosher and non-kosher opera-
tions and now is functioning on a money-sav-
ing basis in four slaughterhouses, no one of
which is in New York. Each of the four in-
stallations has been hailed by the Rabbinical
Council of America as an
contribution” and as “a dramatic break-
through in the problem of preparing and
handling animals for slaughter.”
Availability of the beef-animal holding pen
now justiﬁes legislation prohibiting shack-
ling and hoisting of such anim
small slaughterhouses for whi

tions or twin installations might even be eco-
nomically feasible for the larger establish-
ments.

It would be imprudent to forecast, or be
led to believe, that either small animal pen
will be proved and marketable within the
near future. ASPCA designers and engineers
have overcome certain obstacles, but until
live testing takes place, it is dangerous to be
too sanguine. For example, when the device
was ﬁrst operated with dead weights instead
of living animals, two deﬁciencies called for
more powerful activating elements. These
were ordered immediately.

In light of the foregoing, it will be noted
that shackling and hoisting of calves and
sheep being positioned for ritual slaughter is

 

not presently to be prohibited in the new
bill and the Jewish people are therefore not
denied such a part of their present kosher-
killed meat diet.

When the ASPCA small pen or any other
successfully developed similar device can be
made available to the meat industry following
an appropriate ﬁnding by the Commissioner
of Agriculture and Markets, the Society hopes
New York law will be amended to make its
coverage 100 per cent.

Reference was previously made to many
years of orthodox Jewish opposition to hu~
mane slaughter bills introduced in the New
York State Legislature. Such opposition has
been strong, uniﬁed and controlling.

With the introduction of the ASPCA’s new

 

 




     
 

bill opposition has turned into cooperation.

Admittedly no one institutlon—be it in
the Jewish Community or in the humane
movement—can guarantee spokesmanship
for all concerned. Those who hear or read
testimony, therefore, can only seek to weigh

  

that which is presented. .

When the ASPCA—acting on Its own
and assuming no more—sought to bring
about acceptable and workable humane
slaughter legislation in the State of New
York in 1965 the Society solicited and re-
ceived critical but cooperative attention from

EDITORIAL
Live and Let Live

It is serious and practiced policy of the
ASPCA not to be publicly critical of other
societies or institutions in the humane ﬁeld or
of any of their leaders. '

The ASPCA holds that if individuals or
organizations share a deep and sincere con-
cern for the welfare of animals this should be
the determining factor toward working to-
gether to achieve the ultimate in welfare for
the creatures we cherish so much.

Thus, the ASPCA does not indulge in

name-calling or in ridicule of those whose

 

different pathways to the common goal at
times may seem strange. Unfortunately this
philosophy frequently does not work both
ways. Consequently, many of those who love
the ASPCA deplore the compounding of libel
and slander of the Society. This is particularly
true when fair acknowledgment of careless
or reckless falsification is not forthcoming
after the truth has been made known to those
responsible for the defamation.

It is human nature not to take kindly to
such treatment. Nevertheless, it is the con-
sidered judgment of those of us who devote
our time to the leadership of the ASPCA that
when animal lovers spend their time quarrel-
ing one with another the real suffering comes
to the animals who thus are neglected.

The operation of the ASPCA is entrusted
to professional custodians of animal welfare.
Neither these men and women nor the ASPCA
as a whole can have the Society’s resources
diverted to time-consuming low-level con-
troversy.

On occasion, however, it becomes neces-
sary to highlight transparently deliberate
and harmful activity.

Speciﬁcally, this issue of Animal Protec-
tion is devoted in large part to a careful
analysis of a humane slaughter bill now up
for action in the New York State Legislature.
The ASPCA was able to sponsor this measure
only after our Society had made long strldes
toward providing, royalty-free and w1th0ut

proﬁt to the ASPCA, devices to eliminate
shackling and hoisting of millions of con-
scious slaughterhouse animals.

Many members of the Legislature have
spoken approvingly of the ASPCA bill, but
some of them —— as well as some of our own
members —— have inquired about propaganda
which has been interpreted as arguing that
the devices now made available to the
slaughterhouse industry are unnecessary. The
statement has been circulated widely, by per-
sons who refer to themselves as friends of
animals, (1) that a cheap canvas sling is
available for positioning large beef animals
and (,2) that a prominent packing house
when located in New York kosher-killed 3800
lambs per day by using a trough rather than
by shackling and hoisting these animals for
slaughter.

These statements are utterly false.

There is no sling available to packers to
immoblize and dispatch large beef animals
that has proved practical to the industry.

As for the slaughtering of 3800 lambs in
a day, the ASPCA talked with four 30-year
employees of the corporation which allegedly
did this by use of a trough. All of these men
worked on the New York job. All are still
with the company.

“Who dreamed that one up?” one man
asked. “Yes, we ran 3800 through but we
shackled and hoisted all of them. There
wasn’t, and isn’t, any other available kosher
way to do it.”

The ASPCA has an official company con-
firmation of this statement.

Perhaps forever the ASPCA must smart
and at times suffer from the diatribes of
individuals who dislike us. When, however,
such utterances, as in this case, strike at an
effort to relieve animal pain and suffering
and threaten the passage of legislation de-
votedly sought by dedicated humanitarians,
our members and friends at least should
have the truth.

The driver steered his panel truck to the
curb. Scanning doorways to the left, his eye
caught the address logged on a call sheet

He grasped his loop-type leash, a ﬂexible,
heavy-duty rope which all ASPCA-trained
chauffeurs handle deftly, and opened the
cab door. Halfway out the driver’s side,
Eddie Dillon turned towards his passenger.

“Aren’t you coming in with me?”

“I’ll sit this one out,” said the rider.
“Since I’m just along to get an idea of how
this, two-way radio gadget works in emer-
gencies, I’ll sit and listen for calls while you
take care of the routine business.”

Two-way radio is not new to ASPCA
operations. First installed in Society vehicles
more than 10 years ago, the two-way system
gradually has produced a radical change in
ASPCA’s emergency ambulance service.
ASPCA has 14 radio-equipped vehicles in
operation in the ﬁve boroughs. of New York.
The ultimate goal is to install a transistorized
mobile radio unit in each of the Society’s
50-odd emergency ambulances.

Edward Dillon, a Society man for 24
years, was more than willing to discuss two-
way radio procedure during the cross-town
Journey from ASPCA headquarters.

Two-way radio is like a tefephene party
line except that it uses radio waves instead
of wires to carry messages. Each mobile unit
is a completely self-contained transmitter
and receiver set. The transmitter generates
the radio signal While the receiver responds
to it at the receiving end.

ASPCA subscribes to Telephone Exchange
Mobile Service. Telephone Exchange identi-
ﬁes itself as Station KEA, and is regulated
by the Federal Communications Commissmn.

The FCC issued KEA’s license and assigned

its radio band frequency.

The city-wide campaign is also being pro-
moted with car cards in the subways and
with Hyers inserted in every piece of mail
posted from ASPCA ofﬁces. Newspaper and
radio announcements are also being used.
During the summer the Society’s horse am-

This editorial in the New York Daily News
is typical of the public reaction to the cam-

“We’re 100% in favor of the campaign
launched by the ASPCA yesterday, to per-
suade New York dog owners to keep their
pets from messing up city sidewalks and
other public places. The ASPCA’S slogan is:
‘Curb your dog—People have rights, too,’
and it tells the story neatly.

YEAR OF
THE
SERPENT

Through 99 years of service to animals,
The American Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals has learned to expect the
unusual. This year was no exception.

While the Society carried on its routine
work of hauling cats out of trees, ﬁnding
homes for homeless puppies and teaching
kindness to children, it also cared for mon-
key stowaways from banana boats, escapees
from zoos and furred visitors from wooded
suburban areas.

There were incidents involving a migrat-
ing bird that fell into a Manhattan excava-
tion, a purebred Jersey calf born on a liner
in New York harbor, a turtle with a broken
back and a dog owned by a man serving a
stretch in jail.

The Chinese recently greeted 1965 as the
“Year of the Serpent.” At least three reptiles
caused separate ﬂurries of excitement at the

ASPCA recently. In each case, the culprits
were boa constrictors.

Boa Constrictor

The ASPCA nabbed one boa constrictor on

the platform of a Brooklyn subway station,

strictor used in the Society’s education program.
This is the Chinese “Year of the Serpent.”

after it wriggled out of its burlap bag and
caused havoc among subway passengers. Only
minutes before a young boy had bought the
snake at a pet shop. This snake got a one-
way ticket to a zoo.

Another boa, pet of a Brooklyn woman,
slithered under a loose ﬂoor board in her
home. An ASPCA team failed to ﬂush the
snake, but every so often, even today, it
pokes its head through an opening in the
floor, ceiling or wall and the search is re-
sumed.

One boa constrictor threw a scare into a
Brooklyn man when he went to his base-
ment at 5 A.M. looking for a fresh shirt.
The man’s 17-year-old son had borrowed the
reptile from a pal to show around the neigh-
borhood. The creature wound up at a reptile
zoo after a brief stay at the ASPCA.

An iguana, a lizard with a four-foot tail,
was captured in Times Square after it
startled theater-goers. A distant cousin of the
snake—an eight-foot alligator—broke out of
its shipping crate and crawled around Ken-
nedy International Airport for half an hour

until it was cornered by ASPCA’s George F.

A?" 33‘CA veterinarians recently engineered
the {vergest dental ﬁlling ever. When an
elevatkyear-old pet turtle fell off a high shelf
and 5*acked its shell, veterinarians ﬁlled the
thre5-:-5nch hole with dental cement and den-
tal aerylic.

In tine case the ASPCA chased an elusive
fullngzewn rhesus monkey up and down
stre353 in and out of trees and over rooftops
for Eeven days. The silver-gray female, dub-
bed Ophelia, was ﬁnally nabbed when she
fell for a banana, after stealing fruit from
gardens and terrorizing children. No one
claimed Ophelia, who probably was a ba-
nana boat stowaway, and she went to a 200.

Not all of ASPCA’s cases involved exotic
animals. One involved a three-month 01d
Pomeranian puppy. ASPCA is caring for
the pedigreed pooch while its owner serves a
nine-month stretch at Riker’s Island pnson.
A one-day-old bull calf born aboard the ship

Queen Of Bermuda just as it was pulling out

of New York harbor was given to the ASPCA.
The Society bottle-fed the Jersey calf and
gave it round-the-clock care for a month
until a home was found for it on Ohio State
University’s College of Agriculture dairy
farm.

Birds got into the act too. A snow-white
cattle egret, cousin of the long-legged heron,
fell into a Manhattan excavation in Novem-
ber long after it should have been roosting
snug and warm in the Carolinas or Florida.
The dazed, starving bird was given a warm

home at the ASPCA.

And two ﬁghting cocks, conﬁscated by
the FBI at Kennedy Airport almost a year
ago, are still residing at the ASPCA’s Brook-
lyn shelter—in separate cages. The ASPCA
was given custody of the evidence pending
disposition of the F Bl’s case against a Brook-
lyn man accused of violating the anti-rack-
eteering law—importing the battling birds
for the purpose of establishing a gambling
enterprise.

Kind to Humans, Too

The Society has been kind to humans as
well as animals. The night attendant at the
Staten Island Shelter escorted a woman home
from the ferry landing after she telephoned
the shelter to say she was afraid of stray
dogs near her home. She said she thought
an organization that protects animals from
humans should also protect humans from
animals. The attendant agreed and a short
time later he entered this note in his log:
“10:30 P.M. Left shelter in ambulance to
pick up lady at ferry landing. 11:15 P.M.
Back in shelter. Lady home and happy.”

Since it is their “year,” in all fairness it
should be mentioned the leading trouble-
maker, the snake, is really not that bad a
fellow. The ASPCA’s Education Department
keeps a pair of boa constrictors on hand for
the beneﬁt of visiting school children. In
fact, one of the Society’s junior members
carried Kaa—the ASPCA’s senior reptile——
home for a long holiday.

Mrs. Alice Hirschﬁeld, long-time friend and feeder of Sherman Square pigeons, helps launch
an ASPCA trial of a birth control chemical for pigeons. looking on while she tossed out the

 

first seed impregnated with the chemical are Col. Edmond M. Rowan, Director, ASPCA Humane
Work Division, and Dr. William H. Elder, Professor of Zoology, University of Missouri, who

developed the chemical.

Society Tries Birth Control for Pigeons

The pigeons around New York’s Sherman
Square are a discreet—and in their own
way, sedate—flock. They converge on the
same place for meals at the same time each
day and generally accept seed from the same
hospitable hostesses.

For these reasons, the Sherman Square
pigeons and others along Broadway are tak-
ing part in a unique medical research proj-
ect, the ﬁeld trial of the ﬁrst workable birth
control drug for pigeons. Their steady habits
ease the task of keeping track of the results.

Prof. William H. Elder, of the University
of Missouri’s Department of Zoology and
Col. Edmond M. Rowan, director of the
ASPCA Humane Work Division, launched
the ﬁeld trial April 21 by distributing a sup-
ply of special seed around the pigeon’s favor-
ite feeding haunts along Broadway.

The special seed consists of whole wheat
grains that have been soaked in the birth
control chemical. The chemical is one of a
large family of medicines called Azo com-
pounds, called 22,25-diazacholestanol dihy-
drochloride. Dr. Elder, who developed it,
states it has an anti-cholesterol activity and
thus prevents or severely inhibits the produc-
tion of eggs which are rich in cholesterol.
The chemical is not harmful to the pigeons
and its birth control effect is only temporary.

According to laboratory tests and small

16

test trials in pigeon roosts around St. leans.
the chemical causes a large and sudden drop
in both the fecundity rate and the. fertility
rate of the common pigeon. The :iiecnmiity
rate is the number of eggs laid per nnfrmh —~—-—
normally two in one clutch ——— and the fertil-
ity rate is the number which hatch. This rate
runs around 90 per cent on a yeanronnd
average.

Dr. Elder said these tests show the birth
control chemical causes an 80 per cent drop
in these rates for the ﬁrst two months after
feeding. The special seed was fed to- the pig-
eons for a 10-day period and then stopped.
The effectiveness of the chemical dwindled
and by six months after feeding the rates
were back to normal.

In commenting on the trial, Col. Rowan
said: “The ASPCA has long been concerned
with the protection of pigeons. Under cer-
tain conditions, they have been declared a
nuisance and a health hazard. This project,
if successful, offers the most humane solution
to the problem that has come to our atten-
tion. It would reduce flocks Without resorting
to poisoning, shooting, or other extreme
measures.”

He added that the ASPCA would await
results of the current trials before deciding
what steps can be taken towards reducing the

city’s pigeon population.

to pain by mechanical, electrical, chemical or
other means that are rapid anﬂ effective, before
being shackled. hoisted, thrown, cast or cut: or

2) a method in accordance with ritual requirements
of the Jewish faith or any other religious faith
whereby the animal suffers loss of consciousness
by anemia of the brain caused by the simultaneous
and instantaneous severance of the carotid
arteries with a sharp instrument.

The use of a manually operated hammer, sledge or pole ex is not
considered a humane method of slaughter.

At the annual convention of the New Yerk State Humane Association
last fall, the following resolution was aphroved:

 




Hon. Julian B. Erway April 28, 1965

"Whereas needless suffering is inflicted on a'large,
percentage of the animals being slaughtered in New
York State, therefore be it resolved that the

New York State Humane Association, assembled at its
seventy~fifth annual meeting, October 31, 1964, in
Poughkeepsie, New York, urges that in the coming
legislative session the New York State Senate and
the New Ybrk State Assembly pass bills identical to
the MbEwen (s. 813) and Feinberg (A. 1492) bills
respectively, which failed to pass in 1964, to
prevent unnecessary pain and fear in Slaughtering
and to prohibit the shackling and hoisting ef
conscious animals."

We most earnestly urge that S. 4393 be amended as suggested and
favorably reported to the New Ybrk State Senate so that the present
cruelty in slaughtering meat animals will be prevented.

Sincerely,

Christine Stevens
President
