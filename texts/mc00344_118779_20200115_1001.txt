i’Are‘a Humane Workers Fight Senate .
Measure Regulating litigation 3

Villr. Maxine” C. Bush, together
with other Northeastern Pennsyl-
vania humane workers attended
, the annual e ti g of the Amer"—
Wiean Anti—yii’iigition Society at,
'the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel, in
"Philadelphia, Friday night.

A panel of speakers discussed
a proposed ,Federval Senate Bill
for regulation of vivisection. Owen .
Hunt, president of the American
Anti-Vivisection Society, acted as
”moderator and also reported on
«his summer trip to England, where
the and heads of the British Anti-
:ViVi’s‘ections.Society discussed the
y [.1291 and compared it with British
regulatory laws. ' i
. Sneakers on the panel included
William Snyder, president, The
Maryland Anti‘Vivise-ction Society,
And Clarence E. Richard, ”manag—
ing' director of the National Anti-
Vivisection sz‘oCiety.

Each speaker presented reasons
why his society is against this
regulatory legislation. The bill
Under discussion is temporarily
dead Ibutiit is expected a similar
one will be introduced in the U. :5:
Senate when it next convenes.

Dr. Bush explained: “The Ant:—

ly opposing such a bill. The pro»
posed law does not regulate so as 5

NEW LAW HAILED

 

By ANN COTTRELL FREE
Contributinz Writer
Last Friday brought into near
reality the beneﬁts of the ﬁrst
of a number of Federal laws de-
signed to protect animals from
needless pain and fear.

This is the humane slaughter
1aW.~

As it goes into effect—nearly
two years after its passage—this
country joins 15 others (including
the Fiji Islands) in granting
merciful dispatch to millions of
our meat animals.

The hard-fought campaign to
pass this law has acted as a spur
for even greater concern for
animal welfare. The humane
movement has been growing in
recent years.

When thousands of little Davids
tackled one of the Goliaths of
American industry—the meat-
packers—and won, they showed
that‘in the face of cruelty, the
phrase “there ought to be a law”
--is no longer an empty one.

And Congress has learned on
several occasions that when hu-
man beings give voice to the suf-
fering of voteless dumb creatures,
they do so with articulate forceful-
ness.'

The Element of Mercy

It seems, then. that humani-
tarians—driven by their unquiet
consciences—have added some-
thing new to both the quality and
quantity of mercy.

They’ve put animal welfare into
politics if seeking congressional
help can be called politics.

And the ﬁrst political party—or
candidate—to adapt the aims of
the active humanitarians may get
execptional results. '

So, as greater compassion comes
to many slaughter houses, the
stage is being set for other humane
campaigns; Among them is better
care and treatment of millions of
laboratory animals that serve man.
Legislation to this effect has al-
ready been introduced in both
Houses of Congress.

Supporters of this type of legis-
lation may be cheered (and op-
ponents forewarned) to know that
most of the groupsthat fought
humane slaughter the hardest
have stayed to welcome it—even
enthusiastically.

When the law went into effect
Friday, most of the Nation’s big
packers were in near compliance.
At the last minute, due to some
small plants being unable to ob-
tain equipment in time, a bill was
introduced to extend the deadline
for them until September 1.

Humane Animal Slaughter Act In Effect

Provisions of the Bill

But by and large after July 1,
the United States Government
must contract for meat that comes

from a packing ﬁrm which
slaughters all its meat in all its
plants by humane methods. The
packers doing business with the
Government slaughter a large
amount of the Nation’s meat.
Meatpackers that do not 'sell,

Editorial

THE SUNDAY STAR
Washington, D. C., July 3,1960

 

Hog slaughter is a principal industry affected by new law.

to the Government—-and thus are
exempt from the Federal law—
are being reached by State laws.
To date California, Minnesota,
New Hampshire, Washington and
Wisconsin have such laws. Legis-
lation is pending in New Jersey
and Louisiana.

Kosher ritual slaughter is per-
mitted under the law as humane.
But many humane societies insist
that non-ritual shackling and
hoisting of animals prior to
slaughter be outlawed both on
Federal and State levels.

Functional tools do the job of
painlessly rendering an animal
unconscious before the thrust of
the knife. Therefore, the last 18
months have been spent perfect-
ing these tools, such as the cap-
tive bolt pistol, the carbon dioxide
tunnel and the electric stunner.

This retooling—the ﬁrst in. the
history of this industrywhas cost
more than $5 million, according
to the American Meat Institute.
This includes, '
remodeling of old buildings.

Methods for Savings

Instead of pushing meat prices
Up or lowering those to livestock
producers (as was once threatened

as well, extensive.

by the law’s opponents) new
methods promise to effectuate
savings to packers.

Administration of the law is
under the Department of Agri-
culture. It compiles lists of plants
using humane methods for, fre-
quent publication in the Federal
Register. In addition each seller
must furnish to a Government
purchaser a statement of eligi-
bility. FalsiﬁCation courts crim-
inal penalty. An advisory board,
including humanitarians, packers,
labor and public members, such
as a representative of the Gen-
eral Federation of Women’s
Clubs, has helped to designate the
approved new methods.

Following in the wake of the
humane slaughter law may be
attempts to regulate the care of
livestock moving by truck in in-
terstate commerce. They are not
protected by the 28-hour law for
feeding and watering that is re-
quired of the railroads.

Since the slaughter law was
passed in August, 1958, congres-
sional help has been sought—and
won—to outlaw the rounding up
of wild horses 0 public lands by
aircraft or a' obiles.

As this session recessed, legisla-
tierI was pending to put a brake

on the wanton use of deadly
chemicals that notonly kill pests,
but song birds and valuable, in-
nocent wildlife.

Encouraged by wide— spread pub-
lic support, the Senate recently
approved funds for plans and
speciﬁcations for a pharmacolog-
ical- animal laboratory building
for the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration. It would include proper
quarters for hundreds of FDA re-
search dOgs, now conﬁned in tiny‘
cages for life in a sub- basement

'of a Government building.

Wild Life Traps

A Federal law is being sought
to replace the old steel leg- grip
trap for wildlife trapped on public.
lands with humane instamt- killer
traps. The late Senator Richard
L. Neuberger was one of its chief
supporters.

The long arm of the humani-
tarians has reached as far as Mid-
way Island to help rescue the
‘gooney birds” from further
zlubbing to death by the United
States Navy. The storied Alba-
tross ‘ use Midway as a nesting
place, but unfortunately it has
become a hazard to aircraft. Out-
cries over the Navy’s method of
elimination resulted in a new ap-
proach. Dunes that may create
favOrable air currents for the birds
are being leveled. And everyone
as hoping-that the birds'will go
somewhere else to nest.

A congressional eye alSo is being
turned to the direction. of the
horseshow ring. Particular con-
cern is being expressed and ar-
rests being made—over the “sore-
ing” with acids and nails the-feet
of the ﬂashy Tennessee walking
horses. Often blood is left on the
tanbark or turf from the feet of-
these lightly stepping" horses.

On nearly all these recent hu-
mane issues, the humane societies
have shown a United front in
which lies their strength. Where-
as until about 10 years ago. there
was only one major national so-
ciety—the 83-year-old American
Humane Association -— there are
now at least ﬁve.

Many Groups Active

Among those located in the cap-
ital are the vigorous Humane So-
ciety of the United States, the
young but growing National
Catholic Society for Animal Wel-
fare 1133 Defenders of Wild-
life, and WARDS (Welfare for
Animals used in Research and
Drug Surgery), are among the
specialized groups.

Also here in Washington are a
number of strong conservation
societies that concern themselves
also with humane . treatment" of
wildlife as well as soil and water
measures.

‘ From New York the inﬂuence
of the Animal Welfare Institute
and Society for Animal Protective
Legislation also is felt here. These
two groups, currently, are the
chief backers of recently intro-
duced laboratory animal care
legislation patterned after the
British . law.

THE CINCINNATI ENQUIRER

Friday, May 27, 1960

KENTUCKY EDITION

 

6-6-60
Nearly a century ago, in response to a petition
to the government signed by Charles Darwin,
Thomas Huxley, Edward Jenner and some other
distinguished scientists, Great Britain adopted leg-
islation designed to prevent the inﬂiction of need-
less suffering, upon animals used in laboratories
for research purposes. The United States has no
comparable national legislation. A bill is now to
be submitted to Congress, however, to provide for
the humane treatment of animals used in experi-
ments and tests by recipients Of grants from the
United States and by governmental agencies.
Carefully drafted so that it will in no way in-
hibit or impede genuine research, such legislation
deserves support .
Two postulates should be recognized. One
is that experiments involving pain and death
for animals have enlarged man’s knowledge and

brought great gifts to humanity; such experi-vv

ments are, therefore, entirely justiﬁed. _The other
postulate is that needless pain is often inflicted
on living _creatures through carelessness, callOus-
ness, ignbrance and wanton neglect in handling

animals; 3' the inﬂiction of such suffering is un-'

justiﬁable cruelty demeaning to human beings.
The aim of any legislation in this area must be
to promote the one and prevent the other.

Real research will not be restricted by a law
requiring decent care, feeding and housing of
animals awaiting experimentation. In many ex-
periments, it will not be inhibited by a little extra
eifort expended to anesthetize animals or to put
them out of their misery when the experiment
has been completed. The standards ought to be

ﬁxed by scientists themselves and they ought to,

make ample allowance even for remote possibili-
ties of advancing human knowledge. But some
setting and enforcement of standards are neces-
sary to keep sadism from being confused with

sc1enCe.

011 Animal Research B111 -

By Robert C Talk

A small brown- and black
mongrel with some terrier in
his family was romping on the
roof of St. Vincent’s Hospital
around noon last Tuesday.
Along With other dogs being

, Excited, he Squeezed through
an opening in a wire mesh
fence around the roof’ s edge
and fell twelve stories onto a
parked car. Happily he escaped
with minor cuts on his legs.

, “This is a typical incident
showing that animals are not
properlyc cared for in research
laboratories,” an animal pro-
tection group said. (The animal

“The things that go on in
. laboratories must be Chan-,ged”
the group said. “That’s why we
’ need Federal legislation. ”

The legislation is the Cooper
‘ Bill, now before Congress. Its
stated purpose it “to provide for
the humane treatment of ani-
mals used in experiments and
' tests under grants from the
. United States” by private as
well as government researchers.
It promises to set off the big-
gest and bitterest battle yet in

WHAT OTHERS SAY

Men Owe Justice To The Animals
Who Save Lives

Millions of animals are used
every year for scientific experi-
ments in the laboratories of Amer-
ica. Countless human lives have
been saved by the knowledge
gleaned from these adventures.
Every person who has sat in a
sick room and watched a patient
1win the battle against death with
the aid of new drugs and new
methods (if treatment should offer
up a prayer of thanks for the
laboratory work that has brought
such succor to suffering mankind.

Those who rejoice in the miracle
of modern science could do so with
a truly full heart if they could
“be assured that the animals used
‘fOr eXperimentation have not suf-
fered unneeded pain in the pro-
} Cess. No such assurance has been
l possible up to the present. Now it
l is offered“ 1n large degree, if Con-
! gress Can be persuaded to pass a
bill introduced by John Sherman
iCooper of Kentucky and 11 other
’ Senators It is officially known as
S 3570. ,

i ' Its Authority Limited “

The Cooper Bill’s purpose is “to
provide for humane treatment of
animals used for research.” Its
authority extends only to animals
used by recipients of grants from
the United States Government or
one of its agencies or instrumental-
ities. This will 1n fact cover a large
majority of the laboratory ani-
mals, however. Also, the bill will
place the Federal Government in
1the pos1tlonmgmf; offering standards

of decent practice for all other
agencies using animals for experi-
mentation.

The bill sets up a system of
licensing for all such work con-
ducted or financed by the gov-
ernment. Licenses would be issued
by the Secretary of Health, Edu-
cation and Welfare, whOse office
would also keep full records of
all experiments conducted under
the bill’s terms.

The legislation establishes rules
which every licensee must follow,
or suffer the loss of his license.
These include for every labora-
tory animal “a comfortable resting
place adequate space and facil-
ities for nOrmal exercise, and ad-
equate sanitation, lighting, tem-
perature control and Ventilation. ”

There must also be “adequate food ‘

on the other hand, who regard the
welfare of animals as being of no
consequence Whatever in experi-

,ments for the benefit of the hu-

man race will be impatient of the
bother caused by the bill’s licens-
ing requirements. .

Surely there are many millions
of Americans, however, who want

Scientific experiments to continue, .

but who also want to feel that
human beings are not benefitting 1
by the unnecessary agony of dumb
animals. Their voices should be:
raised in behalf of the Cooper Bill. 1
They will need to speak loudly‘
and publicly, however, if they hope
to overcome the outcries of small
but highly vocal minority groups

'who are bound to oppose the meas-

ure. —Louisville Courie1;-Journal.

 

 

 

and water,” and a ban against
“unnecessary or avoidable pain
through neglect or mishandling.”

In the operating process, the bill
requires the use of anesthesia to
prevent pain “during and after
the experiment, except to the ex-
tent that the use of aneSthe-tics
would frustrate the object 0f the
experiment.” This section is typi-
cal of the practical and moderate
tone of the bill.

A Sensible Balance ;

The whole measure strikes a
sensible .‘balance between the needs
of medical research and the de1
mands of humane treatment for
animals. BeCause of its very mod-
eratiOn, it will displease extrem-
ists on both sides. Those who op-
pose vivisection for even the best
of purposes will condemn it. Those,

Mirror of World Opinion

Nearly a century ago, in response to a

petition to the g0vernment signed by
Charles Darwin, Themas Huxley, Edward

Jenner and some other distinguished sci!
entists, Great Britain adopted legislation
designed to prevent the inﬂiction of need-
less suffering upon animals used in labora—
tories for research purposes. The United
States has no comparablemational legis-
lation: A bill [S. 3570 introduced by John
Sherman C00per of Kentucky and 11 other
Senators] isnow to be submitted to Con-
gress, however, to provide for the humane
treatment of animals used in experiments
and tests by recipients of grants from the
United States and by governmental agen-
cies. Carefully drafted so that it Will in no
way inhibit or impede genuine research,
such legislation deserves support. . . .
Real research will not be restricted by a
law requiring decent care, feeding and
housing of animals awaiting experimenta-
tion. In many experiments, it will not be
inhibited by a little extra effort expended

, to anesthetize animals or to put them out

of their misery when the experiment has

{kph-"been completed. The standards ought to
be ﬁxed by scientists themselves. But some

settmg and enforcement of standards are

. ,. necessary to keep sadism from being con-
g‘fused with science—Washington Post and

This Humane
Bill Deserves
Passage

«NE oi today’s Letters to the Edi-
, tor asks support for Senator
_ JOHN SHERMAN Coorsn’s Senate
Bill 3570, for’ the humane treatment
of laboratory animals. The bill has this
newspaper’s warm endorsement, as
.‘has its companion, House Bill 12587,
introduced this month by Representa-
tive MARTHA GRIFFITHS of Michigan.
American laboratories use millions
: of animals for scientific experiments
each year. Knowledge gained through
_ these experiments has saved count- '
less human lives, New areas of med-
: ical knowledge are still being pio-
neered through animal experiments.
The Cooper bill would set up a sys-.
tem of licensing for all institutions
using animals in experiments con.
ducted for or financed by the govern-
ment. It would set up rules which
every licensee would follow under
penalty of losing its license. The rules
. are reasonable. They include for. every
laboratory animal “a comfortable rest-
; 'ing place, adequate space and .f'acili-V
ties for normal exercise, and adequate
sanitation, lighting, temperature cen-'
; trol and ventilation. They provide for
“adequate food and water,” and pro-‘-
hibit “unnecessary or avoidable pain
,‘through neglect or mishandling.”
5 (In brief, the licensing requirement
f (to be administered through the De-
" partment of Health, Education and
: Welfare) would assure that all lab-
oratories engaging in government ex~
.periinentation or“ using federal grants
“employ the same standards of humane
" treatment of laboratory animals that
some of them employ already.

C00per Bill

 

By Research Scientists

;A national group of re—
Search scientists yesterday
took issue with a bill pro-
ppsed in Congress last week
by Sen. John Sherman
Cjooper.

The bill, co sponsored by 10
other Senators, calls for li-
censing and regulation of all
li'ye animal experiments us-
ing Federal funds. .

“The “Cooper bill only pro-
poses to create a cops-and-
robbers game to drain away
the time and resources of
s¢ientists who are trying to
find. better Ways to save
hives,” charged Dr. Lester R.

W.,Dragstedt, president of the

Opposed

objection to this proposal,”
he said, “and yet it seems to:
me that the objectives . .
are worthwhile.”

Dr. Dragstedt, whose group
includes most of the major
research centers in the coun~
try, complained that the bill
sets up checks, but “has no
constructive provisions.”

He pointed out that hu~
mane handling of research;
animals is necessary for ac—Ag

well as for h‘umaneness T

Why Net Be Kind To People Too?

. LTHOUGH THIS is a political campaign
year and a time Whena certain license is
giVen to ferocity of public utterance, we

have not felt a blast hotter- than has just come:

from the National Anti-:Vivisection Society’s

headquarters at Chicago, It appears that the.

society and an organization called the Animal
Welfare Institute of New York are at odds
over a bill sponsored by Senator Cooper of

[Kentucky—a measure innocently intended for

the protection. ofoani‘mals used in laboratory
experiments. '

The N. A—V. S. has opposed the bill and, in -_

consequence, so it says, has been subjected to
“gutter tactics” by the A. WL which is one of
.“the Johnny-come~lately animal welfare Socie-

ties.” The A. W.I. is accused not only of being .-

- churlish and snide but also of making state-
ments j which are" “flatly falSe”~and Icharacter-
ized‘ by “brazen effrontery. ” .,Worse there is
.more than 21 mm of dirty work at the cross-
roads. , .

.‘_ \I

“We have been Warned—not by the A. W I
but presumably, by persons belonging to it—
to ‘take it -=easy’ because the husband of its

president ‘0Wns the Empire State “Building’ _

and ‘is a power in‘the Democratic Party.’ We
would-not care if Mr. Stevens owned. the entire
island of "Manhattan andhad the Whole Demo-
cratic Party in his. pocket: his wealth and in?
fluence . . . will not affect our determination
to do our best to preVent the enactment- of
such a monstrous bill (the Cooper bill) into:
laW.” The Cooper bill, incidentally, is merely
“mumbo-jumbo designed to make black seem
White.”
Any organization capable of accusing Sena-
tor Cooper of such a performance is likely to
seem to any Kentuckian to deserve all of the

sputtering invective in which the National

Anti-Vivisection Society indulges itself. The
only possible conclusion is that people who

make a point of being kind to animals do not

necessarily insist upon being kind to people..

Veloped out of intelligent research with
laboratory mammals It has been Ob-

rigserved that if the price of the iron lung
was 24 cats, or the cost Of insulin 33
dogs then mankind got a rare bargain.
At the same time, there is no doubt
that many experimental animals have
.ii-éfbeen treated inhumanely in the name of
ﬁscie'ntiﬁc research. Documented cases
frange from the sheer sadism of. burning
illi've pigs to death in gasoline ﬂames, pur-

E' portedly to study the causes Of human
i s-‘death by ﬁre, to the mere thoughtless-

neSS Which causes laboratory animals to

.1 be poorly fed 01' badly housed.

Clearly, there are two sides to the.

animal experimentation question. On

[the one hand, such experiments have

made possible great scientiﬁc and med-

: ieal achievements

On the other hand,
Some thoughtless or careless experiment-

:_ ers have inﬂicted unnecessary pain and

{suffering on laboratory animals.

What

Eis'needed is an approach to this question
were preserves the necessary and useful
. aspects of animal experiments while pre-

venting the abuses.
In order to achieve both these goals

there has been introduced a bill, S. 3570,
if to provide for the humane treatment of
animals used in experiments and tests by
Lnrecipients, of grants from the United
“ States and by agencies and instrumen-

‘3 't—alities of the US. Government.

ator from Kentucky [Mr. COOPER], and I

_The goal of the; bill, is to make sure that '

in experiments requiring the use of live:
yanimals, precautions are taken and ef-
‘ forts are made to conduct such experi-
. ments in as humane a manner as
possible.

In recent weeks, two important news-

fpapers have endorsed the principles of'
._ this badly~ needed legislation. On May
“:‘25: the Louisville Courier-Journal printed
.;3.-:‘an - editorial, under the heading “Men
Owe Justice to the Animals Who Save
ifEij1ves, i’ which clearly and concisely ex-
plains the purpose of S. 3570 and how
ii‘it is intended to work. On June 6, the
:Washington Post carried an editorial,

‘dtitled “Animals and Research,” which

i; ,hOughtfully outlines the background
and philosophy of the bill.

I ask unanimous consent that both
hese editorials be printed at this point

m the RECORD.
There being no Objection, the edito-

 

1:1a1sf were ordered to be printed in the
_,_. RECORD, as follows:

sick room and watched a patient win the
battle against death with the aid of new
drugs and new methods of treatment should
offer up a prayer of thanks .for the laboratory
work that has brought such Succor to suffer-
ing mankind.

Those who rejoice in the miracle Of modern
science could do so with a truly full heart if

. they could be assured that the animals used

for experimentation have not suffered un- *
needed pain in the process. NO such assur-
ance has been possible up to the present.

- Now it is Oﬂered, in large degree, if Congress

can be persuaded to pass a bill introduced
by JOHN SHERMAN COOPER, of Kentucky, and
If other Senators. It is officially known as
S. 3570. E .

ITS AUTHORITY LIMITED

The Coop-er bill’s purpose is “to provide
for humane treatment of animals used for-
research. ” Its authority extends only to ani-
mals used by recipients of grants from the,
US. Government or one Of its agencies or
instrumentalities. This will in fact cover a
large majority of the laboratory animals,
however. Also, the bill will place the Fed-
eral Government in the position of offering
standards of decent practice for all other
agencies using animals for experimentatiOn.
- The bill sets up a system of licensing for
all such work conducted or ﬁnanced by the:
Governnient. Licenses would be issued by
the Secretary of Health, Education, and Wel-
fare, whose oﬂ‘ice would also keep full records A;

of all experiments conducted under the bill ~
. terms. '

The legislatiOn establishes rules which
every licenSee must follow, or suffer the loss
of his lie-.ense These include for every labo-
ratory - animal “a comfortable resting place,
adequate space and facilities for normal ex-
ercise, "and adequate sanitation, lighting,
temperature control and ventilation.” There
must also be adequate food and water, and a
ban against unnecessary or avoidable pain
through neglect or mishandling. ”

In the operating process, the bill requires
the use of anesthesia: to prevent pain during
and after the experiment, except to the ex-
tent that the use Of anesthetics would frus-
trate the Object of the experiment. This sec-
tion is typical of the practical and moderate
tone Of the bill.

A SENSIBLE BALANCE

The whole measure strikes a sensible bal-
ance between the needs of medical research
and the demands of humane treatment for
animals. Because of its very moderation, it
will displease extremists on both sides.
Those who oppose vivisection fGI‘ even the
best of purposes will condemn it. Those, on '
the other hand, who regard the welfare of
animals as being of no consequence whatever
in experiments for the beneﬁt of the human
race will be impatient of the bother caused
by the bill’s licensing requirements.

Surely there are many millions of Ameri-
cans, however, who want scientiﬁc experi-
mentsto continue, but who also want to feel
that human beings are not benefiting by.
the unnecessary agony of dumb animals.
Their voices should be raised in behalf of
the Cooper bill. They will need'to speak
loudly and publicly, however, if they hope
to overcome the outcries of small but highly
vocal minority groups who are bound to
oppose the measure.

ANIMALS AND RESEARCH

Nearly a century ago, in response to a pe-
tition. to the Government signed by Charles
Darwin, Thomas Huxley, Edward Jenner and
some other distinguished scientists, Great
_Britain adopted legislation designed to pre-
vent the inﬁiction of needless suffering upon
animals used in laboratories for research
purposes. The United States has no com-
parable national legislation. A bill is nOW
to be submitted to Congress, however, to

provide for the humane treatment of am-

 




 

 

 

11106

mals used in experiments and tests by re-

cipients of grants from the United States
‘ and by governmental agencies. Carefully
drafted so that it will in no way inhibit or
impede genuine research, such legislation
deserves support. '

Two postulates should be recognized. One
is that experiments involving pain. and
death for animals have enlarged man’s

knowledge and brought great gifts to hu—V

manity; such experiments are, therefore,
entirely justiﬁed. The other postulate is
that needless pain is often inﬂicted on living
creatures through carelessness, callousness,
ignorance and wanton neglect in handling
animals: the inﬂiction of such Suffering is
unjustiﬁable cruelty demeaning to human
. beings. The aim of any legislation in this
~ area must be to promote the one and pre-
vent the other.

Real research will not be restricted by a
law requiring decent care, feeding and hous-
ing of animals awaiting experimentation.
In many experiments, it will not be inhib-
ited by a little extra effort expended to anes-
thetize animals or to put them out of their
misery when the experiment has been com-
pleted. The standards ought to be ﬁxed by

scientists themselves and they ought to make
‘ ample allowance even for remote possibili-
ties of advancing human knowledge. But
some setting and enforcement of standards
are necessary to keep sadism from being
onfused with science.

 

' VDAIRY PRICE SUPPORTS FOR 1960

Mr. PRQXMIRE. Mr. President, in
the middle of last month hearings were
held before a subcommittee of the Com-
mittee on Agriculture and Forestry of
the U. S. Senate on dairy price supports
for 1960. Those hearings were on a dairy
price support bill which I introduced.

It seems to me these,hearings make a
devastating case for the bill. It would
cost the Federal Government Very little.
[It would signiﬁcantly increase the . de-
pressed income of the dairy farmers of
this Nation. I ask unanimous consent
that certain portions of the hearings be
printed at this point in the RECORD”.

I refer speciﬁcally to my statement, on
pages 4 and 5;. to the statement of the
Department of Agriculture, on pages 12
to 24, including the interrogation of De-

partment oﬁ‘lcials by the Senator from

Vermont [Mr. AIKEN] and myself; the
testimony by Mr. E. M. Norton, secretary
of the National Milk Producers Federa-
. tion, on. page 25 and pages 34 to 36; the

testimony by Mr. Gilbert Rohde on pages

37 through 40 and pages 42 to 43; the
testimony by Mr William Eckles, on
pages 44 to 51; and the testimony by Mr.
Otie Reed, on pages 51 to 57.

There being no objection, the extracts

were ordered to be printed in the RECORD,

as follows:

The bill would provide an increase in the

price support level from $3.06 per hundred-
weight for manufacturing milk to $3.22, and

the
It will do so in a sound and respon-

from 56. 6 cents per pound for butterfat to-

59. 6 cents. These price supports Would still
not exceed the market price. I think that is
still the case.

In 1947 it took him 9.5 minutes:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ——.- S

. L. .

This bill merits the thoughtful considera-
tion of the Senate for these reasons:

1. After 7 years of a grinding squeeze be-
tween falling prices for his milk, and rising
costs, the dairy farmer has at last worked. -
011’ the surplus. Not 1 pound of butter and .
only small quantities of cheese, dried milk,
or any other dairy product remain in storage
today in the warehouses of the Commodity
Credit Corporation.

2. The prices received for their milk have

dropped almost 25 percent in the past 8
years. At the same time the dairy farmer .l
has suffered a very sharp rise in both the cost _
of living and all the costs of operating his
farm.
‘ 3. The sheer economic injustice of the
dairy farmer’ 5 position is shown in the sta-
tistics published by the Department of Ag-
riculture, which show that in America’s
dairyland, Wisconsin, the average farmer, al-
lowing a 5-percent return on his invested
capital, earns less than 60 cents per hour,
including the value of food produced and
consumed on the farm. At the same time,
the true cost to the average consumer in_
terms of the amount of time he must work
at his job to earn enough to buy a quart of
milk has continued to fall.

In 1914, it took the average worker 22.9 -,

minutes to earn the price of a quart of
milk. By 1929 it took him 15.3 minutes.
‘By 1959,
the typical worker, earning a countrywide
average wage, could buy a quart of milk with
the proceeds from 6. 8 minutes of work.
This is great. The farmer can and will con-
tinue to provide milk for less and less work.
But the rate and timing of this reduction is
all important. It is the difference between
justice and gross injustice for the farmer.
" 4. This bill is a modest proposal,- as the
senior Senator from-Vermont has said. The
economic condition of the dairy industry
would justify a much higher' support level.
. In 1953, when conditions facing dairy
farmers were similar, the Department of Ag- ;
riculture, under the identical law in effect ._ ,

. today, established a support price which was

68 cents per hu‘ndredweight higher than-the
present level.

I want to document that for juSt a min-
ute by pointing out that on January 8, 1960,
the Secretary annOunced that the support
prices for manufacturing milk and butter-

fat are being continued at $3 06 per hundred-

weight for manufacturing milk and 56. 6 cents
per pound for butterfat. -

In the same release, the Secretary stated
that the average price received by farmers
for butterfat so far in the current marketing
year is 59.6 cents per pound, 3 cents above
support, and the price for manufacturing

.milk is $3.22 per hundredweight, 16 cents

above support.

The proposed legislation would provide a
price support level of $3.22 for manufactur-
ing milk, the same ﬁgure which the Secre- " ‘
tary indicated represents the current market '
price level.

The Secretary also announced that the
1960 support rates are about 77 percent of
the parity equivalent price for manufactur- .
ing milk, based on parity prices are an- «i
nounced on December 30,1959. This, he '
stated, continues the percentage of parity
level of support currently effective.

If the parity equivalent for manufacturing
milk were based on 88 percent of the parity
price of all ,milk sold wholesale, as an-
nounced December 30, $3 .06 would represent
70. 5 percent of parity. As we all know, 88
percent was the parity equivalent used fer
a number of years up to a couple of years .
ago—$3 .06 on that basis would represent 70. 5 .
percent of parity, far less than the law in
fact requires.

The parity equivalent based on 80. 2 per-
cent of the parity price of all milk whole-1
sale, as announced December 30, means that ,
$3.06 represents 77.5 percent of that parity; “

Humane T- tment of Animals

NGN. HARRISONA. WILLIAMS, JR.

OF NEW JERSEY
IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
Saturday, August '27, 1960

Mr. WILLIAMS of New Jersey. Mr.
President, two New Jersey newspapers
have given recent editorial support of S.
3570, a bill to help insure humane treat-
. ment of animals in those research lab-

oratories that have received Federal
funds. ~

As one of the cosponsors of the bill,
which was introduced with the leader-

ship of Senator COOPER, of Kentucky, I,
was particularly gratiﬁed to read the,‘

Vlg‘OI'OUS expressmns Of support given by

the Bergen Evening Record in its issue

of June 20 and the Asbury‘Park Press in
its'issue of June 14. The editorials point

out clearly the need for rational and.

responsible thinking on the proposed
legislation.

I ask that unanimous consent be given
to have the editorials printed in the
Appendix of the RECORD. _

There being no objection, the edito-
rials were ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:

will also exasperate people who deem the

dictates that animals be given a comfortable
resting place, adequate facilities for normal
exercise, adequate light and heat and food
and water, and a surcease from pain through
neglect 'or mishandling, plus merciful dis-
patch when their own merciful "work is

serve us they will not be compensated with
cruelty. Great Britain adopted such legis-
lation a century ago at the instance of such
distinguished scientists and humans as Dar-
win, Huxley, and William Jenner. It is time
we see that a clear line is drawn between
two humiliating extremes.

\ ANIMAL EXPERIMENTATION '

A bill is pending in the House of Repre-
sentatives, HR. 12587, and another in the
US. Senate, S. 3750, which would assure
humane treatment to laboratory animals.
These are animals used for experimental pur-

poses in science’s effort to find cures for
human disease.

These bills do not ban the use of animal
experimentation. They merely seek to make
it humane as, we assume, every decent person

would like to see it. It must be recognized .

that through animal experimentation stu-
pendous discoveries have been made which
have greatly improved man’s health and ex-
tended his longevity.
to rationalize the abolition of such experi-

. mentation. It is equally diﬁ‘icult to ration-

alize the continuation of such experimenta-
tion without adequate assurance that cruelty
will be outlawed.

301i U39 0f Animals In Research

Dr. Malcolm Stanley, professor of medicine

at the University of Louisville. Medical School,

‘ has written Senator Cooper a letter of protest

; about a proposal for “humane treatment of
animals used for research”

The Kentucky Republican and a group of
Democratic senators are sponsors of the pro-
posal, Senate Bill 3570.

Dr. Stanley said the proposed law is un-
, necessary, discriminatory, and would be “enor-
-mously expensive-3 .

. _ He said he believed its real promoters are
. ant1v1v1sectiomsts who wish to outlaw all use
of animals for medical research. .

The doctor also said the medical council
:1 .of the Medical School has sent a resolution ob-
'-,jecting to the bill to Cooper. .

' I Researchers Would Be Licensed

, , In general, the bill would require all i in-
vestiga-tors getting federal medical grants to
1 show first that all animals to be used have

comfortable resting places and adequate space, .

ventilation, light, food, and water. .
‘ The researchers would be licensed by the
.T. Department of Health, Education, and Wei-
fare, and the Department’s representatives
1.; could order destroyed any animal not treated
:_,‘_..according to the regulations.
Any unnecessary pain to the animals would
§.__,be. outlawed. And any animalundergoing pain-
f‘ul procedures or practice surgery would have
to be completely anesthetized first, and then
i destroyed before recovering consciousness.
Dr Stanley said the last provision would
thwart much useful eXperimental work, be-
j-‘cause if animals werenot allowed to. recover

M’—

’ research under Government grants in the past

from surgery the researchers could not tell
what mistakes might have been made. -

He also said:

1. Experimental animals are now treated
humanely by medical researchers. It is to their
advantage to have the best conditions possible
for research animals.

2. The new medical-dental research build-
ing in the Medical Center will have animal
quarters better than those» occupied by many
humans. They will be air-conditioned. The quar-
ters’ cost per square foot, because of tiled
floors and walls, will be greater than that of
any other part of the building. -

3. The Complex regulatory system set forth
in the bill would require numerous inspectors,
much red tape, an “administrative hierarchy,”
and great expense.

4. Recipients of federal grants would be
regulated, but animals of other researchers
would not, nor would “poultry, other livestock
and farm animals, dogs and horses used for
racing, or pets.”

5. The remarkable freedom for individual

has been an important factor In the rapid prog-
ress of , medicine, and the bill would “clearly
encroach on this freedom.”

He said antivivisectionists have failed in
prevmus attempts to outlaw animal experi-
mentsand have now turned to this more 'subtle

 

way of accomplishing their aims.

Cooper Bill Opposed ;
By Research Scientists l

«A national group of reaobjection to this proposal”

scarch scientists
took issue with a bill pro
posed in Congress last week
by Sen. John Sherman
Cooper.
aThe bill, co sponsored by 10
other Senators, calls for li—
censing and regulation of all
" live animal experiments us—
ing Federal funds.
' "‘The Cooper bill only pro-
poses to create a cops and—
robbers game to drain away
the time and resources of
stientists who are trying to
find better ways to save
lives,” charged Dr. Lester R.
Dragstedt, president of the
National Society for Medical
Research, Chicago.

:In introducing the bill,

Senator Cooper stated that

its purpose was to insure as

humane as possible tieat-i

.. ment of laboratory animals

yesterdayi

he said, “and yet it seems to
me that the objectives . . i
are worthwhile.” ,

Dr. Dragstedt, whose group
includes most of the major
research centers in the coun-
try complained that the bill
sets up checks, but “has no
constructive provisions.’

He pointed out that hu-
mane handling of research
animals is necessary for ac-
curate scientific results as‘
well as for h‘umaneness. 1

Senator Cooper said he is

‘satisfied that this bill would
not inhibit or prevent experi—
mental research, nor is it my;
intentions or that of the 00-?
sponsors of this bill to do so”

AN INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPER

Defense—After Paris

"The collapse of the summit negotiations un-
doubtedly has given fresh and needed impetus
to the congressional scrutiny of defense spending
in the next ﬁscal year. We hope this will result
in better provision than the Administration budget
made for such essential items—among others——
as airborne alert preparations, airlift, continental
air defense, second- generation strategic missiles,

antrsubmarrne protection and military satellite.

development.
The House did well in many of these areas by

providing substantially more in new spending au- .

th‘oi‘ity than was requested, balancing the increases
withacross-the-board cuts in procurement, opera-
tions and maintenance funds that may or may not
be soundly conceived. This week a Senate AppI‘0*
priations Subcommittee will compose its recommen-
dations on the measure. Presumably it will be no
less generous than the House;
increases of its own.

It would be a mistake, we think, for COngress

A HUMANE QUESTION

 

‘ Proper Care

By ANN COTTRELL FREE
Contributing Writer

The increase in the use of ani-
mals in medical, military and
space science has created a new
national industry and has brought
With it problems now attracting
congressional concern.

Few persons outside the test
laboratories know that more than
51 million animals will be used
this year for research. Mass pro-
duction and consumption brings
headaches. But recent events here
make clear that if dividends are
to be realized in dollars, discov-
eries and goodwill, top priority
must be given to the care, breed-
ing and handling of these servants
of humanity.

“Good care is good business”
emerged as the synthesis of a re-
cent three~day session here of 700
experts in the test-animal world.
They were scientists, veterinarians,
humanitarians, animal breeders,
makers of cage equipment and
dog, mouse and monkey food.
Each had an important connec-
tion with this mushrooming $232-
million—a-year business — which
may have a far-reaching effect on
the destiny of the American peo-
ple.

These experts at the 10th Ani-
mal Care Panel were still feeling
their way in this new complex
ﬁeld, even to the point of seeking
clearer deﬁnitions of good care.
They found a valuable guidepost
in the ﬁrst congressional policy
statement on this subject. The
Senate Appropriations Committee
recently declared that providing
“suitable and comfortable” quar-
ters for animals used in Federal
research is a “proper expense.”

British Authorities Here

Two visiting high authorities on
Great Britain’s laboratory animal
law reminded the panel, indirectly,
of what could lie ahead.

The holding of the panel here
pointed up the fact that Wash-
ington occupies a unique position
in the test-animal kingdom. What
happens here, both from the
standpoint of policy and research,
can inﬂuence the Nation. Few
places use so many animals to
ﬁght so many different battles for
man. The enemies they are pitted
against range from deadly cancer
to colors and chemicals added to
food, medicines and cosmetics.
Also their care and quarters vary
from the ideal to the medievally
inadequate.

One million mice are being used
by the National Cancer Institute

experiment with a rabbit.

alone in its $22 million chemo-
therapy program. Larger animals.
even horses and cows, are em-
ployed at the Army’s nearby Fort
Dedrick, Md., in germ and chemi-
cal warfare tests. Pigeons, beagle
hounds as well as rodents are used
by the Food and Drug Administra-
tion to test the purity of many
products.

Figuring high in the plans of
space experts are monkeys, chim-
panzees and man’s best friend, the
dog. (It has been revealed that
a dog is slated to help his master
explore the moon!)

Research Council Branch

In all, 14 test-animal labora-
tories are maintained in this area
by government; business and
university hospitals. Within a
100 - mile radius, 10 animal
breeders are located.

disease

Of particular importance here
in keeping lines of supply and
test-animal policy straight is a
unique branch of the National
Research Council. It’s Institute of
Laboratory Animal Resources
knows more about the whys and
wherefores of germ-free mice and
other test animals than any place
you could name. Also it has is-
sued principles for laboratory ani-
mal care.

And it is over principles—such
as how long dogs should be caged
——that most questions arise. The
institute says that “it is generally
conceded that animals maintained
for long periods are in better
physiological condition if they
exercise regularly.”

But in practice this ideal is
rarely realized. Therefore, the
Senate Committee’s policy pro-
nouncement offers hope that
many deplorable conditions of

or Science's Animals

prolonged caging without relief
will be remedied.

Certainly, it should affect the
animals used in thousands of re-
search projects throughout the
country that are ﬁnanced with
NIH funds. The NIH itself at
Bethesda, with its $700,000-a-year
animal budget, is considered a
model.

But the Food and Drug Admin-
istration, which is under the De-
partment of Health, Education
and Welfare, as is NIH, has prob-
lems. It keeps thousands of ani-
mals deep in the sub-basement of
the south building of the Agri-
culture Department. There, for
example, in one room 100 beagles
live out their lives in small—-
30 by 36 inches—cages piled in
two tiers. They are brought as
puppies from Beltsville, Md.,
where FDA raises them. They are
used to test toxicity of colors and
additives to foods.

Congressional funds will be
sought soon for a $23 million
FDA building. But blueprints,
drawn up before the Senate Ap-
propriations Committee attitude
became known, do not provide
either indoor or outdoor runs for
dogs.

A Special Effort

When it comes to mobilizing
public interest in test-animal
quarters, Washington serves as a
model to the Nation. WARDS—
Welfare for Animals Used in Re-
search and Drug Surgery—has
raised $30,000 to match Federal
funds to build new quarters for
long-term dogs at two- local medi—
cal colleges. Its membership in-
cludes a liberal sprinkling of Con-
gressmen and doctors.

Though the British system fo-
cuses on actual experimentation,
care of animals is of concern, too.
The 1876 law, pioneered by
Charles Darwin and Thomas
Huxley, was explained to the
panel by Maj. C. W. Hume of the
Universities Federation of Animal
Welfare and by Dr. P. L. C. Car-
rier, chief inspector for labora-
tories.

The law requires licensing of
researchers, inspection and safe-
guards against unnecessary pain.
Maj. Hume revealed that “no
fewer than 10 Nobel prizes for
physiology and medicine have
been awarded to scientists work-
ing under the law.”

These recent events here make
it quite clear that as the test-
animal world expands, there will
be greater public interest in all
phases of its development.
