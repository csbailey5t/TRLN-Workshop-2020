WARNING THE DEER
by Gerry Stork

Three weeks that include Thanksgiving
the hunters excuse themselves from reality
and rationalize they are managing some
of the deer that would starve in the cold
for lack of browse. I’d sooner starve

any day than be annihilated

by a slug disintegrating my insides,

metal ﬁst from a black steel '
barrel, sighted m by a scope

on my privacy, murdered by some individual
working out what seems part

of that original sin the Bible

speaks about when Adam and Eve

got separated from all the animals they loved.

Imagine being a deer:

the winter is hard—aren’t

they always? all day we browse

in the zone of starvation

ambling quietly toward death
uncomfortably getting numb '

when you see us we look content
our pellets of waste diappear

as stomachs shrink

in the black and white

of snow and winter trees

in this northern existence we love
our spirits variations of ancestors
men drew on cave walls

in Eurasia when time began— p
there is nothing like lying down cold
and slowly draining self into

a burial mound of fur and frozen ﬂesh
within hearing of luscious spring

to become part of a carrion

crow, a touch of lynx but mostly
forest . ' ‘ . or:

already it is time again

to hightail it

I heard the faint reports

this morning even before

the sun took the light from the stars.
There is the one sickly stench

in my memory

so revolting I turn

both toward and away from it

at this time every year

for all of a sudden it is

everywhere .

and I listen for twigs breaking

like miniature explosions

heralding the arrival of my destroyer
in red woolens. .
There! Again! Even as I

take off I am turned

excruciatingly inside out arms to throat
shredded spleen and intestines

burst open by expanding

metal—my deemess.

On my way to work this ﬁrst Monday

of hunting season, I stop at a store

and as I am leaving after exchanging
pleasantries ‘ with the storekeeper,

she asks if I’ve gotten my deer.

I say I’ve yet to go out,

been busy making a living

closing the shell of a house in for winter.
As I drive away I am ashamed

'I didn’t tell her the whole truth.

I’m not a hunter in this county

of hunters. I’ve been out

warning the deer; up on the rafters
with my hammer warning the deer.
Bang bang bang bang. One

two three four. Get going!

Now pounding nails again into the house frame,
I hope my echoes of warning .

across the valleys and hills of Danville

are understood. Bucks move the does

and the fawns into the bogs

and into the marshes and up

the mountains away from the atavistic
menace come hunting them here. Let

those people sight in their riﬂes

eternally, get the shakes drilling .
cans oﬁ fences, and wonder how this year '

.all the deer have disappeared.

 

 

 

 

 

 




INTO THE WAR-TORN HAMLET
STRUTS A HARBINGER

From the burnt jungle at dawn
the little cockerel struts,
burnished auburn and indigo feathers

shimmering in the rise of the sun,
3 bantam cockerel tailed by his hen,
irridescent, bronze.

They come goose-stepping home
clucking through silent lanes,
shattered huts, the rubble of battle.

In his wake the hen pecks the dust
for invisible crumbs,

finds eﬁli fragments of bone.

They pause by the farthest hut,
stalk the tilt of ladder up to the room
where the last two survivors hide.

The hen hunts through the corners
then, finding a bundle of rags,
stomps them into a nest, lays one egg.

The man seizes it, punctures one end,
offers it to the woman
who swallows the tepid yolk.

From the broken roof

the cockerel crows and crows.
The hen continues to brood the rags.

The Pawn

There it was I saw what I pshall never forget

And never retrieve.

Monstrous and beautiful to human eyes, hard to believe,

He lay, yet there he lay,

Asleep on the moss, his head on his polished clef't small ebony hooves,
The child of the doe, the dappled child of the deer.

Surely his mother had never said, “Lie here
Till I return,” so spotty and plain to see
On the green moss lay he.

His eyes hadopened; he considered me.

 

 




I would have given more than I care to say
To thrifty ears, might I have had him for my friend

One moment only of that forest day:

Might I have had the acceptance, not the love

Of those clear eyes;

Might Ihave been for him the bough above

, Or the root beneath his forest bed,

A part of the forest, seen without surprise.

Was it alarm, or was it the wind of my fear lest he depart
That jerked him to his jointy knees,
And sent him crashing off, leaping and stumbling

On his new legs, between the stems of the white trees?

 




 

 

BUFFALO DUSK

The buffaloes are gone.

And those who saw the buffaloes are gone.

Those who saw the buffaloes by thousands and
i how they pawed the prairie sod into dust
with their hoofs, their great heads down
pawing on in a great pageant of dusk,
Those who saw the buffaloes are gone.

And the buffaloes are gone.

av Sarton The Composed Imagination

I le _ j mt ~

My parrot is emerald green,

His tail feathers, marine.

He bears an orange half-moon
Over his ivory beak.

He must be believed to be seen,
This bird from a Rousseau wood.
When the urge is on him to speak,
He becomes too true to be good.

He uses his beak like a hook

To lift himself up with or break
Open a sunﬂower seed,

And his eye, in a bold white ring,
Has a lapidary look.

What a most astonishing bird,

Whose voice when he chooses to sing-
Must be believed to be heard.

 

 

That stuttered staccato scream

Must be believed not to seem

The shriek of a witch in the room.

But he murmurs some mufﬂed words

(Like someone who talks through a dream)
When he sits in the window and sees

The to-and-fro wings of wild birds

In the leaﬂess improbable trees.

Solitude

The Caged

He was there in my room,

A wild bird in a cage,

But I was a guest and not for me
To open the gate and set him free
However great my gloom

And unrepenting rage.

But not to see and not to hear
Was difﬁcult to try:

The small red bird burst into song
And sang so sweetly all day long

I knew his presence near

And his inquiring eye——

So we exchanged some words;

And then I scattered seed

And put fresh water in his pan

And cleaned the litter from the pen,
Wondering about caged birds, '
What more this one might need.

But oh, when night came then

I started up in fear

At the ﬁerce wing-beat of despair
Hurled at the bars, hurting the air,
And the heart wild within

As if a hawk were near.

The room was sealed and dark,
And that war all within

Where on the small cramped stage
The bird fought with his cage
And then lay beaten down,
Almost extinguished spark.

And I went'back to bed,
Trembling, who nothing could,
As if this'scene had grown so huge
It ripped apart all subterfuge,

And naked now as God,

I wept hot tears like blood.

LAMENT FOR.AURIC*

1971 —— 1985

You sleep-curled round as a secret, safe

from pain, arthritis & old age.

You sleep deep in earth: dog tags, water bowl
close to your paws in the underground

& glow of golden minerals where

azaleas sigh in summer air. The fearless
grackles fly in pairso Soon many birds
'crowd our lawn. Are these the mourners

>for golden retrievers?

Moving carefree, content to be off the clock
I saw you become grass, muscle—loose, rolling
over & over for the joy of it on the verge

of laughing out loud, leaping

for imaginary tennis balls. Your third eye
beamed scent to places & things

the sighted never see. ‘

You never offered love in a limited way

as intellectuals do. Old lover,buddy, smoocher
kissing my toes, arms, hand & generous

with leftover kisses for any passerby

who looked your way.

Yet, on the greenest day of July

you went down like a seal, trusting

that nightmare shark: the terrorist

who strikes with no warning or conscience
in terrible thunder, piercing

your heart through.

GREEN FROG AT ROADSTEAD, WISCONSEN

It is the way of a pleasant path

To walk through white birch, ﬁr

And spruce on a limestone trail

Through the quiet, complacent time

Of summer when, suddenly, the frog jumps

And you jump after him, laughing,
Hopping, frog and woman, to show
The stationary world its ﬂat ways.
Love is a Frog, I grin that greenly

To your green eyes and they leap

At me. Up, I will enter the Fr0g World
With you and try the leaping ways

of the heart that we do not fail to ﬁnd
The sunlit air full of leaping chances.

 




OPOSSUM QUESTIONS

There's something dead,

struck by a car on Webster,

near the sunken railroad tracks, on the street
where all the junked car parts are sold.

Curled up on itself,

around the last beat's pulse,

eyes open, and a bald, pathetic curlicue
of a tail, headed in its own direction.

No naturalist, 2/Z/{5/QF/79

I don't immediately know what it is:

it could be a cat or else racoon, but isn't,
it has the fuzziness of porcupines,

a fox's skinny nose, but finally the tail
gives it away for an opossum.

It was struck just once, no blood is visible.

In the still untampered morning,

the buses and the semi's,

all the used and new cars drive around it,
so unlikely and past help a sight.

Is there a family? Do opossums live

in families? Do they know?

Would they have tried to drag it off,

down by the railroad tracks, to the unkempt fescue
and the runaway weeds? What do opossums eat?

Who could even answer questions like these?

An hour later, driving by again,

it's as I feared—-

there's no sign of it having been there.
The opossum's disappeared.

Seal

See how he dives
From the rocks with a zoom!

See how he darts
Through his watery room
Past crabs and eels
And green seaweed,
Past fluffs of sandy
Minnow feed!
See how he swims
With a swerve and a twist,
A flip of the flipper,
A flick of the wrist!
Quicksilver-quick,
Softer than spray,
Down he plunges
And sweeps away;
Before you can think,
Before you can utter
Words like ”Dill pickle”
Or ”Apple butter,”
Back up he swims
Past sting-ray and shark,
Out with a zoom,
A whoop, a bark;
Before you can say
Whatever you wish,
He plops at your side
With a mouthful of fish!

William lay Smith

 




Old Dog

Toward the last in the morning she could not
get up, even when l rattled her pan.

I helped her into the yard, but she stumbled
and fell. I knew it was time.

The last night a mist drifted over the fields.

In the morning she would not raise her head—
the far, clear mountains we had walked

surged back to mind.

We looked a slow bargain: our days together
were the ones we had already had.

I gave her something the vet had given,

and patted her still, a good last friend.

WILLIAM STAFFORD

 




ROVER

She came out of the ﬁeld—low

cloud and the land even more dark

where it rolled wide, our farm. She came
limping our gate into the yard

and up to the door. For greeting, I

held out my hand. I felt the tongue touch
my palm, and a breath came: something
entering my whole life in a rush.

What came to me in trust no one

could take away. I knew

it was mine. Not father, even, or mother,
could end the new feeling: mine.

Now I belonged wherever dark

ﬂowed, from that night on,

anywhere, any touch that was kind.

EXPERIMENTS

Part of the cost, we knew, was the pain,
but the budget didn’t show that,

and when the animals whined we closed
their door quietly so the accountants
could finish their work and go home.

I wish I didn’t know how the universe
runs. l whine now and then when the door
opens or the wind carries what is out there
too near the room where my comfort is.

In Fur

They hurt no one. They rove the North.
Owning the wilderness, they're not lost.
They couple in joy; in fear, they run.
Old, their lives move still the same——
all a pattern across the land,

one step, one breath, one. . . .-

Winter bundles them close; their fur
bunches together in friendly storms.
Everything cold can teach, they learn.
They stand together. The future comes.

The Goat Paths

HE crooked paths go every way
Upon the hill—they wind about

Through the heather in and out
Of the quiet sunniness. A
And there the goats, day after day,
Stray in sunny quietness,
Cropping here and cropping there,
As they pause and turn and pass,
Now a bit of heather spray,
Now a mouthful of the grass.

 

 

In the deeper sunniness,

In the place where nothing stirs,
Quietly in quietness,

In the quiet of the furze,

For a time they come and lie
Staring on the roving sky.

If you approach they run away,

They leap and stare, away they bound,
With a sudden angry sOund,

To the sunny quietude;

Crouching down where nothing stirs
In the silence of the furze,

Crouching down again to brood

In the sunny solitude.

 




 

If I were as wise as they,

I would stray apart and brood,
I would beat a hidden way
Through the quiet heather spray
To a sunny solitude;

And should you come I’d run away,
I would make an angry sound,

I would stare and turn and bound
To the deeper quietude,

To the place where nothing stirs
In the silence of the furze.

In that airy quietness

I would think as long as they;
Through the quiet sunniness
I would stray away to brood
By a hidden, beaten way

In the sunny solitude.

I would think until I found
Something I can never ﬁnd,
Something lying on the ground,
In the bottom of my mind.

Stevens, asked for an interpretation of another poem, said (in The
Explicator, November, 1948): “Things that have their origin in the
imagination or in the emotions (poems) . . . very often take on a form
that is ambiguous or uncertain. It is not possible to attach a single,
rational meaning to such things without destroying the imaginative or
emotional ambiguity or uncertainty that is inherent in them and that
is why poets do not like to explain. That the meanings given by others
are sometimes meanings not intended by the poet or that were never
present in his mind does not impair them as meanings.”

Questions

 

Anecdote 0f the Iar

1. What is the meaning of line 8? Check “port” in a dictionary.

2. Does the poem suggest that the jar organizes slovenly nature, or that
the jar impoverishes abundant nature? Or both, or neither? Is the jar a
symbol of the imagination, or of the arts, or of man’s material progress?

Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird

I

Among twenty snowy mountains,
The only moving thing
Was the eye of the blackbird.

II

I was of three minds,
Like a tree
In which there are three blackbirds.

III

The blackbird whirled in the autumn winds.
It was a small part of the pantomime.

IMAGERY AND SYMBOLISM 399

 




IV

A man and a woman

Are one.

A man and a woman and a blackbird
Are one.

V

I do not know which to prefer,
The beauty of inﬂections

Or the beauty of innuendos,
The blackbird whistling

Or just after.

VI

Icicles ﬁlled the long window
With barbaric glass. .

The shadow of the blackbird
Crossed it, to and fro.

The mood

Traced in the shadow

An indecipherable cause.

VII

0 thin men of Haddam,

Why do you imagine golden birds?
Do you not see how the blackbird
Walks around the feet

Of the women about you?

VIII

I know noble accents

And lucid, inescapable rhythms;
But I know, too,

That the blackbird is involved

In what I know.

IX

When the blackbird ﬂew out of sight,
It marked the edge

Of one of many circles.

X

At the sight of blackbirds
Flying in a green light,
Even the bawds of euphony
Would cry out sharply.

XI

He rode over Connecticut
In a glass coach.

Once, a fear pierced him,
In that he mistook

The shadow of his equipage
For blackbirds.

XII

The river is moving.

The blackbird must be ﬂying.

XIII

It was evening all afternoon.
It was snowing

And it was going to snow.
The blackbird sat

In the cedar—limbs.

Questions

//
Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird

1. Stevens once mentioned that he was especially fond of a poem that
“wears a deliberately commonplace costume, and yet seems to me to
contain something of the essential . gaudiness of poetry}? Does the state-
ment apply to “Thirteen Ways”?

IMAGERY AND SYMBOLISM

 




2. What are the usual associations you have of blackbirds? What quali-
ties do the ﬁrst two stanzas guide us to attribute to blackbirds?

3. In a letter Stevens says of stanza 7, “In Haddam, Connecticut, men
grow thin seeking gold.” Does this comment help us to make sense of
the stanza, or is the stanza sufﬁcient without it?

4. Who are “the bawds of euphony” (stanza 10)? Is stanza 8 relevant
here?

5. Might “He rode over Connecticut / In a glass coach” be interpreted
as a description of man insulated from reality by civilization —including
“lucid, inescapable rhythms” (stanza 8) and “euphony” (stanza IO)?

6. Is the presence of the blackbird in the last stanza reassuring or men-
acing, or what?

7. What do you think of the idea that the blackbird is a way of seeing,
or speaking, that is opposed to “lucid, inescapable rhythms”?

D. H. Lawrence (1885—1930)

 

Snake

A snake came to my water—trough

On a hot, hot day, and I in pajamas for the heat,
To drink there.

In the deep, strange—scented shade of the great dark carob—tree

I came down the steps with my pitcher

And must wait, must stand and wait, for there he was at the
trough before me.

He reached down from a ﬁssure in the earth—wall in the gloom

And trailed his yellow—brown slackness soft-bellied down, over the
edge of the stone trough

And rested his throat upon the stone bottom,

And where the water had dripped from the tap, in a small clearness, 10

He sipped with his straight mouth,

Softly drank through his straight gums, into his slack long body,
Silently. -

Someone was before me at my water-trough,
And I, like a second comer, waiting.

He lifted his head from his drinking, as cattle do,
And looked at me vaguely, as drinking cattle do,

Rhinoceros

I have never seen that beast,

with his snout bearing a pagoda

and his eyes like little fragments
and his haunches carrying hills

with them. His teeth, I have read,
are monuments, and his heart colder
than a key in winter,

though he sweats from pores round as goblets
and full of swamps.

The white hunters have killed him

a thousand times over.

I think of myself walking toward him
and preaching a love of creatures,
leaves in my palm, or a loaf of sugar,
and his great horn still,

the knees waiting,

and between us, like birds,

a twittering hope,

or merely the pause

between monster and monster.

Wolf on the Plains

Wherever he is, the country
‘ Is opening on one side, breaking
And ﬂowing in the direction
His padded feet will go.‘
It is always forward, always
North; the other side snaps
Shut, a trap.
Coded neurons stream .
Into the backbone: Go toward the pines.
He twitches, bound to the landscape:
Deciding and deciding.

Tastier berries can make up. Chaste springs hiss

Bashed stones get edges. For a killing kit

less adventitiously bash, fail, then again

bash. Chip and scrape for evening industry.

Such well-kept stones, some sticks, here a trap—pit,

To get science I eat data coiled 1n brains

of murdered dead. Ice ﬂows. Bison, ibex,
