 

WHAT DOES VIOLENCE
SAY ABOUT MAN?

By jOSEPH WOOD KRUTCH

animals.” So writes Salvador Dali

in his modest Diary of a Genius.

One 'of his deepest regrets is, so he

goes on to say, that he has never had

the pleasure of watching a lion die of
starvation.

Now lions are expensive luxuries but

rats and other small animals come cheap

‘61 VERY MUCH LIKE to torture

and a modest equivalent of the experi- .

ence denied Dali is enjoyed by many
adolescents in high schools that buy
from one of the largest biological supply
houses complete starvation kits that in-
clude various deﬁcient diets and thus
provide for a reﬁnement which only
modern science has made possible. The
victims eat but they die even more
slowly than if they were entirely de-
prived of food. Thus the pleasure of
watching them is prolonged and it may
be justiﬁed on the ground that it is
“educational.”

A century ago Charles Darwin told
a Royal Commission that experiments
involving cruelty to animals were
“damnable” unless they contribute im-
portant knowledge unobtainable in any
other way. And when Thomas Henry
Huxley heard of a vivisectionist who
said that he might give his victims an
anesthetic to keep them quiet but not
to spare them pain, Huxley wrote, “I
would willingly agree to any law which
would send him to the treadmill.” Cer-
tainly high school students have no need
to prove for themselves that dietary
deﬁciencies can. be fatal and they learn
nothing but hardness of heart from
either these experiments or from some
of the others now popular—such as, for
instance, the inoculation of rodents or
chicks with cancer. In their literature
class they probably read “The Ancient,
Mariner” and are asked to comment
upon:

He prayeth best who loveth best
All things both great and small.

But a bright student might be inclined
to reply that praying in schools is for-
bidden anyhow, and at least one teacher
is reported to have brushed criticism

18

aside by explaining that students were
sternly forbidden to regard their Victims
as pets or to take any interest in them
as individuals. Another teacher, when
asked why it was necessary to perform
actual experiments when published ac-
counts and photographs Were available,
replied that “using live animals fasci-
nates the youngsters.” He added that it
wouldn’t do to stop the experiment be-
fore death ensued because death made
it “more dramatic” and “the children
are not convinced unless the critters
die.”

 

THERE are, of course, laws against
cruelty to animals, but I have never
heard of a case where they were invoked
to prevent any torture that claimed to
have a scientiﬁc purpose. In fact, many,
though not all, laboratory physiologists
have bitterly opposed all the various
bills introduced (chieﬂy, so far, without
success) that would set up standards
governing the treatment of laboratory
animals—Senate Bill $1071, for instance.
But does anyone dare say that no labo-
ratory worker could possibly have a
touch of sadism in him or even that
routine familiarity with torture might
make him callous? The very fact that
laboratory experiments are conducted
behind closed doors makes it all the
more desirable that some sort of control
or inspection be provided for. In Eng-
land, where all possibly painful experi-
ments must be licensed by the Home
Ofﬁce, eighty-eight biological fellows of
the Royal Society answered a question-
n aire in which they were asked whether
or not they opposed these existing con-

trols, whether they believed they pre-
vented the highest level of medical
research, and whether they found in
their own experience that control seri-
ously frustrated legitimate results. Of the
eighty-eight, only one replied “Yes” to
any of the three questions; the rest gave
a “No” to all three. Among comments
from eminent persons were:

Sir Francis Walshe, F.R.S.: “A wide
familiarity with the literature of experi-
mental neuro-physiology leads me to
think that in other countries where no
such rational mode of control is used,
quite a few futile and unnecessarily
painful animal experiments are carried
out by persons not always qualiﬁed to
do them.”

Professor A. T. Phillipson, deputy di-
rector of the Rowett Research Institute:
“I am glad to hear the Americans are
trying to introduce a bill similar to our
Ofﬁce Act.”

Professor A. Habbow, F.R.S., direc-
tor of the Chester Betty Cancer Research
Institute: “I have, of course, been most
interested to learn of the American bill
and sorry to hear of opposition to it.”

Nobel Prize-winner Professor H. A.
Krebs: “I am very glad indeed to sup-
port a movement to introduce in. the
United States legislation similar to that
operating in Great Britain. My answer
to all three questions which you formu—
lated at the end of your letter is a simple
‘No.’ ”

I

,
ONE similar bill was recently intro- ,.
duced in one of the American state legi‘s—f
latures, whereupon an amendment was
offered speciﬁcally exempting high
school laboratories from any supervision
or restriction. In the Middle Ages any
cruelty was justiﬁed if it could be said
to be in the defense of true religion;
much the same is true today if science
is substituted. But one does not have to
oppose all vivisection to ask that the
experimenter should be required to
show, not merely that he could learn
something from some horrible cruelty,
but that what he could learn is impor-
tant enough to be alleged as an excuse.
I wonder, for instance, about the experi-
ment recently reported to determine
how much ﬁre dogs could breathe with-
out dying. The experimenter said that
the Army “wanted to know.” Why it
wanted to know was not explained, but
perhaps it was in order to make sure
that its flame throwers were sufﬁciently
lethal.

We like to tell ourselves that civiliza-
tion has made us more humane. Our
newspapers no longer carry advertise-
ments like the following from a British
periodical in 1730: “A mad bull, dressed
up with ﬁreworks, is to be turned loose
. . . likewise a dog dressed up with ﬁre—

works; also a bear to be turned loose.
N.B.—A cat is to be tied to the bull’s

tail.” Bear-baiting was officially prohib-
ited in England in 1835 and a few years
earlier the ﬁrst law making cruelty to
animals an offense per se was passed—
over, incident-ally, vigorous opposition
in Parliament by those who called them-
selves anti~sentimentalists. Nevertheless,
it sometimes seems that Emerson’s Law
of Compensation really does work—both
ways. Perhaps there is less suffering in-
ﬂicted upon animals that is frankly for
pleasure but there is probably much
more of it—quantitatively, at least—in
the interest of scientiﬁc knowledge.
Killing for fun and death as a spec-
tacle are not, however, unknown today.
In Tucson, Arizona, the head of a
certain printing organization that op-
poses most of the present game laws
abandoned the usually mealy-mouthed,
gun-manufacturers’ explanation of the
wholesome effects of killing animals for
fun . (i.e., outdoor exercise, contact with
nature, making fathers pals with their
sons, and so forth) for the statement
that children ought to make early con-
tact “With life and death.” And frank
‘. though that was, it wasn’t quite com-
pletely so. What he meant was not
“familiarity with death” but “familiarity
with killing,” which is a rather different
thing. And there is surely some doubt
that there are not enough opportunities
today to become familiar with that. We
who have had the privilege of living in
the Century of Progress have, as a mat-
ter of fact, had more opportunities to
take killings of one sort or another for
granted than had either our fathers or
our grandfathers.

BRHAPS it is because there has been
so much killing in our time that there
seems to have been a reversal of the
once-evident trend away from ritual
violence. Perhaps the fun killings staged
by some of the veterans’ organizations
that invite young folks to club rabbits
to death is only a survival of a concept
of sport Widely prevalent down to the
nineteenth century. But there is no
doubt that bullﬁghting (once regarded
as decidedly un—American) has become
a smart diversion. Nor is its popularity
conﬁned to the Southwest, where the
corridas (a little Spanish adds a touch
of chic) staged just across the border
are not only regularly advertised in our
newspapers but often given critical re-
views. Hemingway’s blood lust no doubt
had something to do with the rise of the
fashion, but his celebration of the bull-
ﬁght as the most reﬁned expression of
the sadistic impulse met with widespread
response.

A few years ago, during a Congres-
sional hearing, a witness introduced a
memo from an advertising manage-r to
the producer of a TV serial his company
was sponsoring: “More violence and
more bosoms.” A great deal has been

SR/March 27, 1965

written in quite proper protest against
the violence that runs so consistently
not only through TV melodramas and
through the animated cartoons, but also
through even the Disney nature ﬁlms,
where ritual ﬁghts (often carefully
staged) play a large part. How much all
these things are creating a taste, how
much merely responding to it, would be
hard to know, but less has been written
about the increasing element of violence,
danger, and death in the so—called spec-
tator Sports. American football (which a
recent English critic called “not violent
enough for a war, but too violent for a
game”) is relatively mild by comparison
with air shows and auto races, though
even in football there are some spec-
tators whose excitement is increased by
the fact that fatal injuries are at least a
very real possibility. And as far as the
air shows and races are concerned,
their danger is frankly stressed in the
advertisements.

THE most penetrating discussion I
have ever seen of the part played by the
ever-present threat of death at an auto
race occurs, oddly enough, in a Bantam
paperback called When Engines Roar.
These “nineteen action-packed true sto-
ries capture all the daring and drama of
the greatest moments in auto racing his-
tory” and are obviously directed at
aﬁcionados. But the volume does never—
theless include an article “The Psychol-
ogy of Auto Racing,” by one Raymond
d-e Beker, which is reprinted from The
Annual Automobile Review.

Mr. de Beker cites a variety of appeals
that the spectacle of auto racing can and
does make: Speed is one of the more
spectacular achievements of technology
and all aspects of technology fascinate
modern man; crowds, noise, and mass
hysteria offer an escape from the trou-
bled self, and so forth, and so forth. But
the principal conclusion that emerges
from the analysis is foreshadowed by the
opening sentence: “Motor races are just

  
 

as essential a part of modern life as glad-
iatorial combats were in ancient Rome.”

After disposing rather briefly of the
less obvious appeals, the author develops
fully an analysis of the most powerful
ones. “In no other sport . . . is the danger
of death so imminent. At Le Mans death
reaped eighteen victims in a matter of
seconds . . . and though the spectators
have every intention of running risks
only by proxy, it happens that fate pan-
ders over-zealously to a taste that con-
science scarcely dares to admit.” Hence
(as he might have added but didn’t)
it is all rather as though the spectator at
the bullﬁght was occasionally tossed into
the arena or the Roman fan at the Coli-
seum found himself, though no Christian,
suddenly in the middle of the lions.
(Which would have served him right
enough.)

Mr. de Beker then concludes: “Man-
kind has reached a dangerous corner.
. . . [He] seeks to perceive what fate this
machine holds in store for him and to
experience vicariously the pains of death
and rebirth it involves. He wants to
know if he can become the superman
who deﬁes the laws of space, the mecha-
nized centaur he visualizes in the cham—
pion, and avoid the catastrophe which
alarms yet attracts him as flame does a
moth.”

When I began to write this piece the
moral I would have drawn from the
bull ring and the race course would have
been" implied in the question just how
far the spectator at either is from the
Emperor Commodius, whom Suetonius
describes as leaning over the box to stare
intently into the face of the gladiator
dying a few feet away. Now, however, I
wonder if the auto race isn’t, unlike the
bullﬁght, something new rather than
merely a recrudescence. Perhaps its chief
signiﬁcance is what Mr. de Beker makes
it—as a ritual presentation of man face
to face with the machine which he half
hopes and half fears may put an end to
him at last.

Double Jeopardy: U.N. and Vietnam

a showdown in the recent session
of the United Nations General As-
sembly against states that hadn’t met
their payments for the peace-keepin g op-
erations of the U.N. The United States
argued that it was not for individual
nations to determine whether assess-
ments were unreasonable and improper.
They were obligated to support the U.N.
whether they liked it or not. France and
the Soviet Union didn’t like it. Desperate
attempts to ﬁnd a formula for averting
an ominous confrontation all failed.
The General Assembly adjourned in the
deepest gloom it has known since 1945.
‘It might be argued that the United
States didn’t take into account the fact
that a showdown could be far less dam-
aging to the Soviet Union in particular
than to the United Nations in general.
As against this was the need to gain
acceptance for the principle of compul-
sory Obligations in matters concerned
with keeping the peace. In the sense that
the development of a higher sovereignty
for preserving the peace is the largest
single challenge of the twentieth cen-
tury, a defense canbe made for the
American position on assessments.

But the American argument for sup-
porting the authority of the United N a-
tions was negated only a few days later
by the United States itself when it
spurned the call by Secretary-General
U Thant for a conference looking toward
an effective resolution of the war crisis
in Vietnam. The principle we sought to
uphold against the Soviet Union and
France we set aside when our own in-

20

T HE UNITED STATES pressed for

terests were directly involved. Is it ar-
gued that the two cases are not similar?
That the ﬁrst case involved ﬁnancial
obligations and the second a situation in
which the United States was already
committed to a ﬁxed course of action?
The underlying principle in both cases
has to do with the primacy Of the U.N.
in dealing with threats to world peace.
The action in Suez and the Congo, which
produced the ﬁnancial crisis, was carried
out in the interests of world peace. The
action of the Secretary-General in calling
for a conference over Vietnam was ad-
vanced in the interests of world peace.
It is difﬁcult to assert that the U.N. en-
joys supranational status in ﬁxing dues
for peace-keeping Operations while
downgrading the role of the U.N. in
peace-keeping itself.

Perhaps it will be said that the U.N.
had no effective way of acting in Viet-
nam since not all parties to the dispute
were members of the U.N. But the point
at issue here is not whether the U.N.
could or could not have been effective in
mounting an armed action in Vietnam
similar to its action in Korea or Suez or
the Congo. What the U.N. tried to do
was to initiate negotiations in a Situation
fast spiraling into a large-scale war. The
United States declined U Thant’s re-
quest with thanks. It was almost as
though we were sending regrets for our
inability to accept an invitation to a ball.

If France and the Soviet Union
seemed cavalier in their attitude toward
the United Nations, the attitude Of the
United States verged on condescension.
One would suppose by this time that the

United Nations does not exist for the
purpose of making polite inquiries to
concerned parties in questions of war
and peace but for the hard and imper-
sonal purpose of keeping this planet
from atomic incineration.‘

Sooner or later the American people
are going to have to make up their mind
about what they want their government’s
position on the United Nations to be. So
far, our position on the U.N. has been to
give it full backing—up to the point
where it impinges on the basic thrust of
our foreign policy. Essentially, the U.N.
has not been primary in our foreign
policy. Primary elements include our
nuclear stockpiles, our bases, NATO,
SEATO, and our direct presence in. var-
ious countries.

But if Vietnam has taught us anything,
it is that the old policy of alliances, stock-
piles, and bulging muscles is no longer
the prime or workable instrument it
was in the pre-atomic world of dis-
connected national units. NATO hasn’t
worked in Europe. SEATO hasn’t worked
in Indo-China. Raw force hasn’t worked
in Vietnam, either for France or the
United States. But our response to the
new facts of life is to put more of the
unworkables to work instead of making
a total commitment to the development
of a collective mechanism for creating
workable world law.

It is not solely geography that is inter—
connected in an atomic age. Actions are
interconnected. We are pursuing a policy
in Vietnam without regard to the effects
on other elements bearing on our total
security. The whole effort to keep the
Soviet Union and Communist China
from coming together in a vast military
coalition; the need to keep the nations
of Africa and Asia from veering toward
Communist China; the need to keep a
world organization competitive with the
U.N. from being formed with Peking at
the center; the need to create conditions
that will make possible increasing control
over the highly combustible nuclear
arms race—all these are interconnected;
all are affected adversely by the decision
to Spurn the good ofﬁces of the U.N. in
Vietnam.

Equally important but largely dis-
regarded is the connection between Sai-
gon and Selma. Until President Johnson
spoke before Congress last week, it was
becoming increasingly difﬁcult for Amer-
icans to explain to themselves or anyone
else the contrast represented by the reso-
lute policy Of the United States in put-
ting down disorders in Vietnam while
observing zealous circumspection in Ala-
bama. The President did honor to him-
self and the nation in recognizing the
role Of the US. in the Selmas of the
South. He will do equal honor to the
nation and the hopes for world peace in
recognizing the role of the U.N. in the
Vietnams of the world. —N.C.

Chancellor Brandt’s European Policy Unfolds

Any lingering fancy that there might be a diplo-
matic shortcut to easing the division of Europe
has been laid to rest in Kassel, the Weét German
‘tovVn where Chancellor Brandt has just met East
”German Premier wan Stoph. Their first meeting,
at ‘Erfurt' in March, was dominated by the common
tsenSe‘of its being historic simply because it had
taken place. At Kassel the fundamental issue was
joined. Mr. Brandt put forth abold program con-
ceding the- Communist regime’s “inner sovereignty”
lone word away from formal recognition), offering
fto-exChange “plenipotentiaries” (ambassadors in all
but: name), and proposing a range of steps to
normalize and humanize daily relations between
Germans. Mr. Stoph responded with. a blunt and
abusive demand that first Bonn recognize East
Germany as a fully sovereign state. There the Ger-
man dialogue, at least in its summit aspect, now
rests.
’-‘ That it rests, however, does not mean it has
been of no avail. First, the dialogue has cleared
the air, showing Willy Brandt to be clear-sighted
and responsible, and leaving the East German
leadership plainly exposed as the scared and uncivil
defender of a dated status quo. Second, West Ger-
many—having laid its cards on the table-mean pro-
ceed with its diplomatic initiatives in Warsaw and
Moscow free of reproach that it is sacrificing con-
; cern for fellow Germans to ambitions for its own
international role. Since a major purpose of the
Brandt Eastern policy has been to build confidence
in independent German action, both in East and
West, these are not insubstantial gains. Certainly
they go beyond mere atmospherics into shaping the
basic attitudes by which nations are judged and
which contribute in turn to their stature and self-
confidence.

For all of East Germany’s centrality to Bonn, it

has been apparent all along that the prospects of ,
movement were much better with Poland and
Russia. Poland, a country and a culthre removed
from Bonn, feels safer; Russia’s apprehensions are
overlaid by its own power. If Chancellor Brandt
can bring his public to accept formal acknowledge.
ment of Oder- Neisse as Poland’s permanent western
frontier—«not so hard, now that so much time has
passed—~then a major gun in the East’s propaganda
armory will have been spiked and Poland will be
that much more free and anxious to nudge East
Germany toward some relaxation. If Chancellor,
Brandt can obtain Soviet agreement to a renunciar
tion-of—force pact, then East Germany will no longer
be able to hide behindthe example of Soviet
intransigence. Of course, something will have to
give inside Pankow: the Ulbricht-Stoph team’s
stance makes Thieu and Ky look supple. But over
a peiiod of time, the moderating ferment at work
everywhere else in Europe should begin to take _
effect there too.

What with all the political interest in the various
forums of East-West discourse, it should not be
forgotten that Europe is a pretty relaxed place.
Far more than anyone anticipated in the ‘bitterest
days of the cold war, it has learned to live with
its division. Political agreements to ease that...
artificial condition are desirable and should be

_ sought, and could add to the continent’s safety and

welfare. But a fair case can be made that Europe,
divided as it is, has never enjoyed such an agree-
able combination of security and economichealth.
This simple fact, too often unremarked, takes the
edge of m dency off the current European talks.
Consider, for instance, the pressures on Mr Nixon
in respect to Vietnam; by comparison, Willy Brandt
is his own man. We do not point this out in order
to undermine the chancellor’s policy but to suggest
that time is on his side. He is helping it along.

Joseph Wood Krutch:

Not many men who brave or battle the strain
’ of the cities for a major part of their lives get to
, leave it all behind and go back to the earth, to live
according to the land ethic. Joseph Wood Krutch
was one who made the pilgrimage, and his death
last week at 76 in the Arizona desert left many
L calling him a 20th Century Thoreau. The descrip-
tion does not fit exactly; but a fair chance exists
i-that the books and essays that Krutch produced in
fgreat‘number about the mysteries and sacredness
of nature will be read as long as those of the odd
man of Walden.

Longbefore saving the environment became a
best-selling term, Krutch saw ominous signs that”
something was going wrong. “In our time,” he
wrote, “we seem to have been increasingly aware
how persistently and brutally groups of men under-
take to eliminate one another. But it is not only
the members of his own kind that man seems to
want to push off the earth. When he moves in,
nearly eVerything else suffers from his intrusion».
sometimes because he wants the space they occupy

.flected on his decision: “I hoped .

and the food they eat, jbut often simply because
when he sees a creature not of his kind or a man
not his race his first impulse is ‘kill it ’ ”

When he first began to read what are called
“nature writers,” Krutch was an urban journalist
seeking escape literature. Years later, after aban-
doning the metropolis for the desert and Writing
elegantly about the natural world himself, “he re-‘
. . to meet myself
face to face, to be compelled, indeed to do so. In
the busy life I had been lea-ding ithwas too easy to
think only of immediate tasks and to solve, only
immediate intellectual problems.”

The importance of the rlife of Joseph Wood
Krutch, aside from the wealth of written ideas and
thoughts left behind, is what it says about rever- '
ence for the earth. This is a vitally needed activity
of man, even more so today. As Krutch asked many
times in many diffe1ent ways, if we cannot learn .
to cherish and revere the lower forms of life how.
can we do this to the higher forms—such as one s '
neighbor or brother? ' '

Dear Mrs. Stephens ,
Thank you very much for your full and careful
answer to my questions.
I am still struggling wiagtgha article which
does not pretend to be a discussion in dataxxx of existing laws

but simply an attack on the assumption thgf‘waientists do n t
need to be responsible to outside 'hg¢,:‘,g‘”3e6ause éﬁhegcannot be

suspected of devotion to anything except trﬁtL and would not perform
frivolous, callous or merely sadistic experiments.
My these; is that sadistic impulses have been present in
all cultures and certinly are in ours. The occassions and excuses
vary( "Fashions in Cruelty") but it is always operative — frankly
in the Roman arena or the Elizabethn beafring, disguised in the
bullfight/ and certainly present in laboratories where it is especially
dangerous today just because Science now occupies a position
very much like that once held by religion, My article is primarilly
a history of the various manifestations of cruelty as entertainment
leading up to‘gged%lea not to suppose that our culture is exempt

or that a laboratoiy xx wmxkstworker may not be, consciously or

Dear as. Krutch,

I am sorry to boar that you have been ill and hope you will to
feeling much better soon. To answer your questions, (1) Yes, it is
true that in England all potentially painful sxpsrimcnts arc performed
under the jurisdiction of the Home Office. The axpsrimsntsr must be
licensed, and there are different types of certificates for ssporimants,
depending on their nature. '

With regard to the second part of your first question, I would say
that, in practice, your statsmcnt is basically correct. However, if
the Departmsntcf Health, Education and welfare wished to interfere and
question, it could do so because, through the national Institutes of
health, it provides so great a proportion of the funds available to do
sxporimnnts on anhmals. The N13 has acted administratively to set up
certain requirements before the institutions to which it gives grants
for human experimentation-can carry out these experiments. They could
do the same.for animal experiments if they had the will to do so. Un~
fortunately, the Dopartmnnt of HEW has consistently sought to whitewash
rather than to reform laboratory conditions for animals, and it was not
till the U.S. Department of Agriculture was empowered by Public Law
89-5hh to enter laboratories to inspect and set minimum standards for
care and housing of the animals, that the most ghastly abuses wars
rectified. U$Da does not have authority to set standards fOr animals

We hope that tho Whitehurst Bill, H.R. 13957, will he passed boa
cause it would extend the jurisdiction of the U.S. Dopartmsnt of Agri-
culture veterinarians to all species of scrapbloodsd animals throughout
their entire stay in the laboratory. It would enable than to act stand~
ards for adequate veterinary care, a very important consideration. they
would not be given jurisdiction over oxpcrimcntal design, but tho
humane influence which.has been well begun under thhir snforcamnnt'of
P.L. 89~Shh would be greatly strengthened and enlarged by snactmant of
the Whitshurst Bill. . . .

In answer to your question about the statsmsnts from your article,
I do not find anything flatly unfactual, but your own reference to in—
terpretation is of interest because I do believe that the reader does «
not at a clear picture of ths situation today as it has changed under_*
the i lusnce of laboratory insnsction bstSDn, For instance. althcuah

inspection of laboratories, msny, indeed, most, (like the meet packers .-
sfter passage of the Humsne Slaughter set) no longer object. In fact,
most institutions make no objection to allowing USDn veterinarians to
inspect snimsls under experhmentstion as well as those not being experi-
mented on, although a strict interpretation of P.L. 89-5hh allows them .
to refuse theinspector snmittence to arses where animals are under actual
research. Some institutions do make this requsl, end that is one of
the ressons why the Whitehnrst Bill should be passed. However, the
concept of the closed doors of a laboratory was essentially mmch.mone
,true in 1966 then it is today. In 1970.1t is much harder to gain ad-
mittance to a monkey dealer's premises than it is to get into a labora-
tory. At least, that is the.experience of Animal Welfare Institute
Laboratory Animal Consultant, Dorothy Dyce._ The monkey dealers aren't

' regulated, and they fear.it. The laboratories, though.the regulation

to which they are subject is modest, do show a response to outside in~
,spection which.hns resulted in solid progress for the welfare of animals.

The hard lines of opposition to any kind or regulation have dis-
appeared,

Also, this year for the first time, the Heatinghouse Science Talent
Search had no cruel experiments whatever. Westinghouse had considerable
adverse publicity concerning last year's ghastly projects in the press
es well as in the Information Report, and though.they castigated us as
unfair in the letters they wrote to our members who complained, when
it came to the awarding of prizes this year, they completely eliminated
projects that involved students in causing pain or death to animals.

sessill have to continue.to work hard, and I-fear over an extended
period, to eliminate cruelty to experimental antrals, but progress is
tbeing made. ~ - , '

I hope the above is helpful in giting you general background. I
look forward to reading your article. ’ .

Dear Mrs. Stevens,

I am writing an article( of which I think you will
approve) called "Fashions in Cruelty: the Arena, the Eullring and the
Laboratory"

I get your Information Report and try to follow
legislation and proposed lngusx legislation but it gets to be very
complicated and, besides, I have been so seriously ill in recent months
that 1 have not kept up at all.

Naturally I am very anxious to have my facts correct and
up to dateggnd I am hoping that you will be good enough to xxxmxx answer
two questions.

Am I right in assuming
(1) ixaxnnmiathat it is still true that in England all
potentially painful experiments must be licensed by the Home Office ,

any . U
whereas in the United States Kg‘recognized scientifzinstitution

may conduct any experiment"whatsoever without inter erence or questioning
by any authority outside itself.? of fact
(1) Do you think that any statement in the sentences from my
article enclosed on a separate sheet could bellnnn called in
question so far as the fact itser( as distinguished from interpretation!

of it) is concerned.

1 hope that you will, not think that I am asking too much

Sincerely, : ' E: E

Jospeh Wood Krutch

for this information.

 




Statements taken verbatim from my articlqu:

"In the United States attempts to pass laws similar to those
enforcedmin Great britain have been violently opposed and finally
defeated by various scientific groups on the grounda7that xxx
scientists must be alowed to police themselves and that no scientist
attatched to a reputable institution can be suspected of callusnesszL’f
to say nothing of sadism/. The result is that almost anyone who
excuses himself on the ground that his experimantes will contribute to
knowledge may do pretty much anything he likes. Even in highschool

cruel experiments a conducted frankly as demonstrations of what
is already known rather than in orderLto discover any new truths--—-

Introduction

Most people are aware that in the United States there
are laws, against cruelty to animals, as well as various or-
ganizations devoted to animal welfare. They may occasion-
ally read in their newspapers that someone has been fined

, 3 . - for some outrageous barbarity, but such a bit of news only
1:“ 3‘ confirms their comfortable'assumption that, thejlaws are '
' adequate and functioning.
.3 3,3.M3..__ 7, I .3 ' '..,-,..A11)"()n€ with such an opiniOn is due for a shock when
he reads this hoolt. Every day, almost every hour, helpless ‘
animals are undergoing terrible ordeals. They are neg—
Elected, tormented for Sport, or subjected to ingenious
I tortures in laboratories. The laws are inadequate, and in-
adequately enforced, and tlieyremain so partly because
7 men and Women of good will are ignorant or inactive while
thf‘iserwho profit from the various cruelties actively oppose
new regulations or nullify their effectiveness by suppOrting
’ '"'13":;_"'3’{gf'3arnendments or the refusal to vote adequate funds for en—
” fo'rcement.}With the. publication of this book no one need
- " f remain ignOrant or complacent. 3 _
i i if ‘i *,‘;{:'1C'(){Ckﬁgllts, dogfights, and the rest may be only faint
' surﬁvivals from a brutal past when thousands of animals
”were slaughtered at a single performance in the Roman
arena or every availableltind of animal suffered in Eliza-
. bethan bear rings to titillate the sadistic lusts of the public.

usually more or less clandestine, though still more com-
mon than most people imagine. But, as is often the case
in our society, new evils have arisen to take the place of
hose which have been'controlled. We have no Coliseum
and no advertised bear-rings. Even bullfighting, though
regarded in some circles as a smart spectator sport, is illegal
in the United States. But private torture behind closed
doors has probably never before flourished so widely as it
now does in scores of laboratories, including those in gram- 3
mar and high schools. ' '
Of all the forms of deliberate cruelty prevalent those
"which take place under the banner of Science. are the most
nearly immune to criticism. Once the Inquisition Was not
only tolerated but justified because it was supposed to
operate in defense of a Church beyond criticism. Today
‘ Science is similarly sacrosanct. \Vhatever is done in a
laboratory by men who call themselves scientists is assumed
to be justiﬁed. Scientists are assumed to be intelligent and
dedicated men. They would not. torture an animal unless
there were compelling reasons for doing so. Do we not owe
to their investigations the blessings of modern medicine? 3
Such comfortableconvictions can hardly survive the 7'
evidence of this book. And yet, though the United States
is far behind England, where many leading Scientists hayem
criticized our apparent inhumanity in the name of Science,.., "i . 5
attempts to bring our laws up to minimum standards are ‘ l "i
being actively resisted by special interests. , 3
Animal abuse is widespread and various in'v-‘tfhe United
States. It goesunder many names, “Science" beingfionly

others. Perhaps this unwarranted cruelty is due to the same
human indifference that threatens our wildlife, our for-
ests, our waterways and our air. a

The present book is a clear, factual survey of every
important aspect of its subject. It df’awsupon many sources
and should be, among other things, an indispensable body
of evidence for any individual or organization in any way
concerned with the ordeal of the animals.

looked, though there are almost as many rats as peeple in
the big city. ' ‘

On occasion, some of the daily papers do report in
detail, and of these The. New York Times is the best
example. The readers of that newspaper can he sure of
,keeping reasonably up to date on such experiments as
the one conducted hy a famous endocrinologist on more
than 15,000 rats. He was studying the effects of ex—
treme stress and hoped to demonstrate that all forms of
physical and neurological stress produced similar or
identical terminal ellects. Before he ran out of new

ways to torture rats to death, 14 years had passed and
15,000 rats had died. Any scientist could have told the

endocrinologist that a few hundred rats, at the most,
\.\'oul'l haye proycd his point; and that the point itsell‘ \\as
not new. But except for the years involved, this was not
an unusual case. At this very moment, some scientist
semeu'here may he ordering thousands of dogs and cats

' and. monkeys to prove the same point once again. It’s

curious how curious a scientist can be.

All this and more has been aired in one congres—
sional hearing alter the other, but nothing much happens.
In fact, sometimes the Government itself is the worst of—
fender. For example:

Long after the University of Pennsylvania had es—
tablished the standard for scalding animals, the Ollice of
Naval Research supported a scalding experiment with
43 female dogs. The bitches were anesthetized, then
dipped into water heated to 185 degrees Fahrenheit.

After regaining consciousness, none of the bitches was

 




Anything Goes to

given anesthesia or sedati1'e. Most died within 24 hours.

The \Valter Reed Army Institute of Research, in
an apparent eliort to prove that pain can be the mother of
clear thinking, implanted wire electrodes in the pain
areas of the brains ‘of nine monkeys. The monkeys were
under anesthesia during the surgery, a kindness that
1 would pl‘UVe to be ironic. Several days later, the monkey,s
all fully conscious, were restrained in steel chairs, and
electric current was applied to the implanted electrodes.

r he monkeys sho11ed facial grimacing, closure of
both eyes, high pitched vocalization, and generalized
motor activity," reads the report in a euphemistic de—
scription of monkeys screaming their pain and strug
.gling madl1 111th their bonds. No one had told the mon-
ke1s that there 1111s an escape from all this scientific pain.
All the1 had to do was press a switch and the electric
current would automatically diminish Most of the mon-
ke1s found the switch within six hours, and nobody re— .
ally kno11s 11 hcther the1 found relief through accident
or brilliance. The gruesome experiment 11as repeated
uninterruptedly for 2.4 hours, and in all that time the
monkeys 11 ere allowed no food, water, or rest.

But these are only mild examples of Government—
sponsoied, well- intentioned (perhaps) cruelty. More to
the point is the fact that \\ ashington grants over a
billion dollars a 1ear to medical research. Much of this
research-is needed, but lar too much of it is needlessly
repetitive, and far too much of it——on the laboratory
level——-is needlessly cruel.

Strangely, or at least it appears strange to the aver-

age taxpayer, the billionplus dollars are granted without
supervision or controls. The money is federal, but
the lav1s oi most states pro1ide. laboratories with immu-

Detroit, hopefully, will be able to design a safer auto—
Mobile. But Ford, General Motors and Washington
seem to have their doubts about that, and grants from all
three are currently supporting advanced experiments at
one university laboratory in the fields of brain concussion
and the displacement of body organs as the result
of sudden crashes. The experiments take consider-
.able time and efiort, so, on an average, only two animals
a week are torn apart or battered to death. Thus far, dogs
and monkeys are the favorite victims, and—as just one
of the tests—time hammers or pneumatic clubs are
clamped on their skulls. “The animals must be kept alive
during experimentation, because dead tissues react dif-
ferently than living tissues,” reads one report.

“as (‘ougress ever heard about these instruments of
torture, and about the Blalock press in particular? The
House of Representatives heard about it as far back as
1962 when the late Fred Meyers, executive director of
The Humane Society of the United States, reported:

On the table here, I have an instrument known
in medical research circles as the Blalock press. It some-
what resembles, as you can see, an old—fashioned print-
ing press in which one plate can be forced against an
opposing face by a screw arrangement. In the Blalock
press both plates have rows of dull steel teethﬂ Trans-
versely, there is a slot about two inches wide.

This press, used in scores of experiments extend-
ing over many years, is used to crush the leg of a dog.
A hind leg of a dog is inserted in the transverse slot,
which is provided so that ﬂesh may be crushed to a
pulp without breaking the bones of the leg. The press ‘

 




Ordeal of the Animals 13

can be calibrated so that measLirahle pressures ranging
from 500 to 5,000 pounds per square inch can be ex-
erted. .

Let me descril'ae, precisely, the use of this press by
a University of Rochester group, as reported in Volume
'24, No. 2 oi: the journal. of Clinical Investigation,
dated March 1945. This group crushed more than 400
dogs in a Blalock press in a study of the eiiects and
causes of shock.

- In all cases, the. Rochester experimenters anesthe-
tized the. dog before pressure of 2,000 pounds per
square inch was applied to the dog’s leg. Each dog re-
mained in the press for several hours and "in no case"
was any anesthetic given during the last hour in the
press. Nor was any anesthesia or sedative given later,
while the dog lived.

The dogs usually died, in extreme pain, in from
live to twelve hours after being released from the press,
but some dogs survived the ordeal for :4 hours. Dogs
-~fllll} conscious—w were tied down on a table for
twelve hours after being talv'en out of the press. And
l must repeat, none was given any drug to reliexc pain.

_ In a study of medical periodicals a research team
oi the llSUS (ll lumane Society of the United States)
has found reports of 143 other projects in which dogs
were subjected to the Blalock press or to virtually iden
tical equipment and procedures, the total number of
animals used in these speciiic experiments being more
than 4.000. Our research of the literature was by no
means exhaustive.

There are various other ways of sending a dog into
the ltiud oi shock that is the result oil injury and pain,
and Columbia University is credited with one of the var-

Anything Goes 14

iations. There the dogs. lightly anesthetized so that the
sense of pain was not eliminated, were beaten on the hind
.legs with a rawhide mallet. A thousand blows per leg
was the average. ' i '
. The NOble—(iollip drum also produces shock in an—
imals, but its big advantage over the press method
is quantity. Mr. Meyers told the House about this ex-
perin’iental aide, too:

This other piece of equipment on the table is
'lrnown as a i\ol:)lev(lollip drum; it, too. has been very
widely used to produce shock in animals. The pro-
cedure is described in detail in an article entitled “A
Quantitative Method for the Production of Experi-
mental ‘l‘raumatic Shock \Vithout Hemorrhage in
Unanestheti/ed .\nimals." published in the Quarterly
Iottrnal of l,..\ju"iu;.u;.i. E ii'j‘ildtig'y 2,1 - 18—109, 1941-

mer, they live several conscious hours before they die
in pain.

To date, hundreds of thousands of dogs and cats and
other small animals have been tossed about in the
Noble—Collip drum and one can't be blamed for won-
dering if medical research will ever reach a conclusion
concerning shock.

The press and the drum are still with us, still grind—
ing out torture and death to millions of animals every
year. No law says they can’t be used. Indeed, lawmakers,
through grants, continue to subsidize their use. The
House found the defense of their use both reasonable
and rational. A sample of the defense; “Science has not
‘yct proved that animals suiler. To think they suffer is
anthropomorphism. \Ve believe that any reﬂex or reac-
tion is instinct and is not induced by a sensation of pain.”

So the laboratory animals, in the grips of man’s
endless devices, continue to scream out their “instincts"
and continue to die.

And we have so far had but a beginner's look at the
ordeal of the animals in the United States.

H1 MAY NOT KNO\V THAT He’s AMONG THE 11101113 F011-
tunate, but the a1erage stolen animal is lucky if he
reaches his ultimate destination in a reasonable state of
health. Care and treatment along the road to the laboraj
tory is usually as shocking as care and treatment at the
, laboratory.
' America s laboratories are now spending in the V
neighborhood of fifty million dollars per annum for
stolen pets alone. C ash on the barrelhead and no ques-
tions asked are the sales terms. The seller, or ani—_
mal dealer, employs the same terms with his suppliers,
also known as thieves The thieves sell by the head or by
the pound Sex, age breed and qualit1 ol the animals
are unimportant factors and do not aﬂect the going rates.
The thieves operate from coast to coast, although in
recent years they have stepped up. their activities in cer-
tain states West Virginia New York, New Jersey,
Virginia, Maryland, Ohio, North Carolina, California,
Utah and Florida. Ofihand, it Would seem that pet own-
ers in those states are more careless concerning supen 1—
sion, but that’s not the case. The thieves think nothing
of in1 ading the yards and homes of private owners, and
kennels, large and small are also considered hne hunting
grounds. The popularity of the named states is based on

Ordeal Of the Animals '17

I business logic: all are within convenient driving distance
to some of the nation 5 biggest animal dealers.

Thus, the trucks roaring down the highways do not
always carry the cargoes their outside signs proclaim. In-
stead of poultry or furniture or groceries, the truck may
well be jammed with stolen cats and dogs. And for many
of the captives, the truck has been home lor se1eral days.
A waterless, foodless, lightless home, the air reeking
with the Stench of their own excrement. It usually takes
a few days for even the most accomplished thieves to

Then it’s on to the animal dealer’s Warm the col
lection point from whence—tomorrow or next week,
if they are still alive—they will be shipped to the labo-
ratories. At the average lam the pets wait their next

investigators, the 11 hole load 111.11 undergo crude surgery
for the remmal of vocal-cords. Dealers prefer to run quiet
farms. and many laboratories prefer to buy quiet animals.

Thosewho wonder if there's money to be made in
dogs and cats need look no further than the animal deal—
ers. One of the mOst acti1'e in sales to laboratories enjoys
an income of over three quarters of a million dollars a
‘year. liederal agencies are among the biggest. buyers.

of The Humane Society of the United States. In the
same year, a special United States Senate Commission
predicted thatby 1970 the monetary value of animals
used annually in laboratories would equal the value of all
livestock produced by American farms and ranches.

In this respect, 1970 is already here. That’s why
dealers’ farms continue to ﬂourish and why the curve on
stolen pets is ever upward.V,A\___clc_an, sanitary, humane

farm has yet to be discovered, but it’s difﬁcult to put a
single one out of business. If actual proof of cruelty to
animals can be obtained, and if local or state laws exist,
and if local authorities can be stirred to the boiling point,
then a conviction is possible. But even then the dealer
just pays his small fine—~for a misdemeanor, not a fel—
ony—and goes right back into business, either at his old
stand or a new one. And it is seemingly impossible to
nail a dealer on his trafiic in stolen animals. Where are
the real owners?

And always, there are the dealers’ laboratory con-
nections. The smart ones insure themselves against oc-
casional trouble by doing a little boarding on the side. For
one reason or another, lack of room or insufficient staff,
for instance, laboratories do board some of their animals
at farms. Almost always these animals have been
through one research ordeal and need time to recuper-
ate before facing another.

That was the precise case in New York State. By
some miracle, a team of humane society investigators, in-
cluding. one veterinarian, gained access to an animal
dealer’s farm. Of the hundreds of dogs present, the ma-

joritt were comalescing from major surgery. Old farm
. buildings “ere the hospitals and the convalescent
uards “ere filthy overcrowded pens. DOgs with open
- chest wounds and badly infected incisions, so weak
that many could not stand, were the order of the day.
These dogs were “recuperating" from open-heart and
kidney surgery. A litter of two—day-old pups were found
in a basket with no food provisions in sight. VA bitch in
he1 last hours of pregnancy, bleeding from lacerations re-
ceived in a dogﬁght, was found in a pen with ﬁfty

yersities Lin hospitals. and the United States Depart-
ment of Health. lu1tl1ermorc, the lamp had been in—
spected several times by the state's own department of
health, and it had been found clean and suitable." End
of case.

The smart dealer is always prepared for intruders
and can “axe a hstful of legitimate bills of sale. While'
t_l1i€\€‘S are important suppliers, he cant always depend
on them for quantity or variety. So he has his own col-
lecrion trucks rolling through the countryside, visiting
rural and backwoods points on schedule. The local peo-
ple dont know him, but they lU'JO“ that his truck will
be p11rl<1d behind the old hotel opposite the courthouse

Laboratory Road 20

will buy almost anything—dogs, pups, cats, kittens, rab-
bits. hamsters, pigeons, chickens-all at pennies per
pound The poorer the community, the faster the truck
loads

Another cheap source of supply is the animal auc—
tion. It may be news to city people, but these auctions
are weekly events in all rural areas. The animals arrive
in boxes, crates, sacks and bags and are dumped into
holding pens until ready for the gavel. An obvi—
ously purebred dog may bring ten dollars, or a few dol-
lars more if he’s accompanied by falsified'registration pa-
pers. A litter of mongrel pups may bring a dollar. At
these auctions, a dealer has no trouble replenishing his
supply at economy rates. And sometimes he ﬁnds the
auction a great place to unload his overstock. It’s always"
cheaper to sell than to feed. ’

The dealers seldom seem. to be worried about over-
stock however. Sooner or later an order will come from .
1 l11h11ratory.and that s 11 here the dollars are. Meanwhile,
if the dealer holds on to enough of e\ en thing, enough _
will survive to fill the order. A look at humane society re-
ports from just a few states tells the whole, nauseating
Story:

INDIANA: ”Animals were crowded in small wire
cagt . with wire bottoms. Cages were stacked in tiers,
with urine and feces from upper cages dripping on ani-
mals in lower units. ’9 Ol‘ added interest is the fact that
the dealers b1other, a \eteiinaiian, was drawing blood
from the caged dogs to iulhll his own orders from one of
the nation s leading pharmaceutical companies.

 




Ordeal of the Animals 21

PENNSYLVANIA: “It was a chamber of horrors.
The stench alone was enough to tell the story,” this re-
ferring to 4,000 rabbits crowded into small cages that
had never been cleaned. The rabbits were in a barn along

with 400 cats stuffed in poultry crates stacked six feet'

high. Eight or nine cats were in each crate, some with
deadly feline enteritis, and others already dead. In other
buildings on the premises were several thousand pigeons,

hamsters, guinea pigs, white rats and mice. Six hundred

dogs jammed one building, with ﬁfty and more crowded
into each ten-by—ten-foot wire-covered pen. Three truck:
loads of dogs arrived while the investigation was in
progress. Puppies examined were running high temper-
atures, many dogs carried distemper, the strong walked
on top of the weak. No provisions were made for the sick
or injured animals. The little food available was green
with mold and none of the hungry animals was eating it.

Despite the evidence, this particular animal dealer's
farm must be considered one of the finest in the land. To
understand this remark, one must consult the directory
published by the National Academy of Science and the
National Research Council, and based upon information
supplied by the Institute of Laboratory Animal Re—
sources, which operates under Public Service Grant
#GM-03991, courtesy of America’s taxpayers. The di-
rectory’s foreword states: “In the area of animal quality,
the Institute has developed standards for the production,
care, maintenance, shipment and utilization of experi-
mental animals.” The farm in question is listed and
met those standards.

Too often, the Federal Government pops up as an
accessory to the’animal farm problem. A typical case
occurred in Tennessee. where humane society investiga—
tors and local law officers visited a small farm and found
conditions so deplorable that the dealer was charged
immediately with cruelty to animals. Live dogs were
penned with dead and badly decrimposed ones, to name
just one of the pieces of evidence. The dealer confessed
that-he bought and caught up to zoo stray dogs a week ,
and, sold the still—living by the pound to a kennel
in (Pennsylvania. The kennel turned out tobe another
farm and one of the largest animal suppliers to the Na-
tional Institute of Health. '

If the dealers gave free. guided tours of their farms
' to the general public, only the insane among us would
sleep well at night. As it is, the average citizen can't even
buy his way onto one of the farms, and humane society
agents are the least welcome of all. Still. the agents do
manage to get around, and they do make reports. If the
reports sound» similar, that's because animal farms are
similar. Any ten of these conditions, all gleaned from re—
ports, can he met by any animal farm in the nation: '

‘ Dam trying to nurse litter of dead pups, rooster with
' leg hanging by thread of skin, decayed ducks, sick and-
starving sheep, half-eaten dogs and rabbits. variety of
animals with open chest wounds, the still—living penned
with the dead, occupied cages stacked in the broiling
sun, drinking water black and full of garbage, rats eat-
ing a mother cat and her kittens, pups jammed into
chicken crates, ponies too weak to stand,‘ emaciated

Ordeal of the Animals 2 3

monkeys, rabbits with moldy coats, starving pigeons, in-
tense stench, dog and cat fights. piles of dead animals,
overcrowding everywhere, pens and sheds and barns that
have never beencleaned. a thousand guinea pigs occupy-
ing sixteen square feet of floor space, goat dragging
broken leg, debeaked geese, sore-covered calves, general
filth, trotted food, variety of diseased. animals, dung
so high that donkey can't stand in stall, hamsters eating
dead dog, white mice dining on dying white mice, and a
never-ending chorus of moans from the dying, suffering,
starving, bewildered representatives of the animal king-
dom. .

So a given animal’s road to a laboratory is seldom a
direct one. \Vhetber he‘s stolen, picked up as a stray, or
purchased, ther’s a detour first to the animal dealer’s
' farm. There he wait-mnever under satisfactory condi-
tionsw-until his ride to his journey's end.

One of the miracles of our form of government is
"that prolonged shouting and ample proof can sometimes
Stir our lawmakers. If a sulhcient number of organiza-
tions and private citizens shout loudly enough and long
enough. and, if they can find and haul tons of evidence
to \~\’ashington, Congress will sometimes move. That’s
just what happened in 1966, the year Congress passed
the Laboratory Animal \\'elfare Act. a bill designed to
guarantee at least minimum standards of care for the
animals used in medical research, and to cure the
abuses at the animal farm level. The Act became a law
in ]uly of 1967. and is now enforceable by the Depart-
ment of Agriculture.

 

 




Laboratory Road 24'

The animal dealers are not worried. Only a million
. and a half dollars were appropriated for the new law. Just
enough to license dealers, but not enough for even rou-
I'tine inspection and patrol of the premises. And then
even that insufﬁcient sum was watered down to 300,000
dollars, or just about enough to handle the paper work
[of licensing. As things stand now, a dealer in laboratory
animals obtains a license by certifying that he meets the
minimum standards. The Government can’t afford to in—
Spect'his farm. 80 the law'is a joke, and only the abused
animals aren’t laughing.

Nobody can realistically argue against the use of
animals in research. The lower animals have always
served tl‘ie'highest one and always will, as meat for the
table, for ”instance, no matter how vegetarians feel. And
certainly muCh of medical science would still be back in
the dark ages if researchers had not used animals in their
work.

But one can argue against needless abuses in the
laboratories. Federal, state, city, or university—they are
all are licensed and they all provide their own supervi-
sion. In varying degrees, all are supported by the taxpay-
ers’ dollars. And all are immune from existing anti-
cruelty laws, because of other laws that say that’s the
case. Such as the section under the Penal Codeof the
State of California which says, “No part of this title shall
be construed as interfering with any of the laws of this
state known as the “game laws’ or any laws for or
against the destruction of certain birds, . . . or With
properly eond‘ucted scientific experiments or iﬂVestigdé

tions performed under the authority of the Faculty of a
regularly incorporated medical college or university of
this state." (Pen. 599C) Such exceptions are typical.

So the laboratories have the public’s trustiand the
public's dollars. If those who work within their walls rev
g-ard them as sacred institution's. there’s-nothing wrong
with that attitude; Their work is for the beneﬁt of man-
kind. But what they don’tseem to understand is that the
public’s trust, not tormention money, is based upon the-
assumption that they, the scientists and medical re-
searchers.. will demonstrate a little compassion for their
animal charges. -

Even the layman understands that it is necessary
for. the animals to be conscious and unanesthetized dur—
ing certain experiments, no matter the agony of the
subjects. And that it is sometimes necessary to use ten or
a hundred Or a thousand animals to prove a point, and to
repeat the test until positive proof is assured.

But once the point has been established, is it really
necessary for scores of other laboratories and new re—
searchers to repeat, the test and waste tens of thousands
of lives iust to verify what is already known? Isn’t there
a saturation point? The public's trust is, in medical re—
search, not in superfluous medical research.

They're busy in, the laboratories, but not too busy
to be auare (if needless repetitions. And while one may
grant thein ignorance of what goes on at the animal
farms, surely some of them must be aware of conditions
on theirown premises. .

One who was aware and disturbed about them

Laboratory Road 26

was a scientist with the Food and Drug Administration.
Shocked by the living conditions of the FDAs experi-
mental animals, he leaked word to‘ Ann (‘Tottrell Free
of. the North American Newspaper Alliance. Her re—
port:

“In those windowless. sub'basement rooms, hun-
dreds of dogs Hung themselves against the bars of their
cages, piled tier on tier. They were barking, screaming,
and whining. A few were mute and dropped their heads
in the dark corners. Others circled ceaselessly in their
cages. The steel grids beneath their feet showed their
pathetic, circular path. These dogs, mostly beagles, are
used primarily for the testing of food additives. Some
remain in their cages seven yea rs.”_

it's possible that the l DA leaders had forgotten all
about the dogs in the subbasement, for they were very
busy planning a new, 26—million-dollar oilice and lal}
oratory building..So Mrs. Free checked into the plans
and discovered that the FDA—despite her recent article
and the great wave oficriticism it had provoked—in-
tended to cage its dogs in the usual manner and was-
making no provision ”(for exercise of any kind. It took four
years of crusading before the FDA relented and pro-
vided more suitable quarters for its soo'dogs. They still

remain jg slavery; howe\er. One can only hope that

Still, this was just one case, and students of labora-
tory techniques took it in stride. Alter all, this was only
a matter of goo dogs, whereas in other laboratories thou-

and their pups are tiamplcd. The stench of aCcumu-

bottom one. Cleaning is not too much of a problem:

All this shouldnt be news, although it probably is.

The shocking facts were published in book form by the

, HSUS. Disturbed by rumors of laboratory conditions

and thwarted in all attempts to hold open investigations,

i the society hatched a long- range plan that was designed

to circumvent all obstacles and reveal the whole truth.

Viewed as a plot, the plan was a masterpiece of spy ﬁc-

tion. A small army of special investigators was hired and

then trained in basic lab01atory techniques. Thus quali-.

ﬁed, the investigators fanned out and found employment

in the nations oleading laboratories. The daily, on— —the-

study is not in sight. This project has been going on for
thirteen years, and the sutlering of animals is important
to it. Among the groups that would like to have a Clear
idea of the intended goal is the National Catholic So-
ciety for Animal welfare, which has been wondering
about the NIH itself for more than thirteen years:‘
“Much of the Nll'l-supported experimentation is a du-
plication or repetition of work already performed or in
progress. Researchers are. under no compulsion . . .p to
determine whether experiments they are performing have
already been performed, often repeatedly. This means
that they may inllict the same stitiering on animals that
other researchers haye already inflicted, often repeti-
ti‘ously.” Oln'iously, the Nlll has never l'clt wmpclled to
(loul)lt‘cltcti\, either. it can he presumed that the NII’I
has never heard of the Science Information Exchange, 3
ﬁne clearinghouse for such matters.

”The end justifies the means" is the theme song of
the lal')oratories, and it may have been composed in the
halls of the tax—wealthy NIH. Nobody is arguing.

But of course new experiments are also being per-
formed, and these days the big emphasis is on the fields
of drugs and chemicals. As the new drug and chemical
formulas come along, they fall into the custody of the
Food and Drug Administration. The new drug that
doesn’t meet the FDA standards of safety does not reach
the marketplace. Animals are used for the testing, but
here also the use of animals is often senseless, for their
reactions prove nothing of value to man. ’ i '

Asthe American Medical AssociatiOn put it at a
congressional hearing:

Drug activitV in animals is no assurance of similar
activitV in humans, and for some human disorders
there are. no similar disorders in animals. Frequently,
animal studies prove little or nothing and are very diﬁio
cult to correlate to humans. In some instances, expen-
sive animal studies are not indicated because there is
no likelihood of their providing worthwhile, realistic
evidence to the sponsor and clinical investigators. In
most instances, the proper formula, dosage form and
dosage leVel can only be determined by clinical trials
on human beings.

And as. a drug—company executive said: "Animal studies
are done for legal reasons and not for scientific reasons.

to recognize the fact that living animals are not reliable
subjects forthe testing of drugs. Thanks to the develop-
ment of. high poneret‘l 11111111111111» and m knowledge.
such insentient materials as ttssue cultures and cells are
superior in terms of economV eliiciech and results And
now we ltnOVV that in the maioritV of experiments uti-
lizmg Vertebrates, 111Verteb1ates can be substituted and
achieve the same results.

Drug companies, scientists, doctors, humanitarians,
.‘:_taxpayers, and millions of animals, of course, would love
- to welcome the FDA into modern times. But the De—
partment shows no sign of changing its Vvavs nor has it
displaVed interest in reﬁning its methods reducing the
number of animals used in pursuit of dubious results,
or eV en cutting dOVVn on some of the needless, repetitive
suffering.

Ordeal of the Animals 33

lives is something else.

How did we ever get this way?

Dear Mrs. Stevens,

In reply to my query Miss Carr at Prentice Hall

writes: "You may tniix assure Mrs Stevens that those points whi ch

Morse concluded were valid have been amended in the Ms"

I
commissioned the book, and I have to assume that,in the absense of

definite information to the contrary,

I must alow him to use his own

judgment. I simply cannot say

that large general qnx criticisms have

been made and that on the basis of them I most insist upon

cancelling
the book.

I am sorry and I have/of course

you personally and your organization but I don't see what other action

I can take in fairness to the author or the publisher.

Best Wish: 9

Danger: Utopia Ahead

Would anyone want to live in an “ideal” society? Some irreverent thoughts on the question,
and a reminder that blind pursuit of perfection may carry its own curse.

By JOSEPH wool) KRUTCH

every graduate student of Eng-

lish) knows that/Samuel Johnson
added the following four lines at the end
of Goldsmith’s The Traveller:

EVERY schoolboy (well, lets say

How small of all that human hearts
endure,

That part which laws or kings can
cause or cure!

Still to ourselves in every place con-
signed,

Our own felicity we make or ﬁnd.

Victims of Hitler or Stalin, or even
anyone who has ever heard of these vic—
tims, may ﬁnd it hard to believe that
Johnson’s contemporaries could accept
his pronouncement as a tenable thesis.
It is as clear today as it was at any other
unhappy time in the world’s history that
kings and laws can cause a good deal of
“all that human hearts endin'e.”

If Johnson could write the lines and
readers could admire them, that proves,
among other things, that the English—
men of his day had far less reason than
we to know just how much unnecessary
human misery kings and laws can cause.
No government of which they had any
intimate knowledge had ever been as
bad as a dozen governments have been
in the course of the twentieth century.
In that respect the world has become
for a great many people a much worse
place to live in than it was in Johnson’s
time.

What he said was a half-truth, and
since it seems that we can never believe
more than one—half of a truth at a time,
today the assumption, almost every-
where tacit and often explicit, is that
all, or almost all, that human hearts en-
dure is somehow traceable to laws,
rules, or—to use the most conveniently
vague and inclusive term—society, or
better yet, “the system.”

SR] August 20, 1966

It may be that extreme situations
created by bad laws and bad rulers are
tending to develop more and more fre-
quently in more and more parts of the
earth. But it is still true that in the
United States we make or ﬁnd most of
our own felicity. Despite the Depres-
sion and despite our laws, most of this
generation (with the exception, of
course, of combat soldiers) has owed
its most intense moments of happiness
and its deepest moments of sorrow to
causes that had little to do with the per-
sonalities or policies of our government.
We may have fretted over them. We
may, in other words, have borrowed
trouble. But borrowing trouble cer-
tainly comes under the head of in-
felicities we make or ﬁnd.

A CHEEBFUL view of our private
situation, of man’s destiny, and of the
universe he lives in is certainly one of
the things—perhaps the most important
single thing—that makes for happiness
or its opposite. But such a cheerful
view does not always depend upon any
of the things that society increasingly
(and I think properly) tries to provide
us with. In the Middle Ages, when life
was hard, and suffering was the common
lot, it was generally agreed that GOd is
good. The more secure and comfortable
we became—until recently, that is—the
more this conviction faded away. We
are now assured that God obviously
doesn’t exist and the universe is mean-
ingless.

We plan to abolish poverty, and of
that determination I approve. But I
remember nevertheless that the suicide
rate is higher among the rich than among
either the poor or the moderately well
off; that it is, according to the California
statistics, almost unknown among the
destitute. I do not conclude that we
should undertake to reduce the suicide
rate by increasing the number of the
destitute. Kings and laws can indeed

have a good deal to do with creating the
conditions under which it would seem
reasonable to suppose that people would
be happy. But kings and laws cannot
actually make them so, and it is my con-
viction that in today’s society, where
affluence touches a majority of Ameri-
cans, economic inequality is respon-
sible for far less unhappiness than are
the weaknesses and follies of many of
those who share its beneﬁts—such as
keeping up with the neighbors, spending
beyond income for superﬁcialities, and
false values of various sorts.

Irving Howe, one of the most often
quoted commentators on the contem-
porary social and political scene, is fond
of. insisting that our thinking is not suf—
ﬁciently utopian. The preceding para-
graphs may have helped to explain
some of the reasons why my opinion is
precisely the contrary. Utopian thinking
assumes that perfect justice can be
achieved, and that man not only can
be almost perfectly happy but also that
he can be made so—whereas nothing
in human experience justiﬁes any such
an assumption. To make it leads simply
to frustration because so much is ex—
pected of every improvement or reform
that even the beneﬁts that result seem
to amount to no more than a failure. An—
other statement made by Samuel John-
son comes nearer unqualiﬁed truth than
his addition to The Traveller. It is: “The
remedy for the ills of life is palliative
rather than radical.” And to “of life” he
might have added “or government.”

To the utopian, of course, any such
conviction means too ready an accept—
ance of the status quo. But that it should
do so is no more necessary or inevitable
than is the frequent tendency of utopian-
ism to end in an exasperated recourse to
a dictatorship that proposes to drag
people into felicity by the scruff of the
neck.

No system of government, no matter
how utopian the thinking that plans it,

17

 




ever achieves more than amelioration.
In the eighteenth century, the propo-

nents of democracy were sure that it-

would abolish war because only kings
wanted war. A generation or so ago one
of the commonest arguments in favor
of Communism was that it, in turn,
would bring the reign of peace that
democracy had failed to establish. “The
capitalists” were the creators of war, and
the reply that individual Communist
states might war with one another even
if all the world were Communist was
brushed aside until the rise of Chinese
Communism. Socialism still promises to
destroy the power of money, but all it
could really accomplish would be what
Russian Communism did accomplish—
the substitution of the power of political
position for the power of wealth. Power
of one sort or another vested in a few
individuals persists.

The ﬁrst completely developed out-
line for a utopia known from Western
Europe is Plato’s Republic. And it is, of
course, totalitarian, because even the
least cynical realized that nothing short
of compulsion could ever make men be-
have with complete rationality.

The law of compensation works both
ways, and the blessings, even when very
real, always turn out to be mixed. To
give women the vote was an act of
simple justice. No doubt it had one good
result: It removed one source of female
resentment—though I am not sure that
women did not immediately discover
another to make up for it. But the claim
that politics would be puriﬁed, and
wiser, more generous, and more com-
passionate laws passed was based upon
the false assumption that women voters
as a whole would be as earnest, as so-
cially conscious, and politically enlight-
ened as the feminist leaders. But—as the
feminists themselves used often to pro-
claim most unguardedly—“women are
people,” and female people are so much

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like male people that it would be difﬁ-
cult to demonstrate that there has ever
been any major decision made through
the ballot box in which the results de-
pended upon the women’s vote.

When women’s rights had just re-,

cently been achieved in England, G. K.
Chesterton described their triumphant
struggle in these words: “A million
women rose up to say ‘we will not be
dictated to.’ Whereupon most of them
became stenographers.” That is so glori-
ously funny that in laughter one is likely
to overlook its core of typical truth.
When women became free they not only
became free to earn a living, but,
far more often they were expected to
do so.

THE society now established in Eng-
land was certainly the product of uto-
pian thinking. It assumed that to abol-
ish all special privileges and to guarantee
equality of opportunity would create an
ideal situation. But before that ideal is
quite achieved it is declared to be far
short of utopia by a new wave of utopian
thinkers. In a book called Culture and
Society, Raymond Williams, who is said
to speak for a growing segment of uto-
pian opinion, has declared: “A stratiﬁed
society based on merit is as objection-
able . . . as a stratiﬁed society based
on money or birth.” Apparently the only
real utopia would be one in which
every citizen, no matter how stupid,
improvident, or even vicious, enjoyed
precisely the same privileges and advan-
tages as the most intelligent and the
most virtuous. Any reward for merit im-
plies something far short of utopia.

It was only a few centuries ago that
men began to think of the Golden Age
as a day about to dawn instead of an
irrecoverable paradise lost long ago. As
a part of that shift, utopia came to mean
not “that which exists nowhere” but
“that which will exist tomorrow.” N ever-

, A

theless, the determination to settle for
nothing less than perfection has been at
least as often a curse as it has been a
blessing. .Without utopian thinking
neither Nazi Germany nor Communism
would ever have come into existence.
Russia and Nazi Germany are the only
two modern nations in which a govern-
ment had the absolute power to decree
whatever was necessary to realize an
abstractly formulated ideal, and the sim-
ilarity between the two is real and
signiﬁcant, however strongly you may
believe that one ideal is noble and the
other depraved. Both turned into night-
mares for the very reason that anti-
utopians had predicted.

Some thirty years ago I wrote a book
called Was Europe a Success? that pro-
tested against the then-growing tend-
ency of liberals to surrender all their
previous convictions in exchange for the
utopian promise Communism held out.
Lord Russell replied: “I do not disagree
with Mr. Krutch as to what I like and
dislike. [But] we must not judge the
society of the future by considering
whether or not we should like to live in
it; the question is whether those who
have grown up in it will be happier than
those who have grown up in our society
or those of the past.”

' The speciﬁc question to which Lord
Russell refers seems to me to have re-
ceived a deﬁnite answer in the fact that
few of those who grew up in our society
would change it for the Russian, where-
as so many would like to move from,
say, East Germany to West Germany.

BUT that is not the most important
comment to be made on Lord Russell’s
pronouncement. Perhaps the rule, “Do
unto others as you would be done by,”
is not always applicable. As Bernard
Shaw’s revolutionist said: “Don’t do unto
others as you would they should do unto
you. Their taste may be different.” But
as a general rule, the scriptural advice
is safer. You are more likely to please
people by giving them what you would
like to have than by giving them what
you think they can be made to like.
The political reasons why utopian
thinking, even when it does not lead
to a dictatorship, never achieves more
than a questionable amelioration are all
familiar truths. Though it may be ob—
vious that the best and wisest men
should rule, no one has ever proposed
a workable method by which they may
be chosen. The oldest—hereditary power
—is based upon so obvious a fallacy that
it has been abandoned in nearly every
part of the Western world. Democracy
was the panacea proposed by the
eighteenth century, and though it seems
to be pragmatically justiﬁed by working
tolerably well—or at least better than
the assumption that the descendants of

seum grounds. A Louisiana Club now
has 5,000 members who are invited for
cultural soirées and come free to the
exhibitions.

A convenient luncheon stop, as every-
one in Denmark and Sweden seems to
know, is the enormous caravansary
called Marienlyst, a combination res-
taurant, casino, and inn. It reposes in
Helsingor at the edge of a private lake,
and one side of the house looks out on
its own beach, the narrowing waters of
the Qresund, and Swedish Halsingborg
on the far shore. Although the play there
is relatively mild, Marienlyst does have
the only gaming parlor in Denmark, a
circumstance which especially attracts
the Swedes from the yonder side of the
channel.

Marienlyst is said to be the longest
restaurant in Europe, and while that
may not be any indication of its epi-
curean accomplishments, it does make
possible on Sundays a mammoth smor-
gasbord that sags under the herrings, the
caviar, the lobster, the cold meats,
and cheeses. The so-called Danish table,
which produces the rotund Danish
stomach, also includes smoked eel, fresh
smoked salmon, cold ﬁsh with mayon-
naise, roast pork with prunes, Danish
sausage, and curry salad—to mention
merely a smattering of the temptations.
For dessert, since, Hamlet’s Castle is
merely down the road, one may choose
between Coupe Ophelia (orange ice
cream with tangerines and candied vio-
lets) or Kronborg Castle (tangerines
with cream, greengages, and candied
violets).

From here on the excursion lies along
the route of royal castles and palaces,
Kronborg, Fredensborg, and Frederiks-
borg, storybook relics every one. There
is little about Kronborg to suggest Ham-
let and the story of the Melancholy
Dane. Shakespeare adapted it from the
legend of Amled, a Danish folk tale
which is often performed in outdoor
summer pageantry in Denmark. Kron-
borg castle commands the headland
at the entrance of the Qresund. A ﬂag
ﬂies from the very point of land, and a
Danish soldier with gun and binoculars
stands on duty, doubtless counting the
incoming Swedish tourists. Hamlet has
been performed here with Sir Laurence
Olivier in the company, and there is a
tablet to Shakespeare pinned to the
castle walls. Beyond that, the visitor can
do little more than wander through the
royal apartments, all of them clean but
rather barren of furniture. Tapes-
tries hang from the walls, many ceilings
are painted, and a few carved wardrobe
chests date from 1647. Among the faces
that look down from the walls are
Charles I of England, whose mother was
Danish, Charles’s grandfather, King
Frederick 11, who built the castle in the

SR] August 20, 1966

sixteenth century, and a portrait of a
Spanish queen by Velasquez.

There are tours of the dungeons for
spelunkers who wish to crawl along dark
musty corridors and hear folk stories,
and there is also a maritime museum
full of ship models and charts. Should
the visit inspire a voyage, the ferries
dock alongside the castle for the three-
mile crossing into Sweden.

Coming home, we veered away from
the Danish Riviera and took the inland
royal road back to Copenhagen. We
paused for a look first at Fredensborg
Castle, built by Frederick IV in 1723
after the Danes and the Swedes had ef-
fected a peace among themselves. Here
Christian IX entertained the royal fami-
lies of Europe, most of whom were his
kin. His son George became king of
Greece, his daughter Alexandra married
Edward VII of England, and his daugh-
ter Dagmar became, as Mari-e Feoder-
ovna, Wife of the royal Russian heir who
became Czar Alexander III. A third
daughter married the Duke of Cumber-
land. One son turned down the throne
of Bulgaria because he might have be-
come involved in a war with his brother,
the King of Greece. Christian was
known as “the father-in-law of Europe,”
and when he died, his son Frederick be-
came King of Denmark. ‘

end at the palace might put up across

the street at the Hotel Frederik IV-and-
the-Great-Inn. It has about thirty rooms,
all with bath and telephone, amuses its
patrons with skittles, tennis and billiards,
is almost always packed, and is precisely
1,200 yards from the edge of Esrum
Lake, where the king comes to fish and
lesser citizens dally away the summer
days in log houses with grassy roofs.

AT the risk of contracting fortress
fever and jaded eyeballs, we stopped
briefly at Frederiksborg, a Renaissance
castle that looks like the very one in
which all Prince Charmings live. It was
ruined by a ﬁre in 1859, but Carl Jacob-
sen, the brewer of Carlsberg beer, had
in his travels paid a visit to Versailles
and was greatly impress-ed by the im-
pact of history and heritage upon the
people of a nation. He donated the funds
to restore Frederiksborg, and it has be-
come now a national museum, with
paintings, furniture, and memorabilia of
the past ages. A carillon in the tower,
donated by his estate, plays hymns in
the summer. Jacobsen also donated the
marvelous Neptune Feuntain in the outer
courtyard. The original was liberated by
the Swedes in 1659 and is still on view
in Drottningholm.

On the way back to Copenhagen we
stopped for tea at the tiny crossroads inn.
called the S¢ller¢d Kro, which has been
awarding refreshment to wayfarers since

1677. The sun was still bright, and we
sat outside on the terrace, and had tea,
listening to the twittering of the birds as
they bustled about the straw bird houses
in the gardens. The rooms inside were
rich with paintings. Candles ﬂickered in
pewter holders alongside the tulips.

THE menu I looked at talked of ﬁlet
mignon of pork in creamed paprika
sauce with tomatos, bacon and mush-
rooms. It spoke beguilingly of roast duck
with red cabbage, prunes, and apples,
of Franz Lehar Chicken, and scrambled
eggs with bird’s liver In an ancient
back room the stewards were dressing
a beautiful wedding table with a forest
of stem glasses and bouquets of ﬂowers.
. It was Sunday afternoon, and the music
from somewhere was spilling out old
Gershwin. I was moved to take out pa-
pers and not budge for, say, six months,
and if we hadn’t an appointment at Belle
‘ Terrasse in Tivoli Gardens that night,
and were I not a responsible party, you
would ﬁnd me still a resident wino at
the S¢ller¢d Kro. —-HOBACE SUTTON.

Utopia

 

Continued from page 18

great men will be equally great—no one
has ever answered the embarrassing
question: “How can the less wise be
expected to recognize the superiority of
the superior?”

In those countries which are supposed
by many to be now pointing the way to
the future, both hereditary and elected
leadership have been discarded in favor
of what is the most primitive of all
methods of choosing rulers-a struggle
for power in the course of which the
public waits to see who will come out
on top. That came to be the method by
which the Roman emperors were chosen,
and it is certainly that which put a
Stalin, a Khrushchev, and his nearly
anonymous successors, at the head of
what is either the ﬁrst or the second-
greatest power in the world today.

BUT the deepest reasons for the in-
evitable failure of utopian thinking lie
not only in man’s political incapacity
but in general human nature. And that
is perhaps the reason why the most
modern of utopias, the one imagined by

' some students of the behavioral sci-

ences, proposes like Professor B. F.
Skinner, to begin by dehumanizing those

, who are to be conditioned into perfect
, virtue and perfect happiness

That man cannot conceive of anx—

E thing that would make him perfectly
,» happy and perfectly content is proved
by the fact that his imagination has in-
vented a variety of bells, all of them full
i of horror, but never a paradise in which
he would want to dwell for eternity, or
even for very long. The best that any
thoughtful man is likely to say of any of
the seriously intended pictures of a per-
? fect state from Plato through Sir Thomas
: More and down to Samuel Butler s
Erewon or Shaw’s Future as Far as the

 

Eye Can Beach is only: ‘iIt would be an
interesting place to visit but I wouldn’t
want to live there.”

Only the naive are able to imagine
a utopia which they themselves could
accept. In the United States one of the
best sellers of the 18603 was Gates Afar,
by Elizabeth Stuart Phelps. In it is de-
scribed a future life different from that
of the upper-middle—class families of her
day in nothing except the absence of
certain difficulties and frustration. The
blessed gossip with neighbors and look
after the children, who have a very
human tendency to seek out a celestial
cookie jar. Her public, which certainly
would not have found Dante's Paradise
very attractive, was so delighted to he
promised a future life that would be only
more of the same that she wrote three
sequels.

Are there few today who are so naive?
Not, perhaps, in quite the same way,
but there are many more highly placed
than Miss Phelps’s readers who are
equally uncritical. I doubt that the most
popular kind of utopian. thinking current
today is actually much superior to Miss
Phelps’s. I”; is obvious that most people
really believe they would be much hap-
pier than now if they could enjoy that
better world which differs from ours
in nothing more than a still more corn-
plicated technology, and is described
daily by one prophet or another. Henry
Kaiser put it into these words:

“Atomic power will be harnessed . . .
unlimited foods and raw materials will
be synthesized . automation will
create new opportunities and more jobs

. there will be developed a still more
dazzling array of new products, new
uses of metals, new breakthroughs in
chemistry . . . medical science at last
will conquer cancer, heart disease, and
maladies of the mind and emotions, and
old age. . . . The opportunities ahead of
us are limitless. . . . \Vhy, we haven’t
seen anything yet.”

’ #1413 - 0N TORTURING ANIMALS

Reprinted from Morris Plan’s ”Keys to Success"

One of my favorite people is Joseph Wood Krutch.
I like the things he's written and the way his mind
works. In one of his essays for the Saturday Review,
he has something important to say about cruelty to
animals.

He begins by quoting the artist, Salvador Dali who
wrote in his modestly titled book, "Diary of a Genius, "
-- "I very much like to torture animals." He says that
one of his deepest regrets is that he has never had the
pleasure of watching a lion die of starvation.

Krutch writes that lions are expensive luxuries, but '
rats and other small animals come cheap and a modest
equivalent of the experience denied Dali is enjoyed
by many adolescents in high schools that buy, from one
of the largest biological supply houses, complete star-
vation kits that include various deficient diets and thus
provide for a refinement which only modern science
has made possible. The victims eat but they die even
more slowly than if they were entirely deprived of food.
Thus the pleasure of watching them is prolonged and
it may be justified on the ground that it is "educa—
tional. "

A century ago Charles Darwin told a Royal Com-
mission that experiments involving cruelty to animals
were "damnable" unlesss they contribute important
knowledge unobtainable in any other way. And when
Thomas Henry Huxley heard of a vivisectionist who
said that he might give his victims an anesthetic to
keep them quiet but not to spare them pain, Huxley
wrote, "I would willingly agree to any law which
would send him to the treadmill. "

Certainly high school students have no need to prove
for themselves that dietary deficiencies can be fatal
and they learn nothing but hardness of heart from either
these experiments or from some of the others now pop-
ular -- such as, for instance, the inoculation of ro-
dents or chicks with cancer. In their literature class
they probably read "The Ancient Mariner, " in which
appears:

He prayeth best who loveth best
All things both great and small.

But at least one teacher is reported to have brushed
criticism aside by explaining that students were sternly
forbidden to regard their victims as pets or to take any
interest in them as individuals. Another teacher, when
asked why it was necessary to perform actual experi-
ments when published accounts and photographs were
available, replied that "using live animals fascinates
the youngsters. " He added that it wouldn't do to stop
the experiment before death ensued because death made
it "more dramatic " and "the children are not convinced
unless the critters die. "

There are, of course, laws against cruelty to animals,
but I have never heard of a case where they were in-
voked to prevent any torture that claimed to have a
scientific purpose. In fact, many, though not all,
laboratory physiologists have bitterly opposed all the
various bills introduced (chiefly, so far, without suc-
cess) that would set up standards governing the treat-
ment of laboratory animals, as there are in England.

In the Middle Ages any cruelty was justified if it
could be said to be in the defense of true religion;
much the same is true today if science is substituted.

Q O .

We like to tell ourselves that civilization has made
us more humane. We need experimentation. But we
need, also, to teach our youngsters to . . . . "loveth
best / All things both great and small. "

WHAT DOES VIOLENCE
SAY ABOUT MAN?

animals.” So writes Salvador Dali

in his modest Diary of a Genius.
One. of his deepest regrets is, so he
goes on to say, that he has never had
the pleasure of watching a lion die of
starvation.

Now lions are expensive luxuries but
rats and other small animals come cheap
and a modest equivalent of the experi-
ence denied Dali is enjoyed by many
adolescents in high schools that buy
from one of the largest biological supply
houses complete starvation kits that in—
clude various deﬁcient diets and thus
provide for a reﬁnement which only
modern science has made possible: The
victims eat but they die” even more
slowly than if they were entirely de—
prived of food. Thus the pleasure of
watching them is prolonged and it may
be justiﬁed on the ground that it is
“educational.”

A century ago Charles Darwin told
a Royal Commission that "experiments
involving cruelty to animals were
“danmable” unless they contribute im-
portant knowledge unobtainable in any
other way. And when Thomas Henry
Huxley heard of a vivisectionist who
said that he might give his victims an
anesthetic to keep them quiet but not
to spare them pain, Huxley wrote, “I
would willingly agree to any law which
would send him to the treadmill.” Cer-
tainly high school students have no need
to prove for themselves that dietary
deﬁciencies can be fatal and they learn
nothing but hardness of heart from
either these experiments or from some
of the others now popular—such as, for
instance, the inoculation of rodents or
chicks with cancer. In their literature
class they probably read “The Ancient
Mariner” and are asked to comment
upon:

6‘1 VERY MUCH LIKE to torture

bidden anyhow. and at least one teacher

aside by explaining that students were
sternly forbidden to regard their victims
as pets or to take any interest in them
as individuals. Another teacher, when
asked why it was necessary to perform
actual experiments when published ac-
counts and photographs were available,
replied that “using live animals fasci—
nates the youngsters.” He added that it
wouldn’t do to stop the experiment be-
fore death ensued because death made
it “more dramatic” and “the children
are not convinced unless the critters

die.”

THERE are, of course, laws against
cruelty to animals, but I have never
heard of a case where they were invoked
to prevent any torture that claimed to
have a scientiﬁc purpose. In fact, many,
though not all, laboratory physiologists
have bitterly opposed alllthe various
bills introduced (chieﬂy, so far, without
success) that would set up standards
governing the treatment of laboratory
animals—Senate Bill $1071, for instance.
But does anyone dare say that no labo-
ratory worker could possibly have a
touch of sadism in him or even that
routine familiarity with torture might
make him callous? The very fact that
laboratory experiments are conducted
behind closed doors makes it all the
more desirable that some sort of control
or inspection be provided for. In Eng—
land, where all possibly painful experi-
ments must be licensed by the Home
Ofﬁce, eighty-eight biological fellows of
the Royal Society answered a question-
n aire in which they were asked whether
or not they opposed these existing con-

trols, whether they believed they pre-
vented the highest level of medical
research, and whether they found in
their own experience that control seri-
ously frustrated legitimate results. Of the
eighty-eight, only one replied “Yes” to
any of the three questions; the rest gave
a “No” to all three. Among comments
from eminent persons were:

Sir Francis Walshe, F.R.S.: “A wide
familiarity with the literature of experi-
mental neuro—physiology leads me to
think that in other countries where no
such rational mode of control is used,
quite a few futile and unnecessarily
painful animal experiments are carried
out by persons not always qualiﬁed to
do them.”

Professor A. T. Phillipson, deputy di-
rector of the Rowett Research Institute:
“I am glad to hear the Americans are
trying to introduce a bill similar to our
Ofﬁce Act.”

Professor A. Habbow, F.R.S., direc-
tor of the Chester Betty Cancer Research
Institute: “I have, of course, been most
interested to learn of the American bill
and sorry to hear of opposition to it.”

Nobel Prize-winner Professor H. A.
Krebs: “I am very glad indeed to sup-
port a movement to introduce in the
United States legislation similar to that
operating in Great Britain. My answer
to all three questions which you formu—
lated at the end of your letter is a simple
‘No.’ ” '

ONE similar bill was recently intro-
duced in one of the American state legis-
latures, whereupon an amendment was
offered speciﬁcally exempting high
school laboratories from any supervision
or restriction. In the Middle Ages any
cruelty was justiﬁed if it could be said
to be in the defense of true religion;
much the same is true today if science
is substituted. But one does not have to
oppose all vivisection to ask that the
experimenter should be required to
show, not merely that he 'could learn
something from some horrible cruelty,
but that What he could learn is impor-
tant enough to be alleged as an excuse.
I wonder, for instance, about the experi-
ment recently reported to determine
how much ﬁre dogs could breathe with—
out dying. The experimenter said that
the Army “wanted to know.” Why it
wanted to know was not explained, but
perhaps it was in order to make sure
that its flame throwers were sufﬁciently
lethal.

We like to tell ourselves that civiliza—
tion has made us more humane. Our
newspapers no longer carry advertise-
ments like the following from a British
periodical in 1730: “A mad bull, dressed
up with ﬁreworks, is to be turned loose
. . . likewise a dog dressed up with ﬁre-
works; also a bear to be turned loose.
N.B.—A cat is to be tied to the bull’s

CLASSICS REVISITED—ll

 

The Iliad

By KENNETH REXROTH

HE BEST-QUALIFIED CRITICS

I have always agreed that the ﬁrst

work of Western European litera-
ture has remained incomparably the
greatest. In itself this is a revelation of
the nature of the human mind and of
the role of works of art. This is a pop-
ular judgment as well as a critical one.
Today, over 2,500 years old, Homer
competes successfully with current
best-sellers, detective stories, and the
most sensational and topical nonfiction.

Modern Americans may be the heirs of
Western civilization, but all the ele-
ments of that civilization have changed
drastically since Homer’s day. The
ofﬁce worker who reads Homer on the
subway bears little superﬁcial resem-
blance either to Homer’s characters or
to his audience. Why should two long
poems about the life of barbaric Greece
have so great an appeal?

It was the fashion in the nineteenth
century to deny the existence of Homer
and to break up the Odyssey and Iliad
into collections of folk ballads. Nothing
disproves those theories more than this
public reception. The Iliad and the Odys—
sey have been read by such a vast di-
versity of men because, as unitary works
of art, they deal with universal experi-
ence with unsurpassed depth, breadth,
and intensity. Each poem shows the
powerful insight and organization that
comes from the artistic craft of a com-
plete person.

Men have argued about the Iliad for
so long and raised so many side issues
that it is easy for a critic to forget that
it is formally a tragedy, saturated with
a tragic sense of life and constructed
with the inevitability of the tragedies
of Orestes or Macbeth. It is a double
tragedy—of Achilles and the Greeks,
and of Hector and the Trojans, each
reinforcing the other. To modern taste,
the heroes are not the Greeks, who are
portrayed as quarreling members of a
warrior band, but the Trojans, men of
family united in the community of the
city-state.

Homer, like most later writers of
epic—Teutonic, Irish, or Icelandic-
portrays heroic valor as fundamentally
destructive, not just of social order but
of humane community. The Greeks are
doomed by their characteristic virtues.
Achilles sulks in his tent. Agamemnon
has stolen his girl. The Creek camp is
beset with a disorder that wastes all

SR] March 27, 1965

good things. Underlying disorder is vi~
olence. Violence is not approved of in
itself by the Greeks, but all the values
they most admire—the nobility, pride
and power, glamour and strength of bar-
baric Chieftains—ﬂourish only in the
context of violence and must be fed by
it continuously. Failure of these values
provokes shame, the opposite of the as-
sumption of responsibility, and shame
provokes disaster.

On the other side of the wall the
Trojans go their orderly and digniﬁed
ways. None of them approves of the
crime of Paris but he is a member of the
family of the King of Troy and the citi-
zens of Troy are members one of an-
other. So they assume his guilt in an act
of collective responsibility. When the
Greeks arrived before the walls of Troy,
the Trojans could have thrown Paris and
Helen out of the city. The invaders
would have gone their way. When the
Iliad opens, the Greeks have been ﬁght—
ing for ten years and are worn out with
the moral attrition of war, while the
Trojans have grown ever closer together
in the consciousness of doom. “Our lot is
best, to ﬁght for our country,” says Hec-
tor, and Homer implies a contrast with
the Greeks who are ﬁghting for them-
selves, each for his own valor and pride.

Greeks and Trojans are not the only
protagonists of this tragedy. There is
another community—the gods of Olym-
pus. In the vast literature of Homeric
criticism, I have never read a mention of
what kind of community this was, of
where in Homer’s day he could have
found an earthly parallel to such a group
of people. The court of Zeus is pre-
cisely a court, like those to be found in
the great empires of the ancient Near
East, in Egypt, Babylon, or Persia. After
Homer, for a few hundred years, Greek
society strove to rise above the tyrant
and the court of the tyrant. The Greeks
of the classical period looked on the
rulers of Persia or Egypt and their pro-
vincial imitators in the Creek world as
at once frivolous and dangerous, be-
cause, in Greek opinion, they were mo-
tivated not by the moral consensus of

v

a responsible community but by the
whims of what today we would call a
collection of celebrities.

Homer contrasts the societies of the
Greeks, the Trojans, and the Olympian
gods as the three forms of political asso-
ciation that prevailed in the Heroic Age
(a time that in fact, 400 years before,
must have seemed almost as remote to
him as his age does to us), namely
the barbaric war band, the ancient, pre-
Creek city-state, and the imperial court.
He also contrasts men and gods as two dis-
parate orders of being. The gods may be-
have like painted and perfumed cour-
tiers of the Persian King of Kings, but
they function also as conceptual forms
of the forces of nature and of the forces
that operate within the human person-
ality on nonhuman levels. In this role,
too, the tragedy of the Iliad reveals
them as frivolous, dangerous, and un-
predictable.

True, Homer speaks worshipfully at
times of the gods, and especially of
Zeus, but in terms of standardized ﬂat-
tery, empty of moral content. For
Homer, utterly unlike the Jew or Mos-
lem or Christian, the supernatural is de-
void of value altogether. Value arises
only in the relations of men. He con-
trasts two different systems of relation-
ships, the epic chivalry of the Heroic
Age war band of the Greeks, and the
Trojan community of mutual respect
and responsibility. The conflicts and
resolutions and tragedies that beset the
interactions of these human beings are
all the good and evil there is in the Iliad.
The gods contribute only chance, fate,
doom, as amoral as so many roulette
wheels.

Homer has been read for almost 3,000
years, and is read today by millions, be-
cause he portrayed men in the night-
bound world of insensate circumstance
as being each man to his fellow the
only light there is, and all men to each
other as the source of the only principle
of order. This, says Homer, is the hu-
man condition. Out of it in the Iliad
he constructed a dramatic architecture
of a cogency never to be surpassed.

Each time I put down the Iliad, after
reading it again in some new translation,
or after reading once more the somber
splendor of the Creek, I am convinced,
as one is convinced by the experiences
of a lifetime, that somehow, in a way
beyond the visions of artistry, I have
been face to face with the meaning of
existence. Other works of literature give
this insight, but none so powerfully, so
uncontaminated by evasion or subter-
fuge. If the art of poetry is a symbolic
criticism of value, the Iliad is the para-
mount classic of that art. Its purity, sim-
plicity, deﬁnition, and impact reveal life
and expose it to irrevocable judgment,
with ﬁnality, at the beginning of Euro-
pean literature.

tail.” Bear-baiting was officially prohib-
ited in England in 1835 and a few years
earlier the ﬁrst law making cruelty to
animals an offense per se was passed—
over, incidentally, vigorous opposition
in Parliament by those who called them—
selves anti-sentimentalists. Nevertheless,
it sometimes seems that Emerson’s Law
of Compensation really does work—both
ways. Perhaps there is less suffering in-
flicted upon animals that is frankly for
pleasure but there is probably much
more of it—quanti‘tatively, at least—in
the interest of scientific knowledge.

Killing for fun and death as a spec-
tacle are not, however, unknown today.
In Tucson, Arizona, the head of a
certain printing organization that op—
poses most of the present game laws
abandoned the usually mealy-mouthed,
gun-manufacturers’ explanation of the
wholesome effects of killing animals for
fun (i.e., outdoor exercise, contact with
nature, making fathers pals with their
sons, and so forth) for the statement
that children ought to make early con-
tact “with life and death.” And frank
though that was, it wasn’t quite com—
pletely so. What he meant was not
“familiarity with death” but “familiarity
with killing,” which is a rather different
thing. And there is surely some doubt
that there are not enough opportunities
today to become familiar with that. We
who have had the privilege of living in
the Century of Progress have, as a mat—
ter of fact, had more opportunities to
take killings of one sort or another for
granted than had either our fathers or
our grandfathers.

ERHAPS it is because there has been
so much killing in our time that there
seems to have been a reversal of the
once—evident trend away from ritual
‘ violence. Perhaps the fun killings staged
by some of the ve-terans’ organizations
that invite young folks to club rabbits
to death is only a survival of a concept
of sport widely prevalent down to the
nineteenth century. But there is no
doubt that bullfighting (once regarded
as decidedly un—American) has become
a smart diversion. Nor is its popularity
conﬁned to the Southwest, where the
corridas (a little Spanish adds a touch
of chic) staged just across the border
are not only regularly advertised in our
neWSpapers but often given critical re-
views. Hemingway’s blood lust no doubt
had something to do with the rise of the
fashion, but his celebration of the bull-
ﬁght as the most reﬁned expression of
the sadistic impulse met with widespread
response. '

A few years ago, during a Congres-
sional hearing, a witness introduced a
memo from an advertising manager to
the producer of a TV serial his company
was Sponsoring: “More violence and
more bosoms.” A great deal has been

SR/March 27, 1965

written in quite proper protest against
the violence that runs so consistently
not only through TV melodramas and
through the animated cartoons, but also
through even the Disney nature ﬁlms,
where ritual ﬁghts (often carefully
staged) play a large part. How much all
these things are creating a taste, how
much merely responding to it, would be
hard to know, but less has been written
about the increasing element of violence,
danger, and death in the so-called spec—
tator sports. American football (which a
recent English critic called “not violent
enough for a war, but too Violent for a
game”) is relatively mild by comparison
with air shows and auto races, though

even in football there are some Spec—

tators whose excitement is increased by
the fact that fatal injuries are at least a
very real possibility. And as far as the
air shows and races are concerned,
their danger is frankly stressed in the
advertisements.

THE most penetrating discussion I
have ever seen of the part played by the
ever-present threat of death at an auto
race occurs, oddly enough, in a Bantam
paperback called When, Engines Roar.
These “nineteen action-packed true sto—
ries capture all the daring and drama of
the greatest moments in auto racing his—
tory” and are obviously directed at
aﬁcionados. But the volume does never—
theless include an article “The Psychol-
ogy of Auto Racing,” by one Raymond
de Beker, which is reprinted from The
Annual Automobile Review.

Mr. de Beker cites a variety of appeals
that the spectacle of auto racing can and
does make: Speed is one of the more
spectacular achievements of technology
and all aSpects of technology fascinate
modern man; crowds, noise, and mass
hysteria offer an escape from the trou-
bled self, and so forth, and so forth. But
the principal conclusion that emerges
from the analysis is foreshadowed by the
opening sentence: “Motor races are just

as essential a part of modern life as glad-
iatorial combats were in ancient Rome.”

After disposing rather briefly of the
less obvious appeals, the author develops
fully an analysis of the most powerful
ones. “In no other sport . . . is the danger
of death so imminent. At Le Mans death
reaped eighteen victims in a matter of
seconds . . . and though the spectators
have every intention of running risks
only by proxy, it happens that fate pan-
ders over-zealously to a taste that con—
science scarcely dares to admit.” Hence
(as he might have added but didn’t)
it is all rather as though the Spectator at
the bullﬁght was occasionally tossed into
the arena or the Roman fan at the Coli-
seum found himself, though no Christian,
suddenly in the middle of the lions.
(Which would have served him right
enough.)

Mr. de Beker then concludes: “Man-
kind has reached a dangerous corner.
. . . [He] seeks to perceive what fate this
machine holds in store for him and to
experience vicariously the pains of death
and rebirth it involves. He wants to
know if he can become the superman
who deﬁes the laws of space, the mecha-
nized centaur he visualizes in the cham—
pion, and avoid the catastrophe which
alarms yet attracts him as flame does a
moth.”

When I began to write this piece the
moral I would have drawn from the
bull ring and the race course would have
been implied in the question just how
far the spectator at either is from the
Emperor Commodius, whom Suetonius
describes as leaning over the box to stare
intently into the face of the gladiator
dying a few feet away. Now, however, I
wonder if the auto race isn’t, unlike the
bullﬁght, something new rather than
merely a recrudescence. Perhaps its chief
signiﬁcance is what Mr. de Beker makes
it—as a ritual presentation of man face
to face with the machine which he half
hopes and half fears may put an end to
him at last.

Double Jeopardy: U.N. and Vietnam

a Showdown in the recent session
of the United Nations General As-
sembly against states that hadn’t met
their payments for the peace-keeping op-
erations of the U.N. The United States
argued that it was not for individual
nations to determine whether assess-
ments were unreasonable and improper.
They were obligated to support the U.N.
whether they liked it or not. France and
the Soviet Union didn’t like it. Desperate
attempts to ﬁnd a formula for averting
an ominous confrontation all failed.
The General Assembly adjourned in the
deepest gloom it has known since 1945.
It might be argued that the United
States didn’t take into account the fact
that a showdown could be far less dam-
” aging to the Soviet Union in particular
than to the United Nations in general.
AS against this was the need to gain
acceptance for the principle of compul-
sory Obligations in matters concerned
with keeping the peace. In the sense that
the development of a higher sovereignty
for preserving the peace is the largest
single challenge of the twentieth cen-
tury, a defense can be made for the
American position on assessments.

But the American argument for sup-
porting the authority of the United Na-
tions was negated only a few days later
by the United States itself when it
spurned the call by Secretary-General
U Thant for a conference looking toward
an effective resolution of the war crisis
in Vietnam. The principle we sought to
uphold against the Soviet Union and
France we set aside when our own in-

20

T HE UNITED STATES pressed for

terests were directly involved. Is it ar-
gued that the two cases are not similar?
That the ﬁrst case involved financial
obligations and the second a situation in
which the United States was already
committed to a ﬁxed course of action?
The underlying principle in both cases
has to do with the primacy of the U.N.
in dealing with threats to world peace.
The action in Suez and the Congo, which
produced the ﬁnancial crisis, was carried
out in the interests of world peace. The
action of the Secretary-General in calling
for a conference over Vietnam was ad-
vanced in the interests of world peace.
It is difficult to assert that the U.N. en-
joys supranational status in ﬁxing dues
for peace-keeping operations while
downgrading the role of the U.N. in
peace-keeping itself.

Perhaps it will be said that the U.N.
had no effective way of acting in Viet-
nam since not all parties to the dispute
were members of the U.N. But the point
at issue here is not whether the U.N.
could or could not have been effective in
mounting an armed action in Vietnam
similar to its action in Korea or Suez or
the Congo. What the U.N. tried to do
was to initiate negotiations in a situation
fast spiraling into a large-scale war. The
United States declined U Thant’s re-
quest with thanks. It was almost as
though we were sending regrets for our
inability to accept an invitation to a ball.

If France and the Soviet Union
seemed cavalier in their attitude toward
the United Nations, the attitude of the
United States verged on condescension.
One would suppose by this time that the

United Nations does not exist for the
purpose of making polite inquiries to
concerned parties in questions of war
and peace but for the hard and imper-
sonal pu1pose of keeping this planet
from atomic incineration.

Sooner or later the American pe0ple
are going to have to make up their mind
about what they want their government’s
position on the United Nations to be. So
far, our position on the U.N. has been to
give it full backing—up to the point
where it impinges on the basic thrust of
our foreign policy. Essentially, the U.N.
has not been primary in our foreign
policy. Primary elements include our
nuclear stockpiles, our bases, NATO,
SEATO, and our direct presence in var—
ious countries.

But if Vietnam has taught us anything,
it is that the old policy of alliances, stock-
piles, and bulging muscles is no longer
the prime or workable instrument it
was in the pre-atomic world of dis-
connected national units. NATO hasn’t
worked in Europe. SEATO hasn’t worked
in Indo-China. Raw force hasn’t worked
in Vietnam, either for France or the
United States. But our response to the
new facts of life is to put more of the
unworkables to work instead of making
a total commitment to the development
of a collective mechanism for creating
workable world law.

It is not solely geography that is inter-
connected in an atomic age. Actions are
interconnected. We are pursuing a policy
in Vietnam Without regard to the effects
on other elements bearing on our total
security. The Whole effort to keep the
Soviet Union and Communist China
from coming together in a vast military
coalition; the need to keep the nations
of Africa and Asia from veering toward
Communist China; the need to keep a
world organization competitive with the
U.N. from being formed with Peking at
the center; the need to create conditions
that will make possible increasing control
over the highly combustible nuclear
arms race—all these are interconnected;
all are affected adversely by the decision
to Spurn the good ofﬁces of the U.N. in
Vietnam.

Equally important but largely dis-
regarded is the connection between Sai-
gon and Selma. Until President Johnson
spoke before Congress last week, it was
becoming increasingly difﬁcult for Amer-
icans to explain to themselves or anyone
else the contrast represented by the reso-
lute policy of the United States in put-
ting down disorders in Vietnam while
observing zealous circumspection in Ala-
bama. The President did honor to him-
self and the nation in recognizing the
role of the US. in the Selmas of the
South. He will do equal honor to the
nation and the hopes for world peace in
recognizing the role of the U.N. in the
Vietnams of the world. —-N.C.

Ar_1_i_r_n_§_l§ in the Laboratory
I WOULD LIKE TO express lnywthanks to Jo-
seph Wood Krutch for his perceptive and
timely article “What Does Violence Say
About Man?” [SR, Mar. 27]. It is heartening
indeed that a writer of Mr. Krutch’s stature
should devote some of his talent to humane
ends.

It is quite horrifying to me that now, in
addition to the plight of laboratory animals
who are tortured in vain in repetitive and
frequently meaningless experiments, we are
confronted with the sickening spectacle of
experiments with live animals in biology
classes at the high school level. It should
surely be apparent to anyone who has any
psychological insight that such programs
could scarcely fail to brutalize the students
involved, and that callousness toward ani-
mals may lead all too easily to a similar
callousness toward human beings.

V. H. SPECTOR.

THE PREVALENT ATTITUDE toward the need-
less killing of animals is shocking. Sick
indeed is anyone who feels that a well-
rounded education must include observing
the agony of creatures being needlessly tor-
tured and killed. A greater respect for the
value of life might make this country a more
decent place to live.

It is a mockery to call ourselves a civi-
lized nation; we are barbarians and de-
serve the worst that can happen to us.

ADELE KONNEKER.

I WISH TO TAKE ISSUE with Joseph Wood
Krutch concerning his remarks about the
treatment of laboratory animals.

It would seem strange that the so-called
mistreatment of laboratory animals, which
for generations have been raised for the sole
purpose of experimentation, whose only
ecological niche is that provided by man,
and which are alive to serve no other func-
tion than that of experimental subjects,
should be questioned in the context Mr.
Krutch is using. It should be apparent that
as far as the over-all state in which the ani—
mals are kept is concerned, it is to the bene-
fit of the scientist and imperative for the
proper conducting of the experiment that
only those parameters with which the ex-
periment is concerned should vary; there-
fore it is usual that the animal is hygienically
maintained and properly nourished.

For the experimenter these animals exist
only as physio-chemical systems, and this
is how it must be if we are to objectively
fathom the essence of life—a sentimental
approach has never solved any of our prob-
lems. Callous, yes, but in the same sense
as the physician who must remain aloof
from a full awareness of what he must some-
times do for his patient, in order that he
may do it at all.

Respect for life is a noble quality, and
it is just this respect and the curiosity about
the working of nature which leads to ex-
perimentation. It is this very curiosity and
desire for knowledge (not sadism) which
sometimes results in the destruction of the

  

   
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 

“One of our dream-realization specialists will be with you in a moment.”

organism under study. This is unfortunate,
but necessary, for to stem this curiosity be-
cause of the death of certain animals is
absurd.

To attribute sadism to experimenters as
an attempted justiﬁcation of some outside
control is to do a great injustice to those
people who diligently strive to further hu-
man knowledge.

As for Mr. Krutch’s advocating control
over the use of experimental animals, one
can but wonder that the obvious pitfalls of
such an arrangement are not immediately
apparent. To allow a bureaucrat to make
value judgments of proposed experiments
would be disastrous. It is even difﬁcult for
the proponent of a certain experiment to
predict its possible worth in relation to over—
all accumulated knowledge. And who would
want to risk the vetoing of an experiment
that might have led to the cure for some
disease or resulted in a major breakthrough?

JOSEPH WOOD KRUTCH deserves a large
vote of appreciation from his readers. In
“What Does Violence Say About Man?” he
was a discouraged champion protesting the
perversion of our emotional involvement in
sadistic Violence. Fortunately, however, the
week this piece was published the real
news was not the sound and fury of vio-
lence but the enormous dignity of nonvio-
lence. I could scarcely hear what violence
had to say about man, because it was over—
come by the sound of marching feet and
singing voices on a highway in Alabama.
I hope Mr. Krutch will write about what
nonviolence has to say about man, and I
hope he will do it soon.

If our contemporary violence is “new
rather than merely a recrudescence,” it is
being countered by a nonviolence whose
scope and discipline are also new. On the

basis of historical precedent, we ought not
to underestimate that power which shall
Overcome.

Confusion in Kashmir

I HAVE COVERED the Kashmir question for
over two decades now and do not know of
another situation more fraught with pitfalls
for the well-meaning and good-intentioned.
It was therefore with great interest that I
read Arthur Bernon Tourtellot’s article
“Kashmir: Dilemma of a People Adrift”
[83, Mar. 6].

Permit me to say it is a regrettable and
mischievous piece of writing from one who
is described as a “historian” gathering ma-
terial “for a book on constitutionalism.”
The article shows ”no understanding either
of Kashmir’s—or India’s—recent history, or
of the constitutional position of Kashmir
Vis-a-vis India, or Of India’s long and little-
understood attempt at creating a secular
state.

That SR, with its excellent tradition of
impartiality and study in depth, should have
printed this article marks a sad departure
from its consistently high standards of re-
porting. Self—determination, unfortunately,
is not a cure-all and there is such a thing as
the greatest good for the greatest number.

WITH REFERENCE TO the article “Kashmir:
Dilemma of a People Adrift,” the situation
as presented by the distinguished historian
is true, just, and right. I have not seen any
American providing the true picture of that
disputed valley so well. I am happy that
the people in America still love the truth.

MAN, NATURE
AND THE UNIVERSE

By JOSEPH WOOD KRUTCH

From an essay in The American Scholar. Reprinted by permission.

ONE of the most striking aspects of the human condi-
tion is the simple fact that we share the earth with
a vast number and a vast variety of other living things.
We are enormously different in many respects from any
of them, but we are like them all in that they, too, are
that mysterious thing, “alive.”

Commenting on this fact, William Morton Wheeler,
the late distinguished taxonomist and student of insect
behavior, wrote:

“Why animals and plants are as they are we shall never
know; of how they came to be what they are, our knowl-
edge will always be extremely fragmentary; but that
organisms are as they are, that apart from members of
our own species they are our only companions in an
inﬁnite and unsympathetic waste of electrons, planets,
nebulae and stars, is a perennial joy and consolation.”

When I ﬁrst read this statement a number of years ago,
it struck a responsive chord and it must have had a simi-
lar effect upon many others. Just suppose, we must all
have said to ourselves, the situation were otherwise.
Suppose that we were the only living creatures; that we
nourished ourselves as the plants do on dead minerals;
or perhaps that we were pure lonely spirits, the only
sentient creatures in the universe.

If that were true we know that for us, at least, the
whole experience of being human, of being alive, would
be vastly different from what it is.

But I have also often wondered how many of “us”
there are. How large, on the other hand, is the number
of those directing our civilization to whom no creature
other than man is important except in so far as it is use-
ful in some purely practical way?

No other age was ever so thoroughly convinced that
man is himself an animal and part of the natural rather
than of a supernatural realm. Biology was never before
regarded as so important a science and, in its present
aims and attitudes, it is a new one.

During the century that has passed since Darwin
startled the world, biology has concerned itself almost
fanatically with the question of how plants and animals
“came to be what they are”—despite Wheeler’s warning
that our knowledge “will always be extremely fragmen-
tary.” Recently it has more and more boldly asked the
perhaps unanswerable question of “why they are as they
are.” But it has also tended more and more to repudiate
emotional involvement and to dismiss as mere sentimen-
tality the kind of interest that is still to some “a perennial
joy and consolation.” As Marston Bates once remarked,
a biologist is sometimes forgiven for “loving nature,” but
only if he doesn’t confess his love.

Primitive man revealed his emotional involvement by
attributing to animals a consciousness like his own, by
clan systems that identiﬁed him with one or another
animal tribe and, sometimes, by offering a formal apol-
ogy to those he killed and ate. Some, at least, of the ﬁrst
fathers of biology justiﬁed their interest by challenging
the theological assumption that animals were created
only for man’s use.

They maintained, as John Ray, the ﬁrst great English
biologist, did at the end of the 17th century, that
“God takes pleasure that all his creatures enjoy them—
selves” and that it is man’s duty to study them sympa-
thetically because no other creature is capable of ap-
preciating the “inﬁnite goodness and wisdom” of the
God who created them.

Modern man, having escaped from primitive supersti-
tion, having rejected the concept of “God’s wisdom” and
having come to recognize himself frankly as merely an-
other animal, has, nevertheless, somewhat paradoxically
adopted toward his fellow creatures the attitude that man
is fundamentally and eternally different.

Instructing Noah after the ﬂood, Jehovah thus advised
and prophesied: “The fear of you and the dread of you
shall be upon every beast of the earth and upon every
bird of the air and upon everything that creeps on the
ground and all the ﬁsh in the sea. Unto you they are
delivered.”

And despite a minority of humanitarians and “nature
lovers” the prophecy has been fulﬁlled. Most animals
who have had contact with man have good reason “to
go in the fear of him and in the dread of him.”

It is only recently that there has been much talk about
“conserving” the natural world and most of those who
today consider it among the innumerable “problems”
with which we are faced think of “conservation” almost
exclusively in terms of present and future utility—under
which head they rarely include the “perennial joy and
consolation” afforded to some by the fact that the living
creatures who share the earth with us are “our only com-
panions in an inﬁnite and unsympathetic waste of elec-
trons, planets, nebulae and stars.”

Lack of interest in “conservation” either narrowly or
broadly deﬁned made, until recently, little difference to
our situation because it is only recently that man has be-
come powerful enough to change his environment except
over a very limited area.

Until a few centuries ago he was a species very thinly
scattered over a large earth. In fact, it was not until a
few thousand years ago that he could be called a very
numerous animal as animals go, and only a few hundred
years since he ceased to be, willynilly, a part, even a rather

World

Ornithologists
To Meet at Cornell

The world’s leading ornithologists
will converge on Ithaca, New York for
the Thirteenth International Ornitho-
logical Congress, June 17—24, at Cornell
University. Nearly 700 scientists from
40 countries are expected to attend.

The Congress, which meets every four
years, will be the ﬁrst ever held in the
United States.

Advance registration has been so high
that applications for membership in the
13th I.O.C. submitted after May 1, 1962
cannot be accepted. Convention ofﬁcials
emphasized that this is solely because of
lack of facilities to accommodate in-
creased attendance and not because of
any desire to limit membership.

The Congresses, principal interna-
tional meetings of scientiﬁc ornithol-
ogists, have been held quadrennially
since 1884 except during the two World
Wars. The last I.O.C. at Helsinki, Fin-
land in 1958 was attended by 505 people.

Presiding ofﬁcer will be Professor
Ernst Mayr of Harvard, who was elected
president at the Helsinki meeting. The
secretary general, in charge of Congress
arrangements, is Professor Charles G.
Sibley of Cornell.

Among more than 200 foreign orni-
thologists attending will be James Fisher,
Peter Scott, David Lack and E. M.
Nicholson of England; Erwin Strese-
mann, Germany; G. P. Dement’ev, Soviet
Union; Jean Dorst, France; Allen Keast,
Australia and Canada; Jose Borrero,
Colombia; “7. Partridge, Argentina; H.
Sick, Brazil; Nagahisa Kuroda, Japan;
Finn Salomonsen, Denmark; E. Moltoni,
Italy; Holger Holgersen, Norway; Kai
Curry-Lindahl, Sweden; Francisco Bernis,
Spain.

The Cornell University Press will pub—
lish a LOGO-page volume of the Congress
proceedings. About 150 scientiﬁc papers
will be given.

Among the American ornithologists
serving on committees of the Congress
are George H. Lowery, Jr., president,
American Ornithologists’ Union; Dean
Amadon, chairman, and James P.
Chapin, associate curator emeritus, De-
partment of Ornithology, American
Museum of Natural History; S. Dillon
Ripley, director, Peabody Museum, Yale
University; Alexander Wetmore, secre-
tary (retired), Smithsonian Institution;
Alden H. Miller, director, Museum of
Vertebrate Zoology, University of Cali-
fornia, and O. S. Pettingill, Jr., Roger
Tory Peterson, Roland C. Clement and
Alfred M. Bailey, National Audubon
Society. Dr. Pettingill is director of the
Laboratory of Ornithology at Cornell.

MAN, NATURE AND THE UNIVERSE—Continued from page 130

small part, of nature. He was clearly and consciously a
part of the living community, dependent upon plants
and animals for food, largely dependent upon animals
even for power. But within a century and a half the
balance, so to speak, has shifted more than it had previ-
ously shifted in all human history.

Man has multiplied prodigiously. At the same time,
his technology has made him less and less dependent
upon living things. . . .

Nature controlled us until we began, about two cen-
turies ago, to undertake the task of controlling nature.
The earth that man made is now beginning to rival the
earth that nature made, and released atomic energy has
made man for the ﬁrst time wonder seriously whether he
may not end by destroying himself. For perhaps half a
million or a million years he was constantly threatened
by the forces of nature; now he is beginning to be ca-
pable, instead, of threatening them.

For all these reasons it is more necessary than it ever
was before to ask how numerous are those who share
\Villiam Morton Wheeler’s attitude and how important
is the ability to feel his joy and consolation if the hu-
man being is not to lose some part of that humanity
without which he will be the poorer and the less content.

For the sake of argument let us grant something that,
as a matter of fact, may not be true—namely, that man
himself could survive in a world he had “conquered”
completely. Let us suppose correct those who believe
that the earth can be man’s alone. Let us imagine that
we have eliminated all of the animals and plants that are
no longer necessary to us; that we have used every square
foot of earth for homes, factories and farms or, perhaps,
got rid of even the farms because we have learned how to
synthesize food without the intermediary of plant life.
What, under those circumstances, will man have become?

Obviously, he will have ceased to be a part of
nature. He will not have any different companions in
the adventure of living. The universe will consist of man
and the whirl of atoms and stars. He alone will be alive
in an otherwise dead world.

Some speculators have imagined, like Bernard Shaw,
the beginning of such a time. Man, the thinker, is alone
or nearly alone in the universe. He is almost freed from
his body and has become a pure spirit, a kind of god.
But even if that should be possible and desirable in some
very distant future, the road that cuts us off prematurely
from nature threatens to make us, not men like gods, but
men like ants.

If I draw the picture of a world from which nature has
been banished to make room for man, his machines and
his constructions, there are those who will exclaim merely
“Why not?"

To that I can only reply that whether you think this
desirable or not, in such a situation man will have broken
his connection with the past and become something very
different from what he has always been. He will no
longer ﬁnd the world, in Thoreau’s words, “beautiful as
well as convenient; something to be admired as well as
used.” “The wisdom of God as revealed in the works of
his creation” will be a meaningless phrase. The emotions
that have inspired a considerable part of all poetry and
music and art will have ceased to exist.

Man will have all his experience with things that he

I32

has made, rather than with the, things that God or
nature—choose whichever word you please—has made. .
No ﬂower will suggest thoughts too deep for tears. Man
will know only machines, no longer any things that, like
him, are living things. . . .

By contact with the living nature we are reminded of
the mysterious, non-mechanical aspects of the living or-
ganism; by such contact we begin to get, even in con-
templating nature’s lowest forms, a sense of the mystery,
the independence, the unpredictableness of the living as
opposed to the mechanical. And it is upon the recogni-
tion of these characteristics that he shares with all living
creatures that any recognition of man’s dignity has to be
based now that we are so ﬁrmly convinced that he, too,
is merely an animal.

Man has begun to suffer from what the ancient poets
call hubris, the pride that goeth'before a fall. In the
previous history of living things it often has appeared that
an animal can be, from the limited standpoint, too suc-
cessful. It can multiply to a point where it exhausts its
environment. There is a possibility that man will do
just that. He may destroy the human race in a terrible
warfare or, less spectacularly, exhaust the resources of
his earth and die, as some think the dinosaurs died, simply.
because he consumes too much. Conservation in the
most usual sense of the word means merely trying to
manage resources so that this will not happen.

Should he succeed in so managing his resources, there is
the possibility that technology will permit him to survive
in prodigious numbers on an earth that supports no
other living thing, and that, no longer a child of nature,
he thus will become exclusively the child of his own tech-
nology.

This possibility I myself envisage with a horror scarcely
less than I feel at the thought of the physical extinction of
the species to which we belong. For we cannot want to
remain a creature whose intellectual, emotional and
aesthetic life retains its connection with what it has been
throughout human history unless we have experiences
with and take delight in the natural world now tending
to disappear.

Conservation, to be effective, must include love for the
thing to be conserved and a refusal to ask only how use-

ful it is. We must have our own version of what was
propounded by Ray. We must assume—whatever words
we may use—that “nature’s children all enjoy her care”
and that they are all part of “the wisdom of God.”

Some teachers of biology in the schools and colleges
of the United States recently have expressed concern over
the fact that theirs is not a popular subject. It is, of
course, “required” for premedical students but few elec
it unless they already have determined to make biology a
profession. Even more alarming is the additional fact
that of the few who do elect an elementary course only
a very small minority ever choose to pursue the subject
further.

Much is being said, not only about the practical im-
portance of science, but also about its importance as a
way of understanding and “adjusting to” modern life.
Much favorable comment was provoked by GP. Snow’s
recent ridicule of the “culture” of the so-called cultivated
man who knows little or nothing of modern science. Yet
even those students who respond to such contentions
seem to prefer the physical to those biological sciences

AUDUBON MAGAZI N E

 




that might seem more relevant to cul-
ture as opposed to technology.
Nearly all children are interested in
animals. Why should so few adoles-
cents care to study them in colleges?

That question is being pondered at
the moment by a foundation-sup-
ported Biological Sciences’ Curricu-
lum Study under the direction of the
American Institute of Biological Sci-
ence. Already an answer to the ques-
tion has been implied: “Because the
biological sciences are improperly
taught.”

Just how they ought to be taught
still is being pondered. So far as I
know, no member of the study com—
mittee has been willing to say simply:
“in such a way as to encourage an at-
titude that includes a sense of the joy
and consolation of sharing the uni-
verse with other living things.”
However, there are some to whom
the encouragement of this attitude
is not wholly sentimental and un-
scientiﬁc.

It may be that the attitude of bi—
ologists and the way in which they
teach their subject may determine, as
much as poets and “nature writers,”
what the earth will be like a century
from now.

house on East Grant Road, far from the City. , .-

Edited,

R. KRUTCH’S new book, The World

of Animals, is just published. .In its

more than 500 pages, he has collected 120

selections —— by great writers and naturalists

from the 5th century BC. to the present;

about a dazzling variety of animals from

house cats to horses, butterﬂies to buffaloes,
tortoises to tigers. 5

The result is the most wide-ranging Single
volume of writings about animals ever to be
published (and the most beautiful, for The
World of Animals is illustrated with); more
than 50 drawings, woodcuts, paintings and
prints from 50 centuries of world art.)

Wonderful reading. But more: the book
is the ringing expression of a humanltarian
View — of the editor’s profound convictlon
that “the animal world is ﬁrst of all some-
thing to be loved and learned from rather
than merely to be studied and exploited.

He has included incisive writings for con-
servation and against cruelty (see the selec-
tions by Pepys, Montaigne, Thoreau and
Beebe, the devastating condemnations of
bull ﬁghts and other cruel sports, the elo-
quent arguments for saving wildlife by
writers from Audubon to Will Cuppy) that
makes his book a rallying point for all who

wish to preserve the wonders of animal

life.

W\ Other selections give glimpses

b into the fascinating lives of
individual animals ( you
join a naturalist in Malaya
in bringing up a baby
orang-utang or learn the
incredible secrets of the
sign language of bees).
Others are from the trea-
sure-house of world litera-

ture. Still others are purely
! for fun.

Among the authors are
great natural scientists:

r0130” / Darwin (selections from

The Voyage of the Beagle

and The Origin of Species)

. . . Alexander von Hum-

boldt on the electric eel

. . . Julian Huxley, who
3 suggests that birds exper-
5 ience all the emotions of

human beings in love . . .

F abre on the courtship of

(I / l l / scorpions . . . and dozens of

others including Francis

      

Parkman, Ernest Thompson Seton, John
Mun, Paul du Chaillu.

\« F rom literature, there are passages from
. lelville, Dickens, Colette and Mark Twain.
A Klpling Just-So story. A Sanskrit fable. A
selection from the hilarious 2nd-c'entury
classic, The Golden Ass.

And much more, including a passage

from a 19th-century vampire novel that
out-Draculas Dracula.

And all selections are enhanced by lucid
and lively commentaries from the editor.

In sum: a book to give a lion’s share of
pleasure and knowledge to all who ﬁnd
wonder and fascination in the world of
animals. And a magniﬁcent gift. The spe-
cial pre-Christmas price of $8.95 is being
extended to January 10 for all c0pies or-
dered on the coupon below. After January
10, the price will be $10.

Praise from the critics

;\. Y. HERALD TRIBUNE BOOK RE-
VIEW: “The whole theme is humanistic.
All the selections are both a delight and
enlightening. This book should ﬁll a niche
in almost any library. It is worthwhile,
charming and moral.”— Ivan T. Sanderson

N. Y. TIMES: “The most handsome gift
volume of the season.”

CHICAGO TRIBUNE: “Truly a treasury,

this clutch of gems of world literature and ‘

art on an endless engrossing subject.

IfYOZL Don’t Mind My Saying So, , . . ,.

JOSEPH WOOD KRUTCH

It wouldn’t be quite true to say that
“some of my best friends are hunters.” Still,
I do number among my respected acquaint-
ances some who not only kill for the sake
of killing but count it among their keenest
pleasures. And I can think of no better il-
lustration of the fact that men may be sepa-
rated at some point by a fathomless abyss
yet share elsewhere much common ground.
To me, it is inconceivable that anyone can
think an animal more interesting dead than
alive. I can also easily prove, to my own
satisfaction, that killing “for sport” is the
perfect type of that pure evil for which
metaphysicians have sometimes sought.

Most wicked deeds are done because the
doer proposes some good for himself. The
liar lies to gain some end; the swindler and
the thief want things which, if honestly got,
might be good in themselves. Even the mur-
derer is usually removing some impediment
to normal desires. Though all of these are
selﬁsh or unscrupulous, their deeds are not
gratuitously evil. But the killer for sport
seems to have no such excusable motive. He
seems merely to prefer death to life, dark-
ness to light. He seems to get nothing other
than the satisfaction of saying: “Something
which wanted to live is dead. Because I can
bring terror and agony, I assure myself that
I have power. Because of me there is that
much less Vitality, consciousness and per-
haps joy in the universe. I am the spirit that
denies.” When a man wantonly destroys one
of the works of man, we call him “Vandal.”
When he wantonly destroys one of the works
of God, we call him “Sportsman.”

The hunter-for-food may be as wicked
and as misguided as vegetarians sometimes
say, but he does not kill for the sake of
killing. The ranchers and the farmer who
exterminate all living things not immedi-
ately proﬁtable to them may sometimes be
working against their own best interests;
but whether they are or are not, they hope

to achieve some supposed good by the ex-
terminations. If to do evil, not in the hope
of gain but for evil’s sake, involves the deep-
est guilt by which man can be stained, then
killing for killing’s sake is a terrifying
phenomenon and as strong a proof as we
could have of that “reality of evil” with
which present-day theologians. are again
concerned.

Despiteall this, I know that sportsmen
are not necessarily monsters. Even if the
logic of my position is unassailable, the fact
remains that men are not logical creatures,
that most, if not all, are blind to much they
might be expected to see, and that the blind
spots vary from person to person. To say,
as we all do, “Any man who would do A
would do B” is to state a proposition merci-
fully proved false almost as often as it is
stated. The murderer is not necessarily a
liar, any more than the liar is necessarily a
murderer. Many have been known to say
that they considered adultery worse than
homicide, but not all adulterers are po-
tential murderers and there are eve-n mur-
derers to whom incontinence would be un-
thinkable. The sportsman may exhibit any
of the virtues—including compassion and
respect for life—everywhere except in con-
nection with his “sporting” activities. It may
even be too often true that, as “anti-senti-
mentalists” are fond of pointing out, those
who are tenderest toward animals are not
necessarily the most philanthropic. They,
no less than sportsmen, are not always
consistent.

Yet, if the Puritans really did forbid
bearbaiting, not because it gave pain to the
bears but because it gave pleasure to the
spectators, they were not necessarily so ab-
surd as Macaulay has made us believe. That
particular pleasure was evil in itself, and
to this day the Puritan logic is also that of
the Roman Catholic position (based on St.
Thomas): namely, that cruelty to animals is

ties common to mankind—love, dislike, anxiety
and doubt and the perpetual problem of right
and wrong, the need to earn bread and eat it, to
ﬂavour it with humour and a little malice, to be
temperate and forbearing, to keep the peace if
it could be kept with honour.

What is needed is not a new synthesis, a
new myth. It is individual vision, as Mr.
Haydn rightly said in the symposium. Add
to it, for our purposes, storytelling faculty,
command of atmosphere, and style. With
these gifts the old and simple things are
never trite; for triteness is merely the con-
sequence of self-distrust, insincerity or un-

creativeness; it is truth spoken by the un-
truthful, observations recorded by the un-
observant, banners of deep feeling awk-
wardly unveiling a shallow soul. With in-
dividual vision there is no need to mufﬂe
up life in myth, to project reality in sym-
bols. Great writers are born and not made
—not self-made by pulling up on one’s aes-
thetic bootstraps, or attending writers’ con-
ferences or laboratories. Great writers
come; they go. All we can do is watch, and
perhaps pray, that when the great talent re-
veals itself, we will bid it welcome.

 

The softer the batter,
the less the matter
to stuff the soul

for an hereafter.

ALICE VAN HISE

 




IF YOU DON’T MIND MY SAYING SO

wrong, not because animals have any rights,
but because cruelty corrupts men. And I am
so sure this is true that I am offended when
President Eisenhower tells reporters that
on his vacation he hopes to ﬁnd time “to
shoot a few crows.” I have no doubt that
crows have to be kept down. But I have
strong doubt that killing them ought to be
a pleasure.

If anyone asks me why we shouldn’t get
a little fun out of a necessary activity, I will
reply: “For the same reason that legal hang-
ings are no longer made a public spectacle.
The fallacy is precisely that of the Mikado,
whose sublime object it was to ‘make each
prisoner pent / Unwillingly represent / A
source of innocent merriment / Of innocent
merriment.’ ”

In the spring of 1955, a magazine called
Sports Illustrated distributed a question-
naire intended to determine the public at-
titude toward hunting. One answer received
from a woman in Tampa read: “I am not
the sloppy, sentimental type that thinks it’s
terrible to shoot birds or animals. What else
are they good for?” The New Yorker, which
reprinted her reply, answered: “Bulls can
be baited by ﬁerce dogs, and horses some-
times pay money.”

Two other quotations culled from recent
magazines are even more instructive because
they come from more sophisticated people.
The ﬁrst is copied from Time, which ran an
article about how duck hunters near Utah’s
Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge [sic]
“could hardly shoot fast enough to bring
down the ducks,” heading the article with a
quotation from Hemingway’s “Fathers and
Sons.” “When you have shot one bird ﬂying
you have shot all birds ﬂying, they are all
different and they ﬂy different ways but the
sensation is the same and the last one is as
good as the ﬁrst.” The other quotation is
again from the New Yorker, which reported
without comment part of an interview with
Sir Pierson Dixon, the United Kingdom’s
Permanent Representative to the United
Nations. “I like this shooting thing, stalk-
ing some relatively large animal or, even
more enjoyable, shooting birds. It’s like the
pleasure of hitting a ball.”

The difference between the two attitudes
is interesting. To Hemingway, the realiza-
tion that you are killing something that is
alive seems to be the essence of the pleas-
ure. Sir Pierson, on the other hand, is
neither looking for madder music and
stronger wine nor, like the lady from
Tampa, attempting to struggle with the
theological question of what animals are
“for.” His is simply that uncomprehending
innocence sometimes said to be most fre-
quently met with in the English gentleman
to whom it has never occurred that the
creatures he pursues are alive at all—as his
phrase “like the pleasure of hitting a ball”
reveals. Birds are merely livelier, less pre-
dictable clay pigeons. And it is in exactly
the same light that those of his class have
sometimes regarded the lesser breeds with-
out the law or even the nearly inanimate
members of all social classes below them.

Albert Schweitzer, with his “reverence for
life,” represents the attitude furthest re-
moved from this, and he has been made
quite a hero. But for all that and for all the
fact that ruthlessness and cruelty are more
often frowned upon now than at most pe-
riods of the world’s history, it is not easy to
be sure in What direction we are now tend-
ing. In fact, there is no prettier example of
what the Marxists call the inner contradic-
tions of capitalist culture.

When Thoreau allowed himself to be
persuaded to send a turtle as a specimen to
the zoologists at Harvard, he felt that he-
had had “a murderer’s experience in a de-
gree” and that however his specimen might
serve science, his relation to nature would
be the worse for what he had done. “I
pray,” he wrote in his journal, “that I may
walk more innocently and serenely through
nature. No reasoning whatsoever reconciles
me to this act.”

On the other hand, although professional
students of living things are somewhat more
likely to feel strongly a “reverence for
life” than the average man, they are only
somewhat more likely to do so. One of the-
most distinguished contemporary ornitholo-
gists told me that he saw nothing in the
slightest degree incompatible between his
interest in birds and his delight in sport.

THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR

Audubon slaughtered birds in wholesale
lots so large that he once remarked that
birds must be very scarce when he did not
shoot more than a hundred in a day. Many
present-day students ﬁnd no reason too
trivial to “collect” an animal or a bird,
although their consistent use of the weasel
word may suggest a defensive attitude. And
I have often wondered that sportsmen who
ﬁnd themselves subject to many restrictions
have not more often protested as unfair the-
“collector’s licenses” rather freely granted
and sometimes permitting the holder to
shoot almost anything, almost anywhere,
and at any time.

Teddy Roosevelt, himself a mighty
hunter, was more responsible than any
other one man for the establishment of the
ﬁnest system of national parks in the world.
At the moment they are more seriously
threatened than at any other moment in
their history, but I shall not go into that.
But I do want to note a fact relevant to the
whole question of “reverence for life,”
namely the near disappearance from the
liberal arts curriculum of natural history as
a cultural subject. From the mid-eighteenth
to the mid-nineteenth centuries, some fa-
milarity with plants, animals and birds was
one of the recognized elements in “The Ed-
ucation of a Gentleman.” Now, except in
isolated and more or less accidental cases,
even the biological courses, which have re-
placed the natural history American colleges
used to offer, are intended for and taken only
by students headed toward medicine or
some scientiﬁc specialty. They are likely to
begin with the dissection of the earthworm
or cockroach and then go on to the dissec-
tion of the cat. But they rarely have any-
thing to offer the student of, say, literature,

who might like to know something about.

what the nature poets he does study seemed
so strangely concerned with.

Not long ago I spent a week on the
campus of one of the older colleges of the
Eastern Seaboard which prides itself upon
being a liberal arts college and nothing else.
Adjoining the campus is a ﬁne stretch of
woodland presented by an alumnus and“?
planted with a beautiful array of native and

exotic ﬂowering shrubs and trees. When no
student or faculty member I had met could
tell me the name of one of the most strik-
ing, I sought out the one and only member
of the botany department. He smiled con-
descendingly. “I,” he said, “am a cytologist.
Doubt if I know a dozen plants by sight.”
Now cytology is a very important subject.
But are the secrets of the cell as essential a
part of a liberal education as some nodding
acquaintance with plants and animals? Per-
haps it was this very college which pro-
duced the immortal student of romantic
and Victorian literature who thought the
“pimpernel dozing by the lea” was some
sort of furry quadruped taking a nap.

“Nature Study” is now usually relegated
to the kindergarten or the elementary
grades, and even there it is tending to be-
come more and more a laboratory science.
I myself have seen a “progressive” school
where the pupils were being introduced to
nature through the old dismal process of
worm dissection, probably because that was
all the instructor had been trained in. And
that is by no means an extreme case. A lead-
ing biological supply house boasts of the
wide increase in the use of “nutrition ex-
periments” (grandly so called) in schools,
and it offers eight different deﬁcient diets
conveniently packaged, as well as the ani-
mals whose malnutrition when fed any one
of these diets may be observed by the curi-
ous. Very recently the head of the National
Cancer Institute has urged high-school
teachers to teach their pupils how to pro-
duce cancer in mice by the transplantation
of tumors and in chicks by the injection of
enzymes.

Is it sentimental to ask Whether anyone
not preparing for the serious study of anat-
omy is likely to be any the better for the
dissecting of a cat or whether anyone, no
matter what career he is preparing for, is
any the better for having starved a rat or
induced cancer in a mouse? However com-

IF YOU DON’T MIND MY SAYING SO

Forget, if you like, the rights of the mouse
—if any. Think only of the attitudes de-
veloped in the human child. In his cradle,
we read to him of Peter Rabbit. We “as-
sign” Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge and
Thoreau in college. But what is the use of
asking him to explicate “He prayeth best
who loveth best, / All things both great and
small” if his only contact with either the
great or the small is going to be a demon-
stration that what Shylock said about Jews
is true of animals also—if you prick them
they bleed and if you poison them they die.

Past experience has taught me that the
only reaction of at least half those who read,
or read at, this disquisition will be a simple
“So what?” “Ours,” they will say, “is the
age of Man, Machines and Useful Knowl-
edge. We are no longer part of nature
either physically or emotionally. To the
relatively slight degree that we are still de-
pendent upon natural products, we have
learned how to manage their production
with maximum efﬁciency and there is no
reason why we should let nature take her
course about anything. Animals other than
domestic and game are good for nothing
except for what we can learn by dissecting
or by experimenting upon them. All this
fuss about Saving the Parks is merely a sen-
timental plea for wasting ground that could
be grazed and lumber that could be cut.
Millions today rarely see anything except
concrete and steel and don’t know what to
make of anything else if they do happen to
see it. Their proportionate numbers are
bound to increase. Cities are healthier and
more convenient anyway, and any regret
over man’s increasing self-sufﬁciency is
merely what a certain well-known Colum-
bia University professor used to call ‘nos-
talgia for a lower form of civilization.’

“As for literature and the other arts—if
you still insist that they are somehow im-

portant—it is already being shown how
well they can get along without what you
call nature. Why shouldn’t a painter paint
factories and machines, which most people
are familiar with, instead of the trees and
beasts that most people are not? Literature
has a wide enough ﬁeld in sociology, psy-
chology, and that purely human nature
which is our chief concern. What does a
pimpernel dozing by a lea have to do with
modern man? As a matter of fact, I’m pretty
vague myself as to what it is. And I don’t
feel any the worse for my ignorance.”

If all this is the truth and the whole
truth, then obviously there is nothing more
for me to say. If it isn’t, then I still think
the proposal I once made to offer “Humani-
ties 313——Nature Study for English majors”
at Columbia was a good one. It may even
be that Saving the National Parks will have
to begin by getting natural history again
accepted as part of “The Education of a
Gentleman.”

One of the resolutions I made when I un-
dertook to conduct this department was to
keep what unsympathetic friends call “the
birds and the bees” out of it. The other
resolutions I shall mention one by one
when I break them—as I am about to break
Resolution Number Two, which was not to
return to any topic previously discussed.
Here, then, is a supplement to a previous
consideration of the “improved techniques
of communication.”

An Arizona friend, who lives in a com-
munity less citiﬁed than Tucson, tells me
that on a recent visit to New York her taxi
driver inquired whether or not they had
television “out where you come from.”
“No,” she replied, “I am glad to say we
don’t.” Whereupon the driver turned full
around to remark: “Lady, I agree with you.
That way you get illiterate fast.”

STORY OF A YEAR: 1848. By Raymond Post-

Reviewed by PRISCILLA ROBERTSON

History (when not ﬁctionalized) is almost
always written with a moral, whether it be of
the importance of economic or cultural fac-
tors, or simply the moral of the historian’s
own devotion to objectivity. Very rarely is it
written as pure entertainment. Yet, why
should we not be as entertained by our
ancestors’ quaint doings as by those of
African tribes or our own ex-urbanite
neighbors? All the social sciences have re-
cently come alive with so much colorful
information that they are by way of mak-
ing the most popular form of light reading.

In view of this trend we should not be
surprised that Raymond Postgate, whose
reputation as a “moral” historian rests se-
curely in other books, opens his Story of a
Year: 1848 with the declaration, “This is
not a boo-k with a purpose.” It provides,
however, most urbane entertainment.

The idea of the book is simply to show
what an average citizen of 1848 might think
of the world as he lived through the months
of that year, without any foreknowledge of
what would come later, without any more
thoughtful consideration of what was going
on than most average citizens give to the
affairs of 1956. Mr. Postgate does not actu-
ally describe his “observer,” but from the
kind of things the observer notices it is
permissible to deduce that he was a British
subject, since he suffered panic during a
minor Chartist demonstration although he
watched the bloody revolutions in France

with superior detachment. His View of
America, of course, was an outdated mix-
ture of the ideal and the absurd. He must
have been an indefatigable newspaper and
magazine reader, a subscriber to the I llus-
trated London News (from whose sheets
he got his idea of style) and to Punch (from
which he took his sense of humor). If one
accepts the deﬁnition of well-roundedness
as the ability to read all the columns of a
newspaper with equal interest, this observer
qualiﬁed. His concerns embraced politics,
art, fashion, travel, invention, medical the-
ory, “communism” and scandal. His think-
ing could be as profound as a Times edi-
torial or as irresponsible as the latest gossip.
In short, his mind reﬂected the moods of
the time without reﬂecting deeply upon
them. And although the average citizen had
no prescience of anything that was to come
out of the year 1848, Mr. Postgate slyly
manages to create in him an unusually
subtle ﬂair for noticing those details which
will in one way or another seem piquant
to his prototype of a century later.

How much, then, of the famous part of
1848, the year of revolutions and the Ca1i~
fornia Gold Rush, comes through? The chap-
ters proceed by months, January, February,
and so on. Take February. The bulk of that
month is occupied by the trial of Captain
Denman, who had pursued the work of Her
Majesty’s Navy against the slave trade with
almost more than legal enthusiasm. The
slave trade discussion takes twice as many
pages as the overthrow of King Louis Phi-
lippe in France. December shows up as the
month when Louis Napoleon was elected
President of the Second Republic in France,
while Americans began their mad dash to
the West Coast. All these are “important”
concerns, but they are sandwiched in be:
tween discussions of the whiskeriness of
British males, the claims of various patent
medicines, and an analysis of the Christmas
dinners which were served both to the rich

IfYou Don’tMind My Saying So . . . , .,

JOSEPH WOOD KRUTCH

It wouldn’t be quite true to say that
“some of my best friends are hunters.” Still,
I do number among my respected acquaint-
ances some who not only kill for the sake
of killing but count it among their keenest
pleasures. And I can think of no better il-
lustration of the fact that men may be sepa-
rated at some point by a fathomless abyss
yet share elsewhere much common ground.
To me, it is inconceivable that anyone can
think an animal more interesting dead than
alive. I can also easily prove, to- my own
satisfaction, that killing “for sport” is the
perfect type of that pure evil for which
metaphysicians have sometimes sought.

Most wicked deeds are done because the
doer proposes some good for himself. The
liar lies to gain some end; the swindler and
the thief want things which, if honestly got,
might be good in themselves. Even the mur-
derer is usually removing some impediment
to normal desires. Though all of these are
selﬁsh or unscrupulous, their deeds are not
gratuitously evil. But the killer for sport
seems to have no such excusable motive. He
seems merely to prefer death to life, dark-
ness to light. He seems to get nothing other
than the satisfaction of saying: “Something
which wanted to live is dead. Because I can
bring terror and agony, I assure myself that
I have power. Because of me there is that
much less vitality, consciousness and per-
haps joy in the universe. I am the spirit that
denies.” When a man wantonly destroys one
of the works of man, we call him “Vandal.”
When he wantonly destroys. one of the works
of God, we call him “Sportsman.”

The hunter-for-food may be as wicked
and as misguided as vegetarians sometimes
say, but he does not kill for the sake of
killing. The ranchers and the farmer who
exterminate all living things not immedi-
ately proﬁtable to them may sometimes be
working against their own best interests;
but whether they are or are not, they hope

to achieve some supposed good by the ex-
terminations. If to do evil, not in the hope
of gain but for evil’s sake, involves the deep-
est guilt by which man can be stained, then
killing for killing’s sake is a terrifying
phenomenon and as strong a proof as we
could have of that “reality of evil” with
which present-day theologians. are again
concerned.

Despite all this, I know that sportsmen
are not necessarily monsters. Even if the
logic of my position is unassailable, the fact
remains that men are not logical creatures,
that most, if not all, are blind to much they
might be expected to see, and that the blind
spots vary from person to person. To say,
as we all do, “Any man who would do A
would do B ” is to state a proposition merci-
fully proved false almost as often as it is
stated. The murderer is not necessarily a
liar, any more than the liar is necessarily a
murderer. Many have been known to say
that they considered adultery worse than
homicide, but not all adulterers are po-
tential murderers and there are even mur-
derers to whom incontinence would be un-
thinkable. The sportsman may exhibit any
of the virtues—including compassion and
respect for life—everywhere except in con-
nection with his “sporting” activities. It may
even be too often true that, as “anti-senti-
mentalists” are fond of pointing out, those
who are tenderest toward animals are not
necessarily the most philanthropic. They,
no less than sportsmen, are not always
consistent.

Yet, if the Puritans really did forbid
bearbaiting, not because it gave pain to the
bears but because it gave pleasure to the
spectators, they were not necessarily so ab-
surd as Macaulay has made us believe. That
particular pleasure was evil in itself, and
to this day the Puritan logic is also that of
the Roman Catholic position (based on St.
Thomas): namely, that cruelty to animals is

ties common to mankind—love, dislike, anxiety
and doubt and the perpetual problem of right
and wrong, the need to earn bread and eat it, to
ﬂavour it with humour and a little malice, to be
temperate and forbearing, to keep the peace if
it could be kept with honour.

What is needed is not a new synthesis, a
new myth. It is individual vision, as Mr.
Haydn rightly said in the symposium. Add
to it, for our purposes, storytelling faculty,
command of atmosphere, and style. With
these gifts the old and simple things are
never trite; for triteness is merely the con-
sequence of self-distrust, insincerity or un-

creativeness; it is truth spoken by the un-
truthful, observations recorded by the un-
observant, banners of deep feeling awk-
wardly unveiling a shallow soul. With in-
dividual vision there is no need to muﬂle
up life in myth, to project reality in sym-
bols. Great writers are born and not made
—not self-made by pulling up on one’s aes-
thetic bootstraps, or attending writers’ con-
ferences or laboratories. Great writers
come; they go. All we can do is watch, and
perhaps pray, that when the great talent re-
veals itself, we will bid it welcome.

 

The softer the batter,
the less the matter
to stuff the soul

for an hereafter.

IF YOU DON’T MIND MY SAYING so

wrong, not because animals have any rights,
but because cruelty corrupts men. And I am
so sure this is true that I am offended when
President Eisenhower tells reporters that
on his vacation he hopes to ﬁnd time “to
shoot a few crows.” I have no doubt that
crows have to be kept down. But I have
strong doubt that killing them ought to be
a pleasure.

If anyone asks me why we shouldn’t get
a little fun out of a necessary activity, I will
reply: “For the same reason that legal hang-
ings are no longer made a public spectacle.
The fallacy is precisely that of the Mikado,
whose sublime object it was to ‘make each
prisoner pent / Unwillingly represent / A
source of innocent merriment / Of innocent
merriment.’ "

In the spring of 1955, a magazine called
Sports Illustrated distributed a question-
naire intended to determine the public at-
titude toward hunting. One answer received
from a woman in Tampa read: “I am not
the sloppy, sentimental type that thinks it’s
terrible to shoot birds or animals. What else
are they good for?” The New Yorker, which
reprinted her reply, answered: “Bulls can
be baited by ﬁerce dogs, and horses some-
times pay money.”

Two other quotations culled from recent
magazines are even more instructive because
they come from more sophisticated people.
The ﬁrst is copied from Time, which ran an
article about how duck hunters near Utah’s
Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge [sic]
“could hardly shoot fast enough to bring
down the ducks,” heading the article with a
quotation fro-m Hemingway’s “Fathers and
Sons.” “When you have shot one bird ﬂying
you have shot all birds ﬂying, the-y are all
different and they ﬂy different ways but the
sensation is the same and the last one is as
good as the ﬁrst.” The other quotation is
again from the New Yorker, which reported
without comment part of an interview with
Sir Pierson Dixon, the United Kingdom’s
Permanent Representative to the United
Nations. “I like this shooting thing, stalk-
ing some relatively large animal or, even
more enjoyable, shooting birds. It’s like the
pleasure of hitting a ball.”

The difference between the two attitudes
is interesting. To Hemingway, the realiza-
tion that you are killing something that is
alive seems to- be the essence of the pleas-
ure. Sir Pierson, on the other hand, is
neither looking for madder music and
stronger wine nor, like the lady from
Tampa, attempting to struggle with the
theological question of what animals are
“for.” His is simply that uncomprehending
innocence sometimes said to be most fre-
quently met with in the English gentleman
to whom it has never occurred that the
creatures he pursues are alive at all—as his
phrase “like the pleasure of hitting a ball”
reveals. Birds are merely livelier, less pre-
dictable clay pigeons. And it is in exactly
the same light that those of his class have
sometimes regarded the lesser breeds with-
out the law or even the nearly inanimate
members of all social classes below them.

Albert Schweitzer, with his “reverence for
life,” represents the attitude furthest re-
moved from this, and he has been made
quite a hero. But for all that and for all the
fact that ruthlessness and cruelty are more
often frowned upon now than at most pe-
riods of the world’s history, it is not easy to
be sure in what direction we are now tend-
ing. In fact, there is no prettier example of
what the Marxists call the inner contradic-
tions of capitalist culture.

When Thoreau allowed himself to be
persuaded to send a turtle as a specimen to
the zoologists at Harvard, he felt that he
had had “a murderer’s experience in a de-
gree” and that however his specimen might
serve science, his relation to nature would
be the worse for what he had done. “I
pray,” he wrote in his journal, “that I may
walk more innocently and serenely through
nature. No reasoning whatsoever reconciles
me to this act.”

On the other hand, although professional
students of living things are somewhat more
likely to feel strongly a “reverence for
life” than the average man, they are only
somewhat more likely to do so. One of the
most distinguished contemporary ornitholo-
gists told me that he saw nothing in the
slightest degree incompatible between his
interest in birds and his delight in sport.

349

 




THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR

Audubon slaughtered birds in wholesale
lots so large that he once remarked that
birds must be very scarce when he did not
shoot more than a hundred in a day. Many
present—day students ﬁnd no reason too
trivial to “collect” an animal or a bird,
although their consistent use of the weasel
word may suggest a defensive attitude. And
I have often wondered that sportsmen who
ﬁnd themselves subject to many restrictions
have not more often protested as unfair the
“collector’s licenses” rather freely granted
and sometimes permitting the holder to
shoot almost anything, almost anywhere,
and at any time.

Teddy Roosevelt, himself a mighty
hunter, was more responsible than any
other one man for the establishment of the
ﬁnest system of national parks in the world.
At the moment they are more seriously
threatened than at any other moment in
their history, but I shall not go into that.
But I do want to note a fact relevant to the
whole question of “reverence for life,”
namely the near disappearance from the
liberal arts curriculum of natural history as
a cultural subject. From the mid-eighteenth
to the mid-nineteenth centuries, some fa-
milarity with plants, animals and birds was
one of the recognized elements in “The Ed-
ucation of a Gentleman.” Now, except in
isolated and more or less accidental cases,
even the biological courses, which have re-
placed the natural history American colleges
used to offer, are intended for and taken only
by students headed toward medicine or
some scientiﬁc specialty. They are likely to
begin with the dissection of the earthworm
or cockroach and then go on to the dissec-
tion of the cat. But they rarely have any-
thing to offer the student of, say, literature,

who might like to know something about!

what the nature poets he does study seemed
so strangely concerned with.

Not long ago I spent a week on the
campus of one of the older colleges of the
Eastern Seaboard which prides itself upon
being a liberal arts college and nothing else.
Adjoining the campus is a ﬁne stretch of
woodland presented by an alumnus and"
planted with a beautiful array of native and

exotic ﬂowering shrubs and trees. When no
student or faculty member I had met could
tell me the name of one of the most strik-
ing, I sought out the one and only member
of the botany department. He smiled con-
descendingly. “I,” he said, “am a cytologist.
Doubt if I know a dozen plants by sight.”
Now cytology is a very important subject.
But are the secrets of the cell as essential a
part of a liberal education as some nodding
acquaintance with plants and animals? Per-
haps it was this very college which pro-
duced the immortal student of romantic
and Victorian literature who thought the
“pimpernel dozing by the lea” was some
sort of furry quadruped taking a nap.

“Nature Study” is now usually relegated
to the kindergarten or the elementary
grades, and even there it is tending to be-
come more and more a laboratory science.
I myself have seen a “progressive” school
where the pupils were being introduced to
nature through the old dismal process of
worm dissection, probably because that was
all the instructor had been trained in. And
that is by no means an extreme case. A lead-
ing biological supply house boasts of the
wide increase in the use of “nutrition ex-
periments” (grandly so called) in schools,
and it offers eight different deﬁcient diets
conveniently packaged, as well as the ani-
mals whose malnutrition when fed any one
of these diets may be observed by the curi-
ous. Very recently the head of the National
Cancer Institute has urged high-school
teachers to teach their pupils how to pro-
duce cancer in mice by the transplantation
of tumors and in chicks by the injection of
enzymes.

Is it sentimental to ask whether anyone
not preparing for the serious study of anat-
omy is likely to be any the better for the
dissecting of a cat or whether anyone, no
matter what career he is preparing for, is
any the better for having starved a rat or
induced cancer in a mouse? However com-
pletely experiments up to and including
vivisection may justify themselves when
there is actually something to be learned
from them, is there any possible excuse for
repeating them merely by way of a spec-
tacle?

350

 




IF YOU DON’T MIND MY SAYING so

Forget, if you like, the rights of the mouse
—if any. Think only of the attitudes de-
veloped in the human child. In his cradle,
we read to him of Peter Rabbit. We “as-
sign” Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge and
Thoreau in college. But what is the use of
asking him to explicate “He praye-th best
who loveth best, / All things both great and
small” if his only contact with either the
great or the small is going to be a demon-
stration that what Shylock said about Jews
is true of animals also—if you prick them
they bleed and if you poison them they die.

Past experience has taught me that the
only reaction of at least half those who read,
or read at, this disquisition will be a simple
“So what?” “Ours,” they will say, “is the
age of Man, Machines and Useful Knowl-
edge. We are no longer part of nature
either physically or emotionally. To the
relatively slight degree that we are still de-
pendent upon natural products, we have
learned how to manage their production
with maximum efﬁciency and there is no
reason why we should let nature take her
course about anything. Animals other than
domestic and game are good for nothing
except for what we can learn by dissecting
or by experimenting upon them. All this
fuss about Saving the Parks is merely a sen-
timental plea for wasting ground that could
be grazed and lumber that could be cut.
Millions today rarely see anything except
concrete and steel and don’t know what to
make of anything else if they do happen to
see it. Their proportionate numbers are-
bound to increase. Cities are healthier and
more convenient anyway, and any regret
over man’s increasing self-sufﬁciency is
merely what a certain well-known Colum-
bia University professor used to call ‘nos-
talgia for a lower form of civilization.’

“As for literature and the other arts—if
you still insist that they are somehow im-

portant—it is already being shown how
well they can get along without what you
call nature. Why shouldn’t a painter paint
factories and machines, which most people
are familiar with, instead of the trees and
beasts that most people are not? Literature
has a wide enough ﬁeld in sociology, psy-
chology, and that purely human nature
which is our chief concern. What does a
pimpernel dozing by a lea have to do with
modern man? As a matter of fact, I’m pretty
vague myself as to what it is. And I don’t
feel any the worse for my ignorance.”

If all this is the truth and the whole
truth, then obviously there is nothing more
for me to say. If it isn’t, then I still think
the proposal I once made to offer “Humani-
ties 313—Nature Study for English majors”
at Columbia was a good one. It may even
be that Saving the National Parks will have
to begin by getting natural history again
accepted as part of “The Education of a
Gentleman.”

One of the resolutions I made when I un-
dertook to conduct this department was to

Resolution Number Two, which was not to
return to any topic previously discussed.
Here, then, is a supplement to a previous
consideration of the “improved techniques
of communication.”

An Arizona friend, who lives in a com-
munity less citiﬁed than Tucson, tells me
that on a recent visit to New York her taxi
driver inquired whether or not they had
television “out where you come from."
“No,” she replied, “I am glad to say we
don’t.” Whereupon the driver turned full
around to remark: “Lady, I agree with you.
That way you get illiterate fast.”

Spirit of an Age

STORY OF A YEAR: 1848. By Raymond Post-
gate. Illustrated. New York: Oxford Univer-
sity Press. 288 pp. >$4.50.

Reviewed by PRISCILLA ROBERTSON

History (when not ﬁctionalized) is almost
always written with a moral, whether it be of
the importance of economic or cultural fac-
tors, or simply the moral of the historian’s
own devotion to objectivity. Very rarely is it
written as pure entertainment. Yet, why
should we not be as entertained by our
ancestors’ quaint doings as by those of
African tribes or our own ex—urbanite
neighbors? All the social sciences have re—
cently come alive with so much colorful
information that they are by way of mak—
ing the most popular form of light reading.

In view of this trend we should not be
surprised that Raymond Postgate, whose
reputation as a “moral” historian rests se-
curely in other books, opens his Story of a
Year: 1848 with the declaration, “This is
not a book with a purpose.” It provides,
however, most urbane entertainment.

The idea of the book is simply to show
what an average citizen of 1848 might think
of the world as he lived through the months
of that year, without any foreknowledge of
what would come later, without any more
thoughtful consideration of what was going
on than most average citizens give to the
affairs of 1956. Mr. Postgate does not actu-
ally describe his “observer,” but from the
kind of things the observer notices it is
permissible to deduce that he was a British
subject, since he suffered panic during a
minor Chartist demonstration although he
watched the bloody revolutions in France

with superior detachment. His view of
America, of course, was an outdated mix-
ture of the ideal and the absurd. He must
have been an indefatigable newspaper and
magazine reader, a subscriber to the Illus-
trated London News (from whose sheets
he got his idea of style) and to Punch (from
which he took his sense of humor). If one
accepts the deﬁnition of well—roundedness
as the ability to read all the columns of a
newspaper with equal interest, this observer
qualiﬁed. His concerns embraced politics,
art, fashion, travel, invention, medical the-
ory, “communism”———and scandal. His think-
ing could be as profound as a Times edi-
torial or as irresponsible as the latest gossip.
In short, his mind reﬂected the moods of
the time without reﬂecting deeply upon
them. And although the average citizen had
no prescience of anything that was to come
out of the year 1848, Mr. Postgate slyly
manages to create in him an unusually
subtle ﬂair for noticing those details which
will in one way or another seem piquant
to his prototype of a century later.

How much, then, of the famous part of
1848, the year of revolutions and the Cali-
fornia Gold Rush, comes through? The chap-
ters proceed by months, January, February,
and so on. Take February. The bulk of that
month is occupied by the trial of Captain
Denman, who had pursued the work of Her
Majesty’s Navy against the slave trade with
almost more than legal enthusiasm. The
slave trade discussion takes twice as many
pages as the overthrow of King Louis Phi-
lippe in France. December shows up as the
month when Louis Napoleon was elected
President of the Second Republic in France,
while Americans began their mad dash to
the West Coast. All these are “important”
concerns, but they are sandwiched in be-
tween discussions of the whiskeriness of
British males, the claims of various patent
medicines, and an analysis of the Christmas
dinners which were served both to the rich

[fl/02¢ Don’tMind My Saying So, . . , ..

JOSEPH WOOD KRUTCH

It wouldn’t be quite true to say that
“some of my best friends are hunters.” Still,
I do number among my respected acquaint-
ances some who not only kill for the sake
of killing but count it among their keenest
pleasures. And I can think of no better il-
lustration of the fact that men may be sepa-
rated at some point by a fathomless abyss
yet share elsewhere much common ground.
To me, it is inconceivable that anyone can
think an animal more interesting dead than
alive. I can also easily prove, to my own
satisfaction, that killing “for sport” is the
perfect type of that pure evil for which
metaphysicians have sometimes sought.

Most wicked deeds are done because the
doer proposes some good for himself. The
liar lies to gain some end; the swindler and
the thief want things which, if honestly got,
might be good in themselves. Even the mur-
derer is usually removing some impediment
to normal desires. Though all of these are
selﬁsh or unscrupulous, their deeds are not
gratuitously evil. But the killer for sport
seems to have no such excusable motive. He
seems merely to prefer death to life, dark-
ness to light. He seems to get nothing other
than the satisfaction of saying: “Something
which wanted to live is dead. Because I can
bring terror and agony, I assure myself that
I have power. Because of me there is that
much less vitality, consciousness and per-
haps joy in the universe. I am the spirit that
denies.” When a man wantonly destroys one
of the works of man, we call him “Vandal.”
When he wantonly destroys one of the works
of God, we call him “Sportsman.”

The hunter-for-food may be as wicked
and as misguided as vegetarians sometimes
say, but he does not kill for the sake of
killing. The ranchers and the farmer who
exterminate all living things not immedi-
ately proﬁtable to them may sometimes be
working against their own best interests;
but whether they are or are not, they h0pe

to achieve some supposed good by the ex-
terminations. If to do evil, not in the hope
of gain but for evil’s sake, involves the deep-
est guilt by which man can be stained, then
killing for killing’s sake is a terrifying
phenomenon and as strong a proof as we
could have of that “reality of evil” with
which present-day theologians, are again
concerned.

Despite all this, I know that sportsmen
are not necessarily monsters. Even if the
logic of my position is unassailable, the fact
remains that men are not logical creatures,
that most, if not all, are blind to much they
might be expected to see, and that the blind
spots vary from person to person. To say,
as we all do, “Any man who would do A
would do B” is to state a proposition merci-
fully proved false almost as often as it is
stated. The murderer is not necessarily a
liar, any more than the liar is necessarily a
murderer. Many have been known to say
that they considered adultery worse than
homicide, but not all adulterers are po-
tential murderers and there are even mur-
derers to whom incontinence would be un-
thinkable. The sportsman may exhibit any
of the virtues—including compassion and
respect for life—everywhere except in con-
nection with his “sporting” activities. It may
even be too often true that, as “anti-senti-
mentalists” are fond of pointing out, those
who are tenderest toward animals are not
necessarily the most philanthropic. They,
no less than sportsmen, are not always
consistent.

Yet, if the Puritans really did forbid
bearbaiting, not because it gave pain to the
bears but because it gave pleasure to the
spectators, they were not necessarily so ab-
surd as Macaulay has made us believe. That
particular pleasure was evil in itself, and
to this day the Puritan logic is also that of
the Roman Catholic position (based on St.
Thomas): namely, that cruelty to animals is

ties common to mankind—love, dislike, anxiety
and doubt and the perpetual problem of right
and wrong, the need to earn bread and eat it, to
ﬂavour it with humour and a little malice, to be
temperate and forbearing, to keep the peace if
it could be kept with honour.

What is needed is not a new synthesis, a
new myth. It is individual vision, as Mr.
Haydn rightly said in the symposium. Add
to it, for our purposes, storytelling faculty,
command of atmosphere, and style. With
these gifts the old and simple things are
never trite; for triteness is merely the con-
sequence of self-distrust, insincerity or un-

creativeness; it is truth spoken by the un-
truthful, observations recorded by the un-
observant, banners of deep feeling awk-
wardly unveiling a shallow soul. With in-
dividual vision there is no need to- mufﬂe
up life in myth, to project reality in sym-
bols. Great writers are born and not made
—-—not self-made by pulling up on one’s aes-
thetic bootstraps, or attending writers’ con-
ferences or laboratories. Great writers
come; they go. All we can do is watch, and
perhaps pray, that when the great talent re-
veals itself, we will bid it welcome.

 

The softer the batter,
the less the matter
to stuff the soul

for an hereafter.

ALICE VAN HISE

 




IF YOU DON’T MIND MY SAYING so

"wrong, not because animals have any rights,
but because cruelty corrupts men. And I am
so sure this is true that I am offended when
President Eisenhower tells reporters that
on his vacation he hopes to ﬁnd time “to
shoot a few crows.” I have no doubt that
crows have to be kept down. But I have
strong doubt that killing them ought to be
a pleasure.

If anyone asks me why we shouldn’t get
a little fun out of a necessary activity, I will
reply: “For the same reason that legal hang-
ings are no longer made a public spectacle.
The fallacy is precisely that of the Mikado,
whose sublime object it was to ‘make each
prisoner pent / Unwillingly represent / A
source of innocent merriment / Of innocent
merriment.’ ”

In the spring of 1955, a magazine called
Sports Illustrated distributed a question-
naire intended to determine the public at-
titude toward hunting. One answer received
from a woman in Tampa read: “I am not
the sloppy, sentimental type that thinks it’s
terrible to shoot birds or animals. What else
are they good for?” The New Yorker, which
reprinted her reply, answered: “Bulls can
be baited by ﬁerce dogs, and horses some-
times pay money.”

Two other quotations culled from recent
magazines are even more instructive because
they come from more sophisticated people.
The ﬁrst is copied from Time, which ran an
article about how duck hunters near Utah’s
Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge [sic]
“could hardly shoot fast enough to bring
down the ducks,” heading the article with a
quotation from Hemingway’s “Fathers and
Sons.” “When you have shot one bird ﬂying
you have shot all birds ﬂying, they are all
different and they ﬂy different ways but the
sensation is the same and the last one is as
good as the ﬁrst.” The other quotation is
again from the New Yorker, which reported
without comment part of an interview with
Sir Pierson Dixon, the United Kingdom’s
Permanent Representative to the United
Nations. “I like this shooting thing, stalk-
ing some relatively large animal or, even
more enjoyable, shooting birds. It’s like the
pleasure of hitting a ball.”

The difference between the two attitudes
is interesting. To Hemingway, the realiza-
tion that you are killing something that is
alive seems to be the essence of the pleas-
ure. Sir Pierson, on the other hand, is
neither looking for madder music and
stronger wine nor, like the lady from
Tampa, attempting to struggle with the
theological question of what animals are
“for.” His is simply that uncomprehending
innocence sometimes said to be most fre-
quently met with in the English gentleman
to whom it has never occurred that the
creatures he pursues are alive at all—as his
phrase “like the pleasure of hitting a ball”
reveals. Birds are merely livelier, less. pre-
dictable clay pigeons. And it is in exactly
the same light that those of his class have
sometimes regarded the lesser breeds with-
out the law or even the nearly inanimate
members of all social classes below them.

Albert Schweitzer, with his “reverence for
life,” represents the attitude furthest re-
moved from this, and he has been made

uite a hero. But for all that and for all the
fact that ruthlessness and cruelty are more
often frowned upon now than at most pe-
riods of the world’s history, it is not easy to
be sure in what direction we are now tend-
ing. In fact, there is no prettier example of
what the Marxists call the inner contradic-
tions of capitalist culture.

When Thoreau allowed himself to be
persuaded to send a turtle as a specimen to
the zoologists at Harvard, he felt that he
had had “a murderer’s experience in a de-
gree” and that however his specimen might
serve science, his relation to nature would
be the worse for what he had done. “I
pray,” he wrote in his journal, “that I may
walk more innocently and serenely through
nature. No reasoning whatsoever reconciles
me to this act.”

On the other hand, although professional
students of living things are somewhat more
likely to feel strongly a “reverence for
life” than the average man, they are only
somewhat more likely to do so. One of the
most distinguished contemporary ornitholo-
gists told me that he saw nothing in the
slightest degree incompatible between his
interest in birds and his delight in sport.

349

 




THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR

Audubon slaughtered birds in wholesale
lots so large that he once remarked that
birds must be very scarce when he did not
shoot more than a hundred in a day. Many
present-day students ﬁnd no reason too
trivial to “collect” an animal or a bird,
although their consistent use of the weasel
word may suggest a defensive attitude. And
I have often wondered that sportsmen who
ﬁnd themselves subject to many restrictions
have not more often protested as unfair the
“collector’s licenses” rather freely granted
and sometimes permitting the holder to
shoot almost anything, almost anywhere,
and at any time.

Teddy Roosevelt, himself a mighty
hunter, was more responsible than any
other one man for the establishment of the
ﬁnest system of national parks in the world.
At the moment they are more seriously
threatened than at any other moment in
their history, but I shall not go into that.
But I do want to note a fact relevant to the
whole question of' “reverence for life,”
namely the near disappearance from the
liberal arts curriculum of natural history as
a cultural subject. From the mid-eighteenth
to the mid-nineteenth centuries, some fa-
milarity with plants, animals and birds was
one of the recognized elements in “The Ed-
ucation of a Gentleman.” Now, except in
isolated and more or less accidental cases,
even the biological courses, which have re-
placed the natural history American colleges
used to offer, are intended for and taken only
by students headed toward medicine or
some scientiﬁc specialty. They are likely to
begin with the dissection of the earthworm
or cockroach and then go on to the dissec-
tion of the cat. But they rarely have any-
thing to offer the student of, say, literature,

who might like to know something about

what the nature poets he does study seemed
so strangely concerned with.

Not long ago I spent a week on the
campus of one of the older colleges of the
Eastern Seaboard which prides itself upon
being a liberal arts college and nothing else.
Adjoining the campus is a ﬁne stretch of

woodland presented by an alumnus and?

planted with a beautiful array of native and

exotic ﬂowering shrubs and trees. When no
student or faculty member I had met could
tell me the name of one of the most strik-
ing, I sought out the one and only member
of the botany department. He smiled con-
descendingly. “I,” he said, “am a cytologist.
Doubt if I know a dozen plants by sight.”
Now cytology is a very important subject.
But are the secrets of the cell as essential a
part of a liberal education as some nodding
acquaintance with plants and animals? Per-
haps it was this very college which pro-
duced the immortal student of romantic
and Victorian literature who thought the
“pimpernel dozing by the lea” was some
sort of furry quadruped taking a nap.

“Nature Study” is now usually relegated
to the kindergarten or the elementary
grades, and even there it is tending to be-
come more and more a laboratory science.
I myself have seen a “progressive” school
where the pupils were being introduced to
nature through the old dismal process of
worm dissection, probably because that was
all the instructor had been trained in. And
that is by no means an extreme case. A lead-
ing biological supply house boasts of the
wide increase in the use of “nutrition ex-
periments” (grandly so called) in schools,
and it offers eight different deﬁcient diets
conveniently packaged, as well as the ani-
mals whose malnutrition when fed any one
of these diets may be observed by the curi-
ous. Very recently the head of the National
Cancer Institute has urged high-school
teachers to teach their pupils how to pro-
duce cancer in mice by the transplantation
of tumors and in chicks by the injection of
enzymes.

Is it sentimental to ask whether anyone
not preparing for the serious study of anat-
omy is likely to be any the better for the
dissecting of a cat or whether anyone, no
matter what career he is preparing for, is
any the better for having starved a rat or
induced cancer in a mouse? However com-
pletely experiments up to and including
vivisection may justify themselves when
there is actually something to be learned
from them, is there any possible excuse for
repeating them merely by way of a spec-
tacle?

350

 




IF YOU DON’T MIND MY SAYING so

Forget, if you like, the rights of the mouse
——if any. Think only of the attitudes de-
veloped in the human child. In his cradle,
we read to him of Peter Rabbit. We “as-
sign” Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge and
Thoreau in college. But what is the use of
asking him to explicate “He prayeth best
who loveth best, / All things both great and
small” if his only contact with either the
great or the small is going to be a demon-
stration that what Shylock said about Jews
is true of animals also—if you prick them
they bleed and if you poison them they die.

Past experience has taught me that the
only reaction of at least half those who read,
or read at, this disquisition will be a simple
“So what?” “Ours,” they will say, “is the
age of Man, Machines and Useful Knowl-
edge. We are no longer part of nature
either physically or emotionally. To the
relatively slight degree that we are still de-
pendent upon natural products, we have
learned how to manage their production
with maximum efﬁciency and there is no
reason why we should let nature take her
course about anything. Animals other than
domestic and game are good for nothing
except for what we can learn by dissecting
or by experimenting upon them. All this
fuss about Saving the Parks is merely a sen-
timental plea for wasting ground that could
be grazed and lumber that could be cut.
Millions today rarely see anything except
concrete and steel and don’t know what to
make of anything else if they do happen to
see it. Their proportionate numbers are
bound to increase. Cities are healthier and
more convenient anyway, and any regret
over man’s increasing self-sufﬁciency is
merely what a certain well-known Colum-
bia University professor used to call ‘nos-
talgia for a lower form of civilization.’

“As for literature and the other arts—if
you still insist that they are somehow im-

portant—it is already being shown how
well they can get along without what you
call nature. Why shouldn’t a painter paint
factories and machines, which most people
are familiar with, instead of the trees and
beasts that most people are not? Literature
has a wide enough ﬁeld in sociology, psy-
chology, and that purely human nature
which is our chief concern. What does a
pimpernel dozing by a lea have to do with
modern man? As a matter of fact, I’m pretty
vague myself as to what it is. And I don’t
feel any the worse for my ignorance.”

If all this is the truth and the whole
truth, then obviously there is nothing more
for me to say. If it isn’t, then I still think
the proposal I once made to offer “Humani-
ties 313—Nature Study for English majors”
at Columbia was a good one. It may even
be that Saving the National Parks will have
to begin by getting natural history again
accepted as part of “The Education of a
Gentleman.”

One of the resolutions I made when I un-
dertook to conduct this department was to
keep what unsympathetic friends call “the
birds and the bees” out of it. The other
resolutions I shall mention one by one
when I break them—as I am about to break
Resolution Number Two, which was not to
return to any topic previously discussed.
Here, then, is a supplement to a previous
consideration of the “improved techniques
of communication.”

An Arizona friend, who lives in a com-
munity less citiﬁed than Tucson, tells me
that on a recent visit to- New York her taxi
driver inquired whether or not they had
television “out where you come from."
“No,” she replied, “I am glad to say we
don’t.” Whereupon the driver turned full
around to remark: “Lady, I agree with you.
That way you get illiterate fast.”

ture of the ideal and the absurd. He must
have been an indefatigable newspaper and
magazine reader, a subscriber to the I llus-
trated London News (from whose sheets
he got his idea of style) and to Punch (from
which he took his sense of humor). If one
accepts the deﬁnition of well—roundedness
as the ability to read all the columns of a
newspaper with equal interest, this observer
qualiﬁed. His concerns embraced politics,
art, fashion, travel, invention, medical the-
ory, “communism”—and scandal. His think-
ing could be as profound as a Times edi-
torial or as irresponsible as the latest gossip.
In short, his mind reﬂected the moods of
the time without reﬂecting deeply upon
them. And although the average citizen had
no prescience of anything that was to come
out of the year 1848, Mr. Postgate slyly
manages to create in him an unusually
subtle ﬂair for noticing those details which
will in one way or another seem piquant
to his prototype of a century later.

How much, then, of the famous part of
1848, the year of revolutions and the Cali-
fornia Gold Rush, comes through? The chap-
ters proceed by months, January, February,
and so on. Take February. The bulk of that
month is occupied by the trial of Captain
Denman, who had pursued the work of Her
Majesty’s Navy against the slave trade with
almost more than legal enthusiasm. The
slave trade discussion takes twice as many
pages as the overthrow of King Louis Phi-
lippe in France. December shows up as the
month when Louis Napoleon was elected
President of the Second Republic in France,
while Americans began their mad dash to
the West Coast. All these are “important”
concerns, but they are sandwiched in be-
tween discussions of the whiskeriness of
British males, the claims of various patent
medicines, and an analysis of the Christmas
dinners which were served both to the rich

SPEAKING OF BOOKS ,.

HAVE long been interested in
the relationship of a writer
to a region that results in
“bookscapes,” and sometimes
literature. Searching through
history, one can find examples
to prove various things about
what causes-this fruitful fusion.
To be born and remain in a
place sometimes does it: Thor-
eau. To be born in a place and
leave it also does it: Joyce. Bal-
zac’s Paris, Dickens’ London,
Dos Passos’ Manhattan, all
prove what ‘? The birth of Rob-
inson Jeffers in Pittsburgh and
of T. S. Eliot in St. Louis would
not have led one (to predict that
the former would become fa-
mous for celebrating the rocky
coast of California and the lat-
ter the “waste land” of London.
Likewise unpredictable were
~two of the lasting books of Cal-
iforniana, both. written by
transients through the Golden
Staten—Richard Henry Dana’s
“‘,. '0 Years Before the Mast"
and Robert Louis Stevenson’s
“The Silverado Squatters." One-
book Dana! Not only could he
never reach the heights again
in subsequent books. N 0 one else
of any time or place has suc-
ceeded in writing a more truth—
ful, felicitous, and lasting book
of Californiana that is also
American Literature. Thousands
of books have been writte
about the state, and by thos
with greater knowledge of 1
than Dana. They remain merel
Californiana, while this earl
eiample of narrative and d -
scription endures as a maste -
piece of imaginative journalis
I use the latter word advisedl
for the book was written fr
a journal of the voyage.

I live on the same West rn
coast and can testify that w d

main essentially as Dana de-
scribed them. There have been
a few changes back from the
shore. I have seen icebergs and

erary focus than did the young

By LAWRENCE CLARK POWELL

.“Coastal fog spreading in-
land" says the weather report,
and on his brief honeymoon in
the Napa Valley above San
Francisco, Robert Louis Steven-
son saw it happen, and wrote
“The Silverado Squatters," a
work of Californiana which
bids fair to live long as English
literature. Neither Stevenson’s
native} Edinburgh nor Dana’s
Cambridge live in their books
as do the remote environments
they inhabited for a brief time.

It is always a delight to come
upon"the right man in the right

place at the right time, which

produces fusion or fission or
whatever we call that process
whereby a book is created. And
there can be no generalizing, no
rules or laws, no way of fore-
seeing or ordering it to happen.
The artesian well of prose may
start to, flow even in the midst
of the dry academic landscape,
as in the case of Austin T.
Wright, a professor of , Admi-
ralty Law, who secretly wrote

,that life- iving work of the im«

ion called “Islandia.”

AS appreciative as I am of
the books written by Joseph
cod Krutch when he inhabited
ew York and, Connecticut,
ught at Columbia, and was a
roadway criticwhis “The Mod-
e n Temper” promises to 'be as

Perhaps the excesses and

and the Arizona desert require
as correctives the sober prose

had prepared Joseph Wood
Krutch for what has wrecked
many a lesser writer. The enor-
mous landscape, the extremes
of weather, the proliferation of
a wanton populace, are stun-
ning, confusing and depressing
phenomena. "It is hard to keep
prose under control when writ-
ing, for example, about the
Grand Canyon. One either goes
purple like Zane Grey or lapses
into a Mark Twainism such as,
“Great place to throw your old
razor blades!”

In his three books about the
most colorful state in the Union

Now‘ Krutch is said .to be
writing a book about Baja Cal-

The Lure of Sun,

Increasingly, urban refugees are

in whose deserts the spirit blooms.

“the desert, it not exactly a" things to all men, is a great many different things to different people"-—Above, San Xavier Mission in the desert neat Tucson, Ariz.

By JOSEPH WOOD REUTCH

TUCSON, Ariz.

HE fastest-growing resort area

I in the United States is probably
in the great deserts of the
Southwest. Florida had its boom a
generation ago and is still going strong.
But Phoenix and Tucson, Palm Springs

and Las Vegas, which only a few years

ago were “out of this worl ” so far at
least as the East was concerned, are
now centers upon which thousands from
East as well as West converge by
plane, train and auto—not only in win-
ter but, to a surprising degree, in sum-
mer as well.

Palm Springs, for example, which
had only slightly over nine hundred
registered voters when it was incor-
porated in 1938, now claims more than
half a million visitors a year, and, ac»
cording to a study made by the Uni-
versity of Arizona, the value of the
tourist trade in the Tucson area
jumped from $20,000,000 to $58,000,-
000 during the past ten years. Mean—
while, the permanent populations of
Arizona and California are growing
by leaps and bounds, in part because

a surprising number of tourists re-
turn again and again until they finally
settle down to a new life in a country
which struck most of them at first
sight as almost bewilderingly strange.

Often their friends, who have never
crossed the Mississippi except perhaps
to visit in Los Angeles or San Fran—
cisco, are puzzled. What is so attrac-
tive, they ask, about cactus and sand,
gaunt mountains and strangely eroded
buttes of red or yellow sandstone?
What do they have to‘offer that could
persuade anyone to exchange for them
the conveniences, the luxuries, and the
intellectual or artistic opportunities
of the older centers of civilization?

THERE is no single answer for
everybody. The desert, if not exactly all
things to all men, is a great many
different things to different people.
At first sight there doesn’t seem that
there could be much common ground
between the rock hound, the photog-
rapher or the naturalist, all of whom
have found a new and wilder nature
to explore, and the fashionable set
which Spends its time in the swimming
pools and golf courses of the hotels,
at so-called “guest ranches” or even
in the casinos of Las Vegas. There,
night clubs offer in even gaudier set-
tings and surrounded by much under
glamour girls the same comedians who
first made the same audiences laugh

in similar establishments in the East.

Yet even the more effete visitors to
such resorts do venture into the open
air, where they get a glimpse of the
vast, blue, cloudless sky and feel the
dry caressing warmth of the winter
sun, both of which are hardly to be
imagined by those to whom the nor-
mal weather of New York or the tar-
nished skies and polluted air of Los
Angeles are typical of what the world
is like.

In the desert one can still find clean
air, starry skies and wide open spaces,
plus the sense never experienced in
more populous sections that they are
not anomalies but 'part of a world so
large that one may forget there is
any other. Mankind is not yet so com-
pletely urbanized, so completely in-
ured to pressure and crowds as it
thinks. There is an atavistic strain
which persists, so that the discovery
of open space, of room to move about
in, of a. region not yet tamed, exploited,
or even occupied, comes with the shock
of rediscovery.

The worldly minded visitor may
never wander far from the “developed"
resort. Yet he is, at least, dimly aware
of what lies just beyond. Even on the
paved roads he will not be driving
bumper to bumper and he will' be
breathing air, not fumes from an ex;
haust pipe just ahead.

The -- emptiness and grandeur of Ne—

vada scenery, as well as the obliging
laws of that state, are responsible for
the popularity of the roulette wheel,
the faro table, and that most unglam-
orous of gambling devices, the slot
machine. Losing money would not be
so attractive if Las Vegas and Reno
were not islands of frenzy and vul-
garity improbably surrounded by nat-
ural grandeur.

The taste for untamed nature in any
of its aspects is, of course, a relatively
modern phenomenon. It was not until
crowds had become more usual than
solitude and man-made environments
more familiar than natural ones that
men sought out wildernesses for the
pleasure they could give. Mountains,
oceans and forests have been popular
for a long time; the austere charm of
the desert has been more recently dis-
covered. -

WHAT is this charm ? What besides
sunshine and warmth and elbow room
does it offer? Geographers say (and
it comes as rather a surprise) that
in the history of our earth deserts
are quite modern. Still, they have been
here a great deal longer than man
has and they have exercised a tre-
mendous influence on the development
of the human soul. Astronomy, the
first of the sciences, was born in the
desert, and religion developed much of
its sense of (Continued on Page 62)

the forests and the seas, it is
one of the permanent homes of
the human spirit.

In the course of our national
development on a continent
large enough and varied
enough to contain mountains,
forests, seas and deserts, we
have been spoken to by the
voice of each and each has had
its effect, spiritual as well as
physical. Our ancestors were
men of one or the other, often
of successively. several. Even
the most materialistic of his-
torians does not deny that the

mous influence upon our de-
velopment. And the desert is

tier.

IT is not merely a frontier.
It has also a message of its
own. The mountains, the val-
leys and the plains spoke of
limitless opportunity and ex-
haustless resources. They in-
vited to action, development
and exploitation. Because
Americans are an active peo-
ple they are now asking how
the desert, the most difficult
of all regions to exploit, may
also be turned to practical use.
Perhaps they will in time
triumph over it completely.
But that time is still remote
and for the present the desert
speaks with its ancient voice.
It still brings man up against
his limitations and, like the
deserts of the East, ’bids him
to turn inward and to contem-
plate rather than to do. Of the
/ possible answers to the ques-
tion, “What is a desert good
for ‘2,” perhaps the best is
just “Good for contemplation”

which invited the Arabs to
think of the stars and the
Hebrews to think of God. Per-
haps it would be just as well
if we in our turn thought
more about both. »

seems little danger that

IN THIS ISSUE:

By JOSEPH WOOD KRUTCH

MANY take it for granted that progress

means the gradual elimination of
everything which God and Nature put
into our world and the substitution for it
of the conveniences which man has made.

I. like many of them well enough my-
self, and l have no illusions concerning
the “Noble Savage.” Civilized life is the
only truly human life. I will take wild
flowers and television if I can have them
both. But a civilization which has no
appreciation of or love for the beauties of
Nature is only a new kind of barbarism.

It is good that we have our parks, our
museums, our nature-study clubs. Never~
theless, opportunities to see wild birds in
ﬂight or a wild flower blooming in lonely
loveliness grow fewer and fewer because
we do not value them enough.

Of course, we need paved highways.
But we need quiet wood roads, too. \Ve
need television, yet we also need the op—
portunity to see geese flying against the
autumn sky. Unless we realize how much
we need these simple pleasures, the time
may come when we won’t have them.
“Nature is the Art of God,” and a ﬂower
is more wonderful than the most ingen~
ions of man’s machines.

Josepn \vooo KRUTCH has been a Broadway drama
critic, professor of literature, writer and philosopher.
His two most recent books reﬂect his abiding interest
in man and nature.- ”The Gardener’s ”li’orld” and
”Human Nature and the Human Condition.”

‘Madame,

I received your letter forwarded from the Animal Protective League
in Cleveland and I will endeavor to explain the situation that you have
mentioned.

In the State of Ohio fox are placed in the rodent catagory; there-
fore they are not protected by the division of wildlife nor the humane laws
or any other laws pertainimg to animals domestic or otherwise. Most of the
counties in the State of Ohio are paying a bounty of $3.00 per fox to try
to eliminate them, as our State is completely overrun with fox, and as you
know they are a common carrier of various communicable diseases affecting
both domestic animals and wildlife. Most dreaded diseases that they are car-
ries of are distemper, hepatitus, and the most dreaded rabies.

I agree with you that clubbing any animal whether domestic or in
the wildlife nature is not what I determine a practical way of disposing
of them. However, it is practically impossible for us officers to eliminate
such practice when as I have mentioned.before that fox are definitly con-
sidered rodents in the State of Ohio.

If you.have further questioning in regards to this matter I will
be at your service.

Hmane Officer

Dear Mrs. Stevens:

As agreed on the phone, we are using the Institute's name and
address in the order form on the mailing piece on GRAND CANYON. we are
to do the shipping, and will bill you at a discount of 25% off the list
price. '

As to the mechanics, you can simply send us mailing labels,
with an order or letter stating so many copies are to be shipped as per
attached labels--or, if you prefer, you can send us the orders you receive
(after detaching the checks or money orders), and we'll take care of the
mailing labels ourselves. Copies of the orders would be sent to you
with the bills, so that you would have a record of them, in case any
question should arise.

I received permission from Mr. Teale yesterday by mail and by
phone from the Herald Tribune, confirmed by letter received today. We
are having type set for the order form and for some copy to be printed
with the Tesla review. To keep the weight down, I shall have the piece
printed on a l6-pound stock. In spite of the slow-down that comes
inevitably with the holiday season I hope to have the finished job at
Janet Schwartz, Inc., on January 5th.

Yours sincerely,

BEAST—~Most mammals are active in winter, although creatures like the gray squirrel, above,
may stay holed up tor several days in their tree shelters in especially inclement weather.

Now the Animal World Goes to Sleep X

By IOSEPH WOOD KRUTCH

O Thoreau it was “that grand old
poem called winter,”-.but neither
writers nor the general public

usually speak so well of it. Ski en-

thusiasts excepted, few people ever.

exclaim “Winter has come!” in the
tone of voice they reserve for the more
popular seasons, and Shelley couldn’t
think of anything more favorable to
say than that spring could not be far
behind. ‘ ‘ -_

Snow, ice and bitter winds seem to
fall upon the living world like some
irretrievable calamity and to leave
nothing but ruin where trees had
rustled and flowers bloomed. Even
those to whom the love of nature is a
dominant passion sometimes speak of
“the dead of winter” and a winter
landscape can indeed look like a lunar
one—as though forever silent and
never to live again.

 

JOSEPH WOOD KRUTCH is the author of
several books concerning nature, including “The
Great Chain of Life" and “The Twelve Seasons."

22

But, of course, “dead of winter” is
wrong. Even “sleep of winter” doesn’t
cover everything. But it does cOver a
great deal more. Though a few of the
animals—mammals in particular—are
wide-awake, most of them are, like
most of the plants, quiescent—some
lying motionless but awake; some in
that half-sleep of the bear whose young
are born while their mother dozes;
some in that deep sleep called hiber-
nation; many morelocked in the death-
like suspension of all visible activity
characteristic of the wintering egg,
seed, Chrysalis, or cocoon.

Even for the proudly technological
human being, survival is to some ex-
tent a problem, and among animals

there are few, if any, who do not

either withdraw in some way from
winter or face an intensified struggle
for existence. The various devices by
which winter is eluded or made en-
durable have been learned over a long
period of time. At least, all the higher
animals must have got their start in
regions where winter never came, and,

STILL LIFE—“Not dead but sleeping" is a fitting description of the mood of the animal world
from December until spring. Beneath the ice and crust life goes on—some species motionless but

if the evolutionists are right, slowly
worked out their astonishingly varied
survival techniques as. the rigors of
the weather increased.

WHAT is true of the animals is

true of the plants, too—but with dif-
ferences. And if we leave the plants
aside for the moment to consider only
that half of animate creation with
which we are closely allied, we may be
humiliated to discover how little man
himself has added to the techniques in-
vented by his humble cousins. One of
them~~hibernation~—he has abandoned,
and one—the great, Promethean dis-
covery that fire can be started and
controlledmis his aione. Otherwise he
does only what other animals were
doing many millennia before his ap-
pearance—building shelters, producing
heavier clothing, storing food, or sim-
ply going away to some region where
it doesn’t get so cold.

This last maneuver is called “taking
‘a winter vacation” when men adopt it
and “migration” when applied to ani-
mals. Many of the latter make minor

shifts from a cooler spot to a warmer,
but migration on any large scale is
practiced almost exclusively by the
hoofed animals (like the caribou), some
butterflies and, pre-eminently, by the
birds. Some birds—the Chickadee, for
instance—are found the year round in
the same regions, of course, and some,
like the robin, may move relatively
short distances; but many others, like
the oriole and the tiny hummingbird,
go all the way to Central or South
America, while one frantic world trav-
eler, the arctic tern, spends the North—
ern summer in the Arctic and the
Southern summer in the Antarctic.

Why do they do it and how do they
do it? No problem of animal be-
havior has been more discussed or still
involves more mysteries.

How, having no calendars, do birds
know when to take off ? Experiments
seem to prove pretty conclusively that
the lengthening and shortening of the
days, rather than any change in tem-
perature; is the signal. How they find
their way—uthe great question—is still
disputed. As late as the eighteenth

BIRDS—Many birds escape the worst of winter through the still mysterious process of migration.
But some, like these mallards on a frozen pond on Long Island, manage to sticlr it out at home.

state or are facing an intensified struggle for existence. Their methods of survival are various.

century an educated man could still
believe that swallows spent the winter
beneath the mud of pond bottoms.
What they actually do is no less re-
markable, even if confusion exists as
to its whys and wherefores. Our chim-
ney Swifts, for example, seem to travel,
one and all, to Peru. Why Peru ? Well,
perhaps only for the same reason that
some human beings always vacation
in the same spot: “Our family has been
going there for years."

WHAT of the many kinds of ani-
mals which, like most human beings,
are unable to manage a winter vaca-
tion? Deer, foxes, weasels, rabbits and
Wildcats are among those who store
no food, and some of them—“the deer
especially—may have a pretty hard
time living upon what they can find
by scraping away the snow. In the
water under the ice, muskrats find
food the year round and the prudent
squirrels and field mice lay up winter
stores. (The field mouse also supple~
ments his stores by foraging as he
makes his way along the tunnels he

digs through the snow.) Gray squir-
rels, too, are active, though. in really
inclement weather they may remain
for days curled up snugly in their leaf-
houses high in some tree.

If all these animals as well as the
wintering birds “can take it,” why
can’t others not too distantly related?
Why is it that the ﬂying squirrel is
active all winter, while the Eastern
chipmunk retires in autumn to a well-
stored burrow and stays there almost
continuously, even, in colder climates,
sinking into dormancy? And why do
the woodchucks, the raccoons and the
brown bats fall into complete hiber-
nation ?

No animal habit is stranger than
hibernation. It is not the same as
sleep, no matter how deep, It seems
halfway to death and one wonders if.
it could have occurred first with ani-
mals that barely escaped death in the
course of increasingly rigorous winters.
Men on the point of freezing are said
to grow drowsy, and that is exactly
what happens to the hibernators as
the cold comes on.

The process begins at about 50 de--

grees. The animals grow sleepier and
sleepier and their body temperature
drops because the success of the ma-
neuver depends upon the fact that they
cease to be “warm-blooded.” Thus the
temperature of a hibernating wood-
chuck may fall to about 37 degrees.
His rate of breathing declines from a
normal of thirty times a minute to as
little as once in five minutes. His
heart may beat only four or five times
per minute and he may remain, com—
pletely motionless for days on end,

VOLENT wakening is likely to kill
him, but wakening at the normal time
is rapid. His metabolism, which was
very low, rises to a fever pitch and
before long the woodchuck, formerly
hardly alive, is again as good as new.

It used to be said that no bird ever
hibernatesmperhaps because it knows
the better trick of going south, if
necessary, But only a few years ago
it was discovered that at least one bird
does. 3 Southwestern relative of the

Eastern whippoorwill, who tucks him-
self into a cranny and stays there in
the deep sleep of real hibernation.
Truly a most unbirdlike habit.

The ability to keep warm blood at
a constant temperature, by means of
a sort of internal thermostat that
opens the metabolic draft when neces-
sary, is a characteristic of mammals
and birds alone. Its obvious advantage
is that it enables the animal to be as
lively in cold weather as in warm.
Cold—blooded reptiles and amphibians,
on the other hand, move and indeed
live at a variable rate, which grows
more and more sluggish as the tem-
perature falls. The same is true or
many insects, and you can, if so in~
clined, tell the temperature on a sum-
mer evening by listening to the snowy
tree cricket. whose chirps may be
translated by a simple formula into
degrees Fahrenheit.

But warm-bloodedness has its disad~
vantages, too, of which the most obvi-
ous is that cold can reach a point

Dramatic Story of a Cash in the Globe

Joseph Wood Krutch

GRAND CANYON: Today and All
Its Yesterdays.
By Joseph Wood' Krutch. 276 pp.
New York: William Sloane Associ-
ates. $5.
Reviewed by
EDWIN WAY TEALE

N 1894, John Muir’s “The

Mountains of California” ap-
peared at a crucial time in the
history of our natibnal parks and
forests. It played an important
role in their preservation. In 1958,
in another crucial time when the
parks, as originally conceived, are
being attacked from without by
would-be exploiters and from
within by divergent views con-
cerning their “preservation” or
their “development,” Joseph Wood
Krutch’s “Grand Canyon”‘may well
play a somewhat similar role. It is
a persuasive and powerful presen-
tation of a fundamental philoso-
phy of conservation.

It is now twenty years since the
author first visited the Grand
Canyon. In the intervening time
he has explored both rims, de-
scended on mule-back to the bot-
tom, flown over the chasm and fol-
lowed by air the winding river to
its mouth at the Gulf of Cali-
fornia. He has observed the plants
from the small desert annuals that
rush7from seed to seed in six weeks
to the bristlecone pine that is now
known to have a longer life-span
than the redwoods. He has
watched the songbirds that go
down one side of the canyon and
up the other rather than straight
across. He has read the story writ-
ten in the rocks of the vertical
cliffs. And he has thoughtfully
contemplated the innumerable
human visitors —— the man who
cast: one glance over the canyon-
rim and rushed back to throw his
arms around the nearest tree from
which he was pried with diffi-
culty; the tourist who asked if
the Grand Canyon had been a
WPA project and the man who
declared to a‘ park ranger: “You
can’t tell me that this was made
without human aid!”

The central subject of his book
is an irregular gash, 200 miles
long, a mile deep and from four to

eighteen miles wide, cut through
limestone, sandstone, shale and
schist. Nowhere else on earth is
the structure of the globe’s outer
shell so clearly revealed. Because
the water of the Colorado River
proverbially is “too thick to drink,
too thin to plow” the Grand Can-
yon exists today. For a million
years at least its moving burden
of sand and silt has cut. into the
rock like an abrasive wheel as the
great dome of the plateau across
which it flows bulged slowly up-
ward. Even today the deepening
of the canyon continues at a rate
that, every three years, equals the
excavation of a Panama Canal.

For Joseph Wood Krutch one of
the most impressive things about
the Grand Canyon is the manner
in which it has remained so com-
pletely unchanged. It is as un-
tamed as it was when the Span-
iard Cardenas. ﬁrst saw it in
1540, as unmarred as it was
when the indomitable John Wes-
ley Powell navigated the chasm
in 1869. Although it is one of “the
wonders of the world," visited
constantly, the accommodations
for tourists are concentrated in a.
relatively small area. The can-
yon itself, by its magnitude and
inviolate nature, remains aloof.
Here the problem of so-called “im-
provement,” which is plaguing
many parks, hardly exists.

Across America, where wilder-
ness once predominated, wilderness
is becoming a rarity, available
mainly in national parks. It was
the intention of the National Parks
Act to hold forever in check the
power to ravage these areas. But,
as Mr. Krutch points out, that
power still ominously exists.

“Those,” he writes, “who would
cut the timber, slaughter the ani-
mals as game, turn/cattle loose to
graze, fioOd the area with dams,
or even open them up to real
estate subdivision are fond of say-
ing, ‘After all, human needs come
first.’ But of what needs and of
what human beings are they
thinking? Of the material needs
(or rather profits) of a few
ranchers and lumbermen, or of
the mental and physical health.

S A SPECTACLE THE GRAND CANYON attracts
visitors from all over the world. Even more importantly,
the Canyon is a biological unity and the most revealing
single page of the earth’s history to be found on the face
of the globe.

Twenty years ago, Mr. Krutch went to the Grand
Canyon for the ﬁrst time. Its wonder and magniﬁcence
drew him back time and time again. He has lived near
it, explored and studied it in all its aspects.

The result is an extraordinary book which says more,
perhaps, than any other book that has ever been written
about this spectacular creation of nature.

Inevitably, there is something here for everyone: the
layman, the geologist, the naturalist, the biologist, the
botanist — and each aspect is part of a larger picture in
which geology, climate, vegetation and animal life are
linked together.

Nowhere are to be seen rocks older than those which
form the sides of the Canyon’s inner gorge. From before
the age of the dinosaur and trilobite to the present—day
mule that takes tourists to the bottom of the gorge, it adds
up to more than a billion years.

Mr. Krutch made, in one day, the billion-year journey
from the Archean rocks to the rim, and everyone, special—
ist and tourist alike, will follow enthralled to see it through
his eyes. He tells the visitor how to make the most of his
time and especially, for the good of his soul as well as his
mind, to give the Canyon time to weave its spell. At ﬁrst
all is wonder and amazement at the sublime spectacle,
but later come wisdom and understanding not only of the
Canyon but of this fascinating world we live in.

Mr. Krutch also talks of the history —- of the Spaniard,
Cardenas, the ﬁrst white man ever to see the Canyon in
1540; of the Americans, Ives, Merriam, Powell, and others.
He pays special tribute to Theodore Roosevelt who made
the area a national park.

This is not only a work of science, it is a work of
magic, for in his prose Mr. Krutch shows you the splendor
and magniﬁcence, spiritual as well as physical, of the Can-
yon. This book is a major work, in every way, by a writer
of wisdom, knowledge and perception.

D‘YOu Don’t Mind My Saying So , . . , , ,

jOSEPH WOOD KRUT'CH

What, I have sometimes wondered, is the
most important question a man can ask? Is
it, perhaps, “Does God exist?” or only, as
some maintain, “What kind of society pro-
vides for the most efﬁcient and equitable
system of production and distribution?”

Each of these questions is the archetype of
a whole set, every one of which involves the
same issue. If, for instance, you ask whether
or not there are any moral absolutes which
man disregards at his peril, you are asking
at least part of what the question “Does
God exist?” implies. If you ask instead,
“What sort of education should the citizen
be given to assure him a proper adjustment
to the world in' which he lives?” you are
choosing a member of the family to which
the other belongs. Which question you con-
sider fundamental depends upon which of
two premises you choose. Either man has
his being in a universe he did not make
and which, therefore, he cannot fundamen-
tally change, or the universe in which he
lives is, both physically and morally, what-
ever he makes it.

Like many of my contemporaries I don’t
like to bring in God. For one thing, the
term has been deﬁned in too many ways
to be surely meaningful. For another, even
a precise deﬁnition would commit us to
dealing with a question too large and re-
mote for a rational answer in terms of our
experience. There have been times when it
could be asked and such times may come
again. But I, at least, must settle for a ques-
tion far less inclusive: “Is there any such
thing as human nature?” Are there beliefs,
enterprises and ways of life consonant with
that nature, and others which are not and
never could be made consonant with it?
Or can human nature adapt and adjust to
anything? Should we ask not merely “Which

society provides for the most efﬁcient and
equitable system of production and distri-
bution?” but also “What society is most in
accord with human nature?” Similarly,
should we ask not merely “What education
best ﬁts a man for living in his World?” but
also “What kind of education and what
kind of world would best accord with his
nature?”

Such questions, I realize, have been in-
creasingly unpopular since Hobbes ex-
pounded the theory of what Locke was to
call the tabula rasa. Start with that theory,
and all the relativisms—social, cultural,
moral and aesthetic—logically follow. On a
blank slate anything can be written. Man is
whatever society makes him. Vice is not a
creature of hideous mien unless you have
been brought up to call some particular
thing vice and to call it hideous. There is
no use asking whether or not a custom or
a society or a procedure is in accord with
human nature. The sensible thing to do is
to adjust the human being to whatever his
society has evolved.

Do we have to accept this conclusion? The
eighteenth century faced it before us and
put up a ﬁght against Hobbism. If, it said,
the good is not What is in accordance with
God’s will, it is at least what is in accord
with nature. And there is, the eighteenth
century was convinced, something to be so
called. Moreover, nature’s law was assumed
to be discoverable—in morals and in aes-
thetics as well as in jurisprudence. What-
ever all men had agreed upon was according
to nature, and thus nature (including hu-
man nature) set up its own absolutes.

But the ﬁght against relativism which the
eighteenth century put up turned out to be
only a delaying action. Presently nature was
criticized out of existence just as God had

FAITHS FOR A COMPLEX WORLD: MELVILLE CANE

And constantly, and most importantly, to give more of oneself
to the self.

I cap what I have been saying with a quotation from Lord David
Cecil’s essay on Joseph Conrad which cautions never “to allow one-
self to be cowed by the danger and disaster of existence into sur-
rendering that faith in the value of individual nobility which is
implanted in the human soul at birth.”

Finally, what I most deeply believe may be found in the fol-
lowing poem, which appeared in this magazine twenty-two years
ago, and which probably says as much in its brevity as has been
gropingly spread over these pages.

THE TASK

How to cope
With the ﬂight of hope;

Under despair
How to endure
(Endure! Endure!)

And be more than a leaf
On the gale of grief,

And perceive, as only a fraction,
The pain and distraction.

How, in the perilous instant,
To hold, how dimly, the constant;

How dimly,
The way, the meaning, the mystery.

How, in the clutch of extinction,
Still to function, human!

This is the task, the prayer,——that I may save

The suffering god within, that he may live,
And greatly live, beyond the grave.

IF YOU DON’T MIND MY SAYING so

been. There isn’t, said the critics, anything
in religion or morals or art upon which
all men actually have agreed. The more you
learn of history and the more you study
cultures other than your own, the more ob-
vious it becomes that men can believe, do
and want the most irreconcilable things.
What any people calls—as all peoples do—
the law of God or the law of nature is
merely the custom of its community. And
there, up to the present day, the matter has
rested.

Of course, few of us—perhaps none—-
consistently follow such convictions to their
logical conclusion. I have heard the most
uncompromising relativists denounce the
crimes of the Nazis when they ought to have
said simply: “Their culture is not the same
as ours.” I have even heard relativists pro-
claim with quaint inconsistency that we
oughtn’t talk any longer about what peo-
ple “ought” to do. Even the Russian Com-
munists urged the workers to unite when it
should have been obvious that, according
to their own theory, only the dialectic of
matter could determine whether the work-
ers would or would not unite. Nevertheless,
ours is a world in which, increasingly, law,
public opinion, education and the social
services have been based upon the assump-
tion that men are whatever their society
makes them and that we should always ask
not what it is in their nature to be, but
how they may be adapted and adjusted to
prevailing conditions and tendencies.

Because all of this implies a deﬁnite an-
swer to what is to me the grandest of all
questions, I naturally wonder whether the
common answer is justiﬁable and perma-
nent, or whether we shall someday swing
again in a different direction and discover
evidence now neglected that human nature
really is something in itself and that it does
provide certain absolutes, valid at least in
the human realm. Have the anthropologists
been so preoccupied with the collection of
materials to demonstrate the enormous dif-
ferences between cultures that they have
overlooked some things which are common
to them all? Have the experimental psy-
chologists been so busy conditioning both

animals and men that they have paid little
attention to the resistance to conditioning
which both can put up?

One little straw blowing in the winds of
psychological doctrine is worth noting.
One school has begun to wonder whether
instinct on the one hand and the condi-
tioned reﬂex on the other really can ac-
count for all the behavior of living organ-
isms. Of course, a brain which carries writ-
ten upon it only a system of instincts is far
from actually being a blank slate. But that
is by no means all. Some members of a new
school have happened to remember: (1) that
birds know by instinct how to ﬂy and do
not have to be taught; (2) that though seals
do not know instinctively how to swim, they
are very easily taught to do so; and (3) that
you would have a very hard time indeed
teaching most songbirds to swim. In gen-
eral then, there are not just two classes of
animal behavior (inborn and learned) but
also a third—that which is not inborn even
though the ability to learn it easily is.

So astounded were some when their at-
tention was called to this obvious fact that
they began to wonder if the same might be
true not only of skills, but throughout the
whole psychic realm of beliefs, tastes and
motives. The old thesis of the moral rela-
tivists was that since no one was born with
the “innate idea” that dishonesty and
treachery are evil, the conviction that they
are is only the result of social education.
The Opposite could just as easily be taught;
value judgments, so they said, are merely the
rationalized prejudices of a given culture.

But, ask the new psychologists, isn’t it pos-
sible that some moral ideas are more easily
learned than others; that what the eight-
eenth century called natural law, natural
taste and the rest is real, and that it con-
sists of those beliefs and tastes which are
most readily learned and most productive of
health and happiness? Perhaps you can con-
dition an individual or a society to think
and behave “unnaturally,” just as you might
possibly teach a robin to swim. But men
who have been conditioned to think or be-
have unnaturally are as unhappy and as in-

THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR

efﬁcient as swimming robins. As the biolo-
gist Roger J. Williams puts it, “There are
blanks and blanks. The blank brain of the
child is capable as time goes on of accept-
ing, digesting (perceiving), and acting upon
a multitude of impressions that the brain of
a rat is quite incapable of handling.” What
is true of a rat is not necessarily true of a
man.

Is this belaboring the obvious? Not any-
thing so obvious that the implications have
been inescapable for those who preferred
to ignore them. What difference does it
make whether or not certain ideas are “in-
nate” if the capacity to entertain those ideas
and not others is? In that case the blank
slate goes out of the window and every un-
qualiﬁed relativism along with it.

We are back, it seems to me, to the eight~
eenth century and one of the most discred-
ited exponents of eighteenth-century ideas.
Pope put it thus: “Nature affords at least
a glimm’ring light; /The lines, tho’ touch’d
but faintly, are drawn right.” What Pope
thought of as a metaphor may turn out to
be biologically accurate. On the not quite
blank slate the lines are touched too faintly
to constitute an automatic instinct. They
are much like the latent image on a photo-
graphic plate. They are imperceptible un-
til developed. But what development will
reveal must already exist. There is, then,
such a thing as human nature. What we are
born with is not a blank slate but a ﬁlm
already bearing a latent image.

No doubt—as Pope went on to say else-
where, as experimental psychologists prove
in the laboratory, and as educators as well
as dictators have too often demonstrated——
the lines may be “o’er laid” and the un-
natural cease to seem a creature of hideous
mien. But the conditioners have to work
at it—hard. Men believe in, for instance, the
reality of good and evil much more readily
than they can be made to accept cultural
relativism.

Such an assumption is, at least, one which
no valid science forbids us to make, and if we
make it we are saved from the nihilism of
present-day cultural and moral relativism
as the eighteenth century was saved fro-m

the nihilism of Hobbes. In a sense, God—-
or at least a useful substitute for Him——
exists. We have again some point of ref-
erence now lacking in every inquiry which
sets out to determine what kind of society
or education or culture would be best for _
us. One thing is no longer as good as an-
other provided only it can be shown, or
made, to exist. \Me can stop talking exclu-
sively about what can be done to men or
what we can make them into, and talk again
about what, in themselves, they are.

This will involve what is certainly no
easy inquiry. One of the most terrifying of
Pascal’s pensées seems to range him with
the enemy: “They say that habit is second
nature; perhaps nature is only ﬁrst habit.”
To distinguish correctly between the one
and the other is one of the most difﬁcult
tasks we could set ourselves. The eighteenth-
century doctrine of nature collapsed largely
because that century was too ready to as-
sume that any cherished prejudice or habit
was really “in accord with nature”—a ten-
dency which reached a nadir when, for ex-
ample, Boswell convinced himself that verse
without rime was “unnatural” because when
he read Milton to a rustic he got the com-
ment that the fellow “would be riming”
but couldn’t quite make it.

If “the natural” really does exist, it is
certainly something deﬁnable only in terms
of the largest generalities. It won’t settle
disputes between Big-endians and Little-
endians. Monogamy, for instance, is prob-
ably not “natural” and polygamy “unnat-
ural.” But perhaps the conviction that some
code, rather than none, should govern the
relations between men and women is “nat-
ural.” Human nature and the societies in
which it can function reasonably well are
enormously variable. But perhaps they are
not limitlessly so. Those anthropologists and
those historians of morals who have gath-
ered so much material to prove that the
variety is limitless overlook the fact that
their evidence actually suggests the con-
trary. They may demonstrate that a spe-
ciﬁc action which is considered just at one
time and place was considered unjust at
others. But how many ﬂourishing cultures

Woodcuts by Paul Landacre for

“The Great Chain of Mfe.”

it is, I think, the best introduc-
tion to natural history that has
yet been written.

Essentially, Mr. Kru-tch has
set out to look into the biologi-
cal background from which man
emerged. “Whenever men step
doing things long enough to
think about them, they always
ask themselves the question:
‘What am I?’ And since that
is the hardest of all questions
to answer they usually settle
for what looks easier—«‘If I
don’t know what I am, then can
I tell what I am like ?’

“To that there are three com-
mon answers: ‘Like a god,’
‘Like an animal,’ and ‘Like a
machine.’ Perhaps there ‘ is
some truth in‘ all, but the most
evidently true is the second.”

What does it mean, to be
“like an animal”? What is an
animal like ? We have come
somehow to underrate this ani-

 

Mr. Bates wrote “The Nature

- of Natural History.”

The World Around Us ,

M ‘
THE GREAT CHAIN OF LIFE. By

_ middle:

mal background, this animal
nature, of ours: and in So do-
ing, to ‘ underrate ourselves as
well, Mr. Krutch thinks this is
all wrong; looking at animals,
he, finds them to be extraordi-
nary and fascinating affairs,
and man’s animal inheritance a

wondrous thing. “To be an Vani- '

mal is to be capable of. ingenu~
ity and of joy; of achieving
beauty and of demonstrating.
affection. These are surely not
small things, though there is
danger that we are forgetting
how far from small they are.
They are godlike attributes
whether or not there is any-

thing else godlike in the uni-n

verse. To be alive at all, even
if only as an amoeba is alive,
is to be endowed with charac-
teristics possibly unique and
certainly exceptional through-

. out that vast expanse of space

which extends for billions of
light years beyond us, farther

than telescopes—and much
farther than thought—~can
reach.” ' .

. The book begins, convention-
ally enough, with the so-called
“simple” animals—amoeba and
its protozoan relatives-which
are small, but in no other sense
simple. When we start our» ac-

counts with these 'animalcules

we are starting, ‘not at the be-
ginning of the story but in the
the. real beginnings,
the origin of life and its first
steps toward organization, are
still lost in a haze not really
penetrated by our speculations.

, But with the protozoa, we can
" at least see the possible begin-

nings of “love” and “death,” of
sexual differentiation and the
inevitably mortal individual.

MR. KRUTCH does not, how-
ever, go on to review the ani-
mal kingdom. He is most con-
cerned, through. the book, with
insects and vertebrates. He con-
centrates on these, and espe-
cially on the social insects and
on birds and mammals, because
of the complete contrast in the
way behavior is. organized in
the two evolutionary lines.- Mr.
Krutch is worried by “survival”
as the biological criterion for
“success.” How, by this criteri-
on, can you call the vertebrates
“higher” than the insects? In
fact, the vertebrates mostly
seem rather bungling. affairs
when'compared with the insects,
and ants will probably outlive
men by a great many million
years. The survival criterion
seems to argue that men should
be more like ants: which for
Mr. Krutch (and for me) makes
it pretty defective as a “value.”

Mr. Krutch thinks that the
primary reality for man is con-
sciousness, self—awareness, and
he sees through the verte-
brate line an increasing de-
velopment of this property.
Mammals are “higher” than
ants because they have a more
clearly developed awareness,
because for them joy-wand pain
-——have become possible. Here,
of course, Mr. Krutch has de-
parted completely from biologi-
cal orthodoxy. Yet there is
already a rebellion
biologists against the effort to
ignore the phenomena of con-

the animal attributes of the
Homeric heroes). Any biologist
——-or any personw-who reads
with, sympathy will be bound to
gain new insight into the nat-
ural (and the human) world.
I do not feel that Mr. .Krutch
,is trying to promote any vague
mystical theory, that he has
been caught in such verbal
traps as “vitalism” and “mech-
anism.” He is criticizing many
scientific concepts, like the
adequacy of natural selection
as a complete explanation of
‘ the evolutionary process; but
he is criticizing these concepts
”whether he likes it or not--—~in
a “scientific” way; He is plead-
ing ,for us to admit our igno~
rance and uncertainty when We
are ignorant and uncertain; to
have Open minds, and this sui‘ely
*‘ also is the ideal of science. In
dealing with science, however,
he is still _‘ being a humanist:-
looking for values and signifi-
cant meanings; looking for the
good and the beautiful, for~ re-
assurance and hope. Where else
can we find these things, if’not
in that wonderful world of, na~
ture, of which we form a part?

WORDS TO LIVE BY

 
  

Hands Off ,‘
The Stars!

By JOSEPH wooo KRUTCH

“The. sun and the moon and the stars would have
disappeared long ago . . . had they happened to be
within the reach of predatory human hands.”

“THE DANCE OF LIFE,” by Havelock Ellis

 

These words have recurred to me a thousand times. 1
remember them when l. look up from a city street to ﬁnd
no star in the sky; when I see some landscape laid waste;
or, for that matter, when 1 pass a spot in forest or park
where some picnic party has lingered for an hour and
will not be forgotten for a year.

What distresses me is not that man has used this earth
for his own purposes and often marred it in the using.
It is that we so seldom coimt the cost, weigh loss against
gain. We do not even ask how the loss can be minimized.

We have to build roads, but do we have to line them
with billboards? Are neon signs a more inspiring sight
than the moon? ls there no way of living well upon our
planet without making it less beautiful? Could we some-
times afford even to spare something that could be used
just in order to leave it for admiration and wonder?

The world is large and till now nature‘s powers
of recovery have been sufﬁcient. Much besides the sun,
moon and stars has been beyond the reach of human
hands. But every day those hands reach further and
wield more power. Already we are talking of hanging
moons of our own in the heavens and of colonizing Mars.

But with every increase in power comes a greater
responsibility to consider how we will use it. How many
of the hands we lay upon more and more things are
predatory hands?

Man is the most remarkable and perhaps the most
admirable of living creatures but arrogance is his beset-
ting sin. Belief in God was once supposed to keep him
humble, and when faith in God faltered there was still
Nature to remind him of something larger than. himself.
Most men now live where their own works are the only
ones they ever‘see. Man now believes that Nature can
always be made to do his bidding. . . -

Is he entering upon his greatest triumphs or is this
the pride which goeth before a fall? Perhaps a world

The Search for a Rule of Life

HEN some developments in
Wnineteenth—century science
aroused the apprehensions of
Charles Kingsley he communicated
them to Thomas Henry Huxley and
Huxley struck an attitude: “Sit down
before fact as a little child . . . follow
humbly and to whatever abyss na-
ture leads or you will learn nothing.”
Even today it would hardly do to
reverse this injunction. We can’t al-
ways refuse to face a fact before we
know where it is going to lead or
whether we want to go there. But
so many abysses, physical and moral,
have been opening since Huxley’s
time that we can’t quite share his
Victorian conﬁdence and we might
well add a caveat more often than
we do: “Be quite sure that it really
is a fact before you follow it too
blindly and too far.” Even science
'revises its facts from time to time,
and sometimes it happens that we
fall into an abyss between the time
when a “fact” is announced and the
time when it is discovered to be an
error. Science is not so nearly in-
fallible that the warnings of instinct
can always be disregarded.

Just how blindly and just how far
should we follow what, for instance,
we can read as a fact in a textbook
called “Psychology and Life”? This
bul’ky work by a professor of psy—
chology at the University of Southern
California is described as “intended
to meet the needs of students with—
out sacrificing scientiﬁc rigor.” Of its
more than 600 pages little more than
one is devoted to “morals,” and here
is the deﬁnition propounded: “Mo-
rality is the quality 'of behaving in
the way that society approves. . . .

When a person obeys the rules and
laws of his society we say that he is
moral or good.”

If this is a fact, then obviously
“moral” and “immoral” have no
meaning except in the context of a
particular society, and it must be
meaningless to say either that one

society is morally better than an-,

other or, what is probably more im-
portant, that any individual is morally
superior to the society in which he
lives. Moral excellence is a phantom,

"because you cannot exceed the stand—

ard. In Nazi Germany, for instance,
the torture and murder of Jews and
of political opponents constituted
“moral” conduct because it accorded
with “the rules and laws” of that
particular society. Any individual
German who refused to take part
in such activities was judged to be
immoral by the other members of

his community, and therefore he was
immoral according to our California
professor.

IS THIS conclusion an inevitable
consequence of a “scientific rigor”
which we should follow “no matter to
what abyss it may lead”? Or is it
merely a reckless opinion to be dis-
trusted just because it has already led
Nazi Germany and other societies into
what many men regard as a very black
abyss indeed? The question is of con-
siderable importance in View of the
fact that what “Psychology and Life”
states with unusual clarity is what
has been widely taught by many so—
ciologists and anthropologists as well
as by psychologists, none of whom
calls it “moral anarchy” (which is
what it is) but “cultural and moral
relativism” (which sounds not only
innocuous but laudably broadminded
and tolerant). -

As an esoteric doctrine “cultural
relativism” can well serve the pur-
poses of the rulers of a totalitarian
state raising up a generation of mass—
men fanatically devoted to “ideals”
which the rulers alone know to be
neither good nor bad except. in re—
lation to secret power-aims. But what
will the effect be in a democracy like
our own, committed to popular edu-
cation and to the widest possible
dissemination of “the truth”? What
line of conduct will a thoughtful man
in possession of such a method fol-
low? How will he order his own life
in the light of such facts that “sci—
entiﬁc rigor” compels him to accept?
And to what abysses will he follow
these facts?

These questions I have recently
been asking myself, and it seems to
me that there are only two logical
life-plans between which I could
choose. The ﬁrst and most obvious
is a Machiavellian egotism. Since
what is called “right” is merely the

LL the clotheslines in America bannered

The sentry American eagle might have blenched,
thinking the whole land was surrendering.
Not a bit of it. This was ritual.
This was sacrament and absolution.
Godliness had had its day. The next—

and the“ liberal views which she had
imbibed from her father and shared
with her husband, all made her ana—.
thema to Bismarck the Junker, the
anti—Semite, and the feudal politician.
He hated and feared this woman who
differed so sharply from the pious
matron—cook who constituted the
Prussian ideal of womanhood. Nor
was his fear without basis. Fritz
and Vicky given power would" have
brought parliamentary reforms to
threaten Bismarck’s absolutism.

POWER, however, they were never
to know. For when, after a weary
lifetime of waiting, Frederick suc-
ceeded his aged father as Emperor
of Germany he was dying from cancer
of the throat. In less than three
months he was succeeded by his son,
William II (the Kaiser Wilhelm of
World War I), who. had learned to
despise his mother as a meddling
foreigner and had always preferred
Bismarck’s blood, iron, and autocracy
to his parents’ liberalism.

Vicky’s story has never been told
more movingly than in “The Empress
Frederick.” Dr. Barkeley’s biography
sometimes has the mildly old-
fashioned ﬂavor of an authorized Life.
He starts off with “humble thanks . . .
to The Queen” for permission to quote
from the archives at Windsor, and he
makes more use of quoted corres-
pondence than Vicky’s previous biog—
raphers. He keeps his focus ﬁrmly on
his main characters, declining to be
drawn off into more than a minimum
of discussion about Prussian politics
or the personality of Vicky’s mother-
in-law or the drives behind Bis-
marck’s implacable persecution of the
English princess. What we have, then,
is an excellent compact biography
within the limits the author has set
himself; even though I found myself
wishing at times, for the sake of
fuller understanding, that he had set
larger limits.

German historians, Dr. Erich Eyck
excepted, have scarcely made a pre-
tense of being fair to the Empress
Frederick, and Nazi orators as late as
the 1930s were heaping curses on the
memory of that “scheming female.”
In her defense Vicky’s partisans have
been unwilling to face the fact that
she was to a degree unstable, subject
to waves of emotionalism and intense
adolescent crushes. Dr. Barkeley’s
sympathies are pro-Vicky, but he tries
hard for, and comes close to, objectiv—
ity. Disposing of the myth that she
dominated her husband’s ideas, he
shows that Fritz remained calmly,
sadly aware of the means by which
Bismarck’s victories were attained,
while Vicky was carried away by the
thrill of being on the winning side.

“Don’t worry about George—he’s some sort of visionary.”

Dr. Barkeley is also the ﬁrst biogra-
pher to emphasize the blame that
Vicky’s parents deserve for her difﬁ-
culties. They would not let her assume
her new role as married woman, but
bombarded her with advice and de-
manded that she write home daily.

On the score of Vicky’s greatest
failure, her tragic relationship with
her eldest'son, Dr. Barkeley tends to
string along with the View that the
Empress neglected her boy and turned
him over to a brutalizing education.
He does not mention that she wanted
to nurse Willie and was prevented by
her in—laws from doing so. To the
nineteen-year-old girl, once she had
performed her function of producing
an- heir, it may have seemed that the
baby was hardly hers to love; that
indeed he was not a baby at all, but
an institution. .

One may differ from Dr. Barkeley
on detail. I cannot imagine any
devotee of biography, however, who
would not get real satisfaction from
“The Empress Frederick.”

suns IN NEW YORK: Many things have
changed over the centuries, but prosti-
tution still remains the Oldest Pro-
fession. In “Sisters of the Night: The
Startling Story of Prostitution in New
York Today” (Julian Messner, $3.50)
Jess Stearn gives an informal survey
of conditions current in the country’s
largest city. Whether New York is the
beSt place for such a report is a moot
point, since the city has not harbored

organized prostitution for many dec-
ades.

But, intentionally or not, Mr.
Stearn’s book shows that prostitution
is not the oldest profession for nothing.
It is adaptable, and when eradicated
on the street level merely moves in-
doors. Without being overly lurid, Mr.
Steam, a feature writer on the tabloid
New York Daily News, shows that the
attractive, well-scrubbed, high—school—
type girl caught selling her body to-
day is almost always a victim of dope
addiction among the young. At far
greater. length, he interviews the
Jelke-type girl, attractive enough to
command sums from $50-$100 for a
few hours’ use of her body, and some-
times a mink jacket or nights at El
Morocco as a bonus. Such girls seem
to be New York’s largest prostitute
group today, and by their very exist-
ence raise another question. What of
the man willing to pay so much for
so little? What of the male type who
seems to feel a compulsive urge to be
victimized by orchidaceous girls? A
study of this genus homo would——
frankly—seem to ﬁll more of a need
than Mr. Stearn’s study of the call girl,
who, as in centuries past, is an emo—
tional child fond of clothes and hot
spots. He does bring out, however, one
fact usually imbedded deep in dull re-
ports-that prostitutes, street or E1
Morocco variety, are suicide—prone.
Alsothat, though she may have a ﬁne
ﬂing for a while, the girl just can’t win.

law or the custom of my community
I need have no concern with any—
thing except what the community
knows about. I will be careful to
retain its good opinion while secretly
taking advantage of every possible op—
portunity to violate law and custom
with impunity. As Machiavelli said,
the wise man will by no means always
tell the truth but will take care to
preserve his reputation for ‘ truth-
telling because he- can’t take advan-
tage of others unless they trust him.
If, for example, you have a chance
to take candy from a baby ask only
how likely it is that you will be
found out. Conscience will then be-
come nothing but what Mr. Mencken
once called it: “That still small voice
which whispers ‘Somebody may be

looking .

THE only other possible rule of
life consistent with an acceptance of
the supposed fact is less sensational
but will also lead in the long run
to consequences less than desirable.
Should I be so timid or—by heredity
or conditioning—so “group minded”
that I cannot face even in the secrecy
of my own heart the knowledge that
I am violating the mores of my com-
munity then, for me, virtue will have
to consist in the completest possible
conformity to those dominant opin-
ions which, for that community, de-
ﬁne the meaning of “good.” I can
never aspire to be better than the
average except insofar as I am bet—
ter because I deviate less than most
of my fellows from the norm. I can
never hope to raise the standard of
my society, because “raising the
standard” is a meaningless phrase if
the highest possible standard is, by
deﬁnition, that generally accepted at
the moment. Only an absolute con—
formist on the one hand and‘ anar—
chistic individualist on the other can
be said tor“follow the facts.”

Is there no tertium quid? I have
searched without ﬁnding one. Any
society which actually accepts and
acts upon what “scientiﬁc rigor” is
said to compel us to believe will
presently be composed of a certain
number of absolute conformists plus
a certain number of unscrupulous
“men of virtu.” And there are, of
course, those who say that it is
precisely towards such a society that
the Western world as well as the

world behind the Iron Curtain is
tending. , g

If we have not quite got there yet
it is because we have not yet followed

.Huxley’s advice with resolute con-

sistency. But we are on our way. As
soon as enlightenment has overcome
the effectiveness of residual preju-
dices, in favor of various traditional
notions, we will get there. “Psychol-
ogy and Life” says that philosophy
and literature have long concerned
themselves with morality but that
only recently has science taken over.
And it is no doubt because of liter-
ature that, for the present, most of
us act sometimes as though we be-
lieved that “vice” is somehow recog-
nizably a creature of hideous mien
no matter how persistently custom
or laws may describe it as divinely
fair.

As Pope himself knew, his couplet
is not always a safe guide. Vice
does not always strike us as hideous
because, so the next two lines warn
us, the customs of a civilization do
sometimes make us callously familiar
with her face. But the abysses to
which too conﬁdent a reliance on
the moral instinct have led mankind
are neither so numerous nor so deep
as those towards which the moral
anarchists (pardon me, the cultural
relativists) invite us to plunge. And
there is one striking cultural phe—

nomenon they seem never to have

noticed.

The most antithetical standards of
value, can, they are fond of telling
us, serve equally successful societies.
One ﬂourishing race may believe that
taking human heads is the most laud-
able act that any man can perform.
Another, like the American Hopis,
may live by peace. Competition may
be the very breath of life in one
place and so frowned upon in another
that any sort of personal. distinction
is almost a disgrace. As Lecky said,
there is no possible line of conduct
that has not been condemned as a
sin at one time and place, enjoined
as a virtue at some other. But there
is at least one doctrine which no
successful culture seems ever to have
accepted. And that is cultural and
moral relativism!

One and all, no matter how out-
landish the ways of some may seem,
if there is anything to be learned
from anthropology it would appear
to be. that the only really deadly
social philosophy is that which holds
that one way is as good as another.
At the present moment we are hardly
more sure than we were a generation
ago where to look for a valid “ought.”
But we are growing notably less sure
that we can get along without one.

MORE SALES, LOWER COSTS

THE BEST REPLY to Ronald Mansbridge’s
article “Books Are Hard Work” (SR
June 2) lies in a visit to any bookstore
in France. The French publishers have,
by doing away with boards, cloth bind-
ings, elaborately-illustrated jackets, and
expensive book paper on all new books,
reduced the price of their publications
to less than half that of new American
books—in an economy where the costs
of most items beyond food and rent are
roughly equivalent to those in the U. S.
If the French can do it so can we—if
our publishers have the guts and hard—
headedness to make the change.

In France the idea is that the lowest
possible price will increase the availa—
bility of books to those who like to read,
that those who confronted with high
prices in books may buy only one or
two over a long period of time will buy
as many as three or four in a single
visit to a bookstore when the works on
sale are geared to his pocketbook. To
state this in American terms, if I could
go to a store and ﬁnd immediately after
the reviews appeared Hersey’s “A Single
Pebble,” Shaw’s
Sevareid’s “Small Sounds in the Night,”
and MacDonald’s “The Ford Foundation”
at $1.00 or $1.25 each (rough approxi-
mations of average French prices for
new books) I would buy them all and
feel my four or ﬁve dollars well spent.
The only difference is that the publishers
would get my money in the imagined
instance, and that of thousands like me,
rather than nothing at all as at present.

I am aware some publishers made a
rather silly experiment along these lines
a few years ago, but it failed because
only a few titles were given this treat-
ment. As a result the general book-
buying public felt these must be poorer
than the hard-bound volumes he saw
surrounding them. To a certain extent be
was justiﬁed—almost the only title of
worth among all those so treated was
Romain Gary’s “The Company of Men.”

No, the only way in which such a
worthwhile change will ever be success-
fully accomplished is in its adoption by
all major American publishers of popular
new trade books at approximately the
same time, and with their entire output
of books (excepting a few special titles
which, as in France, can also be offered
in hard covers for collectors and libra—
ries—new novels by authors with a built-‘-
in reputation whom the wise buyer knows
in advance he wants on his shelves in
cloth binding). Then when “the publisher

will only be able to wonder why he

able to keep his ﬁrm both solvent and

I would like to' see some typical rep-
resentative of the large trade publishers
wrestle with his conscience and common
sense in “explaining” why this depar—
ture from the present incompetent pub—
lishing practices in new books cannot be
undertaken at once.

EXIT MR. PILTDOWN

A VISIT TO THE anthropological room of
the Museum of Natural History the other
day presented an. opportunity for a bit
of speculation. In one Of the exhibit
cases was a group of plaster heads de-
picting the various stages in the descent
of Man. In the upper-left corner of the
case a relatively dust-free area sug-
gested that one of the heads had recently
been removed. This suspicion was rein-
forced by the fact that a certain part
of the printed explanation alongside had
been masked out with tape. '

_ A phone call to the museum conﬁrmed
a personal belief that the missing head

was that of Piltdown Man. With a rueful
chuckle the voice at the other end ex-
plained that all references to the no
longer mysterious Piltdown Man had
been quietly and carefully disposed of!

POETRY AND VIOLINS

IN “EVERYBODY WRITES (Bad) Poetry,”
(SR May 5) John Ciardi wrote, “Ask
John Doe whether or not he can play

the violin and he would not dream of
answering, ‘I don’t know. I’ve never
tried.’ But ask him if he can write a
poem and it will be a rare and saintly
John Doe to whom it occurs that the
poem requires at least as much technical
devotion and at least as many years of
practice as does the violin.”

In Alexandra Tolstoy’s “Tolstoy” we
read: “Father Often said that in order
to write well one must learn how to
write. He was indignant when he heard
something like this: ‘Have you written
anything?’ ‘No, I’ve never tried yet.’ He
used to say: ‘How absurd it would sound
if to the question ‘Do you play the
violin?’ you received the answer: ‘No, I
haven’t tried’.”

This must be a traditional saying, for
it wasn’t new with Tolstoy either.

WRITERS ARE HUMAN

FAULKNER’S REMARKS were irresponsible,
and so was SR’s recommendation of them.
(July 7.) Perhaps he meant them as some
kind of helpful hyperbole, but the idea
that a writer may beg, borrow, or steal
in order to live while he writes could
make a heap of trouble if literally fol—
lowed. It’s true that Balzac’s great in-
dustry was primarily prompted by the
desire to keep clear of debtor’s prison,
and that plenty of modern writers pro-
duce in order to pay their alimony, but
I’m sure most of us write better for being
free of worries about imprisonment.

There is also the ghastly possibility
that a man may neglect his important
(though routine) social responsibilities
and still not produce any “Ode on a
Grecian Urn.” Keats himself did his man-
ful best, nursing a dying brother and at
least partly dying for love—as well as
developing his art. This would seem to
be the best model.

By JOSEPH WOOD KRUTCH

VER since the last Ice Age
E there have been incompa-
rably more different kinds of
native animals, birds and plants
- in North America than in Europe
—-—for instance, nearly 800 birds
here against 450 there, 131 trees
in the Great Smoky Mountains
National Park alone against
eighty-five in all of Europe.
Some are gone, some are going
and it is a disputed question
whether we ought to be proud
or ashamed of the care we are
taking to preserve them. The
distinguished English ornitholo-
gist James Fisher recently paid
us a magnificent tribute when
he said “Never have I seen such
wonders, of”“met landlords so
worthy of their land.” But he
did not mention the fact that at
the present moment national
parks and monuments are under
an attack unlike anything pre-
viously known since they were
established. Or that many of
our birds and animals are either
recently extinct or nearly so
whereas Europe has not lost a
single land bird in historic
times.

One thing, however, is cer-

tain: Americans are buying
more “nature books” than ever
before. Proportionally we may
not yet have caught up with
England, where, in 1952, there
was one new bird book for
every day in the year, but we
are getting there. Since nobody
knoWs exactly what should be
included under the heading of
“nature books” there is no offi-
cial record, but the list that ap-
pears elsewhere on this page
includes twenty titles for 1955,
and there were many more.
What are the buyers of these
books interested in ? Apparent-
ly in any and everything that.

course, as Mr. Dempsey sug-

posite page, there are an ‘ ton-
ishing number of how-to-do
books which will tell you how to
grow gardens, or breed new

 

Among Mr. Krutoh’s nature

and “The Best of Two Worlds.”

guppy varieties, as well as how
to do even less probable things.
But the how~to-knows are al-
most as numerous and cover ev-
erything down to a “How to
Know the Protozoa” issued a
few years back by the Wm. C.
Brown Company of Dubuque.

A hundred years ago even a
man as interested as Thoreau
was in such things found it im-
possible to identify some of the
most familiar features of the

, New England landscape and ap-

parently went through life with-
out ever connecting the omni-
present ovenbird with its song.

Today anyone who cares can ‘

quickly become in one sense a
far better naturalist than Tho-
reau was. Putnam’s “Handbook”
series and Houghton, Mifflin’s
expanding “Fieldbook” series
cover the principal divisions of
the animal, vegetable and min-
eral so thoroughly and with

more specialized books-msuch as
Clifford Pope’s recently pub-
lished “The Reptile World" and
Ivan Sanderson’s equally new
“Living Mammals of the World”
with its more than 300 stunning
pictures.

Or perhaps you want to know
about the Southwestern deserts,
in which case there is Paul
Howe’s “The Giant Cactus For-

- est and Its World" published

only a little over a year ago.
Possibly even more impressive
as an evidence of wide diffusion
is the new series of paper-

as “Golden Regional Guides"

interested in any works of na-
ture except those classified as
but this new series
devotes major attention to the
plants and animals the traveler
is likely to come across. At
another extreme there is the
handsome, ambitious and aston-

. ishingly good “The World We

Live In,” which Life magazine
serialized and Simon & Schuster
have published as a book. Also,
only a-few weeks old is “Wild
America” by Roger Tory Peter— .
son and James Fisher, which is
probably the finest account
ever written of a naturalist’s
tour of the American Continent
from Newfoundland to Mexico,
to Alaska.

PERHAPS there is no contem-
porary “nature writer" who is
as widely known as John Bur-
roughs was, but Burroughs had
the artificial advantage of pub- ,
licity from Theodore Roosevelt,
Thomas Edison and Henry Ford
so that however widely he was
read he was certainly even
more widely bought. On the

other hand there are perhaps ,

half a dozen present day Amer- f
icans every one of whom is far
better known than Thoreau was
in his day or than any previous
American naturalists except
Audubon, Burroughs and pos-
sibly John Muir were in theirs. '

To list them would be invidious
but a list would certainly in-

clude Edwin Way Teale, whose .-

,“North With the Spring” and}
“Circle of the Seasons” are
notable; the late Allan Devoe;
and the Canadian N. J. Berrill,
whose “Sex and the Nature of

gist’s knowledge with the sense

of wonder and love which make ‘

a “nature writer.” Devin-Adair’s

1y read and admired than even

peace-of-mind books usually
are. '

As to the “why” of this grow-
ing interest one man’s guess is
perhaps as good as another but
the new stress on popular nat—

éiﬁl-ehistory seems to indicate
an increased interest in animals
and birds for their own sakes.
Audubon was told by a prosper-
ous American to whom he tried
to sell his work that the gentle-
man in question would not give
that much for all the birds of
America alive and kicking much
less for pictures of them, but
there are today obviously more
and more people with a differ-
ent attitude. What Will Cuppy
called “sparrow distinguishing,”
or the ability to tell one species
of sparrow from another seemed
to be, he said, “hereditary in
certain old New England fam-
ilies.” Nowadays it seems to be
becoming an acquired charac-
teristic pretty much throughout
the land.

The most obvious explanation
of the growing interest is sim-
ply that it accompanies the

trend toward suburban living.

and the “summer place” in the
country, The experience of the
City‘dweller today is less likely
to be 'mlusively urban than it

used to be and a conscious in-
tellectual interest in nature is
perhaps commoner in those 'who
have always taken it for grant-
ed. But why the trend toward
the suburbs or the country
place? Since the days of Rome
it seems usually to have accom- '
panied the maturing of an
urban civilization as though a
race which had broken with the
land inevitably began to experi-
ence a sort of nostalgia for it.

IN part that is no doubt merely

~a desire to escape from the ob— ‘

vious irritations of noise and
crowds. There are always many
who like to get away from the
city temporarily without in
any significant way getting into
the country. They carry their
usual interests and amusements
with them merely moving the
scene of their card games and
their cocktail parties from one
place to another. But there are
also many who find new atti-
tudes as well as new interests.
The nature book is an obvious
aid to the cultivation of these
new interests. Its popularity
may even be . sign that there
is a spiritua ‘ _ a mer ~

MAN IS THE ENEMY

A noted writer warns: conservation is not enough

By JOSEPH WOOD KRUTCH

()RALISTS often blame races and nations because
they have never learned how to live and let live.
In our time We seem to have been increasingly aware of
how persistently and brutally they undertake to eliminate
one another. But it is not only the members of his own
kind that man seems to want to push off the earth. When
he moves in, nearly everything else that lives suffers from
his intrusion —— sometimes because he wants the space it
occupies and the food it eats, but often simply because
when he sees a creature not of his kind or a man not of
his race, his ﬁrst impulse is “Kill it.”

Even in the desert, where space is cheaper than in
most places, the wild life grows scarcer and more secretive
as the human population grows. The coyote howls
farther and farther away. To almost everything except
man, the smell of humanity is the most repulsive of all
odors, the sight of man the most terrifying of all sights.
Biologists call some animals eryptozoie, that is to say,
“leading hidden lives.” As the human population in-
creases, most animals develop cryptozoic habits; the deer
is a good example of this development. Even now there
are more wild animals around than we realize. They see
us when we do not see them; and it is because they have
seen us that we do not see them. Albert Schweitzer re-
marks somewhere that we owe kindness even to an insect,
when we can afford to' show it, just because we ought to
do something to make up for all the cruelties, necessary as
well- as unnecessary, which we have inflicted upon almost
the whole of animate creation.

Probably not one man in ten is capable of understand-
ing such moral and aesthetic considerations, much less of
permitting his conduct to be guided by them. But per-
haps twice as many, though still far from a majority, are
beginning to realize that the reckless devastation of the
earth has practical consequences. They are beginning to
hear at least about “conservation,” even though they are
not even dimly aware of any connection between it and
a large morality and are very unlikely to suppose that it
does or could mean anything more than looking after
their own welfare.

Hardly more than two generations ago, Americans
ﬁrst woke up to the fact that their land was not inex-
haustible. Every year since then, more and more has been
said, and at least a little more has been done, about “con-

serving resources,” about “rational use,” and about such
reconstruction as seemed possible. Scientists have studied
the problem, public works have been undertaken, laws
passed. Yet everybody knows that the using up still goes
on, perhaps not so fast nor so recklessly as once it did,
but still at a steady pace. And there is nowhere that it
goes on more nakedly, more persistently, or with a fuller
realization of what is happening than in the desert re-
gions where the margin to be used up is narrower.

First, more and more cattle were set to grazing and
overgrazing land from which the scanty rainfall now ran
off even more rapidly than before. Then more outrage-
ously, large areas of desert shrub were uprooted to plant
cotton and other crops which were watered ’by wells
tapping underground pools of water, now demonstrably
shrinking fast because they represent years of accumula-
tion which can be exhausted even more rapidly than an
oil well. Everyone knows that this water supply will
give out before long— very soon, in fact, if the number
of wells which draw on it continues to increase as it has
been increasing. Soon dust bowls will be where was once
a sparse but healthy desert; and man, having uprooted,
slaughtered, or driven away everything which lived
healthily and normally there, will himself either abandon
the country or die.

that Is the Underlying Cause?

To the question of why men will do or are permitted
to do such things, there are many replies. Some speak of
population pressures, while others more bluntly discuss
unconquerable human greed. Some despair; some hope
that more education and more public works will, in the
long run, prove effective. But is there, perhaps, something
more, something different, which is indispensable? Is
there some missing link in the chain of education, law and
public works? Is there something lacking without which
none of these is sufficient?

After a lifetime spent in forestry, wild—life manage-
ment and conservation of one kind or another, after such
a lifetime during which he nevertheless saw his country
slip two steps backward for every one it took forward, the,
late Aldo Leopold pondered the question and came up
with‘an 'un‘usual answer which many people would dis-
miss as “sentimental” and be surprised to hear from a
“practical” scientiﬁc man. He published his article origi—
nally in the Journal of Forestry, but it was reprinted in
the posthumous volume A Sand County Almanac, where

 




 

it was giVen a seemingly neutral but actually very 'sig-
niﬁcant title, “The Land Ethic.” -

This is a subtle and original essay, full of ideas never
so clearly'expressed before, ”and seminal in the sense that
each might easily grow into a separate treatise. Yet the
conclusion reached can be simply stated. Something is
lacking; and because of that lack, education, law and
public works fail to accomplish what they hope to accom-
' plish. Without it, the high-minded impulse to educate, to
‘ legislate and to manage becomes as sounding brass or a
tinkling cymbal. And the thing which is missing is love,
some feeling for, as well as some understanding of, the
inclusive community of rocks and soils, plants and ani-
mals, of which we are a part.

A Sense of “Oneness” Is Needed

It is not, to put Mr. Leopold’s thoughts in different
words, enough to be enlightenedly selﬁsh in our dealings
wit-h the land. That means, of course, that it is 'nOt
enough for the farmer to want to get the most out of his
farm or for the lumberer to get the'most out of his
forest without considering agriculture and wood produc-
tion as a whole, both now and in the future. It‘lals'o means
more'than that; and enlightened selfishness cannot be the
occasion of that something else. This is partly because
enlightened selfishness cannot possibly be extended to in—
clude remote posterity — to children perhaps and to
grandchildren possibly, but not much beyond, because the
very idea of “self” cannot be stretched much further, and
some purely ethical considerations must operate if any-
thing does. And even that. is not all. The wisest, the
most enlightened, the most remotely long-seeing exploita-

tion of resources is not enough, for the simple reason that ‘ ‘
the whole concept of exploitation is so false and so lim-.

ited that in the end it will defeat itself and the earth will
have been plundered, no matter/how scientifically and
farseeingly the plundering has been done.

To live healthily and successfully on the land, we must
also live with it. We must be part not only of the human
community, but of the whole community , we must
acknowledge some sort of oneness not only With our
neighbors, our countrymen and our civilization, but also
with the natural» as well as the man-made community.
Ours is not only “one world” in the sense usually implied
by that term; it is also “one earth.” And without some
acknowledgment of that fact, men can no more live suc-
cessfully than they can if they refuse to admit the politi-
cal and economic interdependency of the various sectiOns

of the civilized world. It is not a sentimental but a‘

grimly literal fact that unless we share this terrestrial
globe with creatures other than ourselves, we shall not be
able to live on it for long.

You may, if you like, think of this as a moral law. But
if you are skeptical about moral laws, you cannot escape
the fact that this has its factual, scientiﬁc aspect which
the science of ecology is every day making clearer as
it demonstrates those more and more remote interde-

pendences which, no matter how remote they are, are I

crucial even for us.

Before even the most obvious aspects of the balance of

nature had been recognized, a greedy, self-centered man-
kind naively divided plants into the useful and the use—

less. In the same way it divided animalsi'n'to thOse which
were either “domestic” on the One hand or "“game” on
the other, and those which were called “Vermin”'and
ought to be destroyed. Thatwas the day When extermina-
tion of whole species was taken as a matter of course and
random intrOductions, which usually proved to be either
complete failures or all too successful, were everywhere
being .made. Pretty soon, however, it became evident
enough that to rid the world of vermin and to stock it
with nothing but useful organisms was at least not a
simple task if you assume that “useful” means simply
“immediately useful to man.”

Even to this day the ideal nevertheless remains the
same for most people. They may know, or at least they
may have been told, that what looks like the uSeless is
often remotely but demonstrably essential. Out in this
desert country they may see the land being rendered use-
less by overuse. They may have heard that when the
mountain lion is killed off, the deer multiply; that when

'the deer multiply, the new growth of trees and shrubs is

eaten away; and that when the hills are denuded, a farm
or a section of grazing land many miles away is washed
into gullies and made incapable of supporting either man'
or any other of the large animals. They may even have
heard how the wonderful new insecticides proved so effec-
tive that fish and birds'died of starvation; that on at
least one Paciﬁc island, insects had to be reintroduced to
pollinate the crops , that when you almost completely‘kill
off a destructive pest, you run the risk of starving out
everything which preys upon it and thus run the risk that
the pest itself will stage an overwhelming comeback be-
cause its natural enemies are no more. Yet, knowing all
this and much more, their dream. is still the dream‘that
an earth for the use of man alone can be created if only
we learn more and scheme more effectively. They still
hope that nature’s scheme of checks and balances, which
provides for a varied population, in Which she stubbornly-
refuses to scheme only from man’s point of View and
cherishes the weeds and vermin as persistently as she
cherishes him, can be replaced by a scheme of his oWn
devising. Ultimately he hopes he can beat the game. But
the more the ecolOgist learns, the less likely it seems that
man can in the long run do anything of the sort.

”Trouble ﬂwaits the Conqueror

”Nature’s social union” is not the purely gentle thing
which Burns imagined. In fact it is a balance, with all
the stress and conﬂict which the word implies, and not a

“social union” at all. But it is, nevertheless, a workable,
seesawing balance. And when it ceases to seesaw, there
is trouble ahead for whatever is on the end that stays .up-

For every creature there is a paradox at the heart of
the necessary “struggle for existence” and the paradox is
simply this: Neither man nor any other animal can afford
to‘triumph in that struggle too completely. Uncondi-
tional surrender is a self-defeating formula —-— even in
the war against insect pests. In nature as elsewhere, “to

the victor belong the spoils” — but for a time only. When
there are no more spoils to be consumed, the victor dies.

That is. believed by some to be what happened to the
dominant carnivorous dinosaurs many millions of years,

 




ago. They became too dominant, and presently there was
nothing left to dominate -— or to eat. It IS certainly what
happens to other creatures like the too-protected deer who
multiply so successfully that their herds can no longer be
fed; or, more spectacularly, like the lemmings who head
desperately toward a new area to be exploited and end
in. the cold waters of a northern sea because the new area
does not exist.

What is commonly called “conservation” will not work
in the long run, because it is not really conservation at all
but rather, disguised by its elaborate scheming, a more
knowledgeable variation of the old idea of a world for
man’s use only. That idea is unrealizable. But how can
man be persuaded to cherish any other ideal unless he
can learn to take some in‘tereest and some delight in the
beauty and variety of the world for its own sake, unless
he can see a “value” in a ﬂower blooming or an'animal
at play, unless he can see some “use” in things not useful?

In'our sOciety we pride ourselves upon having reached
a point Where We condemn. an individual whOse Whole
aim in life is to acquire, material wealth for himself.
'But his vulgarity is only one step removed from that of
a society which takes no thought for anything except in-
creasing the material wealth of the community. In his
usual extravagant way, Thoreau once said: 'llThis curi-
ous world which we inhabit is more wonderful than it
is convenient; more beautiful than it is useful; it is
more to be admired than it is to be used.” Perhaps that
“more” is beyond what most people could or" perhaps
ought to be convinced of. But Without some realization
that “this curious world” is at least beautiful as well as
useful, conservation is doomed. We must._live for some-
thing besides making a living. If we do not permit the
earth to produce beauty and joy, it will in the end not
produce food either.

The I mpractical “Practical” View

Here practical considerations and those which are
commonly called “moral," “aesthetic” and even “senti—
mental" join hands. Yet even the enlightened Depart-
ment of Agriculture is so far from being fully enlightened
that it encourages the farmer to forget that his land can
eVer produce anything except crops and is fanatical to
the point of advising him how to build fences so that a
field may be plowed to the last inch Without leaving even
a narrow margin within which one of thetwi‘ld ﬂowers
—many of which agriculture has nearly rendered extinct
—may continue to remind him that the world is beautiful
as well as useful. And that brings us around to another
of Aldo Leopold’s seminal ideas: I

Conservation still proceeds at a snail’s pace;.

the usual answer . .. is “more conservation”
But is it certain that only the volume of education
needs stepping up? Is something lacking in content
as well? . . . It is inconceivable to me that an ethi-
cal relation, to land can exist without love, respect
and admiration for land, and a high regard for its
value. By value, I of course mean something far
broader than mere economic value; I mean value
in the philosophical sense.

.Here in the West, as in the country at large, a war
more or less concealed under the guise of a “conﬂict of

interest” rages between the “practical” conservationist
and the defenders of national parks, between cattlemen
and lumberers on the one hand and “sentimentalists” on
the other. The pressure to allow the hunter, the
rancher or the Woodcutter to invade the public domain
is constant, and the plea is.-always that we should “use”
what is assumed to be useless unless it is adding to mater-
ial welfare. But unless somebody teaches love, there can

be no ultimate protection to what is lusted after.

The Danger in Too Much Success

Any fully matured science of ecology will have to
grapple with the fact that man, from the ecological point
of View, is one of those animals which is in danger
from a too successful participation in the Struggle for
existence. He has upset the balance of nature to a point
where he has-exterminated hundreds of other animals
and has exhausted soils. Part of this he calls a demon-
stration of his intelligence and of the success which results
from his use of it. Becauseof that intelligence he has
learned how to exploit resources very thoroughly, and he
is even beginning to learn how to redress the balance in
certain minor ways. But he cannot keep indeﬁnitelyone
step ahead of overcrowding and starvation; and from
the standpoint of nature as a whole, he is both a threat
to every other living thing and, therefore, a threat_,_§to-
himself also. If he Were not so extravagantly successful,
it would be better for nearly everything except man,‘ and
therefore possibly better in the longest run for him also.
He has become the tyrant Of the earth, the waster of its
resources, the creator of the most prodigious imbalance in
the natural order which has ever existed.

From a purely homocentric point ,of View, this may
seem entirely proper. To most people it undoubtedly
does. Is it not our proudest boast that we have learned
how to “control nature”? 'Does not our dream of’the
future include a final emancipation from any dependence
upon a natural balance and the substitution for it of
some balance established by ourselves-and in our exclusive
interest? Is not that, in fact, what most people have in
mind when they think of the ﬁnal triumph of humanity?

Most would also go one step further and claim that
we have every reason in experience to believe that this
final triumph is possible. Has not all civilization been a
closer and closer approach to it? Is not, indeed, the
closeness of the approach the very measure of the degree
of civilization? And if it is, then how can anyone even
hint at the desirability'of calling a halt? Could any halt
possibly be called which would not be the beginning of a
retreat back to the primitive? '

Yet the fact remains that to all things there is a limit,
that “progress” cannot continue indefinitely in one
straight line. The growth of cities was, for instance,
certainly essential to the development of civilization; but
does that necessarily mean that cities should get greater
and greater—that the bigger the city, the higher the civil-

ization which it makes possible? Many would agree that

it. does not. Some might go on to suggest that the “con-
trol of nature” is itself something to“ which there are
limits, that the control can never be absolute, that nature
allows. us only a certain length of rope, that in the long
run it will'appear that no complete emancipation from

 




her rule is possible, that man’s ability‘to “control nature”
is something to which limits are ‘set. 'If he insists upOn
’ trying to go beyond those limits, nature will have the
last word.

The more completely we bring nature “under control,”
the more complicated our methods must become, the more
disastrous the chain reaction set up by any failure of wis-
dom or watchfulness or technique. We are required to
know more and more, and we are always threatened by
the impossibility of achieving adequate knowledge, much
less adequate wisdom and virtue.

Can We Really Control Nature?

Every increase in the complexity of organization has
made the situation more precarious at the same time
that it has increased our comfort, our wealth and our
short-term safety. Until we learned to support a popula-
tion far larger than we would have believed possible a
century ago, there was no danger of general starvation,
however disastrous and common local famines might have
been. Although Malthus was certainly wrong in his esti-
mates, it is by no means certain that he was wrong in
his general principle. Until we increased the wealth of
nations by linking them one with another, we were not
exposed to the danger of a world—wide economic collapse.
Until we learned how to “control” the atom, there was
no danger that atomic phenomena would actually get out
of control, and hence it is still not clear whether we are
running the machines or the machines are running us.
Thus we now have three tigers by the tail—the economic,
the physical and the biological; and three tigers are three
times as dangerous as one. We cannot let any of them
go. But it is not certain that we can hang on to all of
them indefinitely. lVIany a despot has discovered that it
was 'just when his power seemed to have been made abso-
lute that the revolution broke out. And. it, 111ay be that
just about three hundred years were necessary to expose
the fallacy of the ideal ~born during the seventeenth
centUry. Perhaps nature cannot really be Controlled after
all.

If one is prepared to admit that there is a limit to the
extent to which we can exercise a biological control ex—
clusively in our own interest, then it is certainly worth-
while to ask how We might know when we are approach-
ing that limit. It would, of course. be too easy to reply
simply, “When man and society are obviously sick.”
Too many other explanations of the sickness can be given,

and each can be made to seem more or less convincing;

indeed, several of them may each be partially correct.
But there is a criterion which it seems to me not wholly
fanciful to apply. blight it not have something to do
with nature’s own great principle of “live and let live”?
Nlight it not be that man’s success as an organism is
genuinely a success. so long, but only so long, as it does
not threaten the extinction of everything not useful to
and absolutely controlled by him, so long as that success
is not incompatible with the success of nature as the
varied and free thing which she is, so long as, to some
extent, man is prepared to share the earth with'others?

And if by any chance that criterion is valid, then either
one of two things is likely to happen. Either outraged
nature will violently reassert herself and some catas-

I

. trophe, perhaps the catastrophe brought about when more'

men are trying to live in our limited space than even
their most advanced technology can make possible, will
demonstrate‘the hollowness of man’s supposed success;
or man himself will learn in time to set a reasonable
limit to his ambitions and accept the necessity of recog—
nizing his position as that of the most highly evolved of
living creatures, but not one which entitles him to assume
that no others have a right to live unless they contribute '
directly to his material welfare.

But how can he learn to accept such a situation, to
believe that it is right and proper, when the whole ten-
dency of his thought and his interest carries him in a
contrary direction? How can he learn to value and de-
light in a natural order larger than his own order? How
can he come to accept, not sullenly but gladly, the neces-
sity of sharing the earth? ‘

As long ago as the seventeenth century—as long ago,
that is, as the very time when the ambition to ”control
nature” in any large way was first coming to be formu-
lated and embraced—a sort of answer to these questions
was being given in theological terms. John Ray, one of
the first great English biologists, formulated them in a
book which was read for a hundred years; and they cut
two ways, because what Ray had to say was directed
against the egotism of man as expressed both by the old—
fashioned theologians who thought that everything had
been made for man’s use and by the Baconians who
assumed that he could at least turn it to that use.

“It is,” Ray wrote, “a general received opinion, that all
this visible world was created for lV’Ian; that Man is the
End of Creation; as if there were no other end of any
creature but some way Or other to be serviceable to man

.But though this be vulgarly received yet wise men
l]0\\-a-(‘l€1_\.\ think otherwise. Dr. Moore afﬁrms, That
creatures are made to enjoy themselves as well as to
serve us.” The greatest profit which we can get from the
observation and study of other living things is, he went
011 to say, often not that we learn how to use them but
that we may contemplate through them the wonders and
the beauties of God’s creation. What Ray was saying
is precisely what Thoreau was restating in secularized
form when he insisted that “this curious world which we
inhabit is more to be admired and enjoyed than it
is to be used.”

[Where the ﬂnsrwer May Be Found

Since our age is not inclined to be interested in theOlog— '
ical arguments, is is not likely to find Ray’s exposition a
sufficient reason for accepting gladly the continued exist-
ence on this earth of “useless” plants and animals occupy-
ing space which man might turn to his own immediate
profit. He is more likely to make at least certain conces-
sions in that direction as the result of absorbing what the
ecologist has to say about the impossibility of maintain-
ing a workable balance without a much more generous
view of what is “useful” and what is not. But it is not
certain that 011 that basis he will ever make quite enough
concessions, and it is entirely certain that ‘he will not
make them happily, will not find life pleasanter just be-
cause he makes them, unless he can learn to love and to
delight 1n the variety of nature.

A Warm, Firm Embrace

THE VOICE OF THE DESERT: A
Naturalist's Interpretation. By
Joseph Wood Krutch. illustrated.
223 pp. New York: William Sloane
Associates. $3.75.

By OLlVER LA FARGE

THE arid Southwest repels

people when first they lay
eyes on it. Those who know it
only as they hurry by car from
oasis to oasis never do find out
what it’s all about; those who
give it a second look find, to
their surprise, that it is fasci-
nating. Of all that great regiOn.
few parts are more desert, repel
more strongly, or later bind
more firmly than the southern
Arizona portion, land of the sa-
guaro cactus, the road runner
and the lizard.

In few other areas will the
visitor be more incredulous if
told that it teems with life, as it
does. It is this section that Jo—
seph Wood Krutch, naturalist.
critic and biographer, has taken
for his own, lived with and lov—
ingly studied. I do not know
whether anyone can ever con-
vey to those* who do not know
it the real character of the
Southwest. This book will in-
evitably be compared to Mary
Austin's vivid “Land of Little
Rain”; I wonder whether a.

reader who has never seen the
desert itself can look through

Mary Austin’s eyes, If the char—
acter can be conveyed, then.
next after Miss Austin’s very
different classic, this is the book
to do it.

Here is a naturalist who can
write, who loves the subjects of
his study and is not ashamed to
show his love: “On the brightest
and warmest days my desert is
most itself because sunshine and
warmth envelops everything in
its ardent embrace. Even when
outlanders complain that the
sun is too dazzling and too hot,
we desert lovers are prone to
reply, ‘At worst that is only too
much of a good thing.’ ”

“Winter is winter, even in the
desert,” writes Mr. Krutch.
“Most vegetation is pausing,
though few animals hibernate.
* * * For those who are getting
away from something rather
than learning to know a new
world, this is all very well. But
you can’t become acquainted

with the desert itself at that
time of year.” It is in April, he
continues, that the desert be-
gins to come into its own. “The
air and the skies are summery
without being hot; the roadsides
and many of the desert flats are
thickly carpeted with a profu-
sion of wildflowers such as only
California can rival. The desert
is smiling before it begins to
laugh, and October or Novem-
ber are much the same. But
June is the month for those who
want to know what the desert
is really like. That is the time
to decide once and for all if it
is, as for many it turns out t
be, ‘your country.’ ”

R. KRUTCH is one of many
thoughtful naturalists who are
no longer satisfied with purely
mechanistic thinking and are
refusing to be frightened by epi-
thets such- as “teleologist” or
“Lamarckianist.” Recognizing
that science, as a discipline, can
deal only with mechanics, in his
last chapter he develops an in-
teresting concept of “metabiol-
ogy” that may prove a real phil-
osophical contribution. “Metabi-
ology," he writes, “suggests that
since life itself is not complete-
ly explainable in merely physi-
cal terms, moral and esthetic
questions should be discussed in
connection with what we know
about living creatures without
any attempt to reduce such
questions to merely physical
terms * * * an approach which

recognizes that living things.

being radically different from
inanimate objects, are capable
of standards of value which
correspond to nothing in the
merely physical world.”

Also important, and arising
logically out of the preceding
whole, is his chapter on conser-
vation. In sum, this is a most
agr’eeable book that has, and
achieves, a real purpose.

Animals Live

E NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW

ones, toads and“ snails; the
others to more general topics ‘
like food-getting, the care of
offspring and the use of tools.

Though these do not sound
like very unusual topics the
chapters are so packed with
original observations and um
hackneyed information that
perhaps only those widely read
in current nature books will
realize how fresh they are. The
snail looks around corners with
its stalked eyes; the toad
breathing in its odd way; the
limpet finding its way back to
the exact spot on a spray-
washed rock which it has
grown its shell to fitm—all these
are small miracles which few
have observed and no one has
ever described more charmingly.
Like Gilbert White again, Mr.

, Gooch performs simple little

experiments which produce
surprising results. How does a
worm know that when it drags.
a leaf into its burrow it should
drag it small end first? Some
biologists have suggested that
perhaps the small end tastes
different. Mr. Gooch scatters
paper triangles over the ground
and they too are seiaed by the
small end. A worm is not
smart enough to distinguish
paper from leaf. But he is a
good enough geometer to dis-
tinguish the direction in which
the paper tapers.

A TTITUDES and generaliza-
tions are no less unhackneyed.
This, says the author, is biologi-
cally one world. Yet only man
knows that it is and most other
animals live in a universe al-
most completely discontinuous
with his. Committed neither to
mechanism nor to anthropo-
morphism, Mr. Gooch records
What he sees and he draws
from each incident what seems
to him the most probable con-
clusion. In recent years Eng-

land has been enjoying a re-

vival of serious interest in
natural history as distinguished
from laboratory biology, The
emphasis is on what Mr. Gooch
calls watching other animals
live, If everyone had his alert
eye, fresh' curiosity and simple
graceful style, the results of
such watching would be even
more proﬁtable than they usu-
ally are. The woodcuts also are
uncommonly attractive.
