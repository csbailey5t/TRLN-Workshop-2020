ADDRESS OF THE PRESIDENT.

 

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN :

In presenting to you my ﬁrst annual address as President
of this Society, I desire to express my deep appreciation of
the great responsibility and honor conferred, in placing me at
the head of this important institution of the City and State.

It shall be my aim to make the Society a power for good
and my administration worthy of the high standard set by the
Society’s illustrious fornder.

To bring the Society to a position commensurate with
its extraordinary police and governmental powers is not the
work of one man. 33y the concerted labor of its members only
can this desired end be accomplished; and I earnestly appeal
to you to lend me your zealous aid in this endeavor.

I shall conﬁne myself to a brief resume of the Society’s
operations during the past year.

Early in the year it was found that it would be necessary
to make stringent economies if the Society was to live within
its income, and how to do this and at the same time increase
the efﬁciency of the organization was a problem that had to
be carefully worked out. A study of the ﬁnancial report of
the Treasurer will show that the ﬁrst object has been quite
satisfactorily achieved. How well the second object has been
attained I will leave you to judge.

The Society’s publication, “Our Animal Friends,” was
discontinued with the May number. This magazine had been
conducted at a yearly loss of ten thousand dollars or more,
and while appreciating the beneﬁts of humane education and
the value of an ofﬁcial organ, the apparent advantage did not
seem to justify the expense, particularly at a time when there
was so much practical work to be done.

The printing department of the Society was also discon—
tinued and the plant sold for the same reason.

Curtailments have been made in every possible manner
not prejudicial to the best interests of the work, with a view
to strict economy. These retrenchments were effected with—
out impairment of efﬁciency, a readjustment of duties and
simpliﬁcation of methods making it possible for a reduced
ofﬁce force to successfully carry on the work, at an annual.
saving to the Society of nearly nine thousand dollars, which
has been used to employ seven additional special agents and
several more Shelter assistants.

I wish the friends of animals to feel that every penny they
give to our cause will be spent to the best possible advantage
and no waste be allowed.

A committee of the Board of Managers has the question
of the future disposition of the Headquarters property of the-
Society under consideration. The matter has been gone into

very thoroughly by the Board, and while it was not found
Wise to sell the property at this time, the opinion is unanimous

that the investment should be turned to more proﬁtable ac—
count. It is the intention to lease the upper ﬂoors not needed
for the work of the Society, thus bringing the cost of occu-
pancy down to a moderate rental value.

No drinking fountains for animals have been erected in
this city for the past two years or more, owing to the lack
of a design satisfactory to the Art Commission. This embargo
has fortunate-1y been removed. A friend authorized us to
offer a prize of ﬁve hundred dollars for the best design for a
bronze drinking fountain, and the one selected has met the
approval of the Art Commission, a number of splendid sites
have been chosen and approved, and the Society will be ready
to proceed with the erection, early in the~ spring, of as many
fountains as funds may provide for.

During the summer the Society maintained, at a consid—
erable expense, a bucket brigade of ﬁfty men, who supplied
refreshing drink and spray baths to thousands of horses. I

attribute the remarkably low mortality among the animals last
summer to this service.

The slippery streets of winter present a most serious prob—
lem. I have taken the matter up with the city authorities,
but with little success. None of the departments hold them-
selves responsible for the dangerous condition of the smooth
pavements, nor have they any appropriation for sanding to pre-
vent slipping. Determined to do what we could with the lim-
ited means at our disposal tomitigate the suffering of the
horses when the streets are slippery, we have, at our own
expense, had sand scattered on many of the more dangerous
grades below Forty—second Street whenever necessary; and
if the consent of the Board of Aldermen can be obtained,
will place receptacles for sand at various points, where the
material will always be available for scattering on slippery
surfaces.

I am happy to say that cordial relations exist between this
Society and all other organizations engaged in anti—cruelty
work. Our Society was ofﬁcially represented at the Conven—
tion of The American Humane Association at Chicago, and we
hope to take an active and prominent part in all future move-
ments tending to the good of the cause.

The large increase in membership during the year, and
particularly during the past few months, is most encouraging
as showing a renewed interest in the Society. During the
year 19.06, 272 members were elected, as compared with 178
for the year 1905.

It is a matter of regret that there are less than two thou-
sand names on the roll of members. This should be many
times larger, and I trust that those interested in the work will
strive to make new advocates to the cause and thereby swell
the membership, which means greater interest and more
revenue.

There has also been a most gratifying increase in dona-

tions, $15,081.21 being received in 1906 as against $4,508.80
for the previous year; another indication that public conﬁdence

 




8

 

is with the Society and that its methods and work are gene1 —
ally approved. .

Our real estate holdings and investments were never in
better shape. All property owned by the Society is now proﬁt—
ably rented, and our investments have been carefully selected
by a Committee composed of members of the Board of Mana-
gers. Our securities are lodged in a safe deposit vault to
which access can only be obtained by the Treasurer and Presi—
dent jointly. The accounts are audited by certiﬁed public ac—
countants, who report to the Board every month.

A written appeal has been made to the heads of all re—
ligious denominations, urging the necessity for an effort on the
part of religious teachers to enlighten and quicken the public
conscience with regard to man’s duty to animals; and asking
for the united action of religious societies to the end that a
certain Sunday in the autumn of each year shall be set apart
and known as “Kindness to Animals Sunday,” when there
shall be preached in all churches and other places of worship
sermons urging the importance of kindly consideration for
the rights and protection of all dumb animals entrusted to
our care.

A “humane calendar” has been issued and distributed by
the Society, and a large number of posters calling attention to
the laws. enacted for the protection of animals and conveying
warnings: against overloading and other acts of cruelty, have
been displayed in a. manner to do most good. Other printed
matter of an educational character and literature appertaining
to the work of the Society has been published and gratuitously
circulated.

The amendments to the by—laws adopted by the Board of
Managers will, I trust, be further approved and ratiﬁed by the
members of the Society at the annual meeting.

The alterations provide for a Board of Managers of twenty-
one members, classiﬁed by lot into three classes, each of which
shall consist of seven members. The term of ofﬁce of one
class will expire each year. There shall also be a President,

 

 

 

 

 

w...» ._.-.~_._

a Vice—President, a Secretary and a Treasurer, to serve for
one year or until their successors are elected.
‘ Attention is called to the large amount of ﬁnes imposed
and collected in cases of cruelty—$6,339.88 in 1906 as com—
pared with $5,545 in the previous year. The Society happily
enjoys the respect, conﬁdence and support of the courts, the
district attorneys and other public ofﬁcials whose co—operation
is necessary to the successful prosecution of our work.
Following are statistics of the work accomplished in 1905
and 1906:

1905 . 1906

Arrests and prosecutions ............ 811 784
Animals suspended from labor ........ 5,976 6,503
Horses, mules and other large animals,

disabled past recovery, humanely

destroyed ...................... 4,032 3966
Small animals, homeless or disabled past

recovery, humanely destroyed. . . . 97,789 100,588
Disabled horses and other large animals

removed from the streets in am-

bulances ....................... 81 5 905
Complaints of cruelty received and in-

vestigated ...................... 6,080
Calls made for unwanted, sick and in-

jured animals .................. 44,635

It will be seen that there was a slight falling off in the
number of arrests made in 1906 as compared with the previous
year. If the ﬁgures are to be taken as reﬂecting the activity
of the Society, the showing is a good one. As the title of the
Society indicates, its work is, so far as possible, of an allevia—
tive- and corrective character, and it seeks always to prevent the
commission of an act of cruelty rather than the apprehension
of the offender after the act. It naturally follows that the
greater the vigilance exercised the fewer will be the overt
acts of cruelty justifying arrest and prosecution.

 




 

11

in different parts of the State, with jurisdiction over territory
not heretofore ofﬁcially represented.

I rejoice that a few members of the Society, whose devo—
tion to the cause is well known, have taken the initiative in
the formation of a VVoman’s Auxiliary. The plan has the cor-
dial approval of the Board and the ofﬁcers of the Society, who
will heartily co—operatc with these ladies and do everything in
their power to aid them. Among the objects which the
\V'oman’s Auxiliary hopes to accomplish may be mentioned the
organization of the children of the city, who will be interested
in furthering the aims of the Society, and the establishment of
yearly parades of draught and cab horses, such as are held,
with great success, in London and some American cities.

The Shelter work of the Society—the rescue of homeless,
sick and injured dogs and cats—has been vigorously carried
on, and a large number of unwanted animals which would
otherwise have been turned into the street to die of starvation
or exposure, have been taken to the Shelters, and many of
them placed in good homes.

It is the intention of the Society the coming year to estab—
lish a home for horses and other animals somewhere in the
country near New York, and to endeavor to procure legisla—
tion permitting the Society to take charge of the old ﬁre and
police horses of the city, which, after long years of faithful
service, are now by law compelled to be sold at public auction,
usually for a few dollars, and then go into the hardest kind of
work. Owners will also be able, for a reasonable considera—
tion, to provide for their old and faithful animals. This will
be one of the new activities of the Society which will be
taken up early this coming year.

The evil of over—checking has received the earnest atten—
tion of the Society, and, in a crusade which has only just begun
and which will be vigorously and fearlessly continued, many
owners and drivers have been warned and compelled to relieve
their horses.

A careful watch has been kept over the stock yards, which

 




 

 

 

 

12

are visited by our agents daily; slaughter houses are regularly
inspected and humane treatment and methods. enforced; agents
are on duty at the several horse markets on sales days and
many horses, incapacitated beyond recovery, have been merci—
fully destroyed; the live poultry markets are under the sur—
veillance of the Society’s agents, Who insist upon proper treat—
ment of the fowls and that they be conﬁned and transported
in crates conforming to the Society’s requirements; stables
have been inspected, and, with the co—‘operation of the Board
of Health, proper sanitation required. Ferries, cab stands,
markets, public dumps, general post ofﬁce and sub—stations, and
other places where horses are used, are systematically visited
by the agents by day and by night. Proposed ﬁghts between
animals have been prevented by the vigilance of our agents,
and exhibitions in which domesticated and wild animals have
been exposed to unjustiﬁable abuse or danger, have been pro-
hibited, and arrests made when the circumstances warranted.

In calling attention to the Society’s need of money to carry
on and extend its work, I wish to make it clear that the Society
does not derive the large proﬁt from dog license fees that
has been attributed to it, for on referring to the accountants’
statement, it will be seen that the license fees exceeded the
cost of maintaining this single department by less than $4,000,
as compared with a deﬁcit of $953.01 in 1905.

It has taken time to inaugurate the new methods and ideas
. which now prevail .in the Society, and much yet remains to
be done the coming year. Let us all work together for the
prosperity and usefulness of our Society, and to gain for it the
conﬁdence and approval of all.

ALFRED WAGSTAFF,
President.

In addition to the above mentioned income, the following
Bequests, received during the year, were reserved and added to the
Society’s assets:

From Estate of Lyman W. Case ....... $650.00
“ “ Elizabeth Y. Wright. . . . 1,107.85
“ “ Josephine Schaller ...... 475 .00

It will be seen by the above statement that the excess of
expenses over income for the year 1906 was $15.08; while for

the year 1905 the expenses exceeded the income by $24,095.00-

During the past year a new and very complete system Of
bookkeeping has been inaugurated by and under the direction
of the Society’s ofﬁcial accountants, Messrs. Haskins and
Sells, who have audited and veriﬁed its accounts at the end
of each and every month, and have submitted their reports
thereon at the various meetings of the Board of Managers.
The subjoined statement handed in by them will show in
detail the various sources from which the Society’s income
was derived and on what accounts the disbursements were
made.

The present executive ofﬁcers unanimously deplore the fact
that so vast an amount of capital should be tied up in the
palatial ediﬁce which now constitutes the headquarters of the
Society. No subject has been given more thoughtful or pains—
taking consideration than this; both in the deliberations of the
Board of Managers, as well as by the Committee on Real
Estate appointed for the purpose of investigating this impor—
tant question. The best informed authorities on real estate as
well as the best architects in the city have been repeatedly con—
sulted on the questions of either the sale of the property or its
conversion into an income producing investment, through
necessary alterations and the letting in whole or in part for
business occupancy.

Owing to the changes that are now taking place in this
section of the city and the probable large future enhancement
of values for business purposes, the Board of Managers ﬁnally
came to the conclusion that it would be unwise to sell the prop—
erty at the present time, at the great loss in capital that would
inevitably be involved in so doing, and have therefore author—
ized the letting or leasing of all but the two ﬂoors which are
essential for the Society’s requirements.

During the past year large sums of money have been ex-
pended to meet unpaid obligations which properly belonged to
the preceding ﬁscal years.

None of the present executive ofﬁcers of the Society receive

 

       




15

any salary or other emolument of any kind for their services;
the President, Mr. Alfred Wagstaff, performing the arduous
duties of that ofﬁce without compensation of any description
whatsoever.

The executive ofﬁcers of your Society have conscientiously
endeavored, by the practice of the most rigid economy in those:
directions which would not cripple the Society’s usefulness, to:
limit its expenditures to what may be regarded as its steady
sources of income. In a word, those fundamental principles,
which govern the best regulated business houses, have been
applied to the management of the Society’s affairs, and we-
sincerely trust that the results as shown by this report will".
receive the approval of all who feel an interest in the cause we:
represent.

We invite the closest investigation of our stewardship,
through the examination of our books and accounts not only
by members of the Society but by the public at large, and any
well-meant criticisms, whether adverse or otherwise, which.
may result in the advancement of the cause or tend to pro-
mote the welfare of the Society, will not only receive careful
consideration but be gratefully appreciated.

To the members of the Society, as well as the public at large,
who have so generously contributed in aid of the work of
Animal Protection during the past year our grateful apprecia—
tion is hereby extended.

Respectfully submitted,
HENRY BERGH,

Treasurer.

attempted such a business he would be arrested and prose~
cuted. He declared he would give up the project. The argu-
ment was made that chameleons do not come under the deﬁni—
tion of the word animal, but Section 669 of the Penal Code
declares the word, as used in the statutes, does not include the
human race, but includes every other living creature, and the-
legal deﬁnition of the word cruelty is, “any act whereby un-
justiﬁable physical pain, suffering or death is caused or per—
mitted.” Several persons found selling chameleons were
prosecuted by the Society’s agents, and when brought to trial
before the Court of Special Sessions sentence was suspended
on the ground that the offenders were ignorant foreigners and

not familiar with the law.

For beating a prostrate horse over the head and body with
the butt end of a whip, the animal having fallen on the slip—
pery pavement, Joseph Carmichel was arrested by a Special
Agent of the Society and arraigned before City Magistrate
Joseph Pool of the Fifth District Court and held in $500 bail
for trial at the Court of Special Sessions. Justice Deuel,
McAvoy & Olmsted of the Court of Special Sessions, First
Division, convicted Carmichel of cruelty to animals and sen—
tenced him to pay a ﬁne of $25.00 with an alternative of ten

(lays’ imprisonment.

Assisted by Police Ofﬁcers Stafford and Keyes of the Forty—-
sixth Precinct, a Special Agent of the Society interfered in
a dog ﬁght which was taking place in the yard at 12 Garﬁeld
Place, Brooklyn. Those who were witnessing the ﬁght caught
sight of the ofﬁcers and agent climbing the fence which sur—
rounded the yard and dispersed in every direction. The pro—
motor of the ﬁght, however, and four of the witnesses were
arrested and arraigned before City Magistrate Furlong of the
Third District Court, who held each of them in $500 bail for
trial at the Court of Special Sessions. Justices Wilkin, Forker
and Keady of the Court of Special Sessions, Second Division,
sentenced two of the offenders (Joseph Christiano and Tony

Sylvester, the principals) to pay a ﬁne of $50 each or be i111-
prisoned ﬁfty days. In each of the other cases. a ﬁne of $10.00
was imposed, in default of payment to serve ﬁve days in the

city prison. The dogs were turned over to the Society by order
of the Court.

Charles Maxwell, of Howe’s Cave, N. Y., was arrested
by the Special Agent of the Society at that place for promot-
ing a ﬁght between two dogs. When arraigned before Justice
of the Peace Wallace Sidney, Maxwell pleaded guilty, and in
afﬁdavit implicated four others, for whom the justice issued
warrants, and arrests followed. Convictions were secured in
all the cases and ﬁnes ranging from $10 to $20 were imposed,
and in one instance a sentence of twenty days’ imprisonment
in Schoharie County Jail was imposed.

For working a horse having a sore 4X2 inches on the
nigh front leg and two on the nigh hind leg 4 X 3 and 2 X 2%
inches, under the breeching, Sam Rosenkrantz was arrested by
Ofﬁcer McGinly of the Third Sub-Precinct. When arraigned
before City Magistrate Leroy B. Crane, of the Fifth District
Court, the defendant Was held in $200 bail for trial at the
Court of Special Sessions, First Division. In the latter court
the defendant was sentenced to imprisonment for ﬁve days by
Justices Olmsted, Zeller and McKean.

For over—driving and whipping a horse until it fell fr01n
exhaustion, Charles Burns, of Cooperstown, N. Y., was ar—
rested by the Society’s agent at that place. When arraigned

HISTORY.

 

Prior to the enactment of the statute entitled “An Act to
Prevent the Cruel and Improper Treatment of Cattle,” intro—
duced in England in July, 1822, by the late highly esteemed
Mr. Martin, the general treatment of animals in all countries
of the world was inhuman.

" “Whether from ignorance, thoughtlessness, heedlessness,
0r wanton brutality, animals were subjected to extreme pain
and torture, and their condition failed to excite the commiser-
ation of the public. The best classes of society contained a few
persons only who openly protested against this cruelty, while
the majority were engaged in divers pastimes that caused much
animal suffering, and regarded with scorn and indignation
any appeal made to them in favor of the brutes. Naturally, the
lower and lowest orders were therefore more or less insensible
to the claims of lower animals; taking cue as well as example
from their betters, they also indulged in cruel sports and main—
tained a right in man to behave toward dumb domestic de—
pendents as he pleased. In fact, the protests of humane people
were silenced by ridicule which came from the platform, the
pulpit, and the senate, as well as from the galled pens of
satirists.

“No better instance can be quoted of the prevailing indiffer-
ence of men in even the highest social position to the feelings
of animals than the mocking treatment of the Peers when
Lord Erskine stood up in the House of Lords, in the early

*From the 74th Annual Report of the Royal Society, London.

part of the present century (1811), to ask for justice to the
lower creatures of God. Insensible alike to his moderate de-
mands and appeals for compassion and mercy to all defenceless
animals that man had pressed into his service, the chamber
broke out into open derision when he argued in favor of their
rights to humane treatment. It is said that loud jeers, vulgar
ejaculations, indeco-rous demeanor, and even whistling and
cock—crowing were practically the only reply given to the grand
speech of this high-souled man. No wonder, therefore, that
the man in the street ridiculed also, and that callous coachmen
and other persons vented their unrestrained passions on animals
without let or hindrance. The public records of eighty years
ago certainly do show that the friends of the brutes were few,
and their foes many and cruel.

“The most reckless and savage punishment, and the most
disgusting disregard to the bodily sufferings of animals, were
exhibited unconcealed in the highways and streets daily; fester—
ing sores, discharging wounds, excruciating lameness, and tot-
tering inﬁrmity called not forth modern devices to- evade public
reprobation, and without disguise the lash and goad worked
their bloody inﬂictions. The uncombined efforts of a few
benevolent individuals were no check to these evils; and hence
it became necessary to establish a society which should unite
the friends of. dumb animal creatures.

“The founders of this Society met on the 16th of June, 1824,
and inaugurated the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, appointed alcommittee, and conceived the following
plan of operations:

The circulation of suitable tracts gratuitously, or by cheap sale,
particularly among persons intrusted with cattle, such'as coach-
men, carters, and drovers.

The introduction into schools of books calculated to impress on
youth the duty of humanity to inferior animals.

Frequent appeals to the public through the press, awakening more
general attention to a subject so interesting, though too much
neglected.

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

 

106

its origin. The history of the Society, therefore, is practically
an account of the inception and development of the work of
animal protection in America.

In I862 Mr. Bergh was appointed Secretary of Legation at
St. Petersburg. While in Russia he fOund himself on several
occasions constrained to interfere in cases of atrocious cruelty,
and but for his ofﬁcial position he would have been exposed to
personal violence. His attention was thus directed to the sub—
ject of humanity to the brute creation, and while in London
on his way home in 1865, he made the acquaintance of John
Colam, Esq, Secretary of. the Royal Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals, who gave him much valuable informa—
tion concerning the operations of that Society in England,
On Mr. Bergh’s arrival at home, he found that no similar
society existed in this country, and he immediately devoted.
himself to the establishment of a society for the United States. -
At the outset the proposition met with little encouragement,
and, without the assistance of the press, it might probably have
failed. On February 8, I866, Mr. Bergh delivered a lecture in
Clinton Hall, in which he pleaded his cause with such force of
argument and such warmth of eloquent conviction, that ex—
pressions of sympathy and offers of assistance were freely
made by persons in attendance. The press then lent its pow~
erful aid; the lecture was published in whole or in part in all
the great cities of the country; public sentiment in favor of
Mr. Bergh’s movement was quickly aroused, and on April 10,
1866, “The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals” was incorporated by the Legislature of the State
of New York. Among the original charter members of the
Society were many of? the most eminent citizens of the City
and State of New York.

On the 19th of April, in the same year, Mr. Bergh secured
the passage by the Legislature of New York of the ﬁrst law
ever enacted in this country for the protection of animals. . It
provided that “every person who shall, by his ,act or neglect,
maliciously kill, maim, wound, injure, torture, or cruelly beat:

 




 

107

any horse, mule, cow, cattle, sheep, or other animal, belonging
to himself or another, shall, upon conviction, he adjudged
guilty of a misdemeanor.

On the 22d of April a meeting was held in Clinton Hall for
the purpose of effecting a permanent organization, and at that
meeting the ﬁrst society for the protection of animals in this
country came into active existence. The purpose of the as—
sociation, as set forth in its constitution, was “to provide ef—
fective means for the prevention of cruelty to- animals through-
out the United States, to enforce all laws which are now, or
may hereafter be, enacted for the protection of animals, and
to secure, by lawful means, the arrest and conviction of all
persons found violating such laws.” As. a matter of fact, the
only law of that kind then to be found on the statute books of
the States of the Union was that which had been passed by
the Legislature of New York nine days after the incorporation
of the Society. Within twelve months, however, another “act
for the more effectual prevention of cruelty to animals” was
passed by the Legislature of the same State; and from time to
time additions have been made to it, so that there is now hardly
a phase of cruelty which the Society has not the legal power
to prevent within the boundaries of the State of New York.
The legal deﬁnition of the word “animal” now includes every
living creature except members of the human race, and the
words “torture” and “cruelty” include every act, omission, or
neglect whereby unjustiﬁable physical pain, suffering, or death
is caused or permitted.

ORGANIZATION OF OTHER SOCIETIES—PROGRESS OF THE
WORK.

The organization and influence of. The American Society
soon led to the establishment of local societies in all parts of
the Union and in other countries on the American Continent
and elsewhere. The number of local societies incorporated in

 

 

 

 

 

 

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1(8

the United States is now 244 and in other American nations
26 societies have been established and incorporated since 1866,
making a total of 270.

The prevention of cruelty to animals has been the beginning
of many other humane organizations. Thus, in 1874, the So-
ciety appeared as prosecutor in a case of cruelty to children,
and it then appeared to be advisable to organize a separate
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. This was
done in 1875, under the Presidency of 'Mr. John D. Wright;
Mr. Henry Bergh becoming Vice—President of the new so-
siety, the ﬁrst ofiits kind in the world, which has done so
much and such effectively good work in the last thirty—two

years.

The establishment of these and other organizations has rep—
resented an increased interest in humane work which has
found a practical expression in the legislation of nearly every
State in the Union. At this date there is. not a single State in
which cruelty of any kind is not forbidden by the law, under

stringent penalties for disobedience. Some defects continue
to exist of course; but, speaking broadly, it may be said that
the laws on this subject are good. What is now required is
that the great mass of the people shall be educated into sym—
pathy with the humanity of the law. That is now the greatest
work of the Society, and it has constant reason to be grateful
for the assistance and encouragement which it receives from
the press, the pulpit and the judges of the courts.

The abuses growing out of the then prevailing systems of
dog catching and impounding having become so ﬂagrant as
to demand immediate checking, a bill, entitled “An Act for

the better protection of lost and strayed animals, and for se—
curing the rights of the owners thereof,” was introduced into

the Legislature of 1894, providing for the abolishment of the
city dog pound, and empowering the Society to carry out the
provisions of the act. This bill became a law on March 8,
1894 (Chap. 115, Laws 1894), and the Society immediately
thereupon commenced the erection of a Shelter for Animals at

 




 

109

102d Street and East River, provided with every accommoda-
tion for the care of animals and their humane destruction. 1

In rescuing the community from the reign of the old dog'
catchers, the Society earned the gratitude of the dog owners
of New York, and in 1895, at the request of the Mayor of
Brooklyn, the law was amended (Chap. 412, Laws 1895) so as
to include that city as well. A Shelter was then established in
that city, at the corner of Malbone Street and Nostran‘d Ave~
nue, and when Staten Island became a part of the greater City
of New York, a Shelter was also opened on Wave Street
Stapleton, Borough of Richmond.

Much suffering has thus been spared the vagrant, lost, and
abandoned dogs and cats of the city. Unwanted animals are
no longer thrown into the streets, to suffer and die of expo-
sure and starvation, but are given into the care of the Society
and by it mercifully destroyed or placed in good homes.

Through the generosity of kind—hearted people interested in
the work of animal protection, the Society was enabled, in
1896-97, to rear a commodious ﬁreproof building as its perma—
nent Headquarters, adequate to the increased needs of the So-
ciety, and supplied with every facility for carrying on the work
to the best advantage.

Meanwhile the practical work is not neglected. The ofﬁcers
of the Society are clothed with ample police powers. They
wear a distinctive uniform and patrol the streets by day and
by night. They have full power to arrest and prosecute offend—
ers against the laws relating to animals. In addition to the
uniformed police, the Society has over two hundred special
agents in different parts of the State, clothed with the same
authority and engaged in enforcing the laws for the prevention
of cruelty. In the Boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn the
Society has ambulances for the removal of injured, sick, and
disabled animals; and appliances for the rescue of drowning
animals and animals which have fallen into excavations.

In addition to its permanent headquarters, Madison Avenue
and 26th Street, and the Shelters above mentioned, the Society

 

 

 

 

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

110

maintains an ambulance house at III East 22d Street,
New York, and an ofﬁce at 13 Willoughby Street, and an
ambulance house at 114 Lawrence Street, Brooklyn.

In the prosecution of its Work, the Society has in constant
use three large ambulances for the removal of disabled ani-
mals, and six smaller ambulances, two tricycle carriers and
two motor ambulances especially constructed for the removal
of sick, injured, and homeless small animals. Alarge corps
of men is employed in this service.

.mals,” provides as follows:

other places where police organizations exist, shall, as occasion
may require, aid the Society, its members, or agents in the en-
forcement of all laws which are now or may hereafter be enacted
for the protection of dumb animals.”

Section 668 of the Penal Code, as amended by Laws of 1888,
Chapters I44 and 490, provides:

“ * * * * =*‘ A constable or police ofﬁcer must, and
any agent or ofﬁcer of any of said societies may, arrest and bring

fending against any of the provisions of this title. Any ofﬁcer

the perpetration of any act of cruelty upon any animal in his pres-
ence. Any person who shall interfere with or obstruct any such

corporated societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals are
declared to be peace ofﬁcers within the provisions of Section 154
of the Code of Criminal Procedure.”

 




123

Section 432 of the Penal Code declares:

“A person who wilfully stops or obstructs the passage of any
ambulance or vehicle used for the transportation of sick or
wounded persons or animals upon any public street, highway, or
place, or who wilfully injures the same, or wilfully drives any
vehicle into collision therewith, is guilty of a misdemeanor.”

Your attention is especially called to the whole of Title XVI
of the Penal Code, containing Sections 655 to 669, inclusive,

relating to cruelty to animals.

Rule 55 of the Rules and Regulations of the Police Depart—

ment provides as follows:

p. The members of the. Force shall give efﬁcient aid to the
members and agents of “The American Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals,” in all lawful efforts to enforce the Laws
enacted for.the protection of dumb animals. It is their duty as
Policemen, in every case of cruelty to animals occurring in their
View or to which their attention shall be called by any person
Wilhng to make the charge, to promptly arrest the offending per-
son, and cause such person to be arraigned and prosecuted before
the proper Magistrate.

attempts to abandon any animal to die, and report all facts there-
Wltl‘l at the Statlon—house and to the above Society.

the Law. .

q. Every ambulance or other vehicle used for the transportation

bulance or vehicle thereon, or who shall wilfully injure the same,
or wilfully drive any vehicle into collision therewith, is guilty of a
misdemeanor.

Members of the Force shall, when called upon, aid the persons.

HOW TO PROCEED AGAINST OFFENDERS.

There are two modes of proceeding, viz.: I. By giving the
offender into the custody of a policeman, constable, or other

ofﬁcer. II. By the apprehension of the accused under a war—
rant.

I.

BY GIVING THE OFFENDER INTO THE CUSTODY OF AN OFFICER
AUTHORIZED To MAKE. ARRESTS.

When you personally witness an act of cruelty, call the
attention of an ofﬁcer to the nature of the offense, insist on the
arrest of the offender; if you cannot accompany the accused
to the magistrate, then give your name and address to the
ofﬁcer as a witness, and be sure to take his number, name, and
precinct, in order that you may compel attention to the case.
The law requires the police throughout this State to aid in the
protection of dumb animals from injury and abuse; and should
any ofﬁcer refuse his assistance—which is not likely to occur—-

then take the number on his hat or shield, and report the same
to the Society.

II.
BY TIIE ARREST OF TIIE ACCUSED UNDER WARRANT.
When you do not personally see the act of cruelty, or when
you can not procure an Ofﬁcer on the Spot, or if the ofﬁcer
refuses to act, then obtain the name and address of the

offender, and that painted on the vehicle, if any, and the names

and residences of those who witnessed the act, and lay the
facts before a magistrate.

 

 

 

 

  




   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
  
  
   

127

IN ALL CASES

Make a note of the time when, and the street or place where,
the offense occurred, and also the names and residences of all
persons present and of any others who may be called as wit-
nesses. If the offense was that of driving a horse or other
animal with galled neck or shoulders, or other wounds, note
the size and location of such wounds—especially if raw, dis—
charging, or in contact with the harness. If the offense was
ﬂogging or beating, note the instrument, the number of blows,
on what part of the body inﬂicted, and the effect, if any, on the
skin of the animal; if overloading, carefully observe the symp-
toms of distress, such as the trembling, falling, unusual perspi-
ration, or exhaustion. Report all cases of mutilation, such as
docking tails of horses, cutting tails or ears of dogs, or any
other torture; also cases of cruelty in the transporting of sheep,
calves, game, fowls, or other poultry, or animals, while bound
by the legs or otherwise, in any part of this State, either on
land or water. In every instance observe minutely and take
down in writing the facts and details, and also the language
of the offender at the time.

 

FINALLY.

Complaints or inquiries made to the Society at its head-
quarters, by night 07’ by day, will receive prompt attention; and
ALL ARRESTS FOR CRUELTY SHOULD BE. PROMPTLY REPORTED
THERE, To INSURE A PROPER PROSECUTION OF THE CASE.

 




 

 

 

 

 

STEEL GAS TANK FOR THE HUMANE
DESTRUCTION OF SMALL ANIMALS.

See Illustrations, page 50.

The dimensions of this tank are as follows: length, ten feet;
width, ﬁve feet, and height, four feet six inches. A trap-door
is provided through which the animals are put into the tank,
and four heavy plate—glass windows light the interior. Ordi—
nary illuminating gas is admitted through an inch and one-
quarter pipe, and when the tank is to be emptied escapes
through a six—inch pipe. As shown by the illustration on page
50, a truck or cage rests on the bottom of the tank on tracks,
the latter withdrawing from the tank so that the cage can be
moved outside to facilitate the handling of the bodies of dead
animals. I

The method of destroying small animals by illuminating
gas was adopted by the Society after a thorough investigation
of other known methods, and is to be recommended from
humane and sanitary standpoints. Illuminating gas produces
anaesthesia or insensibility, and death follows almost instan-
taneously and is absolutely painless. Charcoal fumes cause
asphyxia or suffocation, and the use of charcoal is not recom—
mended for that reason.

Fortunately, there were fewer hopelessly disabled horses
to be destroyed; but, for reasons beyond the Society’s power
to prevent, it was found necessary to destroy a larger number
of small animals. The idea of destroying so much animal life
is distasteful to us, but the physical condition of the animals
makes it necessary.

In this connection I am glad to be able to report that for
some time past all healthy dogs not claimed by their owners
have been placed in good homes, when possible, and it will be
our aim in the future, so far as may be, to destroy only such
animals as are injured or diseased past recovery.

The ambulances have been in greater demand, but this
does not necessarily mean that more horses have been injured
or taken sick on the streets. Owners and drivers are giving
their animals more consideration than in the past and the
ambulances are being used for the removal of injured or sick
horses where formerly the animals have been compelled to
walk to the hospital or stable.

Formerly all calls for the removal of sick and unwanted
animals were included in “cases investigated,” but this practice
has been discontinued and only complaints alleging cruelty are
now so entered.

In addition to the increase in number of Special Agents
attached to Headquarters and the Brooklyn Ofﬁce, the .force
of suburban salaried agents has. been increased by the em-
ployment of arepresentati‘ve for Rye and Port Chester, and
an agent is now assigned to Jamaica and vicinity. The force
on Staten Island has been added to by the appointment of an
agent residing at Tottenville. Paid agents are also maintained
at Yonkers, New Rochelle and White Plains. The citizens of
Rye and Port Chester very generously subscribed the ﬁrst
year’s salary of. an agent and pledged themselves to pay half
his salary for succeeding years. I beg to suggest that this
commendable action might be followed by other local towns
with great beneﬁt to animals.

During the year, thirty-six volunteer agents were appointed

 

 

 

 

  




 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

THE FOLLOWING ARE A FEW OF THE
CASES PROSECUTED DURING THE
‘ YEAR 1906.

The infamous crime of poisoning horses out of revenge
has been committed in several instances during the past year.
This is done so secretly that it is almost impossible to secure
the necessary evidence to convict the offender. In one instance
six horses were poisoned, so it is alleged, by a person hired
for the purpose, but while circumstances indicated who the
poisoner was there was no legal proof to warrant his convic-
tion. In one instance, however, the Society was. successful in
convicting one Joseph Fine for administering poison to two
horses, causing the death of one, the other being save-d by
prompt medical treatment. During the progress of the inves—
tigation one Jacob Arronson was arrested and charged with
hiring Joseph Fine to administer the poisonous drug. Fine
stated at the time of his arrest that he was asked by Arronson
to put a package of poison in each feed bag of horses belonging
to one Goltzman and promised $10.00 for doing so. At the
trial, however, Arronson denied this, and there being no cor—
robation of the charge he was discharged from custody. Fine
was seen to enter Goltzman’s stable and put a white substance
into the manger in front of each horse. He was convicted
and sentenced to imprisonment for one year in the King’s
County Penitentiary and to pay a ﬁne of $250.00, in default
of payment to serve one day for each dollar remaining unpaid.

In June one John Stewart came to Headquarters of the
Society to get permission to sell live chameleons at Coney
Island. He propose-d that these little creatures have a very
light chain fastened around their necks and be pinned to a board
from which they could be sold. He was informed that if he

4. The periodical delivery of discourses from the pulpit.

5. The employment of constables in the markets and streets; and

6. The prosecution of persons guilty of ﬂagrant acts of cruelty, with
publicity to the proceedings, and announcement of results.

“Steadily working by the above means, bravely bearing
contumely and overcoming difﬁculties, the founders became
stronger year after year: subscribers and co—workers gradually
joined their ranks; and a. marked improvement slowly mani—
fested itself in the treatment of animals. Then followed the
distinguished patronage of Her Most Gracious Majesty the
Queen, Her Royal Highness the late Duchess of Kent, the
Nobility, and many distinguished Members of both Houses of
Parliament; and in 1840, by command of. Her Majesty, the
Society was honored with the preﬁx of ‘Royal.’ Since that
period the progress has been regular, and its achievements en-
couraging, and now it is regarded as a permanently estab—
lished institution, which has outlived ridicule, and secured for
its founders the esteem of good and practical men of this and
succeeding generations.

“During many years the committee advocated the removal
and enlargement of Smithﬁeld Market. Owing to its agency,
bull—baiting, bull-running, cock—ﬁghting, badger—baiting, and
other wicked sports of a barbarous age have been prohibited
by legal enactments. In 183 5 the Society obtained an amend-
ment of Martin’s Act; in 1845 an amendment of the law for
regulating Knackers’ Yards; in 1849 a new and much im—
proved Act for the more effectual Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals; and in 1854 an Act prohibiting the use of dogs as
beasts of draft or burden throughout England; and recently
many other Acts of Parliament.”

The. ﬁrst society organized in America for the protection of
animals was The American Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals, its founder and ﬁrst president being the
late Henry Bergh, to whose noble self—sacriﬁces and untiring
energies the cause of animal protection in this country owes
