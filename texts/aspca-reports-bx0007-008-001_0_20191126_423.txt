FOR brutally beating a dog to death, William Link, a painter of
Brooklyn, was arrested on complaint of a neighbor who witnessed the
deed. The animal was a stray dog that had taken refuge in Link’s
yard. In defence, the prisoner stated at the trial before the Court of
Special Sessions, Second Division, that the dog had bitten one of his
children and also a newsboy. Armed with a large stick, Link had gone
into the yard and beaten the dog until he killed it. The evidence of
the witness, however, proved that Link’s excuse was not a truthful
one, and the man was sentenced by Justices Fitzgerald, Forker and
Courtney to pay the ﬁne of $20. Link paid the ﬁne without demur.

FOR driving a wretched horse that was lame and knee—sprung,
Nicholas Ross was arrested by an ofﬁcer of the Society, and the horse
was photographed in order that its condition at the time of the arrest
might be shown at the trial. The defendant claimed that the horse
was a good, strong animal and fully able to work, but the photograph
submitted as evidence to the Court convicted the man of cruelty in
using so wretched a creature: By the Court of Special Sessions, Jus—
tices McKean, Holbrook and Olmsted presiding, the prisoner was
ﬁned $50, with the alternative of twenty days’ imprisonment.

FOR mercilessly lashing a horse over the head, and neck with a whip,
Albert Barrett, a driver of an ice-wagon, was arrested by a Special
Agent of the Society. The ofﬁcer saw Barrett driving his cart at a
furious rate along First Avenue, and brutally lashing one of the
horses as described above. Jumping to the wagon, the ofﬁcer stopped
the animals and arrested the driver. At the Court of Special Sessions,
First Division, Justices Holbrbok, Mayer and Olmsted presiding,
Barrett pleaded guilty. He was sentenced to pay the ﬁne of $15, with
the alternative of ﬁve days in the City Prison.

HARRY AVERY, a truck driver, was arrested at Yonkers, New York,
by the Society’s Special Agent on the charge of cruelty to animals in
driving his team of horses while both animals were suffering from;
sores under the collars. The truck was loaded with gravel. At Police
Headquarters Avery declared that he was not the owner of the horses;
that although he was aware of the size and severity of the sores on
the horses’ shoulders, he had been ordered by his employer, James A.
Varian, a contractor, of Wakeﬁeld, N. J., to drive the animals, but to
be careful not to be arrested. Avery was paroled until four o’clock in
the afternoon, at which hour he was to return in company with the
owner of the horses. William A. Kellogg, Justice of the City Court
of Yonkers, then suspended sentence in the case of Avery and held

the incorporators. It was on its initiative that the cor-
poration was called into existence. Unlike corporations
formed under general laws by the voluntary action of in-
dividuals, the Legislature simply authorizing their creation,
(The American Society is the direct creation of the Legislature
itself, created because in its judgment it supplied a needed
agency for the protection of animals. The additional powers
engrafted on the original charter by the Act of 1894 extended
the work of the Society so as to embrace the protection of the
public against animals roaming at will without care and con—
stituting a menace to public safety. In the general classiﬁca-
tion of corporations as public and private The American So—
ciety may technically fall within the last category. But in its
essential character and objects it was created for public pur-
poses. It subserves no private interests. Its duties and
powers relate exclusively to matters which have always been
deemed suitable for public regulation. There are no stock-
holders, and the whole revenue of the Society from licenses '
must be applied in defraying necessary expenses in the em-
ployment of agents and providing the necessary incidentals for
its work, and to promoting the objects of the incorporation.
It is a quasi corporation, a term which marks the distinction
between strictly private corporations and those which, tech—
nically private, are organized for public objects. (7, Am. and
Eng. Enc. of Law, page 638, and cases cited.) The Society
is a subordinate public agency to perform a service which
the Legislature might delegate to a citizen or public body.
The only doubt as to the validity of the Act of 1902 is
based on the case of Fox 713. The Mohawk and Hudson River
Humane Society (165 N. Y. 517). The defendant in that
case was created by the consolidation under Chapter 292 of
the Laws of 1894 of two existing voluntary corporations or-
ganized under general laws, one for the prevention of cruelty
to children, and one for the prevention of cruelty to animals.
By Chapter 448 of the Laws of 1896 the general system {0.1“
the licensing of dogs engrafted on the powers Of The Ameri-

can Society by the original Act of 1894 was applied to the
other incorporated societies for the prevention of cruelty
to animals. The Mohawk and Hudson River Humane So-
ciety, incorporated in the County of Albany, in the execu-
tion of the power conferred by the Act of 1896, was about to
seize an unlicensed dog, and out of this the litigation in the
Fox case originated. The plaintiff alleged that the Act was
unconstitutional, and so it was ﬁnally adjudged by the Court
of Appeals upon two grounds: First, that the ﬁfth section
of the Act which declared that “ dogs not redeemed within
forty-eight hours (after seizure) may be destroyed or other-
wise disposed of at the discretion of the Society” in effect
permitted the Society to harbor dogs without obtaining a li—
cense, as every other citizen was required to do, and that this
was the grant of an exclusive privilege or immunity forbidden
by Section 18 of Article III of the State Constitution; and,
second, that the seventh section of the Act, so far as it re-
quired the owner of a dog to pay a license fee to the defen-
dant “for its own purposes,”nwas a gift of public money in
contravention of Section 9 of Article VIII of the Constitution.
In considering the application of the Fox case to the powers
conferred by the Act of 1902 on The American Society it is
important to notice that the case is a decisive authority that
the Legislature could lawfully constitute societies for the pre-
vention of cruelty to animals a public agency to execute the
licensing system established by the Act of 1896 and by the
Act of 1902, and that the power conferred upon the agents of
the societies summarily to seize and destroy unlicensed dogs
was not repugnant to that clause in the Constitution which
protects property against invasion without due process of law.
The qualiﬁed character of property in dogs was held to dis-
tinguish it from other property, and that due process of
law was exerted wen the Legislature, under the police
power, authorized the seizure and destruction of unlicensed
dogs by the defendant Society.

The Constitutional objection raised by the Court of Ap—

Varian on the charge of having caused and permitted Avery to drive
the horses. Varian, who pleaded guilty, was sentenced to pay the
ﬁne of $10 for each horse. In default of payment, he was to be im-
prisoned for twenty days in the County Jail. Varian paid the $20
and the Court ordered that the truck and the horses be returned to
the owner and that on no account should the horses be used until the

sores were healed.

FOR brutally beating his horse, the animal being lame from chronic
founder in both forefeet, Samuel Dopel, a peddler, was arrested by
Police Ofﬁcer Redmond P. Keresy, of the Thirty~fourth Precinct, who
charged him with inhuman treatment of an animal which was also in
no condition for work. Dopel was taken to'the Thirty—ﬁrst Precinct
and was arraigned before Magistrate Lorenz Zeller, of the Fifth Dis-
trict Court, who ﬁxed his bail at $100. By the Court of Special Sessions,
First Division, Justices Mayer, McKean and Forker presiding, the
defendant was found guilty of cruelty to animals and was sentenced
to pay the ﬁne of $5, or to be imprisoned for one day. Dopel had been
already in prison for three days before his case was called.

POLICE OFFICER HENRY UPHAM of the Sixteenth Precinct arrested
Louis Liagre for working, attached to an express wagon, a horse with
sores on its hips and forelegs, and so weak that when it fell it was
unable to regain its feet. Magistrate Cornell, on learning from a
special ofﬁcer of the Society that Liagre was an old offender, held him
in $500 bail for trial. The case came up before Justices Wyatt, Mayer
and Olmsted, in the First Division of the Court of Special Sessions.
Liagre pleaded not guilty. He was represented by counsel, who de-
clared that the Society was-persecuting his client, and received the
ﬁnes imposed by the court. Justice Wyatt defended the Society and
its work, and Justice Mayer declared that all the judges of the Court
of Special Sessions had full conﬁdence in the organization. Liagre
was convicted, and a ﬁne of $50 was imposed on him, with the alter-
native of 20 days’ imprisonment.

ON the information of a lady living at Yonkers, Thomas Lomasney,
an employee of the Westchester Lighting Company, was arrested by
Police Oﬁ’icer Delaney, of Yonkers, and arraigned before Justice Wil-
liam B. Moorhouse. A Special Agent of the Society made the com-
plaint, which charged Lomasney with beating in a cruel manner a horse
owned by the Lighting Company. Lomasney pleaded guilty, and urged
that he was intoxicated. Justice Moorhouse found no excuse in this
explanation, and sentenced the man to pay a ﬁne of $10 or to serve

men Clarke and Quinn, however, testiﬁed that Steinman had actually
thrown the cat from the window. He was found guilty and was sen-

tenced to pay a ﬁne of $25, or to be imprisoned for ten days. He paid

WINFIELD S. HUNTINGTON, of Homer, N. Y., was arraigned before

the case appeared to be one of unintentional neglect rather than of
wilful cruelty, Justice Parker imposed a ﬁne of but $5, warning Hunt-
ington that a severer sentence would be passed upon him if he should
be again arraigned on a similar complaint.

ten days in jail. As Lomasney had no money, he went to prison for
the full term. .

ALBERT TRIPP, a farmer of Alton, Wayne County, N. Y., was ar—
rested by a Special Ofﬁcer of the Society, charged with starving cattle.
When arraigned before Justice of the Peace Anson W. Getchell, he
obtained a jury trial, and was promptly convicted. Justice Getchell
imposed a ﬁne of $15.

MOUNTED Police Ofﬁcer Edward Friese, of the Seventy-seventh Sub-
Precinct, arrested Michael Dietz, a butcher and horse-dealer, for lead-
ing two disabled horses through the streets. On this charge Dietz
was held in $300 bail for trial at Special Sessions. A second charge,
of abandoning a horse in the streets, was made against him by a _
Special Ofﬁcer of the Society, on which he was held in bail of the
same amount. He was unable to procure a bondsman, and remained
in jail until his trial before Justices Keady, Fitzgerald and Flem-
ing, of the Second Division of the Court of Special Sessions. He
was represented by counsel. On the testimony of a Special Ofﬁcer
of the Society that the horse was suffering from farcy, a contagious
disease, the justices found him guilty on both charges. Sentence was
suspended in the ﬁrst case, but in the second Dietz was sentenced to
three months in the County Jail. Both the horses were destroyed
by the Society’s agent.

ON complaint of a citizen of Gloversville, N. Y., George Leicher,
a Syrian fruit peddler, was arrested for cruelty to animals in driving
a horse with a number of sores on the back and shoulders, unpro-
tected from the chaﬁng of the harness. When arraigned before Re-
corder Theodore Haviland, of the Gloversville Police Court, the de-
fendant, who had chosen to plead not guilty, ﬁnally pleaded guilty.
The Recorder took into consideration the fact that it was the man’s
ﬁrst offence and ﬁned him but $5.

FOR throwing a cat out of the window to the sidewalk below, where
it was killed, Jacob Steinman, of 119 Delancey Street, was arrested by
Policeman Philip Clarke, of the Twelfth Precinct, and was held by
Magistrate Breen in $300 bail for trial at Special Sessions. After two
postponements, the case ﬁnally came up before Justices Holbrook,
Mayer and Olmsted, of the First Division of that Court. In his defence
Steinman declared that the cats in his neighborhood had driven him
nearly wild, and that on coming in late one night he had found two
of them in his bedroom. In the attempt to drive them out one of the

they may be destroyed; but if not claimed and redeemed or
destroyed within ﬁve days of the time of seizure they shall then
be destroyed.” It is clear that the constitutional objection
founded on Section 18, Article III of the Constitution made to
the Act in the Fox case has no application to the Act of 1902.

The provision in the Act of 1902 that the license fees col—
lected by The American Society “ shall be applied by said
Society in defraying the cost of carrying out the provisions
of this Act and maintaining a shelter for lost, strayed, or
homeless animals; and any fees so collected and not required
in carrying out the provisions of this Act shall be retained by
the said Society as compensation for enforcing the provisions
of Title Sixteen of the Penal Code and such other statutes of
the State as relate to the humane work in which said Society
is engaged,” is not a gift of public money forbidden by the
Constitution. 7

The clause of the Constitution bearing upon this question
is Section 9 of Article VIII, which declares: “ Neither the
credit nor the money of the State shall be given or loaned
to or in aid of any association, corporation, or private under-
taking. This section shall not, however, prevent the Legisla-
ture from making such provision for the education and sup-
port of the blind, the deaf and dumb, and juvenile delinquents,
as to it may seem proper,” etc. The design of this section
and of the tenth section, imposing a similar prohibition on
cities, towns and villages, was to interpose a barrier to
the practice which had grown up in legislative bodies to ap-
propriate public moneys or to loan the public credit in aid of
private enterprises on the plea of assumed public utility. The
bestowing by the Legislature of public money as gratuities
to corporations or individuals was prohibited by the ninth
section and nothing beyond. An appropriation by the Legis-
lature of public money, unless it amounts to a gift to the cor-
poration or individual designated as the recipient, is not
within the prohibition. T'he pro‘hibitory words: “ Neither the
credit nor the money of the State shall be given,” admit of

SLAUGHTER HOUSES AND RECEIVING DEPOTS.

Our Special Agents are in attendance daily at the several
receiving depots for live stock, as well as the slaughter
houses of the city. At the former it has only been neces—
sary to interfere on one or two occasions, and in those in-
stances to have a number of calves fed, and milch cows re-
lieved of an over-excess of milk.

The mode of slaughtering cattle, or other live stock for
human food, is carried on in a humane manner, and we have
found nothing to interfere with in that direction.

AMBULANCE AND DERRICK SERVICE.

This part of our work has rendered efﬁcient service dur-
ing the past year, and has been constantly in demand. Several
hores and mules have been rescued from excavatiOns into
which they have accidentally fallen and taken to hospitals.
It is at the service of the public any hour of the day or
night, all the year round.

SPECIAL AGENTS.

Reports from Special Agents, other than those attached
to the Headquarters of the Society, have been gratifying, as
they report that the laws for the prevention of cruelty to
animals are duly recognized and respected. Few prose-
cutions have occurred outside of New York City proper.
The mere knowledge of the fact that a Special Agent of the So—
ciety, with power to enforce the laws, is present in a vicinity
is sufﬁcient to deter most people from acting in a cruel
manner to their animals.

DOG, COCK FIGHTING AND RAT BAITING.

These old-time so—called spOrts are now of rare occurrence,
at least in the built-up portions of the city. Once in a while,
an attempt is made to “ pull off ” an animal ﬁght at some lonely

no other interpretation. It may very well be that an appro—
priation by the Legislature of public money under the guise
of a contract would be a gift within Section 9, Article VIII of
the Constitution provided the contract was not one which the
State was authorized to. make. But where no evasion is at-
tempted and the appropriation is not made as a gratuity, but
is founded upon a consideration Which the Legislature may
lawfully recognize, it is not condemned by this section. If
invalid its invalidity must be found in some other prohibition
or provision of the Constitution. The substantial answer
to the constitutional o'bje'ction raised under Section 9, Article
VIII is that the provision in Section 8 of the Law of \I902’is
not, in terms or in substance, a gift of money to The American
Society. This provision devotes the license fees to defraying
the expense of executing the police policy of the State in
respect to the licensing system established by the Act of
1902, and of enforcing the criminal statutes relating to cruelty
to animals and other cognate subjects. The work done by the
Society in respect to these matters has been referred to, and
its importance and the efﬁciency of the Society as the recog-
nized agency to secure the enforcement of these statutes is
known and acknowledged. The discharge of the duties in—
trusted to The American Society involves large expenditures
in carrying on the organization, employing agents, maintain—
ing a shelter for the temporary detention of animals, main-
taining an ambulance system, and other similar purposes.
There can, we conceive, be no question that the Legislature
could properly charge the expense of executing the license
system and the compensation of its agents in aiding in the
enforcement of the provisions of Title XVI of the Penal Code
upon the license fund. This is all that was done by Section 8
of the Act of 1902. Payments by the State for these purposes
is in an accurate sense a discharge of the obligations of the
State incurred in the administration of its police power.
Compensation made by the State to an individual or to a cor-
porate body for public service rendered at its instance IS

however, owing to the vigilance of the police and our local.

Agents.
CANALS.

Our Special Agents -are continually on the watch at the
different canals of the State. The animals used in this class
of work, it is gratifying to report, are in good condition.
Several horses were suspended from labor on account of
lameness, and others not lame, but in poor physical condi-
tion, were sent to the stable to recuperate.

GENERAL WORK.

Hack stands, ferry—boat landings, markets, places of
amusement, excavations and other places Where animals
are employed and horses and cattle shipped to domestic or
' foreign ports, were visited by Special Agents of the Society,
for the purpose of correcting any conditions likely to cause
suffering, and any improvements suggested by the Society,
for the better sanitary conditions or comfort of such animals,
were cheerfully made.

As an evidence of the continuous and varied character
of our work, the following will serve to describe:

A Special Agent, while on his way to court, to prosecute a
case of cruelty, meets with a horse lying in the street; a crowd
gathers and street traﬂic is congested. Many have their
own ideas as to how the animal should be gotten up, until
the driver, nearly distracted by the many kinds of advice
shouted to him, gives up in despair. Our Special Agent ar-
rives and goes about the job in a practical way, and soon the
horse is on its feet, and if not injured, harnessed to vehicle
and started off. The Special Agent makes another start for
court, when his services are again required; this time a cat
has been run over by a passing vehicle. As usual, a crowd
gathers, and suggestions as to what should be done freely

neither in form nor substance a gift of the public money. The
clause in Section 9 of Article VIII of the Constitution follow—
ing the prohibitory words, viz.: “ This section shall not, how—
ever, prevent the Legislature from making such provision
for the education and support of the blind, the deaf and dumb,
and juvenile delinquents, as to it may seem proper,” do not
justify an inference that compensation made by the State for .
services rendered by private corporations or individuals in the
execution of police regulations are gifts of public money. It
will be noticed that this clause is not put in the form of an
exception to the preceding prohibition. Obviously payments
by the State for the education and support of dependent
classes made to private corporations which undertake, at
the instance of the State, the performance of duties recog-
nized as public, and which the State in justice ought to as-
sume, are not in any proper sense gifts. It is not, however,
difﬁcult to conceive cases where forms of State aid to private
corporations engaged in the relief of the blind, the deaf and
dumb, etc., might be regarded as gifts instead. of provisions
for education and support. The framers of the Constitution
designed to give a free hand to the Legislature in providing
for the objects speciﬁed in this clause. The clause was evi-
dently inserted out of extreme caution so as to preclude any
construction which would hamper the State in providing for
this beneﬁcent work. It does not tend to show that com-
pensation by the State to private corporations for public ser—
vice is a gift of public money within the prohibition. The stat—
ute under consideration in the F ox case (Chapter 448, Laws
of 1896), provided. (Section 7) that the license fees collected
by the societies; of which the Mohawk and Hudson River
Humane Society was one, should be used by the societies in
defraying the expenses incurred in carrying out the act “ and ”
maintaining a shelter for lost animals, etc., “ and,” this section
concludes, “for its own purposes.” It was upon these con-
cluding words that Judge Cullen based his opinion that the
section violated the prohibition in the Constitution against

gifts of public money to private corporations. After nega-
tiving the grounds upon which the Appellate Division rested
its decision, Judge Cullen said: “We think, however, that
the statute is unconstitutional so far as it requires the owner
of a dog to pay a license fee to the defendant for its own
use.” The authority given to the Society to retain the license
fees and apply them to “its own purposes,” which embrace
not only the protection of animals but of children also against
cruelty, was the turning point on that branch of the case.
The money was not given to the Society as compensation,
and it could be used. at the discretion of the Society for pur—
poses not germane to the source from which it was derived.
The Act now governing The American Society (Chapter 495
of the Laws of 1902) differs in an essential and vital point
from the Act under consideration in the Fox case. The
money remaining, if any, after paying expenses of carrying
out the license system and maintaining a shelter is to be re-
tained by The American Society under the Law of 1902 (Sec-
tion 8) “ as compensation” for enforcing the provisions of
Title XVI of the Penal Code and other similar statutes. The
right to make such compensation is, in my judgment, un—
doubted, and while the amount authorized to be retained is
quite inadequate to the development of the constantly
broadening work of the Society, the amount of the compen—
sation to be made, if compensation can be made at all, is a
legislative and not a judicial question. Upon the whole I am
of opinion that the disposition of the license fees made by
the Act of 1902 is not in conﬂict with Section 9, Article VIII
of the Constitution, and that the Fox case may and ought to
be distinguished on this point from a case arising under that
Act.

In respect to the suggestion that the Act of 1902 attempts
to confer on The American Society the power to appoint
public ofﬁcers in the authority to appoint ofﬁcers and agents,
who, when appointed, are vested with ofﬁmal functions, is
answered in the main by the decision of the Court of Appeals

HISTORY.

Prior to the enactment of the statute entitled “ An Act to
Prevent the Cruel and Improper Treatment of Cattle,” intro-
duced in England in July, 1822, by the late highly esteemed
Mr. Martin, the general treatment of animals in all countries
of the world was inhuman.

* “ Whether from ignorance, thoughtlessness, heedlessness,

or wanton brutality, animals were subjected to extreme pain
and torture, and their condition failed to excite the commiser-
ation of the public. The best classes of society contained a few
persons only who openly protested against this cruelty, while
the majority were engaged in divers pastimes that caused
much animal suffering, and regarded with scorn~ and indigna-
tion any appeal made to them in favor of the brutes. Naturally,
the lower and lowest orders were therefore more or less insen-
sible to the claims of lower animals; taking cue as well as ex-
ample from their betters, they also indulged in cruel sports
and maintained a right in man to behave toward dumb do-
mestic dependents as he pleased. In fact, the protests of
humane people were silenced by ridicule which came from the
platform, the pulpit, and the senate, as well as from the galled
pens of satirists.

“ No better instance can be quoted of the prevailing indiffer-
ence of men in even the highest social position to the feelings
of animals than the mocking treatment of the Peers when
'Lord Erskine stood up in the House of Lords, in the early

In addition, many highly checked horses have been relieved
and the drivers and owners warned that a repetition of. the
offence would lead to their prosecution. Broken blinders
have been removed, drivers have been instructed how to
harness and care for their animals, advice given as to how'
to treat horses when overcome by the heat, or attacked by
other ailments, citizens have been advised as to the proper
treatment of domestic animals in cases of emergency, and
everything has been done within the power Of the Society
to alleviate animal suffering when brought to its attention.

The Brooklyn Department of our work, under the able
direction of Inspector Clark, has accomplished great work,
with the small force under his command.

In conclusion, the undersigned recognizes the interest
and courtesy extended to the Society and its Special Agents by
every Department of the City Government, mOre especially
the District Attorney and his assistants, the Justices of the
Special Sessions and higher criminal courts.

The neat appearance of the uniformed Special Agents of
the Society and their prompt and intelligent judgment in all
matters pertaining to their ofﬁcial duties are also commended.

Respectfully submitted,

CHARLES H. HANKINSON,
S'uperiitztmdent.

ing such ofﬁcers and agents peace ofﬁcers simply means that 1
they shall have the powers of peace ofﬁcers in respect to the

Legislature did not overstep its authority in conferring the
powers mentioned. Even if it were otherwise the general I

part of the present century (1811), to ask for justice to the
lower creatures of God. Insensible alike to his moderate de-
mands and appeals for compassion and mercy to all defenseless
animals that man had pressed into his service, the chamber
broke out into open derision when he argued in favor of their
rights to humane treatment. It is said that loud jeers, vulgar
ejaculations, indecorous demeanor, and even whistling and
cock-crowingwere practically the only reply given to the
‘ grand speech of this high-souled man. N o wonder, therefore,
that the man in the street ridiculed also, and that callous coach-
men and other persons vented their unrestrained passions on
animals without let or hindrance. The public records of eighty
years ago certainly do show that the friends of the brutes were
few, and their foes many and cruel.

“ The most reckless and savage punishment, and the most
disgusting disregard to the bodily sufferings of animals, were
exhibited unconcealed in the highways and streets daily; fester-
ing sores, discharging wounds, excruciating lameness, and
tottering inﬁrmity called not forth modern devices to evade
public reprobation, and without disguise the lash and goad
worked their bloody inflictions. The uncombined efforts of
a few benevolent individuals were no check to these evils ; and
hence it became necessary to establish a society which should
unite the friends of dumb animal creatures.

“ The founders of this Society met on the 16th of June, 1824,
and inaugurated the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, appointed a committee, and conceived the following
plan of Operations:

1. The circulation of suitable tracts gratuitously, or by cheap sale,
particularly among persons intrusted with cattle, such as coach-
men, carters, and drovers.

2.1- The introduction into schools of books calculated to impress on
youth the duty of humanity to inferior animals.

3. Frequent appeals to the public through the press, awakening more

general attention to a subject so interesting, though too much

neglected.

 
    
  
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
  
  
   

 

  

 




 

 

PUBLICATIONS.

In addition to the monthly magazine of the Society, OUR
ANIMAL FRIENDS, and the manual, “Kindness to Animals,”
referred to in another part of this report, the Society publishes
a number of leaﬂets, among which the following may be men-
tioned:

No. I.——“ Ten Rules for the Treatment of Animals.” Gives
valuable hints in regard to the treatment conducive to the good
health and happiness of animals.

No. 2.—-—“ What is Docking?” Points out the absurdities
of the practice, and cites the opinions of the best authorities
proving the cruelty of the operation.

No. 3.——“ Fashion’s Cruelty and Bird Protection.” An able
plea by J. A. Allen, Ph.D., for the preservation of bird life,
now so wantonly and cruelly sacriﬁced in the interest of vain
fashion.

No. 4.——“ The Dishornin g of Cattle an Act of Cruelty.” The
cruelty and fallacy of dishorning graphically set forth in a
re’sume’ of the famous English dishorning case.

No. 5.-——“ Hints for the Dog Days.” Dispels the many ig-
norant and false ideas in regard to rabies and hydrophobia,
and gives valuable information concerning the dog, its ner-
vous disorders, and its care.

N o. 6.———“ Rabies and Hydrophobia.” Gives the opinions of
medical men on these diseases, and refers to the Pasteur treat-
ment and the Buisson cure by vapor baths.

These leaﬂets are intended for gratuitous distribution, and
will be forwarded to any address on receipt of postage, as fol-

tion, not against its enemies, but against false or too ofﬁ-
cious friends. More times than a few it has been our pain—
ful duty to expose the cheap clap-trap of pretenders seeking
to gain notoriety as champions of humanity while they
neither knew nor cared one straw for the cause they pro—
fessed to serve. Once at least we have had to ﬁght and
kill a society, organized ostensibly for the protection of ani-
mals, but really for the protection of wholesale offenders
against the laws for the prevention of cruelty. Hardly a
year passes that we are not obliged to spend days and weeks
of anxious labor merely to prevent the enactment of foolish
laws which their promoters fancy would prevent some form
of cruelty, but which would do a great deal more harm than
good. Seldom is there a session of the Congress of the
United States that we are not obliged to defeat some mer—
cenary scheme ostensibly proposed for the protection of
animals but really for the liberal ﬁlling of the capacious and
vacuous pockets of some coterie of adventurers. These are
far from pleasant duties, but if they were not done, and done
effectually, the cause of animal protection would very soon
fall into contempt.

There are other more pleasant ways in which our interest
in the good cause of animal protection has been, and con—
tinues to be, very practically exhibited in all parts of this
country. It was only yesterday, so to speak, that the out—
rageous cruelty committed by German cavalry ofﬁcers in a
so-called “ long-distance race ” tickled the fancy and stirred
a feeling of emulation among some restless people in the
great Northwest. A long—distance race from Chadron to
Chicago was publicly announced with three hundred entries,
one of them a woman. It was impossible to stop that race,
for the simple reason that there is no law under which a
man can be punished for cruelty until the cruelty has been
committed. But every town and village between Chadron
and Chicago was placarded with printed notices offering
rewards for evidence to convict any person of actual cruelty

any horse, mule, cow, cattle, sheep, or other animal, belonging
to himself or another, shall, upon conviction, be adjudged
guilty of a misdemeanor.”

On the 22d of April a meeting was held in Clinton Hall for
the purpose of effecting a permanent organization, and at that
meeting the ﬁrst society for the protection of animals in this
country came into active existence. The purpose of the as-
sociation, as set forth in its constitution, was “ to provide ef-
fective means for the prevention of cruelty to animals through—
out the United States, to enforce all laws which then were or
might thereafter be enacted for the protection of animals, and
to secure, by lawful means, the arrest and conviction of all
persons found violating such laws.” As a matter of fact, the
only law of that kind then to be found on the statute books of
the States of the Union was that which had been passed by
the Legislature of New York nine days after the incorporation
of the Society. Within twelve months, however, another “ act
for the more effectual prevention of cruelty to animals ” was
passed by the Legislature of the same State; and from time to
time additions have been made to it, so that there is now
hardly a phase of cruelty which the Society has not the legal
power to prevent within the boundaries of the State of New
York. The legal deﬁnition of the word “ animal” now in-
cludes every living creature except members of the human
race, and the words “ torture ” and “ cruelty ” include every
act, omission, or neglect whereby unjustiﬁable physical pain,
suffering, or death is caused or permitted.

ORGANIZATION OF OTHER SOCIETIES—PROGRESS OF THE
WORK.

The organization and inﬂuence of The American Society
soon led to the establishment of local societies in all parts of
the Union and in other countries on the American Continent
and elsewhere. The number of local societies incorporated

 




 

 

152

in the United States is now 233, and in other American na-
tions 21 societies have been established and incorporated
since 1866, making a total of 254.

The prevention of cruelty to animals has been the beginning
of many other humane organizations. Thus, in 1874, the So‘
ciety appeared as prosecutor in a case of cruelty to children,
and it then appeared to be advisable to organize a separate
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. This
was done in 1875, under the Presidency of Mr. John D.
Wright; Mr. Henry Bergh becoming Vice-President of the
new society, the ﬁrst of its kind in the world, which has done
so much and sudh effectively good work in the last twenty-
nine years. \

The establishment of these and other organizationshas rep-
resented an increased interest in humane work which has
found a practical expression in the legislation of nearly every
State in the Union. At this date there is not a single State in
which cruelty of any kind is not forbidden by the law, under
stringent penalties for disobedience. Some def-ects continue
to exist, of course; but, speaking broadly, it may be said that
the laws on this subject are good. What is now required is
that the great mass of the people shall be educated into sym-
pathy with the humanity of the law. That is nowthe greatest
work of the Society, and it has constant reason to be grateful
for the assistance and encouragement which it receives from
the press, the pulpit, and the judges of the courts.

The abuses growing out of the then prevailing systems of
dog catching and impounding having become so ﬂagrant as
to demand immediate checking, a bill, entitled “An Act for
the better protection of lost and strayed animals, and for
securing the rights of the owners thereof,” was prepared by
the President of the Society and introduced into the Legisla—
ture of 1894, providing for the abolishment of the city dog
pound, and empowering the Society to carry out the provisions
of the act. This bill became a law on March 8, 1894 (Chap. I IS,
Laws .1894)’ and the Society immediately thereupon com-

menced the erection of a Shelter for Animals at road Street
and East River, provided with every accommodation. for the
care of animals and their humane destruction.

In rescuing the community from the reign of the old dog
catchers, the Society earned the gratitude of the dog owners
of New York, and in 1895, at the request of the Mayor of
Brooklyn, the law was amended (Chap. 412, Laws 1895) so as
to include that city as well. A Shelter was then established in
that city, at the corner of Malbone Street and Nostrand Avenue,
and when Staten Island became a part of the greater City of
New York, a Shelter was also opened on Wave Street, Staple-
ton, Borough of Richmond.

Much suffering has thus been 'spared the vagrant, lost, and
abandoned dogs and cats of the city. Unwanted animals are
no longer thrown into the streets, to suffer and die of expo-
sure and starvatiOn, but are given into the care of the Society
and by it mercifully destroyed or placed in good homes.

Through the generosity of kind-hearted people interested in
the work of animal protection, the Society was enabled, in
1896-97, to rear a commodious ﬁreproof building as its perma-
nent Headquarters, adequate to the increased needs of the So—
ciety, and supplied with every facility for carrying on the work
to the best advantage.

Meanwhile the practical work is not neglected. The ofﬁcers
of the Society are clothed with ample police powers. They
wear a distinctive uniform and patrol the streets by day and
by night. They have full power to arrest and prosecute oﬁend-
ers against the laws relating to animals. In addition to the
uniformed police, the Society has nearly two hundred special
agents in different parts of the State, clothed with the same
authority and engaged in enforcing the laws for the prevention
of cruelty. In the Boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn the
Society has ambulances for the removal of injured, sick, and
disabled animals; appliances for the rescue of drowning ani—
mals and animals which have fallen into excavations; and a
patrol wagon which carries with it the necessary apparatus

refuses to act, then obtain the name and address of the offender,
and that painted on the vehicle, if any, and the names and ‘resi—
, dences of those who witnessed the act, and lay the facts before
a magistrate.

IN ALL CASES

Make a note of the time when, and the street or place where,
the offense occurred, and also the names and residences of all
persons present and of any others who may be called as wit-
nesses. If the offense was that of driving a horse or other
animal with galled neck or shoulders, or other wounds, note
the size and location of such wounds-especially if raw, dis—
charging, or in contact with the harness. If the offense was
ﬂogging or beating, note the instrument, the number of blows,
on what part Of the body inﬂicted, and the effect, if any, on the
skin of the animal; if overloading, carefully observe the symp—
toms of distress, such as the trembling, falling, unusual perspi-
ration, Or exhaustion. Report all cases of mutilation, such as
docking tails Of horses, cutting tails or ears of dogs, or any
other torture; also cases of cruelty in the transporting of sheep,
calves, game, fowls, or other poultry, or animals, while bound
by the legs or otherwise, in any part of this State, either on land
or water. In every instance observe minutely and take down
in writing the facts and details, and also the language of the
offender at the time.

FINALLY.

Complaints or inquiries made to the Society at its head—
quarters, by ”night or by day, will receive prompt attention; and
ALL ARRESTS FOR CRUELTY SHOULD BE PROMPTLY REPORTED
THERE, TO INSURE A PROPER PROSECUTION OF THE CASE.

STEEL GAS TANK 'FOR THE HUMANE
DESTRUCTION OF SMALL ANIMALS.

See Illustrations, page 60.

The dimensions of this tank are as follows: length, ten feet;
Width, ﬁve feet; and height, four feet six inches. A trap-door
is provided through which the animals are put into the tank,
and four heavy plate-glass windows light the interior. Ordinary
illuminating gas is admitted through an inch and one—quarter
pipe, and when the tank is to be emptied escapes through a
six-inch pipe. As shown by the illustration on page 60, a
truck or cage rests on the bottom of the tank on tracks, the
latter withdrawing from the tank so that the cage can be moved
outside to facilitate the handling of the bodies of dead animals.

The method of destroying small animals by illuminating
gas was adopted by the Society after a thorough investigation

of other known methods, and is to be recommended from hu~ .

mane and sanitary standpoints. Illuminating gas produces
anaesthesia or insensibility, and death follows almost instan-
taneously and is absolutely painless. Charcoal fumes cause
asphyxia or suffocation, and the use of charcoal is not recom-
mended for that reason.

 

 

 

 




SOCIETIES OTHER THAN THOSE OF NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA.

It will be gratifying to the friends of our cause to learn from the following list of kindred societies that the work
of animal protection has extended to almost every part of the world. Many of these societies are powerful ororan-
izations, whose merciful inﬂuences have been felt abroad as well as at home through the dissemination of hurrTane

.1 literature. The Royal Society at London was the ﬁrst in the world. It was organized in 1824, and now has
branches in every considerable city of England.

and medicines for rendering aid to injured animals in the
streets. .

In addition to its permanent headquarters, Madison Avenue
and 26th Street, and the Shelters above mentioned, the Society
maintains an ambulance house at II I and 113 East 22d Street,
New York, and an ofﬁce at I 3 Willoughby Street, and an
ambulance house at 114 Lawrence Street, Brooklyn. In the
greater City of New York it maintains a uniformed force of
twenty salaried Special Agents, and in other parts of the State
of New York it has over two hundred volunteer agents.

In the prosecution of its work, the Society has in constant
use three large ambulances for the removal of disabledani-
mals, and eight smaller ambulances, two tricycle carriers
and two motor ambulances especially constructed for the
removal of sick, injured and homeless small animals.
Twenty horses and a large corps of men are employed in
this service.

The ofﬁcial organ of the Society is OUR ANIMAL FRIENDS,

MICHAEL DERESTO, of Rockaway Beach, N. Y., was arrested by the
Society’s Special Agent on the charge of cruelty to animals in using
a mule while the animal had an unprotected sore on its breast. At the
trial before the Court of Special Sessions, Second Division, Justices
Forker, Keady and Fleming presiding, Deresto’s employer, Mr. Rem—
ington Vernon, a real estate broker and a lawyer, appeared for the
defendant, pleaded guilty, and expressed his hearty sympathy with the
work of the Society. He declared that he had not known the condition
of the animal, but that he held himself morally responsible for it, and
therefore would offer no defence, being quite ready to pay the ﬁne the
Court would see ﬁt to impose.- He was ﬁned ten dollars.

PAUL CREUTZBERGER was stopped by an ofﬁcer of the Society for
driving a team of horses to a truck loaded with stone; one horse, a
bay, had sores on the neck, measuring two by two inches, the other
animal, a ﬁne gray, had sores on the neck, four by three, and on the
breast, two by two inches. The ofﬁcer obliged the driver to unharness
the animals and to take them back to the stable, warning him not to
use them again before the sores were quite healed. Two days later the

Justices McKean, Olmsted and Holbrook presiding, Creutzberger de—

clared in his defence that the horses had been stabled for two days
and were perfectly well when taken out. for work. He had, he said,
padded the collars where they pressed on the sores. His futile excuses
were cut short by the Court that sentenced him to pay the ﬁne of ten
dollars, or to be imprisoned for ﬁve days.

ON the complaint of James Malinos, an ofﬁcer of the Society ar-
rested Kate Manning for having kicked a goat to death. Arraigned
before Magistrate Clarence W. Mead, the prisoner was held for trial
at the Court of Special Sessions, First Division, in $500 bail. The
only witness for the people at the trial was Malinos, who proved his
case. The defendant was found guilty and was reproved by Justice
McKean, who warned her that if ever she should be brought to court
again on the charge of cruelty to animals she would be severely dealt
with. Sentence, however, was suspended, for at the last moment the
complaining witness admitted that he had used the goat to pull a wagon
for an hour after the animal had been kicked by the woman.

IN a hollow iron column of a building in process of erection on
Madison Street a cat took refuge. The workmen, not knowing that
the animal was in the column, bricked up the opening, imprisoning

POLICE OFFICER JAMES G. RYAN, of the Nineteenth Precinct, ar—
rested Robert Weisberg, a Russian, for driving a horse which was
utterly unﬁt for use. The animal was harnessed to a wagon loaded
with newspapers. A large sore on thenear side of the breast caused
the horse evident suffering in addition to the extreme weakness of its
general condition. It seemed hardly able to crawl along. Weisberg
was taken to the Second District Court, where City Magistrate Joseph
Poole held him for trial at Special Sessions at $200 bail. Arraigned
before Justices Holbrook, Mayer and Olmsted, of the Court of Special
Sessions, First Division, Weisberg pleaded not guilty, alleging that the
horse had left its stable in good condition, but had seemed “played
out " when arrested at Forty-second Street by Ofﬁcer Ryan. The de-
fendant was found guilty, and was sentenced to pay the ﬁne of $25 or
to be imprisoned for ﬁve days.

LOUIS LIAGRIE, a Belgian, an expresSman, and the owner of a mis-
erable, weak and exhausted horse, ‘was arrested by Police Ofﬁcer C.
O’Donnell, of the Seventeenth Precinct, on the charge of cruelty in
using the animal in his business. At Seventh Avenue and Twenty-
third Street the horse had fallen to the ground, unable to rise. The
ofﬁcer’s attention was ﬁrst attracted by the crowd surrounding the
prostrate horse. The Society’s ambulance was immediately telephoned
for and the animal removed to a veterinary hospital for treatment.
At the trial before Justices Holbrook: McKean and Wyatt, of the
Court of Special Sessions, First Division, the prisoner/pleaded not
guilty, declaring that there was nothing the matter with the horse.
The veterinary surgeon, however, testiﬁed that the horse was still in
slings at the hospital and unable to stand. The Court sentenced the
prisoner to pay the ﬁne of $25, or to imprisonment for ten days.

FOR brutally whipping his horse, clubbing it and ﬁnally stabbing the
animal in the nose with a knife, Charles Brenzel, an Italian peddler,
was arrested on warrant by a Special Agent of the Society, three wit—
nesses appearing against the man at the trial. The Court of Special
Sessions, Second Division, Justices Fitzgerald, Courtney and Wilkins
presiding, sentenced Brenzel to pay the ﬁne of $25, with the alternative
of ten days in prison. The peculiar circumstance of the assault on
the horse made Justice Fitzgerald in favor of sentencing the defendant

‘to three months in the County Jail, without ﬁne. By the complainant,

Brenzel was ﬁrst seen attempting to drive the horse while the animal
was hobbled with a rope around its feet and attached to the wagon
shaft. The horse stumbled and fell, and Brenzel then beat and stabbed
it, as the witnesses testiﬁed. ‘

115 of the Laws of 1894, prescribing a system for the licens—
ing of dogs in cities of over 800,000 population (practically
in the City of New York), the administration and supervision
of which Was Committed to The American Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Section 11 of the Act
repeals the authority conferred upon the Common Council
of the City of New York by Sub-section 30 of Section 86 of
the Consolidation Act of 1882, to enact ordinances “ relative
to the taxing and destroying of dogs within the said city.”
The repealing clause in the Act of 1894 shows that it was the
intention of the Legislature to substitute the system estab-
lished by that Act and the control vested in The American
Society in respect to dogs in the City of New York in place
of the authority theretofore vested in the Common Council.
The Act of 1894 was amended by Chapter 412 of the Laws of
1895, and by Chapter 495 of the Laws of 1902, and the exist—
ing system is now embraced in the last-named statute. The
leading features of the Act of 1902 may be brieﬂy sum-
marized. The Act requires every owner of a dog in the City
of New York to take out an annual license and prescribes the
license fee. Each licensed dog is to wear a collar around its
neck, with a metal tagattached bearing the number of the
license. It is provided that dogs not licensed shall be seized,
and if not claimed and redeemed within forty-eight hours,
may be destroyed; and if not claimed and redeemed or de-
stroyed within ﬁve days after the seizure, “ they shall then be
destroyed.” Any cat found without a collar about its neck
bearing the name and residence of the owner “ may be seized
and disposed of in like manner as prescribed above for dogs.”
The power to issue licenses, to collect the license fees, to fur-
nish tags, and generally to carry out the provisions of the Act
is vested in The American Society. Section 8 is as follows:
“The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals is hereby empowered and authorized to carry out the
provisions of this Act, and the said Society IS further author-
ized to issue the licenses and renewals, and t0 C011€Ct the fees

such other statutes of the State as relate to the humane work
'in which the said Society is engaged.” The reason for the
last provision in this section, that the Society shall retain the
license fees not required for the other speciﬁed services as
compensation for enforcing the provisions of Title XVI of
the Penal Code, is found in the nature of those provisions
and the work of the Society in aiding in their enforcement.
That title of the Penal Code is entitled “ Cruelty to Animals,”
embracing Sections 655 to 669, inclusive. They cover not
only the cases of cruelty to animals, but other offenses against
good order and affecting the public welfare connected with
their improper use. Among other things they make over-
driving, abandonment of diseased animals, the failure to pro-
vide animals with proper food and drink, wantonly poisoning
them, cock-ﬁghting and other similar sports, and. the keeping
of cows in unhealthy places and the selling of impure milk,
misdemeanors. The Penal Code has been supplemented by
many other statutory provisions which relate more or less
directly to the work of societies for the prevention of cruelty
to animals. (See Society Manual.) Section 668 of Title XVI
of the Penal Code expresses the legislative intention as to
the relation of The American Society to the execution of the
provisionsof that title. It provides that the ﬁnes and penal—
ties for a violation of the provisions of the. title shall be paid
over to The American Society, except where the prosecution
is initiated and conducted by other societies for the preven-
tion of cruelty to animals. It authorizes any agent or oﬂicer
of the Society to “ arrest and bring before a court or magis-
trate having jurisdiction, any person offending against its pro-

In View of the Fox case hereinafter referred to the question
has been raised as to whether the Act of 1902 is subject to
any constitutional objection.

The regulation of the care of dogs and other animals in the
interest of public security is unquestionably within the com-
petency of the Legislature. It belongs to that great mass of
legislation enacted under What is known as the police power
of the State. The general purpose of the Act, Chapter 115 of
the Laws of 1894 as amended by Chapter 495 of the Laws of
1902, creating a license system for dogs, is plainly in the
interest and for the protection of the people of the City of
New York. It is not a tax or revenue act. The requirement
that owners of dogs shall take out a license is to secure their
proper care and oversight, and the license fee required to be
paid is incident to the carrying out of this purpose and to pro-
vide means for its execution. The Legislature, in the exercise
of its discretion to provide suitable means for the enforce-
ment of its policy, has by the Act designated The American
Society as the administrative agency for carrying out the
license system. There would seem to be no ground to ques—
tion the legislative power in this respect. It is to be observed
that no legislative power and no discretion is vested in the
ofﬁcers or agents of the Society. The Legislature itself
determines that a license shall in all cases be obtained. It ﬁxes
the license fee. It enacts the consequences which shall follow
a disregard of the law. The Society has no discretion to with-
hold a license in any case. In issuing licenses, supplying the
tags, maintaining a shelter, seizing unlicensed dogs, and de-
stroying them unless reclaimed within the time speciﬁed, the,
Society plainly acts as the agent of the State, and exercises
delegated, administrative and executive functions only. In
considering whether the Legislature may vest these adminis—
trative powers in The American Society, the nature of the.
corporation known as The American Society for the Preven-
tion of Cruelty to Animals is worthy of consideration. The
Legislature created the corporation by special act. It named

“ Steadily working by the above means, bravely bearing
contumelyand overcoming difﬁculties, the founders became
stronger year after year: subscribers and co—workers gradually
joined their ranks; and a marked improvement slowly mani-
fested itself in the treatment of animals. Then followed the
distinguished patronage of Her Most Gracious Majesty the
Queen, Her Royal Highness the late Duchess of Kent, the
Nobility, and many distinguished Members of both Houses
of Parliament; and in 1840, by command of Her Majesty, the
Society was honored with the preﬁx of ‘ Royal.’ Since that
period its progress has been regular, and its achievements en-
couraging, and now it is regarded as a permanently estab-
lished institution, which has outlived ridicule, and secured for
its founders the esteem of good and practical men of this
and succeeding generations.

“ During many years the committee advocated the removal
and enlargement of Smithﬁeld Market. Owing to its agency,
bull-baiting, bull-running, cock-ﬁghting, badger—baiting, and
other wicked sports of a barbarous age have been prohibited
by legal enactments. In 1835 the Society obtained an amend-
ment of Martin’s Act; in 1845 an amendment of the law for
regulating Knackers’ Yards; in 1849 a new and much im-
proved Act for the more effectual Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals; and in 1854 an Act prohibiting the use of dogs as
beasts of draft or burden throughout England; and recently
many other Acts of Parliament.”

The ﬁrst society organized in America for the protection
of animals was The American Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals, its founder and ﬁrst president being the
late Henry Bergh, to whose noble self-sacriﬁces and untiring
energies the cause of animal protection in this country owes




 

      
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
   

LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL STATUS
OF THE.A. S. P. C. A.

. OPINION OF HON. CHARLES ANDREWS, FOR-
MERLY CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE COURT OF
APPEALS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

In re The American Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals was incorporated by Chapter 469 of the Laws of

the State of New York, passed April 10, 1866. The charter .

was procured mainly through the efforts of Mr. Bergh, also
the founder of the Society for the PreventiOn of Cruelty to
Children. He devoted many years of his life to the humane
work which the societies were organized to promote. The
Society for "the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was the
pioneer organization of this kind in America, and is the
parent of the local organizations in this State established in
many counties to carry on similar work in their respective
localities. The local societies are not created by special
charter as is The American Society, but under a general

law, and the general statute for the incorporation of such.

societies requires as a prerequisite to their corporate exis-
tence that the proposed corporation shall obtain the approval
of The American Society to the incorporation, or, if such ap-
proval is withheld, the sanction of a Judge of the Supreme
Court. (Chapter 490, Laws of 1888; Chapter 291, Laws of
1892; Membership Corporations Law, Chapter 559, Laws of

Was driving. The mules were attached to a truck,-loaded

with broken stone, which had become settled in the mud

up to the hubs. It was impossible for the mules to move

it, which angered Bolte, who got down and beat the ani—

mals in the manner above described. One of our Agents, '
who witnessed the cruelty, promptly arrested the offender.

He was tried, convicted and sentenced to pay a ﬁne of ﬁfty

dollars or be imprisoned for twenty days.

Mandel Grief abandoned a horse to die on the public
highway. From information received, it appeared that the
horse had fallen down near a house occupied by a neighbor
of the defendant. The former went to the latter, and in-
formed him of the condition of the horse, and offered to
help him get it up and into the stable. This the defendant
refused to do, and in fact refused to accept any aid what-
soever, or do anything for the horse until later in the day,
when he and others tied a rope to the hind legs of the suf-
fering animal, and pulled the dying creature several hun—
dred yards along the rough road. The offender was tried
in the Court of Special Sessions, Second Division, convicted
and sentenced to pay a ﬁne of ﬁfty dollars or be imprisoned

for thirty days.

Gustave Bayard, without any provocation whatever, kicked
a small dog into the street. He then held the animal down
to the ground with one hand, and beat it in a most cruel man-
ner with the other hand. A lady passing at the time reproved
him for his cruel act, when he threatened to strike her in the
same manner. Police Ofﬁcer C. Tautphones happened along
at this moment, when the lady caused the arrest of the of---
fender. He was subsequently tried in the Court of Special
Sessions, where he made the plea that he was afraid the dog
was going to attack him. This was disproved. He was con-
victed and sentenced to pay a ﬁne of twenty—ﬁve dollars or

spend ﬁfteen days in prisOn.

AN APPEAL

An erroneous idea is entertained by many that this Society
is beyond the necessity for further appeals to our benevolent
and generous-hearted people for aid. It receives no appropri-.
ations from the city or State, and is dependent upon voluntary
subscriptions, donations, and bequests. The usefulness of the
organization could be largely increased, and the ﬁeld of its
labors greatly extended, if it had a more adequate pecuniary
support. As all know, the objects of the Society are to enforce
the humane laws, to investigate complaints, to care for lost or
abandoned animals, or to destroy them mercifully, to suppress
cruel beating, overloading, and over—driving, and to protect
and assist sick, maimed, and starving animals.

Another prominent object of the Society is the distribution
of humane literature, out of which shall grow not only the kind
treatment of animals, but the higher elevation of our own race.
It may be desirable to state in this connection that during the
past year the Society has published and distributed many
millions of pages of printed matter in the interest of humanity
to animals, and we have had ample reason to know that the
effect has been fully as great as could have been reasonably
hoped for this purpose; and to these ends we earnestly invite
your pecuniary assistance.

The library of the Society contains many valuable books
relating to the brute creation. Contributions of works treating
of animal life are urgently requested. The library is of great
importance and value to the Society in aiding it to carry on the
educational feature which now so largely enters into the work
of animal protection.

Contributions to the Society will be acknowledged in the
annual report.

its origin. The history of the Society, therefore, is practically
an account of the inception and development of the work of
animal protection in America.

In 1862 Mr. Bergh was appointed Secretary of Legation at
St. Petersburg. While in Russia he found himself on several
occasions constrained to interfere in cases of atrocious cruelty,
and but for his ofﬁcial position he would have been exposed, to
personal violence. His attention was thus directed to the sub-
ject of humanity to the brute creation, and while in London
on his way home in 1865, he made the acquaintance of
John Colam, Esq., Secretary of the Royal Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, who gave him much
valuable information concerning the operations of that Society
in England. On Mr. Bergh’s arrival at home, he found that
no similar society existed in this country, and he immediately
devoted himself to the establishment of a society for the
United States. At the outset the proposition met with little
encouragement, and, without the assistance of the press; it
might probably have failed. On February 8, 1866, Mr. Bergh
delivered a lecture in Clinton Hall, in which he pleaded his
cause with such force of argument and such warmth of elo-
quent conviction, that expressions of sympathy and offers of
assistance were freely made by persons in attendance. The
press then lent its powerful aid; the lecture was published in
whole or in part in all the great cities of the country; public
sentiment in favor of Mr. Bergh’s movement was quickly
aroused, and on April 10, I866, “ The American Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ” was incorporated by
the Legislature of the State of New York. Among the orig—
inal charter members ofthe Society were many of the most
eminent citizens of the City and State of New York.

On the 19th of April, in the same year, Mr. Bergh secured
the passage by the Legislature of New York of the ﬁrst law
ever enacted in this country for the protection of animals. It
provided that “ every person who shall, by his act or neglect,
maliciously kill, maim, wound, injure, torture, or cruelly beat

1895, Section 70.) This legislation recognizes the primacy
of The American Society. The Charter Act of 1866 does not
undertake to deﬁne with precision the powers to be exercised
by The American Society. But by Section 5 it empowers the
Society to enact a code of by-laws for the regulation and
management of its affairs not inconsistent with the laws of
the State or of the United States, which, when enacted, are to
have the force of law. The Society, under this authority, en-
acted by-laws, the second of which declares the objects of the
Society, viz.: “ To provide effective means for the prevention
of cruelty to animals throughout the United States; to enforce
all laws which are now, or may hereafter be, enacted for the
protection of animals; and to secure by lawful means the
arrest, conviction, and punishment of all persons violating
such laws,” etc. It will be noticed that the enforcement of
criminal laws relating to cruelty to animals is one of the ob-
jects speciﬁed. Speaking of The American Society, Judge
Earl said, in Davis vs. The American Society (75 N. Y., 362,
366): “ The purpose of the corporation was to. enforce the
laws enacted to prevent cruelty to animals.” The American
Society after its incorporation actively entered upon the work
for which it was incorporated, and the change wrought in
public sentiment and in the treatment of dumb animals, re-
placing cruelty by kindness patent to every observer, is due
largely to the work of The American Society. The original
charter of the Society was enacted solely for the protection
of animals. The protection of individuals and the public
against wandering, diseased and dangerous animals, es-
pecially dogs left to run at large upon the streets without
apparent ownership and uncared for, feeding upon the ﬁlthy
and often poisonous refuse of the cesspool and the gutter,
was not embraced within the original purpose of the charter.
In the City of New York and elsewhere this subject had been
left to municipal regulation, which had proved ineffective to
meet and prevent the discomfort and danger referred to. To
meet this exigency the Legislature passed the Act, Chapter

visions, and to interfere to prevent the perpetration of any
act of cruelty upon any animal in his presence.” It provides
that any of the societies may prefer complaints before any
court or magistrate having jurisdiction, “and may aid in
presenting the law or the facts before such court, tribunal or
magistrate in any proceeding taken.” The section concludes,
“ The ofﬁcers and agents of all duly incorporated societies for
prevention of cruelty to animals or children are hereby de-
clared to be peace ofﬁcers within the provisions of Section one
‘hundred and ﬁfty-four of the Code of Criminal Procedure.”
The work of The American Society in aiding the enforcement
of the Penal Code in respect to cruelty to animals, the sup-
pression of cock-ﬁghting, the protection of the public against
impure milk, and the suppression of other illegal practices,
has been vigorously pursued. The Society through its ofﬁcers-
and agents, as shown by its records, has aided in the prosecu-
tion of thousands of offenses against the Penal Code and
other statutory enactments for the protection of animals.
Such prosecutions have resulted in convictions for violations
of these statutes under every section of Title XVI of the
Penal Code, and its beneﬁcent work has secured the hearty
cooperation of the public authorities in the City of New
York. Under the dog-licensing act its work has been of the
greatest public utility. During the ﬁrst ﬁve and a half years
after the passage of Chapter II 5 0f the Laws of 1894 164,226
dogs and 315,645 cats, roaming at large in violation of the
Act, were seized in the City of New York and taken to the
shelter. In the year 1899 more than 25,000 dogs and 56,000
cats were seized under the authority of the Act, and larger
numbers in each year thereafter. The Society at great ex-
pense has provided shelters for the retention of lost, strayed,
and homeless animals, and for dogs and cats seized and held
for reclamation by the owners, or if not reclaimed pending the
time for their destruction. It maintains an ambulance service
and agents employed by day and night in the performance of
duties connected with the work of the Society. ’

ADDRESS OF THE PRESIDENT.

Laa’zes and Gentlemen .'

The year 1903, which is to be covered by the present
report, has been a time of serious and severe trial to nearly
all charitable associations in the city of New York. It is
reported on excellent authority that the managers of every
hospital in the city are confronted with a deﬁcit of thou-
sands of dollars in their receipts as compared with their
necessary expenditures. In some cases the amount is so
great as to cause serious embarrassment, and the total, so
far as reported, reaches the large sum of nearly half a mil-
lion of dollars. According to the best information I have
been able to obtain, a similar shrinkage of income has been
experienced in nearly, if not quite, all other charitable in-
stitutions. There is nothing strange in this fact, for the
year just ended will long be memorable in the annals of
American ﬁnance as a time in which a reaction from im—
moderate and unwise speculation plunged thousands of per-
sons into actual poverty and caused heavy loss to many
thousands of others, while the true conditions of prosperity
were fulﬁlled to a degree which, in normal circumstances.
ought to have caused a general as well as an absolute in—
crease of wealth. If our Society were entering on the new
year with a heavy deﬁcit on the expenses of the year just
closed, we should simply share a general misfortune, but I
have the great happiness to report that we have not only
been enabled to pay every dollar of the year’s expenses but

also to extinguish the last mortgage with which the Head-
quarters of the Society were burdened. Thus we are entering
on the New Year free from debt, and, for the ﬁrst time in our
corporate history, owning a building especially erected for our
own work, free and clear of all encumbrance.

I do not pretend to deny that the payment of this last
mortgage brings relief from a heavy and toilsome burden.
From the time when the Board of Managers resolved to
erect our present Headquarters I have never for a moment
doubted the wisdom of that measure. No one could have
quite so keen an appreciation as I had of the crippling in~
convenience with Which our work was done in rented
buildings, and hardly any one could be expected to appre~
ciate as I did the ultimate economy both of labor and of
money which could be secured by the possession of a build-
ing specially constructed for our uses. But besides all this,
there are other steps of progress to be made of which it
would have been folly to think until the foundations of the
Society, so to speak, should be so ﬁrmly and permanently
laid as to command public conﬁdence and respect. I therefore
heartily agreed with the opinion of the Board that, in the

permanent building, adapted to our present wants and capa-
ble of expansion to meet future requirements, would be a
measure of farsighted wisdom. At the same time, I could
not resent the hesitation with which that measure was re-
garded by some very earnest and sincere friends of our
Society and our cause. No one could deny that the under-
taking before us would be a venture of faith, calling for
courage as well as conﬁdence. To my own mind the ques-

tion to be decided was whether our faith was well founded;

but in View of the experience of the Society during many

years, and with certain elements of information in my own
personal and ofﬁcial possession, I could have no doubt on
that point. In the years that have elapsed since then, I

 

 

 

 

 

 




 

 

 

 

7

confess there have been times when difﬁculties and un-
expected discouragements have made it difﬁcult to main-
tain the buoyancy of hopeful resolution with which our
enterprise had been begun. Yet, on the whole, we have
been wonderfully sustained, and now that the work is done,
we can look back to its beginning with a full conviction
that it would have been a folly and a weakness not to under-
take it.

Among those whose wise counsels, earnest faith and un-
failing sympathy for many years past I recall with grati-
tude, is one whom death has recently taken from our num-
ber. Frederic René Coudert died in Washington, D. C., on
December 20, 1903. He was born on March I, 1832, and
was therefore in his seventy—second year. He was gradu-
ated with the highest honors of Columbia College at the
early age of eighteen. At twenty—one he 'was admitted to
the Bar and began a professional career of more than ﬁfty
years, in which he won the highest honors open to a jurist.
Among his clients he could number the greatest mercantile
and ﬁnancial institutions of Europe and America. He was
a distinguished delegate to the International Congress on
the Law of Nations at Antwerp in 1877. He was counsel
for the United States in the Behring Sea Fur Seal contro-
versy before the International Commission in Paris in
1893—95. He was also a member of the Venezuelan Boun-
dary Commission in 1896 and 1898. Political ofﬁce he
neither sought nor desired; and he declined a seat on the
bench of the Supreme Court of the United States when it
was offered to him by President Cleveland. At the time
of his death the law ﬁrm of Coudert Brothers was so ex-
tensively engaged in the practice of international law as
to have ofﬁces not only in New York but in Washington,
Paris, Havana and Manila, and its services were retained
by half a dozen European governments. While engaged
in business of such magnitude and variety, Mr. Coudert
might easily have excused himself from participating in

 




 

 

 

8 -
l benevolent and charitable public works, but he Was not a
l man to decline to bear his full share of any public or pri-
vate duty. In our own Society he felt and expressed
the deepest interest. He became a member of the So~
ciety and Board of Managers in 1889, and one of its vice«
presidents in 1901. It was impossible for him to be regu-
larly present at the meetings of the Board, but on all occa-
sions of great importance he made it a point to be present
if it were possible to do so. Calm in counsel, stable in judg-
ment, always courteous in manner and address, the inﬂu-
ence which he might justly have commanded was cheer.-
fully conceded by the affectionate respect of his associates.
In the whole discussion connected with the now completed
project of building our present Headquarters, Mr. Coudert .
was steadfast and consistent in maintaining that it ought
to be done, and done without delay. The Board of Man-
, agers will doubtless adopt a suitable minute on the heavy
1 loss which our Society sustains in Mr. Coudert’s death, and
I am sure that we shall all fervently unite in the prayer
which would have been most acceptable to himself, Requie-
l ‘ scat in pace.
I have already hinted that there are extensions of the
T scope of our work, as well as enlargements and improve-
ments in its methods, to which we may n0W 100k forward
with hopeful expectation. The Board of ManagerS may
, safely be trusted to take all such matters under favorable
l . consideration at the proper time. It would be ill-advised,
however, to anticipate the action of the Board by indicating
their probable character at this time. For the present it
must sufﬁce to say that there will be neither undue haste
nor indolent rest in the movement of our Society. We re-
jo-ice to know that it has done some things which no other
sOciety in the world has ever undertaken. We are glad to
believe that it has done those things reasonably well. But
we make no pretence of perfection. We have to learn,
sometimes through our o‘wn mistakes; and what we have

 

 

 

 

 

 




 

 

9

learned is opening the way to larger work, and better, than
we have ever yet done. These remarks are peculiarly ap-‘
plicable to the local work of the Society in the city and
State of .New York. But there is another aspect of our
Society itself which we cannot consent to overlook, and to
which we hope to give even more attention in the future.
A few words on that point may not be altogether amiss in
this place.

Our corporate name, adopted by Mr. Bergh and his asso-
ciates in 1866, is “ The American Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals.” The introduction of that word
“American” was no matter of chance or fancy. It was
deliberate, and it was intended to express the purpose of
the Society which should bear that name. Mr. Bergh never
intended this to be a merely local society. He intended it,
as far as possible, to take the same place, and to perform
the same functions, in this country which the Royal Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals then performed
and still performs in Great Britain, not merely, nor even
chieﬂy, in local activities for the prevention of cruelty, but
in the establishment of local societies in all parts of the
country, and in the propagation of humane sentiments
throughout the World. As it was no part of Mr. Bergh’s
plan to c0nﬁne the activities of the American Society to the
city or State of New York, so neither was it any part of his
purpose that local societies in other places should be in any
way subordinate to or dependent on the American Society.
Mr. Bergh knew the American character much too well for
that. He knew that in this country independence is an in—
dispensable condition of activity in all good works; and he
knew that the American system of Federated States, each
governed by its own legislature, makes it peculiarly neces—
saryIthat the friends of animal protection in the different
States should operate independently of each other as their
several circumstances may require in the prosecution of their
common work. To meddle or to interfere with bona ﬁde

 




  

 

 

 

 

 

 

IO

societies actively engaged in the prevention of cruelty to
animals never entered into Mr. Bergh’s head. It was by
the propagation of such societies, and by cordial coopera-
tion with them on all proper occasions, that he hoped to
justify the American name which he chose for our Society.

That policy of. our founder has never for a moment been

abandoned; and now we have the satisfaction to know that,

in the United States of America, there are no fewer than

233 local societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals.

The American Society does not pretend to have created

those societies; but if the Royal Society for the protection

of animals in Great Britain has the satisfaction to know
that, without the inspiration of its own good example, Mr.
Bergh might never have thought of taking up the same
cause in this country, so we of the Society which he founded
here have an equal right to rejoice in the thought that his
good example in the founding of the American Society has
inspired and stimulated others to engage in the same good
work in other parts of our common country. In that sense,
though in that sense only, the Royal Society in England
can justly claim to be the parent society for the protection
of animals throughout the world, and, in the same ‘sense,
though in no other, the Society which Mr. Bergh founded
and proudly called the American Society may be rightly
counted as the parent society for the protection of animals
in this country. . This is a claim which every generous-
minded lover of animals will readily concede; and it is a
claim which truth and loyalty to the memory of our revered
founder constrain us to assert.

We admit that the possession of such a name implies a
corresponding duty on the part of those whose privilege it
is to bear it; and without undue pretension we may fairly
claim that our position has enabled us to justify our Amer--
ican name in not a few effective ways. Some, it must be
confessed, are less pleasing than others. More than once
it has fallen to our lot to defend the cause of animal protec—

in that way, and we had agents actively at work with such
effect that no cruelty would have been possible without our
having evidence sufﬁcient to secure the punishment of the
offender. What was the result? \Vhy this, that instead of
three hundred riders there were only nine, and the horses
were not ridden to death as they would otherwise have
been.

Another long-distance race which was planned to take
place from Deadwood to Omaha was prevented altOgether,
and not a man could be found who was willing to confess
that he had ever been connected 'with the scheme.

Eleven years ago it was publicly announced that arrange-
ments had been made to produce the disgusting spectacle of
a bull~fight at a State fair in Alabama. Preparations for it
were complete; but through the action of the American
Society calling the attention of the Mobile Society to the
projected outrage, the exhibition was abandoned.

Quite recently, a very few women of Stamford, Connecti-
cut, publicly advertised their in‘tention to hold a Cat Tour-
nament in which the cat destroying the largest number of
mice in a given time should receive a prize. One of these

women made herself unenviably notorious by her advocacy
of the scheme and by her insolent ridicule of all who ob-
jected to it. The exhibition did not take place, and the
projectors of it, retiring under a storm of public indigna-
tion, Were fain to pretend that they had meant nothing but
a hoax upon the public. It is hardly likely that they will
attempt another hoax of that kind; and in view of that fact,
our Society can well afford to disregard the malicious vitu-
peration with which its “interference ” was resented.

Within the past year a cocking—main was proposed to be
held near Louisville, Kentucky. A brief letter from this
Society to the Governor of Kentucky and another to the
President of the local society in Louisville prevented its
occurrence.

Within less than one month a similar event was an.-

 

 




 

"i 3

'nOunced to take place near Birmingham, Alabama. A note
to his Excellency, Governor Jelks, prevented that.

If it Were worth while I might prolong this list indeﬁ-
nitely; but these instances will be sufﬁcient to illustrate a
class, and also the method of our Society in dealing with
them. Our rule is always, in every instance, to secure the
action of the local society if such society exists; and many
a case occurs in which local societies are ﬁrst apprised by
us of acts of cruelty, committed or to be committed, in their
own vicinity. Where there is no local society, or where,
for any reason, it cannot act efﬁciently, we immediately
Work through the proper state or municipal authority, and
never yet without a satisfactory result. W

Our relations with the ofﬁcers of the Federal Government
have been frequent and most gratifying. During the war
with Spain we had every assurance that all possible care
would be taken for the avoidance of preventable suffering
to army horses and mules. After the occupation of Porto
Rico and Cuba we had the best evidence that American in-
ﬂuence had been immediately applied to the abolition of
certain characteristic forms of cruelty which had previously
prevailed. Even in the Philippines we have had the satis-
faction to know that the authorities have not forgotten the
cause of the defenceless brute creation; and last, though
not least, the United States of America has this distinction
among all the nations of the earth, that a standing order
from the staff headquarters requires a veterinary surgeon
or other competent person to be detailed for the speedy
destruction and relief of horses wounded in battle.

I mention these things with no purpose or feeling of
boastfulness. Very far from that. All we have done is
little in comparison with what remains to be done. But I
do think that we may fairly claim to have justiﬁed the Amer-
ican Name which is borne by our Society; and I am certain
that we have been faithful to the American Idea of local in-
dependence in all local concerns. That a time is coming

when still larger measures may be accomplished by a wise

combination of local energies, I do not doubt; but until the

true interest of our cause shall be made supreme over all
petty schemes of self-advertisement, I regret to think that
no such combination can be made effectual.

I have only one other point to make in an address which
is already too long. I refer to the incalculable value of the
magazine of the Society, OUR ANIMAL FRIENDS. It is not
published for proﬁt, and yet I do not hesitate to say that it
has brought enormous returns for every dollar expended
in its production and distribution. That magazine reaches
thousands of persons unknown to me or to any other mem-
ber of the Society. To my certain knowledge it has brought
directly into our treasury in one single year more than its
publication has cost in the past ten years of its existence.

Of its usefulness in other respects as an educational organ,
I need not speak because it speaks for itself; but I wish to
say with all plainness that, either directly or indirectly, it
is one of the most valuable agencies in our possession. A
mar/zed copy distributed to the press has often had the ef-
fect of putting some important matter before millions of
readers. Urn/marked, its contents are often copied by the
daily press, to the no small advantage of our cause. In
many other ways which I might mention its value has been

amply demonstrated, but I will say no more on that sub-

ject except to commend it to your more careful attention,

and to add that, in its new form, I think you will ﬁnd it

attractive.

Ladies and Gentlemen, it is almost painful to say that,
although our membership is more numerous than ever be-
fore, the roll contains not more than about eighteen hundred
names. In response to my appeal last year that every mem-
ber should secure another member there was some con—
siderable increase, one lady ﬁnding it easy within her 0W“
circle to enlist no fewer than one hundred recruits. I repeat
that appeal, and I repeat it urgently. But why should every

 
  
   

 

 

 

 




 

15

member secure only one other? If every one would secure
ﬁve, and if that ratio were kept up only two or three years,
we should then have a constituency such as I am proud to
think that The American Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals deserves to have.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

 

The Address of the President and the Repcrts of the Treas—
urer and Superintendent, printed elsewhere in this report, so
thoroughly cover the operations of the Society during the
past year that there remains little for me to add.

It must be very gratifying to the friends of our cause to
read the Address of the President, in which he has the pleasure
of informing them of the increased prosperity and usefulness
of the organization over which he presides. It is a cause for
congratulation that the Society has entered upon the new year
better equipped than ever before to ﬁght the battle against
cruelty and injustice to God’s humbler creatures.

By the appointment of additional Special Agents to operate
in localities not heretofore represented, and by the incorpora-
tion of new societies at various points throughout the United
States, the work of animal protection has been largely ex-
tended, and by a steadily growing membership new people
have been brought into closer touch with our work.

The only change in the personnel of the Board of Managers
during the past year was occasioned by the death of Mr.
Frederic R. Coudert.

The Obituary Record, printed elsewhere in this report, con-
tains the names of thirty—one members, workers in the cause
of animal protection, whose loss the Society has been called on

to mourn during the year.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT.

r

The following report of the work of the Society, in the
enforcement of the humane laws of the State and the alle-
viation of animal suffering, only brieﬂy sets forth part of what
has been accomplished during the past year.

Reference can only be made in a general way to the many
different phases of animal abuse with which the Society has
to deaL

Ninety per cent. of complaints of acts of cruelty to
animals are not prosecuted for the reason that the alleged
cruelty is of such a triﬂing nature as not to warrant such
procedure, and while I do not wish to be understood in the.
sense of discouraging well—meaning people from reporting
cases of animal abuse, I may be pardoned for suggesting
that citizens be not too hasty in their conclusions as to
whether the act is one of wanton cruelty, or is owing to a
lack of judgment on the part of the offender.

It frequently happens that citizens cause the arrest of
drivers, for what the former consider cruelty. To illus-
trate, a complaint is received which reads as follows:

“ The horse was sick and unﬁt for use, could not pull the
load, and the driver beat the animal most cruelly.”

The offender, by order of the citizen, is arrested by a police
ofﬁcer, and taken to the nearest magistrate’s court. Court
may be closed for the day—prisoner is then taken to the
station house, where he is kept, unless bailed out, till the
next morning, when he is again taken to court. When his
case is called, no complainant appears, and the prisoner is
discharged. In the meantime, the horse has been examined
by a veterinary surgeon, and found in good condition—no

 




 

237 1

marks of beating, the load weighed and found to be less
than the weight of the empty vehicle, the whip used of the
ordinary kind.

Now, to sum up; the driver is in prison all night, the
horse, wagon and contents placed in livery, at expense of
the owner; complainant failed to appear in court and the
’ proceedings are dismissed.

Such acts on the part of citizens, although done in good
faith, tend to bring about unfair criticism as to the methods
of the Society, for it is always assumed that the Society is
instrumental in bringing the proceedings, when, as a mat—
ter of fact, it has no knowledge of the case until after it has
reached the police court.

If people interested in our Work would discriminate wisely
and not act hastily, much practical good would be accon ~
plished. Drivers are but human, and p“ a kind word turneth
away wrath.” Advice here, a 'word Of warning there, will
do more to prevent abuse to animals than the arrest of the
individual.

STABLES.

That the general public are more active in giving expres-
sion to their interest in animal protection, goes without
saying, and owners as well as custodians realize that owner—
ship does not carry with it the right to abuse or neglect
their animals, no matter of what species.

Our efforts toward the amelioration of the sanitary con—
ditions of underground, ill-ventilated stables and other
places where horses and mules are housed, have been, to
some extent, successful in causing such places to be‘made
more comf01table and less dangerous in case of ﬁre. The
opposition aroused by our inspection of so— —called stables is
most surprising ;many places have been found where it would
be impossible for a single animal to be rescued in case of ﬁre,
yet the owners or lessees of such ploperties strenuously ob-
jected to making improvements, for the only reason that

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24

would cost too much.” Such obstinacy we have overcome in
some instances by moral suasion, and in other cases by ap-
pealing to the law.

OVERLOADI N G.

The cruelty of overloading is not done through ignor-
ance, but for mercenary motives, and the suffering imposed
upon a horse by compelling it to haul a load beyond its
physical strength is inhuman. And strange as it may seem,
such cases are the most difﬁcult to convict, for drivers when
charged with overloading plead that the horse was “balky.”
In cases, however, where it is found practicable to weigh the
load, and it is found to be excessive, the punishment is very
severe. In cases where no arrests are made, our Special
Agents compel drivers to take off part of the load, or else
get extra horses.

GLA NDERS AND FARCY.

Several unscrupulous horse dealers were prosecuted and
convicted, during the past year, for exposing and attempt-
ing to sell animals afﬂicted with farcy or glanders, which
diseases are fatal alike to man and beast. In every. case
severe punishment was imposed of ﬁne or imprisonment.

POI SON IN G.

In spite of the vigilance of our Special Agents, many cases
of horse poisoning were reported, and although every effort
Was made to secure evidence sufﬁciently convincing to in-
sure conviction of the perpetrators, several prosecutions had
to be discontinued, owing to treachery or perjured testi—
mony on the part of the People’s witnesses. Several of—
fenders, however, have been proven guilty and sentenced
to terms of imprisonment of from three months to one year
in the Penitentiary.

offered, but no one offers to do anything for the relief of
the animal. Our Special Agent makes an examination, and
ﬁnds it injured past recovery; thereupon the suffering animal
is humanely destroyed. Arriving ﬁnally at the court, he is
informed that his case has been adjourned owing to his
absence. And so it goes on day after day.

It might be supposed that the introduction of motor vehicles
has diminished the employment of animals to some extent.
This is true, but only in so far as it relates to the use of ani-
mals in large cities.

The streets being covered with asphalt, cause the thor—
oughfares to become slippery and dangerous for horses, not
only during the winter months, but in summer as well,
when the streets are sprinkled with water. Hence the
employment of mechanical power is most desirable.

The change in systems, however, does not diminish the
work of our Special Agents, owing to the fact that much ser-
vice is being rendered in outlying sections of the city, where
large numbers of horses and mules are employed. These
animals are very often in charge of ignorant drivers, who
have no compassion for their dumb servants, and treat them
most Cruelly. Our Special Agents, when visiting the places
‘ referred to, have arrested drivers and owners while in the
act of beating horses on the head, either with the butt end
of a whip, shovel or pick—handle, whichever was most
handy, because the poor beasts were unable to haul loaded
vehicles out of the ruts into which the load had sunk up to
the hubs.

It would consume too much space in this report to enu-
merate the many and various acts of cruelty inﬂicted upon
animals, but in order to illustrate, the following few typical
cases will sufﬁce:

Police Ofﬁcer Driscoll was patrolling his post, when he
saw one George Holmes strike avhorse on the back with a.

 




 

cart rung. The blow was very severe and staggered the
animal, so that it almost fell to the ground. Ofﬁcer Dris-r
l coll inquired what was the reason for the blow, and the
[ defendant replied that he was bound to make the horse

the offence would lead to his arrest. This he ignored, and
I struck another blow. He was promptly arrested, subsev
f quently convicted and sentenced to pay a ﬁne of twenty-ﬁve
l dollars or be imprisoned for ten days.

Frank White, a truckman, engaged in drawing material to
a building in the course of erection, got angry at his horse
because the latter moved .a few steps beyond the place of
destination. -7 After abusing the horse in divers \ways, the
hf defendant took an iron wrench, which was used for the pur-
f' pose of elevating the truck, in order to dump the load, and
. l - struck the animal several violent blows on the body. A

lady passing at the time remonstrated with the offender for
y I his cruel act, but her remonstrances were received with

 

derision and insults. Finally meeting a police ofﬁcer,
William E. Hall, she told him of the case, and he returned
with her and arrested White. He was tried in the Court
H 1 5 of. Special Sessions, found guilty and sentenced to pay a ﬁne
/ - « of twenty~ﬁve dollars or be imprisoned for ten days. Presid—
l 5 ing Judge Olmsted said that if it had not been for the de-
l l fendant’s previous good character he would have sent him to
f prison instead of imposing a ﬁne.

Dan McHugh of East New York, Brooklyn, shot a goat
with a gun loaded with buckshot. He was arrested for the
offence, and at his trial claimed that the goat trespassed
upon his farm and destroyed a small quantity of vegetables.
He denied the shooting, however, but neighbors swore they
saw him ﬁre off the gun at the goat. These witnesses were
standing in the road at the time, unobserved by the de—
fendant. The animal was terribly mangled and died from
the effects of the wound. Defendant was found guilty, and
sentenced to pay a ﬁne of twenty dollars by the Court of
Special Sessions, Second Division.

Samuel Thornton was convicted in the Court of Special
Sessions, First Division, of having stabbed a horse in the
body with a three-pronged pitchfork. It appeared in the
evidence that the defendant was drunk on the morning
when he committed the act, and had assaulted several of
his fellow employés. After being ordered from the prem—
ises, he returned, and chased several of the horses into the
stable, frightening the animals so that one of them ran into
the wrong stall. Thornton seized the pitchfork, and saying
with an oath, “I’ll make you‘ go into your own stall,”
plunged the weapOn into its body. The sentence of the
Court upon his conviction was imprisonment in the Peni—
tentiary for three months.

To mention each case of animal suffering alleviated, or
humanely ended, might seem exaggerated, yet not a day
or night passes but our Agents are called upon to render
aid to injured or sick animals of one kind or another.

Cats have been rescued from dangerous places in trees,
etc., where they have been chased by vicious boys or dogs.
Horses, dogs, mules, cows and other animals found unshel—
tered, were taken care of and properly provided for.

Quantities of nails, broken glass and other articles liable
to cause injury to animals have been removed from streets.

 

 

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

THE FOLLOWING ARE A FEW OF THE CASES
PROSECUTED DURING THE YEAR 1903,512-
LECTED WITH SOME VIEW To SHOWING
THE DIFFERENT PHASES OF CRUELTY
WITH WHICH THE SOCIETY HAS TO CON-
TEND:

 

 

POLICE OFFICER JOSEPH UNGER, of the Fifteenth Precinct, was called
upon by a poor woman who, with considerable agitation, begged him
to follow her to arrest a man for driving a sore and exhausted horse.
3 In her opinion, the animal was quite unable to pull the heavily loaded
3 3. 3 3‘ wagon to which he was attached. The ofﬁcer being guided to the scene,
3 l. he found the horse’s condition as bad as the woman had described.

3 3 3 The" horse was immediately unharnessed and given shelter in a nearby

 

 

 

:} 3 ‘ ‘3 stable, where it was placed under the care of a veterinary surgeon.
3313‘ 33‘ 3 . The offender, Vincent Go‘mbardi, was arraigned before Justice Joseph

‘ ‘ “ 1 Pool, of the Fourth District Court, and held in $500 bail for trial at
3 the Court of Special Sessions.

 

, 333 3 2‘3 -' CITY MAGISTRATE LORENZO ZELLER caused the arrest of John Daley
3 3 by Police Ofﬁcer Harvey H. Ware, of the Thirty-second Precinct, for
the offense of attempting to drive a wretched horse, so lame, weak,
3 3, and emaciated that several livery stablemen refused even to allow the
3‘l 31 animal to be taken into their stables. Daley was detained at the Thirty-
33 second Precinct, to be arraigned later before Magistrate Zeller at the
3 l 3‘ Fifth District Court, and was held in $100 bail to answer. At the trial
3 3; the magistrate himself will appear as a witness against the prisoner.
“3 3‘ . The defendant was advised to have the animal destroyed, and he ﬁnally

3 consented to that act of humanity being performed by an ofﬁcer of
the Society.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 3
333 ~ THE Society’s Special Agent at Smithville South, Nassau County,
3 arrested Eugene Mitthauer, bringing him before Justice Tatum on the
3 charge of having neglected to provide food and drink for a horse.
’ 33‘ When found by the ofﬁcer of the Society, the animal was in a dying
33 condition. Its life was mercifully ended by the ofﬁcer.

 

 




 

37

ON the charge of cruelty to animals, the Society’s Special Agent at
Yonkers, N. Y., arrested Presto Gaddy, a truck-driver of the city of
New York. Gaddy’s heavy truck was drawn by a team of horses, one
of which had a sore on the off shoulder, constantly chafed by the
collar. At the City Court, Justice Kellogg imposed a ﬁne of $20, which
was paid by the offender, in preference to the alternative of ten days
in jail.

ON the charge of cruelty to animals, the Society’s Special Agent
arrested John Terwigillger, at Mt. Vernon, N. Y., as the horse which
was drawing his milk wagon was found to have a sore on its back
measuring two by two inches, and unprotected from the chaﬁng of the
harness. The offender explained that at the time of leaving the
stable the sore was healed over, the injury being only a gall. Justice
Gescheidt of the City Court discharged the man, with a reprimand,
further advising him to pad, or in some other way to ease the collar
and the harness of the horse.

AT Fifth Avenue and Fourteenth Street, New York, Louis Cohen
was arrested for driving a horse which was utterly exhausted and
unﬁt for work. While being led to a near-by stable the animal fell.
It was then taken to the New York Veterinary Hospital in an am-
bulance. Cohen, who was held in $100 bail, was tried by Justices
Hinsdale, Mayer and McKeon, of the Court of Special Sessions, First
Division; but although Cohen pleaded guilty sentence in his case was
suspended, and a warrant was issued for the arrest of Brodsky, owner
of the horse. Cohen was warned by Justice Hinsdale that if he failed
to appear against his employer he would be rearrested. Brodsky was
found guilty of having caused and permitted the horse to be used.
He was sentenced to pay the ﬁne of $50, with the alternative of ﬁfteen
days in the city prison. Brodsky paid the ﬁne.

FOR driving a horse before a loaded truck while the animal was
lame from a spavin, and was also suffering from a large sore on the
withers, James T. Colligan was arraigned before City Magistrate
Robert C. Cornell, of the First District Court, and held in $200 bail to
answer at the Court of Special Sessions, First Division. While the
defendant pleaded guilty to the charge of cruelty in using the horse,
the Court suspended sentence because of the earnest appeal for mercy
from the complaining witness, who testiﬁed that Colligan was very
poor. Justices Wyatt, Hinsdale and Holbrook dismissed the prisoner
with the caution that he should not use the horse again, but should

. have it immediately destroyed. The horse was'humanely put to death
‘3 without delay.

 

 

33 ‘ FOR driving a very lame horse to a loaded truck, Tony Schmitt, of
Brooklyn, New York, was arrested by an ofﬁcer of the Society. When
seen by the ofﬁcer, the horse was barely able to hobble along. Schmitt
and the owner of the horse, Fred Lindau, were arraigned at the First
District Court, before City Magistrate Edward J. Dooley, and held for
$100 bail to be tried by the Court of Special Sessions, Second Division.
‘3 l3, , Justices Fleming, F orker and Keady, of the Court of Special Sessions,
13 3 I found Schmitt guilty of cruelty in driving the horse in its wretched
, 3 . , condition; but sentence in this case was suspended, Fred Lindau, the
3 3 i : 3 owner, being charged with the offence of having caused and permitted
‘ 3 l ‘ the driver, Schmitt, to use the horse when the animal was unﬁt for

FOR working a sore and lame -horse in deﬁance of several warnings
3 against using the animal, the Society’s Special Agent, at Richmond
3' Hill, arrested Lewis Johnson while Johnson was forcing the horse to
3 - haul a wagon loaded with stone. Despite the prisoner’s denial that
, he was aware of even the lameness of the horse, he was arrested on
3'3 the charge of cruelty to animals. Justices Fleming, Keady and Forker,
33 of the Court of Special Sessions, Second Division, found the prisoner
.3 guilty, and ﬁned him ten dollars.

 

for cruel treatment of his horse. Brought before Magistrate Cornell,
of the First District Court, Whittaker was held in $300 bail. The
complaining witness, Edward D. Cain, at ﬁrst asked leave of the Court
to withdraw his complaint; but .when the Court insisted that he should
tell why- he had cause-d the arrest, he further admitted that the animal
had been most cruelly beaten, its mouth jerked, and the lip cut. In
extenuation Whittaker pleaded that he had been drinking. He was,
, however, found guilty by Justices Wyatt, Olmsted and Holbrook, of
3, the Court of Special Sessions, First Division, by whom he was ﬁned
33:3 3 ten dollars, with the alternative of ﬁve days’ imprisonment.

time the driver, with the help of bystanders, urged the wretched
creature to stand, and when, a second time it dropped to the ground
refusing‘to attempt to rise, O’Connor beat it with a plank so that one
of the witnesses to the cruelty at once had the man arrested. With
merciful promptness the Society sent an ofﬁcer to destroy the horse.
O’Connor was then arraigned before City Magistrate Charles A...
Flammer, of the First District Court, and was held for trial by the
Court of Special Sessions, First Division, where Justices McKean,
Olmsted and Holbrook found the prisoner guilty and sentenced him
to pay the ﬁne of thirty—ﬁve dollars, with the alternative of ﬁfteen
days in jail. \ .

FOR driving a horse with a sore under the saddle, Gus Williams was
arrested by the Society’s Special Agent at Mamaroneck, N. Y., and
arraigned before Justice P. Kane, of Mamaroneck District Court.
Williams was found guilty and was ﬁned $10. He paid the ﬁne.

FOR driving a weak and tottering horse to a heavily loaded "wagon
Pasquale Marzullo was arrested by an ofﬁcer of the Society, the ofﬁcer,
on closer examination of the wretched horse, ﬁnding a sore measuring
four by two inches on its back unprotected from the constant chaﬁng
of the harness. Marzullo was arraigned before City Magistrate Peter
F. Barlow, of the Second District Court. There the man declared
that he had been ordered by his employer, Fortunato Varrialo, to
use the horse and that he had no choice but to obey. The Magistrate
at once issued a warrant for the arrest of Varrialo. On being con-
fronted with his employer in Court, however, Marzullo broke down,
retracting his statement that Varrialo had ordered him to drive the
horse while knowing of its condition. Varrialo, he then admitted, was
ignorant of the fact that anything was wrong with the horse. Mar-
zullo was held for trial by the Court of Special Sessions.

AT Little Falls, N. Y., Charles Carson was arrested for cutting off
a cat’s tail with a pair of nippers. He pleaded guilty before Justice
F iekes, of Fort Plain District Court, and paid the ﬁne of $3.

ON the charge of having unjustiﬁably shot a shepherd dog, be-
longing to Clifford Dunland, of Goshen, New York, Jacob Kilmer was ,
arraigned before Justice Wyser of the Goshen District Court. The
offender was found guilty and was sentenced to pay the ﬁne of $25..
In default of payment he was consigned for twenty-ﬁve days to the
county jail.

the cat. After a time the cat’s cries were heard, and the Society was
notiﬁed of what had happened. An agent of the Society was sent to
release the cat. The iron beam, then in position, was about one story
above the sidewalk, and the cat’s pitiful cries could be distinctly
heard. With the assistance of the bricklayers, the Society's agent
removed several of the bricks, calling to the animal, which refused
to come out. Food and drink were supplied it for the night. Early
next morning more bricks were removed, but still the cat refused to
come within reach of rescuing hands. Finally the owner, an elderly
woman, Mrs. A. Coakley, who lives near the building, was assisted in‘
her efforts to climb a ladder which brought her within reach of the
opening in the brick wall. At the sound of its mistress’s voice the
cat sprang to her arms to be carried triumphantly home. It had been
imprisoned for twenty-four hours.

FOR striking a horse on the nose with a pair of ice tongs which
made two wounds, an inch and two inches in length, respectively,
Myron F. Mattesson was arrested on the complaint of a citizen who
witnessed the cruelty. Mattesson was in the employ of the American
Ice Company as driver on one of their wagons. At the trial, however,
the complaining witness failed to appear, so that the prisoner was dis-
charged.

FOR driving a horse with a rope tied around its tail and drawn
between the hind legs so tightly as to cause a wound about eight inches
long and four inches wide, Joseph Seigel was arrested by Police
Oﬁicer Muller of the Twelfth Precinct. At the trial by the Court of
Special Sessions, First Division, Justices McKean, Olmsted and H01-
brook presiding, Seigel was found guilty and was ﬁned $50.

FOR failing to provide proper shelter for his horse, Adolph Pfeifer,
of Setauket, Long Island, N. Y., was arrested by the Society’s Special
Agent, and was tried by jury at the Justice’s Court of East Setauket.
Pfeifer was found guilty and was sentenced to pay the ﬁne of $5. In
discharge of his duty of carrying the United States mail to and from
the several post ofﬁces Of the township, Pfeifer used two horses which
he lodged under a few boards nailed slantwise against an outbuilding,
so that the animals were exposed on all sides to the weather through-
out the year. On several occasions the defendant had been warned
that he would be prosecuted if he did not provide properly for the
horses. Neglecting the warning, he was ﬁnally prosecuted.

freberic 1René Goubert

At a meeting of the Board of Managers of The American
Soc1ety for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, held at its
Headquarters in the City of New York, Thursday, January 14,
1904, President Haines announced the decease, on December 20,
1903, of Frederic René Coudert, one of the Vice—Presidents of
the Society.

The Board thereupon unanimously directed the following
record to be made in their minutes of their sorrow for his loss
and respect for his memory:

The members of this Board are called upon to mourn the loss
of Prederic René Coudert, whom death has recently taken from
their number, and whose wise counsels, earnest faith and unfail-
ing sympathy for many years past they recall with gratitude.

Mr. Coudert died in Washington, D. C., on December 20,
1903, at the age of seventy-one years.

He was graduated with the highest honors of Columbia Col-
lege at the early age of eighteen. At twenty-one he was ad—
mitted to the Bar and began a professional career of more
than half a century, in which he won the highest honors open
to a Jurist. Among his clients he could number the great
mercantile and ﬁnancial institutions of Europe and America.
He was a distinguished delegate to the International Congress
on the Law of Nations at Antwerp in 1877. He was counsel
for the United States in the Behring Sea Fur Seal controversy
before the International Commission in Paris in 1893-95. He

was also a member of the Venezuelan Boundary Commission in
1896 and 1898. Political ofﬁce he neither sought nor desired;
and he declined a seat on the bench of the Supreme Court of
the United States when it was offered to him by President
Cleveland. At the time of his death the law ﬁrm of Coudert
Brothers was so extensively engaged in the practice of inter—
national law as to have ofﬁces not only in New York but in
Washington, Paris, Havana and Manila, and its services were
retained by half a dozen European governments. While en-
gaged in business of such magnitude and variety, Mr. Coudert
might easily have excused himself from participating in benev-
olent and charitable public w0rks, but he was not a man to
decline to bear his full share of any public or private duty,
and in our own Society he felt and expressed the deepest in—
terest. He became a member of the Society and of the Board
of Managers in 1889, and one of its vice-presidents in 1901. t

was impossible for h

of the Board, but on all occasions of great importance he made

it a point to be there if it were possible. Calm 1n counsel,
stable in judgment, courteous in manner and address, the in-
ﬂuence which he might justly have commanded was cheerfully
conceded by the affectionate respect of his assoc1ates.
Resolved, That the foregoing minute be adopted by the

Board of Managers and be spread at length on the records 0

the Society, and that a copy be sent to Mrs. Coudert, and also

be published in the daily press.

im to be regularly present at the meetings .

peals in the Fox case, based upon the construction of the ﬁfth
section of Chapter 448 of the Laws of 1896, has been elimi-
nated as to The American Society by the amendment of the
ﬁfth section of Chapter 115 of the Laws of 1894 by the Act
of 1,902. The original section ﬁve in the two Acts of 1894 and
1896 were in identical language. The Court of Appeals held
that it permitted the Society to harbor unlicensed dogs and
keep them at its pleasure without obtaining a license. This
the court held was the grant of an exclusive privilege in con~
travention of the Constitution. The Court said: “The de-
fendant can keep any dog it sees ﬁt and is not required to
pay anything for the privilege. N 0 one else in the community
can keep a dog without paying a dollar a year for the privi-
lege. . . . We think this an exclusive privilege con-
demned by the Constitution.” Again on page 526 the opinion,
after stating that under the Act then in question the Society
was not required to kill unlicensed dogs, proceeds: “It is
contended that the statute was enacted to exterminate home-
less, wandering or diseased dogs, which may be a source of
great danger to life and health. If the statute prescribed
action appropriate to effect such result the work directed
to be done in pursuance of it might be well termed govern—
mental and a very different question presenter.” The ﬁfth
section of the Act of 1894, as amended by the ﬁfth section
of the Act of 1902, completely removes the objection of
special privilege, and that the work of the Society is not
governmental. It makes it imperative on The American
Society to destroy all unlicensed dogs seized after the tem—
porary detention permitted to give opportunity for their
reclamation. The Society cannot harbor {them within the
meaning of the statute nor keep a kennel nor sell them.
They are irrevocably devoted to destruction unless reclaimed
within the brief period allowed by the owner. The language
of the amended section is: “Section 5. Dogs not licensed
pursuant to the provisions of this Act shall be seized, and if
not claimed and redeemed. within forty-eight hours thereafter

in the Fox case, which expressly overruled the opinion of
the Appellate~Division that the Act of 1896, which conferred
power upon the ofﬁcers and agents of the Mohawk and Hud-
son River Humane Society identical with those conferred
upon the“ ofﬁcers and agents of The American Society, was
unconstitutional in that it assumed to vest in the defendant
the execution of certain police powers of the State, and in
effect constituted it a public ofﬁcer. “ The decision below,”
said the Court of Appeals, “ cannot be upheld on this ground.”
The only new question upon this branch of the case arises
as to the validity of the provision in Section 668 of the Penal
Code, which authorizes any agent or ofﬁcer of The American
Society to arrest and bring before the court or magistrate
having jurisdiction any person offending against the provi-
sions of Title XVI of the Penal Code, and the provision in the
same section which declares that the “ofﬁcers and agents
are hereby declared to be peace ofﬁcers within the provisions
of Section 154 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.” It has
been decided that the Legislature may authorize arrests by
ofﬁcers Without warrant for misdemeanors committed in
their presence other than such as amount to breaches of the
peace (Burrows vs. Eastman, 101 Mich. 419), and in this State
this power exists without. special legislative authority (I7
How. Pr. 101. See also Stage Horse cases, 15 Abb. Pr., N.
S. 62). At common law a private person may arrest for felony
actually committed on reasonable grounds of suspicion
(Burns vs. Erben, 40 N. Y. 463), ,and may arrest for an affray
or breach of the peace committed in his presence, but must,
without unreasonable delay, bring the offender before a magi-
strate. (Jordan vs. Reardon, I6 Minn. 431; 2‘ Am. and Eng.
Enc. Law, 2d Ed., p. 888, and cases cited.) The Legislature
may also extend the power of private persons to make ar-
rests for offenses committed in their presence so as to em-
brace misdemeanors of any kind, accompanied with the con-
dition that the offenders be brought without delay before a
proper magistrate. This was what was done in respect to

3 and 4, twenty-ﬁve cents; No. 5, ten cents, and No. 6, forty
- cents.

Title XVI of the Penal Code, relating to cruelty to animals,
is also published by the Society in pamphlet form, and a copy
will be forwarded to any one interested in the work,

 

 

 




 

 

 

 

HOW TO PROCEED AGAINST
OFFENDERS.

There are two modes of proceeding, viz.: I. By giving the
offender into the custody of a policeman, constable, or other
ofﬁcer. II. By the apprehension of the accused under a
warrant. ‘

1.

BY GIVING THE OFFENDER INTO THE CUSTODY OF AN
OFFICER AUTHORIZED TO MAKE ARRESTS.

When you personally witness an act of cruelty, call the atten-
tion of an ofﬁcer to.the nature Of the offense, insist on the arrest
of the offender; if you cannot accompany the accused to the
magistrate, then give your name and address to the ofﬁcer as a
witness, and be sure to take his number, name, and precinct,
in order that you may compel attention to the case. The law
requires the police throughout this State to aid in the protec-
tion Of dumb animals from injury and abuse; and should any
ofﬁcer refuse his assistance—Which is not likely to occur—
then take the number on his hat or shield, and report the same
to the Society.

II.
BY THE ARREST OF THE ACCUSED UNDER WARRANT. .

When you do not personally see the act of cruelty, or when
you can not procure an ofﬁcer on the spot, or if the ofﬁcer
