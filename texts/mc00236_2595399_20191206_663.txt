28 July 1992

Jean Pearson
Box 41 7
Bethlehem, PA 18016

Dear ]e an:

Herewith what I hope is a cleaner copy of the anthology. Also a few
answers to some marketing questions.

Michael Rosen's In the Company of Dogs and In the Company of Cats to
date have sold 25,000 and 20,000 copies respectively (the latter book has
only been available since Winter 1991).

Of course Cleveland Amory's books about his cat, Polar Bear, have topped
the Best Seller list and, what with all the translations, etc. have doubtless
sold hundreds upon hundreds of thousands of copies. (I have not felt
comfortable asking Cleveland exactly how many).

Of course, poetry is a different genre, and I here have no helpful
information. Rosen mentioned Nadia Isenberg's We Animals as a good test
case regarding sales, but I don't know her (and neither does Rosen) so I'm
of no further help on this one. Perhaps your paths have crossed?

 

A few other odds-and—ends:

When Newsweek did its cover story about the Animal Rights Movement (I
think it was back in the Summer of 1990) it estimated its size at 10 million
and characterized it as ”one of the fastest growing movements in
America."

The 1991 Gallup Teenage Youth Survey of teenage attitudes/values found
that two out of every three teenagers believe in the goals of the Animal
Rights Movement—~40 percent of them "very strongly."

 




2

Earlier (I think it was 1989) a similar survey found that one in every three
teenagers in Great Britain is a vegetarian.

Every academic discipline finds itself having to address the animal rights
issue. Animal rights (an essay of mine, as it happens) has even found its
way into the Norton Reader!

Concerning my own work, which is mainly for the university press and
textbook market:I estimate that The Case for Animal Rights has sold
15,000-20,000 copies (counting the UK edition and translations). One of my
college texts, Matters of Life and Death, now going into its third edition,
has sold three to four times that. I think all my books(over twenty,
counting various editions) have been financially successful, from the
publisher's point of view. None has lost money for them. Some have paid
off handsomely (for them!)

Just in case any of this might be useful, I'm enclosing (a) a copy of my
complete __v_it_a, (b) a one page summary of this information, and (c) some

miscellaneous bits and pieces. Hope some of this helps.

By the time you receive this, we will have talked, so some of this doubtless

will be redundant. But I wanted to get this to you well in advance of the
deadline against which we're working.

Wishing you and your mother all of life's blessings in abundance, and
looking forward to producing a wonderful, timely and successful
anthology, I am,

Yours in The Struggle -
