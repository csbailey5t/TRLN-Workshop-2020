TO: CVMA/AVMA EXHIBITORS--DETROIT, 1971
FROM: R. G. RONGREN, AVMA CONVENTION MANAGER

SUBJECT: SPECIAL INFORMATION FOR EXHIBITORS

The attached Service Folder for exhibitors has been prepared to provide you with
all information and sources required for shipping, installing, decorating,
operating and removing your display and equipment in the 1971 CVMA/AVMA Convention
and Exhibit. Familiarization with the enclosed material will enable you to
anticipate your requirements and costs well in advance and to minimize last minute
confusion.

Please see that this information is read and understood by all of your booth
personnel. If there are any questions, please feel free to discuss them with me
anytime before you begin set-up of your booth. It is our belief that if each
exhibitor is aware of the rules and regulations governing the use of Cobo Hall,
he will not encounter any unpleasant situations.

Labor jurisdictions in Cobo Hall are well established. These, however, should
pose no problems if you know in advance what you can and cannot do. Here then
are some pertinent suggestions that should be helpful to you:

1. Erection and Dismantling All booths must be erected and dismantled
of Booths by local union personnel. If one man
cannot physically handle the job, two or
more must be hired. The exhibitor is not
permitted to help a union employee in
lieu of hiring an additional man.

 

2. Advance Labor Orders Labor may be ordered in advance in either
of two ways--with supervision or without
supervision. If you order labor without
supervision, then the labor group is
under the exhibitor's responsibility,
supervision, and control.

 

If the exhibitor orders the package
supervised set-up plan, Manncraft Exhibitors
Service will then install your booth

whether or not you are present. Under

these conditions, labor is under Nanncraft's
responsibility, supervision, and control,
and they are responsible for doing a
quality job for you.

If you are accustomed to doing certain minor
jobs (involving one hour or less) yourself
which you feel do not justify the employment
of the appropriate union labor, the AVMA
will provide such labor at no charge to you.

_~,WArrangements for this service must be made
i: at the Service Desk in Cobo Hall On Friday
" or Sunday.

Union labor is not required to unpack,
place on display or repack the exhibitor's

_own products (unless they require

assistance, such as carpenters, riggers,
etc., as with large equipment.)

Electricians are not required to plug in
booth lighting as long as the lighting is

_ originally supplied with the booth.

Exhibitors are reminded that the light in
Cobo Hall is ”brighter than day” and supple-
mental lighting will probably not be
necessary. If you have back panel lighting
or something of this sort built into your
exhibit, you'll need an outlet. The use of
duplex or triplex plugs is prohibited by

lorder of the Detroit building code. To
' avoid multiple connection changes, leave
,. all lights connected to one junction_box.
, L Likewise, all motors should be cennected

to a single, separate junction box.

Remember-~only two days are available for
installing exhibits--Friday, July 16 from
8:00 A.M;-4:3O P.M., and Sunday, July 18
from 8:00 A.M.-9:OO P.M; You can avoid
overtime charges by setting up your exhibit
on Friday between 8:00 A;M. and 4:30 P.M;
The exhibit hall will be closed on Saturday,
July 17. Overtime rates will prevail after

4:30 P.M. and all day Sunday.

Exhibitors may carry into the exhibit hall
small packages, cartons, and personal
belongings. This does not mean that an
exhibitor may use the truck dock facilities
to unload his personal car, truck, or
station wagon one piece.at aMtime. ,All
truck docks are under the control of the
official drayage contractor, and this is
necessary for the total efficient movement
of freight in and 'out.

Exhibitors are responsible for their own
equipment and personnel. Therefore, it.is
expected that they purchase adequate insur-
ante to protect against all perils. ‘””

Dear Mrs. Gould:

Many thanks for forwarding the application and
contract forms to us reserving a booth at our
Detroit convention this summer.

Inasmuch as our bookkeeper received two checks
(3351 and 3361) for $100 each, we thought jwe
had better check with you to determine whether
or not both are to apply toward exhibit space,
or if one of the checks is to apply on some
other item. Both checks are dated February 19.

As you requested, we will return the application
and any other material to Mrs. Stevens' home at
the address you gave us.

We will look forward to hearing from.you on the
above, Mrs. Gould. And thanks for all your good

cooperation.

Sincerely,

products to the largest yearly gathering of
veterinarians.

As in the past, space will be assigned in
accordance with the point system outlined

in the rules section of the enclosed
prospectus, provided the application has been

Juno ’4, 1971

Do or Dorothy,

I called Mr. Notiﬁed, at Wyeler Press, and he is sending
the motogreph for the cover of Basic Care of Egerimental Animals
to Mr. Lee Mega, Foreign Language Studio, 2’ 30 Southfield Road,
Lathrup Village, Michigan @8076 as you requested. I asked him about
wading the photo-plate, which Mrs. Stevens thought would. save money
but. he said thtt most printers have different equipment and no at likely
it mum not fit.- Aleo, the title may be in spaniah and therefore
the plate would not be usable.

 

He is needing you twenty five oopiee of the manuals
you wanted, “main Caz-reg, ”@omfortable Queréters" and "Mane Biology
Projects."

Bezelosed is name information about the AVMA convention.
The union. labor is again making a. big fuss but we have not had any
real problems yet getting around them. All the books will. be shipped
directly to our booth at. coho Hall so you will have them available.
I see from the info sheet that you are allowed to unpack yourself!
We ale-o enraged into the oomont'ion all the things we wanted to without
hiring union guys at the loading clock so I hope you will have as
good luok, to help your“! Labor is $16.50 minimum per
hour! They will oharge us that to deliver our books to the booth
probably. Really depmé‘a on how much stuff you have to take inaide.~

Friday seem to be the day they want you to not up but
of oourse tie; t is up to you. I will order three white chairs and
a table for the front. as manual, unless you think something else
would be better. Would you want the red table cloth we have here
or shall I order a table drape 7' They have in addition to red, blue,
gold, and «elite.

I have the film to be preoeeeed and will do this in time
to mail it to you. Probably? about the 213%. of this month and then
mail it off so you will reoeive it the first week in July.

Well, I guess that is about. it for now. As soon as We.
Stevens returns I will get the whole convention thing under oontrol . . .
that is the eigne autumn, what they are to go onto. .- .Maybe you all
have already talked about that. . .Ae you said yesterday, one never
knows just exactly what is going on. . "I have a note to CS about
giving me a oopy of the Greek BC to need to you and so this will
be done as soon as hhe returns».

Bee Barbara:
In answer to yours of June 4th ~

Mr. Ortega received the photograph for Basic Care
yesterday. I was at Foreign Language Studio
yesterday afternoon with additional COpies of the
English version for picture cut~outs for the Spanish
version. Everything will be ready for printing in
another day or two.

Thanks for ordering 25 copies each of BC, CQ, and
HEP. I didn't get them as yet.

Abot Union labor ~~ Coho Hall is notorious for that.
Many conventions by~pass Cobo because of the exhorbitant
union fees. I can manage to carry the film, projector,
etc. myself so I don't expect to have too much trouble.

The three white chairs and table will be fine.

Use your own good judgement on whether you should send
the red table cloth or order a table drape. You know
much more about conventions than I do.

Receiving the film at the end of this month will be
311531: fine 0

It will be great if you can manage a copy of the Greek
BC for me .... if not, I can always borrow Dr. Cohen's

copy!

Yes, I will send the photo back to you at DC rather
than to Chrysler Press.

Love,
' $31..

ANIMAL WELFARE INSTITUTE

NEW YORK, N. Y. 1001?

T0: VETERINARIANS
FROM: THE ANIMAL WELFARE INSTITUTE

The Animal Welfare Institute is a non-profit char-
itable organization founded in 1951 to promote humane
treatment of all animals. Particular emphasis was placed
by its founders on advancing the welfare of research ani-
mals, for twenty years ago there was no organized charity
working to improve conditions for these animals.

Two pioneer publications in this field, Basic Care g§_
Experimental Animals (now in its fifth edition) and Comfort-
able Quarters for Laboratory Animals (now in its sixth edi-
tion), are available free to veterinarians and to persons
employed in scientific institutions. They are for use in
these institutions only and are not for redistribution to

 

high school teachers or students because ownership of such
manuals has been found to create a false sense of pride and
a belief by untrained youths that they are justified in in-
flicting pain on animals in the name of science.

Manuals prepared for use in high schools and grade
schools are available from the Animal Welfare Institute, and
veterinarians are invited to take a free copy of each to give
to a local teacher - Humane Biologngrojects, as its name
indicates, is intended to assist high school students in
devising humane projects for science fairs and to assist
teachers in developing humane teaching programs. First Aid
gang Care of Small Animals gives information on the rescue
and management of small wild animals and birds in distress.

 

The attached listing describes all the materials avail-
able from the Institute. The order blank at the end may be
used to obtain literature, much of which is free to veteri-
narians, and/or to apply for membership. You would be most
welcome as a member of the Institute.

The enclosed letter from Dr. verges is being sent to you at Mrs. Stevens
suggestion. I have sent her two of the new BC's (Spanish ones) and CQ
and Expeessions. CS said you probably have too much to take with you
already when you go to Mexico but maybe you would want to consider taking
copies of the films with you when you go. This Dr. sounds very nice and
it might lead to sumething....anyway we don't know whether she wants to
purchase them or rent them... CS thought maybe you could determine this,
anyway. Let me know what you decide...I mean if I have to write her or
something like that just send the letter back to me. I don't know about

Deer Barb: when 1 went to the printer today to tell him he would
have to wait until mid-September for his money I used a little
psychology and showed him this letter first. He wee so pleased

Dear Miss Gould:

In reply to your letter of September 27, 1971, the only
advice I can give is to see that the goods are properly packed.
However, you cannot fully protect yourself against loss or damage as
such. This is one of the hazard of transportation which cannot be avoided.

As for as the timely payment of these claims, this Commission
too is concerned with this feature of claims settlement.

You may be interested that the Commission has instituted a general
rulemaking proceeding pertaining to claims. In that proceeding, Ex Parte
No. 263, Rules, Regulations and Practices of Regulated Carriers with
Respect to the Processing of Loss and Damage Claims, the Commission will,
among other things, (I) inquire into the nature of all claims rules and
practices of regulated carriers; (2) investigate the effect of such rules
and practices; (3) determine the Commission's jurisdiction with respect
thereto; (h) consider whether the Commission should adopt rules and
regulations governing these and other matters relating to the handling
and procession of loss and damage claims; and (5) take such other and
further action, including the possible recommendation of any legislation
as the facts and circumstances may justify or require.

very truly years,

,\

Subject: Eazor Pro DT—44765
Dear Miss Gould:

This refers to shipment of three cartons Educational Books
shipped by Animal Welfare Institution, Detroit, Michigan on
July 23, 1971, our Pro DT—447Q;

Be advised this shipment was caught in a flash flood during
Sunday, August l, l97l at our Baltimore, Maryland terminal.
The water exceeded the height of our dock and trailers.

We had no one on duty and had no prior warning of the probab-
ility of a flash flood of such proportions and have never
experienced such difficulties during the length of time we
have occupied this building.

According to Section 1B of the Bill of Lading Act, no carrier
can be held liable for loss thereto or damage thereof caused
by an Act of God.

we must deny liability of any claim that may be filed.
Yours veg/truly,

EAZOR EXPRESS, INC.

Re: Eazor Express, Inc.

Dear Miss Gould:

Thank you for your recent letter. I regret I must advise
that the Interstate Commerce Commission does not have jurisdiction
to settle loss or damage claims in individual situations. As of
now, if the parties fail to reach a settlement, the only recourse is
to file a suit in a court having appropriate jurisdiction as in
other contractual affairs where there is a disagreement between
parties.

In order to be of some assistance to people who have
prdblems in this area, the Commission does require that motor
carriers furnish security to the public against their cargo
liability. In this connection, Seaboard Surety COmpany, 90
William Street, New York, NY 10038 has certified a bond for
this motor carrier under Bond No. 73750h, effective April 18, 1970.
You may file your claim.directly with this surety company which is
liable for any loss or damage for which the carrier may be held legally
liable. Upon filing said claim, the surety company should be advised that
it is being presented under its bond filed with the Interstate
Commerce Commission.

Very truly yours,

L. J. Schloer, Chief
Section of Insurance
