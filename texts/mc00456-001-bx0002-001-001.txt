THE BITER BIT.

It is not often that one who is a mighty hunter, and of whom
it was said by Lord Lonsdale, that nobody had a “greater ex"
perience in all the sports of the world” should, at the same time,
commend the beneﬁcial effects of a non-flesh diet. And yet this is
what has happened recently. Writing in the Shootzhg Times of
August 22nd, in defence of blood—sports against the attacks of
members of the League for the Prohibition of Cruel Sports, Major
Harding Cox says: “Humanity could exist and thrive perfectly well
upon animal products, such as milk, cream, cheese, eggs, etc., with
a plentiful supply of cereals, vegetables, and fruits. indeed, i am
convinced that, were such diet universally adopted, the present
overwhelming percentage of C3 individuals in our community would
be reduced to a minimum, whilst many, if not all, of the ills to
which human flesh is heir, would gradually disappear, and, in that
case, the Al’s would be in a large majority!”

We are grateful to the gallant Major for this excellent testi—
monial to the merits of the humane diet. We wonder, however,
whether, if he had known that the L. P.C.S. is oﬂicered by a life-
vegetarian and a Secretary and a Treasurer who had not eaten
ﬂesh-meat for forty and ﬁfty years respectively, he would have been
quite so eulogistic in his praise of an argument which is the most
effective weapon in undermining his own position as a Hsportsman. "
