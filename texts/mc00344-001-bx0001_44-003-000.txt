Dear Mr. Stevens:

At your request, I have referred to Washington
counsel, Mr. Abe Fortas of Arnold, Fortas & Porter, the
matter relating to the American HDmane Association. I
have also forwarded to Mr. Fortas the various materials
which Mr. Fred Myers delivered to our office, and a copy
of a memorandum of facts prepared by our office on the
basis of what Mr. Myers told us. Mr. Fortas has acknowledged
receipt of the various documents and advises me that he

is arranging a conference with Mr. Myers in the next few
days.

I am advising Mr. Fortas, by copy of this letter,
of your desire that Mrs. Stevens not appear as a plaintiff
in any litigation which may ensue. I am also advising
him that you are, however, willing to pay the legal
expenses in connection with this matter.

I am happy to have been of service in this

matter.

-Sincerely,

'

'Dear Mrs. Stevens:

3 am sorry I missed you when my good friend
Grace Tully brought you to my office Thursday. However,
I am.glad you had the chance to talk with my.Adminis-
trative Assistant, Herbert waters.

He has told me of your keen interest in S. 1636
and says he explained to you some of the problems with
which we are confronted.

we will appreciate anything you can do in a
constructive way toward working out a solution.

As Mr. waters promised you, I am enclosing a
copy of a letter from R. H. Starr of Kansas City who
designates himself as a professing Jew in the business'
of designing and equipping packing houses who sees no
reason Why kosher slaughtering is not poSsible, even
though the livestock has first been made unconscious.

Sincerely,

Honorable Hubert Humphrey
Senate Office Building
”washington 25, D.C.

SUBJFCT: S; 1636

The bill for humane slaughtering that you introduced into
the Senate has arouSed my interest.

I am a registered professional engineer in the State of
Missouri, a graduate cf the Massachusetts Institute of
,Technology, and a professing Jew, belong to a reform
congregation in Kansas City, I have Spent my adult life

in the business of designing and equipping packing houses,,
and I am personally familiar with the inhumanity that takes
place in slaughtering animals, and also I think with most
of the measures that can be taken to allay such suffering.

Through the kindness of our RepreSentative in Congress, Mr.
Bolling, I have obtained a copy of your bill. I am very .
much perplexed by paragraph (c) of Section II, in which you
exempt from the requirements of the Section, ritual Jewish
slaughter for the kosher trade.

I do not understand why such an exemption should appear. I
am familiar with Biblical and Talmudic law, and I have a

considerable knowledge of the ritual requirements of kosher
slaughter. ‘ ‘ ‘

I do not know Why kosher slaughtering is_not possible even
though the livestock has first been made unconscious.

I do know that this subject is somewhat controversial, but

. I should welcome some publicity about it. 'There certainly
‘exist at least a few kosher slaughter houses where animals

are stunned by mechanical means before the throat is out.

 




b

'\

I think it is unfair to exclude kosher slaughtering from
any such regulation as you propose, because it is inherently
as humane a method as any other.

I know your measure faces a lot of opposition and that the
chances for passage are not very bright at present. All the
same, for the sake of the record, I think that you might well
eliminate the exemption that you have provided in the bill as
introduced originally.

If you had some special motive in exemption kosher slaughtering,
I should be extremely grateful if you would tell me about it.

Yours very truly,

(s) R.H. Starr
