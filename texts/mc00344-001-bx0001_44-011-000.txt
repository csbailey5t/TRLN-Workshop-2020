“I’ve just been to Boston—my feet are
killing me—and I looked at all the shops,
and, 1a, I couldn’t ﬁnd the wallpaper
I was looking for anywhere! I was so

discouraged as I wanted to paper the front parlor this year. But then I went to Fred
Fletcher’s, right in Milford, and do you know, he had exactly what I was looking for!”

Yes, Fred Fletcher has collected many hundreds of charming wallpaper designs that
have graced New England homes for centuries. The hard-to-ﬁnd hand blocked
Colonial patterns and small traditional designs you will ﬁnd at his shops are only
part of the largest display of papers in New England. Stop in at Fletcher’s soon.

Nathan M. Pusey

President
Harvard College

 

Fabian Bachrach

WE ARE SEEKING FROM THE ALUMNI and friends of -Harvard by far the largest
sum ($82,500,000) ever asked of private means for the support of under-
graduate education.

This is not an expansion program but a major attempt to catch up with past
and present needs. '

Harvard College has a sizeable endowment, 'but the value of this endowment in
terms of current needs has gone sharply downward in the past twenty years. Today
the endowment, despite its increased market value, supports only 27 per cent of the
costs of the University’s operating commitments. The same is true of other colleges
and universities. All of them have needs, many of long standing. This is due in large
measure to the fact that the tremendous expansion of our country and the multiplication
of professionalization within its life have outstripped the present capacities of our
educational institutions.

Our effort is only part of a much larger effort which is being made and must be
made, if the resources and revenues of higher education are to be equal to its task.
It seems to me clear that the amount spent on higher education will have to double
in the next ten years if we are to keep pace. The public must come to understand the
size and scope of the needed effort if we are to produce not only an adequate number
of professionally trained citizens, but, above all, informed, reasonable, and responsible
men and women.

Now open to the public, The Breakers is one of Newport’s

  

most magniﬁcent showplaces.

Let’s Go To Newport!

ERHAPS THE MOST FAMOUS town in

Rhode Island is Newport, built in an
age that in many respects seems as remote
from our current way of life, not to men-
tion economy, as the halcyon days of
ancient Rom-e. The names of the ﬁnancial
greats and the leaders of a society that
ﬂashed and sparkled are still attached to
the buildings there, to homes in the de-
signing and construction of which no
expense was spared. Today they are hap-
pily preserved by The Preservation Society
of Newport County, so that it is possible
to see and admire this group of unique
homes, churches and the like built over a
two-hundred-year period.

In general doors are opened to the
public around the ﬁrst of July and remain
open until the ﬁrst week in September,
although some welcome visitors for a
longer season. Admission is charged for
many, in the interest of their continued
maintenance, and there is a ‘ibargain’ strip

12

    

ticket good for all buildings at the rate

'of $2.00 for adults, $1.00 for children.

Just to tick off a few, the Nichols-Waln-
ton-Hunter House is the ﬁnest survmng
house of the era of Newport’s prqspeflty
in the pre-Revolutionary years, built at a
time (1748) when Newport was a greater
seaport than New York or Boston an

the streets were lined with the homes of
the merchant princes of the day. Tn the
Wanton-Lyman-Hazard House, built -m
1675, one may be able to hear the SWISh
of the skirts of Polly Wanton, daughter
of the Quaker merchant who gave her
the house in 1765. Polly was one Of the
Newport belles who captivated the ofﬁcers
of the French ﬂeet during their Visit to
Newport in 1780. The best-known NEW-
port mansion is the magniﬁcent home
built by Cornelius Vanderbilt, the Break-
ers, which opens for the season on Memo-
rial Day. The Breakers’ Stables have been
preserved almost as they were ﬁfty years

ago, and the carriage room contains a
great variety of ﬁne carriages and other
vehicles of historical interest. This collec-
tion is probably the only one in the coun-
try that exhibits carriages used by one
family and shown in that family’s original
home.

Special events in Newport this month
are: on the 16th, the start of the New-
port-to-Spain Yacht Race; 215t, 22nd,
23rd, Newport Motor Car Festival; 24th
to 26th, Annapolis-to-Newport Yacht
Race. In July there are two red-letter
dates to be circled. On the 4th, 5th and
6th, the Newport Jazz Festival will take
place. Headliners on this year’s bill are
Dizzy Gillespie, Dave Brubeck, George
Shearing, Roy Eldridge, Gerry Mulligan,
the Oscar Peterson Trio, Jo Jones, Turk
Murphy, Stuff Smith and Jack Teagarden,
plus jazz stars imported from a dozen or
more countries. And on July 13th, the
Preservation Society will hold a Tiffany

on the Housatonic is just north of Bridge-
port and south of New Haven, a mere
ﬁfty-seven miles from New York. As if the
handsome home of this Shakespeare sum-
mer repertory theatre, with its heraldic
sundial and its terrace whisked with pleas-
ant Housatonic breezes, weren’t enough,
topflight performances are promised to all
Shakespeare lovers. Othello will open the
season on June 22nd, and Midsummer
Nig/yt’r Dream will be given on the 25rd,
with the two works done on a staggered
schedule thereafter throughout the month.
The Boston Arts Festival is to be held
from June 14th to 30th this year, two full
weeks planned so that Bostonians and visit-
ors may get their ﬁll of art, music, drama
and dance. Among the many scheduled
events we ﬁnd that e. e. cummings, who
was named winner of the 1957 Boston Arts
Festival Poetry Award, will introduce a
previously unpublished poem and read
from his other works. This annual Festival
has inspired many families to combine it
with sight-seeing in and around Boston.
An unusual piece of literature is that
prepared by Harry and Dorothy Davega,
owners of the Red Barn in Westport,
Connecticut, since it includes the authors’
selection of thirty-four outstanding New
England restaurants and inns that measure
up to their own high standards of ex-
cellence. The folder even sports a neat
little map with the eating places nicely
spotted. A good way to pick up this ﬁne
Guide to Country Dining in New England
is to make your ﬁrst stop at the Red Barn!

sonal attention. Maine food—blueberry pie,
Johnny cakes, New England boiled dinners,
chowders, etc, make regular appearances
on the menu. The Appalachians (Mt. Blue,
Mt. Tumbledown, Mt. Jackson) are nearby,
offering easy or difﬁcult trails, whichever
you prefer, and square dances are held in
the village once a week.

In Marion, Massachusetts, the Old Stone
Studio also puts great emphasis on the
personal touch, and combines good cook-
ing with the hospitality of its studio hearth.
Built in the early eighteenth century as an
oil reﬁnery, the stone building became a
studio in the 80's when Richard Watson
Gilder, poet and editor of the Century
Magazine, bought it and converted it for
his own use and that of his artist wife.
The Gilders' visitors numbered President
Cleveland, who prepared his ﬁrst inaugural
message there, Joe Jefferson, Saint Gau-
dens, Charles Dana Gibson, and others.

In Vermont a hilltop farmhouse carries
the pleasant name of Holiday Hill, and

and cottages that accommodate two or

a way that each has its own breathtaking
View. Another engaging name is that of

Hampshire, specializing in ”thoughtful”
meals served in an early American atmos-
phere.

One of the most rewarding and un-
usual drives in the east is the Equinox Sky
Line Drive, so if you find yourself—or-
manage to get yourself—anywhere near
the neighborhood of Manchester, Vermont,
be sure to put it down on your trip list.
The Equinox Sky Line Drive is the only
paved privately-owned, mountain toll road
in the United States, the only such road
in the east that reaches the actual summit
of the mountain it’s climbing, and, with one
exception, the one east of the Mississippi
that gives you the greatest climb from en-
trance to summit. The entrance is 600 feet
above sea level, and the top of Big Equi-
nox is 3,806 feet, so up you go about
3200 feet. The roads a marvel of en-
gineering skill and the result of a fairly
spectacular paving job, but such is its rapid
ascent that you’re given a little printed
page of driving instructions for both up-
ping and downing.

Atop Mount Equinox, at the end of the
drive, is the Sky Line Inn, 21 spot that’s
worth your time in itself. Among the many
interesting parts of the Inn are the ﬁre-
place hearths, which are carved with the
initials of mountain climbers who tackled
Mount Equinox a century or more ago. The
ledges they found were soft and, to those

who belonged to a nation of initial-carvers,
tempting. When the mountain-climbing
vogue died out, the ledges disappeared
under a covering of moss and pine needles,
which preserved the carvings until they
were discovered at the time the Inn was
built. Sections of the ledges, initials and all,
were cut out with a diamond-studded cir-
cular saw and ﬁtted into place in the
hearths of the lounge and diningroom. You
wonder if the ghosts of the carvers peer
out from the nooks and corners at these
odd twentieth-century people who rolled
up a well-paved road in a matter of min-
utes, arriving refreshed and not a bit out
of breath. The beautiful land is spread
lavishly all around you as you wander
around or eat good food in the Sky Line
Inn, and Sunrises and sunsets are mag-
niﬁcent.

Feeling old? Forget it! We are remind-
ed that the Flume, at Franconia Notch in
New Hampshire, was discovered in 1803
by a 93-year-old woman, Aunt Jess Guern-
sey. And what was she doing there? Trout
ﬁshing!

Tea and cinnamon sticks and frosted
sponge squares add up to laughing chil-
dren’s voices in a safe, directed play center

of Wenham, Massachusetts.

How does tea, a buffet luncheon, a hand-
knit sweater have any possible connection
with the correct swing of a tennis racket in
a teen-agers hand? A most direct relation-
ship any member of the Wenham Village
Improvement Society will insist, for it 18
through the operation of the Wenham EX-
change, Hobbs House and the Tea House
that a carefully planned year round sports
program for children from the age of four
through the teens is carried on by the
Improvement Society.

There are similar examples of it in every
town across the country and more especially
in New England, but never does it cease
to be a wonder, the paths that can be
smoothed, the ”mountains” that can e
moved, the standards raised by a small
group of women working together. Such a
ngLIp is the Wenham Village Improvement
Society, Inc, now in its 64th year.

In addition to keeping up the playground
and employing four trained instructors,
ﬂooding and lighting the grounds for sket-

ing in the winter, the Society through Its
Tea Room and Exchange will give $2090
this Year in scholarships, supports the Girl
and Boy Scout troops, donates to the Bev-
erly Hospital, the North Shore Babies HOS-

pital, the Visiting Nurse Service, the Com-
munity Service Committee, the Fireman’s
Relief Assoc.

It provides a free luncheon on Town
Meeting day, this it has done for years.
One of its special interests is the Historical
House and Museum across the street from
the Tea House which depends largely on
the annual generous gift of the society. The
Museum which is unique .in that it has four
special exhibits a year in addition to the
year round display, is open daily from 1

to 4 in the afternoon and houses one of the

largest doll collections in the world.

In the main building, a pretty old fash-
ioned house turned shop, is the Main Ex-
change room where the loveliest in china,
glass, linen and jewelry may be purchased.
It is becoming increasingly diﬂicult to ﬁnd
women who can knit, sew and cook for the
Exchange as they did in 1910 when this
project was started and so these articles are
supplemented through the efforts of Mrs.
E. L. Mitchell who is in charge of the
buying and the very ﬁnest in china, glass,
linen and jewelry is invitingly arranged
and the sun shines through the windows of
the old house and lights up crystal, silver
and china of the one-of-a-kind variety.

In the Tea House a buffet luncheon is
served daily with two choices of main
course, several home made desserts (all
cooking is done in the recently renovated
kitchen), and a beverage. Tea is served
throughout the afternoon and is the one
place anywhere around where a real dainty
tea with crusty deep-fried cinnamon stocks,
frosted sponge cake and pots of hot tea,
so dear to all women’s hearts, may be en-
joyed in such a quiet, pleasant atmosphere.

Although the Society is a sedate 63 years
old, it has forward-looking ideas and plans
are currently underway for enlarging the
skating rink and adding another tennis
court for it hopes to continue to keep its
young people close to home and happily
occupied. '

HAT THE GUNS AT AMERICA’S ﬁrst

great ﬁght for independence were
heard more than 100 miles from the
famed battleground near Bunker Hill, is
a New England legend which has persrst-
ed for nearly two centuries. Today, the
answer to this enigma of early Revolu-
tionary times may be near solution, thanks
to a local history project and a well-timed
note to a major general inquiring about
recent unexplained rumblings in the New
England hills—rumblings so loud that
dishes rattled on pantry shelves and farm
dogs took to shelter under household fur-
niture.

The story is this: While working on a
New England town history, the writer, a
World War II ”sound sleuth,” ran across
a yarn which told of Minute Men in ﬁelds
near Leyden, Massachusetts hearing dis-
tant gunﬁre on June 17th 1775—the day
1400 raw Yankee recruits held their
ground against 3800 crack British red
coats backed by the big guns of His
Majesty’s navy. 80 sure were the Leyden
men that “blood was again spilled in de-
fense of their country,” they dropped
their ﬁeld tools and headed p'osthaste
toward the sound of the cannon which
they rightly believed near Boston, 100
miles away.

Tying in this unique "call to arms”

    

with the puzzling rumbles recently heard
in and around Leyden, was a natural se-
quence. After it was clear that neither jet
planes, thunder, moving freight cars or
blasting were likely causes of the distant
boomings, the commanding ofﬁcer of the
nearest Army Post, 52 air miles distant,
was contacted. Deﬁnite information was
given as to the exact time of day a series
of thunderous explosions had been heard
in the hills of Leyden. Our communica-
tion also mentioned the Bunker Hill
legend, suggesting that if the artillery at
the Army Post could now be heard 52
miles away, it was possible that the an-
cient Bunker Hill fable about the far~
reaching gun sounds, might be more fact
than ﬁction.

Nothing was heard from this com-
munication through the mails, but within
a few days a front page story appeared in
the local newspaper telling about our at-
tempts to solve the Bunker Hill gun
riddle. In substance this article read:

Fort Devens authorities recently
received a communication from

Leyden asking if around noon on

March 12th there was artillery ﬁr-

ing on the Post Ranges. The answer

is: Yes.
About noon on March 12th, 105

mm howitzers were following a

ﬁring pattern for a space of time,

the guns being ﬁred at regulated

intervals.

Investigations a n d uestions
asked of personnel trained in the
sonic sciences reveal that under cer-
tain favorable conditions it is pos-
sible to hear heavy gunﬁre at un-
usual distances. These conditions
prevailed on March 12th and this
conﬁrmation may well be the justi-
ﬁcation for the ancient Bunker Hill
gun legends which have plagued
historians for generations.

Shortly after this news item appeared,
an invitation was received from the Fort
Devens commanding ofﬁcer, Major Gen-
eral Bryan L. Milburn, requesting our
presence at the fort on Army Day. The
General had learned of our ancestor’s part
at Bunker Hill and as a Minute Man on
the Lexington alarm. ”We would be mOSt
happy,” he wrote, "to welcome the great-
grandson of one of Washington’s ofﬁcers
to this largest military installation in New
England to show him many interesting
displays depicting today’s Army.” The
General evidently thought this is a good
opportunity to encourage the “Minute
Man” spirit of alertness.

Following the Fort Devens visit,
things moved fast. One of the New Eng-

land news services picked up the Bunker
Hill gun story, and as a result, letters and
telephone calls were frequent—even the
Boston radio picked up the yarn. One
solicitous relative wrote she had heard of
our being involved in a ”localized earth-
quake” and hoped we had come through
unscathed!

A newsman in Portland, hearing we
had ﬁrst experienced gunﬁre sounds at
age ten when vacationing twenty-two
miles from the Fort Williams cannon, ran
a front page story on the Bunker Hill tale,
thus introducing Maine to the ”fable”
and at the same time ”scooping” the sig-
niﬁcant fact that we had lived at a spot
on Casco Bay called “Gun Point” during
our initiation into‘ distant gunﬁre detec-
tion.

In fact, there was so much interest
aroused by the newspaper versions of the
Bunker Hill gun noise story, and so much
controversial talk was set going through-
out New England, we decided to do a
thorough job on the subject to ﬁnd out,
if possible, whether those Bunker Hill
guns actually were heard over 100 miles
inland, or whether the whole thing was
just another Yankee yarn.

From the start, results looked encour-
aging. After some digging, it soon be-
came apparent that not only Leyden had

Britt's/9 men-o-war, left, and [and batteries caused most of the booming sound heard as
far away as Hanover, New Hampshire. Map s/aows area in which the guns were heard.

 

 

 

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

In the immediate area of the battle, resi-
dents of (3017175 Hill climbed out on the
rooftops and eagerly watched the ﬁght.

a Bunker'Hill gun legend, but towns all
up and down the Connecticut Valley nur-
tured similar ”fables.” The History of
Jaffrey, New Hampshire added substan-
tially to the list of legends, while numer-
ous reports came in from scattered pomts
in Vermont and Massachusetts. 111 all,
about fourteen Bunker Hill gun noise
legends were collected and some of these
originated with citizens of very high
standing.

President Eleezer Hitchcock of Dart-
mouth College, writing to the Governor
of Connecticut, Monday, June 19th 1775
said: ”Last Saturday we heard the noise
of cannon, we suppose at Boston, and we
now are impatient to be informed of the
occasion and the event.” This was quoted
in the Jaffrey History. It was written in
Hanover, 112 airline miles from the
battle!

Reverend Laban Ainsworth, 'ﬁrst pastor
of the Jaffrey church and student at Dart-
mouth in 1775, is quoted as having heard
the report of ordnance at the Battle of
Bunker Hill while at Hanover. Reports
to the same effect come from Jaffrey itself
where workers shingling the meeting
house are said to have heard the Bunker
Hill boomings, 182 years ago.

Colonel James Ripley, a settler in Cor-
nish, N. H. wrote to his sister: “We ar-
rived in Cornish on the 14th day of June
1775, and on the seventeenth the sound
of cannon thundered through the woods.”

Similar records came, via historian
George A. Duncan, from Plymouth,
Lebanon, Washington and Dublin, New
Hampshire, while Hartford, Vermont
provided another long-distance gun noise
story.’

Massachusetts contributed Bunker Hill
legends from Worcester, Winchendon
Townsend, Chesterﬁeld and Cummington,.
In Cummington, the uncle of New Eng-
land’s famed poet, William Cullen Bry-
ant, 13 reported as having heard a far-
away cannonading on that famous June
Day—a canonading “which proved to be
the onset at Bunker Hill.”

British ordnance records reveal the sur-
prising fact that the guns at the Battle of
Bunker Hill—the Paul Revere guns——
probably created the greatest bedlam ever

experienced in New England. And, .too,
this is something we did not realize:
About 95% of the racket, which persisted
from 4 AM. to 5 P.M., came not from
Bunker Hill (or. Breeds Hills where the
Yankees actually were entrenched) but
from the guns of the British battleships,
the British guniboats and the British land
batteries in and around Boston harbor.

The four known British men-of—war
which belched smoke and noise and can-
non balls toward the American redoubt
on Breeds Hill were His Majesty’s shlpSZ
Somerset, 68 guns; Lively, 20 guns; Glar-
gow, 20 guns; Falcon, 16 guns. This adds
up to 124 guns which, according to Ofﬁ-
cial British naval records, could explode
824 pounds of powder. Add to this the
explosive poundage of the British shOf€
batteries, ﬂoating batteries and gunboatS,
and some idea of the huge noise-making
potential of the British guns may be
gleaned.

The Yankees, under Prescott, Putnam
and Stark were limited to six light ﬁeld
guns, and their muskets, so the American
noise-making power on Bunker Hill Day
was negligible compared with the thun-
derous British uproar which historians t6
us was, happily, more noisy than effective.

The next important step in the Bunker
Hill gun noise mystery was to ﬁnd out

[UNE 1957 YANKEE

 




 

 

 

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

just what the weather was on that mem-
orable June day, 182 years ago. It’s an
established fact that if gun sounds are to
be heard far from their source, weather
conditions might be right, particularly
wind direction. According to sound ex-
perts, the wind should have been light
east or southeast on Bunker Hill Day if
the battle noises were to carry many miles
inland.

With this in mind, the Blue Hills Ob-
servatory in Medford was contacted in the
hope we might track down the winds of
June 17th 1775. The observatory discov-
ered a journal by John Jeffries of Boston
in which he recorded “Fair and Very
Hot” for Bunker Hill Day. This entry
agreed with ﬁve other historians of the
American Revolution, but it did not give
the vital clue——wind direction.

However, after consulting the 1775
Harvard weather diary of Professor John
Winthrop, and with the added valuable
help of Don Kent, New England’s mod-
ern weather man, it appeared Virtually
certain that Bunker Hill Day dawned fair
and windless; that a light sea breeze
sprang up from the northeast about 10
A.M., shifted to east by noon (the time
the heavy cannonading began) and
moved around to the southeast by 3:30
P.M. In other words, the winds, from
noon to 4 P.M., the period of greatest
noise intensity, were ideal for carrying the
battle sounds far inland. A glance at the
Bunker Hill battle picture, (with back-

, YANKEE [UNE 1957

 

ground in the west), bears out the theory
of an easterly wind during the ﬁght. The
fact that the majority of Bunker Hill gun
legends come from towns in line with
east or southeast winds, also conﬁrms our
theory.

To sum up the new ﬁndings: On
March 12th (and on several occasions
since then) the sound of 105 mm how-
itzers ﬁring 52 miles from Leyden was
heard on an easterly wind. The powder
charge of these guns was found to be
about 10 pounds maximum with only one
gun ﬁring at a time. Later, sounds from
large ﬁreworks displays, set off at a
known distance from the observer and

'with known explosive charges, checked

with the Fort Devens observations.

From conservative estimates, it is be-
lieved that the maximum noise producing
power of the British and American guns
at Bunker Hill was equal to about 200
pounds of powder exploded at one time,
or twenty times the charge of the Devens’
guns

Leading sound experts at the Massa-
chusetts Institute of Technology, much
interested in our experiment, give us ﬁg-
ures which show that the boomings at
Bunker Hill could have traveled about 4.4
times as far as the sounds from the
Devens guns (4.4 times 52) or 228 miles.

With this in mind, the Hanover, New
Hampshire and other Bunker Hill gun
noise legends do not seem at all impossi-
ble. Veriﬁed records reveal that the guns
of Gettysburg carried inland 150 miles to
Greensburg, Pennsylvania; while large
explosive charges, heard in Paris, are
known to have carried 230 miles.

We conclude our story with a quote
from the Chase ”History of Hanover and
Dartmouth College” in which the author
comments on the Bunker Hill gun noises
reported from various points in New
England:

"The sounds were universally at-
tributed to the Battle of Bunker
Hill and were certainly contempo-
raneous with it. They could indeed
have come from no other source.
Strange as the facts appear, they are
too well authenticated to be doubt-

ed.”

ENTERING THE GROLIER BOOK SHOP
(it’s in Harvard Square, Cambridge,
on Plympton Street) is more like going
into a study than into a store. For one
thing the shop isn’t on the street level:
you have to go up ﬁve steps to it, and you
have to struggle with the door, which is
heavy and binds a bit in its frame. Inside,
the high walls, which, like the swinging-
type sign outdoors, could do with a wash-
down and some fresh paint, are lined
with bookshelves halfway up. They con-
tain the mOdern ﬁrst editions in which
the shop specializes. Two tables joined
together in the center of the room hold
what new books haven’t tumbled over one
another in the window. Gordon Cairnie,
the proprietor, usually sits on a long
leather couch under the window (a couch
which has warmed the buttocks of many
a writer) reading books or catalogues, or
talking with his friends. He’s a small man
of Scotch descent, with a mischievous
smile and a hint of John Bull in his pink
checks, sparse, wispy hair, and thin,

almost unnoticeable mustache. On the far
side of the tables are a couple of chairs in
which customers may be sampling wares,
eating the free lunch of bookstore read-
ing. No counter, no cash register, no tele-
phone, no ﬂuorescent lights. All the store
belongs to the customer—~and Gordon.
The owner runs it in his own way. He
rarely opens before noon, and he doesn’t
open then on days when there is snow
shoveling or grass cutting to be done at
home or a sale of something he wants to
wear in Filene’s Basement. The other day,
when I went by the store about one in the
afternoon, I saw a woman walk up the
steps, try the door, and turn away, mut-
tering a vexed, ”When is he open?” Gor-
don opens and closes when he’s a mind
to. After he’s well open, if he wants a cup
of coffee or a spot of lunch, he lopes
around the corner in his Groucho Marx
forward crouch, leaving the store in the
charge of whatever customer happens to
be there. If no customer is in, he leaves
the door unlocked, knowing the next man

in will take over for him. Many of his
best customers have keys, and sometimes
they will open the shop and run it for a
time, leaving money and notes for the
proprietor on the table. It’s a community
enterprise and center.

A few of his customers are so short-
sighted as to protest about this socializa-
tion of business; they think he should be
there regularly from nine to six, six days
a week, for their convenience and his
proﬁt. Gordon has different ideas. A
business that can’t support itself is no
business for him.

Gordon drifted into the book business,
but you couldn’t dynamite him out of it.
Born in Coaticook, a small town in the
Province of Quebec, just over the Ver-
mont line, he served overseas in World
War I as a buck private with the Cana-
dian Army, a service about which he has
tales to tell. Later he graduated from
Ontario Agricultural College at Guelph,
to become a potato inspector in Manitoba
and Prince Edward Island. When a rela-

 

tive left him some money, he came to
Cambridge, in 1922, to study at Harvard,
ﬁrst landscape architecture, then English.
He went to classes, did the reading, but
seldom bothered to take examinations. In-
stead he bought books until he had so
many piled up in his rooms in Divinity
Hall he had to hire a roomto house them.
So he and a fellow student combined their
books and opened the present Grolier
Book Shop. He later bought out the part-
ner. Later still he married a girl with
Nova Scotia ties, and today they send
their daughter to McGill. The Canadian
bond was and is strong: Canada will
always be his Eden; but he’s also proud
of his connection with the early American
novelist Lydia Maria Child, whose books
he collects.

He’s the most popular merchant in
Harvard Square. People like him and con-
ﬁde in him. His earthy frankness, a hold-
-over from his agricultural days, earns
their conﬁdence, frees them from their
habitual (Continaea’ on page 76)

by A. 'B. STOCKBRIDGE

LTHOUGH THIS STORY MAY seem in-
A credible to those who are unfamiliar
with the mysterious workings of the sea,
old-timers along the Gloucester, Massa-
chusetts waterfront vouch for its truth. It
happened near the turn of the century,
back in the days of sail, when Gloucester
had no close competitors as the world’s
leading ﬁshing port. Even the circum-
stances under which this dog made his
ﬁrst appearance in ﬁshing folklore are
almost unbelievable.

The scene for his dramatic entrance
into the Gloucester picture was laid in
the North Atlantic about three hundred
miles from the nearest land. On a beau-
tiful day in early spring one of the crack
schooners was homeward bound, “load-
ed to the scuppers,” after a long 'hard trip
to the Grand Banks. Visibility was excep-
tionally good and the sea was unusually
smooth for those waters—but not a sail
or a telltale column of smoke was in
sight. One of the crew went to the lee
rail to empty the slop bucket for the cook
when his eye spotted a dark object in the
water almost dead ahead. It is by no
means out of the ordinary to encounter
ﬂotsam of every description on the high
seas and little attention is paid to it unless
it is something to endanger shipping. For
some unexplained reason this looked dif-
ferent from the usual run of debris and
he called it to the attention of some of
the other members of the crew. Much
speculationnwas advanced as to what it

might be ind one said it looked " to him '

as if it were the body of a colored man.
The captain was notiﬁed but when they
were. near enough to make identiﬁcation
pOSitive it roved to be a large New-
foundland og. He was not only alive but
was sw1mm1ng vigorously toward them.
The captain ”'hove the vessel to” and they
soon had him safely aboard. No one ever

rescued at sea was more 'a. , reciativ
, , e
that dog. pp than

When they reached port- inquiries were

started to ﬁnd out how so ﬁne an animal
came to be in that unusual situation and
they lasted for the lifetime .of the dog.
Newfoundland dogs are said to be as
much at home in the water as on the land
but three hundred miles for a casual swrm
is a little too much even for such a noble
breed. All ports of the maritime provmces
of Canada and those of the New England
coast denied any knowledge of the lone
seafarer. No clue was ever found. that
shed any light on his origin and it re-
mains a mystery to this day:

He became a great favorite along the
Gloucester waterfront but the vessel that

71w Psychic D09

SEQUEI.

AFTER READING MR. STOCKBRIDGE’S
story of ”The Psychic Dog,” which
appeared in your June ’57 issue, I think
I can furnish a clue to the origin of the
dog, because I believe he may have been
and probably was my dog.

My story can also provide an explana-
tion why this Newfoundland dog was
found swimming about three hundred
miles from the nearest land when sighted
and picked up 'by a Gloucester Schooner
homeward bound from the Banks on an
early spring day “near the turn of the
century.”

It would be about sixty years ago now,
when I was a lad around four years old,
that my father, who was then skipper of
a trawl ﬁshing schooner sailing out of
Mahone Bay on the east coast of Nova
Scotia, brought a Newfoundland puppy
home to me.

The dog had a black curly pelt with
white patches. As he grew up we were
inseparable, and before long he was big-
ger and heavier than I was. '

About the time he was fully grown, I
ventured upon some young ice in a cove
near our home, broke through into salt
water over my depth, and was taken safe-
ly ashore by Prince who immediately
jumped in beside me and took hold of my
sweater at the shoulder. (I still remember
it was a very nice gray one that'I liked
very much.)

That winter, boys on their way to and
from the one room country school at In-
dian Point, which is a small community
on the shore of Mahone Bay and where
our home was, would sometimes throw
snow balls at the dog on the other side of
the picket fence in front of our home.
Prince probably thought it was a kind of
game and that he was expected to re-
trieve them as when I threw sticks into
the water for him to get.

Naturally he would bark sometimes,
and when he did it was like a lion talk-
ing. This alarmed the little girls who

were also attending the school, and soon
their mothers were expressing concern.

To ease the situation, my father per-
mitted an uncle to take the dog with him
on a schooner that was about to sail to
the West Indies with a cargo of dried
ﬁsh and bring back salt from Turks
Island.

Some weeks later we received a letter
from my uncle informing us that the dog
was lost overboard during a storm. He
also told us that they all wanted “to turn
back and get the dog as they could see
him following in the wake of the ship as
far back as they could see, but the captain
thought they might endanger the vessel
and crew to do so as the schooner was
old and 'heavily loaded. .

I doubt if I could ﬁnd out any more
just where and when this occurred, be-
cause as far as I know, the folks who
might know are all gone by now. (So is
the new puppy I was given soon after-
ward.)

As the courses these two schooners
Would be taking would cross, it seems

uite probable that this could be the same
dog. He would have been still young and
a sharp swimmer.

Maybe the old-timers around Glouces-
ter will agree with me that it could have
been the same dog.

At any rate I shall always be glad for
having run into Mr. Stockbridge’s story,
for I can feel now that my dog was not
lost at sea after all, but found new
friends and had a good home somewhere
in that ﬁne old Gloucester area.

YANKEE [UNE 1957

There is a remarkable similarity between
big game hunters and clam diggers. Both
go armed to the teeth, eager, aggressive
and ferociously determined to outwit any
beast or clam that tries to get the best of
them. Clams don’t greet the early morning
sun with a song, neither do they hiss or
bark—they spit. The clam-digger does not
waste time spitting back. Clams live about
nine inches below the surface of the sand.
Some clam-diggers claim that clams can
skiddo like greased lightning. The clam
is probably six feet to the left and laugh-
ing up his foot at digger’s antics. All the
clam-digger gets for his efforts is a well-
soaked shoe. There is no legal limit on
the number of shoes that may be dug up,
but the experienced clam-digger considers
such maneuvers a waste of time. The
clam-hunters have reached their legal
limit when they extract 20 pounds of
clams, including shells, per digger.
As the sun sets on another day of stren-
uous activity, the hunters, tired but
happy, leave the scene knowing that
clams are where you ﬁnd ’em.

T WAS A DULL, ISOLATED, LITTLE sea-

side spot. A very few people dis-cov-
ered it in the Eighties, when it was noth-
ing more than a ﬁshing village strung
along a forty foot bluff on the eastern
shore of Nantucket Island. From that
bluff you overlooked the entire; Atlantic
ocean, stretching clear to Spain without
interruption, and the air was marvellous.
The big excitement back then was to
watch the dorymen bring their craft in
through the surf at the close of day.
There were two hotels—the ”Ocean
View” and the “Atlantic House.”

In the Nineties it was about the same.
The same grass-bordered dirt lanes led
between the same rows of small shingled
cottages. Sixty dollars would rent, you one
for the season, provided you didn’t mind
horsehair furniture and a total lack of
plumbing. But there were signs of prog-
ress. The narrow gauge tracks of the N an—
tucket Central Railroad had beEn extend-

ed to Siasconset, and you could now cover .
the nine miles from Nantucket town in a
fast ' thirty-ﬁve minutes. People actually
came from distant cities like Detrort, St.
Louis and Cleveland to enjoy the qul€t
and the cool air. . A

’Sconset was ”like a village spilled out 9f

radius of about ten feet. The rest was
darkness.

At half-past eight, or therabouts, the
Nantucket Central made its last trip of
the day, and for an hour or so people
gathered around the dim little post ofﬁce
waiting for the mail to be sorted. Then
it was all over, and by ten o’clock you
were at home in bed reading "The Gen-
tleman From Indiana” or ”The Crossing”
by candlelight, and there wasn’t a sound
except the crickets and the soft, sedative
crash of the surf.

During daylight hours, life centered
around the triangular ”square,” which
had the post ofﬁce and the newsstand for
its base. The latter sold ”college ices,”
Lowney’s chocolates, Necco sweets, al-
mond “kisses” and popcorn bars. Also——
when they arrived—the New York Times,
World, Herald, Trihune and Sun. In the
magazine racks were such publications as

At two p.m. there might be half a
dozen fringe-topped surreys placidly wait-
ing for passengers to the golf links—a
mile out on the Main Road. (You can
still play over the same course.) Off to
your right was the barn-like Casino, erect-
ed in 1900, and three pretty bad tennis
courts. At your immediate left was the
L-shaped Annex of the Ocean View
Hotel, dripping stalactites of carpenter’s
Gothic. Farther around to your left was
the three-storied barracks of the Ocean
View proper, with its long straight cor-
ridors that smelled of paint and fog-
dampened cocoa matting. The proprietor
of this establishment was a thin, gray man
named ”Doc” Powers. He also owned a
silver cornet on which, at the end of the
season, he blew farewell to his guests at
the railroad station as the train pulled out.
And the tune he blew, for reasons which
you will understand, was ”Give My Re-
gards“ to Broadway.”

At two pm. the ping of bicycle bells
was nearly constant, and there might be
as many as thirty people clustered around
the post ofﬁce. The ladies wore ankle
length white duck skirts, sailor blouses
and strange straw hats skewered into place
by protuberant steel pins. The gentle-
men’s attire was also casual—b'andana
handkerchiefs folded about the neck,
striped shirtsleeves and pipes. One or two
of them affected the tight sort of knicker-
bockers drawn by Howard Chandler
Christie. From ‘a distance they all resem-
bled ordinary human beings. They
weren’t.

For once upon a time——and it will
never happen again—this little-known
and unregarded village of ’Sconset was
the actors’ colony of America.

.Do you doubt it? Take the slender man
with deep-set brown eyes who is rolling

the younger, who began his stage career
as a super in his illustrious father’s "Rip

in "The Girl Of The Golden West.”
(His photograph hangs prominently in

in the dark blue Oxford blazer is Con-
way Tearle, who will appear in a succes-
sion of silent ﬁlms. So will Brandon
Hurst, who is chatting with him. Lovely
Isabel Irving may be present, or Percy
Haswell, or Elsie Lombard, who played

YANKEE [UNE 1957

with the elder Jefferson. Or Henrietta
Crossman, or young Madge Kennedy, des-
tined for a rapid rise in the profession
. . . Frank Gillmore, George Fawcett,
Charles Cherry, Walter Hale, John Ma-
son, George Nash, Joseph Kilgour, Wil-
liam Courtleigh, Aubrey Boucicault—
they were all there, and children listened
open-mouthed to the habitual, trained
diction:

”I say, old fellow, shall we see you
this evening?”

Playwright Bronson Howard dealt him-
self endless games of solitaire on the
porch of his small cottage. The “Aunt
Polly,” -William Gillette’s houseboat,
swung gently at her moorings in Nan-
tucket harbor. But only once in a while
would you see the quiet man who created
the role of “Sherlock Holmes.” In an-
other part of the island, Mary Mannering
had a rambling establishment, referred to
for non-apparent reasons, as a ”farm.”
William Faversham hid away in the min-
ute hamlet of Wauwinet, three miles
north of ’Sconset. And it was back there,
when Rostand was good boxofﬁce, that
Agnes Everett—perhaps you saw her in
"The Argyle Case”——started a tiny tea-
shop called "The Chanticleer.” It’s still
going.

When was all this? It’s hard to bracket
accurately. But the Hippodrome was com-
paratively new, and a sensational Spanisih
clown named Marcelline—remember .7—
had been given a life contract by its san-
guine managers. Scratchy phonograph
records were spreading George M. Co-
h'an’s ”Yankee Doodle Boy”—as sung by
Billy Murray—clear across the continent,
and Anna Held’s picture appeared on
cigar boxes. Ki-lted Harry Lauder and his
grotesque stick were headlining, and it
meant something in vaudeville when you
spoke of the ”Gus Sun time,” and the
”Pantage’s circuit.” Vesta Victoria waited
at the church, Bayes and Norworth chant-
ed, ”Come Along My Mandy,” Mont-
gomery and Stone were an inseparable
team, and nothing—Lehar included—had
ever topped the romantic appeal of the
waltz from "Mlle. Modiste.”

It was, in other words, the short, serene
period before 1914—when "Teddy,” Jack

for guests of the Ocean View Hotel and

London, Caruso and “Mr. Dooley” were
standard topics of conversation. Sarah
Bernhardt—with her 45 trunks—was
being paid $8,000 a week to elevate the
two-a-day, and the world’s last wonder
was the transmission of messages through
the air. The ﬁrst wireless station in Amer-
ica was at ’Sconset, and one of its oper-
ators was a slim young man named David
Sarnoff. '

There was just one summer theatre in
the United States, and that was out in
Denver, Colorado. The movies—it was
still a long way to “The Birth of a Na-
tion”—were inconsequential things in
which the ﬂickering images of John Bun-
ny and "Bronco Billy” Anderson might
amuse children at ﬁve cents a head.
(Coney Island’s beer gardens showed
them "for free.”

Therefore, from late June until the end
of August, when casting began, the legi-
timate players "rested” at ’Sconset. Year
after year they returned, regularly as the
swallows at Capistrano, via the Fall River
Line and the plodding paddle wheel
steamers from New Bedford. And the
Nantucket Inquirer and Mirror, which
still keeps its century-old format, would
report that William H. Thompson, Fred-

46

erick Perry, Frank Craven or Digby Bell
had "joined the actors’ colony out in
'Sconset.” There was nothing ephemeral
about it. Several of them bought or built
cottages. Digby Bell was perpetual presr-

‘ dent of the golf club, and Frank Gillmore

managed the Casino, as he later managed
Actors’ Equity. .

What did they do? They heaved medi-
cine balls at each other, presumably for
the sake of their ﬁgures. They played,
quote, tennis, unquote. They played the
worst and most profane golf ever seen
or heard on the ’Sconset links. (146V;

upper arrangements, beneath which—the
whisper rani—some of them wore corsets.

What else did they do? Why, on Fri-
day nights, ‘like everyone else, they went
to the Casino and danced two-steps and
waltzes under the naked ﬂare of the ace-
tylene gas jets—also under the eyes of a
double line of formidable, fan-bearing
chaperones who saw that decorum was
preserved. Gentlemen—and gentlemen
only—smoked out on the verandah, and
at ten ﬁfty-ﬁve, sharp, the three-piece
”orchestra” struck resolutely; into ”Home,
Sweet Home.” By eleven ﬁfteen the lights
were all extinguished, and by eleven
thirty, the last caped and 'pompadoured
girl had parted from her escort at the
door of her cottage. That was late, for
’Sconset.

Yes, but the actors did more than that.
They added, wi'lly—n-illy,‘ color, character
and romance to a place which, but for
them, might have been any other summer
resort. . ,

Swimming, a crude form of tennis and .some of the most profane games of golf ever
heard on the links were the main outdoor occupations of the ’Sconset actors’ colony.

 

Next? comes ageing Fred Tho-rne, English
comedian, and his son-in-law Gustav Von
Seyffertitz, featured in many silent ﬁlms.
Following them is a young man with an
Irish terrier on a leash. He is accom-

anied by his mother because he is stone-
blind. That is Edwin Grasse, violinist,
who will have his own concerts in Carne-
gie Hall . . . The city-dressed (man in the
high, stiff collar is Daniel Frohman, here
on a brief visit. With him is another pro-
ducer, John Golden. The beardless, bored-
lvooking youth in white ﬂannel trousers is
a Yale undergraduate nicknamed “Mon-
ty,”——the future "Man Who Came to
Dinner.” And hush! Do you recognize
the handsome woman just entering the
newsstand ?' You should, if you ever saw
Weber and Fields. Yes, it’s Lillian Rus-
sell, herself, and when she is starred in
”Wildﬁre” the critics will have to admit
that ”fair Lillian is still a peach.”

One second more. Please notice the
two ladies riding by in the slow-moving
surrey. One of them is George Fawcett’s
wife, Percy Haswell. The other is very
old and wears a white lace cap on her

face that will stick in your~mind . . .

  

 

 

 

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

No trees, crowded cottages and no plumb-
ing—yet ’Sconset was the summer home of
Broadway and the darling of Nantucket.

There was a stage in the Casino—a

oor, small thing with tin-shaded, unre-
liable footlights, and a roll-up, jerky cur-
tain that invariably stuck at the wrong
time. “The house” was, roughly, four
hundred wooden chairs of the uncomfort-
able folding kind. The ﬂoor 'being level,
it was hard to see anything from a back
row. But one night each season—general-
ly in mid-August—the place was jammed
—p'acked out—because the actors were
putting on their annual summer show, and
next week’s issue of the Inquirer and
Mirror would state that "a vast throng”
had witnessed the performance.

The shape of the programs didn’t vary
much—solos, recitations, skits. May
Hampton might come 'on in blackf‘ace to
sing George Spink’s "Bill Simmons,” last
of the great "coon songs.” You might
hear Isabel Irving’s incomparable speak-
ing voice in a p'laylet. A groaning De
Wolfe Hopper might be forced into yet
another repetition of “Casey At The Bat,”
and genial George Fawcett might change
himself into a monster in a scene from
”Jekyll and Hyde.” The nervous amateur
orchestra would be conducted by young
Roy Webb—you’ve seen his name a
thousand times as musical director for
Paramount. And occasionally the acety-
lene lights, dimmed to pin-points, would
go out altogether, and the audience would
have to sit patiently while they were re-
lit by hand.

It was summer stuff—an evening’s en-
tertainment by known, familiar ﬁgures—
and good, bad or indifferent, the applause
was always generous.

Yet there was one night when the sus-
tained volume of that applause startle-d
children in the crowd. The curtain rose on
a scene from a play called "A Woman’s
Won’t,” and with it rose people from
Chicago, Detroit, New York, Cleveland,
Boston, St. Louis and even far-away
Texas. They stood and clapped and
cheered, and it was minutes before the
thin-faced, white-haired lady on the stage
could speak a line. “Mrs. G. H. Gilbert,"

48

the Inquirer and Mirror reported, ”was

,,

given an ovation . . .

She was eighty-two and legendary. She
had played with every great actor and
actress of Iher day—Edwin Forrest, Edwin
Booth, Maurice Barrymore, Clara Morris,
Fanny Davenport, Ada Rehan. She had
been a ﬁxed star in the fabled Augustin
Daly Company for thirty years, from its
inception in 1869 until Daly’s death. She
had played in Chicago in 1851, when that
young city had only one theatre. She had
trouped the Middle West in 1849, when
a lot of the travelling had to be done in
a covered wagon. William Winter ﬁrst
saw her in New York in 1867, playing a
French Marquise in a forgotten drama,
and wrote that she gave the most ﬁnished
performance he had ever seen. Why not?
Her experience stretched back to 1833,
when she was a child dancer in Her
Majesty’s Theatre in London, four years

IUNE 1957 YANKEE

 

 




 

before the coronation of Queen Victoria.
But it failed her that evening. The pro-
fession—the combined actors’ colony of

:Sconset—presented her with a silver lov-
Ing cup and a tall rocking chair. Grant
Stewart, as spokesman, recited some pleas-
ant, sentimental verses, asking her to re-
member ’Sconset and the friends she had
made “down there.”

"For while,” he said, "you are
sitting and thinking of them—
”Be sure they are thinking of
you!”

Mrs. Gilbert couldn’t respond.

_ Nothing like that happens in the Ca-
smo now. It can’t, for the actors’ colony
has gone. It vanished, like the surreys
that “drowsed the long tides idle” in
front of the newsstand. Like the funny,
two-car train of the Nantucket Railroad,
W‘thh was sent overseas to help win the
ﬁrst World War. Like the immensely high

YANKEE [UNE 1957

white masts of the original Marconi sta-
tion. Like the simplicity that put up with
kerosene lamps and other inconveniences.

Present day ’Sconset is civilized, with
television antennae, hard-surfaced roads,
electric lights, and sprinklers whirling
over lawns which were once mostly wild
carrot. Jeeps and expensive sports models
park where the carriages used to stand,
and if you asked for the ”Ocean View”
or the ”Atlantic House,” no one would
know what you were talking about.

But the impact of the old time still
lingers. For, as your lumbering sight-see-
ing bus approaches a certain section of
neat, re-vamped and uninteresting little
cottages, your misinformed driver will
lean toward his "mike.”

“An’ this,” he tells you, “was the fa~
mous actors’ colony . .

It wasn’t. But it’s nice to know that
they are not forgotten.

DRIVING PAST THE FINE big houses on
Eastern Point Boulevard in Gl'ouCes-
ter, Massachusetts, we catch glimpses of
the harbor, blue as the summer skies. We
are looking for a place called "Beauport”
—not quite sure of what we’ll ﬁnd, but
going on trust: Samuel Chamberlain,
artist-photographer, liked it enough to
make a book of it; the Society for the
Preservation of New England Antiquities
proudly owns and displays it, and at least
one writer-connoisseur has called it ”the
most fascinating house in America.”

52

Stop! Here is the life-size painted iron
Indian who guards Beauport and the gate-
h'ouse through which visitors enter. We r6
inside, on a pathway which curves
through the garden to a canopied d00f,
and we’re looking up at an inv1t1ng but
slightly fantastic house. It seems to .bkel;
1638 in a fairy tale—a house With 61g
chimneys, no two alike, a house of dormi
efS,‘ towers and turrets, with WlndOWS 0
every size and shape. Its brick and stone
walls are hung With woodi'brnc and iv}?
and adorned with beams, nlchCS, ba '

conies, statues, and pottery animals. Sure-
ly someone with a touch of magic built
this house? And so it was.

Henry Davis Sleeper was Beauport’s
creator, and he worked on it for 30 years,
seldom by plan, always according to in-
spiration. He started with a three-room
cottage on the site, no more than a vaca-
tion retreat. N o doubt he chose the name
”B-eauport” because Samuel Champlain,
on his 160 5 reconnaissance of what would
be Gloucester, called ‘it ”Beau Port”
(Beautiful Harbor).

More than 20 rooms are shown on the
guided tour, and each one has its own
ﬂavor. The grandest is the Chinese Room,
35 feet long, with a ceiling 25 feet high,
shaped like the inside of a pagoda. It
began as a chapel, which Mr. Sleeper then
transformed into a Chinese hall. Mrs.
Helena McCann, who bought and pre-
served Beauport after Sleeper’s death in
1934, made the only major change in this
room, which she turned into a luxurious
Chippendale drawing room, with a grand
piano, English mahogany furniture, an
Italianate marble ﬁreplace, and a mag-
niﬁcent serpentine chandelier of Water-
ford crystal. I
. But the glory of the room, in spite of
its rich furnishings, is the Chinese hand-
painted wallpaper, which Mr. Sleeper dis-
covered. It had been imported, it is said,

for the mansion of Lewis Morris, one of
the signers of the Declaration of Inde-
pendence. Never used, it lay in a Marble-
head attic for more than a century, until
Mr. Sleeper found it and built a room
around it. One or more Chinese artists
must have spent a lifetime on the paint-
ing. One series of pictures shows the mak-
ing of porcelain; another shows rice grow-
ing and harvest. The colors are still vivid
and fresh against a cerulean blue back-
ground. ,

The most traditional room? The L-
shaped Pembroke kitchen, with its great
ﬁreplace, 17th-century pine walls and
furniture, taken from an old Cape Cod
house, and sideboard laden with pewter
and earthenware. Mr. Sleeper was never
content just to establish a mood or pe-
riod—every detail must add to the effect.
The Pembroke Room has dozens of ac-
cessories, from horn-handled cutlery on
the table to a musket hanging on the wall.

The richest room? It could be the 20-
foot Octagon Room, with its octagon walls
and table, furnished in golden ”tiger” or
violin maple, with ﬂowery rugs and hang-
ings. Its plum-black walls set off a Chi-
nese red screen, vermilion tole-ware, and
crimson-bound books. Every detail—and
there are many—-blends into and adds to
the effect, even the red coat of the ofﬁcer
whose portrait hangs above the ﬁreplace.

The Octagon Room is adorned with "tiger” maple furniture and a red lacquer screen.

The most evocative room? Perhaps that
pine-paneled attic gem, the Mariner’s
Room, which has, scattered carelessly
about on its old pine furniture, everything
a captain might have used or collected in
years at sea: sextant, compass, scrimshaw
marlinspike and critb‘bage board, quadrant,
spy-glass. The bound volume of yellowed
Essex newspapers is open at the issue of
September 10, 1814, with a front-page
story of the battle of Lake Erie (”Don’t
give up the ship”). One feels that if one
looks down through the tall windows, one
will see a sailing ship advancing up the
harbor—or perhaps grey waters waiting
for a ship long overdue.

The most beautiful room? Every visitor
will make his own choice, but mine would
be the ”Golden Step” room, with three
white walls and a seaward wall of win-
dows which can be lowered into sockets,
opening the whole room to the sea air.
Dining at the long white table, one might
be on a ship’s deck, for the View is a
ISO-degree arc, looking out toward
Gloucester, Ten Pound Island, and the
reef of Norman’s Woe. On the shoreward
wall is a six-foot model of the square-
rigger, "Golden Step,” set 'on an antique
Chinese bench. A half—model and a
Gloucester ”pinky” also decorate the
walls, with ship-carvings of mermen and
tropical fruits. Table and shelves are

decked with leaf-green English majolica.
The sea is a part of Beauport’s attrac-
tion. One glimpses it constantly from
windows. Its salt-smell and coolness per-
meate the rooms, large or tiny. The house
is built on rusty-pink granite ledges, and
is bordered with terrace-s which over-
look the hanbor. A long ﬂight of stone
steps leads down to the water. The sea
helps to keep the house alive. So do the
vases and nosegays of fresh ﬂowers in the
rooms. And Beauport is in fact still a
summer home. When Mrs. McCann died,
her children in 1942 bequeathed the
place, as her memorial, to the Society for
the Preservation of New England Anti-
quities. A daughter and her husband live
at Beauport during the summer season
(when they are there, the Indian Room,
their private quarters, and the Mariner’s
Room, are not open to the public).
We’ve mentioned only a few of the
rooms. We’ve left out the Jacobean, the
Pineapple, the Strawberry Hill Rooms,
the Shelley and Byron and Lord Nelson
bedrooms, the Tower Library, the collec-
tions of old glass and Chinese Export
porcelain, beautifully displayed—and the
list does not end here. That is one secret
of Beauport’s attraction: the feeling that
around the corner, beyond the next hid-

den doorway, there is always a treasure ~

to discover for the ﬁrst time.

The Chinese Room, left, .in which handpainted Chinese wallpaper sets oﬂ ornate
Chippendale mahogany furniture. Right: the windows of Mariner’s Room look seaward.

  

  
 
   

 

 

 




 

 

Firefly
OLIVER HALE

Day is too huge, the world outlined in sun
stays gross in the mind; only by your light

are the magic-lantern shapes of the night
revealed, the littler, nearer landscapes seen,
where lilliputian winds and insects stir
essential music upon strings of air.

At Morning
DANA SARGENT

Like tall blue cannibals,

These candles will devour themselves,

And this clock that ticks

Will tick only for its own fate.

The silence of this room

Will be an impediment only to itself.

For quickly when the chimney starts ’

Its big breath in the sky,

The sky also will speak:

Gold and ﬂuent will be its mouth,

Crying orioles in the wind.

For the timekeeping mind,

The Sky will keep time

By the dials of sun.

The night-heavy mouth of silence will close
And “morning take up the trumpets of breath.

The Satellite

ANN STANFORD

My face is pale,
My hair is bright
When passing lighted ways.
But darkness molds

Each feature’s shape

In careless ebonies.

Shall I be moon
Reﬂecting light.

And the echo of voice,
Or metamorphosed
Suddenly i

Harden upon the choice.

Beacon Street Pastiehe: June
HANSON KELLOOG

We lived a brownstone way, all buddled

Around a stairwell, Jar/age; at ﬁrer.

Itr vertical exirtence made a bard life dark,

Packed by Juboerrioe ligbt about tbe window
bows.

But trees still formed an awkward strip of park

Along the trolley tracks at Brookline’s edge.

The late spring brought them green to the
banana’s yellow,

Piled ﬂat on pushcarts. Wagons of cut ﬂowers

Flaunted the idle riot of their color

Against the Calvin eyes and splintered hoofs

That drew them. Hurdy-gurdies stopped to play

For paper-wrapped ﬂung money from high
Windows.

With a hi-‘ﬂ age I fail to be impressed. We saw

The monkey and we heard the single tinkles
wrung

From nothing by a handle, and the grinder’s
tongue,

Violent or suave, for pennies. We saw Venice.

It must be lovely to bar/e eoer once been young.

The Mask Remains

The straw hut

IS now a modern oﬂice.

Soft carpets replace

The former hard-packed earth.

Skulls and herbs
Dipped in blood
Are superseded

By the books

Of Freud and Jung.

Man, always horizontal
In these moments,
Now lies on innersprings.

The mask remains —
Though not so hideous.

Sugar Sticks and Spoons

by Henry Bollman, This month’s guest contributor

IF A MAN,” SAID EMERSON, ”has good
corn, or wood, or boards, or pigs to
sell, or can make better chairs, or knives,
crucibles or church organs than anybody
else, you will ﬁnd a broad, hard-beaten
road to his house, though it be in the
woods.” He did NOT mention mouse-
traps-—as so many people think. The
mousetrap was added by a later writer.

However, he stated the very essence of
the Yankee ideal of business, which per-
sists to this day in New England. There
is now a special revival of that spirit in
the general stores, which are springing up
everywhere . . . not only in New England,
but in other parts of the country. A prom-
inent ﬁnancial journal states that it is the
latest trend in merchandising, and is al-
ready classed as "big business.”

Because of its national importance, it
is worthwhile to take a close look at one
of the best examples of this modern-old-
fashioned kind of store. What are the
reasons for its sudden growth . . . what
does it sell?

“The Yankee General Store” in East
Gloucester, Massachusetts, embodies most

62

everything that makes for the success of
this kind of enterprise. It has been suc-
cessful, from the day it opened in the
Spring of 1956.

Bill Huke, the proprietor, served a long
apprenticeship in one of the large na-
tional chain stores. There he learned,
thoroughly, the fine technique of retail
merchandising, before he decided to open
his own store. In addition to his experi-
ence, he has enormous imagination, Com-
bined with Yankee ingenuity in selecting
and displaying his very large stock of
general merchandise.

He chosea site which seemed to violate
the ﬁrst principle of retail success—4a busy
street, where crowds pass the door. He
opened his place of business about two
miles from the shopping center of
Gloucester, where few people pass the
door 077 Foot. "

But, who shops on fOOt, nowadays-—
if they can do so by car? A broad high-
way passes his store, and there is always
plenty of easy parking. The tendency of
the modern shopper is to keep away from
large shopping centers, if she can obtain

[UNE 1957 YANKEE

 

 




 

 

 

Small Business
and Watts

by DAMON RIPLEY

what she wants by a short drive, free of
trafﬁc delays.

Besides offering easy parking, the store
is successful for several other reasons,
such as: ' .

Quick shopping for essentials, Wthh
every family needs, almost every day—n0
need to search through a large department
store for some simple little item—415 what
the Yankee store offers. Here you. can
ﬁnd just what you need—self servrce—
no delays—no crowds—no waste of time
or effort.

Sunlight also plays a part in the suc—
cess of the store. The large windows on
three sides pour a generous cheerful, na-
tural light on the goods, making it pos—
sible to shop by daylight.

There is an unhurried atmosphere, so
different from the harsh, impersonal air
In larger, chain stores. .

So much for the general aspects; now,
let us take a short tour and see what is
Offered for sale in this refreshingly dif-
ferent emporium. '

'Near the entrance is the candy counter,
with a large assortment of penny candies,

reminiscent of the gay nineties. They are
as popular with elderly ladies as with the
children. Here you will 'ﬁnd shoe string
licorice, sugar sticks, jaw breakers, barley
pops, sour balls, Salem mints, peppermint
sticks, beach pebble candies, water melon
slices, bacon slices, bulls eyes, root beer

”barrels, and many other ones, that bring

back childhood days. The candy counter
began small, but is proving so popular, it
grows, and grows, and pushes other items
aside.

On the clothing counter is a compact,
yet adequate supply of clothing needs for
boys and girls. For the boys there are
sport shirts, ﬂannelette shirts, coat sweat-
ers, yarn briefs, cotton sweat shirts, cor-
duroy pants, to mention only a few.

For girls—cotton slips, combed cotton
panties, orlon pull overs, fairy tale dresses,
stretch anklets.

The baby department contains every
staple requirement for the well dressed
baby, and the well equipped nursery.

Hardware for the home is conveniently
displayed, with exactly the items you are
likely to need in a hurry—-electric fuses,
hinges, screws, nails, hooks, locks, keys,
etc.

Kitchenware, gardening supplies, toys,
stationery, greeting cards—all are to be
found in different sections of the store——
selected with uncanny accuracy as to the
very thing you need most, and no more.
There are no surplus, borderline items, to
clutter up the shelves, and distract you
from your immediate requirements.

Besides the departments for staples,
there are scattered through the store, many
specialties, such as pine reproductions of
Early American nutmeg cabinets, candle
stand with drawer, kitchen match safe, up-
right wall bracket with drawer . . made
by local craftsmen.

Gloucester, being an art center, has
many artists, whose work is represented in
beautiful paintings on the walls, and prints
and greeting cards on the counters.

Pie baskets, pie crimpers, wooden spoons,
bean pots, kerosene lanterns, milking stools,
Pepper grinders are some of the items
which suggest the horse and buggy days
but are useful today. Kerosene lanterns
were at a premium during the hurricanes
of last year.

The store, as a whole, is a fascinating
combination of modern merchandising,
along with the simple, honest, unhurried,
sincere store-keeping of our Yankee an:
cestors.

[UNE 1957 YANKEE

 

 




 

 

It proves Emerson’s words are as true
today as they were when he wrote them a
century ago . all Gloucester is follow-
ing the “hard beaten road” to the Yankee
General Store, though it be, relatively,
“in the woods”-——far from the crowded
shopping area where they can ﬁnd ”the
better mousetrap”—quickly, easily, pleas-
antly.

Notes by Damon Ripley
YANKEE’S Roving Reporter

>Say, we’ve always known that Mr. L. L.
Bean was a sport—he’s always sent his
fascinating catalogs free to anyone who
asks for one—but in the new Spring Cata-
log he tells us that he’ll give away an
autographed copy of his book, “Hunting——
Fishing and Camping,” to anyone who
stops in at his salesroom during the month
of July and August! I suppose everyone
knows where Mr. Bean’s salesroom is—
Freeport, Maine, and by now you should
know that it is open 24 hours a day, 365
days a year! So, if you’re traveling Down
East this summer, take exit 9 from Maine’s
Route 1 and pick up your free book. If
you. can’t do that, send off for the free
Spring Catalog. As we say, Mr. Bean is ‘a
real sport!

over the world and even blank checks have
accompanied many orders.

The loom is used by kings and common-
ers, men, women and children and is now
taking its place in the home along with the
sewing machine.

Elphege Nadeau, the youthful-appearing,
keen-witted inventor, is a research and tex-
tile designer. In order to support his family
and ﬁnance his invention he did commis-
sion weaving. In 1949 he put on the market

5 his speed loom with rotary motion that

eliminates foot pedals, the ﬁrst innovation
in looms in about a century.

The 38 inch loom weighs less than 35
pounds and sells for $138 and the 14 inch
loom weighs only 10 pounds and costs
$64.90. Both looms are made of strong,
non-rust aluminum and are carried by their
owners in buses, cars, airplanes and ox
carts. ‘

”People can weave and watch television
at the same time the process has been made
so easy,’f Mr. Nadeau says. "No back-
ground is necessary for the hobby, which is
relaxing and proﬁtable.”

In what one customer referred to as his
”cardboard jungle” Mr. Nadeau has stocks
of cartons containing cones of thread be-
cause he supplies directions forrsetting the

Utilizing the Dow Chemical Company’s

than the conventional wooden and barrel

ideal for Summer camps or lakeside cot-
tages. The initial cost is comparatively low
and there is a minimum of upkeep from
year to year. Send to Hussey Manufacturing

SAYING-S
of the
ORACLE:

N 0 letters answered except through this column. Watch for yours.

>N. Mex.: Dear Oracle: I live in a house
that is out in the open. There is no high land,
trees or other building within a mile. Yet,
when the wind is just right my chimney
smokes. How do you account for it, and what
can I do about it? It’s driving me crazy! U.H.

Answer: Under the circumstances that you
state there can be only one cause; you have
got a leak in your vacuum. Plug that, and
you’ve got it made. The only other thing to
do is move.

>Arz'z.: Dear Oracle: It seems to me that
men’s trousers are the most shapeless, obnox-
lOLlS things on earth! Why don’t they make
gem less ﬂoppy and baggy? (Miss) PrudenCC

Answer: But they did, once, and do you
know the w‘omenfolks complained so that they
made ’em baggy! '

517243.: Dear Oracle: All through the West
men wear boots when they “dress up.” In the
East, they are hardly ever seen. Being com-
fortable, light and not too bad to look at, I
wonder why. A.C.

Answer: Eastern men used to wear boots
for dress, and long before there was any West
known. But they walked a good deal more than
Western men, and their feet got so big that
it took two calf-skins to make a pair of boots.
The expense was so great that they went out
of style.

Flowa: Dear Oracle: "—and I don’t see any
reason why pole beans have to be trained to
climb a stick! S.V.

Answer: They don’t. But one time a neigh-
bor of our’s trained his to run on a fence
find they found the going so easy that half of
em went clean off the farm. And then the
Owner of the land refused to let him come
and Pick 'em and they had a fight and our
neighbor lost three of his front teeth. And
then they went to court and the judge said that

YANKEE [UNE 1957

 

no man had a right to turn loose anything
alive and moving on to the property of an-
other and so the neighbor had to pay damages
and costs. You’d better stick to the poles,
brother, they are less expensive!

>Kans.: Dear Oracle: Would you know what
sort of feed a chicken might prefer if he had
his choice? I am experimenting. 1.].

Answer: We have had occasion to delve
into this subject some. We ﬁnd that a chicken,
or fowl, will eat all kinds of grain, fruit, raw,
cooked or rotten, any vegetable, meat, bone,
gristle, glass, nails, gravel, watchkeys, nuts,
bolts, if they ain’t too big, false teeth, grass,
buds, carpet tacks, and the heft of breakfast
foods. We say the heft of ’em. There is one,
we won’t mention the name, that is advertised
as being the biggest seller in the nation. That
kids and grown-ups holler for it, and gain
weight from eating it. But somehow we
haven’t been able to get a chicken to even
smell of the stuff!

>Ohio: Dear Oracle: Is there any superstition
about which boot or shoe should be put on
first? 0.].

Answer: Yes. Anciently, the devil was sup-
posed to prowl about on earth and men were
afraid of being takenfor him and maybe as-
saulted before they could prove their identity.
The devil’s left foot is supposed to be cloven,
and so men would put the right boot on ﬁrst
to prove that they weren’t afraid to exhibit the

left.

>Mz'ss.: Dear Oracle: I am a young, married
woman and an argument threatens to disrupt
our respective families. It is whether or not
married couples should sleep in a double bed.
What is your opinion? (name and initials
withheld.)

Answer: We can tell you this with certainty,
it is a darned sight more comfortable and prac-
tical than sleeping in a single bed!

The other day as a customer went out an
alley cat ran in. Instead of hooshing the
cat out, Gordon looked at him a moment
and then said, "He’s cold,” and let him
stay. He had put himself in the cat’s place,
and the result was a warm feeling and a
kind act.

Such a man does a lot of good. He not
only provides a refuge for the Cambridge
wits, who offer him the questionable repay-
ment of putting him into their articles and
books: he lends his customers money as
well as solace and sympathy. He writes
soothing letters to those unfortunates who
have had to leave Cambridge. He comforts
the wives of poets. He baby-sits for the
young married instructors. He buys an old
book from a student who needs train fare
to New York. If an artist is broke, Gordon
puts his pictures on top of the bookshelves
and plugs them for sale. There are several
there now. He helps publishers to ﬁnd
books, and authors to ﬁnd publishers,
writer to ﬁnd writer, and scholar, scholar:
his store is a meeting place. He cheers the
despondent and comforts the afﬂicted. He
visits the sick, and he loves funerals, keep-
ing a separate suit inviolate for these favor-
ite functions. Last year he allowed a girl
who was writing a novel, to work in the
back room, a catchall, which contains a desk
and a telephone under a green metal shade
suspended from the ceiling, a huge curved
hook fastening the rear door, which opens
and shuts with an Inner Sanctum groan,
and a mountain of cartons and wrapping
paper which would delight the heart of an
arsonist. The girl was so grateful she
cleaned up that Chamber of Horrors, a
monumental job, but to Gordon’s mixed
satisfaction and dismay, for change even for
the better is hard for him to take. But he
did like the check which turned up toward
the bottom of the pile of papers .on his
desk. The customer had died but his check
was still good. -

Gordon Cairnie is an individual, chuck-
ablock full of Scotch and Yankee inde:
pendence. He wears what he pleases—-
usually a cap, a Harris tweed jacket, sag-
kneed chino pants, and long underwear in

[UNE .1957 YANKEE

 




 

the winter, unironed striped half-sleeveless
jerseys in the summer, ,and he wears out
one tie at a time. He scorns consistency:
he will work harder to save a penny than
he will to earn a dollar. He thinks what
he pleases, does what he pleases. He has a
horror of draughts and fears colds. On cold
days you’ll ﬁnd him capped, overcoated and
overshoed, sitting on the couch, or, more
rarely, running his vacuum cleaner. If a
customer fails to close the door tight, Gor-
don leaps up, pushes the door shut with a
loud and disapproving slam, looking dark
thoughts. The old customers understand
this: they know it’s an act, know Gordon’s
bark is worse than his bite. But strangers
don’t.

Curious as a squirrel, Gordon collects
news and passes it on. He is the town-crier,
the clearing - house for Harvard Square
news. His store is his salon, the seat of
his social life, the stage from which he
projects himself. It is one of the few city
places of business left where people can
meet, talk, and take their ease. His shop is
not so much a livelihood as a way of life.
That’s why he’ll never sell it, although
somebody tries to buy it from time to time,
somebody who is sure he could make more
money at the stand than Gordon does.

He hasn’t had a bargain sale in his thirty
years of business, and he has been known
to take books home to his house in Bel-
mont to save them from the clutching hands
of an importunate customer. In a world of
more and more machine made things, in
Which the heart withers and fewer and
fewer men dare claim the right to be them-
selves, he and his handrun store are rare
relics. As Bill Fleming, the grizzled, Dun-
drearyish janitor in the building which
houses Gordon’s shop, says, dolefully,

There’s a man will be missed when he’s
gone." Bill, who drops in the shop a dozen
tlfpes a day to talk politics and poetry, says
thlS as if Gordon’s going was just aroun
the corner, but the latter’ll be around a long
time, Providing a theatre for the education
0f. self of which many Harvard and Rad-
Cllﬂe students and professors, past and
present, young and old, have taken good
advantage. He wants to live forever, and
It wouldn’t surprise me if he did—almost.
When he does go, a Cambridge institution
goes with him. But he will live on in story
Like his predecessor John Bartlett of

Bartlett’s Quotations” fame, who ran an-
other humane and humanistic bookstore. a
hundred years ago a scant three blocks up
the avenue.

June Is A

Happy
Companion!

hy DUNCAN MACDONALD

Now MORE THAN EVER IS IT pleasing
to take to the open road. Friends or
relatives, mountain, farm, or seashore—
whatever lies at the end of the leafy
avenue, June goes along as a happy trav-
eling companion.

No month is this for going on a
straight line like the unimaginative crow,
but one for wandering happily and turn-
ing off on beguiling paths along the way.

At the end of one bypath well worth
taking is the Royall House in Medford,
Massachusetts, little publicized consider-
ing that it is one of our handsomest 18th
Century houses—with part of it dating
from 1637. This early date is that of
Governor John Winthrop’s farmhouse,
purchased in 1732 by Colonel Isaac Roy-
all, a wealthy merchant who established
the Royall Professorship at Harvard Law
School. Royall used one wall of the old
farmhouse in building the present struc-
ture. ‘

After more than 300 years, 'here is still
a really noble house that has been re-
painted, redecorated, and just generally
revived with complete and tender devo-
tion to the spirit of the _18th Century.

The main room of the house is“ the
"West Parlor” which is generously light-

Duncan MacDonald seems
ready to tour Old New
England in an old car. She
25 shown at the wheel of a
1911 Simplex that is the
center of attention at the
current series of meets of
The Veteran Motor Car
Club of America. Duncan
zs ‘heard Monday through
Friday over WNAC, Bos-
ton and the Yankee Net-
work. Right: The Marble
Room of the Royall House.

  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 

 

 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
   




ed on two sides by four large (24 small
anes each) windows and focuses on an
exquisite tile ﬁreplace. In deciding how
to repaint this room, Arthur Finney of
Medford, who has lavished his affection
and his decorator’s skill“ on the house
for many years, scraped down a little
patch of the paint, coat by coat, to deter-
mine the original color. The next problem
was to decide what color to have the silk
damask draperies. This was chosen to
match the antique mauve ﬁreplace tiles,
giving the room a deft color pattern and
keeping the focus on the ﬁreplace.

Draperies in the house were contribut-
r ed by the noted Scalamandre who ﬂew up
from New York and in a burst of en-
thusiasm offered anything that was need-
ed in the way of draperies and other ma-
terials from his work rooms.

In the dining room we ﬁnd panelling
painted to simulate cedar which, strange-
ly, was characteristic of the period. The
windows are draped with an authentic
blue ”resist” print, and the valances are
designed on a contemporary pattern.

What was evidently the master bed-
room has always been called the ”Marble
Chamber,” a name that puzzled people
Who did not know of the itinerant paint-
ers who busied themselves simulating
marble as well as cedar. An inventory in
1739 described this room as having green
woodwork, two walls covered with leather
painted in China, and draperies, bedcov-
ering, and upholstery of crimson damask.
Ornamental pil‘asters in the room have
now again been faithfully marbelized,
and Mr. Finney, following the 18th Cen-
tury custom, has done a primitive paint-
mg of the estate, applying it directly to a

SOUP ’N’ SALAD TIME!

As the days grow warmer, meals be-
come lighter with soups and salads coming
to the fore.

Down Skowhegan way Mary Merrill has
the reputation of turning out a really great
Maine ﬁsh chowder. In the new book she's
just written with Mildred Falk Loew,
"The Week-End Cookbook," she gives a
recipe for a real island chowder.

”Of course,” she says, ”it is traditionally
made of white perch, brook trout, or river
salmon, still chilly from the clear, cold
water. However, any fresh or frozen ﬁsh
will do admirably. Prepare the chowder a
day ahead in an iron kettle, stainless steel
or enamel saucepan.

"Get out Grandmother’s red tablecloth
and white ironstone soup tureen and settle
down to a real Yankee ‘feed.’ ”

Note the easy step-by—step directions,
which are typical of this cookbook:

One Day Ahead
A Prepare through Step 4. Refrigerate

in covered bowl.

B Twenty minutes before serving, pro-

ceed with Step 5.

2 pounds fresh or frozen ﬁsh ﬁllets
2 cups water
4 medium yellow onions, peeled and
sliced thin
4 medium white potatoes, peeled and
sliced thin

For another soup ’n’ salad combination,
we look into a new cookbook called ”The
Summer Kitchen” by Louise Andrews Kent
and her daughter, Elizabeth Kent Gay. As
in other Kent cookbooks, ”Mrs. Apple-
yard” is the witty protagonist. She suggests
Vermont Cheese Soup, and begins by cut-
ting ﬁnely:

1/2 cup celery

1/2 cup carrots

1/2 cup onion

1/2 cup green pepper

Cook the above gently in 1/4 cup butter

or chicken fat till the onion is tender

and pale gold in color. Then add 2 cups
chicken stock and let it simmer. While
the vegetables are cooking, make this
sauce:

6 tableSpoons butter

6 tablespoons ﬂour

1 cup grated cheese

1 quart rich Vermont milk or

5 cups ordinary milk and

1 cup cream

~ salt and pepper to taste

Melt the butter. Blend in the ﬂour.

Reduce heat; blend in the milk and

cream. Add cheese and seasoningsﬂsalt,

pepper, a pinch of mixed herbs . . . The

Vegetables should not be mushy but

Sllghtly Crisp . . . Stir and serve.

Mrs. Kent also passes on a Fruit and
Scallion Salad that she says was given 110
hefﬁy a friend in Montpelier: Combine
sections from 1 grapefruit and 1 orange;
1 avocado, diced; 1 green pepper, sliced
Ehln; 1 bunch scallions, ﬁnely cut; and
ettuce. Toss together with French dressinggj

AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED, June, the
traditional month for bustin’ out all
over, started the ﬁrst week in March.
Something in my horoscope must have
called for public platform and lectern.
T'hree speaking engagements in as many
weeks have left me both exhilarated and
limp. (If you’d rather not hear about it,
ﬂip over to the Swopper’s Column or the
ads for deerskin gloves. You can’t say I
didn’t warn you.)

UNACCUSTOMED AS I AM

Two of these unexpected appearances
before the public sprang from my asso-
ciation with YANKEE, and more enjoy-
able encounter-s I :have never had. The
first was an invitation to speak before a
local group of authors on the Ciardi-
Lindbergh controversy then burning up
the pages of The Saturday Review. Their
reason for asking me, the President ex-
plained, was because I was both a poet
and an editor of poetry. Having just de-
livered myself of a two-page letter of
indignation to Norman Cousins, editor of
SR, I was full of the subject, and quite

happy to talk about it. (For those of you
who didn’t read the pros and cons of this
cause celehre, John Ciardi in reviewing
Anne Lindbergh’s The Unicorn, delivered
such a verbal pasting that it will undoubt-
edly go down in history as one of the
most vituperative bits of criticism ever to
ﬁnd its way into print. The reaction was
the biggest storm of protest in the history
of the magazine.) One of the other speak-
ers that evening was Courtnay Anderson
(whose wife sat next to me at the head
table and told me she was from Man-
chester, Massachusetts, and an enthusiastic
subscriber to YANKEE.) Mr. Anderson
was exposed to New England during his
college days at Dartmouth, and his recent
book, published by Little, Brown, carries
the charming title To The Golden Shore.
It’s the story of Adoniran Judson, the ﬁrst
American missionary to a foreign coun-
try, and if you haven’t read it, do. Among
the many guests were Dr. and Mrs. Rob-
ert Moore of Borestone Mountain, Maine
(he is noted for his Poetry Awards an-
thologies and generous prizes in the ﬁeld
of poetry). Presiding was Margaret

Leighton, born in Cambridge, Massa-

Margaret is the author of many books for
Children, notably [udith of France and
The Sword and the Compass. A delight—
ful evening with stimulating, creative
people—and all because I was a member
of the YANKEE family.

The second sortie was a weekend for
YANKEE in San Francisco, prompted by
an invitation to speak to the creative writ-
ing students of Dominican College in San
Rafael. How I happened to get that far
aﬁeld is explained by the fact that one of
the English professors there, Sarah (Sal-
ly) Wingate Taylor, had been in cor-
respondence with me about poetry for a
year or more, and we had become friends.
Never having met me, she bravely asked
me to talk to her girls, and 1, equally
bravely, accepted. I don’t know how many
times in the intervening weeks she woke
in the night wondering if she had lost her
good New England common sense—Sally

StOljmy sky, with soft spitting rain alter-

Angel of Healing), across The Golden

. r.“

No words of mine, no Technicolor
movie, could bring you half the picture.
I would need lto tbottle some of the fra-
grances too (eucalyptus and incense cedar
among many—my nose was quivering
like a happy spaniel’s most of the day);
I would have to pick for you a spray of
the ﬂowering plum or put into your hands
a handful of daffodils that lined the
paths, or the spicy eglantine we rubbed
between our ﬁngers. Even more than that.
I would have to communicate at a level
deeper than words the spirit of the place.
Did you ever step into a home and know
immediately and intuitively that the peo-

le who lived there loved each other?
This is what I felt at Dominican. I was
surrounded not only by gaiety and youth-
ful high spirits, not just by an almost
tangible serenity, but by a radiant and
robust affection. I felt it moving out from
the walls as we ate lunch, deftly served
us by one of the younger nuns; I touched
it in Sister Thomas’s handshake and heard
it in College President Sister Patrick’s
warm words of welcome. It was shining
out of a roomful of smiling students gath-
ered to greet me in the living room of
”Meadowl'ands,” the Freshman dormitory.
What did I tell them? Something about
the artist-artisan split personality of the
writer and how to harness the two sides
of our natures into a working team. Some-
thing about the importance of writing
from one’s own center instead of from
someone else’s. A plea for non-conform-
ity, for peeling off the outer layers to lay
bare the responsive querying innocence
that is our core, and from which we

create. Afterwards Sally and I walked
back to the Library, trailed by a quartet
of students. I couldn’t help but think of
myself twenty years ago in a similar set-
ting, of all the dreams I had then that
didn’t come true, and of the unexpectedly

. beautiful things that did. I looked at those

young unmarked faces. They would never
be quite that happy again, never in just
that way. But I didn’t tell them that.

To Sally Wingate Taylor and all the
many others who made this Visit so un-
forgettable—herewith my public thanks!

THE NEXT DAY

A friend looked at me in horror. ”You
mean to tell me you are planning to en-
tertain ﬁfteen poets in one room! You’re
out of your mind! They’re the most ego-
centric people in the world!” I assured her
I was going to do just that, and explained
sweetly that I was sure nothing but good
would come of it. Nothing but good did.
A dear San Francisco friend, Louise Bray,
loaned her apartment for the occasion, as
well as her talents for brandy-rum punch
and hors d’oeuvres. The sun shone after
the rain, and a brisk wind blew from the
Bay. Among those gathered in the sunny
living room for good conversation about
poetry in general and YANKEE in particu-
lar, were Madeline Gleason, James
Broughton, Eve Triem, Alan W. Watts
(famous for his books and lectures on Zen
Buddhism and comparative religion) Elma
Dean, Dana Sargent, Sarah Wingate Tay-
lor and Olive Thurman Wong. Eric Barker
was expected from Big Sur but he was
kept behind by a documentary ﬁlm at Pt.
Lobos in which he and Novelist Henry
Miller had parts. I can herby relate that
as far as I am concerned a roomful of poets
is as delightful an assembly as could be
imagined! Fie on the stereotypers—not a
one. wore sandals or a beard!

FAN MAIL

From Boston and Los Angeles come
words of praise for the WCL. I have been
dodging so many spitballs over this col-
umn that it is a pleasure to quote the
following excerpts: From a writer in Bos-
ton: "The West Coast Letter is an abso-
lute gem, witty and sparkling and inform-
ative.” From a reader in Los Angeles:
"I like your style—free and easy. Your
article gives much information about Cal-
ifornia . A western article ruin YAN-
KEE? Some of those who objected do not
realize that we have Yankees galore, plus
history ditto, some of it as old as the
east has. Too bad a few think that we are
not ”ﬁttin” to be in Yankee . Your
article has added much to the magazine.”

Thank you, nice people. Those who
Write and those who don’t. If you weren’t
SUCh a good audience I wouldn’t have
anything to say.

I’ll be back!

From “The Great Chain of Life"

The Great Chain of Life by Joseph Wood
Krutch, illustrated with line drawings by Paul
Landacre, 227 pages, $3.75, Houghton Miﬂlin
Company, Park Street, Boston, Mass.

Here the author, an obvious student of
Nature and philosophy, translates many fasci-
nating scientiﬁc conjectures into layman’s lan—
guage. How does the sex life of plants band
insects in any way parallel that of man and
how come the lowly dandelion may inherit the
earth? Why did man descend from the sala-
mander rather than the ant? In Krutch’s
Epilogue to this book, however, remains the
tour de force with which all of us are or
should be concerned; namely, the delving into
why man has lost but may regain gladness, if
he will allow himself to, from the observations
of a single robin.

Growing Flowers by John H. Tobe, 367 pages,
$5.00 from the author at St. ’Catharines, On-
tario, Canada. Rambling treatment of garden
themes interspersed with anecdotes, philosophy
and humor.

Herh: Dererihea’ by Eleanor Pierrepont Chal-
ﬁn, 52 pages, no price given, Mutual Press,

stead at Bristol, R. I.

The Vengeful Sea, by Edward Rowe Snow,
307 pages, $4.00, Dod, Mead Company, New
York. Sea disasters and storms told in the
popular Snow manner. YANKEE readers always
enjoy Snow’s stories—this is a book full of
them you will surely want.

When Did it Happen? by Stanford Mirkin,
434 pages with Index, Ives Washburn Co.,
N.Y.C. Handy comprehensive book of dates
of what’s happened on each day of the year
since goodness knows when——amusingly and
intelligently explained. The author has

”swiped” a few from The Old Farmer's Al-
manac—no doubt unwittingly—but we’ll soon
return the favor. One of his most fascinating
dates is that for 1837, June 20th—the day
Victoria demanded a room of her own. It's an
accurate job this and well done but just for
the reason it is rainy and cold outside at the
moment we’ll jibe that Kidd was "gibbeted"
rather than "hanged," that the earth went
through the tail of Halley’s Comet instead of
the Comet "passing over the sun," and that
Germany surrendered at 6:01 PM. E.W.T.
May 8, 1945 rather than on the day before.
What’s that you said, Mr. Mirkin?

Reprint: by Lawrence Romaine of Middleboro,
Massachusetts. One is about a witness to the
surrender of General Hull at Detroit, August
16, 1812—the other about a veteran who
marched from Cambridge to Champlain March
18 to May 5, 1776. Sort of historical diaries,
we’d say, in limited editions. The two for
ﬁfteen dollars.

rine F. Berry. 176 pages, $3.50, Falmouth Pub.

"Ayuh, I see him all right. Him and his
fancy horses and his big white house.
No wonder the place looks so sharp, he gets his paint at Fred Fletcher’s! That paint
must be mighty dear!” "Now hold on, Lem, don’t get riled up. The Squire’s not so
bad as you think. Besides, With Fletcher’s he only paints every ten years. I buy
Fletcher’s paint, too!”

Yes, Fred Fletcher’s OLD NEW HAMPSHIRE lead base paint is designed for our
rugged New England climate. Resists chipping and is as strong as iron. If you want a

SAYING-S
of the
ORACLE:

 

N 0 letters answered except throng/9 ibis column. Watch for yours.

>Penn.: Dear Oracle: You have never men-
tioned anything about hunting. A real Yankee
should be a hunter by nature, seems so. 0.].

Answer: Well, we have gunned a little mite,
but we got awfully discouraged as a boy. We
hunted a cussed fox that had bothered the
neighborhood. We darned nigh got him too,
forty times, but he fouled up the dogs right
alongside of our own woodshed, every time.
Eventually we discovered that he went right
into the woodshed, and jumped up and
grabbed a wooden pin in a corner, where he
hung along with half a dozen fox-pelts that
were hanging there! No wonder the dogs were
bafﬂed, ye gods! As for ourself, we didn’t
ﬁgure that we were any match for such a
conniving critter.

>Maine:- Dear Oracle: When I read your
column it always seems to me that you must
have spent a lifetime travelling about, working
at all sorts of jobs and delving into a variety
of things in order to know the answers to so
many quesstions. How about it? W.A.

Answer: Some old-timer once said that the
Lord gave a man two ears and two eyes and
but one mouth to indicate that he should spend
twice the time listening and looking, that he
did in speaking. ’Tis a good philosophy and
contains the heft of the answer to your ques-
tron.

>New Hampshire: Dear Oracle: Did you
ever try to ﬁgure out why a cabbage has so
many layers of leaves outside of the head? E..S.
Answer: We always figured ’twas so the
cussed worms would have to work harder to
get to the head and thus a man stands some
chance of enjoying the fruits of his labor.

>N.Y.: Dear Oracle: Perhaps you didn’t know
4

this, but "York State” is the original source
of the many stories about the "lazy hired man.”
P. .

irinswer: We know. And this was the orig-
inal yarn. The hired man, so his boss said,
was chopping wood at the woodshed. His axe
caught in a clothes-line and came down and
split his head clean in two. "And, says he,
the coot never would have known it if a
neighbor hadn’t come along and told him!”

>O/Jio: Dear Oracle: What part of the hay-
ing season did you enjoy most as a boy? S.C.

Answer: The nights. We couldn’t hay-it
then!

>Mz'ss0urz': Dear Oracle: I guess it is tradi-
tional, the country over, to milk a cow on the
righthand side (of the cow). But why? D.B.

Answer: The custom goes clean back into
the days of antiquity. It is claimed that cows
used to be rigged like goats, with only two
spigots. The right hand served best for milk-
ing. Even today, after the additional spigots
have been developed, the largest and fullest
stand at the righthand of the milker, as he sits.

>Missouri: Dear Oracle: Can you give me
any tips on the handling of bees? F.N.

Answer: The perfect costume for such do-
ings is a suit of ancient armor. If you can’t
get that, a steel oil-drum may serve if you
have a handle on the inside of the lid to hold
it down. Our best advice, if you have bees to
be handled, is to hire somebody else to do
it. Preferably somebody that you don’t care
much about.

>N.Y.: Dear Oracle: Why are corn-cribs built
on posts? T.N.

Answer: To keep out rats, for cripes sake!

EACH YEAR I LOOK FORWARD TO PRE-
_ viewing the spring fashions at the
Hotel Pierre in New York. With the
nation’s other fashion editors, I watch the
attractive models parade across the stage
and runway to illustrate the creative think-
ing of America’s foremost designers. It
is always interesting to renew acquaint—
ances and to think only of fashion for a
solid week. Of course we take reams and
reams of notes. And of course we talk.
The note-taking and the talk this year
centered around “the chemise, or as Larry
Aldrich calls it, the ”unﬁtted silhouette.”

.I have been watching, and admiring,
the Aldrich collections over a period of
ten years, and therefore my memory need-
ed only a slight jog to be reminded that
while for most people the “unﬁtted sil-
houette” was news, Larry Aldrich has
been fostering this look for several years.
Forward-looking and forward-thinking,
Mr. Aldrich began to introduce the idea
in 1950, but found it was a little too soon
for the public to accept it. In 1954 he
took a more deﬁnite step in this direction,
and as he told me in New York, ”Now

it is a major silhouette change.”

Naturally when I view the collection
of any designer, the thought uppermost
in my mind is, will New England women
like these clothes? The answer, I knew
as I viewed the Aldrich models, is em-
phatically ”Yes!” And the reason is that
they are elegant because of their sim-
plicity. ‘

I wondered if Larry Aldrich had roots
here. No, but this curiosity led to the
discovery that his designer, Marie Mc-
Carthy, was born on Brattle Street in
Cambridge, Massachusetts, attended Rad-

YANKEE MARCH 1958

    

cliffe, worked at Filene’s, and had her
own shop on Boston’s Newbury Street.

It was while Marie McCarthy was a
buyer for Filene’s French Shop that Mr.
Aldrich became aware of her unerring
taste, her ﬂair for spotting the new things,
and ‘her occasional incisive criticism.
”Marie invariably selected the newest and
smartest clothes," Larry said, ”and I felt
she had the makings of a designer.”
When he talked to her about joining his
ﬁrm, she was so difﬁdent that it took him
three years to persuade her.

Interviewing Miss McCarthy at the
Aldrich show room, I found out just how
she goes about this business of designing.
What happens between the time a dress is
just a dream in a dim corner of the imag-
ination and the electrifying moment when
it appears at a luncheon or a dinner.

First, there are the trips abroad, twice
a year, just for ”inspiration” and to get
the ”feeling” of the new silhouette from
the Parisian designers who work without
restriction as to style or price, and who
design for women all over the world.

Then, returning home, working on the
silhouette for the American market. Then
follow decisions as to fabric, and ﬁnally,
the actual design. Since Marie does not
know anything about sewing or pattern-
making (thus her reluctance to become a
designer), she makes a very rough sketch,
attaching a'sample of the fabric, and gives
details as "to how the dress is to be made.

Marie explained, ”It takes about ten
to twelve weeks to do a collection. The
ﬁrst four weeks are experimental. You
try a smattering of things. The best
clothes are made the last three weeks.
Most of what you do the ﬁrst few weeks

Robert Coombs of Jacksonville, Vermont, guides Duncan MacDonald through a cle-
lz'g/otful cloud of maple steam to the evaporator where maple sap becomes syrup.

you discard—the last few weeks go very
fast, and these designs are usually the
'best."

Marie feels that there are many women
with fashion sense, but most of them do
not have conﬁdence in their own judg-
ment. Perhaps that is a bit of advice we
can take to ourselves: to trust our own
idea of the way we should look.

Here is one of Larry Aldrich’s pre-
cepts. “Any dress that is not fussy is
young looking. Whenever a dress be-
comes fussy, it becomes matronly.”

You will see from the photographs that
the clothes Marie McCarthy has designed
for Larry Aldrich are simple and unclut-
tered, and for that reason, youthful.

Lilly Dache was in town, just back
from Paris of course, and interesting as
always. At her penthouse in the Dache
building on East 56th Street at a small

party we discussed her youthful appear-
ance. "It’s becauseI work so hard,” she
said. ”I used to work ten and twelve
hours a day. Now I work sixteen and
eighteen. And don’t forget the Queen
Bee!”

>x< >x< :1:

When, each year, two of the lesser
spheres of the Universe move closer to
each other, the one on which we live
and another called the Sun, many miracles
occur.

As a kind of prelude to all that fol-
lows, the daily temperatures gradually
rise. Then, a sudden thrill runs through
the sugar maples, and in their wooden
hearts they know the time has come to
give of their bounty to the world, just as
their forebears have done for tens of
thousands of years.

Sharing this delight, I drove u to
Jacksonville, Vermont, in Win ham

MARCH 1958 YANKEE

 

 




 

 

County, to see Robert G. Coombs. He
and his wife Mary are right in the heart
of the sugar maple country.

It was a beautiful March day, and this
celestial impulse had sent the sap surging
upward in the maples so that all along
the way I had seen buckets overﬂowing.
There was something in the air that made
you understand the exuberance of the
trees, and why the farmers couldn’t get
around to all thebuckets in time.

Mr. Coombs is the center of all of
this activity in his area, buying syrup
from about 500 farmers. He sells some
of the syrup, and also produces about 80
tons of maple sugar and maple sugar
candies for shipment to every state in the
Union and to many foreign countries.

Mary Coombs has worked side by side
with her husband from the ﬁrst. ”We
started,” she recalls, ”with that little
20x20 garage that was already here. We
certainly didn’t have anything to build a
building with in those days. We convert-
ed the little old garage into a make-shift
sugar house, and we had just one kettle
and one marble slab and a little coke-
ﬁred candy stove at that time.”

The Coombs’ production of maple
syrup, maple cream, and map-1e candy has
come a long way since then, as you realize
when you look at their greatly enlarged
quarters and their modern water-jacketed
kettles with mechanical stirring equip-
ment.

Mary Coombs didn’t have to learn
about maple syrup from books. She grew
up in a maple farmer’s family. Her
father’s sugar house is right down the
road, and when we went into the sugar
house, I was introduced to cousins and
uncles and nieces. They all had a part in
the production.

They stood around smiling while I
learned a lot of new things about making
maple syrup. I saw the maple sap slowly
circulating around the hot mazes of the
evaporator, and gradually taking on color
and consistency until it was maple syrup.

Then we scattered spills of hot maple
syrup over the snow and eating it, en-
joyed that traditional dish, "sugar on
snow.” I was reminded of Mary Pearl of
Burlington, Vermont and her book, ”Ver-

mont Maple Recipes.”

”And, after gathering the sap and
boiling it down, there’ll be a ‘sugarin’
off.’ Slabs of home-made bread, dill
pickles, dozens of raised doughnuts and
baked ham, with eggs boiled in the sap,
are part of the feast. The main dish,
however, is sugar on snow—golden
syrup cooked just enough to set in little
pools on hard packed snow and then
popped into the mouth.”

Mary Pearl quotes a farm woman as
once having said to her, "Almost any
good recipe is better with maple sugar
or syrup added.” This, as Mary Pearl sug-
gests, may be a little far-fetched. How-
ever, I’ve just never known anybody who
didn’t like the ﬂavor of maple syrup. So
let’s consider a few recipes that use the
maple ﬂavor as a magic ingredient.

“Say it with Syrup”
at EASTER TIME

The coming of Spring and the approach-
ing Easter Season means Maple Syrup Time
to all Vermonters. This is the time of the
year, the last few days of winter, the ﬁrst
few days of spring, when the sap is rising
in the maple trees and all of us Vermonters
talk about maple syrup and get spring fever.
It is only during this one period in the
whole year that maple sap can be gathered
and boiled down to make the rich, golden
syrup for which Vermont is famous. New
freshly made maple syrup is a must for the
Easrer breakfast. It is the perfect Easter
Gift. That is why folks from Vermont and
all over New England "Say it with Syrup”
at Easter Time.

simply add a small amount of water to
the sugar and cook very slowly until sugar
is entirely melted and mixture is of the
consistency of syrup.

A Boston Vermonter I most particu-
larly like is Dorothy Crandall, Food
Editor of Tlae Boston Globe. Her family
place is at Essex Junction, six miles from
Burlington.

"This time of year,” she tells me, "peo-
ple up around Essex Junction ea't very
heartily. To meet the needs of my sister
and ﬁve brothers, my Mother often pre-
pared what we called

Ragamulﬁns

Take baking powder biscuit dough and

roll it out very lightly on the board

until about 1/2-inch thick. Then spread

it with soft butter and then with maple

sugar, or maple syrup. Roll it up like a

jelly roll, slice, and bake in a ﬂat pan.

 

 

Or if you like more crust, bake in
muﬁ’in tins. Delicious with cold milk
or coffee.

 

They are sort of ragged-looking, and
so we called them ragamufhns. This is
really my favorite of all the Vermont
maple recipes.”

Young Republic,” by featuring the de-
signs in YANKEE. This ﬁrst series was
based on 18th century art and history,
while the present collection uses 19th cen-
tury growth and expansion of the Re-
public as its theme.

There are ten original print designs,
three documentary prints, and four re-
lated woven fabrics. The three documen-
taries are derived from fabrics of the era
in the collection of Mrs. Jason Wester-
ﬁeld of Camden, Maine.

In the four woven fabrics is a rich
cotton and linen upholstery fabric called
“Heath House,” which is based on a blue
and white hand loomed coverlet (about
1850) from Brookline, Massachusetts.

The work of a Vermont woman (about
1835) is represented in one of the orig-
inal prints, ”Parlor Piece,” the design of
which is taken from a carpet made of
wool-embroidered squares.

NEW DISCOVERY
ASTOUNDS SCIENTISTS! Makes Planfs
A feature article in the April ’57
issue of Popular Mechanics Maga-
line describes some of the truly
amazing properties of the new
“magic” chemical—Gibberellin.
Botanists have been unable to
determine the exact chemical
composition of this “miracle"
substance, but one thing is cer-
tain—”It will create a plant E
revolution.” ,
PHENOMENAL GROWTH ”éﬁéfrl/
v- \

Gibberellin has stimulated growth _ 1;,
beyond belief in virtually all plants

/

on which It has been tried. Look at :97; fgj§v//<
these examples: Geramums grow Into ” 4:. «j/ §~
giants! Rose bushes climb to more g/g. \

than three times thei~ normal height.
Asters, petunias, poinsettias, dwarf
dahlias are all increased in site by
the fantastic chemical. It causes
tomato plants to ﬂower and even
bear more tomatoes! Soybeans grow
100 percent in a single week. Celery
doubles its stalk and leaf growth.
Beans grow six to eight inches per
day! The growth of young trees may
double or triple in three weeks!
RESEARCH CONTINUES

Right now scientists and botanists
are working feverishly to find out
more about this amazing discovery.
It is known that an unbelievably
small amount of the chemical—a
dose as small as one millionth of a ' ’ I
gram—can cause a plant to grow to 1
four or five times its normal height.
less than an ounce would treat an
entire acre of vegetables. And it
works fast. lts effects have ben ob-
served within 10 hours of treatment!
Furthermore, it is nontoxic to plants
even at high dosages.

TEST IT YOURSELF

Apply it to young household plants
and watch the results. They will
amaze you. It's unbelievable! lts
strange growing power seems to affect
almost anything—plants, ﬂowers,
fruit, trees, etc.

INTRODUCTORY OFFER
Our special introductory price is

by JOSEPH C. SLOANE

the
Log

ONCE UPON A TIME LONG, LONG,
ago—or maybe it was just last
year—a family lived in a little two room
house some distance from the edge of a
forest. It was pretty lonely there because
it was a long way to the nearest village
and sometimes in the winter they could
hear wild animals howling in the distance.
They didn’t have very much to live on
either. In the summer and fall the father
cut, sawed, and split ﬁrewood to sell
down in the town. He peddled it from
door to door in an old truck, and though
the logs were always sound and well
seasoned, he didn’t receive a great deal
of money for them—usually just about
enough to get through the winter.

The man and his wife had a little girl
named Rose, of whom they were very
proud. She was a sweet child, bright,
cheerful, and quite content to spend most
of the day by herself, inventing all sorts
of games to play alone. Often she helped

28

  
 

”. . . he seemed unsteady on his legs.”

her mother around the house for that was
a sort of game too. All in all, they led a
happy life, even if there wasn’t very much
to buy groceries with, not to mention lux-
uries. Things were hard in other ways too,
for the little house wasn’t heated most
of the time except for the warmth from
the old stove in the kitchen. When the
snow came and it got really cold, they
would light a ﬁre evenings in the stone
ﬁreplace in the big room, but it was al-
ways chilly in the corners. The fire was
almost a treat in itself, for it burned the
precious wood the man cut to sell. What
they saved out for themselves in the fall
had to see them through the Winter, be-
cause once the snow came it was im-
possible to get to the forest to cut more.

One day in the late fall, the man came
home after selling the last of the season 5
stock of logs and kindling. He was
pleased, for he had had plenty of cus—
tomers willing to pay such a good price

MARCH 1958 YANKEE




 

that this time the house would be better
stocked than usual with food and warm
clothes for the cold months ahead. But as
he was putting the truck away in the
barn, he looked at the woodpile and his
face grew serious. Things had gone so
well that he had been tempted to sell a
little more of what he had cut than usual,
and now there would be barely enough
for the three of them. Looking up at the
sky, he saw the ﬁrst ﬂakes of snow al-
ready falling from a gray sky. By morn-
ing it would probably be too deep to get
to the woods to do any more sawing.
Winter had come—he could only hope it
would be a short one.

That evening during supper, an uncer-
tain knocking sounded at the door. They
all jumped because it was very seldom
that anyone came that way, especially after
dark. The woman opened the heavy door
to ﬁnd an old man standing there. It was
plain at once that he wasn’t well for his
eyes gleamed too brightly, there were
spots of pink in his pale cheeks, and he
seemed unsteady on his legs.

”Come in, man, come in! Warm up
by the ﬁre,” said the woman in a cheery
vorce.

But as the old fellow stepped inside,
his knees buckled and he fell heavily on
the ﬂoor. The man ran quickly to where
he lay, and stooping, felt the ﬂushed face
and uneven pulse. No doubt about it,
their visitor was sick indeed.

”We’ll have to get him to bed, wife,
and if the snow isn’t too deep yet, I’ll go
get the Doc from town to come look at
him.”

”Well, don’t just stand there, lend a
hand so we can get him under covers and
warmed up,” replied the woman, already
ﬁxing the blankets on an old cot ‘by the
wall. When they had made him as com-
fortable as they could manage, the man
climbed into his heavy coat and slapped
a fur cap on his head. ”I’ll be back as
soon as I can,” he said, and was gone
into the snow ouside.

Hours later he came back with the
doctor, but the going had been hard and
was getting worse. By morning they were
sure to (be snowed in. The doctor an-
nounced that the old man would re-

YANKEE MARCH 1958

cover, but it would be a while before he
could 'be moved so he guessed they would
have the stranger as a guest for a while.
In a week or two, if there was a thaw, he
could come into town. "I’ll give you this
medecine for him; it’ll bring him around
in time but you’ll have to keep him. good
and warm. If he gets another chill, it’ll
be the end of him. It’s so drafty in here
you’ll have to keep that ﬁre going steady.”
A moment later they heard the noise of
his car already muffled by the falling
snow.

The man looked steadily at his wife
and she at him, both thinking the same
thing, neither daring to put it into words.
Here they were with a sick old man
whose name they didn’t even know, and
strict instructions about a warm ﬁre day
and night. Their small stack of wood
out by the kitchen would never see them
through the winter now. Together they
walked over to look at their patient’s
tired old face already relaxed in sleep,
and suddenly realized that there was
something wonderful about him, but for
the life of them they couldn’t say what
it was. All they knew was that wood or
no wood, they would keep him until he
was well.

As the days passed he became steadily
better. He would give them no name
except Old Jim, and very little did he
tell them about who he was, what he
did, or where he came from. There had
been a shack, somewhere back in the
woods apparently, a tree that had fallen
and wrecked it in a storm, and ﬁnally a
decision to come into town to look for
work and a warm place to sleep. That
was about all. The fever had come on
him while he was on the way, and he
had barely been able to make it to the
lighted house he’d seen ahead in the
dark. But if he wouldn’t talk about him-
self, he kept little Rose delighted with
wonderful stories about animals and his
adventures in the north country, or else
he would Whittle dolls for her out of bits
of kindling. Always he was most grate-
ful for the care they took of him, but
each time he thanked them he would add
with a queer sort of half-smile, “I’m
blessed if I know how I c’n ever pay ye

back, me ‘bein’ so old and all.” And then
he would chuckle a little to himself and
add, ”But I got me a friend. Maybe she’ll
help some. Yep, guess she will, at that.”
Who the friend was, or how she would
help, he would never say. The family
were all puzzled for there was a strange
wonder about him somewhere, yet when
they tried to pin it down, he was just an
old, old, man with a twinkle in his eye
and hair as white as the snow outside.

At last, not too long before Christmas,
he remarked one clear day that he guessed
he was as good as new and would be
moving along. There had been a thaw the
night before, so the road was open, and
he announced that he’d head for town.
No, he wouldn’t let the man take him
there in the truck. ”Nothin’ wrong with
the legs now, nothin’ at all. Thanks all
th’ same, and bless you folks!” The three
of them stood by the door watching his
sturdy ﬁgure trudge down the road until

about to go in, he glanced at the wood-

there, and now there was prec1ous little

for the next day, a trip neither of them
thought could be made. Perhaps on his
old skis the man had a chance to get
through; he’d have to risk it.

But Rose, after the way of small
children, wasn’t worried at all. Her par-
ents "would think of something, some way
out of their troubles, just as they always
had before. So while they talked, she lay
on the floor near the ﬁre, her chin cupped
in her hands, watching the dancing
ﬂames. There was one in particular,
higher than the rest, that leaped and
flickered.along the birch log until it al-
most seemed alive. It ran from one end
to the other like a dancer, twirling and
bending in the most graceful way. The
more she looked, the more it took on
the shape of a tiny human being. It was“
a person, she ﬁnally decided, but how
could it 'be, right there in the ﬁre, and
only six or seven inches tall. Suddenly,

she seemed to hear a little voice, clear as ’

a bell of ice: ~

”You’re Rose aren’t you?”

Before she knew it, she was answering
in a sort of whisper, ”Yes. Yes I am.”

"And your father and mother are
worried about how to keep warm now
the wood is gone?”

“I guess they are. This is about all
that’s left, and the road to town is blocked
with snow.”

"Didn’t you have an old man here a
few weeks ago?”

”Oh my yes! He was just wonderful
—we were all so sorry when he left. But
I suppose we used too much wood keep-
ing him warm so he could get well.
Daddy sold most all he cut to the people
in the village this year so there was
hardly enough before he came.”

”It was good of your family to use
all that precious wood on a homeless old
man who didn’t have any way to pay
yo)u back. Aren’t you sorry now you did
it.”

uOh No! We loved him, and anyway,
you couldn’t let an old man like that get
sicker and sicker "because he’s cold.”

By this time the ﬁre was burning down
until the dancing ﬂame ﬁgure was only
half as big, and its voice had grown so
faint that Rose could hardly hear.

YANKEE MARCH 1958

”In the morning there’ll be a black log
at the wood pile. Bring it in and burn it.
You’ll be all right. Your mother can
cook in here. . . With the last word
the tiny voice trailed away to nothing.
The ends of the log in falling to-
gether sent up a shower of sparks. Some
time later when the man and his wife
came in, Rose was fast asleep in front of
the glowing coals.

The next morning was clear but a bitter
wind whirled up stinging clouds of dry
snow. To save the little wood that was
left, they had a cold breakfast of cheese
and crackers while the man made prep-
arations for his fearful trip. What if he
shouldn’t get there? The wife pushed the
thought ﬁrmly from her mind, but the
man’s grim face was proof enough of
what he was thinking. Suddenly Rose
clapped her hand to her mouth.

”Daddy! Mummy! I just remembered!
The funniest thing happened last night
while you were in the kitchen. I saw a
fairy!”——and the whole story of the little
ﬁgure in the ﬁre came tumbling out in a
rush of words.

”But Rose, dear, you were just dream-
ing. When we came in, you were fast
asleep.”

”We—ell,” doubtfully, “maybe I was,
but it sure seemed awful real.”

Just then the father said he was ready
to leave so there was no more talk about
ﬁre fairies. The woman and Rose put on
their coats to go out and help him on
with his skis. But once outside the skies
were forgotten.

”Look!” cried the woman, ”Look there
where the woodpile was!”

And sure enough, on the ground where
it had been lay a log, but such a log as
you never have seen. It was about three
feet long, a foot thick, and jet black—
bark, wood, and all. It wasn’t charred, it
was simply as 'black as night.

”See, Daddy!” cried Rose, "It was a
fairy! I didn’t dream it after all. It’s just
the way she said it would be. Let’s hurry
and bring it in!”

Puzzled, the man picked up the log,
surprised to ﬁnd that though it was ob-
viously solid it wasn’t at all heavy. The

ALARMED BY THE HAZARDS OF
speeding automobiles, in 1901
Connecticut acted. The world’s ﬁrst auto-
moble speed law was passed.

” 12 miles-per-hour within the
city limits and 15 miles-per-hour in coun-
try areas.”

Fifty-four years later Governor Abra-
ham A. Ri’bicoff moved to fulﬁll the
law’s aim—-—the saving of lives. By this
time Connecticut had upped its permis-
si'ble speed to 55 miles-per-hour, keeping
thickly populated neighborhoods, inter-
sections and school areas posted lower.

What Governor Ribicoﬂ' did and con-
tinues to do is considered revolutionary.
In Connecticut the speed law is en-
forced! The convicted violator receives
the maximum penalty, including sus-
pension of his license. A ﬁrst oﬂ‘ender
takes a compulsory 30-day rest from the
wheel, a second offender 'busses it or rides
with friends for 60 days, while the driver
with three speeding strikes on him walks
indeﬁnitely. After 90 days he can apply
to the State Motor Vehicle Department
which can refuse to reinstate the license,

32

issue a limited license, or restore ful-l road
privileges. Under Connecticut law license
suspension power is delegated to the
Motor Vehicle Department. .

The key to the entire program is the
”no ﬁx, no favors” policy of the courts.
Connecticut’s 67 guberna‘torially ap-
pointed municipal judges were told 'by
Governor Ri-bicoff that any "softening of
motor vehicle charges” would eliminate
them as reappointment candidates.

From across a massive desk in the state
capital 48-year-old Governor Ribicoff, his
jet black hair greying at the temples and
furrows entrenching permanent lines in
his forehead, explains the motivation be-
hind the campaign:

”Just “before Christmas, 1955, I de—
cided to try to save one life. If one per—
son, who otherwise might have been
killed on the highways, was spared, the
effort would *be worthwhile.” .

That year Connecticut counted 320 life-
taking accidents. State Police ComrmS-
sioner John C. Kelly was called to Gover-
nor Ri’bicoff’s second ﬂoor ofﬁce. The
career lawman was asked the cause Of

Above: This is what Connecticut is

the deaths. Noted for brevity, Commis-
sioner Kelly responded, “Speed.”

To cut speed and save lives the simple,
unique program was set in motion. His
understanding of human nature enabled
Governor Ribicoff to realize ”People will
not slow down to live, but will to save
their licenses.” Out-of-state motorists are
warned of Connecticut’s stern, tough
policy by large signs at state borders
which read:

Don’t Speed
Conviction Means

Loss of License

By the end of 1957, the second full
year of the drive, Connecticut boasted the
1 lowest average speed rate in years; had re-
ceived several national safety awards; and
claimed that fewer than three people
were killed every 100 million motor
vehicle miles. The remainder of the na-
tion showed six deaths over the same
course.

Paradoxically, while Governor Ribicoff
was ﬂagging down speeders, the law—
makers put a ”slow poke” regulation in
the books. It is now illegal to drive at

Speed,

Meriden Police Chief Michael B. Car-
roll said there would be no arrests in
his city. ”For years we have been telling
drivers to slow down—ethat speed kills. A
slow driver isn’t hurting anyone.”

Nevertheless, Governor Ri‘bilcoff con-
siders the legislation a step forward. ”A
slow poke can encourage accidents. The
law is consistent with our interest in
safety."

Connecticut was well equipped for
the campaign when Governor Ri‘bicoff
ﬂashed the red light on speeders. For
many years the State Police Department
has prided itself on advanced highway
safety thinking. For example, in 1946
Connecticut became the ﬁrst area in the
world to check automobile speed by radar.
After demonstrations in Glastonbury,
town court officials agreed the graph re-
cordings would be accepted as evidence.

Use of radar is not as widespread as
many believe. For the most part police
call upon electronic assistance when com-
plaints have been made. In one town a
few months back a leading ﬁgure clam-

President Eisenhower listens attentively as

Governor Rihicoﬁ discusses the Con-

necticut safety plan. Super highways present super problems in highway safety-

ored for a radar check of the main
thoroughfare. The ﬁrst to face the tell-
no-lies graph in court was Mr. Com-
plainant.

However, he was no less surprised than
the Wallingford man stopped on Route
US 5 last Memorial Day and charged
with reckless driving. State Police Cap-
tain William A. Gruber, hovering above
the well-used highway in a helicopter,
radioed information to cruisers below
which led to the arrest of the offender.

On practically every 3-day weekend
Captain Gruber takes to the air and co-
ordinates the ground eﬁ‘orts. Also mar-
shalled for duty during critical periods is
every available cruiser. Some used in
special investigative work are not readily

34

identiﬁable as police cars. The driver,
however, is always in full uniform.

Despite proof of its effectiveness, a020
per cent cut in deaths, and a nationwrde
Gallup poll showing 60 per cent of the
people favor it, the Connecticut plan has
not met full approval of neighbors. New
Jersey is the only state which reciprocates
100 per cent. Rhode Island suspends
licenses of its drivers convicted by a Con-
necticut court if the offense was ﬂagrant.
New York has studied the results but
refuses to join in partnership. .

Governor Ribicoff didn’t sugar coat his
words on this phase of highway safety
when talking to a conference of governors
in Chicago.

"When a driver is convicted and

For ignoring the posted speed limits,

penalized in one state, it should be up-
held in other states.”

Continuing, he said, "Reciprocity is
especially important between adjacent
states which serve as a bridge between
two or more other states. Americans are
a travelling people, and no one state can
consider itself aloof from the highway
problems of its neighbors and the coun‘
try. The automobile doesn’t heed a state

.line.”

With only token response from states
bordering Connecticut Governor Ribicoff
examines the problem and says, "We
can’t expect them to impose a penalty
greater than their own law for speeding
in Connecticut. A uniform motor vehicle
code is needed.”

YANKEE MARCH 1958

 

The failure of all New England to
support license suspension for speeding
in Connecticut is a mild rebuff compared
to early reactions from the Nutmeggers
themselves. The governor, a former Hart-
ford City Court judge, was accused of
tearing down the wall separating the'ex-
ecutive and judicial branches of govern-
ment, suspended drivers threatened re—
prisal, and others pleaded hardship. All
learned there are no exceptions. ‘

Among the ﬁrst to realize the sus-
pension edict was all inclusive was a
union official. Shortly after the campaign
started he obtained an appointment with
Governor Ribicoff. "This doesn’t mean
us,” he said in obvious reference to the
most controversial subject in Connecticut.

The usually imperturbable governor
snapped back, ”It does mean you.”

A gubernatorial appointee, Rocco D.
Pallotti, might still be Deputy Motor
Vehicle Commissioner if he had walked
across Lafayette Square from the State
Ofﬁce Building and checked out the gov-
ernor’s intentions personally. Pallotti re-
turned the license of a twice-convicted
drunken driver. Governor Ribicoff
learned of the action and called for
Pallotti to resign. Pallotti was reluctant.
The governor pressed. Within a week
a career motor vehicle department worker
was in the deputy’s ofﬁce.

No one can explain Governor Ri‘bi-
coff’s sensitivity to speed. He has not lost
a relative or intimate friend in an auto-
mobile accident. Nor has he been an eye
witness to death by car. His only ex-
planation is, ”I decided to try to save
a life. Whose? I don’t know.”

With summer approaching and Con-
necticut attracting more vacationers than
ever before, the relentless march against
speed continues. This is the ﬁrst year the
129-mile $464 million Connecticut Turn-
pike from the New York state line to the
Rhode Island border will 'be available. No
estimate has been made as to whether the
super stretch will increase or decrease the
rate of highway deaths. But 100 new
State Police troopers will be guardians of
the lanes as Connecticut continues its own
disarmament program and outlaws the
deadliest of weapons—highway speed.

Cunningham conﬁded: "I’m going to give you the damnedest time you ever saw.”

IT WAS 9:30 P.M., OCT. 31, 1896. A
national election, after a bitterly-
fought campaign, was only two days
awa .

In New Bedford, Massachusetts, the
MCKinley Republicans stomped vigorous-
ly through the streets. Plenty of trom-
bones and drums in a "gold parade” ac-
companied them. Crowds of supporters
gathered at the parade’s end to hear the
ﬁnal speeches.

A block or two away, up at the head
of Cofﬁn Street, Patrick Cunningham, na-
tive of Dundalk, County Lough, Ireland,
an inventor of naval torpedoes and a
Bryan Democrat, decided his party also
should have a celebration. 7

Mr. Cunningham conﬁded to a neigh-
bor, Manuel de Sousa, “I am going to
give you ”the damnedest time you ever
saw.” So saying, Mr. Cunningham point-
ed meaningly to a section of one of the
naval torpedoes lying nearby. This had
been pronounced by an examining board
of the United States Navy as among the
most ”frightful destroyers” ever brought
to its attention.

Mr. de Sousa remonstrated; he plead-
ed, but to no avail. The inventor sat down
on the torpedo. It lay in the middle in
the street, pointing downhill. Here it was
that he and an accomplice had succeeded
in unloading it from a wagon. Keeping
his seat on the missile, Mr. Cunningham
tried to ignite its powder with a ﬂaming
newspaper. The paper ﬂared, subsided
and twisted into charred blackness. Mr.
de Sousa started oﬂ‘ on the dead run,

36

down the hill. He shouted a warning to

the general public as he ran. It was now

too late for remonstrating.

Still ﬁred with enthusiasm, Mr. Cun-
ningham ﬁlled the opening of the tor-
pedo with niter. This he succeededun
igniting, and there he sat, momentarily,
upon an explosive naval experts .had. de-
cided would ”blow up a warship, if it
but touches it.” At about this time, the
inventor’s little boy succeeded in pulling
him off the projectile. Then it started
down South Second Street. .

Within three minutes from the time
the inventor had made his remark to Mr.
de Sousa, the massive steel tube, 8 inches
in diameter and 4 feet in length, weigh-
ing 250 pounds (125 of which was high-
pressure, slow-burning powder) was. on
its way down the street. Hissing, tearing, ’

plunging and scattering ﬁre and smoke
in its wake, it followed Mr. de Sousa
who was still trying to warn the populace
of its coming.

First, the swishing land-borne torpedo
met two carriages, driven respectively by
Frank Costa and Walter Hunt. It passed
so close that it scorched the wheels of one
of them, and frightened both horses into
sundry circus acts of considerable Violence
and variety. Both drivers jumped to the
ground to hold their dancing horses and
restore order.

Shortly thereafter, the torpedo struck a
stump in front of B. S. Silvester’s store;
it exploded. The thunderous report was
heard all over the city and across the river
in Fairhaven, a mile away. The front of
the store was, in an instant, a mass of
slivered glass. There was not an unbroken

pane left in the building. Mrs. Silvester,
sitting upstairs in a front room, was
blown across the room and so terrorized
that she took refuge in an ice chest at
the back of the house.

Every pane of glass in Wallace C.
Hull’s house across the street and in Asa
Bowman’s, next north, was smashed, and
powder and mud peppered both houses
like shot, with small black holes. The
home of Mrs. Florence C. Allen, next
north of Silves'ter’s store, also fared
badly.

Mr. Hull’s wife was away; he was tak-
ing care of their two children. They were
asleep in an attic room, but he had
stepped out to do an errand. A piece of
' powder came hurtling

curtains and window casings, and the
blaze was soon going merrily. Some
thoughtful watcher spread the alarm, and
the ﬁre bells rang sonorously for Box 39.
Neighbors broke into the house, rescued
the children before their parents had a
chance to return, and succeeded in stomp-
ing out the ﬁre before the Fire Depart-
ment even had time to wet a hose.

Mr. de Sousa’s escape was miraculous.
He had barely started to run when the
blast occurred; he was hurled violently
against a building. A ﬂying fragment of
torpedo whistled through his mustache.
It left less than half of it. When calmer,
he remarked, “I do not mind losing the
mustache. I'do not, however, relish being
shaved that way.”

that some day he would happen upon one.
Whapperknocker watching was not the
only unique diversion of our childhood.
Being the offspring of a historian sub

isn’t long enough for forgetting.

Loving mother truly, father was
simultaneously in love with a regional

affection was always a reality—but the
inspiration was, alas, a delusion on
father’s part at that time. His preoccupa-
tion with the past made something of a
present problem for his nearest & dearest
—-like ﬁnding the current water 'bill in
the happy phan‘tasmagoria of his desk or
being drafted as his reluctant research
assistants.

Father was a kind of unwitting King
Canute. The tides of family life always
seemed to stop at the study door and
when he came out, the sailing would
be smooth. True wifely understanding
helped Mother keep her exasperation
from showing when Father holed up in
that cluttered study of his. He disported
himself amid the musty memorabilia he

loved—old books, diaries, newspapers;
arrowheads and a tomahawk; faded pho-
tographs and prints—.and over all these,
the vagrant reminders he wrote to him—
self that eventually made the cubicle look
like a Lindbergh welcome.

This went on for twenty years—but
there was an interval when Fate gave us
respite. Father was postmaster for a while
and we were able to dump our problem
on the postal inspectors. They also gave
up trying to keep father’s desk tidy and
they too eventually left him alone, hum-

ming and lark-happy, in his wonderful

paper world. After he brought his records
back home when the Democrats came
back to the White House, we were
amazed how the ﬁles had multiplied.

built in 1750, is lo-

Thomas Hawley, the

C hurch and also the
ﬁrst Town Clerk

Being loving pater-‘familias besides
historian, father never thought of putting
a do-not-disturb sign on the door and he
never acted like a Genius at Work. Rather
he seemed to enjoy having his half dozen
children burst in on him and, after pok-
ing around till he found the bag of
candy, he would resume his work, ob-
livious of our presence. He had no anxiety
about our disarranging his papers. He
had taken the precaution of doing that
himself.

Now and then Father had to come out
to accumulate some more material for his
book. Perhaps he needed to track down
the date of Zerrubabel Hoyt’s death or
what regiment

been in during the Civil War. Because
Father didn’t want to go on his research

he cemetery visits were the most em-
barassing. How we were observed over
stone fences by quizzical farmers and
their mild cows in every God’s acre 111

noticed the effect he was creating but as
we grew old enough, we suspected that
the farmers and maybe the cows too, were
i‘mputing a mild and happy lunacy to 0111‘

Father was overjoyed when he found

a forgotten burial ground that no one
else knew its location. He preferred
one where the stones had crumbled and
weeds had assumed dominion over once
breathing Elijah Laurence, who’d died at
95, and little Delight Abbot, who had
passed away of the fever at 2. Their

bones had been undisturbed for a long,

time until Father came in with his rol-
licking retinue and the gentle melancholy
of the place didn’t wield its customary
sedative inﬂuence over us at all.

In the course of the cemetery visits,
someone always met a misadventure or
two. Father was undeterred 'by the risk
he ran with poison ivy despite the fact
that the mere mention of it always started
him scratching. Susan would always begin
weeping and sneezing the moment she
was in proximity to ragweed. The rest
of us spelled one another getting into
trouble with yellow jackets, thistle and
nettle, and once my small brother pulled
a tombstone over on his toe. Occasionally
there were delayed reactions in the form
of nightmares set in motion by ribbony
blacksnakes.

When we reached home from the
tombtones, Mother would have fore-
sightedly taken a nap to condition her
for coping.

The only vagary of Father’s I ever
heard her wet-blanketing was his sug-
gestion that the whole family reenact the
original settlers ﬁrst night in town by
camping out under Settlers’ Rock too.

Mother didn’t go for this idea as it in-
volved diapering the baby by campﬁre in
the wintry winds of late November.

”If there’s tenting tonight,” she stated,
”you can do it for the rest of us, George.”

Every national holiday except the Feb-
ruary ones when New England «children
always have croup or some similar sea-
sonal indisposition, Father was wont to
commemorate the day appropriately by
taking us on a Visit to the local historic
spots.

First on the itinerary was the Cannon-
‘ball House. There in an oak corner post,
you can still see a cannon-ball ﬁred during
the above mentioned glorious battle of
Ridgeﬁeld. Father would lift us up, one
by one, to look at it. It was fascinating
to see the ﬁrst time. But when you’ve seen
one Cannonball House, you’ve seen them
all, and we saw ours whenever the urge
seized Father.

Next he would take us to pay our reluc-
tant respects to the spot where General
Wooster had fallen. Fortunately the gen-
eral had uttered a deathless and quotable
declamation a la John Paul Jones and
Stephen Decatur which Father used as his
rallying cry too: ”Come on, boys, never
mind such random shots!”

At the grave Father would always look
grieved that the Philistine selectmen per-
mited the weeds to grow over this hal-
lowed place. By the time we were home,
he would have worked up a full head of
steam. He would take steps. I do not

think the selectmen minded random shots
either. The weeds would be there next
tri .

' lilot as often as Father wanted to, we
included a visit to Sara Bishop’s cave.
Sara had picked the highest spot in town
for her hideaway and at least two of the
smaller children would always whine to
be carried up the last stretch of rocky
slope. The older we grew, the more
Sara’s story delighted us with its delicious
theme of faithless love, seduction and
insanity. It was the more appreciated as
we became acquainted with the facts of
life. Father had a standing offer of $1
for any of us who memorized the poem
about Sara that had been published in

”Next loe would ta/ae

spects to the spot

the Hartford Mirror in 1823. I can re-
member it today.

”For many a year the mountain hag

Was a theme of village wonder

For she made her home on the dizzy crag

Where the eagle bore its plunder. . . .

As alone on the cliff she musingly sate

The fox at her ﬁngers would snap

The crow would sit in her snow white
ate

And the rattlesnake coil in her lap.

No ﬁre illumined her dismal den

Yet a tattered Bible she read

For she saw in the dark with a wizard ken

And she slept without bed on her rock.

And often she muttered a foreign name

 

MARCH 1958 YANKEE




”Fat/oer bad a standing offer of $1 for any
of us who memorized the poem about Sara.”

With curses too fearful to tell

And a tale of horror, of madness and
shame,

She told to the walls of her cell.”

Some of us memorized the poem several
times. Father’s ‘ﬁling system on his chil-
dren was vague.

Father usually wound up the pilgrim-
age with a swing around the path the
French troops had taken as they passed
through Ridgeﬁeld on the way to York-
town. Then we would ge-t on home with
but one more st-op———for ice cream cones
at Bissell’s.

Father would deliver us back to mother
and for several days we would be her
preoccupation exclusively while Father
was assi-milating the recurring stimula-
tion of his late-st excursion into the past.

All of us were glad that these periods
of retirement were for a better reason
than secret drinking but Mother, gallant
helpmate, still appeared to wish father
would come out and dicker with the man
who’d come to buy Bessie’s twin calves,
for instance.

I had been away from home, at college,
for two years, when Mother wrote the
enchanting news that Father had ac-
quired a wealthy patron willing to under-
write the publication of the book. Mother
added that I wouldn’t believe it ‘but
Father was actually getting down to pre-
paring the manuscript for the printer with
efﬁciency and dispatch.

”But,” she added, ”do not be alarmed.
He hasn’t cleaned up his desk, dear.”

A year or so later, a package arrived
at the dormitory and 10! it was Father’s
book! In its 583 pages there were no
more than twenty or so sentimental pas-
sages about, dear old Ridgeﬁeld. Other-
wise ‘it read ﬁne and weighed three
pounds two ounces.

_ To paraphrase an antique verse ”father
lives on and on in the book he writ”—
aS does the memory his children cherish
athe memory of a father who elected to
share his work and his dreams with them.

to Spray

 

or not to Spray?

T IS DIFFICULT NOT TO VIEW WITH

alarm the rising tide of insecticides.

This will soon ﬂood many if not most of
our forty-eight states.

For example, the National Audubon
Society points out (N. Y. Herald Tribune
———Dee. 25, 1957) that Uncle Sam has
begun dusting twenty to thirty million
acres in nine states with dieldrin "one
of the most deadly of modern insecti-
cides.” The dosage in this case is to be
two pounds per acre—enough to kill 40
million quail chicks besides the ﬁre ants
the government is after. John H. Baker,
President of the Society, calls this sort of
spraying "ranking in seriousness with the
effects of radioactive fall out.” Such a
View, according to the New York Times
of January 12, 1958 is similarly held by
three prominent Harvard scientists.

In reply, Ezra Taft Benson, Secretary
of Agriculture, held, also on January
12th, that his Department, through liaison
with various conservation groups, was
closely in touch with the situation.

Again, last Fall we remember receiv-
ing an advertisement of a chemical which
we were told to use for the removal of
dangerous insecticides from our apples,
oranges, etc. because, mind you, ordinary
water would not do this. The ad is gone
nowebut we wish we had it back for
here is an item from Rochester, New
York, which tells that spraying in the
New York fruit belt area actually has al-
ready produced among farm workers
numerous ”pre - cancerous” conditions.
This reference comes from well qualiﬁed

46

Dr. George Moore of the Roswell Memo-
rial Park Institute of Buffalo.

To go back a bit, facts gathered by
A. J. Dillon of Hancock, New Hamp-
shire, from the Rnrnl New Yorker and
the [onrnnl of Applied an‘rizfz'on, reveal
that ﬁfty USDA planes sprayed with these
consequences 24 counties of New York,
New Jersey and Pennsylvania in the
Spring of 1947.

1. Disappearance of almost all birds,
butterﬂies, bees, etc.

2. Death of large numbers of trout
and other game ﬁsh.

3. Contaminated milk from cows who
ate the DDT on the grasses.
4. Rotting of trees, ﬂowers, and shrubs.

Aerial DDT spraying on Long Island
——said the New York Tz'rner of May 23,
1957—resulted in court action by local
residents. The legal objections raised were
a) that DDT spraying is potentially
harmful to birds, wildlife, animals and
humans; b) that Uncle Sam has no right
to spread this poison over privatecprop-
erty without the expressed permrssron of
private landowners. Similar law cases are
apparently arising elsewhere.

A letter to the editor in the Corral
County Independent of Center 0551p66,
New Hampshire—an editor we happen to
know is not often taken for any sort of
ride—summarizes some other effects of
this spraying program:

Dr. DeWitt, chemist for the U. 8.

Wildlife Service, states that although

quail and pheasant will and do resist

MARCH 1958 YANKEE

 




 

DDT, 90% of their offspring are born

crippled and die.

Vernon Bostick in Nature Magazine
states that with the destruction in 1956
of the insects the ﬁsh fed upon in
Carlson National Forest, trout ﬁshing
was virtually destroyed too.

The Presticide Laboratory at Cornell
contends DDT spray residues on vege-
tables are a real threat to human
health.

Dr. Norton Bisking, noted toxicolo-
gist (American [ournal of Digestive Dir-
earer) and Dr. William Coda Martin
(American Academy of Nutrition) both
hold that their investigations of the food
crops sprayed commercially with DDT,
lead arsenate, methyl bromide, chlordate,
lindane, texaphene, and other chlorinated
hydrocarbons—especially with an oil base
—can result in great cumulative toxic
harm to humans.

In the face of the foregoing, it would
not seem likely that in 1954 both Gov-
ernor Herter and Arthur T. Lyman, the
latter Commissioner of the Massachusetts
Department of Natural Resources, pressed
for the legislation (subsequently granted)
for DDT spraying in various Massachu-
setts areas. Yet they did. Further, Law-
rence K. Miller, publisher of the Berk-
r/aire Eagle and noted conservationist, re-
ports, even as this is being written, no
apparent harm to anything except the
gypsy moths resulted from this vast spray—
ing program in the Berkshires.

A check with the Editor, Alfred M.

Williams, of Forest and Park News, oﬂi-
cial organ of the Massachusetts Forest
and Park Association, whose Board of
Ofﬁcers and Directors could hardly be
more distinguished or capable, reveals
that his ofﬁce is aware, from many in-
quiries made to it, of the controversial
nature of the spraying subject.
. He told us that the spraying program
in Massachusetts has eliminated, with the
exception of a few thousand acres around
Qua-bbin reservoir, the gypsy moth.

In his opinion, although a DDT build-
up in the soil would undoubtedly poison
cows and eventually humans, the fact that
the spray program is largely conﬁned to
trees, eliminated any real worry on this

YANKEE MARCH 1958

score. (Remember he is talking about
the gypsy moth—not vegetable spraying
——now.)

Further, the *bees will survive what a
gypsy moth, tent or wooly caterpillar, in
the way of DDT, won’t.

The amount of DDT in the spray used
in Massachusetts (7 oz. per acre) will not
kill birds but will cause them to migrate
from a sprayed area. This is because their
insect food is gone. However, eventually
the insects will grow again and the birds
will return.

Finally, he admitted (but not on the
defensive of course) that game ﬁsh in
small or stagnant ponds would be hard
hit. This probably would not be true,
he added, in running brooks.

So where are we at? Probably on the
general battleﬁeld where there has been
fought a war for some time now between
the health food and organic gardening
side against insecticides of all kinds, com-
mercial fertilizers, and especially modern
food preservatives. If we side with them
——and there are many admirable reasons
for so doing—we are against mass spray-
ing or any other kind of insecticide use.

If, on the other hand we side with
those who hold that gypsy ’moth eradica-
tion is, even as H Bomb testing, well
worth the risk of imperilling the lives of
ourselves, our children, animals, birds,
and livestock, we will disagree that spray-
ing, or other insecticide usage, is unde-
sirable.

Philosophically, this article does not
intend to straddle this issue. Put us down
as saying that whatever is harmful to
wildlife, animals, and humans, we are
against. To us, no matter what the big-
wigs say or think, the health and well
being of one little child is worth all the
insects this world has yet devised. Let
us abolish (even from our thinking) ways
and means of killing—for that is what
essentially H Bombs and insecticides are
for—-and devote our God given existence
to improving and strengthening life and
living things. After all, insects eventually
eat each other—and new trees grow up
in place of old—and the intent of the
Lord, unless one is mad, remains clearly
seen as life—not death.

s EARLY AS THE 1760’s, BRITAIN’S
periodical Dodyley’i Register, re-

A

corded that “a method of making sugar
and molasses from the sap of a certain
tree called the Maple, common in the
New England colonies, has just been dis-
covered and put into practice at several
portions of New England, but especially

at Bernardston, twenty miles from
Athol.” And according to the Lieutenant-
Governor Cushtman papers, English peri-
odicals added further to Bernardston’s
maple sugaring reputation when, in a
rare anecodote, Samuel Cunnabell, a Yan-
kee pioneer of the town, was credited
with the enigmatic distinction of ”gather-

ing sap in a basket and boiling it in a
tub!”

The earliest reference to New England
sugar-making goes as far back as 1609
when Marc Lescarbot, historian in the
Lake Champlain area, wrote: ”The In-
dians get juice from the trees and from
it distil a sweet and agreeable liquid.”

Indian catch buckets were actually
made from large pieces of birch bark,
folded and then stitched with basswood
ﬁbres. The seams were made ”sap tight”
with pine resin. Sap from these con-
tainers was poured into large hollowed
out tree trunks in which the liquid was
boiled and made into syrup or sugar by
adding an Endless succession of red hot
stones.

Before 1765, the Yankees had been
slow to imitate the Indians in sugar-
making. It wasn’t till toward the Close of
the French and Indian wars that Reverend
Samuel Hopkins of Springﬁeld, With an
eye to the future, perhaps, suggested that
”it would beprudent for colonial farmers
to spare their maple trees, and utilize
them in supplying themselves with their
own sugar and molasses.”

Previous to this time, the white settlers
who had ventured to make maple sugar,
had employed odd methods. One man cut
small branches from his maples, then tied
bottles 'to the dripping ends of the tw1gs
and waited for the sun to distil the sap as
it ﬂowed lfltO‘ the translucent containers!
Another pioneer bored little gimlet holes
in his trees and inserted goose quills 'to
draw off the liquid from sap reserVOirs

ground, in the style of the Indians.

It was not until late in the 18th cen-
tury that the hanging bucket was in-
vented and eight inch spigots of elder and
sumac put into use.

In the case of Samuel Cunnabell,
pioneer sugar-maker in the Bernardston
area, he combined Indian sugaring meth-
ods with early Yankee methods and, at a
great moment in history, added a brand
new sugaring element all his own.

Sam Cunnabell was an inventive man,
and after he and his neighbor frontiers-
men had chased the last Indian beyond
the northern horizen, (and the ﬁrst crow
had appeared) he got to work on his
sugaring “with a basket and a tub.”

Lieutenant-Governor Cushman explains
how Sam Cunnabell rigged up his "boil-
ing tub."

”Like most pioneers of his day,” Cush-
man recounts, "Samuel Cunnabell owned
a large potash kettle, conical in shape,
but shallow. His ingenuity suggested that
greater depth might be acquired by put-
ting a tub atop his kettle, so procuring a
set tub with ”ears” to it through which
a handle could be inserted, 'he removed

the bottom, placed the tub within the
kettle and ﬁrmly packed the two together.
When this combination was suspended
from an improvised crane of crotched
sticks, over an open ﬁre, he was ready, in
reality to boil sap in a tub.”

Though Sam Cunnabell’s old sugar
trees are gone, his house, now in the
process of restoration, still stands on a
knoll near an ofﬁcial historic marker
commemorating the site of his fort. ‘

Near this historic spot, on warm March
days, the sweet, steamy odor of boiling
sap today rises from the neighboring
woodlands where modern sugar houses
with complex evaporators and trim tin
buckets emphasize the far cry from the
days of Sam Cunnabell’s sugaring meth-
ods ”with a basket and a tub.”

But the Cunnabell tradition of inven-
tiveness still lingers in the neighborhood.
Near the old homestead, a 20th century
Yankee is tinkering on a sugaring inven-
tion which he declares today «might rev-
olutionize the industry. He’s not telling
yet just how the thing will work, but
some day he says it may “eliminate gather-
ing and boiling altogether.”

A FAT CONCH SHELL, A SCALLOP,
and a bony starﬁsh, a sprinkling of
cranberries with leaves, all screen-printed
in a cool old blue down the middle of a
wide wavy stripe of white. The drapes in
our Cambridge, Massachusetts living room
make all our guests dream of the sea. If
they know Cape Cod, they think of the
Cape.

T'he drapery (material is produced by
a busy Cape Cod housewife.

Lois Grant Palches, a poet who for
four years headed the Society of Cape Cod
Craftsmen, was sure there would be a
market for fabrics designed by Cape Cod
talent.

She nourished the idea for a while. In
1955 she made a short trip to New York
to talk to manufacturers and jobbers.
The designs she took with her had been
submitted by two of the Cape Cod
Craftsmen: Flora Mears of Harwichport
custom-makes place mats and curtains;
Barbara Malicoat of Provincetown works
in various media—she has sold creations
ranging from hand-blocked skirts to com-
memorative plaques.

The New York businessmen that Mrs.
Palches talked to liked her designs and
approved of her idea. But they were 0r-
ganized on too complex a scale. To do
business with anyone she talked to she
would have to make an initial investment
in ten thousand yards of cloth. She want-
ed a smaller operation that she could
control herself. Moreover the retail prices
suggested were far more than those she
had in mind. She had set 'her heart on a
quality fabric that could be sold at a
moderate price. Without trying to peddle
her idea further she went home.

When a Yankee has led a plan this far
she hates to drop it. It continued to hum
In her mind. Early in 1956 she decided
to take the jump. She would be her own
converter and her own saleslady. By sell-
mg only to decorators and small shops
she could keep the whole operation well
within reach.

The Davis Screen Printing Company in
neighboring Fall River was glad to make
arrangements with her. She had silk
screens made of her block print designs;
ordered material from the ]. Stevens Co.

from which chino pants are made; sat

ferent combinations of color for her ﬁrst
samples.

After she had the expensive screens
made she discovered "that it was customary
to shop for material ﬁrst. The material
determines the size of the screens and
not the other way around. This was not a
fatal mistake. She was more taken aback
when her ﬁrst real order, a very large one
turned out to have been based on a nu-
merical misunderstanding. Her most con-
tinuous problem came from ., the weight
and size of the heavy rolls. Transporting
them in her own car, ﬁnding storage space
at home, lifting them around to cut sam-
ples and ordered lengths, was heavy
manual labor.

But encouragement was at hand. Every-
one who saw the materials liked them.
Decorators and custom drapery shops
from New Hampshire to Washington,
D. C, exclaimed over the fresh designs
and bought samples. Real orders started
coming in.

Not all the Cape Cod Fabrics have
local motifs like Flora Mears’ popular
Seashells. Barbara Malicoat’s Sculpture,
for instance, is a classic design built
around a stylized fawn looking disdain-
fully over its shoulder. Very soon after she

had sent out her ﬁrst samples, a drapery
store telephoned to report that one cus-
tomer, impressed by the wonderful wash-
ability of the fabric, had ordered a couple
of extra yards of the fawn for a skirt.

By now the materials have been made
into slip covers, bathing suits, beach
jackets, hostess aprons, handbags, bed-
spreads, tablecloths, an-d place mats. They
have found their way into houses as far
away as Florida. The conductor of a sym-
phony orchestra has Cape Cod draperies
in his New York home. Gold on yellow
Seashells lent charm to the cabin of a
cruising sloop featured in the 1957 New

And Mrs. Palches, on her way home to
ﬁll a new order, or to look over new
designs, can look up to see the brilliant
colors of Cape Cod Berries, ﬂapping in
full sun as they have for over a year now,
in a neighbor’s kitchen window.

SMALL BUSINESS
and CRAFTS

by DAMON RIPLEY

N NANTUCKET ISLAND, HALF THE

world away from his native Philip-
pines, Jose Formoso Reyes weaves baskets
which are sought after for very good rea-
sons. They are unique replicas of the old
"lightship" baskets made by sailors over a
hundred years ago to while away tedium
on the shoal waters off Cape Cod. Lady
visitors to this famous summer resort lit-
erally clamor for Jose’s handiwork, which
they use, and cherish, as handbags. Orna-
mented with delicate whalebone carvings,
these oak and rattan baskets are construct-
ed to last a lifetime. They have never been
mass-produced, and not one has been made
outside the Nantucket area since the ﬁrst
were woven in 1928.

Jose Reyes, former teacher of languages
and sociology, weaves his baskets on the
original molds hand-turned by lightship
crews. Years ago when a critical govern-
ment ofﬁcial forbade the pastime, the sail-

MARCH 1958 YANKEE

   

  

 




 

 

 
   
        

Jose Reyes in his shop on Nantucket.

ors surrendered their molds to Nantucket
friends, who took up the craft. Trade was
brisk with summer folk until gradually
the old weaving hands passed‘ on. The
wooden blocks gathered dust in island at-
tics until 1947. when Jose landed on Nan-
tucket.

With a B. A. degree from Oregon’s
Reed College, a Master's from Harvard,
and nine years’ experience as a professor
in the University of the Philippines, Jose
searched for a teaching job. But the avail-
able posts offered too little salary to carry
out his ambitious plans for his three chil-
dren. He took on odd-jobs that Summer
with an eye ever alert to Opportunity. He
saw it, unexpectedly, in a display of light-
ship basket-weaving in a Nantucket mu-
seum, and he recalled the weaving skill
his father had taught him as a child. Why
not revive the ”lightship” craft and make
some money, too? Soon he had begged,
borrowed or bought enough of the forgot-
ten molds to set up shop.

Why does this educated man of 54
choose to sit in a tiny, woodchip-strewn
Shop and weave all day and half the night
When he might otherwise teach? He would
rather be in a classroom than anywhere
else. But it happens that Jose gets from
$16 to $250 each for his baskets. It also
happens that he has had to see his daugh-
ter, Francina, through her nursing course
at Boston’s Deaconness Hospital. _Two sons
must be ﬁnanced during their studies at
Williams College and M. I. T.

”My wife and I ﬁgured it out,” Jose
Says philosophically. "I’m working now
fpr the kids. When they’re on their own,
1“? 80mg to teach again—~and it's not
80mg to be basket-weaving!”

>Who wants to be a Sherlock Holmes? Over
the past ﬁve months YANKEE has received
three inquiries, the answer to which we can-
not give. The query is: ”I have heard of a
house in Connecticut that has a large mantel
piece with a fence around it. Do you know
where it is?” It seems that during the Winter,
baby lambs were brought into the farmhouse
to thaw out and were placed on the mantel
to get the heat from the ﬁre. The fence
evidently kept the chilly youngsters from fall-
ing. Talk about Yankee ingenuity! Evidently
there is such a farmhouse, with such a mantel,
with such a fence. But Where? Anybody know?
If so, please let me know and I’ll print the
answer as soon as possible.

The Log"

(Continued from page 31)

whole business was very queer, he
thought, for he knew there had only been
a few sticks left the night before and they
were still where he had last seen them.
Certainly no such log had been there
then. And what kind of wood was it?
Nothing he’d ever seen ”the likes of, he
was sure of that much.

”Hurry up, Daddy! Bring it in and
let’s start a ﬁre!” Rose was dancing up
and down with excitement.

”But what good is one log?” said the-
wife. “Afterwards we’ll be as bad off as
ever, even if it does burn, which doesn’t
seem likely to me. Who ever heard of
wood that color?”

”But Mummy, the fairy said we’d be
all right. She even said you could cook
over it. Let’s try it. Can’t we please?”

“Well, I’ve no objection, but it’ll be
just as far to town tomorrow—and we’ll
be colder than ever.” But inside they all
went, taking the strange log with them.

A few pieces of precious kindling and
some chips were quickly arranged with
the black wood on top. Almost as soon
as the ﬁrst slivers were alight, the ﬂame
licked up around the smooth bark and
in an instant the whole piece was burning
with tiny flames of every color in the
rainbow—violet, green, blue, orange——
and inside each one were little bright
sparkles of pure white light. Presently the
room was ﬁlled with a soft, even warmth

that spread into every corner, even to

the kitchen, though the stove had nOt
been started at all that day. In growing
amazement the whole family watched,
and as the heat spread they slowly took
off their hats and coats as if they were
in some kind of a dream.

“Well,” the woman said ﬁnally,” it’s

wonderful while it lasts. I’d better get
something hot ready for lunch before it
burns out.” '

But by lunch time it was still burning
as evenly as before without the slightest
sign of ashes or charring. All afternoon
it went, and through the evening too, still
sending up sparkling tongues of many-
colored ﬁre. Over and over the man and
his wife questioned Rose about what had
happened, but there was nothing she
could add to the story. She had seen and
talked to what she said was a fairy, and
that was all there was ‘to it. Only old
folks, she said, didn’t believe in fairies
and their promises.

The next morning the wonderful log
was still giving off the warmth, and the
next, and the next, and still not an ash
fell. At last they accepted it, a steady
comfort, until at last one day it was
spring. The snow melted, the breeze grew
warm, the leaves budded out, and the
man went into town to look for work.
When he got there, his ﬁrst questions
were about the old man. What had hap-
pened to him? Where was he now? But
no one had seen an old man. They all
. remembered the December thaw, but no

stranger had come in from the country,
of that they were certain. A search along
the road showed not a trace of any kind,
nor was he ever heard of anywhere in
those parts.

But one day in the late spring of that
year when they found the wonderful log,
the woman looked in the ﬁreplace ex-
pecting to see its colored ﬂames dancing
as usual. Nothing remained but a pile
Of ashes as white as snow. Glinting
among them was something that looked
like a ﬂash of red ﬁre. The woman took
the tongs and lifted it out on the hearth.
There lay a stone, red as ‘blood, shaped
perfectly in the form of a heart.

Over the Horizon

by JEAN BURDEN

YANKEE, a regional New England magazine, likes to realize there are
other places and ideas. Here, our West Coast and Poetry Editor bringsto
you news and ideas she thinks may interest you not only pertaining to our
region but in contrast to it. Reader ideas and letters are most welcome.

 

 

 

 

I LIKE TO THINK THAT SOME OF YOU READERS HAVE BEEN WONDERING WHERE
on earth I’ve been for the past two months. No, I haven’t had the croup. I didn’t
take a trip to Somaliland; I have not been working out a speeding ticket at the local

work farm.
I’ve been whittling on this column!

The editorial ”we” decided we had talked about the West Coast exclusively for a
year, and it might be fun to cast our nets into wider seas. Yankees are living and
working all over the globe, and it should be interesting to take a good look at them.
The other day, for instance, I was having my Ford repaired» at the local garage. The
nice looking mechanic, lying on his 'back under the dashboard ﬁxing the ignition
switch, was chatting about cars in general when I noticed a familiar slur. He hadn’t
said ”car” and "park” more than twice when I asked politely, ”And how long have
you been out of Boston?” He gave me an upside-down grin, and replied, "Just a yeah

and a hoﬁ’!”

TWO CONNECTICUT
YANKEES A LONG WAY
FROM HOME

How would you like to have your
husband stroll back into the living room
from a long distance telephone call and
casually ask, "Want to go to Form'osaP”?
Just like that. Ruth Brundage, h0wever,
was undaunted. ”Sure,” she said, without
dropping a stitch. ”Where is it?”

And that’s how two of YANKEE’S orig-
inal subscribers were uprooted from com-
fortable retirement and pressed into valu-
able service with the International Co-
operation Administration half way
around the world from their Connecticut
farm.

In March 1952, two months after the
momentous telephone call, they were
looking down from an upstairs balcony
adjoining their bedroom into the court-
yard of a Buddhist Temple in Taipei.
Bells were ringing above the deep chant
of male voices, and joss sticks and ex-

70

ploding ﬁrecrackers were making the
air as smokey and pungent as Fourth of
July. Ruth took a deep breath and
grinned at her husband. ”I guess life 'be-
gins at 60,” she said.

Nothing in the Brundages’ past—a
professor’s life at the Connecticut State
College—had exactly prepared them for
life on the "Beautiful Isle,” which is
”Formosa” in Japanese. The name was
Changed to Taiwan when the Chinese re-
gained control in 1945. ”Taiwan” means
”Terraced B-ay”—an apt name, as the rice
paddies which cover almost all available
space are terraced from the ﬂat western
coastline far up the mountain sides.
Shaped like a ﬁsh, Taiwan is only as
large as Connecticut and Vermont, but it
has a population of over nine million!
Translate that into trafﬁc snarls, ' street
hullaballoo, and smells, and you have
some idea of the impressions that as—
saulted the senses of the visitors from
New England.

Instead of an alarm clock or a COH-

were awakened the ﬁrst morning by the

playing a little tune on a ﬂute, promising
to cure all ailments known to civilized
man and a few ‘he ‘has never heard of.

It was some time 'before the Brundages
realized that the broad smiles they met
on every slant-eyed face did not neces-
sarily mean ”Welcome to Taiwan!” It
was the cook’s three children who ﬁnally
broke the news that the grins were one
part amusement and one part amazement
at the strange looking foreigners. Now,
the Brundages write, Americans are a
common sight on the streets, and cause
no comment. In fact, most Taiwanese
wear Western clothes. Only the Chinese
women still wear the traditional straight
sheath with high stiﬂ' collar and slits up
both sides of the skirt. (Three lengths of
slit—unmarried women, married, and
whoops! the divorcee!)

Nowhere is the contrast in living con-
ditions more apparent, of course, than in
their home. In Connecticut it was an old
Colonial farmhouse with pinepanelled
walls, three ﬁreplaces, an orchard and
garden. In Taiwan it is a seven-room
Japanese house, with gardens in front and
back planted with trdp-ical trees, shrubs,
and formally placed rocks. High con-
crete walls with jagged pieces of glass
embedded along the top (for the snag-
ging of trespassers’ trousers?) fence them
in. The house itself is as delicate and
graceful as a house of cards, with sliding
partitions between room‘s—merely light

frames covered with wallpaper. In the
hot, humid summers they are lifted out
and the house quickly opened up from
front garden to back. In the colder
months the rooms are kept cozy with oil
heaters. But not a single ﬁreplace! (Mr.
B. doesn’t mind—no wood-chopping,
either.) -

Yes, it is a far cry from a Connecticut
farm. But even here Mr. Brundage, long
active in 4-H Club work, has organized
a similar program among rural boys. And
Ruth is busier than she ever was back
home, keeping house and carrying on a
full social life with other American
families. To put it brieﬂy they have dis—

covered a whole new world!

ACROSS THE SEA
AND BACK AGAIN

It seems quite ﬁtting that a trans-
planted New Englander in Lincolnshire,
England, should have an address like
”Silver Bitches.” Mrs. M. Sylvia Lofas
writes that since her marriage last June to
a British subject she is now making her
home in a little country village in rural
England. ”This section of England,” she
writes, ”is a farming area and has one
fairly large town much the same as Keene
and its surrounding villages.” One of the
many contrasts Mrs. Lofas likes to de-
scribe for her friends back home is gro-
cery shopping. No supermarkets in the

from Mrs. Green (whose husband is

that there is at least one damnyankee there
who enjoys keeping in touch with the
New England she loves. ’S matter of fact,
though, the records show an even seventy
six besides.

THERE ARE MONTHS IN NEW ENG-
land when the March winds blow,
or when November frost furs the land,
that tend to make stay—at-homes of us all.
And yet the views are longer, for/lack of
screening leaves, the air is clearer, the
highways and byways are trafﬁc-free. And
cars have heaters, country inns have blaz-
ing ﬁres, appetites are enormous and
Yankee meals are made to match . . .
This year why not take an off-season trip
and see what you’ve been missing?

We did. Too late, really, for October
foliage, or so we thought. But we found
it here and there in unexpected places, a
sort of bonus thrown into the four peace-
ful days of driving and unwinding. Start-
lng off from Swampscott, Massachusetts,
‘With the ubiquitous 128, we took to
Route 3, noting nicely spaced motels and
restaurants en route, many of them still
Open. First rule of the adventure: Either
know where you’re going, or expect to
be faced, now and then, with a Closed-
for-the-Season sign.

The highway took us neatly around
Nashua, New Hampshire and onto the
Toll Road, where you drop twenty-ﬁve
cents in a metal basket which politely
green-lights you ahead, presumably after

trailers, and people without change use

ominously, and we ﬁnally arrived in Con-
cord in a state of nerves the like of
which we haven’t experienced since
Tamazunchale (pronounced Thomas and
Charlie) in the state of San Luis Potosi—
Mexico, that is.

Another metal basket feeding on quar-
ters in Hookset, and a pleasant stop at
the attractive and peaceful Kettle and
Crane in Boscawen. Above Boscawen we
turned west on Route 4, driving along a
country road through the ﬂaming Fall
woods. At Salisbury we turned off the
highway to pay our respects to Daniel
Webster’s birthplace. Several times we
almost gave up thinking we had some-
how missed the turn, but a few miles
along we found a sign pointing to the
left, and less than a mile away there it
was, a neat and humble brown building
beside a large white house. The unfriend-
ly gate said Closed. A screen of trees
made even a picture next to impossible.
So we had driven several miles for a peek
at an exterior. Leaving, hufﬁly, we found
a sign at the fork which also said Closed,
but which we couldn’t have seen ap-
proaching from the west as we did. We’d
probably have persevered anyway, but
we’d have been glad to know what to
expect. .

Back on Route 4 to the state line, the
broad and calm Connecticut. At Quechee
Gorge, a few mil-es from White River
Junction, we stopped and peered down
into this spectacular gash in the face of
the earth, a mile-long chasm carved by

the Ottauquechee River 162 feet below
the bridge. To get back our breath and
balance we visited the Dewey shop at one
end of the bridge, where we found ﬁne
gift items, lovely woolens, soft country
tweeds in muted jewel colors.

In the beautiful old town of Wood-
stock we stopped at the White Cupboard
Inn, where we were housed in the annex,
a house two doors from the Inn itself.
Our room looked like and had the ad-
vantages of a motel—private entrance, a
more or less self-contained unit——and, we
discovered in the morning, the disadvan-
tage, as we raced through a downpour to
breakfast. Whit-e Cupboard food is justi-
ﬁably famous, the diningroom a cheer-
ful and pleasant haven in the rain, which
didn’t stop the local boys and girls from
having a pre-game snake dance as we
dined.

The next morning, to the monotonous
tune of the windshield wipers, we set out
again, looking for 100A and the Calvin
Coolidge Birthplace. And did, we bet,
what everybody else does—drove past the
turn and backed up. The visit must be for
everyone, as for us, a memorable ex-
perience. Provided with a fine book by
Vres’t Orton (who wrote Not/Jing Has
Been Changed, in the July, 1957, issue of
YANKEE) the visitor is free to roam
through the barn, "the buttery, the halls of
the house, with each place carefully de-
scribed and documented, every object ac-
counted for. We were amused at the char-
acteristic Vermont thrift ——- doors held
back by hooks and plain, unpainted blocks
of wood, torn unbleached muslin 'at the
rear door, and pleased too at it being so
ﬁttin’. And we read, again, the statement
that appeared in the YANKEE story: ". . .
the exact same things that had always
been there, and were there on August 3,
1923. A good Vermont tfamily never
throws away anything.”

Back on Route 4, we followed a wind-
ing road made gay with markers that in-
dicated plans for widening. It may destroy
some of the scenic beauty (maybe not)
but it will improve it for people in a
hurry. And there were some of those,
even on this late-Fall day. The Ottauque-
chee River plays mild tag with the road

for miles, until the car points up to Sher-
burne Pass, a couple of thousand feet
high. We had toyed with the idea of tak-
ing the chair lift up Pico Peak, Visiting
Long Trail Lodge and similar high spots,
but these were left for a brighter day. Not
far from the Pass we noted two attractive
motels, one really a group of unusually
good fair-sized cabins, both closed and
both—infuriatingly——unnamed. In Rut-
land, where the skies lowered at us but
didn’t rain on us, we saw many motels,
with a good percentage of ’em open,
many shaking themselves after a busy
summer, getting ready for the invasion
of skiers just ahead.

Advised by a good friend in Rutland
not to miss the Marble Exhibit, no matter
what, we drove to Procter expecting an-
other Closed sign, but luck and clean
liVing were on our side—we hit it on its
last day. And thoroughly worthwhile.
Worth, in fact, a special trip during its
May-October weeks. Marble is, of course,
one of Vermont’s great treasures and pro-
Vides the state with a notable industry.
In the exhibit you see examples of the
beautiful material used in many ways——
for garden furniture, exteriors of build-
lngs, memorials, wall and ﬂoor tile,
statues mantlepieces, lamps, ashtrays,
book-ends—many more. In the exhibit are
many corridors lined with alcoves that
display marble in all its beauty, ‘book-
matched’ in the center to make the most
of color and natural design, marbles from
Italy and France and Peru and Belgium,
but mostly from the marble areas of Ver-
mont. There’s also a colo-r-and-sound
mov1e, New Worlds of Marhle, shown
on the premises at frequent intervals.

We left the Marble Exhibit, regretful
but hungry, and were adventureso-me
enough to take a back road north to
Brandon. This didn’t entitle us to mem-
bership in the Explorers’ Club, exactly,
but it did get us over a covered bridge,
always a thrill. Lunch in the Brandon
Inn, Where white morning glories climb
and red birds perch on green wallpaper,
and baked beans and brown bread hit the
Spot exactly. (”Do I wan-t to go to the
game ?” the white-haired gentleman at the
next table asked testily, ”Of course I

came for, isn’t i-tP”)

From Middlebury, which was whoop-
ing it up in a spectacular way, we took
to Route 7 and turned east to Bristol.
Nestled in a notch and overlooking the
Champlain Valley and the rich dairy
country, Bristol is a small and unspoiled
New England town, photogenic and
serene. Excitement? Not a bit of it, that
we found, but then we weren’t looking
for it. We pulled up in front of the inn,
at the edge of the Village green, and
admired Ibig window boxes ﬁlled with
pumpkin and squash and corn husks and
evergreen, found our way through a
maze of hallways to our spotless and
pleasant room, its window looking on a
yard where stood a graceful and embel-
lished coach, gold-lettered Bristol House.
Downstairs, the rooms were filled with
the same welcoming, homelike clutter of
Fall decorations, antiques, magazines~

complained. (See this department for
last month, for our printed approval!)

After Bristol we brieﬂy deserted Ver-
mont and drove across the Champlain
Bridge to New York, stopping at Ticon-
deroga for the tour of the Fort. Then
back to Vermont, and a large and modern
room at the Weathervane Motel in Man-
chester. Here again our good luck out-
pulled the bad: We were able to get into
the Toll Gate House, the oldest and the
last toll house in Vermont, for dinner
on its last night of the season. Back in
the woods, beside some kind of tumbling
Water we could hear and not see, we
found it delightful, the cooking French
and Italian at its best. A lovely outdoor
patio was bare and cold-looking, but in
the summer months, under the Vermont
moon, it must lbe sheer heaven.

The next morning the ﬁrst sun we’d
seen in four days tempted us to make a
return trip to Mt. Equinox’s famous Sky-
line Drive. The edges of the world were
blurred with mist, but the land just be-
low had the deep rich tones and pattern
of an Oriental rug. Ice on the bushes
sparkled and rattled in the wind. No
chance for hot coffee, or a four-state view,

At the Weathervane, we had our ﬁrst
experience of the ‘motel coffee pack’,
little packets, each containing instant cof-

supplied for boiling the water. Scout’s
honor for a dime apiece, and What a

Most of the restaurants, we were told,
sell Danish pastries, which you buy at
dinner and take back with you for your

The Flying Devil

(Continued from page 37)

Manuel Medeiros and an associate
were driving to a stable in the rear of
nearby Cannon Street. They Were pro—
ceeding through an alleyway, nearest the
house known as ”Cad Hills” when the
largest piece of the torpedo ever found,
post-explosively (4 feet long, 1 foot wide,
weight 70 pounds) fell in the lane be~
side them. It grazed the wheel of their
wagon as it landed. It fell in a high arc,
presumably coming over the roof of one
or more buildings; how it missed either
houses or people in this thickly-settled
area one cannot say.

William Monroe, a clerk in the employ
of Mr. Silvester, was working in the
store. He wasthrown across the full width
of the building, a distance of 15 feet,
and his hands were filled with powder.
This he removed, grain by grain, until 3
o’clock the next morning.

In the store at the time were three cus-
tomers, two women and a man. Mr. Sil-
vester was slicing meat. All were thrown
up against ”something solid,” never iden—
tiﬁed. One lady’s dress was ignited, and
Mr. Monroe’s shirt was set on ﬁre. Except
for his hands he suffered no injuries,
however.

One unidentiﬁed man was observed
being showered with a fussillade of ﬂying
debris. His companion ﬂed, frantically
and frightfully convinced of his friend’s
death. Actually, the victim of the fussrl-
lade didn’t even have a scratch.

A few moments before, the crowd of
persons listening to the political speeches
had disbanded. Had they remained there,
had the torpedo not been stopped abrupt-
ly in full ﬂight by the stump, the most
fearful loss of life probably would have
been inevitable. For Mr. Cunningham, In
the moment of his enthusiasm had re-
marked of the powder (forced in under
hydraulic pressure of 10 tons to the square
inch), ”I rammed it in, packed it in, and
jammed it in, hurrahl,” adding the pro-
jectile probably would have gone "half
a mile or more” if it hadn’t been halted.

MARCH 1958 YANKEE

 

 




 

 

 

 

 

As it was, considerable public turmoil
was created. Word got around that the
”gasometer” which supplied the city with
illuminating gas and which was located
nearby, had blown up. The clanging ﬁre
bells and thundering engines in the
streets only added to the popular impres-
siOn that something awful had occurred.

Thus, there was considerable interest in
the court proceedings two days later. Mr.
Cunningham was charged with "wilfully,
feloniously and maliciously” destroying a
building. The maximum penalty for this
offense was 20 years in jail. The defend-
ant, however, tended to view the matter
philosophically and said he was so re-
lieved that, miraculously, he had no man’s
blood on his hands, that he was not wor-
ried about his own fate.

To a newspaper reporter, he conﬁded,
”It was a hell of a thing I did. I thought
I’d have a big bonﬁre. It never entered
my head the thing would go tearing down
the street the way it did. I took the nose
Ofi it, and I thought it would stay right
where it was and blaze. I was thoughtless
and careless, but I had no idea of blowing
Up buildings . .

Still, ﬁve buildings were more or less

damaged. Hundreds of persons had mi—
raculous escapes, and Police Chief Doug—
lass, emphasizing that a 250-pound pro-
)jjectile had, after all, been ﬁred in a pub-
llC street, suggested the matter might be
referred 'to the Grand Jury.
. The defense attorney, James L. Gilling-
ham, said the torpedo which was ﬁred,
known to the Navy as the ”Flying Devil,”
belOnged to him, Mr. Gillingham. He
said“ he was familiar with its nature, and
was. now under contract to furnish the
United States Government with several
others like it, of Mr. Cunningham’s man-
ufacture.

Said the attorney, ”The like of this
affair is not going to happen again and
the Court may be assured that Cunning-

am 18 not going to discharge another one
9f my torpedoes in this manner.” In ask-
fflg for a delay in court action, he added,
.It Would be a frightful, wicked, dia'bol—
lCal thing for a man to ﬁre such an in-
Strument in such a way while in his right
senses, but Cunningham was intoxicated.

ningham, undoubtedly a man of great tal-
ents, also had no enemies. For Chief of
Police Douglass said he thought $1,000
bail was too much; it was cut to $500. In
a subsequent court appearance, the
charges also were reduced by being ”re-
written under another statute, so that max-
imum penalty was only 60 days or $50.”
Mr. Cunningham was, accordingly, ﬁned
$50 after he announced he had adjusted
”as well as could be” damage caused by
the explosion.

In announcing the penalty, the staid
Evening Standard commented that it was.
”an expensive lesson against too exuber-
ant demonstrations of delight.”

Fifty dollars being what it is today, one
might be inclined to "think Mr. Cunning-
ham got quite a lot of exuberance for his
expense.

HUMANE METHODS OE'SLAUGHTER
OF LIVESTOCK

Mr. JOHNSON of Texas.
dent, I move that the Senate proceed to
the consideration of Calendar No. 1759,
H. R. 8308.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill
will be stated by title for the information
of the Senate.

The LEGISLATIVE CLERK." A bill (H. R.

8308) to establish the use of humane
methods of slaughter of livestock/as a

policy ef the United States, and for other
purposes. -

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
question is on agreeing to the motion of
the Senator from Texas.

The motion was agreed to; and the
Senate proceeded to consider the bill
(H. R. 8308) to establish the use of hu-
mane methods of slaughter of livestock
as a policy of the United States, and for

. other purposes, which had” been reported

from the Committee on Agriculture and
Forestry, with an. amendment, to strike
out all after the enacting clause and
insert: ‘

That the Congress ﬁnds that the use of
inhumane methods in the slaughtering of
livestock and the handling of livestock in
connection with slaughter is contrary to the
public interest in that it causes needless
suffering, has an adverse effect upon public
acceptance of the products of livestock, and

is detrimental to the interests of producers.»

It is, therefore, declared to be the policy of
the United States that the slaughtering of
livestock and the handling of livestock in
connection with slaughter be carried'out by
humane methods. As used in this act the

- term “livestock” shall be-deemed to include

poultry. .

__ SEC. 2. To ’aid in effectuating such policy
the Secretary of Agriculture is authorized
and directed (a) to conduct, assist, and
fostery research 'for the development and
deter ‘ ination of methods of slaughter of
livestock and of handling livestock in con-
nection with slaughter which are humane in
the light of Current scientiﬁc knowledge and
practicable with reference to the necessary
speed and scope of slaughtering Operations,
(b) to promote and encourage the. use of hu-
mane methods of slaughter of livestock and
handling of livestock in connection with
slaughter by disseminating the results of the
scientiﬁc research provided for in subpara-

graph (a) of this section and by working with

slaughterers, humane associations, and other

interested persons to accomplish such pur-

poses, (c) to report to the- Congress on Janu-
ary 1, 1959, and annually thereafter con-
cerning actions taken pursuant to this act,
and (d) to report to the Congress changes,
if any, and the extent thereof, in the meth-
ods of slaughter adopted by the slaughtering
industry, together with such recommenda-
tions on the need for legislative action as the
Secretary may determine are warranted in
the light of scientiﬁc research and develop-
ments in the industry. Within 2 years after
the enactment of this act the Secretary shall
submit to Congress a complete legislative
proposal setting out those methods of slaugh-

ter found to be humane and requiring their.

adoptian by slaughterers. _

for the purposes of the act. The committee
shall meet at least once each year at the
call of the Secretary or the chairman.

Mr. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Presi—
dent, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. / The
clerk will call the roll. ‘

The legislative )clerk proceeded to call
the roll. ' -

Mr. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the

order for the quorum call be rescinded. .

Mr. MORSE.‘ Mr. President, I object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. , The

. clerk will continue the call of the roll.

Mr. JOHNSON of Texas (after cono‘

ferring with Mr. MORSE). Mr. President,

I again ask unanimous consent that the
order for the quorum call be rescinded.

ThePRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection? The Chair hears none, and
it is so ordered. . -

The question is on agreeing to the
committee amendment in the nature of.
a substitute,~..which is open to amend-
ment. . . .

Mr. ELLENDER. Mr. President, we
have before us the so—called humane

slaughter bill. '-The Committee on Agri- -

culture and Forestry has considered such
legislation during the-past two sessions
of Congress. . .

During the last session, the committee
reported a more or less stud'y bill. The
Senate passed that bill and sent it to the
House for action, where ' it died from“
inaction. This year, the House took up
the matter and passed a bill which, in
turn, was considered by the Senate Com-
mittee on Agriculture and Forestry.

I have been in the Senate for 22 years,

and I know of no bill which has provoked «

more letter writing and telegraphic com~
munications than the so-called humane
slaughter bill which passed the House.
I am quite satisﬁed that if those who
wrote the ﬂood of letters and telegrams
knew all the implications of the issue,
what the House bill contained and what
the Senate bill means, they would not
be so vociferous about and so anxious
for passage of the House bill alone.

In my judgment, the House bill is more
or less a make-believe one.

animals in the majority of slaughter-
houses scattered throughout the United
States. The bill has .no penalties at—
tached to it. It has no teeth in it. It is
a mere shadow of a bill. For that reason,
the Senate committee saw ﬁt to hold ex-
tensive hearings, in the hope that we
Could report to the Senate a ~measure
which, might better meet the objectives
of those who desire to foster truly hu-
mane slaughter practices.

The great difﬁculty with legislation of
this kind—and the evidence will so
show—is that no Federal agency has
made any study as to what methods of
. slaughter are actually humane. Yet the

bill passed by the House undertakes to
set forth what methods of slaughter are
humane. Of course, the argument is
made that some countries, principally in

Europe, have utilized the House bill’s~

methods for many years. That is cor-
rect. But the question 1emains: are
those methods really humane?

, The answer is readily apparent, after
reading thehearings held by our com-
mittee. No one knows whether they are
As a matte1 of fact there
is much evidence to the effect that the
. methods prescribed in the bill are not
consistent with real humane slaughter-
ing. At best the methods prescribed in
the House bill should be studied by ex-
perts; before being written into law.
I would certainly be the ﬁrst to; advocate

I . and foster compulsory humane slaugh-

ter legislation if the methods required
,had been found to be humane.

"Therefore, in an effort to determine
which methods are humane, the Commit-
tee on Agriculture and Forestry, after
hearing much evidence, reported to the
VSenate the pending bill requiring that
7 humane slaughter methods be intensively
studied by the Secretary of Agriculture
and that the Secretary report his ﬁnd-
ings to us within 2 years.

Let me be frank with Senators. The

’ - committee bill IS no subte1fuge. It means
‘ ‘_ what it says. Itjdirects the Secretary to

study and specify humane slaughter

it, I . 1 methods, and to report to the committee

Which methods are found to be humane
within 2 years. In the meantime, the
Secretary is directed to obtain volun-
tary compliance by packers with those
methods.

I can assure Senators that at the expi—
ration of 2 years, if there has not been
- voluntary compliance with methods rec-
, ommended .by the Secretary, I personally
' will lead the ﬁght in the Senate for a
humane slaughter bill with teeth in it,
not a wishy-washy subterfuge such as
that passed by the House under the

"guise of humane slaughter legislation.

‘The bill as passed by the Housecontains
no criminal penalties. .

If we are to pass a bill to enforce hu-
.. mane slaughtering, it should apply to all

,slaughterhouses which are engaged in
_ interstate commerce, and it should con-
' tain penalties.

,, The House bill, on the other 'hand,
undertakes to arbitrarily deﬁne what

VS ' methods of slaughter are humane and

. .then states that if slaughterhouses do not

'— ' ~.l.—ronow those methods, the only penalty

they Suffer is that they cannot sell meat
to a Government agency. Is that not

"‘5

. a limp deterrent? They cannot sell meat

. \ ,

to a, Government agency. What will that
mean? It will mean that; of the 3,400
slaughterhoUses in the country, only
some 240 would be affected under the
House bill.

What the Committee on Agriculture

. and Forestry sought to do was to require

a real study of humane slaughter meth-
ods and to require that the results of
such a study be made available in 2 years.
At the end of that time, or even earlier,
if the necessary studies had been made,
Congress would be in a position to enact
sensible and meaningful "legislation—-
legislation setting forth methods found to
be deﬁnitely humane—legislation with
teeth in it—legislation which. would ap-
ply to all slaughterhouses engaged in in-
terstate comme1 ce.

M1. MOWRSE Mr. President, will the
Senator yield? 7

Mr. ELLENDER. Iyield.

Mr. MORSE. , Mr. President, I am sure
the Senator from Louisiana has received
some messages on a delicate point which
has to do with the position of the ortho-
dox Jewish rabbis. Some of them seem
to be under the impression that the adop-
tion of the pending bill, or a similar'bill,
will in some way interfere with the re-
ligious practices of the orthodox Jewish

.faith. ,Can the Senator from Louisiana

enlighten me in regard to that matter?

Mr. ELLENDER. There is no question
that the testimony .

' Mr. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Presi-
dent, will the Senator speakhlouder?

.Mr. ELLENDER. There is no question
that testimony before the committee is
replete with statements from various as-
sociations of rabbis that they 'feel‘ the
House bill will, to a large extent, inter-
fere with. their religious rites.

We heard, rabbis representing various
organizations throughout the country at
a full- day hearing of the committee.
They were unalterably opposed to the
pending bill.

It 1s true that there are some segments .

of the Jewish faith which are in favor of
the bill. However, a reading of the testi-
mony will Show that they have been more
or less forced into that position, having
been told, “Unless you are for the House

bill, you will get something much worse. ” ~

This fact was brought out very clearly
during the testimony.

Mr. MORSE. Is there any testimony
in the RECORD from any Orthodox Jewish
group which indicates that they can ad-
just their religious rites to the provi~
sions of the bill? ,

Mr. ELLENDER. They all answer
“No” to that question. That is the gist
of the testimony.

Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, I
hope the Senator from, Oregon will ask
me the same questions when I make my
presentation.

Mr. MORSE. I intend to.

Mr. HUMPHREY. The matter has
been gone into extensively. There are
twoprovisions in the bill passed by the
House which would protect the religious
right of any person with respect to
slaughtering in connection with any
ritualistic practﬁce. ‘

Mr. ELLENDER The Senator was
present when I conducted the hearings.

July :29 _

He conducted heaiings on the same sub-
ject 2 years before that.

Mr. HUMPHREY. That is correct.

Mr. ELLENDER. It may be that the
evidence at that time was a little dif-
ferent from what was submitted this
'year, but I am here to say that if the
record is examined, it will be seen that
most of the witnesses who appeared in
opposition to the bill were unanimous
in their views——

Mr. HUMPHREY. In thei1 opinion.

Mr. ELLENDER. In their opinion—-
that is correct—that it would not pro-
tect their faith. These men were rab-
bis. Their opinion is certainly the opin-
ion of experts.

Mr. HUMPHREY. I wish to conﬁrm
that what the": Senator has said is abso—
lutely correct; that the testimony which
was presented was that the opinion was
that the bill might lead to some form of
practice or some form of regulation
which was contrary to certain religious
practices.

But also, upon careful examination,
there is no evidence that there is any
word within the bill which would lead
to such an assumption except that dec-
ades ago, in‘ the 18th century, in such
countries as, for example, those in Cen—
tral Europe, where there were vicious
forms of ranti—Semitism, some persons
who were anti- Semites proposed humane
slaughter, and deductions were drawn

. from that.

I have the greatest sympathy and feel-
ing for those who testiﬁed. I have spent
3 years listening to such testimony. I
do not wish to speak on the time of the .
Senator from Louisiana now, but on my
own time I shall speak further about
this. I shall address myself to this par-
ticular point, because it was the subject
of considerable concern in the other
House, and there is correspondence
Which is quite revealing.

Mr. NEUBERGER. Mr. President will
the Senator yield? ‘

Mr. ELLENDER. I yield.

Mr. NEUBERGER. Simply because
the issue has: been raised, at this point
I think there! should now be placed in
the RECORD one paragraph from a letter
dated June 20, 1958, sent to the distin~
guished junior Senator from Minnesota
[Mr. HUMPHREY], who is the principal
sponsor of the bill, by a man whom I
regard as the most eminent member of
the Jewish faith in this Nation. He is

our former colleague, Herbert H. Leh-

man, o-f New York. Besides being a dis-
tinguished former Member of the Senate,
he was also governor of the most popu-—‘
lous State in the Union and had an il-
lustrious career'in many other varied
ﬁelds, besides.

One paragraph of the letter from for-
mer Senator Lehman, written only a
month ago, prior to the time he and
Mrs. Lehman undertook a journey to
Europe, reads as follows:

However, I want you to know, should the
question come up in the course of debate or
other consideration of this legislation, that
in my judgment, for what it is worth, your
bill, with adequate protection for Jewish
ritual slaughter—with the Anfuso amend-
ment as it could, and should, be modiﬁed—-
not only represents no real threat to the

' sensibilities of my faith, but is, indeed, con-

 




" 1‘ —-1*"’9'5 8 '

sistent with the objections Of humaneness
which are honored in the Jewish faith and
tradition as well as in others.

Mr. ELLENDER. Let me be frank in
stating that the testimony on this point 1s
replete with statements to the contrary.
The vast majority .Of the witnesses who
testiﬁed—and the Senator from Minne—
sota was present—tOOk-the position that
the reason why the Anfuso provision was
put into the bill—and some members of
the Jewish faith testiﬁed favorably to the
House bill—was that its phraseology was
such as to allow some alternatives. SO I
know their worries. They felt that un-
less the House bill is passed, another bill
with more stringent restrictions would
be enacted. In other words, they felt
that the House bill would be the lesser of
two evils.

' Mr. HUMPHREY. I do not think
anyone has been closer to the proposed
legislation than has the junior Senator
from Minnesota. It has caused me much
heartache. I can honestly say that no
one ever made an attempt to force any-
body into anything. In fact, as I shall
point out in my own time, the amend-
ments which relate to ritualistic slaugh-
ter were written by persons who have
some concern about the matter.

, Of all the things I would never want

to do in my life—I can say this on my
honor——never would I want, in any way,
to offend anyone’s religious practice or
deny the utmost religious freedom. I
would rather we should never legislate on
any item than that we would ever do such
a thing. I would not put my name to any

bill if I thought it would ever‘do such a
a thing. I may be in error, but, as the

Lord is my judge, I would never do such '

a thing, because religious freedom is the
most precious of all our rights.

Mr. ELLENDER. In my remarks I
did not mean to leave the impression
that I thought the Senator was intimi-
dated.‘ I Was speaking about the per-

sons who appeared before the committee

as witnesses on this question. There is
testimony to that effect; it is in the
record. '

It has been stated that Mr. Leo Pfefm

fer, associate general counsel of the
American Jewish Congress, was strongly
forthe measure. As a matter of fact,
he was not for either side.
to that effect is in the record.- Yet that
letter was used, at ﬁrst, by the dis-
tinguished Senator from Minnesota, as I

remember, in making the point that the ‘

American Jewish Congress favored the
bill. I shall read the letter into the
,RECORD. It shows that the American
Jewish Congress took neither side. I
cite that letter because there was testi-
mony to the effect that there was some
compulsion. exerted to make some seg-
ments Of the Jewish faith accept What
was written into the House bill. .
Mr HUMPHREY. Is it not tiue,
. however, that Mr. Pfeffer actually drew
the language of the amendment in the
bill, which is designed, I say most re-
spectfully, to protect religious freedom?
Mr. ELLENDER. I do not recall.
Mr. HUMPHREY. I shall quote for
the RECORD a statement that he ,did. I
swear that he did draw such language at

Mr. SYMINGTON. Mr.
Will the Senator yield?

Mr. ELLENDER. I yield.

Mr. SYMINGTON. As I understand
the bill now, it corrects Objections which
the orthodox Jewry have to the bill. I
was worried because in my State many
ﬁne members Of the orthodox Jewish
faith felt the bill did not take care of
the actual slaughtering of animals in ac—
cordance with their ritual. That was
corrected ‘

Theie was apprehension that the bill
did not correct the matter of the prep-
aration Of animals for slaughter. That
was con ected.

There was also apprehension that it
would be considered inhumane to per-
form Shehitah. A provision was put in

the bill stating speciﬁcally that Shehitah

was humane.
Finally, a letter was written on May
13, 1958, I believe, by the _
Mr. ELLENDER. A letter from Mr.

Mr. SYMINGTON. No; a letter of, I
believe, May 13, from Mr. Farrington,
counsel for the Department Of Agricul-
ture. In this letter he stated that he
did not think the bill would. properly
protect the orthodox Jewish ritual.

I join with my distinguished colleague
from Minnesota in emphasizing that un-

anything which would affect any reli-

fer, associate general counsel of the
American Jewish Congress, 4 who the
Senator from Minnesota said wrote this
provision, I ask unanimous consent that
this letter of May 14, 1958, be printed at
this point 1n the RECORD.

‘ There being no Objection, the letter.

was 01 dered to be printed in the RECORD,
as follows:

MAY 14, 1958.
COTYS MOUSER, ,

Secretary, Senate Agriculture Commit-
tee, Senate Ofﬁce Building, Wash-
ington, D. C'. .

DEAR -MR. MOUSER: I am happy to reply to
your request that I clarify the present posi-
tion of the American Jewish Congress in
respect to the humane slaughtering bill now
being considered by your 00mmittee. The
Objective of achieving humane slaughtering
practices, however worthy the goal, is -.be-
yond the purview and scope of the program
Of the American Jewish Congress; For that
reason the American Jewishv.00ngress has

never taken any position regarding humane -

slaughtering legislation as such. O-ur inter-
est in the present bill and predecessors arises
from our concern with the protection of the
right Of Jewish religious slaughter known
as shehitah in accordance with our policy.

' Therefore, while we do not endorse humane—

slaughtering legislation, we dO'not by the
same token oppose such legislation if it is
clear that it does not.._restrict or handicap
slaughtering in accordance with the require-
ments or practices Of the Jewish religion, or
the handling and preparation necessary for
such ritual slaughtering. This has been and
remains the position of the American Jewish
Congress.

AMERICAN JEWISH CONGRESS.

LEO PFEFFER. .

Mr. ELLENDER. Mr. President, I re-
member now that'Mr. Pfeffer is the man
who prepared the so-called Anfuso
amendment. As I recall, I suggested
that he reduce his views to writing, be-
cause various witnesses testiﬁed that
some members of the Jewish faith were
more Or less led into supporting the

l—Iouse version with the so-called Anfuso ' -

amendment, lest a worse bill be written.

Mr. MORSE Mr. President, will the
Senator yield?

M1 ELLENDER. Iyield.

Mr. MORSE. I desire the attention Of
the Senator from Minnesota. I have
raised this question, because, as the Sen-
atOr from Minnesota knows, I think that‘
when we have such delicate and difﬁcult
issues involved in"a bill, they should be
brought out‘on the ﬂoor for full public
disclosure and discussion As the Sena-
tor from Minnesota knows, I am a co- .
sponsor Of his bill. '

Mr. HUMPHREY. I certainly do.

Mr. MORSE. SO far as I know, the
bill does not, in fact, infringe upon the ,,
religious freedom Of the orthodox Jews.
I wanted to make a record today, how-'
ever, so that those 'who think to the con-
trary may make their case. I desire the
Senator from Minnesota to know that
there was nOt the slightest intention on
the part Of the senior Senator from Ore-
gOn in any way to question his, convic—
tions with respect to religious freedom. ,

Now I should like to have the attention .
of my colleague, the distinguished junior ~
Senator from Oregon [Mr. NEUBERGER], ”
for a moment. He read into the RECORD
a paragraph from a letter written by
former Senator Lehman, which will have
great weight in the debate in the Senate.
I ask my colleague if he knows whether
former Senatm Lehman is a member of
the orthodox group Of the Jewish faith
or is a member of the ref01m or con- .
servative group. _

Mr. NEUBERGER.“ While I' am not.
authorized to speak concerning former
Senator Lehman’s religious views, it is.
my understanding that he is a member '
of what is called the liberal or reform
group.

Mr. MORSE I think he is a good- Wit—
ness, in any event. But the objection
seems to be coming from the orthodox
group. I think we ought to make it per—
fectly certain that We have adequate evi-l
dence from the orthodox group itself
with respect to the effect Of the bill it-
self On the orthodox group. That is Why
I raised the question.

Mr. CARROLL. Mr. President——

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
LAUSCHE in the chair.) Does the Senator
from Louisiana yield to the Senator from
Colorado?

Mr ELLENDER. Iyield.

Mr. CARROLL. I should like to ask
the junior Senator from Oregon [Mr.
NEUBERGER] whether the Anfuso amend-
‘ment, as referred to in the letter from
the distinguished former Senator from
New York, Mr.- -,Lehman is included 1n the.
bill which has been passed by the House.
" Mr. NEUBERGER. The Anfuso
amendment is included in the bill as it ‘
came to us from the House of Represent-
atives, after it was passed by the House.

 




\ * .Jnasmuch as I have been asked about
it, let me say that in my opinion—for
whatever it may be worth-+1 believe the
Anfuso amendment adequately protects
the religious and ritual slaughter
methods which have been referred to
during the debate.

Mr. CARROLL. I read now from page
2, section 2, paragraph (b) of House bill

' ' 8308, as passed by the House of Repre-

sentatives:
(b) by slaughtering in accordance with the

I . ritual requirements of the Jewish faith or any

other religious faith that prescribes a method
of slaughter whereby the animal suffers loss
bf consciousness by anemia of the brain
caused by the simultaneous and instantan-
eous severance of the carotid arteries with
a sharp instrument.

, Is that the amendment?
Mr. HUMPHREY. That is the ofﬁcial

approVal of kosher slaughter as humane,

contained in the House bill Which I sup-
port.

Mr. CARROLL. Does the distin-
guished Senator from Minnesota intend
to submit such an amendment or \any
other amendment? ‘

Mr. HUMPHREY. I do not intend to
submit an amendment Suggestions
have been made in regard toan amend-
ment which would relate to this partic-
ular subsection.
amendment to be unnecessary. I be—
lieve it is only necessary to clarify the
point, which we shall do in the course of
the debate, in connection with estab-
lishing the legislative history. But if
such an amendmentwere submitted, 'of
course it would have to be‘considered on
its merits.

I, myself, have no intention of offering
such an amendment. .

Mr. CARROLL. The distinguished
Senator from Minnesota has been most

helpful to me on this matter. I agree
with the Senator from Louisiana that I
have received more mail on this issue
than on almost any other; and some of
the g1 eat intellectual leadeis in Colorado
have written to me about it. I, in turn,
have conferred with the ofﬁce of the
junior Senator from Minnesota [Mr.
HUMPHREY] because I consider him to be
one of the experts in this ﬁeld.

So I wish to associate myself with the
remarks 0f the distinguished junior Sen-
ator from Minnesota [Mr.HUMP1-IREY].
I- know he stands for religious freedom.
I realize the serious pr'oblems with which
he has been confronted in this connec-
tion, and I shall be very much interested
in the debate as it proceeds today.

I thank the Senator from Louisiana for
yielding to me. _

Mr. ELLENDER. Mr. President, I
wish to say in perfect frankness to the
Senate that, during the hearings, I asked
some of the rabbis who represented the
Jewish Orthodox Church whether or not
it was possible to include in the bill lan-
guage which would be satisfactory to
them. Their answer was “No.”

Mr. President, what concerns me more
. than anything else about this problem
of . humane slaughter is the fact that
some elements are making to the people
of the country representations that the
House bill requires humane slaughter

I believe any further,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -—- SENATE
That is .

methods in all slaughterhouses.
the impression being left.
What the Senate committee desires-

as it desired 2 years ago—is to have a “
study made of humane slaughter meth-,

ods in order to determine which meth-
ods are, indeed, humane. I, for one, do
not want to go off halfcocked, so to
speak.

Two years ago the House of Repre- -

sentatives rejected that p1 oposal and
would not even hold hearings on ou1
bill. If the House had done so, we would
not be in the quandary we ﬁnd ourselves
today—we would be in a position to enact
constl uctive legislation instead of, I fea1,

putting emotion ﬁist and commonsense
second. The House, it now develops, has
proceeded to draft its own bill, which is
before the Senate at this time.

I personally conducted the committee
hearings on the issue.

Mr. President, I still ﬁrmly believe that
the best method by which the Congress
can proceed is to have the Department
of Agriculture make a study of humane

slaughtering methods, with a view to-

ward providing us deﬁnite information
as to which methods are humane, so we
can be sure we are not legislating in the
dark on premises which time may prove
to be false.

All of us favor humane slaughtering
methods. But the evidence from the
Department, as well as the evidence from
other sources, is that, up to now, no

.methods which properly can be called

humane have been applied to all animals.
For instance, there has been under

consideration the method called the'

direct blow—-in other words, one blow
on the head of an animal. The evidence
shows that that method may be suc-
cessfully and humanely applied to cattle,
but not to sheep or to hogs. -

Then there is the asphyxiation method.
The evidence shows that if a little too
much of the asp‘hyxiating gas is used the
animal’s ﬂesh may" be contaminated.
Furthermore, according to some of the
witnesses, if the asphyxiation method is

to work properly, all the animals treated,

at one time must be of the same size
and weight, so that the same amount
of gas will be inhaled by each of them.

On the other hand, if a larger animal
is included in a pen with smaller ones,
and if gas then is applied, more gas will
be required to asphyxiate the larger
animal, and the additional amount of
gas- may contaminate the ﬂesh- of the
smaller animals.

So at the present time the Department
of Agriculture is at a loss to make a de-
termination as to what methods are best.

Our bill, which is in the nature of a
substitute for the bill passed by the
House of Representatives, provides for a
study of these methods, looking toward
the enactment of mandatory. humane

slaughter legislation, based on recom- '

mended methods, within 2 years. I as-
sure the Senate that, when the Depart-
ment of Agriculture completes the
studies called for in the Senate bill—~and
I know it will make them—I personally
will lead the ﬁght to pass a bill with teeth
in it, to make it a crime'for anyone en-
gaged in interstate commerce to use
inhumane methods of slaughtering.

July 29 I

As the bill passed by the House of
Rep1esentatives now stands, I would not.
call it a humane slaughtering bill. I say
this because it would not apply to more
than 240 of the 3,400 slaughterhouses
scattered throughout the Nation. What
is more, the bill does not provide for any
criminal penalties. I repeat that the
only penalty provided by the House bill
is that those who do not use the methods
prescribed by the bill cannot sell their
products to the Government.

Mr. JAVITS. Mr. “President, will the
Senator from Louisiana yield to me?

Mr. ELLENDER. I yield.

Mr. JAVITS. I did not participate in
the debate a little while ago with respect
to shehitah because I believe that the
principal issue the Senator from Louisi—
ana is discussing now relates to the
merits or demerits of the committee
measure versus the amendment—which

-"has been printed—submitted by the Sen-
. ator from Minnesota.

I deeply believe that all the arguments
which have been made in regard to that
issue relate to other matters—for in—
stance, the desirability or lack of desir-
ability of the particular type of regula-
tion p1 ovide for in the bill as passed by
the House of Representatives. I shall
add1ess myself to that subject when I
believe it to be germane to the debate.

Let me ask whether any consideration
was given by the committee to this possi-
ble compromise: To havethe study suc—
ceeded by a ﬁling, by the Secretary of
Agriculture, of a set of regulations which
would be subject to congressional veto,
as in the case of a reorganization plan.

Similarly, let me ask whether consid-
eration has been given to still a third pos-
sibility—more or less in between the
Poage bill and the committee study
plan-which would make the advocates
of the humane slaughter measure believe
that some afﬁrmative regulation would
be established at some time. Afte1 all, ,
their chief objections—as the Senator
from Louisiana knows much bette1 than
I do—are directed to a study which would
not reSult in the enactment of effective
legislation. ,

M1. ELLENDER. No; we did not con-
sider a ﬁling of regulations by the Sec1e-
tary of Agriculture. No- proposal was
made along the lines suggested by my
distinguished friend. However, I want
to give assurance to all Senators that we
have written a provision into the sub-
stitute bill, in no uncertain terms, that
legislation will be forthcoming in 2 years.
This is not a do- nothing bill.

I desire to pay tribute to the Humane
Society. The fact that they have been
bringing this matter before Congress in
the past 2 or 3 years is causing many
slaughtering houses throughout the
country to take note that, sooner or later,
Congress will act. '

I have no doubt in my own mind that
if the Department of Agriculture can
make a study of humane slaughtering
and propose a program, the Department
will have no difﬁculty in getting volun—

tary compliance on the part of the ,'

slaughtering houses before the 2-year
period expires.

But if the slaughtering houses do not
voluntary comply, then Congress can

 




  

 

 

 

1.958 ’

and should act, and pass a bill which
would have teeth in it.

I repeat that what the House has
passed amounts to nothing. It is not a
humane slaughter bill at all, because it
is not enforceable except as to those
slaughteihouses that sell to the Govern-
ment. ,

Mr. JAVITS. May I ask the Senator
one more question?

Mr. ELLENDER. Yes. ‘ '

Mr. JAVITS. It is a fact, is it not, if
the Senate does not pass the identical
bill passed by the House, the matter‘will
then gate-”conference and at that time
will be Subject to negotiation? .

Mr. ELLENDER. That is a fact. ‘ So
far as I am concerned, I am willing to
lean over backwards and do anything I
can to have an effective humane
slaughter bill passed at an early date.

But I am not going to yield to pure
emotion and forget the responsibility I
owe to my country and the people of my
State to legislate in a responsible and
realistic manner.

As a matter of fact, the record will
show that during the last Congress it
was our suggestion that a study be made
of this subject, so that we could in time
prepare a mandatory bill. Considerable
testimony has been given about certain
methods which are satisfactory in Eu-
rope, and which are also satisfactory
in a few slaughterhouses in our own
country. But we have yet to hear of any
speciﬁc methods of humane slaughter-
ing which Can be established and made
applicable to- all animals and be used
by the various slaughtering houses
throughout the country.

Mr. President, as I pointed out before,
the substitute bill now before the Sen-
‘ate provides for research to develop hu-
mane methods. If this bill is passed, I
offer to present to the Appropriations
Committee, before the Congress ad-
journs, a proposal to obtain money to
start the study'immediately.

The bill also provides for promotion
0f the use of humane methods. In the
meantime, the Department of Agricul-
ture, as it develops humane methods,
can promote the use of such methods.
I feel conﬁdent if that course is followed,
we can have within 2 years humane
slaughtering on a voluntary basis, in
many slaughterhouses throughout the
country. If these methods are not
adopted voluntarily, then Congress
. should, and I feel sure will, act.

. I wish to make another point. As I
said before, there is no question that if
a study is made by the Department,

within 2 years it‘will be able to ascer-
‘ tain speciﬁc methods of humane slaugh-
ter. Then would be the time for the
Congress to enact legislation which
would be effective and would subject
slaughtering houses engaged in inter-
state commerce to the provisions of any
measure enacted by Congress.

In the proposed study, the Secretary
of Agriculture would have the assistance
of an advisory committee, drawn from
groups interested in the humane slaugh-
ter movement, which would include the
ﬁelds of humane treatment of animals,
livestock production, ritualistic and
other slaughtering methods, animal hus-
bandry, and veterinary medicine. Vet-

  

use of asphyxiatinggas.

reason: We have had testimony pre-

~ It, is
true that in order to obtain the serum
animals could be slaughtered in slaugh-
terhouses that do not engage in inter-

' that the cost of making the serum might

be doubled or tripled. If a study is made,
it is enti1ely possible that even with the
uSe of gas on animals, the blood could
be used to make the serum We do not
know that at- this time. That is why we
need more study.

This is just one example of the many
difﬁculties inherent in the House bill.
The record clearly shows that further
study into this ﬁeld is absolutely neces-
sary. In essence, we are attempting to
deal with unknown quantities.

It is impossible to say how many other
serious problems of this, type might
arise if we rush into the ﬁeld of humane
slaughter methods without being fully
aware of all the possible consequences.

Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, will
the Senator yield?

Mr. ELLENDER. Iyield. “

Mr. HUMPHREY. I recall that there
was testimony from, I believe, the An-
chor Serum Co., which is one of the larg-
est serum companies in the United States,
and a company with which my family
has done business for 25 years, relating
to the problem of hog~cholera serum as
it may be affected by, certain types of
so-called slaughtering practices.

The statement of the distinguished

. Senator from Louisiana, in pointing out

what he considers to be a weakness of
the bill as passed by the other body, and
the weakness of the amendment I have
pending at the desk, is to the effect that
the proposal applies only to a few slaugh-
tering houses, and that there are more
than 3,000 to which it would not apply.
Enough cholera serum'could be obtained
from the 3,000 slaughtering houses to
which the bill does not apply. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana cannot have it both
ways. If the bill does not go far enough

' in terms of coverage, then it cannot go

so far as to thwart the production of
hog cholera serum.

I might add that today there are other
large slaughtering houses which utilize
humane slaughtering practices. Those

houses seem to have been doing quite '”

well, both in terms of research in the
ﬁeld of biologicals and serums and in
the ﬁeld of meat products.

Mr. ELLENDER. Mr. President, I in-
timated to my good friend from Minne—
sota that' it would be entirely possible
for slaughtering houses doing intrastate
business to furnish sufficient blood for
the production of hog cholera serum.

Mr. HUMPHREY. And even those
doing inte1 state business.

Mr. ELLENDER. I made that thought
clear, I believe.

M1. HUMPHREY. Yes.

'It is also entirely

    
 
 

use of gas. I believe all those things
ought to be studied. The "Department
of Agriculture stands ready and willing
to make the study. The Department
would have done so during the last ses-
sion if the House had acted on the bill
the Senate passed last year.

Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, will
the Senator yield?

Mr. ELLENDER. I yield.

Mr. HUMPHREY. As the Senator
knows better than «anyone else in this
Chamber, there has been in the Depart-
ment of Agriculture for more than a
quarter century a division which deals
with serum control.

of Agriculture engaged in reseaich in
the ﬁeld of serums, viruses, biologicals,
antibiotics, and so forth. There has
been nothing to interfere with the De-
partment of Agriculture making such a
study long ago.

As I shall show in the debate, humane
slaughtering practices are today already
utilized by some of the largest slaugh-

tering houses. It is amazing to me that '

at the very late hour of the last week
of the testimony on the bill, the serum
companies and the Department of Agri-
culture should suddenly discover that
them may be some problem about serum,
although they did not discover it 2 years
ago when the hearings were held. Dr.
Clar kson, of the Department of Agricul-
ture, was asked again and again whether

humane slaughter mg practices might be

injurious to the research efforts of the
Department. I have the record of the
testimony. » , '

Furthermore, I want the RECORD to
note that I wrote to the Anchor Serum
I am familiar with the operations
of that company.
which my family is associated has sold
millions of cubic centimeters of hog
cholera serum over a period of 40 years.
I wrote to the company to the effect that
I considered their efforts not to be very
meritorious, because if they were really

concerned they should have been con—.

cerned before the last 3 days of the hear-
ings, since the bill has been before the
Congress for3 years.

Mr. ELLENDER. Mr. President, the
Senator knows that at the time the
committee held hearings on the bill it
was more or less of a study bill. We
had that in mind when we reported the
bill. I think the committee was in
agreement, including, as I remember,
even my good friend from Minnesota.

Mr. HUMPHREY. The original bill
was a mandatory bill, and the serum
companies did not testify.

Mr. ELLENDER. I believe it was a
study bill. ~

M1. HUMPHREY. It was a manda-
tory bill That is why the Department
objected to it.

Mr. ELLENDER. Of Course at that
time we had not known methods of
slaughter which we proved deﬁnitely
humane. That is the objection now, so
faras the Department is concerned.

There is a very...
substantial division in the Department ’“‘

The business with ‘

  

m.




”*=¥*1loeo-_".

Mr. HUMPHREY. The Hormel Co. in
Austin, Minn., one of the largest meat-
packing companies, thinks it has known
methods. By the way, the proﬁt per-
"centage of that company is better than
the proﬁt percentage of some of the com-

panies which do not think they have

known methods. The company has . a
pretty good operation, as a matter of fact.
Mr. ELLENDER. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent to have printed in
the RECORD at this point a full explana-
tion of the Senate version of the bill.

There being no objection, the state—-

ment was ordered to be printed-in the
. RECORD, as folloWs:

' EXPLANATION OF H. R. 8308

This bill is designed to bring about the use

of humane methods in all livestock and.

poultry slaughter operations in the United
States.» With the committee amendment to
its text, it provides for:

First, research to develop humane meth-
ods;

Second, promotion of the use of such
methods; and

Third, submission to Congress within 2
years of a complete legislative proposal re-

quiring adoption by slaughterers of such'

.methods. It would be administered by the

Secretary of Agriculture, who would have the '

assistance of an advisory committee drawn
from groups interested in the humane move-
ment, livestock production, ritualistic, and
other slaughter operations,
bandry, and veterinary medicine.

The committee held hearings on this mat-
ter both this year and in 1956, when S. 1636
was reperted out and. passed by the Senate,
but not by the House. All witnesses have fa-

vored the adoption of improvements in the ,

humane handling and slaughtering of food
animals. There were, however, differences .of
opinion as to Whether it was feasible and de—
sirable to specify acceptable methods at this
time and make their use compulsory to a
limited extent.‘

As passed by the House, the bill would have,
"prohibited purchases by the United States
after December 31, 1959, of liVestock products
[produced or processed by slaughterers using
other than humane methods. The hearings
brought out a number of problems with re-
spect to this proposal, the primary problem
being a lack of scientiﬁc information as to

" what methods are, actually humane. The
- committee amendment isintended to provide
for the research necessary to provide such in:-
formation so that within 2 years the Secre—
tary should be able to advise slaughterers as
to what methods are humane and it should
be possible'to enact effective legislation to
require the adoption of those methods by
any slaughterers who have not already
adopted them within that period. ’

The bill would require additional Federal
expenditure, estimated at $250,000 per year
for the ﬁrst 2‘ years. Expenditures there-
after_\ would depend largely on the action
Congress might take on the legislative pro-
posal required to be submitted to it at that
time.

‘ Mr. LAUSCHE. Mr. President, will
the Senator yield?

Mr.
Senator from Ohio.

Mr. LAUSCHE. Am I correct in my
, undeistanding that the bill as reported
by the committee provides the Secretary
of Agiiculture with authority to con-
, duct, within a period of 2 years, a study
of humane methods of slaughter?
Mr. ELLENDER. The Senator is cor-
rect. ‘
. Mr. LAUSCHE. The bill would, direct
the Secretary to do certain things. At

‘\

animal hus- ,

ELLENDER. I yield to the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —- SENATE

the end of 2 years the Secretary would be
required to submit what is supposed to
be a proposal which would bring into
effect humane slaughter of animals.
That is, I believe, what is provided in the
committee bill. "

Will either the Senator from Loui-

siana or the Senator from Minnesota tell -

Ame what the amendment of the Senator
from Minnesota provides?

Mr. ELLENDER. In fact, there is no
amendment from the Senator from
Minnesota before the Senate as yet.
The question before us is on agreeing to
the amendment the committee submitted
to the bill, to strike out the House lan-
guage. In my judgment, the House
language should be stricken.

Mr. LAUSCHE. What does the lan-
guage of the bill as passed by the House
provide?

Mr. ELLENDER. The House version
attempts to deﬁne humane slaughter-
ing. For instance, if the Senator will

., tu1n to section 2, on page 2, beginning at

line 4, he will ﬁnd this provision:

No method of slaughtering or handling in
connection with slaughtering shall be
deemed to comply with the public policy of
the United States unless it is humane.
Either of the following two methods of
slaughtering and handling are hereby found
to be humane:

We have no direct evidence from the,

Department as to this matter; The De-
partment has none. That“ is what the
1 ecord shows.

I shall later read from a letter written

by Secretary Benson, dated today, which

suggests that the senate version of the
bill providing for. a study should be
passed.

Mr. LAUSCHE. Was the action of the
committee based on the idea that there
was not adequate information concern—
ing humane methods of slaughter? Is
that the reason why the comimttee sug-
gested that the study be made?

Mr. ELLE :NDER. The Senator is cor-
rec .

may kill cattle?
Mr. ELLENDER. But not sheep.
Mr. LAUSCHE. But not sheep.
Mr. ELLENDER. It may stun cattle,
but not hogs.
Mr. LAUSCHE.

If the asphyxiation
method is used, the quantity of gas
needed to kill a large animal might have
a contaminating effect upon the edi-
bility of smaller animals.

Mr. ELLENDER. That problem is
posed by such a method. I do not know
what the Hormel method is. It is pos—
sible the Hormel Co. may put all pigs
of the same size and weight in a tunnel
and apply gas. However, when we con-
sider the larger concerns which buy hogs
on the market, I do not suppose that
process could be followed. It would be
very expensive to have to weigh each
hog and put the same size‘hogs in the
same tunnel before applying the gas.
Such subjects must be studied by the
Department. A number of Department
of Agriculture Scientists testiﬁed before
the committee to lay bare the facts.
No study has ever been made on this
subject. However, it is felt a study Can
be made and that at the end of.2 years

July 29 ,_ A

the Depa1tment will be in a position to -
come before us to recommend methods >
for the slaughter of animals which would
be humane and which would be work-
able.

Mr. LAUSCHE. If I may ask a ques-
tion on another subject, the orthodox
branch- of the Jewish faith has been in
contact with me rather substantially ex—
pressing disapproval of the House 'ver-
sion of the bill. Will the Senator from
Louisiana repeat the conclusions he
reached from the testimony which was
given concerning the adequacy of * the
protection afforded to the orthodox
branch of the Jewish faith?

Mr. ELLENDER. The orthodox
branch of the Jewish religion takes the
position that the bill does not protect
them at all. I want to be perfectly frank
in saying to the Senator that, according
to my information, they do not kndw of
any language which could be added to
the bill which, would give them protec--
tion.

Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, will-
the Senator yield?

Mr. ELLENDER. Iyield.

Mr. HUMPHREY. .I hope the distin—
guished Senator from Ohio will read the
language in section 6 of the bill as
passed by the House of Representatives.
That is the language of the amendment
which the Senator from Minnesota would
offer if the parliamentary situation
permitted...

As the Senator from Louisiana said,
we shall have to vote on the language
proposed by the Senate committee ﬁrst.
If the committee amendment is not
agreed to, we will then consider the
language of the bill as passed by the
House, the original bill. This is the
language: -

Nothing in this act shall be construed'to
prohibit, abridge, or in any way hinder the
religious freedom of any person or group to
slaughter and prepare for the slaughter of
livestock in conformity with the practices

. and requirements of his religion.

Mr. LAUSCHE. The blow method “

I must say that that is as exclusive a?

. proviso as it is possible to draft.

Mr. LAUSCHE. I heard the statement
of the Senator from Minnesota that their
fear is founded upon the experience of
the past, that interference with slaugh-
ter, although intended to make them
exempt, eventually was used as an op-
pression of their religion.

Mr. HUMPHREY. The point is-—-and
I can well understand it—that in certain
areas of Europe where there was evidence
of a practice of vicious antisemitism,
some of the strong anti-Semites were
also the proponents of humane slaugh— -
tering legislation in their respective
assemblies or monarchical councils-be~
cause many of the countries did not have
democratic forms of government- That
was just another way to attack the
Jewish religion. But those provisions
did not contain such a protection as
there is in this bill. There was no proviso
in the legislation with respect to kosher
slaughtering.

Studies were made in the British
Parliament—and they are a matter of
record, as I shall show later—and testi-
mony of leading experts as to what were
humane methods of~.slaug11ter was pre-

 




'1958

sented to the British House of Commons. I

Such methods were prescribed by the
British House of Commons. So it is not
as though we were venturing into terri-
tory which has never been explored.
Wherever British law applies, there is
the same kind of protection of religious
freedom. Previously I was speaking of
the 1870’s and 1880’s.

Mr. NEUBERGER. Mr. President, will
the Senator yield forgone comment on
the question asked by the distinguished
Senator from Ohio? '

Mr. ELLENDER. I yield.

Mr. NEUBERGER. I wish to make
further comment to support what was
said by the Senator from Minnesota.
Some of the nations of the world which
have the utmost respect for and ﬁdelity
to the great institution of “religious free-
dom also have humane slaughtering
laws For example, Great Britain, where
all of us will agree there is great respect
for the rights of the individual With re-
gard to freedom of worship, freedom of
speech, and other institutions, has had
a humane slaughtering law since 1933,
or for more than 20 years.

Mr. LAUSCHE. Mr. President, will the
Senator yield?

Mr. ELLENDER. I yield.

Mr. LAUSCHE. Does the Senator from
Louisiana have an explanation for the
motives which prompted the House to
make subject to humane slaughtering
only such animals as are sold to the Gov-
ernment, and not those which are sold
to the general public?

Mr. ELLENDER. That is the penalty
attached to the House bill.

Mr. LAUSCHE. What caused the
House to divide the two classes?

Mr. ELLENDER. I do not know. " I
asked Mr. POAGE of Texas, who is the au-
thor of the, House bill, the direct ques-
tion. I said, “I believe in humane
slaughtering as much as you‘do, Mr.
POAGE. If we should attach penalties to
this bill, would you be for it?”

The answer was “no.”

Mr.
which is provided is that if humane
methods are‘not used, as deﬁned in the
House bill, the slaughterers shall be pro-

hibited from selling ' to the Federal

Government.

Mr. ELLENDER. The Senator is cor-
rect.

Mr. LAUSCHE. What about the right
to sell to the public? '

Mr. ELLENDER. There is no inhi—
bition in that connection.

Mr. LAUSCHE. How many slaugh-
terers sell mainly to the public?

Mr. ELLENDER. All of them—some

" three-thousand-four—hundred-odd.

Mr. LAUSC’HE. Where did the Sen-
ator get his ﬁgure indicating that 3,000
slaughterhouses would be exempt from
thesbill?

Mr; ELLENDER. From the testimony
before the Senate Committee on Agri—
culture and Forestry. As I recall,- only
about 242 slaughterhouses sell to the
Gover.nment

I also wish to make the point that the
evidence showed that those 242 slaugh-
terhouses prepare for the markets about
91'or 92 percent of all the meat sold
, in the United States.

.duced in the 84th Congress.

LAUSCHE. The only sanction

Mr. LAUSCHE. Does the Senator
from Minnesota have an explanation as
to why the two classes were separated?

Mr. HUMPHREY. I have. In" my
presentation, which I hope the Senator
will be present to hear, I shall show that
2 years ago, when the junior Senator
from Minnesota introduced a humane
slaughtering bill which would have pro-
vided for a 5-year time lag from the
date the bill was passed until it became

mandatory, during which 5 years the -,

Department of Agriculture would pre-
pare the way for the application of hu-
mane slaughtering practices, and which
would have given the secretary a pro-
viso under which he could'exempt cer-
tain ﬁrms if ‘it see-med that ,there was
ecdnomic hardship, the Department of
Agriculture objected to it.‘ It refused
to accept the, bill. It said it did not
need it. Furthermore, representatives.
of the Department said that they were
against the mandatory provisions, ,

.So, in the 85th Congress, when’ the
bills were reintroduced, I reintroduced
the very same bill which I had mu 0-
The same
thing was done in the House, but it was
determined in committee that this
seemed to be going too far. Again the
Department of Agriculture said, “We do
not need mandatory legislation. Do not
provide any penalties.” There were ﬁnes
and heavy penalties in the Humphrey
bill.

A compromise was arrived at, on the
basis that the Federal Government has
the right to prescribe standards for goods
and commodities it purchases. The Fed-
eral Government requires higher stand-
ards for the automobile tires it buys for
postal trucks than are applicable to the
tires which the Senator might buy for a
farm truck. But if one is to do business

with the Federal Government, he must,

comply with. the standards it prescribes.
All the bill provides is that when the Fed-
eral Government buys meat products, it
will buy only products processed in a

certain way. ‘The Federal Government

buys biologicals, and a great many types
of equipment, all of which must meet
certainstandards. If Senators do not
believe it, let them take a look at the
veterans’ hospitals, as compared ~~with
the 01 dinary community hospital. Some
of the veteians’ hospitals will last a
thousand yeais. ‘ '

Mr. ELLENDER. A similar situation
arose in connectionvwith butter. The
butter interests forced the Army and
Navy to buy nothing but butter, and ex-
clude oleomargarine. I know that the
Federal GoVernment can do such things.
The point I am 'making is that if inhu-
mane slaughtering is to be stopped, we
should enact a bill which will be effec—
tive enough to stop it.

I wish to make this point with my good,

f1iend fiom Ohio: The Department is
asked to do something with. respect to
which it has no facts. That is what
Secretary Benson says, and that is what
the evidence shows.
the House version of the bill provides as
follows: '

(a) in the case of cattle, ca1,ves horses,
mules, sheep, swine, and other livestock,
all animals are rendered insensible to pain

thrown, cast, or cut; or

Those are] the prescribed methods, and
the Department of Agriculture says, “We '
do not know whether those methods are
humane or not. We have never tried
them.” . , '

Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, will
the Senator yield?

Mr. ELLENDER. I yield. *-

Mr. HUMPHREY. Is the Senator
aware . of the fact that Dr. Clarkson
testiﬁed in May 1956 that the Depart-
ment of Agriculture had all the author-

.ity it needed to make studies, and that

the Department of Agriculture was mak-
ing studies?” "Is thefSenator aware of
the fact that Dr. Clarkson testiﬁed as ,
to the humane practices of certain pack-
ing plants? Is the Senator aware of the '
fact that on page 4 of the bill as passed
by the House—which is the proposal
supported by the Senator from Minne-
sota—under subsections (a) and (b) of
section 4, continuation of. study is not
only authorized but directed?

Moreover, the Secretary may designate
other forms of humane slaughter. The
authority is permissive. 'He is given all
, The reason for
the proviso the Senator from Louisiana
has read, in section 2, is that it is com-
monly‘agreed that the method of slaugh-
tering which is prescribed in subsection
(a) and subsection (b) of section 2 is a
humane method. That is agreed.

Mr. ELLENDER. The evidence is very
conﬂicting on that point.

Mr. HUMPHREY. The evidence is
conﬂicting as to what may be the 1esults
of some of the practices.

M1. ELLENDER. The Senator knows
that a single blow may stun a calf but
not a steer. That is in the evidence.
Yet the same method is used.

Mr. HUMPHREY. The Seeietary is
permitted, as section 4\provides, to make
such designation. I will read the lan—
guage.

Mr. ELLENDER. Oh, yes; but he must
do it aftei research.

Mr. HUMPHREY.
to wait a moment. -

M1. ELLENDER. He must do it after
lesearch.

M1. HUMPHREY. Section 4 auth01-
izes the Sec1etary “on 01 before June 30,
1958, and at such times thereafter as he
deems advisable, to designate methods
of slaughter and of handling in connec—
tion with slaughter which, with respect
to each species of livestock, conform to
the policy stated herein. If he deems it
more effective,-the Secretary may make
any such designation by designating
methods which are not in conformity
with such policy.”

The Secretary can do whatever his
researchers and technicians prescribe as
being accepted methods. The bill is very
complete.

Mr. ELLENDER. That shows that
the bill which has been reported by the
is the one that
should be passed. It strikes me we
should not enact such provisions which
would direct the Secretary of Agriculture
to select specific methods of slaughtere-

I ask the Senator

ing when he has had no opportunity to

.1 have studies made on the various

methods. '

I repeat what I said a while ago, that

‘. the good ladies who have been conduct-
ing a campaign throughout the country
to bring about humane slaug tering are
«doing a, great deal of good. hey will be

represented on the commission which is ~

provided for in the Senate bill. The
studies can be made within -2 years. I
know that much goodwill result. We
have the assurance that the methods
will be studied. I have no doubt. in my
mind that within 2 years we will have
effective methods of humane slaughter-
ing which will be applicable and accept-
able to all segments ‘of the meat in-
dustry. We will be able to make these
methods apply to everyone in the meat-
' packing industry, and we will be able
to provide penalties in the act for non-
compliance. That is what all of us

’ .. want.

I am sure that many Senators have
received letters from persons in favor of
humane slaughtering, which say that
they have found bacon for instance, to
be distasteful after reading statements
- issued by the humane societies.

I wish to say to my good friends, who
are advocating humane methods, that
the House bill will not cure that situa-
tion. All citizen's, . all Senators, all
Members of the House will still be eat-
ing the same kind of bacon they are
eating now if the House bill is enacted.

Mr. SYMINGTON. Mr. President,
will the Senator yield? ,

Mr.,ELLENDER. I yield.

Mr. SYMINGTON. ‘ The distinguished

chairman has served on the committee

- for many years.“ Could he tell the Sen-
ate how long a humane slaughter bill
1 has been before the committee? "

Mr. ELLENDER. It has been before

the committee ever since 1956. The Sen- —

ate passed a hMane slaughter study
bill without opposition in 1956, and sent
it to the House. Ho-,wever the House
pigeonholed the bill.

Mr. SYMINGTON. The Department
of Agiiculture is against a humane
slaughter bill, is it ?r

Mr. HUMPHREY. It is in favor of
humane slaughter practices, but against
the bill.

Mr. SYMINGTON. There is the prob-
lem. I believe it is the prerogative of
Congress to decide whether there should
be a humane slaughter bill, not the
people currently in the Department of
Agriculture.

Mr. ELLENDER. I am as much in
favor of a hMane slaughte1 bill as is
anyone else, but I am in favor of an ef-
fective bill. That is what I am striving
for. If thebill which was passed in
1956 had beer? adopted by the House, we
probably would be in a position to pass
angeffective humane slaughter bill today.

_ I believe the Senator from Minnesota
,was chairman of a subcommittee which
held hearings on 'such a bill, and I be-
lieve the subcommittee was appointed

.for that purpose. I must confess that
I did not hear the testimony. However,
I conducted hearings during the present

. Congress on the pending bill. I am per-

‘ 1‘4sonally of the opinion that we will be

much better off if an effective study bill
is passed. This will lead to effective
methods of humane slaughter as out-

lined by the Department of Agricul- ‘

ture and will be much preferable to pas-
sage of an ineffective bill.

Mr. SYMINGTON. I am surethe Sen-
ator is in favor of a humane slaughter
bill just as much as I am; Knowing the

Senator, I am sure he would always be,

for such a measure. It seems to me the
problem now is, when are we going to
get a bill? We are not sure we will get
it after a study has been made. What
worries me the worst is the religious as-
pect of the bill.

Mr. McNAMARA. I should like to ask
the Senator from Minnesota a question,
if I may. 7

Mr. ELLENDER. I yield fer that pur-
pose.

Mr. MéNAMARA. I was quite im-
pressed by the amendment the Senator

proposes to offer in connection with,

slaughtering in Compliance with re-
ligious ritualistic practices. I should
like toask the Senator a question on that
point. _

Would the Senator’s amendment
exempt such ritualistic slaughtering
from any inspections by the Federal
Government? Would such slaughte1ing
be totally exempt?

Mr. HUMPHREY. That. is correct.
It would be totally unaffected. Further-
more, no Federal purchases are made of
kosher meat. The testimony reveals
that fact.

Mr. MCNAMARA. The Federal Gov-
ernment would not be able to purchase
the meat because it had not been fed-
erally inspected. ‘

Mr. HUMPHREY. Testimony shows
the Government does not purchase
Kosher meat.

M1. McNAMARA. Such slaughtering
is totally exempt?

Mr. HUMPHREY. That. is correct.

Mi McNAMARA. Does the
from Louisiana agree with that state-
ment?

Mr. HUMPHREY The testimony be-
fore the committee is that there are no
Federal purchases of kosher meat made.
The end product of ritualistic slaugh-
ter would not be purchased by the Fed-
eral Government. My amendment pro-
vides, in the language of the House bill:

Nothing in this act shall be construed to
prohibit, abridge, or in any way hinder the
religious freedom of any person or group to
slaughter and prepare for the slaughter of
livestock in conformity with the practices
and requirements of his religion.

‘ That provides complete exemption so
far as religious practices are concerned.
According to the testimony there have
been no purchases by the Federal Gov—
ernment of koshe1" products. _
Mr. McNAMARA. However, the lan—
guage does not spell out the prohibition
of inspections or inspectors geing into
a plant. Is it to be assumed, and is it
,to be a part of the legislative history,

that inspectors would have no business.

going into such plants?

Mr. HUMPHREY. Such, plants are
exempt, and therefore are not subject to
inspection under the regulations. which
are prescribed relating to slaughter.

1'
I

enator '

July- 29,
Mr. McNAMARA. The question in 1‘ ..

. my mind is: Should we spell it out in the

bill? ' .1
Mr. HUMPHREY. I do not think so, .
since there is listed, ﬁrst, the humane .
slaughtering practice, which, as the lan-
guage reads, is “in accordance with the
ritual requirements of the Jewish faith
or any other religious faith.”

That is in the bill in two places, ﬁrst
where it is listed afﬁrmatively as a hu-
mane practice; and second, where reli-
gious practices are exempt.

So I think there is no need for intru-
sion by the Federal Government as there
has been, I may say, in the past.

Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, will the
Senator yield? _.

Mr. ELLENDER. " I yield. '
Mr. YOUNG. I should like to ask the
Senator from Minnesota: Is the kosher
practice of slaughtering any more hu-
mane than the method pursued in the

packing plants of the United States?

Mr. HUMPHREY. Yes, I think deﬁ-
nitely, it is I think there is a body 01“
testimony which is incontrovertibly to
the effect that it is. In fact, substantial
medical surveys and studies have been
made, which indicate that it is.

Mr. YOUNG. Is the Senator from
Minnesota familiar with the koshe1
method of slaughtering?

Mr. HUMPHREY. Very much so.

Mr. YOUNG. In which the animal is
hung by a back leg, and with a shoulder
resting on the ground, while the throat
is slit, without any effort being made
to render the animal unconscious?

Mr. HUMPHREY. I am not a physi-
cian or a veterinarian; but testimony by
doctors and veterinarians before the
subcommittee,‘when it was my privilege
to serve as the subcommittee chairman,
was that the result of a study which had
been made clearly established the ritual- 1
istic practice as being one which met
the requirements of humane slaughter.

Mr. YOUNG. I am not condemning
the practice; but I think anyone who a
has visited a kosher packing plant must
know that What I am saying is true:
That the animal is hung by a back leg,
with its shouldei on the g1ound, while
its throat is Slit. That is not much dif-
ferent fiom any other method.

Mr. HUMPHREY. Oh, there is a con-
siderable diﬁerence.

Mr. YOUNG. I do not think we
should impose this réquirement on the
Jewish people. We are placing them in
a position of being singled out for‘ridi-
cule or undeserved criticism.

Mr. HUMPHREY. There was no need
for raising the question except that op—
position to the bill from outside Congress
determined to do so. Frankly, there is
'no intention on the part of the bill or
of an' vone who sponsored the bill to in-
terfere with the ritualistic or religious“
practices of any group. The bill does ,
not apply to any particular religion.

Oei tain emconomic sources outside the
Government of the United States, which
have decided to resist the proposal, have
undertaken to recruit what I consider
to be a good deal of emotional suppmt,
which is unfortunate—very unfortunate.

Mr. YOUNG. I think most of the
emotional support for the 'bill has been

 




. \
\
1958

created by persons who have no knowl-
‘ edge of how animals are slaughtered in
packing plants. .

Mr. HUMPHREY. I am very familiar
with packing plants. Minnesota has
about as many as does any other State
in the Union. We have some good ones.
I have visited them. I am thoroughly
familiar with them and have been from
the time I was 16 years of age until this
particular hour. So I am not a novice
in this subject. A

Mr. YOUNG; I do not have reference
to the Senator from Minnesota. ~

Mr. HUMPHREY. No; but I wanted
to make the RECORD quite clear. I have
also seen a humane-slaughtering pack-
ing. plant, about which I shall speak
later. The difference between it and
other types of packing plants is quite
phenomenal.

One of the ﬁnest packing plants 1n the ,

United States is in Minnesota and is

operated by Hormel. This is not a small-

plant; it is a large one. It is comprised
of several plants. It does very ﬁne work.

I expect to show that the present
practice of slaughtering is one reason

why the packing industry has ﬁnancial

troubles. The packing industry is one
of the most antiquated, outmoded indus-
tries in the United States. When it
starts to modernize, it will make money,
be able to pay its employees higher wages,
and produce better quality food.

Mr. YOUNG. I think the Senator is
familiar with the way in which turkeys
are slaughtered. A turkey is hung up
by a leg, and a knife is stuck into the
brain of the turkeyrand the jugular veins
cut. A turkey is much more sensitive
than a hog. Why does not the bill apply
to turkeys? ‘

Mr. HUMPHREY. It Can, under sec-
tion 4, if the Secretary of Agriculture
so designates. ’

Mr. YOUNG. Why does not the bill
spell that out?

. Mr. HUMPHREY. No; we do not go

that far. This is a peculiar situation.
The proponents ofiiwhat I call an effec-
tive bill are accused, on the one hand, of
going too far, and, on the other hand, of
not going far enough. The bill is a mild
and modest beginning in the ﬁeld of
humane slaughter.

Mr. YOUNG. Why is the Senator op-
posed to a study, as the committee bill
provides?

Mr. HUMPHREY. Because the Gov-
ernment has the right to impose stand-

ards; and when the Department Of, Ag-'

riculture was asked to support such a bill
2 years ago, which I Shall read page by
page, we allowed them 5 years, but they
said, no, they had all the authority they
needed. Dr. Clarkson said, in effect, “We
have been studying this question for 26
"years. We do not need any more study.”

Mr. YOUNG. If the bill were passed
today and became law Within 2 months,
we would not be able to supply American
meat to our Armed Forces in Lebanon or
in many other places Even the Hormel
plant in Minnesota would not meet the
requirements for meat.

Mr. HUMPHREY. Why not?

Mr YOUNG. It simply could not meet
the requirements.

“No. 128—4.-

CONGRESSIONAL IRECORD — SENATE

Mr. HUMPHREY. It surely could.

Mr. ELLENDER. Mr. President, at
this time I should like to conclude my
statement by pointing out again the
problems which will be involved if the
Senate should adopt the House bill.

Some of the basic problems inherent in
the House bill, for which none of the
witnesses was able to afford a solution,
were as follows:

First. The House bill provided for the
designation of humane methods by the
Secretary of Agriculture. , The Depart-
ment of Agriculture advised‘the commit-

tee—and this is in the testimony—that

it had insufﬁcient scientiﬁc information
to make such a determination at this
time. ,

Second. The House bill attempted to
specify two methods which should be
considered humane; but it is not possible
to point to any known methods of han-
dling and slaughter and to state with as-
surance that they come within the House
provisions.

Thus, the ﬁrst method requires that
“all’ animals are rendered insensible to
pain \by a Single blow or gunshot or an
electrical, chemical, or other means that
is rapid and effective.”

No method of rendering all animals
insensible with a single blow or gunshot
is known; although the knocking ham-
mer, which many 'witnesses regarded as
inhumane, and the captive-bolt pistol
and humane animal stunner, which
many witnesses regarded as humane, will
all, to varying degrees, render many
animals insensible with a single blow.

Electrical stunning may make meat
inspection diﬁicult, and there has been
little experimentation with it in this

country. The testimony is replete to_

that effect. Therevis considerable ques-
tion whether electrical or chemical

means could be used on the various spe«

cies or on animals of varying weights in
an effective, hMane manner. All of
this was pointed out before in detail.

' Chemical asphyxiation is now in use
by the Hormel Packing Co., for hogs of
fairly unifOrm weight. It [is not used
for other animals.

Finally, the phrase “other means that
are rapid and effective” is too broad and
indeﬁnite a term to form the basis for
a criminal penalty. Certainly, it would
appear to cover the knocking hammer,
which many witnesses believe would be
prohibited by the proposed legislation, so
far as Government suppliers are con-
cerned.

Mr. President, it appears that the in-
tent of this legislation is ideal, but the
lack of scientiﬁc knowledge is so com-
plete that the House bill has been written
in the vaguest of terms. Let us see what
it provides: First, the supplier must
certify to the Government that another
person, the slaughterer, does not in any
of its plants handle or slaughter, any
animal inhumanely. Further, he must
certify that no afﬁliate of such slaugh-
terer handles or slaughters any animal
inhumanely in any of its plants. How
can the supplier possibly know the truth
of what he is asked to certify? How
cOuld even the slaughterer, himself: have
such information? At the very moment

14063
the certiﬁcate is being executed, an af;

ﬁliate, possibly even in a foreign land,
may be mistreating some animal that is

' trying to avoid the blow from the knock-

ing hammer- or the captive-bolt pistol.
Second, even if the supplier could know
what is happening in every plant of every
afﬁliate of the slaughterer, how can he
know that what is happening is humane?
Well the bill says that the Secretary, will

’tell him. But the Secretary says he does -

not know. ' So how can such a certiﬁcate

._ be executed? Third, the House, too, was -:~

advised that the Secretary did not know,
so they attempted to remedy that defect.
They said in section 2 (a) that any
method by which all animals are ren-
dered insensible by a sing blow is hu—
mane. But all witnesses a ee that no
method will render all animals insensible
withwa single blow. So the person who
executes this certiﬁcate is faced with
the question as to what Congress did
mean, since it must have had some in-
tention in the matter. The entire bill is
vague and necessarily so, because the
answers simply are not known. Many
other instances could be given, but these
examples typify the provisions of which '
the bill consists. This is why the com-‘
mittee provided for further study. - 1

The other method of slaughtering
speciﬁed by the House bill as being hu-
mane was that which meets the require-
ments of any religious faith. The debate
on this matter in the House, the letters
from the ,Department of Agriculture
dated April 15, and May 13, and the
testimony of witness after witness at the
hearings all indicate that this provision
did not succeed in meeting the problem
to which it was directed. '

Third. Apparently the only method 7

. of slaughtering hogs which met the ap—

proval of many of the witnesses Was that
by carbon dioxide asphyxiation. This

method appears to have many advan-

tages, and appears tomeet the standards
of many persons as to humaneness. .
However, there are also many questions'

‘ as to its use which have not yet been ‘ ‘-

answered. Its installation is costly and-
may be impossible in many plants.

Fourth. The House bill cove-rs only

.Government suppliers of meat and does

not apply to poultry. When humane
methods are established, they should. be
generally applicable to all meat products.
Fifth. By limiting Government pur-
chases to packers using only humane
methods, the bill as passed by the House
would eliminate bidders, raise procure-
ment Costs, and in some cases result in
failures of supply for troop feeding and
other purposes, particularly overseas.
Sixth. Surplus removal programs, such
as those conducted under section 32,
would be seriously impaired. ‘
Seventh. The bill as passed by the
House could interfere with the produc-
tion of adequate and safe supplies of
serums. and vaccines necessary to the
treatment of diseases in animals and hu-
man beings.
Mr. President, as I have stated, today
I have received from the Secretary of.
Agriculture, Mr. Benson, the following
letter:

7 DEAR SENATOR ELLENDER: I am writing to
urge your support of H. R. 8308, an act “to
establish the use of humane methods of
slaughter of livestock'as a policy of the United
States, and for other purposes,” as reported
by the Senate Committee on Agriculture and
Forestry (Rept. N0. 1734) on June 18, 1958.

That is the bill I have been disChssing.
\I read further from the letter:
The strongest personal convictions favor

adoption of the bestand surest way to bring .

real and lasting improvement in this ﬁeld.
To do this requires the evaluation of methods
with scientiﬁc knowledge to assure that the
measures adopted are humane. When this is
done, the industry and the State and local
jurisdictions, who ‘will undoubtedly follow
the Federal lead, can move forward with con-

ﬁdence that each step taken is a real improve— -

ment.

The Senate committee bill provides for just
such an approach. The Department is given
2 years within which it must submit to the
Congress a complete legislative proposal set-
ting out those methodsof slaughter found
to be humane and requiring their adoption
by slaughterers. This would provide the
Congress with a fully objective proposal sub—
stantiated by fact and scientiﬁc judgment
on which constructive compulsory legislation

could be based. Surely the- record of diver-1

gence of views thathas attended the con-
sideration of this legislationbommends this
orderly approach adopted by the committee.

On the other hand, the bill as it passed
the House and which is contained in the
amendment now proposed by Senator HUM-
PHREY, would place upon the Department
the burden of making immediate determina-
tions without adequate factual background
in order that industry may have time to
comply by December 31, 1959. Even then
industry could comply or not, according to
whether the individual concern considered
sales to the Federal Government to be proﬁt-
able. We believe the result would be a hodge-
podge of actions taken on insecure factual
background with doubtful~improvement in
the humanity‘of slaughter practices and an
almost certain costly interference with the
Federal procurement of meat and meat
products.

A similar letter is being sent to Senator
JOHNSON the majority leader, and to Senator
KNOWLAND the minority leader.

‘ Sincerely yours, A
‘ E. T. BENSON,
Secretary.

D..-

Mr. President, I have nothing further
to say. I hope the Senate will approve
the committee amendments.

Mr. HUMPHREY. ' Mr. President, ﬁrst
of all, I Wish to thank the Senator from
Louisiana [Mn ELLENDER] for his custo—
mary courtesy "in yielding to me and
other Senators during his presentation
of the bill reported, by the Committee
on Agriculture and. Forestry. I really
' believe that that informal debate, which
was permitted by courtesy of the Senator
from Louisiana, has been helpful,..and
at least establishes the understanding of
the respective Senators concerning the
bill reported by the Senate committee, as
compared to the bill which has been
passed by the House of Representatives.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to. have printed at this point in the
1 RECORD the bill as passed by the House

' of Representatives. The language of
_ that bill is incorporated in the amend-
ment which I—'-on behalf of myself and

‘ CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ‘1— SENATE

other Senators—placed before the Sen—
ate a few days ago. So I wish to have
that language printed at this point .in
the RECORD, so all Senators can see the
difference between the language of the
bill as passed by the House and the lan-
guage adopted by the Senate Committee
on Agriculture and Forestry.

There being no objection, the bill (H.
R. 8308), as passed by the House of Rep-
resentatives on February 4, 1958, was
ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
as follows:

Be it enacted, etc., That the Congress ﬁnds
that the use of humane methods in the
slaughter of livestock prevents needless suf-
fering; results in safer and better working
conditions for persons engaged in the slaugh-
tering industry; brings about improvement
of products and econdmies ‘in slaughtering
operations; and produces other beneﬁts for
producers, processors, and consumers which
tend to expedite an orderly ﬂow of livestock
and livestock products in interstate and for-
eign commerce. It is, therefore, declared to
be the policy of the United States that the
slaughtering of livestock and the handling of
livestock in connection with slaughter shall
be carried out only by humane methods.

SEC. 2. Nomethod of slaughtering or han-
dling in connection with slaughtering shall
be deemed to- cdmply with the public policy
of the United States unless it is humane.
Either of "the following two methods of
slaughtering and handling are hereby found
to be humane:

(a) In the case of cattle, calves, horses,
mules, sheep, swine, and other livestock, all
animals are rendered insensible to pain by a
single blow or gunshot or an electrical,
chemical, or other means that is rapid and
effective, before being shackled, hoisted,
thrown, cast, or cut; or

(b) By slaughtering in accordance with
the ritual requirements of the Jewish faith
or any other religious faith that prescribes a
method of slaughter whereby the animal
suffers loss of consciousness by anemia of

the brain caused by the simultaneous and in-

stantaneous severance of the carotid arteries
with a sharp instrument.

SEC. 3. The public policy declared herein
shall be taken into consideration by all
agencies of the Federal Government in con-
nection with all procurement and price-sup-
port programs and operations, and after De-
cember 31, 1959, no agency or instrumen-
tality of the United States shall contract

‘ for or procure any livestock products pro-

duced or processed by any slaughterer or
processor which in any of its plants or in
any plants of any slaughterer or processor
with which it is afﬁliated slaughters or han-
dies in connection with slaughter livestock
by any methods other than methods desig-
nated and approved by the Secretary of Agri-
culture (hereinafter referred to as the Sec-
retary) pursuant to section 4 hereof: Pro-
vided, That during the period of any nation-
al emergency declared by the President or
the Congress, the limitations on procurement
required by this section may be modiﬁed by
the President to the extent determined by
him to be necessary to meet essential pro-
curement needs during 'such emergency.
For the purposes of this section a slaugh—
terer or processor shall be deemed to be af»
ﬁliated with another slaughterer or proc-
essor if it controls, is controlled by, or is un-
der common control with, such other slaugh-
terer or processor. After December 31, 1959,
each supplier from which any livestock prod-
ucts are procured by any agency of the Fed-
eral Government shall be required by such
agency to make such statement of eligibility
under this section to supply such livestock
products as, if false, will subject the maker
thereof to prosecution, title 18, United States
Code, section 287.

July 29

SEC. 4. In furtheranCe of the policy ex-
pressed herein the Secretary is authorized
and directed——

(a) To conduct, assist, and foster research,
investigation, and experimentation to de-
velop and determine methods of slaughter
and the handling of livestock in connection
with slaughter which are practicable with
reference to th speed and scope of slaughter-
ing operations and humane with reference to
other existing methods and then current sci-
entiﬁc knowledge,

(b) On or before June 30,1958, and at such
times thereafter as he deems advisable, to
designate methods of slaughter and of han- .
dling in connection with slaughter which,-
with respect to each species of livestock,
conform to the policy stated herein. If he
deems‘it more effective, the Secretary may
make any such designation by designating
methods which are not in conformity
with such policy. Designations by the
Secretary subsequent to July 1, 1959, shall
become effective for purposes of section 3
hereof 180 days after the publication in the
Federal Register;

(c) To provide suitable means of identify»-
ing the carcasses of animals inspected and
passed under the Meat Inspection Act (21
U. S. C. 71 and the following) that have been
slaughtered in accordance with the public
‘policy declared herein.

SEC. 5. To assist in implementing the pro-
visions of section 4, the Secretary is author-
ized to establish an advisory committee.
The functions of the Advisory Committee

. shall be to consult with the Secretary and

other appropriate ofﬁcials of the Department
of Agriculture and to make recommenda»
tions relative to (a) the research authorized
in section 4; (b) obtaining the cooperation
of the public, producers, farm organizations,
industry groups, humane associations, and
Federal and State agencies in the further-
ance of such research and the adoption of
improved methods, and (c) the designations
required by section 4. The Committee shall
be composed of 12 members, of whom I shall
be an ofﬁcer or employee of the Department
of Agriculture designated by the Secretary
(who shall serve as chairman); 2 shall be
representatives of national organizations of
slaughterers;1 shall be a representative of
the trade-union movement engaged inpack-

inghouse work; 1 shall be a representative of.

the general public; 2 shall be representatives
of livestock growers; 1 shall be a representa-
tive of the poultry industry; 2 shall be rep-
resentatives of national organizations of the
humane movement; 1 shall be‘ a representa-
tive of a national professional veterinary or-
ganization; and 1 shall be a person familiar
with the requirements of religious faiths
with respect to slaughter. The Department
of Agriculture shall assist the Committee
with such. research personnel and facilities
as the Department can make available.
Committee members other than the chair-
man shall not be deemed to be employees of
the United States and are not entitled to
compensation, but the Secretary is author-
izedto allow their travel expenses and sub-
sistence expenses in connection with their
attendance at regular or specialmeetings of
the Committee. The Committee shall meet
at least once each year and at the call of the
Secretary and shall from time to time sub-
Init to the Secretary such reports and recom—
mendations with respect to new or improved
methods as it believes should be taken into
consideration by him in making the desig—
nations required by section 4 and the Secre—
tary shall make all such reports available to
the public ,

SEC. 6. Nothing in this act shall be con-
strued to prohibit, abridﬂge or in any way
hinder the religious freedom of any person
or group to slaughter and prepare for the
slaughter of livestock in conformity with the
practices and requirements of his religion.

 




CONGRESSIONAL RECORD 4—- SENATE

the title so as to read: “A bill to

"5 pimnote and encourage humane slaughter—7

ing of livestock and poultry."

M1. HUMPHREY. Furthermore, Mr.
President, I wish it to be clearly under-
stood that the text of the bill reported
by the Senate Committee on Agriculture
and Forestry was not approved by all the
membe1s of the committee; instead, in
the committee there was a split vote, as
has been evidenced by the debate in the
Senate today. In fact, in the committee
the vote was rather close. I am not ex-
actly sure, but, as I recall, 5 members of
the committee favored the bill as passed
by the House/of Representatives, and the
other members of the committee—8 or 9;
I_have forgotten whether the full com-
mittee was present—supported the lan-
guage which has been 1eported by the
Senate committee.

Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President will the
Senator from Minnesota yield to me?

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
CHURCH in the chair). Does the Sena,-
tor from Minnesota yield to the Senator
from North Dakota? 1

Mr. I-IUMPHREY. I yield to my good
friend, the Senator from North Dakota.

Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, I appre-
ciate the courtesy of the Senator from
Minnesota, a good friend of mine, too, in
yielding to me.

As one of those who voted, in the com-
mittee, for the substitute bill, I wish to
commend the Senator from Minnesota
for his objective of attaining humane
slaughtering. _

' My reason for voting in the committee
for the study bill is that I believe some-
thing of that sort is necessary before leg-
' islation of this kind is enacted. That be-
lief on my part is an honest one. I
sincerely believe that something desirable
can be accomplished by means of more
humane slaughtering methods; but I do
not think We can achieve that objective
by legislation of the kind proposed by the
House bill. That is why in the committee
I voted for the substitute.

Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, let
me say to my good friend, the Senator
from North Dakota—and there is no
ﬁner friend of the objectives of the bill,
and there is no ﬁner friend of agriculture
generally, than the Senator from North
Dakota; and I will say that again and
again and again, so as to make clear that
this matter is a bipartisan one.

Mr. YOUNG. I thank the Senator
from Minnesota. .

Mr. HUMPHREY. ‘ I want the Sena-
tor from North Dakota to understand
that even the bill as passed by the House
of Representatives provides for two ef-
fective dates. The ﬁrst date—which
must be modiﬁed by the Senate, because
that date already has passed—was June
30, 195.8, the time aftei which the Secre-
ta1y would have been pe1mitted to pro-
. \mulgate rules and regulations.

The second date—-—which I believe to be
'1ather signiﬁcant—is December 31,1959.
That is the date by which each supplie1
of livestock products procured by any

agency of the Federal Government shall"

be required by such agency to make such
a statement of eligibility. '

In other words, provision was made for
a period of a year and one-half before

the proposed statute would become effec-
tive; and that proposal was contained
in both the bill as passed by the House
of Representatives, and the original form
of the bill reported b the Senate Com-
mittee on Agricultur and Forestry. In
other words, the House version of the
bill, if passed this week, and sent to the

President for his signature, and if signed .

by the President on August 1, would not
become effective immediately on August
1. Instead, there would be a period of

, time—and at the appropriate time, if

our effort to have the Senate reject the
language reported by the Senate com-
mittee is successful, I shall submit
amendments to 'provide_ for additional
time—before the bill would become
effective, in terms of the authority of the
Secretary to promulgate rules and regu-
lations. ,I would suggest that that date
be March 1, 1959, because the Secre-
tary must have time in which to prepare
such rules and regulations.
Furthermore, the bill as passed by the
House of Representatives provided for a
time gap, which would be required, as a
matter of sheer common sense, in order
to permit the respective slaughterhouses

to adjust their facilities to the require-.

ments of the proposed legislation. Cer-
tainly, a sufﬁcient period of time should
be provided for.

,. So I call attention to this point, be-
cause it has been argued that, “Under
the provisions .of the studybill, there will
be study over a period of 2 years.” How-‘-
ever, I respectfully suggest that if the
action bill—in other words, the bill which
provides for some Federal standards—sis
enacted, there will be a period of at least
1 year, and perhaps longer, because the
period provided in the bill as passed by
the House was a year and one-half; and
the time between the date when the Sec-
retary issues the rules and regulations
and the date of full compliance will be

a period for more study, and a period.

during which there will be no mandatory
provision.

It is during that period of time that I 7

believe them will be an opportunity to
fulﬁll some of the .legﬁtimate desires" of
some of our colleagues who have felt

‘ there was need for more study.
This point has not been emphasized

ybEfOle, so I believe it only fair that it
be emphasized now, because I believe

. the bill ‘as passed by the other body—

namely, the measure which I hope will
be passed by the Senate—includes what
we call enforcement provisions, namely,

provisions on the basis of Federal stand- .

ards applicable to the purchase of goods
by Federal agencies. In that connection,
those enforcement provisions are to 'be
applied only after a certain period of
time, as follows:

First, the Secretary is to promulgate
rules and regulations, as " of a certain
date.

Second, at a later date the supplieis
are to certify their eligibility under those
rules and regulations. ,

Therefore, there is no rush in terms
of trying to push business ﬁrms beyond
their ability and ﬁnancial capacity to

\make necessary adjustments in produc-

tion facilitiesxto comply with the, bill.

14065

I noted, during the discussion, 1 or
2 points which I feel should be \given a
further word of comment. I said earlier,
in colloquy with the, Senator from Louisi-
ana, that it was a rather strange situa-
tion when, on the one hand, those of us
who have proposed humane slaughtering
practices legislation have been criti-
cized—and I may/Say constructively crit-

icized—because some persons thought we _ ,.

were going too fast and too far with
mandatory legislation. Two years ago
one of the chief criticisms against the
humane slaughtering practices bill
which I introduced was that it contained
provision for penalties, as the testimony
will show. I have before me the testi-
mony which was taken before our sub-
committee in sesSions on May 9 and 10,
1956. I note for the RECORD that at those

sessions testimony started at 10 o’clock

in the morning and continued on until

.midnight for 2 days—in fact, 14 hours a

day.

At that time we were criticized be-
cause we were trying to invoke or im-
pose penalties. Now the argument is
made that, the proposed legislation sup-
ported by the junior Senator from Min—
nesota and others, the measure as
adopted by the House, really does not
provide for any penalties. The only pen-
alty, if one can call it such, is that if a
slaughterhouse wishes to sell to the Fed-
eral Government, it will have to comply
with certain standards imposed by the
bill

I submit one cannot have it both ways.
As I answered the question of, I believe,
the distinguished Senator from Ohio
[Mr. LAUSCHE], the\ House bill which
came to the Senate, and—which was iden-
tical with the bill introdtfdéd by the
junior Senator from Minnesota, is ,

a moderate, modest compromise, W1th~37

provision for voluntary study and very
extensive mandatory provisions. The
bill of 1956 went much further than did
proposal adopted by the House in 1958.
Another point made is that a study bill
is required because the Department of
Agriculture really needs more time to
determine what are humane methods of
slaughter. I would call the attention of ‘

' the Senate to page 5 of the hearings of

May 9, 1956, on the bill before the sub—
committee then functioning, S. 1636, the -
testimony of the Deputy Administrator
of the Agricultural Research Service, Dr.,
M. R. Clarkson, along ._with Dr. A. R.‘ ,
Miller, Chief of the Meat Inspection
Branch of. the Agricultural Research
Service, United States Department of.
Agriculture.

Dr. Clarkson notes in this testimony
that: ,

The act would take effect 5 years after the
date of enactment. The Secretary would be
empowered to exempt any person from com-
pliance for a further reasonable time only
upon the recommendation of the advisory
committee and upon a showing of good
cause.

The same bill provided for exemptions
because of religious practices. Then Mr.
Clarkson said:

There is widespread interest in this legis-
lation. It is important, therefore, that the
Department’s position be clear. We em-
phatically favor humane slaughter by any

 




'“J1414666

method that is found to be practicable and
workable. The Department’s position is
strongly in favor .of the objective of this
bill. But we registered opposition to the
bill on the grounds that mandatory Federal
legislation is not the answer to this prob-
lem.

This is a ﬁeld in which education and co-
operation will bring more satisfactory results
through the stimulus of individual initiative
and imagination which -is so often hampered
by the weight of controls imposed from
Washington.

Then Dr. Clarkson goes on to point
out the amount of research which has
' been under way.
in his testimony, in answer to questions,
that forsome 26 years there has been
research in the matter of handling of
livestock. I quote from page 12 of the
testimony. Dr Clarkson said:

Mr. Chairh1an, I might say that I certainly
agree with you that methods that are both
humane and practical and economic will be
' put into effect.

If they are economically advantageous,
then it needs only to be pointed out.

That really is part of our thesis, that this
process of education and experimentation and
looking into new devices is a constant one.
We know from our relationships—wand if you
will pardon a personal reference, I have been
associated with our meat inspection and
animal—disease-Control activities of the De-
partment for some 26 years—~I have seen a
very decided improvement in the attitudes
"of all who are handling livestock from the
farmer on to the last handler, and I think
that is a result of a higher educational level
in our people generally and a better realiza-
tion of these problems.

Then Dr. Clarkson in his testimony
proceeds to underscore the necessity of
further experimentation, education, and
innovation to attain the objectives of 'hu-
mane slaughter.

Mr. LANGER. Mr. President, will the
Senator yield?

Mr. HUMPHREY. I yield.

Mr. LANGER. I have been busy in
the Judiciary Committee all morning,
and therefore I miss a part of the distin-

guished Senator’s speech. Can the Sen--

ator from Minnesota tell me how many
slaughterhouses will be affected?

.Mr. HUMPHREY. The number would
- be approximately 300 of the major
slaughterhouses.

recollection. .

Mr. LANGER. The Senator from
North Dakota has been getting tele-
grams and telephone calls stating that
the approximate cost to a packer will be
$200,000.

Mr. HUMPHREY. That is not true.

Mr. LANGER. Can the distinguished
Senator tell me What it would cost?

Mr. HUMPHREY. I am going to pre-
sent documentary evidence from the
testimony as to the cost involved. For
example, the Hormel packing plants have
developed certain humane slaughtering
practices, and the mechanism for those
practices

Mr. LANGER. That plant is located-

at Austin, Minn.

Mr. HUMPHREY. Yes. For instance,
the carbon dioxide unit for humanely
handling 60 hogs an hour costs about
$6,500. According to the testimony,
Hormel itself spent $200,000 on the de-
velopment of its ﬁrst installation, and

He indicates further on ‘

I believe the chairman _'
gave a more exact ﬁgure—~242, tomy

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —— SENATE

therefore it has been asserted that the
use of carbon dioxide is impractical for
small packers. The ﬁgure given repre-
sented the Cost of the research that went
into the method. "I assure the Senator
that since that time many packers have
adopted the same practices and have
found that, instead of costing them

money, those practices have improved»

their proﬁt statements and their gen-
eral economic conditions. -

Mr. LANGER.. Will "the Senator yield
for a further question»?

Mr. HUMPHREY. Yes.

Mr. LANGER. I should like to under-
stand the Senator’s objection to a 2-year
study.

Mr. HUMPHREY. The p1 oins1ons the
junior Senator from Minnesota supports
still provide for a study.

Mr. LANGER. A‘ 2-year study?

Mr. HUMPHREY. No; it provides for

. a continuing study, not only for 2 years,

but all the way down the line.

Furthermore, the bill we are support-
ing provides that it shall not go into
effect for a year and a half after the
promulgation of the orders or regula-
tionsof the Secretary of Agriculture.

The 2-year study which is being pro-
posed by the committee is a 2-year study
of delay, with no assurance at all there
will be any action.

I wish to repeat that the Department
of Agriculture assured me 2 years ago
it was going to make such a study as
this, and the testimony will so reveal.

- Two years ago the Department said it

was not only going to make the study,
but that it had been making one- We
are asking that the study be continued,
but we‘are also asking that during the
time the study continues, the Federal
Government shall impose certain stand-
ards and say to packers who wish to
sell to the Federal Government, certain
standards will be maintained. The bill
as it passed the House provides:

After December 31, 1959, each supplier

.from which any livestock products are pro-
cured by any agency of the Federal Govern- .

ment shall be required by such agency to
make such statement of eligibility under this
section to supply such livestock products as,
if false, will subject the maker thereof to
prosecution, title 18, United States Code,
section 287.

. Mi. LANGER. The House had ex-
tended hearings on the bill, did it not?
1, Mr. HUMPHREY. Yes The House

{subcommittee actually went into the

ﬁeld, and to the packing plants. The
subcommittee went to the countryside,
as well as holding hearings in Washing-
ton.

Mr. ,,LANGER. I am grateful to the
distinguished Senator for his comments.

Mr. HICKENLOOPER. Mr. President,
will the Senator yield?

Mr. HUMPHREY. I yield;

Mr. HICKENLOOPER. ' The Senator
he said that there seems to be some tes«
timony in the RECORD before the commit-

tee that packers which had installed

some of the methods the Senator pro-
poses found them to be more efﬁcient and
actually more proﬁtable.

Mr. HUMPHREY. That is true.

Mr. HICKENLOOPER. I recall there
was aclaim made to that effect by cer-

_ ,- July 29

tain lobbying groups, and perhaps some
evidence presented by some paCker. .

Mr. HUMPHREY. The Hormel. Co;
itself testiﬁed. I have the testimony of
the'Hormel Co. I do not~think such a.
company would lie.

Mr. HICKENLOOPER. No. That is
a veiy reputable g1 cup The Hormel
Packing Co. is not exactly unique, but it

. is m01e of a specialized 0pe1ation.

Mr. HUMPHREY. The company has
done quite well. What is so specialized
about the company, may I ask the Sen-y
ator?

Mr. HIC‘KENLOO‘PER. Its products.

Mr. HUMPHREY. The only thing spe- ’
cial is that they are extra good. The
company slaughters beef cattle and
slaughters hogs. The comp-any makes
all kinds of cold meats and sausage. I
have been through the plants. - ~

Mr. HICKENLOOPER. The packing
industry has never been one which threw
proﬁts down the drain.

\‘Mr. HUMPHREY. I would not say
that for sure, I will say to the Senator. \

Mr. HICKENLOOPER. So far as I
know the packing companies have never
followed any policy which was wasteful,
so far as they were aware. Therefore,
if these methods were more efﬁcient and
would save money, thereby making more

' money for the packing industry, I submit

that every packer in the United States
would long, since have been using them.

Mr. HUMPHREY. We would think
so, but \I submit that at the time -the
Federal meat inspection law was under
consideration the packers fought the
enactment of such a law as though it
would be equal to the plague, even
though the Federal meat inspection has
been desirable, proﬁtable, and helpful.
We would think at times the packers
would have, been able to see further
down the line, but it was not until there
was an expose of the “jungle,” as the
Senator may recall, that we got Federal

'» meat inspection.

I must also say that we would have
thought, as to poultry inspection, for. a
period of time the producers would have
found that to be proﬁtable. They ﬁnally
did, but at ﬁrst there was resistance.
Now we have a compulsory Federal
poultry inspection law on the books.

Mr. HICKENLOOPER. Of, course,
inspection in the interest of public

- health is totally different from what is

provided in the bill under consideration,
with respect to the so-called humane
slaughter of animals. 7

There is one thing which bothers me.
I think perhaps every Member of this
body, without exception, is interested
in securing. if possible, a really humane
method of slaughter.

Mr. HUMPHREY. Yes.

Mr. HICKENLOOPER. We had tes-
timony, which convinced the committee,
at least, that the methods which have”
been suggested and which are now pro-
posed to be written into law as standards
actually provide no assurance of being
any more humane than themethOds now
being used. We are asked to preScribe
certain criteria, which may change in a
year or two. A packing plant may have
to convert at great expense—and it will
be a substantial expense if there is a

 




1958.
conversion—and then may ﬁnd in" 2 or
3 years some other method has been

devised or developed which is considered

to be much more humane, so that the law
will again be amended and the factory
operation must once more be changed.

I believe that as rapidly as a general
and proved method of humane slaughter
is developed the packing plants will con-
vert on their own initiative. The plants
do not need a law to cause them to follow
practices which are humane.

I have not been convinced by the hear-
ings that the bill does prescribe a really
humane method of slaughter.

I invite attention to the fact that there
is in the bill another element which is
also of importance. The attempt is made
to provide by law that a method of kill-

ing adopted by a religious group is in"

fact humane because the law' says it is.
I am not passing upon that' question,
and I certainly do not want to inter-
fere with the deep religious convictions
and beliefs of any group. However, it
is an incongruity inrthe law when’ we
arbitrarily say that for certain classes
a particular method may be used, be-
cause we say' it is humane, and other
methods need not be employed. As I
have said, I do not want to interfere with
the deep religious beliefs of any group,
but I think such a provision is not con-
sistent in a law. .

I believe a study should be made of
this matter, as is provided in the bill as
it came from the committee. The com-
mittee amendment would direct that the
subject be studied. As a result it may be
possible to ascertain a practical, really
workable, and really humane method of
slaughter. Atleast the direction is pro--

vided in the bill, and I think it should be ’

given a chance to operate.

Mr. HUMPHREY. I thank the Sena-V

tor from Iowa. He express-es a point of
view which is held by many.‘ There are
honest differences of opinion about the
proposed legislation. ,I surely amnot
trying to chastise anyone for holding a
point of View different from mine, or
even to criticize anyone in that regard.

I add, however, there was more acti-
vity in the ﬁeld of the adoption of hu-

mane slaughter practices after the hear- -

ings were held 2 years ago than». there
had been in the preceding decade. The
reason was that there was a possibility
of legislation being enacted. There has
been considerable progress in the past 2
years. There was very little progress,
with the exception of the actions of a few
packing plants, which I will mention in
my statement, in the years prior to that.
What is more, it is difﬁcult to under-
stand how the Department of Agricul-
ture could be so interested in humane
slaughtering methods—and I feel it is
. interested—without taking more action.
Apparently, the Department did not
‘i-take too kindly to the suggestion of

even a formalized directive by the Con- '

gress of the United States for further
study in the ﬁeld of humane slaughter
methods. The bill I introduced 2 years
ago provided for a 5-year time lag. In
fact, I suggested we could extend that
provision to 7 years, so as to permit 7
years of study.

“Mr. LONG. Mr. President, will the
Senator yield? '

{exempted from selective service.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -- SENATE

Mr. HUMPHREY. I will yield in a
moment. _ '

However, under the bill, after the 7
years had expired something’would have
gone into effect, or after the 5 years
had expired there would have been rules
and regulations which would have gone
into .effect. The Department said,
“No.” The Department said, “We have
all the authority we need for studies.”

I say that the Department has had
plenty of time to study the subject.
The slaughtering of cattle has been
going on for years. Methods, which
have been found to workable and prac-
ticable, are being used successfully. by
packers and by slaughtering houses,

' which methods have been put into prac-

tice in other countries.

As a matter of fact, there are many
countries in the world today, such as
the Scandinavian countries and Great
Britain, which have humane slaughter-
ing methods such as prescribed in the
bill I propose. '

By the way, those countries know
something about the preparation of
food, and sometimes even compete with
American processors. 7

I am now happy to yield to the Sen-

ator from Louisiana. .
_ Mr. LONG. Actually there is really
nothing in the Constitution or the laws
to prohibit the Congress from enacting
laws applicable to a general class of
people, and exempting certain persons
when they ﬁnd something conﬂicting
with their own moral scruples or” sense
of justice. . '

Mr. ,HUMPHREY. That is correct.

Mr. LONG. The Selective Service
Act is a good example. If any person
believes that his religion will not per-
mit him to ﬁght or to kill, he can be

has been done in the past. Some people
feel that their own consciences and re-
.ligious teachings require them’to slaugh-
ter animals in a certain way. An ex-
ception could be made in the case of
such persons. There is certainly prece-
dent for doing something along that
line, if that is, the judgment of Con-
gress.

Mr. HUMPHREY. That is correct.

Mr. LONG. As a matter of fact, many
things are morally wrong or reprehensi-
ble which are not outlawed. by an act of
Congress. It is up to us to decide what
we want to outlaw, and how we want to
do it. ‘

I should like to add to the RECORD a

copy of a letter I received, dated May 25, '

Administrator of the Department of
Agriculture Research Service. 7

There being no objection, the letter was
ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as
follows:

DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE,
AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH SERVICE,
Washington, D. 0., May 25, 1956.
Hon. HUBERT HUMPHREY,
United States Senate.

DEAR SENATOR HUMPHREY-: During the
course of the hearing on S. 1636 to require
the us . of humane methods in the slaugh-
ter of 11Vestock and poultry in interstate and

foreign Commerce, you asked that the De-
partment consider and report back to the
subcommittee on the feasibility of 2 sugges~
tions: (1) that the Department undertake a
program of research in this ﬁeld, and (2) that.
an advisory committee be established under
the leadership of the Department with pe-
riodic reports to the Congress. "

The Department has authority to conduct
research or to assist, foster, and encourage
research in the handling, transport, and
slaughter 'of.livestock and poultry to develop
improved methods, including those which are
more humane. This authority has been used
to encourage development and use of humane
methods by industry in cooperation with.
humane associations.

In all Department research involving live-
stock and poultry, humane handling is an
important consideration. This involves all
aspects of the handling of animals on the
farm, in the channels of transportation, in
the auction markets, and the great central
yards, as well as at the slaughtering plants.
The comfort of animals has an important?"
relationship to the economic values in the
industry, and therefore ,must be carefully
considered in any research and development"
program. , ' '

Most research projects aimed speciﬁcally
at the improvement of humane handling of
animals have been undertaken by industry
with the assistance of colleges and univer-
sities and humane associations. The Depart-
ment has considered its contribution to be
most effective in working with such group.
It is only occasionally that research projects
directed speciﬁcally to these purposes are
undertaken. Work was done under authority
of the Research and Marketing Act to ex-
amine the feasibility of the use of carbon
dioxide to immobilize turkeys before slaugh-
ter. A copy of the ADepartment’s bulletin
recently issued on this subject is enclosed.

The Department continues its encourage-
ment to industry and the humane associa-
tions. In the matter of the tests and eval-
uation. of" the modiﬁcation of the captive
bolt pistol, which was discussed at the hear-
ing, the Department is keeping informed
through the observations of persons familiar
with these operations and who are assisting
with their comments and suggestions. In
similar manner the Department’s representa-
tives keep in close touch with improvements
being developed by producer groups, trans-
portation associations, meat packer organi-
zations, and the humane associations. Much
of the effort of these groups has been chan-

\ neled through Livestock Conservation, Inc.

With respect; to the establishment of an
advisory cOmmittee, the Department recog-
nizes the need for some orderly procedure
for correlating the efforts of all groups and
interests. It is believed‘that this can be ac-
complished most effectively through an in-
tensiﬁcation of the W011: of the producer.
transportation, and processor groups with the
humane associations with increased partici-
pation of Department representatives. The
Department is givingemphasi‘s to this work.
We are conﬁdent that Livestock Conserva-
tion, Inc., and the other affected groups wel-
come the Department’s participation.

The" suggested informal approach to this
matter has the advantage of bringing to-'
gether all who are concerned with the hu~
manehandling Of livestock and poultry, not
only at the time of slaughter but also dur-
ing all operations of the livestock and meat
industries. There is a growing awareness
of farmers, transportation people, and
slaughterer‘s of the need and the public de-
mand for the most humane handling of live-
stock and poultry possible to be achieve .7

This has been a steady growth. It is appar-

ent to all who are familiar with these in—
dustries over a period of years. Most of the
progress has' been made in a multitude of
small and uhdramatic, but nonetheless sig-
niﬁcant changes, which have gradually taken
place. MoSt signiﬁcant of all is the change

for the better in the attitude of those who
handle the animals. The educational pro-
gram; sponsored by Livestock Conservation,
Inc, and supported by other livestock in-
dustry groups has contributed much toward
this result.

The Department has appreciated the 0p-
portunity to present its views to your com-
mittee on this subject. If the committee

would like additional information which

may be available to us, we shall of course

be very glad torespond to your request.
Sincerely yours,

Deputy Administrator.

Mr. HUMPHREY.
pai agiaph:
The Department has authority to conduct

I note this one

research or to assist, foster, and encourage

' research in the handling, transport, and
slaughter of livestock and poultry to de-
velop improved methods, including those
which are more humane. This authority has
been used to encourage development and use
of humane ,methods by industry in c00pera-
' tion with humane associations.

The letter is rather long, but that

_ paragraph states that everything the
Senate committee proposes to do by
the language of the Senate committee
amendment is already public law. The
Department already has the authority.
The Department already has not only the
authority, but the mandate, under the
Agricultural Research Service. The
question is, What does the Department
propose to do about it?

7 Are we ﬁnally to take some action to
impose some justiﬁable and moderate
standards, or are we to wait and wait and
Wait?

As has been indicated, somewhat more
than 3 years ago I int1oduCed in the
Senate the ﬁrst humane slaughtering bill.
I understand that it was the ﬁrst ever
presented to the Congress. Iwas pre—
disposed to support humane slaughter-
ing, legislation on many grounds. I sup-
port it on moral grounds, as I know
every other Member of Congress does.-
However; I had to satisfy myself that
the legislation would be'technically and
economically practicable. I do not mind
admitting that I gave a great deal of
thought to the fact that a large number
' - of people in Minnesota are livestock pro-
ducers; and another large group in Min-
nesota are packinghouse workers. So I
dug pretty far into the facts.

Furthe1 more, one of the S’tate s la1gest
industiies is the processing of meat
products.

I dug into the facts in late 1954 and

. early 1955. I satisﬁed myself that there -

was need for humane slaughter legis-
lation. I thoub ht it was not only moral-
' ly 1ight and practicable, but that it was
economically desilable. ._

Since that time I have presided over
one subcommittee hearing on this par-
ticular subject, and I have participated
as a committee member in a series of
public hearings conducted by the full
committee under the chairmanship of
the distinguished Senator from Louisi-
ana [Mr._ELLENDER]. I have further in-
vestigated the facts on this issue in many
- othe1 ways. I am seeking to have en-
acted House bill 8308, in the form in
which it was passed by the House of
Representatives, rather than as modified
and amended by the Senate commit-

tee, because I am ,still strongly of the
opinion that effective humane slaughter
legislation, with moderate standards,
such as those set'forth in the bill passed
by the House, ought to be sent to the
President by the Congress for his signa-
ture.

I point out that the bill which came to
us from the other body was the result of

hearings before the Senate committee 2.

years ago, and the result of further
testimony and hearings before a sub-
committee and the full committee in
the other House, before the bill was
submitted for a ﬁnal vote in the House
of Representatives.

"We have been studying this proposed
legislation for more than 3 years, and
as a result of study during that 3-year

'period of time I have reason to believe

that considerable progress has been
made in the packinghouse industry it-
self, in the adoption of humane slaugh-
tering processes.

I wish to compliment the packing-
houses which have moved ahead on their
own initiative. They are entitled to the
commendation and thanks of the Amer-
ican people.

I would be less than fair if I did not.

say that determined efforts have been
made by the Department of Agriculture,
the slaughtering houses, the packing-
houses, and humane societies and asso-
ciations looking toward the adoption of
humane slaughtering methods and prac-
tices.

I am sure that relatively few Senators '

have had the opportunity to read thor-
oughly the transcripts of hearings which
have been conducted by the committees
of the Senate and the House. Very few
Senators, I’suppose, have had occasion

to, become personally familiar with the

techniques by which animals are slaugh-
tered in packing plants, or to analyze
the economics of the Operation.

I may be able to be helpful, therefore,
by summarizing the-.arguments for hu-
mane slaughtering legislation, and by
pointing out what I believe to be the fal-
lacies of arguments against such legis-
lation.

This proposed, legislation has been
carefully studied. Every Member of the
Senate has received hundreds of letters,
both from supporters and opponents.

The principal arguments fer the en-
actment of humane slaughtering legis-
lation are these:

First, every year more than 100 mil-
lion animals now are being subjected
to an extreme cruelty that is discordant
with our national moral code. I do not
believe anyone denies that. Those who
talk about humane slaughtering meth-
ods’ endorse the objective, endorse the
essential need for the application "of
such methods. Therefore, it is about
time, it seems to me, that we did some-
thing about our endorsement.

Second. Slaughtering methods now
commonly used cause an immense eco-
nomic waste, the burden of which is
borne chieﬂy by the livestock producers
and by the consumers.

In other words, the producer and the
consumer are taken for a ride on the
antiquated old rack of inhumane
slaughtering practiCes. The consumer

Juli/"29

and the livestock producer are paying
for the failure of the 'packinghouse in—
dustry in America to modernize.

Third. Practical methods of killing
animals humanely are available and are .
economically feasible for even the
smallest packers. In fact, they are
being used by packinghouses. They
are available, and they are economically
feasible even for the smallest packers.
I mention this because. the argument
has been made, and will continue to
be made, to this effect: “Oh, yes; hu-
mane slaughtering practices are feasi-
ble. They can be installed, but only the
big packers can use them. The small
packers cannot use them, because the
small packers cannot afford to do so.”

Testimony before committees in both
Houses of Congress proves that asser—
tion to be untrue. The evidence is that
the big packers surely can afford it, but
many of them do not adopt such
methods; and the small packers can
afford it, because many of them have
adopted such methods.

The record shows that many of the
small packers put into operation hu— ‘
mane slaughtering practices before the
major packers did so. They did it-be-
cause of a sense of moral code‘on the

‘ one hand,~and second, because of eco-

nomic necessity. One of the ways
whereby the small packers have been
able to compete against the giants in
the packinghouse ﬁeld has been the
utilization of humane methods of
slaughtering, which are economically
desirable and proﬁtable.

Fourth. A long history makes it clear
that the packing industry Cannot end
the cruelty -and the economic waste
without the help of legislation.

I say that because once legislation
goes into effect it becomes rather uni—
versal and it is not a matter of one
company spending money while another
company dees not spend the necessary
money. The proposed legislation we
are supporting today says to the pack-
ers: “If you are going to do business
with the Federal Government, you must
apply certain methods to the prepara—
tion of the food you will sell to the Fed-
eral Government. If you are going to
sellmeet products to the Federal Gov;
ernment, you must abide by certain
standards.”

The Federal Government has legis—
lated standards time after time as to its
purchases. There is not an item the
Federal Government purchases which
is not subject to certain standards pre-
scribed by the Federal Government.
Sometimes Congress. has established
those standards.

To my way of thinking, if the points I
have made are valid, the Senate ought
today to enact the legislation that has
come to us from the House. What Sen-.
ator will rise to say that cruelty and.
economic waste should be continued, if
there is a practical way to achieve re-
form? And I am going to prove to you
that every statement that I have made is
ha1d fact.

I have asserted that a great cruelty
exists. It is hard to ﬁnd words that can
evoke reality behind that simple state—
ment. Heie in the Senate we have got

 




1958

used to big numbers and when I say that
more than 100 million animals are sub-
jected to unnecessary cruelty every year,
I am afraid that I may sound merely
statistical. But we are morally com-
pelled, here in this hour, to try to imag-
ine—to try to feel in our own nerves—-
the totality of the suffering of 100 mil-
lion tortured animals. , The issue before
us today is pain, agony, and cruelty——
and what a moral man must do about it
in view of his own conscience.

The revered Albert Schweitzer has said
that “no one may shut his eyes and
think that the pain which is therefore
invisible to him is nonexistent; No one
may escape his own responsibility.” So
it is today in this Chamber.

A University of - Minnesota team of
scientists has conducted an exhaustive
study of injuries inﬂicted on hogs by the
shackle and hoist methods now in gen-
eral use. The scientiﬁc team had the
full cooperation, I am proud to say, of a
large Minnesota packer. The study was
conducted under ordinary'packing plant
"conditions. '

These scientists discovered that in al-

most every animal, some 60 million ani-'

. mals a year, the shackle and the wheel
- are rupturing joint capsules, tearing lig-
aments and tissues, and sometimes actu-
ally yanking leg bones out of their sock—
ets. The results of this study were pub—

lished in the July 1957 issue of the Amer-
ican Journal of Veterinary Research.

Mr. YOUNG. .Mr. President,
Senator yield? '
Mr. HUMPHREY. ,I yield.

Mr. YOUNG. If we were to‘correct
by the passage of the pending bill all of

what we might call cruelty to“"animals, ,

, ~we would be accomplishing something.
However, there are some things which
appear to be inhumane about‘which we
cannot do. anything.

Mr. HUMPHREY. That may be true.

Mr. YOUNG. For example, the de-
horning of cattle is a very painful thing.
It is a bloody thing. The rendering of
male cattle into steers is a painful proc-
ess. How can we get down to the farm
level and correct those situations? I
know the Senator would never advocate
doing that.

Mr. HUMPHREY. I thoroughly agree
with the Senator. I do not believe we
can eliminate all instances of pain and
stress. I shall not base my case on that
particular aspect of the program, be-
cause the Senator from North Dakota
is eminently correct, that there are
things which must be done and are being
done in the ﬁeld of animal industry
which surely would be termed by any
human being as being anything but hu-
mane. I believe that is what the Sena-
tor is saying. However, merely because

we do not eliminate all inhumaneness

is.no reason why we should not try to
minimize some of it.

Mr. YOUNG. I am in favor of the
objective. I believe the Senator is in
too big a hurry.

- Mr. HUMPHREY. ‘ Because of his
diligent attendance at the hearings and
his willingness to stay in the Chamber,
I feelthat before the. debate is over the

posal of the Senator from Minnesota. I
have faith in him, and I know it will
happen.

I will not give a detailed description '

of the variety of tortures which are rou-
tinely inﬂicted in our packing plants on
cattle, horses, sheep, calves, and lambs.

Ordinarily, an attempt is made to
knock cattle to the ﬂoor witha sledge
hammer. Because the men who do the
knocking are not always expert and be-
caUse cattle often move at the instant
that the hammer swings, the animals
often are terribly injured and maimed
before they are hammered into uncon-
sciousness. Witnesses have told our
committees of seeing steers struck as

many as 20 times before they become

insensible. The hammer knocks off
horns, mashes noses, breaks jaws, pounds
out eyes. ' ,

It is notable that in none of the three
public hearings on this subject conducted
by congressional committees , has any
packer denied the existence of the
cruelty that I am now describing. We
have heard expert and ofﬁcial spokesmen
for all of the national associations of
packers and we have heard many indi-
vidual packers. Not one of them has
ever disputed the facts as I am giving
them. ..

The cruelty exists.
and terrible cruelty.
kind and in scale.

All of our major religions brand cruelty
to animals as a sin. The ancient law-
makers of the Hebrews understood thou-
sands of years ago that cruelty to ani-
mals was an offense against God. One
of the most eminent of American rabbis
reminded us, in committee hearing, that
Talmudic literature says of Moses that
after he proved his kindness to ani-
ma 5 did God accept him as His divine
messenger to the Jewish people. Like-
wise; the Christian religion in its very
essence condemns cruelty, to beast as
well as to man. '

It is to be noted- that the legislation
that I am urging is strongly supported
by many churches. The‘General Board
of Social and Economic Relations of the
Methodist Church, representing 10 mil-
lion Americans, has said to us, in a
formal resolution:

This board opposes a widespread situation
in this country where millions of meat
animals for American tables are slaughtered
every year under conditions of unthinkable
brutality.

We strongly urge increasing use of humane
slaughtering methods which have long been
in use in Britain, Holland, Switzerland, in
all the Scandinavian countries, and also in
New Zealand and the Fiji Islands, and we
commend the several. American packing
plants which have employed such methods,
the use of anesthetics,
pistol. -

We protest the delay in dealing with such
a situation and call upon the Congress to
enact at once the legislation necessary to
correct the present situation and to insure
humane slaughtering methods in the pack-
ing plants of the United States. Such bills
as Senate bill No. 1497 and House bill No.
8308, are samples of the legislation required.

House bill 8308 is the pending bill, and
S. 1497 is the companion bill.

great Southern Baptist Convention,
speaking through the executive of its

, Christian Life Commission and through A

its president, is as ardent in support of.
humane slaughter legislation as are the
Methodists. ‘ ~
The record is full of calls for actio
by many other religious groups and by .
religious leaders, Jewish and Christian
alike, Protestant and Catholic alike.
And the moral issue is what con-
cerns the General Federation of Womr‘
en’s Clubs, an association of 15,000
organizations with more than 11 million
members. This biggest organization of
women in America has said through the,

.action of its national convention:

All thoughtful persons recognize that
cruelty is anevil that should be eradicated
from our society, not merely for the sake‘of
animals but for our own good. We know ,
that cruelty, whether to animals or to men, .
causes in the perpetrator a moral and
cultural erosion that is harmful to the Whole
of society. Cruelty to animals in our
slaughterhouses has thus far been per-
mitted only because, it is argued, cruelty is'
cheaper than decency. The immorality of
the argument is‘ obvious.

To that I say: Amen. .
Yes; the immorality of the argument

_ is obvious. ,

But the argument that cruelty is
cheaper than decency is more than im—
moral; it is a phony argument that will
not. stand 5 minutes of examination.

I have said that slaughter methods
now commonly used cause an immense
economic waste, the burden of "which
falls principally on farmers and con-
I now offer my proof.

Let me refer again to the study of
"hog-killing methods made by the Uni-
versity of ~ Minnesota scientists, the »
study which I earlier described. , .

I take the liberty of referring to the
University of Minnesota’s splendid
School of Agriculture. The Uniyersity
of Minnesota is one of the great land-
grant universities. I believe in its com-
petence and its ability to make an
objective examination and study. That
study was undertaken because packers
have long been puzzled and economically
burdened by the frequent appearance, in
hams, of what is called a cherry bruise.
This bruise is a bloody spot in the ham,
sometimes on the surface, sometimes \,
hidden in the meat——so that a housewife
who buys the ham ﬁnds part of the meat
revoltingly unappetizing and inedible.

.It ought to interest every Senator
from a farm State to note that for 50
years or more the packers have bee-n
blaming these cherry bruises on farmers
and transportation companies. The
University of Minnesota report says that
in all instances packing plant workers
and executives associated the appear-
ance of the condition with injury to the
animal during transit from the farm to
the packing plant.

Those who know the ways of livestock
markets will understand what has been
happening. On the theory that these

- bruises were incurred before the hogs

got to the packing plant, buyers for the
packers have naturally been discount!-
ing, in prices bid for hogs, the losses
involved in the damaged hams. It is the
farmers and the feedlot operators who

 




14076 ‘ I 1 ,
' have been paying for the cruelties in-
ﬂicted on animals by the packers. ,

The amount of money involved is enor‘
*mous. The Minnesota research team

discovered. that in a single plant the loss
from meat damaged by the shackle-and-

hoist method was exceeding $90,000 a~

year.

That loss did not occur during ship-
ment from the producer to the plant; it
occurred in the plant after the animals
had been received by the packer. Actu-
ally; tl’ﬁa loss probably was much higher
than the conservative scientists reported.
The published ﬁgures take no account
of meat that is thrown away in disgust
by housewives who are sold hams with
hidden bloodspots. As the research
groupitself Said, “When consumer ac-
ceptance is considered, these hidden

‘ hemorrhages may prove to be more eco-
nomically signiﬁcant than the hemor-
rhages found prior to selling the prod-
uct.” And the report further comments
that “the percentage of claims for defec—
tive hams due to this condition has not
been ascertained.”

I ask Senators to note that this Min-
nesota study dealt only with hogs. The
packers have never seen ﬁt to arrange
for any similar study of damage done
to meat when the shackle and hoist are
used on cattle, calves, sheep, and lambs.
But commonsense tells us that if the
weight of a 250-pound hog so terribly
tears joints and tissues, even greater
damage and economic loss result when
a half— ton steer or 1 ,500-pound bull is
hoisted.

The cruelties of conVentional slaugh-
ter methods damage meat in many other
ways—and none of us is so economically
illiterate as to imagine that losses of

this kind are borne only by packing in- ‘

-dustry stockholders.

‘ Mr. E. Y. Lingle, president of the. Seitz
Packing Co., of St. Joseph, Mo., has done
a good job 'of explaining this subject.
Mr. Lingle’s plant is one of the smaller
units 0f the packing industry, although
an excellent and efﬁcient one. The Seitz
company was one of the ﬁrst to use the

. humane Captive bolt pistol in place of
the archaic and brutal sledge hammer.
Mr. Lingle has testiﬁed, his remarks

being reported verbatim on pages 166-
167 of the transcript of a hearing con-
ducted by a Senate subcommittee in May
1956, that after his ,piant switched to
humane methods he discovered that
cattle bled better, that consequently it
was easier to skin animals, that the
Government inspector has‘remarked that
there is less. coagulated blood in the
heart and the men on the ﬂoor have
shownrme that there is less blood in the
chest cavity when the cattle are eviscer-
ated, that cattle out better, and there
were fewer bruises in the meat. ,

Mr. Lingle’s statement ought to be

carefully studied by every livestock
grower and every meat consumer. In
plain words, this honest packer tells us
that the conventional cruel methods of
killing cause bloody meat, they are the
cause of the costly stiff cattle and dark
cutters, they cause damaging bruises,
they cause damage to valuable hides,
and they increase labor costs.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

The cOmmittees have accumulated
much evidence that the usual inhumane
methods of killing are responsible for
huge additional economic losses through
an abnormally high industrial accident
rate and through the costs of an almost
fantastic rate of labor turnover.

Department of Labor statistics show
that the packing industry has an acci-
dent rate that is almost double the aver-
age for all industry. The accident rate
on packing plant killing ﬂoors and in
shackling pens is largely responsible for
that unenviable record. The president
of the Seitz Packing Co., Mr. Lingle, em-
phasized that cattle knocking is an un-
safe job. ‘

The loss of man-hours, the medical ex-
penses, the workmen’s compensation in-

volved—all these are burdens on the.

entire economy.

Many of these can be relieved and al—
leviated by modernizing the facilities of
packing plants and by installing humane
methods of slaughter which are work-
able and efﬁcient, and have been tried
and found to be practical.

Packing plant executives have freely
told us, in committee, that few men want
the jobs in shackling and knocking pens.
In many plants men stay on those jobs
only a week or two before they use the
privileges of seniority to demand trans-
fer to safer and easier jobs. Since many
industrial studies have revealed that it
costs more than $500 to employ and
train each new man on such jobs, it is
apparent that here there is another
great source of economic waste. '

These facts explain why packinghouse
labor favors the legislation now pro-
posed and why the Amalgamated Meat
Cutters and Butcher Workmen of North
America, AFL—CIO, has oﬂ‘icially asked

us to enact a humane slaughter law. '

They are the people who work in the
packinghouses. They are not the ones
who sit in the air conditioned, well-de-
signed front ofﬁces having all the com-
forts of modern conveniences. The
persons who are on the packing ﬁoor
working ~w-ith‘ the animals, seeing the
cruelty and the economic waste, are the
ones who have asked for the legislation,
together with the vast groups of our citi-
zenry who have poured letters into Con-
g1 ess urging action.

I cannot go’ further into the economics
of this issue. But it is obvious—it is not
even debated by the packers—that
cruelty is costly, besides being immoral.
And I particularly call attention to the
fact that the Federal Government is one
of the biggest buyers of meat and that
anything that raises the cost of meat is
a direct burden on the funds that we
vote for school lunches, f01 the feeding
of our Armed Forces, and f01 livestock
price- support programs. -

I have proved that a great and im-
moral cruelty is being committed and
that the cruelty is economically costly
to the Nation. Now I offer proof_-that
the cruelty is unnecessary—that live-
stock can be slaughtered humanely, and
that the methods available are practical
and within the means of every packer,
big and small. .

July 29

And here we come. again to the tower-
ing fact that ought, in logic, to end all
debate on this subject. That fact is
that a very substantial number of Amer-
ican packing plants—although unfor-
tunately still -a small minority—have
already adopted humane methods, have
proved them to be practical and proﬁta—

ble, and have testiﬁed tocommittees of

Congress that the humane methods are
better in every respect than the old and
cruel methods.

I commented earlier on the Hormel
Co. George 9. Hormel & Co., one of
the great packers of the Nation, proc-
essing some 10,000 hogs a day in a single .
plant, has since 1952 been humanely.
putting hogs to sleep with an anes-
thetic gas before they are subjected to
handling of any kind in the slaughter-
house. .The animals ride on a moving
belt into a zone of invisible, odorless,
tasteless carbon dioxide gas. They go
peacefully to sleep as they ride and they
never awaken. There is no struor t,gle,
no fear, no injury, no pain.

Executives 0f Hormel, which is reputed
to be the most proﬁtable packing com-
pany in America, have told congressional
committees that they have actually saved
money by switching to this humane
method from the old cruelties. The best
evidence on this comes from the fact that
after a long experimental period; in 1
plant, Hormel extended the system to its
2 other big plants. And there is the
further evidence that the Kingan plant
of HyéGrade Food Products Corp., in
Indiana, has followed the. Hormel lead,
and the carbon- dioxide system is being
installed in three plants of Oscar Mayer
8100.

Perhaps I am a man with primitive,
logical processes, but it seems to me that
what works on hogs in seven plants of .

_ the jHormel,, Kingan, and Mayer com-

panies Will work on hogs in Armour,
Swift, and Cudahy plants. I have not
heard that Hormel, Kingan, and Mayer
have any special breed of hogs.

It is even easier to slaughter cattle,
horses, calves, sheep, and lambs hu-
manely. It can be done and it is being
done with a simple stunning instrument
that costs about $150 to buy and around
3 cents an animal to operate. Some
manufacturers call these tools captive-
bolt pistols, some call them humane stun-
ners. They are being used, and have long
been used, by some very successful and
proﬁtable‘packing plants.

I_ have already quoted Mr. E. Y. Lingle,
president of the Seitz Packing Co. Mr.
Lingle testiﬁed that captive-bolt pistols
actually saved money in his operations.
Many other packers have said the same
thing. Senators with small packers
among their constituents should note
that the captive—bolt pistol, which is one
of the’humane methods or instruments,
has been regularly used, fo-r‘many years,
with complete satisfaction, by such rela-
tively small operators as the. Great Falls
Meat Co. at Great Falls, Mont, Seitz, and
more than a some of other progressive
small companies.

It is the big companies which are
ﬁghting the bill. It is the big companies
which are saying that the small com-

 




1958

panies cannot afford the proposed meth-‘.«

od. - But it happens that the small com—
panies were the ones who really insti-
tuted humane processes. It is peculiar
how the large suddenly become so broth-
‘erly toward the small, when the small
are already leading the big brothers into
the paths of righteousness, if they would
only follow.

And in the last 2 years, admittedly
only under the pressure of the proposal
that now is before us the Senate, nearly
200 more plants have started using the
humane stunning instruments on cat-
tle, and, in a few cases, on other species
of animals. The eXpert consultant of
the American Meat Institute, Mr. Esh-
baugh, told our committee in April that
these new converts have found that the
stunners are satisfactory. I interpret
"the word “satisfactory,” when used in
this way by the American Meat Insti-*

tute, to mean, “It is beyond any criti-.

cism we can think of”,

The American Meat Institute has
sought to alarm some of- the small pack-
ers and the livestock producers by bland-
ly asserting, in the face of conclusive
evidence to the contrary, that humane
methods of slaughter would be ruinously
costly to the packers; Such statements
are pure nonsense. ‘

A captive—bolt pistol costs about $125.
The most advanced Remington humane
stunnerscosts only $240. These instru-
ments are worked by a .22-caliber blank
cartridge, and cartridges
3 cents each. .

I remind the Senate again that the
consulting expert of the American Meat
Institute has, himself, told us that the

captive-bolt pistol and modiﬁed versions ‘

of that instrument are right now being
used, with satisfaction, on all species of
livestock.

BecauseGeOrge A. Hormel & Co. spent
more than $200,000 .on deve10pment and
its ﬁrst installation. of carbon dioxide
equipment, it has been asserted that use
of the carbon dioxide method is imprac-
tical for small packers. However, that
is an absolute non sequitur.

The Allbright—Nell Co., of Chicago,

licensee under Hormel patents, is offer-7
ing a carbon dioxide unit, capable" of
humanely processing 60 hogs an hour,
or 480 hogs in an 8—hour day, for around
$3,500. That is just about the price of
a 1-ton truck. Has any Senator ever'
heard a packer complain that he would
be put out of business if he had to buy
‘ a truck? ‘ ' '

Moreover, H. R. 8308 will affect very,

few small packers. This bill affects only
packers that sell their products to the
Federal Government. That is why the
big packers aretﬁghting the bill; they
are ﬁghting it because they do‘ not want
to make any changes in their methods.
They want to make the Federal Govern-

ment pay for the meat they process; but -

the packers themselves do not want to
meet the standards. The same argu-.
ment was made against the ﬁrst pro—
posals for meat inspection, when they
were considered by the Congress.

Mr. President, most of the small pack-
ers who have expressed alarm over this
proposed legislation have never even

contemplated making a bid for Govern-
ment contracts.

The essential and demonstrated fact is
this: Senators can vote today for House,
bill 8308 with the assurance that they
will not be voting a hardship on any
packer, large or small.

I must now offer some proof that the
carbon dioxide method and the various
stunning instruments are humane. That
is made necessary by the fact that the
Department of Agriculture has told us
that it wants many years and many dol-
lars of the taxpayers’ money for a study
of this subject. Mr. Benson, the De-
partment says, does not know what is
humane and what is not humane. He
wants us to postpone action indeﬁnitely
while he ponders the question; and he

also wants, of course,an‘appropriation ’

to ﬁnance his pondering.

Mr. President, I ﬁnd it hard to treat .

seriously; the contention by the Agricul-
ture Department that we should postpone
all action on this issue in order to allow
the Department to conduct elaborate
studies to determine whether" it is more
humane to anesthetige a hog or to yank
its legs out of joint and cut its throat
while it is fully conscious; whether it is
more humane to stun a steer into instant
unconsciousnes with a captive-bolt pis-
tol, or to beat' its head to a pulp with a
half dozen blows of a hammer.

Until the American Meat Institute be-

came agitated over the pending legisla- .

tion, the Department of Agriculture
never concerned itself with whether ani-
mals in packing plants Were treated hue
manely.
testiﬁed frankly that the Department
has always felt ‘- that whether animals
suﬁered cruelty was someone ‘ else’s
business. ,'

Over many years, on the other hand,

the great humane societies of the world

have intensively studied this question.
In America, the Humane Society of the
United States and the Animal Welfare
Institute have ﬁnancedv, studies by uni-
versity scientists. The American Hu-
mane Association" has participated in a
joint committee with the American Meat
Institute. In . England, the venerable

Royal SPCA and the Universities Fed- ,

eration for. Animal Welfare have spon-
sored «scientiﬁc studies. The Humane
society of the United States, the Animal
Welfare Institute, and .the Massachu-
setts SPCA have sent their staff. experts

“to Europe, to study methods used in pack-
ing plants there, where humane slaugh- .

ter laws have; been in effect for decades.
Investigators ﬁnanced andcsponsored
by the humane societies have used the
electrocardiograph and other adyanced
scientiﬁc methods to determine what
methods are actually painless.
- An «additional vast amount of study
has been made by independent scientists.
Every‘ study ever conducted has con-
ﬁrmed that the captive-bolt pistol, car-
bon dioxide anesthetization, and electric
stunning are humane. -
Carbon dioxide, incidentally, has long
and frequently been used as an anes-
thetic for human beings. It is a scien-
tiﬁchfact—apparently unknown only to
the ’Agriculture Department—that car-

bon dioxide is a true anesthetic; that
it does not suffocate; and that, when in-
haled, it causes no unpleasant sensation
of any kind. Are we to postpone action
for 4 or 5 more years, and spend a large,
sum of money, merely so that the .De-
partment -- of Agriculture may repeat
studies which were completed long ago?

If any Senator plans today to vote
against House bill 8308, I suggest that he
should think up a better excuse for his
vote than the contention that there ‘
should be further study to determine
whether anesthetics are humane.

I come now to providing proof for my
fourth statement: namely, that the
cruelties of the killing ﬂoors cannot be
ended without the cooperative help of
Federal law. _

The packing industry, as all of us
know, is ‘one of the largest economic
units of our Nation. There are more
than 5,000 commercial slaughterers.
Most of them are engaged in interstate
commerce. The living animals move
from Texas to Kansas City, from Iowa
to Chicago, from Arizona to California,
from Ohio to New York. The ﬁnished
products cross all State lines. . '

Some of the packers are industrial,
giants. More of them are small business
units. They are divided among 3- big

national and regional asociations and'
They are

20 or 30 State associations.
sharply competitive.

I am making the point that in .such'
an industry, voluntary reform insuch an
area as the one we are now discussing
is literally impossible. Some packers will
see the light. Some have already adopted ,.
humane methods for economic reasons,
and I am sure that some have also been '
motivated by humane reasons. But total
or even substantial reform will never be
voluntarily achieved, because this indus-
try is not a single unit, but is made up of -
more than 5,000 units. _ ,

All of us remember how the packers..-
fought the Federal law that established
the meat inspection service. A veritable
army of packers appeared in Washing-
ton, near the opening of the century, to
tell Congress that the proposed law
would ruin them. -_ W”

But what do we ﬁnd today? We ﬁnd
the packers united in praising the law
they once stormily opposed; we ﬁnd
them, in fact, urging Congress to extend .
the inspection service and make it even
more rigid. ’ _ _ ‘

Humane slaughter laws now are in
force in_ Great Britain, Norway, Den-
mark, Sweden, the Netherlands, Swit-
zerland, Finland, and, as has often been
stated, even in the Fiji Islands. But
nowhere in the world have the slaughter-
houses reformed themselves without
such laws. ' ,

The American Meat Institute repeat-‘- ,
edly has told us that for 30 years it has ,
been studying methods of slaughter.

even once recommended to its members
any step aimed at alleviating the suffer-
ing of animals. omcial spokesmen for
the packers quite frankly confessed to
use in committee—they could not do
anything else—that they have been re-
miss in this ﬁeld. The packer spokes-

 




'~14072

man used exactly that phrase—“we have
been remiss.” The packers admitted

that they have been spurred to very"

recent concern only by the pending
legislation.

If the proposed legislation is killed to-
day‘ the packers will go right back to their
old indifference. This does not mean
that individual packing plant executives
are cruel and evil; it simply means that
inertia will triumph. Allrof us agree
that the cruelties of the packing plants
ought to end. It is unrealistic to pray
piously for this objective while voting
against proposed legislation that alone
can make the reform possible.

Mr. President, I wish to make a brief
comment on the particular provisions of
House bill 8308, in the form in which it
was passed by the House. It is a mod-
erate, reasonable, nonpunitive bill. It
merely provides that it is the policy of
the United States to encourage the hu-
mane slaughter of livestock, and that
the Federal Government will buy‘only
f1 om packers who comply with this
public policy.

The bill covers a very large portion
of all livestock slaughtered, but affects
only a small minority of packing com-

' panies—certainly not more than 500
ﬁrms-

It has been suggested that the proe
posed legislation might create some difﬁ-
culty for executive departments in the
execution of their purchases. ~ Such a
suggestion ignores economic realities.
The Federal Government buys close to
one-quarter of a billion dollars’ worth of
meat and meat products every year. The
Government pays proﬁtable p1 ices In
the highly competitive packing industi y,

'wherever there is a buyer with $250
[million to spend, there will be eager
sellers

The law should be largely self— enf01c- I

ing. VendOrs selling to the Government
would be required to certify, under
perjury penalties, that they are comply-
ing with the provisions of, House bill
8308. This is a much cheaper and surer
way of getting the desired results than by
relying upon a criminal law, with the
necessity of investigation and prosecu-
tion.

In short, House bill 8308 is a practical
bill.

House bill 8308 provides absolute pro—
tection for the rituals of all religions. I
emphasive the word “absolute.”
sections of the bill which" are concerned
with ritual slaughter were drafted and

proposed, in fact, by rabbis, lawyers, and ‘

. leading laymen representing the over-
whelming majority of American Jews.
I would be the last Member of the Senate
to sponsor any proposed legislation which
conceivably could infringe upon or im-
peril religious freedom. I repeat that
House bill 8308 provides absolute protec-
tion for religious ritual. .The largest

organizations of American Jews fully

understand that fact,“

* I hope the Senate now will vote House
bill 8308 into law. Nothing whatever
can be gained by procrastination. The

American public understands this situa— -

tion.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —- SENATE

The St. Paul Dispatch, located in a
city which knows about packing plants,
said this, on July 3:

It is unfortunate that the Senate Agri-
culture Committee has come up with a bill
calling for only another study of humane
slaughtering methods in the United States.
There is no need for such a study.

The Milwaukee Sentinel, after report-
ing the recommendation of a study bill
by our Agriculture Committee, said edi-
torially on June 27.

. We don’t quite get this. \The Secretary
will study the subject for 2 more years and
resubmit the same proposals to Congress
which are already before it. And around and
around we go. The Senate should disregard
this conscience- -salving substitute measure
and pass the humane slaughter bill Without

. delay.

The WashingtOn Post said, on June 22:
There is no need whatever‘"“for a 2-year
study Of humane slaughter techniques.

The Post called the Agriculture Com-
mittee proposal a “dilatory and evasive
measure ”

The Miami News Said, on June 20:

The Department of Agriculture has yielded

to the pressure of the American Meat Insti- '

tute in calling for further study of the bill—
an old and sure method of killing needed
legislation. But with humane slaughter al-
ready the rule in many Of our best packing-
houses and inmost European countries, what
is there to study?

The Charlotte (N.
June25:

There is no need for any additional study
Of humane slaughtering methods. It is plain-
ly absurd to postpone action in the United

C.) News said, on

States merely to conﬁrm the proposition-

that cruelty is cruel. .

And the New York Herald Tribune
said, on July 9: ‘ .

Further study. For 30 years, this has
been the excuse advanced for delay by some
of the big meatpackers. The House Agricul-
ture Committee made a personal tour of the
slaughterhouses and was immediately con-
vinced that changes were necessary, the
Senators, however, staying in Washington,
refusing even to see a ﬁlm depicting the
slaughtering of. hogs.

Mr. President, I could read to the Sen-
ate another 200 editorials along the same
line. The American press is Virtually
unanimous on this subject.
gress has been asked by great organiza-
tions Of the Nation’s people to act favor-
ably. Every one of us has been deluged
by our constituents with pleas for the
passage of this proposed legislation. And
the letters have not been the kind written
by lobby organizations, either.

The conscience of America is involved
in this matter. The American’public has
spoken to us with the voice of a civilized
and moral people.

I have discussed economics.
talked of practicalities. I have touched
on politics.

But as my ﬁnal word, I say this to my
colleagues. The issue before ' us is an
issue of fundamental morality. Those of
us Who believe in a just and merciful God
have r-a clear mandate. I trust that in

the next few minutes the Senate will re- '
ject the proposal that it be devious, ~-

The Con- *

I have I

evasive, and hypocritical, and will take
decisive action to achieve a reform that
is long overdue. '

The House has passed effective hu-
mane slaughter legislation in the form
of House bill 8308, the measure I have
described.

The Senate Committee on Agriculture,
by a split vote, has reported only the title
of the bill as passed by the House, but has
stricken its language, and has replaced
it with a mere study commission proposal
that humane groups condemn as only a
device to delay action.

I ask the Senate to reject the Senate
committee’s amendment. When that
amendment is rejected, the pending
question will be the original language of
House bill 8308—the language supported
by all the humane organizations, the
language which 17 of my colleagues have
joined in seeking to have restored as the
real issue before the Senate.

Mr. President, with the cooperation of
national organizations concerned with
the humane movement, we have made a
compilation of mail sent by Senators to
constituents all over the country. That
compilation shows that some 53 Senators
have in writing stated they were in favor.
of the language of the bill as passed by
the House, rather than the study com-
mission amendment reported by the
Senate committee.

With a majority of the Senate thus
on record in writing, it appears only just
to give this body an opportunity to vote
on the real issue.

A “no” -vote\by a majority of the Sen-
ators voting on the committee amend-
ment will provide that opportunity. A
“no” vote will be the vote asked by the
humane organizations, and the ,vote '
which 53 Senators have pledged to their
constituents they would cast for humane
slaughter. _

Mr. President, I . believe the bill as
passed by the House to be sufﬁciently
moderate to merit the support of every
Senator, not only tlfe support of a ma-
jority of the Members of the Senate who,
I hope, will vote for the bill.

I believe the bill represents construc-
tive thinking and a beginning approach.
It proVides: for the study for which the

Senate committee amendment provides,

and also for enforcement at least in the
areas-of Federal purchases.

Mr. WILEY. I should like to say to

That is a- very ﬁne quality he has which,
I am sure, is appreciated by all Sena-

of the Senate, but in the Senator’s daily

going about in life. He has the same en-

Mr. HUMPHREY. I thank the Sen-
ator very much. I am always very happy

to work with the good Senator from Wise

consin, my dear friend.

Mr. WILEY. Mr. President, I was
pleased to read over United Press Inter-
national wires a story concerning the ex~
cellent program of technical assistance
by the United States Department of Agri—
culture in helping to combat man’s an-
cient enemy—insects in the Middle East,
southeast Asia, and Africa. '

Since 1951 Department of Agriculture
. scientists have helped no less than 13
countries to combat hunger, malnutri-
tion, and poverty by controlling food
destroying pests. ‘

Among the countries helped have been
Egypt, Afghanistan, Ethiopia,» Libya,

Iran, Tunisia, Pakistan, Iraq, Lebanon,

India, Jordan,Morocco, and Turkey.

I point out that several of these coun-
tries are the very lands with whom we
are most directly interested at this pres-
ent moment of crisis in the Middle East.

Thanks to the know—how which we
have built up in our Department of Agri-
culture, technical assistance workers
have gone forth to demonstrate'projects
in these lands. They have shown how
insecticides Can combat no less than 85
insects attacking 37 crops.

The ﬁrst big project was control of the
desert locust, or grasshopper, which not
only has been in the headlines in our
own State of COlorado, and other Mid-

west and Far West, recently, but which,

has brought famine to countries since
biblical days.

Mr. President, I believe that this sound
program of combating man’s insect and,

yes, fungus and bacterial” enemies, is the ‘

kind of program which makes sense from
every national and international stand-
point. I,

I know of noecountry and no people
in the world which would think ill of a
dedicated entomologist who goes abroad
to battle enemies which attack man
himself, or man’s'crops and man’s live-
stock. ‘

It is almost impossible to estimate the
amount of human misfortune which has
been caused by pests.‘ The Food and
Agricultural Organization has estimated
that, in a single year, losses caused by
rats and insects and fungi to stored
grains and rice, alone, represented
enough lost food to keep 150 million
people alive for a year.

.By battling these enemies, we save

human lives. We not only save crops, we ,

increase crop yields. ,

Moreover, American entomologists
have successfully battled cattle ticks,
which have cost terriﬁc mortality in

praise of the work of the private pesti-

ute to the Work of the National Agricul-

I have been pleased, subsequently, to

secretary of that association, advising of
his organization’s further work.

may say, is Mr. James D. Hopkins, of the.

ENTOMOLOGY INiTI-IE POINT 4 PROGRAM1

(By Edson J. Hambleton, Oﬁice, Foreign Agri-
cultural Relations, USDA)

In a recent address, W. Averell Harriman
simply stated the basic purpose of all agri-
cultural projects under point 4: “We Ameri-
cans, with our scientiﬁc knowledge, are
literally helping grow 2 cars of corn where
I grew before.” You and I, as entOmol-
ogists, know that this is possible in any
underdeveloped country where certain

\Changes can be easily introduced—changes

such as improved seed, better preparation of
the soil, use of fertilizers and pesticides, and
adoption of more effective agronomic
practices.

Some noteworthy examples of increased
yields have already been reported by point 4
workers. In one area of India the yield of
potatoes has been increased from 119 bushels
per acre to 235, and the yield of wheat from
13 to 26. In El Salvador, corn yields have
been doubled. Yet if we are to carry on and
bring about other increases in farm products,
we must not lose sight‘of the fact that we
will have to provide facilities for proper
handling and storage of food. If we do not,
we will be growing 2‘ ears of corn where I
grew before just to feed twice as many

, weevils. "

We entomologists are conscious of the fact
that as crop production is improved, condi-
tions are also brought about that are likely

to favor destructive insects and to provide

sistance planning. Few farmers in the un‘
derprivileged areas of the world have any
conception of the losses that result from
insect attack. And eVen if they do, there
has been little that they could do to ﬁght
back. I have always felt that, if we could
ﬁnd ways and means to protect from insects
“and diseases the crops now being grown, that
alone would increase production to the point
where we would no longer need to fear food
shortages. ‘

Although most underdeveloped countries '
have tropical or subtropical climates, their
insect problems are much like ours. They
are confronted with many of the cosmopoli-
tan species that have been widely distributed
through commerce for many centuries.
Among them are some of the most annoying
and dangerous to man and most destructive
to his livestock, crops, and food prgducts.

The history of conquering agricultural
pests in. the United States" is ﬁlled with
lessons for the entomologist abroad. They
teach him such things as what pests to ex-
pect, what control methods to use, what pit-g~
falls to avoid. They show him the impor-
tance of being foresighted about such mat-
ters as quarantine. ‘

' But agricultural pests are not the only
ones that harass the world. For many years
we have suffered from infectious human
diseases that ,are insect borne and by that
means have been imported from one place
to another. Yellow _.__fever and malaria are
good examples, both carried from victim to
victim ,by -mosquitoes. Everywhere, the 7
problems of health and agriculture go hand—
in-hand. Although in .most countries
medical science has advanced more rapidly'
than entomology, it is only in recent years
that an attemptwhas been made to control
some of the pestilential diseases that still
sWeep through large areas of the world in
epidemic waves. Vast areas of the world
remain undeveloped and their resources ar'e‘».g
denied to mankind because of diseases‘that
are rampant. These must be controlled if
economic development is to succeed. Health
authorities, like entomologists, are con-
cerned with quarantines, which have served
a useful purpose in preventing the spread
of disease from country to country. The.
development of faster 'means of transporta-
tion, however, is limiting the effectiveness
of- quarantine protection; and attention is
now being given to regional» programs dea-
signed to attack --and eradicate certain dis-
eases at their source. This is a most con-
structive approach in the international
health movement of today, in which col-
laboration toward a common goal has been
really magniﬁcent. '

as a: 4: a: a:

Cooperative effort in the Control of agri-
cultural pests has received less attention
in technical assistance programs than has
that of insect vectors of human diseases.
This fact is easily understood, yet it in no
way reﬂects the urgent need‘ to wage all-Out
war on some of the pests that plague live-
stock and food and ﬁber crbps in so many
areas of the world that they are a matter
for international concern. However, within
the last few years, I. am pleased to report,
technical assistance administrators are view-_
ing insects and the'damage they cause in a
new light. They are beginning to focus at-
tention on losses caused by insects in terms
of food production and to see how insect con-
trol projects ,might form an integral part,
in programs of technical collaboration. En-
tomology can and will play a. 'more im-
portant part in technical assistance if given
the opportunity. Fortunately, it has already
clearly demonstrated its value.

COOPERATIVE CONTROL OE THE DESERT LOCUST
AND OTHER MAJOR PESTS IN THE MIDDLE
EAST AND SOUTH ASIA 1

(By Edson J. Hambleton and Stanley B.
Fracker, Agricultural Research Service,
USDA)

One of the many kinds of technical as-
sistance provided in our foreign programs,
plant pest control is an effective and eco-
, nomical means of helping .people overcome
fear and discontent in their struggle to
build a better agriculture. While technical-
assistance programs have been greatly ex-
panded in recent years, we have been
brought face to face with insect problems
entirely new or little known to us.. Out-
standing among these is the desert locust,
Schistocerca gregaria Forskal. From Bibli-
cal times nations of the Middle East, South
Asia, and Africa have suffered one locust
pl’ague after another. 5 In our short experi-
ence in providing assistance to nations af-
fected by the locust we have seen a change
in their attitude and willingness to coop-
erate in programs of national and interna-
tional signiﬁcance. In the overall program
of technical assistance, with the exception
of locust control, plant pest control still
plays a minor role.

' ROLE OF USDA IN THE FOA PROGRAM

The participation of .the Department Of
Agriculture in technical assistance programs
which are now carried out under the direc-
tion of the Foreign Operations Administra-
tion? is based on a memorandum of agree-.-
ment dated February 18, 1954. In this mem-
orandum authority was granted to the Des
partment in connection with the planning
and implementation of insect-control pro-
grams in cooperation with governments of
the Near East, ’south Asia, and AfriCa. On
the basis of this authority a special project
was agreed upon between the Agricultural
Research Service and the FOA and made
effective July 1,1954.

Within the ABS the Plant Pest Control

Branch is now the agency responsible for,

operating the regional insect control proj-
gect. " This project " supersedes the former
regional locust control program, but many
of its responsibilities and features remain the
same. It assists the United States Operations
Missions and the governments of cooperating
countries in the development and operation
of practical control programs against major
insect pests.
that involve cooperation with international
and. other organizations are also receiving
special attentiOn, particularly in relation to
.locust control.

The work of the Plant Pest Control Branch
is designed to fulﬁll commitments to coun-
tries under the former regional locust con-_
trol program with respect to the training of
pilots, the evaluation of locust problems, and

the demonstration of control Operations,

.where necessary, to meet outbreaks that
threaten the agriculture of countries request-
ing assistance. Major insect problems are
being explored with respect to their adapta-
tion to control operations with hand and

engine powered ground equipment and air:

craft. Technical guidance is being given to
biological control measures in Iran.
effort is made to develop leadership among
the local technicians in applied entomology
through on-the-job training.

In the planning, execution, and operation
. of these programs; close cooperation is main-
tained between the director of the United
States Operations Mission in each country
and the coordinator of the regional project
at Beirut. Their responsibilities have been

carefully outlined and agreed upon. The co- .

ordinator is William B. Mabee, formerly of
the grasshopper control project in this coun-
try. He acts under the direct authority of
the chief of the Plant Pest Control Branch,
and is responsible to the branch for the con-

‘ duct of the program in all its tebhnical as‘

pects. Liaison between the specialists as-
signed to this project and the research agen-
cies of the Department provides the technical
information on which they base their pro-
grams. We now have a staff Of 15, including
pilots, stationed in 6 countries, namely,
Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, and
’ Ethiopia.

RESULTS OF COOPERATIVE CONTROL PROGRAM

In the short period, these insect-control

programs have been underway progress has

been noteworthy. Approximately 250,000
acres have been sprayed from the air for the
control of locusts in these 6 countries during
the last 4: seasons. This amount of spraying
protected food'crops and pastures in more
than 2,500,000 acres. 'Over 10,000 acres were
sprayed for control of rice, sugar cane, and
cotton insects. Several dozen pilots trained
to operate and maintain spray planes have
participated in control programs. Most
”countries have already purchased or con-
template purchasing their own planes for in-
sect control.

Plant protection organizations have taken
a greater interest in the control of locusts and
other insects, and have consequently received
bigger» appropriations from governments for
research and control.
grams has brought hope to the people and
encouraged them to increase their plantings.
The efforts of the various nations have been
better coordinated, a factor that has Contrib-
uted to progress in international cooperation.

These efforts have made it possible for the
personnel attached to the project to direct
their activities to insect problems other than
locusts. The olive ﬂy, sen pest of wheat,
pyrilla of sugarcane, bollworms of cotton,
rice borers, and the like are now being in-
vestigated. Importation of new insecticides
is on the increase. Large-scale ﬁeld demon-
strations are underway With many chemi-
cals heretofore little, known or untried in
most countries.

BENEFITS TO THE UNITED STATES

In addition to the beneﬁts that cooperat-
ing countries are deriving from these pro-
grams, the United States also has a direct
interest in their successful operation. Never
before in the 100 years that entomology had
been recognized as a profession in the United
States have we been so conscious of the need
to know more about foreign insect problems
as they affect us either directly Or indirectly.
We believe that every eﬁort'expended toward
increasing our knowledge of insect enemies
that may sometime reach this country is
worth while. The European corn borer, the
Japanese beetle, and the Mexican boll weevil
are only a few examples. We found it ad-
visable to send entomologists abroad to the
native homes of these species to learn more
about them and their natural enemies. We
have been threatened with such pests as the

. citrus blackfly, the oriental fruit ﬂy, and

more recently the Khapra beetle. We can
appreciate their signiﬁcance if left un-
checked and all that is involved in obtain-
ing funds and cooperation for research and
control. purposes to hold them in ,abeyance.

Firsthand information on foreign pests
obtained abroad can also be helpful toward
improving foreign trade relations with the
United States. Entomologists of Government
land-grant colleges,,and industry have al~
ready played an important role in this con-
nection. Their work abroad has exerted a-
noticeable inﬂuence on the export trade of
our pesticides and farm equipment. Through

'better understanding and familiarity with ‘

these products, foreign pest-control authori-

The future appears brighter for the peo-

better pest control they are blazing trails
which will lead them to a happier, more
healthful existence. With ample food sup-

and cope with the problems of defending

PACIFIC WAR MEMORIAL ON
CORREGIDOR ISLAND

Mr. WILEY. Mr. President, as a
member of the Corregidor Bataan Me-
morial Commission, I read with great
interest the statement made by the
chairman of our commission before the
House Armed Services Committee on
Tuesday, July 15, in connection with a
hearing on Hr. R. 13265. Mr. O’Neal’s
statement was in connection with the
hearings on this bill which will authorize
the commission to accept funds from
the Secretary of the Navy which may be
received from the sale of certain Old
and obsolete naval vessels as scrap ma-
terial. Many of these old warships saw
service in the Paciﬁc war. ' H. R. 13265,
which was introduced by General Dev-
ereux, was reported favorably by the
House Armed Services Committee and
the following Monday, July 21, it passed
the House. This bill, and a companion
bill, S. 4046, which was introduced by
the Senator from Illinois [Mr. DOUGLAS],
the‘ Senator from Arizona [Mr. GOLD-
WATER] and myself, all members of the
commission, are now before the Senate
Armed Services Committee. In order
that my colleagues may have available
this excellent statement by Mr. Emmet
O’Neal, I ask unanimous consent that
it be printed in the RECORD at this point,
in addition to‘ a listing of many prom-
inent people who support the concept of ,
the Paciﬁc War Memorial on Corregidor
Island.

There being no objectiOn, the ma-
terial was ordered to be printed in’ the
RECORD, as follows:

STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE EMMET O’NEAL,
CHAIRMAN OF THE CORREGIDOR BATAAN ME-
MORIAL COMMISSION BEFORE THE HOUSE
ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE ON H. R. 13265
Mr. Chairman and members of the com-

mittee, the Philippines became a sovereign

nation on July 4, 1946. On October 12, 1947,

the United States, at a formal ceremony re-

turned to the Philippines the last bit Of

Philippine soil which had been under its

control—the island of Corregidor. At the

ceremony on Corregidor, when the American

ﬂag was lowered and the Philippine ﬂag

raised, the American Ambassador (the pres-

ent chairman of this commission) said in
art:

p “Today the United States of America con-

veys to the Republic of. the Philippines the

last tangible bit of America, the island of

Corregidor. It is right that this be done.

But in a deeper sense, Bataan and Corregidor

do not belong solely/to any one country,

even to the'heroic Philippines. * * * there
is more to this hallowed spot than what we
here convey, and it is that which belongs
to the ages and (to all men who believe in
human liberty. Nations yet unborn will
strive for freedom and receive strength and
courage from nearby Bataan. Men now liv-

, ing and yet to be born will carry on inspired

by the true meaning of Corregidor. They
are now enshrined in the temple of hope for

 




1958
mankind with Runnymede, Valley Forgeeand
other places where the [ﬁres of freedom were
lighted and kept burning.

“The blood of Americans and Filipinos
mingled, indissolubly in the soil of Bataan
and Corregidor, each defying the forces of
autocracy and slavery. The blood shed by
your sons and our sons cannot be separated
in the hallowed earth of Bataan and Cor-
regidor. * * * This spot will tell the story
to oppressed and groping people how they,
too, can attain liberty by devotion to the
democratic way of life.

“Bataan and Corregidor will ever be beams
to guide liberty-loving people of Asia and
of the world to a way of life which will bring
the greatest good to the greatest number.

May they light the way to freedom for mil- ,

lions who are seeking that which Bataan
and Corregidor so sublimely represent. ”

In order to conserve your time and to ex-
plain clearly the bill before you, I would
like to read this statement." The Corregidor
Bataan Memorial Commission was created by

Congress to erect upon Corregidor an appro-”

priate memorial to all those who served under
the American ﬂag in the Paciﬁc area during
World War II. The Commission is composed
of 9 members: 3 United States Senators, 3
United States Congressmen, and 3 public
'members. They are now as follows: Senators
Wiley, Goldwater, and Douglas; Congressmen
Van Zandt, Devereaux, and Selden; John W.
Haussermann, Firank Hewlett, and Emmet
O’Neal who was chosen by the members to
be Chairman. No member of the Commis-
sion has been paid anything in any way for
his services.

The Commission has been very active, and
in my opinion has accomplished a great deal
to date, and in a most economical way.

, The Commission has worked with the
Philippine Government through its Ambas-
sador, General Romulo, and its National
Shrines Commission.
tional Shrines Commission was directed by
the Philippine Government to work with the
Corregidor Bataan Memorial Commission in
placing a suitable memorial on Corregidor.
They have dedicated Corregidor as a shrine
and are even now taking people there, and
showing them the site of the memorial.
They have ofﬁcially approved the design of
the actual memorial and are delighted with
it. Further they have made independent
studies for the use of the memorial, as, a
living memorial, when completed.
' In order to have an appropriate structure
the Corregidor Bataan Memorial Commission
has sought the cooperation of the architects
of the United States.

The advisory architect of the Commission

is Mr. John F. Harbeson of the ﬁrm of
Harbeson, Hough,‘ Livingston‘ & Larson,
- Philadelphia. He is recognized as one of the
leading men in his profession... Under his
direction the Commission conducted a com-
petition among the architects of the United
States, in which 43 well~ known men or ﬁrms
participated. ,
, The designs in the competition Were sub-
mitted anonymously, so that there would be
no favoritism. In the ﬁrst stage of the com-
petition 5 designs were selected as the best,
and a second stage was held, in which the
5 winning architects competed with 5 of the
most outstanding architects who were espe-
cially invited to compete. The jury of 11
which recommended the winner was com-
posed of 8 very prominent and nationally
known men in the architectural ﬁeld, and
the other 3 men were Fleet Adm. Chester W.
Nimitz, Gen. Walter Krueger, and Gen.
George C. Kenny. , The chosen Chairman
was Mr. Pietro Belluschi, dean of the School
of Architecture and Planning, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology. The Commission
accepted the decision .of the jury, and its
selection has received many words of ap-
_ proval from competent authorities as well
as the Philippine Government.

This Philippine Na- «

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —- SENATE

May I take a few moments to refresh your
recollection as to the basic concepts of the
Corregidor memorial. '

It will be a symbol to every participant in
the Paciﬁc war both in the United States
and the Philippines of the months and years
of his service and sacriﬁces in the preserva-
tion of liberty against an aggressor bent on
conquest, tyranny, and enslavement. To
such a veteran, and there are over 4 million
of them in every part of the United States, it
will be deserved recognition of each one’s
service to his country. Primarily it will be a
reminder and record of those who gave their
lives to preserve freedom in the werld.

It will be a sensitive and appropriate rec-
ognition of the most remarkable feat of
arms in the world’s history, America’s par-
ticipation in World War II, undertakennot
for conquest.

The Philippines were a part of the United
States until July 1946, almost one-third of
our existence up to that time. It will be a
symbol to every. Filipino who sees it, and
they will be numbered by countless thou-
sands, of our understanding and apprecia-
tion of that long association unique in the
annals of history. It will make clear our
recognition of the price the Filipinos paid

through 4 long years for remaining true to

the United States and the cause of democ-
racy. That deliberate choice caused them to
suffer more loss of life than the combined
losses of the American forces in both the
European and Paciﬁc areas combined. Fur-
ther, it had deep meaning and will have far-
reaching inﬂuence that an Oriental nation,
the Philippines, decided to stand by' an Oc-
cidental nation, the United States, against
another Oriental nation.

' The memorial will stand on the sacred soil
of Corregidor in the shadow of nearby Ba-

taan, where commingled the blood of Fili-

pinos and Americans. .Manila is the cross-
roads between the East and the West, and
only a relatively short distance from the
mainland of Asia. Those who travel by air
will see it, and all ships going to; or from
Manila must pass close to Corregidor. At
night a perpetual shaft of light will carry its
message far out across the China Sea. Its
meaning will be clear to Asiatics, and we be-
lieve that it'will be understood as a dedica-
tion of democratic peoples to the cause of
peace and freedom.

All Corregidor will actually be a memorial.
Malinta tunnel, the headquarters of the
United States Army and the Capitol of the
Philippines in the early days of the war will
be restored by the Philippine Government.
The memorial ediﬁce will have appropriate
sculpture, and so built that it may house
libraries and the memorabilia of the war in
the Paciﬁc.

If our country through this Commission
and the architects can place upon Corregidor
the type of symbolic memorial we are trying
to create, it will reach the minds and hearts
of millions of people who do not know and
little appreciate the real United States. It
may sound chauvinistic but something un-

heard of has risen in the world in recent

years—an entire nation going to war on two
occasions with its majOr objective the free-f
dom and happiness of other nations. There
was no thought of conquest of others, but
there was on the part of the people of the
United States an awareness that we were
sure to suffer great loss of life and stagger-
ing ﬁnancial burdens for- years to come. It
is true that we evaluated the impact upon
our future of the defeat of free nations by
dictators, but irrespective of that, I believe,
the United States fought primarily\t9 help
other nations to live as free men.

The decision of the Philippines; to stand
with us was built upon their conﬁdence af-
ter almost 50 years of association, in the
truth and fairness of the democratic way of
life, as cherished and lived by the United
States.

. that

The presence 'of this memorial on Philip-

~pine soil will be an aid in enlightening Asia

and the world as to demoCracy and the char-
acter of America. In my opinion all that we
do in monetary assistance as a part of our
foreign policy will be short of our objectives
until the nations we help understand the ,
United States. We can do more to bring
about that understanding than is being
done. ’-

We are conﬁdent that with the actual me-
morial and the living memorial we can make
a very important contribution to that end.-

This memorial will be placed by the
United States not in Washington or some
other American city for the ediﬁcation of
ourselves, but on Asiatic soil which will
mean a great deal to all Asiatics. Such a
tribute on foreign soil is somewhat unique,
and cannot fail to better explain to the
world, especially Asia, what is the truth as
to the real America, as an exemplar of de-
mocracy.

We do pot intend to let it rest there. This
sensitiVe symbol will become and be used
as a living memorial. We have done a great
deal of work to develop activities under the
aegis of the Corregidor Bataan Memorial
whiCh we believe will do much to offset the
effect of the all-out Communist effort in
the Far East. We have an invaluable asset
in the friendship of the Philippines, a dem-
ocratic nation, just as Russia has in Com-
munist China. In my opinion this is not
fully evaluated nor adequately utilized.
Russian communism, according to authori-
ties is daily gaining ground in Asia, largely
accomplished in the name and with the
assistance of China. We have reason to be-
lieve that we can secure active cooperation
and abundant ﬁnancial support which will
make the actual memorial when completed, -
continue to serve effectively as a living force.
It is consonant with a memorial in the spirit
“these dead ‘shall not' have“died in
vain.” /

The things of which I have spoken are
authorized by. legislation” heretofore ap-
proved by Congress, and are not a part of
the bills before you.

Several identical bills are with your com-

‘mittee which will make it possible to start

the erection of the memorial at once. The
passage of this measure, now, will save from
3 to 4 years in getting started. «

Twenty-nine, ships ' which .saw- distin-
guished service in World War II are now in
moth balls awaiting an inevitable ognomini-
ous end in the junk pile. The Navy states
that they will not be of further service to
our» country or anyone, and it is empowered
to dispose of them. The cost of their main-
tenance is approximately $3 million to $4
million a year. If not junked for the next
3 or 4 years they could entail an expense of
$9 million to $12 million. Every American
must feel some regret that the ships will no
longer serve the cause for which they were
built, and ﬁnally lose their identity in the
junk pile.

The bills before you will preserve their
identity, and permit them to continue to
serve in the cause of freedomand democ-
racy. The congressional members on the
commission introduced these bills to permit
the use of the funds from the salvage of the
vessels to be applied to the erection of the
memorial on Corregidor. It is .. further
planned that as much of the steel as is‘
needed from the ships, shall be the steel of
which the memorial will be built. So the
memorial framework will be of steel which
served as ships in World War II. The Com-
mission intends to preserve and install some
of the identiﬁable parts of the ships as a
part of the memorabilia of the greatest feat
of arms in the history 'of mankind, World
War II. There will also be included .m the
memorial, memorabilia of the Army, Marine
Corps, and Air Corps.

 




14076

You have heretofore appropriated the
money for the building of these ships and
the use of a part a6f the proceeds from the
sale of the ships, is not exactly on all fours
with a new appropriation; it is rather a re-
, direction of the money heretofore appropri-
ated. I would not be completely frank with
the committee if I did not admit that as far
as the balance sheet is concerned, the result
is the same.

The memorial when completed will be es-
sentially a plea for peace and freedom in
the world, and the use of the steel and other
partsof the vessels will be in the spirit, of
the Biblical quotation:

“And they shall beat their swords into

plowshares and their spears into pruning
hooks.” ‘
’ The Corregidor Bataan Memorial Com-
mission is almost a congressional committee,
since of the 9 members 6 must be Members
of Congress. In the actual memorial and in
the active continuing use of it as a living
memorial, we trust and believe that it will
be of incalculable value to the cause of bet-
ter international understanding between the
East and the West. .

SUPPORTERS OF THE PACIFIC WAR MEMORIAL ON
CORREGIDOR ISLAND "

President Quezon, during the tragic days

of the war stated that Corregidor should be

preserved as a memorial.

Every other Philippine President, Rojas,
' Quirino, Mag’saysay, and Garcia have been
deeply interested in our efforts to place a
memorial on Corregidor and given their sup—
port. The Government of the Philippines set
aside C‘orregidor to be preserved as a shrine,
and created the Philippine National Shrines
Commission. It was directed to work with

‘1 the Corregidor Bataan Commission and has

done so enthusiastically. It has ofﬁcially
and unanimously expressed its full endorse-
ment of the concept and plans for the con-
struction of the memorial. The members
have individually and collectively expressed
their unqualiﬁed appreciation of the winning
design and ofﬁcially approved it. They have
stressed the great desire of the Filipino
public to see the proposed memorial erected
soon.

The Honorable Eulogio Balao, when Sec-
retary of Defense, stated, “I hope very soon,
we shall see standing on Corregidor a living
symbol of the gallant struggle.”

’ The Honorable CarlOs Romulo said, “It is
for this reason that we in the Philippines
are happy to know that the ,United States
Government has created a Corregidor-
Bataan Memorial Commission and that
plans are underway—and we sincerely hope
they can be carried out soon-to build ame-
morial with Corregidor as its pedestal.

‘Done with proper sensitivity, this memorial
'will be a perpetual beacon light to show the
world the road to peace." On July 17, 1958,

he said, “you are rendering an incalculable-r

service to the cause of Philippine- ~American
friendship. "

The Defenders of Bataan and Corregidor,
the representative veterans' group in the
Philippines has written in part as follows:

“The Veterans Organization in the Philip-
pines will be eternally grateful for the mag-
niﬁcent plans you have for the monument.
* * * I can only say that they are with me
100 percent behind the idea. ”

The COIregidor-Bataan Veterans Associa-

. tion in the United States has discussed plans

to hold its annual reunion on Corregidor .

when the dedication occurs.

General MacArthur said in a letter to the
Chairman: S

“It is indeed a most worthy purpose. For
no soil on earth is more deeply consecrated
to the cause of human liberty than is that of
the island of Corregidor and adjacent
Bataan Peninsula. There, American and
Filipino blood is intermingled to immortalize

that gallant stand taken 7 to resist against
desperately overwhelming odds the onrush of
the forces of despotism which sought to blot
the concept of freedom from the face of the
earth.

“I am quite conﬁdent that you will ﬁnd
among our countrymen few who will hesi-
tate to support the erection upon that hal-
lowed ground of so suitable a memorial to
those who there fought and bled and died
in desperate resolve that liberty should
live.”-

Fleet Adm. Chester W. Nimitz has en-
dorsed wholeheartedly the proposal and
served on the jury of award which selected
the winning design for the memorial.

Gen. Jonathan M. Wainwright wrote as
follows:

“Even while the ﬁghting was going on. I
visualized such a thing in the future, and of

course, I am more than interested in seeing , .

the project go through. ”

Major General Moore, who surrende 1ed the
C’orregidor forces said.

“I feel that such a symbol erected on that
hallowed ground would exert a deep in-

\ ﬂuence throughout the Far East and impress

upon all who see it the unselfish ideals of
American democracy.”

I could quote similar statements from
Gen. A. M. Jones, one of the commanding
generals on Bataan; General Krueger, who
commanded the .Army ground forces, and
General Kenny, who commanded the Army
Air Corps, both served on the jury of award
and are giving their support toﬂthe cause.

'No effort has been imade to collect en-
dorsements and these are but a few of many
statements agreeing with the goal of the
Commission.

HUMANE METHODS OF SLAUGHTER
OF LIVESTOCK

The Senate resumed the consideration
of the bill (H. R. 8308) to establish the

use of humane methods Of slaughter of

livestock as a policy of the United States,
and for other purposes. .

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. TAL-
MADGE in the“'chair). The question is
on agreeing to the committee amend-
ment in the nature of a substitute.

Mr. PURTELL. Mr. President, I favor
the enactment of effect1ve humane
slaughter legiSlation, and I strongly fa-
vor the utilization of humane methods
of slaughter in this country as soon as
possible. I am opposed to the proposed
delay through further study of this
matter. I am sure that all the members
of the Agriculture Committee would like
to see humane slaughter practiced in this
country, but I disagree with the pro—
cedure the committee suggests in order
to achieve this objective.

Two more years of study, as provided
for in the bill reported by our commit-
tee, I believe to be absolutely unneces-
sary. I understand that way back in
. 1929, the meatpacking industry promised
humanitarians that it would voluntarily
install humane methods. Are we to as-
sume that the industry has been stud'y— ,
ing this matter since that date? Com-
pulsory legislation on the subject, I be-
lieve, was ﬁrst introduced in 1955 by my
colleague, the junior Senator from Min-
nesota , [Mr. HUMPHREY]. I wonder
whether that occaSioned the hastening
of the industry’s study of this matter.
If so, I imagine the study has somewhat
slackened since June 718 of this year,
when our Senate Agriculture Committee
reported a bill which now would have
the Agriculture Department study the

ment need to have a congressional di—
rective before it could study this prob-

proposed legislation was ﬁrst introduced,
and I am inclined to think that the De—
partment spent more of its time in writ-
ing adverse reports on the several bills
on the subject than it devoted to study
and constructive thinking as to how best
to put into practice humane methods of
slaughter.

Study by the industry, study by the
Agriculture Department, study by a com-
mission. To paraphrase, it would seem
that we are going to have “Study, study
everywhere, but not a lamb to spare”
from the cruelty of inhumane slaughter.

The more one studies this study idea,
the more apparent it becomes that such
a procedure is totally unnecessary and is
simply a substitution of wasted time for
ready and needed action. I keep asking
“ myself, “What are they going to study?”
Surely, not how to develop means to be
used in the practice ofuhumane slaugh-
ter.
ner, the captive—bolt pistol, and the use
of carbon dioxide, we already have the

They need not do so.

from $100 to $200, are available. I, am
advised that when the slaughter—ani-
mals inhale carbon dioxide, there is an
absence of struggle and a resultant ﬁre-
duction to a minimum of meat wastage.
I understand that the bruising caused by
inhumane methods of slaughter causes
the waste of many millions of dollars’
worth of meat, annually. Some packers
who already/ use humane methods. in
their plants, have thus found them more

economical than the cruel methods still'

employed ‘by‘ the majority of packers.
' Mr. President, try as I may, I cannot

conjure up any phase of the proposed _

legislation Which would constitute the
slightest excuse for further study.

, I want briefly to touch upon the ad-
verse reports received from the Depart-
ments. Of course, all of them state that
. they favor humane slaughter, “but,” and

then follow their reasons for opposing .

the enactment of an effective bill. I
would wager that afte1 2 years of furthe1
study, their reasons for opposition would
remain unchanged. ' I believe that wise
administration of the law we propose
would dissipate these objections.

One Department objects “that the use
of electrical means for stunning or kill-
ing animals can result in the formation
of toxic substances in the tissues of the
beasts so treated.”

The answer to this objection is quite
simple. The Secretary of Agriculture
would not, and should not, approve this
method of slaughter if the effects be as
indicated by the Department." Such a
determination is authorizedthe Secre—
tary, under our proposal. Certainly,
none of us here proposes the mandatory
use of any method which would result in
making the meat unﬁt for human con-
sumption.

One Department objects that—-

Large packers, for whom Government sup-
.ply represents only a. small percentage of
,, their production, might be willing to forego
this percentage rather than to make expen-
sive changes in their systems or install

methods, which could, after the further re-
search provided for in the bill, be found to
be unacceptable to the Secretary of Agricul-
ture.

First, I should like to say that I do not
believe that these packers will forgo the
Government business. But if, in order
to keep from reducing their proﬁt by

'what I would judge to be a relatively

inﬁnitesimal amount) they did forgo
selling to the Government, then I would
say, “Shame. on all their slaughter-
houses.” If they did boycott, selling to
the Government, rather than practice

humane slaughter, then it would not be;

beyond the realm of possibility that
they, too, might be boycotted by the
consumers when they make their pur-
chases at the meat counters.

The objection I have just quoted would
also presume that humane slaughter
methods would be in a constant ﬂux of
change, like thestyles in'ladies’ dresses.
Of course we would wish to put into
effect developed improvements in hu-
mane slaughter; but certainly wise and
fair administration of the law would ob-
viate the possible hardship this Depart-
ment dreams up.

I could go on and on contesting the
Departmental objections, but I shall
leave this subject by reminding my col-
leagues that Departmental reports on
proposed legislation are notsacrosanct.
”Our committees request the reports.
Many times the recommendations con-
tained in the reports are most helpful,
and at times they are essential.
all of us know that many times we in
Congress do not agree with the views
expressed by the Departments, and we
forthwith pass the proposed legislation
in question.

I am Convinced that we now have be-
f01e us a proposal which should be fa-
vorably ‘ acted upon by the Senate,
despite the insubstantial reasons offered
in opposition by the Departments.

Mr. President, in this proposed legis-
lation not only are we providing for hu-
mane treatment for the animals to be
slaughtered, but at the same time we
are giving proper consideration to the
workers in the packing ﬁrms, who other-
wise must inﬂict needless, and gruesome
cruelty in ‘ the performance of their
jobs—or, at least, until such time as
seniority gives them a most welcome
escape to more civilized duties.

I know there has been some objection
on religious grounds‘to this bill and to
other pending humane-slaughter legis-
lation." Our substitute, as did the origi-
nal“ bill which I cosponsored, provides
that slaughtering in accordance with
the requirements of any religious faith
shall be considered an approved method
of slaughtering. Certainly, Mr. Presi»
dent, I would not support this proposed
legislation if I were not convinced that
it would safeguard, and would not make
encroachments on, the rituals or re-

quirements of any religious faith.

. In closing my remarks, Mr. President,
I touch upon a sentimental note: I am
sure that many of my colleagues who

have ever owned a dog as a pet and a,
friend, and countless thousands of other

doglovers throughout, America, vicari-
ously experienced qualms when they

/’

But -

read about the Russian dog Laika
which was entombed alive in Sputnik,
to suffer the cruelty of death by starva-
tion.

Whether a mouse, a guinea pig, or
some other animal less cloSe to man
would have served the purpose, I do not
know. But, at least, 'Mr. President, there
was a deﬁnite, and I assume, useful pur-
pose in this cruel death for Laika. I ask
my colleagues toexperience some qualms
now over the‘needless, and without pur-
pose, gruesome cruelty being practiced
in this country at this very moment in
the slaughter of animals.

I think the time is well passed when
we should give continued, furthe1 studies
to the subject, but we should adopt pro-
visions as contained in the 'House bill. \
Now is the time to act. I hope the Senate
will so act.

Mr. KEFAUVER. Mr. President, cru-
elty of a kind which would not be tole-
rated in the public view has gone on too
long in many slaughterho-uses. I have
witnessed the slaughter of pigs by the ,
standard method, heard the terrible
screaming as the animals are dragged,
aloft hanging by one foot, seen the grim.
struggle when the sticker knifes .them,
and observed in this whole barbarous
procedure a combination of pain and
terror for animals and danger and deg-
radation for [men which ought to have
been stopped long ago in the United

States of America. I know that‘it cane ‘

be stopped because I have also seen hogs,
slaughtered without a squeal, without
even so much as a drop of blood splash- 7
ing on the sticker, without any offthe-
brutal and nauseating - occurrences
which standard hog slaughter and all
standard slaughtering entail. These
hogs were anesthetized so that they felt
neither pain nor fear. «The men operated
quietly, accurately, and unhurriedly, and.
yet killed hogs at a faster rate than be—
fore. The hogs rode on a moving belt
into a tunnel containing 65“‘percent car-.
bon dioxide, and after about ﬁve breaths
became unconscious. More than 15 mil-
lion hogs have been anesthetized in tun-
nels of this kind in the past 7 years.
The method is a proven one in use in six
different plants under Federal meat in-
spection. The time has come to put an
end by law to the cruel old method. ,_
Legislation to make humane slaugh-l
tering ' mandatory will not harm any
packer, whether he be one of the giants
or whether he operates one of the small-
est rural plants. In my experience, the
little people in this industry are way
out in front in the humane killing of
food animals. Many a small plant is
killing every one of the animals it re-;

'ceives by a method fully in compliance
.with the bill as passed by‘the House of

Representatives, that is, by rendering
the animal insensible with a single gun-
shot prior to shackling, hoisting, and
sticking. It is time those packers who
kill the majority of our livestock took
a pageout of the books of these ﬁne, .
humane, small plants and stopped the
protracted cruelty they are now prac-
ticing for no good reason.

Mechanical stunners can be». used for
the humane slaughter of every kind of
meat animal, ‘and I have looked into

 




\14078

their prices. The cost of the gun or
stunners is very small, and the ammuni-
tion costs 2 to 4 cents an animal—a
small price to pay to substitute mercy
for cruelty. ‘But in this case kindness
pays in dollars and cents, too. Packers
who are using these stunners have found
that they are saving money because they
reduce injuries to men 'and \animals
alike, increase blood recovery, and
slaughter more rapidly. The obligation
to use humane slaughtering methods
could not put any packer, small or large,
out of business.
With humane methods readily avail-
. able and in use daily in that 1egrettably
small proportion of plants which are
voluntarily considerate and kind, I sub—
mit that it is time to pass forceful hu-
mane slaughter legislation
- I know there may be some amend-

-House- bill. It, seems to me that the
religious section of the House bill, sec--
tion 6, is fully adequate, but if it can
be tightened or enlarged, I am certain
the sponsors of the House bill will be
glad to have that done. In any event, if
the committee amendment is accepted,
there will not be an opportunity of im-
proving the House bill now so as to

eliminate any of the complaints about-

it or make it more acceptable to the"
Congress.

do something in this ﬁeld rather than
make a fu1ther study.

Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, will
the Senator, yield?

Mr. KEFAUVER. I yield.

Mr. HUMPHREY. J Technical amend-
ments will have to be/oﬂfered to the House

provisions because of the change in dates.
If there need be any further improve-
ments, they Certainly can be made when
the Senate conferees meet with the House
conferees.

. Mr. KE‘FAUVER. As I understand,
there are no penalties provided in the bill
except in relation to food prOduCts pur-
chased by the United States Government.

Mr. HUMPHREY. The Senator is cor-

- rect. Also, everything provided for in
the Senate committee amendment in
termsof study is also contained in the bill
as it came from the House, which is the
bill the Senator f1 om Tennessee and I are
supporting.

Mr. KEFAUVER. I had the opportu-
nity of visiting the I—Io1mel plant in the
Senator’s State. I believe an executive
of the plant testiﬁed before the com-
mittee’that the humane technique used
actually decreased the labor costs in the
plant. Is that correct?

Mr. HUMPHREY. The Senator is ab—
solutely correct. The witness further ad—

vised the committee as to the increased

_ eﬁ‘iciency of the plant, which I suppose
is related to the reduction of labor costs.

Mr. KEFAUVER. Is it not true that
even for a small packer there are other
methods of stunning an animal into in-
sensibility made available by Reming-
ton Rand, or an electric company, which
methods are comparatively inexpensive?

Mr. HUMPHREY. The Senator is
correct. It is interesting to note that the
complaints about the bill We are support-
ing come not from the smaller packers,
but from the larger ones. The com-

It is certainly time that we .

plaints come from the packers most able
to afford the cost of installing such tech-
niq-.ues

Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I had
not intended to discuss the bill at this
stage, because I felt the debate as be-
tween the so-called study bill and the
substantitve matters which are raised by
the House bill would turn upon other
arguments, some of which have been
made before in thisdebate. For, ex—
ample, there is a difference of opinion,
as I understand, whether, as a matter
of fact, the methods prescribed by the
House bill are demonstrably humane;
and there \are various other questions.

At the very outset of the discussion
of the committee amendment, which is

der consideration, and about which
I thought the debate would be on totally

. , different grounds, a question was raised
ments which should be adopted to the

on which I have some special knowledge.
Hence, I feel impelled to share with,the
Senate my information upon that sub-
ject. I think it is important that every

Member of the Senate, when "he votes;

shall understand the situation, inasmuch
as the question has been raised. So I
speak, not in a sense of advocacy, but
in the desire to put before the Senate
a state of facts about which I feel the
Senate needs to have knowledge, the sub-
ject having been broached.

As everybody kno-,ws I come from an
area of the United States in which there
is a very large population interested in
the religious aspects of slaughtering.
I, myself, as everyone also knows, am

of the Jewish faith; I have had some

personal experience with this whole
matter

First, there is no doubt of the fact
that humaneness in the slaughtering of

animals is a long-standing tradition of

the Hebrews, "going back to “the time of
Moses.
today, I think very graciously, when the
Senat01 from Oregon pointed out that
one of the qualiﬁcations which Moses
had which made him ﬁnd favor in the
eyes of the Lord was his kindness to
animals. We are all familiar with the
rebellion of Moses against the cruelty
practiced on animals in those days by
the Egyptians.

This tradition came down through
history, and was advocated by various
prophets and great leaders in my faith,
down to the time of Maimonides, almost
within reach of. modern times, who
repeated all these precepts and tradi—
tions. Hence it is that one of the
orthodox Hebrew faith will not eat
meat which has not been slaughtered
according to very carefully designed
ritualistic practices. Those have all
been testiﬁed to in the greatest detail
before the Senate committee. I think
it is fair to say, and I think the Senator
from Minnesota will agree, it was dem-
onstrated that the methods of slaughter
which are called Shehitah, or Kosher
slaughter, represent human methods of
slaughter which have been developed
through the centuries with the greatest
ritualistic care, and with careful atten«
tion to the character as well as the quali-
ﬁcations of those who engage in the
practice, and who have a training which
is equivalent to that, of the Rabbinate,

I

It was referred to in the Senate ,

July 29

and who in many cases are themselves
rabbis.

Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, will
the Senator yield? "

Mr. JAVITS. I yield.

Mr. HUMPHREY: I said earlier, and
now wish to repeat, that during the hear-
ings in May of 1956, because the subject.

.matter of kosher slaughter came before

the committee, we asked for scientiﬁc
information relating to the matter. A
substantial body of evidence was pre—
sented, which is in the ﬁles of the Com-
mittee on Agriculture and Forestry, and
was included by reference'in our report.

I concur fully with what the Senator
has stated. Not only is such a procedure
accepted as a humane method of slaugh—
ter, but it is so established by scientific
research.

Mr. JAVITS. M1. President, I appre-
ciate those comments of my friend. I
might say there has never been any ques-
tion in my mind, and I do not think there
has ever been a question in the mind of
anyone else in the country, as to the per-
sonal disposition of the Senator from
Minnesota toward minorities of whatever
complexion or whatever faith in our
country. ‘ The Senator has a great record
in that respect, and I think it obtains
with respect to our present discussion.

Mr. President, I wish to refer to a book
entitled “Religious Freedom: The Right
To Practice Shehitah, ” written by Rabbi .
Isaac Lewin, RabbiMichael L. Munk, and. _
Rabbi Jeremiah J. Berman.

At page 14 there is a brief statement
which sets forth the fundamental tenets
of the faith which I have" been discussing.
Since it is brief, I Shall take the liberty
of reading it to the Senate:

This universal religious freedom, sanc-
tioned in the above-mentioned historic pro-
nouncements, does not exist for Jews, inas-
much as in a number of countries they are
denied the right to practice Shehitah, their
religiously commanded method of slaughter—
ing animals for food. Since Jews may not,
by the tenets of their aith, eat meat not
slaughtered by, the she itah method, the
legal suppression of the Jewish slaughtering
rite deprives Jews of meat and thus consti-
tutes a grievous form of discrimination.

The legal prescription of Shehitah, is ac-
complished by indirection. The name of the
Jewish rite is generally not employed. The
law requires simply that animals be rendered
unconsciouswbefore being butchered. This
innocent—sounding requirement, however, is
tantamount to outlawing of Shehitah, since
stunning by any method renders a creature
unﬁt for Jewish slaughtering.

Mr. President, the fundamental rea-
son for opposition by those in Jewish
Orthodoxy who testiﬁed before the com-
mittee, I think, is intimately related to
religious freedom, and therefore I think
needs to be laid out and explained, as I
said when I began, by way of informa-
tion for the Senate. The opposition, as
I understand, is based on a concern that
if this practice is cast into the ﬁeld of
legislation, whether the legislation be
positive by way of permission or be neg-
ative by way of exemption, the practice
is placed within the regulatory control
of Government either in the positive or
in the negative form. Thereby it is felt
religious freedom is impaired.

To test the theory out, as a practical
matter and as it would be considered

 




1958

by a lawyer, let us assume that the bill
as it came from the House should pass
and we should have the exemptions
which have been speciﬁed as amend-
ments made in the other body with re-
spect to the method of slaughter. It is
entirely understandable that a Govern-
ment ofﬁcial would wish to be sure that
the exemptions are really being earned.
Such a Government ofﬁcial would have
a right to be sure that the exemptions
claimed were really earned. I believe
it is clear that alone would represent, in
the minds of those who testiﬁed, and I
think it is very important that their
case be laid before the Senate, an~ in-
trusion into religious freedom by an
agency, albeit a Government agency,
and therefore an impairment funda-
mentally, of very deeply held convictions
of faith.

Therefore, the reason the study bill

was moreacceptable—although, as tes- ‘

tiﬁed, the witnesses did not favor any of
the bills—is that at least the study bill
provided a period of .time, in View of
those sponsoring the bill, in which care-
ful deliberation and‘study and experi-
ment might work out some ‘formula
which would resolve the very grave
doubt and concern very deeply and ve1y
sincerely held.

Perhaps if I can leave anything with
the Senate it) should be the depth and
sincerity of this feeling, of which I am
convinced. There is no question about
that point .of View, ,Mr. President.
There is a deep and sincere feeling
among these people. There is a con-
viction of the danger such action as is
proposed would bring, frOm centuries-
01d history of Viewing such action as the
forerunner of oppression which, inci:
dentally, is very eloquently referred to
in the book. from which I have quoted.
In fact, the effort made under therNazis
to suppress Jewish life and practice
through the suppression of ritualistic.
slaughter lives vibrantly in the minds of
millions of people in this country and

millions of people throughout the world».

All these ideas are present with re-
spect to the discussion of the problem
which took place before the committee.
It is interesting to me that the letter

to which my distinguished colleague, the ‘

Senator from Oregon [Mr. NEUBERGER]
referred, from my predecessor, the for-
mer" Senator from New York, Mr. Leh-
man—since it is his seat to which I was
elected—stateshe came, to certain other
conclusions, as well as the conclusion
which was read by my colleague, the
Senator from Oregon [Mr. NEUBERGER].

The Senator from Oregon and Lhave
agreed on the matter, and indeed at his
request I shall ask to have the letter
printed in the RECORD as a part of my
remarks. I should like to read to the
Senate two paragraphs from the letter,
which bear upon what I have just said.
‘ I think the description of the situation
ﬁills out the picture even as former
Senator Lehman saw it.

As I said, in the letter, from which
the Senator from Oregon -[Mr. NEUBER-
GER] read, former Senator Lehman states
he is favorable to some measure of this
character. I desire to quote from page 2
of his letter, as follows:

NJ. 123 “-7-3

"CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

There were, Of course, deep fears among
some Jews—fears born not of years but of
centuries of bitter experience—that the tra-
ditional Jewish rites of slaughter, which
are, in fact, as humane as any animal
slaughter could be, would be endangered.
I have been—-and I know you have been too.

The letter was written to the Senator
from Minnesota [Mr. HUM-PHREY].

I repeat:

I have been—and I know you have been
tOO——deeply concerned to quiet these fears.
Moreover, legislation which casts any kind
of a shadow on religious sensibilities must
naturally be most carefully weighed to make
sure that there is not even the threat of
interference.

Bearing these things in mind, I have tried
to be helpful, as a private citizen, in bring-
ing together some of the Jewish groups
which have been“ concerned and disturbed
by the possibilities I have mentioned; as a"
result of these consultations, as you know,
several suggestions were made to the spon-
sors of this legislation that would have
clariﬁed the legislation as passed by the
House. As you. also know, none of these
proposals had the agreement of all the Jew-
ish community. The leaders of the‘organ-
ized Orthodox groups have continued to op-
pose this legislation in toto. I think you
should also understand that while the or-
ganizations representing the majority of
Americans of Jewish faith found that aden
quate safeguards could be written into "this
legislation, most of them felt that their
interest, as Jewish organizations, had to be
reserved to this protection of Jewish ritual
slaughter.

The PRESIDING OFFICER

(Mr.
JOHNSTON of South Carolina in the

chair). Is there objection to the request
of the SenatOr from New York?

There being no objection, the letter
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
as follows .

JUNE 20,1958.
Senator HUBERT H. HUMPHREY,
Senate Oﬁice Building,
Washington, D. C.

DEAR HUBERT: I have, of course, noted the.

action of the Senate Agriculture Com—
in turning down your humane
slaughtering bill in favor of a study bill. I
have not yet seen a copy of this bill as re-
ported and, since I am just about to leave
for Europe, I will not have an opportunity to

read it unless a copy catches up with me'in .

the course Of my travels abroad.

I regret that our efforts were not able to
result fruitfully up to this point. Natu-
rally, I do not know what ﬁnal action will be
taken on this legislation when and if it is
called up for consideration ‘and debate on
the ﬂoor.

You know, of course, of my interest in the
subject matter. Ever since you introduced
legislation on this subject a number of years
ago while I was still a member of the Senate,
Ivhave indicated my general support for a.
constructive meaSure to accomplish the ob-
jectives you had in mind, provided, of course,
that full and adequate protection was given
to the process of Jewish ritual slaughter. I
know that you have been similarly con-

.cerned with this latter phase of the matter

and have given much study to it.

During the last 6 weeks, as‘you know, I

Jewish ritual slaughter in such a way as to

maintain the protections while insuring that
the general objectives of the legislation are
notirustrated.

Humane treatment of animals is not only
consistent with the Jewish faith, but is, in
fact, mandated by Jewish law and tradition.
I have always felt that legislation in the
direction of the objectives you have outlined,
is not only sound and desirable in itself, but
happily coincident with the traditions of
my particular faith.

There were, of course, deep fears among
some Jews—fears born not of years but of
centuries of bitter experience—that the tra- .
ditional Jewish rites of slaughter, which are,
in fact, as humane as any animal slaughter
could be, would be endangered. I have

deeply concerned to quiet these fears. More-
over, legislation which casts any kind of a -
shadow on religious sensibilities must

naturally be most carefully weighed to make

sure that there is nOt even the threat of

interference.

Bearing these things in mind, I have tried
to be helpful, as a private citizen, in bring-
ing together some of the J evsnslf grﬁups which
have been concerned and disturbed by the
possibilities I have mentioned; as a result of
these consultations, as you know, seVeral
suggestions Were made to the sponsors of
this legislation that would have clariﬁed the
legislation as passed by the House. As you
also know, none of these proposals had the
agreement of all the Jewish community.
The leaders of the organized orthodox groups "
have continued to Oppose this legislation in
toto. I think you should also understand ,
that while the organizations representing the .
majority of Americans of Jewish faith found
that adequate safeguards could be written
into this legislation, most of them felt that
their interest, as Jewish organizations, had
to be reserved to this protection of Jewish/
ritual slaughter. They did not feel justiJ
ﬁed in taking any stand on the overall pur- ,
poses of the bill. ,

However, I want you to know, Should the
question come up in the course of debate or
other consideration of this legislation, that -
in my judgment, for what it is worth, your
bill, with adequate protection for Jewish
ritual slaughter—with the Anfuso amend-
ment as it could, and should be modiﬁed—-

not only represents no real threat to the? ~

sensibilities of my faith, but is, indeed, con-
sistent with the objectives Of humanenessr-
which are honored in the Jewish faith and '
tradition as well as in others. _ ’

I hope that the, remaining weeks of this
session of the Senate will not be too stren- ‘
uous and that you and all my friends on the
Hill will have a good summer.

With kindest personal regards,

Sincerely,
HERBERT H. LEHMAN.

Mr JAVITS. Mr. President, I have
made this request with the complete
concurrence of my distinguished col-'
league, the Senator from Oregon.

I have a heavy responsibility in this
matter. There is no question about the
fact that very, very large numbers of
people in my State feel as the Senator ,
from Minnesota does. Moreover, I think
the people of my State ,expect me in
the deepest conscience to do whatever I
can to protect the deeply held religious
convictions of a minority, no matter how
small, because this is a very funda-
mental principle of our society.

It is in this situation I ﬁnd myself at
the present time. I_ might say, in all
frankness, like any Other modern hu-

" man being, I have a deep sympathy for

the new methods and the ideas which

 




I’"14080.

a1e put forWard in the proposal of the
Senator from Minnesota [Mr. HUMPH-
REY], which came to the Senate from
the House of Representatives.

I feel, Mr. President, that since the
subject has been raised—ﬂankly, I
hoped it would not be raised, because I
did not feel it was germane to the ques-
tion whether the Senate should vote up
or down the committee amendment—4t
was my duty, knowing something about
the matter, knowing some of the funda-
mental facts, and having some of the
spi1itual elements in my own heart, to
lay before the Senate the factual infor—
matioffwith which every Senator can do
as he pleases in his own good conscience.
I felt at least the information should be
available to Senators. .

. Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, W111
the Senator yield?

Mr. JAVITS. Iyield.

Mr. HUMPHREY. First, I wish to ex-
press my personal thanks to the Senato1
from New York for his very constructive
contribution to this discussion and to the
legislative history of this propoSal.

I am sure the Senator from New York
knows that the problems to which he
has referred, relating to the religious-
freedom aspects of this legislation, are
problems which have been very close to
my heart. I do not wish to be senti-

- . mental about it, but I have spent many

hours in consultation with‘ spiritual
leaders of Jewish orthodoxy, leaders for
whom I have the highest regard and
greatest affection. While I may be mis—
taken—and I hope and pray that ‘I am
not—I do not believe there is anything
in the proposed legislation whichwould
do injury to anyone’s religious belief. If
there were, I would be the ﬁrstto advo-
cate its repeal and, abolition from the
statute books. I can think of nothing
that would be more disastrous to the
good name of the UnitedStates than f01
us to indulge in any item of legislation
which smacks of intolerance or of denial
of the basic rights, particularly the right
of religious fre.edom I have said that
before, and I reiterate it.

Again the Senator from New York has
made a very helpful presentation, for
which I am most grateful.

Mr. JAVITS. I thank the Senator
- f10m Minnesota.

This is a‘ rather interesting situation.

i ' , We are in, the midst of tremendous world

struggles, and there arises a question
which is outside the area of those strug-
‘ gles; and which brings forth certain
springs of consciousness and spiritual
feeling which will perhaps decide
whether we shall be able to meet those
challenges.”

I should like to ﬁnish. my exposition to
the Senate by stating that, just as I have
spoken of the deep sincerity and convic—
tion, in terms of religious faith, of those
who spoke from the standpoint of Jewish
orthodoxy, and who testiﬁed before the
committee, so I want the Senator from
Minnesota to know that I feel that he,
too, in everything he is doing, is pro-
ceeding with the same deep spiritual

and religiousconviction. If views differ, .

the difference is only in the end result
., at which two minds arrive. It is cer-
tainly not adifference in depth of feel-

ing, which in both cases is' profound and
sincere.

Mr. NEUBERGER. Mr. P1 esident, as
we nea1 the time when the Senate is
to vote on this important and eventful
measure, which is of such signiﬁcance
to many people in the country, I ex-
press the hope that the House version
will be passed by the Senate.

I should like to call one thing to the

attention of the Senator from New York.

[Mr. JAVITS] , who has made such a mov-
ing and eloquent statement on the ﬂoor
of the Senate today. The three spon-
sors of the original Senate bill were the
distinguished Senator from Minnesota
[Mr. HUM‘PHREY], the distinguished Sen-
ator from Connecticut [Mr. P'URTELL],
and myself.

I think it is of some enduring im-

portance, in the light of the fact that
a. religious issue has been discussed in
the Senate today, that the three mem-
bers of the Senate who were the spon-
sors of the bill and who originally of-
fered it in the Senate, represent three
of the, great religious faiths. ‘One is a
Protestant, another a Catholic, and the
third a Jew. They represent three of
the major religious groups in our coun-
try. I think that fact may be of some
symbolic signiﬁcance since, as the Sen“-
ator from Minnesota has said, there is
absolutely no intention on the part of
the proponents of theproposed legisla-
tion to discriminate against any religious
group whatsoever, or to conﬂict with
the abiding principles of any faith.
“ I thank the Senator from New York
f01 the statement he has made, and the
eloquent and persuasive and very fair
way in which he made it.

I shall not take much time, because

, the issue has been thoroughly discussed.

However, I wish to mention. one fact.
During the past few weeks there has
been some ridicule by reason’ of the Cir-"-
cumstance that so much mail has been
received by Members of the Senate in be-
half of humane slaughter legislation. I
even read an article in the New York
Times in which it was stated that the

President of the United States had re-

ceived more mail in connectiOn with
humane slaughter legislatiOn than. on
almost any other issue. This, of course,
was prior to the military crisis in the
Middle East.

Mr. President, Iam proud to be a citi-
zen of a country whose people care about
such [an issue. This is not the ﬁrst time
such an issue has arisen. . There was a
time when women who were supposed to
be fashionably dressed wore egret plumes
in their hats. That was regarded as a
sign of great aﬂiuenCe and elegance on
the part of the husbands or other escorts
of the women who wore egret plumes.

Great writers in the ﬁeld of nature and
wildlife wrote about the torture inﬂicted
on those birds, when the beaters went
through the swamps and tore the magnif-
icent plumes from the egrets while they
were still alive. The swamps of south—
ern California, many of the Southern
States, and of Mexico ran red with the
blood of the adult birds. Then the mink
and otters came and ate the baby, birds

. in the unguarded nests.

That was stopped by legislation before
anyone now a Member of the Senate was

J uly 29

here, except perhaps the distinguished
Senator from Arizona [Mr. HAYDEN].

This is a country in which people care
about things like that. A great Presi-
dent of the United States, Theodore
Roosevelt, cared about the slaughter
of the bison, which once numbered 60
million on the Plains when Lewis and
Clark went West, but which were reduced
to a pitiful few hundred; and even those
few hundred would not have survived
had not Theodore Reosevelt been able
to arouse public opinion to save them,
so that little children may now go to .
zoological parks and see what the bison,
which once~ blanketed the Plains, looks
like.

So, if we are to 1idicule those who write
to us about humane- slaughter legisla-
tion, let me say that I, for one, am glad
to see that the 96 Members of this body
have the honor to represent people who
care about such things. They are my
kind of people.

Recently I read a biography of Dr.
Albert Schweitzer, one of the greatest,
humanitarians of our era or any other
era. He took his medical skills to the
jungles of Africa to try to bring some
measure of treatment and care to people
who had been neglected, people who had
one of the highest infant mortality rates

‘to be found anywhere, and most of whom

had been dying in their early thirties or

‘ f01 ties.

Dr. Schweitzer left the great capitals,
of Europe, where—with his medical
skillmhe could have commanded munif-
icent fees, to go into the African jungles.

Someone once asked Dr. Schweitzer
what. he thought were the marks of a
civilized person. He replied that one of
the three most important and enduring
marks of a civilized person was kindness
to animals. I am willing to let Dr. Albert
Schweitzer pass this moral and ethical
judgment for me.

I am proud to be associated with the ‘
Senator from Minnesota and the Senator
from Connecticut, and to be 1 of the 3
principal sponsors of the bill. The most
important sponsor, who has carried on
the ﬁght for so long, against great odds,
is, of course, the able Senator from Min—
nesota. , .

Mr. President, I shall not speak very
much longer. . I think the case has been
established, and that some very effective
statements have been made.

This is not the ﬁrst country in which
such legislation has been proposed. Hu—
mane-slaughter laws are now in effect
in many countries. Humane-slaughter
lawsﬁwere adopted in Great Britain in
1933; in Norway in 1924; in Sweden in
1937; in Finland in 1934; in Denmark in
1952; in Switzerland in 1874; and in New
Zealand in 1948.

M1. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed in the RECORD at this
point the testimony before the Honse
Committee, which was considering this.
issue in 1957, by Mr. Arnold Mayer, pub-
lic relations director and Washington
staff member of the Amalgamated Meat
Cutters and Butcher Workmen of North
America, whose statement I consider to
be signiﬁcant. It comes from a man who
speaks for many of the workers who ton
in the packinghouses and slaughter-

same committee by Lieutenant Colonel.

D. J. Anthony, chief veterinary ofﬁcer at .

the Brierley Hill Packing Plant, at Staf-

fordshire, England.

There being no objection, the state-
ments were ordered» to be printed in the

TERS AND BUTCHER WORKMEN OF NORTH

Mr. MAYER. May I introduce Mr. Birming-
ham, who is a business agent of, our local 149
in Baltimore, which has a great number of
packinghouses under contract.

Mr. POAGE. We are delighted to have you
here, Mr. Birmingham. You ‘may proceed
and we will be glad to hear from you. ’

Mr. MAYER. Thank you, sir.

My name is Arnold Mayer. I am the pub-

(AFL—CIO) . .

The AMCBW is a labor union" with 350,000

members, organized in more than 500 local‘

unions throughout the United States and
Canada.

The AMCBW and itslocals have, contracts
with thousands of employers in the meat,
retail, poultry, e'gg, canning, leather, ﬁsh
processing and fur industries.

Basically, it is the function of labor unions
to ﬁght cruelty of man against man,
especially in the economic sphere. As

organizations of workers, the unions’ pri-
mary purpose is to protect wage earners.

Thus, through unions, workers guard
themselves against deprivation and poverty
by bringing about an ever—increasing stand-
ard of living. -

‘ Through their unions, workers provide a
degree of job security and the ‘machinery
to handle on-the-job grievances, so that
they will not be at the possibly capricious
mercy of foremen and employers.

Also, through their unions, workers pro-

tect themselves against poverty’in old age, ‘

unemployment, and other eventualities
which may occur through no fault of the
individuals involved.

But organized workers realize that they
are not a group set off by themselves. They
know they are part of. the entire American
community.

Labor unions, therefore, Seek to improve

the conditions of other groups and the en- -

tire community, especially through the sup-
port of socially beneﬁcial legislation and
through community activities. ‘

AMCBW takes part in all of the functions
of labO‘frunions. In collective bargaining, in
legislative activities and in community work,
our union and its local aﬂiliates have sought
to better the liveSWOf our members; labor, in
general, and the community and Nation, as
a whole.

. We fully realize that bettering the lives of
human beings and preventing cruelty of man
‘ against man, must have as a corollary the
prevention of cruelty against animals. This
is one reason why we appear before this
committee today in favor of humane
slaughtering legislation. \ .

Some of the processes in slaughtering

cattle, hogs, and other livestock leave a
great deal to bedesired from the point of
View of humaneness toward animals.
, Today, comparatively inexpensive means
for correcting this situation are available.
.And, we understand, that these means are
completely practical. .

‘ danger to the worker.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —— SENATE

Our other reason for supporting the
humane slaughtering legislation is our con-
cern for the welfare of the workers in the
packinghouse industry. More than 100,000
packinghouse workers are members of our
union.

Many ’of the jobs involved in the current
process of killing hogs and cattle are
dangerous, dirty, and nauseating. The
workers do not like these jobs and generally
want to be moved» to other work in the

’ packinghouse. ~

Probably the most heartily disliked job is
the shackling of hogs. Workers must go into
a small pen Crowded with emotionally dis-
turbed hogs. They must reach down among
the animals to put' a small shackle chain
around one of the hog’s hind legs. The chain
is attached to a rail and the hog is yanked
up into the air, and is pulled to the hog kill.

This operation is not only extremely pain-
ful for the hog; it also provides considerable
The hogs generally
thrash around. Their hoofs are sharp.
Workers are often gouged. Although the
men wear protective. equipment, it is not
completely satisfactory and injuries are
common. ‘

A further danger comes from the great
deal of dust which the terriﬁed hogs kick
up. As a result, pulmonary diseases, such
as tuberculosis and silicosis, are a deﬁnite
health hazard to packinghouse workers on
the shackling job.

The cattle-killing operatiOn is not as
dangerous, but it is still nauseating work
which is not generally desired. The so-called
“knocking” of cattle, whereby a man hits the
animal on the forehead with a hammer, is a
physically demanding job. Great effort is
involved. The pressure of an 8-hour day of
this work is tremendous.

Boththe shackling and the knocking job

would be ended by this legislation. And

them go. '

Our members have had experience with the
captive bolt gun 011 cattle and” the carbon
dioxide tunnel for hogs. They have found
them both tO'be effective and to make for
far better working conditions. ‘ '

In the poultry industry, humane slaugh-
tering legislation will not have much effect
on the industrial hazards. However, the leg-
islation will make for some improved work-
ing conditions. .

Our members have found the electric
knife, whichis already in use in many plants,
to be a practical and humane means of
killing poultry.

packinghouse, workers will be happy to see

For these reasons, Mr. Chairman and gen:
:tleme‘n of the committee, we urge the enact-

ment of mandatory humane slaughtering
legislation. ' ,

We oppoSe the sections of any bill which
allow the interpretation that kosher
slaughter is inhumane. Such a conclusion
about the slaughter of cattle carried out in
acCordance with the ritual of the Jewish
faith is false. '

The ritual provides for the cutting of veins
with an extra-sharp knife——a process, which,
according to scientiﬁc writings, immediately
renders the animal insensible. / .

Because kosher slaughter accomplishes the
same purpose as is sought in these bills, that
is, rendering the animal immediately insena
sible, it should be listed as a humane means
of slaughter. .

Mr. POAGE. We are'yery glad to have had

you, Mr. Mayer.

Mr. Birmingham, would you care to say
something? \

Mr. BIRMINGHAM. No, sir; unless the Com—
mittee would care to ask me some questions
about the slaughtering end because I. have
had 16 years of actual experience in cattle
and hog slaughtering. .

Mr. POAGE. I feel the committee has-seen
slaughtering at ﬁrsthand. It has probably

- 14081
formed its own opinions, as I have, as to the
present methods, but we are delighted to
have any opinions from anyone else that
wants to express them. ~

We are delighted to have you with us and ‘
appreciate your presentation.

Mr. BIRMINGHAM. Thank you, sir.

Mr. POAGE. Now we will hear from Lt. Col. '
David J. Anthony. ~

STATEMENT or D. J. ANTHONY, MRCVS,
DV SM, FRS‘H, CHIEF, VETERINARY OFFICER,
BRIERLEY HILL, AT THE MARSH & BAXTER
HEADQUARTERS PLANT, STAFFORDSHIRE, ENC.-
LAND .

‘ Mr. ANTHONY. Mr. Chairman and gentle-

men, my name is David J. Anthony, chief
veterinary officer at Marsh & Baxter head-
quarters plant, Stafiordshire, England.

In Britain up to the year 1930, humane
slaughter methods were only carried out in
some of the smaller abattoirs, when speed of
killing was not a prime consideration.

The weapOn used was the captive-bolt "
pistol, which is a mechanical poleax. The
larger meat producers were opposed to the
use of the pistol for the stunning of hogs in _
their plants, and the reasons they gave for
not using it-were that it would slow up pro- ,
duction and leave more blood in the meat and
so tend to encourage the growth of spoilage
bacteria. ~ ’ ”

One Of the more progressive bacon curers
ﬁrst had the German electric stunning
method tried out in 1929. It was then in a _
very crude and inefﬁcient state. . '

A year later a new version was tested, and
found to be clean, swift, silent, and most “
efficient. Various tests were made by many
eminent scientists, medical and veterinary,
and the humane societies approved of the
methods. Marsh & Baxter adopted it as a
routine stunner for the smaller animals—-
hogs, boars, sows, calves,:sheep, and lambs;
throughout all their plants in Britain. ,

For cattle they adopted the captive-bolt
pistol, which they had introduced ontrial
at the same“ time. ‘ The result was that other

‘méat traders folldwed suit, and the Humane '

Slaughtering Act of 1933 followed in due
course. From that day to this no British
packer/has even wanted. to go back to the
prehumane methods of killing, because after
20 to 25 years practical experience of pistol
and electricity, they know they are on a.
good thing. '

‘ The introduction of the gas method at the
Hormel plant has been followed with great
interest, and if it was not for the fact that
the Humane Slaughter Act in Britain only
speciﬁcally mentions a “mechanical instru-
ment or electricity,” there is no doubt that
gas plants would have been installed in
many of 'our plants. ,

As it is, we are now awaiting a modifica-

tion in our legislation which will allow
“chemical” methods also to be used. Lead-
ing packers, as well as our humane societies,
are agreed on this, and the Government has '
also indicated its willingness to Change the
law.
\ Even so, there will always be use for the
other methods, where the situation does not
warrant the expense of chemical installa-
tions, or the plant is too small.

Of course, in view of the religious element
involved in the Jewish and Mohammedan
slaughter ritual, our laws provide for that by
complete exemptionirom the provisions of
the act, and in most of the public abattoirs
Where ritual~ slaughter is carried out there is
a special casting box in use. "

This ﬁxes the beast, enables the whole to
be turned on its side, with the animal’s
neck extended in a position for the ritual
slaughterman to do his bleeding, and so
saves the violent fall ontoa concrete ﬂoor
which was once so common a: feature of this
slaughter method.

The controversy over humane slaughter »

with which we in Britain were so familiar in

 




14082

the 1920’s seems to be largely repeating itself
wherever new methods of slaughter are in-
troduced, and I would like to offer a few
remarks based upon over a quarter of a
century’s experience of the use of humane
slaughter methods.

We are told that great damage can be in-
flicted by the captive-bolt pistol on the
animal brain, and so render that article
unsalable.

The captive-bolt pistol is just a mechan-
ical poleax, the bolt being driven by a small
blank cartridge, instead of the less pertain
muscular action of the axman’s arms.

A blunt hammer blow does not mnetrate
the brain, but it does induce hemorrhage
beneath the brain membranes just as the
captive—bolt does.

We ﬁnd the captive-bolt does less damage
to the brain than ever the poleax did. To
penetrate into the brain the bolt. must ﬁrst
pass through the outer layer of bone in the
animal’s, skull, and then the inner layer
forming the roof or cover of the brain‘cavity
or Cranium.

The two layers of tough bone slow down
the speed of, the bolt, and it certainly does
not tear the brain when its end enters the
" brain- box itself.

Some hemorrhage may be caused in many
cases, but the greatest damage to the cattle
brain is done when it is removed from the
brain cavity in the skull by the ﬁngers of
the slaughterman whose job it is to sever the
head from the body.

Throughout the years we have never had
any complaint from the food-consuming
public about cattle brains, nor have we ever
failed to ﬁnd a ready sale for such articles
'in our shops.

’ The captive-bolt pistol can also be used on
all the smaller food animals, such as calves,
sheep, lambs, boars, sows, and hogs.

It is so used by thousands of small butch-
. ers up and down the land, especially in
country districts and places remote from
electric power.

‘ There are two kinds of cartridge manufac—
tured for this pistol, one ordinary for the

smaller stock, and one extra strong for cat-
tle and aged bulls.

We have found no difﬁculty in using this
weapon, nor have we ever had any complaints
from any customer.

In the early days of electric stunner oper-
ations and in order to demonstrate that there
was no injury of a permanent nature caused
to the animal, I once performed a short sur-
gical operation upon some adult and aged
boars, using as an anesthetic nothing but the
electric current from the stunner.

This was done in the presence of three
eminent medical and veterinary scientists.
The animals operated upon were allowed to
fully recover. '

About a month later they were slaughtered
by the electric humane stunner method.
The organs and ﬂesh were carefully scru-
tinized for any ill effects, but there was none.

, Veterinarians working independently of
each other, and in alliance with the phy-
siOlogical departments of various universities,
carried out special tests to try and ﬁnd out
if electrically stunned hogs bled better than
hogs without any stunning.

In each ease the muscle blood content of
the electrically stunned hogs was less than
that of the“ nonstunned. The amount of
blood collected per animal under electric
anesthesia was greater than that collected
without humane slaughter.

The reason was twofold: (a) Not only does
electric stunning by its effect on conscious-
ness completely relax the animal and so
reduce the muscular blood content, but (b)
the comparative lack of violent reﬂex move-
ments after shackling and hoisting enables
the slaughterman to bleed the animal into
the proper receptacle.

‘ In the unstunned hog, the shrieking, ter-
riﬁed animal hangs by one hind leg still
/

fully conscious, kicking and jerking on the
rail violently.

When the knife is inserted, the blood
spurts out and is splashed all over the place,
much of it drying on the slaughter- pen walls
and on the slaughteiman’ s clothing.

Blood is a valuable byproduct, it can be
used for blood—Sausage, or for cattle food,
fertilizer; and dried hog serum is a valuable
source of protein which can be used in man
in cases of excessive protein wastage due to
certain kidney diseases.

Those are only a few Of its uses. It is a
good commercial product, and our plants
cannot afford the wastage resulting from
bleeding a nonstunned. animal even if there
were no Humane Slaughter Act.

One of the commonest diseases found in
the hog lung in our country is virus pneu-
monia, and in meat inspection this has taken
the place once held by tuberculosis, thanks
to the eradication policy which is bearing
such wonderful results.

Hog cholera in our country is classed as
one of the controlled diseases which, like
foot-and—mouth disease, is to be eradicated
Wherever found.

The laws about this disease of hog-cholera
are strictly enforced and every veterinarian,
whatever his job, meat inspection or not,
must not only report this disease to the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food,
but the diagnosis must be completely con-
ﬁrmed without doubt from the Central Vet-
erinary Laboratory of the Government.

To do this the veterinarian ﬁrst discover-
ing signs of disease, say in the course of meat
inspection, or on the farm, must send to the
laboratory sufﬁcient evidence tmestablisli a
complete diagnosis.

Every veterinarian must therefore be quite
familiar with this disease in all its stages.

As a normal rule, hogs coming into bacon
plants for slaughter are naturally bred for
that purpose, and appear to thesender to
be perfectly healthy and able to stand the
journey.

When a case of hog cholera is reported by
a veterinarian in a bacon plant, the disease
will usually be in a fairly early stage. ’He
may ﬁnd advanced cases and chroniccases
in old sows, but the bacon-hog shows an
earlier stage in most of the cases I ﬁnd.

It has been said that these cases show‘

signs in the hog lungs which might cause
a veterinarian to confuse hog cholera with
lesions resulting from excessive use Of cur-
rent in electric stunning.

Such statements have never been made
by those of us whose job it is to diagnose
disease in plants where electric stunners
have been in use over a quarter of a, century.

I know of no veterinarian in Britain who
would be so ignorant of the signs of hog

cholera in the lung as to make the mistake '

of confusing it with electric-stunning hemor-
rhages. The argument just fails to register
with us.

Much play has been made with these tiny '

blood spots which may sometimes be seen
in hog lungs. The spotting, in hog cholera,
paratyphoid and other diseases is often ac-
companied by an intense blood congestion
of the nearest lymph node, so intense as to
be almost black in color.

The cholera spots may be anywhere on the
lung surface, and there isno mistaking the
pneumonia signs accompanying them. The
extra oozing of the tiny drops of blood from
the smaller blood vessels that may occur if
the time lag between stunning and bleed-
ing has been prolonged is nowhere capable
of being confused with hog cholera signs.

This problem of blood spot, or blood
splashing, as we call it, can be produced
in any stunned animal by prolonging the

time between the act of stunning and that _

of bleeding.

In the prehumane slaughter days in Brit-
ain, the drawing out of the time between
stunning and bleeding in order to produce

July 29.

a blood-splashed carcass was afavored meth-
od of demonstrators anxious to impress the
representatives'of the humane societies with
the supposed incompetence of the humane
killers.

It is a quite harmless condition, and should
not occur where the animal has been prop-
erly stunned and bled. ,

To place these instruments in the hands
of untrained people is really dangerous be-
cause it can be used to disCredit the whole
humane method of slaughter.

We thereféne insist that there should be
trained men rather than untrained men 011
the slaughterhouse ﬂoor; Efficiency and
speed demands that and we use an 80-VOlt
current applied for a matter of 4 seconds.

We ﬁnd that ample to produce complete ‘
unconsciousness.

In our plants we ﬁnd the men welcome the
introduction of humane slaughter, as it
means greater efﬁciency and less fatigue and
danger for themselves.

Most of the cattle we slaughter are young,
good-quality steers that have never known
what it is to be tied up, and in the case of

- hogs, they are not all as uniform in size as

we would like.

We kill. a percentage of sows and adult
bears in the 500 pounds and over deadweight
category, and we have neVer found the
slighest difficulty in getting them uncon-
scious with the electric stunner. '

Provided the instrument is applied with
the electrodes of the tongs covering the _
brain on either side, there is no diﬂiculty.

We ﬁnd it helps to give the animal a soft
fall by covering the stunning pen ﬂoor with
wood, slatted in 6-inch rectangles to prevent

. the animal’s feet slipping, and covering the

lot with some inches of wood shavings.

As the hogs enter they are so intent on
smelling these shavings that they take no
notice of the electric stunner operator or the
shackler.

Their snouts go down in such a position
that it is easy for the operator, standing
behind and to the side, to snap the tongs
into position between ear and eye on each
side, switch on the current and gently fol-
low the animal’s fall.

In the meantime the shackler has already
hooked the chain to the wheel and the hog

.is away into the bleeding pen in a matter

of seconds, all in silence, and with no panic
or excitement.

We ﬁnd the wood shavings keep the' pen
smelling sweet. It absorbs urine, and can
be cleaned out and burnt after each day’s
killing is over.

Before we had humane slaughter we would
normally kill at the rate of about 200 hogs
per hour, but since we have had electric
stunning we ﬁnd something wrong if we
we do not top the 300 per hour mark.‘

Our plant is of the American pattern, hav-
ing been constructed under the supervision
of an American constructional engineer, and
naturally we have the American machines in
use, so that, size for size, we can get a fair
turn of speed out, using “only one hoist at a
time to get the hogs bled.

In Britain not only do we control the 1
slaughtering of animals by law, but no one
under the age of 18 years is allowed to do the
actual slaughtering.

Licenses are issued by local authorities for
trained slaughtermen, and these licenses are
renewable every 3 years subject to good be-
havior. _

The slaughtering plant itself is also sub-
j ect to license or registration by the authority
in whose municipal or urban area it is situ-
ated.

Government departments draw up model
bylaws to cover abattoirs, and any local au-
thority can adopt these bylaws and enforce
them in their own area if they wish TheSe
laws deal with hygiene and the public-
health aspect in general.

 




1958

At the present time Parliament is consider-
ing some new legislation about the siting and
construction of abattoirs, and to modify the
humane slaughter acts So as to allow the use
.of gas, as you have in the Hormel plant here.

Many of our small packinghouse type of
bacon-curing plants are ready for the in-
stallation of the C02 plant, which will prob-
ably be Of the Danish Wernberg type, suit-
able for plants with little spare space to
work in.

How that will work out with a variety in
size of hogs we do not yet know, but the elec-
tric stunner will always be needed as a quick
and efﬁcient standby, in case of emergency,
and for the plant where the expense of 111-
stalling gas is too much for the ﬁrm to bear.
The captive-bolt pistol will also be used con-
stantly in our country for stunning cattle,
Until some marked improvement comes
along.

As far as we in Britain are concerned, the
humane slaughtering of animals has been
with us fOr over 20 years, and the newness
has worn out. Business executives who
years ago were its bitterest opponents are to-
day it most fervent advocates, because they
feel that having found methods which are
good and make for increased efﬁciency, they
like others to know about it.

There is no sentimentality about it—they
look upon it as a business prOposition which
they once opposed, but which they found
later to be worth while and paying dividends.

I know of nO' one in Britain who would ever
wish to repeal the humane slaughtering leg-
islation.

Before I resume my seat, may I be allowed,
on a personal note, to thank you for your
courtesy and consideration in allowing a
stranger thus to address you.

It is for me a great honor. If it is your

Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, I thank you.

Mr.- POAGE. Thank you very much, Colonel
Anthony. Are there any questions?

If not, we are very much obliged to you
for your statement.

Mr. ANTHONY. Thank you, sir.

Mr. POAGE. We will now hear from our col-
league, Mr. DORN of South Carolina.

Mr. NEUBERGER. I read a paragraph
from. Colonel Anthony’s informative
statement:

As far as we in Britain are concerned, the
humane slaughtering of animals has been

I know of no one in Britain who would ever

lation.

I venture to say that if the Senate
. acts afﬁrmatively today, as the Senator
" from Minnesota and I hope it will, in a
sho1t time no one in America either will
desire to repeal the humane slaughtering
legislation.

In conclusion, Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent to have printed in
the RECORD as a part of my remarks a
statement I have prepared in suppo1t of
humane slaughter legislation embodied
in_ the bill we originally introduced in
the Senate and which we feelais con-
tained in the bill which was passed a

' postpone action on the issue before us.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —— SENATE

short time ago by the House of Repre-
sentatives, namely, ”H. R. 8308.

There being'no objection, the State-
ment was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:

STATEMENT BY SENATOR RICHARD L. NEUBERGER

It was on April 28, just about 2 months
ago, that I had the privilege of being the
leadoif witness at hearings conducted by
the Senate Agriculture Committee on the ‘
several proposals relating to humane meth-
ods of slaughter of livestock. I commented
in my opening remarks, on that occasion,
that I have been most sincerely interested
in the enactment of humane slaughter leg-
islation since my esteemed colleague, the
able junior Senator from Minnesota [ML
HUMPHREY], ﬁrst introduced such a bill in
1955. I have been pleased to be his co-
spo-nsor, and I have testiﬁed at every hear-
ing on the need for enactment of a com-
pulsory measure.

In the House hearings were held, too, and
after long, patient deliberations, the Poage,
bill was passed on February 4, 1958. It
was a measure that represented the yield-
ing of extreme positions by different groups
in behalf of the paramount objective—a bill
that would at last provide the impetus for
acceptance of humane slaughter practices in
most packinghouses engaged in supplying
the Government. . ‘

The Senate seemed destined to throw its'
support behind the Poage bill when the
junior Senator from Minnesota moved on
the Senate ﬂoor to have his bill made iden-
tical with H. R. 8308, as passed by the
House. "

Unfortunately, the H. R. 8358 reported to ’

the Senate ﬂoor is' an entirely different ver-_
sion than the bill approved by the House
of Representatives. That is the simple rea-
son, Mr. President, that I am supporting
the motion to enact~—in H. R. ~83_08——the
moderate, reasonable, and effective bill which
came from the House of Representatives.

I believe that the Senate AgricultureCom-
mittee has misunderstood thesentiment of
the majority of the Senate and has dis-
regarded the desires of the overwhelming
majority of the American public.

A TEPID SUBSTITUTE UNACCEPTABLE

What the public wants is decisive action
to end, at some deﬁnite date, a cruelty that
is deeply offensive to our national moral
code and for which there is no possible ex-.
cuse. The Senate I believe, will want to
dispose of this issue, conclusively, as soon as
possible.

The many days of extensive hearings have «
amassed testimony which leaves no doubt
as to what the public wants. That testi-
mony overwhelmingly opposes a tepid hu-
mane slaughter law which merely instructs
the Secretaryof Agriculture to study slaugh-
ter methods for another 2 years, and then to

bring back to us another bill, which could .

hardly be much different from bills that the
Congress has already considered and debated
for three whole years. This would be need-
less delay.

And we would then have to make the
decision that we can reach, and should
reach, today. It is clearly apparent . that
the intent and the effect of the bill proposed
by the Agriculture Committee is only to
The
proposed study bill is not a humane slaugh-
ter bill; it is a device to defeat the humane
slaughter bill that has been sent to us by
the other House.

It has been contended that more study is
needed to determine whether it is practical
to ameliorate the sufferings of hundreds of
millions of animals. But that contention is
sheer nonsense. It is shot full of hypocrisy.

/

14083

There is one fact that ought to bring this
entire debate to a conclusion. It is a fact
that overwhelms all arguments.

I refer to the fact that approximately 200
United States packing plants are already '
using, with satisfaction and proﬁt to them-
selves, the humane methods of slaughtering
that the people of our country want to see
universally adopted. Some of these pro-
gressive packers have themselves appeared
before our congressional committees and
freely testiﬁed that these humane methods
are practical and proﬁtable. And the testi-
mony has come from little packers as well
as from big packers.

VITAL FACTS FAVOR HUMANE~ ~SLAUGHTER BILL

I am not relying on the testimony from
humane societies or women’s clubs when I
tell you that humane methods of slaughter
are practical. I am relying on testimony;
given to our committees by ofﬁcial repie-'
sentatives of the American Meat Institute,
the Western States Meat Packers Associa-
tion, the National Independent Meat Packers
Association, and also on testimony given
by the technical staff of the Department of
Agriculture.

There is absolutely no argument about the
practicality of humane-slaughter methods.
Every bit of documented testimony presented
to the Senate Agriculture Committee showed,
in fact, that humane methods will tend to
beneﬁt farmers and consumers, as well as
packers, by eliminating a really sinful waste
of meat and by improving operating pro-
cedures. ,

So let us not be confused into thinking,
today, that either the packers or the Score-1...
tary of Agriculture actually want to study
the practicality of humane-slaughter meth-‘

ods 1'

Let me just review for you what the De?
partment of Agriculture proposes to study.

A spokesman for the Department of Agri-
culture told the Senate Agriculture Commit»

”tee during the recent hearing that he would

like to have several years to study slaughter
methods because, he said, he doesn’t know ,
what methods are humane. He will try to
learn if an animal might rather have its
joints yanked out of place by an electric
hoist, and might rather have its throat punc-
tured with a knife while fully conscious,

gthan to be anesthetized by a gas that is

often used an an anesthetic on human
beings.

The Agriculture Department spokesman
invited Congress to give him a chunk of
taxpayers’ money, and several years of time,
to‘ satisfy his doubts about this matter.
Does this make good sense?

Can any Senator conscientiously go along
with this proposal that we authorize a
2- -year research project to determine whether '
anesthetics really relieve. pain?

THOROUGH STUDY ALREADX COMPLETED

There is not time, here and now, to reca-
pitulate the entire history of the effort that
is now at its climax——the effort to achieve a
simple but enormous moral reform that is
long overdue. I remind my colleagues, how-
ever, that the Congress itself has conducted
much earnest study of the practical prob-
lems of this issue. A-Senate subcommittee
conducted public hearings in 1956. A House.
subcommittee conducted additional public
hearings in 1957. The House committee took
its investigation right into the packing
plants. Members of " the committee made
unannounced visits to plants that use both
humane and inhumane methods. Some
members of the House committee actually
slaughtered animals themselves, in order to
be sure that they knew the practical facts
about the techniques under question. Two

.. months ago the full Agriculture Committee

of the Senate conducted still another public
hearing.

 




14084

Over a period of years we have piled up
more than 600 pages of printed testimony
from the best experts that this Nation can
muster. And the House committee, as I
said, did a ﬁeld investigation.

Perhaps some Senators will think that no
humane slaughter law should be enacted.
But those we so feel should cast their votes
forthrightly against what is obviously de-
sired by the American public. It is not fair
to saddle the taxpayers with an obviously
needless study in order to avoid a clean
vote on this issue.

The motion I am supporting. will achieve
a moderate and reasonable reform. The mo-
tion sponsored by the small majority of the
Senate Agriculture Committee would sim—
ply postpone all chance of reform for at
least 2 years and perhaps for much longer.

HUMANE SLAUGHTER A MILESTONE IN MQRAL
ADVANCE

I sometimes think that, a century or two
hence, our descendants, upon hearing of our
accepted practices in slaughterhouses, will
look back upon the 20th- century with the
same mingled feelings of dismay, .abhorrence,
and incredulity which we experience on
reading of convivial crowdsﬁat a public exe-
cution 200 years ago.

If there is any doubt about that, I would
suggest that people read the writings, for
example, of Theodore Roosevelt and his ab-
horrence of what was done to the vast buf-
falo herds numbering some 60 million when
they were slaughtered absolutely, indiscrim-
inately, and ruthlessly just for sport in the
’ years when the Great Plains and the
prairie were ﬁrst being settled. Tradition-
ally, the humanitarian measures that have,
1 by 1, become our great body of social
legislation have followed the, voices of per-
sistent protest which stirred to life'our na-
tional conscience.

We have taken for granted that the
eighth amendment of our Constitution pro-
hibits inﬂiction of. cruel and unusual pun-
ishment upOn our citizens. Today, the na-
tional conscience is asking why we subject
our animal friends to such cruel and inhu-
mane treatment.

If the farmers of this Nation humanely
treat animals while they are alive, through-
out the period of their growth, and handle
them to avoid injury and fear, why is it
necessary to subject these animals to such
primitive and “cruel treatment for the few
moments before they are killed and trans-
formed into meat and meat products?

I have talked with many of the men who
work in slaughterhouses, both in my own
State and elseWhere in the Nation. These
men, so far as I have been able to observe,
are among the strong and zealous oppo-
nents of some of the inhumane methods
presently employed in slaughterhouses.
They rebel against inﬂicting pain upon help-
less animals, which form the meat products
of the Nation and thus support the jobs
on which these men are dependent.

control of the policy of those plants. They
did not. design the cruel front end of the
production line. They cannot institute new
methods of slaughter, unless their employers
so dictate and decide.

I have had members of the Butcher Work-
ers’ Union observe to me, “We realize that
cruel ways of slaughter will. only hurt the
meat industry and promote vegetarianism
among Americans. We believe that every
possible humane method of killing should
be used by slaughterhouses, just as soon as
it is developed. "

I have emphasized this point because it is
my ﬁrm opinion that the men working in
. our slaughterhouses are, in the main, among
' the foremost advocates of adopting every
available humane device for cushioning and
quelling any possible pain inﬂicted upon the
animals which are slaughtered to stock the
tables and markets of Amm‘ica.

. servations.

But.
the workers in slaughterhouses are net in '.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —- SENATE

We have passed laws to prohibit the in-
humane cruelty to \animals on their way to
market. I can see no reason why the Con-
gress should not specify, humane standards
of killing livestock and poultry, in order to
comply with the moral standards of decency
and humaneness which are so much a part
of the great heritage of the United ,. States.

With respect to the speciﬁcally religious
objections to the bill, I can only say that I
fully and sympathetically appreciate the
legitimate concern with which they are put
forward; but upon considering them fully,
I do not believe that they are so insur-
mountable as to force the total abandon-
ment of all legislative effort to establish the
principle of governmental responsibility for
humane methods of slaughter to which I
have referred.

In conclusion, allow me to offer two ob-
First, over the past several years
research study on, this subject has provided
demonstrable results on which legislation
may be logically and soundly based. Second,
the experience of the progressive and ener-
getic minority among the packers, who have
introduced to the'production line the new
techniques required for humane methods of
slaughter, demonstrates its applicability in
plants Of any and all sizes.

One would think that on the grounds Of
eihightened, humanitarian peiformance—or
on the more practical grounds Of economy
and efﬁciency of Operation—~0nly support
and afﬁrmation would be heard in the plea
for adoption of humane slaughter legisla-
tion. I favor substituting the stronger House

'bill in place of the toothless Senate study.

Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. P1 esident, I
wish to express my gratitude to the jun-
ior Senator from Oregon for his splen-
did statement and for his ﬁne support
and for the privilege of being associated
with him as a cosponsor of the proposed
legislation.

At this point I ask unanimous con-
sent tO have printed in the RECORD, a
letter addressed to Representative W.
R. POAGE, signed by representatives of
J eW1sh organizations relating to the leg-
islative history of H. R. 8308, as passed
by the House.

There being no objection, the letter
was ordered to be printed in the REC-
0RD, as follows:

AMERICAN JEWISH CONGRESS,
New York, N. Y., February 20,1958.
Hon. W. R. POAGE,
Ho’use Oﬁ‘ice Building,
Washington, D. C'.

DEAR CONGRESSMAN POAGE: We are writ-
ing to you at this time to express our ap-
preciation for your statements during the
debate of H. R. 8308 on February 4, regard-
ing the humaneness of the Jewish religious
method of slaughtering animals for human
consumption. At the same time, , we wish
to correct some inaCCuracies during the de-
bate and to clarify possible misunderstand-
ings of our position on humane slaughter—
ing legiSIative measures, particularly with
regard to one part of the January 29, 1958
letter from Dr. Leo Pfeﬁ‘er to you.

We were pleased to read in the letter of
January 29, 1958 from Mr. Fred Myers, ex-
ecutive director of the Humane Society of
the United States, to you, the statement
that in the opinion of the Humane Society
“based upon expert testimony already pre-
sented to Congress and uponapersonal ob-
servation, that the Jewish method of
slaughter, when performed according to the
laws of Shechita by a trained and re—
ligiously supervised Shochet, results in vir-
tually immediate loss of consciousness by
the animal and should be legally recog-
nized, as being humane.”
gratifying to note your comment in re-

It Was even more

July 29

ferring to Shechita that “ritualistic slaugh-
tering is, 213.1 see it, when carried out in
compliance with the Mosaic law, one of the
most humane methods yet devised” (CON-
GRESSIONAL RECORD p. 1430). While the hu-
maneness of 'Shechita has been repeatedly
demonstrated through‘ scientiﬁc studies
conducted by eminent pathologists and
other authorities in the ﬁelds of veterinary
medicine, anatomy and physiology, it is
good to know that as a Member of the
United States Congress who has made a
study of the subject, you have come to the
same conclusion and were thoughtful
enough to state your View on the ﬂoor of
the House of Representatives.

In response to a‘question from COngress-
man JAMES ROOSEVELT, you said “as far as
I know, there is no group except the Union
of Orthodox. Rabbis that has not agreed
tothese amendments. I may be wrong, but
I know of no other group that is not in
favor of} these amendments" (CONGRES-
SIONAL' RECORD p. 1431). You will recall
that the Rabbinical Council of America and
the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congrega-
tions of America are opposed to such legis-
lation. Needless to say, the position of
these orthodox organizations is not due to
a lack of concern abOut cruelty to animals.
Rather, it stems from the apprehension
based on the experience in other countries
that humane slaughtering legislation no
matter how worded may threaten Shechita
and may be a forerunner of a movement
to ban Shechita. .

Referring to the undersigned organizations,
Congressman MULTER said during the debate
we “are in favor of and support this measure"
(CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, p. 1431). This state-
ment is inaccurate. As you correctly stated,
we were opposed to H. R. 8308 in the form in
which it was originally introduced. As stated
in the letter from Dr Leo Pfeffer to you, dated
January 29,1958, in its present amended form
we do not oppose the measure. However,
While we do not oppose the measure as
amended, we are not proponents of the bill.
We are sure you understand and appreciate
this distinction.

Inasmuch as H. R. 8308 is still to be con-
sidered in the Senate, may we clarify one part
of Dr. Pfeﬁer’s letter of January 29 which
may be subject to misinterpretation. We
have reference to the paragraph which reads:

“We understand further that while the bill
as amended would empower the Department
of Agriculture to restrict or prohibit shack-
ling or hoisting of conscious animals'in con-
nection with slaughtering according to the
ritual requirements of the Jewish faith, it
does not restrict or prohibit, nor does it au-
thorize the Department Of Agriculture to re-
strict or prohibit the use of the Weinberg or
revolving pen, as is used in Great Britain, and .
that such use of the Weinberg pen is a hu-
mane method Of preparing the animals for
slaughter.”

We wish to underscore the correctness of
your statement to the effect that “we want to
prevent any unnecessary cruelty” (CONGRES-
SIONAL RECORD, p. 1432). This applies to the
preparation of animals for slaughter as well
as the act of slaughter itself. We have no
desire to protect methods Of handling or '
preparation of animals which may be inhu-
mane. At the same time, we see no need for
restricting or banning present methods of
handling which may not be inhumane.

" To be more speciﬁc, while we hold no brief
for and oppose such forms of- shackling and ‘
hoisting which may be inhumane, it was
neter the intention of the undersigned or-
ganizations to imply- that shackling and
hoisting per se are inhumane, and, therefore,
subject to being prohibited in all their forms
by the Department of Agriculture. We do
not understand this to be the legislative in—
tent of your bill. You will recall that Mr.
Fred Myers, in his letter of January 20, ad-
vised you that in the amendments since writ-

I

 




1958

ten into H. R. 8308 “we have purposely avoid-
ed——a detailed description of humane meth-
ods of handling animals as they are brought
into position for slaughter, in order to allow
for future inventions in that ﬁeld. "

In any event, whether it may be existing
methods of handling animals preparatory to
slaughter, necessary modiﬁcation Of present
methods, the revolving pen or methods as yet
to be devised; our position precisely stated is
that we are Opposed to any methods which
may be inhumane without necessarily ruling
out existing methods which are or which
could be modiﬁed so as to be humane.

We respectfully request that you insert
this letter into the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD so
that all who are interested may know exactly
where we stand in the matter of humane
slaughtering legislative proposals and how
much we appreciate your efforts in behalf
of religious liberty by your support of the
Jewish religious method of slaughtering ani-
mals for food.

ask unanimous consent to have printed
in the RECORD a letter which I received
from Mayor Wagner, of New York City,
under date of June 26, 1958, in support of
H. R. 8308, as passed by, the House.

There being no objection, the letter
was ordered to be p1 Inted in the RECORD,

Hon. HUBERT HUMPHREY,

DEAR SENATOR HUMPHREY: I have had
brought to my attention a. proposal now
pending before the COmmittee on Agricul-
ture and Forestry of theUnited States Senate
to require the use of humane methods in the
slaughter Of livestock and poultry in inter-
state or foreign commerce.

May I express to you and through you to
the entire Senate, my support of legislation
which will mandate humane methods Of
slaughter in the United States of America.
I know that any legislation passed by the
United States Senate will contain within it
every possible protection which any reli-
gious faith in our great country may deem
necessary.

With kindest personal regards.

Sincerely yours,

Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, I
ask unanimous consent tO have printed
in the RECORD at this point an editorial
entitled “For More Humane Slaughter
Methods,” published in the Montana
Standard of June 9, 1958, endorsing the
bill passed by the House and which is
now being supported by me and other
Senators.

There being no objection, the editorial
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
* as follows:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -— SENATE

FOR MORE HUMANE SLAUGHTER METHODS

More than half a century ago, the novelist
Upton Sinclair wrote a potent book called
The Jungle. He portrayed so vividly the
conditions in the meatpacking industry that
a Government commission was named to
investigate. The upshot Of it all was that
on June 30 1906, President Theodore Roose-
velt signed the Meat Inspection Act, which
brought tremendous reform.

Since that time, partly under Government
prodding and partly through what might be
called enlightened self-interest, the meat-
packing industry has cremarkably improved
its techniques. The great bulk of the meat
and meat products served on American
tables is fresh, sanitary and wholesome.

Yet though the situation today bears al-
most no resemblance to that which prompted
Upton Sinclair’s book decades ago, it must
be said that the industry has lagged in one
important respect. With some exceptions,
methods of slaughter are not much more
humane than they were years ago.

The public apparently has become more
aware of this in 1958 than in any previous
year. In consequence, legislation to im-
prove slaughter methods may squeeze
through to passage by Congress this year.
It would be ﬁtting if the bill were to be-
come law by’ June 30, thex52d anniversary
of the celebrated Meat Inspection Act.

Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President,
earlier today statements were made that
the methods of humane slaughter spelled
out in the. bill were not sufﬁciently com-
prehensive." I have before, me a state-
ment made by Mr. Rutherford T. Phil-
lips, executive director of the American
Humane Association, before the Com-
mittee on Agriculture and Forestry, re-
futing very‘clearly the arguments which
were made-in Opposition to H. R- 8308,
particularly with respect to methods of
slaughter. I ask unanimous consent
that the statement be printed 'in the
RECORD at this p’Oint. —

There being no objection, the state-
ment was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:

STATEMENT OF, RUTHERFORD T. PHILLIPS, Ex- '
ECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE AMERICAN HUMANE

ASSOCIATION, To THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON
AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY

I am Rutherford T. Phillips, executive di-
rector Of the American Humane Association,
and I testiﬁed in support of S. .1497 and‘H. R.
8308 on April 28, 1958. I do not wish to re-
peat what I said then.
some of the testimony of the opponents of
these bills, I would like to make the follow-
ing Observations:

- 1. It has been repeatedly stated that there
is confusion about what is a humane
method. '

The bills, S. 1497 and H. R. 8308, state
that the following are found to be humane:
a single blow; a gunshot; an electrical, chem-
ical or other means that is rapid and effec-
tive; severing Of the carotid arteries simul-
taneously with a sharp instrument (sec. 2
(a) and (13)).

It further states under section 4 (b) that
the Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to
designate methods which conform to the
policy of humane slaughtering at the effec-
tive date and thereafter at such times as he
deems advisable. "

This is certainly a fair way of spelling out
the kinds of methods Of producing insensi-
bility without closing the door on improve-
ments and new developments.

It is not to be supposed that the Secre-

- tary will be so strict as to require the im-

poSsible result of stunning a thousand ani-‘
mals with exactly a, thousand blows.
will be left for human error. .Good faith

. objection to the bill.

However, in view of .

Room '

14085

compliance with the policy is all that/anyone
could require.

The American Humane Association and
packers know which existing methods are ac-
ceptable because some packers have applied
for, and received AHA seals of approval. We
also have the experience of the methods used
in Europe. It is unwise to spell out speciﬁc
methods in the law. This is appropriately
left to the Secretary Of Agriculture who will
administer the law with the assistance of the
advisory committee established by section 5.

2. Another industry Objection which has
been emphasized is the cost of the CO
immobilizer.

This equipment is particularly designed to
maintain the higher rate of kill in large
plants.

The statement of Mr. Liljenquist and Mr.
Unwin that this is far beyond the financial ’
reach of the small packer, is not a valid
Hogs may be humanely
slaughtered by the use of the captive bolt
pistol. This would have no appreciable effect
on costs Of operation in the small plant
having a low rate Of kill. Mr. Eshbaughyon
page 2 of his prepared statement, remarks
that the Remington Stunner “is now in reg-

ular use on lambs and hogs in one plant.” .

Mr. Eshbaugh goes on to say, on page-6,
with respect to calves, lambs, and hogs, “It
is believed that if regularly supplied with
animals, one stunning Operator can handle
up to 200 animals per hour through present
pens capable of handling that number with-
out-_,stunning. Any considerable” ' increase
above that ﬁgure would require changes in
layout to include conveyor handling of live
animals to the stunning position.” *

3. The AHA is surprised at the’Opposition
testimony given on Tuesday by representa-
tives of the Jewish faith. The original teXt
of the humane slaughter bill submitted tO
Senator HUMPHREY by the AHA in 1955 con-
tained a full exemption for Kosher slaughter.

The present bill, in Section 6 spells out that . . I

exemption to completely exempt both the
preparation for, and the actual slaughter.
Actually in view of section 6, section 2 (b)‘
is not needed, but it was placed in the bill
at the suggestion of some representatives Of
the Jewish faith to make it absolutely clear
that there was not any implication to be
drawn from an exemption that the Congress
felt that Kosher slaughtering was inhumane.
It is Obvious, therefore, that this bill will not

affect Kosher slaughtering in any way. We

feel that much of the testimony heard on this
point was irrelevant to’a consideration Of
this bill. ‘ .

Furthermore, it is doubtful that this bill
would have any appreciable effect on Kosher
slaughtering as it applies only tOIVGovern-
ment procurement. We understand that a
negligible amount of Kosher meat products
are purchased by the Government, if any;
Certainly the bill will not prohibit shechita
in any part Of the United States.

We sympathize with the concern of those
who testiﬁed, but an analysis of this bill
shows that their fears are completely ground-
less.

Mr. HUMPHREY'. Mr. President, I
ask unanimous consent to have printed
in the RECORD at this point a letter
which I sent to Mr. Leo Pfeffer, associate
general counsel of the ’American Jewish
Congress, under date of March 22, 1958,
and an exchange of letters between my-
self and Representative W. R. POAGE con-
cerning the Pfeffer letter, which are com-
plementary and supplementary [to the
letter I. asked to have printed in the REC-
0RD earlier.

There being no Objection, the letters
weIe ordered to be printed in the RECORD,

7 MARCH 22,1958
LEO PFEFFER, Esq.,
Associated General Counsel,
American Jewish Congress,
New York, N. Y.

DEAR MR. PFEFFER: I am.writing to express
my own personal gratitude to you and to the
ﬁve leading Jewish organizations cooperating
with you on the above matter for the
splendid way in which you have assisted me,
and members of the House of Representa-
tives, in working out a solution of the deli-
cate problem of humane slaughter legisla-
tion that fully and effectively protects
Jewish religious slaughtering practices. I
think you have all done a magniﬁcent job in
assisting us to draft legisla ion that would,
beyond question, protect Jewish religious
slaughtering practices and would at the same
time insure the humane t1eatment of ani-
Vmals on which those practices are based in
the slaughter of animals for food by other
methods of slaughter as well.

I realize that the task has been far from an
easy one and that it is virtually impossible
to expect unanimity on the part of the Jew-
ish community in so sensitive a matter. I
do want to record, however, my own ‘convic-
tion that the amendments to the Poage bill
which you were able to work out with the
humane societies, and which were accepted

---.by the House Committee and enacted by the
House, fully protect Jewish religious slaugh-
tering and handling of animals (1) by the
express congressional recognition of- kosher
slaughter as humane and (2) by the provi-
sion of the new section VI prohibiting any
construction of the legislation which might
in any way interfere with religious slaughter
or preparation for slaughter.

_ It is my considered judgment that ”those
groups in the Jewish community who con-
tend that possible future legislative attempts
to impinge upon Jewish religious slaughter
practices would be less likely to succeed if
there were no humane slaughter legislation
at all than if the bill which has been passed
by the House is enacted are, with all due re-
spect, in error. It seems to me not only Ob-
vious but beyond dispute that it will be far
more difﬁcult . for any future Congress to
attempt to interfere with kosher slaughter

, practices in the face of the express congres-‘
sional ﬁnding and recognition of kosher
slaughter as humane contained in the
amended Poage bill and in the legislative
history written on it than it would be if
there were no such express legislative rec-

ognition and history. And if it had not been'

' for your efforts and those of your colleagues,
I am wholly, convinced that humane slaugh—
ter legislation would have been passed over
the opposition of the Jewish community and
would not have contained the effective safe—
guards of kosher slaughter practices that
your efforts, have succeeded in writing into
the Poage bill.

I also want to acknowledge the copy I
have received of the February 20, 1958, letter
.- of your ﬁve organizations to Chairman
Poage of the House Committee, and to re-
cord to you my own understanding of the
meaning and intent of the Poage bill as en-
acted by the House with respect to handling
of animals prior to kosher slaughter, in
light of'its legislative history in the House
debate, including your letter of January 29,
1958, to Mr. Poage, which he introduced into
the RECORD in the debate, and his ensuing
remarks agreeing with your Views as ex-
pressed therein.

To be speciﬁc, I feel there is no doubt
whatever that the clear and correct interpre-
tation of the bill in this respect, as clariﬁed

‘ on the ﬂoor of the House, is (1) that animals
must be handled in a humane manner prior
to kosher slaughter; (2) that any inhumane
method of handling animals prior to kosher
slaughter may be restricted or prohibited by
the Secretary of Agriculture effective on and
after December 31, 1959, including those

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -—— SENATE

forms of shackling and hoisting which are
not humane; (3) that any forms of shack-
ling or hoisting of animals or other methods
of handling prior to kosher slaughter which
are not inhumane may not be restricted or
prohibited by the Secretary; and (4) that use
of the Weinberg or revolving pen for casting

,animals prior to kosher slaughter is a hu-

mane method of handling and may not be
restricted or prohibited by the Secretary as
inhumane.

Such an mterpretation of the bill, as to
which I feel there is no question and which
I shall be glad to record on the Senate side,
both in committee and on the floor, should
fully satisfy your organizations and any oth-
ers in the Jewish community who fear that
enactment of the Poage bill by the Congress
would as a practical matter immediately
make kosher slaughter impossible. That is
plainly neither its intent nor its language.
I am c0nfident that Congressman Poage
agrees completely with this interpretation
I assure you that I shall do everything in my
power to have the legislative history of the
bill in the Senate record this legislative iri-
tent so there will be no doubt about the cor-
rect meaning of the legislation.

I trust that this explanation will allay

some of the fears in this regard which have .

been expressed to me and will further reas-
sure your organizations and the entire Jewish
community that the amended Poage bill, if

enacted into law, will preserve and protect

kosher slaughter practices, and not harm
them. Again with my gratitude for your
help and your contributions to a sound solu-
tion of a most diﬂicult and vexing problem.
Sincerely yours,
HUBERT H. HUMPHREY.

Hon. W. R. POAGE,

DEAR CONGRESSMAN POAGE: As you know,
there has been considerable concern ex-
pressed in the J ewish'community subsequent
to the House debate on humane slaughter.
Several people have been in to see me, voicing
various fears which I have assured them
were exaggerated. After considerable
thought, it seems to me that the most help-'-
ful thing I can do hereis to send the attached
letter in an effort to rectify any misinter-
pretation which some groups may have of
the bill which was passed by the House. I
have tried to express what I believed to be
the correct intention and interpretation of
the House bill

I have not mailed the original of this let-
ter, because I wanted you ”to see it ﬁrst. I
am hopeful that you will agree that it cor-
rectly expresses your position and the'House
intent. After you have had a chance to look
this over, perhaps you might give me your
reaction over the phone.

Many thanks for your attention, and con-
gratulations on the successful job you did
in handling this bill.

Best wishes. ‘

Sincerely yours,

DEAR SENATOR HUMPHREY: Your letter of
March 22 to Hon. Leo Pfeifer was, in my
opinion, a very ﬁne, very clear, and very
excellent statement of the effect of the pend-
ing legislation on humane slaughter. I
would not want to change the interpretation
which you placed on this bill. I have met
with, and talked with, Mr. Pfeifer on several
occasions. I think he has made a very serious
and very helpful effort to allay "some of the
fears of some segments of the Jewish com-
munity in regard to this legislation. It

seems to me that your letter to him should
satisfy all of those who can be satisﬁed.

I was particularly impressed with the clear
and effective way in which you pointed out

that in the absence of legislation of the type ,.

you and I are trying to get that it will prob-
ably be far more likely that the Congress will
pass some type Of punitive legislation com-
pletely ignoring the legitimate requests of
our Jewish citizens. I think this would be
unfortunate, but I think it is likewise in-

evitable. On the other hand, by the accept:

ance of the Jewish leaders of the very mod-

erate legislation that we are proposingthis

ill feeling can be avoided. Mr. Pfeffer con-

tinues to do everything he can to avoid any

such unfortunate result. I am hopeful that

you will ﬁnd it possible to secure favorable

committee and Senate action on this meas-
ure in the near future.

Thanking you for your good work, and
with best wishes, I am,
Yours sincerely,

W. R. POAGE,

nally I ask unanimous consent to have
printed in the RECORD a number of edi-
torials in support of H. R. 8308, and
objecting to the Senate amendment.

There being no objeCtion, the editori-
als were ordered to be printed in the

[From the Nashville (Tenn) Tennessean of
June 26,1958]

THERE WAS PLENTY OF DATA, SENATOR

Efforts to get humane slaughter legislation
enacted have taken a strange turn in a
Senate committee.

One measure, passed overwhelmingly in
the House last February, provides that after
January 1, 1960, humane methods must be
used by packers who make contracts with
the Federal Government. Such methods
would include instant stunning of animals
with a mechanical instrument or anestheti-
zation with carbon dioxide.

Both methods, have been used on millions I

of animals by packers who are voluntarily
humane, but more millions are either ham-
mered into insensibility or stuck with knives
and let bleed.

A great deal has been written about hu-
mane slaughter and there are anumber of
examples of packers who use more humane
methods successfully. House « discussion
brought out much information about hu-
mane methods.

So it is strange that the Senate Agricul-
ture and Forestry Committee approved an
amended bill to require theSecretary of
Agriculture to draft legislation setting forth
what constitutes humane slaughtering.
Chairman ALLEN ELLENpER (Democrat, of
Louisiana)‘ said there was insufficient infor-
mation available to write regulations.

That must have come as a surprise to
myriad humane societies, women’s clubs,
church and farm groups which support hu-
All would have
been pleased to make available to Mr. ELLEN-
DER 1eams and reams of infOrmation, includ-
ing the successful methods used by volun-
tarily humane packers.

It is hoped the committee will reconsider
its action and vote out a bill similar to that
passed by the House.

 

[From the Charlotte (N. C.) News of June
‘ 25,1958]

As SUBTLE As A BLOW ON THE HEAD

To put it bluntly, the humane slaughter
bill was bludgeoned in the Senate Agricul-
ture Cqmmittee last week with the kind of
vehemence the meatpackers usually reserve
for dumb animals.

Rather than approve legislation similar
to the Poage bill passed by the House of

for a 2—year “study” of painless slaughtering
methods.

Both the American Meat Institute and the
Department of Agriculture were lobbying
vigorously for “study” legislation. It is a
familiar dodge. Similar delaying tactics
have sentenced great bundles Of worthy leg-
islation to a lingering death in the past.

The bill is expected to reach the Senate
ﬂoor in July. Its amendment, to return to
it the effective language of Representative
POAGE’s bill, would mark the beginning Of

' the end Of slaughterhouse cruelties tO ani-

mals in the United States.
There is no need for any additional
study of humane slaughtering methods.

They have already been studied in enorm- .

ous detail and perfected with great care by
United States universities. Painless killing
methods are in use and, in fact, required
by law in civilized European countries. A
few United States packers ﬁnd these meth-
ods both economical and efﬁcient. ‘

It is plainly absurd to postpone action
in the United States merely to conﬁrm the
proposition that cruelty is cruel.

All that proponents of humane slaughter
legislation want is a system in which the
animal is rendered quietly unconscious be-
fore it is killed. It is a reasonable enough
goal in a civilized society.

 

[From the New York Herald Tribune of July
9,1958]

1‘; THE SENATE MUST SAVE HUMANE SLAUGHTER

‘ Animals can feel pain as keenly as human
beings and are equally prey to fear and terror.
But they can’t speak or vote, and therefore
have no inﬂuence in Congress. Which is
about the only available explanation why the
Humane Slaughter bill, after passing the
House, has been put on ice by the Senate
Agriculture Committee on the ﬂimsy pretext
that it requires further study of slaughter-
ing pmrocedures

Further study. For 30 years, this has
been the excuse advanced for delay by some
of the big meatpackers. The House Agri-
culture Committee made a personal [tour of
the slaughter houses and was immediately
convinced that changes were necessary. The
Senators, however, stayed in Washington,
refusing even to see a ﬁlm depicting the
slaughtering Of hogs.

Just what do the advocates of humane
slaughter want? All they want is the in-
troduction Of methods tO render animals in~
sensible tO pain before they are butchered,
either by electric stunning or .by carbon
dioxide gas. The objection from packing
houses seems to be that these methods would
be tOO expensive. But one ﬁrm that .has
adopted them, Hormel & 00., says that they
are saving it money. SO it would appear that
humane slaughtering is to the advantage of
the meatpacker, quite apart from consid-
erations Of common decency.

Fortunately, " supporters of humane
slaughter are determined not to let the is-
sue die. They have worked hard for their
objective, especially in the last 2 years. We
earnestly hope that the full Senate will do
something to save this bill as a working
measure before Congress adjourns.

PAINLEss SLAUGHTER

The humane-slaughter bill was given a
mercy death in the Senate Agriculture Com-
mittee last week. The committee declined
to approve legislation designed to bring an
end to slaughterhouse cruelty to animals.
The members voted for a 2—year study of
painless-slaughtering methods.

Maybe the committee believes that the
Pimple of this country are the dumb animals.
The subject of humane-slaughtering laws has

been discussed for years. Either the United-

congressional study of this problem is a waste

in Congress is to study it to death.

 

[From the Youngstown (Ohio) Vindicator of
June 24, 1958]

END PACKINGHOUSE CRUELTY

Because comparatively few Americans
know about the inhumane methods used in
slaughtering the animals which eventually
supply their tables with meat, they have
failed to give sufﬁcient support to legislation
now before Congress to eliminate unneces-
sary cruelty in the packinghouses.

Last week two House measures were de-
feated in a Senate committee which reported
out a study bill, instead. The legislation
sought by adherents Of humane slaughtering
would have established this as the country’s
public policy, requiring that the Federal Gov-
ernment and its agencies buy meat only from
packing plants using humane methods.

The study bill is obviously a delaying
measure, asked by the American Meat In.-
stitute and the Department of Agriculture.
It proposes that the Secretary Of Agriculture
study slaughtering methods for 2 years-

There is no need for this. The carbon
dioxide tunnel and a number of types of
pistols for making animals insensible to pain
have been fully developed and have been used
by some leading packers during the last few
years.

The humane organizations charge that the
meat industry’s efforts to kill an effective

humane- -slaughter law are strikingly similar 7

to the industry’s Opposition to the Meat In-
spection Act early in the century.

There is no point in continuing slaugh-
terhouse cruelty any longer. There is no real
economic reason for it The study bill is
scheduled to reach the Senate ﬂoor next
month. Advocates of humane methods
should demand its defeat and restoration of
the cOmpulsory humane- -slaughter bill.

 

[From the Washington Daily News of July 3,
1958] .

A MERCILESS STALL

If a member of the Senate Agriculture
Committee should look out his window today
and see a small boy tormenting a cat we’ll bet
he’d spring into action.

But, oddly, the committee as a whole seems
calm when it is called to their attention that
grownup boys kill steers, lambs, and pigs in
painful, bloody, and’ needless brutality.

The House passed a much needed humane
slaughter bill months ago.

The Senate committee has now'tried to
Slit the bill’s throat—but substituting one
which calls for a pointless 2-year study of
packing methods. Hasn’t this condition been
studied enough?

This proposal to study for 2 more years
is a merciless stall. _ The brutality‘is proven.
The economic practicality of humane meth-
ods has been demonstrated by such pro-
gressive. packers as Cud'ahy, Hormel, and
0sCar Mayer & 00., all of whom use efﬁcient
and painless slaughtering techniques.

It serves not the American public—gwhich
has supported the humane bill by a cascade
of letters—but the selﬁsh interests of the
American Meat Institute and the institute’s
pals in the Department of Agriculture, the
champions of indifference and inertia. ,

It might be worthwhile for the committee
members to take a tax-paid tour Of the worst

slaughterhouses and then think the whole

thing over, or, better still, take a trip (that
is, junket) to the many countries where the
situation that exists here’ has been outlawed
for many years.
The rest of the Senate, we trust, won’t need
such a bloodshot view to reject this stall and
,\ . W

to insist that the House bill be brought up
and passed.

 

[From the Toledo Blade of June 30, 1958]
STALL ON HUMANE SLAUGHTER

The Senate Agriculture Committee has re-
ported out a bill directing the Secretary of
Agriculture to study methods of slaughter-
ing meat animals and" come up within a
couple of years with legislation that would
set forth what wouldconstitute a humane
system of slaughter in American packing—
houses. The committee contends that there
isn’t enough information available to legis-
late now On the subject.

We are not impressed with this action or
the reason for it. For years the humane
slaughter issue has been thoroughly debated
and a- wealth Of information is available.
Unnecessarily brutal and clumsy slaughter
[practices have been documented.’ So has
the successful use by packers abroad, and
some i this country, of more effective, rela-
tivel g painless modern killing methOds. To
say ow that further study appears neces-
sary is simply a way Of postponing action
on a reform thatthe humane societies have
demonstrated is needed and feasible and

which, we think, has the support of the pub— ‘

lie behind it.

The House of Representatives in February
passed a bill which would compel packers
who sell meat to the Federal Government to
kill animals by humane methods. This does
not go the full length that the humane so-
cieties would like but they approve it as a
long step in the right direction. The Sen-
ate would do well to override its Agriculture
Committee and enact the law as approved
by the House.

 

[From the Boston Herald of July 12, 1958]
No TIME FOR- PAIN

Every day in Which the Senate dallies with
the humane slaughter bill is one more day
in which animals die cruelly and in pain.
But after passing the House by an over-
whelming margin in February, the bill has
been sidetracked, supposedly because the

7, Senate Agriculture Committee needs time to

study slaughter procedures.

The committee required time in 1956, .tOO,
when the bill" met an identical end. A House
committee then toured slaughterhousesob-
serving the methods that- prevailed. The
tour was a horrifying revelation Of man’s in-
difference to the fate of other species.

The House committee sponsored a bill re-
quiring the employment of humane methods
by packers wishing to contract with the
Government. It was passed by voice vote.

But in the Senate Agriculture Committee,
which did no slaughterhouse inspection, the

Senators refused even to see a sound ﬁlmﬂ

graphically depicting routine pig Slaughter
as practiced on more than 80 million pigs 9.

year. Instead, by a vote of 10 to 5, they ’

passed a “study” bill.

This means that the Senators, who were
too squeamish to watch. hogs being mas-
sacred on a screen, could with serenity and
good conscience condemn millions of animals
to a ghastly fate. But the bill had this fea—
ture as amended: The Senators didn’t have
to see the animals die.

Perhaps it is easier and more pleasant not
to have the hideous facts of life paraded
before one. The Senators do not have to
see the wildly rolling eyes of shackled ani-
mals, the welter‘of bloody trails, the stagger
of half-stunned cattle closing with the knife.
Nor do they have to listen to the screams
and belloWs of .animals in agony. Life, in
fact, can continue on its cheerful round.

The ﬁrm of Hormel & CO., which has
adapted humane butchering methods, re-
ports that swift and efﬁcient techniques have
proved economical. NO packer will go bank-
rupt because humane slaughtering methods
prevaii.

But at least 10 Senators are con~_

. ENDING A CRUELTY ~
The cruelty of shackling, hoisting, stick-
ing, and bleeding of fully conscious animals
is contrary to the moral code of our country.

_ While slaughterhouses have been improved

architecturally, handling methods have been
*modernized and meat-inspection services
‘have been streamlined, the method of the

.kill has remained virtually primitive in

America.

' The new humane slaughter bill passed by
the House and sent to the United States Sen—
ate should, however, mark the beginning of
the end of barbaric slaughterhouse practices.
This bill, which is long overdue, provides that
after 1959 the Government will purchase

‘ meat only from packers who use humane

‘methods in all of their plants. The bill
'states as national policy that livestock must
“first be-rendered insensible to pain before

‘ being killed.

. Introduced by Congressman W.- R. POAGE,
who has studied the problems of humane
slaughter at ﬁrsthand, the legislation is
probably not as strong as most humane so—
cieties would desire. But its moderation acts
as a sensible reason for approval, and indeed

,_._may prove to be more effective in ‘the long

run.

It provides an incentive for humane
slaughter rather than a compulsory law,
which some slaughterhouses might try to
evade. Over 75 percent of the animals
slaughtered in the United States are killed
by. packers with Government contracts. It is

not likely that any ﬁrm would want to lose -

this business. Moreover, the possibility of
economic hardship on smaller ﬁrms, which

, caused many Congressmen to initially hesi-

tate, is now eliminated.

. Humane slaughter methods, in use in
Europe for over a quarter of a century now,
have proved eminently economical and eﬂ‘i-
cient. The Remington humane- stunner, the
captive-bolt pistol, the Hormel carbon diox-
ide tunnel, and other cheap and functional
methods of anesthetizing animals are com-
pletely feasible, and should have been
adopted long ago.

Let’s hope the Senate approves the bill and
allows the Secretary of Agriculture to invoke

' these methods which are clean, swift, and
~--« the mark of a truly civilized society.

Mr.HUMPHREY. Mr. President, the

Therefore, Senators who wish to sup-
port a humane slaughtering meaSure

So the committee amendment was

,Mr. NEUBERGER. .Mr. President, I
move to reconsider the vote by which
the committee amendment was rejected.

Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, I
move to lay that motion on the table.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. - The
question is on agreeing to the motion of
the Senator from Minnesotato lay. on
the table the motion of the Senator
from Oregon to reconsider.

The motion to 'lay on the table was

agreed to.

‘ The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill

is open to further amendment.

' . Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, the
language now in the bill is the House
, language, and there are required certain
technical amendments, relating to dates
which need to be changed. The House
passed the bill at a date considerably
earlier than this. _

The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is
necessary for the Senate to be in order
before we can proceed. The Senate will
be in order.

The Senator from Minnesota may
proceed.

Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, in
the bill there are certain dates which
need to be adjusted because the time the
House acted was considerably earlier
’ than the action being taken now on the
part of the Senate. I shall send to the
desk an amendment to make certain
corrections, but I should like to explain
that the bill as it was passed by the
HouSe required the Secretary of Agri-
culture on or before June 30, 1958 to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —. SENATE

promulgate the necessary rules and reg-
ulations to carry out the purposes of the
act. It is now, Of course, late in July,
1958. Therefore, such a directive must

‘be changed. I am suggesting that the

date be moved up to March 1,1959.
This was the Suggestion made by some
of my colleagues who felt that the Sec-
retary should have adequate time in
which to make whatever rules and regu—
lations are desirable.

Second, Mr. President, the effective
date of the legislation, insofar. as the
packers are concerned, with respect to
complying with the requirements in the
bill as passed by the House, was DeCem-
ber 31, 1959. While it might be pos-

. sible for that to be done, I do not think

it would be quite fair in terms of the
time period between the date the Sec-
retary sets the regulations and the date
the packers must comply. Therefore, I
am suggesting that the date be extended
to June 30, 1960. This would mean
there would be about a year and a half
in which the packers would be given the

opportunity to adjust their facilities;

During the same period of time the study
which was proposed by the Senate com-
mittee can likewise be undertaken.

I believe We can thus meet the re-
quiiements of the mandatory provision
as well as the requirements of the study
program

Mr. President, I offer the necessary
clarifying and technical amendments,
and ask that they be considered en bloc.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
amendments Will be stated for the infor-
mation of the Senate.

The LEGISLATIVE CLERK. On page 2,
line 24, it is proposed to strike out “De-
cember 31,1959” and insert “June 30,

The LEGISLATIVE CLERK. On page 4,
line 23, after the period, it is proposed to
inseit:

Handling in' connection with such
slaughtering which necessarily accom-
panies the method of slaughter described in
subsection (b) of this section shall be

deemed to comply with the public policy
speciﬁed by this section.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
question is on agreeing to the amend-
ment offered by the Senator from New
York.

Mr. JAVITS obtained the ﬂoor.

Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, will
the Senator yield?

Mr. JAVITS I yield.

Mr. HUMPHREY. With respect to
section 6 of the bill, it is my under-
standing that in the View of some of our
colleagues section 6 does not completely
cover what is desired. The language of
section 6 reads in part as follows:

To slaughter and prepare for the slaughter
of livestock.

The protection would apply to both.
It is my view and opinion that the lan-
guage is adequate. I recognize there is
a difference of opinion. There was a dif- .
ference of opinion expressed in the othe1
body ’

I have no objection to the amend-j
ment offered by the Senator from New
York. It seems to me the amendment
will offer an opportunity, in conference,

‘ to clarify this point beyond the shadow ‘

of a doubt. , , p .

Mr. JAVITS. I yield. “ -

~ Mr. JOHNSON of Texas. Will *the .

Senator explain for the information of

the Senate the purpose of the amend-

ment and What it would do?

Mr. JAVITS I was going to suggest "

that normally one would sit down after
such a pleasant reception, but in this
case I do not feel I have any business in
so doing. This is a matter of deep feel- ,
ings of many people, as those who lis-

t __tened to the debate have heard.

Insofar as one can, undeI the eXisting ‘
parliamentary situation, I am trying to
go some distance toward allaying the
fears of those who may entertain fears.
I hope the Senate will understand the
fundamental situation.

First, my amendment proposes that

, not only slaughtering but also handling

should be encompassed. within the ex-
emption. That was not by any means

- clear, and it is not clear as a matter

of religious law that handling is reg-
ulated by the Jewish practice of shehitah,

as is slaughtering. Nevertheless, one is
so intimately cOnnected with the other
that I do not believe the legislative in-
tent, which I think is clear both in this
body and in the other body, would be
fully realized unless the exemption Were
complete. I feel this is the fundamental
intention of the Senate and of the other.
body. Hence, I am trying to articulate
in words a complete exemption, in terms
of those Who will not eat meat unless it
is slaughtered by ritualistic practices, in
order to protect the practice rather than

‘ to concentrate strictly upon the letter of

 




ﬂ " - mised upon humaneness.

_ the rabbinical law which might be in-
. volved.

As I say, I think that is the funda-
-mental disposition of the Senate.
‘ As to the essential question involved,
let us all understand the Jewish practice

with respect to slaughtering.
Mr. CASE of New Jersey M1. Presi-

’ ‘ dent, may we have order in the Cham-

her?
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
, _ Senator will suspend until there is order
in the Chamber.
‘ The Senator from New York may

7' i proceed.

Mr. \JAVITS. Mr. President, the prac-
ticein respect of slaughtering which is
called shehitah has had for centuries the
sanction of Jewish law which was pre-
Few Members
Were present in the Chamber, unfortu-
nately, when I explained the matter in
great detail'earlier. Sufﬁce it to say, as

~ , early as the time of Moses, the Bible re—

ports that Moses had his ﬁrstaltercation
with the Egyptians of his time because of
their cruelty to domestic animals, and
that one of the reasons the Lord loved
Moses, according to the Old Testament,
was his kindness to animals. So the
practice came down in terms of.law with
respect to a method of slaughter, long
before such a thing was thought of by
other peoples. It was a method of
' slaughter which was humane, surrounded
with careful preparation of the knife and
a perfectly amazing understanding of
anatomy, in terms of the days in .which
this practice came about. The pro-
cedure, as well as anybody could devise,

was quickly and without pain to kill the ‘

animal to be slaughtered. The men who
practiced this art were either so trained
as to be qualiﬁed as rabbis, or were ac-
tually rabbis. A very careful check was
made upon the duratlonvof the license
they had to practice the art.

The important thing is that repre-
sentatives of the Orthodox groups who
testiﬁed before the committee had very
, deep convictions on this subject, repre-
senting the tradition of centuries. The
conviction is this: It has been the tradi-
tion for centuries that the ﬁrst area of
suppression of Jews has always been the
area of
slaughter practice. _.This goes back cen-
turies, and reached a climax in the .pe-
riod of Adolf Hitler, when among the
ﬁrst things tackled in order to suppress
Jewish life was the Jewish p1actice of

‘1 ‘ slaughte1 mg.

In other days—and even today——agi-—.
tators and demagogs of one kind or an-
other, in their drive against the ritual-
,istic slaughter, have identiﬁed them-
selves with humane slaughter, whereas,
as a matter of fact, the method of kosher
slaughter itself is highly humane That
was the effect of the testimony before
the committee.

The Orthodox groups feel that the
very essence of our society is religious
freedom. The moment the Government
is on the positive or negative side, we

4 are capable of impairing the complete
freedom of the practice of religion. "

need of amending the bill twice.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD --— SENATE

with respect to the practice of this free—
dom. .

That is why I voted as I did upon the
question before us, ‘in the hope that the
intervening period of time could be de-

voted to careful study and analysis,

which would satisfy the deeply held con-
viction of a small minority. Neverthe-
less, small minorities in this country

, am very dear to us, and we exert our-

selves to help them.

Now we come to the essence of the
proposalof the Senator from Minnesota.
The bill contains provisions with respect
to kosher slaughter both in section 2 and
section 6. Section 6 is a broad state-
ment of principles. Section 2 is the spe-
ciﬁc operation of the law in respect to
the mechanics of humane slaughter, as
deﬁned by the bill.

The bill does not deal with handling.
As a matter of fact, the exchange of
letters which appears in the House

‘RECORD, and which may appear in the

Senate RECORD—I do notknow exactly
what the Senator from Minnesota placed
in the RECORD—demonstrate that han-
dling was not within the contemplation
of the authors of the exempting amend-7
ment in the other body—at least, not to
the extent that it was translated into
the language of the bill. Therefore,
faced with the parliamentary situation
that was before us, in the endeavor to

make the exemption crystal clear, I,

have offered this amendment, which the
Senator from Minnesota has veiy g1 a-
ciously accepted

Mr. CASE of New Jersey. Mr Piesi-
dent, will the Senator yield?

Mr. JAVITS. I yield. .

Mr. CASE of New Jersey. First of all,

I express my thanks to the Senator from .

New York and my appreciation of the
generosity and understanding of the
Senator from Minnesota in agreeing to
accept the amendment, which I heartin
support.

I have prepared an amendment, which
is at the desk, to accomplish the same
purpose. It is an amendment to section
6 0f the bill. I feel that, as a technical
matter, it would be desirable to adopt
not only the amendment of the Senator
from New York to section 2, but my
amendment to section 6, to make it very
clear that nothing in section 6, which
is a little fuzzy at present, conﬂicts with
this exemption.

Therefore, I ask the Senator from
New York to permit me to join to his
amendment my amendment to section 6;
and I ask the Senator from Minnesota
if he is willing to accept? the joined
amendments.

Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, in
the ﬁrst place there. is no need of any
Second, there is less
I be-
lieve that the amendment of the Sen-
ator from New Jersey is directed to the
prOper place, if we need an amendment.
Section 6 is the clause speciﬁcally aimed
at protecting religious freedom. It pro-
vides as follows:

SEC. 6. Nothing in this act shall be con-
strued to prohibit, abridge, or in any way

hinder the religious freedom of any person _

or group to slaughter and prepare for the
slaughter of livestock in conformity with

July 29,

and requirements of his”

the practices
religion.

That is a clear protection. If there
is need for further clarity, it seems to me
that it should be in section 6, andnot in
section 2.

Mr. CASE of New‘Jersey. Mr. Presi—
dent, will the Senator from New York
yield?

Mr. JAVITS. I yield.

Mr. CASE of New Jersey. I feel that
it is proper to amend the bill, and per-
haps most desirable to amend section 6,
to make it clear that the exemption there
granted refers notonly to the practice
of ritualistic slaughter, which, as the
Senator from New York has‘pointed out,
is speciﬁcally prescribed by religious law,
but also to the preparation and handling,
such preparation being perhaps not so
clearly prescribed by religious ritual.
Therefore section 6 should be amended.

However, I feel, as does the Senator
from New York, that there is nothing
wrong about making it clear in section 2,
the enacting section, that such prepara-
tion and handling are exempted. So I
hope the Senator from Minnesota will be
willing to take these two amendments to

7 conference.

Mr. J AVITS. That would be satisfac-
tory to me. In the conference process
the details could be agreed upon. The
legislative intent would be very clear if

‘both amendments were accepted. If the

Senator from Minnesota is willing, I am
glad to accept the amendment of the
Senator from New Jersey as a pait of my
amendment.

Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, will
the Senator yield?

Mr. JAVITS. I yield.

Mr. HUMPI-IREY. Some of my col-
leagues on this side of the aisle are of

the opinion that the amendment is not

needed. I stated earlier that the express
intent was spelled out in section 6 of the
bill. What I believe to be the legislative .
history of the bill was developed quite
adequately in the other body, and in our
earlier discussions in the Senate. I un-
derstood at that time that no amend-
ment would be offered. I have no par-
ticular personal objection to the amend—
ment, but there are those who feel that
it would clutter up the bill.

The . PRESIDING OFFICER. : The
Parliamentarian informs the Chair that
unanimous consent would be required to
join the two amendments, because they
relate to different sections of the bill.

Does the Senator from New Jersey de-
sire to ask unanimous consent that that
beM done?

.CASE of New Jersey. Mr. P1 es1-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that my
amendment be added to, and made a
part of the amendment of the Senator
from New York, with his “consent.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?

Mr. ANDERSON. I object. ‘

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Obj ec-
tion is heard.

Mr. AIKEN. Mr. President, will the
Senator from New York yield?

Mr. JAVITS. I yield.

Mr. AIKEN. Let me "say to the Sena-
tor from New“ York that, as one of the

 




1958.

members of the committee who voted to
supportthe original bill, which is spon-
sored and supported by the Senator from
Minnesota, I thought the provisions of
the bill amply protected religious ritual;
and until the Senator from New York
raised the question, I still thought so.

Furthermore, I felt that the addition
of any amendments to the bill might
delay its ﬁnal passage, even if it did not
obstruct ﬁnal passage.

However, since the Senator from
Minnesota has already brought about a
change in the Senate committee version
of the bill, I can see no harm in adding
the amendment of the Senator from New
York, if he feels that 'it is needed to
protect the religious ritual of the Jewish
people. I see no objection to it, and will
vote for it.

Mr. JAVITS. I thank the Senator.

Mr. POTTER. Mr. President, will the
Senator yield?

Mr. JAVITS. I yield._

M1. POTTER. I concur in the amend-
ment offered by the Senator from New
York, and also the amendment referred
to by the Senator from New Jersey.

I know that many Orthodox Jews are
greatly concerned over what interpre-
tation might be made in the future with
respect to the ritual in connection with
the slaughtering of animals. If the only
objection to the Senator’s amendment
is that it is already provided for in the
bill, I can see no objection to either the
amendment of the Senator from New
York or the amendment of the Senator
from New Jersey. I hope the committee
will accept both amendments.

Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I invite
attention topage 245 of the hearings,
where Senators will ﬁnd a letter ad-
dressed to the chairman of the Commit—
tee on Agriculture and Forestry. The
letter is signed by R. L. Farrington, gen—
eral counsel, United.-.States Department
of Agriculture. ' The last sentence reads:

For the reasons heretofore ind cated, how-
ever, there is serious question whether the
exemption would extend to the handling of
livestock in connection with slaughter when
the livestock products are intended for
other purposes. ‘

In an exchange of letters between the
Senator from Minnesota [Mr. HUMPH-
REY] and representatives of Jewish
groups—— n

Mr. PASTORE. ..Mr President, may
we have order?

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
PROXMIRE in the chair). The Senator
from New York will suspend until the
Senate is in order. Senators. will desist
from conversation. The Senate will be
in order.

The Senator from New York may pro-
ceed.

Mr. JAVITS. In an exchange of
letters between Representatives POAGE
and the same groups the point was con—
stantly made that handling was not in-
cluded, but that the provision related
to ritualistic slaughter. I divine the
feeling that the exemption should be
made complete in terms of the people
who feel very deeply about shehitah
slaughter, for reasons of tradition, as I
explained earlier.

The pu1pose of my amendment and
the purpose of the amendment of the

fairness and based upon the testimony
before the committee as to the humane-
ness of this method of slaughter. .\

Senator yield?

Mr. JAVITS. I believe I should yield
ﬁrst to the Senator from Rhode Island.
Then I shall be happy to yield to the
Senator from Minnesota.

Mr. PAST'ORE. I wish to compliment
the Senator from New York for the
splendid way in which he has stated his
position. He has done it with clarity
and simplicity and with great sincerity.
A great many people in my State have
spoken .to me of their very strong con-
victions about this matter. When we
begin to legislate, and reach out and
seem to touch, whether it be by impli-

, cation, inference, or otherwise, the sensi—

tivity of religious groups in their belief,
we ought to be veiy careful that we do
not offend anyone.

I believe the suggestion which is being
made by the Senator from New Y01k is
fair. If it is redundant in any way, cor-
rection can be made in conference. 'All
the Senator from New York is suggest—
ing is that the two amendments be
taken to conference. .If it is felt that
the bill does not put the proper umbrella
over the convictions of a certain group,
or groups, who sincerely believe in their
religious rituals, I see no harm in ac-
cepting the amendments and taking
them to conference. If’the matter needs
clear-ing, it can there be made abun-
dantly and effectively clear. We will
have made a legislative record whereby
there will be no doubt in anyone’s mind
that we have no intention of offending
anyone in his religious convictions.

Mr. THYE. Mr. President, will the
Senator yield?

Mr. JAVITS. I now yield to the Sen-
ator from Minnesota.

Mr. THYE. As one who served on the
subcommittee and who conducted some
of the hearings when representatives of
religious groups were before the .com—

mittee and stated their objections to .
certain provisions of the bill, which tes-‘

timony brought about the committee
amendment to the bill, I can say very
frankly that one reason for my support-
ing the‘committee amendment was sim-
ply that it seemed to me the bill, with-
out the committee amendment, con-
ﬂicted with the religious convictions of
some people in the countr.y The foun-
dation strength of these United States
is the respect we have for one another’s
religious convictions. I for one would
never vote for any legislative enact—
ment which would-in any sense offend
the religious conviction of1 any person.
It was for that 1eason that I supported
the committee amendment.

The other reason was that them is
not sufﬁcient infmmation available re-
lating to the captive bolt pistol as a
method of rendering an animal. sense-
less. I know enough about the handling
of livestock to be aware that anyone

who undertakes to make an animal
senseless with a captive bolt pistol has
a job on his hands. I am referring to
the pistol, and the problem of t1ying to
get the pistol aimed at the head of, an
animal in a chute, whenothe animal has
already become excited because of being
driven into the chute.

I sat in two subcommittee meetings
when I was the only Senator present,
and I conducted the hearing when more
than 20 Rabbis begged the committee
not to take any action which would im-
pinge on their, religious convictions. I
felt we were justiﬁed in reporting the
committee amendment.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
Senator from Minnesota will suspend
until the Senate is in order. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota cannot be heard.
Senators will desist from conversation;
The Senator from Minnesota may pro-
ceed. ‘ '

Mr. THYE. .For that reason also I
supported the committee amendment.
The Senator from New York is asking
only for what is proper. He is asking,
that the proposed amendment be taken
to conference. It is not right to give

a great many people the impression that . ”I

what they have been taught in their
religious beliefs is being placed in jeop-
ardy by a legislative proposal passed by
the Senate.

'the attention of the Senator from Min-

nesota and . the Senator from New
York. -I may be treading where angels

fear to tread; but I am no' angel. I

voted against the committee amend-‘
ment because I believe the record on
the bill is a very complete one. The
basic controversy seems to be over the
issue which has been mentioned by the
Senator from New York. I wish. to ..
raise two questions in regard to it, in
order to have his advice and counsel
before I vote on the amendment. 5 '

We all know that representatives of
the Orthodox Jewish faith have con—
ferred with many ‘of us. We have be-
fore us not only a question of their” deep
religious beliefs, but also the question
as to what is humane slaughter. _

I believe it goes without saying that
basic in the Jewish faith is a tenderness
and a kindliness and a humane attitude
toward dumb beasts. There is cer-
tainly no basis for any assumption that
the Orthodox Jewish religion seeks to
use any method of slaughter which in
our day would be considered inhu-
mane. ' \

I may say to the Senator from New
York that the question which has been
raised by some Orthodox rabbis with the
senior Senator from Oregon in "regard
to an exemption, may. seemingly give

the impression, although false, that this

group of Jews is seeking some sort of
exception to humane slaughter. I-be—
lieve we ought to keep the record per—
fectly clear on this question, because I
know that no greater disservice could
be performed by us to the Orthodox
Jews of America than to let legislation

7. ,go through the Senate which offers a

basis for the allegation that We have

provided the Orthodox Jews with an

exception to a humane slaughter bill.
7, I do not believe we can stress that
1'” point too much. The record ought to
i? be crystal clear on that point. Re-
' Cently as this afternoon some Orthodox
rabbis expressed to me their great con-
cern about it. It is true that they
wished to postpone the consideration of
. However, as

this afternoon as to whether we have
sufﬁcient facts in the record on which
to base our decision whether the bill
.should- be passed or defeated—either
» one, depending on the will of the
.. Senate.
_ I am satisﬁed we have the record, and
we ought simply to come to grips now
with the one issue which seems to me is

° 1 the stumbling block in the path of the

thinking of many of us. 1 If the amend-
ment provides an exception for the or-
thodox Jews of the country, so far as
humane slaughtering is concerned, I
shall vote against the exception because,

gas a matter of public policy, in my judg-

ment, we should pass legislation that
provides for humane slaughtering every-
. where in the United States. ‘

I do not accept the notion that reli-
gious freedom entitled anyone to in-
dulge in inhumane slaughtering prac-
tices. But I am satisﬁed that the bill as
worded, although it will be strengthened,
If I understand the purpose of the
, amendment of the Senator from New

York correctly, protects the orthodox
Jews in their present ritual, in that their
present ritual conforms'to the humane
slaughtering criteria of the bill. I desire
.to be advised as to whether I am right
or wrong about that. 1

,That leads .me *_-t0 ' the technical
slaughtering question, about which I am
. not well informed. I should like to have

either the Senator from New York or the

Senator from Minnesota, or some other .

Senator, advise me in regard to it. Am
, I correctly informed that under the rit—
ual of the Orthodox Jews there is a deep
belief that in order to meet the slaugh-
tering requirements, which for centu1 1es
have been traditiOnally a part of the
faith and for which there are some very
interesting historical background rea-
sons, the animal should be bled to death;
and that under the bill, the bleeding
could still take place, but there would be
[a requirement that the animal ﬁrst be
stunned? In other words, that the
, bleeding take place while the animal is
in a stunned condition, and that, there-
fore, technically the ritual requirement
of the orthodox Jewish faith is met un-
der the bill. ..
1 As I understand, the Senator from
New York seeks only to make that
understanding perfectly clear by his
amendment, and the amendment does
not, in effect, make an exception for the
orthodox Jews in relation to other
slaughtering methods in this country.
Mr. JAVITS. If the testimony before

" .' the committee is evaluated, the ‘case is

ing ample scientiﬁc evidence that the

method of slaughter in which they en—

ophy on which it is based. This was
the basis, as I understand, upon which
the committee in the other body acted.

I assume it is the basis of the record on
which the Senate has acted.

Mr. THYE. Mr‘." President, will the
Has the Senator from
New York ﬁnished?

Mr. JAVITS. I have not ﬁnished, but
I am glad to yield.

M1. THYE. I thank the Senator from
New York.

In the committee hearings, when the
question was raised whether it was more
humane to bleed an animal to death
than it was to try to stun it before the
bleeding, neither the veterinarians nor
anyone else was able ﬁnally to deter—
mine which was the more humane
method. ,

I went into the committee room with

an open mind and sat through the ‘ex—'

tensive hearings. _I was shown a captive
bolt pistol. Any Senator who has han-
dled livestock andhas endeavored to get
in front of an animal’s head when the
animal has already been excited by han-
dling in the various chutes through
which it is necessary to drive it, and
then takes a captive belt pistol and tries
to strike the head of the animal, knows
he has to pull the trigger. If he pulls
the trigger at the time the animal turns
his head, and happens to hit the animal
in the eye or upon the ear or somewhere
else, what has he done? _ Has he
stunned the animal? No; he has in-
censed or crazed the animal.

Which is worse? To let a man who
has become quite proﬁcient at swinging
a hammer hit the animal with a sledge-
hammer, and have just as good a chance
of hitting the target of the head of the
animal, or to let him try to use ‘a pistol

which has a captive bolt, and actually '

tried to shoot the animal in the fore-
head?

After sitting through the hearings, ‘I
have ﬁnally arrived at the conclusion
that’I am not certain whether the cap-
tive bolt is the proper way to stun an
animal.

I know the gas chamber is a proper
way, so far as concerns what the animal

looks like when it comes out of the,

chute, because I have stood in the
Hormel plant in Minnesota and watched
animals come into the building and be
conveyed to the chamber. I heard no
sound. I saw the animal come out at
the other end of the chute, lying as
senseless as an ear of corn or a cord-
wood stick.

I do not know what happened in the
mind of the hog in the Chamber. I know
I did not volunteer to follow the hog in
there, because I was not certain what
my own. reaction would be inside the
chamber. I do not know what the hog’s
was. The veterinarians did not tell us
what the hog’s thoughts were while it
was going into the chamber.

All of those were questions as to which
I could not make up my mind. ‘ I ﬁnally
came to the conclusion that since there
were 30 rabbis in the hearing room, all of
them excited, not knowing whether they
could accept the language because they
did not know whether it would- interfere

July 29’

with their religious convictions or not,
I would not be the one who would disturb
that particular group of people in this
land.

Then, when I asked the veterinarians
which was the proper way of making an
animal senseless, they could not-answer
me.

So the best I could do was to set a
positive time in which the industry would
have to determine the method by which
they intended to make the animal sense-
less, and in a manner which would satisfy

' a certain Jewish body’s religious convic-

tions.

That was why I voted as I did. , I have
answered‘Tnore mail on the question of
humane slaughter than I have on mutual
security or military appropriations in the
course of the past months. I expect to
answer many more questions on humane
slaughter in the future.

I am simply saying that the foundation
upon which the strength of America was
built is that we respect one another’s
religious convictions, and that we will not
in any sense disturb or jeopardize any
person’s right to worship God in the way
he learned to do it at his mother’s knee.
I am not one who wishes to interfere with
the practice of his religion by anyone
who worships God as he learned to do it
.at his mother’s knee.

That is why I voted for the committee
amendment. It is only a. matter of less
than 18 months until the industry must.
decide what it will do or else be compelled
to act.

Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I should

like to ﬁnish my reply to the Senator
from Oregon [Mn MORSE].
, I think the groups in this particular
area, which appeared . and testiﬁed in
opposition did not feel they could accept
any bill ‘which did not- contain such an
amendment as I have offered. Their po—
sition was clear and precise. The min-
ute the Government intruded into this "
problem, they felt there was an impair-
ment of their exercise of religion. That
was the situation we faced up until
about 20 minutes ago. Now the Senate
has expressed itself in correlation with
the House. .

New the very same groups will not
have an opportunity to appear and tees--
tify before the committee again. The
bill will roll right into conference from
here. Therefore, I am trying, I assure
my colleague—it is not a happy, job—of
my desire to keep all the doors open, so
that in‘the conference, at least, what
might have been done in the committee
room will be capable of accomplishment.

If my amendment shall not be ac-
cepted, then the provision will stand
exactly as it is.

Those to whom I have reference have
not even addressed themselves to
whether the bill is satisfactory. The
only thing we have is an exchange of
correspondence _in which A asked B, to
wit, the author in the other body,

" whether this language is acceptable, and

B said “No.” ,

I could not even get them to tell me
the amendment was satisfactory. All I
am t1ying to do is to give the conferees
an opportunity to consider the matter,
now that the group in question mUSt

cope with the reality of the situation, so
that the parliamentary situation will
not foreclose them.
' If anyone can think of a better pro-
cedu1e, I shall be delighted to have him
state it.
Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President will
the Senator from New York yield to me?
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
PROXMIRE in the chair). Does the Sena-
tor from New York yield to the Senator
from Minnesota?
M11. JAVITS. I yield.
- Mr. HUMPHREY. First of all, let us
get the RECORD straight. The bill as
passed by the House of Representatives
will not be operative until 18 months
have passed. The study bill would have
been operative in 2 years. So the differ-
ence is only 6 months.
Furthermore, the Department of Agri-

culture has had years in which to make .

the study. Nevertheless, those who have
been objecting to the bill ask for more
time for study. Two years ago, when
we were considering a bill which pro-
vided for 5 years of study, the opponents
of the pending bill were even opposed to
that proposal. f
Furthermore, in response to the ques—
tion asked by the Senator from Oregon
let me say that subsection (b) of section
2 is an affirmative ﬁnding by the Con-
gress, to the effect that the slaughtering
method known as kosher slaughtering
is a humane type of slaughtering within
the statement of public policy set forth
in the bill. Testimony onthat subject

, has been taken; and in that connection

I refer my colleagues to the testimony
taken in 1956, as set forth on pages 142

through 145. That testimony was given

as a result of scientiﬁc study. .

So, when some say they have not
heard anyone comment on whether the
kosher method of slaughtering is hu-
mane, let me point out that there is no
denial that there was presented before
the committee testimony that that
method of slaughtering, as described in
subsection (b) of section 2, falls within
the modern deﬁnition of humane
slaughtering.

Of course, no method of slaughtering

is par ticulaily kind, the question is one '

of degree.

But in the case of the amendment
which is being offered, I believe it should
‘ be noted that section 6 of the bill does
not apply only. to the Jewish faith; in-
stead it applies to any religion 01 any
religious faith, and it provides an excep-
tion based on the fact that Congress
simply cannot make a law which would
deny religious freedom, for such a law
would be unconstitutional. -

Therefore, section 6 is an expression
of intent, so as to make perfectly clear
that there will be no infringement at all
upon religious freedom, since an in-

fr ingement upon religious freedom Would -

be unconstitutional.

So the bill contains an afﬁrmative ﬁnd-
ing in favor of kosher slaughtering, al-
though no exemption is given to it as
such

M1. ANDERSON. Mr. President, will
the Senat01 from New York yield to me?

Mr. JAVITS. Of course. But, ﬁrst——
. so the Senate will understand my objec-

tive; and" apparently the Senator from
Oregon does understand it, regardless of
whether he agrees with me—I should like
to read my amendment, as follows:

Handling in connection with such slaugh- '

tering which necessarily accompanies the
method of slaughter described in subsection
(b) of this section shall be deemed to comply
with the public policy speciﬁed by this sec-
tion.

In short, I, myself—and I say this
honestly—I have not received any help;
I have not even had the help of the
group-s which this amendment is de—
signed to help—-—I drafted a provision
which I hope will keep the door open, so
the enf01 cement will be conﬁned to the
enf01 cement of what I believe this body
and the othe1 body intend.

Mr. MORSE. Mr. President, will the
Senator from New York yield to me?

Mr. JAVITS. Iyield.

Mr. MORSE. Let me say that I never
would be a' party to a restriction ,of a
religious faith. But I respectfully dissent
from one comment the Senator from
Minnesota [M12 HUMPHREY] made,
namely; that it would be unconstitu-

tional to prohibit a religious practice._

Certainly that is not the case, at all.

Mr. HUMPHREY. If I said that, I
was in error, I admit.

M11. MORSE Under the Constitution,
any interference with a 1eligious faith
is prohibited.

Certainly I have no desire to interfere

with kosher slaughtering methods. I

merely raise the point of whether the
bill, as it came to us, and the Senator
has cleared up the point for me, covers
kosher-slaughtering methods. Now that
point has been cleared up.

Mr. HUMPHREY. That is correct-

Mr. MORSE. Next, I ask whether an '

exception was requested. If that point
has already been covered,-then I raise
the policy question of whether it is wise

. to seem to give the impression that we ’

would be making an exception.

Mr. HUMPHREY. I think the Sena-
tor’s point is quite valid.

Mr. ANDERSON. Mr. President——

“ Mr. J AVITS. I am glad to yield to the
Senator from New Mexico.

,Mr. ANDERSON. I wish to ask the
Senator from New York two questions:

First, did the Senator from New York
present or submit the amendment, or did
anyone else submit a similar amendment,
to the Committee on Agriculture and
Forestry, when the committee was trying
to wrestle with this matter?

M11. JAVIT S. The answer is “no”;
and in extenuation of my position, I can
only refer to‘ the frank explanation I
have given to the 'Senate‘; namely,’that
one who tried to handle this matter
could not obtain help from anyone else.

Mr. ANDERSON. I understand.

Certainly the Congress has been wres-
tling with this problem for many years;
this is not the ﬁrst time it has been
encountered.

Furthermore,

in the Department of
Agricultuie the problem has been wres-
tled with for round after round aftei
, round.

a Does the Senator from New York know
whether Orthodox Jews, in their testi-
mony before the committee, stated that

14093

they could not ﬁnd words to express the

.exact desire they have had in reference

to this matter?

I think the chairman of the committee
has so testiﬁed; and I believe that is so.

I only say to the Senator from Min-
nesota and to other Senators who may
be interested that if they wish to kill
the bill, this is a good way to start
killing it.

Mr. HUMPHREY. I hope the Senator
from New Mexico understands that I do
not want to kill the bill.

Mr. ANDERSON Of course I realize
that.

At one time I intended to vote for the
committee amendment. However, I be-
lieve that the Senator from Minnesota
and the Senators associated with him
have come up with a provision which
offers as good a solution—4n other words,
to provide that the study be made for 18
months, rather than 2 years.

At one time I had the delicate respon~
sibility of trying to operate every

slaughterhouse in the United States,

because at that time the Government
had taken them ever and the. Depart—
ment of Agriculture operated them. I
found that a great many religious prac— ,
tices were involved. . , '

I do not care to be in the position of
having to arbitrate ‘a ﬁght between 2
religious groups, because that would be
worse than trying to arbitrate a ﬁght be—
tween 2 brothers. .

I say that we should either pass this ‘
bill as it now stands or recommit it, for
further study.

Everyone who has t1 ied to a1r1ve at an
acceptable legislative provision in con—1.
nection with this matter has found it
impossible to ﬁnd words upon which all
the groups involved would agree- I
imagine that thousands of such attempts
have been made; and each “time one
group 01 anothei has 1efused to accept
the language p10posed. '

If the bill goes to conference, it will be
wrangled with until too late in the session
for a conference report to “be agreed
upon by the confeiees and then to be
agreed to by both Houses.

At one time I told the Senato1 from
Louisiana that I would suppert his posi—
tion; and I thought he did the right
thing in reporting the committee amend-
ment. But then I found much opposi—
tion to it. So I said, “Very well; if others
can work out the problem, let them go
ahead and do so; and let those who say
that the provision will imperil the groups
they represent or the groups in which
they are interested show in 18 months
how it will imperil them.” ,

I think the provisions proposed will
protect the handling.

The Department of Agriculture has
wrestled a dozen times with the problem ‘
of ﬁnding an acceptable solution, and
representatives of the religious groups
have tried to ﬁnd an acceptable solu—
tion. But eveiy time, the attempts end
in controve1sy

Is the Senato1 from New York familiar
with the fact that when the representa—
tives of the Orthodox Jews were asked
to submit language which would be ac—
ceptable to them, they said they were
unable to propose language which they

 




' - dent, will the Senator yield?

14094

thought would be acceptable fo1 inclu-
sion in a slaughtering bill? '_

Mr. JAVITS. Yes; I have stated the
reason for that position, which is that

7 LI; 1- any legislation at all would be so con-
‘ 1 trary to their position that they could

not suggest anything in the way of an
amendment, and they would not.
. Mr. ANDERSON. That is correct.
Mr. JAVITS. Or perhaps they could,
but they would not.
Mr. ANDERSON Then why not sim-

ply vote against the bill?

, Mr. JAVITS. But now we are faced
~ with a new situation, namely, that a bill

‘ __On this subject will be passed.

All I am trying to do is make it pos-
sible for the Congress to pass a bill which
. will include provisions under which these

‘ groups can operat3.
' The Senator from Minnesota already
has submitted amendments. In View of

I ‘ _ the adoption of the amendments, the

bill must go to conference, unless the
other body accepts the Senate’s version
of the bill. But if the other body does
not accept the amendments which have
been agreed to by the Senate, the bill,
as thus amended, will have to go to
conference.

However, in connection with proposed
legislation in this ﬁeld, there never has
been a time when the Senate and the
House were fairly close together. .

.~ So I say we should at least leave this
door open, so those who have deep feel-
ings on this Subject—even though they
are a minority; nevertheless, even a
minority is entitled to co-nsideratiOn—
may have an opportunity to have pro-
visions under which they. can operate
enacted into law. Therefore, I urge
that the bill which will be passed be
put into the shape which the other body
and which the Senate, believes it should
be in, to wit, so that the bill will pro-
vide that ritualistic slaughter shall not
be subject to the regulations of the De—
partment of Commerce.

That is What I have requested; and I
belieVe that such a provision is-in ac-
cord with the spirit of the bill as passed
by the House of Representatives.

Assuredly, one can conjure up all kinds
of objections, including the one that an
effort is going to be made to kill the bill;
but there has been a majority vote in
the Senate. From what I know abdut
thelegislative practices, this bill is going
to pass both Houses at this session. At

least, let us give an opportunity to those

who feel so deeply about the question to
have something to say about the provi-
, sion which will be made for them.
Mr. HICKENLOOPER. Mr.

Presi-

MI‘. JAVITS. I yield.
Mr. HICKENLOOPER. I Should like

‘3 to ask the Senator, from New York if he‘

_ has given thought to what‘could or could
not be a most signiﬁcant step, that is,
whether by the bill Congress is assuming
jurisdiction, either aﬁii mativély or nega-

” tively, to pass on a religious problem. I

assure the Senator I believe Congress can
do things afﬁrmatively 01 negatively, but
it makes no differenCe whether we make

to grant jurisdiction in a ﬁeld "that has
to do purely and solely with a deep reli—

gious belief which has existed for ages.

Mr. JAVITS. I suggest to the Senator
from Iowa that I argued the point at
great length in laying before the Sen-
ate the position of the Orthodox groups,
which was exactly as it has been ex-
pressed by the Senator from Iowa. But
the Senate has gone beyond that point.
We are faced with a realistic situation.

I laid the other argument before the

Senate in great detail. It was my privi-
lege‘to do so. It was done fairly. That
matter has been completed. Now we are
dealing with a practical question. Now
we are dealing with a situation in con—
nection with which I am trying to give
both sides an opportunity to have their
position realized and dealt with.

Mr. MUNDT. Mr. President, will the
Senator yieid?

Mr. JAVITS. I yield to the Senator
from South Dakota.

Mr. MUNDT. As a member of the
Committee on Agriculture and Forestry,
which has studied this question and has
held hearings on it during two sessions
of the Congress, I wish to say the Sen-

ator from New York, who is not a mem- -

ber of the committee, responded to a
question by the distinguishedSenator
from New Mexico as to whether or not
an amendment of this type «had been
placed before the committee, and he
rightly'said, “NO.” But the Senator’s

amendment along this line, and other

amendments, were discussed as an out-
growth of the hearings, and were con-

sidered at great length by the commit—‘
" tee.

Wewere confronted with the difﬁ-
culty which now confronts the Senate—-
as to whether or not Congress can state
the matter sufﬁciently well to preclude
a perhaps overly ambitious solicitor from
making a ﬁnding that this type of ritual-
istic slaughtering. is covered by the act.
It is pretty difﬁcult to make a ﬁnding
in a legislative act or by a committee as
to whether any kind of slaughtering is
humane or inhumane. I would assume
use of a gas chamber is a humane type
of slaughtering, because that type of
execution sometimes is used for human
Then we run into the contro—
versy of whether it is humane to the
animal, but inhumane to the human bie-
ings who eat the ﬂesh of that animal.
Does it contaminate the meat, or does
the so-called humane slaughter process
have a destructive result on the edibility
of the meat?

I have supported the chairman of the
committee on the proposition that what
we should do is have the matter studied
at a. high level, so a commission which
had sufﬁcient time to operate could
bring before it religious leaders, veter-
inarians, health authorities, and scien-

.tists, in an attempt to arrive at a pro-

gram which would be satisfactory to all.

.I think we are ﬂirting with dynamite’
when we try to legislate in a ﬁeld which
is as beclo-uded with fuzzy issues as this
one is.

I agree the Javits-Case amendments
make it a little clearer. Despitethe at—
tempt of the Senator from Minnesota to
make it clear in the original bill, and in
spite of the effort to make it clear on
the ﬂoor of the House, it is quite obvious
that just as it is unclear to Members of

July 29

the Senate today it may well be unclear
to a Government solicitor in the future.

I think we should be careful when we
legislate in a ﬁeld such as this. I have
had a great many persons from the
Orthodox Jewish faith come to me. I
do not think we have one tabernacle in
my whole State with a completely Orth—
dox congregation. We have tabernacles,
but do not think they are of the Orth-
odox faith. I think, however, the mem—
bers "of this faith, have made a good
point. I listened to them. They were
sincere. The-y were devo-terdly convinced
that'rituals of their particular religious
faith were being placed in jeopardy by
our action here. I do not think we do
it intentionally, but in the enthusiasm
of trying to adopt a good bill for some,
we can, in my opinion, bring great in-
jury to others. "

I feel the Senate made a mistake
when, by a very narrow margin, it de-
clined the opportunity to have the bill
studied under the preferred kind of cir-
cumstances suggested, where represent-
atives of the Orthodox faith and of
other religions could be heard, where
they would know, a date having been
ﬁxed, Congress was going to enact some
kind of a humane, slaughtering process. .

I do not know whether shooting an

animal in the head 1s more humane than .

hitting him on the head with a ham-
mer. If I were going to operate a pistol
and aim it at a calf, I would rather, if I
were [a Calf, take a chance with a ham-
mer in the hands of my friends, who
would. probably hit more accurately
than I would be able toshoot.

I shall support the amendment. I
think it clariﬁes the bill. But I must
cOnfess, even with that clarifying lan-
guage, I still think we are entering into a
very tricky ﬁeld, utterly unaware of what
chain of circumstances may eventuate,

, because here among ourselves, men of

good intention Cannot agree to what is .
being actually said or implied. ‘ ‘

I think if we are going to protect the
practice of ritualistic slaughtering efﬁec-
tively, we can do it best by making the
type of exemption the Senator from Ore-
gong would not apprOve—simply say,
“You a1e exempt.” I think we would be
on much ﬁrmer ground by saying, “You
are exempt” when we have heard that
veterinarians diffe1 on the question of
what is humane slaughtering, rather
than run the risk some GOvernment vet;
erinarian or solicitor may decide, that
ritualistic animal killing is not humane.

Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, will
the Senator yield?

Mr. MUNDT. I yield.

M1. HUMPHREY. I wish to point out
that in 1956, all the Senators who have
spoken, with the exception of the Sena-
tor from New York [Mr,_ JAVITS], voted
unanimOusly for a bill which deﬁned
humane slaughtering in the same lan-
guage. In 1956 the Senate voted unani-
mously a bill recognizing kosher slaugh-
tering as humane.

Is it not interesting, all at once, that
most of those who now are so concerned
about amending the bill have been op-
posed to it in the ﬁrst place? Is it not
further interesting that in the bill now
before the Senate it is provided the com-

 




1958

mittee to be appointed shall include rep-
resentatives of religious group, slaughter-
houses, and humane associations? That
advisory committee is directed to advise
the Secretary on further problems re-,
lated to humane slaughter methods.
Eighteen months is already provided for
the advisory committee to make further
suggestions tolthe Secretary of Agricul-
ture, but it happened that ~ the amend-
ment we rejected provided for 24 months.
That is a difference of 6 months. -

I heard the Senator from South Da-
kota say that under the Senate commit-
tee amendment, we would have had a
ﬁne study forz years, and’it would have
been followed by action.

May I say, most respectfully, there
is an advisory committee provided for

under the language of the bill as passed

by the House. The advisory committee
would work by direction with the Sec-
retary for the purpose of examining into
further humane practices.

Mr. NEUBERGER. Mr. President-—

Mr. JAVITS. I yield to the Senator
from Oregon.

Mr. NEUBERGER. I should like to
obtain the floor in my own right, to com-
ment brieﬂy upon the Senator’s amend-
ment.

Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I yield
. the floor.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
Senator from Oregon is recognized.

Mr. NEUBERGER. May we have
order, Mr. President?

The ' PRESIDING OFFICER. The
Senate will be in order. Senators will
desist from audible conversation.

_ The Senator from Oregon may pro-
ceed.

Mr. NEUBERG-ER. Mr. President, I
should like to have the RECORD to show
that in my opinion section 6 of the bill,
as it came from the House of Repre-
sentatives and as it is presently before
the Senate, more than adequately pro-
tects any ritual slaughter. In my opin-
ion, the section is adequate, is effective,
and is all that is vitally necessary-

I desire to say also that in all serious-
ness I think, before the issue is raised
on the ﬂoor of the Senate that some-
body’s religions freedom is in danger,
the problem should be thought through
as to exactly what we mean. When I
think of religious freedom I do not think
of a way of slaughtering an animal or
“a way of operating a hospital, but I think

of how a person is going to commune-

with his or her Creator in a place of
worship—in a church, in a synagogue,
in a cathedral, in the great outdoors, or
in any other place where that individual
prays and worships.

I was a member of the State legisla-
ture in the State of Oregon for many
years,- as was my wife with me. We dis-
cussed this matter last night, and my
wife reminded me that we had a Spokes-
man at the Oregon Legislature of the
Christian Science faith. The Christian
Scientists were concerned about a good
deal of State legislation which dealt with
physical examinations in the schools,
with requirements of vaccination of stu-
ents, for cards which had to do with

ac examination of cooks and waitresses
*or tuberculosis, venereal disease, or

\

No. 128—8

other things which might be contagious
with respect to food handling. But I
want to say that the Christian Science
representative in the. Oregon State Leg-
islature, to the memory of my wife and
me, never came to us when he was in-
terested in legislation which dealt with
public matters, to claim that the reli-
gious freedom of the Christian Scientists
was in jeopardy because of a particular
piece of health legislation before the
Oiegon State Legislature. This was to
his great credit.

He might not have agreed with the leg-
islation. He might have suggested an
amendment. He might have thought the
bill as written in that particular detail

, was inadvisable. However, he never said

to us, “This inteferes with religious free-
dom.”

I want to say I believe there is a differ-
ence between some custom in slaughter-
ing an animal Or some method of operat—
ing a hospital 01 1equiring a food han-
dler’ 3 card, and whether a man is free
to go to church or other place of wor-
ship of his choice and to commune with
his Creator as he sees ﬁt. , If any such
legislation interfering with worship were
proposed, of course it would be an out-

rage and contrary to all the traditions 4
j I turn to page 1 of the bill as reported by

and legacies of this great country.

I think before the issue is raised on
the ﬂoor of the Senate of the United
States that religious freedom is in dan—
ger, everyone who proposes to raise the
issue should think the matter all the way
through; because the people who founded
this country, when they thought of reli-
gious freedom, thought. of it in terms of
the valiant Pilgrim Fathers, who had to
leave England because the soldiers of the
crown forcibly kept them from entering
"the church of their choice. “That is what
religious freedom has meant in the his—
tory of this country, and I do not believe

we should use that te1m lightly when d1s- —
cussing this or any other proposed legis-,

lation.
SEVERAL SENATORS. Vote! Vote! Vote!
’Mr. CASE of New Jersey. Mr. Presi-
dent, I wish to add a word. I regret that
it is not possible for the Senate to vote
on the amendment offered by the Sena-
tor from New York and on my amend-
ment at the same time.
amendments are di1ected toward the
same purpose, and I think together they
might do an adequate job. I feel that
both amendments should be agreed to.
Whether or not the amendment offered
by the Senator from New York is
agreed to, I expect to offer my amend—
ment, and I hope it will be agreed to.
' As the Senator from Rhode Island
[Mr. PASTORE] said, Mr. President, I see
no reason why we should not, if we can—-:
and I know we can—so amend the bill as
to maintain its essential purposes and
avoid offending very deeply a minority,
however small, which regards the matter
with Which we are here concerned to be
essential to its religious faith and prac-
tices. That is the test, Mr. President. It
is not a question of what we think an-
other man’ s religion ought to be, but in-
stead a question of what he sincerely and

'deeply believes is essential to his re-

ligious conviction, faith, and observance.

Both the ‘

~ 14095‘

That, I am certain, is what is intended
by the provision of the Constitution of ‘
the United States. Therefore, I hope
very deeply, as one who voted against
the committee amendment and for the
language of the Humphrey amendment,
which is the language of the House bill,
that the amendment of the Senator from
New York will be agreed to, and that
thereafter my amendment, to section
6 of the bill will also be agreed to. _

SEVERAL SENATORS. Vote! Vote! Vote!

Mr. O’MAHONEY. Mr. President,
during the debate I have been reading
the language of the bill as it passed the
House. As I read the language, I'cannot
fail to wonder whether the Members "of

» the Senate who voted to reject the com-

mittee amendment have also read it.
The bill is not grammatical. The bill
is not logical. It provides no certain
deﬁnition. It is not a model. of legal
draftsmanship. .,It does not deﬁne hu-
mane Slaughter. If it is enacted into law,
it will become an instrument of creating
litigation, rather than promoting hu—
mane slaughter.

It is only necessary, Mr. President, to
read the language of the bill which is
before us if we want to know what We _
are trying to put upon the statute books.

the committee, with the lined type ap-y
pearing on pages 1,2, 3, 4, 5, and a good
part of page 6, to set forth the measure.
as it passed the House. I ask my col-
leagues to indulge me while I begin to
read from the language, beginning on
page 1, line 11:

It is therefore declared to be the pelicy .
of the United States that the slaughtering
of livestock and the handling of livestock

‘in connection with slaughter shall be car-

ried out only by humane methods.

That is the end of section 1. One
would imagine that somewhere in the bill >
there would appear language to deﬁne
speciﬁcally what humane methods are.
Do we ﬁnd such language? No, we ﬁnd
only the pretenSe. We ﬁnd a declaration '
of two methods which are said to be
humane, and we ﬁnd a declaration dele-
gating to the Secretary of Agriculture
the authority to determine what humane
slaughter is.

Are we the legislative body, or is the
Department of Agriculture the legislative 7
body? Does anybody deubt the accuracy
of my statement? Let us proceed to read
further.

Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, will
the Senator yield? ,

Mr. O’ MAHONEY. I will yield in a
moment. ’ .

Mr. HUM’PHREY. The Senator want-
ed to know if anybody doubted the ac-
curacy of the statement.

Mr. O’MAHONEY. Just a moment,
please. I will not yield at this time.

I continue to read:

No method of slaughtering or handling in
connection with slaughtering shall be deemed
to comply with the public policy of the
United States unless it is humane.

Apparently that is a restatement of
the policy—-

No method of slaughtering or handling in
connection with slaughtering shall be
deemed to comply with the public policy of
the United States unless it is humane.

\
\

 




?”‘*.j 14096“

The next sentence reads:
Either of the following two methods of
slaughtering and handling are—f- ,

' I am not being ungrammatical.
is the language of the bill—-

Either of the following two methods of
slaughtering and handling are hereby found
to be humane.

Mr. DOUGLAS. Mr.
the Senator yield?

Mr. O’MAHONEY. I decline to yield
at the moment.

This

President, will

, Either of the following two methods of?”

slaughtering and handling are hereby found
to be humane.

Of course, that should read “Either
"‘ * * is—” .

Mr. DOUGLAS. Mr.
the Senator yield?

Mr. O’ MAHONEY. I decline to yield.

After the colon, we find, language
'which purports to describe the humane
method. Let us read it:

(a) in the case of cattle, calves, horses,
mules, sheep, swine, and other livestock, all
animals are rendered .insensible to pain by a
single blow or gunshot or an electrical,
chemical or other means that is rapid and
effective, before being shackled, hoisted,
thrown, cast, or cut;

What is meant by “other means that
r. is rapid and effective, before being
' shackled, hoisted, thrown, cast, or cut”?
Three or four lawyers might gather to
debate precisely what the meaning of
that deﬁnition of humane slaughter is.

Now we come to line 15, subsection
(b). I shall not read that, but shall
' content myself with calling attention to

President, will

the fact that this is a parag aph which. A

attempts to protect the kosh r method
of slaughtering. It does not say What
'it is. Otherwise, there would not be an
; amendment offered to it new. It is not
clear. Neither is the amendment clear,
because, as we have heard, there is dis-
agreement among members of the Jew-
ish faith as to what the system of kosher
slaughtering should be, and how it
should be described in words and
ﬁgures.

We have now come to the end of sec-
tion 2. Have we had a deﬁnition of
“humane slaughter”? There is no such
deﬁnition in subsection (d) because
Members of the Senate this afternoon
have been debating about the uncer-
tainty of that language.

Mr. DOUGLAS. Mr. President, is the
Senator asking, a rhetorical question, or
an actual Question?

Mr. O"MAHONEY. This is a rhetori-
cal - question. ‘

I proceed with my rhetorical analysis
of the bill. We come now to section 3:

The public policy declared herein shall be
taken into consideration by all agencies of
the Federal Government—-

Why does it not read “shall be fol-
lowed by all agencies of the Federal Gov-
ernment”? That is too speciﬁc. That is
too clear. That is too deﬁnite. That is
too mandatory. So we are to have de-

bating societies in all the agencies of ,
the Government, to determine what hum

mane slaughter is.

which in any of its plants or in any plants
of any slaughterer or processor with which
it is afﬁliated slaughters or handles in con-
nection with slaughter livestock by any
methods other than methods—-

Does it say “described in section 2”?
No; that would .be too clear. It goes

"off on another tangent—-

methods other than methods designated and.
approved by the Secretary of Agriculture--

Are we a legislative body, or merely a
debating society?

Mr- DOUGLAS. Mr.
that a rhetorical question?

Mr. O’MAHONEY. That is a rhetori-

President, is

7 cal question. .
Mr. DOUGLAS. We have the answers

to the Senator’s rhetorical questions.
Mr. O’MAHONEY. I have heard the

answers before—

nated and approved by the Secretary of Ag-,.

riculture (herein referred to as the Secre-
tary) pursuant to section «1 hereof—~—

Nowhere is there any mention of sec-
tion 2, which is the section immediately
after the declaration of policy, which
states. that there are two methods
which are humane. Concerning one of
them we know that there has been dis-
agreement, because it raises some sort of
religious question.

Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, will
the Senator yield?

Mr. O’MAHONEY. I decline to yield. .

Mr. HUMPHREY. I merely wished to
help the Senator. ‘

Mr. O’MAHONEY. I know the Sen-
ator: I have had his help before.
pursuantito section 4 hereof: Provided—- \

Of course, we all know that when we

. have a proviso clause, we are dealing

with something else-—

Provided, That during the period of any na-
tional emergency declared by the President
or the Congress, the limitations on procure-
ment required by this section may be modi-
fied by the President to the extent deter-
mined by him to be necessary to meet es-
sential procurement needs, during ” such
emergency.

Here we have another delegation. This

is a delegation to the President. He can

upset the whole apple cart. He can
upset the whole scheme of humane
slaughter. He can upset the whole
humane slaughter idea, which is so in-
deﬁnitely, and poorly deﬁned and
vaguely stated that no one can read the
bill and tell what it means.

Mr. HUMPHREY. It is no problem at
all.

Mr. O’MAHONEY. Reading further:

For the purposes of this section a slaugh-
terer or processor shall be deemed to be af-
ﬁliated with another s'laughterer or proc-
essor if it controls, is controlled by, or is
under common control with, such other

There is an invitation to some law-
yer—not in Congress, not on the Com-
mittee staff, not in the Senate, not in
the House—to draw up an afﬁdavit which
is false. How is he to determine whether
or not it is false?

Mr. DOUGLAS. Mr. President, will
the Senator yield?

Mr. O’MAHONEY. Will not the Sena-
t01 from Illinois indulge me? The Sen-

ator has had his day.

Mr. DOUGLAS. I have not spoken at
all. I should like to know whether the
Senator is addressing himself to the
amendment in question, or to a decision
which has already been made by the
Senate, and with respect to which a mo-
tion to reconsider was laid on the table.

Mr. O’MAHONEY. The Senator is
quite away from the point. I will make
it clear as I go along.

So we have the authorization to some
lawyer, somewhere, somehow, to draw
up the afﬁdavit. Then there will be a

lawsuit. whether the afﬁdavit when
signed- before notary is or is not false.
Then there will be another lawsuit.
One would think that all the contra-
dictions in the bill would have been cov—
But no. I read from

ered in two pages.
section 4:

SEC. 4. In furtherance ofthe policy ex-
pressed herein the Secretary is authorized
and directed'—- -

(a) to conduct, assist, and foster re—
search, investigation, and experimentation
to develop and determine methods of
slaughter and the handling of livestock in
connection with slaughter which are prac—
ticable with reference to the speed and
scope of slaughtering operations and humane
with reference to other existing methods
and then current scientiﬁc knowledge;

Here is language . in the bill which
authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture
to make alterations after his research
and study in accordance with scientiﬁc
procedures not now being followed, but
to be followed sometime: in the future
after he has made his studies.

The Secretary of Agriculture can
change the whole procedure. Section 2
is being politely forgotten. Whoever
drafted the bill was dealing in emotion-
alism. Humane slaughter. Of course
that appeals to every person. We all
.want to be humane. I have even heard
’the Senator from Minnesota say this
afternoon that no slaughter is humane.
I believe he is right. This would be a
good antivivisection bill. It Would be a
good vegetarian bill. It is not a prac-
tical bill. Why should the drafter of the
bill have provided in section 4 (a) that
the Secretary is authorized to “foster re-
search, investigation, and experimenta—
tion to develop and determine methods
of slaughter and the handling of live-
stock in connection with slaughter which
are practicable with reference to the
speed and scape of slaughtering opera-
tions”?

Then we go to subsection (b) : p

(b) on or before June 30, 1958, and at
such times thereafter as he deems advisable,
to designate methods of slaughter and 0'
handling in connection with slaught:
which, with respect to each species of liv
stock, conform to the policy stated herein.‘

 




1958

Is that not a broad delegation of legis-
lative authority, to deﬁne something
Which ought to be deﬁned in the bill? It
is a delegation to the Secretary of Agri-
culture to say what humane slaughter is.
If we are to legislate with respect to
humane slaughter, certainly the least we
should do is make clear exactly what we
mean.

Eve1y peison who has eve1 practiced
law, every person who has ever acted
as a prosecuting attorney, every person
Who has ever acted as defense attorney,
every person who has ever practiced
business lawknows how extremely im-
portant it is that every statute and
every contract should be clearly and
speciﬁcally written so as to be 'under-
stood clearly by all who ”are to be af-
fected by it.

Mr. LANGER. He should have a bill
of particulars.

Mr. O’MAHONEY. A bill of par-
ticulars. The Senator is quite right.

I read further:

If he deems it more effective, the Secretary
may make any such designation by designat-

ing methods which are not in conformity
with such policy.

What is the use of declaring the policy
of the United States and then a little
later in the bill saying that the Secre-
tary of Agriculture, if he so desires, may
designate methods of slaughter which
are contrary to the policy set forth in
the act? _

Mr. DOUGLAS. Mr. President, is the
SenatOr from Wyoming asking ques-
tions to which he wishes answers?

Mr. O’MAHONEY. I have learned

1'"

from long experience that the best way ‘

to get a statement into the RECORD, and

to set forth clearly the point which one

, wishes to make, is to pursue the state-
ment and not permit interruptions
‘ which are sometimes—not by the Sena-
tor from Illinois, of course—designed to
throw the speaker off the track. Know-
ing how skillful the Senator from Illinois
is, I have decided that I shall make my
statement ﬁrst

M1. DOUGLAS I may say that the
Senatm is already off the track, and I
cannot help him any more.

Mr. O’MAHONEY. The Senator from
Wyoming points to the silence in the
Chamber as evidence of the fact that
what he is saying is being understood by
his colleagues When I rose to make my
statement the Chamber was a bedlam of
conversation. Now Members of the
Senate who have gathered here are pay-
ing me the compliment of listening to
what I am saying. For that I thank
them very much.

I have mad the bill we are being asked
to make a law.
st1 ated, as I said at the beginning, that
the bill is vague and uncertain and de-
clar es a policy and then repeals the
policy; that it states what humane
methods of slaughter are, and then it
states that the President may upset

them, then it delegates to the Secretary ,

of Agriculture the right to adopt other
methods.

That is no way to legislate. If Con-

gress wishes to put a law on the statute ~-

books the least it should do is to take
the trouble to make up its mind as to
what it wants to put on the statute

It has been demon-'

books. I say the measure before us is
utterly unworthy of support by the Sen-

‘ ate at this time.

I am not speaking upon the amend-
ment offered by the Senatorfrom New
York [Mr. JAVITS] because that is obvi-

ously designed to clarify what the Sens,

ator from New York believes to be the
unclear reference to the religious or
ritualistic slaughter of animals. That
in itself is an indication of the fact that
the House sent to us a bill which is im-
possible of enforcement and which
should not be enacted. I compliment
the chairman of the Committee on Agri—
culture and‘Forestry and the members
of the committee who sup-ported him in
reporting a proposed amendment. I feel
very deﬁnitely that the pending measure,

' before the night is out, ought to be re-

committed to the Committee on Agricul-
ture and Forestry, where it should be
studied by. legislative experts who know
their business, instead of by emotional
persons, who merely say that something
ought to be done in a practicable way to
secure humane slaughter.

I am grateful for the attention which
the Members of the'Senate have given
these few remarks of mine.

Mr. ANDERSON. Mr. President, I am.

interested in the bill from several stand-
points, but I am particularly interested
in the constant reference to the religious
beliefs of individuals.

In the year 1919, I‘ was appearing be-
fore the Legislature of the State of New
Mexico as the director of the New
Mexico Public Health Association, try-
ing to have adopted a public health law.
That law obviously contained provisions
Which were not satisfactory to everyone.
The provision that a child must have a
drop of a certain kind of medicine put
inthe eye at the time of birth was not
satisfactory to the Christian Scientists;

it was not completely satisfactory to the ‘

Archbishop of the Catholic Church.
Therefore, there‘is always the problem
of trying to meet the religious objections
which may arise. One does his very

. beset to meet them, and if he succeeds,

he IS fertunate. .

The reason I have worried about
these amendments is that I think it is
unwise to walk into the middle of a re-
ligious controversy which the persons
concerned have not been able in any way
to solve bythemselves.

I refer to certain testimony on page
192‘of. the hearings: I can understand
why, with this language before him, the
able Chairman of the Committee on
Agriculture and Forestry [Mr. EL-
LENDER] was a little perplexed as to
what he might do. At thispoint in the
hearings Rabbi Sharfman Was testify-
ing. He said he was not acquainted
with any of the nonkosher slaughtering
houses. He continued:

I am acquainted, however, with kosher
slaughtering houses, and ‘I and my col-
leagues as well have seen the restraint that
is utilized 'prior to the actual slaughter
sometimes involves hoisting for a period of
about 1 minute, something which could not
be said to be inhumane.

The colloquy continued as f0110ws:

The CHAIRMAN. And it is your contention
that you would be prohibited from utilizing
that method? '

14097

Mr. SHARFMAN. It is my contention, Sena-
tor, that it is up to the discretion of the
Secretary of Agriculture. Any method could

be prohibited on his say-so, according to
That is within

the provisions of the bill.
his discretion.

The CHAIRMAN. I go back to the question
I asked you awhile ago. Is there a way by
which language could be placed in this bill
to entirely exempt you?

Mr. SHARFMAN. Our basic difﬁculty with
this bill, Senator, goes even deeper than our

“concern as a Jewish

The CHAIRMAN. I am not asking you that.
I know that. I am asking you if there is
any language that we can place in this bill
that will entirely exempt you, irrespectiv
of your feeling as to the other part of th?
bill?

Mr SHARFMAN. We know of no such lan-
guage at the present time.

Later the question arose again. The
witness who was testifying began to talk
about what ran contrary to section 6.
The chairman said to him.

So that you as a lawyer don’t know of any
further language you could add to section 6
to make it certain that you would be entirely
exempted?

Mr. BRENNGLASS. Not at the present time.

'We have given careful consideration

"The chairman then broke in and
asked:

Will you give it study and 'let me know?

I understand that not further language
was proposed to the chairman.

It seems to me that day after day,
hour after hour, back in April, the mem-
bers of the Committee on Agriculture
and F01estry tried hard to have those
people submit some/language. If they
did not like what was in the bill, they
could have proposed other language. It
is my understanding that until this very
afternoon, and this very late hour no
language has been suggested to the com- ‘
mittee. .

Now we are given language and am
asked to accept it, and to takeit to con-
ference. The committee, in- taking lan-
guage to conference, will have to try to
sustain the position taken by the Senate.
That will mean it will be necessary to get
the House to agree to it. Yet the meme, _
bers of the religious groups which were
interested in this subject could not agree
on the language among themselves.
Why, then, should Members of the Sen»-
ate and House try to force the proposal!
onany particular religious group?

The language in the bill, in my opinion,
goes as far as it can go without offending,
one side or the other. Why any Member
of the Senate should want to get into
that kind of conﬂict is beyond me.

The Senator from Minnesota made a
very deﬁnite statement a few minutes

'ago__ that provisions similar to those in

the present language were adopted in
1956. There was no march on Washing-
ton then. The bill passed the Senate;
I have never received, from a single per-
son of the Jewish faith on one side or _,
the other of the argument, any objec-
tion to the passage of that bill. There
was no attempt to recall it or to stop
the House from acting on .it. The House
bill was passed.

Mr. ELLENDER. The bill which was
passed by the Senate was a study bill.

' Mr. ANDERSON. Apparently the bill
which was passed by the House con-
tained this language.

 




*Itwi4098 ,

» ’ ..-,the

. . Mr. ELLENDER. The Senate sent to
' the House a study bill, which was pigeon-
' \ holed, and then, at this session, the House
passed the unworkable bill which we are
now considering.
, Mr. ANDERSON. I thought the Sena-
' tor from Minnesota said a bill was passed
Which included language of this nature
in 1956.
Mr. ELLENDER. No; he was in error.

Mr. ANDERSON. I only say to the

' Senator that I know of no way by which
we can satisfy everyone with that lan-
guage. The House language, although

Senator from Wyoming [Mr.

'OfMAHONEY] has pointed out that it was

not perfect, is at least language. I think

if we start to tinker with the language,

We may end where I assume certain peo—

ple waiit us to end, by defeating the

bill. .

_ _ I have hoped that someday there
"7 might be a solution to the problem. The

‘ agitation has gone on for a long period
of years. _

Frankly, for a long time I was tre-

. mendously impressed with what the
Senate tried to do to present a reason-

‘ able bill. ,But we apparently have got
nowhere with it because of the agitation
which has followed. I think we would be
well advised to do what the Senator from

_ Minnesota has suggested, get the ’per-
‘ from South Dakota, provided. I do not

sons who are interested to try to remedy
the language and introduce a new ele-

ment. I do not know where we will end,’

because the individuals who are involved
do not seem tobe able to agree among
themselves.

On page 174 of the hearings at the end
of the rather long statement which was
presented by Mr. Isaac Lewin, in behalf
of a large group, apparently, he said:

We‘ sincerely hope that you will resist the
heavy .propaganda campaign instituted to
enact this uncalled-for legislation and re-
ject S. 1497 which must, if passed, only dis—
, turb the religious feelings, impair the re-
‘ 1 ligious practice, and deny the religious
rights of millions of bona ﬁde, loyal, and
honorable citizens of the United States.

Was not S. 1497 the study bill?

Mr ELLENDER. The only bill passed
by the Senate, as I r,ecall was a study
bill.

Mr. ANDERSON. Later, on the same
page, a statement was ﬁled by Rabbi
Isaac Stollman, and Rabbi Isaac B. Rose,
on behalf of the Religious Zionists Of
America. Their conclusion was:

Despite this very strong feeling for hu-
maneness in the treatment Of animals, we
.must oppose the proposed humane slaughter
bill now before the United States Senate
Committee on Agriculture and Forestry, and
speciﬁcally S. 1497 as amended, which is the
companion bill of H. R. 8308.

,If these differences of opinion exist, I

think the best thing to do is to avoid

' ', them. I do not see any reason why we
should want to vote for an amendment
which apparently has not been endorsed
by any of the religious groups. There is
apparently no reason to believe that it
would be accepted by anybody, unless it
"36,31“? for the sole purpose of killing the
ill

If there is a simpler method, it is

' A " simply to move to recommit the bill and

to kill it. But under the circumstances,
I think someone should come forward

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —— SENATE

with some validation of the language.
The chairman of the committee, the very
able Senator from Louisiana, asked re-
peatedly in the hearings if there was any
suggestion of language. That condition
existed from April 28 through April 29
and 30 and May 1, 1958, and has con-
tinued until the present time, or to, with-
in a few days of what I hope will be the
end of the 85th Congress. NO one has
come forward in all that time with lan-
guage that, so far as I know, has had the
blessing of any of the rabbis who ap-
peared and testiﬁed concerning the bill.

As to sending the billto conference, I
think that is work which the Committee
on Agriculture and Forestry might be
spai ed, because some of those who seem
to want the language could not agree on
it among themselves.

I hope the amendments will not be
adopted.

Mr JAVITS and Mr. MUNDT ad—
d1 essed the Chair.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
Senator from New York.

Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, it was my
intention to sum up in about 2 minutes,

and then to let the Senate proceed to‘

vote, but obviously the Senator from

__South Dakota wishes to discuss the’

measure, so I shall defer to him.
Mr. President, I yield to the Senator

lose my right to the ﬂoor.

Mr. MUNDT. Mr. President, I do not
expect "to address the'Senate at length.
I call attention to some erroneous im-
pressions which may have been left after
the discussion by the Senator from Min-
nesota [Mr. HUMPHREY] and the Sena-
tor from New Mexico [Mr. ANDERSON].

Somewhere in the remarks Of each of
them they said that the Senate, a year
or so ago, had voted unanimously on
identical language.

Mr. HUMPHREY. Oh, no.

Mr. President, will the Senator from
South Dakota yield to me?
Mr. MUNDT. Iyield- '~

Mr. HUMPHREY. Of course» the
measure contains anoperative section
which is enforcible. The language of the
bill of 2 years ago was arrived at on the
basis of a study proposal.

All Isaid was that the portion of the
bill of 2 years ago which related 'to
approving of *kOsher slaughtering as hu-

mane was the same as the corresponding ,,

provisions of this measure.
Mr. MUNDT., Ah. That is vastly dif-
ferent, because the portions which deal

with religious slaughtering methods and .- ‘

the other portions to which the Senator
from Minnesota has referred are parts
or portions of the previous bill which

were to be referred to a committee, which

had the duty of ﬁnding an answer to the
problem, and which proposed that a
study be made.

Mr. ANDERSON. Mr. President, will

the Senator from South Dakota yield

to me?

Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, will
the Senator from South Dakota yield to
me?

_ Mr. MUNDT. Mr. President, I am
happy to yield to my colleagues, either
individually or collectively.

Mr. HUMPHREY. If the Senator
from South Dakota will yield ﬁrst to

J uly ‘29

me, let me say that I was the author
of the other bill; and‘that study bill,-
of 2 years ago, which called for a 5-year
study period, contained the same provi—
sions in regard to ﬁndings and study that
are contained in the measure now before
the Senate; and then the committee was
asked to give consideration to fuither
methods.

Mr. ANDERSON. Mr. Piesident, will
the Senator from South Dakota yield to
me? ‘

Mr. MUNDT. In just a moment.

The 1956 bill contains the following
provision: .

The committee shall, within 2 years after
the enactment of this act, submit to the
Secretary for immediate transmittal to the
Congress a full and complete report of its
study and operations, together with its rec-
ommendations for legislative and adminis-
trative action.‘ The committee shall report
and make speciﬁc recommendations on the
adoption by the industry of humane
methods of slaughtering, including the fol-
lowing:

And then the language is identical.

Mr. HUNIPHREY. “Including the
following.” ,

Mr. MUNDT. Yes. But the measure
we are asked to vote on today includes
the folloWing provision:

NO method of slaughtering or handling
in, connection with slaughtering shall be
deemed to comply with the public policy of
the United States unless it is human-e.

And then the pending measure con-
tains a provision which is grammati-
cally awkward, as has been stated by
the Senator from Wyoming er.
O’MAHONEY], as follows:

Either of the following two, methods of
slaughtering and handling are hereby found
to be humane.

That is vastly different from the pro-
posal which was before us 2 years ago,
for this provision Of the pending meas~
lure makes a deﬁnite and a ﬁnal ﬁnding.

Mr. ANDERSON. Mr. President, will
the Senator from South Dakota yield?-

Mr. .MUNDT. I yield.

Mr. ANDERSON. I think the fault is
mine, not that of the Senator from
Minnesota. I thought he said that a
ﬁnding Was made in the other bill. But
I believe I was wrong in so stating. So
the Senator from Minnesota should not
be hung for that error on my part.
[Laughtenl

Mr. MUNDT. \Mr. President, I do not

want any Senator to be hung. [Laugh-
t‘er.]
But the Senate now has before it a
proposal which is much different from
the proposal which was before it 2 years
ago.

Mr. HUMPHREY. There is no doubt
of that. _

All I ”said was that the bill of 2 years

/ago referred to accepted. standards of hu-

mane slaughter, because that bill pro-
vided, in part, “adoption by the industry
of humane methods of slaughtering, in-
cluding the following.”

And they were declared to be humane
methods. ,. ~ ~

The question of the exact language to
be used was one for the committee to '
decide. " ,

Mr. MUNDT. Will the Senator from
Minnesota read the language of the

 




    

   
   
  
    
  
  
    
  
  
   
  
   
  
   
    
  

    

 

1.958

bill of 2 years ago in which such words
are to be found?

Mr. HUMPHREY. We did.

Mr. MUNDT. In the pending meas-
me, we ﬁnd, on page 2, in line 10, the
following words: /

Either of the following two methods of
slaughtering and handling are hereby found
to be humane.

Now will the Senator from Minnesota
read the corresponding provision of the
bill of 2 years ago?

Mr. HUMPHREY. Yes. That pro-

- vision read as follows:

The committee shall report and make spe-
ciﬁc recommendations on the adoption by
the industry of humane methods of slaugh-

__ tering, including the following.

Mr. MUNDT. I am still waiting to
hear the word “found.” V

Mr. HUMPHREY. When the bill of 2
years ago used the words “humane
methods of slaughtering, including the
following,” they meant that the methods
would be humane methods.

Mr. MUNDT. Not entirely. When
the wordsare taken out of context,.they
may seem to mean that; but the rest of
the paragraph, which the Senator from
Minnesota did not read, is as follows:

The committee shall, within 2 years after
the enactment'of this act, submit to the
Secretary for immediate transmittal to the
Congress a full and complete report of its

' study and operations, together with its rec—

ommendations for legislative and adminis-
trative action.

Mr. HUMPHREY. That is correct.

M1. MUNDT. And then follows the
sentence the Senator from Minnesota
did read, namely:

The committee shall report and make
speciﬁc recommendations on the adoption by
the industry of humane methods of sla’ugh-
tering, including the following.

Mr. HUMPHREY. Yes. .

Mr. MUNDT. But that provision does
not make a ﬁnding. Nowhere in the bill
of 2 years ago can there‘be found lan-
guage which states speciﬁcally what the
measure now before the Senate states on
page 2, in line 10, namely:

Either of the following two methods of
slaughtering and handling are hereby found
to be humane. ,

Not even the great group of expei ts
now operating on the ﬂoor of the Senate
can point out, in the bill of 2 years ago,
a provision which amounted to a ﬁnd—
ing. [Laughter.]

Mr. HICKENLOOPER. Mr. President,
will the Senator from South Dakota

. yield to me?

. Mr. MUNDT. Iyield.

Mr. HICKENLOOPER. Of course, the
pending measure does not really pro-
vide for humane practices at all.- A
moment ago the Senator from Wyoming
[Mr. O’MAI—IONEY] pointed out, in what
I thought was a devastating argument,
many of the weaknesses of this measure;
and the SenatOr from South Dakota will
find the following language in section 4,
subsection (b), on page 4, beginning in
line 17: .

If he deems it more effective, the Secretary
may make any such designation by designat«
ing methods which are not in conformity
with such policy.

1 g

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

So in one place the pending measure
provides that the policy shall be one for
humane slaughter; but I take it that the
language I have just now read from page
4 means that the Secretary can desig-
nate methods which will be unhumane
or inhumane, if he wishes to do so or if
he thinks such methods would be “more
effective.”

Mr. MUNDT. Mr. President, the Sen-
ator f1 om Iowa is entirely correct. It is
rather astonishing, to me, that the Sena-
tor from Minnesota, who on many occa-
sions has such scant regard for the ﬁnd-
ings, deliberations, and programs of the
Secretary of Agriculture, would now en-
dorse a measure which provides that
whatever the Secretary 'of Agriculture
may ﬁnd to be “more effective” will be
acceptable.

Mr. HICKENLOOPER. No; the
amendment in the nature of a substitute
says that the policy designated on page
2, namely:

It is therefore declared to be the policy
of the United States that the slaughtering
of livestock and the handling of livestock
in connection with slaughter shall be carried
out only by humane methods.

Does not need to be followed by the
Secretary of Agriculture if he ﬁnds an-
other policy which he “deems more ef-

' fective.”

Mr. MUNDT. Yes. In other words,
the policy set forth-on page 2 would be
utterly meaningless .. as a legislative de-
vice. In short, the policy section on
pages 1 and 2 is completely meaningless,

because all of it is wiped out by the eX- .
,emption clause found on page 4, p be-

ginning in line 17, which the Senator
frOm Iowa has read to us just now,
namely:

If he deems it more effective, the Secretary
may make any such designation by designat-
ing methods which are not in conformity
with such policy.

So why try to spell out the policy so
meticulously, so that the Orthodox
groups will be satisﬁed, when on page
44 the Secretary of Agriculture is told
that the animals may be slaughtered in
any way not in conformity with that
policy.

If the Senator has a valid fear—and
I think he has—I do not think he should
engage in the legislative deception of
trying to make persons who are afraid
feel comfortable, when the proposed ‘leg-

islation would do nothing more than .at-‘

temp-t to allay their fears.

Mr. CURTIS. Mr. President, will the
Senator from South Dakota yield to me?

Mr. MUNDT. I yield.

Mr. CURTIS. In reference to the lan-
guage' of the pending-bill, which giVes
the Secretary authority to designate
methods contrary to the methods called
for by the policy laid down on pages 1
and 2, let me askwhether there is any
requirement that such designation be
uniform for all slaughtering plants; or
may the Secretary of Agriculture piclc

,and choose, according to the size of the

plants, their geographical location, or
any other device which he might deter-
mine to use? In other words, does not
the pending measure give the Secretary

of Agriculture complete authority to

14099

make any designation which might hap-
pen to come into his mind?

Mr. MUNDT. That is correct, for it ,
does not provide any limitations in that
connection. It simply points out-—not-
that he may _make designations which
are in conformity with the policy pro-
vided on pages 1 and 2, but that “the
Secretary may_ make any such designa-
tion by designating methods which are
not in conformity with such policy.”

That is a strange legislative device
which would give the Secretary the power
to veto the act at any month or day or
hour he might wish to veto it.

Mr. CURTIS. Might not the Secretary
designate one method for plant A, and
another method for plant B?

Mr. MUNDT. Nothing provided in the
bill would prevent him from doing so.

Mr. CURTIS. Because the bill states
that he may proceed in both directions
at the same time—in other words, that
he may conform to the policy, and also
that he “may make any such designation
by designaing methods which are not in
Conformity with such policy.”

Mr. MUNDT. That is correct. .

' Mr. LANGER. Mr. President, will the
Senator from South Dakota yield to me?

Mr. MUNDT. I yield.

Mr. LANGER. In other words, if the
Secretary approved the killing of a cow
by the use of a sword, that method would
be acceptable under the provisions of the '
bill, is that correct?

Mr. MUNDT. That is correct; the
Secretary would have that power.

M1 P1 es1dent I shall not proceed
further; but I wish‘the RECORD to show
clearly that when the Senate voted—and
voted unanimously—on Senate bill 1636,

      

 

. in 1956 as compared to the measure on

which it is now proposed that the Senate
vote, the Senate was, dealing with an
entirely different piece of proposed leg-
islation in connection with slaughtering
by commercial methods and also slaugh—
tering under ritualistic - practices._

Mr. President, I favor humane slaugh- r
tering legislation. I shallk vote for it.
But I want it to be effective, reasonable, .
and workable. The bill we now have
before us leaves much to be desired.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed at this point in the
RECORD, so that those who read can clear-
ly see the difference between the two
legislative proposals, Senate bill 1636,
of 1956, and the amendment, in the na- '
tture of a substitute, to House bill 8308,
as now before the Senate.

There being no objection, the bill and
the amendment were ordered to be
printed in the RECORD, as follows: _

Be it enacted, etc., That the Congress ﬁnds
that the use of humane methods in the
slaughter of livestock and poultry prevents
needless suffering; results in safer and better
working conditions for persons engaged in .
the slaughtering industry; brings about im-
‘provement of products and economies in
slaughtering. operations; and produces other
beneﬁts for producers, processors, and con-
sumers which tend to increase the orderly
flow of livestock and poultry and their prod-
ucts in interstate and foreign commerce. It
is therefore declared to be the policy of Con-
gress to provide for study and research into
improved methods of slaughter to encourage
acceptance and use of such methods by

shall assist the Committee with such re-
search personnel and facilities as the Depart-
ment can make available.

years after the enactment of this act, submit
to the Secretary for immediate transmittal
to the Congress a full and complete report
of its study and operations, together with its
recOmmendations for legislative and admin-

(1) in the case of livestock, rendering such
insensible before bleeding or
slaughtering, by mechanical,
chemical, or other means determined by the

Secretary to be rapid effective, and humane; ’

a (2) in the case of poultry, instantaneous
severing-of the head from the body or, if
pou1try is otherwise cut or stuck, by ﬁrst

rendering such poultry insensible by me;

chanical, electrical, chemical, or other means
determined by the Secretary to be rapid,
effective, and humane;

(3) in either of the above cases, slaughter-
ing in accordance 'with the practices and
requirements of the Jewish rel‘igioustaith by
'a qualiﬁed slaughterer, commonly called a
authorized to engage in such

Jewish religious faith.

The Committee shall also, from time to

“SEC 6. Nothing in this act shall be con-
strued to prohibit, abridge, or in any way
hinder the religious freedom of any person
or group to slaughter and prepare for the
slaughter of livestock in conformity with
the practices and requirements of his 1e11-
gion. ”

Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I promise
to detain the Senate but '2 minutes,
merely to sum up the situation. It is
alleged that a discussion with respect to
religious freedom is being introduced into
this debate. That has been one of the
allegations made in response to my
amendment. 1 point out this question is
already raised very speciﬁcally by the
bill which is before the Senate, which
came from the other body, andewhich
the Senate voted to accept because it pro-
vides in section 2 (b), “by slaughtering
in accordance with the ritual require-
ments of the Jewish faith or any other
religious faith that prescribes a method
of slaughter.”

In short, the question is before us. I
did not wish it to be here. It is here. 7

Second, it is argued that the language
to deal with the Situation was not before

 




1958 ,

the Committee on Agriculture and
Forestry. I point out the fundamental
tenet of those who were against this
whole method of approach prevented
them from making any suggestion. They
said they were ﬂatly opposed. As a mat-
ter of fact, those who drafted the lan-
guage thought they were drafting lan-
guage which would help those groups,
because they could not get a proposal in
terms of language from them.

Now we are in the last stages of the

legislative process, where those who have'

expressed the deep convictions of their
faith are now face to face with the need
to do something about it in speciﬁc terms.
What I am trying to do by my amend-
ment is to preserve their opportunity to
do so.

Finally, -I point out the obviously good
faith involved. If Senators wish to con-
sider the Jewish ritualistic slaughter as
humane, then the question must be dealt
with in all its manifestations in the way
the slaughtering is practiced. The rec-
0rd shows that, as practiced, there is in-
volved the process not only of slaughter-
ing and preparation, but of handling.

In order to preserve the positions of
those groups, so they could have the best
protection Congress could provide—and
I think that feeling is inherent in the
heart of everyone here—I felt I should
keep the door open by introducing this
alternative. Since we are dealing with
sensitive ground, let us afford every op-
portunity to ameliorate the force of the
blow.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence
of a quorum.

The PRESIDING OFFICER.
cleik will call the r 011.

- The legislative clerk proceeded to call
the roll. '

Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.

The PRESIDING OFFICER Without
objection, it is so ordered.

The question is . on agreeing to the
amendment of the Senator from New
York [Mr. JAVITsl.

Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I ask for
a division on my amendment.

On a division, the amendment was
agreed to.

Mr. CASE of New Je1sey. M1. Presi-

The

dent, I call up my amendment, which is

at the desk, and ask to have it stated.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
amendment of the SenatOr f1 om New
Jersey will be stated.

The CHIEF CLERK. It is proposed, on
page 6, beginning with line 14, to strike
"out. all down through line 18 and insert
1 in lieu thereof the following:

SEC. 6. Nothing in this act shall be con-

)fued to prohibit, abridge, or in any way

nder the religious freedom of any person
./ 0r group Notwithstanding any other pro-

vision of this act, in order to protect free-

dom of religion, retail slaughter and the
handling or other preparation of livestock
for retail slaughter, are exempted from the
- terms of this act. For the purposes of this
section the term “retail slaughter” means
slaughter in accordance with section 2 (b).

Mr. CASE of NewJersey. Mr. Presi-
dent, I do not think it is necessary to
speak at any length on this amendment.
As was stated earlier in the discussion

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —— SENATE

of the amendment of the Senator from
New York/it is intended to accomplish
precisely the same purpose and to have
the same effect. I think it is desirable to
have this amendment in section 6, be-
cause section 6‘ as it now stands is some-
what inconsistent within itself. I think
the amendment clarifies the inconsis-
tency. I hope it will be acceptable.

Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, will
the Senator yield? 7,

Mr. CASE of New Jersey._ I yield.

Mr. HUMPHREY. I wish only to say
to the Senator from New Jersey, so he
may be aware of the attitude of the re-
ligious groups, that this is exactly the
same language which the representa-
tives of Jewish faiths opposed. They do
not want the exemption. The record of
1956 as well as 1958 is clear. That is one
matter on which all groups, whether
orthodox or otherwise, are agreed. As
pointed out by the Senator from New
Mexico [Mr. ANDERSON], this is the very
language they did not want. '

I personally shall have to vOte against
the amendment, because all the testi-
mony was contrary to this type of exemp-
tion; I think it would be a great dis-
service to the people of Jewish faith and
to all those who supported or proposed
the bill, because there was a unanimity
of belief that there should not be such
a provision.

Mr. CASE of New Jersey. I appreciate
the viewpoint expressed by the Senator
from Minnesota. I think the situation
really is that the groups in question pre-
fer to have no bill at all; but, as the Sen-
ator from New York has pointed out,
since we are faced with the bill, as the
result of the vote taken earlier on the
motion of the Senator from Louisiana,
the problem with which we are con-
fronted is making the bill as acceptable
as possible and have it accomplish its
objectives, but not do Violence to the
views of particular religious groups.

Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, will the
Senator yield? *

Mr. CASE of New Jersey. 'I yield to
the Senator from New York.

.Mr. JAVITS. I should like to state
to the Senator from Minnesota‘that I
appreciatethe concern expressed by him.
He has certainly shown his friendship
to this effort by his vote on my amend-

ment. At the same time, I feel the other,

body saw ﬁt to try to button this mat-
ter up in two sections. I think the
amendment of the Senator frOm New

' Jersey, is an additional contribution the

Senate can make to the quieting of con-
cern in the same section. 'Again I point
out, just as I felt the language I pro-
posed was not the height of art in terms
of legal draftsmanship, the same may be
said of the proposal of the distinguished
Senator from New Jersey, except it per-
mits the matter to be susceptible of res-
olution in the ﬁnal form to be adopted
in conference. Therefore, for those rea-
sons, rather than for reasons of concern
which the Senator from Minnesota ex-
presses, I shall support the amendment.
I feel the more we can take to confer-
ence, the better we can deal 'with the
question. I felt that way about my
amendment. I say that respectfully. I
hope very much the Senator from Min-

- Bricker

14101
nesota may feel the same way, in View
of the explanation of my position.

Mr. CASE of New Jersey. I thank the
Senator. I yield to the Senator from
West Virginia [Mr. REVERCOMB].

Mr. REVERCOMB. For clariﬁcation,
I should like to ask a question. Does not
in fact the amendment of the Senator
from New York [Mr. JAVITS], which has
been agreed to and is now written into
the bill, really solve the problem which
the Senator from New Jersey proposes
to solve by his amendment? '

Mr. CASE of New Jersey. I may say
to the Senator from West Virginia: If
section 6 were not in the bill, then I
think his suggestion might be very well
made, indeed, but section 6 is in the bill.
Section 6 is in the bill in a form which
raises the possibility of a distinction be-
tween ritual slaughter, which relates only
to the actual act of killing, and to prepa—
ration, which is necessary. I think the
amendment would constitute a clariﬁca-
tion. It could be taken to conference,
where, perhaps, some further clariﬁca-
tion, as suggested by the Senator from
New York, could be made.

Mr. President, I yield the ﬂoor.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. A quo-

‘ _ rum‘is present. .
The question is on agreeing to the

'1' ,, amendment offered by the Senator from

New Jersey [Mr. CASE]. -

Mr. CASE of New Jersey. Mr. Presi-
dent, I ask for the yeas and nays on

my amendment.

The yeas and nays were orde1ed.

Mr. CASE of New Jersey I yield to
[M1,
JAVITS] for the purpose of making a
brief statement.

Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, 1 in
browsing through the record of hear-
ings—and I do not pretend to be an ex-
‘pert on it—I came across something
which may help the-Senate in connec—
tion with this discussion. I" have al-
ready explained my position. I feel,
that the amendment gives us yet an—
other to-ol with which to work in the
effort, to put this particular aspect of
the bill in proper form. That is Why I
am for the amendment.

One page 196 of the record I ﬁnd the
following statement by the chairman of
the committee: ,

The CHAIRMAN. I realize “that there may
not be -a close comparison between the act
which.we passed here last year to provide
for the compulsory inspection by the United
States Department of Agriculture of poultry
and poultry products. As I remember there
was some opposition by quite a few rabbis,
and yet we were’ able to place in this bill a
provision which exempted these opponents.
I refer speciﬁcally to section 15 (a) (4),
wherein it is stated: ‘

“Persons slaughtering, processing, or oth-‘
erwise handling poultry or poultry products

which have been or are to be processed as
required by recognized religious dietary laws
to the extent that the Secretary determines
are necessary to avoid conﬂict with such re-
quirements while still effectuating the pur-
poses of this act.”

I call attention to that only because
apparently there is a legislative prece—
dent fo-r dealing with the subject by way
of exemption. As I understand, that is
the principal ground of opposition to
the language which the Senator from
New Jersey uses in his amendment. I
have no doubt that the language will be
changed in conference. What I tried to
do, and what the Senator from New Jere
sey is trying to do, is to give the con-a
ferees the tools with which to work;

Mr. CASE of New Jersey. Mr. Presi-

dent, reiterating the point made just.

now by the Senator from New York, ﬁrst
of all, let me say that I support the bill.
I voted against the motion of the Sen-
ator from Louisiana because I do sup-
port the bill. However, I do not believe

fuzzy condition. I believe in trying to
clarify the language and make it per-
fectly clear. In line with the suggestion
of the Senator from Wyoming [Mr.
O’MAHONEY] made a little earlier, the
language of my amendment may not be
perfect for that purpose, but it raises
the q lestion in such form that the con-
feiees can deal with the entire subject.
Mr. HUMPI—IREY. Mr. President, - I
gather that it is a dubious honor to say
that one Senator has spent more time
on the bill than other Members of this
body. However, it has been my fortune
or misfortune to have that dubious
honor. _
Every representative of every single
religious group or body who appeared
before our committee protested against
exemption. The Jewish groups, in tes-

timony before the committee, outlined

the principle that kosher killing could
be classiﬁed as a humane slaughtering
practice within the terms of whatgwe
mean by “humane slaughtering.” It
has been so declared, in an affirmative
ﬁnding. The amendment of the Senator

from New York [Mr. JAVI'I‘S] was agreed .

to, so that in that afﬁrmative ﬁnding
there will be included not only the mat-

.ter of slaughtering, but the matter of

preparation ' and handling. That
amendment had a purpose which ﬁlled a
vacuum which was left by the House
bill," as the Senator from New York said.

However, in this instance, I say most
respectfully to a Senator who supports
the legislation, who has proved his sin-
cerity of purpose, and who has been a
friend of the program of humane
slaughtering practices, that, whether

knowingly or unknowingly, he has of-

fered an amendment which might be in-
terpreted by sOme of our people who are
deeply concerned by this legislation as
an affront. They do not seek an exemp-
tion. They have every right to say that"
kosher killing is within the terms of
what we understand by humane slaugh-
tering. We have so found by declara-
tion. But the exemption would be a dis-
service to the Jewish community and its
religious practices. I plead with my col—
leagues to consider this question very
carefully. I have talked with represent-
atives of every single group interested in
this particular item of legislation. So
far as the exemption is ccnce1ned, I
warn my colleagues that if they are in-
ter ested in trying to comply with the

‘1 request of honorable people who seek

not to be injured, who seek no special
privilege, and who seek to be let alOne,

they should leave the language of sec-

tion 6 as written, or they will get them-
selves into deep water.
Mr. LAUS-CHE. Mr. President, will

the Senator yield?

Mr. HUMPHREY. 'I yield.
Mr. LAUSCHE. We would be tread-

ing upon dangerous ground if in any way

we were to imp-1y that compliance by the
Jewish people with their 1itual was tan—
tamount to cruelty to animals, or to any-
one else.

Mr. HUMPHREY The Senator 1s ab-
solutely correct.

Mr. LAUSCHE. We must begin with
the premise that what they have done is
in conformity. with goodness, and with

. Capehart

July 29
gentle treatment of living things, and
that their religion has been founded on
that basis. ,

I, for one, will not subscribe to the in—
clusion in the bill of any provisions which
would declare that their practices have
been inhumane, having ,in' mind the

istcric background of their ritual, which
contemplates men of good character, of
cleanliness, of decency, and men with a
sense of protection toward the things
which they‘destroy for food.

Mr. HUMPHREY. The Senator from
Ohio has stated the situation much more
eloquently than I could.

The. PRESIDING OFFICER. The
question is on agreeing to the amend-
ment offered by the Senator from New
Jersey [Mr. CASE]. On this question the
yeas and nays have been ordered, and
the clerk will call the roll.

The Chief Clerk called the roll.

Mr. MANSFIELD. I announce that
the Senator from Tennessee [Mr. GORE],
the Senator from Fiorida [Mr. HOLLAND],

So the amendment of Mr. CASE of New

Mr. O’MAHONEY. Mr. President, 'for
the reasons '

Mr. CASE of, New Jersey. Mr. Presi-
dent, I .move that the Senate recon-
sider the vote——

Mr. O’MAHONEY. Mr. President——

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
Senator from Wyoming has the ﬂoor.

Mr. O’MAHONEY. Mr. President, for
the reasons I have previously stated this
afternoon, I move that the bill be recom—
mitted to the Committee on Agriculture
and Forestry. It is impossible to legis-
late a slogan. The bill before us is
vague and uncertain and contradictory.
It does not deﬁne what humane slaugh-
ter is. The bill should be recommitted
so that it may be drafted’ intelligently
and "clearly. I make that motion.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
question is on, agreeing to the motion
of the Senator from Wyoming.

Mr. O’MAHONEY. ‘Mr. President, I
ask for the yeas and nays. '

The yeas and nays were ordered.

SEVERAL SENATORS. Vote!
Vote! -

Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, re-
gardless of how one may feel about the
bill, to vote to recommit is, of course, to-
kill the bill. We can have the bill in
conference with the amendments which
have been adopted, and we should per-
mit it to go to conference. The bill has
been studied? for 3 years. Regardless

Senator from Wyoming, I do not recall
any testimony from some of the Sena-
tors who have complained, about the-bill.
I can say most'candidly that the bill has
had the -very careful study of the De-
partment of Agriculture, humane so-
cieties, the American Meat Institute, and
other organizations. It represents con-
siderable thought and considerable ac-
tion. The House passed the bill over-

whelmingly. It had cOnducted hearings

‘n the ﬁeld. We ought to let the bill go

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The

hat the conferees will be conﬁned to

Therefore, the answer is
that the conferees will not be in a posi-
tion to make such a deﬁnition.

Mr. MUNDT. Mr. President, I do not
want to leave unanswered in the RECORD
the statement that a vote to recommit is
a vote to kill the bill. As one member

of the committee who attended the

hearings, I can say that if the "bill is
recommitted to the Committee on Agri—
culture and Forestry, the committee cer-
tainly will be bound to try to reconcile
the various conflicting points of View
which we have heard expressed in the
Senate tonight, and to arrive at a solu-
tion which will movein the direction of
humane slaughter.

I do not think a vote to recommit is a
vote to kill the bill. It would be a vote
to kill this particular language.

Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, the
reconciliation of the different points of
View will be done in conference.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
question is on agreeing to the motion to
lay on the table the motion to reconsider.

The motion to lay on the table was
agreed to.

 

FEDERAL AID TO {THE STATES FOR
SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION

Mr. MCNAMARA. Mr. President, I
ask unanimous consent to have printed
in the RECORD a statement by me on a
program of Federal aid to the States for
school construction. _

There being no objection, the state-
ment was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows: '

STATEMENT BY SENATOR MCNAMARA

An epidemic of adjournment fever seems
to be settling over the Congress.

The main symptom of this fever is a
deceptive mood of self-congratulation

\ wherein the Members tell each other—and

their constituents—What a great job they
have done during the past months.

I would not like to puncture this mood——
for, in a large sense, it is justiﬁed by the
record of the 85th Congress.

However—that record will by no means be
complete until the Congress takes care of an
extremely important piece of unﬁnished
business.

I refer speciﬁcally to a program of Fed-
eral aid to the States for school construc-
tion

The Senate Labor and Public Welfare
Committee currently is working on a prO~
gram to grant 23,000 college scholarships a
year.

Certainly, no one truly interested‘in Amer-
ican education can find fault with such a
measure

But the trouble! is that it only nibbles. at
the edge of the main problem.

The problem, simply stated, is a continu-
ing Shortage of more than 140,000 class-

rooms—in the face of a constantly increas-

ing population.

The problem involves a Shortage of m01e
than 30, 000 teachers-and proper salaries for
the ones we have.

What answer does a scholarship provide to
the boy or girl who receives a substandard

education because the school day is cut in -

half by double shifts?

What good is a scholarship program to a
schooldistrict that simply does- not have the
funds available to build needed schools?

A And how will scholarships help school dis-
tricts pay their teachers a living wage?

These are the problems.
under any illusion that if we accept a schol-
arship program we are making any real
strides toward improved American educa-
tion.

Scholarships are a nice gesture, a nod in
the right direction, but they are rapidly
obscured by the magnitude of the. real edu«
cation problem. What we must have is a
program that will help the States build the
schools they so desperately need.

A truly meaningful program of Federal
assistance to the States for education has
been sought for years in the Congress.
There has been too much talk and tOO little
action.

.I am seeking, within the Labor and Public
Welfare Committee, to amend a true educa—
tion assistance program to any SO—called
scholarship bill.

Failing within the committee, the ﬁght
will be carried to the ﬂoor of the Senate.

We Speak often of the need to stand up
and be counted on important issues.

I hope that my colleagues will soon have

that opportunity to vote on a genuine edu-
cation assistance program.
