THE COUNTRYSIDE

This royal throne of kings, this sceptred isle,
This other Eden, demi-paradise,

This happy breed of men, this little world,
This land of such dear souls, this dear dear land,
This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England . . .

—SHAKESPEARE, King Richard I I

Cats of a good ratting strain are the most effective means for

keeping down rodents, but in the western counties the trappers
take a heavy toll of them.

THE COUNTRYSIDE OF BRITAIN

is dishonoured by the use of the gin trap, which crushes the limb by
means of powerful steel jaws. Trapped animals suffer thirst, pain and
exhaustion as in cruciﬁxion.

The gin trap is chieﬂy used in the rabbit—trapping industry, which
is parasitic on agriculture in Cornwall, Devon, Somerset, West Wales,
and elsewhere. Trappers no more aim to keep down rabbits than butchers
aim to keep down sheep, and the introduction of rabbit-trapping into
Carmarthenshire during the ﬁrst world war led to a persistent plague
of rabbits. The stock on which the rabbit—trapper thrives is being fed
free of charge at the expense of genuine agriculture.

To abolish wild—rabbit—farming it will be necessary to allocate
labour and funds to a scheme of rabbit—clearance, and it is essential to
deal thoroughly with areas large enough to prevent reinfestation, to use
methods which do not leave a breeding stock behind, and to employ
men who do not stand to gain by leaving such a stock. Humane methods
are detailed in UFAW’s pamphlet Instructions for Dealing with
Rabbits.

For rats, traps are very little used by experts, breakback traps are
preferable to gin traps, and efﬁcient cage traps, such as the Wonder and
the Brailsford, are still more humane when regularly inspected. UF AW
has published a leaﬂet entitled The Humane Destruction of Rats
and Mice.

Game—keepers use the gin trap for catching stoats, weasels, poaching
cats and sometimes foxes, and also trap rabbits for proﬁt. Traps spec—
ially constructed for setting on poles for owls and other birds are on the
market, though their use is illegal. Wholesale destruction of predators
upsets the balance of nature and encourages the increase of rodents.

UFAW’s parliamentary programme for dealing with the evil has
comprised the introduction of the Gin Traps (Prohibition) Bill, which
in 1935 was by two votes refused committal to a Select Committee of the
Lords; the Mersey Committee on Damage by Rabbits, 1937; the Pre—
vention of Damage by Rabbits Act, 1939, which gave powers to check
rabbit—farming and prohibited the setting of spring traps for rabbits
elsewhere than in rabbit holes; and the Mutilated Rabbits Bill, to be
introduced when private members’ Bills are again permitted.

At present the most urgent requirement is to attack the dastardly
rabbit—trapping industry by pressing for a strenuous campaign of rabbit—
clearance in the counties where wild rabbits are farmed.
