Caged

Near blaring sideshow and Ferris wheel

In an old barn with grey eaves

They have gathered the wild from our hills.
Squirrels lie on their backs in the heat.
There are foxes, raccoons, an owl

With fierce golden eyes. His talons
Tread the sawdust cage floor. He spreads
And fans his wings, pale-feathered.
Rabbits crouch passive.

The bobcat is limp on his side.

His stub-tail twitches. His amber stare
Follows passers-by,

Follows me out into muttering night.

I see them all still. The fairground
Is empty. Storm rumbles over.

Now the bobcat's eyes are all

Black pupil. He stretches

And grips his claw-hands again and again.
Hunter and hunted,

Killer and prey together,

From the truce of cages

There rises a great breathing dream

As if a forest sways up through the close air.
There all night long the rain

Blows wide in gusts and thunder

Pours its avalanche down dark lost mountains.

palpitations come to life
teasing
miniature mocking egos

like ﬂirtations they are,
though said to be alive

and singular

as nerve-twitches

gone placid at last—

calming the mind

because there is no pattern

in their sudden bodies

and the deaths of their bodies

Are they sweetened, like us,

by touches scant

as tongue-tips?

they tease the eye outward

to what is not human but knowable
and then not knowable

and not a pattern

not a thought

not singular

THE CONSOLATION OF ANIMALS

It’s their not knowing how they must die;
The emptiness of their beautiful eyes.
The heat and damp and pulse of their breaths,

the way joy seizes them like a miniature death—-
and no shame in it.

 

 




 

 

TWO HORSES

The horses Jack and Racket have gone down
into the Elysian ﬁelds.

It is a world without fences.

The creeks never run dry

But splash and bubble over stones rubbed
Bright as silver.
Jack and Racket
Bend their long necks down
And, drinking, become young again.

Their bones vanish back inside the good shapes
Of Shire and Appaloosa.

Of course, life isn’t like this.

Life is two graves big as cellar holes
At the foot of the north meadow,
Covered with stones.

Which is why, this morning,

I wind around my ﬁngers a few
Long hairs caught in the gate latch
And inhale their salty fragrance,

And why I imagine in a far pasture two dappled
Giants lipping lazily
Apples as they fall from the everbearing trees.

 

 




:: THE KI'I‘TEN

IVIore amazed than anything

I took the perfectly black
stillborn kitten

With the one large eye

in the center of its small forehead
from the house cat’s bed

and buried it in a ﬁeld

behind the house.

I suppose I could have given it
to a museum,

I could have called the local

newspaper.

But instead I took it out into the ﬁeld
and opened the earth
and put it back i

saying, it was real,
saying, life is inﬁnitely inventive,
saying, What other amazements

lie in the dark seed of the earth, yes,
I think I did right to go out alone

and give it back peacefully, and cover the place
with the reckless blossoms of weeds.

Evening Dance oftlze Grey Flies

Grey flies, fragile, slender—winged and slender—legged
scribble a pencilled script across the sunlit lawn.

As grass and leaves grow black
the grey flies gleam——
their cursive flight a gold calligraphy.

It is the light that gilds their frail

bodies, makes them fat and bright as bees——
reflected or refracted light——

as once my ﬁst

burnished by some beam 1 could not see

glowed like gold mail and conjured Charlemagne

as once your face

a silverpoint against the pillow’s white-—

PITTSBURGH POETRY EXCHANGE

A VERY SPECIAL POETRY/ECOLOGY
EVENT:

A READING AND PRESENTATION
JEAN PEARSON
Poet
Environmentalist

Animal Advocate

SATURDAY NOVEMBER 1,

P C M O

D U Q U E S N E U N I V E R S I T Y

L A U R A F A L K A U D I T O R I U M

$4.00 DONATION AT THE DOOR

A RECEPTION WILL FOLLOW THE READING

 




Jean Pearson, Eco-poet and Animal Advocate, has
published her work in many journals and
anthologies, including The American Poetry Review,
Between the Species, Milkweed Chronicle, §§£EQL§_
Daughters, Pantheist Vision and the Christian
Scientist Monitor. She has performed her poetry
at ecological conferences and animal rights
meetings, at colleges, churches, coffeehouses and
arts centers. Editor of the special 1985 issue of
the Mickle Street Review on "Whitman and the
Earth," she is currently editing an anthology of
prose and poetry on the wolf. She is also
collecting material for an anthology of poems
about animals and the human—animal connection. A
free-lance writer, Pearson is listed in the
national Directory of American Poets and Fiction
Writers and in the 1986-87 Who's Who in United
States Writers, Editors and Poets. In 1983, she
co-authored a history of women in literature,
published in Sweden. Pearson's translations of
nature poetry by Swedish and German authors have
been published in such journals as Stone Countr ,
Poet Lore, the Colorado State Review, and Swedish
Books.

Pearson's reading in Pittsburgh will include
translations of poems by Lappland poet Paulus
Utsi, poems that reveal the attitude of primal
Lapp culture toward animals and nature. In her
readings Pearson shows the natural connection
between deep ecology and the animal rights
movement. Her poems express an attitude of trans-
species equality and are rooted in a holistic
philosophy that celebrates the interdependence of
earth, the animals and human consciousness. Her
work for animals and the earth reflects her

philosophy that every life is unique and all life
sacred.

Pearson will be glad to dialogue after her reading
on issues of animal rights and deep ecology.

The Laura Falk Auditorium is located on the

Duquesne University campus in Mellon Hall at the
corner of Colbert and Bluff Streets.

 




A Poet Among Wolves -

Jean Pearson is an animal rights and environmental advocate with a PhD. in German literature. Part
lobbyist and part mystic, she is all poet, drawing on the verse of Walt Whitman, D. ll. Lawrence and
Emily Dickenson as literary mentors. She is one of the few writers who can raise serious issues and still
produce art. Michael Wurster of Pittsburgh Poetry Exchange says Pearson’s poems are “impassioned,
yet lucid”; aesthetically satisfying, though “meant to change and persuade the reader.”

Wurster first read Pearson’s work When reviewing it for possible presentation at an animal rights
exposition planned by Mobilization for Animals. He was immediately “astounded at how good she
was.” The exposition fell through, but Wurster and Mobilization’s Dan Kinney knew Pearson had to
read in Pittsburgh regardless. They sent word to Wolf Park, Indiana, where she has been living for a
month studying wolves and other animals in the wild, and she agreed to come.

The reading promises to be an unusual and rich event. Pearson plans to pair readings with
recordings, interspersing her own work, plus her translations of works by the late Lapp poet Paulus
Utsi, with slides and taped wolf-sounds. “I spoke my ﬁrst poem when l was little and my mother wrote
' it down,” Pearson said. Her interest in wolves goes back as far, to simultaneously scary and protective
images she had of them during a long childhood illness. They have 'sinoe become a sort of spirit animal,
encouraging and inspiring her. The choice of Utsi shows processes also characteristic of Pearson.
Desiring to explore the Swedish roots of her father 5 family, she “somehow” got herself to Sweden. She

“”somehow learned the language m just a year and by chance found a volume of Utsi 5 work m a
bookstore there, with Swedish translations of the Lapp. Finding him a fine poet, she began translating
his works along with those of other Swedish artists.

Pearson 5 work has been published m various journals and anthologies, such as Tire/linerir‘an
' Poetry Review, Earth’s Daughters and Milkweed Chronicle. She edited a special 1985 issue of the
Whitman society’s Mickie Street Review on “Whitman and the Earth,” and is now at work on an
anthology of wolf-inspired writings. Native American traditions often fuel the muses of this poet
whose “bio-region” is her birthplace in the Lehigh Valley. This, too, is a link with wolves, as the
moody animals were sacred totems for Minsi Indians native to the valley.

Kinney believes Pearson will “educate people who already have an interest in animals” and bring
new conservators into the fold, by showing “the interdependence of animals and humans.”

Land Mine

In this heat no health moves.

Only insect mouths have work to do.
Even the clover sweats.

A groundhog swells and rots in the sun
a broken stretch from home.

The smell of death mows down

the pastoral hill. A mate peers out
from her sleeve of earth with moist,
watchful eyes. Deeper in

the tunnel must be cool.

_Small voices stir a sorrow up

out of the ancient ground.
Murmuring chirr, chirr, a mother
turns from this hot harm

to nurse invisible fur

into the future all life warms.

Jean Pearson

 




To a Wee Vegetarian

Forth from your hedgerow,

your grass-woven burrow,

scurrying under the harvest moon,

you comb a circle through late grain,
fine-toothed gourmet of natural food.
You found out the sweetmeat

of berry and earth-nut

and now you climb to night’s golden rim.
Little feet grip the stalk of a meal

and mouse-tail tendrilcurls round a stem
in a rush of delight at the summer grain,
braided by sun and rain...

and Farmer Burns not come too soon.

—Jean Pearson

"CHIMP CHOMPS ON VET, IS SHOT DEAD"

AP wire service——"The chimps were being taken to a laboratory

in Maryland when the attack occurred around 2:15 a.m....the
police dispatcher didn't know why they were going to the lab

and couldn't explain the reason for the attack."

In the middle of the night they came.

The glare of lights and men's voices

drummed through misty January air

like surgical steel striking the cage's

bars. The familiar one smelled

as he always did—~of smoke and food.

But an odor like death clung to the coat

of the other one. When they broke

our sleep and entered our den, I knew

it was for our lives. I said to my mate:
Better to die here then to place our fate

in hands that touch us but cannot feel.

As soon as I was clear of the cage,

I turned on it and bit that hideous smell.

I tore its fingers off and the opposable thumb,
the thing that gives them all their power. I bit
its ear, deaf, anyway, to our cages of grief.

I bit its face, as full of fear as my own.

It screamed till our feeder put it into a cage.
Without its thumb, it becomes like us!

But I, with only vegan teeth, no rope,

no cage, no gun, I made sure I did not go

to the lab. Though now I die,

I saw a little justice done.

Jean Pearson

 




The Comet at Equinox

Last night, because there were stars,

I woke at four, entered the sub'freezing
weather with my dog, and drove

to the mountain with cold hands.

They stood already there, the man,

the woman, the boy, gazing at the sky

for the chance of a lifetime.

A tall stranger who spoke like

an engineer scanned the dark beside them.
He told us where to start, the three electric
lights on the horizon, at what angle

to proceed upward to the trapezoid

of stars that pointed the eye down again
to where the comet blurred. My dog
meanwhile, engrossed in earthly smells,
nuzzled each hand that hung down, waiting
its turn at binoculars. The comet

had a tail that first night of spring,

visible to the naked eye. And so our small
human group stood an hour on the mountain
between two tails: the friendly one
wagging close to us on earth, and

that faint one, more like a memory,
holding our eyes on the sky.

JEAN PEARSON

BENEDICTIQN FOR THE ANIMALS

 

W/e ate no flesh in Eden, but afterwards,
when things got hard, we forgot

the peaceful kinship of that ancient kingdom.
As our teeth sank into their ﬂesh

we had to deny them. So we said

they had no souls, no reason, no thumbs,

no speech. We were so different. We made

a chain of things to protect us—fire, medicine,
our locking houses, many kinds of clothes.
And we renamed them—~farm product, fur crop,
renewable, resource. Pray that we will see

their faces again in the mirror of creation,

the miracle of animals, their clear eyes
meaning more than profit to our own!

DISPLACED

Antlers ram my house,

batter the east siding,

then lock with the downspem.
Edging backward,

the animal

pries the metal pipe

10W rd the sidewall;

All twenty feet gives way

and he clanks dawn Sﬂvan Stree ,
the monscmus antenna
{brewing sparks

at children and dogs

who run howling to their htzsmes,

We live miles from a forest

0: zee.

The dogs in this neighbm‘lmed
wear sweaters.

Nothing is Wild in this place
leng subdued by the leash

and the blade.

I gesture at the windew
beckoning to the deer

new thrashing at windshields
and bicycles.

But What would I do

if he came to me,

this animal tangled in my heuse?
How could I calm a creature,

lost as I am

in some suburb far from home?

Winter Hummingbird

Winter dawn, the earth still

under a shroud frost.

The mulberry leaves have yellowed and fallen;

bare branches click—clack in the wind like bones.

The birdbath water —-

sea to countless wrigglers and swimmers

rippling surface quickened by the slightest breeze —-
locked now in block of ice hard as rock.

Elena is dying, the breath crushed out of her
by a tumor in her cheSt; "

the crab's great claw clamps tighter, tighter
round her heart. ‘

There she is, high up in the pines

a flash of brilliant green, now here, now there,
wings beating quicker than sight,

heart quicker than sound

hovering, swerving, cutting through space

sure as a bullet

she rockets, finally straight up into the sky
(Look at me, anyone brave enough to want me or fight me!)
dives straight back down, fearless,

to alight with a peep and a flutter

on her favorite branch.

She perches a few seconds,

wings aquiver, beak cooked up, defiant and alert,
a weightless, self—consuming blur

of desire and passion and motion

a tiny ingot pulsing with sun-fire.

Hummingbird, be near us in winter!

Hover over us, 0 tiny warm one,

thaw the terrible ice that grips our hearts!

0 lighter than air, fastest of heart and wing,
Quicken our clotted blood, .

rid us of this dreadful weight!

Remind us, 0 nectar-sipper, ‘

that life, short life, is sweet.

Scrub Jays

In this cold, grey day

they burn like blue flame.

Heads cocked to one side

they miss no chance

pounce and stab and eat any live thing
seed, bug, frog, egg, chick

all gulped down Without apology.

People who feed birds hate jays -

too jumpy and bullying

cute finches and chickadees shoved aside
seeds fly as stout beaks thrash to and fro
grabbinggférttheaheatzinrthe‘sunflower's germ
dead of winter no time for manners.

They don‘t sing, but yell,

good and loud, to each other;

a laugh it sounds like to me

a strong, intelligent, unafraid
Ha Ha! Ha Ha Ha!

We're alive! We‘re alive!
Heya! Heya!

JIM PELLEGRIN

 




THE CAT’S DEATH

That night you called repeatedly,

A forlorn cry, as ifI could never reach you.
You were alone already.

The pupils of your eyes grown wide and black
Stared past the border of the dark land.

At daybreak you died in my arms.

I carried you to the rainy mountain,

To a mossy tree whose roots cleft rock.

The mist that silvered my hair and your rich fur
Had been in store for us, Terra.

The leafy earth of the winter mountain

Had patiently waited our coming.

Then there were dreams.

Something of you came back to me from the mountain,
A bobcat, heavy with wild kittens -—

No one else could touch you but you came to my hand.
In bewilderment I stroked the same brindled fur.

In the grey dawn I knew you.
