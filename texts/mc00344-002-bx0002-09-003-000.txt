Dear Mr. Smith:

Thank you very much for your recent communication in which
you express your concern for the protection of marine mammals
and your disappointment because of the weakening of the proposed
legislation by the Senate Commerce Committee.

Of course, I, too am disappointed with the weakening of
this legislation, but am, nevertheless, hopeful that there
will be stronger bills introduced to save these creatures.
Enclosed for your interest and information is a copy of a
release from the Law Enforcement Humane Society. V

Again, I thank you for your views and support.

Sincerely yours,

AN OPEN PETITION TO FIRST CLASS MAIL
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS: June 21, 1972

The Senate Commerce Committeem further weakening the House bill, which was
originally designed to protect our ocean mammals, including manls best friend
of the sea - dolphins and porpoises - will soon be before the Senate for a vote.
The original legislation - the Harris-Pryor bill- was emasculated beyond
recognition, and will NOT accomplish the objectives that it was intended to

do: protect ocean mammals.

For example, there is no firm moratorium on,the killing of sea mammals, it is
the subject of waivers by the Administrator of the Commerce Department's
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NCAA), and the industrys
that have a financial interest in the killing of these ocean mammals, and
those who seem willing to kill our wildlife / ocean mammals for the pure
"fun" of doing so.

This applies to both the killing or capturing by Americans
and to importation from foreign lands. There is no firm cut-off date on the
incidental killing of porpoises and dolphins by the tuna industry (Senator
Humphrey's amendment to require the industry to change over to methods which
would not kill these gentle, intelligent animals was not adOpted by the
Committee, and this must be restored to the bill.)

 

The Committee's bill

only provides for changes which NCAA considers "feasible" after two years of study.
The word "feasible" as a lOOphole (weak spot) in the bill, and will allow
administrators to succumb to the financial interests who profit from further
murder of ocean mammals.

Ocean Mammal Protection Legislation must be administered by the U. S. Department
of the Interior ~ not the commerce Department which caters to the profit makers
from the killings. The Department of the Interior has traditionally been the
custodian of our national wildlife, and the preservation thereof ...‘while

the Department of Commerce is the department of government set up to serve
busine$$ and indu$try. THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR IS THE LOGICAL DEPARTMENT
TO ADMINISTER THE OCEAN MAMMAL PROTECTION LAW, not the Commerde Department.
Wejshould, primarily, be concerned about animals — as animals ~ and not as a
source of commercial gain.

This legislation is a complicated one ... on a/c the commercial interest$
hiving lobbyed hard for their pocket book intero$t$, and one staff draft after
another had included additional concessions to Terriers, the tuna industry,
and groups and interests allied with "killing for fun."

Therefore, amendments to the Marine Mammal Protection Act, S. 2871 would be
in order. we respectfully request PROTECTION to the ocean mammals and ask
the Congress to consider these amendments, as follows:

(1) Senator Hart's amendment to place jurisdiction in the U. S. Department of
the Interior ~ as in the original S. 2871, introduced by Senator Villiams,
November 17, 1971, did. This is the most important single amendment.

(2) Approve Senator Williams' amendment to restore the $2,500 reward for infor-
mation leading to the conviction of a violator of the Marine Mammal Protection Act.
This "finder's fee" is a reward for information leading to the arrest and con—
viction of violators of the act. This provision was apppoved by the House of
Representatives, but removed by the.Senate commerce Committee. It is vitally
necessary in the vast oceans and ice packs where violators can so easily elude

(c o n t i n u o d) ....

 




OCEAN MAMMAL PROTECTION June 21, 1972

 

.—-_--------------—--~-.C~----------‘--~-

detection, that a reward be offered to encourage reporting of cruelty to ocean
mammals or illegal capture or killing of them. '

(3) Approve of amendments to be offered by Senator Harris to restore a firm
moratorium and provide a firm cut-off date by which time dolphins and porpoises
may no longer be killed incidental to the capture of tuna fish; an amendment to
permit the states to enforce more stringent state laWS'tO protect ocean mammals.
These badly needed amendments are expected to be included in Senator Harris'
substitute bill and, also, to be offered as individual amendments by him; we urge

their approval.

The Ocean Mammals can not continue waiting for protection; they need it now,
and we urge every Senator and House Member ~ committed to humanitarian principles -
to approve of these amendments.

It was, to its credit, the United States Senate that led the way for international
action by unanimously passing the first resolution callinf for a ten—year moratorium
(international in scope) on the killing of whales. This creditable action should

be followed up by protection to other ocean mammals. we appreciate the action

taken by our Government, particularly the Senate, in protecting the whales.

Incidentally, on at least three occasions weekly, one of our members goes to the
Highland Park Zoo, where there is a lone dolphin, and swims with him ... plays
games with each other and totally enjoys each other's company - just like a
companion dog enjoys his master's company. She relates the friendliness of the
dolphin with man (in this case a woman). She says it is just "like being with
another person." '

~u~—~---~---—~~~--~~m——-——-‘*~~—-—“-~‘"~

On June 5th, Congressman Dingell moved to suspend the rules and pass H. R. 1&731
to provide effective enforcement of the Act against shooting at birds, animals
and fish from aircnaft. It was passed by a vote of 310 to S, and was sent to
the Senate. If passed, it will enable the Department of‘the Interior to
prosecute violators.

Congressman Dingell held hearings during April on the bills to prohibit the
poisoning of predators on the public lands and on the Administration's Endangered
Species Bill. No action has yet been taken on this legislation.

"we urge the members of the Fchommittee on Fisheries and Wildlife Conservation

whose members are concerned with this legislation, to keep the entire administration
of the Endangered Species Act in the Department of the Interior. This jurisdiction
should not be shared with the Department of Commerce as proposed in the
.Administration bill. While we are at it, may we ask the members of the
subcommittee to protect predators from the agony of the leghold, steel~jaw,

trap and save our wildlife from the agonies and torture of these devices

Wildlife needs our protection from the agonies of leghold traps and painful

poisons. ‘

Dear Ms. Hoback:

Thank you very much for your letter of recent date in which
you urge my support of S. 208M and H. R. 878M.

As you probably know, these two bills, which would prohibit
the shipping of fur and leather if it comes from animals trapped
in any state or country which has not banned the use of leg—hold
or steel jaw traps, are currently pending before the Senate
Commerce and the House Interstate and Foreign Commerce committees.
No hearings have yet been scheduled.

I share your concern for the humane treatment of all species
of wildlife. I assure you that I will give careful consideration
to this matter, and I will keep your views in mind, should either
of these bills come to the Senate floor for a vote in the near

fUture.

With best regards.

Sincerely yours,

Dear Mrs. Weston:

TThanK you for your letter in suppoit ofS

I am concerned with the preservation of all species of
wildlife, particularly these animals who are so brutally and
'linnecessarily slaughtered each year. I believe that this
violence and brutality towards animals should not be tolerated
by a civilized society. The restriction on imports of products
from ocean mammals will, I believe, remove much of the economic
incentive for their slaughter.

I urge you to speak to your friends and neighbors about
S. 1315, asking them to write not only to me but, to other
members of Congress in regard to the bill.

I apgreciate hearing from you on this important matter.

Sincerely yours,

FRED R. HARRIS

Dear Ms. McCoilister:

I certainly appreciated receiving your recent correspondence
concerning the Laboratory Animal Welfare Act and the approp~
riations requested by the Department of Agriculture to
finance this measure.

On July l3 the Senate passed with amendments the fiscal
1968 appropriations for the Department of Agricultre.

This bill included $l,200,000 to provide funds for the
Laboratory Animal Welfare Act. At this time a House-
Senate Conference Committee is working to resolve the
differences between the House and Senate versions of this
bill. I am hopeful that their decision will be beneficial
to the Laboratory Animal Welfare Act. ,1

You may be sure that when this legislation comes before
the Senate for reconsideration, I will certainly keep
your views in mind. ‘—‘

COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC WORKS

June 21, 1966

Bay Road

British Columbia

Thank you for your recent communication
concerning the humane treatment of animals, a
subject in which I am greatly interested.

The Senate Commerce Committee approved and
reported to the Senate H.R. 13881, a compromise bill
which has passed the House, and which appears to

protect the animals without imposing detrimental
controls on scientific research.

I appreciate your taking the time to express
your views on this serious problem, and I will
continue to work for legislation to cure it,

keeping your views in mind when H.R. 13881 comes

up for a vote.

Sincerely yours,

RED R. HARRIS

Dear Mrs. turrett:

Thank you for your letter in support of
S.‘lO7l and H. R. 5647 which provide for programs
to advance the humane care and health of laboratory
animals. These bills are still pending before
committees and no action has been taken on them as
yet. Before committing myself finally, I would
like an opportunity to study their provisions in
detail and read committee reports. However, I will
do this before the measures reach the Senate and
will certainly keep your views in mind.

Sincerely yours,

FRED R. HARRIS
