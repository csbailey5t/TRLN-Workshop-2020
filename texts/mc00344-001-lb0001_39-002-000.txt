BIOGRAPHY OF SPESSARD LINDSEY HOLLAND
SENIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM FLORIDA

Spessard Lindsey Holland, Florida's senior United States Senator, Who was

Governor of Florida.throughout World War II, was born in Bartow, Florida, July 10,

1892. His parents were Benjamin Franklin Holland, a Georgian and a Confederate
veteran, and Fannie Virginia (Spessard) Holland, of Virginia. They came to Florida
in 1881 and 1888, respectively.

Holland was nominated to the United States Senate on May 7, 19h6, defeating
three opponents in the first primary by more than 72,000 votes. He is the second
Governor in the history of the state to be elected and to serve in the United States
Senate, and the first native Floridian to serve as both Governor and Hnited States
Senator. He succeeded the late Senator Charles 0. Andrews, Who was not a candidate
for re-election because of ill health, and was appointed on September 25, 19h6, by
Governor Millard Caldwell to complete the unexpired term of Senator Andrews Who died
on September 18, 19H6. Holland commenced.his first elected six-year term in the
United States Senate on January 3, 1947.

Following successful campaigns for second and third Senate terms in 1952 and
1958, Senator Holland was elected to a fourth term.in 196M. In this race he carried
all of Florida's 67 counties in the primary. In the subsequent general election he
carried all but one county and led the entire ticket, and the 997,585 votes he re-
ceived were the greatest number ever polled by a single candidate in the history of
Florida politics.

Senator Holland, who in private life has variously been a school teacher, citrus
grower and practicing attorney, is a product of the Bartow public schools. He was
graduated from Summerlin Institute (now Bartow High School) in 1909. In 1912 he
graduated, magna cum laude, from Emory College (now Emory University), Atlanta, Ga.
He is a 1916 graduate of the University of Florida law school. While at the Univer-
sity of Florida he served as the first elected president of the student body.

Scholastically, Senator Holland earned membership in Phi Beta Kappa. He also
qualified for a Rhodes Scholarship, but was prevented from accepting it by the out-
break of World War I.

A.versatile athlete in his youth, Holland lettered in football, baseball,
basketball and track While in college. In 1916 he was offered, but rejected, a

contract by Connie Mack to join the pitching staff of the Philadelphia Athletics.

Senator Holland enlisted in the Army when this nation entered World War I and
was later commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the Coast Artillery, serving briefly
at Key West before going overseas. In France he successfully sought a transfer to
the Army'Air Corps. As an aerial observer with the 2hth.Aero Squadron he saw action
on four fronts -- the Meuse—Argonne, Champaign, St. Mihiel and Luneville theaters.
During this period he officially downed an enemy plane and had his own plane shot
down by an enemy aircraft. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross in 1918
for ”extraordinary heroism.in connection with military operations against an armed
enemy" and held the rank of Captain at the end of the war.

In 1919 Senator Holland was married to Miss Mary Groover, a native of Fort
White, Florida, and the daughter of a practicing physician in Lakeland. They haNe
two sons, two daughters, and thirteen grandchildren. Both sons saw combat action
in the Pacific during World War II ~~ one as a Marine Corps officer and the other as
a Navy air gunner -- and both now practice law in Florida.

Discharged from the Air Corps in July, 1919, Holland resumed law practice briefly
in Bartow before his appointment as Prosecuting Attorney for Polk County. In 1920
he was elected County Judge and served in this position for eight years before re—
turning to the practice of law Where he formed a partnership with W. F. Bevis. The

firm is still in existence under the name of Holland, Bevis, Smith, Kibler and Hall.

STATE SENATOR

 

In 1932 Holland was elected to the State Senate and served in that office for

eight years. In that capacity he sponsored various measures for the reduction of

taxes; opposed a sales tax; sponsored legislation repealing the gross receipts tax;

supported a Constitutional.Amendment prohibiting ad valorem tax for state purposes;
assisted in drafting the Florida School Code; sponsored acts to improve the state's
school system, increaSe teachers' salaries, and to provide teachers' retirement
benefits; authored various citrus laws including the Citrus Advertising Act, Citrus
Commission Act and others; supported the Wbrkmen's Compensation Act, old age assist-
ance bills, and Unemployment Insurance Act; sponsored Fair Trade Act, Soil Conserva—
tion Districts Act, and the Cooperative Marketing Act. He was among the leaders in

the successful 1937 effort to abolish the poll tax.

W
Holland was elected Governor in 19HO and his administration as Florida‘s 28th
Q

Governor from January 19H1 to January l9h5 was marked by accomplishments in many

 




- 3 _
fields, although it was burdened with problems presented by the war emergency. Four
Constitutional.Amendments sponsored by Holland and adopted during his term.were:
(l) the Gasoline TaX.Amendment, by which the county roadbond structure was strength—
ened, millions of dollars were saved in greatly reduced interest rates, county credit

was renewed in many instances, and more of the gas revenue was made available for the

roads; (2) the Intangible Tax.Amendment, Which lowered the intangible tax ceiling

from five to two mills, attracting capital to the state and strengthening the appeal
of the Constitutional provision prohibiting the levying of an income tax; (3) a pro-
vision allowing, in an emergency, for a shortened period for amending the Constitution;
and (A) an amendment creating a non-political Fresh water Fish and Game Commission.

Grants to the needy aged and the blind were greatly increased through enlarging
the state's ”take” on pariamutuel bets at the horse tracks. The average assistance
to the aged was raised from $12.01 to $28.00 a month.

He recommended the repeal of the gross receipts tax and it was repealed.

The bonded debt of the Everglades Drainage District was stabilized in his ad-
ministration when Holland succeeded in negotiations for refunding, resulting in a
saving of more than $12,000,000 and added future savings through reduction in the
interest rate.

The State's property tax structure was strengthened through legislation, recom-
mended by Holland, to make uniform assessments at actual value and to strengthen tax
collections. These laws greatly improved the financial condition of counties and
school districts and made possible an increase in teachers' salaries, averaging #0
per cent.

As a member of the Southern Governors' Committee on Freight Rates, he was one
of the leaders in the successful fight for reducing Southern freight rates. He also
was a.member of the Executive Committee of the National Governors‘ Conference.

Holland left the state's school system.in:much sounder financial condition than
it was When he assumed office. The teachers' retirement system was put into effect
in January 19h1, immediately after his inauguration. Appropriations for free text
books for pupils were doubled. He left substantial balances in the General Revenue

Fund and the State Road Fund.

UNITED STATES SENATOR
There are only two or three members of the United States Senate Who have missed

fewer votes than Senator Holland. Since coming to the Senate he has missed less than

 




- h _
five per cent of all the votes taken. His absences during voting have occurred
almost without exception during periods when he was excused from the Senate to be
out of the city on official business. And in such cases he has either been paired
on the votes or has made his position on the issues involved a.matter of public
record.
Senator Holland is‘a member of three Standing Committees of the Senate. These

2..

are Agriculture and Forestry Where he ranks thigu in seniority among the ll majority

 

members; Appronriations where he ranks eéggth among 18 majority members; and.Aero-

 

 

nautical and Space Sciences where he stands ninth among 10 majority members.

(Holland purposely chose membership on the committees which he thought would
permit the greatest opportunities for service to his state, and in the cases of the
AgriCulture and Appropriations Committees he waited in order to gain the seniority
required for membership on these bodies.

When Senate rules were changed two years ago to permit service on three Senate
Standing Committees, Holland asked for and was given membership on the relatively
new and important Space Committee, the activities of Which are of increasing bene-
fit to Florida.

With reference to Senate subcommittee assignments, Senator Holland is chairman
of the Committee on Agriculture and Forestry's Subcommittee for Agricultural Credit
and Rural Electrification; he is also a.member of the full Committee's Subcommittee
for Agricultural Production, Marketing and Stabilization of Prices. On the Appro-
priations Committee, Which also has the responsibility for handling foreign aid, he
is chairman of that body's Subcommittee for the Department of Agriculture and Re-
lated Agencies; and is a.member of the Appropriation's subcommittee for (1) De—
ficiencies and Supplementals; (2) Independent Offices; (3) Labor, and Health,
Education, and Welfare, and Related Agencies; (M) Public WOrks; (5) State, Justice,
and Commerce, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies.

In addition to his Standing Committee and Subcommittee p0sts, Holland holds
membership on the Senate Democratic Steering Committee and on the Joint Committee
on Reduction of Wonessential Federal Expenditures.

Throughout his Senate career Senator Holland has consistently urged and
strongly supported a legislative policy of economy and fiscal responsibility in
federal government operations. He has opposed the preemption of states' rights
by the federal government, and has supported legislation protective to the free

enterprise system. He believes that the individual communities and states must

 




- 5 _
maintain their rightful autonomy and independence by refusing federal aid except in
those areas in Which the federal government has a valid responsibility.

Although his legislative accomplishments have been many, Senator.Holland is
probably best known for the following:

THE TIDELANDS ACT which restored to the individual states their property rights

in the submerged coastal belts lying within states” boundaries bordering the Atlantic

.41,

and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexioe. Although active in the issue even before
coming to the Senate, Holland became the Senate's leader in the Tidelands struggle

in 1951 When requested by the National Organization of Attorneys General and the late
Senator Pat McCarran to assume this responsibility. He first introduced appropriate
legislation in 19h8 and again in 1951 and 1953. It ultimately passed both Houses

and was signed by PreSident Eisenhower in May, 1953 to become Public Law 31 of the
83rd Congress under the title "Submerged Lands Act of 1953." The constitutionality
of the law was later challenged by the Supreme Court. At the request of Florida's
Attorney General, Senator Holland joined him.in arguing Florida's.case in the Supreme
Court in October, 1959. The Court ruled in favor of the state, thus returning to it
bottom lands of'untold value for a distance of three marine leagues off of the state's
Gulf Coast.

POLL TAX AMENDMENT for the purpose of eliminating the payment of the poll tax
as a.requirement of voting in federal elections was first introduced by Senator
Holland in 19H9 and in every session of Congress thereafter. Both Houses finally
passed it by overwhelming majorities in 1962 and referred it to the 50 states for
ratification. On January 23, 196M South Dakota was the last of the required 38
states to approve it, and thus on that date the Holland amendment became the 2Mth
Amendment to the Federal Constitution.

CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN FLORIDA FLOOD CONTROL became an active interest of Senator
Holland's in 19H6. The first phase of the project was authorized in the Flood Con-
trol Act of 19M8, when $16.3 million was authorized for the first phase work and
continuing studies. The total cost of the program at that time was estimated at
$70 million, of which the federal government would contribute $58 million. In 1950
the appropriation of another $20 million was authorized, and in the Rivers and
Harbors Act of 195H Congress authorized the remaining project, adding $7 million to
earlier appropriations. The 1958 Act modified the formula for local contributions

and authorized an additional $hO million. The over—all project cost is presently

 




_ 6 _

estimated at $2M2.6 million for the federal government and $89,010,000 in non—
federal costs. The h.2 to 1 benefit — cost ratio is remarkably high, and the
project will protect 15,63h square miles of residential — agricultural - industrial
area in 18 counties against floods, droughts and fire. Senator Holland has been
consistently successful in obtaining budgeted appropriations for the project.

EVERGLADES NATIONAL PARK boundaries were finalized through legislation co-
sponsored by Senator Holland who actively worked toward the acquisition of this na-
tional park since his days as Governor and State Senator.

INTERSTATE HIGHWAYS have received legislative assistance from.Senator Holland

who supported the Highway Act of 1956 which launched the Ml,OOO—mile national network

of Interstate and Defense Highways and increased to 90 per cent the federal contri-
bution to interstate roads. The mileage allocated to Florida'under the national
system totals 1,173 miles of interstate roads exclusive of a limited access inter—
state freeway along the Florida west coast to Miami. In 1963 Senator Holland intro-
duced a bill to extend Interstate Highway 75 from Tampa to Miami.

RIVERS AND HARBORS PROJECTS have received substantial assistance from Senator
Holland through his membership on the Appropriations Committee. .Among the vital
state projects to which appropriations have been made as a result of Holland's
specific efforts are the following: Miami Harbor, Canaveral Harbor, Port Everglades
Harbor, Apalachicola River Channel Improvement, East and West Coast Intracoastal
Waterways, Bakers Haulover Inlet, Palm Beach Harbor, Pensacola Harbor, Tampa Harbor
and Jacksonville Harbor. In the course of authorizing and appropriating funds for
these improvements Senator Holland has been highly successful in getting projects
included in the federal budget, restoring in the Senate projects which have been
lost in the House, and holding appropriations in Senate-House conferences following
the passage of bills in differing amounts.

CROSS-FLORIDA BARGE CANAL is among the most recent public works projects for
the state to whidh Senator Holland has contributed affectively. Almost single-
handedly he secured the first pre-construction planning funds in the amount of
$205,000 for this vital waterway after some senior members of the House Appropria-
tions Committee scuttled the efforts of Florida House members to get such appropria-
tions approved. In 1963, and with the full cooperation of the Florida House delega-
tion, he was instrumental in obtaining in a supplemental appropriations bill $1

million for the start of construction on the Barge Canal.

 




_ 7 -

ALASKA AND HAWAII STATEHOOD was strongly supported through to completion by
Senator Holland. In the case of Alaska, he co—sponsored enabling legislation through
four consecutive Congresses, and he was the first Southern Senator to espouse state-
hood for Hawaii.

MIGRATORY LABOR bills have variously been introduced, co-sponsored or supported
by Senator Holland Who can validly share credit for the enactment of much of the
legislation benefiting these workers in recent years.

FLORIDA'S AGRICULTURE AND CATTLE INDUSTRIES have benefited greatly from Senator
Holland's tenure in the Senate. Because of his extensive knowledge in these fields,
and his appreciation of their importance to a healthy state and national economy,
Senator Holland has been responsible for the appropriation of much of the federal
'money Which has been invested in them since 19A9. He has been particularly helpful
in Obtaining assistance for agricultural research and development, the eradication
of pests damaging to vegetables, citrus and livestock, and for improved.methods of

weather forecasting.

and private education at all levels, Senator Holland has had conferred upon him.the
following honorary degrees: LL.D. -- Rollins College, Florida Southern College,
Emory University, Florida State University, University of Miami; D.C.L. -- Univer-

SENATOR HOLLAND

Thank you very much Mrs. Stevens. I think the next time I run for

office in Florida I will have to import you as one of the official intro~

ducers. One comment before I start and that is the statement (absent few

times). That is one of the causes of complaints from the people at home.

(Here he made a comment about peoole wishing he had been absent on semen

thing they didn't want passed.) I always think it is best to be there.

I am happy to be here this evening and to occupy this particularly

responsible post in connection with the delivery of the Albert Schweitzer

Medals presented this year because there are two of them. Incidentally,

these medals of the.Animal Welfare Institute have been awarded beginning

with an original medal to Dr. Schweitzer himself in 1954, which was orem

sented in Oslo, where he had gone to receive another important award, I

think it is useful and it may be of interest, particularly to those who

get the awards, to hear the comments made by Dr. Schweitzer on that once-

sion. He had gone there from Lambarene, and I don't have to tell any of

you about his tremendous efforts to serve mankind a . . ”I am profoundly

moved that you should wish to give my name to the Medal. I give you this

right with all my heart . . . recognized during my lifetime . . . It is the

 




great and moving surprise of my life that I should still be the witness
of the program . . . little interest in them." So spoke the great Dr.
albert Schweitzer in receiving the first medal in 195“. I wish I had the

time and opportunity to comment on each of the ﬁxate (recipients) but I

cannot do that. I just want to say that last year and this year, in par-

ticular, the award has been keyed to the passage and the beginning of

enforcement of the Laboratory.Animal‘Welfare.Act, mentioned by Mrs. Stevens,

which was approved by the president last August . . . immediately put into
operation, in the course of a Supplemental Appropriation.Act, and now getting
in fU11"fledg9d . . . to receive as Medallists this award, which is of great
pride to them and to men in the Department of.agriculture, who are chgﬂﬁrd
with primary responsibilities.

I might say that I am particularly happy, too, that this year, in addi-
tion to keying these awards to this Act and its implementation, each of the
Medallists is cited for their great services to animals in connection with

their duties of many years in the Department of.Agriculture and particularly

 




>

going to mention later. Those of us who are interested so deeply in humane
objectives toward animals for their own sake do realize how frequently these
objectives are coupled with economic reasons for their enforcement . . .
also performed such outstanding services in the two campaigns which I shall
mention--eradication of a disease of animals, and the other, eradication of
a pest scourge of the greatest (source). I am glad that we are coupling
our interest in humaneness for its own sake with tremendous economic values
that come from humaneness in the treatment of animals which serve mankind.
It never does any harm to quote an able person who has spoken before

in this: (field) . . . Mr. Justice Fortas, and I quote from him with par-

ticular interest. (As a) young lawyer, I sfared off against him at one time

and we have been more than acquaintances since that time. My wife says I
always find some occasion to mention I am a lawyer because I want people to
know that I once had a legitimate profession,

. . . This is what Abe Fortes had to say about the meaning of Schweitzer

and why he was chosen for his name to be given to this award, a choice which

brought him so much pleasure: "This is Schweitzer's message , . . to a higher

 




and better level."

I hope that my quotations of Dr. Schweitzer and Mr. Justice Fortas
may be a source of pleasure to the Medallists and to their wives and
their children. Their wives are here with them and they realize that
they are receiving an award which is very meaningful, as shown by the
quotations I have just given . . . Not only is it an award because of
their implementation and.their aggressive enforcement of the Laboratory
Animal Welfare Act but also for their work in the two fields which I am
going to mention--foot and mouth disease and, the other, the eradication
of screw worm in the Southeastern.portion of the United States. I happen
to knew a little about both of these services . . . Subcommittee . . .
eradication in Mexico.

I Visited Mexico. I may have seen our Medallist who played so impor-

tant a part in 1952. I shall never forget some of the things that we saw

there indicating the tremendous value to those people, and, incidentally, to

our people who raise livestock, in the eradication of foot and mouth disease.

I remember one day we went out to a community where we were warned not to go

 




without military protection. We went there and they reported to us a

(squadron) of the caWVer. 'When we looked over the caWQAry, we decided

we would be safer by ourselves.

. . . There was one . . . old Mexican with a weather-beaten horse a . o
it was almost impossible to describe» He had on a battered campaign hat
with three which he told us would protect him. One was a

ham K's head attached to the front of the hat. The other two wereﬁnake—

skin and the tail of a squirrel mo eyqa . . very sure that he was safe
from those bad ravages so long as he wore those three . , ,
Devastated because of the fact that they had to lose the ox. The
ox would have a room to the side where the ox stayed at night and the
warmth of his body helped to warm the cabin where they lived . . . did
everything for them beside warming their house for them . . , was something
that could not be replaced 9 . . There was no great source of trained ox .

of the family. They would weep about the loss of their ox and ask us how

and when we could get them another ox. Of course, we could not, . .

 




. . . loss of over one million animals which had to be slain and gave

a vaccination to over sixty million animals . . . economy of our entire West

and our entire nation . . . not only domestic animals but wild animals, and

particularly the deer. I think that the eradication from a great and rough

and rugged country like that of a pest as evil as that is performance of
which every person who had a part in it can be justly proud. I think that
one of our medallists tonight can be justly proud of it.

. . . eradication of the screw worm. ‘we in Florida suffered most from
that because of the climate. That pest could live all winter with us where
he couldn't in any other part of the United States. He began a multi-
million dollar scourge to the industry of Florida and which spread to
nearby areas. The pain, the suffering vested upon animals that the screw
worm could do and which died because of it are simply indescribable. There
is one picture on the wall in the adjoining room of how destructive the worms

were which the screw worm inducted into the skin of the animal that was the

host.

Presidential Assistant and Mrs. Roger Stevens were hosts to
those dedicated to humane treatment of animals. Senators
Warren Magnuson and Mike Monroney received the coveted
Albert Schweitzer Award for their leadership in the enactment of
long-delayed legislation to assure humane handling of research
animals. ,___

Christine Stevens, who has given years of tireless effort in
the cause of humanity to animals, welcomed her guests and
called the recent legislation “the greatest progress for these
unprotected animals ever made in our country.”

Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortas, last year’s award
winner, presented the medals and reminded guests of the
Schweitzer philosophy stating: “For a well-rounded civilization
reverence for all forms of life is necessary.” In his tribute to the
Senators he" also paid compliments to their proud wives .
Jermaine Magnuson and Mary Ellen Monroney who, he noted,
“constantly aided, reminded, and prodded the lawmakers.”

Senator Magnuson, referring to civilization in his remarks,
reported that on an extensive. trip abroad, he and Mrs. j
Magnuson had been amazed to find that in several Iron Curtain ;

Senator Monroney stated the bill “goes only half as far as it V
should, but it’s a good start.” He praised Mrs. Stevens, Senator
Maurine Neuberger, Representative Catherine May and the
“many, many other women who helped so faithfully.” As guests l

The very day that P. L. 89-5ﬂ4 went into effect for animal dealers,

I was on a routine visit at a research institution. The Animal'Welfare
Institute has taken part in planning new, improved animal quarters provid-
ing more space for the dogs and monkeys housed there; and while looking
at the dogs in their cages, I saw a Collie wearing a collar with a 1966
license tag on it. .hfter tracing the dog's owners through the license
number, I notified Dr. Scott of the United States Department of.&griculture
.Animal Health Edvision in Michigan. Action by the Department was swift
and effective. ‘Within a matter of days the case was thoroughly investigated
and affidavits were obtained from all persons involved.

Although Thunder, the Collie, had been used for one surgical experiment
and was scheduled for a second, he recovered and is back with his family. I
shall never forget the day I drove Thunder from the.Ann Arbor hospital to
his home in Pontiac. As we neared the house and he recognized the familiar
surroundings, he wagged his tail and started to bark. When he SaW’hiS
owners, Mr. and Mrs. Shorters and their seven children, waiting for him at

the door, he tried to squeeze through the narrow window opening to get to them.

 




Before the passage of P. L. 89-5u4, it was not uncomnon for animals
to be taken directly to a research facility on the same day they were
procured by the dealer. Such swift exchange made it virtually impossible

for an owner to trace or retrieve a missing pet.

Under P. L. 89—5ﬂh, the dealer is required to hold animals for five

days before selling them. Because of this provision, ”Rip," a beautiful
iabradorggetriever, is bank with his owner. He had wandered from his home

on Monday, September 25th, and was taken to the Muskegon Pound by the local
dog warden. Although a Sign in the Pound specifies that animals must be

held there for 72 hours, Rip, who is valued at $150.00, was sold for $1.50

to an out—ofustate animal dealer within #8 hours after he arrivedat the
pound. In searching for his dog, hr. Murphy had been told by Pound personnel
that his dog was not there. On the following Friday, a conscience-stricken
employee telephoned and advised Mr. Murphy that his dog had been sold to an
animal dealer. Because of the 5-day holding period, as required by P. L. 89-
544, Rip was located at the animal dealer's kennel in Decatur, Indiana. He

is now back with the Murphys in Muskegon, Michigan-~20 pounds lighter, but

 




very happy to be home.

In MiChigan we have a state law which is almost identical to P. L. 89-

544. The situatiOn involving Rip is under investigation by both the Federal

and State Departments of.Agriculture. The Departments are integrated-~share

the same office building~-and work together cooperatively to see that both
laws are enforced.

'We have two large animal dealers in Michigah, each of whom handles
600 to 800 dogs per month. Both of these dealers built new kennels to
conform with the standards set forth by the Separtment.

Scientific institutions are also making improvements to conform with
standards set by the Department. In hearings before Congress a spokesman
for a big University medical School testified that the school had used
80,000 dogs in the past twenty years. In opposing mandatory humane
standards, he proudly proclaimed that their dogs are well housed. In my
visits to the University I saw few small dogsm-most of them were Collies,
German Shepherds, Labradors, and large farm dogs. University personnel

measured 1,000 of their dog cages to determine whether they would conform

 




to the space requirements under the law; .ﬁfter consulting the standards
with reference to the length and height of the dogs, they discovered that
the largest cage in the University is adequate in size to house a 23-pound
dog. These figures, reported at a scientific meeting, give a graphic demon-
stration of the direct effects on animals in laboratories of the Laboratory
xeninal'Welfare Act and of the standards promulgated under it.

In closing, I would express the hope that other states will follow
Michigan's example in enacting complementary state laws and that men of
the calibre of Dr. John Quinn, State Veterinarian for the Michigan Departn
ment of.Agriculture, will be in charge of their enforcement. As President
of the Michigan Veterinary Medical Association and the United States

Livestock Sanitary.Association, Dr. Quinn has taken the lead in emphasizing

animal welfare. I would like to read the resolution passed by the latter

organization this year:

Anyone, especially someone from the medical field,

accepting any award associated with the name Albert

Schweitzer must do so with the greatest humility. Naturally

his reputation stands as the epitomﬁ regarding the "Reverence

for Life” and if we ever needed a re-evaluation of one of

our human characteristics it is this one. This award signi-

fies to me the need to be consistentfthat we can not have

different standards of reverence for different species of

animals. They must be equal or the lower standard for one

species will have its detrimental effect on the other specie:

Empathy for all species is essential if we are interested

truly in making this a better world.

I had an experience in Mexico along these lines that

made quite an impression on me. I was in charge of a 10-

 

Remarks by F. J. Mulhern, Deputy Administrator, Regulatory
and Control, Agricultural Research Service, USDA, at the

presentation of the Albert Schweitzer Award, November 27, 1967.

 




horse and 5-mule team that was crossing the mountains in

southern Oaxaca. We were endeavoring to find out how far‘

south into Mexico the epidemic of foot-and—mouth disease had

spread. Each day that we moved further into the mountains

the price per horse andmule got higher. I must admit that
3;;

.me we moved into the mountains they got higher, the terrain

more treacherous and naturally, the strain on these animals

that were carrying the load, much greater.

I recall that during those days most of my party was

very impatient with the horses that were carrying us and the
mules that were hauling our gear. [The natives continually

prodded the animals to keep them moving and the riders used

their stirrups, spurs and whips to urge them on.

The horse and mule owners got more concerned daily and

expressed it whenever the opportunity arose.f I felt their

main motive was to be in a better position come nightfall to;

 




3

negotiate the daily rate. Now, on the other hand, I was

supposed to be guarding Uncle Sam's tax dollar and the people
back in Mexico City wouldn't think too highly of bills for
horse hire that appeared exﬁOrbitant. So I did my best to
bargain with the owners and anyone who has been to Mexico
appreciates that anyone who doesn't bargain for any financial
arrangement is looked down upon.

I must admit, though, that I wasn't doing too good because
each day the daily rate per animal rose 5 pesos until it reached
25 pesos per day, at which point I made a firm stand and told
them.that I would not increase this rate per day for the rest
of the trip. There was no objection on the part of the animal
owners, so I returned to my tent and comrades with a feeling

of pride in having accomplished a satisfactory arrangement with

the natives on which we both could agreeé 3,3,,

3!
f

 




f 4

\.

l; .

\ 7 My feeling of attaining the ability to bargain with the

'X -

natives waséshortlived, however, because upon arising we
found that the horses and mules and their owners were gone.
They had left us during the night, stranded and without another
horse or mule in sight.

Several points took on a new perspective. First of all
we realized that we didn't need all the equipment that we
started out with-~equipment that was at one time considered
essential. Also, the mountains immediately became higher,
canyons deeper, trﬁéls more narrow, many more sharp rocks in

the road and the streams where one could get a drink or fill

a canteen much further apart.

We walked for five days before we located horses that

we could hire. I'll never fbrget one of the days when it

rained the entire day and the mountain trails became small

 




5

streams.f The first few times we slipped and fell, we hurt

our pride. After that we began to hurt more than our pride.

On the days when it was dry periodically we sat down to rest,
but it wasn't long before we were covered with ants and this
started us moving quickly. I can assure you that we all did

a lot of meditating during those long enduring hours.

One striking difference in our attitude when we were

able to obtain horses was that at the least outward sign of
strain, the rider would immediately dismount and walk until
the terrain became more favorable. I didn't see one person

on the rest of the trip show any impatience towards his horse.

I believe the ants taught their lesssn also, that when you're
tired and weary, additional pain administered only makes the
situation more intolerable. If I may paraphrase the old Indian
proverb: Don't criticize another Indian unless you have walked

a mile in his moccasins.

 




This is how we feel now in administering a new law.

We must learn to walk in the shoes of those who prQPOSed

the law, enacted the law, and those who will be regulated
by it, and this includes theanimals involved. We must do‘
it to see that it is implemented to the fullest intent and
extent and with the least harm that can be done to those who
are willing to comply. I emphasize, ”ghose who are willing
to compng‘

We deeply appreciate the confidence that has been
expressed about our Department by the Animal Welfare Institute
and others in administering this Act which naturally binds
our commitment even more, if that is possible, to see that
its implementation is successful. Such expressed support
inspires all of us within our organization to do the best job

possible.

 




On any controversial issue,.opposing sides seem to

develop some fears or threats to their positions that may,

or may not, be real. We know that some of them are not real,
and we intend to do everything that we can to dispel them.ﬁyf
Inhumane practices in the handling of these animals must stop.
Everyone seems to condone this philosophy, so we can not see

where the problem lies in applying the Act since it was

designed for that purpose.f The HumaneiASSociations are asking

all of those involved to show theméthrough our actions, not

M

our words, that we are sincere in our humane considerations.f

There is always a certain degree of skepticism.on the

part of those being regulated when administering any new law.
However, we have found from past experience that if we are firm,
fair, and consistent, we can get acceptance and we don't intend

to be any different in handling this Act. We have the utmost

confidence that with a little time for experience to accumulate

 




and acquaintances to be made betWeen all facets being

regulated and our personnel, empathy will be established

that will produce results that all of us desire.

I'Therefore, on behalf of the Agricultural Research Service,

I wish to express my appreciation for this honor being bestowed

on Dr. Jones and myself.

‘3
,. a,
a

As a representative of this Service which is one of the

major research organizations of this country, we fully appre-
ciate the need to implement the Act and yet, be fully cognizant
of the great responsibility that we have to get it accomplished
without having unnecessary harmful effects on research. If

our approach is objective, and that is our policy, then I feel
the research community will continue to react favorably towards
this law. We are satisfied with what has been done to date,

but there is a great more to do.

 




9

As a veterinarian who through the years has had to work

with almost all facets of this greatly diversified profession,

I wish to express my appreciation for this honor being bestowed

upon both of us. I feel our profession will continue to fully

support this law because it is designed to carry out a principie

which we as veterinarians are dedicated to fulfill. We are

satisfied with the cooperation we have received but we as a

profession can provide much more leadership than we have to

date in this area.

As a Federal Animal Health official, who for at least the

past 15 years has worked in close relationships with the State

officials who I‘m sure will become more and more involved in

the implementation of similar State laws, I Wish to express my

appreciation for this honor being bestowed upon us. In all of

our Animal Health programs, the States have passed similar laws

to the Federal one thereby supplementing our Acts and using

 




10

their authority to take action in areas that we can't reach.

The State—Federal teamwork that exists in our program§“we
believe, has beenxery successful. Here too, some States have
already taken action and passed similar laws. We are just
getting started. Yes, we can report progress but we have a

long way to go.

I want to take this opportunity to publicly express my
recognition and appreciation for Dr. Jones' most competent
and tireless effort that he, his staff, and the Animal Health
personnel have put forth in this program. Without his admini-
strative and technical capabilities, I'm sure I would not be
part of this ceremony. I would like to publicly thank all who
have worked so hard to enable the law to get off to a success-

ful start. Without this leadership, understanding, and support

hwe would be still struggling with basic details.

 




11

Finally, I would like to forecast that there will come

a time in the not too distant future when all persons involved
in this program will fully appreciate the benefits to be derived
by this Act. I predict that some will wonder why this legis-
lation was not passed sooner. In addition to the progress made
to date, we will see the inhumane practices eliminated, improved
facilities for handling research animals, and also a better
research model from which to draw better conCEUSions and results.
If we can just keep in mind the example set by Dr. Schweitzeryv-

In addition to being a talker he was also a doer. He not only

professed his philosophy he lived it. ’Actions do speak louder

than words. This is howve must evaluate our progress. It

isn't what we say we believe in that counts-~its what we do

about it.

 




We face many problems, but we are optimistic about

solving them. In fact solving them is purely a matter of

attitude. “Where there is the will, there is always a way.“

Senator Monroney stated the bill “goes only half as far as it
should, but it’s a good start.” He praised Mrs. Stevens, Senator

Maurine Neuberger, Representative Catherine May and the
“many, many other women who helped so faithfully.” As guests
gathered around the Senators to personally congratulate them

TREMARKS IN RESPONSE TO PRESENTATION OF THE ALBERT SCHWEITZER
MEDAL OF THE ANIMAL WELFARE INSTITUTE

 

 

SenaTor Holland, Mrs. STevens and disTinguished guesTs, l accepT This
honor wiTh exTreme graTiTude and much humiliTy. The feeling I have
aT This momenT is much The same as ThaT-which I experienced when Told
ThaT I was being appoinTed To my presenT posiTion.

The earliesT recollecTion I have of my love for animals daTes back
To The age of Ten when I found an abandoned mongrel puppy. The pup
had been severely injured, couldn'T sTand and could hardly breaThe.
NeverTheless, he had warm and wisTful eyes ThaT spoke for Themselves
in seeking help. In The grip of The greaT depression, my faTher
could hardly hold our family TogeTher much less pay The expenses for
The services of a veTerinarian. There were Two choices: eiTher
sTand by and waTch my faTher humanely desTroy The pup or, wiTh my
faTher's help, aTTempT To nurse iT back To healTh. I chose The
laTTer course, andrdue Time The pup recovered and became my devoTed
companion for several years. I am sure This incidenT gave rise To
my desire To become a veTerinarian.

Having operaTed a veTerinary clinic and visiTed in many oThers, I

can recall many Touching siTuaTions involving The love of man for The
creaTures ThaT TrusT in him and depend upon him for survival. Mans'
responsibiliTies To The animal kingdom are basic To our way of life,
and The way These responsibiliTies are discharged by each of us
reflecTs upon our socieTy. We musT do all wiThin our power To prevenT
a Tarnished reflecTion.

The honor I receive here Today would noT have been possible wiThouT
The Tireless efforTs of many individuals wiThin and ouTside The
DeparTmenT of AgriculTure. Time does noT permiT naming The many
individuals who worked wiTh us in meeTing The deadlines esTablished

by The LaboraTory Animal Welfare ACT. I wanT To especially Thank The
members of my immediaTe sTaff and Those individuals in ARS lnformaTion
Division as well as The DeparTmenT's Office of The General Counsel who
assisTed us in implemenTing The legislaTion. i

Also, I wanT To menTion ThaT when Dr. Mulhern, who direcTed our
Animal HealTh Division when we received The job of adminisTering

PL 89~544, moved up To The AdminisTraTor's office, Dr. E. E. Saulmon,
who had been serving in The office of The SecreTary, was appoinTed as
our new DirecTor. Dr. Saulmon who has an ouTsTanding record in The
field of RegulaTory VeTerinary Medicine, has provided our sTaff The
wise counsel and moral supporT needed To make our efforTs succeed.

Dr. AlberT SchweiTzer musT have experienced many frusTraTions in his
aTTemst To raise funds for consTrucTion of his hospiTal in The African
wilderness. BuT he succeeded, and his deeds as a humaniTarian will
live in The minds of mankind forever. His devoTion To duTy exemplified
by his "reverence for life" lives on as a beacon for The resT of us To
follow. We in USDA, who are reSponsible for adminisTering The humane
aspecTs of PL 89-544, shall conTinue sTriving for The besT possible
proTecTion, comforT, and safeTy for The research animals covered by The
law's provisions.

l wanT To share wiTh you a few lines of poeTry l have wriTTen for This
occasion. The inspiraTion for These ThoughTs came from many leTTers
and personal communicaTions received during The pasT year from The
owners of losT peTs.

Humane Societies

The.Animal welfare Institute

This year the Albert Schweitzer Medal of the.Animal welfare Institute will
be awarded to two outstandingly humane veterinarians, Dr. Francis J. Mulhern,
DeputyuAdministrator of the.Agricultura1 Research Service, and Dr. Earl M.
Jones, Senier Staff Veterinarian for Laboratory Animals, both of the United
States Department of Agriculture.

Senator Spessard L. Holland of Florida will present the medals in recogni-
tion of the great contribution made by De. Mulhern and Dr. Jones in imple-
mentation of P. L. 89~54ﬂ, the Laboratory Animal'Welfare.Act. Prior to his
new appointment, Dr. Jones was charged with enforcement of the 28-hour law,
which protects livestock in transit by rail. Dr. Mulbern, who was Director
of the.Animal Health Division, has been responsible for major progress in
animal disease eradication and control and received an award for his work
in totally eliminating a painful disease of swine, Vesicular Exanthema. The
medallists bring the same determination and experience in law enforcement
to the new law for protection of research animals.

working under very difficult conditions due to lack of needed appropriations
and striving to be fair to all concerned in carrying out the will of Congress,
the medallists and their colleagues in the.Animal Health Division have dealt
with a record number of controversial communications, including very critical
ones from some laboratories and animal dealers who did not wish to change
their mode of housing and caring for animals. They have had to work against
the uncertainty and confusion caused by introduction of repeal legislation

by Congressman Rogers and Senator Javits. The 1967 medallists, nevertheless,
have, through their leadership and hard work, initiated rapid improvement in
the treatment of animals, first by animal dealers and now by scientific insti-
tutions.

Presentation of the medals will take place Mbnday, November 27th, in wash-
ington, D. C. Names of medallists in previous years are listed in the enclosed
leaflet.
