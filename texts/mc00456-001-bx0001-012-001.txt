The Animals’ Friend has a long and honourable history: it
was founded by Ernest Bell some 45 years ago. It is now the
ofﬁcial organ of the National Council for Animals’ Welfare, and
the Council is anxious to make it a more effective and worthy
organ of the great movement of our day towards the recogni’
tion of the rights of animals to live, enjoy and develop their
own lives: to secure justice for animals: to make the world
safer and happier for them to live in, thereby making it safer
and happier for humanity.
