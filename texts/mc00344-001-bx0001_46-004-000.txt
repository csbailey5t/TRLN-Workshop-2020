breathing. Animal-control ofﬁcers said they
suspected she was a victim of heat exhaus-
tion.

Before she died, Buffy had led a horse, two
helicopters, an airplane, ﬁve police cruisers, a
dozen pickup trucks and an untold number of
trail bikes and all-terrain vehicles on a chase
through four towns in southern Dallas Coun-
ty.
Buffalo Bill’s manager Teri Wright said the
tragedy didn’t have to happen, explaining

that Buffy, like her corral mate, was a docile _

' creature.

“You’d run around, too,” Wright said, “if
they were chasing you with guns, horses, cars
and helicopters.” , _

She said authorities should have kept their
distance and allowed Buffy to graze, like
Missy, and then sneak up on her with a tran-
quilizer gun.

Kruse intended to approach the animal qui-
etly, just as he did with a circus lion that
escaped a few years back. But events soon
were beyond his control. ‘

After tracking Buffy on foot for several
miles, Kruse was able to corner her in a field.
, As he walked toward Buffy, the driver of a
dump truck, apparently unhappy about the
vehicles blocking Bear Creek Road, leaned on
his horn.

. Buffy charged toward Kruse, who was able
? to ﬁre a‘ single shot, which missed-

' “She scared the you-know-what out of me,”
‘ he said.

 

C
You’d run around, too.’
Terri Wright

 

Kruse continued his pursuit, often through
thick grass as much as 8 feet tall.

“I can handle it,” he said. “I live in the
woods.”

As he pursued Buffy, he sought help from
startled residents. E. L. Cheshier, a retired
farmer on 'Westmoreland Road in Glen
Heights, was on his front porch snapping a
pail of fresh-picked green beans when Buffy
ran past.

“It went back yonder,” Cheshier shouted,
motioning Kruse toward the back pasture,
where Buffy grazed with a herd of cattle for a
few moments until a WFAA-Channe18 heli-
copter flew over.

“She went over the back fence like it
wasn’t even there,” said DeSoto police ofﬁcer
Len Chadwick.

Buffy was next seen in Ovilla, and soon~she
was in Cedar Hill. By this time, Kruse had
had enough of the chase on foot and mo-
tioned for a helicopter from radio station
KVIL to land in a pasture.

Kruse took to the air and was set down
near a pond where Buffy was catching her
breath. He took aim and ﬁred twice, hitting
her both times. Nevertheless, Buffy took off
running.

Thanks to the KVIL helicopter, Kruse
quickly caught up with her again. Back on
the ground, he hit her with two more tran-
quilizer darts.

And she was ﬁnished.

i The Least We Owe to

 

Recently on this page [June 4], the re-
nowned heart specialist Dr. Michael DeBakey
raised serious questions about the value of
legislation I have introduced (HR. 778) to
prohibit federal funding for research. using
animals acquired from shelters. While I have

.1 ',the greatest respect for Dr. DeBakey and his

singular accomplishments in the field of bio-
medical research, many of his arguments had
little or no relation to my bill, and a response
is warranted.

The doctor discusses at length the amazing
strides that have been made through the use
:of laboratory animals for controlled studies.
:This is irrefutable. But it is important to point
'out that this bill is not intended to prevent or
slow such research.

I am not part of the anti-vivisectionist move
.ment, and my voting record demonstrates my
commitment to biomedical research. While I
strongly believe that humans bear certain re-
sponsibilities with regard to the treatment of
animals, Dr. DeBakey’s implication that my
priorities (and those of more than 80 cosponsors
of the legislation) put animal rights before the

welfare of AIDS victims, cancer sufferers and ‘

ﬂiainlrfhlldren is misguided.

Neglected mare destroyed

MIRAMAR —- Despite an effort by volunteers to i,
save an emaciated mare nicknamed “Sweet 4

To understand HR. 778, it is necessary to
distinguish between purpose-bred and random-
source animals. Purposebred animals are those
raised in colonies for utilization in laboratory
research. Random-source animals derive from a
variety of backgrounds. Some come from litters
of cats or dogs that have bred repeatedly, some'
are obtained through newspaper advertisements
and some come from shelters.

HR. 778 would preventthe use only of
those animals taken from shelters. The major‘
ity of random—source animals would not be
affected.

There are several valid reasons to distin-
guish between shelter animals and other ran-
dom—source animals. Most importantly, the
majority of shelter animals are former pets. It
is rarely an easy decision for a pet owner to

7 surrender an animal to a community animal

shelter, but most do so in the hope that the
animal will be adopted. ;. '

The alternative, of course, is rapid and
humane euthanasia. Given the choice between
this option and an unknown future for the
animal as the subject of laboratory research,
most pet owners would, I feel, choose the
former. Indeed, it is conceivable that pet

owners may reject the option of taking animals
to shelters if they believe their pets could
wind up in a research laboratory. And if public
confidence in the shelter system erodes, local
communities could find themselves with a
harder-to-manage problem of animal control.

Dr. DeBakey also argues that purpose-bred
animals cost more than random-source ani-
mals, and that HR. 778 would therefore make
research prohibitively expensive. This is a
fallacy. Most random-source animals could
still be used for federally funded research
under my bill.

Furthermore, the National Institutes of "

Health, whose funding sources for biomedical
research would be affected by the bill, has
found that the cost differential is minimal in
any case. An NIH study found that because
random-source animals must be- quarantined
and conditioned to the laboratory, the most
important factor in cost is the “stamina and

vitality” of the research animals.

In 1973 NIH published a study advocating E

the use of purpose-bred animals over random-
source animals. The study found that pur-
pose-bred animals are preferable for research

because they are of known age, genetic back- .
ground and temperament. It added that pur— .

pose-bred animals died less often of common

diseases than random-source animals, and that .

they were moreeasily used to assemble base-
line reference data.

Today,iNIH no longer uses shelter animals '

for its in-house research. The executive direc-
tor of the NIH lnteragency Research Animal
Committee recently explained, “Intramurally,
NIH . . . acquires any purchase dogs, cats and
primates from USDA-registered and -ap-

« proved dealers. None of these dealers acquire

animals from pounds or shelters; they come
from both purpose-bred colonies and from a
few dealers who buy animals from rural areas
(farm dogs and cats)."

' Dr. DeBakey also makes a poignant plea for .
continued biomedical research to solve the great ‘

medical mysteries of our day. I agree whole-

heartedly. It is instructive that former senator ='

WASHINGTON POST - June 13, 1987

 

 

Medicine Doesn’t Need Dogs and Cats From the Pound

Michael E. DeBakey's article in favor of releasing
pound animals for research, “Medicine Needs These
Animals" [oped June 4], pulled out all the emotional
stops. This 13 particularly ironic since he accuses the
animal- protection movement of using emotionalism
instead of facts.

As is always the case when the biomedical commu-
nity talks about pound seizure (the practice of releas-
ing former pets from animal shelters for 'use in
' research laboratories), DeBakey confuses the need
for animals—even dogs and cats—in research with
. the need for dogs and cats from pounds. The fomier
'1 pets make up less than 1 percent of all the animals
'1 used in research annually. If pound animals were no
' longer available, would all vital research into every
jE major medical problem cease? Obviously not. Animals
.bred specifically for research, for example, would still

eliminate the use of all animals in research. The issue
is one of trust. We believe that it is the moral
obligation of an animal shelter to serve not as a
warehouse for research laboratories, but as a safe

haven for a community’s lost, unwanted or abandoned ,

animals. This is the mandate of a shelter, the reason
for its existence. To violate that mandate by feeding
animals into the research pipeline can only serve to

undermine public trust in community animal-control .

efforts. Animals and communities will suffer.

The biomedical community refers to these animals
as “unwanted.” They are, rather, displaced, through
no fault of their own. Some are lost pets that have
ended up in laboratories despite desperate attempts

by their owners to find them. Some are stolen

specifically to fuel the laboratory trade. Some are
reserved for research while still in the shelter without

dogs and cats available because they are easier to

work with. Researchers are, therefore, c0mpeting .

directly with those who would adopt these animals.

The research community is exploiting the national
tragedy of pet overpopulation to ensure a readily
accessible supply of research animals. This may seem
to be in the best interest of researchers, but it is
certainly not in the best interest of the community.

Finally, we resent DeBakey's allusion to “harass-
ment, terrorism and vandalism masquerading as con-
cern for animals.” This does a grave injustice to the
millions of peaceful, dedicated people who support and
work on behalf of animal protection, and who do not
perform or condone such acts.

. ATLANTA JOURNAL G CONSTITUTION- July 3,1987
Pound animals have too many variables for research use

,’ WASHINGTON —- In response to
iDr. Michael DeBakey’ 8 June 17 Op-Ed
article against the Pet Protection Act
(“Lifesaving medical research depends
on access to abandoned pound ani-

mals”), let me offer the following com--

ments. I Speak as a practicing physi-
cian, a teacher of residents and
medical students and as chairman of
the Physicians Committee for Responsi-
ble Medicine.

The Pet Protection Act will prevent
researchers from using animals from
public or private shelters in projects
funded by the National Institutes of
Health It certainly will not prohibit an-
imal research, and will not prohibit the
use of dogs and cats in research. If the

' bill is passed, our shelters will ret’rn
to their original purpose: to prowde
refuge for lost and homeless pets. So
far, 79 colleagues of Rep. Robert Mra-

, zek (D-N.Y.) have agreed with this pro-

posal and are now co-sponsors of the

, bill. Eleven states, four Western Euro-

. pean countries and numerous cities and

f

counties have already passed similar
laws.

Although pound animals are less ex-
pensive than purpose-bred animals, this
difference is very small in the overall

research budget of salaries, computers ‘

and other equipment.

The age, breed, health (both current
and previous) and history of medical
treatment of most shelter animals are
unknown. The inability to document
these variables may lead to serious
misinterpretation of results. Any re-
search paper on human subjects that
did not account for these variables
would stand no chance of acceptance
into any medical journal.

Some argue that shelter animals
used in research would “die anyway.”
But sending a pet to a lab is a far dif-
ferent fate from euthanasia in a shel-
ter. Humane euthanasia, properly per-
formed, is a respectful and non-
traumatic procedure. The difference
between the animal’s existence before
death in a lab and euthanasia in a shel-

 

,.—.._ p... , -~

ter is the difference between those who
may view animals as disposable items
and those who thanklessly care for
homeless animals in their last days on
Earth.

Researchers who want continued
access to pets for experiments, if they
are honest, will admit that it is not this
issue that worries them. Indeed, many
jurisdictions have prohibited sending
shelter animals to laboratories, with no
adverse effects. Some members of the
research community fear the advance
of regulation on their practices and
wish to concede nothing.

There is a different breed of re-
searchers, doctors and medical stu-
dents, ever growing in number, that is
taking a new attitude toward animals.

'Let us not inhibit the move toward eth- 4

ical medicine, but do all we can to en-

courage it.

Dear Mr. Osier:

Thanks for taking the time to answer my letter of March 15.

Obviously I have read Dr. Michael Fox's column many times. He is an out-
standing Veterinarian, and one of the leaders of the Humane Society of the
United States against factory farming in this country. He has been for a
long time, but his column generally deals with problems people face with
their pets._

I wrote a letter to the edﬁtDQ'on May 11 (copy enclosed), which I have
yet to see in the papers. Of course, I didn't really expect the papers
to run this letter since I know it is controversial as far as the papers
are concerned.

Some time ago there was a lot of talk in.Atlanta - and in the press - about‘
dog racing and horse racing in our fair city. However, not a word was said
about the way dogs are trained - with the use of live rabbits and kittens
which are torn apart in the process. NOthing was said about how these dogs
usually only run one or two years and in most cases are then destroyed. Some
are placed in caring homes, but there are so many of them, this is not pos-
sible. Nothing was said about the fact that many of the dogs do not make it
in the racing world and are simply destroyed. NOthing was said about the
way horses are doped before races to make sure they run, even though they
may have sore legs. No, sadly, the whole story about the mistreatment of
animals is generally not revealed because there is so much.money involved,

and greedy man really doesn't give a damn about the animals - only the
bucks involved.

The papers frequently run stories about rodeos, but never the sadness and
truth behind the scenes as revealed by the Humane Society of the U.S. No
Humane Society will ever approve a rodeo, so why not ask them why?

an1 has abused, misused animals fer so long a period of time, he seldom
looks beyond the dollar he is making at the animal's expense.

Sincerely,

Letter To the Editor:

HOW I wish the media had been as zealous in its revelations of the inhumanities
being inflicted upon helpless animals throughout the country as it has always
been in revealing the peccadillos and dishonesty of so many of our political and
other public figures.

Had they been as diligent, perhaps there wpuld never have been an Animal Rights
movement, nor a reason for one. Had they truly pursued and revealed to the pub-
lic, the brutalities inflicted upon so many animals in so many research labora-
tories in the “hope" they might some day help mankind, most of it would have been
eradicated. Why haven't they investigated and revealed the deplorable conditions
under which our veal calves are raised - confined in tiny cages where it is almost
impossible fOr them to stand up. Nbst of these calves never see green grass or
their mothers. But, of course, they are just dumb animals who cannot vote, and
certainly will never pay any taxes.

The Georgia legislature in their recent meeting, passed a law to protect all

kinds of animals, but the farmers were excluded. Of course they were, they have
their own laws entitled "Farm Policies for 1986", which I am sure they still fOl-'
low. One of these is as follows: ”Laws have been enacted in several countries
that limit or prohibit raising of livestock and poultry in certain types of en-
vironments. We oppose any legislation or regulatory actions which would tend to
prohibit good poultry and livestock husbandry practices".

People do not oppose "good” livestock and poultry practices, but factory farm-
ing can hardly be called "good" - certainly not for the animals involved. Mbre
people are becoming vegetarians because of factory farming, and more of them are
giving up eating eggs because of the horrible way laying hens are confined.

Another one of their policies - "Domestic livestock grazing permits should not
be reduced or eliminated as a result of misuse of public lands by wild horses,
burros, deer or elk". The arrogance of this thinking is beyond belief. It is
the cattle who are destroying our public lands, not the wild animals who live

there and who belong there.

And then we have that all-American, good family pastime — the rodeo.
quiring reporter might be surprised at what he finds is going on in rodeos.
The ”wild" horses are only ”wild" because of the bucking strap around their~
body.

So - hOW'abOUt it media? How about investigating the conditions under which
so many of our animal friends try to survive, and see how you would like to
try and exist under the same circumstances.

The media could do a world of good for defenseless animals if they had the
guts and the backbone to investigate and reveal what they find.

Sincerely,

Alternative
to pet burial
is finding
owner favor

By Joe Farmer
Forrest City, Ark., Bureau

 

 

McCRORY, Ark. —— Bereaved
pet owners are finding a new
form of solace in a century-old
process. ‘

Freeze-drying, a form of taxi-
dermy that involves removing
the moisture from the body rath-
er than tanning and forming the
hide, is becoming increasingly
popular among pet owners who
want to preserve their pets after
death, say the owners of Cache
River Taxidermy near, here.

The process was introduced in
1893, said co-owner Barri

O’Shields, and is used mainly in '

preserving foods and manufac-
turing instant coffee. It also has
been used by taxidermists to
preserve small game animals
and fish, he said, but has only
caught on as a way to preserve
pets in recent years.

While O’Shields and his two

partners didn’t have figures on
how many pets they’ve freeze-
dried, they say the process —
costing $375 to $700 for an aver-
age pet -- is preferable to con-
ventional taxidermy in the eyes
of many pet ownerswho want to
preserve their animals. Freeze-
drying does not require skin-
ning the animal, which they say
is why many owners find it more
acceptable.

, As the idea has caught on,
Cache River Taxidermy has

gained attention as well. The
freeze-drying process offered by
the business, located about six
miles from McCrory in the
Grays community of Woodruff
County, was mentioned in Ann
Landers’ nationally syndicated
advice column recently as an al-
ternative for pet owners who
wanted to preserve their ani-
mals.

“Some woman wrote Ann
Landers. upset because her pet
had died,” said Cache River co-
owner Larry Winston. “Another
woman wrote back and told her
to get in touch with us. Ann
Landers called five times and
talked with us to be sure we
were legitimate, then she put us
in her column.”

The business is owned by Win-
ston, 44; his father, J. W. Win-
ston, 64, and O‘Shields, 23, all na-

one to see it,” O’Shields said. “We
View this as kind of being in the
undertaking business for pets.
People take that very seriously.”

The process, he said, involves
freezing the animal, removing
the organs, stuffing the cavity,
placing wire supports in the
body to retain shape and replac-
ing the eyes with glass eyes.
After all this has been done, said
O‘Shields, moisture is removed
from the body.

The drying process for an
average-size pet can take as long
as three months, Winston said.

The animal can be posed in
any position —- one woman want-
ed her small dog lying in its bas-
ket.

“We open the machine once a
week and weigh the animals,”

Winston said.

“About 70 percent of the body
weight will be removed as it
dries.”

With all the moisture removed
from the cells, the animal will
last indefinitely. The only dan-
ger of deterioration, Winston
said, would be if it were subject-
ed to moisture for an extended
period. .

“Some of that could find its
way back to the cells, and they
would begin to deteriorate,” he
said.

Freeze-drying is effective for
small- to medium-sized animals
but takes 'too long for anything
as large as a deer. The business
has, however, freeze-dried the
heads of a two-headed calf.

With pet funerals and ceme-
teries becoming more common,
the cost of preserving the ani-
mal is small by comparison. Fu-
neral costs for an average-size
pet can run from $1,000 to $1,500,
Winston said.

But most people aren’t con-
cerned about the cost, anyway.

“The people who have this
done aren’t worried about the
money,” Winston said.

about gators are made in the
early summer and, he feels,
most are unwarranted. “Peo’
ple call me up and say, ‘Hey,
there’s an alligator in my
canal, I want you to come kill
it.’ It’s not that it’s doing
anything in particular, it’s just
there, you know? I say, ‘So
what? It’s not going to rust
climb out of the water and at,
tack you.’ ”

Lawrence says the reptiles
are generally harmless, and get
angry only if provoked. “Ga-
tors don’t want to eat peOple.
They’re afraid of people.”

The Nuisance Alligator Pro
gram issues 45—day licenses alr
lowing civilian trappers to kill
particular gators. If the gato‘r
isn’t killed in that time, he is
free and clear...until someone
else complains about him.

Last year, 689 gators—out of
1,858 complaint
targets—were
killed with
N.A.P. permits.

Most of the gators
could have been

opinion. He’s personally

TAMPA TRIBUNE - June 29, 1987

Girl, 7, injured when ”
dogs attack 2 children ,

By PAT DUNNIGAN
Tribune Correspondent

ST. PETERSBURG — A 7-year-.

old girl received deep cuts on her
face and head Sunday when she and
another child were attacked by two
Great Danes, said a spokesman
from the Pinellas County Sheriff’s
Office.

The incident occurred When an
adult and three children were out
for a stroll in a neighborhood near
69th Street North Sunday afternoon.

The girl, identified as Kelly Riv-
ers of Mims, was visiting the home
of her second cousin, Janet Matney
of 4920 69th St. N., when the attack
occurred, Matney said Sunday eve-
ning.

Matney said the four were re-

turning from their walk at about

4:15 pm. when the dogs attacked.
0n the outing were Kelley Rivers;
Rivers’ sister Shelby, 5, who is con-
fined to a wheelchair; Matney’s
daughter, Judith Ann, 28; and a 10-
year-old grandsonpf Janet Mat-

ney’s.

, Matney said she, her husband
and the girls’ mother were sitting at
the dinner table when she saw that ‘
the dogs, which belong to a neigh-
bor, had gotten loose.

“I just saw the dog’s tail pass by
and I said ’Oh, my gosh, they’ll at-
tack the children,’ ” Matney said.

Matney said when she got out-
side the house she saw the largest
dog knock the older girl to the
ground. “The dog jumped on her
and was chewing her head,” Matney
said.

Matney ‘said the smaller Great
Dane had jumped up on the wheel-
chair. However, Matney’s daughter
was able to pick up the younger girl
and get her into the house un-
harmed.

Matney and several neighbors fi-
nally were able to pull the older girl
away from the dog, but not before .
she had been bitten on her ear,
cheek, neck and,the back of her '
head, Matney said. '

. , Nepalese Prince Gives
' S.F. Zoo 2 Baby Rhinos

By Dale Cbempiwrw _...

- Two rare rhinos, descended . no species in the world have declin?
from a breed believed to have ' ed.
inspired the European myth of '
the unicorn, got a festive wel-
come yesterday to the San
Francisco Zoo. " 1;

#4

A gift from King Birenda .of
Nepal, the pair of greater one-horn-
ed rhinoceri was presented yester-
day by Nepal’s Frince Gayendra at a
sunny ceremony that drew about
200 human friends of the zoo and
some screeching peacocks who hap-
pened to be nearby.

The festivities were held just
outside a paddock specially rebuilt
for the newcomers, a seven-month-
old female and a year-01d male.
They are the first of their breed to
be housed at the zoo. ~ '

As the chunky, gray rhinos shy-
ly stood their distance, Prince Gay-
endra said that the female is called
Shanti and the male, Chettra —-
Nepalese names which together
mean “Zone of Peace.” "

Earlier in his threeweek Amer.
ican tour, Prince Gayendra present-
ed two young f_emale rhinos to the
National Zoo in Washington, which
already has a male of the species.

Mayor Dianne Feinstein and
her husband, Richard Blum, who
serves in San Francisco as honorary
consul of Nepal, joined in the wel-
coming tributes. ‘ '

The mayor noted that, the two
rhinos “are extremely nearsighted,

 

The two animals represent a
bond of friendship between Nepal
and the US. and the people of San
Francisco, the prince added.

Prince Gayendra is Chairman.
of the King Mahendra Trust for Na:

with the World Wildlife Fund, man?

home to the new San Francisco
rhinos before they were dispatched
on a 9000mm journey from Nepal.

LOS ANGELES TIMES - June 19, 1987

:Innovattve Program Matches Pets thh the Elderly

By MARY SCHLANGEN STEIN

. HOUSTON (UPI)—-The small,
. mixed—breed dog, no longer wanted

. by its owners, was tossed from a ‘

‘ moving car, rolling over and over
_ until it landed in a crumpledheap
' of dirt and matted hair.

’ A person witnessing the cruel
abandonment retrieved the gray
and white mutt and took it to the
Houston Society for Prevention of
: Cruelty to Animals. There, sitting
in a kennel awaiting medical treat-

' ment, the dog caught the eye of
’ Bloyce and Barbara Tarpley.

The recently retired couple had
moved south from Oklahoma to be
closer to their daughter and grand-
children. But with no work, they
found themselves increasingly
lonely at home.

The lonely dog and the lonely

couple were a perfect match. The .

, Pekingese—poodle mix, now known
as Daisy, does tricks on command,

is kept spotlessly clean and sleeps

on the Tarpleys’ bed.

New Joy in Their Lives '

The Tarpleys have new joy in
their lives, thanks to a program
created to unite dogs and cats with
the elderly.

“We felt like we needed some
thing else in our lives,” Barbara
. Tarpley said. '

“I think everybody needs some—‘

' thing to love. She's with us all the
time. She really was the answer to
us."

The Purina Pets for People Pro-
gram is now available to people

over 60 years old at 106 shelters in
as. .. - '

.90‘ cities throughout the United

States. It began as a program of the
Humane Society of Missouri in St.

Louis three years ago, with the

Ralston Purina Co. eventually
picking up sponsorship.

“The program was very success-
ful on two counts,” said Kathryn
Wright, a Humane Society worker
who now is executive director of
Pets for People. “The shelter's

'adoption rate increased, which is

important. to an animal shelter
considering the large numbers of
homeless animals received.

Orientation Session

“Also, it received a great deal of
positive media attention, which

increased adoptions and donations!

to the shelter. We are finding the
increase in adoptions and donatiOns
to be holding true throughout the
country for all participating shel-
tersf’

Under the program, specially

' trained employees at local animal

shelters work with elderly people
to select a dog or cat suited to them.
The animal must. be at least 1 year
old. .

For each animal adopted, the
program pays the animal shelter
$100 to cover the adoption fee and
the cost of having the animal

spayed or neutered. Many of the _

initial costs of pet ownership, such
as veterinary exams and shots, a
starter supply of pet food, water
and food bowls, a collar and leash
are also supplied.

Applicants for the program go

through an orientation session on

the benefits and responsibilities of
pet ownership, and are evaluated
on their abilities to care for and
affordapet '

At least 5, 000 animals have been

‘ adopted under the Pets for People

program, which is expected to
donate $1 million to participating
animal shelters this year.

“All the adopters add is love,”
says actress Audrey Meadows,
chairman of the program’s adviso-
ry board. “If I had to describe the
Pets for People Program in one
sentence, I would say it is the
giving and receiving of love.”

Pets for People is a vital program
because of the large numbers of
homeless animals and the growing
number of elderly people living
alone, Wright said.

‘A Win-Win Situation’

“Animal shelters On a nationwide

basis receive approximately 10 mil-.

lion homeless animals a year. Of
that, 1.5 million are adopted annu-
ally," she said. “Pets for People
enables shelters to increase their
adoptions of these homeless ani-
mals. In particular, the program
has been very successful in placing
animals 1 year of age and older.
Animals of that age traditionally
are harder for shelters to place,
versus puppies and kittens.

“Second, the senior citizen popu-
lation segment in our country is the
fastest growing population seg-
ment. In addition, the number of

senior citizens living alone is sig~

nificant—-out of 26 million, 9 million 3

live alone.
“Therefore, this matching of

. senior citizens in need of compan~

ionship with homeless pets is truly
a win—win situation for both par-
ties.”

And, Wright said, there is grow-
ing medical evidence of the numer-
ous benefits of pet ownership.

“Studies strongly suggest pet ;

ownership can improve the overall
mental and physical well-being of
individuals of all ages, including
senior citizens,” she said.

Studies conducted at the Univer-
sity of Maryland and University of
Pennsylvania in the late 19708
showed pet ownership increased a
heart attack victim’s chances for
survival. Researchers Dr. James
Lynch, Dr. Aaron Katcher and
Ericka Friedman also learned the

presence of a pet could significant- =
ly lower the blood pressure of a 1

person talking to or resting next to
the animal.

Perhaps the most important as-
pect of pet ownership for the
elderly-is that it gives them a
feeling of purpose and responsibili-
ty -- a feeling that he or she is
needed.

Studies of people who adopted
pets under the program showed
97% felt happier, 76% felt safer
and 75% felt healthier.

 

 

Nearly '

100% said their pets were good;

companions or friends, and 93%'
said they felt less lonely since,

adopting apet.

ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH - June 21, .1987

 

MOVie ‘

LOS ANGELES (AP) -¥ Chimpan-

, zees used for the movie “Project X”
..-— including two that came from the
St. Louis Zoo —— were clubbed by ani-
; mal trainers, a movie technician

says.

Paul Mueller, a special-effects
technician, said Thursday that he had
seen trainers strike the chimpanzees
with blackjacks. He is the first person
who worked on the movie to volun-

teer an account of the purported '

abuse. ‘

Animal welfare activists say other
witnesses have been afraid to come
forward because they feared they
would be barred from working in the
movie industry.

One of the trainers for the movie
“became so infuriated with his chimp
that he appeared to have gone bef-
serk," Mueller said. He spoke at a
news conference with Bob Barker,
game show host and long-time animal,
rights activist.

Mueller said the trainer “beat the
animai with his fists, severely.”

But Hubert Wells, head trainer for
“Project X," denied the allegations.
He said that animals were never mis-
treated and that trainers did not use
clubs or blackjacks. ,

Another trainer, Mark Harden,
said: “No animal, and no one on the
set, was hurt.”

The movie, starring Matthew Bro-
derick, is about a young Air Force
pilot who saves a group of chimps

‘ from a deadly laboratory experi-

ment.
The St. Louis 200 sold two chimps
for $8,000 in May 1985 to Earl Tatum,

f an animal dealer, who then sold them

to the movie.

Charlie Hoessle, Zoo director, has
said he did not know the chimpanzees
were going to go to a movie company.
But he has also said that he does not
oppose selling animals to the movies

as long as they are treated

 

appropriately.

The two chimpanzees, Arthur and
Luke, are now at an animal sanctu-
ary, Primarily Primates, in San Ant0a

nio, Texas. The sanctuary director,
Wallace Swett, said Arthur, Luke, and
three others from the movie show
signs of abuse.

Swett says the chimpanzees flinch
and cower if someone raises an arm
suddenly. Luke is terrified of other
chimpanzees, and Arthur plucks out
his hair -— a sign of stress. Swett said.

An investigation-by the American
Humane Association, which monitors
treatment of animals on movie sets,
found no evidence that chimpanzees
were beaten or mistreated during
filming of “Project X.” Association
official Carmelita Pope characterized
the allegations as “a rumor that
somehow grew.” - ,

Mueller said, however, that the as-.
sociation representative wasn’t al-
ways on the set. The representative

ATLANTA JOURNAL * July 6, 1987

 

By Charles Salter
Staff Writer

 

A state wildlife biologist in metrOpoli-
tan Atlanta has learned to expect the unex-
pected in work that involves close encoun-
ters with a variety of critters ranging from
nuisance raccoons to big, dangerous cats
from Africa.

Bob Monroe of Cartersville, assigned to
the Game Management Division. of the state
Department of Natural Resources in Atlan-
ta, has Spent several years handling urban
wildlife cases in Fulton, DeKalb, Gwinnett,
Cobb, Douglas and Rockdale counties.

Most of the calls were from homeown- ‘

ers complaining about squirrels nesting in
attics, raccoons raiding garbage cans at
night, beavers damaging ornamental shrubs
and trees. or snakes residing around ivy
and rock gardens in landscaped yards. But
he has spent some suspenseful, tense hours
seizing, transporting and finding new homes
for lions, tigers, cougars, lynxes, bears and
snakes that were abandoned, held in ex-
tremely poor conditions, or owned without a
state permit.

Monroe, 45, who majored in zoology and
earned a master’s degree in wildlife man-
agement at the University of Georgia,
chuckled as he recalled the cold, rainy
night several years ago when DNR person-
nel seized and loaded onto trucks some ex-
otic animals owned without a permit by a
man in a rural area of metro Atlanta.

“He had seven wolves, two tigers, two
cougars and one lynx,” Monroe said. “We
had deer-carrying crates and [live] bear
traps. It was obvious to me a bear trap was
not quite the thing to put a tiger in. These
were nervous and active animals.”

The animals’ owner agreed to help load

er;

“The wolves were semi-tame, but I
wouldn’t want to go in and mess with
them,” Monroe said. “He put them in our
deer-carrying crates made of plywood. The
wolves immediately began eating them
from the inside out. I heard chunks of ply-
wood falling. It was unnerving.”

Hours later, the workers finally finished
loading the crated animals onto the trailer.

..—.

Then the truck and stock trailer slid off the '

country road into a ditch. As rain fell, wea-
ry workers and irritated animals waited for
a wrecker.

“I walked over to my truck and discov-
ered the cougar had eaten a hole in the end
of the deer crate, and his head and shoul-
ders were sticking out,” Monroe said. “At

almost 3 a.m., we knocked on a farmer’s L
door and asked him to lend us some lum- j
her, a hammer and nails to rebulld that

‘<--.~‘" l

crate to carry the cougar.”

Arrangements had been made for the

in Fulton County animal control agency to
A take the wolves, and other animals were to

be farmed out. All Atlanta veterinarian had
agreed to provide quarters for a tiger.

“I was driving down Ashby Street in At-
lanta about 3:30 am. with a big tiger in an
Open cage in the back of my truck,” Mono
roe said. “I stopped at a traffic light. Two
men were talking in a car next to me. One
of the men did a classic double take.

“He looked over there at the tiger like
it didn’t compute and turned to speak to his
friend, then his head whipped back around.
It was a very big tiger. He rolled the win-
dow down and said, ‘Hey, man, we got
those in Atlanta?’ ”

“We do now,” Monroe replied.

On occasions, he has taken animals to
be housed in facilities owned by Bill New-
man, formerly of the Atlanta Humane Soci-
ety, and cages and fenced areas on property
of Harold “Red” Palmer in Douglas County.
Palmer is the inventor of the tranquilizer
dart gun or “capture gun” that is used to

, immobilize animals for research and game

management programs in numerous na-
tions.

One night, Fulton animal control offi-
cers answered a call and seized a cougar
that had walked freel beside its master

“That’s no place to carry a cougar,”
Monroe said. “It’s amazing what people will

yMonroe, who worked three years as a
wildlife biologist on Sapelo Island, said peo-
ple sometimes come to the wrong conclu-
sions about wild animals’ behavior and their
suitability as pets after watching movies
featuring animals.

“They think of wild animals as being
friendly animals with humanlike qualities,”
he said, “especially with animals that are
cunning and smart such as raccoons. The
public is tempted to make it a pet. Some:
one walks over to a log, picks up one [a
raccoon] and pets it. A wild raccoon
will eat your lunch if you try that.”

The biologist said some Atlanta home-
owners observe a raccoon lifting the lid off
a garbage can to eat food scraps or see it
peering through a sliding glass door while a
family watches television.

“They think it’s neat to start feeding the
raccoon,” he said. “Then they have a whole.
family of raccoons to feed. It becomes not
so cute. The raccoons become conditioned»
to peOple and even try to come in the house
because they learned that is where the free
meal came from. Then the people stop-
feeding them, but the raccoons keep com-.

“I have been to houses that if you had‘

tried to manage them for snakes, it couldn‘t
be done any better,” he said. “There are
rock gardens, fences, ivy, all kinds of
ground cover ideal for snakes. A typical
landscaped yard with lots of ground cover
makes ideal snake habitat.”
The calls .usually concern green-neck
snakes, king snakes, black or gray rat
snakes, and common water snakes. But
there are numerous copperheads, which are
poisonous snakes, living in wooded sections
of the city. .
'_ “Some people think any snake in the

water is a water moccasin,” Monroe said.
“But Atlanta is out of the range of water
; moccasins.”

i N eighbor’s cat must scat,

worried homeowner says-

By Phillip Morris
STAFF WRITER

Cheryl Rickman, the proud owner of

three chihuahuas, has nothing against _

pets. _
But when a real estate agent told her
that a next-door neighbor’s mountain
lion was lowering the value of her Up-
per Riverdale property, Rickman de-
cided the lion had to go.

Rickman, of 316 Ashwood Ave.,
went ‘to the Dayton prosecutor’s office
Wednesday to air her claims that the
mountain lion — housed less-than 18
inches from her property - is a nui-
sance and threat.

The lion’s owner, Jerry Guillerman,

says there is no law prohibiting him

' from keeping the animal and that his

pet — which neighbors said he has had
at least eight years — poses no threat.
That’s not how Rickman sees it.
She questions whether the animal’s

cage could hold it if it tried to escape.

And she said the lion “cries” when it

., is hungry, “smells awful” at times, and

has been known to hiss and snap at
people. .'

“It’s a pretty Cat, in fact it’s gor-
geous,” she added, “but it doesn’t be-
long in Dayton.”

She said she called both the Mont-
gomery County Humane Society and

Roberta Walker, Humane Society

5 chief cruelty investigator, said the soci- '
5 ety investigates animal abuse.

“If the lion was not being abused, if
it was being fed and watered and had
appropriate shelter, then our hands are
tied,” Walker said. _ . ' *

A state wildlife official said he has no

5' jurisidiction because the animal is not
‘ native to Ohio.

“Irealiy don’t know who’s jurisdic-
tion that case would be,” said Richard
Jaspen, an assistant wildlife manage-
ment supervisor based in Xenia. “We ,
are only charged with the protection of
native wild animals.”

Dayton’s vicious-animal ordinance

._ bans any animal that has the “propensi-

ty to bite or cause physical harm to a
human being, domestic animal, or
feline.”

But city Law Director J. Anthony
Sawyer indicated that just keeping a
mountain lion might not violate the
law. -

The testimony of a game warden or
other animal expert may be needed to
determine whether the lion has the pro-
pensity for viciousness and is therefore
illegal under city law, Sawyer said.

Guillerman said his pet has never bit-
ten anyone and therefore can not be
considered vicious. _

He also said Rickman has never com-
plained to him directly and that he does '
not understand why she’s making such
a fuss. '

Rickman’s husband, David, said he

had no‘problem with the lion until he
; learned it Could lower his property’s

value by $4,000 to $6,000.

Veterinarian
Harola’Albers
works overtime

to protect
Florida ’5
pelicans from
the hazards
of living
too close to man

20 JUL v 7987/50 PLUS

sThisD Doctor Is
for thc’ . 01

s THE ANESTHETIC he has in-

jected begins to take effect,

Dr. Harold Albers peers in-

tently through wire-rimmed
glasses at the patient. With deft
strokes he cleans the wound, sutures
it, gently smoothes a few rufﬂed feath-
ers—and returns the ﬂapping brown
pelican to its case. “Fishhooks again,”
Dr. Albers mutters. “It’s sad what man
can do.”

In the uneasy truce that prevails
between humankind and wildlife, Ha-
rold Albers strives to maintain the bal-
ance. A 59-year-old veterinarian with
a thriving practice and 17 employees
in St. Petersburg, Fla., he sees
hundreds of people’s pets a week—-
cats to be declawed, dogs with aller-
gies, parakeets suffering from infec-
tions. But it is after ofﬁce hours, when
the paying customers have left, that
Albers turns his attention to the needs
of creatures without masters.

In large cases piled beside a sink at
Albers’s Northeast Animal Hospital,
injured wild birds await his ministra-
tions. He works quietly and methodi-
cally, ignoring the din of barking dogs
and wailing cats in kennels lining the
walls. A ﬁberglass cast on a blue
heron’s fractured leg is inspected; the
heron’s doing fine. The eye of a Loui-
siana heron, hit by a baseball at a Lit-
tle League park, takes a few stitches.
With four assistants to hold a jumpy
pelican still, Albers anesthetizes the
bird and prepares to sew up a tear in its
pouch, perhaps the 350th time he will
have done this procedure in the last
ten years.

The big bird struggles to stretch its
huge wings (average pelican wing-

span: seven and a half feet), but one
assistant hugs them shut as another
holds open the foot-long beak with its
menacing hook at the end and soft,
dangling pouch. First Albers meticu-
lously sews up the six-inch-long tear
from the inside of the pouch, stretch-
ing it between his ﬁngers. Then, with
the beak still held firmly agape, he
repeats the process on the outside.

The procedure is one he developed
in the late 1970s, when he noticed that
with the usual single layer of stitches
in a pelican’s pouch the wound didn’t
heal properly—when the sutures
came out, the tear reopened. Examin-
ing samples of the tissue under a
microscope, Albers discovered that it
is actually made up of two layers, each
of which must be repaired separately.

More than 1,000 birds of some 20
different species pass through Al-
bers’s caring hands every year. “He
spends as much time on a pigeon with
a cat bite as a pelican,” says Bev Gable,
a volunteer who has long worked with
him. But the brown pelican is his spe—
cialty. Most pelicans are brought in by
local people and volunteers licensed as
wildlife rescuers. Others come from
the nearby Suncoast Seabird Sanc—
tuary, which has the world’s largest
captive breeding program for peli-
cans. Albers is the sanctuary’s unpaid
veterinarian.

Pictured on the St. Petersburg city
seal and on souvenir coffee mugs, ash-
trays, T—shirts and dozens of other
souvenirs, the brown pelican is abun-
dant and popular in the area. A goofy-
looking creature on land, with its

it takes to the air. Swooping and glid-
ing over the water, it becomes an ele-
gant bird.

Two species of pelicans are native to
North America. The brown, the more
familiar of the two, is found mainly
along southern coasts and is noted for
dramatic dives for ﬁsh, sometimes
from as high as 30 feet. The white peli-
can does not dive for food but wades
and swims after it in shallow waters. It
breeds on inland lakes and winters on
the Gulf of Mexico.

The pelican has endured for mil-
lions of years—~in medieval times it
symbolized Christian charity. But in
the last few decades, man has been
anything but charitable to the crea-
ture. An “environmental barometer”
to Albers, the pelican ‘ warns us to
take care of our water, our soil—take
care of our resources, because we’re on

the verge of destroying them,” he says
grimly.

In the late 19503 and early 19603,
pesticides wreaked havoc with peli-
cans’ reproduction. In Louisiana,
where the pelican is the state bird, it
was virtually wiped out. And else-
where around the Gulf Coast, a boom
in the human population swallowed
up nesting sites in' the mangrove
swamps and intensified the competi—
tion between the birds and man for the
ﬁsh they both crave. In 1971, the peli-
can was placed on the list of endan-
gered species. By 1985, thanks to
efforts like Albers’s and those of the
Suncoast Seabird Sanctuary, the de-
signation was upgraded from endan-
gered to threatened. However, the
relationship with man is still the
birds’greatest danger.

One of the friendliest of wild birds, a
shameless panhandler, the pelican
hangs around ﬁshing piers and has
been known to march up and snatch a

fish right out of a hand. Such familiar—
ity gets the birds in trouble. They will
gulp fish still on hooks, entangle them-
selves in discarded ﬁshing line and
lunge for ﬁshing lures as they dive for
food. When a ﬁsherman hooks a peli-
can by mistake, all too often he simply
cuts the line and walks away, leaving it
dangling, the hook tearing the pouch.

About 85 percent of the birds Albers
sees have been hurt by fishing hooks or
lines. An X ray exhibited in his exam-
ining room shows a pelican with five
hooks imbedded in its pouch and
throat. “People just don’t understand
that wild birds have to be taken care of,
and you have to keep pounding it into
them,” he says. And he adds, sighing,
“I tend to be a bit of a grouch about
these things.”

Soft-spoken and reticent, Albers
shrugs when he is asked why he gives
so much time—weekends as well as
after-office hours—to helping pre-
serve wildlife. “1 just enjoy it,” he says.

“Others spend their free time playing
golf, but that’s not for me.” He also
gets a chance, he adds, to use his mind
creatively and try new ideas.

One of his most successful projects
has been worming the local pelican
population. For the last eight years,
several times each winter, he takes his
17-foot boat into the mangrove
swamps to feed to the nesting pelicans
ﬁsh in which he has hidden worming
medication. He manages in this clever
way to rid several thousand birds of
parasitic worms. “Then maybe we can
get an extra egg out of them,” he says.
“And if infection-free parents are
feeding the young, then maybe the
young won’t be so easily infected.”

Another project, which he set up a
few years ago with a local pathologist,
Dr. Ira Evans, is a study of the peli—
cans’ blood chemistry, The study es-
tablished a chemical baseline for
healthy pelicans’ blood, so that now,

when a sick bird comes along, there is

something to measure against. “Of-
ten,” says Albers, “when something
happens in the bird population, it’s an
indication that something has gone
awry in the environment. We have a
strong public-health relationship
with them.”

As president of the local Feed the
Pelican Fund, Albers speaks for the
special food needs of the pelicans in
the winter. “When the water tempera-
ture goes below 68, their food supply
moves into deeper waters,” be ex-
plains, “and they need our help.”
Volunteers arrive at the St. Pete pier
at 4 pm. every day from early January
to early March to throw hundreds of
fish to the hungry birds. At these feed-
ings, which attract hordes of tourists,
many of the injured birds Albers treats
are discovered and captured. “If it
weren’t for him,” says Sharon Moore,
one of the rescuers, “a lot of pelicans
out there wouldn’t survive.”

Before he came to Florida in 1971,
Albers soothed and tended cattle,
horses, pigs and sheep as a farm veter-
inarian in an Iowa town near Des
Moines and 20 miles from the farm he
grew up on. The closest he got to peli-
cans were chickens and turkeys and a
few hawks and owls. But he has always
been interested in wildlife. “1 can

held,” he says. “It was a thrill some-
thing like catching your first touch-
down pass. But my first eagle—that
was the Super Bowl.” He says he still
misses the closeness of a farm commu-
nity, where “your word and a hand-
shake are all you need to conduct the
business of the day,” and he goes back
to Iowa to check on the family proper-
ty at least once a year.

H Is LONG AND AVID interest in
photography, he thinks, may
have been the source of his intense
involvement with wildlife. Lining the
walls of the reception room of his ani-
mal hospital are photographs of birds,
polar bears he saw during several trips
to the Arctic (“Camping Out in Polar
Bear Country,” February 1987, de-
scribed one trip) and African fauna he
snapped on a 1968 vacation. The pic-
tures clearly inspire him. They are
reminders that “when you get away
from the office and you’re on a beach
or in a boat, or in the Arctic, you realize
that in nature you’ve found your
guidelines—you can’t control it, you
just have to bend with it.”

A fierce believer in practicing stew-
ardship over our natural resources,
Albers takes any opportunity he finds
to teach the lesson. To the manager of
the family farm in Iowa he fires off an
article about the need to plant trees to
cut down on wind erosion (“The chain
saw caused more damage to the land
than atom bombs ever will,” he rum-
bles) . Feedings at the pier become lec-
tures for visitors on how to remove a
fishhook from a bird’s pouch and the
hazards of the monofilament fishing
line to pelicans’ health. He recruits
high school students to help at the
feedings to instill in them an apprecia-
tion of wildlife that they may share
with their classmates.

“Taking care of the environment
can be simple,” Albers says, “if people
would just look around and see what
they’re doing and use common sense.
But you have to keep reminding them
all the time. People don’t like to bend
down and pick up their own soda can,
their own piece of plastic, but if they
would, at least they wouldn’t make
things worse.”

Once Albers’s philosophy of reha-
bilitating wildlife was not so widely
accepted as it is today. “The popular
thinking,” he says, “was that if wild
animals were sick, then they were

meant to die—even the endangered
and threatened species.” Others felt
that helping wild birds would only
turn them into some sort of pets with
no chance of ever again surviving in
the wild. “But,” says Albers with a
smile, “we proved them wrong and
changed opinion.”

According to Dr. Herbert Kale of
the Florida Audubon Society, Albers
was “one of the first to put his concern
for wildlife into actual practice.” At
Audubon workshops in the mid-
19703, he started out by teaching
people how to clean birds caught in oil
spills. And, says Kale, “he has had a
big impact professionally by getting
wildlife on the agenda of veterinary
associations.” Thanks to him and oth-
ers, veterinary schools are beginning
to add wildlife care to their curricula.

The National Wildlife Rehabilita-
tors Association, which Albers helped
found half a decade ago and on whose
board he sits, is a group he is particu-
larly proud of. From a few right-think-
ing people “basically sheltering ani—
mals in their backyards,” says Albers,
it has grown into a group with 600
members and a nationally recognized
clearinghouse for information on
wildlife rehabilitation.

AT HOME, A HOUSE on the Tampa
Bay waterfront, the only wild—
life is a collection of canaries, ﬁnches,
cockatiels and quail kept in three out-
door aviaries. His wife, Joanne, who
keeps the books at his clinic, is not
such a fancier of polar bears or peli-
cans as her husband, but they have a
champagne-colored standard poodle
named Evan. Their three children,
ages 3 to 18, are animal lovers, but they
pretty much leave the wildlife to the
expert in the family.
* * *

Albers’s work is done for this day. The
pelicans hurt by fishhooks, the blue
heron with its fractured leg and the
Louisiana heron with its injured eye
are packed up and taken to a volun-
teer’s backyard to recuperate from
their run-ins with man. Nature now
takes over to heal the birds, and soon
they will bend to its will again and soar
back into the wild. For a moment the
balance between man and wildlife, so
easily upset, will be re-established.

LIZABETH TERWILLIGER is in-

the chorus, the class follows

seen better days, makes a pass around
the circle of youngsters with help from
a small girl with blond ringlets. His
short ﬂight over, Mr. Hawk rejoins the
menagerie of scruffy, well-handled
creatures laid out in the parking lot of
Muir Beach, in the Golden Gate Na-
tional Recreation Area north of San
Francisco. The city’s ﬁnancial district
is only a half-hour away, but with the
green hills of Marin County to the east
and the azure Pacific to the west, the
city seems far removed. This is the
domain of Mr. Turkey Vulture and
Mr. Mole Crab‘and Mr. Limpet. And,
best of all, Mrs. T.

Dressed in her standard dungarees,
plaid wool shirt and straw hat, Terwil—
liger scurries over to a ratty black bird.
“Now paint your noses black, your
bodies black and your legs and feet
black and say ‘Hi, Mr. Raven,’ ” she
instructs. Just then, there is a raucous
cry above. “Ork, ork,” she calls back.
“Mr. Raven, Mr. Raven. We hear you.
Please come closer.” All heads scan
the sky, and suddenly the class cheers.
Two ravens swoop overhead, riding
the blustery winds that have kicked up
whitecaps on the Pacific. “Mr. Raven
looks like Mr. Crow, but we know him
by his call. Now hold up two fingers.”

calls. Then it is time for the beach-
walk. The stuffed birds and animals
are packed back into her faded blue

brood strung out behind her, their

squeals of delight carried back on the

out, announcing a find far down the
beach. “Something special!”

Mrs. T began conducting nature walks
about 30 years ago, to introduce her
own two children to the outdoors and
share her love of nature with them.
Later, as a favor to other parents, she
began to take their children with her

 

 

as well. Before long she found herself
leading trips six days a week. Ulti-
mately, it became her life’s work. In

‘ 1975, when Terwilliger was 66, long-

time admirers and supporters began
anticipating the day when she could
no longer lead trips. They created a
foundation, established the Terwillig-
er Nature Education Center, and
made films of her conducting expedi-
tions. But so far, Mrs. T shows no
signs of slowing down, and at 77 dis-
misses the idea of retiring. “There’s
too much left to do,” she says, incredu-
lous at the suggestion.

Six days a week, Mrs. T and her
assistants lead trips for adults and
children, sometimes in groups of up to
35; she is booked solid for months in
advance. On the seventh day, she
spends time with her husband, Cal-
vin—hiking, canoeing, bicycling.

The nature center, which began in
the home of one of the foundation’s
prime movers, now occupies part of an
unused elementary school in Corte
Madera. Each year, Terwilliger takes

 




 

 

about 6,000 students into the Marin
hills and wetlands, but the Center
reaches another 50,000 in 1 1 Bay-area
counties through its outreach pro-
grams and cadre of volunteer nature
guides. Millions of others have been
touched by the series of “Tripping
with Terwilliger” films, which are cir-
culated nationally.

Terwilliger’s nature walks require
stamina and sturdy legs, and grown
men have wilted on her canoe trips.
Yet Mrs. T’s reserves are so great that,
even after a full day of paddling, she
has energy left at night to hector a city
council about its plans to pave over a
salt marsh. A local environmental zea-
lot, she has lobbied to preserve every-
thing from tiny tide pools to miles of
coastline. Yet she lacks the stridency
of some environmentalists. A San
Francisco Chronicle reporter (whom
she outdistanced in a canoe) once
compared her to Katharine Hepburn
in “The African Queen”: “She’s got
the missionary spirit,” he said, “with-
out the astringence.”

In 1984, Mrs. T was one of 19 pe0ple
to receive a President’s Volunteer Ac-
tion Award. While waiting at the East
Gate before the ceremony, she passed
the time by picking up litter from the
White House lawn. White House offi-
cials warned her that the President’s
time was limited, but once onstage,
she seized the moment:

“This is my country,” she began,
urging everyone to repeat after her.

“This is my country,” came the
refrain. .

“Wherever I go . . .”

“Wherever I go . . .”

“I will leave it more beautiful than
when I found it.”

 

 

Having captured her audience’s at-
tention, she decided to try a few bird-
ﬂight patterns. “V is for vulture,” she
cooed, arms raised overhead. Soon she
had everyone—Ronald Reagan in-
cluded—imitating Mr. Turkey Vul-
ture, Mr. Seagull and Mr. Ruddy
Duck. Reagan was thoroughly
charmed. Afterwards, Mrs. T una-
bashedly gave him a hug and akiss.

Such is Terwilliger’s power to in-
spire and delight. The entire nature-
study program at the center has been
built on volunteerism, and more than
100 guides donate time. “Most of them
are mothers of young children or reti-
rees who feel they still have something
to give,” says Cynda Abbott, the cen-
ter’s education director. “One mother
suffering from stress was told to get
out and see something besides diapers
and laundry. She went out with Mrs. T
and was so inspired that she went on to
get a degree in ornithology.”

Abbott herself gave up a job teach-
ing nursery school to join Terwilliger,
in 1979. “The children regarded her as
Santa Claus,” she explains. “I became
interested in natural history and saw
the value of her kind of teaching. It’s
not passive. It’s very joyous. You can’t
be with Mrs. T and not feel joyous. She
can make even the rainiest day seem
like a fantastic event. I don’t know
how many times I’ve heard people say,
‘Just as we got out of our car, the sun
came out.’ Even when the clouds don’t
part for her, she’ll just find a tree and
they all have a marvelous time.”

Mrs. T’s “verbal-visual-tactile”
teaching methods have been codified
by the nature center and are taught
there to prospective guides in an
intensive 12-week course. The curric-

lSOd NOISNIHSVM 3H1/NOlSNHOF XNVEH

'ulum explores the natural history of

Marin County’s diverse habitats—-
bays, salt- and freshwater marshes,
redwood forests, grasslands, oak
woodlands and mountains—but it
also translates the biology into terms
that children can absorb. “That’s
where Mrs. T’s magic comes in,” says
Abbott. “She seems to have found
something in each species that the
children can identify with.”

A deer browse-line becomes a deer
snack bar,” columbines are “fairies’
costumes,” a shelf fungus is “Mother
Nature’s blackboard.” Summoning
her charges to see the fungus, which
grows on tree trunks, Terwilliger low-
ers her voice to a conspiratorial whis-
per and explains, “This is where the
elves come out to dance, so we’ll leave
them a greeting.” Using a twig she
traces “Hi” on the pale underside of
the fungus. “When we come back next
week,” she exclaims, her eyes gleam-
ing, “the message will be gone.”

Terwilliger’s technique also relies
heavily on physical play. “When we
imitate, we remember,” she says;
Thus a lesson about poison oak in-
volves a “finger play”: “Everyone hold
up three fingers,” she says. “That’s
how many leaves poison oak has. Now
paint your fingers green, now red, now
shake off all the leaves but curl your
fingers. That’s what poison oak looks
like during the winter, and it is just as .
poisonous then as with leaves.”

Though some naturalists may criti-
cize her approach—giving animals
proper names, having children pre-
tend they are vultures—as overly an-
thropomorphic , others wholehearted—
ly endorse it. “Her infectious enthu-
siasm for children and the natural
world has had a greater impact on the
youth of Marin County than anything
else I know,” says Richard Martyr, a
senior vice president of the National
Audubon Society, an organization
noted for its strong commitment to
environmental education. “We direct
people who want to reach their com-
munities to her all the time.”

Mrs. T’s own interest in the natural
world stems from her upbringing on a
sugar plantation in Hawaii, although
some might say it is in her blood; she is
related to Kit Carson, Daniel Boone
and James Fenimore Cooper. She was
born a Carson, descendant of Kit Car-
son’s brother—but doesn’t know
quite how she’s related to the others,

lore.”To avoid chores asachild,Eliza—
beth Carson would escape to the out-
doors, playing on the beach or sliding
down hills on broad-leafed tropical
foliage. Her mother, a strict, religious
woman, forced Elizabeth into major-
ing in home economics at the Univer-
sity of Hawaii. After graduating, Eli-
zabeth came to live in Massachusetts
with her brother, an orthopedic sur-
geon like her father. There, she hiked
through New England, sleeping in
youth hostels or sheep sheds.

During the Depression, she lived in
New York City in a 10-foot—square
room. “I heated my food on an iron,
and my only view was of the sun and
the moon,” she recalls. At her moth-
er’s urging, she studied institutional
management at Columbia University,
aiming for a career in hospital admin-
istration. Instead, she switched to
nursing and moved to California to
attend Stanford. There she met her
future husband, Calvin Terwilliger,
who was in medical school.

“Neither of us had any money
then,” she says, “but we’d take long
walks in Golden Gate Park and once in
awhile we’d have enough to rentbikes.
One time, we rode all the way across
the Golden Gate Bridge.”

Years later, when she was refused
permission to make the same crossing,
she began a crusade for bike lanes on
the bridge. Now cyclists can cross the
span and connect with an extensive
system of bicycle paths, for which

she also campaigned.

During those early yearsin Califor-
nia, there was time for camping trips
to Yosemite Park. But later, with a
young family to raise and Calvin a
prisoner of his growing practice, she
needed a place to take her young son
and daughter. “You have this tiny lit-
tle house and tiny little yard. Where do
you go with your children? Well, we
created the parks. But what good are
parks if children are afraid of the out-
doors?” she asks. Thus began her
commitment to nature education.
“Knowledge dispels fear,” she says.

Today, her children are grown and
have moved out. But she and Calvin,
who retired two years ago, are hardly
empty-nesters. Indeed, the nest, a
1907 cottage under the redwoods in
bucolic Mill Valley, is stuffed with
artifacts and mementos. The sheer
volume of clutter is astonishing. One
room seems given over to old tissue
boxes (“wonderful toy trains for the
children”), toilet paper rollers (“taped
together, they make field glasses”),
and her substantial collection of straw
hats. In another room, the drawers of a
large chest are crammed with odd
socks, odd mittens and gloves, and
thank-you posters painted on con-

struction paper. She caresses the sur- ‘

face of one primitive landscape. “I
can’t just throw them away,” she con-
fesses.

Her office occupies one cornerofthe
kitchen. Above her desk is a cobweb
stunning in its size and complexity.
“It’s Mother Nature’s moth trap and
ﬂy catcher,” she says, blowing up at
the dusty strands. “And they move,
too!” Never one for housework, she
says, “You’ll never remember staying
home to wash windows or scrub the
ﬂoors. If you go outdoors you’ll never
forget what you saw.”

The collection of stuff is so exten-
sive that it has spilled out of the house
to occupy every outbuilding as well.
Calvin’s shop contains so many tools
that there is barely room to work. A
streamlined ’40s—erahouse trailer that
clearly has ﬁnished its last journey
now serves as another repository. In
the garage, along with the canoe pad-
dles and lifejackets, is a stuffed os-
trich, donated by the local natural his-
tory museum. The freezer contains a
loon,afox and an owl awaitingthe tax-
idermist. “People find them on the
road and leave them on the doorstep,”
Mrs. T says with a shrug.

‘- " va-

After a tour, Mrs. T offers dinner.
Over a healthful meal of turkey drum-
sticks, rice and salad she reﬂects on
her career and the rewards it has pro-
vided. “No matter where I go, some-
one is always saying, ‘Hello, Mrs.
Tl,’ ” she says. “Children come up and
hold my hand and say, ‘You’re the lady
with the hat.’ It’s marvelous.”

There is also a sense of accomplish-
ment at having helped to save the
county’s natural assets, though she is
loath to boast about the mark she has
left. Asked about her favorite bike
routes and canoe trips, she sifts
through her office and returns with a
county map. Poring over it, she cannot
help but reminisce about her various
victories—a bike path here, a state
park there. Does she ever worry about
the state of the planet? “Why, no,” she
says bluntly. “It’s just too big. You do
your own little thing in your area.”

Apart from her tangible legacy,
Mrs. T’s work has had an intangible
ripple effect. For 30 years, she has
gathered children into a circle and told
them, “You are the teachers of oth—
ers.” Each of these alumni—and there
are thousands—has become a steward
of the environment. Dr. Michael
Franzblau, a dermatologist who took
his first walk with Mrs. T in 1953,
compares herto Rachel Carson,whose
book “The Silent Spring” alerted a
generation to the dangers of pesti-
cides. “She has sensitized so many
people to the importance of nature,”
he said. “She is a national treasure.”

Following the day at Muir Beach,
Mrs. T leads her charges on a quick
tour of a nearby woods. When the class
has been dismissed, she asks a visitor,
“Do you have a moment?” She knows
a secret spot. In a light drizzle, she
heads down an old logging road, stop-
ping now and then to study a forest
creature or taste a bit of miner’s let'-
tuce. “Listen,” she says. There is only
the tinkling of a creek andthe patter of
a light rain. Mrs. T’s eyes are closed,
her nut-brown face turned upwards.
She is smiling beatifically. “No sirens,
no barking dogs.” A quail calls. “Mr.
Quail. Qua-quer-ko. Where are you?
We are your friends.” Then she turns
and bustles away. From around the
bend comes the call: “Something spe-
cial. Now, something special.”

Dear Mrs. Yarbrough:

Because of your concern for the humane treatment of animals, I
thou ght you would be interested to know that the House approved
legislation June 25th that prohibits the Department of Interior's
Bureau of Land Management from killing wild hOrses and burros
roaming in the southwest United States.

This provision was included in the Fiscal Year 1988 Interior
Appropriations Bill, which was approved by my Committee June
18th. As you know, I have cosponsored legislation in previous
Congresses to prohibit the killing of these animals living on
public lands. The Interior Appropriations Bill will be
considered by the Senate later this summer, and you can be sure
that I will work to see that this provision remains a part of the
legislation.

With best wishes and personal regards, I am

Mrs. Constance F. Yarborough
3149 King Arthur Court, N.E.
Atlanta, GA 30345

Dear Mrs. Yarborough:

Thank you for your letter to The Humane Society
of the United States (HSUS) concerning the
disposition of zoo animals.

I would first like to state that The HSUS does
not believe that surplus zoo animals should be sold
or turned over to biomedical research
laboratories. I want to ensure you that Dr. Fox
shares these feelings. I have enclosed a xerox copy
of the HSUS Statement of Policy on zoos as well as
our Captive Wildlife pamphlet.

In reference to the Friends of Zoo Atlanta
organization, I would encourage you to remain a
member. This organization enables private
individuals to make an impact on the direction that
a zoo will take in_the future.

The statement by the United Action for Animals,
Inc., that you enclosed for us concerns a bill that
is extremely outdated and was never acted on and
eventually died. To clarify the position we took at
this time, I will quote from the testimony of Mr.
John Hoyt, President of The Humane Society of the
United States to the Subcommittee on the Smithsonian
Institution of the Committee on Rules and
Administration:

 




Mrs. Constance Yarborough
June 19, 1987
Page two

"Also of critical concern is the definition of acceptable
zoo research as it appears in Sec. 4(a)(2). As written, this
section may be misinterpreted as permitting the diversion of
funds into extraneous biomedical research and testing
projects. It is the vagueness of this section which prevented
consideration of a similar measure in the 92nd Congress and
may again threaten enactment of so important a reform. Let it
be stated clearly and without ambiguity that the research
intended by this bill is uniquely and solely for the welfare
and benefit of the zoo animals themselves, and that when such
research is deemed appropriate and necessary, it shall be
performed under the most rigid standards of humaneness. If
perchance, anything broader than this is implied by the term
research, as some fear may be, The HSUS wishes to register its
objection in the strongest possible terms."

Many major zoological parks engage in valuable endangered
and threatened breeding studies and ethological (animal
behavior) studies, both in the field and in captivity. This
type of work is very important to modern zoological parks and
is encouraged by The HSUS.

We appreciate your taking the time to write us about your
concerns and your support of our effort to provide protection
to all animals. If there is any way we may be of assistance
to you in this or any other animal welfare issue, I hope you
will contact us.

Sincerely yours,

HSUS Investigates Zoos

Unlike dogs and cats, which
have become accustomed to liv-
ing in the company of human
beings for thousands of years,
wild animals have very special
needs that are not easily or inex-
pensively met in captivity. When
the complex physiological,
social, and behavibral needs of
wild animals are not met, they
can suffer just as much as if
they were the victims of
deiiberate abuse.

Since the creation of its Wild-
life Department in 1971, The
HSUS has investigated the con-
ditions under which wild ani-
mals are kept in hundreds of
zoos, menageries, and even pri—
vate homes across the country.
The HSUS believes that wildlife,
having a vital role to play in the
maintenance of Nature’s balance,
is far too valuable to be con-
demned to languish in squalid
“roadside” menageries; under—
funded and understaffed city
“zoos ’ ’ —started by accident
and continued without thought-
ful planning; or in the hands of
misguided egotists who try vain-
ly to make “pets” of them.

§

Roadside Zoos and
Menageries

Among the worst examples of
these prisons for wildlife are
those pathetic exhibits found ad-
jacent to commercial enterprises
such as gas stations and gift
shops. The owners of these es-
tablishments, capitalizing upon
the public’s natural curiosity
about animals, keep a few wild
creatures caged under the most
minimal of conditions as a
“hook” to attract paying

 

 

customers. They seem neither to
know nor care that bears need
more than a diet of cola drinks
and popcorn to survive, or that
foxes, raccoons, or lions require
more meaningful activity than
pacing constantly in a filthy
cage scarcely twice their length.

Equally sordid are the menag-
eries, mistakenly called “zoos,”
found in the midst of cities
whose governing bodies are too
apathetic to care that the
modern zoological garden has
evolved far beyond the medieval
sterile cage housing a lethargic,
overfed tiger and bearing only a
simple sign labled Panthera'
tigris tigris. Such displays do
nothing to inspire in the zoo-
going public an appreciation for
these magnificent creatures or
concern for their preservation in
the wild. Visitors to such ex-
hibits, particularly children,
develop false and negative im-
pressions about them, and are
inspired by the prison-like set-
ting to feel only pity, or worse,
to commit acts of vandalism
upon the captive beasts.

Zoological Parks

The HSUS recognizes the val-
uable contribution to our cul-
ture of professional zoological
parks, both municipal and com-
mercial, which attempt to house
animals in naturalistic surround-
ings and enlighten the visiting
public to the important role that
all creatures play in their eco-
systems. Because of vanishing
habitats, some may even be the
last bastion for endangered
species. But without trained pro-
fessional staff members, com-
munity support, and a strong
commitment to education, con-
servation, and the welfare of its
animals, the so-called “zoo” is

 

really only a menagerie: a ran-
dom collection of imprisoned
wildlife, serving no purpose and
benefiting no one, least of all
the animals.

Federal Legislation
Protecting Zoo Animals

When the Federal Laboratory
Animal Welfare Act was amend- f
ed in 1970 to require exhibitors
of wild animals to meet speci-
fied minimum standards, The
HSUS and other animal welfare
groups, Congress, and the gen-
eral public all believed this im-
portant piece of legislation
would result in the closure of
most of the sordid roadside
menageries and the dramatic im-
provement of sub-standard mu—
nicipal zoos. But because of the
US. Department of Agriculture’s
uneven and frequently lax en-
forcement of the Act, these re-
pulsive exhibits persist; with the
added reinforcement of what
appears to be government ap-
proval!

The HSUS has often found
itself locked in public debate
with USDA’s veterinary inspec-
tors who seem to be interpreting
the Act’s vaguely worded provi-
sions for the convenience of the
exhibit owners rather than for
the welfare of the animals.
Where USDA has taken action,
conditions fOr wild animals have
improved. But strong, decisive
action on the part of USDA is,
unfortunately, infrequent.

Captive wild creatures will
continue to suffer as long as
there are USDA inspectors who
believe that the Act’s provision
requiring animals to be able to
make “social and postural
adjustments” means only that

 

 




Zoos

The Humane Society of the
United States believes that under most circumstances wild
animals should be permitted to exist undisturbed in their
natural environments. To a considerable extent, zoos violate
that right, frequently resulting in abuse, neglect, suffering,
and death of animals. Consequently, The HSUS cannot
condone the capture and confinement of animals from the
wild for use in 2005, except for necessary propagation of
endangered species.

However, The HSUS recognizes
the widespread existence of zoos and acknowledges that
some serve demonstrable purposes for the long-term bene—
fit of animals, such as:

-—Preservation and restoration of endangered or threat-
ened species.

-—Education of people to the needs of wild animals and
their role in ecosystems.

In order to justify their ex-
istence, zoos must serve such purposes, must maintain
animals in conditions simulating their natural habitats as
closely as possible, and must treat them with the highest
degree of humaneness, care, and professionalism.

' The HSUS believes it is ex-
tremely important that these requirements be met not only
for the welfare of the animals but also because inhumane
or inappropriate conditions viewed by an impressionable
public provide a negative learning experience by seeming
to condone indifference or cruelty.

Unfortunately, few zoos ap-
proach these standards at the present time; some, in fact,
make no attempt to do so, especially so—called ”roadside”
2005 or menageries. This category of zoo is a permanently
substandard menagerie whose primary purpose often is to
attract people to other facilities such as diners, gift shops,
or motels. Even municipally operated zoos may be so in-
ferior as to be nothing more than their roadside counter-
parts. The HSUS pledges itself to work with those zoologi-
cal parks and other zoos desiring to improve and having the
capability to do so, but it is committed to the eradication
of those that will not or cannot improve.

an animal must have enough
space to be able to sit, stand,
and turn around. .

Since 1971, The HSUS has
played the major animal welfare
role in the movement to im-
prove our nation’s zoos. While
the good zoos appear to be get-
ting even better, the mediocre
ones still have far to go, and the
menageries at the bottom of the
scale are still conducting busi-
ness as usual. The HSUS, while
encouraging the continued im-
provement of zoos, is commit-
ted to the eradication of all
menageries, both public and
private, and to the elimination
of the cruel practice of keeping
wild creatures as pets. But your
help is needed!

What Can You Do?

Let USDA know of bad con—
ditions you find in both public
and private menageries. Urge
your congressmen and senators
to insure that USDA strictly en—
forces the Animal Welfare Act
to put menageries out of busi-
ness. Let them know you believe
that wild animals should only be
exhibited for purposes of educa-
tion and only in circumstances
where their normal needs can be
met.

Urge your state legislators and
municipal officials to support
laws and ordinances prohibiting

Help

depen

 

the cruel and often dangerous
practice of keeping wild animals
as pets. Do not patronize road-
side menageries and urge your
friends to do likewise.

Visit your local zoo. If it is
truly a zoo with professionally
trained staff members, it will be
working to transform its anti-
quated enclosures into naturalis-
tic’, educational exhibits. The
good zoo is worthy of your sup-
port and probably has a

zoological society through which

you can work to insure that it
remainsan institution of higher
learning. But if your zoo is
merely a menagerie, let the
governing body know that a
mere prison for wildlife serves
no purpose in your community
and should be closed. To help
you determine whether your zoo
is a professional zoo or a mere
menagerie, consult the checklist
below.

Checklist for Zoo
Visitors

V Did you learn anything
about wildlife or its habitat
from your visit?

V Were the exhibits and
grounds clean? Did the animals
appear clean and healthy?

V Were the exhibits interesting
and did the animals have oppor-
tunities for activity (i.e., could

 

climbing animals climb and
swimming animals swim)?

V Did the animals have places
to hide from view in their exhib-
its, or were they constantly ex-
posed to public scrutiny?

V Were there keepers or other
zoo staff members or volunteer
workers close by to answer your
questions and insure that visi-
tors did nothing to harm the
animals? Did they seem knowl-
edgeable and concerned about
the animals?

V Are there 24-hour security
guards or a high fence enclosing
the entire zoo to protect the
animals from vandals when the
zoo is closed?

V What percentage of the zoo
is made up of old-fashioned
barred, sterile cages?

V Are there plans to modernize
outmoded exhibits to make
them more naturalistic and pro-
vide the animals with more op-
portunities for activity? In what
period of time will these changes
be made?

V Does the zoo provide special
educational programs for visi-
tors who wish to learn more
about animals?

V Is there a zoological society
you can join to help see that im-
provements are made and edu-
cational programs are developed?

US Help the AnimalS. Animals cannot help themselves —— they must

on people who care to fight for them. The Humane Society of the United States represents

more than 100,000 people who care. The HSUS fights for animals through educational, legislative,

investigative and legal means.

Millions of dogs and cats are suffering as homeless, unwanted strays. Farm animals are being sub-
jected to cruel modern farming methods. In research laboratories, animals are used and abused in
painful experiments which are too often badly planned and pointless. Dozens of wild animals are on
the brink of extinction in America because of habitat destruction, hunting, trapping, pollution, and

other intrusions of man.

The HSUS is committed to the goal of ending animal suffering. It has more programs than any
other animal welfare organization, working to protect pet and domestic animals as well as wildlife.

HSUS is a non-profit organization supported solely by the contributions of individuals like you.
Money donated is put into action on the front line right away. The animals need us now.

OUTH AFRICA is still a nature lover’s paradise

with more than 400 mammal species and some
850 various types of birds to be found in the country.
The Republic boasts 24 000 plant species, more than
the number growing in Russia and considerably more
than species in America, seven times the size of
South Africa. In the Cape Peninsula alone, an area of
500 kmz, 2 600 flowering plants grow, more than the
species in the British isles as well as in South Austra-
lia.

For many decades South Africans have taken their
wildlife opulence for granted, but the extinction of the
quagga, Equus quagga, the blue buck, Hippotragus
leucophaeus, and the Egyptian vulture, Neophron per-
cnopterus, has brought the realisation that other
species are also endangered. Today, experts agree
South Africa is among the leaders in the field of con-
servation. Not only are government and national and
provincial bodies increasingly involved in nature con-
servation but also the man in the street. Proof lies in
the growing number of game farms established by
farmers in areas such as the North-Western Trans-
vaal and the ever increasing environmental compe-

At least two new national parks have been pro-
claimed in the past year — the Zuurberg in the Win-

portant part in establishing the Tembe Elephant Park
in Tongaland, KwaZulu, ensuring the survival of some
100 elephants which up to last year roamed the re-
gion freely.

Dozens of organisations have been established to
conserve South. Africa’s fauna and flora, the best
known being the SA Nature Foundation, the Wildlife

According to the South African Red Data Book —
Mammals there are four endangered mammal species
in South Africa — the wild dog, Lycaon picfus, the
black rhino, Diceros bicomis, roan antelope, Hippotra-
gus equinus, and the riverine rabbit, Bunolagus monfi-
cularis. Birds in danger of becoming extinct are the
blue swallow, Hirundo atrocaerulea, the wattled crane,
Grus carunculata, the roseate tern, Sterna dougallii,
and the blackriamped buttonquail, Turnix hottenfotta.

if proper measures are not introduced names of
animals such as the honey badger, Mellivora capen-
sis, the oribi, Ourebia ourebi, sable antelope, Hippo-
tragus niger, the suni, Nesotragus moschatus, and the
pangolin, Manis temminckii, may also be included in
the list of endangered species.

The Endangered Wildlife Trust’s most important
task is research on endangered or vulnerable species.
it also introduces measures to ensure endangered
species do not become extinct. Furthermore, the Trust

educates the general public on the importance ,of the -

preservation of ecosystems, not only for the survival
of wildlife but, above all, for the well-being of mankind.
The Trust was founded in 1973 by Clive Walker, re-

nowned wildlife artist, one-time game hunter and
ranger. it started at a symposium in America where he
met the painter David Shepherd who had painted a
limited edition of a tiger picture, and raised thousands
of rands for the World Wildlife Fund. Back in South
Africa, Mr Walker painted a picture of two Cheetahs, of
which the numbers, at that time, were very low. The
royalties of R6 000, raised by sales of the limited edi-
tion of this painting, were used to sponsor the Trust’s
first project. In collaboration with the Eugene Marais
Chair of Wildlife Management at the University of Pre-

toria, a habitat study was launched on the status of
the cheetah in the Etosha National Park in South
West Africa/Namibia. .

The Trust has since undertaken various other chee-
tah projects, for example the translocation of 12 chee-
tahs to the Klaserie Private Nature Reserve in North-
Eastern Transvaal, and assisted in translocating ﬁve
cheetahs from South West Africa/Namibia to the Pila-
nesberg National Park near Sun City in Bophutha-
tswana. The Trust now concentrates its support on
cheetah research at De Wildt Cheetah Research and
Breeding Centre near Pretoria.

The second research project in which the Trust be-
came involved was the conservation of the brown
hyaena, Hyaena brunnea, in the Kalahari Gemsbok
National Park. Radio-telemetry equipment was spon-
sored to aid night tracing of the animal.

Dr John Ledger, director of the Trust since March
1985, when Mr Walker stepped down, is of the opin-
ion the vulture study group and the rhino and elephant
conservation project launched in the Kaokoveld in
South West Africa/Namibia have so far been the most
successful.

The vulture study group is a working group of the
Trust which attempts to create an awareness among
farmers of the importance of vultures in the ecology.
Due to a misconception among farmers that Cape vul-
tures, Gyps coprptheres, prey on lambs, they poison
or shoot these birds. Cape vultures, which are endem-
ic to South Africa, are classified as vulnerable to ex-
tinction. A booklet distributed by the group stresses
the dangers of indiscriminate poisoning and provides
advice on how farmers may conserve vulture colo-
nies. '

Dr Ledger said one of the most important achieve-
ments of the Trust and the vulture’study group had
been the involvement of Escom (the country’s chief

years ago it was found that large numbers of Cape
vultures were electrocuted when they attempted to
perch on pylons of a particular design. Escom ap-
pointed a bird research committee whose recommen-
dations led to the ﬁtting of special perches at more
than 400 pylons.

When elephant and rhino populations of the Kaoko-
veld started to decline sharply due to increased
poaching in that magnificent desert region, the Trust
began aerial surveys to monitor herd movements.
Auxiliary game scouts were appointed to limit poach-
ing. So far, eight scouts have been recruited from the
local population and the result has been a decline in
illegal hunting.

The Trust has been involved in various other rhino
projects. In collaboration with the Natal Parks Board
eight black rhinos have been translocated to the
Kruger National Park and 80 white rhinos, Ceratothe-
n’um simun, introduced to the Pilanesberg National
Park, in conjunction with the SA Nature Foundation
and the Wildlife Society.

With regard to elephants, valuable data has been

obtained by the Trust with habitat studies of elephants
in areas as far afield as the Northern Tuli Block, in Bo-
tswana. Dr Ledger says the Trust’s activities in neigh-
bouring countries are of great importance as game
criss-cross the borders and without conservation in
countries such as Zimbabwe, Botswana and Swazi-
land, the Republic’s efforts will be fruitless. South Afri-
ca gladly shares its expertise in this field with its
neighbours.

The Trust has also been involved in elephant re-
search in the Addo Elephant Park in the Eastern Cape
and the Klaserie and Timbavati Private Nature He-
serves, which border on the Kruger National Park.
The Trust has pledged its support to the Rhino and
Elephant Foundation recently established for the con-
servation of these wonderful animals of Africa.

A large variety of wildlife studies are implemented
in Southern Africa each year. The Endangered Wild-
life Trust has contributed to a project on the suni (a

teles cristatus, of which there are many misconcep-
tions, and the resettlement of 43 yellow-billed oxpeck-
ers, Buphagus afn'canus, in the Umfolozi Game
Reserve in Northern Natal where they had become
extinct. Research has also been done on the bottle-
nosed dolphin, Tursiops aduncus, of which many are
killed in shark-nets on the Natal coast every year.

The blue swallow is considered South Africa’s most
endangered breeding bird species. Research has
shown that these birds are restricted to montane
grasslands and that their habitats are threatened by
roads and forestry. The Trust is hoping that their find-
ings and recommendations will save the birds' nests.
Studies were undertaken on the breeding-grounds of
the roseate tern and the jackass penguin, Spheniscus
demersus, while recommendations were also made
on the conservation of these areas so as to ensure
the survival of both species.

The Trust supports the Botanical Society of South
Africa by way of funding for field guides to make
pe0ple aware of the wonder of the Cape floral king-
dom. The Southern and South-Western Cape where

28 SOUTH AFRICAN PANORAMA APRlL 1987

the so-called fynbos grows, is one of six recognised
botanical kingdoms in the world —— as many as 121
species have been counted in an area of 100 kmz.
Because of agricultural and other development only
some 40 per cent of the original 46 000 km2 of natural
vegetation has survived and if measures are not im-
plemented some of the species will vanish.

An intensive programme to save the roan antelope
is presently being conducted by the Trust, the Trans-
vaal Division of Nature Conservation, the Mammal
Research Institute, of the University of Pretoria, and a
pharmaceutical company. A number of these animals
have been sent for protection to Lapalala Wilderness,
a private nature reserve in North-Westem Transvaal.

Trust’s sister organisation, the Wilderness Trust of
Southern Africa, undertakes its main function, namely
that of education. The Wilderness Trust, another

brain-child of Mr Walker, educates the youth in en-
vironmental conservation. Youth groups of all races
visit the Lapalala Wilderness School’s- field study
centre where they are trained in veldcraft and taught
the importance of conservation. Mr Walker also or»
ganises a series of educational tours for adults to wil-
derness areas in Southern Africa.

He regards collaboration with the South African De-
fence Force in preserving the fauna and flora in the
military's operational areas as one of the milestones
in the Trust’s history. This has led to the establish-
ment of the Endangered Wildlife Trust’s floating tro-
phy for conservation in the Defence Force. The
Hoedspruit Air Force Base, in Eastern Transvaal, the
Pietersburg Air Force Base and the Boekenhoutskloof
Military Base, near Pretoria, have been all recipients
of this sought-after trophy for their exceptional wildlife
conservation programmes.

In support of the world conservation strategy under
the guidance of the International Union for the Con-
servation of Nature and Natural Resources
(lUCN), of which the Trust is a member, it established
the Statesman Award in 1982. President Lucas Mang-

ope of Bophuthatswana was the first person to re-
ceive the statuette for his part in his country’s success
in nature conservation. Ian Player, the well-known
naturalist, was the second recipient of this award.

This year, the Trust is to launch research projects
on the pangolin, large bustards of the Karoo and other
vulnerable and endangered species. The Trust re-
cently received an Egyptian vulture from England
which it donated to the Johannesburg zoo in the hope
that it would makepeople aware of the true meaning
of its motto: Extinction is Forever. After all, nature
conservation is an act of man to ensure his own
survival. ' D

HIS IS A weather story. It is a

story about lightning flashing
in the sky, ominous black clouds
heavy with rain and 1,670 people
dressed in dinner jackets and party
dresses and toting umbrellas who ',
attended the outdoors, every-others '
year Zoofari. ' »

Everyone knows, by this time,
that we have been suffering from a
long dry spell just when the crops
most need moisture. Even the
sturdy soybean has been
endangered. In town, lawns and
gardens have been drying up, and
people are beginning to worry
about their trees.

So at 2 pm. Friday, June 19,
everyone should have been happy
when the rains came. Right?

The Zoofari committee was
trying to put the last-minute
touches on the largest benefit
dinner party ever held in St. Louis.
The tables had been laid with crisp
cloths and spottless cutlery and
glassware; the Lazy Suzan caterer’s
staff, which had flown in its Kansas
City staff to join the St. Louis staff
to handle the big, sit-down supper,
was busy preparing food in two
outdoor kitchens.

“At 4 p.m.. we had a
conference call with Roger Birkel
and Anne de Rogier of the Zoo,
Judy Hlnrichs, president of the
Friends of the Zoo, Joan
Quicksilver, who was handling
public relations, and Abby
McCarthy, who was in charge of
arrangements, to decide what our
strategy would be —- and whether
or not to cancel the party,” said
Chris Chadwick, co-chairwoman of
the party with Robert Stupp and
Carole Perkins, honorary
chairwoman. “l was optimistic. So
many people were so excited about
this party that I thought that they
would be willing to come anyway
and bring umbrellas. We had been
sold out for more than a month
before the party, and that was even
with our taking 400 more guests

when the last Zoofari was held.”

So they called radio stations and
announced that Zoofari was still on,
announcements that were aired in
the midst of a deluge.

The Friends of the 200 had a lot
riding on the party. Dub Jones.
president of Purlna Mills, with
headquarters at US. Highway 40
and Hanley Road and a division of
British Petroleum, had wanted to
get the message across that Purlna
Mills was not part of Raiston
Purlna but a new, independent
company (albeit with the familiar

' checkerboard logo) and had

underwritten the party at $100,000.
Stupp and his committee had lined
up ll patrons at $2,500 each, 68
individual and corporate sponsors

' who took tables for 10, plus a

thousand more tickets sold at 8125
per person. No small change
involved here.

The party’s theme was "Such
Stuff As Streams Are Made Of," a
pun on Shakespeare and the
beneficiary of the party. the

By 5 pm, the rain had stopped.

TRAVEL-HOLIDAY - July 1987

Zoo Tours

 

' lorenz Ziegfeld once equated

i- elephants with good fortune.

I recalled this as I sat under a

hot midmorning sun in a bleacher

beside a small grass airﬁeld in east-

central Thailand. I ﬁgured that if

the legendary theatrical producer

was right, I was in for a dramatic

dose of good luck. For on the ﬁeld

in front of me and other camera-

toting farangs, or foreigners, about

100 elephants were trampling the
ground in a grand-scale rodeo.

The annual Elephant Round—
Up, held on a mid-November
weekend in Surin, Thailand,
brings together the single largest
assemblage of tame elephants in
the world—close to 150 animals—
onto a space scarcely larger than a
professional football ﬁeld. To the
delight of elephant aficionadOs
from around the world, these dex-
terous domestics play soccer, run
relay races and engage in a game of
tug of war with the Thai Army (100
soldiers versus one adult male
“tusker”). The grand ﬁnale—a
historic battle re-enactment, com-
plete with foot soldiers, ﬁreworks
and elephants colorfully clad for
battle—is the kind of spectacle that
would have made the great
Ziegfeld proud.

This unusual event is the main
attraction of a program organized
by the Washington Park Zoo in
Portland, Oregon. It is one of a
new breed of specialty tour pack—
ages called “zoo tours” that are
gaining popularity with amateur
naturalists across the United
States. Over the past three years,
this particular trip to Thailand has

by David G. Gordon

attracted a mixed bag of zoo keep-

, ers, animal trainers, zoo docents

and volunteers, artists, photogra-
phers and a few adventure travel
lovers like myself.

Such specialty tours give the
curious a chance to share shoulder—
to-shoulder with professional zoo
staffs and ﬁeld biologists, the joy of
exotic exploration. Participants
gain an in-depth understanding of
the world’s ecosystems, observe
the lifestyles of a particular group
of animals ﬁrsthand and View rare
or endangered animals in their
natural habitats. Zoo workers say
these programs also sensitize peo-
ple to real conservation issues in
the world.

For zoos and aquariums, such
tours provide an enjoyable way to
educate the zoo-going public.
They often give zoo staffs the
chance to establish professional
contacts at foreign zoos, paving the

way for cooperative projects or.

animal trades. At the same time,
the tour’s sponsoring institutions
can gain ﬁnancial support; dona-
tions are often included as part of
the zoo-tour package.

Today, nearly every major ani-
mal park offers its own schedule of
specialty expeditions. The New
York Zoological Society, the Oin-
cinnati Zoo, the New England
Aquarium, the San Diego Zoologi—
cal Society, Chicago’s Brookﬁeld
Zoo and the Arizona Sonora Des-
ert Museum all host several excur-
sions into the wilds each year.

One organization, the Zoo and
Aquarium Travel Association
(ZATA) of Birmingham, Ala—

bama, coordinates the itineraries
of more than 70 zoos across Amer-
ica. ZATA outﬁts a year’s worth of
excursions, publishes its own sup-
port textbooks and provides its
own trained staff of biologists to
assist tour guides and escorts.
The nonprofit organization
Members Aﬁeld of Seattle, Wash-
ington, assists aquariums, botani-
cal gardens and zoos in organizing
expeditions to Central and South
America, Australia and, this year,
to the previously inaccessible wild-
life preserves of China.
Zoo-sponsored tours often
structure their itineraries around a
particular animal species or a
unique habitat. ZATA’s Thailand
program, for example, concen-
trates on the Asian elephant. The
program’s fast-paced schedule
consists of visits to Thai zoos, ele-
phant shows and even a govern-
ment-run elephant training center,
where 2,000—pound calves are
taught the skills needed for teak
logging. Thailand’s domestic ele—
phants are capable of responding
to as many as 30 separate com—
mands—dragging felled trees,
stacking logs, freeing up log
jams—goaded only by the voice of
a mahout or by light tactile signals.
Participants learn about the
functions the elephant serves in
contemporary Southeast Asian
society, such as assuring the health
ofan unborn child by striding care—
fully over the supine mother—to-be.
Still observed is the ancient prac—
tice of awarding royal status to so-
called “white e1ephants”—ani-
mals with somewhat fairer

 




hides, blue or golden eyes and white
tail hairs. An elephant possessing
these rare traits automatically
becomes the property of the king,
who today cares for a private herd
of 11 such auspicious beasts on the
grounds of his Bangkok palace.

Another tour by ZATA focuses
on endangered Indian wildlife.
This 22-day expedition features
stops at three separate Bengal tiger
preserves and a day at the interna-
' tionally known Keoladez Bird
Park. With the Himalayas as a
backdrop, groups ride elephants
across the green savannas of the
Kaziranga Preserve in Assam, a
region known for its population of
rare, one-horned Indian rhinoc—
eros. On one trip in the past, the
group tallied over 30 of these highly
endangered rhinos—a count that
included several cows with calves.

Other 200 tours visit the Galapa-
gos Islands, the volcanic staging
ground for many of Darwin’s theo-
ries on evolution; explore island
ecology in Hawaii; journey to the
tropical jungle of the Amazon
River Basin and the high-altitude
sanctuaries of Peru; and go on
safari to Kenya’s Serengeti Wildlife
Refuge. .

Getting Set for smart

To prepare for a zoo—sponsored
outing, one may ‘want to do a little
home study—not only about the
geographical region to be visited,
but about the wildlife phenomena
to be observed. A number of good
field guides on the flora and fauna
of specific regions are available.
Just as valuable is a general text
detailing animal interactions or
illustrating general principles of
ecology. For example, prior to my
Thai adventure, I immersed myself
in Southeast Asia travel guides,
studied two overviews on the natu-
ral history of elephants and brought
along Elephant Bill, the classic ﬁrst—
hand narrative of Lieutenant Colo-
nel J. H. Williams, a “frightfully
English” teak logger stationed in
Burma during the thirties.

One should bring a camera and
read an introductory guide to na-
ture photography beforehand. If
bringing along new photo equip-
ment, it is advisable to spend a day
or two practicing shots at a 200 or
wildlife park. One should pack
enough film in a variety of speeds in
order to be able to photograph in
conditions that range from the glar-
ingly lighted African veldt to the
tree-shrouded recesses of the pri—

' meval forest.

While zoo-sponsored expedi-
tions are no more strenuous than
any other type of travel, particit
pants may find themselves waking
at dawn to glimpse that seldom-
sighted weaver finch or staying up
past midnight to observe the noc-
turnal crowding at a nearby water
hole. One should get plenty of rest
before the trip so as not to miss a
single moment of these animal-
intensive itineraries.

July 6. 1987

When 2-year-old James Soto got too close to a
pit bullterrier, he became just one more casualty

'

n a summer evening

in the San Jose sub-

urb of Morgan Hill, 2-
year-old James Soto—a
dark-haired, energetic
child—was toddling about in
the fenced backyard of his
family’s modest house. It
had been a good day for the
Soto family: Arthur, 31, an
unemployed construction
worker, and Yvonne Nunez,
30, also jobless, had taken
James and brother Perry, 5,
to a round of garage sales.
Arthur had found a lawn
mower, the boys had picked
out a few used toys, and the
four had made a celebra-
tory stop for ice cream be-
fore heading home.

The night was growing
cool, and Yvonne had put
James into ajacket and
sweatpants before allowing
him to play in the yard with
his newly acquired Tenka

truck. When she went out

soon afterward there was

no sign of the boy and

the gate in the wooden fence was
standing open.

Arthur, who had been unloading the
family pickup, hadn’t seen little James
leave the backyard, but the woman
who lived in the dilapidated house next
door had. She had just noticed him
heading across her porch, she told Ar-
thur. Moments later the frantic parents
found their son in the powerful jaws of
Willie, the 52-lb. pit bullterrier chained
in that neighbor’s back yard. By the

Toddler James Soto was “savagely torn
apart,” said a doctor, by a pit bullterrier
like the one (left) in snarling midattack.

time Michael Berry, the dog’s owner,
emerged from his house and wrenched
his pit bull off the child, it was too late.
Unconscious and bleeding profusely
from gashes in the head, face, arms
and torso, the little boy was ”unrecog-
nizable as a human being,” in the words
of a paramedic called to the scene.
James died at 3:52 am. in the emergen-
cy room at Santa Teresa Hospital.
Cause of death: a massive loss of
blood. Says Morgan Hill police chief
John Abbey: “it was the worst trauma
case that hospital personnel had ever
seen!’

As hideous as it was, the June 13

mauling was hardly an iso-
lated incident. Statistics
compiled by the Humane
Society of the United
States show that seven of
the 13 fatalities attributed
to dog attacks last year in-
volved pit bulls like Berry’s.
The James Soto incident
brought this year’s death
toll to five, with pit bulls re-
sponsible in every case.
Small children are fre-
quently the victims. “When
a pit bull is looking at a 3-
year-old eyeball to eyeball,
it sees another animal,” ex-
plains Minneapolis ani-
mal-control officer Dave
Nordmeyer. “Every city in
this country is going to have
tragic problems with the
breed.”

. With America’s pit bull
population at an all-time
high (half a million, by some
estimates) and growing
fast, the breed is at the
center of a furious debate.
Those who see the dogs as
hair-trigger killers want them out-
lawed; pit bull fanciers argue that
any badly trained dog is capable of
such savagery. in the meantime sto-
ries like the Sotos’ are becoming all
too familiar: ,

0 Graphic TV footage of a pit bull at-
tack actually occurring caused a furor
when it was aired on network news last
week. A Los Angeles TV crew had ac-
companied animal-control officer Flor-
ence Crowell when she visited the
home of Edlyn Hauser to investigate
an earlier alleged attack by the wom-
an’s 'pet pit bull. The tape showed the
dog suddenly hurling itself at Crowell,

Pit bulls are, in fact, less popular
among ordinary dog lovers than
among back-alley types who prize
them for the very qualities that mak
them dangerous. Although organize
dog fighting is illegal in the US, tho
sands of fans still savor the so-Calie

“The situation for the dogs is often
desperate,” says Pat Owens, directc
of the Philadelphia-based Women’s
SPCA of Pennsylvania. Typically, the
creatures are starved or fed irritant

 




 

 

substances like hot sauce and gun—
powder to make them mean. Ears and
tails, which would be vulnerable in a
fight, are hacked off. To _sharpen the
dogs’ taste for blood, they are fed live
kittens and other small animals. When
the dogs are ready for battle, they

are pitted against one another on
street corners; often hideously injured,
the losing animals are left to die in ago-
ny. Even those survivors brought to the
SPCA are doomed; like most animal
shelters, the Philadelphia facility puts
pit bull strays to death rather than
place a potential killer in an unsuspect-
ing household.

Lawmakers across the U.S. are be-
ginning to crack down on pit bulls.
Some communities have banned the
dogs outright, others have imposed
strict licensing and require pit bull fan-
ciers to take out liability insurance.
Since ordinances directed at specific
breeds are difficult to enforce (in
part because most offenders are of
mixed bloodlines) laws targeting dan-
gerous animals in general can be more
effective. At least 35 communities
have enacted measures imposing se-
vere penalties on people whose pets
are involved in attacks on humans.

A Washington state statute, effective
July 1, is particularly stringent: Dog
owners there are now subject to felony
charges and fines of up to $10,000 if
their animals are involved in repeat at—

 

tacks or cause death or severe injury.
Pit bulls have their defenders, of

course—among them even the occa-
sional victim. Jerry Lynn Miller’s son
James, 4, was killed by her boyfriend’s
pit bull in Magnolia, Texas. She was an-
gered when a police officer shot the
animal dead. “I lost my child, I didn’t
have to lose my dog too,” she said. Pit
bull loyalists decry the notion that their

dogs should be banned from city

streets (as they are in Lynn, Mass).
They argue that careless breeding has
produced a few unstable specimens
that have tainted the image of the pit
bull; that badly handled animals are the
unfortunate exception to the rule. The
dogs, they claim, are what their owners
make them. “You couldn’t make a truly
bred pit bull bite a human,” says Al
lsaac, an official of the Pit Bullterrier
Club of Northern California.

But the dogs’ defenders have their
work cut out for them. Deaths like
James Soto’s are becoming all too
common, and more and more pit bull
owners are finding themselves in the
position of Michael Berry—who
agreed to have his dog Willie de-
stroyed after it savaged James Soto.

A 37-year-old employee of the Santa
Clara County transportation depart-
ment, Berry had raised pit bulls for ten
years. After the attack, police searched
his property and said they found both
dog—fighting magazines and a treadmill

used for training pit bulls for combat.
They also reported finding about 200
marijuana plants in the yard, and theo-
rized that Willie had played some role in
discouraging pot poachers.

Arrested on suspicion of murder and
held in lieu of $100,000 bail, the beefy,
mustachioed Berry held a jailhouse
press conference after James’s death.
Speaking in a soft, quavering voice, he
denied any responsibility for the maul-
ing. He said he had no knowledge of the
marijuana crop and described Willie as
a trophy-winning show dog who was
“more or less a pet.” Added Berry:
“This was a horrible, unforeseeable ac-
cident, and it wasn’t planned or any-
thing. But I feel the parents were largely
negligent in letting a 2-year-old out at
twilight time.”

The Santa Clara County district at—
torney’s office disagreed. Berry was
arraigned June 16 on a charge of invol-
untary manslaughter—the stiffest pos-
sible under the circumstances, accord-
ing to prosecutor Alan Nudelman.

James Soto’s mother is prepared to
see that Berry answers for her son’s
death. “it was such a horrible thing that
words can’t express my feelings,” says
Yvonne Nunez, who plans to campaign
for laws regulating pit bulls. “i don’t
want anyone else to go through what
my family has gone through.”

Dirk Ma thison and domestic bureaus

 

Yvonne and Arthur say they had been nervous about Berry’s dogs: “We were always worried,” says Yvonne.

treatment of animals.

IBttBI‘S Neither of the bills in-

troduced last session in

from the Legislature made '

th . any mention of regulat-
e , ing the treatment of

 

 

' l ‘ greyhounds. So no one

peOp e need suppose that its le-

i ‘ ‘ galization here would

be different from any- ‘

where else. The National Greyhound Associ-
ation acknowledges that despite the develop-
ment of mechanical lures, most trainers
prefer to use live animal lures. .

This means that more than 100,000 small
animals — rabbits, chickens, puppies, cats ——
will be used in training until caught and torn
to pieces by greyhounds. Outlaw live lures in
Missouri? No matter. Most of the dogs used
will still be trained in Florida, Texas or Kan-
sas on live lures.

What about the dogs themselves? The ma-
jority of greyhounds born to race will never
do 50. Only 15-25 percent will show any rac-
ing potential. Of these, many will die early of
injury. Of those remaining, they will last
about five years on the racing circuit. They
will suffer many torn muscles and broken
bones along the way until they die. It’s true
that some groups are trying to place unwant-
ed greyhounds as pets, but it’s estimated that
30,000 to 50,000 greyhounds are destroyed
each year. .

Missouri doesn’t need greyhound racing to
prosper. We are capable of better, decent

- ways to generate livelihoods for humans
without further exploiting the animal king-
dom in the name of sport.

Dog-bite viCtim awarded $295,050
WoOdstock family wins Suit over
injuries inflicted byneighbor’s pet

 

By W. Stevens Ricks
Staff Writer

 

"An 8-year-old Woodstock girl and her family were
awarded a $295,050 civil judgment Wednesday in con-
nection with a severe bite inﬂicted by a neighbor’s
dog in 1984. ,

. Lyndsey Goodman, who was hospitalized for three
days with severe thigh lacerations that almost reached
her femoral artery, won the verdict from a Fulton
County Superior Court jury after a three-day trial be-
fore Judge Luther Alverson.

The suit was filed in the child’s behalf by her par-
ents, Robert and Sharon Goodman. The award includ-
ed compensation for the couple because of time they
lost from their jobs at Delta Air Lines as a result of
the incident.

The jury issued the verdict against Mike O’Rourke
and his roommate, Dr. Eric Kahn, who were neighbors
of the Goodmans in the Woodstock-Roswell section of
north Fulton County. Each man owned a Kerry blue
terrier. The Goodmans’ attorneys alleged that both
dogs were allowed to roam free even though
O’Rourke’s dog attacked Lyndsey and a woman, and
. Kahn’s dog killed the Goodman family’s cat.

“This incident should never have happened if the
defendants had exercised the least amount of care ”
Robert M. Goldberg, an attorney for the Goodmans
said in his closing statement to the jury.

Testimony in the case showed that Sean, a 4-yeare
old dog owned by O’Rourke, attacked a United Parcel
Service deliverywoman July 23, 1984. After being
quarantined for possible rabies, the dog was released
to the owner hug. 2. '

The attack on Lyndsey occurred in her yard on .
Aug. 10. A second terrier, owned by Kahn, subsequent- ‘

1y attacked and killed the Goodmans’ cat while roam-
ing free, according to testimony. Goldberg said the
combined attacks showed a pattern of “willful, wanton
conduct” on the part of the roommates. ;

The dogs involved in the case were described as
weighing between 50 and 65 pounds. The breed is the
result of a cross between a now-extinct hunting dog
and an Irish wolfhound, accordingto Goldberg.

Because the girl was attacked by O’Rourke’s dog,
he was forced to bear the brunt of the judgment.
Kahn, who is a vascular surgeon, was held liable in
the death of the cat for $5,250 in damages and $7,500
in attorney’s fees.

Before its Wednesday afternoon deliberations, the
jury saw photographs of the girl’s wounds and heard
descriptions of how blood spurted from the child’s leg
as her mother and O’Rourke attempted to pull the dog
away. ‘

Animals To

By SANDY RYLES

Next week the Fulton County

Commission is expected to pass a

' tougher animal control ordinance.
The ordinance sponsored by

Southside Commissioner Michael

‘ Hightower is designed to keep vi-

cious dogs under wraps. .,
' Hightower says the death of a
. DeKalb, county indiVidual and at:

tacks of Southside youths from pit

bull terriers has created an emer-
gency situation as far as v1c10us
animals are concerned.

Last week commissioners re-

. ceived a draft of the proposed ani-
mal ordinance. A vote should be ,

. coming Wednesday, Hightower, 3

1 said. '

The new ordinance deﬁnes what

a vicious animal is, according to
Hightower. That animal would be

one that injures or attacks individ-
uals or animals.

. ~_.__-..‘..‘-“_~.a.. ._ .. .,_

THE ORDINANCE WOULD re- ' "

quire that animals four months old
or older must be registered and
vaccinated. '

If someone owns four or more
dogs that person has to have a
special permit, Hightower said.

Vicious animals must be kept
under restraint at times.

If a person is w... . Mng a vicious
animal, that animal must be On a
leash not longer than 6 feet and
the animal must be muzzled.

ANY VIOLATION OF the ordi-
nance is punishable with ﬁnes of

_ up to $500 for each offense. 4

“The key is to address the irre~

‘ sponsible owner,” Hightower said.

Last month Hightower called a
public hearing to give citizens a
chance to speak out on the “vicious
animal” issue.

Hightower had sought to have

“clear definitions of dangerous

 

r ‘ . - -—~~» WW-
i dogs, a deﬁnition of confinement of

dogs, instances when vicious dogs
should be muzzled, public liability
insurance, ﬁnes and licensing of i
all dogs.” ‘
E .

engineer. Miss Zazula observed a
quadriplegic who spent an hour alone
in a shopping center and then spent
'an hour there accompanied by his
monkey. While he was alone, only 2
strangers approached him to chat;
when he was with the monkey, 71 did.

The Helping Hands program, now

 

affiliated with the Boston University .

School of Medicine, evolved during
the last years that Dr. Willard
worked as an assistant to B. F. Skin-
ner, the behavioral psychologist. To
' aid a quadriplegic friend who “could-
n’t eat, drink or even blow his nose
without a nurse,” Dr. Willard, said,
she thought of training chimpanzees.
But at 150 pounds, chimps are un-
‘manageable. Dr. Skinnersuggested
capuchin monkeys, which weigh 7 to
~12 pounds; they are intelligent and
they have good memories and life ex-
pectancies of about 30 years.

colony conveniently close to the Har-
vard School of Public Health, where
she then worked. In 1979 her first
«trained monkey, Hellion, was placed
with Robert Foster, 25, of Watertown,
Mass. The two are together still. Hel-
lion is a successful aide and compan-
ion, but Dr. Willard decided that be—
cause the albifrons monkey is so
acrobatic, she would try the tamest
subspecies, Cebus apella.

, So far, Helping Hands has placed 11
monkeys, and 6 of them remain. This
year, 5 to 10 monkeys will be placed.

broadened. Financing is now largely
provided by Rehabilitation Research
and Development, a division of the
Veterans Administration. There are
; also private donations, and food is do-
nated by Hills Pet Products of Tope-
ka, Kan. ' .
Most of the monkeys for Helping
,Hands come from the group’s Florida
ibreeding center. The cost of training,
equipping and transporting each
imonkey is about $8,000.
’ The program now has volunteers
who raise the monkeys in their homes
for three years; 52 monkeys are cur-
rently with these “foster families.”
The monkeys are then trained for six
months by Dr. Willard’s small staff,
including Miss Zazula, who is the only
other full-time workng

5: Behavior modification is used in
{training the monkeys. Because quad-
;riplegics have little or no use of their

limbs, they show the monkey which

tE object should be moved by means of a

mouth-operated laser—beam pointer
attached to the wheelchair. They also
give oral commands. Proper per-
formance is rewarded with praise

dispenser on the wheelchair. .
The monkey’s ba51c repertory in

' helping quadriplegics consists of such

 

‘ tasks as operating lights; taking a

.- .5...

sandwich from a refrigerator and

putting it on a tray; putting a ther-

mos in a-holder on a tray, opening it ‘
. and inserting a straw; picking up a
' fallen mouth stick (used to dial a tele-

phone, to type or to‘turn a page);
fetching articles like books and
magazines; inserting tapes in VCR’s;
combing hair, and wiping up spills.

To keep the animals away from
areas where they might cause dam-
age or harm themselves, they are
trained to avoid objects coded with
white coin-size stickers. If a monkey
touches something that is off limits, it
hears a loud buzzer and gets a tiny
shock like the static electricity a per-
son gets from a carpet; the shock

comes through a belt the monkey-

wears. Both signals are, operated
from the wheelchair. Eventually the

buzz alone is enough to warn the mon-

key away.

All the monkeys obey commands to
return to their cages, and all are

. , paper-trained to their cages.

Helping Hands has received appli- ;

‘ cations for monkeys from hundreds
of the nation’s more than 80,000 quad- ;

:: riplegics. Because of the project’s "
small size, however, only a limited '
‘_- number can be helped. Monkeys are i

"the children can perform many tasks ‘

for handicapped family members.
Moreover, monkeys are sometimes
hostile to children.

Once placed, a monkey can take six
months to find its position in the fami-
ly, Dr. Willard said. It might fight
with family members. Even after ad-
justing, the monkey might remain

. wary of outsiders and might show

hostile behavior. To prevent harm,
the monkeys’ teeth are extracted.

Not all matches live up to expecta-
tions. One monkey, for example, was
placed with a boy who, at 12, was too
young and without adequate motor

,control to handle the responsibility.
_ “The monkey liked everyone in the

family except the quad‘rfﬁlggib,.,'-Dn-

Willard said. The monkey will be
placed with another quadriplegic.

A key to the program’s success is
the monkeys’ sharp intelligence and
quickness to imitate. In some situa-
tions, this can guarantee comic relief
from the most difficult life. Miss
Zazula recalled visiting Mr. Foster
and sitting in front of the television
along with his monkey, Hellion, who
was riveted to the screen.

“ ‘King Kong’ was on,” Miss Zazula

.said, “and King Kong had just

reached out and grabbed the steeple

Hunting propaganda

AS LONGTIME avid readers of the Free
Press, we have become increasingly dis-
turbed by the manner in which the Free Press
consistently provides column and editorial
space to the exploiters of our animal popula-
tion via Tom Opre’s weekly full-page articles.

When will the Free Press realize that the
vast majority of its readers are highly of-
fended by the persistent glorification of so-
called sportsmen? For example, Opre is given
free rein to rant on ad nauseum about the
thrill of “culling” or “harvesting” the herd.
Recently Opre devoted an entire page to a
tirade against Bob Barker and Andy Rooney
for their pro-animal stance against the wear-
ing of furs, complete with addresses of

Advice From U.S. Experts ' i

Sri Lankans are getting some help

One of the Americans working here,

the park service’s Denver Service
Center, said that the members of the

i In Sri- Lanka, that means using lim-
‘- ited space — this country of nearly 16
imillion people is only a fraction
larger than West Virginia -- to create
ESelf—sustaining habitats for restless,
voracious eaters.

“Sri Lanka is a little too small to -

have such large animals as ele-
phants,” said Malcolm A. B. Jansen,

senior environmental officer of the

. Mahaweli Economic Agency, part of
a national development project built
around the country’s largest river
system, the Mahaweli Ganga.

' “People are killing elephants that,
get into their farms,” Mr. JanSen, a
Sri Lankan who was educated here
and in East Germany, said in an in-.
terview. “We have to learn how to re-
duce conflicts between man and
beast.”

The first orphan, the Sri Lanka Wild-

furry 140-pounder.” '
In 1982, the Pinnawela sanctuary,
an extension of Colombo’s National

The vanishing Plymouth

“red-bellied turtle population
got a boost of more than one-

third when 109 of the reptiles,

captured just after hatching
last year, were returned recent-
ly to ponds in the Cape Cod ar-
ea.

Nine months ago, when the tur- I

ties were mere hatchlings, they
were scooped up from their nests in
Plymouth County or on Naushon
lsland, one of the Elizabeth Islands
in Buzzards Bay, Springfield Sci-
ence Museum curator David Stier
said Monday.

Only 300 of the shelled crea-
tures are known to exist in those

The state Natural Heritage and
Endangered Species Program sent
the hatchlings, which will grow to

Monday to a state facility in West-
borough ‘ where they will be

weighed, measured and marked for

later identification, he said.

“It’s nice to get an opportunity

to do this,” Stier said. “It’s one thing
to keep animals for the pleasure of
the public, but you get a little more
satisfaction out of doing something
you know will help to increase the
numbers of an endangered spe~

During their stint in Spring-
field, the tiny turtles began with a
diet of red leaf lettuce, frozen brine
shrimp and a nourishing packaged

US. District Court, in connec-
tion with a federal grand jury in-
vestigation. ‘

Also involved in the investiga-
tion are the US. Food and Drug
Administration and the Centers
for Disease Control in Atlanta.

Pet turtles, which sell
wholesale for less than $2 and
for up to $9.95 retail, once were
believed responsible for 14 per-
cent of the reported salmonella
cases in the country, according .
to a report by the Centers for
Disease Control.

A 1975 law, passed amid con—
cern about the turtles’ link to
salmonella poisoning, now bans
their sale except for education,

The FDA ban applies to the sale
of turtles with a shell of less

than 4 inches long, which" are,

the most desirable as pets.

Frank Curie, owner of Bird’s
Haven, said that he had received
only 2,000 of the turtles and
that all were certiﬁed by Louisi-
ana authorities as disease—free.
“None of the turtles that I re~

ceived have beeh linked to sal- .

monella,” he said.

But according to the afﬁdavit,
investigators have learned
through business records sub—
poenaed by the grand jury and
testimony that two lots of the
turtles seized from Mid City

Agents also have obtained docu- f
" merits from Great Lakes, where -

about 2,000 turtles were seized last.
year, according to the afﬁdvait.
The records show that turtles were

distributed in Illinois, Wisconsin, ,
Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, in—

vestigators said.

Curie contended that he sold the

' . turtles only to other pet stores and

that the turtles had been accompa-

nied by a certiﬁcate from the Lou- =

isiana Livestock Sanitary Board
that the reptiles were disease—free.

“I did not sell to little kids,”
Curio said. “I didn’t do anything
illegal. The government is trying
to put me out of busmess.’

But ﬁsh and wildlife investiga-
tors believe the sale of the turtles
is “needlessly and illegally .ei’gpos—
ing children to salmonellosrs, ac-
cording to the affidaVit.

Dickinson said the owner of the
Green Bay pet store told an un-
dercover investigator that “once
you take them outSide the store,
we don’t care what you do With
them.” .

And, once in the home, phySical
contact with the turtle by children
is inevitable, he said. “The chil-
dren handle them, pick up a pea—

nut-butter-and—jelly sandwich and

they get sick,” he said.

Environmentalists recoil at

WARDEN, Wash. - Borrowing

: the Lions Club in this eastern
1 Washington community is planning

a Fourth of July rattlesnake round-

up.
In the virtually snake-free part
of the state west of the Cascade
Mountains, however, contest offers
of $250 for the biggest rattlesnake,

$100 for the person bringing the
most rattlesnakes and $100 to the
person bringing the most poundage
are raising hackles among environ-
mentalists and herpetologists.

Some say they may carry pro.
test signs and distribute literature
if the event is carried out.

“They are a vital part of the bal~
ance of nature,” said Greg James,
a Seattle-area video producer who

Northwest Herpetological Society.
“Once you kill the rattlesnakes,
your fields are overrun with a
bunch of rats and mice and you
have to use pesticides. Then you’ve
got a bunch of dead rodents lying
around filled with pesticides, which
are eaten by hawks that suffer a
buildup of pesticides,” James said

“If they send a bunch of rookies

Grand County _ , ' "
by bruml killing of frien y

By Bill McCarthy‘
Special to The Denver. Post

HOT SULPHUR SPRINGS '-
Descriptions of the beating and
slashing death of a llama, consider-
ed a community pet, “just make
you Sick if you care about ani-
mals," Grand County Sheriff H.L.

Henderson said Tuesday.

Two Denver-area men have ad-
mitted that they killed and ate the
7oyear-old pack animal, which be-

, longed to the US. Forest Service,

Henderson said.

“It was considered a community
pet. It was loved by the school kids
and everybody, and some jerks de
cxded to kill it,” Henderson said.
“On a Scale of l to 10, these guys
have an IQ of about 3 as far as I’m

concerned."

, Charles Mayeski, 19, 7550 W. 66th
Ave., Arvada, and Duane Cle-
mentz, 21, 10890 W. Evans Ave.,
Lakewood, are being held in the
Grand County Jail on $2,000 bond.
They will be advised of four felony
charges and a misdemeanor
charge of cruelty to animals during
a preliminary hearing today, Hen-
derson said.

“Cruelty to animals is a misde-
meanor, but taking the meat is a
felony,” Henderson said. Other fel-
ony charges stem from the bur-
glary of a cabin at a local camp
ground and the burglary of a
vehicle.

Mayeski already was wanted for
escaping from a juvenile correc-
tion center in Golden, the sheriff
added.

The men were breaking into a

cabin at the Green Ridge Camp»

ground when they noticed the lla-
ma named “Trekker" in a pasture

and decided to take it, Henderson ‘

said. One man claimed he took the
animal because they were hungry,
while the other said they wanted to
use the llama as a pack anima.

Arapaho National Forest trail
crews used the llama to pack food
and tools into the back country.

The men held Trekker’s halter
and beat the animal. Despite its
“teary, brown eyes,” they contin-
ued to beat it and slit its throat
with a knife, they admitted.

Forest Service personnel found
the carcass of the llama on May 28.
Officers used police dogs to track

ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH - June 21, 1987

Owner Of Animal Sanctuary

Fears Return Visit By

By Kathryn Rogers
Of the Post-Dispatch Staff

BONNE TERRE, Mo. —-— Mabel
Wood placed a stack of bath towels
and a loaded .357-caliber Magnum on
a table in front of an overnight guest
at her animal sanctuary near Bonne
Terre.

Cocking the gun to show how it’s
fired, she said, “Don’t be afraid to use
it. They could come back any time.”

Wood bought the gun Feb. 14, the
day after arsonists set a fire that de-
stroyed a kennel on her property and
killed 59 dogs. At night, she keeps the
Magnum at her side as she and a
hired hand take turns guarding the
sanctuary.

Wood, 62, expects to lose a lot of
sleep until the arsonists are caught.
But she’d rest easier, she says, if she
thought the state and the St. Francois
County Sheriff’s Department were
doing all they could to solve the case.
. “Nothing’s being done at all,” she
said in an interview at the sanctuary
last week.

County and state investigators say
they’ve done their best to find the
arsonists. But their assurances
haven’t convinced Wood and other
animal welfare activists.

A spokeswoman for People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals in St.
Louis said the group planned to stage
a protest in St. Francois County soon
unless investigators made some head-
way in the case.

Some activists and residents on
Wood’s side in the matter say the lack
of investigation reflects a general in-
sensitivity toward animals in St.
Francois County. They cite shootings
of dogs earlier this year in Elvins,
Mo., and complaints about area dog
pOunds, including one in Desloge, Mo.

Wood’s sanctuary houses about 40
dogs and 20 cats on 110 acres about
five miles east of Bonne Terre. Bonne
Terre is along Missouri Highway 67

about 60 miles southwest of St. Louis.
The fire started about 1 am. Feb.
13 in a kennel several hundred yards
from Wood’s house. Charlie Jacobs,
an employee of Wood’s, had checked
the kennel about 45 minutes earlier
and saw nothing, he said. .
Deputy Charles Giessing, head of
the arson squad in the sheriff’s de-
partment, said the arsonists had
doused the inside of the kennel and
some dogs with some kind of flamma-
ble liquid and ignited it. By the time

Arsonists

Wood and Jacobs got to the fire, most
of the dogs were dead, they said.

Wood suspected arson immediately
but says it took several days and nu-
merous calls to the Bonne Terre Vol-
unteer Fire Department before any-
one would investigate. _

Wood believes that the arsonists
want her to move off the land. “I
don’t think the fire was directed at
the animals,” she said. “I think I have
an enemy that wants me out of here,
but I don’t know why.” '

Sheriff Ken Buckley and Bonne
Terre Police Chief Gene Archer said
that they had never received any
complaints about the sanctuary and
that in fact, most people in the area
didn’t even know she was there.

Giessing and Buckley are puzzled
as to why no one has responded to a
$5,000 reward posted by St. Louis
area animal rights groups for infor-
mation about the arsonists. The re-
ward has been offered since early
April. '

“Money talks, but no one’s talking
about this one,” Giessing said. “We
aren’t even hearing rumblings on the
street.” ,

But Wood insists that the depart-
ment has suspects. She says that she
hired a private investigator in April
and that he came up with two sus-
pects. The investigator, Joseph
“Rocky” Ford, turned the informa-
tion over to Giessing and the state
fire marshal’s office, Wood said.

Ford could not be reached for
comment.

Buckley said that one of the sus-
pects Ford came up with “isn’t the '
kind of man who would do something
like that.” And Giessing said the sus-
pects could not be given polygraph
tests without probable cause.

The state fire marshal’s investiga-
tor, Mathew Wood, said he also was

unable to come up with solid evi-

dence against anyone. Wood resigned
from the fire marshal’s office earlier

burned-out kennel outside Bonne Terre. Au-

this month.

The sheriff’s department has also
been criticized in connection with the
Elvins shootings. Lawrence Burns, of
Elvins, said Buckley had failed to in-
vestigate the shooting of several dogs
that had been taken to the Elvins
pound in January. ‘

Elvins is about 10 miles south of
Bonne Terre.

Burns’ dog was one of seven found
shot to death at a creek a few days
later. He said that shortly after the
shootings, he had asked Buckley to

investigate. “He said he would and ~

that’s as far as it went,” Burns said.
“He did absolutely nothing.”

Buckley contends, however, that he
investigated that case and the animal
sanctuary fire thoroughly. “We had
no evidence,” he said.

Some animal rights activists think
the Elvins shootings are just another
example of indifference to the wel-
fare of animals in the county. County
residents “think animals are their
own private property, and they can
shoot them or do what they want with
them,” said one long-time resident,
who asked not to be identified.

This spring, the St. Francois County
Health Department and the Humane
Society of Missouri investigated con-
ditions at the Desloge dog pound after

. L.T. Spence/PostDispatch
thorities say the fire, whichkilled 59 dogs last
Feb. 13, was the work of arsonists.

receiving a complaint that the pound
was not clean and that the animals
had no food or water.

Desloge is situated about five miles
southwest of Benne T erre.

In a letter provided by Desloge of-
ficials, the Health Department said
the complaint reflected an “isolated
incident” involving “lack of water
and animal waste in the pens.”

The investigator for the Humane
Society said the pound was in good
shape when he checked it.

Officials in the county and the
towns say the fire at Mabel Wood’s
sanctuary and the shootings in Elvins
are unusual and do not reflect any
sinister attitudes about animals.

Pit bullowner
says breed has
gotten bum rap

Dear Ann' Landers:
The terrible letter you
printed that gave pit
bull dogs a bad name
was a perfect example
of 1 how you shoot off
your mouth when you

7:92:12: _ don’t know what you
ANN are talking about.
. unpﬁﬁs ' We’ve had a pit bull
in our household for 25
years. Spunky, the one we have now, is our
third. He is gentle as a lamb, unless someone
. provokes him or a prowler comes around. What
good is a watchdog if he won’t go after a bur-
glar? -

I’ll bet you are going to hear from plenty of
pit bull owners who are mad as hell. — Former
Reader in Tampa ‘

Dear Tampa: Since you are a former reader,
you won’t be seeing this, but about 85 million
other people will, and I believe they will agree
that I have a point.

Joan Rickey of Sarasota, Fla., was also inter-
ested in the letter about pit bulls. She wrote as
follows: .

I

Dear Ann Landers: Washington Reader’s
friend who was chased back into his car by a
pit hull was lucky. I have been clipping ac-
counts of pit bull attacks since 1981. Your Wash-
ington Reader said, “A census of pit bulls
should be made and strict requirements put on

all owners.” I say all pit bulls should be spayed
0r neutered so none can reproduce. — J .R.

Dear J.R.: Thank you for your letter. I’m
printing excerpts from your collection of news
clips. They make a most convincing argument.

Miami, Fla: A 68-year-old woman says her
life has been misery since her beagle was at-
tacked by three snarling pit bull dogs. Ms. Kim-
merle and Suzette, a mixed breed beagle, were
taking a walk when the pit bulls converged on
Suzette, each grabbing a piece of the 14-year-old
deaf, overweight and nearly blind dog. “1 ex-
pected her to die at home, not be torn apart in
the gutter by three killer pit bulls,” she said.

Harper, Kan: Two pit bull terriers attacked
a woman when she stepped outside to get her
newspaper, tearing away her ﬂesh and killing
her.

“The most horrible part was that she was
still alive when brought to the hospital,” said .
Dr. William G. Eckert, a forensic pathologist. :
The woman died from shock and loss of blood. .

Tampa, Fla: A loo-pound pit bull ripped
chunks of ﬂesh from Catherine, Wards face. ;

The Tampa attack was one of several maul-
' ings involving pit bulls in Florida in recent
- years. Franki Scarbrough was mauled by a pit
bull terrier in Hollywood on Dec. 1', 1979, when
; he was 7, and is still having plastic surgery to
5 repair his scalp, left cheek and ear.

BOSTON GLOBE - June 21, 1987

? Pit bull mauls girl,

5 years old, visiting

relatives in

By Jim Gomez
Contributing Reporter

CAMBRIDGE— A pit bullterrier

turned on a 5-year—old Texas girl .

and severely mauled her while she
was visiting relatives here, Cam-
bridge police reported yesterday.

Eva Channel Warren of Bry-
ant. Texas. was playing with the
dog at about 9:30 pm. Friday at
the 40 Clifton St. apartment of her
aunt. Devora Dobson. whom po-
lice identified as the dog’s owner. .

The dog. apparently unpro-
voked. suddenly attacked the
child. and bit her on both sides of
the face. according to a report re-
leased yesterday by Cambridge Po-
lice Capt. Patrick Corcoran.

The girl was rushed to Mount
Auburn Hospital in a Cambridge
Fire Department ambulance
, Where she was initially treated be-
fore being transferred to Mass-
achusetts General Hospital.

An MGH spokeswoman yester-
day said the girl, who sustained

deep cuts and gashes on her face '

and bites on her right ear. was re-

"ﬂ

Carnh 'd

ported in ‘stable condition in the
hospital's intensive care unit after
three .hours of surgery early yes-

terday morning. ,7.
Eva’s parents in Texas were

notified of the attack by Cam-‘

bridge Police. Corcoran said. but
he did not know if they were com-
ing to Boston.

The 4—year- -old female pit bull
named Tresca was taken to Angel]
Memorial Animal Hospital in Bos-
ton by Cambridge and State Po-
lice, who used protective arm co-
verings and broomsticks to corner
the dog and force it into a closet

where it was captured. Corcoran

said. '

After testing negatively for ra-
bies. Tresca was euthanized with
the owner's consent. said an offi-
cial for the Massachusetts Society

for the Prevention of Cruelty to?

Animals. which operates the ani-
ma‘ hospital.

Pit bulls. according to experts,
have been bred for their ferocity
and used in staged dogfights.

Friday’s attack comes less

than a month after a 63-year-old
Lawrence man died from a heart
attack when a pit bull jumped out
of its owner’s yard and chased
him.

.At least 35 communities across
the nation have recently passed
ordinances restricting the breed.

The most recent such ordi-
nance adopted in Massachusetts
was passed by Lawrence on June
16 after the heart attack death.
The law goes into effect July 7.

In Haverhill. the City Council .

last May passed an absolute ban
on the animal, but yielded to pres-
sure from pit bull owners later
and amended the ordinance to a
leash law.

In 1986 Lynn passed a law
banning the dog after a rash of at-
tacks.

Dobson yesterday refused to be
interviewed. A woman who identi-
fied herself as a neighbor, but re—
fused to give. her name. said the
family wished to be left alone.

Carter Luke, director of shel-
ters for the MSPCA. yesterday said
the attack is likely to inflame an
already smoldering public anger
over pit bullterriers. “It is a very

volatile and highly publicized is-i

ue " Luke said.

He said the rash of ordinances

that restrict pit bulls are flooding
town and city halls throughout
the country and will increase as
long as ownership of the dogs is
sought.

Luke said the reason for the in—
crease in pit bull attacks across

the country is that. the dog is con- »

sidered the
’80s"
MSPCA figures show that from

“macho dog of the

Jan. 1. 1986, until May 30. 1987, -
there were 17 fatalities in the;
Unites States related to dog at-i

tacks. which Luke said is a nor-
mal statistic. Eleven of the at-

tacks were by pit bulls. which, he

said. is above normal.

Luke said that the ratio reflects
the fact that irresponsible people
are breeding and training the pit
bull. “The attention is unfortu-
nately focused on the dog. it is a
people-related problem.”

Corcoran said charges would

not be filed in connection with the 3

attack. He said a 1984 Cambridge
ordinance banning pit bulls with-
out muzzles from city streets was
not relevent in this case because
the attack occurred in a private
home. The ordinance cairies a
fine of $300.

, A. passfivity-ighting pet helps e

‘ seniors gain sense of well-being”

By PAMELA ADELMANN
Free Press Staff Writer

Pets influence our well-be-
ing in many ways. Researchers
are finding that pets can lift
depression, ease loneliness,

speed recovery and lower blood ,

pressure. .

In our later years, pets can .
keep us active and happy, help ,
us adjust to the loss of a spouse, "
and even reduce our reliance on .

Medicare, studies show.

According to Tom Mervak, .
psychologist at Henry Ford .3,
Hospital, “The frame of mind of
generally ii ‘
speaking, is one of heightened
anxiety because of approaching if

an older person,

death. '. . .

“A pet can serve as some-
thing that will reduce the anxi- f
ety,” Mervak said. Henry Ford

Hospital produced “Pets as Pre-
scriptions” to be shown on the
program “Health Talks” at 8
am. June 28 on WDIV—TV
(Channel 4).

PETS CAN be especially im-
portant at certain times of life.
Dr. Alexa Albert, a sociologist
at the University of Rhode Is-
land, has found that people feel
particularly attached to their
pets when their youngest child
leaves home. Pets are also espe-
cially important to people who
have lost their spouses.

Albert speculates that peo-
ple undergoing critical life tran-
sitions might form special
bonds to their pets.

“The pet is a stable force in

life during times of change,”

she said.

Other research shows that:

pet ownership has special bene-
fits for older adults:-

0 Austrian researchers re-
ported at the most recent meet-
ings of the Delta Society, a non-
profit organization dedicated to
the study of the human-animal
bond, that owning a pet de-
creased loneliness and in-
creased mobility, social con-
tacts, and well-being among
older pet owners.

_ . .— L“.— .

 

! O In a study completed this
' spring, a researcher at the Uni-
=‘ versity of California at Los An-
. geles found that elderly pet’
1 owners used Medicare less than
those without pets. The pet
; owners were especially less
likely to go to a doctor with
non-serious health complaints.

. 0 Among women inter-
vxewed two to three months after the death of their
husbands, women who owned dogs had adapted better

' _ to the loss than women without dogs. Researcher

' Sharon Bolin of the West Suburban College of Nursing

in Oak Park, 111., said a pet may help distract a widow
from her grief.

LORETTA CONWAY, supervisor of the Senior Adult
Division for the City of Farmington Hills, said that in the
past she has met “people who could have moved into
senior housing —- and needed to — but wouldn’t because
they couldn’t give up their pets. They chose the

animal because they loved that animal, and it was often
all they had.”

In 1983, Congress passed legislation allowing pets in
federally assisted housing for seniors and the handi-
capped. And a program called the Visiting Pet Program,
co-ordinated by Ann Arbor veterinarian Ruth Barthel,
sends volunteers and their pets into private Washtenaw
County nursing homes, an adult day-care center, a

rehabilitation center, and a psychiatric hospital about
once a month. ' ‘

“It’s a time for older people to reminisce about their

pets,” she said. “We call it a ‘passivity fighter.’ It’s good ‘

for them to touch something warm and soft. As their

sight and hearing go, the sense of touch becomes more
important.”

The visits by the pet owners are certainly important,
shesaid, but the animals bring another element into it.

~ “I had an experience with a man who wouldn’t talk

to anyone. . . . But a visit with a dog got himatalking
because he had had a dog.

“ANOTHER VOLUNTEER in the program visited a
stroke patient who wasn’t doing very well. But when he
saw the dog accompanying the volunteer, he reached
out to it. It got him out of his depression. It became a
chance for him to rehabilitate himself.”

Barthel said she had also heard of a program designed
to improve the eating habits of older people living alone.

The program placed parakeets with older people,
telling them “when you eat dinner, let the parakeet out
of its cage and feed it food from your plate.” They would
tell them that parakeets need a balanced diet of food
other than seeds, thereby assuring that the older person
would also eat well.

DETROIT FREE DRESS - June 24, 1987

‘ Caunicﬂ hears

H

 

about pit bulls

By TERESA BLOSSOM
Free Press Staff Writer

Pit bull terriers should be tattooed so their owners
can be traced and penalized if the dogs attack people,
experts told the Detroit City Council on-Tuesday. -

“We see 200 pit bulls a year,” said Eileen Liska,a
spokeswoman for the Michigan Humane Society.
“These animals are killing machines."

Bill Timberlake, who has investigated dog fights ~

for the Humane Society, said at a City Council public

hearing that the animals have become a status symbol
to some. ‘
“The hype has been that this Is the macho dog to
have and these kids have dog fights to see who has the ,
baddest dog in the neighborhood,’ he said. if. :‘r .
Pit bull attacks led Councilman David Eberhard to
propose an ordinance that would toughen controls out
the American Staffordshire Terrier, StaffordshireBull
Terrier, American Pit Bull Terrier and mixed breeds.‘
No figures were available on how many peeple
have been attacked by pit bulls in Detroit this year.
The ordinance also would cover any other dog that
“bites or attacks . . . in a vicious or terrorizing

'manner.”

Several experts spoke on behalf of the ordinance, -
which would require the city Department of Health to
issue a title when the dog is registered for a license
with the city. The title would have to be transferred if _
the dog is sold or given away.

An owner could be fined up to $100 for the first °
offense and $200 for a second offense. The dog would
be destroy ed after the third offense and the owner
would face a $500 fine, 30 days In jail, or both.

Final action is expected in July.

PARIS, June 18 -- There was a
poster of her in a bikini romping
around the beach in St.-Tropez. There
was a fiery-red Spanish dress that
she wore in the movie “A Woman
Like Satan.” And there was the 8.36-
carat diamond her third husband
gave her 10 years after they were di—
vorced.

Those were among the sentimental
,treasures that Brigitte Bardot, the
‘French actress who burst like a
bombshell onto the world’s movie
screens in the 1950’s, sold Wednesday
night at a glittering, standing-room-
only auction that raised $500,000 for a
. new animal-protection foundation to

be named for, her.

i Five-Minute Ovation

Wearing a slender low-cut black
suit, her long blond hair piled high,
the 52-year-old actress received a
frenzied five-minute ovation from
2,000 fans, friends and buyers when
she appeared on stage.

After the ovation brought tears to
her eyes, Miss Bardot told the audi-
ence: “I gave my beauty and my
youth to men, and now I am giving
my wisdom and experience, the best
of me, to animals.” ‘

Some of the people crowded into the
hall to buy anything, be it book or
poster, that Miss Bardot once owned.

iMany others, however, were there
i. just to see her. “We are selling many
. dreams, many illusions,” said
' Jacques Tajan, the auctioneer. “The

dream, represents 80 percent of the
pricer” ﬁlm ' Ln...“ . .

Not surprisingly, Miss Bardot sold

another with a fawn and still another
taken while she was hugging two
Dalmations, a towel wrapped around

, her head. Each of the three photo-
graphs went for $650. They were

among the 116 items, including her-

guitar ($900) and a diamond Cartier

bracelet ($17,000), that were sold at"

the two-and-a-half—hour auction,
which lasted until midnight.

Miss Bardot, who gave up acting in
1973, also sold for $5,500 the makeup
case that she once carried every—
where. It was yellow gold, orna-
mented With sapphires on the outside
and two engraved interlaced hearts
inside.

The high point of the auction was

after their divorce “for never haying

Jane Goodall wants the
public to believe that all
scientific institutions house
primates in small, cramped
cages. This isn’t so. For ex-

ample, most of the chimpan- _

zees at the Yerkes Regional
Primate Research Center

'live in social groups. Play

equipment, large indoor
rooms, outdoor play yards-g

and social companionship
with peers are provided for
the young animals. Even
many of the chimpanzees in— '
volved in studies of AIDS live
in pairs, in cage units much 3
larger than the sizes quoted
by Dr. Goodall. ;

Dr. Goodall mistakenly .
states that chimpanzees are ,1
“not good models” for AIDS

research because “no chimp ~.

Dr. Goodall doesn’t dispute
the contention that we need
animal tests for the sake of
progress. However, numer-
ous drugs that were taken off
the market after causing
damage or even death in
humans have shown that ani-
mal tests are not reliable. As
an example, Thalidomide did-
n’t seem to have any negative
effects on animals; its only
drawback was that it caused
deformities in thousands of ‘
children whose mothers had
taken the drug as a sedative
during pregnancy.

ALEUTIAN EAGLE - Dutchﬁarbor, Unalaska a all 32 Alaska Peninsula, Kodiak E,
Aleutian Vlllages - June 18, 1987

Internationdf“Incident Brewing".
= Over Japanese Driftnet Use

The Divine Wind, a former tuna
seiner become protest ship, is on her
way to Alaskan waters, her crew ready to
hunt for Japanese driftnets, photograph
the dead sea mammals ensnared in them,
and conﬁscate any driftnets they ﬁnd in
inmrnational waters.

Meanwhile, a U.S. District Court
judge in Washington, D.C.,, Tuesday
issued a preliminary injunction ordering
the Japanese salmon ﬂeet to stop ﬁshing
as of tomorrow (June 19) under a
three-year permit issued last month by
the U.S. Commerce Department.

The new permit is of shorter duration
than the previous one, allows less
incidental catch of sea mammals to
driftnetters, and ﬁnes them for those their

nets do catch. Nevertheless, the
‘ Kokechik Fishermen's Association of
Western Alaska and the Center for
Enviromnental Education in Washington
DC. ﬁled a suit immediately after the
awarding of the permit. This injunction
comes out of that case.

In issuing the temporary injunction
Judge Norma Johnson said, "When the
irreparable harm to the marine mammal
populations...is balanced against the
harms alleged by the Government and the
Federation of Japan Salmon Fisheries
C00perative Association [economic argu-
ments based on investment], the interests
” of the marine mammal populations at
stake in this case outweigh those of
other interesteed parties."

The U.S. government plans to appeal the -

injunction.

Disrupting the Fishery

Under the permit issued by the
Commerce Department, Japanese driftnet
salmon ﬁshing began in waters of the
EEZ off Alaska on June 10. In the
ﬁshery, three large mother ships, each
accompanied by 43 catcher boats depend
on free-ﬂoating plastic nets miles long
.. hanging into the water from buoys. The
1 Japanese and Koreans and Taiwanese use
. driftnets to catch tuna, salmon, Pomfret,
squid, and bilfish, but in this particular
case Japanese use of them to catch
a salmon is involved.

The mission of the Divine Wind

. is to protest the fishery by provoking
1 "an international incident involving
-' Japanese fishermen" in international .

waters. She is owned by the Sea

LmShepherd SOCiety. a Canadian-based --

environmental activist group which
claims to have sunk two Icelandic

whaling ships and destoyed that country's
only whale processing station last

:; November.

Paul Watson, spokesman for the

_ society, says the Divine Wind is so

called because her name translates to
"kamikzsi" in Japanese. The announced
plan is for her to sweep south in an arc
off the Aleutians in search of driftnets.
Any found outside U.S. waters will be
hauled aboard, cut up and sent to the
bottom of the sea with weights.
Supposedly nets found within U.S.
waters will only be photographed.

Other Opposition

Before the Department of Commerce
i5sued the permit last month,
environmental and Native groups had
protested strongly against the renewal of
the contract, based on the number of
Alaska-bound salmon they intercept and
on the dall porpoises, fur seals, and sea
birds incidentally caught in the nets as
they are used.

Alaska Senator Ted Stevens has been
an outspoken opponent of the permit,
and has a bill before the Congress
prohibiting driftnet use in American
waters. .

When the Department of Commerce
issued the permit in May, both the
Japanese and environmental and Native
groups sought to have it overturned.
The Japanese felt it was too restrictive
because it reduced the allowable
incidental take of dall porpoise by-65
percent. They also objected to NOAA
Administrator Anthony Calio's boost of
the number of observers aboard Japanese
driftnet vessels to ensure compliance
with terms of the permit. ’

In Alaska, the driftnets have an

. unmeasured but apparently serious effect
-‘ on several fisheries. Because the drift-
_ nets take all salmon within their breadth,

. however mature, they are blamed and
; may be responsible for a steep decline in
‘ some commercial and sports harvests.
‘ Several Native commercial fishing
operations may not be able to operate at
i all this year because of poor returns.

Los Angeles ' ’3
In his mirror-walled dressing

room, “The Price Is Right” TV
hoSt Bob Barker exclaimed: “The

. other day a friend said to me, ‘Bark-

or, you are a part-time television

xihost and a full-time animal rights
. activist.

The 6&year-old Barker, who

has been on TV since 1956, laughed

"out loud. In February, he threaten-
.‘ed to quit as host of the Miss USA
Pageant after he learned that 10 fur
coats worth $250,000 would be mod-
eled by the finalists over their swim-
suits. Barker stood his ground, and
fake furs were substituted.‘

In March, he resigned as host of ,

the annual Patsy Awards for animal
perfOrmances in movies, criticizing
the American Humane Association
for “producing a telecast that hon—
ors trainers who may have used cru.
'el training methods in preparing
their animals to perform.”

111 April, he charged that the
chimpanzees in the movie “Project
X” were treated with cruelty, insin-
uating that the Humane Association
-— responsible for protecting ani-

mals on movie sets and on television -

' ~— was not doing its job. Barker says

\ he has an “an eyewitness account, a

man’s sworn testimony in which he
describes having seen the chimpan-
zees beaten by their trainers with
clubs, blackjacks and their fists.” He

~ declined to name the witness.

Carmelita Pope, American Hu-

Barker sincere, but strongly disput-

Personal Effects

need for leather belts

“I’ve always loved animals, had

- who had “an absolutely Tom Saw-

yer-like'boyhood” growing up in

South Dakota. “1 had contributed to ,.

animal-oriented organizations, but I
had never been active until about

eight or nine years ago when I was”
invited to participate in ‘Be Kind to

, was a vegetarianlong before I was.”

Barker is “mostly concerned

about the abuses and excesses of
animal experimentation,” he said,

about *“factory farming where

.chickens are packed in so: closely

tOgether that when they die there’s

not enough room for them to fall ‘

over,” and about the cruelty in kill,
ing animals for furs.

“As a matter of fact, the fur

he added with disgust, “are being

Opposes Experimentation

 

Asked whether the purpose of
animal experimentation is not to ad-
vance knowledge about diseases
and prolong life, Barker replied:
“That’s a myth that has enabled peo-
ple to make millions of dollars from
animal suffering. Absolutely. I do
not have the scientific background
to present the arguments as well as

it could be presented, but I have

materials at home... I’m a total

Only recently, he said, did he
decide “to do something about the
cruelty to animals in the entertain-
ment industry. " Thus, his action on

2 Women

By Kim Bell
Of the Post-Dispatch Staff

Two area women armed with
large fish nets floated a boat
Wednesday across the pond in Will-
more Park. They captured nine
ducks there — survivors of attacks
that have resulted in the deaths of
at least 18 ducks in the past month.

The capture is the latest — and
final —— effort to rescue the remain
ing nine ducks at the pond, in St.
Louis Hills. Officials with the Hu-
mane Society say that more than a
dozen Pekin ducks —- a domesticat-
ed white duck -— had been decapi-

tated or stabbed to death since

‘ since June 1.

“It looked like someone had tak-
en a knife to their meaty part,” said
Sheri Beck of Brentwood. She
found the first casualty early this
month. “Their white fluffy chests
kind of stick out, and that’s the part
that is cut.”

Beck is the founder of the Pekin
Duck Fund, a non-profit group of
area residents who aid endangered
ducks.

A year ago, the ducks at Will-

30. But in the last month, four
ducks were decapitated; 12 were
stabbed to death; "and the necks of
at least two were broken.

In each case, the dead duck was
found about 15 yards from the lake,
apparently coaxed away from the,
water with bits of food. The heads
of the decapitated ducks have been
found about 10 yards from the bod-
ies, officials said.

. clients’ pets. . .

. Ms. Hough’s pet portraits include items representa-
. tive of family members’ personalities and hobbies. She
visits clients’ homes to take photos of the pet and col-
lect “boxes of their junk.” She then creates a still life of
the pet and the items in her Nexus Contemporary
Center studio. - 7

Ellen Holland’s 14 years of volunteer work with the
High Museum is represented by the museum’s inclusion
in Ms. Hough’s painting of the family’s two airedales.
The painting, which Mrs. Holland describes as “enor-
mous,” hangs over the mantel.

“I have no portraits of my children,” said Mrs. Hol»

land, “and we have a wonderful art collection. When
people find out what I paid for this, they think I am
nuts, but it was worth every penny. Since then I have
given my little girl one of Jennine’s paintings of her cat
for her birthday.” '

Cost of a Jennine Hough pet portrait ranges be?

itween $750 and ~$4,800. She does not paint peeple.

its portrait

pets’ life expectancies are short, the portrait allows an
owner to immortalize the pet.” . .

Artists who paint pet portraits say their love of ani-
mals initially inspired them to capture creatures on
canvas. Then they discovered good money could be
made in painting Rover and Kitty.

Ms. Hough began painting animal portraits in early
1986. She painted her cats and sold the paintings in gal-

d .

The degree of an animal’s furriness determines Ms.
Atwater’s prices. She says “a fluffy animal costs more
than a ﬂat, because layering the animal’s coat is, what,
takes time.”

She has been commissioned to paint pets on canvas
and pillows. One client hired her to paint a hunt scene‘
of the family’s horses across the living room mantel.

' Her latest project is doing three-D stuffed likenesses of

pets. Ms. Atwater says the stuffed animals are made-to-
measure so “owners can sit them by their chair, in the
kitchen or on a bed and it will appear as if the pet is
sitting there.” _

Ms. Atwater limits her commissions to 100 a year.
She works from photographs, composites or life sittings.
Though animals are her primary focus, she will paint
people with their pets. * . .>

An Atwater original will cost a minimum of $450
with the average price being close to $650. Her work is
represented in Atlanta at Threlkeld, Schlemon Asso-
ciates, Inc., Atlanta Decorative Arts Center showroom

Staff Writer

DELRAY BEACH - With the
help of his good buddy and his best
friend, Jeff Howard nabbed a bur-
glary suspect outside his home ear-
1y Tuesday. ’

While Howard’s buddy, Jon Gil-
more, held the suspect, his best
friend -- a loo-pound pit bull terri-
er named Pax — made sure the
man didn’t attempt to break away.

“Jon is my good buddy,” Howard
said, “but Pax is my only trusted
friend in the world.”

Police said Gilmore and Howard
staked out Howard’s house Tuesday
morning after Howard had been
burglarized several times in recent
months. According to police re-
ports, the two men caught Carl
Clayton Webb, 30, in Howard’s 1977
2802. . . ‘

Webb, who gave officials no ad:
dress, was in the Palm Beach Coun-l

" ty Jail on Tuesday charged with

burglary. He was being held on
$3,000 bail.

“I was fed up,” Howard said.
“I’ve been getting hit left and right.
It got to the point where someone
came intomy house one day while I

was taking a shower.”

On Tuesday, Gilmore waited in-
side his van, hidden among some

 

‘trees at the side of Howard’s home

—- June 24,

in the first block of Northeast '

Fourth Street, Howard said.
When Gilmore saw a flashlight

beam pass his van window, he qui- ‘
etly moved out to Howard’s car in

back of the house, Howard said. Po-
lice said Gilmore caught Webb
bending into the car through the
hatchback door.

“Jon caught him and I came out
with the dog,” Howard said. “I was

trying to scare him. I had the shot--

gun inside the kitchen door if I
needed it, but he wasn’t going any-
where.”

Howard moved into the wood-
frame home, in one of Delray
Beach’s oldest neighborhoods,
about four months ago. Since then
he said he has lost a camera, a bicy-
cle and a couple of watches. But the
thieves only broke into his house or
car when the doors were unlocked.

“This was the first night we tried

this and we snagged one,” Howard

said. “If you leave something un-s

locked, they’ll go in. And we want- .'_

ed someone to come.”

NEW YORK TIMES - June 22, 1987

 

By PETER APPLEBOME
Special to The New York Times

ALAMO, Tex., June 17 — Once this
was the heart of one of the most di-
verse wildlife areas in the nation, a
teeming subtropical landscape of
tidal flats, thorn and palm forests,
brush land and river woodlands that
supported an extraordinary variety
of plant and animal life.

Biologists estimate that at least 90
percent of the natural environment is
gone, flattened for the fruit and
vegetable fields, shopping malls or
vacation resorts of the Rio Grande
Valley. ,

Now a combination of increased
public awareness and tough eco-
nomic times are giving a boost to a
project to save what remains and to
create a 107,000-acre wilderness cor-
ridor for some of the nation’s rarest
and most endangered wildlife.

The effort, which still faces some
major hurdles, is a sign of the grow-
ing sophistication of the environmen-
tal movement, which has taken ad-
vantage of ecological awareness with
a skillful economic sales pitch here.

‘Window of Opportunity’

“The downturn has provided a win-
dow of opportunity for us by bringing
into play some economic forces that
might not have been concerned about
a wildlife refuge before,” said Bob
Schumacher, manager of the Rio
Grande Valley National Wildlife Ref-
uge, which is trying to establish the
corridor. “But we’ve been getting a
lot of grass roots support for a long
time. It takes a little while for people
to digest the idea, but there isn’t
much in life more gratifying that the
opportunity to see your land live for-
ever.”

At issue is the American portion of
what biologists call the Tamaulipan
biotic province, covering parts of
northeastern Mexico and the four
counties that make up the Rio Grande
Valley. It is an area rivaled only by
the southern tip of Florida for the di-
versity of its plant and animal life,
biologists say. .

The diversity is due to its warm cli-
mate and the fact that four climatic
and geographical forces intersect
here. They are the Chihuahuan
Desert to the west, the temperate
zone to the north, the Caribbean influ-
ence from the east and the tropical in-
fluence from the south. '

It is also situated at the conver- j
gence of two major bird migration :
routes, which makes it one of the .1
most important bird sanctuaries in 7

the nation. Some 371 species, includ-
ing many found no place else in the
nation, have been found at the 2,000-
' acre Santa Ana National Wildlife Ref-
uge, the first Federal refuge in the
area and a centerpiece of the pro-
posed wilderness corridor. .
Endangered animals and birds
found in the area range from the oce-
lot and jaguarundi to the brown peli-

picked up considerably-in recent”

years, and about 20,000 acres have so
far been purchased for the area.

Quality of Life Stressed
The area’s economic downturn has

, been a major factor in the progress.

It has lessened pressures for develop-
ment, increased the allure of the pro-
gram to local landowners and bank-
ers, and brought new visibility to the
importance of tourism and quality of
life issues in the area.

Those economic spinoffs, such‘as
$20 million generated in the white-

-winged dove hunting season, have

been stressed in selling the project.
Also emphasized has been the 0p—

- portunity for the government to buy

land at bargain prices. When the local
Congressman, Representative E.
(Kika) de la Garza, argued for the

_ project this year he told a Congres-

sional subcommittee, “If we in Con-
gress do not act now to accelerate the
land acquisition program, we Will not
need to worry in later years because
the price tag will be way out of line
with what the nation might be able to

Bﬁrutalizing
Horses For ‘
Entertainment

Along with others who are aware of
the practice, I deplore and resent the use
of the cruel spiked device that trans-
forms an ordinary horse into a “bucking
bronco.”

At “Wild West Rodeos” a horse is sad-
dled in a confined stall and just forward
of the animal’s hindquarters is placed a
heavy leather strap encircling the body
with a spiked device in contact with the
genital organs. Just as the macho cowboy
seats himself in the saddle, the genital
torture strap is firmly tightened. The
gate is then opened and the horse, ago-
nized and in excruciating pain, bolts out
into the arena with the rough-rider on its
back.

The gullible paying public in the

bleachers is treated to these perverse;

5

displays of cruelty to animals under the
guise of daring exhibitions of macho cow-
boy skill at riding wild horses. There is
nothing wild about the poor horses. With-
out the torture device in place there
would be no wild and woolly, crowd-
pleasing “bucking bronco” display.

If the unlikely day ever comes that
proud, unbroken wild mustangs from the
Western ranges are brought to a rodeo
arena and ridden by cowboys without us-
ing artificial pain-inducing devices, I will
then say that such riders would be de-
serving of applause. Until then, all per-
sons with admiration for the horse, that
ancient great friend and benefactor of
mankind, should show their compassion
and sense of stewardship by boycotting

all such arenas of barbarism.

Honorable Pat Swindall
Congressman from Georgia
House Office Bldg.
Wash., DC 20515

Dear Pat:

.Am sure I have written on the enclosed before this, but

am delighted to see that Congressman Robert Mrazek of

Long Island is leading an effort to eliminate fined logging
target and to subject the subsidy to an annual review.

For some time now I have been reading of the desecration of
our National Forests by the Forresty Service, and it is really
sickening. I am sure the logging is furnishing jobs, but at
what cost to the ecology of this country?

To cut down 500 year old trees for lumber we don't seem to be
able to sell is not ludicruous, it is tragic and sad, and it
constantly amazes me that the people living in these areas are
not.fighting to stop this wholesale destruction of something it
took hundreds of years to grow.

Please cast your support for this bill with Congressman Mrazek.

Copy of this letter is going to Sam Nunn and wyche Fowler in the
hopes they will support any such legislation inthe Senate.

Let's stop the utter destruction of our old forests for a few
dollars.

Sincerely,

(Mrs.) Connie Yarbrough

i Paying Twice to Ruin a Rain Forest

Here’s a Federal plan so wrongheaded it’s
likely to provoke profanity from any fair-minded
person:

I. Find a rare rain forest full of magnificent old
trees.

2. Set aside millions of acres in the forest for
logging, even though there’s plenty of timber on the
market.

3. Since the value of the timber therefore can’t
‘ possibly cover the costs of cutting roads deep into
the wilderness, give a Government agency all the
money it needs to bulldoze the forest.

4. To insure that the taxpayers don’ t balk make
the appropriation permanent, thus averting regular
review by Congress.

That, more or less, is the Federal program for
the Tongass National Forest in Alaska, a land of
pristine salmon streams and towering evergreens.
The Carter Administration agreed to this Tongass
giveaway to win votes for a division of Federal land
In Alaska Now, sensibly, many rnembersof Con-
gress want to undo a deal that’s as reckless With
Federal dollars as it is with Alaska’s eiiV1ronrrient
They deserve warm support.

.Tongass is the largest of national forests, a land
the size of West Virginia covering most of Alaska’s
. southern panhandle. The huge preserve is prized for
its beautiful mountain landscapes and majestic
Sitka spruce, as well as its unusual temperate rain
forest environment. Yet it has little economic value.
Left to market forces, Tongass would support little

more than modest tourist and fiShing industries on
its fringes.

Some 30 years ago, however, as part of an ill-
conceived development policy, Washington per-
suaded two pulp processing companies to set up
shop in the forest. And in 1980, when Jimmy Carter
was eager to settle the disposition of Alaskan lands,
the pulp processers used their political leverage to
extract the maximum advantage.

The settlement requires the Forest Service to
spend whatever it takes to enable private bidders to
harvest an average of 430 million b . d feet a year
from the forest. That was a bad deal seven years
ago. Today, with. the market for timber in chronic
glut, it is a grim joke. Uncle Sam is required to
spend $50 million a year on the loggers’ behalf,
while receiving only $1 million in fees.

The Forest Service, whose bureaucracy often
fails to distingush public interest from private, de-
fends logging in Tongass as a jobs program It’s
true that logging employs some 1,900 people. But the
logging jeopardizes other jobs, in tourism and
salmon fishing. in any case, what logic is there in
asking the taxpayer to cover the wages of workers
hired to chop down 500-yea1-uld trees that hardly
anyone wants to buy?

There’s no logic at all, only pandering to special
interesrs. That’s why Representative Robert
Mrazek, the Long Island Democrat, is leading an ef-
fort 1n the House to eliminate the fixed logging tar-
get and to subjecr the subs‘1dy to annual review.
Similar legislation is pending in the Senate. The *
sooner Congress ends this economic and ecological
scandal, the better. . '

,Tribune Staff Writer

LARGO -— If you’ve been
searching high and low for a blue-
print for a bat house, look no fur-
ther. Drop Craig Huegel a, note, and
he’ll send you one — for free.

“Yeah, I’ve got a bunch of dif-
ferent plans for bat houses,” says
Huegel, as casually as if all of us
had one in our back yards.

Why, you might wonder, would
anyone want to build a bat house?
To attract a bat, naturally.

“Bats are great animals,” Hue-
gel enthuses. “An individual bat
catches 500 insects an hour. On any
given night, a bat will eat approxi-
mately;3,000 insects. That’s a lot of
insect control from one bat living
around your property.”

As Central Florida’s new urban
wildlife specialist, Huegel has a
most unusual mission. He’s trying to
teach city dwellers how to turn
their yards into miniature wildlife
refuges, among other responsibili~
ties.
You wouldn’t think that Flori-
da’s big cities — crammed with
people and automobiles, paved over
with asphalt and concrete — would
be teeming with wildlife. But there’s
an “amazing amount of wildlife in
urban areas,” Huegel is quick to as-
sure doubtlng Thomases. '

Huegel’s not talking bears and
mountain lions. He’s talking small
critters -— bats, birds and butter-
flies, rabbits and squirrels, toads
and frogs, armadillos and opossums,
snakes and other slithery things.

Instead of living in thick woods
and deep forests, urban wildlife
makes its home in yards, vacant lots
and public parks.

Speaking of snakes, Huegel says
he realizes that he's facing quite a
public relations challenge. “There’s
definitely the scare factor,” he con-
cedes. “I get all kinds of calls about
snakes in yards. People think
they’re all poisonous. But that’s not
true; most aren’t. People don’t un-
derstand that snakes do a world of
good!’

Like bats, snakes are great pest
controllers, Huegel contends. "They

eat all sorts of noxious animals --—-.I
insects that people hate, mOle crickj,
large»

‘ snakes do a real number on fruit
rats. People spend a lot of money
‘ trying to eradicate these things.”
Huegel realizes that most people
aren’t ready to invite snakes into
their yards as permanent residents.
But he’s trying to convince hom-
eowners to “leave them alone” if

they happen to slither into the

neighborhood.

For urbanites who would wel-
come wildlife of a less sinister vari-
ety, Huegel is chock-full of ideas for
attracting songbirds and butterﬂies
and bunny rabbits to yards.

Birdhouses, for instance, are de-
.- signed differently to attract differ-
ent kinds of birds, he says. Huegel

’ has plenty of birdhouse blueprints,

too. And bird feeders have to be
filled with different kinds of food.
Cardinals and doves do not munch
on the same snacks, Huegel ex-
plains.

. If it’s butterflies you want, sim-
ply putting in a flower bed won’t
necessarily do the trick. You have
to plant certain kinds of flowers,
such as — wouldn’t you know it —

s._..._z-__ ._--—.M --

butterfly weed and other native
wildﬂowers.

When Huegel moved to Largo
four months ago to start his new
job, one of the first things he did
was dig up the grass in his front
yard. In place of the blades, he
planted a garden of flowers and
plants that attract butterflies.

“It’s coming along great,” Hue-
gel says. “I’m getting more butter-
flies every day.”

Those neatly clipped, carefully
landscaped yards —- highly prized
by city dwellers - don’t make good
wildlife habitat, Huegel says. “Most
yards are too neat,” he maintains.
“They have a lot of closely mowed
grass, a few azalea bushes in the
corner and maybe a palm tree or a
shade tree. There’s not much for
animals to do in a typical yard.”

To attract wildlife, yards need a
wide variety of plants that provide

food and shelter for animals, Hue- '
gel says. “And it’s not just the kinds.

of plants. It’s also the way they are
planted.” Ideally, homeowners
should leave a corner of their yards
in a natural state with trees and
bushes native to Florida growing in
abandon, he explains. And no mow-
ing in that comer, he preaches.
“Your neighbors might think

i

you’re nuts,” Huegel laughs. “But
the wildlife will appreciate it.”

For wildlife lovers who own
pets, Huegel offers this precaution:
Keep them inside or on a leash
when they’re outside. “I’ve seen a
declawed cat kill birds. And I’ve
seen dogs dig up nests and kill bun-
nies,” he says. “That’s just the way
cats and dogs are. You can’t blame
them for that.”

The 33-year-old expert has a
doctorate in wildlife ecology and is
a faculty member of the Depart-
ment of Wildlife and Range Science
at the Institute of Food and Agricul-
tural Services, which is part of the

' University of Florida.

Huegel is working in a pilot pro-
gram sponsored by UF and funded
by the Florida Game and Freshwa-
ter Fish Commission. His territory
encompasses all of Central Florida
and his office is in Largo at the Pi-
neilas County Cooperative Exten-
sion Service.

Huegel says he can’t think of a
better place for an urban wildlife
specialist to have an office. "Pinel-

‘ias County is the most densely popu-

lated, most urbanized county in
Florida,” he says. “I see all the
problems right here, firsthand I
drive from town to town and hardly
ever see a vacant lot. The county is
really one big city.” .

Two other urban wildlife spe-
cialists are helping Huegel spread
the gospel that big cities can be
friendly places for wild animals.

' Joe Schaefer, assigned to North

Florida, has an office in Gainesville,
and Frank Mazzotte, assigned to
South Florida, works out of Fort
Lauderdale.

If you want to attract wildlife to
your yard, write Huegel and he says
he’ll “send all kinds of informa-
tion.” His address is 12175 125th St.

N., Largo, Fla. 33540.

Huegel also offers urbanites ad-
vice about the most practical and
economical way to solve wildlife
problems -- squirrels and raccoons
tearing up attics, armadillos and
moles digging up yards, snakes slith-
ering around neighborhoods, pi-

geons leaving their droppings all

over the place.

“People don’t understand why
wild animals do what they are doing
—— like digging up yards. So they get
suckered into doing all sorts of cra-
zy things to get rid of the problem,”
Huegel says. “‘They plug up the
holes, or they put mothballs in the
holes. But tee animal just comes
back the next night and digs a new
one. He’s looking for insects. He’s
not being mean and nasty.”

The only effective solution, Hue-
gel says, is to trap the animal and

take him far away from your yard -

— say 10 miles or more -— and let
him go in a park or vacant lot, pref-
erably in the country, not in some-
one else’s yard.

Huegel is happy to offer such
advice, but he’s not in the business
of catching wild animals for people
bothered by them. “I just don’t have
the time,” he explains.

In the few months that Huegel
has been on the job, he says “the
calls and everything have been es-
calating.” In March, he got 35 calls;
in April, 100 or so; in May, at least
120. His telephone number is 1-586-
5477..

Florida is the first state in the
nation to launch an urban wildlife
program, Huegel says. “It’s really

exciting from the national perspec- '

tive. I’m sure other states will be
using Florida’s program as a model
over the next five to 10 years. Flori-

da is on the cutting edge as far as -
:1

urban wildlife goes.”

 

 




BOSTON GLOBE June 24, 1987

Dog office
mauled by

bull terrie

Associated Press

LOS ANGELES — As a news camera
rolled, a pit bull terrier burst out a screen
door and attacked an animal control offi-
cer, clamping its jaws onto her hand and
crushing the bone. authorities said.

Officer Florence Crowell was bitten
Monday while investigating a report that
the dog had attacked a 7-year-old girl-and
her father.

The attack was recorded by a KCBS-
TV news crew, which accompanied the
officer for a story on pit bull terriers.

“He only wanted to protect me." said
the dog's owner, Joy Hauser. “Now they
want to kill my baby for that.”

Crowell, 33, was reported in satisfac-
tory condition yesterday at Glendale Me-
morial Hospital, where she was treated
for bites to both hands. her wrists and
her chest, said a nursing supervisor.

“She actually had a bone crushed in
her right hand,” said Linda Gordon.
spokeswoman for the city Department of
Animal Regulation. .

According to Gordon, the dog burst
through a screen door as Crowell ap-
proached Hauser’s home and took the of-
ficer’s hand in its jaws.

Hauser tried to call her dog off . but the
screams and struggle only prompted the
dog to hold on until a neighbor struck it
with a stick. KCBS photographer Don
Menzel also tried to pull the dog off.

“I did not sic Benjamin on her,"
Hauser said. The control officer "was
standing at the edge of the driveway.
crunched over and waving a stick. I told
”her that she better be careful because
hBenjamin would attack if she kept wav-
i'ing a stick." '

ﬁhas brought calls in some California com-

ATLANTA JOURNAL - 7/1/87

By Steven Marantz
Globe Staff

Pit bull terriers do not attack people
~ more than other breeds, but when they do
they inflict a greater wound, the director
of the Tufts University Center for Ani-
mals said yesterday.

While most dogs bite and hold their
.t victims, pit bulls bite and tear and shake,
: causing generalized damage to tissue and
' shock, said Andrew Rowan.

As a result, seven of 12 dog-caused fa—
talities nationwide in 1986 involved pit
ulls. Three fatalities in 1987, and possi-
ly a fourth. involved pit bulls, Rowan
said.

"A pit bull is trained to inﬂict the
', maximum amount of damage in the
-: shortest amount of time,” said Rowan.
:"Other dogs bite and hold. A Doberman.
a or a German shepherd won’t tear if you
:stand still. A pit bull is more likely to re—
: move a piece of tissue.

2 “Dogs fight as a last resort under most
:circumstances. But a pit bull will attack
5 without warning. If a dog shows a sub-
:missive characteristic such as rolling
rover most dogs will stop their attack. A
;pit bull will disembowel its victim."

concern over pit bulls. Roiyan said.

The specialists also found that pit
bulls increasingly are being acquired by
people who select them for aggressiveness
and seek to develop their aggression.

Despite several damning conclusions,
the specialists recommended that pit
bulls not be singled out for regulation but
that all vicious dogs come under more
stringent laws, Rowan said. The special-
ists concluded that singling out pit bulls
constituted a legal problem because they
are an amorphous breed of several varie-
ties. ‘

“I’m trying to play this down - there’s
a hysteria out there." said Rowan. ”I feel
for the owners of well-behaved pit bulls.
These dogs mean a lot to their families. It
can be a real trauma to euthanize a nice
dog." ' '

A member of the Responsible Dog‘
Owners Committee of Lynn, a group of 12
pit bull owners. said yesterday that the
media are responsible for creating a
“mass hysteria” against pit bulls.

“All you’re hearing about is pit bulls,”
said Evelyn Parish. “They‘re doing a lot
to scare people. But I know of attacks in-
volving a chow and a German shepherd
within the last two weeks that didn’t get
into the newspaper.

"They should go after all vicious
dogs.” ‘

creased dramatically in the last 10 years.
Rowan said. While no hard statistics are
available, he said, one magazine reported
that the number of pit bulls in Philadel—

. phia has increased from 25 to about

5,000 in that period. -

Though the number of dog bite fatali-
ties has remained constant during the
last 10 years, the proportion involving pit
bulls has increased, Rowan said.

Doberman pinschers and German
shepherds previously were the choices of
people seeking aggressive dogs, but pit
bulls are now more apt to fill that role.
Rowan said. People who cultivate a “ma-
cho” personality are likely to own pit
bulls, he said.

A study by Dr. Randall Lockwood of
the US Humane Society fOund that pit
bulls a more likely to break restraints
to attack someone and that pit bulls are
more likely to attack their owners. possi-
bly as a result of owners trying to sepa—
rate their dogs from victims, Rowan said.

A study conducted last year by Palm
Beach County, Fla., found that pit bulls
ranked seventh in inflicting severe bites,

.behind chows, Rottweilers, cooker span-

iels, Labrador retrievers. German shep-
herds and Dobermans. .
However, the study found that pit .
bulls inﬂicted the most bites per dog, with
a total of 230 bites out of 1,862 registered

. I’ve said it before: Hunters generally get
exactly what they deserve -— nothing. Hunt-
ers are too complacent, too unwilling to stand
up for their sport, Evidently believing that
some good fairy will come along and protect
them from the ravages of vociferous anti-
hunters. _

In the meantime, the hunting freedoms
they enjoy are being chipped away, piece by
piece.

One tiny example: Not long ago I wrote .

about anti-hunting sentiment expressed on
network television and radio, recommending
that hunters write show producers and adver-
tisers involved. Some probably did. But the
chorus of anti-hunting comments the Column
precipitated in letters to the Free Press editor
and to this newspaper’s other columnists who
abhor hunting went totally unanswered.

Anti-hunters will always respond. Hunt-
ers will do nothing. Not a sentence in defense.
Not a word.

They must believe there is no danger. But

the danger is only too real.

TAKE WHAT happened in Massachusetts
this year. The local society for the prevention
of cruelty to animals tried to ram through a
law reorganizing the state Fisheries and
Wildlife Board, which establishes hunting,
fishing and trapping regulations. Instead of a
surplus majority of dedicated sportsmen and
women being named to the board, as the law
now demands, the society wanted sportsman

For that matter, where do Michigan’s two

citizens said.

“One or two dogs were still crying when I
covered them up,” bulldozer operator Gerald
Burgess said. “I didn’t look any more than I
had to, because I don’t enjoy the job I do, but

someone has to do it.”

City animal control officer Gilmer Coil
picked up the dogs on May 6 from the prop-
erty of Earl Curry, who operates “dog alley."
Coil took the dogs to the Van Zandt County
animal shelter and was unable to leave them
for lack of space, according to shelter em-
ployee Margret Stone.

Ms. Stone said she suggested the animals
be taken back to the Curry property until

room could be made at the shelter. Ms. Stone
said she saw Coil taking the dogs to the dump
and heard five shots.

Burgess said that Coil and an assistant '

took the dogs to the dump in a wire basket
and shot them through the basket. The basket
was placed in the bulldozer blade and buried,
he said.

The May incident was the only time Bur-

. gess recalls that animals were buried alive.

Asked about the May killings, City Mana-
ger Gerald Turner said, "I have no direct
knowledge of the incident."

He also refused to comment when asked if
he gave the orders for the dogs to be shot.

Animal control officer Coil said he did
not remember the incident. “We eliminate so
many dogs each month I don‘t remember one
particular time from the other,” he said. 7

When asked what method is used to
dispose of unwanted animals, Coil said: “We
shoot them, sometimes we knock them in the
head. If you’re going to kill them, one way is
as good as another.”

Citizen appeals were made to the City
Council on June 16 for controls on the num-
ber of animals taken to the animal shelter
from “dog alley” and on the way in which
they are eliminated if not accepted by the
shelter, said Betty Conatser, a humane society
supporter.

Complaints about inhumane treatment of
animals at "dog alley” and allegations about
possible health hazards in the disposal of
dead animals were topics of discussion at the
council meeting, Conatser said. The council
said it was unable to help because “dog alley”
is private property, zoned commercial,
Conatser said.

Conatser said that diseased and malnour-

the Curry property and that dead
animals are sometimes thrown into
an adjoining creek. “This is a health
hazard,” she said.

“Dog alley,” which has been op
erated by the Curry family for
mas years, has only recently been
the target of repeated complaints,
Curry said. For a fee, Curry pro-
vides space for sellers to offer ani-
mals during trades day.

“I don’t know if they (the ani-
mals) are diseased or whatever,” he
said. “I see myself as doing a ser-

. vice. I try to keep my grounds clean

Dogs left behind after trades

said. What the city does with them
is up to the city, he said.

Curry said dead animals are
sometimes thrown in the creek by
his customers. However, if offend-
ing customers are caught, they are

barred from being readmitted to p"

Curry said he is willing to meet

_ y e Zoo’s new coup

XHIBIT areas at the Denver

Zoo seem to get better and
better. When “Bird Worl ” open-
ed in the ’705, it was an innovation
in aviaries. It was also a pure de-
light. Since then, the zoo has built
a new home for its primates, and
now another triumph - Northern
Shores. . .
The ssﬁ-acre representation of
.a high-latitude seaside habitat
features four young polar bears
frolicking in a 70-by-40—foot pool
and a squad of sea lions skimming
up and down another pond that’s
140 feet long. The most fun is that
zoo visitors can watch the sport
through big underwater windows.
There are also river otters and

snowy owls and arctic foxes.

It took two years to build the
$4.3 million exhibit area -— with a
$3 million bond issue that Denver
voters approved in 1982, and with
generous private contributions.
The 200 also is planning more im-
provements: a home for wild ca-
nines called Wolf Woods, a new
children’s zoo, a huge African en-
vironment and a tropical com-

pound with crocodiles, snakes and

even sharks.

_ It’s an ambitious undertaking
- and one deserving of the kind
of support that allowed the zoo to
perfect that cool-ascice-cream
place to spend a hot summer’s
day, Northern Shores.

. The County and the Zoo I. 1

l

Elephants Play
éCatch With

here haven’t been many opportu-

‘ nities over the years to congratu-

late the Hillsborough County Commis-

sion for sticking to its role as a

policymaker and leaving the fine-tun-
ing to the county administrator.

i ‘ :Far too often, county commission--

ers' tried to run county government on
their own. And far too often their mo-
tivation was political power rather
than public service. '

" ‘So we feel impelled to compliment
the commissioners for the way they
handled the recent request from Low-
r’y ‘Park supporters for $5 million to
help finance the second phase of the
zoo renovation. '

The commissioners could have
completely snubbed that request be-
, cause the zoo is within the city limits.
_ But the commissioners didn’t do
that. They acknowledged some re-
sponsibility for the 200’s condition be-
cause 28 percent of Lowry Park visi-
tors come from the unincorporated
areas of the county. '

The commissioners could also have
ignored the $5 million request based
, on the county’s serious backlog in
I funding for essential services such as

law enforcement, firefighting and util- ’

ities. .

The commissioners didn’t do that
either.

But they also didn’t throw caution
to the wind by promising money to
this popular project. Knowing that
those two responsibilities —— to the zoo
and to more traditional county servic-
es —- must be carefully weighed, the
commissioners asked County Adminis-

trator Larry Brown to study the bud- ..

get and report back later on whether
the county can afford to help out in
the 200’s renovation, _

Brown is precisely the person who
should analyze that kind of request,
especially since next year’s county
budget is now in the process of being
hammered out.

The commissioners would do well
to continue in this vein in the future
- and to heed Brown’s advice after
he studies the alternatives on this and
all other proposals.

It is heartening that Hillsborough
County’s policymaking body is show-
ing signs of rejecting at last its poison-

_ ous old practices of bickering, bribery

and bumbling.

GUIDE TO GEORGIA - July 1987

Apple Tosser

Pitching machines have been
tossing the old “apple”. to base-
ball players taking batting prac-
tice for some time. But the
Washington Park Zoo in Port-

 

 

. land, 0re., has found a new use
1 for the Jugs Pitching Machine.

The machine is literally filled

with apples. But instead of hurl-

ing the apples to baseball play-

? ers, the machine winds up .for 11
" Asian elephants in posmon to
; catch a snack.

Jane Hartline, a zoo spokeswo-
man, said the zoo calls it aerobic ,
apple chasing. The elephants ‘
spend a "few minutes several
times a day chasing apples as
fast as they can.

Unlike baseball, the elephants
play their game rain or shine to
stay in shape. -

DENVER POST - June 23, 1987

By Paul Hutchinson
Denver Post Staff Writer ‘ - "

What began lastfsummer as an
investigation into“ illegal hunting
has resulted in a federal court case
involving methamphetamine, ille-
gal weapons, poaching and a “ren-
egade outfitter” who smoked mari~
juana from an eagle bone pipe.

In papers filedgin U.S. District
Court in Denver; a Colorado wild-
life investigator described the
strange goings~on at a hunting
ranch operated by, Lloyd Herrera,
a 38-year-old Vietnam veteran who
appeared in court Monday seeking
a postponemento‘f the trial.

Jay Sarason,“an agent for the
Colorado Department of Wildlife,

said he began the investigation last .

August when he met Herrera and

Oil. I ;

unting case involves

arranged to hunt elk during ar-
chery season. But when Sarason
arrived at Herrera’s ranch in Ar
chuleta County, Herrera told him
to forget about bows and arrows
and to hunt with a riﬂe, Sarason’s,
affidavit says.

Sarason described meeting a
group of six Texas hunters who ‘
bragged about shooting bull elks
during archery season while rely—
ing on Herrera as a guide. The
group feasted on meals of bear
meat and viewed photo albums
filled with snapshots of illegally
killed game animals, the affidavit
says.

In recorded telephone conversa-
tions with Sarason, Herrera
boasted about killing dozens of
deer out of season, and invited him

. - ur-LWM

frenegade outfitter? .

 

back to the ranch to do likewise,
the affidavit says.

During Sarason’s frequent trips
to the Herrera ranch last fall and
winter, he often observed Herrera
smoking marijuana cigarettes, ad-
ding that he watched as Herrera
opened his icebox and removed a
marijuana pipe carved from the
breast bone of an eagle. '

Herrera explained that he often .
hunted eagles for a nearby tribe of
Indians.

Whether Herrera actually was
an accomplished guide appears to
be questionable. Sarason described 2%
one hunting sequence in which
Herrera wounded an elk, then fired 1
eight to 10 additional shots at-
tempting to kill it. Each shot "

missed, and Sarason finally fin- '

ished the animal off with a single

. shot from his own riﬂe.

Sarason also described conver-
sations between Herrera and an-
other man concerning chemicals to
produce methanmhetamine, and .
finding a “coo ” to produce the

, drug.

The investigation concluded ear-
lier this year when state and feder-
al agents searched Herrera’s home.

Herrera, who is free on $75,000
bond, told court officials that 'he
was indigent. Rich Chow, a private
attorney, was appointed to defend ,.
him. On Monday, Chow asked U.S.
District Judge Jim Carrigan to
postpone Herrera’s trial until Sep-

tember, and to move it to Durango. ;

The trial originally was set to be!
gin next week. i _

TAMPA TRIBUNE - June 25, 1987

Small monkeys aid the __ _
disabled

By DEBORAH BLUMENTHAL
of The NY Times News Service

NEW YORK — It has been 10 years since an
innovative behavioral psychologist set out to
make life more bearable for a quadriplegic
friend. With a grant of $2,000 from the Tufts New
England Medical Center, Mary Jane Willard be-
gan training capuchins — organ-grinder monkeys
— to become the arms and legs of quadriplegics,
disabled people who have lost significant use of
all four limbs. The monkeys help them eat,
drink, read, listen to music or watch television —
in short, to live more independently.

The Boston-based non-profit program that
Willard founded and directs, “Helping Hands:
Simian Aides for the Disabled,” has proved itself
half a dozen times since then. And as the pro-
gram grows and interest mounts, Willard, 37, has
learned a lot about the needs of the handicapped.

“Each placement has functioned as a mini-ex-
periment, as new types of living situations, train-
ing techniques and methods of placement are
attempted,” she said in an interview at her Bos-
ton headquarters.

The quadriplegics and their families give the
program a high rating. Several spoke of greater
independence; many emphasized how the mon-
keys are almost pet-children that provide them
with love and devotion in addition to amusement
and even improved social lives.

Freeway (so named because she was found
on a freeway) “takes the edge off things and just
makes us mentally happier,” said Jewel Hutchin-
son, who lives in Carmichael, Calif., with her
daughter, Sherry, 30, avquadriplegic as a result of
an automobile accident seven years ago.

Sue Strong of Manhattan said of her small
monkey, Henrietta: "She now seems to be huge.
The size of her personality has grown onto her
physical appearance.” Asked if she feared losing
the monkey one day, she answered, “When you
break your neck, you’ re very tentative about en-
' joying things.” '

Such tentativeness does not seem to inhibit
the development of a powerful bond between
these monkeys and the humans they help. In-
deed, months after David Pearson’s death from a
heart attack, his capuchin monkey, Marylin, “sits
on his bed and kisses his picture on the bureau,”
said Mary Pearson, his widow.

The social effects of these relationships can

also be dramatic, according to a study by Judy'

Zazula, Willard’s colleague, who is a biomedical
engineer. Zazula observed a quadriplegic who
spent an'hour alone in a shopping center and
then spent an hour there accompanied by his
monkey. While he was alone, only two strangers
approached him to chat, when he was with the
‘ monkey, 71 did.

The Helping Hands prOgram, now affiliated

The animals allow quadriplegics to
live more independently, but the
program can help only a limited
number of them.

 

with the Boston University School of Medicine,
evolved during the last years that Willard
worked as an assistant to B.F. Skinner, the be-
havioral psychologist. To aid a quadriplegic
friend who “couldn’t eat, drink or even blow his

nose without a nurse,” Willard said, she thought

of training chimpanzees. But at 150 pounds,
chimps are unmanageable. Skinner suggested ca-
puchin monkeys, which weigh 7 to 12 pounds;
they are intelligent and they have good memo-
ries and life expectancies of about 30 years.

Which of the many species and subspecies to
choose was Willard’s first problem. She started
with a Cebus albifrons from a breeding colony
conveniently close to the Harvard School of Pub-
lic Health, where she then worked. In 1979 her
first trained monkey, Hellion, was placed with
Robert Foster, 25, of Watertown, Mass. The two
are together still. Hellion is a successful aide and
companion, but Willard decided that because the
albifrons monkey is so acrobatic, she would try
the tamest subspecies, Cebus apella.

So far, Helping Hands has placed 11 mon-
keys, and six of them remain. This year, five to
10 monkeys will be placed.

‘ Since Hellion was given to Foster, the Helping
Hands network has broadened. Financing is now
largely provided by Rehabilitation Research and
Development, a division of the Veterans Admin-
istration. There are also private donations, and
food is donated by Hills Pet Products of Topeka,
Kan.

Most of the monkeys for Helping Hands come
from the group’s Florida breeding center. The
cost of training, equipping and transporting each
monkey is about $8,000.

The program now has volunteers who raise
the monkeys in their homes for three years; 52
monkeys are currently with these “foster fami-
lies.” The monkeys are then trained for six
months by Willard’s small staff, including Zazula,
who is the only other full-time worker.

Behavior modification is used in training the
monkeys. Because quadriplegics have little or no
use of their limbs, they show the monkey which

object should be moved by means of a mouth-op- ,
erated laser-beam pointer attached to the wheel-
chair. They also give Oral commands. Proper .
performance is rewarded with praise and food or :
drink released through a dispenser on the wheel- .

chair.

The monkey’s basic repertory in helping :
quadriplegics consists of such tasks as operating “

lights; taking a sandwich from a refrigerator and
putting it on a tray; putting a thermos in a holder ‘
on a tray, opening it and inserting a straw; pick-
ing up a fallen mouth stick (used to dial a tele-
phone, to type or to turn a page); fetching arti-
cles like books and magazines; inserting tapes in
VCRs; combing hair, and wiping up spills.

To keep the animals away from areas where
they, might cause damage or harm themselves,
they are trained to avoid objects coded with
white coin-size stickers. If a monkey touches
something that is off limits, it hears a loud buzzer
and gets a tiny shock like the static electricity 3
person gets from a carpet; the shock comes
through a belt the monkey wears. Both signals
are operated from the wheelchair. Eventually
the buzz alone is enough to warn the monkey
away. » ‘

All the monkeys obey commands to return to
their cages, and all are paper-trained to their
cages. .

, Helping Hands has received applications for
monkeys from hundreds of the nation’s more

, than 80,000 quadriplegics. Because of the .pro-
ject’s small size, however, only a limited number
can be helped. Monkeys are not placed with peo-
ple who have small children because it is be-
lieved the children can perform many tasks for
handicapped family members. Moreover, mon-
keys are sometimes hostile to children. - ,~

Once placed, a monkey can take six months
to find its position in the family, Willard said: It
might fight with family members. Even after ad-
justing, the monkey might remain wary of outsid-
ers and might show hostile behavior. To prevent
harm, the monkeys’ teeth are extracted. -

Not all matches live up to expectations. One
monkey, m2:- eeamgaie, was placed with‘a boy
who, at 12, was tee yoeng and without adequate.
motor control to handle the responsibility."‘The
monkey liked everyone in the family except the
quadriplegic,” Willard said. The monkey will be
placed with another quadriplegic. i

A key to the program’s success is the,m,on-'
keys’ sharp intelligence and quickness to imitate.
In some situations, this can guarantee com'ic're-
lief free": the most difficult-life. Zazula recalled
visitng .5 ester and sitting in front of the televi~
sion areag with his monkey, Helliou, who gwas
riveted to the screen. 7 a -‘ ; ~

. ‘Iwc, Kong’ was on,” Zazula said, “and King
Kong had just reached out. and grabbed the stee-
ple off a building and flung it. Hellion madeythis
awful face. Then she reached out, grabbed a
light bulb off a table next to her and, just like
King Kong, flung it.” ' . . '

THE ANIMALS' AGENDA
June 1987

I Michigan animal advocates have
managed to thwart recent attempts by
Detroit Zoo director Steve Graham to turn
over a group of five Japanese snow
monkeys to animal researchers. The
monkeys had been targeted for sale
because they were rejected by other
primates in the colony, and there was not
enough space available to establish a
separate colony. The zoo attempted to
locate a buyer for the monkeys by adver-
tising in a primate clearinghouse publica-
tion, whose major audience is the
biomedical research community. After
learning of Graham’s plans for the
monkeys, the Michigan Coalition for
Animals (MCA) staged a protestat the
zoo on February 22, demanding that the
monkeys be sent to the South Texas

Primate Observatory, which already pro-

the zoo. The suit was dropped after
Graham agreed to send the monkeys to
the Indianapolis Zoo rather than to sell
them for research. Under Graham’s
leadership, the Detroit Zoo has had a
history of killing or selling for research
zoo animals deemed ”unsuitable" for one
reason or another. Examples include the
killing of eight Siberian tigers because

have plenty of other animals,

reputation of having the sexiest

Another spectacular exhibit at the zoo is Insect
World in a building devoted entirely to inverte-
brates. Tropical and native speCimens are shown in

a variety of displays designed to expose a previous--

ly unseen world to the public.

Roaming from building to building, the visitor
can view many‘other animals such as lions, rhinos,
hippos, elephants, giraffes, bears and birds. For a
little added enjoyment, plan a visit at feeding time.

There’s also a special area where Children can be

back to 1875 and is located
north of downtown at 3400 Vine

Visitors to the Cincinnati Zoo may remember the
rare white Bengal tigers. They have been a major
attraction since 1974 when three of these tigers
were born at the zoo, marking the first time in
many years that white tigers had been born in cap-
tivity in the United States. You can get a good view
of these big cats, weighing up to 500 pounds, roam-
ing the Big Cat Canyon.

In the Climbing Cat display are Persian leop-

Gorillas are big at the Cincinnati Zoo, too, in
more ways than one. Cincinnati holds the record for

her friends. .

Over the years, the Zoo has collected some 5,000
specimens of 628 forms of exotic mammals, reptiles,
birds, and fish.

Near the entrance, the zoo features a large com-

et pet food

 

By um: TALLEY

Business Writer

, There was a time when a scoop from
a big bag of dry animal feed —— perhaps
supplemented by table scraps -— was
' good enough for most pets.
But like the food many people are
buying for themselves these days, pet
food has gone gourmet — and pet own~
. er: increasingly are treating their dogs
and cats to an upscale menu;
“Gourmet pet foods are an offshoot of
your own lifestyle,” said John Harlow, a
. national account manager for Chicago-

based Selling Area Marketing Inc., a

market research firm.

“Do you eat Haagen Dazs ice cream,
give the dog leftover spaghetti, and feel
guilty? No, you figure he should eat as
well as you do,” he said. _

Indeed, gourmet pet foods with im-
proved nutritional formulas are selling
big. Whether it’s canned dog food pro—
cessed into the bites shaped like pork
chops or more palatable cat food
packed in convenient, single-serving
sizes, the products are being marketed
to pet owners of all ages with an eye for
quality rather low prices. Highly profit-
able for manufacturers and introduced
only a few years ago, such products now
make up 25 to 30 percent of the more
than $5 billion pet food market — and
no slowdown is in sight, Harlow said.

“Premium pet foods are the domi-
nant factor in the market, and you see
the same phenomenon with dry foods as

wet: the gravy, chewy morsel concept,” ,

he said.

The change has come about in part .

because of the way peeple perceive
their pets more as family members
than animals, experts said.

“When the dog is like a family mem-
ber and the family is eating well, they
say maybe we’d better buy the dog
something good, too,” said Roger W.
Spencer, a food analyst with Paine Web-
ber in Chicago. .

It is hardly just Yuppies who are
spending the money. “It would be a mis-
take to credit only young urban profes-
sionals for this trend,” said Ron Bot-
trell, a Quaker Oats Spokesman, who
adds that elderly people are just as like-
ly to spare no expense on their pets.

Paine Wehber’s Spencer agrees. “A
lot of empty-nesters adopt dogs instead
of children,” he said.

Aware of peOple’s perception of their
pets, manufacturers are targeting con-
sumers with improved pet food formu-
las that offer better nutrition, taste —

and plenty of eye appeal to pet owners.
Quaker Oats’ latest offering, for ex-
ample, is a canned dog food called Ten-

der Chops, with morsels shaped like lit- -

tle pork chOps. And the company’s tele—
vision commercials for Tender Chunks
-— Tender Chaps’ precursor -— show a
pair of hands carefully slicing each
chunk as if it were tenderloin.
Upscaling pet food calls for taking
other directions as well. Carnation’s TV

spots for its Fancy Feast cat food, for ,

~15 example, show. a white Persian cat
sampling the stuff from a crystal bowl.

And Gaines’ Cycle dog food is sold in

different nutritional formulaS, for PUP‘

pies, old dogs and fat dogs alike.

. , “With a lot of these pet foods, the way

they look is more for the owner’s sake
than the animal’s,” said Gale Czar-
necki-Mauldin, an assistant professor of

_ animal science at the University of Illi-

nois, one of only two agricultural col-

tleges nationwide that do research on pet

nutrition.

“Gourmet brands are usually more
digestible, and most of the brands on the
market are nutritionally adequate, but

' the average pet is overfed if anything,”

she said. ~

Perhaps so, but many pet owners ap-
pear unlikely to start cutting back on
Fido’s new—and-improved dinner, which
—— like human food -- increasingly is
being packaged in single—serving con-
tainers so there are no smelly leftovers.

And with gourmet pet food products
costing about 50 percent more, on aver-

age, than more commonplace fare, ,

manufacturers are delighted at the
boost their sale gives pet food profit
margins, which are already high com-
pared with food industry norms.

Ralston Purina sports a pretax profit
of about 20 percent, and the pet food in-
dustry earns at least 10 percent, Spen-
cer said. .

“Twenty-five years ago, premium
quality in pet food was not the big issue,
and it was marketed on price,” he said.

Now with the trend reversed, pet food

'manufacturer's are willing to spend

large sums to promote their new prod—
ucts. (

Carnation bolstered its advertising
outlay by nearly 60 percent, to almost
$7 million, in 1985 to pitch its Fancy
Feast cat food, while Quaker spent $30
million to introduce Kibbles ’n’ Bits ’n’
Gravy Bits, according to Advertising
Age . .

more every year.”

NEL - June 14, 1987

T "Meanwhile, the number of cats is ‘
grownng faster than the number of dogs.
And given the tremendous dollar value
pf the fragmented pet food market, it
Isnt surprising that companies allot
multimillion-dollar ad budgets for
gourmet cat food, the fastest growing
pet food sector, experts said. '
The cat population nationwide has in-
creased to about 50 million in 1985, the
latest figures available from the Pet
Food Institute, a Washington, DC. trade
group, from 37 million in 1980. The

: number of dogs has increased to about

d9 million in 1985 from about 46 million
in 1980.

. “Gaining a 1 percent share of a $5 bil-
hon market is worth $50 million, and
you can’t avoid spending on advertising
in a business where you have to create
demand,” Paine Webber’s Spencer said,
who adds that more gourmet pet foods
are sure to appear in grocery stores.

He said, “There will always be new
products: Look at all the breakfast cere-
al variety, and yet companies bring out

Reports of pit bull attacks mount

By Charles Simmons
USA TODAY

A Los Angeles animal con-.-

trol ofﬁcer was hospitalized in
good condition Monday, the lat-
est victim of a pit bulldog

The attack comes amid a
growing movement to ban or
restrict the combative breed.

Ofﬁcer Florence Crowell,
33, was bitten on the chest and
had a hand crushed while con-
firming a report that a man
and his 7-year-old daughter
had been attacked Sunday.

The girl required surgery,

her father was not hospitalized. '

A TV crew with Crowell

helped wrench the dog away.

Other recent attacks:

IIn Paw Paw, Mich., a 74-.

year-old woman repeatedly
was bitten last week.

I In Cambridge, Mass, a 5-
year-old girl almost had an ear
torn off in a Saturday attack.

I In Morgan Hill, Calif, tod-
dler James Soto was'killed by a
neighbor’s pit bull last week
He’s one of five killed in 1987.

“It’s the irresponsible own-
ers who are causing the prob-
lems,” said Randall Lockwood
of the US. Humane Society.

Los Angeles, like other USA

communities, is considering
control laws. Also:

I In Michigan’s Upper Pen-
ninsula, 3,000 residents have i
signed petitions to ban pit bulls. f

I Oregon passed legislation !
penalizing negligent owners.

Numerous owners are turn- ‘ ?

ing in their pit bulls to shelters. .

Also, owners are facing ,
more criminal charges and civ-
il lawsuits. An Atlanta pit bull
owner — in prison for involun-V
tary manslaughter — now
faces a $2 million wrongful
death suit .

Two other” owners are
charged with manslaughter.

07-year-old bOy mauled

by family’s pet pit bull _

 

By Diane R. Stepp
Staff Writer

A 7-year-old Powder Springs
boy was mauled by his family’s
pet pit bulldog Monday, police
said.

The boy, Kevin Bailey of For-
rest Hill Road, was bitten severely
about the shoulder and neck and
also had scratches and bites on
much ofthe restof his body as a
result of the attack at about 9:30
am, said Powder Springs Acting
Police Chief Rick Richardson.

The boy was treated at Cobb
General Hospital and released, ac-
cording to Richardson.

The dog had been chained in-
side a fence in the family’s yard
when another dog got into the
yard, Richardson said.

The 11-month-old male pit bull
broke his chain and went after the
other dog, he said.

As the boy and his mother
tried to catch their dog, the ani-

sat .

Cobb County animal control of-
ficers took the dog away to be de-
stroyed, said Richardson.

The family still has a 2%-
year-old female pit bull that was
not involved in the attack, accord-
ing to Richardson.

No charges were filed in the
incident pending further investiga-
tion, Richardson said.

The Powder Springs City Coun-
cil passed an ordinance this month
requiring additional fencing for
dan erous animals, he said, but
the aw does not take effect until
July 1.

Richardson said the dog that
attacked the boy had jumped at
the child’s grandmother Sunday,

and she warned the family then ;

that the dog was dangerous.

Cuibing Pups on Pickups
Is Unleashing Howls

 

‘ By Jay Mathews
Washington Post Staff Writs
PASADENA, Calif.
R usty, a multi-colored collie

 

of uncertain parentage,
loves pickup trucks. Even in
this teeming California suburb,
she adds a vivid, enduring image
of the great American West as she

stands tall and proud, the breeze ,

rippling her fur. in the back of her
owner’s blue Toyota 4X4.

But Rusty's high-riding days are
numbered. And this is not just a
matter of some particularly bad
bump on some future road.

With a suddenness that has deo
lighted Humane Society officials,
worried weekend truckers and
appalled political conservatives,
the state of California appears on
the verge of outlawing untethered
animals in the backs of pickup
trucks. Such a breathtaking as-
sault on Americana has not gone
entirely unchallenged, but a clever
compromise with farming inter-
ests, a growing number of county
dog-restraint laws and a myste-
rious report of 100.000 annual
animal deaths seem to have car-
ried the day.

Once victory in California is as-
sured, the anti-dog-irrtruck forces
anticipate taking their message to
the rest of the country, where re-
action has been mixed. Washing-
ton state and Oregon have passed
similar dog-restraint laws, accord-
ing to Barbara Cassidy of the Hu-
mane Society of the United
States. One restraint provision
died in the Maryland legislature.
Colorado legislators killed one af-
ter hearing sarcastic predictions

‘of further proposals for doggie

crash helmets.

After rejecting several at.
tempts, the California Assembly
passed its dog-in-the-pickup bill
last month, 50 to 19. The state
Senate appears likely to follow
suit. California pickup owners and
their dogs are resigning them-
selves to a severe change in life
style.

Jodie Steck, a wire-service ed-
itor who lives in South Pasadena,
said she has discussed the 'pro-
posed tethering law with Max. her
seven-year-old black Labrador-Ir-
ish Setter. “Max says if it comes
to that, he would prefer to ride in
the front with me," she said, even
though she has noticed that he is
distinctly uncomfortable up there.

Since being given Rusty—a
shelter foundling—two years ago,
restaurant manager Gregory
Holmes has been tying her with a
5-foot leash to the back of the

 

“The dogs are real
stable back there,
but they have to be
able to move
around on their

truck cab. Rusty-has enough rope
to roam the truck bed, as she likes
to do, or to leap over the side and
land on the ground if such a foolish
notion possessed her.

Under the proposed California
law, that arrangement would be
insufficient. The leash would have
to prevent the animal from leaving
the truck. Otherwise, a dog must
be carried in a closed container or
in the cab.

Donna Wefterer Pane, legisla-
tive assistant to the bill’s sponsor,
Assemblyman Jack O’Connell, a
Democrat from Santa Barbara,
said their office received only one
negative letter on the bill.

In the northern part of the
state. where Assemblyman Stan
Statham, a Republican from Redd-
ing, represents the huge, thinly
populated First District, the bill
has been intensely unpopular. Sta-
tham said he voted against it be.
cause there was no demonstrated

 

The Moot leash on Gregory Holmee’ dog. Rusty, does not meet the tethering bill’s requirement for pets in pickups.

need. Moreover, it threatens his
constituents’ life styles. And he
thought that the bill “had crossed

, the line" of government interfer

ence in private conduct.

Holmes, who named his dog af-
ter the Rusty Scupper restaurant
he manages, grew up in Colorado

. where dogs in pickups were plen-

tiful. He supports the use of re-
straints but does not know how he
would apply the new law to Rusty.

Steck calls the restraint bill in-
trusive and unnecessary. “The
dogs are real stable back there,”
she said, “but they have to be able
to move around on their four
legs.” A previous dog of which she
was less fond once leapt from her
truck before it had stopped com-
pletely but was unharmed. “She
was too retarded to notice, any-
way, ” she said.

To win at least the neutrality of -

farm and ranch groups, 0' Connell
agreed to include an exemption
for livestock or “a dog whose own-

‘ er either owns or is employed by a

ranching or farming operation.”
The law applies only to highway
driving, but covers farm and non-
farm dogs riding on an urban free-
way with a 55 mph speed limit.
The bill won a great boostfrom
a widely seen Los Angeles broad.
cast by television consumer advo-
cate David Horowitz, introduced
with the statement that “100,000
dogs will be killed or seriously in—
jured this year riding in the back
of open pickup trucks." Horowitz’s
researcher, Gloria Drexler, said
the figure was provided by the San
Diego Humane Society, which said
it was obtained from the American
Humane Association in Denver.

. Rich Meyer, an association staff
member, said he took the figure
from an official of the Animal Pro-
tection Institute in Sacramento.
That ofﬁcial recently resigned and
could not be reached. “1 am very
leery of that figure,” said Charlene
Drennon, director of the Humane
Society of the US. West Coast.

In 1982, the legislature ordered

accidents. Three such reports
were discovered in three years,
Highway Patrol spokeswoman Su-
san Cowan-Scott said. She noted
that the agency has never tried to
determine how many animal
deaths and injuries result from
pickup riding.

Vicki Young, an agent with the
Los Angeles office of the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, said she is certain there
are many such animal fatalities,
most unreported. Last week, she
saw a small German shepherd

When the‘traveler has four legs in-

be twice the usual challenge. But some

’ pet owners remain undaunted: They en-

in the pleasure and run.

Although much depends upon the
pet’s nature and the family's destina-
tion, traveling with an animal usually
isn’t easy and sometimes it isn’t simple.

But if you are contemplating doing
it, you might want to consider the fol-
lowing advice, assembled from a vari-

arations can make a
vacation with your pet memorable

Travel can be stressful for animals
because it is out or their ordinary rou-
tine. This is particuiariy true for very
young and very old animals, and them
with special problems. Having your vet-
erinarian give the animal a physical
checkup may help reduce the chance of
unexpected problems developing

Some people put their home address
and telephone number on the tag, but if
they are on vacation and thus not at
home, this information is not of much
use. Consider using another tag that has
the telephone number and addrses at
your destination point or the telephone
number and address of a neighbor who
will be at home.

mal with an ID tag that car-

Armenia Ave., Tampa, Fla. 33607.

o If you are traveling by car, consider using a car-
rier to contain the animal while under way.

“It’s much safer for the animal,” Delperdang says,
noting that it could protect the animal from being
thrown about the car’s interior, especially during sud-
den stOps or accelerations. She adds that dogs have a
“denning instinct” and generally feel safer when con-
tained. And if a cat is left loose in the car, “it can cause
real problems, such as getting under the brake pedal,”
Delperdang says.

Select a carrier large enough in which the animal is
able 'to stand up, turn around and lie down comfortably
— any larger and the animal might be thrown around
inside it. _

If your pet is not accustomed to being in a carrier,
familiarize the animal with it several days before the
trip. Put the pet in for 10 to 15 minutes each day,
gradhally increasing the time until the animal becomes
accustomed to it. You might even leave the carrier
open on the floor and let the pet get familiar with it or
take the animal in the carrier for a few short trips
arohnd the neighborhood. .

Lewis suggests that taking the animal for short trips
with frequent stops and starts before leaving on the
vacation may help overcome any tendency to become
car Sick.

o If possible, carry the pet's usual food and a jug of
its usual drinking water with you. Serve them in the
animal’s usual bowls. ‘

Pets’ digestive systems can be upset by strange food
and water when they travel, just as ours can. So, partic-
ularly in the case of water, gradually accustom the
~ animal to the change, adding the new water bit by bit
into the jug.

And remember that some canned foOd may spoil in
the" heat; and dry food is generally easier to transport.

And don’t feed the animal right before departure.

.. Don’t use tranquilizers on your animal unless you
consult with your veterinarian.

At least one expert thinks that if a pet is so nervous
it needs tranquilizers in order to travel, maybe it
shouldn’t be going.

'0 While driving, stop frequently —— every 90 min-4

utes or two hours — to allow the animal to get out,
exercise and relieve itself.

When you do, keep the animal on a leash. Delper-
dang notes, “Animals can easily become lost at rest
stops — and often do. Even a well-trained dog in unfa-
miliar surroundings will start exploring, may go off into
the woods, and go further and further in, and, without
familiar scents to lead him back, become lost.”

0 Don’t let the animal ride with its head out the
winddw. . .

It might look like fun, but it exposes the animal to
injury and risks its escape.

0 Take a “pet care package” with you.

It might include such items as a favorite toy from
home; an old blanket or rug with familiar scents; p as-
tic bags for picking up after the dog; disposable li er
pans for cats; and lots of paper towels.

0 Don’t leave your pet in a parked car.

"In Florida, we get a lot of visitors who don’t know
how intense the heat is,” Delperdang says, “and we get
complaints from attractions about people leaving their
animals in a car.”

If'you are going to stop and sightsee along the way,
consider the pet’s safety and health at every stop.

Some major attractions, such as Walt Disney World,
will make arrangements to kennel your animal while
you are visiting the site, but find out in advance of your

arrival.

0 Watch for signs of discomfort or sickness.

They might include constant agitation and restless-
ness, excessive salivation, total loss of appetite and se-
vere diarrhea. In some small degree, all of these
symptoms may be present just because the animal is
excited, but be wary if they become excessive.

0 Plan your overnight stops well ahead.

Don’t assume that your beloved pet will be welcome
everywhere. ..

Some lodgings permit pets, others do not. One help; ~
in separating the former from the latter is available
from The Gaines Dog Care Center in Kankakee, Ill. The .5
company recently published the 1987-1988 edition of
“Touring With Towser,” an 80-page directory listing,
among other things, hundreds of independently owned
hotels and motels and 10 nationwide chains with more
than 4,000 locations that welcome guests traveling with
pets.

For a copy, send a check or money order for $1.50
to: Gaines Booklets, “Touring With Towser,” P.0. Box
8172, Kankakee, Ill. 60902. ‘

And if you are planning to stay in national parks or
campgrounds, query them well in advance regarding
pet policies.

0 If you leave your pet in a motel or hotel room
while you are out, let someone know.

Leave a note or hang a “Do Not Disturb” sign on
the door, so that no one enters and is surprised by the
animal or lets the animal escape. .

You might leave the pet in its carrier while you are
out. That may be safer fortthe animal, as well as the
furnishings. ~

0 Check restrictions and regulations in the areas to
which you are traveling.

If you are traveling extensively in this country, car-
ry with you a health certificate from your veterinarian
verifying that the animal has had the necessary shots
and also is free of communicable diseases.

If you are traveling out of this country, you will
need no documentation taking your animal out, a
spokesman with the US. Customs Service in Washing-
ton, D.C., says. But coming back in, your dog will need
a valid rabies certificate, and both cats and dogs must
pass a visual inspection and “look healthy.”

Of course, other countries have their own require-
ments for animal entry and exit, so, in advance of de-
parture, you should contact the embassy or consulate of
the country you will be visiting to find out its regula-
tions; some require health certificates, some require
quarantine.

An excellent source of information on these matters
is the booklet "Traveling With Your Pet,” available by
sending $4 to the American Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals, Education Department, 441 E.
92nd St., New York, N.Y. 10128. The society has under-
taken the task of trying to assemble the restrictions and
regulations that pertain to traveling with pets in the 50
states of this country, as well as abroad. The booklet
also contains some general advice and information.

0 If you are not taking the pet in the family car,
check other transportation options well in advance.

Many buses, trains and cruise lines will not carry
pets at all. And the policy varies among the airlines.

Generally, air transport involves three options: in
some circumstances, a pet may travel with the owner
as carry-on baggage, in the cargo hold as checked bag-
gage accompanying a ticketed passenger, or alone. In
any case, make the arrangements early; try to avoid .
holiday and weekend travel when the airports are most
busy; and try to arrange direct, non-stop flights for the ,
animal’s trip.

Some companies specialize in arranging animal

”transport; one of .them is Air Animal Inc., 4120 W. Cy-

press St., Tampa. There, Millie Woolf says that the cost '
for the service depends upon such factors as the size of
the animal and its destination. For more information,
call 879-3210.

Humane societies ﬁle suit
for custody of chimpanzee

By Tom Beyerlein

.- WARREN COUNTY BUREAU

LEBANON — Kenneth Harris
had planned a big homecoming
party at his Train Stop Inn for
his pet chimpanzee, Sam.

He had put up colorful ribbons
' and a “welcome home” sign. He
had even planned to put ,on a
mock wedding between Sam
and his “girlfriend,” a chimp
named Susie who is owned by
Some friends.

But the party was canceled
and the wedding plans were put
on hold Tuesday.

The custody battle for Sam,
which Harris thought had ended
with his acquittal Saturday on a
misdemeanor charge of cruelty
to animals, began anew Tues-
day.

. Attorneys for the Humane So-
ciety of the United States and

the Humane Association of War- .

ren County filed a civil lawsuit
asking for permanent custody of
the 16-year-old chimp. Sam was
. taken from Harris on April 15
under a Human Society warrant.

The new lawsuit alleges Har-
ris neglected Sam by keeping

 

him in a dank cement enclosure
strewn with trash and body
wastes. An attached sworn
statement by Tina Nelson of the
Humane Society said Sam
smokes cigarettes and drinks al-
cohol at the tavern, in the War-

ter. .

whale research to halt
commercial hunting

"The Associated Press

BOURNEMOUTH, England —
In an attempt to keep countries
from carrying on commercial whal-
ing under the guise of research, the
United States has pr0posed checks
on scientific studies of the
mammals.

The politically sensitive propos-
al, made Monday as the 42-nation
Internatibnal Whaling Commission
opened its annual meeting, drew an-
gry responses from Iceland and Ja-

an. Those countries, along with
orway, are the whaling nations
most involved in the research.

Conservationists have deplored
scientific whaling, calling it a cover

The commission agreed in 1982
to a moratorium on commercial

f whaling beginning in 1986 to give

whale stocks a chance to recover. It

plans to re-evaluate the ban in 1990.‘

. The Soviet Union, Japan, Ice-
land and Norway initially rejected
the moratorium, saying that inter-
national scientific surveys showed
that whales were not facing extinc-
tion as the commission believed.-
The issue became so contentious
that Washington threatened to cut

. off fishing rights for some countries

near the U ..S coast. ,

In the last year, Japan and the
Soviet Union have halted commer-
cial whaling, but they said they sup-
ported whale hunting for scientific
purposes

Iceland’ 5 fisheries minister,
Halldor Asgrimsson, told the meet-
ing in this southern seaside resort
Monday that the US. proposal went
beyond the commission’s authority
and constitution. ._

He said Iceland was prepared to
take the issue to the International
Court of Justice in the Hague and
might withdraw from the
commission.

Akao Nobutoshi, an economist
from Japan’s Foreign Ministry, said:
“We don’t need this American pro-
posal and we don’t see the need for
a change.

“The American proposal violates

. Article 8 of the commission conven-

tion which says any government
maygrant its nationals a special
permit for taking whales for scien-
tific research,” he added. “If we re-
vise the convention it might be a

different matter, but this meeting

El
Conservationists have

ing, calling it a cover for

—

Anthony Calio, the US. whaling
commissioner, submitted the propos-
al that would set specific guidelines
for the review of research permits
by the commission ’3 scientific.

committee. .
Under the proposal, the coun-

tries hunting whales would have to
report the results of their research
and show how the studies contribut-
ed to the assessment of whale
stocks.

Calio said the commission would
recommend that a research permit
not be issued if the scientific com-
mittee believed the study did not fit
the guidelines.

Nobutoshi said there were
strong feelings in Japan about pres-
sure to stop whaling.

“Ours is a long tradition, going
back centuries, and whale-meat eat-
ing is part of our culture as it is
with the Eskimos,” he said.

“There are 1,000 peeple in our
”whaling industry, 3,000 more direct-
ly dependent on it and 50,000 more
engaged in distribution of the
products."

The Japan Whaling Association
denounced the US. pr0posal as “a
contentious, scientifically unsound,
presumptuous, ideologically tainted
and tricky piece of work designed
to disrupt the scientific research re-
quired ”by the moratorium
provision.

Sydney Holt, a British marine
biologist, said in an interview that
he believed whales were “in a much
worse state than we used to think
- half the problem is that we are
very ignorant of their numbers.”

He said that before modern

commercial whaling began, there
were about 250,000 blue whales.
' “We thought when they were fi-
nally protected about 20 years ago
that there were some 10,000 left,”
Holt said. ‘fIn the last seven years
the commission carried out direct
counts in the Antarctic of minke
whales and the estimate of the blue
whales that were seen was only
1,000, so we are still being over-
Optimistic.”

Mix-up at Humane Society leads

By Ron Taylor
Staff Writer

 

Stuart Spradley says he was re-
lieved last Sunday when he learned
that neighbors had taken his run-
away puppy to the Atlanta Humane
Society,.but his mood turned to an-
get when he determined later that
the 4-month-old dog had been put to
death. '

“Anybody who would put that
dog to sleep would have to be
asleep themselves,” said Spradley,
an Atlanta car service manager, de-

scribing his pet as an “extremely
healthy, very active” dog.

Bill Garrett, executive director
of the Humane Society, conceded
Wednesday that a mixup in identifi-
cation apparently led to the wrong
animal being killed. “We "do every-
thing we can to avoid something
like this happening,” said Garrett,
“but we are going to foul up
occasionally.”

Part of the problem, according
to Garrett, was that Spradley’s dog
was almost identical in appearance
to another dog that had been identi-

fied by the society’s veterinarian as
suffering distemper, an incurable
respiratory infection.

According to Garrett, both dogs
were mixed-breed Labrador retriev-
ers, both were black with small
white spots on their chests, both
weighed about 21 pounds and both
were females. “It’s very unusual to
have two dogs in here at the same
time that are that close,” he said.

When Spradley went to the Hu-
mane Society to pick up his dog 7
Sunday, he‘ says, workers presented
the other dog as his, but he told

_ to death of, wrong puppy 1

them it was the wrong animal.

Garrett says records indicated

the dog was Spradley’s, but he

granted that the records apparently
had been confused. Garrett said he
was investigating how the mixup oc-

. curred, noting that this past week-

end had been busy, with 167 dogs
brought in Saturday and another 67
Sunday. _

When dogs are brought in to the
animal shelter, Garrett explained,

they are assigned a number and are
fitted with either a paper or chain
; collar bearing that number, which is

recorded on a lost animal report.
Dogs occasionally lose those col-
lars, according to Garrett, in which
case a description of the animal is
relied upon for identification.
Garrett said lost dogs are kept
for at least three days — seven
days if they are wearing identifying
tags — before it is decided whether
they should be placed for adoption
or be destroyed if they are un-
healthy. The dog that was diagnosed

as suffering distemper had been in .

the shelter about two weeks, Gar-
rett said.

If your car hits a dog, Call police

 

Dear Readers: 1

This entire column has gone to V
the dogs, so if you aren't interested
in the subject, skip me today and
go read something else.

Dear Ann Lenders:

Someone asked you an exec!-

‘ lent questibn recently: ”What .
shOuld a person do if he or she hits ~
a dog while driving on a busy highway?" You should
have answered “Report it to the nearest police sta-
tion.‘

Instead. you telephoned Dr. David Epstein.
D.V.M., of the Northview Animal Hospital and asked
his advice. He said: “If you can get out of your car
and go to the dog without risking your life, do so. If
the dog is alive tie its mouth with a stocking or a belt
so -it won’t bite. If the dog is wearing a collar, notify
the owners.

That was a dippy answer, Ann. Can t you just see
these people on a busy highway. taking off their
stockings and belts to tie shut the mouth of an ani-
mal who is in terrible pain? Or better yet, looking for
a dog tag with the owner’s name on it?

I suggest that if any of your readers hit a dog they
should call David Epstein, D.V.M., of the Northview
Animal Hospital and let him take off his stocking or
belt and tie the dog 5 mouth up.

- R. M. K., Brentwood. N. Y.

I doubt that Dr Epstein could make it in time
from Chicago to New York but in all fairness let me
tell you that the good doctor also said. ”Call the po-
lice or the anti—cruelty society." Thanks for writing.

Dear Ann Lenders:

I m sure after you printed that letter warning peo-
ple about the dangers of pit bulls you heard from a
lot of folks who have had some terrible experiences
with that breed. Here 5 mine:

One evening a few months ago. our backyard

 

neighbor‘ s pit bull forced its way through the fence
that separates our properties. Fortunately, we were
home at the time.

We heard some loud barking. ran outdoors and
there was the neighbor's pit 'bull lunging at the
throat of our old, lame German shepherd mutt. My

' husband and I tried to pull the pit bull off Pal. Mean-

while we were frightened to death that if we freed

-_1 Pal, "the pit bull would attack us next.

After about five minutes of frenzied struggle, the
dog owner's wife heard our screams. climbed the
fence and got the pit bull to let loose of Pal.

Aside from the fact that our two children were in
the yard when the dog attacked, the scariest part is
that the man who owns the dog never bothered to
check on the condition of our dog or to apologize for
what happened.

My mild-mannered, animal-loving husband told
me in no uncertain terms that if it happens again he
will get out his gun and shoot the pit bull. I wouldn’t
blame him.

-- C.P. in Sylmar, Calif.

Thank you for sharing your story. It’s hair- rais-
ing. Incidentally yours was one of many Read on.

Dear Ann Lenders:

Nobody can tell me anything I don’t know about
pit bulls. My brother bought one against the wishes
of Mom and Dad. He said they are dangerous only
when trained to attack; otherwise they are as gentle

'as any other breed. (This dog was a puppy.)

One morning. for no reason whatsoever, the dog
lunged at me and I ended up with 104 stitches in my
face. I consider myself lucky to be alixe.

— Mauled in Midland, Texas

A dozen or so pit bull owners wrote to say their .

dogs never attacked unless provoked. Hundreds of

readers claimed this is not true. I believe them.

Jury in animal- cruelty trial visits chimp

A

Officials accuse Harris of making his pet smoke cigarettes ~
and drink beer to amuse bar patrons.

Harris, who has been charged with cruelty to animals,
denies the charges. The 16-year~old chimp has been Harris’ .
pet the past four years.

Harris’ attorney, James Sheets of Lebanon, maintains Sam
was better off with Harris than he has been since mid-April,
when the Humane Society of the United States’ regional

we... having ‘ pit banana

in wake of reports on attacks ..

DENVER POST
June 11, 1987

The Associated Press

SAN FRANCISCO — Pit bull-
dog owners are having their pets
killed in the wake of publicity over
several vicious attacks and abuse
from fearful neighbors, animal
control officials said Friday. .

‘ “There’s just hysteria in the
community right now,” said Kathy
Snow of the Santa Clara County
Humane Society, where seven pit
bulls were turned in for euthanasia
within three days of the fatal
mauling of a 21/2-year-old Morgan
Hill boy last Saturday.

Ms. Snow said usuallyno more
than three dogs a week are turned
in for death by lethal injection, and
those are usually strays. Several of
the pit bulls had belonged to their
owners for years.

“These dogs are in some cases
getting unfair treatment,” she said.
“People are overreacting. I have
known some pit bulls who make
lovely house pets, and I hate to see
them maligned.”

Three dogs were dropped off at
Marin County Humane Society this
week to be put to death. One own-
er, who had kept the dog for eight
years, said it was too aggressive.

Another of the dogs had many
scars and was so vicious that Hu-
mane Society officers have been
unable to touch it. The dog was
left in a cage Monday night.
night.

The attack on the Morgan Hill
boy has prompted not only fear but
renewed calls in many communi-
ties for restrictions on the breed.

Owners of pit bulldogs in San

Francisco say they are being

abused by neighbors while they“ '

walk the dogs, according to Rich— '
ard Avanzino, president of the San
Francisco Society for Prevention ,
of Cruelty to Animals.

One dog owner was Sprayed .
with a garden hose, and in several
other cases peOple have yelled ob-
scenities.

Avanzino called the reactions
“mob psychology.” He added, “I’m,
advising people who walk their pit
bulldogs to do it in the wee hours
of the morning when nobody else is,
out.” .-

He said in most cases fears are
unfounded. He called pit bulldogs
“gentle, loving, kind and great
companions,” but with a major
flaw. “It will fight to the death for
the owner if it is so trained.” '

In Alameda, city animal con-'
trol officials take a different view
of the dog, and for the last three
years have advised people against
keeping them because of liability
risks. '

more likely to bite, but unlike a pit.

Warren, animal control director.

A municipal judge in Pine

of 17 pit bulls confiscated last
month in a barn believed used for
illegal dog fights.

, LEBANON -- Sam was described in

court testimony Saturday as a former
member of a motorcycle club, and a
beer-guzzling, cigarette-smoking slob
who was being groomed to be a
womanizer. . ;

At the same trial, Kenneth Harris .

was found not guilty on a second-de-
gree misdemeanor charge of cruelty to ‘
animals. Jurors decided Sam, a 16-year- ,

old chimpanzee, should be reunited
with his owner. .
The four-man, four-woman jury in
the Warren County Court of Judge Paul
Herdman returned the verdict Saturday
evening after deliberating for about
11/2 hours.
“I feel great,” Harris said after the
verdict. The owner of the Train Stop ,
Inn in Foster said he intends to throw a .
party for Sam as soon as he his released ‘
from a cage in Columbus where he is

being held. ,

years ago from a group of motorcy-

that he had been trying gradually to
reform the chimpanzee, who enter-
tained visitors outside his inn.

first acquired him, but Harris said Sam
was down to about two cans of beer a
week at the time he was taken by War-
ren County sheriff’s deputies on April

he had been rejected by zoos and other
places.

“Nobody else would have him,” Har-
ris said.

However, Glenn Schmidt, an animal
trainer from Cincinnati, testified he
was hopeful that his 31/5-year-old
chimpanzee, Suzy, might eventually
strike up a courtship with Sam.

Schmidt testified that during their
monthly visits, Sam appeared well-fed
on a diet that included “monkey
chow,” apples, bananas and peanut-
butter sandwiches. He said Sam’s cage,
which included a TV, radio, refrigera-
tor, and swing was never dirty. During
his last visit with Sam, Schmidt said’
the chimp was enjoying country music.

Responding to citizen complaints,
the Humane Society of the United
States asked for a search warrant to
pick up Sam. ..

Harris was charged with depriving
Sam with sufficient sustenance and
failing to provide him with sufficient
food and water.

Tina Nelson, an official with the hu-
mane society, was the first witness
called Saturday. She testified that she
visited the tavern last March 13 with
three other women and last April 14
with two women. '

During the first visit, Nelson testified
Harris offered to rent Sam for two
hours to entertain at a birthday party.
During both visits, Nelson testified,
Sam was kept in a cage that was lit-
tered with debris and smelled of urine

and feces. . '

She said Sam was smoking ciga-
rettes “one after the other,” on the day
of Harris’ arrest. . '

He said he agreed to take Sam after f cage every other day, but noted Sam

‘1 was capable .of messing it up within
._ minutes. He said Sam especially en.
joyed hosing down the cage, which is in

the basmeent of a burned-out home
near Harris’ bar.

Harris said he and Sam had nearly
completed an expanded cage over the
basement at the time of his arrest. He
said Sam worked with the pliers.

Harris said Sam would draw about

' 2,000 to 3,000 visitors each weekend.

“He loves people. He loves kids. And
= people like him,” Harris said.
E Harris said he has been visiting Sam
in Columbus and is determined to get
“him back.
i “I’m not about to give up Sam,” he
said.

‘PROJECT X’: Animal rights activists claim chimpanzees, such as Virgil, were mistreated

during ﬁlming. The allegations have been denied.

Technician charges that chimps
were abused on set of ‘Project X’

The Associated Press '

_ LOS ANGELES -- Trainers clubbed chimpanzees
uSed in the movie “Project X,” a movie technician said
Thursday, but the trainer said the chimps were well-
treated and that animal rights activists were on a mis-
guided crusade. . ”

“I’ve seen them hit the chimps with blackjacks,"
; said Paul Mueller, a special-effects technician on the
? motion picture and the first person to volunteer an eye-
: witness account of the alleged abuse at a news confer-
; ence with game show host Bob Barker.
“Project X” trainer Hubert Wells told reporters,
‘ however, that animals were never mistreated, that
‘ trainers do not use clubs or blackjacks, and the allega-
“ tions were ridiculous.

“No animal, and no one on. the set, was hurt,” Hard-

. en said.

“Somebody has to have a cause and somebody will
go after a cause,” Wells said of Barker’s crusade. “His
staff is gomg after it. I don’t know why Mr. Mueller
said that. All the allegations are untrue.”

“Project X” producers Walter Parkes and Lawrence _

Lasker said late Thursday the charges by Barker and
others were “so filled with inaccuracies and gross mis-
statements of fact as to not merit a point~by-point
response.”

The movie, starring Matthew Broderick, is about a
young Air Force pilot who saves a group of chimps
from a terrible experiment. .

' An investigation by the American Humane Associa-
tion, which monitors treatment of animals on movie
sets, found no evidence chimpanzees were beaten or?
mistreated during filming of “Project X.” Association 1
official Carmelita Pepe had characterized the allega- 4.
tions as “a rumor that somehow grew.” .

. JUNEAU, Alaska—hThe re-
mains of 19 to 30 bald eagles
have been found at a logging
camp garbage dump, where
they apparently were shot while
perching in trees, the Fish and
Wildlife Service reported.

“T he place is littered with
eagle feathers and bones,” agent
Jerry Cegelske said Friday after
returning from the LaBouchere
'Bay camp on Prince of Wales.
Island, about 75 miles north-
west of Ketchikan.

Thirteen dead eagles were
found in 1983 at the same site.

, Bald eagles are protected by
federal law. Killing one is a
:7 crime punishable by up to a
'v $5,000 fine and one year in pris-
' on for a first offense and up to
$10,000 and two years in prison
;, for subsequent offenses. In

~ ;1 cases where less evidence is

’ available, the Fish and Wildlife

', 'Service can seek a civil penalty
of $5,000.

NEW YORK --, It’s a jungle out there,
and on Thursday it was more so than
' usual in New York as an unsuspecting
’ thief nabbed a van carrying two white
tigers in midtown Manhattan.
1 The van, its costly cargointact, was
recovered hours later in the Bronx, af-
ter a frantic, televised appeal by illu-
sionists Siegfried and Roy.

The rare tigers, worth $125,000 and
insured by Lloyds of London for $2 mil-
lion, were pronounced “fantastic” by
owner Roy, who was reunited with the
,‘ lO—month—old, llO—pound cats at a po-

lice station after speeding to the inner-

city neighborhood in a limousine.
Appropriately, the cats’ hectic day
turned into a media circus, and resi-
dents who thought they had seen it all
‘were bemused at having tigers in their
inner-city neighborhood.
“Well, I’ve been happy,” one woman
, said while leaning out her window. “The

SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER - June 14., 1987

 

" Hearing dogs for the

OXY, A SKINNY 5year-old fox terrier, will

never replace Spuds MacKenzie as the Vanna

White of the doggie world. But to Calvin Gee,

little Foxy’s looks mean absolutely nothing.
Thanks to her special training, Foxy has become
Gee’s main helper in a lifelong struggle against
terrible odds.

. Gee, a 26year-old San Franciscan, is deaf and
suffers from cerebral palsy. About a year ago. Gee
and Foxy were paired by the San Francisco SPCA’s
Hearing Dog Program. Since then, Gee said in a
recent interview, his difficult life has taken a major
turn for the better. "

“The first time I met her, I smiled and felt happy
inside,” Geetold me through sign-language
interpreter Nina Gelfant of St. Benedict’s '
Interpreting Center. “Foxy really helps me out and
makes me feel better. If something happens, the dog
will let me know. If the doorbell rings, the dog comes
and pulls on my leg. If people are talking, she hears
that. Because of Foxy, I live in my own apartment
now and do my cooking and cleaning myself.”

' Our interview took place at the Hearing Dog
"Program’s office on the roof of the Society for the
Prevention-of Cruelty to Animals building at 16th and
Alabama streets. The building is a joyous place to
visit. The workers are welcome to bring their pets
from home, so the office is strewn with adorable
dogs. (Although it’s wise not to sit in any of the chairs
while wearing black pants, as I found out to my dry

‘ cleaner‘s enrichment.)

. The Hearing Dog Program’s conference room is
lined with happy portraits of deaf people and their
hearing dogs. You can see the emotional bond
between human and dog in the people’s faces.
Looking at the photos, I noticed that, in contrast to
guide dogs for the blind, who are invariably big,
hearing dogs are small.

“We choose the dogs for the work they’re going to
do,” explained Lisa Van Loo, 26, who trains the dogs.
“Hearing dogs do a lot. of jumping on their masters to
alert them to things. We can’t have a loo-pound dog
jumping on someone.”

Despite their size, hearing dogs have exhibited
more than their share of heart. One dog heard the
hiss of a flat tire and alerted its deaf master, who
pulled off the freeway in time to avert a horrible
accident. Another brought its master, a freshly
minted parent, into a bedroom where the newborn
baby was choking. A third heard sniper fire from a
nearby rooftop and led its master to cover.

i Those are the remarkable stories. But the

, everyday work of the hearing dog is equally heroic.

They are trained to lead their masters to the phone or .

doorbell when they ring. They go bonkers, as trained,
when a smoke alarm sounds. They understand sign
language. And, of course, they offer love to people
who often feel sealed up inside a loveless world. That
requires no special training.

In its nine-year history, the Hearing Dog Program
has placed 282 dogs with deaf clients. The dogs are
recruited from the last-resort enclosures at animal
shelters around the Bay Area. Talent scouts from the
program look for curious, happy, outgoing,
peopleoriented dogs. When chosen, the hearing-dog
candidates are all just days from being put to death.

Clients are referred by service agencies for the
deaf or may simply contact the program and request
a dog. (The phone number is (415) 5543020 for voice
and (415) 55430.22 for TDD, the telecommunications
device for the deaf.)

It takes 16 weeks of rigorous training and costs
$5,000 to $7,000 to prepare a dog for placement.
Beyond a nominal $100 fee, all expenses are paid by
small charitable clubs and organizations. Calvin Gee’s
Foxy, for example, is sponsored by the California
State Association of Emblem Clubs.

Foxy was not recruited in the usual manner. She’d
belonged to an elderly East Bay man who died.
Unable to bear the constant reminder of her
husband, the widow asked Becky Woodruff, the
Hearing Dog Program’s training supervisor, to find
the dog a good home.

Foxy was immediately put into doggie boot camp.
In addition to high-level obedience, she was trained to
alert her master by running back and forth between.
the sound source and the master when the phone or ,
doorbell rang or when someone knocked on the door.
She was taught to become a canine smoke alarm in
visual echo of the real thing. She learned the sign
language commands for “sit,” “heel,” “come” and
"out.” Since living with (ice, Foxy has also learned

 




 

learn a language of love

 

 

. Examiner / John “Storey

Calvin Gee gets a kiss from Foxy as Lisa Van Loo, left, and Ralph Dennard look on

the sign command for “sleep.”

After four months of training, Foxy was
introduced to Calvin Gee. The Hearing Dog Program
teamed Gee and Foxy, said trainer Van Loo, “because
Calvin needed an active dog, a strong work dog, one
that would help him achieve independence. And
Foxy has short hair, so Calvin, with his cerebral palsy, .
doesn’t have to do too much grooming.”

Gee, who graduated from the Berkeley School for
the Deaf, has a janitorial job at Toolworks, the
wonderful jobplacement program for the disabled
that is headquartered on Harrison Street. Until he
met Foxy, Gee needed the constant home supervision
and companionship of his mother, Setsu Gee, a San
Francisco clinical psychologist.

' “The dog has helped him mature a lot,” Setsu Gee
told me. “He’s learned he’s got to take care of himself
and another creature. Before, I’d never consider

 

going out of town on business and leave him alone,
but now I go. I’m still apprehensive because I’m a
mother, but I go. And now Calvin has moved down to
our in-law apartment. He’s living on his‘own. It’s
interesting how the dog brings out the little boy in
the man and the man in the little boy.”

“Deaf people aren’t helpless,” trainer Van Loo
commented in the course of our conversation. “There
are other ways they can be helped than with dogs.
They can rig up a light bulb, for example, that flashes
when the phone rings. But, you know, you can't hug a
light bulb.”

As Calvin and Setsu Gee were leaving the Hearing
Dog Program’s conference room after our interview,
Calvin came back to sign a f inal message through
interpreter Gelfant:

“I love my dog,” Calvin signed, smiling. “I love
Foxy.”

~ ,3" . account, a man’s sworn testimony in Whichhe

i describes having seen the chimpanzees _
beaten by their trainers with clubs, blackjacks

and their fists." He declined to name-the ‘ H k 1
witness. ' . . ‘,

American Humane Assn. Director 3
Carmelita Pope called Barker “sincere,” but 1,
strongly disputed his contention. “We did our:
own investigation and after three weeks 3
found no substantiation to any of the ‘

illegations. I thought we’d settled the dust
ere."

The animal rights issue has also affected
Barker’s personal life. He is a vegetarian,
although he eats fish and dairy products, and
his suits are custom-tailored to eliminate the

" need for leather belts. However, he does wear
leather shoes. .

 

 




“I’ve always loved animals, had dogs and
cats as a kid," said Barker who had “an
absolutely Tom Sawyer-like boyhood
growing up in South Dakota. “I had

contributed to animal-oriented organizations, .

~ but I had never been active until about eight
or nine years ago when I was invited to ,
participate in ‘Be Kind to Animals Week. . . .
As I participated more—I went to meetings
and I heard lectures and saw films and Iread
books—I became aware of the exploitation of
animals, and I felt compelled to do what I
could. So I’ve become more and more ..
involved until now it is a passion with me.

His late wife inﬂuenced him. “Dorothy .10

was ahead of her time. She stopped wearing
fur coats before I ever was deeply mvolved.

She had a mink, then I remember I bought her .
a full-length leather coat, and she never wore ;

that. She was a vegetarian long before I was.”

Barker is “mostly concerned about the
abuses and excesses of animal . .
experimentation-—vivz'section,” he said fairly
spitting out the word, about “factory farming
where chickens are packed in so closely
together that when they die there’s not

 

nuggets. .

them into an area I think they’ll be

comfortable with. The man from
Georgia, he just looked like he j
might be fun,” said of one recent -

contestant. “As soon as he opened

his'mouth, I realized he had a nice "-‘
smooth Southern accent, so I want- 5

ed himto talk.

“The man who picks the contes-l ,

tants is Phil Wayne, one of the
producers," Barker added. “When
he first joined the show, I gave him
some guidelines: On most shows
where they preselect contestants,

' they’ll choose people who for the

most part are between 20 and 40

‘ and physically attractive. The first

enough room for them to fall over,” and: about

the “cruelty" in killing animals for f9.”- _- .

 

 

 

drying up in most of the world,” he 3
said."It’s almost ceased to exist in ,
France, in Holland or Belgium and ,
the Scandinavian countries. In ‘:
Scandinavia, a man or woman _'
wears a fur coat at the risk of being i
spat upon. So all the pelts,” he 5
added with disgust, “are being sent '3
to the United States." ;

Asked whether the purpose of ‘
animal experimentation isn’t to ad-
vance knowledge about diseases s
and prolong life, Barker replied 3
confidently: “That’s a myth that ,
has enabled people to make mil-
lions of dollars from animal suffer- ,
ing. Absolutely. I do not have the
scientific background to present
the arguments as well as it could be i
presented, but I have materials at :
home. . . . I’m a total abolitionist. ,
I’m against all experimentation.”

Only recently, he said, did he 1
decide “to do something about the .
cruelty to animals in the entertain-
ment industry.” Thus, his action on
the Patsy Awards and “Project X.”

With all this going on, it's no
wonder that when talking about
“The Price Is Right,” Barker .
sounded a bit bored. The host of ’
television’s highest-rated daytime
game show—and longest~running
on a single network—has been on
national TV since his “Truth or
Consequences” debut on NBC Dec.
31, 1956. The current incarnation of

1 the “The Price Is Right” debuted in
.' 1972. And he’sbeen with it ever
since._

“I like to try to create spontane-

7 ous laughter with these unre-
hearsed contestants, so each show ,
' for me is like mining for gold,” he ;
began. “I’m looking for the little ,

thing I told Phil was to forget that
completely, because I can have a
wonderful time with people in their
608, 708—I’ve even had people in
their 80s on the show. And I told
him that if he chose an older person
and it didn’t work, I’d never criti-
cize him, because I want him to
take chances.” ‘

Barker has to be fast on his feet.
When it turned out that one con-

‘ testant was a sheriff the other day,

he grinned: “You here on busi-
ness?”

Asked about his animals, Barker

warmed to conversation. Out

At home in the Hollywood Hills, he
has a gray cat named Poncho, and
two dogs, “and I’m sure if you name
your favorite breed, it’s represent-
ed in my dogs. I have two strays,
Lupe and Federico. I’ll tell you
about Federico. . .

“I was riding down a street'
where a little dog had been run
over and killed. The body was lying
there on a very busy street. And I
went to pick up this little body and
a little dog growled. I picked up the
body and this dog came over to me.

He was protecting the body, he was ;

Federico. ‘-
“I had tried to get Federico to go

friend. So I picked up the body and

put it in my car, and he jumped in

thought, ‘Little man, with that '

Barker’s 90-year-old, mother,

what people are saying, and lead j

who lives in an apartment attached
to his house, had a stroke last year.

. “She has a hospital 353d. sexen;

nurses on shifts, and Federico goes

:' and gives her: a kiss to get her

Lupe, she’s about 8 years old, and

playing like a puppy now. Federico
" is just a‘wonderful breeze.”

Poncho. another stray, joined the
Barker household after he suffered '

. an abscess to his head. Barker saw .

him through three operations. At

.. the time, he had two other cats

with whom Poncho fought. “Pon-
cho used to come over here to the
studio with me because I wanted
him to have more chance to run. He
had, his own CBS tag. Now he gets
along with Lupe, but Federico;
chases him, so I’m working with .
Federico. I put him on a leash and
try to get them together. I’m a
much more successful animal
rights activist,” he laughed, “than I
am an animal trainer.”

Barker leads “a very quiet pri-
vate life," says his cousin Mary
Bryant, an accountant for the Los
Angeles Philharmonic. “He doesn’t
run around a lot. He's not your

' basic Hollywood type.” ,

Barker is "a very private person
offstage,” says “Price Is Right"
producer Roger Dobkowitz, who’s
been with the show since its cur-
rent CBS inception. “He doesn’t
have people over, he doesn’t have
parties. I always attributed that to
the extremely happy home life he
had with Dorothy Jo. I’m a loner
and he’s a loner. I finally got to his
house about a year ago, when I had
to deliver something.”

Dorothy Jo’s imprint is all over
the Spanish-style house, from her
handmade beaded flowers and nee~
dlepoint tapestries to the china
figurines the couple collected. On
the main living—room wall is a huge
rug, half of it hooked by his wife,
half by his mother. The house is, of
course, animal~compatible. If Pon-
cho tears up a footstool’s tapestry,
Barker forgives.

“If you like cats, you’ll adore

Poncho," said Barker, plopping him

on a visitor’s lap.

“He seems to sense my mother’s
not well,” he said. "She can do
things to him, no one [can]! If I:

Medicine Needs These Animals

_-_.As.apatient-advocate, both in and out of.

the operating room, I feel a responsibility to
protect the rights of patients to medical
advances resulting from animal research. Had
the animal legislation now pending in Con-
gress been enacted when I began my career,
it would have prevented me from developing

.a number of lifesaving procedures in my
research laboratory.

Instead of restoring thousands of patients
to a normal life and a return to productive
work, my colleagues and I would have been
helpless to offer many of our patients any real
hope at all. This legislation, known as the
Mraaekbill, seekstobantheuseofpound
r-’ r i for any research supported by the

2... inal Institutes of Health, the chief source ,-

, woods for biomedical research In this come
try. Are we now to hold human health hostage
to the rights of abandoned animals to be killed
in pounds?

Even with today’s technology, I could not
have developed on a computer the roller
pump that made open-heart surgery possible
or the artificial artery that restored to health
previously doomed patients with aneurysms.
Nor could we have attempted the first suc-
cessful coronary artery bypass or implanted
the first temporary mechanical heart, with
which we saved a patient’s life two decades

ago.

Would animal-rights activists have objected
to the first kidney, heart or liver transplant?
Would they forgo the protection humanity
enjoys today against poliomyelitis, tetanus,
diphtheria and whooping cough r the treat-
ment for strep throat, ear infections, bronchi-
tis and pneumonia—all products of animal
research? Would they have denied the 11
million diabeties the right to life that insulin
has given them—or victim: r’ r .r the help
they have received from radiation and chemo-
therapy?

It was in monkeys that the deadly AIDS
virus was isolated and that isolation is the
initial step :7 int. ..-timate development of a
vaccine Would tin rir':-\al- "‘2hts activists halt
that research _and~allow an up. mic to rage
unopposed? '

The truth is that there are no satisfactory
insentient ~. . dels at present for certain types
of bit. ned'tal research and testing. A comput-
er is not a livir g system and would not have
produced the Irarnatic medical advances of
the past few decade 3.

' Only about 1 percent of abandoned dogs
are released for research. If pounds are such
a meager source of research animals, you
may ask, why am I concerned about losing
that source? My reasons are well founded.
. Not only are pound animals of particular value
in research on heart and kidney disease, brain
injury, stroke, blindness and deafness, but a
ban on their use could have grave and
. far-reaching consequences for human and ani
mal health. In addition, such a ban would
impose an extra burden on taxpayers and
could price many important research projects
- out of existence.

Each dog and cat bred specifically for
research costs hundreds of dollars more than
a pound animal. The Mrazek bill makes no
‘ accommodation in appropriations for this sub-
stantial rise in cost. The additional expense

would shut uown many of our most productive
laboratories. Critical work on inducing toler-
ance in organ grafts, for example, and on
minimizing lamage to cardiac muscles after
heart atacks has been halted in some re-
search laboratorie. because of ~oaring costs
of dogs.

Moreover, eliminating the use of pound
animals in research would, paradoxically,
cause even more animals to die. According to
the American Humane Society, 7 million pet
dogs are abandoned to pounds or shelters
each year, 5 million of which are killed—600
“trusting pets" killed hourly.

Yet some would have you believe that
killing animals in a pound is more virtuous
than having them help to advance medical
knowledge and ultimately beneﬁt human and
animal health. I don’t like to see life taken
from any species unnecessarily, ad that
would happen if this law is enacted. Every
year we would have to breed an additional
138,000 dogs and 50,000 cats for research to
replace the pound animals, which would then
be put to death anyway because no one wants
them. With the current overpopulation of
dogs and cats, the logic of such a policy
escapes me.

It was humane concerns that led me into

riments '

medicine. I strongly disapprove of cruelty to
animals as well as humans. Unquestionably,
every precaution should be taken, and en-
forced to ensure that laboratory animals are
treated humanely.

If scientists abandon cat and dog experi-
ments for other models that are not as suit.
able or as well understood, many potential
medical breakthroughs may be severely crip-
pled or halted. Grave diseases such as AIDS,
cancer and muscular dystrophy, heart dis-
ease, Alzheimer's disease and other serious
conditions will continue to plague our fami-
lies, friends and fellow citizens.

Increasing restrictions on animal experi-
mentation have discouraged many young sci-
entis‘ts from careers in research. Once the
manpower chain is broken, it will not be easily

astored. And where will we then turn for
was to devastating human diseases?

'buerrilla tactics, lurid pictures and sensation-

al headlines may inflame emotions. but they
do not lead to rational judgments.

More important, should we condone ha-
rassment, terrorism and violence masquerad-
ing as concern for animal rights? As a physi-
cian, my greatest concern is for the suffering
human beings who will be denied effective
treatment because we took action that seems
superficially humane but may ultimately ren-
der us powerless against certain diseases.
What do I tell dying patients who are waiting
for the medical advances that these threat-
ened investigations may produce—that there
is no hope because we have been prevented
from acquiring the new knowledge needed to
correct their conditions? '

As a human being and physician, I cannot
conceive of telling parents their sick child is

med because we cannot use all the tools at
our disposal. Surely those who object to
animals in research laboratories must be
equally distressed at seeing sick children
hooked up to tubes. How will those parents
feel about a society that legislates the rights
of animals above thos . hum" 2

Through research we have made remark-
able advances in medicine, but we still do not
have all the answers. If the animal-rights
activists could witness the heartbreaking suf-
fering of patients and families that I encoun-
tr: daily, I doubt that they would deliberately '
poseadirectthreattohumanandanimal
health by demanding the we abandon some of
our most fruitful methods of medial investi-
gation.

Self-,ireser'ation is a primary instinct of all
members of the animal kingdom, and patients
with that instinct deserve our compassion,
protection and assistance as much as other
species. The American puh'ic must decide:
shall we tell hundreds of thousands of victims
of heart attacks, cancer, AIDS . nd numerous
otherdreaddiseasssthattherightofaban—
doned animals to die in a pound supersedes
the patients’ rights to relief from suffering
and premature death? In making that deci-
sion, let us use not anger and hatred but
reason and good wilL

Julia HUr‘n pets Moose while Crystal takes a break: “They do bark .

. . but it's more like a warm, welcoming bark."

These Pooches Would Rather Frolic Than Fight

By CAROL MCGRAW, Times Staff Writer

ny boss would love them. They are

polite, friendly, deal well with the

public and work for almost nothing.

But the Cultural Heritage
Foundation is firing two of its employees for
having just those attributes.

Crystal and Moose,'two part-German
shepherds, were hired to be ferocious guard
dogs, but they ended up being pussycats on
the job. They’d rather frolic with intruders '
than attack them, and about the only thing
' they’ve put the bite on in the last few years is
the kibble in their supper dish.

The two dogs, who were once strays, were
employed by the foundation to guard the eight
historical Victorian homes perched along the
banks of Arroyo Seco five miles north of
downtown. The houses, which are ringed by a

six-foot-high fence, are being restored by the .

nonprofit foundation’s volunteers. The site,
called Heritage Square, is an architectural

 

monument to the city’s Victorian past.
But according to Julia Burn, the

foundation’s associate director, the dogs

evidently thought they were hiring on as

_ mere house~sitters.

“They sit around a lot. They chase
squirrels. They play with children. They eat
chili burgers. They do bark . . . but it’s more
like a warm, welcoming bark,” she said, '
rolling her eyes.

Given Their Pink Slips

So in spite of their lengthy tenure, the dogs
have been given their pink slips. They've
been replaced by security guards of the
two-legged variety, and they’ve got until the

) end of the month to find a retirement home.

Hurn is looking for someone to adopt the
dogs. But not just anyone.

Applicants who are interested in owning
the dogs will be screened and the proposed

‘.

 

new home inspected. The adoption agreement
will forbid the new owners from giving the
dogs away or using them for research.

‘And we don't want anyone to take them
thinking they will be guard dogs. They are too
gentle and loving," Hurn says. Andif possible,
she would like them to be able to stay '
together. “But if it’s a choice between
separating the two of them, or the pound, well
of course, we’d consider it.” .

Moose, who is now 7, was the first to arrive
for duty at Heritage Square, about six years
ago. His father, who had often accompanieda
volunteer worker to the square, fellin love
with a German shepherd down the street.
Moose was the result of that romance. The
volunteer convinced the staff that the puppy
would be a great guard dog. But they chose
the wrong dog for the job. “Moose is really
very shy. He likes to hide in his doghouse

explained. 3

Crystal, who is 4, arrived at the
park when someone tossed her
over the fence to get rid of her.

. Volunteers once again thought
they had the makings of a watch-
dog. But Crystal had other ideas.

. She grew up to be a ballplayer.

The work schedule has not been
extremely stressful or demanding.
The only trouble at the park has
been an occasional intrusion by
”neighborhood youngsters. And the
dogs could probably argue that
they’ve earned their $20 worth of
dog food a month, since their mere
presence may have been a factor in
deterring vandalism and burglary
at the park.

“Crystal and Moose are alert and
give the impression that they are
patrolling,” Hurn acknowledged.

The highlight of their career
came the morning that a mainte-
nance worker found the two dogs
frolicking with a group of teen-age
boys who had jumped over the
fence. “The dogs were barking all
right-for joy,” Hurn said.

The Rogers County Sheriff’s De-

deaths of at least six horses in long-
distance races in sweltering heat
near Catoosa, Okla, over the week-

The results of the investigation,
which will be completed in about a
week, will be turned over to the dis-

Estes, a spokeswoman for the sher-
iff’s department.

' “Something was not done cor-

Stephanie Cuomo gives a grateful bug to guide dog, 'Kami, who has helped in dangerous situations.

 

 

A guide dog’s instincts
instill trust in once-
skeptlcal owner.

 

By MARILYN WEEKS
' Staff Writer '

The elevator door sprung open as Stephanie
Cuomo pressed the butto .

“Kami, forward,” Cuomo said to the black labra-
dor retriever who has been the woman’s eyes for
more than four years.

The dog refused to move.

After another unsuccessful attempt to urge the
dog forward, Cuomo suspected something was
wrong. She cautiously stuck her foot into the opening
of the elevator, searching for the floor.

“There was nothing there,” she said “We walked
up the stairs.” . .

Cuomo, 29, of Sunrise, still does not know the
depth of the emptiness Kami saw when the elevator
door Opened on the ground floor of the two-story of-
fice building where she works.

Co-workers said the elevator is running smoothly
again, but Cuomo’s vivid memories of the experi-
ence early on Monday morning have not dimmed. ‘

“He sure did his job,” she said, giving Kami a,
grateful pat on Wednesday. .

Indeed, there was never a doubt in her mind that
her best friend and protector would do his job. Since
an incident with a screaming fire truck during their
first weeks together, the bond of trust has grown be-
tween dog and master.

Cuomo, a receptionist trainee in the state Division
of Blind Services on West Oakland Park Boulevard
in Oakland Park, admitted, “I didn’t think it would
ever work out” between her and Kami.

Doctors diagnosed her diabetes when she was 9
years old. The disease claimed her eyesight six
years ago. Cuomo waited two years before she
changed her mind about having a seeing-eye dog.

She has fond memories of the monthlong training
sessions with Guiding Eyes for the Blind, the agency
in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., that breeds guide dogs
and matches them with people like Cuomo.

“I got him in February,” she recalled, stroking the
head that now rested on her knee. “I kept falling
down on the ice. . . . Finally, he stopped and refused
to go on every time he’d come to a patch of ice.”

But Cuomo’s doubts continued as the pair finally
tackled New York alone during the last days of
training. Then came the day she had to depend upon
him to guide her across a six-lane street.

Halfway across, a fire truck with sirens scream
ing came through the intersection parallel with their
route. Cuomo was sure the noise would frighten or
distract him and “I knew we’d never make it.”

She was wrong. Kami continued to walk, hesitat-
ing only to show his master the curb. ~ ~

“After that, we were the best of friends," she said.

And this week was no different. There was never
any question that she would ignore the warning and

go ahead of him into the elevator. ‘ _ ‘

“We still don’t know exactly what happened,” said
Cuomo, who does not know whether Kami stared
into an empty shaft or at an elevator a few inch.
from alignment with the floor. ' ' ;

Kami is “just a pet” at home when his harness
hangs on the back of a kitchen chair. But when
Cuomo begins to get dressed to leave, the dog takes
up his post beside the chair.

BOSTON GLOBE

in Florida,

United Press International i"

LAKE BUENA VISTA. Fla. —
The last of the dusky seaside spar-
rows. protected like a rare jewel
for the final years of his life, is
dead.

With the passing of the old.

half-blind little bird. another spe .

cies fell victim to encroachments
by man. ~’

Its tissue was frozen and sent
to the University of Georgia in
hopes that technology some day
might allow a pure strain of the
bird to be recreated through genet-
ic cloning.

Ornithologist Herb Kale. a
member of the Florida Audubon
Society who led a 20-year fight to
save the canary-size bird. said he
thought it would now be declared
extinct.

The sole surviving dusky was
found dead in a food dish Tuesday
in his special habitat at Walt Dis-
ney World's Discovery Island.

So tender was his care that sci-
entists who visited the bird were

required to 'dip their feet in disin- .

fectant before entering the 8-by-
10-foot cages of marsh grass
planted in sand. The bird was fed
crickets. seeds and insect larvae
and softly showered with artificial
rain from a sprinkler system.

“It was too little too late.” Kale
said. “Apparently old age caught
up with him. He was at minimum
10 years old and could have been
several years older.”

Kale said the thousands of
dusky sparrows that once flew
through marshes along the St.
Johns River in Brevard County
were wiped out by human develop-
ment, their habitat drained. cut
with roads and sprayed with pes-
ticides. '

Biologists and bird lovers went
into the dusky habitat in 1979

and 1980 in an effort to save the

species. Only five males were
found and captured

The birds initially were taken
to the Santa Fe Community Col—
lege Teaching Zoo in Gainesville
for cross-breeding with their close
relatives, Scott’s seaside spar-
rows. ‘ ,

They were brought to Disney

World in 1983. The experiments ‘

continued. and five hybrid dus—

live in the Screened cages on Dis-
covery Island. One of the females
is 87 percent dusky.

The Smithsonian Institution
and several universities have ex—
pressed interest in taking the dead
bird’s preserved remains, said
Charles Cook, an Audubon Soci-
ety member and curator of the
Disney wildlife refuge.

While it is possible a lost colo—
ny of duskies may still live in the
Brevard County marshes - an-
other search next spring is being
discussed scientists hold little
hope that the passing of the old
bird at Disney World did not mean
the end of the duskies.

“It was just a little late for an
uphill battle." Cook said.

She’s Black And White Like A Panda, But She’s

OUGLASVILLE, Ga. — She is a
profile in courage.

I don’t know if you believe
there is such a thing as canine
courage, that dogs have guts or
a lack of them just like people.
I believe it.

Amanda is a 10-year-old dog, half English
sheep dog and half Saint Bernard. A man in Tus-
caloosa, Ala., had hoped to cull the characteris
tic hyperactivity of the sheep dog and the drool-
ing of a Saint Bernard in the breeding process.

Amanda was the calm, non-drooling result of
his experiment.

She is black and white and cuddly, and so they
call her Amanda the Panda. Or Manda for short.

Her head is as big or bigger than a human
head, and her sad eyes are jet black with a rim
of white always showing around them. They are
trusting but bewildered eyes, the kind children
have in their smooth faces on the first day of
school.

Amanda's nose is black and large, looking like

" a leather nipple stuck on the end of her snout as

a cautious afterthought.

She belongs to three little girls and their par-
ents, a TV-pretty family that lives in a modern
yellow house in this suburb of Atlanta.

About a year ago, a veterinarian discovered

Amanda had bone cancer. He called the owners -

while the dog slept in the white oblivion of an-
esthesia and informed them of their options —
euthanasia or the amputation of Manda’s right
front leg.

The parents of the three little girls thought
about the patience Manda always had shown
with their children, the way she’d gladly sufo
fered the overeager advances babies inevitably
make to dogs. They called the veterinarian back
and told him to operate. Save our dog.

For three days after Amanda came home she
slept in the garage, tired and sore and evidently
preferring to delay the testing of her revised
body. You could see the muscles twitching and
working above the place where the leg not so
long ago had been. '

But on the fourth day, Amanda got up and lit-
erally bounded from the garage to the back
yard, faltering now and again but eventually
gaining a balance to work and walk with.

A short time after Amanda came home, one of
the little girls, Sarah, got sick and was sent to
the hospital. Sarah seemed inordinately fright-
ened, and the anxious parents finally found out

why. It seemed Sarah worried she, too, was
doomed to lose a leg.

But, on the whole, the little girls accepted
amended Amanda in the matter-of-fact way chil-
dren accept virtually everything. They stared a
good, long stare at Amanda when she first stum-
bled from the family van, and then they were
done with it.

Sometimes they patiently explain the ob-
vious.

“Your dog has four legs, and mine has three,"
Sarah’s big sister Caitie will tell her friends. It is
as if she is talking about a four-door sedan ver-
sus a two-door model.

I have seen other threeolegged dogs; I'm sure
you must have, too.

In fact, there was a dog at Auburn, a campus
pet, we called Tripod. Tripod could catch a Fris-
bee with the best of ‘em. He never struck me as
pagticularly sad. Odd, agile, amazing, but never
sa .

But I knew Amanda before. And I was totally
unprepared when that big, friendly bear of a
dog came lumbering out of the garage on that
trio of long limbs.

I had driven quite a ways to get here, and

Amanda was the first sign of life about the
place. I couldn’t help but wonder what other
surprises might await me.

Her big body was otherwise as perfect as al-
ways, a shaggy specimen looking eager to serve.
She ran toward me at a precarious canter.

“Oh no!” I cried, involuntarily, and a window
shot up on the second story.

“Sorry. Forgot to warn you," called the mom.
She and Sarah soon were outside to greet me.

“Man-man-man-da was sick," Sarah told me.
She stutters a little when excited. She hugged
the dog that is taller than she is and tenderly
rubbed at a small Spot on the animal’s head.

Amanda, who had seemed amazingly steady
on her own, took this opportunity to lean
against the small child. She was a ship of a dog,
listing starboard. The chubby, sturdy legs of
Sarah instinctively supported the dog.

And if hearts can bolt for the throat, mine did.

Bless the beasts and the children. They de-
pend on us so. 00-

ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH - June 15, 1987

Research 011 Animals Saves Human Lives
Shall We Tell Suffering People That Animals’ Right To Live Supersedes Their Own?

By Michael E. DeBakey

s an advocate of patients, both in
and out of the operating room, I
feel a responsibility to protect

the rights of patients in regard to medi-
cal advances resulting from animal re-

search. Had the animal legislation now .

pending in Congress been enacted when
I began my career, it would have pre-
vented me from developing a number of
lifesaving procedures in my research
laboratory. ‘

Instead of restoring thousands of pa-
tients to a normal life and a return to
productive work, my colleagues and I
would have been helpless to offer many
of our patients any real hope at all. This
legislation, known as the Mrazek bill,
seeks to ban the use of pound animals
for any research supported by the Na-
tional Institutes of Health, the chief
source of funds for biomedical research
in this country. Are we now to hold‘hu-
man health hostage to the rights of
abandoned animals to be killed in
, pounds? .

Even with today’s technology, I could
not have developed on a computer the
roller pump that made open-heart sur-
gery possible or the artificial artery that
restored to health previously doomed
patients with aneurysms. Nor could we
have attempted the first successful cor-
onary artery bypass or implanted the
first temporary mechanical heart, with
which we saved a patient’s life two de-
cades ago.

Would animal-rights activists have ob-
jected to the first kidney, heart or liver
transplant? Would they forgo the pro-
tection humanity enjoys today against
poliomyelitis, tetanus, diphtheria and
whooping cough, or the treatment for
strep throat, ear infections, bronchitis
and pneumonia — all products of ani-
mal research? Would they have denied
, the 11 milliondiabetics the right to life
that insulin has given them — or victims
of cancer the help they have received
from radiation and chemotherapy?

The truth is that there are no satisfac-
tory insentient models at present for
certain types of biomedical research
and testing. A computer is not a living
system and would not have produced

the dramatic medical advances of the

past few decades.

Only about 1 percent of abandoned
dogs are releasedfor research. If
pounds are such a meager source of

research animals, you may ask, why am A

I concerned about losing that source?
My reasons are well founded. Not only
are pound animals of particular value in
research on heart and kidney disease,

brain injury, stroke, blindness and deaf-
ness, but a ban on their use could have
grave consequences for human and ani-
mal health. In addition, such a prohibi-
tion would impose an extra burden on
American taxpayers and could price
many important research projects out of
existence. ' -
Each dog and cat bred specifically for
researchcosts hundreds of dollars more
than a pound animal. The Mrazek bill
makes no accommodation in appropria-
tions for this substantial rise in cost. The

additional expense would shut down'

many of our most productiv
laboratories. . . '
Critical work on inducing tolerance in
organ grafts, for example, and on mini-
mizing damage to cardiac muscles after

heart attacks has been halted in some
research laboratories because. of soar-
ing costs of dogs. 1

Moreover, eliminating the use of
pound animals in research would, para-
doxically, cause even more animals to
die. According to the American Humane
Society, 7 million pet dogs are aban-
doned to pounds or shelters each year, 5
million of which are killed — 600 “trust-
ing pets” killed hourly. .

Yet some would have you believe that
killing animals in a pound is more virtu-
ous than having them help to advance
medical knowledge and ultimately ben-
efit human and animal health. I don’t
like to see life taken from any species

tr - ,

unnecessarily, and that would happen if
this law is enacted.
Every year we would have to breed

. an additional 138,000 dogs and 50,000

cats for research to replace the pound
animals, which would then be put to
death anyway because no one wants
them. With the current overpopulation
of dogs and cats, the logic of such a
policy escapes me.

It was humane concerns that led me
into medicine. I strongly disapprove of
cruelty to animals as well as humans.
Unquestionably, every precaution
should be taken, and enforced, to ensure
that laboratory animals are treated
humanely.

If scientists abandon cat and dog ex-
periments for other models that are not
as suitable or as well understood, many
potential medical breakthroughs may
be severely crippled or halted. Grave
diseases such as AIDS, cancer and mus-
cular dystrophy, heart disease, Alz-
heimer’s disease and other serious con-
ditions will continue to plague us.

As a human being and physician, I
cannot conceive of telling parents their
sick child is doomed because we cannot
use all the tools at our disposal. Surely
those who object "to animals in research
laboratories must be equally distressed
at seeing sick children hooked up to
tubes. How will those parents feel about
a society that legislates the rights of ani-
mals above those of humans?

Through research we have made re-
markable advances in medicine, but we
still do not have all the answers. If, the
animal-rights activists could witness the
heartbreaking suffering of patients and
families that I encounter daily, I doubt
that they would deliberately pose a di-
rect threat to human and animal health
by demanding that we abandon some of
our most fruitful methods of medical
investigation. _

Self-preservation is a primary instinct
of all members of the animal kingdom,
and human patients with that instinct
deserve our compassion and protection
as other species.

The American public must decide:
Shall we tell hundreds of thousands of
victims of diseases that the right of
abandoned animals to die in a pound
supersedes the patients’ rights to relief
from suffering and premature death? In
making that decision, let us use not an-
ger and hatred but reason and good will.

Gonorable Sam Nunn
Honorable Wyche Fowler
Honorable Pat Swindall
mebers of Congress from GA
Washington, DC

Gentlemen:

I have no idea how many letters I have written ontthe subject of
the wild mustangs and burros roaming our PUBLIC LANDS, but I am
sure it must be at least a dozen — if not to you alone, to previ—
ous representatives and other members of Congress.

It is very disturbing to me to read that the Bureau of Land Man-
agement is considering putting to death 10,000 of these wild
horses - animals which BELONG on our Public Land.

I have an idea that the majority of Americans have let their rep—
resentatives kn w over the years, that they are totally opposed

to the decimation of our wild mustangs to please the cattle and
sheep raisers. They appear to be the only people opposed to the
mustangs roaming on our Public Land — not their land, but the land
which is the property of all Americans. They have no more say in
its use than do the rest of Americans.

According to a story in the Phoenix Arizona Republic on June 6, by '
Mark Shaffer, the wild horses are locked in to 35 million acres of ’1
Public Land under the 1971 Act, while cattle are permitted to graze
on 170 million acres under the federal Taylor Grazing Act of 1934.
There is certainly a great disparity here, particularly when one
realizes that the cattleman pays ONLY $1.35 per head to graze his
animals on PUBLIC LAND. Of course, had the£¥2been an Animal Rights
movement in the 303 as there has been today, I don't believe the
Taylor Grazing Act could have gotten off the ground.

 

 

Studies I have read, done by experts, explain explicitly, that the
damage being done to land - any place where cattle and sheep graze -
is being done by those animals, and not by the wild horses.

We have about 45,000 wild horses and burros grazing on PUBLIC LAND,
while there are approximately 4 million cattle grazing on PUBLIC LAND.
Also, I understand the true value of cattle grazing on PUBLIC LAND is
between $6 and $20. '

I hope you gentlemen will do what you can to stop the proposed slaughter
of these animals.

Sincerely,

(Mrs.) Constance F. Yarbrough

Animal feeder Dave
Seager says he enjoys
caring for creatures most

people see only in books *

, or on television.

By KATHY FEENEY
Tribune Staff Writer

- TAMPA — Fluttering their eye-
lashes flirtatiously, their mouths
poised and ready to chew, the 14
giraffes surround the ﬂatbed truck.
‘ “This is better than being presi-
dent of the United States,” says
Dave Seager, as he offers a handful
of grain to a giraffe nudging his
arm. “There’s only one Busch Gar-
dens in the world; there’s only one
feed truck -— and I’m one of the
people that work on it. ”

Seager, who has blue eyes that
crinkle when he smiles, is one of
three 200 attendants who rotate the
dispensing of hay, grain and medi-
cine to more than 500 free-roaming
African animals on the theme
park’s 60-acre Serengeti Plain.

Along with co-workers Ken
White and Debi Talbott, Seager be-
gins his day at 7 a.m., filling the
flatbed with 114, tons of food. By
7:30 the feeders pull away from the
loading platform and start their
three-hour, ills-mile trek through
the veld.

With White at the wheel, the
truck ambles past timid gazelles,
skittish waterbuck and stole wilde-
beest. Bracing himself against the
bumpy ride, Seager rips open a 50-
pound bag of feed, leans over the
truck’s side rail and pours the grain
into wooden troughs. “You spread
your feed around as much as you
can to cut down on competition for
it,” he explains. “Survival of the fit-
test prevails here, too. ”

, Pulling into the camel pen, Seag-
er and White are met by eight
:dromedaries softly growling in an-
ticipation. “These camels were
. raised at our nursery — they’re all
big babies. I’ve named a few of
them. This one’s Maggie,” Seager
says as he pats a shaggy brown
head. “I call that little white one
R.B., because he looks like a friend
of mine —- Richard Baker.”-

After feeding the camels and
locking their gate, Seager walks
over to the hippopotamus pond.

Two of the 3,000-pound beasts
. are waiting behind a wire fence,
: their mouths stretched open wide.
Seager spills servings of grain onto
their pink tongues, and the hippos
slowly grind their jaws.

Dave Seager, left, and Terry Hale feed the flamingos.

NC,,

The slate- -gray animals spend 12
to 14 hours a day immersed in wa-
iter, Seager explains, and their bod-
iies naturally secrete an oil to lubri-
rate their rubbery skin.

“This is the second-most danger-
lous animal in Africa,” Seager says
“These canine teeth are like a
boar’ s tusk, constantly rubbing
against each other so they’ re
sharp.” The bulls are the moe’ ~. 3..
gressive, he says. and their victims -

I are usually canoeists. . "1

“The most dangerous animal is

, the Nile crocodile,” Seager contin-

ue ,“the only one of the animal
species that hunts and eats man.
The Nile crocodile will eat you any-
time he gets a chance.”

Spotting a herd Of ostriches
across the way, Seager mentions
that the birds, which can grow to
:300 pounds, are extremely aggres-
sive and cannot be trusted. “He’ll
kick your liver out,” he says, point-
ing a large male.

If Seager, 45, sounds like a hu-
man encyclopedia opened to the
chapter on African animals, that’s
because he says he devours books

’ on the subject. He also happens to
love wildlife, a love he developed as

: a youngster growing up in Ormond

Beach.

“I had a lot of snakes, and I
raised rats. My mama had a real
hard time adjusting to my child-
hood,” Seager says.

He says he remembers being
reprimanded for bringing home
stray dogs and feeding cats that had
wandered into his family’s back
yard. “I never took home a stray
giraffe,” he says, “but I would have

3411'-“ ,

 

:1"! ‘ ‘ ’ Q

3::I’m sure, if the opportunity had pre‘
'sented itself.”

During the five years Seager has
been on the feed truck, he says,

athere hasn’t been one day that he,

has dreaded going to work.
“The first time I rode out here,
my eyes got this big,” he says, gesi.

.turing with his hands. Every day he,
‘3 rides the feed truck, Seager marvels
at the beauty surrounding him.

“The giraffes are just so big and .
stately,” he says. “I like the roan?

,antelope because they’re impresv
sive, and the sable is just a majestic,-.

powerful animal.”

He says he doesn’t take for.
granted the fact that he has the
chance to care for animals most
people see only in books or on tele-

.VlSlOIl. -

“You can’t work out here and
not care about what happens to
them — it’s like a big, giant family,” '
Seager says. '

“If you have to work through
lunch or stay late, that’s OK. It’s to“
tally irrelevant, because we have an.

,agreement with these animals,’.’.

Seager explains. “We take them out ._
of the wild — where they’re really»:
free —— and we feed them, water '

them and give them the best treat-
;ment we can.’ "‘

Chef Louis Barroso isn’t
content merely to j
prepare his dishes. Food
must be appealing ' ‘
visually and taste-wise. ‘

By KATHY FEENEY
Tribune Staff Writer

, TAMPA — Clad in a brown
apron, chef Louis Barroso is creat-
ing his house salad.

He lines a steel bowl with crisp
leaves of romaine lettuce and grat-
ed carrots and adds the piece de
resistance — a scoopful of squirm-
ing brown beetle larva. .

As chief caterer to the palates of
more than 3,000 animals at Busch
Gardens — including birds, lions, ti-
gers, crocodiles, zebras, rhinoceros
and orangutans -— Barroso, 39, uses
only fresh, and unusual, ingredients.

“Like people, animals like vari-
ety, and I try to give them that,” he
says, “because variety makes them
a lot happier.” I

At first glance, Barroso’s work
place resembles a restaurant kitch-
en. Gleaming steel tables are cov-

ered with 50-pound bags of carrots-

and boxes of apples, bananas and
oranges. An industrial-size blender
whirs loudly as it mashes bananas,
and a walk-in refrigerator stores
loaves of French bread, fish and
green vegetables. ‘

But a closer look reveals that
the menu is not so ordinary. A recl-
pe on a blackboard calls for: 1 cup
corn, 1 banana (peeled and
chopped), 1 apple, yestalk celery,
l/z-stalk Chinese cabbage, 1 sweet
potato, l carrot, l beet root and in-
cup meal worms (beetle larva).
Across the room, a row of bins hous-
“es delicacies that include safflower

seeds, raisins, mineral salt, pigeon
grain, peanuts and baby cereal.

“Every animal has their favorite
foods,” says Barroso. “There’s a
certain troupe of monkey that likes
fruits, greens and carrots. Yet with-
in that troupe, some of them may
prefer cherries, and some only like
oranges.” . .

The chimpanzees, for example,
like to dine on Monkey Chow *‘b‘y

Purina and gelatin —— but only red-

l

tin—{ea lflav'ors‘of gelatin. “i tried
green once, but they wouldn’t touch

i it,” Barroso says.

The orangutans he serves love
popcorn, and the alligators eagerly
scarf down sausages made from
fish, meat and dog food.

Barroso invented the sausages
after trying unsuccessfully to feed
the crocodiles medication and vita-
mins tucked into whole fish. “The
pills would destruct in water,” he
says.

During a visit to a meat-packing
plant, Barroso watched a worker
stuff ground meat into casings for

sausage. “So I asked them if itmat—.~

rk’mlls .. c.“ .A..._ w- rug...- —'l“‘> -7.

.|,

’ters whatuyoumput intor’t'he casings,

and they said ‘no.’ That’s when I got
the idea to make the sausage my-
self.”

Like gourmet chefs, Barroso
isn’t content merely to prepare his
dishes. Food must be appealing Via-j
sually and taste-wise, since his goal;-
is to satisfy his diners’ appetites.

“Usually, I can ‘convert almost"
any animal to Our diets,” he saysn
“It’s probably one of the best diets
you can get,‘in the quality of the:
foodf’ ‘ _“
That’s unless the animal hap:
pens to be as finicky as the gibbon-
monkey Barroso says he tried te-

' _ satisfy. The monkey was donated bf.

' an elderly woman who said she nQ;
longer could care for it. Barroso:
says he figured it would take awhile:
but that he easily could acclimate?
the monkey to a new diet‘. ~ ~

ARIZONA REPUBLIC - Phoenix - June 14, 1987

Oryx lovers meet in London, mark

25th yearo

By MARC LEFCOURT

special for The Republic ~ .
LONDON — Some true friends.

of a species brought back from
near-extinction gathered here last
week to mark the 25th anniversary

bf Operation Oryx, a breeding

program based at the Phoenix Zoo.
,. The Celebration Symposium, two
ﬁays of seminars, receptions and

fbanquets, was attended by several '
hundred Arabian oryx lovers, con-1

Lservatiunists, and veterinarians
from Britain, France, the United

States and a number of Middle East ‘

:‘nations.

Wayne Human, general curator ‘

of the Phoenix Zoo and a featured
speaker at the symposium, called

the event "the culmination of a.

pioneering program.” ;

' "We can «now say we’ve saved the
oryx,” said Human, who helped
open the Phoenix Zoo in 1962,

almost immediately taking charge ‘

of what he called the park’s most
important contribution to conserva-

tion — the task of breeding in.

captivity a new generation of wild
animals.

Human, a 56-year-old Gilbert
~resident, was credited at the sympo-
sium with “masterminding produc-
tion of a world herd” of nearly
extinct Arabian oryx, members of
which are being supplied to zoos
worldwide and now beginning a
reintroduction to the wilds of their
native habitat. .

The oryx is a species of antelope

that grows as tall as 7 feet. They
are distinguished by straight horns " '

that grow to 2 to 4 feet in length.
"Operation Oryx has been the
highlight of my zoological career,”
said Homan, interviewed between
stops on his busy five—day visit to
London. The symposium ﬂanked a
black-tie banquet Thursday night
at the London Zoo, where knights

and ambassadors were among the ’

100 guests. _. a

The Arabian oryx once ranged in
huge numbers from as far north as
present-day Syria, south to the Gulf
of Aden. But by the early 19605,
because of relentless hunting, fewer
than 100 were thought to remain in
the wild -— all in the extreme south
of the Arabian Peninsula near
Yemen and Oman. - ~

After a motorized hunt in 1962
in which half of the remaining 100
oryxes were reportedly massacred,
the London-based Fauna and Flora

captive breeding program was the
only way to save the species.

With help from the World Wild~
life Fund, Operation Oryx began
with a roundup in Aden of a few of
the remaining animals. The expedi-
tion was led by Maj. Ian Grimwood,

,7‘then chief game warden of Kenya,
~ who Thursday recounted the hunt

for several hundred listeners.

"We gained the impression that
there were no more than 11 wild
oryx in the area and perhaps in the
world,” said Grimwood, now retired
in Nairobi. "We spotted four and
caught four, perhaps the same
ones,” and the others were ac-
counted fur by their trails, he
added. ‘

Three of Grimwood’s captured

oryx survived, two males and a

female. They were held in quaran-

tine while a search went on for a

suitable home and purebred mates.
“It was felt they should have the

i benefit or the climate to which they
. were used,” Grimwood said. "We

very much favored desert areas of
the southwest United States.” '
The Arizona Zoological Society’s

new facility in Phoenix’s Papago

Park was a logical choice.
"We were a young zoo with an
aggressive board anxious to bring

”Operation Oryx to Phoenix,”
Human said. "We invited Major;

Grimwood over to see us.”
Not only did Arizona have a

' climate similar to Arabia, he said, _
desert terrain. "

The Aden oryx were sent to
Phoenix, where they were joined by
Caroline, a purebred prolific and
“willing" female, Human said, from
the _ zoological society of London;
another female donated by Sheik
Jaber Abdullah al-Sabah of Kuwait
and two pair from King Saud of
Saudi Arabia.

."They were called the herd shot
’ruund the world,” Human said of
the world’s gene pool of oryx,
apparently comfortable in their
new. surroundings. By mid-1963 the
first calf was born, and since then
188 ~ have followed in the zou’s
specially'built enclosure and mater-

nity complex.

And none too soon, the experts
agree. By the late 19705 oryx were
believed to have disappeared in the
wild. The world herd now numbers
about 400, Human said, with an-
other 400 in private collections,
mostly in the Middle East and

raised from unknown stock. 7

reacclimated oryx were released

three generations of captivity they

SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER - 6/21/87

Denver’s elite wants?

 

to work at

By Pat Hanna
SCRIPPS HOWARD NEWS SERVICE

WV.

DENVER .— By the time Kathy

 

Ogsbury had finished her exhibi- ‘

tion of reptiles at a party here, it
was too late to get them back to the
Denver Zoo.

“80 I took the five snakes home
-- a ball python, a boa constrictor, a
bull snake, a hognose and an Aus-
tralian water python — put them in
the bathtub, closed the bathroom

door and went to bed. It didn’t both- _,

er me. After all, they were in their
pillow cases. .

“I went straight to sleep. but evo
ery hour on the hour my husband
and my two cats were up, checking
to see the bathroom door was still
' closed. They didn’t relax until I
took the snakes back to the zoo
docent trailer the next morning.”

It’s not your usual volunteer
work, but taking in snakes -—- or
tiger cubs or chimpanzees —-— as
. overnight guests is just one of the
things occasionally required of
Denver Zoo docents. And more peo-
ple want the job than there are
openings.

The zoo docents rank with the
elite of Denver volunteers. While.
many organizations beg for free la-
bor, peeple wait in line to lend a
hand at the high-status institutions
~— the zoo, the Museum of Natural
History, the Denver Art Museum
and the local public television sta-
tion, for instance. .

What is the appeal of the most
desirable volunteer jobs? Some peo-
ple may fantasize about playing
with wild animals. handling rare
treasures or breaking into televi-
sion. Actually, few zoo volunteers
actually touch animals, museum
relics are trusted only to experts,
Q and Opportunities in front of the TV
, camera seldom occur. .
While many are interviewed fo
these special 'corps, few are chosen
=' .H and passing the interview is just
the first hurdle. Once accepted for
the zoo docent program, each vol-

the zoo -~

unteer must participate in a 12-;
week intensive training program;
learning the answers to questions
likely tobe asked by 200 visitors}
That means knowing everything:
from animal bone structure or babe;
itat to conservation efforts on be«._:
half of mammals, reptiles, birds;
primates and hoofed animals. '

The zoo program starts the first
Tuesday in January, ﬁnd atten-Z
dance'at the ‘12 all-day sessions is
compulsory. Those with jobs are ex«'.
pected to schedule their work
around the 'classes. After graduaé
tion, docents must donate at least 5Q

4-Day-Old Panda Cub, Deserted
by Mother, Dies at Mexico City Zoo

From Reuters

MEXICO CITY—A panda cub that was rejected by its mother in
favor of its younger twin died Thursday in the Chapultepec Zoo

despite a four-day effort to save its life.

 

"—

 

“If it was with pride that I announced the birth of the pandas in

this zoo on Monday; now it is with sadness that I inform you that
Ping-Ping has died,” zoo director Maria Elena Hoyo told reporters

through tears at a news conference in Mexico City.
The panda cub, whose name in Chinese means “peace,” was

abandoned Monday shortly after birth when its mother chose to

protect her stronger twin.

 

According to zoo veterinarians, pandas tend only one infant,
apparently because of the. physical demands required in raising a

cub.

notes, “The diversity of species is

be nice for the family to take a
zoo safari to seek out the unusu-
al or exotic animals.”

Those animalsare surprisingly
easy to ﬁnd at Uncoln Park and
Brookﬁeld Zoos.

More than 400 species of
animals are represented at each
zoo. The zoos have some species
in common, but between them

of birds, mammals, reptiles and
amphibians.

Among the rarities are man-
drills, a kind of baboon; okapis,
the only living relative of the

'raffe; p,aearanas a beaverlike

outh American rodent; and
~wombats, an A marsupi-
al that spends much of its time
underground.

If you’re not familiar with all
of these exotic creatures, you’re
not alone. Even pacarana fan
Dennis Meritt, assistant director
at Lincoln Park Zoo, concedes
that “no one knows anything
aboutthisanimal. Wedon’teven
know what they eat, what they
do or even how many there are
in the wild.”

The okapi wasn’t discovered
until l90l—the last large mam-
mal to be found. Now Brookﬁeld
Zoo is responsible for brwding
more ofthese animals (18 births)
than any other zoo in the United
States. No one knows for sure
exactly how rare they are, but
like many other unusual
they may ﬁnd their last chance
for survival at zoos.

In fact, the Arabian oryx was
once nearly annihilated in its na-
tive desert habitat in the Middle
East. Historically, natives hunted
these antelope, but they weren’t
very efficient until they pur-
chased ﬁrearms. The oryx also
suffered from wars in the region.
They were practically wiped off

saved them.

Experts and nonexperts alike
can learn a lot about an animal
just by being observant.

“If the species you’re observing
has long legs in proportion to its
body, it’s probably a great run-
ner,” notes Jenny Corn, educa-
tion specialist at the Brookﬁeld
Zoo. “Large, protruding eyes
may mean it’s nocturnal [active
at night]. Of course, you should
read the graphics that may ac-
company an exhibit.”

Corn uses the aardvark as an
example: “It has large claws-—
and it’s a great digger. Its large
nose and ears suggest a super
sense of smell and hearing. The
termite mound built into the ex-
hibit is meant to convey to the
public what its natural food
source is.”

But just because you search for
exotic animals doesn’t mean that
you ignore the more familiar
creatures.

“Many people might be sur-
prised to learn that the polar
bear is actually semi-aquatic,”
Corn says. “They’re really superb
swimmers. They’ve become ad-
apted to life on the ice ﬂoes in
the open sea because that’s
where their food source is. If you
look closely, you can see skin be-
tween the toes on their huge,
ﬂattened paws. And their thick,
hollow fur protects them from
the icy waters.‘ They have a
streamlined shape, more like an
aquatic mammal’s than a typical

with their nose and ears more
toward the top of their heads
than other bears.”

The most streamlined of all
aquatic mammals are the dol-
phins. The new Seven Seas
Panorama at Brookﬁeld Zoo
opened just a few weeks ago. It’s
the largest noncoastal dolphin
exhibit in the country, ﬁve times
as large as the old exhibit, which
opened in 1961.

“We constructed a place to
keep the animals and showcase
them for the public,” says Ed
Krajniak, curator of marine
mammals. “This time, we built

them a home. They have more-

National Zoo’s new panda given
the ‘best chance yet’ for survival

United Press I nternational

WASHINGTON - Linnging, the National Zoo’s
female giant panda, gave birth Tuesday to a bawling
4-ounce baby that represents the “best chance yet”
3 for a cub born in a US. zoo to survive, officials said.
. There have been three previous attempts, all

unsuccessful. .

“Both mother and cub are doing well,” said 200
spokesman Mike Morgan. “She is cradling the cub in
her arms. It only weighs 4 ounces, but it is surpris-
ingly loud. It’s kind of a whining call.”

Ling-Ling, who along with her mate, Hsing-
Hsing, were gifts tocthe United States from China in
1972, gave birth at 3:33 am, Morgan said. The cub
has survived longer than any giant panda previously
bred in the United States.

Giant pandas are extremely difficult to breed in
captivity. Ling-Ling, who weighs 245 pounds, had
been pregnant twice before. The first cub - the
first born in the United States — died of pneumonia
in 1983 after three hours. A year later, the second
cub was stillborn.

Morgan said the cub is “about the size of a stick
of butter” and “is covered with a very thin coat of
white hair, and its eyes are closed.”

In a news conference seven hours after the birth,
Lisa Stevens, who is in charge of the panda exhibit,
described the newborn as looking “very much like a
' rat.” She said it will not be seen in public for at

t.

least four months, though visitors can view the baby
on a video screen in the 200’s education center.

According to zoo guide Juanita Lambert, the
baby will grow into “a small fluff-ball by the time
it’s a month old.”

Two names for the cub, whose sex cannot be de-
termined for several weeks, have been offered by
the Chinese Embassy in Washington, but they have
yet to be released.

The cub “certainly has healthy lungs,” Ms. Ste-
vens said. ,

“Ling-Ling is doing everything she should be do-
ing,” Ms. Stevens said. llsing-Hsing, who is in a sep-
arate enclosure, is “pretty oblivious to everything.”

The black-and-white pair bred seven times duro
ing two days in early March, Morgan said.

“This cub does look strong, and we’re all hepe-
ful,” Morgan said. “This looks like our best chance
yet.”

The baby is among seven living cubs out of 12
that have been born outside China. Giant pandas are
among the rarest mammals and are native to the
mountains of central China and east Tibet. They eat
bamboo, using a special thumblike structure on their
front feet.

William Reilly, president of World Wildlife Fund
in Washington, said the birth represents “an imporv
tant conservation achievement. Our recent'studies
show the p0pulation of wild pandas has continued to

- decline, and now numbers 800 to 1,000.”

“We just have to take it day by day," said Ms.
Stevens. Any “lack of activity” in the nest signals
danger, she said.

County re ‘

TAMPA TRIBUNE - June 18, 1987

By JIM SLOAN

Tribune Staff Writer

TAMPA - Hillsborough County
commissioners declined to commit
to a request for a $5 million contri-

1' bution to the Lowry Park 200 on

Wednesday, telling zoo officials that

. “we don’t have the money.”

The commissioners, however,

agreed to study the county’s budget

to see if it can kick in something
less than $5 million.

Pierce Wood, chairman of the
200’s capital campaign fund, told

commissioners the money is needed
to finance the second phase of the
200’s $20 million improvement pro-
ject. ,

The 200 has been in operation as
a city zoo since 1957. Officials there
are now negotiating with the city of
Tampa to operate the zoo as a not-
for-profit organization, supporting it-
self through admission fees and con-
cession stand income. -

Wood said 37 million has been
raised privately to fund the first
phase of the project, which should
be complete early next year.

The zoo program is also funded
by $8 million from the city of Tam-
pa and $2 million from the state De-
partment of Natural Resources.

Wood estimated that 250,000
people pass through the facility an-
nually, 34 percent of them from
Tampa, 28 percent from elsewhere
in Hillsborough County and 38 per-
cent from outside the county.

Wood asked commissioners to
contribute $1 million a year for the
next five years. He said the money

DETROIT FREE PRESS - June 18, 1987

A Noteworthy Day . . .

. . . Things are looking good and busy
around the Detroit Zoo these days what with
that sensational new entrance plaza and big
crowds. Director Steve Graham’s a busy man,

but not too busy to comment on my recent
Monday Moanin’ that Grant Wood’s famous

American Gothic couple don’t look as old to

me as they once did. ,
Graham, an art history major early in his

schooling before the call of the wild was

heard, says the painting is called that because .

their heads frame a Gothic window. Another
little trivia tidbit about American Gothic
tucked in Graham’s memory forever is that
Wood’s sister and dentist posed for the pic-

- ture. Now none of of us will ever forget it,

will we, class? ,

Graham says the Detroit Zoological Soci-
ety’s famed “Sunset at the Zoo” gala next
Tuesday the 23d honors our own Four Tops
—- Duke Fakir, Levi Stubbs, Lawrence Payton

and Obie Benson -— at the Grand Old Ameri-

can Picnic starting at 6 p.m.

Society President Lawrence D. Buhl Jr.
says the nostalgic order will be “flowing
skirts for women and ducks and bucks for
men to set the mood for the evening,” almost
guaranteeing it to be the most stylish gather-
ing of late-spring, early-summer. Might even
top Some of this week’s Grand Prix soirees.

“Sunset at the 200” tickets are $75 a couple. .
Call 541-5717 from 8:30 to 5 for reservations”;

Your Chance to Peta Tarantula

id you know that a distant relative of
the familiar German cockroach,
when frightened, hisses to stop its
predators in their tracks? Or that

fuzzy velvet ants—called “cowkillers” be-

cause of their nasty sting—are really a type

of wasp? Or that drone bees—the only

males in a hive—emerge in the springtime

for the sole purpose of mating with the

virgin queen?

If you’ve ever wanted to learn

more about the largest group of

animals on Earth, our arthropod

cousins, a visit to the San F rancis-

co Zoological Gardens’ Insect Zoo

will greatly enhance your bug IQ.

You can get a close-up look at

the large Costa Rican wood cock-

roach, displayed in what looks like

a small tropical rain forest, its nat-

ural habitat. About three inches

long, this roach looks blessedly un- ‘

like its domestic cousin and more

like a piece of tropical wood,

which it is designed to mimic. You

or not is a trade secret.)

Then there are the scorpions, those spec-
ters of fear in the insect kingdom. The speci-
mens here live in a desertlike setting, but
with the unnatural addition of an ultraviolet
light. Flip a switch on the outside of the case
and watch the scorpion light up under the
black light—like a psychedelic Iron Butter-
ﬂy poster. Scorpions, for reasons known on-
ly to them, ﬂuoresce. ~

tution in Washington, DC, and at the Cin-
cinnati Zoo), San Francisco’s Insect Zoo
opened in the summer of 1979 as a season-
Iong pilot project inside the Children’s Zoo.
“But it was so popular, it never closed,” says
biologist and zoo director Leslie Saul. Saul,
who worked on the San Francisco Zoo’s
raptor and other programs before concen-
trating on entomology, adds that attendance
at the Children’s Zoo jumped 50 percent
shortly after the insects were put on display.
Now a permanent ﬁxture, San F rancis-
co’s Insect Zoo is a clean, well-lighted place -
to examine and learn about more
than 60 species of insects and oth-
er arthropods (spiders, crabs, mil-
lipedes and so on). Most of the
6,000 specimens have been col-
lected from around the state; seme
were imported from other parts of
the world. They are housed in doz-
ens of glass-walled exhibit cases,
just high enough for curious four-
to twelve-year-olds to peer into.
Contrary to expectations, per-
haps, the Insect Zoo is an attrac-
tive place, not at all intimidating.
“If you put insects in a dark, un-
derground place, such as where
reptiles are often displayed,” Saul
explains, “people will uncon-
sciously associate a creepy feeling
with them. The atmosphere that
you create—the lighting, the

Kid-napped goa t
"returned to zoo
after 15 hours

By BILL HALLDIN
Tribune Staff Writer

~ ST. PETERSBURG BEACH - A pygmy goat held
for $500 ransom was returned to her quiet petting 200
home Thursday 15 hours after being abducted.

Pandora, a 4-month-old goat that lives at the Trade-
winds resort on St. Petersburg Beach, was taken at
about 2 am. Thursday.
as... Soon afterward, a clerk there received a telephone
.call from Pandora’s abductor, although at the time nei-
ther the clerk nor security personnel knew the goat had
been taken from the resort’s small petting zoo.

The caller, described as a male with a gravelly
voice, was using rhymes as he spoke and not making
much sense, said St. Petersburg Beach police Detective
Jim Baugher. _

Baugher said the caller told the clerk, “I have Gon-
zalez. I want $500 in 205.”

The hotel employees didn’t know who "Gonzalez”
was, so they didn’t know what to make of the call,

 

Baugher said. Shortly before 3 am, the hotel received ‘

another, similar call. Finally, at about 3:20 am, there
was a third call. '

“The goat is getting very sad,” the caller. said.
“Where’s the money? I want $500 in 205 or the goat’s
dead.”

That was the last the hotel clerk heard from the
caller and the first. clue about the intent of the call.

Next, security personnel checked the outdoor pet-
ting zoo and realized that Pandora, who stands about 18
inches tall and is about 2 feet long, was missing. . ‘

St. Petersburg Beach police-were notified and, as
the day progressed, resort officials worried that Pando-
ra had been harmed.

Pandora has been at the Tradewinds since Easter,
when Sunken Gardens swapped the young pygmy goat
for a Tradewinds rooster, according to Willie Bates, a
spokeswoman for Sunken Gardens. .

Baugher said police called the Society for the Pre-

Police then found out that the SPCA had picked up
the goat after Richard Brady of Treasure Island found
Pandora wandering in traffic at about noon. Brady
found Pandora near Fifth Avenue North and 72nd
Street North, about five miles from the Tradewinds.

After being identified by groundskeeper Don Sway-

who, along with several rabbits, shares space in the
petting zoo.

Pandora had a quick kiss for Bambi but appeared to
be more interested in visiting the feeding station. *3

of dry dog food, the great beasts wrestle in the water
and take turns diving off man-made rocks on what ap- ,

stairs and watch two of the animals swimming around j ' ,
in the glass tank. Their thick, yellowish~white fur was -‘
undulating in the water, and they pushed off the glass
with their back paws, which are as large as baseball

400 pounds and ate 15 or 18 pounds of fish and omnivore
chow a day. ,

- The bears were born in the Buffalo, Omaha, Salt

Just outside the bear exhibit are a couple of snowy
owls, and nearby are the river otters, whose numbers
have been greatly reduced in North America.

There are seven or eight sea lions in a part of the 1

He ShellsOut F 0r 425Turtles, Tortoises

' By Sylvia Townsend
1921987, Los Angeles Daily News
LOS ANGELES
ALTER ALLEN’S museum of

425 live turtles and tortoises
is a hobby that got out of hand.

It started 20 years ago when Allen ~

became enamored of the reptiles
and began buying them.

About eight years ago, Allen, 60,
had so many turtles that he retired
from his family’s oil business and
moved into a house in Orange
County’s Fountain Valley with
enough yard space to accommodate
his pets.

He bought a house next door for
his wife, who doesn’t care for
turtles. _

Eager to share his enthusiasm for
the reptiles with those who do, he
opened his front, side and back
Wants to strangers, who can tour the
place free as long as they call to
make reservations. Casa de Tortuga
(turtle house), informally known as
the turtle museum, is secluded
behind walls and a gate on a quiet
residential street.

To approach, visitors walk up a
driveway, where Allen keeps his two
cars bearing license plates “Turtle”
and “Xturtle” and bumper stickers
proclaiming, “I (heart) my turtle.”

, Martha Young-Wheeler, the
museum’s manager, greets visitors
in the front yard. (Peek inside any
window on the tour and get a
glimpse ot the thousands of turtle

 

“They’re not cuddly like a dog or cat. I
think the reason I like them is that most
people don’t.”

figurines, turtle posters, turtle kites
—- turtle you name it —— that Allen
has collected in the last two
decades)

Outside, tortoises are kept in
wooden shacks with heating for the
cold-blooded animals, fronted by
pens enclosed by low brick walls.

When the tortoises are in their
sheds, Young-Wheeler coaxes them

out with encouragements or shoves. '

Although tortoises can’t hear, they .
can sense vibrations in the air, and
they get the idea when Young-
Wheeler is trying to get them to
move, she said.

Allen’s largest tortoise, a 150-
pound male Galapagos, is in the
front yard. The museum is trying to
breed the reptile with a BOO-pound
female on loan from the Honolulu
zoo. Unfortunately, on their first
meeting, the male wanted to make
war, not love, and the two were
separated. '

After showing visitors the
lumbering, wrinkled, dusty-color
tortoises in the front yard, Yoimg-
Wheeler leadsthem on a pebble
path past cactus plants to the side
yard, where turtles swim in two
ponds _ .. , ,‘ 45;}? -

Unlike tortoises, which have high-
domed shells and cannot swim,
turtles have flatter shells and
webbed feet for life in water.
Tortoises are vegetarians; turtles
are meat eaters. ,

Although some turtles will

. eat out of your hand, others will bite

it, said Young-Wheeler, who has
scars to prove it. Turtles don’t have
teeth, but they have sharp jaws, and
side neck turtles like to snap at
humans. These turtles, whose heads

and necks resemble a snake’s, have .

necks so long, they can’t withdraw
them into their shells, so they twist
them to the side when resting. If you
don’t like snakes,'you might recoil
from the sight of these turtles with
their straining necks.

Although. the museum has some
unusual turtles and tortoises like the

' side neck, it doesn’t have any

endangered species. These include
the sea turtle, hunted for food, turtle
oil and tortoise shell combs; Allen
either bought all his animals or
received them as gifts, except for

» the tortoise or. loan from Hawaii.

This tortoise, a coffee-table-size,
300-pound animal, is staying in a

shed i‘ntyhe back yard. It is 20 years

old, with a life expectancy of 100 to
150 years. ‘

A fraction of the size of the large
tortoises, 174 water turtles swim
about in a stream-shape 2,800-gallon
heated pond in Casa de Tortuga’s
back yard. Their shells and flesh
differ widely in markings, and some
patterns on their heads and webbed
feet resemble patterns on china.
Allen and Young~Wheeler have
names for about 40 of the turtles,
and some will come to their masters
if they gesture and call them.

Allen enjoys getting the water
turtles to perform a trick: He climbs
up on a bridge over the pond, lifts
up a turtle and watches it crawl off

' the edge and splash into the pond.

Allen is clearly affectionate ,
toward his 425 pets and said some
animals return his sentiments-
“Some (tortoises) come out and
want their neck rubbed, others see
you and run to the other side of the
pen,” he said.

“They’re not cuddly like a dog or

cat,” Young-Wheeler admitted. “I

think the reason I like them is that
most people don’t.”

Allen pointed out additional
virtues of turtles and tortoises —
they make good pets for people
allergic to fur, and the only noise
they make is an occasional hiss, or a
cluck when mating.

“If I had 1,000 dogs here,” Allen
said, “I’d get kicked out of the
neighborhood.”

SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER — June 7, 1987

A horse that can rope a cali’B;E

By Walt Wiley

’ McCLATCHY NEWS SERVICE

BIGGS, Butte County —- Bill Em-
erson is 65 now, getting a little gray,
but he’s still training horses and
hoping some day to cash in on his
special way of getting horses to do
his bidding. ~

He’s also still “a little eccentric,”
in the words of a critic, and still
stirring things up when he gets a
chance. .

Emerson lives with his wife,
Myrna, and son, Jay, on an acre of
Butte County’s rich, flat Sacramen-‘
to Valley farm land outside Biggs.

The place teems with all sorts of
livestock, but out back in a wire
corral lives Emerson’s pride and
joy, a spotted horse named Ain’t
Possible -— Ain’t for short

Only these days the horse isn’t ..

going by either of those names; Em-
erson of late has been calling him
Trickles.

“I just figured I’d call him a.

name that had trick in it, since it
seems everyone is so determined to
call this a trick horse, which he
ain’t,” Emerson said with disgust
when he came out the other day to
talk about himself and horses.

Trickles is a horse that knows'

how to rope a calf without a rider

aboard. .
But roping is no trick, Emerson
said; horses are herd animals, and

they have a natural understanding:

' of what’s involved in roping.
2 He explained that by rewarding

' the behavior he wants from a horse, '

‘ he gets the horse to want to do the
very things he wants it to do. And a
horse, being an animal born to run

Lats» “3......“ t...

in a herd, naturally has all the basic
moves of a cow horse.

Emerson comes to his belief
from working around horses and
cows since childhood. All his life,
much of his view of the world has
been over the ears of a horse. He
even missed high school graduation
in Los Molinos because he had to
drive a herd of cows to Ravendale.

w

Another part of
his problem
might be that
Emerson enjoys
stirring things

up.

 

.«m

In recent years he has made his

living shoeing horses, and has.
trained a good number of horses by:
his methods. But he has yet to see
any real commercial success from
his training.

“It just seems like it’s impossible
to get anyone to pay serious atten-
tion,” he said. “They’ll see what
these horses can do, chuckle that
it's a nice trick, then go on doing
things the way they've always been

doing them without ever giving a.

thought to the idea there might be a
better way.”

Part of Emerson’s problem
might be that the performances are
somewhat spectacular.

His horse is able to mount a ped-
estal and spin a rope in its teeth. It

takes the rape in its teeth and reall:
r0pes a calf. It will also lie down

Another part of his probleh
might be that Emerson enjoys stir

gleam of delight as he told of a few

he has been having with the editos .

of Western Horseman magazines"
The editor labeled Emerson an
eccentric and now refuses to us:
any more material on him ,aftei
Emerson fired off a barrage of let
ters taking the editor to task for
calling Ain’t a trick horse.
Emerson has also criticized sucl
TV shows as “That’s Incredible” to:
repeatedly using footage of hin
and Trickles without paying him on
‘even forwarding any mail he might
get from being on the shows. "

. “I tell you, it gets discouraging,’
he said. “The wife and boy -
they’ve both quit this horse busi
ness, don’t see a future in it. Not me
though; I’ll keep following that
dream a little longer. Maybe I’l
hear from 01' Reagan.” ' 3

In h0pe of having 'l‘rickles ‘ap
pear on stage some day, Einersor
has made sure the animal is toilet

trained. The horse will relieve him ,

“That’s what was on the video _

son said, his eyes twinkling with i
suppressed laugh. “I put a sack on

Want to put
on the dog?
Here’s how

By TOM LASSITER

Miami Bureau

BAL HARBOUR — It might go

 

down as the howl heard ’round the ‘

fashion world.

“We believe it’s no longer social-
ly acceptable for a dog to be seen
naked in public,” Ruth Robles said.

“Or to be seen in something off
the rack,” added partner Jane Ul-
loa, who also lives on Key Bis-
cayne.

Thus was born Haut Dog, a line
of high fashion for the pampered
pooch.

Eight sometimes reluctant ca-
nine models unleashed the haute
canine couture on Tuesday before
an appreciative crowd lunching at
a trendy sidewalk cafe here.

“I thought it was fabulous,” said
Monica Heftler of Bal Harbour.

Her Maltese (named Omar Shar-
iff), who dozes in his own brass bed,
soon will be sporting Mutiny on the
Boney, a $160 sailor suit of silk taf-
feta trimmed. in gold lame and
rhinestones, Heftler said.

Especially well received (no buy-
ers, though) was the Till Death Do
Us Bark wedding outfits. For the
bride, there was a gown and four-
foot train of Italian satin, appli-
qued with antique lace and pearls
($300). The groom sported top hat
and tails of silk taffeta ($210).

“Jane’s mother made a trench
coat (London Dog) for her dog,” Ro-
bles said of the source of inspira-
tion for'Haut Dog. “And one day
Jane and I went for a bike ride and
by the time we got back, the whole
line was planned.”

There is no Haut Dog shop
planned. Robles and Ulloa believe
that mail order and private fittings
will offer customers the personal
attention demanded by the upscale
clients they hope to attract.

BOSTON GLOBE - June 8, 1987

By Paul Hirshson
Globe Staff

. ecause of their smiling

expressions and the
way they come up to

. visitors and tip their

heads like friendly
pups, it‘s easy to forget that the
three whales frolicking in the pool
at the New England Aquarium are
really wild animals.

But aquarium officials haven’t
forgotten their wild state. and at
the end of this month they plan to
do something never done before:
They will return the three pilot
whales. who have lived here since
December, to their ocean home.

The story of the three baby
whales began last December on a
beach on Cape Cod, when about
60 whales mysteriously beached
themselves. Most died. ~

Aquarium officials carefully
gathered up three of the smallest
of them. however, and transport-
ed them to a special 60,000—gallon
tank at their Boston waterfront
facility and began to nurse them
back to health.

“We treated them as animals
in severe stress or shock," said
John Prescott. aquarium director.

He explained that whales on land .

suffer from oxygen deprivation to
their muscles brought on by their
own weight. because their circula-
tory systems are designed for their
relatively weightless underwater
environment.

Charming creatures

For nearly six months. their
caretakers regularly weighed
them, tested their blood, gave
them medicine and fed them - up
to 40 pounds of fish apiece every
day (“We had to teach them ali to
eat,” Prescott said), and now the
staff is ready to say goodbye to
them. . _

Whales, healthy now,

to be set free

.i "N: . .,..

Pilot Whale nursed back to health at aquarium.

The whales, all males, are
charming creatures. Sleek, black
and shiny. they dive, spew water
from their blowholes, peer cur-
iously near the edge of the pool,
and make whaley noises. Each
was named: Notch, because of the
piece missing from his dorsal fin;
Tag, because he had been tagged
on the beach, and Baby. because
he is the baby of the bunch and,
in fact, had not been weaned from
his mother when he was stranded.

The three are from 11/2 to 21/2
years old. All are about eight or
nine feet long and weigh between
about 800 pounds and a little
more than 1,000 pounds. They
have all gained weight since arriv-
ing at the aquarium. A full—grown
pilot whale typically is 10 to 20
feet long and and weighs from one
to two tons.

Watching them frolic and dive

for their meals of fish, thrown to

them by their attendants, under-

scores one of the concerns that
aquarium officials have: that the
whales, which are social, curious
beings, may become too domesti—
cated and dependent on human
support and companionship.
“We’ve limited human contact
as much as possible,” explained
Mimi Brown Simpson, spokes-
woman for the aquarium. No pub-
lic access has been permitted to
the whale pool, and visiting, ex—
cept, for direct—care workers, has
been limited to a half-hour a day.
Whether the whales will suffer
from their stay here, whether they
have gotten “too soft" to survive
the open ocean, is an unanswered
question. -
“We just don‘t know." said
Leslie Kaufman, curator of educa-
tion. “We've learned a lot about

  
   

the physiology of whales. we’ve de—
veloped a set of protocols that any-
one can use to rescue stranded
whales. . .we have the techniques
for handling them without hurt-
ing them." But the scientists don't
know what will happen in the
ocean.

One mystery that the aquar—
ium has studied is why whales
and other seagoing mammals
sometimes strand themselves on
beaches in what seem to be mass
suicides. Prescott, asked if their
study of the three pilot whales had
shed any light on that, said there
are still no firm answers:

“I’m hypothesizing. . .when
they feed in the shallow water of
Cape Cod bay and it is stirred up
by a storm, you generally get pilot
whales on the beach. The survival
strategy that made them stick to-
gether in the open ocean water is
lethal in shallow water. That’s

just one more theory in a big line

of theories."

At the end of the month, a
ship, the Albatross IV, belonging
to the National Oceanic and Atmo-
spheric Administration, will take
the whales about 140 miles out to
sea in hopes of placing them near
an existing herd. .

The whales will be tagged with
radio transmitters, Prescott said,
including one that will beam its
signal to a satellite, enabling sci-
entists to track their movements
for about three weeks. One pur-
pose of that device is to learn
whether the three “orphans” join
an existing herd, whether they
will be allowed to join, or whether
they can survive on their own.

Why release them at all? “This
is the next step in an ongoing de-
tective story," said Prescott. “lt’s
putting clues together to learn
what these animals are doing.”

ear Readers: A personal note. I lost one

of the true loves of my life last week.

Her name was Krista, and she was a

family pet for 14 years. Her sudden
death in a freak accident made me think about
what’s really important to me in life. She had
been With me through the births of my three
boys, through my divorce, and more. No matter
how I changed, whether I came home mad, sad or
glad, she was always the same -— unconditionally
loving. -

As 3 singles columnist and psychologist, I’m
often asked, “Who is your rOIe model, and what
are you looking for in an ideal mate?” I must say,
that until now I had not really put it all together.
I have met movie stars, and even a president of
the United States, but I can’t honestly say that I
was impressed. What impresses me is someone
who personifies unconditional love, like Hazel
Westing, an octogenarian single Denverite who
has spent the past 30 years collecting, cleaning,
and repairing mountains of throwaway clothes
and sending them to Africa. I’m truly in awe
around pe0ple who seem to say, “I only have
what I am now giving, and I choose to let love be
what I stand for.” '

And my ideal role model for loving was living .

right under my nose for 14 years and I never
really knew it. Krista offered the type of quali-
ties that I’d like to emulate as well as look for in
an ideal mate.

I When I would give her my anger, she would
not automatically return it, but would be patient
and give me love and space so I could regain my
balance by understanding that my real emotions
were hurt, fear and discouragement about my
own. inadequacies.

could trust her to'accept me as I am . .. fallible
and human.

‘ experience being a more whole person, she would

be able to totally receive with genuine enthusi-
asm which would warm my heart and help me

more.

she would stand by me and my children, to the
death if necessary, and I could then face fearful
situations with a sense of “we” instead of just
“I.”

I When I wanted to let out the child inside of
me to play, she would not be embarrassed to
gleefully join in and share such passion and ex-

mutual joy and make magic moments just by the

spontaneous sparkle in our eyes.

proud and lucky to be in love with someone who
had the qualities of my loving canine friend. ’

DMHA makes keepingpetseasiei

7 By Jim Bland
STAFF WRITER

The elderly and handicapped should find it easier
and cheaper to keep pets in their Dayton Metropoli-
tan Housing Authority homes because of policy
changes the authority’s board adopted Monday.

The major policy change is elimination of a re—
quirement -— part of temporary regulations adopted
in 1985 — that cat and dog'owners buy $100,000 in
liability insurance. -

Many elderly people, who have to be low-income
’ to qualify for public housing. had argued the insur-

ance requirement excluded them from having dogs
, and cats as pets.
The handicapped and elderly pet owners still must

make a $200 security deposit and are liable for all -'
damages caused by their pet, and for cleaning, de-

licing and deodorizing the premises.

David Marker, management director for DMHA.
estimated there are 30 to 40 residents with pets in the
approximately 1,600 units for the elderly and
. handicapped.

Excluded from the new policy are animals (such as ;
; seeing-eye dogs, but not limited to them) that assist_'
' the handicapped. The policy recognizes the animals 1

as necessary aids to ensure the handicapped person’s

independence. The policy does require the animals be ,

certified and properly trained.

Another requirement removed from earlier policy ,
was that the front feet of cats had to be declawed 7

before being allowed in the building; female dogs and

cats more than 6 months old had 7 ’
to be -
males over 8 months had to be neutered. spayed, and

DALLAS TIMES HERALD - June 8, 1987

AnimaIpark’s
spring 5316 offers
to ucb ofexo tic

_B_y_ Floyd Whaley
or THE TIMES HERALD STAFF

If you’ve been looking for an unusual pet
a Central Texas animal park’s spring clear-
ance sale will outﬁt you with a Bengal tiger
and perhaps take your car as a trade-in.

But don’t expect to settle the beast in
your back yard. Though anyone can buy the
animals, most municipalities won’t allow ex-
otic pets within city limits, and they require
special and expensive care, said Stanley
Davidoff of Wild World Animal Park.

The park, which breeds and sells wild ani-
mals, “will take anything of value,” in pay-
ment for them, according to an advertise—
ment in state newspapers. The park is 23
miles east of Austin on Texas Highway 71

, and maintains about 100 animals.

You can get anything on the lot for $2,000
or less, including Bengal tiger cubs. Wolf
cubs go for $500, monkeys for $500 and
talking parrots for $350. Pythons are a bar-
gain at $150.

Buyers are told how to care for animals
they purchase, Davidoff said. But the park
never exhausts its supply of animals; pets

1 and breeding stock are retained.

“It’s our own 200. These animals are all

our own pets,” Davidoff said. “We just let
._ everyone else come and take a look.”

Park owner Ted Wenk said that after sev-
en years he has yet to make a proﬁt selling

i big cats and other exotic animals. But the

park frequently rakes in some lucrative re-

; turns -- from zoos, circuses and individuals,

many of whom buy newborn animals only
to bring them back a few years later.
“Ninety percent of the cats (sold to indi-
viduals) come back to us within the ﬁrst two
or three years,” Davidoff said. “A lady

comes in with her husband and buys a little

‘. 5-pound tiger. When it grows up and be-
‘ comes a 500—pound cat that can kill them,
3 they call us back.”

 

 




warrants came due.

Incredibly, at any given
time her suburban home in
West Palm Beach, Fla, has
55 to 60 dogs living in it —-—,
and she gives them food,
care and affection until she
can find them other homes.

“Julie has a fierce love of
animals. Without her, many
more animals would never
leave here,” says Jacquie
Sembric, who supervises
adoptions at the West Palm
Beach- Animal Regulation
Center.

“She adopts the under-
dogs -- the poor, homely lit.
tle dogs that probably would
not be saved. Then she ad-
vertises and gets these dogs
to loving families. She’s
adopted over 2,000 dogs
since I’ve been here -— all at
her‘ own expense.”

Julie, 56, told The EN-
QUIRER:

“I look for those unfortu-
nate little creatures, some-
times with apparent health
problems, that I know will
never be adopted.

“When I .look into the
cages and see those soulful
eyes looking back at me, I
just can’t ignore them.”

“I found myself crying in

“These wonderful little

Sure-Fire Way To 1
“Shut Up Cat Lovers

LEARNED MY LESSON and the lesson is never
to say anything bad about cats.

. It’s not worth it. There are more cat lovers in
the world than cat realists.

, On Wednesday in this space, we talked about
the big Cato-Rama, a festival of cats held in San '
Francisco by the SPCA. All I said was the truth.
Cats shed hair, make rackets,;rip up sofas and kill .
anything smaller than themselves with great. de- ’
light. '
Look, these are unbiased facts. Peeple say
you mustn’t. blame a cat for being a cat. 1 dis-
agree, Sure, a cat. is just being a cat. That‘s the

problem. ~ ,

A mosquito is just being a mosquito, but that

doesn’t stop people ’ '
_ from swatting them.

Ever since 1 had
the courage to set
down these unbiased
facts on paper, the
phone has been mak-
ing more [of a racket
than an alley eat in
heat. The mailbox has
been jammed.

There‘s only one
thing more snarling
and surly than a cat,
and that‘s a person who owns one.

“Your horrible column is an insult to the
most noble animal on earth,” said one letter.

“Cat haters are insecure people who find a
smart and independent animal like the cat
threatening to their being,” said, another.

“Your column was unfit. tO be shredded for

"I used to read Steve Rubenstein’s column.

No more. What. a creep,” said another.
l-lE TELEPHONE CALLS were worse. Cat lov-
ers have a sweet whine to their voices. it
resembles the sweet whine of a dentist’s drill.
Most cat lovers seem to be old,‘ female and
slightly dotty. Almost every one asked me how, l
ever got a .job in journalism, a fair question.- -.
The way to handle such callers is easy..Agree
with them. That’s what I did. lt’s the only thing
that. makes a cat lover shut up.

A calico cat who took a lonely.
hungry ll~day trip to California.
after getting trapped in a moving
van will return to Brookline in

comfort via a Delta Airlines L-

1011 tonight.

When in the Boston area,
“Checkerboard” resides with Lau-
rie Mittel,. 24. of Brookline, who
rescued the 11/2-year-old cat from
an animal shelter a year ago.

Mittel, who runs a day-care

' center in her home, said she
Lthought Checkerboard - or

“Cheeky" - had gone to an accus-

3 tomed refuge — a neighbor’s St.
Paul’s Street apartment — when

she did not turn up on May 23.
“When Cheeky did not come
home the next day, I figured she
must have been stolen," Mittel
said.
But on, June 2, Mittel got a call
from a woman in San Francisco

; who saw a skinnier, somewhat

cowed Cheeky slink out of a mov-
ing van.

“‘She was meowing pitifully, so
I took her in," Nancy Preisendanz
said from San Francisco yester-
day. Preisendanz said Cheeky ate
all of the food that she had on
hand for her own cat. “After a
while she was sitting quietly,
soaking up rays."

Preisendanz had traced Mittel

by a tag that Cheeky were around
her neck.
. Brookline veterinarian Rodney
W. Polling, who said cats can live
up to three weeks without food,
does not rank Cheeky’s story with
one about a kitten who sUrvived
being plastered into a wall for sev—
eral weeks.

Mittel said she will welcome
the cat home with melon rinds,- -.
pasta and yogurt - a few of
Cheeky’s favorite foods — before
her reunion with the family rab-
bit, Hopper. and a second eat, Car-

Life With Trixie

A man and his dogs. By Ben J. Stein

rixie is not the
first dog I had
after I became an

 

 

adult, or even the

second. I got the
first one almost 15 years ago,
and named her Mary. She
was a gray-furred, blue-
eyed Weimaraner. She fell
asleep by sucking my
thumb until she nodded off.
From the day my girlfriend
and I carried her from San
Francisco to Santa Cruz in a

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

napkin, Mary lived with me
-—-for ten years. The girlfriend
came and went. Mary stayed.
"A man and his dog" is more
than a phrase.

Mary and I were together
in a tiny apartment in San-
ta Cruz, in a small house in
Georgetown, in a pent-
house in Brooklyn Heights,
in an apartment on the Sun-
set Strip, in a rambling cha-
teau in Aspen, in a tumble-
down apartment in Malibu,
and mostly in a funky split-
level in Hollywood. When I
got Mary, I was a teacher and
a hippie. Subsequently, I became a trial
lawyer, a White House speechwriter,
a columnist, a sitcom writer, a Holly—
wood tourist often years’ duration, un—
married, married and respectable.
Everything in my life changed, except
Mary’s perfect sensitivity, loyalty, and
her sucking my thumb to fall asleep.

Mary died on April 20, 1982, after a
long struggle with cancer. Eight years
before, she had skittered down the
marble hallways of the White House
to see me when I worked on the
Watergate defense team. On her last
day, she skittered along a veterinar-
ian’s ceramic tile into my arms and
then into eternity.

It was by far the worst day of my life.
To ward off our grief, my wife and I
got another Weimaraner from an ani—

had a tiny tuft at the end.
When she entered our

she were trying to wag her

her for reasons not then
known. He had called her
Tiffany, which is fine for a
call girl, but not right for the
Ingrid Bergman of dogs. We
called her Trixie, at my
wife’s suggestion.

In the beginning, she
slept next to the bed. When
I would awake to another
hazy day, Trixie would give
me a look that I have seen in
movies but never in real life.
The look said: ”I am warm.

from outer space: her tail grows meas-

phases of the moon, and then shorter

cabinets. She repeatedly chewed up
the inside of my car, released the park-
ing brake and sent it crashing into a
neighbor's Saab. A dog psychologist
(I told you I live in LA.) suggested we
get her a dog companion.

Two weeks later, we went to the

Trixie would watch television with
me in the guest room, then cry when
I left to get into bed with my wife. She
did not want to share. She wagged her

the most natural thing in the world for
us to continue to watch television

guest room and the television set.
Trixie was always waiting for me with
smoky eyes and wagging tail.

Trixie did not like to be left alone.
About six months after I got her, I had
to stay up in Santa Cruz after a week-
end there with my wife. When my
wife came home without me, Trixie
started to growl. Then she bit Martha,
the Weimaraner. My wife did the for-
bidden. She got into a dogfight. In an
instant, Trixie bit my wife’s wrist
i severely. Our housekeeper’s knee
was gnawed to the cartilage. When I
got home, my wife was in Cedars-
Sinai on intravenous antibiotics. The
housekeeper was in bed at her daugh-
ter's home in Pasadena. Martha was
at the vet’s, under observation. Trix-
ie was in the guest bedroom wagging
her tail.

I offered to shoot Trixie ritually in

 

the backyard. My vision was of Car—

bo as Mata Hari, exhaling a final puff '

as she faced the firing squad. (Need-
less to say, I could never have done it.)
But my wife is a saint, the housekeep-
er is a saint, and Martha is from
another planet; so they all forgave
Trixie, and she escaped retribution.

Now time has passed. Children
look at me and say, "Look at that old
man (I am 42) with that beautiful dog."
But Trixie has stayed as young and
perfect as When she first wagged her
way into our lives.

My wife has become a high party of-
ficial in Hollywood. She takes break-
fast meetings at the Polo Lounge. She
leaves the house before 1 do. Then,
' each morning, I hear a rustling and a
snuffling, feel a warm, furry Trixie
chest and little insistent paws. Trixie
gives me a warm lick on my nose.

For a few minutes, I do not think
about how much richer Michael Eis-
ner is than I am, why my scripts never
get made, why we live in a funky
shack while everyone we know lives
in Brentwood Park, or why I have to get
older. I don't think about anything.

I only feel Trixie's warmth and her
yielding, furry, loyal, giving, jealous
self and see myself in her enormous
brown eyes. Dogs know nothing of
mortality. She sees me and knows that
I will be there forever, and she will be
forever in my arms. For a few minutes
every morning, and sometimes late a
night, Iknow it, too. A

Ori, a "tame gray. fox, enjoys Some affection from Jim
- Lander, who with his wife, Becky, cares for sick, injured
and abandoned wild animals on their Central Texas farm.

 

Couple are angels of mercy

By Jan Mosley

Temple Daily Telegram

BELTON, Texas — Jim and Becky
Lander have an extended family.
Among their “children” they list
Prissy, Arnold, Madison, Avenue,
Belvedere, Sadie, Hawkins and Coy.

What makes this family unusual
is the fact that the “children” are
sick, injured or abandoned wild ani-
mals entrusted to the Landers’ care.

Prissy, for example, is a young
javelina — a house pet who follows
Becky’s every footstep. Arnold is a
year-old javelina kept in an outdoor
pen. Madison, whom Becky calls
“my baby,” and Avenue are adopted
raccoons from the Dallas area.

An unlikely houseguest, Belved-
ere is a young great horned owl that
now rules the roost. Sadie and Haw-
kins, a beautiful pair of peacocks,
strut up and down the driveway
and perch on any available vehi-
cles. Coy, an intelligent coyote, is
an adopted pup from the town of
Holland.

There are also prairie dogs, wild
turkeys, bobcats, a crow named
Jake, tortoises, squirrels, foxes, a
doe, a buzzard and a multitude of
more domestic animals such as
Yorkshire terriers, German shep-
herds, a quarter horse and various
cats.

The Landers’ 22-acre farm is situ-
ated in the scenic, rolling country
west of Belton. The house sits atop a
hill and affords a panoramic view
of the'countryside. Just behind the
house are the cages and pens.

Jake the crow keeps the’clan in
stitches as he imitates an emer-
gency siren. Jake came from a Hous-
ton family. “I guess being raised in
Houston, he just naturally learned
the sound of sirens,” Lander said.
Jake patiently followed Lander
from cage to cage.

 

 




for hapless Wild creatures

Several baby jackrabbits inhabit
a cage in the Landers’ garage, re
ceiving milk from a baby bottle.
Lander stopped to pay special at-
tention to Ori, a tame gray fox. “He
was born here. His parents are
down there,” Lander said, gestur-
ing toward a ,pair of beautifully
marked foxes. ’ '
Prissy, the domesticated javelina
who freely roams the house, was
bottle-fed a mixture of half-and-half
and vitamins from the time she was
4 hours old. “Her mother died dur-
ing birth,” Mrs. Lander said, “and
she was 4 hours old by the time Jim
got to Dallas to get her.”
Prissy now dines on_ cat food or
dog food, lettuce and, her favorite,
grapes. .
Lander said the animals are his
"hobby — “and,” he added with a
laugh, “my religion.”
Lander’s interest in animals was
sparked when he was 9 years old.
“My daddy brought me a baby squir-
rel,” he recalled.
The Landers often take the ani-
mals they care for to area schools,
teaching “animal appreciation” to
children. ‘ ,
In addition to his work with ani-
mals, Lander has another full-time
job, as events coordinator for the
new Bell County Exposition Center
in Belton. He is a former road mana-
ger for a rock music group.
Both Jim and Becky Lander are
licensed by the state and federal
governments to provide the care
necessary to rehabilitate the ani-
mals. Their home and grounds have
been inspected by state and federal
authorities, and meet rigid guide-
lines, Lander said. '

' Lander has done extensive re-
search about the habitats, dietary
requirements and general care for
each of the animals, Mrs. Lander
said. “He has two book cases full of

books about the animals,” she said,
“and he is constantly reading.”

The Landers also rely on the vol-
unteer services of Dr. Warren Dunn
of the Belton Veterinary Clinic,
who charges them only for medica-
tion. “He’s a great asset to us,” Mrs.
Lander said.

The director of the Cen-Tex Zoo,
Tim Jones, also helps. Jones’ wife
runs the 200’s nursery and has pro-
vided the Landers with a wealth of
information and assistance in deal-
ing with the very young animals,
Mrs. Lander said.

In return, the Landers, who have
had good luck at breeding certain
animals, have given offspring to the
zoo.

Jim Lorenz, game warden with
the Texas Parks and Wildlife De-
partment, works closely with the
Landers. He said they have become

experts at nurturing the game ani—'

mals and have a deep and abiding
respect for all the animals they lov-
ingly adopt. - ._v

“I can’t tell you how many times
I’ve called them at 2 o’clock in the
morning with an animal that
needed care,” he said.

“If it wasn’t for Jim and Becky,
we would have to deStroy many of
these animals To rehabilitate
and reintroduce them into the wil-

derness is amazing . .. They (the »

Landers) have spent a lot of time
and money . .. I don’t know how
we’d do it without them.”

Lorenz said a continuing prob-
lem is that of wildlife being struck
by cars.

And this is the time of year, the
game warden 'said, when many peo-
ple will take home a fawn they be-

lieve to be abandoned because it’

has been hidden temporarily by its
mother while she looks for food.
Without the natural immunities its
mother’s milk provides, the infant

deer will quickly become ill. This
type of well-intended interference,
Lorenz said, is devastating to the
animals. “In the case of a spotted
fawn, you sign that fawn’s death
warrant when you pick him up.”

“It’s against the law to pick up
game animals,” Lorenz said, and vi-
olators may be fined up to $200 plus
court costs.

The stories of how the animals
came to live with the Landers are
varied.

The owl, Belvedere, was the vic-
tim of a storm that hit the Temple
area this spring. Two baby owls
were in their nest when the storm
hit. .

High winds tumbled the nest
from the tree, and because of the
young owls’ size, the mother was
unable to return them to the nest.
Then a dog attacked the baby owls.
“They were in bad shape when Jim

got them,” Lorenz said.

One owl died, Lorenz said, but

,Belvedere is thriving. “He eats only

mice,” Lander said. Belvedere is
about 4 months old.

Mrs. Lander works with Belved-
ere each day on an exercise pro-
gram, strengthening his wing mus-
cles and grip. His talons are begin-
ning to get very sharp, Mrs. Lander
said, and 'she wears a welding glove
when doing the exercises.

“He has no mother to teach him
now, so we do exercises like this,”
she said, coaxing Belvedere onto
her hand and beginning a series of
up and down movements, encourag-
ing the owl to fly a short distance.
“This also helps him learn to grip,”
she said, “because I don’t want him
to fall off a branch if a wind blows
hard.” ~ '

“It’s just like having a regular
family,” Lander said, “constantly
having to look ahead and plan.”

Karen Sussman, president of the
Arizona chapter of the Interna-

the perfect solution: Bring all of the
excess animals to Arizona.

The state has only about 125 wild

Thomas said.
* Elaine Marquis, assistant area
manager for the BLM’s Kingman
district, said the proposed policy
does not affect Arizona’s burros
because adoption demand far ex-
ceeds the supply.‘

Sussman said an offer has been
made by a person, whom she
[refused to identify, to buy some
private land and lease from the
state other land totaling 791,000
acres for what she calls a “free-‘
reaming sanctuary” for horses and. ‘

between $6 and $20.

“The horses are locked in to

We all know
the devastating ef-
fect divorce can
have on children.
But I’ll bet you
never stopped to
think about the
trauma a breakup
can cause the fam-

MARYLN ,
tly pet.

SCHWARTZ
Well, thank

 

goodness for William Griffin.

He’s a New York pet psychologist who’s
working to make sure Fido doesn’t get
caught up in too much depression when
his owners decide to maintain separate
households.

Griffin has even made an audio cas-
sette, Happy Pets ($9.95), on which he de-
votes some time to this very problem. He
was in Dallas last week promoting the

tape.

it’s a trauma

“Dogs, particularly, can go through se-
vere emotional strain when a marriage is
breaking up,” Griffin says. “Now don’t

laugh. Just think for a minute. A dog that’s ‘

an integral part of a family is very sensi-
tive to the moods and emotions of that
family.

“And when the time comes for the final
split, don’ 1 you think the dog is well aware
that some important person has gone out
of its life?”

At the beginning of the problems, there
is no way to explain marital discord to a
much-loved cocker spaniel. So, he says, it
is important to prepare the animal in
other ways for what’s coming, just as you
would prepare a small child.

“If this is a dog you both have spent
time with together,” he says, “make it a

point for both partners to spend separate .

time with the pet before the actual divorce

. takes place.

”That way, it won’t be such a shock

when one of the partners is suddenly

gone.”
He also recommends special treats for

the dog when tensions are at their worst.
“When the owners are so unhappy at

times like this, they become very self-cen-

1 tered. As a result, they Often neglect their
i pets. By making an effort to give Special

attention and special treats, the dog will

_ know it’s still loved and wanted.

._1

 

7 “You’ll probably be doing this with
your kids. It’s very easy to make sure the

. pet is included.

“You know,” he says, “there are even
divorces where joint custody for a pet is
written into the divorce decree. That’s not
so ridiculous. If a dog has been a member
of a family for, say, five or 10 years, they

' are like a member of the family.

“You don’t just toss aside a member of
the family.”

Griffin says he has added divorce ad.
vice to his tips for pet owners because so

many of his clients are in unhappy rela-

tionships.
Griffin will make house calls, which

, start at $100. Owners can bring animals to
. his clinic for $45. He says business is excel-

lent.

“People are crazy about their pets,” he
says. “They will do a lot to make sure they
are happy.’

On a first visit, he tries to find out
what’s troubling the owner. That usually
gives him a clue as to what is troubling the
dog. '

"But all too often,” he says, “they come

to me after the harm has been done. We

have to work extra long and hard tohave
a happy animal once again.”

Pet shrinks are In

He says he’s seen some dogs who’ve be- i

come so depressed, they’ve just stopped
eating.
“When this happens,” he says, “You

' know the dog is really upset. I don’t care
f how busy your schedule is, devote more
1 time to the dog. When he is more relaxed,

he’ll start eating again.”

Griffin is also a firm believer in ex-
ercise as part of the treatment.

“I recommend you work out an exercise

1 routine of running and playing with your

dog. It helps mentally as well as physically.
This isn’t just for problems, but at any

-, time.”

Griffin says no one should laugh at the
idea of a pet psychologist The idea is cer-
tainly not new.

“Celebrities like David Letterman, Lily
Tomlin and Robert De Niro have openly
talked about getting therapy for dogs,”
Griffin says. “This is just part of what’s
going on in the world today. If your best
friend was having problems, you’d send
him or her to a professional.

“And isn’t dog, after all, man’s best

. friend?”

l ANIMAL CONTROL LAW l

A new Broward County animal control law went into effect

on Wednesday. Violators Of the 15 offenses listed in the ordi-

nance may be ticketed $20 for a first offense, $50 for a sec-

ond offense, $100 for a third and $500 for a fourth. The of-

Staff Writer

Stray animals brought to Broward Coun- ‘ ‘

ty’s two pounds now have a shorter lease
on life because of a comprehensive animal

control ordinance that went into effect on .

Wednesday.

Stray animals brought to local animal .

shelters previously were held for five

working days before they could be injected

with lethal doses of sodium pentabarbitol.
Now, untagged dogs and cats can be de-

stroyed 72 hours after they arrive at the .

shelter. Tagged animals have 120 hours —
five calendar days.

“It will move the animals through here
faster,” said Larry Atwell, acting director
of the county’s Animal Control Division.

“Sometimes it’s more humane to put ani-
mals to sleep after a shorter period of
time,” Atwell said.

The ordinance, approved by the County
Commission on May 12, also empowers an-
2111131 control officers to issue 320 to $500

tickets for 15 offenses covered in the ordi--
nance. Violations range from keeping a V1-‘

cious dog to letting a pet defecate on a

Sulser, assis-
tant director of the county’s Health
and Public Safety Department.

The new law applies throughout
the county, and law enforcement
officers can begin issuing tickets
immediately for the 15 offenses
covered by the ordinance.

In about two months, the coun-
ty’s 10 animal control road officers
also will be equipped to write tick-
ets, Atwell said.

Former animal control director
Rick Collard said the “basic meter-
maid authority” is the new law’s
most crucial facet. Several of the
15 offenses have been on the books
for years but were not enforced, he
said.

“We just couldn’t do the job. I
mean, it’s just ridiculous. I’d never
worked in a place where animal
control officers didn’t have the au-

, thority to issue tickets,” Collard

said.

Collard left the county job in -

March to become director of the

 

Humane Society of Broward Coun-
ty, a private organization that has
its own shelter. Before switching
jobs, Collard wrote most of the new
ordinance. -

To his and Atwell’ s surprise, they
said, no apposition surfaced and the
ordinance quietly was adopted by
the County Commission.

Atwell said he expected resis-
tance to the shorter waiting period
before disposing of animals, which
he considered the most important
aspect of the new law.

Four Broward cities— Pompano
Beach, Coral Springs, Lauderhill
and Margate— have their own ani-
mal control officers, but send un-
claimed animals to county shelters.

About 13,000 animals were de-
strayed last year at the two county
shelters, Collard said. Another
7, 200 were destroyed at the Hu-
mane Society shelter.

The county’ s largest pound,
which has a capacity of about 250
animals, is at 1871 SW 40th St., at
the west end of Fort Lauderdale—
Hollywood International Airport.
The smaller pound is in Pompano
Beach, at 3100 NW 19th Terrace off
Powerline Road.

The Humane Society shelter Is at
2070 Griffin Road, three blocks
west of Interstate 95.

Poor demsron ' J
on wild horses

The Bureau of Land Manage-
_ ment's decision to kill up to 10,000
wild horses and burros is another
example of the Reagan adminis-
tration‘s conscious decision to sac-
rifice our natural resources, min-
. eral and animal, to profit. ~

According to the article, in the ,
. May 22 Post, the BLM started with .

1,700 wild horses and burros in
1971. In the past 16 years, that
, number has grown to 54,000, in-
, cluding the 10,000 they propose to
destroy.

Any responsible farmer could
have told BLM how to control this
increase: Geld the stallions and
. jacks. Instead, the BLM wants to
penalize the animals for doing
what comes naturally.

Worse than their failure to re-
sponsibly manage the herds,
though, is their apparent greed.
With domestic animals outnum-
bering the wild ones-98 to one, 4.3
million to 44,000 left after the
20,000 are destroyed, the BLM
would rather collect $1.35 per do-
mestic animal per month than pre-
serve the wild horses and burros

that have contributed so much to f.

the national identity.

Recently, a peregrine hen laid a
clutch of four eggs on a ledge at
the ‘16th floor of the McCormack
Federal Building in Boston, the
first percgrines to nest in Mass-

and save the peregrine offspring.
They stole the peregrine eggs
and substituted‘chicken eggs, just
to give the peregrines something
to sit on. Then they took the per-
egrine eggs to the World Center for
Birds of Prey in Boise. Idaho, to
hatch. ' -

TAMPA TRIBUNE - June 14, 1987

" Alabama turtle on threatened list -.

WASHINGTON — In a victory for environmen-
talists, the federal government has placed the Ala-
bama flattened musk turtle on its list of threatened
species. This will keep the turtles from being col-
lected by dealers who sell them for pets.

The five-inch ﬂattened musk turtle is native to
steams in the upper Black Warrior River system in
north Alabama. ,

Placement on the threatened species list means
the animal is likely to become endangered in the
near future without federal protection. The endan-
gered species list indicates the animal is in danger
of extinction.

The fund said the turtle is threatened by over-
collecting by commercial dealers and degradation
of its habitat from coal mining, forestry, agriculture

and industrial and residential sewage.

When nature depletes its own, it leaves noth-

Those who oppose steel-jaw traps exagger-

individuals who use them; In New Jersey, an
animal-rights group won a trapping ban.
Now it is lobbying to ban bow hunting. So
there is an unseen threat to all Missouri

In the late ’705, Missouri banned the har-
vest of fox and bobcat because of their low
numbers. This was an ethical measure; now
they have increased in numbers. In Genesis,
it states that God gave man dominion over
the animals. This means the prudent use of
animals for man andrhis needs.

“The Oakland zoo is really

zoo director Jeff Hill. “It’s an East

Yesterday, administrators of
the East Bay Regional Park District
said they have been participating
for weeks in talks to save the zoo.
They expressed disappointment
that the $2.6 million is being used as
a bargaining chip.

“I think there are more states-

\

A Crass Menagerie

Is the World Ready for Patented, Genetically Engineered Animals?

am alarmed as well as fascinated by
the US. Patent and Trademark
Office’s decision to patent invented
animals.

By invented animals they evidently
mean new animal types, or perhaps new
species, created by splicing genes.

At first glance this proposal seems
innocent enough. Through genetic
manipulation we can have cows that give
more milk, sheep that bear more wool,
dogs that don’t bark, and so on.

Producing new types through genetic
manipulation is much faster than the
old-fashioned method of selective
breeding, which can take many
generations.

But knowing human nature, we know
that our biologists, once they get the
green light, are not going to stop with
simply increasing a cow’s milk or making
a thoroughbred horse run faster.

Man is an experimental creature and
will do what he can do.

For centuries we have been breeding
the jackass to the mare to produce the
mule. And what do we have? An animal
that is strong but stubborn beyond human
endurance; and which, alas, is incapable
of breeding with its own kind. The mule
is a dead end.

Some zoos, I believe, have produced
ligers by breeding lions and tigers. This is
an exotic animal that captures our fancy,
but if I’m not mistaken ligers cannot -
breed successfully either.

I’m sure, however, that science will

6 LOS ANGELES TIMES MAGAZINE, JUNE 7, 1987

 

find a way around this roadblock, and that
our new invented creatures will soon be
breeding away like rabbits. We will have
to declare open season on them so
hunters can keep them under control,
like mountain lions.

I suppose that in granting patents for
invented animals the Patent Office
merely has its eye on the development of
salable products, all of which will
contribute to the national economy.

What if, for example, we were able to
produce a cow that gave light beer
instead of milk? That would probably
revitalize the dairy industry and bring
back good times to all the farm states.

We who watch the beer ads during
football games on television would soon
be regaled by commercials showing
buxom, pink-cheeked “beermaids”
squeezing pails full of foamy beer from
contented cows.

Who knows but what some genius in
the laboratory will actually come up with
an umbus, “a sort of cow” invented by Dr.
Seuss. If you remember, the umbus has
one head and one tail, like any ordinary
cow, but . . . .

She has 98 faucets that give mil/e quite
nicely/ Perhaps 99/ I forget just precisely.

I suppose that would still be a cow,
though an amazing one indeed.

But inevitably, some kinky biologist
will want to go a little further and create a
new species. An individual animal‘
wouldn’t have to be very much different
from an existing species to be declared a
new one by the taxonomists, who make
up their own rules.

I wonder how the Patent Office will
rule on such animals, if they should ever
appear. What if some scientist, tinkering
with the genes of the camel, turns out a
spazzim?

The spazzim, as every reader of Dr.
Seuss knows, is a kind of cross between a
yak and a camel, except that it has an
arabesque set of antlers that travelers may
use for hanging up such articles as their
umbrellas, clocks, coffee cups, and
grasshopper cages.

A beast who belongs to the Nazzz’m of

 

Bazzz'm/ Handy for travelz’ng/ That’s why
he has ’z’m. /M0re easy to pack than a
suitcase or grzp/ T hose horns carry all
that he needs on a mp.

I doubt that the spazzim will ever
replace the automobile, but it ought to be
a welcome innovation in the lands of the
nomads, if there are any left. _

Would our'unknown biologist get a
patent for the spazzim, since he gave it
life? Or would the patent belong to Dr.
Seuss, who thought up the spazzim and
brought him into being first, if only on
paper?

I see all kinds of litigation arising from
the awarding of patents for new species.
DR. SEUSS SUES TO PROTECT FUDDLE
FROM PATENT INFRINGEMENT. . .
BIOLOGIST CLAIMS HE CREATED THE
YUZZ. . . .Andsoon.

But there are moral as well as practical
uncertainties in this development.

Isn’t it man’s ultimate arrogance to
encroach on God’s exclusive right to
create species?

Actually, God has done an astounding
job. There are a million species of animal
life on earth, each one different from the
others, and in their variety they are even
more improbable than the inventions of
Dr. Seuss.

Has Dr. Seuss invented anything more
wonderful than the kangaroo and the
wallaby, who carry their children in a ,
pouch; the trapdoor spider, who builds a.
door to lure victims into his parlor;
Micromalthus dehz'lz's, a tiny male ﬂy that,
after five days of life, devours its mother;
the bat, the hippopotamus, the praying
mantis, the penguin, the giraffe, the
monarch butterﬂy?

The Patent Office is not yet prepared to
issue patents on human alterations. But
sooner or later, the biologists will begin
trying to remake us. In 20,000 years of
selective breeding we have not been able
to eliminate the baboon in our nature.
Why not try?

Meanwhile, I wish they’d take some
smaller steps and just give us quiet dogs
and monogamous cats.

quality to become high divers:

“We tried out about 300 mules,
and only found 11 that liked the
water well enough,” Rivers said.
”Most mules won’t do it at all.”

Rivers and his high-diving mules
, will make their debut in St. Louis
on Thursday at the annual Shrine
Circus.

People have a lot of misconcep‘
tions about the act, especially the
belief that the mules are pushed

from a 30-foot-tall platform, he

said.

“No, no,” Rivers said. “There’s a
long ramp that goes up to a ﬂat
platform with sides on it. I turn ’em
loose, and they go up by them-

i“, selves,-and jump by themselves. _

“If you were pushing them, forc-

an act. I defy anyone to drag those
suckers up that ramp.

“It’s all natural, once you find
one that likes the water.”

Rivers, 37, grew up in Camden-

' ton, M0,, and lives in McIntosh, Fla.
.He said another common notion

was that a trapdoor was sprung,
dumping the animals into a 15,000-
gallon water tank below.

“That’s because if you look at a
picture of the act, you see a board
that angles down toward the water.
That board is bolted in place. They
have to have that to make a dive.

“They kind of slide their front
feet off at the edge, then push away

Rivers said he had never had an
animal injured in the act. “The

worst thing I ever have is them.

fighting each other in the pen.”

Rivers said his father, Johnny
Rivers, had got the idea for the act
after watching a similar stunt years
ago in which horses dived off a pier
at Atlantic City, NJ.

He said his father had decided to
try the act with mules because no-
body believed he could make one
dive.

Rivers said half the job was find-

ing a mule that enjoyed water.
. “Then we take them to the deep
end of a pool we have at our home
and let them jump in,” he said.
“Gradually, we build up the height.
Animals are not scared of heights.
If an animal gets scared, that’s
where it goes -— to a high place.

“But it’s a slow process, that’s
probably why we’re the only ones
doing it. If we hadn’t found mules

that like it, we probably wouldn’t

be doing it either.” .

The stars of the act are three
small mules, the result of matings
between a donkey and a pony. The
animals — Little Red, Smoky and
Dipsy -- weigh about 400 pounds
and stand 40 inches tall. A Shetland

pony also dives with a monkey on _

its back.

Suzanne Gassner, director of
education for the Humane Society
of Missouri, said the‘society had got
many irate calls about the act since
it was announced as part of the
circus.

“They’re not breaking the law by

Humane Society feel it‘s in very
poor taste,” Gassner said.

Although a slight drizzle delayed
the Shriners parade-Tuesday night

and cut the crowd, those who
showed up didn’t seem to mind.

The Shriners still marched, plasticm:

protecting their fezes, and only the
Clydesdales remained inside their

NEW YORK — Be careful, or
you might trip over one of Ken-

. newest, and smallest, employees.

Barely knee high and smartly
turned out in kelly-green jack-

Plant Protection Quarantine
(PPQ) division of the USDA’s
Animal and Plant Health Inspec-
tion Services, are statiOned at
five major US. airports: San

York, Miami and Seattle.

Chosen because of their ex-
traordinary sense of smell and
gentle natures, these beagles are
trained to sniff out agricultural
contraband, mostly citrus fruits
and meats, in the baggage o‘f pas-
sengers on international flights.
' The program has met with an
enthusiastic response.

1 PPQ canine officer Hal Finger-

Everywhere that Kennedy
Airport beagles Sam and Jackpot
went, squeals of delight from
children followed.

Daniel Feith, 3, arriving on a
TWA flight from Israel, was
thrilled to discover Sam inspect-
ing his parents’ luggage. Dan-
iel’s father, who didn’t look
quite so thrilled, was neverthe-
less amused.

At another baggage carousel,
three French boys in matching
plaid pants crowd around the
young dog. -

One boy pets Sam enthusiasti-
c 1y, and his brothers quickly
fo low suit. The beagle patiently
endures this shower of affec-
tion, keeping an eye on his

ties call. ‘

But why all the fuss about a

Flights are arriving this after-

noon from Vienna, Frankfurt;

works the luggage areas, garner-

ing mixed reactions from the

passengers clustered by the bag-

At the baggage carousel for a-
flight from Paris, a well-dressed
woman is awaiting her luggage.
She looks a bit startled when
Sam sniffsc at the plastic bag by
her feet, but this changes to
curiosity as the program is ex-
plained. Sam checks out her car-

; pectantly up at McMillen for hlS
reward.

f McMillen asks to. see the wom-
an’s declaration card and marks
an"‘A” (for agriculture) at the
top. Later, when she goes
through customs, a USDA officer
will inspect her bags. (There are

various Kennedy terminals, and
another 12 in cargo, all of whom

-work separately from US. cus-

i “If they declare it, nothiilig,” .
i says Ms. Dabulis. The contra- f
band is simply confiscated. Pas-

“After you’ve found one
(item),”she explains, "you ask if 1
they have any more. If they say .
, no, and more is found, they are :
fined. (They’re) given plenty of .

warning.” Fines are $25 for un—
concealed contraband, $50 if the

. passenger has attempted to hide
it.

Confiscated goods are stored
temporarily in bins under the
customs counters. These are
emptied periodically and’ the
contents end up in the PPQ of-
fice, tucked away behind the
busy terminal. There, in a back
room, an enormous stainless
steel table with a garbage dispos-
al in the center is piled with gua-
va, tomatoes, giant yams, span-
ish yogurt, honeydew melons,
lemons, limes, grapes and card-
board containers of milk.

The quarantine. says Ms. Da-

 

bulis, isolates insects or viruses
brought in via the fruits and
meat.

“The stuff is seized,” adds Fin~ ’

german, “our officers bring it in
here, look through it for bugs
and diseases, then (it goes
through) a giant garbage dispos-
al to the ocean —— the organisms
can’t live in salt.”

PPQ officers then “write up
compilations of figures and stats
so they know what kind of stuff
is coming from what country,”
he explains.

He says that his department is
hoping the Beagle Brigade will
help get the messageacross to

Dogged trainer

MARIE KENNEALLY, dog trainer
and owner of Bay State Services, claims
that the reason she doesn’t take dogs
away and return them all obedienced-up
is that people might suspect she’d
switched their dogs for well-behaved
look-alikes. But it’s amazing to watch
her in the dogs’ own homes as, for
example, she gets four excited; barking
Yorkies to sit quietly and stay until
released, as if hypnotized by her power.
A delighted dog lover, she sails in to
meet her four-legged clients and then
goes into her teaching mode, which
involves crisp, decisive hand gestures
and a voice pitched a bit higher than her
normal speaking voice. By coding to
certain words the commands to sit, stay,
and come, Kenneally makes it less likely
that a dog-napper could exert inﬂuence.
In a short session she can get hyper
dogs to cool it, even at the moment of a
thrilling homecoming. A two-hour home
visit starts at $68.

Wayne says the mountains,
nearly surrounded ' by urban
sprawl, sustain a surprisingly wide
range of species —- from common
coyotes to gray foxes, badgers and
bobcats.

“Small-predator diversity here
is comparable to anywhere I trap-

_ ped in Africa,” said Wayne, who
had previously studied jackals on,

Africa’s plains.

The wildlife corridor in the
Santa Susana Mountains and Simi
Hills are being choked in three
places where commercial hillside
development is squeezing in, ac-
cording to the Cal State Northridge

The three choke pointsinclude:

I The western edge of Angeles

cies of wildlife in the urban parks,‘

Thomas said.

A task force of about 30 plan-
ning officials, conservationists and

' scientists will use the study as a

starting point to devise a strategy
for saving the corridor, Thomas
said. The task force is headed by the

increased alligator harvest
awaits QOVemor’s signature

TAMPA TRIBUNE - June 9, 1987

 

‘-- ' 1::- WAttﬁ—u nu- .. _

By LARRY SCHUSTER “
Tribune Staff Writer

DUNNELLON - The number of
alligators removed from Florida’s
wetlands will increase by more than
five times by the end of the decade
under plans proposed by the staff of
the Florida Game 8; Fresh Water
Fish Commission.’

A greatly increased harvest was
mandated by a bill passed late last

week by the Legislature. It still-

awaits the governor’s signature, said
Frank Montalbano, director of the
Division of Wildlife, who said the
bill had broad support among alliga-
tor farmers, state agencies and in-
dependent environmental groups.

If it becomes law and the staff’s
proposed regulations are adopted
by the five-member commission in
July, farmers beginning this fall will
be able to remove 7,000 hatchlings.

{A

Hunters will not be able to remove
any adult alligators until the follow-
ing year.

Licensed hunters will be able to
take 4,000 adult alligators in the
1988-89 fiscal year. Also, alligator
farmers will be able to take 9,000

. hatchlings and 1,750 eggs that year

to raise on their farms, Montalbano
said. .
During the final year of the

three-year program, the number of '*

hatchlings harvested would increase
to about 11,000, eggs to 6,000, and
adult alligators to 6,000.

The program is the first in re-
cent years that will allow alligators
to be removed under a non-experi-
mental harvest.

. _The harvest of alligators for ex?
perimental harvest and nuisance

programs will continue at about the
same level during the three years.
This. fiscal year, hunters will take

9
I.» . w'ﬁk’ﬁ‘m .

about 4,200 alligators, and the ex:
perimental harvest will take 1,200;
The remainder will be nuisance anie
mals taken from residential areas
or other places where they are con-
sidered a danger.

In all programs, the exact num-
ber of animals taken will be based
on the ability of a specific site to

' support a harvest, determined after

continued testing, he said. ' .

“This is a harvesting, not a pro:
gram built around sports hunting,"
Montalbano said. It is designed spe-
cificaily for commercial exploita-
tion of the reptile following several
years of experimental mints that
showed the animal’s population can
withstand some controlled harvest-
ing. . .
Also, in all cases, the farmers

and hunters would be licensed and
. the fees would support an expanded

alligator management program,

SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE - June 5, 1987

Park District Told to Help,
‘ Oakland Zooor Face Fund Cur

By Clarence Johnson

Two state legislators want
to withhold $2.6 million in state
revenues from the East Bay Re-
gional Park District unless it

agrees to assist the floundering

Oakland Zoo.

“We’re not saying they have to'

run the zoo,” said AssemblymanEli~

.hu Harris, D-Oakland. “We’re just

asking them to participate in its sur-

vival. They can’t simply wash their

hands and say it’s not their problem.
I am making it their problem."

. With Oakland considering bud- '

get cuts that may result in police,
fire and personnel layoffs, the 200
could be forced to remove many of
its animals or go bankrupt next
summer, according to its director,
Joel Parrott.

Harris and state Senator Nick

,Petris, DOakland, on Wednesday
asked the Legislature’s joint budget
conference committee to withhold
the $2.6 million in 1987-88, grant
money unless the district assumes
at least some of the 200’s burden.

The district funds had been

earmarked for “special projects,"

including new trails and camp-
grounds.

The proposal drew an objection
from David Pesonen, general man-

ager of the East Bay Regional Park.

District.

“Our position is that the park
district has no role in salvaging a
short-term financial crisis that we
didn’t create,” said Pesonen.

“About 43 percent of our-opera-
tion budget is used to manage parks,
that serve Oakland. Only 18 percent
of the park district population re
sides in Oakland. So they are getting
- more than their share now,” he said.

The 50year-old 200, home for
320 animals, sits on 10 acres in

Knowland Park, high in the Oak- ,

'ﬂ land Hills.

The city owns and operates the
200, but since Proposition 13 slashed
tax revenues in 1978, city support
for the 200 has dipped to less than
oneohalf the amount needed to keep ,
it running.

The rest of. the Operating funds
comes from private donations,
which are also becoming harder to

find, said 200 director Parrott.

Of the 200’s $1.5 million annual
budget, the city contributes only
$430,000. Parrott noted that an addi-
tional $1.8 million is desperately
needed to build new lion and ele-
phant quarters.

The 200 director said that in-
volving the East Bay park district

.makes sense because nearly two--

thirds of 200 visitors do not live in
Oakland.

Pesonen said that the district
would be willing to help the zoo “as
long as it doesn’t cause the diver-
sion of any of our resources.”

.q

- 44-.

He added, “The financial crush
that is hitting the city now is also
hitting us. We don’t appreciate the
city trying to unload its problems on
the district.” '

However, Assemblyman Harris
said that the park district is “a crea-
ture of the state" and should deal
with regional problems. “If they
can’t assume regional responsibili-
ty, we don’t need them," he said.

If the legislators’ recommenda-
tion is approved, it will be incorpo
rated into the state budget, which
will be voted on by the Legislature .
later this month. . ' , -

Detroit Zoo renovations
win approval 0f visitors

June 7, 1987

 

By KAREN SCHNEIDER
Free Press Staff Writer

Children weren’t the only ones voicing
delight Saturday at the Detroit Zoo —-
adults also marveled at the renovations to
the city’s venerable attraction.

“I am so totally impressed,” said Cheri
Ruley of East Detroit, who was at the zoo
with her husband, Mark, and daughters,
, Karyn and Kim. After having visited St.
Louis’ zoo, she said, “I was ashamed to
come back to this one.

“I’m very surprised now — I’m
shocked.”

The $11.6 million in renovations were
dedicated Friday by Mayor Young. They
include new brick and copper-colored
ticket booths and a lushly landscaped
entrance decorated with high-flying ban-
ners with pictures of animals.

Other renovations include a GOO-vehi-
cle, three-level parking deck, a new re-
freshment stand and Zootique gift shop, a
new zoo train station, a fountain and a 12-

1001- -high noise buffer along W. Ten Mile
Road.

The improvements were paid for with
federal and state money in return for City
of Detroit-owned land in Royal Oak that
was lost to the construction of the adja-
cent 1-696.

Zoo Director Steve Graham said-that
he first had argued to have the 200’s

’ landmark water tower dismantled as part

of the renovation, against the wishes of
Young and others. But he said he’s glad he
didn’t prevail.

“I didn’t have enough vision,” he said.
“If we had done that, it would’ve been the
worst decision I made. . . . The tower has
become a beacon.”

Zoo attendance is up 20 percent over
the last two years, and summer atten-
dance averages 7,000 daily, he said.

The renovations make the zoo “look
more attractive — it catches your eye
more,” said Sharyl Restrick of Lapeer. “I
was here two years ago and I couldn’t
believe the difference.”

Zoo Atlanta is beginning the summer with
the unveiling of several improvements and
new exhibits that will completely change the
face of the 98-year-old facility.

The first phase of this $25 million rede-
velopment project will be complete by mid-
summer and includes a new entryway, visitor
services and utilities, a restaurant, a new Zoo
commissary and Flamingo Plaza, an exhibit

Travelers with additional support from Contel
Credit, Flamingo Plaza is the first of 10 natu-
' ral habitat exhibits planned for the Zoo.
Prominently featured as part of the new en-
tryway, some 40 Chilean flamingos will occu-
py lushly landscaped pools and sandbars.

Other exhibits opening this summer in-
clude aviaries for hornbills, several species of
’ East African birds and lories, small, colorful
parrots. The gibbons will move from the pri-
‘mate building to a new naturalized habitat,
and many new animals will be added to the
Children’s Zoo, including white storks, Asian
' squirrels and Vietnamese pot-bellied pigs.

“We’re not just adding new animals, how- -

ever,” said Zoo Director Dr. Terry Maple.

TRAVELING TALONS: Part of bird
demonstration at Zoo Atlanta.

“We’re working to give our visitors an excit-
ing and memorable experience while educat-
ing them about wildlife and conservation is-
sues.” ‘

Zoo Atlanta’s three baby African ele-
phants figure largely in those plans. Last De-

cember, after an immensely successful funn-
raising campaign, theZoo purchased two
young female elephants which have joined
Starlet O’Hara and now perform with her
three times daily.

“Traveling Talons,” the dramatic bird of
prey demonstration that fascinated Zoo pa-
trons last summer, returns through Labor
Day with its three daily programs of free-fly-
ing owls, Peregrine falcons, hawks and ea.-
gles.

Zoo Atlanta is placing new and greater
emphasis on education this summer with fi-
nancial and volunteer support from several

' groups. The Zoo’s new Safari Carts feature in-

terpretive exhibits covering t0pics such as en-
dangered species and animal diets. Volunteers
are also staffing an' innovative contact area
in the Children’s Zoo where visitors can get
“up close and personal” with llamas, sheep
and the new pot-bellied pigs. .

Over the next four to six years, virtually
all of the physical facilities at the Zoo will be
replaced, while those buildings that remain
will be used in entirely new ways. Atlanta’s
new Zoo will feature completely naturalized
habitats that simulate various regions of the
world.

The centerpiece of the new Zoo will be
the Ford African Rain Forest which will
house Willie 8., Zoo Atlanta’s beloved western

reet visitors to 200 Atanta *

lowland gorilla, three family groupings of
lowland gorillas on loan from the Yerkes Pri-
mate Research Center of Emory University,
as well as mandrill baboons, arboreal mon~
keys and a variety of birds. -
Being built on the rolling bills at the
heart of the Zoo, construction on the four~ “
acre exhibit is, scheduled to begin this sum-
mer.
' “In spite of the fact that a portiOn of the

'200 will be heavily impacted by. the construc-

tion of the Rain Forest exhibit,” said Dr. Ma-
ple, “we believe our visitors will be excited
this summer about the new exhibits and pro-
grams we’re offering. We’re really committed
to making sure that Atlantans have a great
time when they visit Zoo Atlanta this year.”

Zoo Atlanta is located at 800 Cherokee
Avenue in historic Grant Park. By car, take-
1-20 east from downtown to exit 26 — Boule-
vard. "The Zoo is one-half mile south on the
right.

During the summer months (now through
Labor Day) the Zoo extends its weekend
hours and is Open from 10 am. to 6 pm. Dur-
ing the week, the Zoo is Open from 10 am. to
5 pm. with the ticket office closing at 4 pm. ,

Adults are charged $4.25 for admission .

1 Zoo christens elephants

‘Victoria’ and

By Susan Laccetti
Staff Writer

 

 

Zoo Atlanta’s two newest ele-
phants were «christened “Victoria”
and “Zambezi” Saturday as a Cobb
County third-grade class was hon-
ored for naming the 5-year-old
elephants.

“We got a . map of Africa out
and looked at that,” said Terri Bla-
lock, a ' third-grade teacher at Mur-
dock Elementary, whose class won
the grand prize in an elephant-nam-
ing contest. “We thought it would be
nice to name them from there.”

Since both African elephants are
from Zimbabwe, the name “Vic-
toria” represents Victoria Falls in
that country and “Zambezi” the

’ . Zambezi River.

As the grand prize winner, the.
class also received a check for
$1,000. The students donated the
money to Zoo Atlanta.

Bud Ervin, 9, said the class do~
nated the money to feed the ele-
phants “so that they’ll live longer,
pe0ple can see them.”

‘Zambezi’

To thank the pupils, Victoria

and Zambezi, with veteran resident .

Starlet O’Hara, took “bows, spouted
water from their trunks and waved
goodbye. '

The elephant-naming contest ber

gan in Agril, and more than 5,000
E ople su mitted entries, said John

. Williams, marketing director for
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution,
sponsor of the contest. The ele-

phants were purchased last fall af- .
ter a public campaign raised more ‘

than $30,000. Food Giant, The At-

lanta Coca-Cola Bottling Co. and,

Zoo Atlanta .also sponsored the
contest.

A committee of representatives
of the four sponsors reviewed the
entries and selected the grand prize
winner. The first-place winner,
Shepard Darden of Atlanta, won a
$500 sho ping spree. Second-prize
winner mma Jean Martin of At-
lanta won a birthday party with the
zoo elephants. The 50 third-prize
winners receiVed one-year free
membership in Friends of Zoo
Atlanta.

Considerable microsurgery

“The transplant procedure is

noted.

The transplant team did not re-

implanted the donor kidney at the
rear of her abdomen and connected
it to the blood vessels that supply
the rear legs. Then the kidney was
hooked up to her bladder, Dr. Greg-

Queenie’s surgery cost $400 to
$500, but hospital care and other
treatment will bring her total bill to
about $1,000, he added.

A cat kidney transplant “is not
a practical, every-day event by any
means,” the surgeon said.

“It’s not for everybody and it‘s
not for every animal. It’s quite a
commitment, both on the part of
the veterinarian and the pet own-

But it can be done if a cat is still

Erik Erikson
and the “ethics of surviv ”

\

At 82, the great psychoanalyst is still dedicated
to the study and preservation of human life.

by Margaret Brenman-Gibson

any years have passed since Erik Erik~
son and I ﬁrst discussed the concept of
evil. It was on that day that I began to
understand the heart of his matter. I was

" ~ then his junior colleague on the staff of
the Austen Riggs Center in Stockbridge, Massachusetts.
He was at work on the section on Gandhi’s childhood for
his book Gandhi’s Truth. I suggested that Gandhi’s
steady teasing of his mother enabled him to address a
universal task—that of creatively ﬁnding a playful way
to integrate, with his love for her, his profound resent-
ment. “In its murderous impulse he probably saw this
resentment, whether consciously or not, as evil,” I said.

Erikson turned his great blue eyes on me. “You are
the only other psychoanalyst I know who uses the word
evil. Is it a word you feel at home with?” I replied,
“There are times, even in clinical discussion, let alone
in history, when no other word will do.” Erikson then
spoke gravely of his own struggle to clarify for himself
the implications of Gandhi’s social invention of nonvio-
lence as a strategy for tackling human evil.

Erikson said he thought that Gandhi’s proposal for the
next step in our ethical evolution, a step that might break
the chain of human violence, goes beyond the recom-
mendation for a simple readiness to suffer hurt and a
refusal to do physical harm to the counterplayer—be it
child, parent, mate, patient, boss, or superpower. During
the great textile strike he led in Ahmedabad, Gandhi had
said to the millworkers, “You must not destroy the prop-
erty or the self-esteem of the opponent.” “There is here,”
according to Erikson, “a determination not to violate

/

another person’s essence—and the context will determine

just what that essence is—because such violence can only '

evoke counterviolence.”

This simple, distilled declaration—offered with Erik-
son’s characteristic difﬁdence——spun my head around as
I considered its implications for the tough-minded theo-
retical ediﬁce he had already begun in 1950 in Childhood
and Society. In his quantum leap beyond Freud, Erikson
was the ﬁrst to outline the stages of the entire life span
and the developmental crises that mark them (others had
tried to track life span as far as adolescence). He was
also the ﬁrst in his ﬁeld to explore the ways in which
individual lives intersect with each other to create ethical
development and history. In his exploration of ethics in
various cultural contexts, over a number of generations,
he was bringing into focus the belief that humans—
though they have a great capacity for vengeful destruc—
tion—seek also the “maintenance of the world.” His
concern with oppression, whether of children, colonials,
or patients, was a corollary to this focus.

In the model of nonviolence, Erikson saw the potential
for the resistance of evil by way of a heightened mutuality
which, at best, informs the human life cycle from begin-
ning to end: parent and child attuned or not to each other’s
“essence,” each expanding or diminishing the other;
players and counterplayers in the later stages of life joined
by more complex bonds and struggles. Erikson was com-
ing to believe that the complementary processes of the
body, the mind, and the society grow simultaneously. In
his latest book, The Life Cycle Completed, he names
these three soma, psyche, and ethos. Earlier, in Gandhi ’s
Truth, he had written,

Nonviolence, inward and outward, can become a true force only

where ethics replaces moralism. And ethics, to me, is marked by
an insightful assent to human values whereas moralism is blind

obedience, and ethics is transmitted with informed persuasion, rath-
er than enforced with absolute interdicts.

Not long after our discussion of evil and the chain of
human violence, Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinat-
ed. When Gandhi’s Truth was published in 1969, its
dedication read: “This was to be Joan’s book. We are
now dedicating it together to the memory of Martin
Luther King.”

n a recent conversation, Erikson returned to the ques-
tion of evil. I asked him whether he was aware of the
magnitude of the evil building in Europe when he
decided, in 1933, to leave Freud’s circle in Vienna and
come to America with his wife, Joan, and their two very
young sons, Kai and Jon. Did he feel like a refugee?
“Curiously, no,” was his answer. The exodus of Jewish
intellectuals had begun (Erikson’s mother was a Danish
Jew; he never knew his father), but as Erikson remem-
bers,“Our experience was more that of immigrants than
of refugees, but at this time the word ‘refugee’ was not
yet used much.”
Just before he left Vienna, Erikson had been at work
on an essay about good and evil in which, for the ﬁrst
time, he deliberately joined the individual life history to

Massachusetts, shortly after their arrival in the United
States in the early Thirties.

the historical moment in society. His subject was Adolf
Hitler—child-victim turned victimizer—whose public
speeches would soon include this sentence: “I would
prefer not to see anyone suffer nor to do harm to anyone.
But then I realized that the species is in danger . . . and
sentiment gives way to the coldest reason.”

The essay appeared almost a decade later in Erikson’s
elegant English prose as “Hitler’s Imagery and German
Youth.” He describes it as a “contribution to the question
of what the common symbols are that make all Germans
one people and one danger: the ﬁery leader as well as the
obedient follower.”

Clearly, on some level, Erikson knew that his small
family was not simply emigrating. To this day he recalls
how grateful he felt when a clerk in the Boston immigra-
tion ofﬁce greeted him: “Welcome.”

“Soon my welcome to America was underscored by
Edwin Boring, who was then chairman of the psychology
department at Harvard. When he heard I had attended
one of those classical German high schools (in Karls-
ruhe), a Gymnasium, known for its high standards, not
so much in science or technology but in Greek and Latin,
literature, histOry, and art—Professor Boring awarded me
an ‘honorary B.A.,’ ” Erikson says with amusement.
“Otherwise I would have had no degree at all. I was not
a good student of formal courses in high school and I
made only one further attempt [at Harvard] which went
nowhere.” At the urging of Professor Henry A. Murray,
who quickly perceived the gifts of this 31-year—old
immigrant, Erikson enrolled, without signal success, in
Harvard’s graduate psychology program. (Since then, he

and Gandhian revolutions.

 

has refused any number of offers for honorary degrees
and accepted only a few.)

Despite his unheard—of lack of credentials, Erikson was
soon a self-made American, with teaching positions at
Harvard Medical School, the Judge Baker Guidance Cen-
ter, and Massachusetts General Hospital. His revolution-
ary inquiry into the nature of play—to illuminate all
human development—now began at the Harvard Psycho-
logical Clinic, headed by Murray. Erikson was not, of
course, aware of his destiny to become, in America, a
prime spokesman within the intellectual community for
what he would later call an “all-human identity.” But it
is no accident that his thoughts ﬂowered in a unique
democracy that maintains, in its unity, a variety drawn
from all nations and religions. This country, born in
resistance to tyranny and called in its beginnings the
“New Jerusalem,” was indeed the proper soil for a think-
er who would begin to integrate the Freudian and Gan-
dhian revolutions. .

We, looking back at that unsettled young man, can
comprehend by the use of his insights how he was, at that
moment, “the only available person who can handle the
question,” as Gandhi had put it.

JON ERIKSON

Erikson addressing the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association in Los Angeles last spring.

school “the goy” by Jewish boys, and “the Jew” by his
gentile classmates. (He was the adopted son of the Jewish
pediatrician his mother had married.) In his adolescence,
Erikson tells us, he was “on the border between neurosis
and psychosis.” Marginal status in a community pro-
vides, as he himself later discovered, one of the critical
factors in innovation. Innovation, according to his theory,
arises from the unique intersection of the life cycle of a
gifted and conﬂicted person with a segment of history.

Like Freud, who made his monumental discoveries in
the context of a threefold crisis—personal, conceptual,
and practical—Erikson had to “wrestle with the angel”
of his own difﬁculties until he too would receive a curative
“blessing” of comprehension in the form of his original
and radically interdisciplinary body of work.

Erikson’s contextual way of looking at things was a
critical departure from Freud’s thinking about human
development in its relation to groups. Freud had assumed
a “ready-made” person who is “inserted,” as it were,
into a “ready-made” group. He watched, then, to see how
the group behaved or, for that matter, how the individual
behaved, once inserted into the group. Erikson insisted
that human evolution is simultaneously physical, psycho-
logical, and communal at each successive stage of life,
with its aggravated “crisis.” Moreover, his unprecedent—
ed emphasis on ethical concerns, particularly involving
the next generation, brought a new perspective to modern
psychology: a perspective that helps us in this critical
moment of human history to envision and to act upon an
“ethics of survival,” as I have come to think of it.

rikson opened an ofﬁce on Marlborough Street in

Boston, where he communicated with frightened,

suffering children by playing games with them.
This was an extension of Freud’s revolutionary idea that
from an early age we seek, by playing, to make sense of
and thus to master experience. In one of his rare reports
of a direct observation of a child, Freud described his
own young son’s creative efforts to bring his mother back
from the grocery store by inventing a game in which he,
over and over, threw a spool and retrieved it. Freud rea-
SOned that “beyond the pleasure principle,” the repetition

compulsion in this game was a way to control the fright~
ening and angering experience of being abandoned.
Erikson was the ﬁrst psychologist after Freud to take this
idea with the seriousness it deserves. He began at once
to use it to address his patients’ misery, and at the same
time to study what was going on.

Of course, great teachers have long realized that even
the most walled-off children can be reached and taught
through playing games. No one, however, had yet
explored the mystery of how humans, small and large,
try to master experience in such games. It was here that
Erikson made his quantum leap. He was beginning to ask
questions that Freud had not asked. As children and
adults “play,” are they simply repeating what has hap-
pened in an effort to assimilate powerful feelings, or are
they trying to anticipate the future and create new solu—
tions to the conﬂict that underlies their suffering? Indeed,
is not such “play” enacted in the drama of the family,
on the stage, and in “theaters” of war?

Erikson was already leaving behind what one might
call “a psychology of defect,” and—without denying the
dark side of the human heart—seeking to comprehend
creative human strengths in action as they play against
weakness and vengefulness. His bold View extends to the
“sinister horizon” of our world: “We cannot afford to
live for long,” he says, “with a division of personal,
professional, and political ethics.” He points out that
previously the Golden Rule has comfortably existed with
warfare, but concludes that “as boundless slaughter
replaces tactical warfare, this tenuous coexistence of eth-
ics and warfare may outlive itself in our time.”

To be sure, religious world views have always taken
the polarity of good and evil for granted. In Bali, to take
one example, the meaning of the ubiquitous black-and-
white checkerboard design that adorns every God-Ele-
phant’s apron, every building, every bridge, is under-
stood by any citizen as “the battle between good and
evil.” Strange language for most behavioral scientists, as
Erikson was discovering, but a fundament of all cultures.

plumbers. His reputation grew fast. As he addressed their
pain, he tried to comprehend the conﬁgurations of their
lives in the context of their worlds. The question “How
does this fractured life hang together?” became for Erik-
son a central clinical inquiry. It is primarily a visual
conﬁguration of a life cycle in a society. Erikson had
begun as a painter; one of his important themes had been
mother and child.

nights, with free-wheeling anthropologists like Margaret
Mead, Gregory Bateson, Ruth Benedict, and Scudder
Mekeel, who would soon facilitate the “deepest penetra-
tion of psychoanalysis into America” by arranging ﬁeld
trips for him to the Sioux and Yurok Indians. Joining in
these discussions also was newly immi grated Kurt Lewin,
who, in an early version of systems theory, was trying to
integrate psychology and sociology.

In 1936 Erikson left Harvard to take a research position
at Yale’s Institute of Human Relations. Two years later
the Eriksons’ daughter, Sue, was born—Grace-New
Haven Hospital’s ﬁrst rooming—in baby. In 1939, living
out the American migration, the family moved to Cali-
fornia, where they would remain for more than a decade.
Erikson and his wife, Joan, who was a partner in his
thinking from the start, continued their clinical work with
children and adults in San Francisco. At the Institute of
Child Welfare in Berkeley, they began a unique study
with pubescent “normal” children, designed to last for
a generation. By now Erikson was professor of psychol—
ogy and lecturer in psychiatry at Berkeley. But the Erik—
sons’ life in Orinda, complete with orange groves planted
by Joan, was brought to a halt by the bitter fruit of the
Cold War.

In May 1949, the Board of Regents of the University
of California added a special oath of loyalty to the regular
constitutional oath of ofﬁce taken by every teacher. Erik-
son was one of some ninety members of the university’s
academic senate who refused to sign the new contract.
A year later, with Childhood in Society in press, he
resigned his professorship. In his statement to the Board
of Regents, he made clear that he was not then and had
never been a communist: he made equally clear that he
could not sign the new contract. “One may say, then,”
he writes, “why not acquiesce in an empty gesture, if it
saves the faces of very important personages, helps to
allay public hysteria, and hurts nobody? My answer is
that of a psychologist. I do believe that this gesture which
now saves face for some important people, will, in the
long run hurt people who are much more important: the
students.

“For many students, their years of study represent
their only contact with thought and theory, their only
contact with men who teach them how to see two sides
of a question and yet to be decisive in their conclusions,
how to understand and yet to act with conviction. Young
people are rightfully suspicious and embarrassingly dis-
cerning. I do not believe they can remain unimpressed

by the fact that the men who are to teach them to think
and to act judiciously and spontaneously must undergo
a political test; must sign a statement which implicitly
questions the validity of their own oath of ofﬁce. . . . A
dangerous rift may well occur between ‘ofﬁcial truth’ and
those deep and often radical doubts which are the nec-
essary condition for the development of thought.

“My ﬁeld includes the study of the tremendous waste
in human energy which proceeds from irrational fear and
from the irrational gestures which we call ‘history.’ I
would ﬁnd it difﬁcult to ask my subject of investigation
(people) and my students to work with me, if I were to
participate without protest in a vague, fearful, and some-
what vindictive gesture devised to ban an evil in some
magic way—an evil which must be met with much more
searching and concerted effort.

permit me to sign the contract after having sworn that I
would do my job to the best of my ability.”

had been a consultant at the Menninger Clinic in

Topeka, Kansas, and in 1951 he joined the staff of
the Austen Riggs Center in Stockbridge, following a
small band of top staff that had gone there from Topeka
three years earlier. It was the only good, some of us
thought, to issue from the House Committee on Un-
American Activities. It brought the noncoercible Erik-
sons to our hospital where they remained for ten years—
“about as long as we stay put in one place.”

In the Sixties, McGeorge Bundy lured Erikson back
to Harvard to become professor of human development
and a full—time scholar. According to a former student,
Kenneth Keniston (now professor of psychology at
MIT), there was “only a little rejoicing in Cambridge”
in advance of Erikson’s return, as many there believed
that psychoanalysis had no place at Harvard. After Erik-
son’s arrival, however, hundreds of students competed
for a chance to be in his large and popular course, “The
Human Life Cycle,” and the rejoicing in Cambridge
grew. For ten years Erikson taught Harvard seniors how
the body, the mind, and the society evolved together: as
one undergraduate, in awe of the comprehensiveness of
the course, dubbed it, “From bust to dust.”

The liberation movements of the Sixties were in full
swing, and resistance to the Vietnam war was mounting:
a time for discoveries like the “identity crisis” or the
“ethical implications of psychoanalytic insight” to ﬁnd
a place in history. And so they did, as witness the fol-
lowing chain of intersecting lives, spiraling into Gandhi-
an action of ever greater impact.

One of those lucky enough to make it into Erikson’s
course was Randall Kehler ’66. A founder, and now
national coordinator, of the Nuclear Weapons Freeze
Campaign, Kehler said—after meeting Erikson again, a
quarter of a century later—“I learned more from Profes-
sor Erikson at Harvard than from almost anyone, from
his very being, his integrity as much as anything. It was
that which helped provide me with the courage to do
what I had to do.” What he had to do, only months after
completing Erikson’s course, was to resist the Vietnam
war; and for refusing to participate in it, Kehler went
from Harvard to prison, where he served two years. The
speech he made en route at the War Resisters’ League
was heard by Daniel Ellsberg ’52, a former member of

the University’s Society of Fellows and then a Defense
and State Department ofﬁcial, working on strategic
nuclear war plans and Vietnam policy.

Ellsberg identiﬁed with Erikson’s student, whose
speech became the turning point in his own decision to
risk imprisonment by releasing the Defense Department’s
multivolume study United States-Vietnam Relations,
1945-1967, subsequently known as the “Pentagon Papers.”
According to Ellsberg, “Randy Kehler’s speech on his
way to prison confronted me with the question, ‘What
could I do to help end the Vietnam war if I were willing
to go to jail?’ ” He left the auditorium, went to the
washroom, sat down on the ﬂoor, and wept. “It became
clear to me,” he later said, “that my country had come
to the point where the best thing one could do was to go
’0 jail. The thought that kept coming back to me was,
‘We are eating our young.’ ”

Within a week, Ellsberg had answered his own ques-
tion as to what he could do. His publication of the study
of US. decision making in Vietnam—an indigenously
American “truth telling” piece of civil disobedience,
Which, it turns out, broke no law—was a critical item in
bringing the Vietnam war and, ultimately, Nixon’s pres-
idCHCy to an end.

In 1982 Ellsberg, who now serves with Kehler on the
Strategy Committee of the National Freeze Campaign,

was imprisoned for his nonviolent resistance to what both
men see as the evil of the present level of risk taking in
preparation for nuclear war. He found himself in the same
“Graystone holding-cell” in the Santa Rita jail in Cali-
fornia that Kehler had earlier occupied. In this cell, Ells-
berg conducted a seminar for fellow resisters on militant
nonviolence. He reviewed the history of civil disobedience
in America, and the nonviolent resistance to the Mexican
War by Henry David Thoreau, who had said, “Cast your
whole vote, not a strip of paper merely, but your whole
inﬂuence.” Thoreau had made a great impression on Gan-
dhi, who read him in a South African prison where he
had been put for resisting the violation of the civil rights
of South African Indians. (“1 invented jail-going,” Gan-
dhi had said, referring to mass civil disobedience.)
Now we have come full circle. In this chain of caus-
ation (Erikson calls it “the gigantic metabolism of inter-
secting life cycles”) that' makes up the good and evil in
society, Erikson has inﬂuenced lives in ways that have
signiﬁcantly changed our attitudes and our history; his
presence at Harvard has been a counterweight to the
Harvard inﬂuence that underlay much of the Vietnam
strategy, as it now does nuclear-weapons planning. This
effort at maintaining a balance continues. Last year Dan-
iel Ellsberg’s Harvard faculty seminars, and his course

introduced interdisciplinary perspective on human devel-
0pment in history. for an ethics of survival'signiﬁcantly
different from that expressed in the defeatist volume Liv-
ing With Nuclear Weapons.

Erikson, after careful thought, accepted an invitation

from the students at the University of Capetown to
give the T.B. Davie lecture there, near where the young
Gandhi had ﬁrst used militant nonviolence to campaign
for civil rights for the Indian population of South Africa.
The date was August 6, 1968; the Vietnam war was
raging.

Erikson spoke to a huge assembly that had gathered to
“link arms” with those speakers who had preceded him
and had marked an “irreducible line of academic free-
dom.” He was ﬁlled with both grief and hope:

“My country must be marked in your minds, as it is
in mine, by the fact that so recently a vital young states-
man who was your guest two years ago was shot to
death—as was his brother, who had already taken his
place in history—and also Martin Luther King, unfor-
gettable for his understanding of militant nonviolence. I
come from a country, then, which in all its wealth and
power, freedom and talent, is at the mercy of armed
psychopathy and riotous revenge. (And today is the day
of Hiroshima.) But my country is also—in spite of all
the politics-as-usual of a campaign year—vigorously
reassessing the ethical basis of its national policies abroad
and at home, and this, if for no other reason, because our
academic youth insists on it with all manner of deep
involvement and of nonviolent (and occasionally violent)
chaHengeF’

Erikson’s address to the evil of the coercive “loyalty
oath,” two decades earlier, isvevident once more: his
conviction that human beings can no longer compart-
mentalize self-identity into personal, ethical, profession-
al, religious, and political pigeonholes.

It was not long after our initial discussion of evil that

looking San Francisco Bay. We were surrounded
by beautiful things growing—lemon trees, clematis, azal-
ea, and even a reminder of another time, exquisite New
England ﬂowerings. Joan had prepared and served deli-
cious seafood, her husband helping.

Both Eriksons, having reached the “eighth stage” of
life and their own ninth decade, are now doing exactly
what their principle of “life-historical relativity” dic-
tates. Together they are vitally involved in pursuing the
study they began almost half a century ago: follow-up
into adulthood of the “normal” Berkeley children and
their families. They tell me about their informal conver-
sations with the parents—some now in their nineties—of
the children who had created those eye-opening toy
scenes long ago, at a time when the Eriksons’ two older
children were the same age as the Berkeley children. In
these conversations now in 1984, the Eriksons are at the
same moment “elderlies,” talking with agemates about
their children, and “elders,” bringing us wisdom.

We exchange news about our own children. I learn that

has just been elected president of the American Socio-
logical Association. As we chat, the Eriksons’ younger
son, Jon, arrives to photograph us. These lives seem all
of a piece. “It seems like you practice what you preach,”
I say. Erikson laughs and says wryly, “I hope the title of
my last book, The Life Cycle Completed, has enough
irony so people won’t think we believe we’re rounding
out some kind of perfect life here.”

This fall the Eriksons return to Harvard. They had
been missing the rigors of New England, they said. They
were looking forward to their stay at Winthrop House in
October and a six-week teaching stint. Their schedule of
lectures and seminars, which would take place in a num-
ber of departments throughout the University, was being
organized by the staff of the Erik H. and Joan M. Erikson
Center at the Cambridge City Hospital, where one of the
Medical School’s departments of psychiatry is based. An
“Oktoberfest” centered on Gandhian thought was being
planned to celebrate their return to the Harvard commu-
nity, and to pay homage not only to “the word” but to
the creative impulse in all art making—an integration of
anima and animus.

tation he gets. He made an exception last spring

when he was asked, just before his eighty-second
birthday, to address the American Psychiatric Association
at its annual meeting in Los Angeles. The central theme
was still evil. Half a century later, he was replying to
Adolf Hitler’s violent cry that “the species is in danger.”
Yes, he said, the species is indeed in danger, in mortal
danger, the entire species, called humanity. He addressed
an audience of several thousand, describing as an apogee
of evil, a “potential malignancy of universal dimensions

certainly today the nuclear winter is being spelled
out for us in its cosmic devastation and species—wide
destruction, and all this brought about by mankind’s most
ingenious means of technological invention.”

Erikson is not without hope, however, that humanity
can resolve its present “species—wide crisis.” “Men and
women of diverse cultures are becoming more responsive
to the universal nature of childhood as a binding all—
human phenomenon,” he said. When he expressed the
fervent wish that we “may learn to use our technological
genius for the development rather than for the destruction
of mankind,” the audience rose to its feet and applauded.

Erikson believes that human evolution has a built-in
tendency—spasmodically interrupted by periods of
regressive and violent exclusion—to create wider iden-
tities reaching toward what he calls an “all-human con-
sciousness.” The central and urgent question is whether
we have enough time to close the gap between the gal-
loping evil of the nuclear arms race, with its six-to-eight
minute warning, and the slowly developing good of that
evolution toward an “inclusive” human identity. This, he
is convinced, is the real race. C]

he moved his family back to Boston. There he lived, not
quite uninterruptedly. for the remaining ﬁfty years of his
life.

In February 1890 the ﬁfty-year-old Bowditch made his
ﬁrst trip to Honduras to explore the prospects for invest-
ing in a scheme for the commercial development of the
Patuca River region. Led by E.W. Perry, the expedition
of Boston investors was to travel up the river, survey the
country, and eventually move overland to the capital city,
Tegucigalpa. to discuss the concession with political

leaders. Time permitting, Bowditch also intended to stop
brieﬂy at Copan, since an agreement for ten years of
archaeological work there by Harvard’s Peabody Museum
of Archaeology and Ethnology, arranged by Bowditch,
was under consideration by the Honduran president. It
was approved in March while Bowditch was trekking
through the jungle.

Bowditch kept a journal that provides us with on-the—
spot reactions to Honduras. The trip via New Orleans
and Cuba went smoothly enough, but from the time the
prospective investors hit the coast of Honduras, they suf-
fered a series of delays and blunders by leader Perry that
at times seemed nightmarish to Bowditch. When they
ﬁnally started upriver, Bowditch rejoiced for a time in
this new world: “I could not help thinking,” he wrote.
“that it was rather an amusing proceeding for a respect-
able (I trust) man of Boston to be wandering after dark
up the Honduras River looking as carefully for a sandy
bay, as if he were walking up Fifth Avenue in search of
a good hotel, and not half as likely. if he were alone, of

ﬁnding one. And afterwards when in bed, I lay with the
moon shining through my mosquito bar and with the
Indians chattering about, the mosquitos buzzing outside,
evidently disgusted at not being able to get their bills
presented to me, it was about as unique an experience as
I have ever had or expect to have, especially as all my
comrades were acquaintances of but a short time, whife
the Indians were a lot of hard-working men whose ideas
of morality of any kind were of very meagre description.”

Bowditch was no Robinson Crusoe, and he expressed
mixed pleasure and apprehension at new freedoms:
“Shocking as it may seem, I already feel the delight of
going without stockings, and I shall probably appear in
Joy Street in a state of perfect dishabille by April. . . .
This wild kind of adventure is really very enjoyable for
a variety, and I feel so well that I have no doubt that it
will do me a heap of good.”

As the expedition bogged down, and it became appar-
ent that the trips to the capital and to Copan would have
to be forfeited, Bowditch grew to despise Perry for his
recklessness. Still, he could be philosophical: “Though
I do not View with pleasure the ﬁlth of my white suit, yet
I confess that it has not given me the horror that it would
have done to put on day after day such-looking garments
as I now don with perfect willingness. . . . I have washed
the trousers, and the difﬁculty in drying them deters me
from repeating the experiment, but they are dirtier than
any Irish hodcan'ier in Boston would be willing to wear.
To be sure there is a ﬂavor of departed gentility about
them, and they are whole, which is, of course, in their
favor.”

The going got much rougher. At one point Perry left
Bowditch waiting in the jungle for a week. “Camp Dis-
appointment” Bowditch called it, and his despair drove
him to uncharacteristic sarcasm as he discoursed on the
merits of safety pins: “When I go camping out again
. . . I shall know a little better the needs of the occasion.
Safety pins. God bless them and their inventor! Good at
all times and on all occasions, they tend to create hap-
piness and to maintain belief that human nature is not
entirely vile. Happy thought to bring safety pins. . . .
They serve to pin down the uprising collar ends of ﬂannel
shirts. They pin up the foot of my blanket. They fasten
anything and everything, and they are a blessing second
to none except life itself, and it is a question whether this
should be excepted, especially if it is necessary to pass
it on the Guampu [River] without any more excitement
than we have had for ﬁve days.”

When they ﬁnally got moving again, the Perry expe-
dition was plagued by drenching rains, and Bowditch
reached new depths, as he revealed in his diary: “If any
one thinks it is fun to get up in the open air with no cover
in the rain and to put on your clothes, amongst which
were a pair of absolutely wet stockings, a pair of wet
leather boots, with your other garments wet below the
knees, wet canvas legging and wet spurs, he is welcome
to try it, but when in addition to this your boot lacing
breaks in two places, then your cup of misery may be
considered as getting about as much in it as it will hold.”

Eventually, by early April, Bowditch did make his way
to San Pedro, where, having missed the train to Puerto
Cortes, he hired four men and a railroad push car to jump
him down the tracks: “I felt happy enough to be away
from Perry and to be once again my own master. . . . It
was a very rough and very poor line, and as we rattled

down the incline, I had to hold on at times to the edge of
the car to keep from being jounced off. . . . It was
exhilarating in the extreme to be getting towards the boat.
and as we looked ahead and saw the great palms waving
over the track and the tropical foliage on each side, some-
times in the forest we would seem to be going into a
tunnel of foliage. It was indeed lovely—a great change
from mule-riding, and though I sat on the ﬂoor of the car
and got my legs cramped by unusual positions, yet I was
happy as possible and enjoyed the ride much. Now and
then I found that I was insensibly talking mule talk to the
hand-car and even kicking my heels, as if I were on mule-
back.”

Such was Charles Bowditch’s introduction to Hon-
duras. He returned home with new enthusiasm for Central
America, and over the next two decades he sponsored,
on behalf of the Peabody Museum, a number of individ-
uals and expeditions in an effort to put together the basic
materials for studying the archaeology, ethnology, and
linguistics of Mexico and Central America.

Bowditch’s interest in these matters seems to have
begun in the early 18803, and probably resulted from a
friendship with Stephen Salisbury, director of the Amer-
ican Antiquarian Society in Worcester, Massachusetts.
During the 18803, Salisbury, with the support of Massa-
chusetts senator George Hoar, cornered the consulship at
Mérida, in Yucatan, to pursue personal interests in the
archaeology and ethnology of the peninsula. They spon-
sored a series of archaeological ofﬁcials, the most famous
and enduring of whom was 3 Worcester native, Edward
H. Thompson, who held the consulship at Mérida for
about twenty years. Through his friend Salisbury, Bow—
ditch became interested in Thompson’s discoveries at
Chichen Itza. Labna, and elsewhere. At the same time
Bowditch was encouraging the new Archaeological Insti-
tute of America, based in Boston, to focus on New World
as well as Old World sites, but with only moderate suc-
cess.

By 1890 Bowditch was involved in the astronomical
and calendrical puzzles presented by the Maya hiero-
glyphic writings and in the Spanish chronicles of the
conquest period. He maintained personally warrn rela-
tions with his coworkers in Maya epigraphy: J.T. Good-
man, Ernst Forstemann, and Alfred Maudslay; and in

1910 he published his major work. The Numeran’on, Cal-

But it was his close patronage and supervision of Central
American work at Harvard that was of more lasting sig-
niﬁcance. Generally speaking, his efforts in the NinetiES
were frustrating. limited successes, as Bowditch searched
in vain for a man who could link historic and prehistoric
Central America. But in his efforts lie important lessons.

opan was the ﬁrst step. The Copan concession
called for the Peabody to‘excavate for ten years
without interruption (the Museum was to under-
take some work each year), to build a permanent casa at
the ruin site, to take measures to protect the antiquities
from further vandalism (a growing problem throughout
Central America), and to share the subsurface ﬁnds
equally with the Honduran govemment—though Hon-
duras had no permanent place to preserve artifacts. The
ﬁrst expedition, led by John G. Owens, arrived in Hon-
duras in December 1891, with Marshall Saville as pho-
tographer and assistant, and H.W. Price as engineer.
Owens, a native of Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, and grad-
uate of Bucknell, originally had come to Harvard in the
summer of 1888 to study zoology, but had since spent
three ﬁeld seasons with Jesse Walter Fewkes among the
Hopi Indians in the Southwest. In the fall of 1890 Owens
became the ﬁrst graduate student in American archaeol-
ogy at Harvard, studying under the Peabody’s director,
Frederick W. Putnam, before a formal program really
existed. The following summer he again spent in the
Southwest, and on his return to Harvard he was the ﬁrst
recipient of the new Hemenway fellowship. That Decem-
ber he left for Central America as executive ofﬁcer of the
Copan work. Although Price, the engineer, turned out
poorly and left the expedition after two months, Owens
and Saville excavated, photographed, and made molds

sending back large and important shipments that ﬁrst
season.

Owens was a great hope for Bowditch, Putnam, and
the Peabody, and there is a certain tragedy in his fate. A
resourceful, strong young man, he had displayed an abil-
ity to learn and adjust quickly to the ﬁeld, which he
clearly enjoyed. Additionally. Owens combined engi-
neering and inventive skills with a sensitive tolerance for
other cultures. In his ﬁrst letter written from the ruins of
Copan, in mid December 1891, Owens signed himself

later he was clearing the site:

We have had to cut down a good many trees, and tonight there are
6 large campﬁres in this plaza. One about 20 ft. from the end of
our tent is nearly 20 ft. long and is grand to look into. As I sat and
looked into the ﬁre I wondered what my friends are doing back in
the good old States; and then I wondered if they ever think of me,
as I so often think of them.

Owens returned for the 1892-93 season without
Saville, but with a young man, George Byron Gordon,
as his engineer. On January 23, 1893, Owens wrote to
Bowditch, “My work on Mound #26 is revealing what
must have been a most magniﬁcent sculptured stairway
on the western slope of the mound. . . . I await with
much interest to see what we may ﬁnd in the house that
once crowned the pyramid.” But Owens never saw that
house; he died of yellow fever three weeks later, throwing
the expedition into disarray and the concession into jeop-
ardy, and leaving an unprepared Gordon to take charge.

Gordon had virtually no training in anthropology. but
he was a robust explorer. He had no inkling of the mean-
ing of Copan but sensed, as he wrote to Bowditch, that

be the greatest acquisition to science made so far by
excavation on these ruins.” A blunt, even crude man at

times, Gordon saw the importance of personal diplomacy
in Latin America but—unlike Owens—had little success
at it, and eventually he stopped trying. He accomplished
little in 1893 but returned to head the expedition of 1895,
This time supplies were held up interminably; his mold-
in g man fell sick, as did his assistant from Boston, Robert
Burkitt; and Gordon himself was laid up for weeks with
an infected leg. Still he continued to excavate, mold,
photograph, and ship. Gordon survived and accom-
plished as a tough engineer rather than as a humanist
scholar. Moreover, he began to feel the fascination of the
Maya: “It has a curious attraction somehow,” he wrote
of the hieroglyphic stairway. “I have got so that I am not
content unless I am there. My ambition now is to get a
mould and photograph of every piece in it before leaving
it again.” Conﬁdent that future scholars would divine the
meanings, for himself he was, as he said, “satisﬁed to
do what I have been entrusted to do—to let nothing
escape preservation.”

Eventually, after graduate work at Harvard, Gordon
went on to a curatorship at the University Museum in
Philadelphia. For Bowditch, though, Gordon was never
more than a stop-gap measure, a means of keeping the
concession going in strong hands, and preserving the
ruins. He wrote of Gordon in 1902 that “he is a little too
fond of making things suit his theories instead of getting
together all the facts on which his theory should rest.”
Equally signiﬁcant, Bowditch did not like Gordon’s per-
sonal manners and even questioned his honesty.

 

ith Honduras in political turmoil in the mid
Nineties, Bowditch turned his attention more

fully to Lacandon country, the highlands of

Mexico and Guatemala that were presumed to be the
homeland of the descendants of the pre-Columbian Maya.
At this point Bowditch became convinced that archaeol-
ogy and epigraphy must be coordinated with linguistics
and ethnology in order to reconstruct Central American
history. His ﬁrst effort in this direction was a total failure.
Jeremiah Curtin, a Harvard classmate of 1863, world
traveler, linguistic genius, and part-time worker for the
Bureau of American Ethnology, suggested that he could
visit the Lacandones for a few months, learn their lan-
guage, and compare it with the writings on the ruins. He
assured Bowditch: “If the art of reading Maya hiero-
glyphs exists, and there is a chance that it does exist, I
am pretty sure to learn it without aid from the writings

 

 




 

 

of those who have wrestled with the problem so far.”
Curtin was presumptuous, to say the least, but he had
demonstrated an amazing facility with numerous lan-
guages. In any case, his talents in this instance remained
untested, for while he took Bowditch’s $5,000 for the
year, he dawdled away month after month in Mexico,
never entering seriously into his business in the high-
lands. He then accused Bowditch of losing faith and
pulling out just as he was getting started. Bowditch was
furious but powerless in the face of such gall. ,

After the Curtin ﬁasco, Bowditch turned to Teobert
Maler of Mérida. Maler, a veteran of Mexican emperor
Maximilian’s army of the 18603, was an eccentric who
complained incessantly of life in the tropical jungles but
could never stay away. Maler was no ethnographer, but
he was a ﬁne photographer and, again, a remarkable
survivor. Bowditch hired Maler to survey the region of
the Usumacinta River, through the Peten of Guatemala
and Chiapas in Mexico—the Maya highland country.
Between 1897 and 1904 Maler uncovered, mapped, and
photographed hundreds of structures and stelae. He
worked at Yaxchilan, Piedras Negras, El Cayo, Tikal,
and numerous sites in the river region. The published
results were vitally important, a series of Peabody
Museum Memoirs which appeared between 1901 and
1911. Maler’s photographs were invaluable for study of
the inscriptions, but his comm ‘
editing by Putnam and Bowditch,
by line. “I would also like to call your attention,” Putnam
wrote to Bowditch in 1907, “to a paragraph on page 29
of the Siebal MS, which I suggest should be omitted

on account of the personal slur that is in it. Of
course I have changed the words ‘scoundrel’ and ‘rascal,’
etc. Such terms mean so much more in our language than
they do in German.” On another occasion Putnam won-
dered “how he will like some of the changes I made in
[his manuscript of Motul]. I left out or modiﬁed some of
his tirades against the priests and Catholics. There is a
beautifully egotistic passage at the end which I have let
remain as it is too good to cut out, and if I did cut it out
would break his heart I am sure.”

The distance between Boston and Mérida always invit—
ed misunderstanding, and it seemed to increase with Mal-
er’s deep resentment of the Peabody men, who he imag-
ined were making great proﬁts from his work. Bowditch’s
payments to Maler stopped around 1905, but the writing
and editing continued for several years more, while rela-
tions strained and then broke completely. Maler reserved
special venom for Edward H. Thompson, the Peabody’s
man at Chichen Itza. The jealousy and dislike between
Thompson and Maler reached a climax in 1910 when
Maler publicly revealed, for the ﬁrst time, that Thompson
had been smuggling artifacts from the cenote (sacred
well) at Chichen back to the Peabody and the American
Antiquarian Society. Maler was hardly pure in motivation
or action, since he had been bribing Thompson’s workers
to sell him the cenote artifacts, which he then shipped to
the Field Museum in Chicago. The Maler-Peabody con-
nection thus ended in a barrage of bitterness.

Of all the Peabody men in Central America it was
Edward Thompson who labored longest and hardest. He
is best known for his dredging of the sacred cenote at
Chichen, partly because he and others published romantic
accounts of it, and partly because the removal of artifacts
from the country led in later years to a celebrated lawsuit

against Thompson, Harvard, the Peabody Museum, and
the Field Museum. It is not clear who ﬁrst proposed
dredging the well, though Thompson, typically, described
the notion as having come to him on a moonlit night as
he pondered past scenes of the sacriﬁce of virgins. Cer—
tainly Bowditch and Salisbury were familiar with Bishop
Landa’s account of stories of the sacriﬁces of precious
objects and young maidens in the cenote waters. What—
ever the origin of the enterprise, it was timely for Thomp-
son because his credit was low with Bowditch. By 1900
Bowditch was seriously questioning the returns on his
annual investment of $1,000 in Thompson. Displeased
with his romantic theorizing and failure to submit regular
reports, in 1900 Bowditch had written that “the time has
come when this special kind of work by Thompson must
cease. He has succeeded in boring his friends as well as
the ruins of Chichen Itza.”

The cenote work. which lasted from 1904 to I907,
temporarily raised Thompson's status. It was pursued
throughout with a sense of urgency and secrecy which
Thompson seems to have enjoyed: he shipped his ﬁndings
via his “underground railroad.” as he called it. through
customs in Progeso and New York. On occasion visitors
took pieces out of Mexico on their persons. The urgency

derived less from a sense of illegality—the actions were
lcgal at the time—and more from concern that if the
activities became known. export laws might be passed or
local ofﬁcials might crack down even without laws. In
addition. the Boston men sensed the political instability
of Mexico. With the preservation of such ﬁnds at stake
and a malleable government in danger, they felt they must
act quickly and quietly.

Whatever the legal and moral implications of this par-
ticular episode, it was the apex of Thompson’s career.
He concluded his 1907 report of operations by stating
that “while the hour has now struck beyond which no
more work of this kind may be done prudently, this fact
does not affect us. We have ﬁnished our task. We have
had our feast and those who come after us can only be
but gleaners content with the crumbs left over from the
banquet.” Certainly not a sentiment in accord with the
noblest traditions of science! Afterwards he attempted at
various times to interest Bowditch in further investment,
but political turmoil and rapid developments in Central
American professional archaeology quickly outdated his
style and methods.

Edward Thompson’s story was actually a familiar one
in nineteenth-century archaeology. His problem was pro-
vincialism: concentration on and devotion to a speciﬁc
area and a set of obsessive ideas, which in time came to
starve him intellectually, rather than nourish new thoughts.
Bowditch, who always complained of Thompson’s

unbusinesslike methods, caught the situation exactly in L

a note to Putnam in 1901: “Isolated as he is in Yucatan,
he does not know what is going on elsewhere, and I hope
your letter will stir him up not only to do good work but
to let us know what he is about.” In a sense the moonlit
nights did get to Thompson and—to venture a judg-
ment—spoiled his science as they enriched his life. In a
stunning passage written to a colleague in 1921, after
Bowditch’s death, Thompson revealed the mixture of
metaphor and reality that his life had become:

At this distance and under the present conditions the death[s] of the
three, Salisbury, Putnam, Bowditch, seem to be an irreparable
calamity to us of the faith. It is the breaking of the sacred tripod
vessel. A new vessel can be fashioned but it can never be the old
one, with its memories its hopes and its successes. They were in at
the beginning, when the study became the science. Hence my
remembrance of them as the three legs of a sacred vessel. (You
know those tripod legs moulded into human ﬁgures that sustained
the vessel.) There is a beautiful specimen in the Museum that I got
over twenty years ago. I obtained it when all three were alive and
in full vigor. Since the death of Mr. Bowditch the thought and vision
of this vessel has for some reason repeatedly recurred to me in my
dreams.

aler, Gordon, Curtin, Thompson—all were
Mincomplete, unsatisfactory in one way or anoth-

er. By 1900 Bowditch was in despair at ever
getting Maya studies off the ground in a systematic way.
At this point he realized that the right person was not
simply going to come along—indeed that the right person
could not emerge under current conditions. He and Put-
nam, with outside help from Franz Boas at Columbia,
were going to have to deliberately create a Maya scholar.
In November 1899 he presented the situation to Putnam,
emphasizing the need for linguistic students. But could
students be expected to turn to Central American ethnog-
raphy and linguistics without incentives? If Harvard were
to offer prizes or incentives for study of Central American

“It is rather a long road to travel

to ﬁll, but I do not know any other
way to accomplish the object.”

 

languages, who was competent to judge the students?
These were severe problems.

Through his inﬂuence in the Archaeological Institute
of America, Bowditch persuaded that organization to
offer a four-year scholarship in Central American studies.
The ﬁrst candidate was Alfred Kroeber, and Putnam and
Bowditch hoped greatly that he would commit himself to
Maya work. But Kroeber opted for the new department
of anthropology being founded by Phoebe Hearst at
Berkeley. Bowditch was glum:

We must, if possible, ﬁnd someone who is ﬁtted to take this schol—
arship in the Central American languages. Of course, if we cannot
do anything, we shall have to educate a man up to the work, but I
feel strongly that we should use all our efforts to ﬁnd a man already

ﬁtted for our purposes. Of course, I should not wish to accept an
inferior man for the sake of beginning work at the present time.

At this point Putnam suggested a graduating senior at
Harvard, Alfred Tozzer, from Lynn, Massachusetts.
Bowditch responded without enthusiasm:

If no student, who is already ﬁtted to undertake this work appears,
we might, after looking over the ﬁeld pretty thoroughly, select some
one who is likely to be a suitable person and send him out this
summer amongst the Indians and see how well ﬁtted he is for
meeting and living with semi-civilized tribes and for making col-
lections of materials and linguistics. Perhaps your man Tozzer will
be the best, but before deciding on the person, I should like to have
some further correspondence with others.

He reluctantly contributed $500 for Tozzer’s ﬁrst lin-
guistic ﬁeldwork, four months in California in 1900.
Although Tozzer gave a good “token of what was in
him,” as Bowditch put it, the older man still thought “it
is rather a long road to travel to be obliged to educate a
man to take a scholarship which we are anxious to ﬁll,
but I do not know any other way to accomplish the
object.” On June 29, 1901, Tozzer called on Bowditch,
who later in the day assessed the young man:

He strikes me on the whole as . . . very well intentioned, not over
strong intellectually. and probably capable of acquiring all the infor—
mation which a student holding the scholarship. which we are talk-
ing about, would need to acquire. but whether he has got the stamina
to hold his own with the uncivilized races, and whether he is going
to be one who will do honor to the work with which we propose to
entrust him, I hardly like to venture an opinion, as I know so little

 

 

 




 

 

 

of him. He does not impress me. however, as if he would be sure
to accomplish this work.

Bowditch strongly recommended work with Boas in
the ﬁeld. if possible. In the end he supported Tozzer
another season, this time with the Navajos. Finally, in
1902 the young man left for his real initiation in the
Central American highlands. Bowditch worried constant~
ly over Tozzer’s health, and although he was on a Euro—
pean trip, Tozzer’s letters were forwarded. He made a
promising start. “He seems to be taking hold in the right
spirit & I have great expectations from his work,” Bow-
ditch wrote.

For his part, Tozzer had reservations about his role
among the Indians near Lake Petha, in Chiapas, where
he observed ceremonies and recorded chants. With inti-
macy came guilt: “I am acting the low and mean part of
a hypocrite. Almost daily I am on my knees before their
idols waving the palm leaves in the smoke of the copal
and sending up my chants to their gods. But this all came
as a consequence of my being allowed the privileges I
enjoy. I shall moreover bring home with me two of the
‘santos’ made to order as it were. They have had two
rites performed over them and are in good and proper
standing as gods, my personal ‘santos.’ If I was to carry
out the commands concerning them I have been told, my
life would for ever after be a burden. But each command
is a new point so I listen patiently.” Tozzer returned from
his ﬁrst two seasons conscious that the connections
between present populations and pre-Columbian peoples
would not be easily established.

These years—I900 to 1905—were extremely crucial
for the institutionalization of anthropology at Harvard,
and in the country as a whole. And it was in these years
that the bond between Tozzer and Bowditch grew and
became, ultimately, unbreakable. From this point until
the older man’s death, in 1921, Tozzer and Bowditch
were in constant communication. Tozzer took Bowditch’s
advice to heart, lived by his principles of business and
science—which undoubtedly conformed well to his own
predilections anyway—while Bowditch shared the younger
man’s joys and sorrows and, in a sense, pursued his Maya
work through Tozzer’s as well as his own efforts.

Tozzer was to realize Bowditch’s hopes for him by
becoming a central ﬁgure in the discipline of anthropol-

ogy in the twentieth century. As a member of the Harvard
faculty from 1905 to 1949, and the ﬁrst Bowditch pro-
fessor of Central American and Mexican archaeology and
ethnology, Tozzer was mentor, in his turn, to generations
of anthropologists.

To my knowledge the two men never had a serious
quarrel. Their correspondence over the years became
voluminous; the pattern was set early with a letter of 1903
to Tozzer in the ﬁeld in Central America. Tozzer had
proposed coming home for a year or so to write up his
Navajo and Central American work, and to get his Ph.D.
degree. This was Bowditch’s response, in part:

Dear Mr. Tozzer:

Several working maxims have always been before me from my
boyhood. Among these are, “What you do, do with all your might,”
and “When you enter into an agreement, carry it out to the letter.”
Whatever success I have had in life has come to me from following
these maxims as nearly as possible. . . . '

I had always expected you would pass part of the time in each
year in cooler climates, but I had also supposed that you would ﬁnd
itnecessary to live for many months at a time with the Indians. My
opinion may be merely theoretical. but I cannot think it possible
that you can gain the conﬁdence of any wild tribe by making a stay
of a few weeks with them. I had hoped that you would ﬁnd it
possible, if you adopted the Usumasinta Valley for your working-
ground, to stay in some high and healthy locality, where you could
get most intimately acquainted with the Indians, and could ﬁnd out
all that it is possible for a white man to know about them. . .

For this reason and also for the reason that the longer you delay
the less chance there will be of obtaining the information that is
needed, and in order to carry out the understanding which you
assumed with the fellowship, I feel sure that you ought not to leave
your work the next year. The material, which you have collected,
can wait. Your degree can wait. . . .

I write to you as I should to my own son, and I hope you will
believe me when I say that my advice is given as much for your
own ultimate good as for that of the undertaking, which you have
entered into. '

Bowditch’s letter to Tozzer is in essence a father’s advice
to his son, not unlike Polonius to Laertes, but couched
in the terms of professional anthropology. What was
Bowditch saying to Tozzer?

ne of the greatest fears of nineteenth-century
American culture was the apparent disappearance
of true selﬁessness in the face of the powerful
dynamics of commercial self-interest and obvious polit-
ical greed. Much of the civic activism that Boston and

other urban areas experienced among their genteel classes
after the Civil War was in effect an attempt to reassert
the spirit of selﬂessness, of disinterested effort, which,
they insisted, must still be a primary human motivation.
Selﬁsh motivation in science was especially dangerous
and deplorable, because science promised such power to
shape society, and because the selﬁshness could take so
many different forms. First, there was economic self-
interest. Any taint of this was anathema in men of sci-
ence; at the same time, efﬁciency, accountability, and

solid business methods were desirable, as Bowditch often

said. Secondly, appeal to popular audiences was suspect

as an ego-gratifying substitute for quiet competence.
Thirdly, self—indulgence in the form of imaginative, fan-
ciful theories was considered improper, an illicit intrusion
of oneself into the scientiﬁc process—although the line
between legitimate hypothesis and unfounded speculation
was often difﬁcult to draw. In the end it came down to
self-discipline. The signs of selﬂessness were the same
as they had always been: self-restraint, self-respect, at
home and in the ﬁeld—this was as important in anthro-
pology as in any ﬁeld of science, indeed, any ﬁeld of
endeavor. Good taste was a matter of selﬂessness, of
removing ego as much as possible from one’s work.

What did it take, what did it mean, to be a professional
anthropologist at the turn of the century, as Bowditch
envisioned it? Thompson was unbusinesslike, unreliable,
romantic in his musings, possibly dishonest on occasion.
Much the same could be said of Gordon, in addition to
which he was at times simply crude. Maler, too, was
fanciful and egocentric, out to advertise himself; Cur-
tin—well, Curtin blatantly broke a contract. Each in his
own way demonstrated lack of that strange, quaint but
vital property known a century ago as “character”; each
failed the test for selﬂessness, while Tozzer passed it.

Putnam and Bowditch—and Franz Boas at Columbia,
for he fully shared in this—fought mightily against the
fraud of their age, which was based, as they saw it, on
multiple forms of selﬁshness. Very few people, it
seemed, could be counted on to work out of devotion to
truth. Graduate training in anthropology was, according-
ly, intended partly, perhaps primarily, as moral training,
both sharpening the minds and purging the hearts of
young men and women. The purging and sharpening
were necessary preludes to great fulﬁllment and joy in
later applying the powers of analysis and imagination to
their work. Discipline was neverintended to mean nar-
rowing sc0pe or lowering horizons—on the contrary, the
hope was always for controlled, imaginative synthesis,
augmenting the powers of the individual in a disciplined,
responsible manner. Thus the new century of profession-
alism in anthropology would inherit, it was hoped, a vital
moral element from Bowditch and his generation, who
were intent that science and secularism would not lead to
hollow, amoral technique.

In his autobiography, Maya Archaeologist, Sir Eric

64H HARVARD MAGAZINE

Thompson remarked upon the rapid secularization in
Central American anthropology in this century. “I had
the fortune to belong—although only by the skin of my
teeth—to the last generation of archaeologists who were
able to have extended interests,” he wrote. “Now, with
the enormous increase of knowledge, ﬁelds of speciali-
zation are so narrow that archaeologists are in mortal
danger of becoming technicians,” Thompson contended.
He pointed to Tozzer as a fortunate model, a man whose
studies in linguistics, ethnography, and ﬁeld archaeology
“gave him a broad outlook and an ability to interpret
work in one ﬁeld with information gathered in others.”

Lamentations against overspecialization and low hori-
zons are common fare today. But Sir Eric went on to
suggest a deeper discomfort: “In earlier days,” he wrote,
“it was still possible to have a fair knowledge of every
aspect of Maya civilization, past and present, and that
made for a richer life. . . . ” While teamwork and
camaraderie have their virtues, they do not replace a
wide-ranging personal experience, which has a unique
immediacy. The crux of the issue is aesthetic satisfaction
vs. scientiﬁc progress, or, differently phrased, personal
fulﬁllment vs. progress for the scientiﬁc community. The
inspiring ideal behind modern professional science has
been the picture of a community of inquirers extending
through space and time, working impersonally toward an
ideal of ultimate truth.

Bowditch’s generation cherished this vision, for they
feared total capitulation of commitment to such an ideal
before the false gods of economic greed, commercial
self-interest, and personal gain. But the vision and the
moral impulse required an institutional form, a mecha-
nism to bring it to realization. The search for truth in
anthropology, it was apparent, could not survive without
ﬁrm protection against the winds of American commerce
and politics. The university department became the twen-
tieth-century institutional answer to this nineteenth-cen-
tury vision.

Bowditch and his scientiﬁc son, Tozzer, met at a time
when synthesis of analysis and imagination seemed still
barely within the grasp of the individual. But it was
quickly receding even as the number of Central American
scholars grew prior to the First World War. While in one
sense this period saw the founding of professional Central
American work, it must also be seen as a ﬂeeting his-
torical moment: a moment of balance between nine-
teenth-century imagination and twentieth—century disci-
plined training. Through all the complex institutional and
ﬁeld relationships in the search for a Maya scholar and
through all the ﬁnancial maneuvering, what emerges is
an attempt to discipline the anthropological intellect with—
out sacriﬁcing the anthropological imagination, all the
while preserving honesty and probity. This is the real
story of the professionalizing of Central American work
at Harvard at the turn of the century. D

This is the so—called greenhouse effect.

little sea-level rise and barrier islands
have been able to hold their own. Since
the 19305 however, this rise has started
to accelerate.”

According to a 1983 report prepared
by the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA), the sea level may rise as much as
one foot over the next 40 years and three

, to ﬁve feet over the next century. Their

worst-case scenario projects as much as a

will be most severe for several decades
and Chatham must face the full brunt of

of its barrier beach.”

Coastal Zone Management

Coastal communities have two options
to deal with sea-level rise. They can either
stabilize their coasts or they can learn to .
live with the inevitable and stage a strate—
gic retreat from the endangered coast.

Traditionally, coastal communities
have fought erosion by constructing sea
walls, jetties, and grains, rigid structures
that slow the local erosion of the coast.
Ultimately, however, these hard stabiliza-
tion strategies only create worse erosion
further down the shore because they in-
terfere with the natural ﬂow of sand that
mustr constantly renourish beaches.

In the case of large coastal cities where millions of
dollars of development have already been spent, how-
ever, such a strategy might still make sense. Louisiana is
building sea walls to maintain its present shoreline be-
cause that is the basis for its oﬂ'shore boundary. Any
reduction of its oﬁ'shore boundary could cause the state
to lose income from the sale of oﬁ'shore oil-drilling '\
rights. 0 v e r ) ,/

Scientists try to restore conch population in Florida, Caribbean

Industry harvested millions of
pounds of conch meat yearly

By Bill Belleville
Sglal to The Christian Science Monitor

 

Altamonto Springs, Fla.

Fearing that a once—plentiful marine mollusk may be
disappearing from Florida waters, scientists here are
carefully assessing the stock of the queen conch.

The conch, known to tourists for its role as the main
ingredient in fritters and chowders, may be replenished
through mariculture if stock counts fall as low as
expected.

Scientists ﬁgure that the wild conch probably will
never again support the conunercial ﬁshery that re-
sulted in millions of pounds of conch meat being har-
vested a year, as it once was in the Florida Keys. But a
revitalized wild population would reintroduce the
conch to the state’s marine environment, and let people

The idea behind the farm-raised. conch is the same as
that of other species grown through mariculture: to
greatly reduce the early mortalities from disease and

It is with

the greatest pleasure that I present this keynote
address here to

. . inaugurate the annual meetings of the American
Assoc1ation for the Advancement of Science. By the time I have
completed these remarks; I hope you will agree with me that the
world that provides our evolutionary and ecological context is in
serious trouble, trouble of a kind that demands our urgent
attention. By formulating adequate plans for dealing with these
largescale problems, we will be laying the foundation for peace
and prosperity in the future; by ignoring them, drifting
passively while attending to what seem more urgent, personal
priorities, we are courting disaster.

Even though we live in a world where far more people are
well fed, clothed, and housed today than ever before, we also
live in a world in which up to 100,000 people starve to death

every day, one in which we consume well over a third of total
terrestrial photosynthetic productivity, and one in which our
activities are threatening up to a quarter of the other kinds
organisms on earth with extinction in the near future. Since we
base our civilization almost completely on our ability to utilize
these organisms for our benefit, the loss of so many of them
threatens to limit permanently the options that will“be available
for our children and grandchildren.

Despite these relationships, some of us are apparently so
desperate to avoid the need for governmental action of any kind
that they attempt to lull us to sleep by pretending that there is
no problem, that inaCtion is best, and that we should simply
continue to indulge our selfishness to the fullest extent. To
provide such counsel is to offer exceedingly dangerous advice at
precisely the wrong time. We scientists, who have the means to
know better, must help to inform the public about the facts, and
the need for action concerning them.

The global human population, which passed the 5 billion mark
for the first time last year, and is growing at an annual rate
estimated at 1.7%, is a dominant ecological force without
precedent. ‘Our numbers have doubled since 1950, and will double
again in about 40 years if present trends continue. It has
recently been calculated that we consume, co-opt, or forego about
40% of the total terrestrial photosynthetic productivity, a sure
indication of the profound way in which we are affecting the
global ecosystem. At the same time, regional climatic problems
are becoming increasingly apparent, another sign of wide—scale
danger. How will we respond to these threats, and why should

those of us who live in the relative comfort of countries such as
the United States even care? »

Many of our most serious problems are centered in the
tropics, where biological diversity is concentrated and is being
lost most rapidly and whole ecosystems are being disrupted. In
the tropics, three factors are of special importance: (1) the
explosive growth of record human populations; (2) widespread and
extreme poverty; and (3) an ignorance of the ways in which to-
carry out productive agriculture and forestry. Lets' look at
these three factors in turn.

As recently as 1950, about 45% of a global population of
some 2.5 billion people lived in countries that lie wholly or
partly in the tropics; today, the figure is about 55% of a global
population that is more than twice as large. If present trends
continue, nearly two-thirds of the people in the world will be
living in these countries (excluding China) by the year 2020. In
actual numbers, the 1.1 billion people who inhabited them 36
years ago will have grown to about 5 billion people in another 34
years: a quadrupling of the total in 70 years! Meanwhile, the
proportion of people living in industrial countries is falling
drastically. For each of us living in countries like the United
States in 1950, there were approximately 2 other people living
elsewhere; by 2020, there will be 5. Population structure
suggests that the global population may stabilize in about a
century at a level of perhaps 10 or 11 billion people. As its
growth slows down, there will be increased opportunities for
raising standards of living —— a real reason for preserving as
many kinds of organisms as possible and taking some of the steps
I shall advocate this evening.

 

The rapidly growing populations of tropical countries
include large numbers of poor people. In 1986, for example,
per capita GNP in the United States was estimated at $14,080,
whereas that in neighboring Mexico amounted to $2180; in
Honduras, it was $670. Overall, the industrial nations, with
less than a quarter of the global population, control about 80%
of the wealth, while the largely tropical developing countries,
with 54% of the population, control about 15% of the wealth.
Meanwhile, in both Africa and Latin America, per capita income is
steadily declining.

the

Within tropical countries, about 1 billion of the estimated
2.7 billion people live in absolute poverty; they are unable to
count on adequate food, shelter, and clothing from one day to the
next. Of these, 300 to 400 million people consumed less that 80%
of U.N. recommended standards, a diet insufficient to prevent
"stunted growth and serious health risks." UNICEF estimates that
about 35 million people starve to death every year in the
tropics, including more than 14 million children under the age of
four. This amounts to nearly 100,000 people, and 40,000 babies,
every day. Worse, many millions of additional children exist
only in a state of lethargy, their mental capacities often
permanently impaired by their lack of access to adequate amounts
of food.

In Latin America alone, the 30 million landless rural
households, together with those that own less than an acre of

 




land, now represent close to 40% of all rural households. The
difficulties in improving this situation can be illustrated by
Brazil, where President Jose Sarney's is attempting to distribute
100 million acres of land to 1.4 million essentially landless
families by 1989. These efforts are encountering generating
increasing rural violence; they illustrate how the growing extent
of rural landlessness everywhere in the tropics is a serious

cause of poverty, malnutrition, and social unrest in many
regions.

In addition to large populations and extensive poverty,-
tropical countries suffer from a lack of information about how to
put in place productive agriculture and forestry, and a lack of
willingness to apply those facts that are known. As a result,
the natural vegetation is often consumed as if it were a non-
renewable resource. Many tropical soils are relatively poor, and
require careful handling. In the natural ecosystems that develop
on such soils, most of the nutrients, except for phosphorus and
nitrogen, are held primarily in the vegetation. Cutting and
burning the trees releases these nutrients to the soil,
fertilizing them and allowing the temporary cultivation of crops;
when the excess nutrients are exhausted, usually within a few
years, the forests must be given time to recover.

Some traditional systems of cultivation on relatively
infertile soils combine trees, which are usually more productive
than herbaceous crops, with other plants. Agro-forestry systems
of this sort will be increasingly important as they are better
understood, and as farmers are encouraged to use them by offering
them loans for fertilizers, credit for seeds, information about
markets, and the like. In addition, relatively fertile soils
must be cultivated intensively by the best methods available,
with the most suitable crops.

 

Based on 1981 FAO estimates, about 2.3 million square miles
of tropical evergreen forest probably exists in 1987 -- about
half of the original area, now a forest that is roughly three-
quarters of the size of the U.S. exclusive of Alaska. In the
late 1970s, at least 40,000 square miles of such forest were -
being cut per year. If that is still the rate of clear-cutting,
and if it continues, the forests would last about 60 years -- if
there were no population growth or other increased pressures on
the forests from the late 1970s levels.

The decline in tropical forests arises in part from consumer
demand in industrialized countries. We obtain much of our timber
there, for example, and logging removes about 20,000 square miles
of tropical forest -- an area nearly the size of West Virginia --
every year. Meanwhile, reforestation is proceeding very slowly
in the tropics, with 10 trees being out each one that is planted,
and, in Africa, 29 being cut for each one planted. The
developed-world consumption of tropical hardwoods has risen 15
times since 1950, while in—country consumption has increased only
three times. Against this background, the inauguration of the
International Tropical Timber Agreement in 1986 -- an agreement
that involves all the major producers and consumers of tropical
woods -— is a development of high importance. In addition, the

organization of the Tropical Forest Action Plan by the World_
Resource Institute (WRI) is of great importance, both for a
stable supply of the commodities involved, and for biological

conservation as well. The widespread and simultaneous
destruction of temperate forests through acid precipitation and
other forms of atmospheric pollution compounds the overall
problem that we face in securing wood and pulp supplies for the
future.

The clearing of tropical forests for pastures affeCts an
area about half the size of that which is logged. For example,
the growing imports of beef from southern Mexico and Central _
America over the past 25 years have been the major factor in the
loss of about half of the forests in these regions, for the sake
of keeping the price of a hamburger in the 0.8. about a nickel
less than it would have been otherwise.

In addition, shifting cultivation and fuelwood gathering
together are severely damaging an additional area of tropical,
evergreen forest about equal to that which is being clear—cut.
Only about 200 million people are engaged in these activities
worldwide in areas of evergreen, lowland tropical forest. If
they were incorporated into the economies Of their respective
countries, the forests they are cutting would change immediately
from a non-renewable to a sustainable resource.

The relentless search for fuelwood is wrecking many tropical
forests; about 1.5 billion people -- a third of the world
population -- are cutting firewood faster than it can regrow in
the areas where they get it. If plantations for firewood were
established on cut over lands, with sufficient economic backing,
this trend could be reversed.

Taking both clear—cutting and the kinds of severe
disturbance that results from shifting agriculture and firewood
gathering together, the current rate of destruction of tropical,

evergreen forests may be calculated at roughly 80,000 square
miles per year -- an area about equal to t e Size of the state of

Kansas. At such a rate, all tropical, evergreen forests would be
gone in less than 30 years, even if there were no population
growth; this represents roughly the rate of forest destruction
that was taking place a decade ago.

Since human populations are in fact growing very rapidly ——
at the rate of approximately 2.4% per year -- much of the forest
will clearly be gone much sooner, however. Moreover, the actual
rates of destruction differ widely from region to region. Three
large blocks of lowland, evergreen forest -— those in the
northern and western Brazilian Amazon, the interior of the
Guyanas, and the Zaire Basin of Africa -- are larger and less
densely populated than the rest, and consequently are being cut
more slowly. Their forests might, therefore, last past the
middle of the let century. The remaining forests, however, will
mostly be gone, or at least profoundly altered in nature and
composition, much earlier. These include the tropical, lowland
forests of Mexico, Central America, and the West Indies, and
those of Andean South America, as well as the forests of the—
southern and eastern Amazon; all similar forests of Africa and
Madagascar outside of the Zaire Basin; and all the forests of
tropical and subtropical Asia and the Pacific Islands. For the
most part, they will have been consumed or severely damaged
within the next 15 years or so.

 




We have been emphasizing lowland, evergreen forests because
of their biological richness, and because they are the most
extensive tropical forests that have persisted to the present.
Dry deciduous forests, and all the other kinds of tropical
forests, have mostly been cut over and converted much earlier
than tropical, evergreen forests, being better suited to
agricultUre and cattle grazing. For example, the dry deciduous
forests that once occurred along the Pacific Coast of MexiCo and
Central America covered an area approximately twice the size of
Texas 500 years ago. Today, only about 2% of this once extensive
biome exists in anything resembling its original form. The
Guanacaste National Park project in Costa Rica, to which I shall
return later, represents an exemplary effort to restore and
preserve a significant area of such forest.

The destruction of natural resources in the tropics and
subtropics is intimately related to the global economy. The
global economy is driving the export of cash crops from many
regions of the tropics rapidly upward, often resulting in the
displacement of poor farmers who are forced to farm less suitable
lands and destroy the forests there. This trend has been evident
in the Sahel, for example, for which massive exports of peanuts
and cotton are sent to Europe, and in Thailand, which exports
huge quantitites of cassava.

The international debt is greatly affecting relationships
between developing and industrial countries in the 1980s. In
1970, the external debt of Third World countries was about $72
billion; today, it is approximately $1 trillion. The existence
of this debt clearly encourages many Third World countries to
overexploit their natural resources without the creation of
stable, productive alternatives: logging restrictions are eased,
poor farmers are displaced to regions that will not support them
on the long term, the production of foods that the people can eat
(remember that on the average, a fifth of them are malnourished)
is decreased in favor of the production of export crops. The
associated austerity measures can throw large numbers of people

out of work, thus increasing the extent of poverty in the nations
involved.

Recently, a New York investment banker was quoted in The New

York Times as saying: "Somehow the conventional wisdom of 200 ___
million sullen South Americans sweating away in the hot sun for
the next decade to earn the interest on their debt so Citicorp
can raise its dividend twice a year does not square with my image
of political reality." Still more succinctly, Willy Brandt
termed the effects of the debt, "A blood transfusion from the
sick to the healthy. " The existence of the debt is making it
increasingly difficult to Third World countries to accept our
exports; they must instead export competitively, and to us, to
attempt to repay the debt itself. In this light, strenuous
efforts to repay the debt, somewhat paradoxically, appears to be
weakening, instead of strengthening, our own economy.

The runaway destruction of the natural resources of the_
tropics is also fueling massive immigration into the
industrialized nations of the temperate Zone. For example,
0.8. Immigration and Naturalization Service apprehended 1.7
million illegal aliens at the Mexican border alone in 1986, and
estimates that more than 3 million might have entered

the

successfully. The hunger and poverty that are responsible for
such immigration also underlie economic and political instability
in the tropics, and frustrate our efforts to achieve our
objectives in these areas.

Another major problem concerns the effects of tropical
deforestation on global climates. Such deforestation clearly
contributes substantially to the amounts of carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere, an issue of inreasing concern. In addition,
widespread deforestation is impairing the capacities of some
tropical systems to recycle rainfall inland, as well demonstrated
for the Amazon and possibly related to the past 20 Years of
drought in Africa also. Combined with the erosion and soil
deterioration that accompanies deforestation, these problems are
serious ones.

Recent findings suggest that the implications of widespread
deforestation may be even more extreme. Last December, at the
annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union, it was reported
that cutting the evergreen forests in South America would
precipitate a regional temperature rise of 3 to 50C. This would
extend the dry season and speed the deterioration of the
remaining forests, including reserves, whilexgreatly disrupting

agriculture. The effects of such major changes beyond the
regions directly impacted can only be guessed at present.

The effects of forest destruction and climatic change have
been most severe in sub-Saharan Africa. Here, per capita food
production has dropped 20% since 1960, and the FAO projects that
it will drop anoth/ 30% over the next 25 years, with population
growth greatly exceeding growth in-food production. Right now, a
majority of people living in the area have too little to eat, and
their collective international debt, roughly $200 billion, is
equal to 44% of gross domestic product or 190% of export
earnings.

Africa as a whole suffers from overvalued currencies and
from historical political situations, such as artificially
devalued food prices, that tend to favor urban dwellers over
farmers. When Kenya set a higher, more realistic level for the
government-controlled price of corn in 1985, for example,
production climbed by almost 50% the next year. Another negative
factor is that most food aid in Africa is made available in the
towns, which tends to pull the people out of the countryside,
thus causing them to neglect their crops. Development assistance
for Africa is falling rapidly, fewer than 5% of the couples use
modern contraceptive methods, and there are about 1 million more
mouths to feed in sub-Saharan Africa every three weeks, a sure
prescription for increasing human tragedy.

The most serious, long-term global problem that is resulting
from deforestation, however, is the loss of a large port1on of

condor -- but so what?" There has been an unfortunate tendency
for some of the media to jump on this bandwagon: it is more
stimulating to give the minority (and incorrect) View that
extinction presents no problem, or that everything is fine, than
it is to document the extent of the problems facing us --
besides, it is comforting, and more fun!

In fact, the loss of biological diversity is important to us
for many reasons. For example, three species of plants —- rice,
wheat, and corn -— supply over half of all human energy
requirements; only about 150 kinds of food plants are used
extensively; and only about 5000 have ever been used. Many of
these come to us from the tropics. It is estimated, however,
that there may be tens of thousands of additional kinds of plants
that could provide human food if their properties were fully
explored and they were brought into cultivation. There are many
uses for plants other than food, too; for example, oral
contraceptives for many years wereproduced from Mexican yams;
muscle relaxants used in surgery worldwide come from an Amazonian
vine, used traditionally to poison darts; the cure for Hodgkin‘s
disease comes from the rosy periwinkle, a native of Madagascar;

A and the gene pool of corn has recently been enriched by the
finding, on a small area in the mountains of Mexico, of a
perennial wild relative.

Among the undiscovered or poorly known plants are doubtless
many possible sources of medicines, oils, waxes, fibers, and
other commodities of interest to our modern industrial society.
Genetic engineering affords us additional possibilities for the
transfer of genes from oneskind of organism to another, even
though the donor may itself be of no economic interest whatever;
indeed, as our techniques become more sophisticated, we shall
come to depend even more heavily on biological diversity than we
do now.

How fast is extinction proceeding? Although only about
500,000 species of tropical organisms have been named, there are
at least 3 million, and perhaps ten times that many, yet to be
discovered. Investigating the beetle fauna of the canopy of
tropical forests in Panama and Peru, for example, Terry Erwin, of
the Smithsonian Institution, has fogged the canopies of the trees
with insecticides to obtain comprehensive samples for comparative
purposes. Based on these samples, he estimates that the true
number of species of insects may approach 30 million, or even
more.

If we assume that there are 3 million species of tropical
organisms, we can use the distributions of the better-known
groups as a guide to how many of the total species occur only in
those forests that will probably be destroyed or severely damaged
in the next 15 years or so. For plants, the figures would be
about 120,000 of the estimated total of about 165,000 tropical
species; just under half of the total of number of species in the
world occur only in forests that are rapidly being destroyed. If
the distribution of other groups Of organisms is roughly similar
to that of plants, then about 2.2 million species, or somewhat
less that half of the total, would be restricted to these
4 forests. How many of these species can we reasonably expect to
iksurvive?

The formation of parks and reserves in the threatened areas
would be an important element in the survival of biological
diversity; but such protected areas will survive only if they
exist in the context of economies that can support them --
particularly ones in which the rural poor are supported. The
explicit relationship between conservation and development is
outlined well in the World Conservation Strategy, issued jointly
by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and
Natural Resources, the World Wildlife Fund, and the United
Nations Environmental Programme in 1980. The future of such

reserves will depend in large measure on the functioning of the
global economy.

.Granted, however, that fragments of natural vegetation will
per51st in most areas, what level of survival can we expect? The
principal basis for making predictions of this sort lies in the
theory of island biogeography. This theory reSts on the
empirical observation that, in general, for islands and mainland
areas alike, the relationship between species number and area is
a logarithmic one, such that a tenfold increase in area is
associated with a doubling in the number of species of a given
group. The reciprocal relationship, and one that is being
verified empirically in a number of experiments throughout the
world, is that a reduction of area to a tenth or less of its
original extent should place half or more of the kinds of
organisms that occurred in the larger area at risk.

. The biological basis for this relationship is clear. As
areas are reduced in size, the population sizes of the organisms
in them are also reduced. When a population is small, the chance
of survival of the species is reduced on the basis of chance.

An illustration of the way this process works is provided by
the history of bird populations on Barro Colorado Island, an
island of about 6 square miles that was formed between 1911 and
1914 by the flooding of the Panama Canal.' Set aside as a reserve
in 1923, Barro Colorado Island was home at that time to 208
species of breeding birds. It has been protected as a reserve
continuously. Over the next 60 years, at least 45 of these birds
became extinct, despite the fact that Barro Colorado Island is
separated from the source areas on the mainland by a distance of
approximately 600 feet, a distance that any of the species of
birds involved could cross easily.

Hunting and poaching become more intense when surviving
patches of vegetation are small. In addition, inbreeding and the
consequent loss of genetic variability puts species increasingly
at risk. The borders of the patches are affected by sun, wind,
and other factors in ways that damage their integrity. Regional
climatic changes, such as those affecting precipitation, can
change the climate in the patches, leaving the species vulnerable
and with nowhere to migrate.

There are many examples of regional extinction on a massive
scale. For example, there were at least 88 species of land birds
in the Hawaiian Islands when the Polynesians arrived, 43 when
Captain Cook explored the islands, and 28 today -— two—thirds of
which are endangered. The destruction of the lowland forests and

the introduction of exotic species have both contributed to the
decimation of the native birds and the plants.

The process

continues rapidly at the present day, because even as the richest
nation on earth, we seem unable to protect our natural heritage
adequately. The Hawaiian Islands provide a prime example of the
way in which ecosystems are simplified, while pests and weedy'
species become more widespread throughout the world.

One particularly significant example of an area in which
large numbers of species are endangered is Madagascar, an island
about twice the size of Arizona that lies about 250 miles off the
east coast of Africa. Here grow about 8500 species of plants,
some 6500 of which are found nowhere else. Madagascar is also

the only place where lemurs, one of the major groups of Primates,
survive, and there are many other unique and restricted organisms
All in all, the island is probably home to about 5% of

the total global diversity, probably 80% of
else.

Unfortunately, less than a tenth of the land surface of .
Madagascar is still covered with natural vegetation. The loss of
forests in northeastern Madagascar, the main forested area, has
been such that in 1949, only about 66% of the original forest was
left, and by 1984, only 36%, as determined by LANDSAT satellite
imagery. Where it once was richly forested in many areas, much
of‘Madagascar is now degraded pasture.

Since the forests where at least half 2.2 million species
occur will very probably be reduced to less than a tenth of their
total extent over the next 15 years or so, we may assume that
over a million species will become extinct during this period or
soOn afterwards. In western Ecuador, for example, a region that
was almost completely forested as recently as 1950 is now almost
completely deforested. As extensive deforestation of this kind
spreads in many other regions, we can expect the rate of
extinction to average more than 100 species a day, with the rate
increasing from perhaps a few species a day now to several
hundred by the early years of the next century. The great
majority of these species will not have been collected, and
therefore will never be represented in any scientific collection,
preserved, or known in any way. No comparable rate of extinction
has occurred since the end of the Cretaceous Period, 65 million
years ago; and the background level of extinction is perhaps a
thousandth of that we are experiencing now.

From any point of view, the situation that has just been
described is extremely serious. Scientifically, we are losing
the opportunity to understand the nature of much of the diversity
of life on earth. Aesthetically, we are losing the chance to
appreciate fully the results of the process of evolution over the
billions of years since life appeared on our planet.
Economically, we are denying to ourselves, our children, and our
grandchildren the opportunity to utilize many of the plants,
animals, and microorganisms that exist now for their benefit.’

A new kind of global thinking will be necessary to manage
the world ecosystem properly for the enormous human populations
of the future. To demonstrate this fact, simply recall that we
are now using directly, foregoing, or converting about 40% of
global terrestrial productivity, and that are numbers are
projected to double in the next 41 years. Stability everywhere
is in the interests of all, yet we are doing relatively little to
promote it. Sustainable agriculture and forestry systems must be

iought to be integral parts of development planning.

developed in every country, and their development will benefit
everyone. When nations are stable and self-sufficient, they can
import and export products, repay debts, provide a decent
standard of living for their people, improve their governments,
and preserve their biological diversity. When they are unstable
and dependent, they cannot afford imports and can organize
exports only with difficulty, they will default on debts, cannot
provide for their people, who then may emigrate in large numbers,
will tend to have unsuitable and unstable governments, and will
squander their biological diversity for short—term gain.

In view of the numbers of people involved, the fragility of
farm lands everywhere, and the debt, we cannot hope to feed the
people of the world through temperate-zone agriculture. Indeed,
as pointed out by RandalliPurcell of the Curry Foundation in the
Wall Street Journal for January 23, 1987, improving the quality
of.agficulture in Third World countries, especially among the
rural poor, would be the most effective way to enable them to
have the means to accept our own exports, agricultural and
otherwise.

 

The international debt presents a real obstacle to achieving
ecological and political stability in many parts of the world.
The $22 billion paid by poor, developing countries to rich,
industrial countries in 1985, for example, contributed'
substantially to the promotion of global instability. Payments
on the debt should be mitigated or suspended when necessary, or
managed in such a way as to add to, rather than to detract from,
world stability.

International development assistance, carefully planned and
targeted, is a critical factor in building global ecological
stability and thus promoting global stability. In the United
States, development and food aid clearly have a low priority; as
a proportion of our total foreign aid, they have decreased from
56% to 36% since 1980, while military aid has increased from 18%
to 40%. Such a pattern of distribution of aid missed the obvious
connection between ecological stability and security; no amount
of military action or intervention will provide true security
beyond the very short run, regardless of its ultimate aims.

In fiscal 1986, Congress provided $3.9 billion in
development assistance -— more than 20% less than the preceding
year -- to the nearly 100 nations that depend on outside
assistance to meet such basic needs as food, shelter, health
care, and family-planning services. Even though we in the U.S.
have the most to gain from promoting global stability, we are
12th in overall aid, including military aid, on a per capita
basis. In 1985, we contributed approximately $40 per capita,
which placed us 12th, behind countries such as Norway ($132 per
capita), France ($69 per capita), and Australia ($47 per capita).
Such an effort is clearly not in our own national interest.

Ecological information and environmental considerations
Such

, projects ought to be conducted and monitored in such a way as to
:add to the information base on which subsequent development plans

could be developed. For this reason, careful natural resource
evaluation ought to precede, accompany, and be maintained after
the completion of all major development schemes. Economically

 




 

 

valuable organisms should be sought actively and preserved. If
such efforts are coupled with the strengthening of institutions
in Third World countries, such as the leadership efforts of the
MacArthur Foundation in this direction, the outcomes are likely
to be positive and lasting. The adoption of environmental
guidelines by the World Bank in September, 1986, is a very
welcome step in the right direction.

The conservation of biological diversity should be a
component of every development scheme. An appropriate network of
parks and reserves must be created and supported internationally
on a continuing basis, and steps must also be taken to preserve
representative samples of groups of organisms of particular
actual or potential economic and scientific interest in zoos,
botanical gardens, seed banks, tissue culture centers, deep-
frozen, as cloned DNA, or in any way that is appropriate.

The detailed investigation of the ecosystems at certain‘
selected localities in the tropics, should be undertaken on an
urgent basis to provide a key to the fundtioning of the rest.
The outstanding centers operated by the Smithsonian Institution
at Barro Colorado Island in Panama and by the Organization for
Tropical Studies at La Selva in Costa Rica, or the rich fund of
information that has been developed at Serengetti in Tanzania,
provide good examples of this sort of effort.

The most single step that could be-taken to preserve the
remaining forests of the tropics would be to use lands that are
already deforested to produce timber, pulp, beef, and other
agricultural products. Virtually all of the food, timber, and
fuelwood needs of the tropics could be met by the intelligent use
of such lands. At the same time, intact forests could be managed
carefully to produce desired products and natural areas could be
set aside. Grass-roots conservation movements have sprung up in
many tropical countries, and should be encouraged fully.

The potential role of biotechnology in providing cheap,’
efficient ways to improve Third World crops, such as millet,
cassava, and yams, deserves special attention. Such improved
crops, combined with appropriate levels of chemical and
mechanical support, as well as economic and political reform,
could dramatically assist in the effort to make small farms
sustainable in the tropics. Such trends as the rise in world
consumption of fertilizer between 1950 and 1986 from 14 million
to 131 million tons, or in tractors from 5.6 million to 23
million, simply cannot be sustained on a global basis. Taken
together, however, the possibilities outlined above offer ample
hope for the future, if they are taken seriously and pursued with
v1gor.

A very promising new trend in the conservation of natural
areas concerns their better integration into the human systems of
their regions. Lands bordering the reserves may be occupied by
people and utilized in a way compatible with the long-range '
future of the reserve itself. The imaginative scheme developed
, by Daniel Janzen to develop 43G square-mile Guanacaste National
j Park in Costa Rica by rehabilitating several hundred hectares of
;degraded tropical deciduous forest breaks important ground in
vthis area. Portions of the park will be used for recreation,
farming, and other uses, and simply to remind Costa Ricans of the

j I

 

role of this ecosystem in their national history. This scheme
clearly provides a model of global importance for the
preservation of biological diversity in the tropics in a way
consistent with human values. *

Another kind of innovative plan is being considered by the
0.8. Congress, which would convert a fraction of the funds
distributed by U.S.-AID into loans, to be administered by such
agencies as UNICEF, the International Fund for Agricultural
Development, the Peace Corps to help rural, poor families to
become self-sufficient with small-scale health, agriculture, and
other projects. The individual borrowers, who must have an
income of $250 per year or less, would use the money to buy—
fertilizer, seed, and farming tools, and the funds would be
recycled in the countries to which they-were provided to keep the
system going. Such a plan would go a long way toward alleviating
some of the serious problems outlined here.

In more general terms, an awareness of and compassion for

fall life, and an appreciation of the fact that we are all part of

a living world that is capable, in its full development, of
capturing energy, originally from the sun, and making it
available for the life processes of living organisms, is the key
to an orderly management of the ecosystems that support us all.
We cannot avoid profoundly modifying the global biosphere, and in
fact have already done so; nevertheless, we should not allow
ourselves to respond only when the crises that we have caused are
so extensive that they threaten our lives. To do so is to be
thoroughly immoral in the fullest meaning of that term.

As His Holiness Tenzin Gyatso, The Fourteenth Dalai Lama,
put it in his message on World Environment Day, 5 June 1986,

"Peace and survival of life on Earth as we know it are
threatened by human activities which lack a commitment to
humanitarian values. Destruction of nature and natural resources
results from ignorance, greed, and lack of respect for the
Earth's living things. It is not difficult to forgive
destruction in the past which resulted from ignorance. Today,
however, we have access to more information, and it is essential
that we re-examine ethically what we have inherited, what we are
responsible for, and what we will pass on to coming
generations. .... Clearly this is a pivotal generation. .... Our
marvels of science and technology are matched if not outweighed
by many current tragedies, including human starvation in some
parts of the world, and extinction of other life forms. .... We
haVe the capability, and the responsibility. We must act before
it is too late." _

INTERNATIONAL DAMS
NEWSLETTER

BRAZIL: Itaparica Occupied

The fol lowing is a transcript of a British Broadcasting
Corporation story of December, 1986, on the occupation of the
ltaparica Dam site in Brazil.

Thousands of people in northeastern Brazil have been
mounting a protest against plans to build a hydroelectric dam
on the Sao Francisco River. The resulting (reservoir) will
deprive them of their homes and they say they've not been
promised adequate resettlement. Several hundred local people
have now taken their protest a stage further and invaded the dam
site near Petrolandia.

Eight hundred people, including entire families, moved into
the dam site on foot and in lorries. They took with them food
and water and tents, prepared to camp out there until the
authorites listen to their appeals. Over 100 police have now
been drafted into the dam area. The protestors have the support
of local trade and farmworkers unions and the local Catholic
Church. They decided to invade the dam site after failing to get
assurances from the hydroelectric company about resettlement
of the 700 families who will be left homeless when the dam
gates finally close and the (reservoir) fills in eleven months'
time. The (reservoir) will cover three towns and dozens of
villages in an area of 500 square miles.

The World Bank is ﬁnancing the hydroelectric project and
has put up money for resettlement, but so far the families claim
they have only been offered arid, unsuitable land. The company
is also proposing areas of up to 250 miles away from the dam
site, whereas the people Want to stay as near as possible to their
original homes.

The protestors say they intend to stay at the dam site and, if
necessary, interrupt work on the dam, unless the Minister of
Mines and Energy comes to talk to them. They also sent a
letter to the World Bank President, who is now visiting Brazil,
alleging that the hydroelectric company lied about the families'
acceptance of unsuitable areas in order to guarantee ﬁnancing for
the dam.

alt * *

IDN has recently learned that the demands of the Itacuruba and
'Petrolandia rural unions have been largely met in a revised
Itaparica resettlement plan. This plan has been approved by
Presidential decree, thereby ensuring that the basic requirements
of the proposals put forward by the rural upions will be
met These include increased overall size of the resettlement
area, increased individual plot size, guaranteed land tenure
security, and no closure of the dam gates until all resettlement
requirements have been met.

Dams and War in Korea

The South Korean government has charged that a dam under
construction in North Korea could break accidentally -- or be
breached intentionally -- and thereby devastate half of the
South's population downstream.

The Diamond Mountain Power Station is to be located on the
North Han River, just above the demilitarized zone which has
divided the two countries since the end of the Korean War.
Construction of the dam is thought to have begun last October,
and the government of North Korea considers the project to be
of "glorious revolutionary dimensions."

The South Korean government considers the dam to be of
very dangerous dimensions, estimating that it will need to be
650 feet high to meet the specifications mentioned in North
Korean news reports. On a dam of this size, a release or failure
of only ﬁve percent of the reservoir's capacity would threaten to
break or overtop five South Korean dams downstream. The
South charges that total failure of a filled 650 foot dam would
destroy its heavily industrialized Han River Valley and capital
city of Seoul, putting the most populous part of the country
under water. The South claims failure of the dam could be
timed to coincide with a military invasion from the North.

At the least, the South says, the Diamond Mt. project would
decrease the ﬂow of the Han River, which is important for
Southern industry, agriculture and hydroelectric power.

The North counters that the project will beneﬁt the South by
providing upstream ﬂood control, and calls the idea of dam as
weapon "foolish rubbish." continued on back page

‘Big Dams and Acts of War.-

Two news items in this issue of IDN illustrate the way in
which big dams can destabilize a province or a country, or even
lead to open conﬂict between two nations. When the two
nations are on opposite sides of today's Cold War -- as is the
case where NOrth Korea is building ‘a'dam upstream of South
Korea's capital city -- global security can be put at risk.

Massive dispossession caused by a big dam can add fuel to
political unrest, as is the case in Northeast Brazil at the
Itaparica Dam site. There are other examples as well: the
Farraka Barrage diversions caused near-hostility between
Bangladesh and Pakistan; more recently, the construction of the
Ataturk Dam in Turkey has been perceived by Syria as a threat
to its national security because the dam will divert the
Euphrates River. , '

To a cynical observer none of this should be particularly
surprising. After-all, water is a valuable resource, and any
strong country will be likely to grab it from a weak country,
given half a chance. The U.S. led the way in the 1930's when
it built the Hoover Dam on the Colorado River and effectively
destroyed the Mexican ﬁshing industry downstream.

What is surprising is the naivete of the engineers and
economists who promote big dams. The risk that war will
disrupt their projects is not censidered in their planning -- even
when the risk is aggravated, or even created, by the dam itself.

Examples of multibillion dollar development projects that
have been destroyed or disrupted by war abound: Cabora Bassa
in Mozambique, the Sudd Project in the Sudan, the Chico Dam
in the Philippines, Canon Grande in El Salvador. Yet
organizations like the World Bank persist in funding such
projects, innocently and short-sightedly assuming that their

. operation will be uninterrupted and that debtor countries will
pay back their loans. In their economic analysis, the World
Bank and the InterAmerican Development Bank would have us
believe that nothing will ever disrupt the US$15 billion Itaipu
Dam, even though half of the scheme is in Paraguay, a country

World Bank Supplies Water to South Africa r ' '

At a time when most Western nations are withdrawing their
investments from South Africa, the World Bank has devised a
way of aiding South African industry through a $48 million
loan to the small African nation of Lesotho. The money will

. help fund a hydropower installation to be incorporated into a
. system of tunnels destined to divert the ﬂow of water out of the
Lesotho highlands to major urban areas of South Africa.

The project is designed to dam the upper reaches of the
Orange River, which runs southwest out of Lesotho through
South Africa and Namibia to the Atlantic. The water will be
transferred through tunnels to the Val River system in the
north.

South African project representative Hans Pettenburger said
that without the diversion of water from Lesotho, "The South
African industrial heartland would face a severe water shortage
by the mid-1990's." .

So severe, in fact, that many in Lesotho suspect that South
Africa may have gone as far as engineering the January coup to
oust former Prime Minister, Chief Jonathon. Jonathon had
refused to concede control of the sluice-gates and for that he
may have paid the ultimate political price.

Under the terms of the post-Jonathon treaty, Lesotho is not
permitted to "turn off the tap." Even during extreme drought,
water will flow out of Lesotho at a fixed rate and at a fixed
price. Lesotho, then, will have no control over its only major
natural resource.

Nevertheless, this is a good business investment for the
World Bank which will receive part of the $20 million in
royalties for water delivery in the first year of operation. Many
fear, however, that Lesotho's chronically limited planning
capacity will be a constraint on any economic advantages to be
derived from this water scheme.

Despite Lesotho's huge labor reserves, the project was
planned to be capital-intensive rather than labor-intensive
because South Africa needs Lesotho's labor reserves in its
mines. —Marisa Gaines

KENYA: Norway Out of Turkwell

IDN has received word that Norwegian aid authorities -- who
were previously considering funding the Turkwell Dam -- have
rejected the project. Norway reportedly was unhappy with the
negative impacts that the project will have on downstream
residents.

The reservoir could take as long as three years to fill, because
the river runs seaonally. While it is ﬁlling, people downstream
will be deprived of traditional water supplies. Latest reports
now have France funding the Turkwell Damon terms that place
Kenya at the mercy of ﬂuctuating exchange rates and which
could be a problem for the country in the future.

Colombian Marchers
Win Concessions

Five thousand miners and farmers recently marched 80 km to DIOtGSt

reservoir-related problems at the Salvajina Dam near Cauca,
Colombia. Following the protest, the Colombian government
has agreed to a program of upstream improvements.

The ﬁlling of the Salvajina reservoir in 1984 ﬂooded valuable
agricultural lands and goldmines. Disease-spreading mosquitos
now breed in swamps along the reservoir shore. Those
upstream of the Salvajina Dam complain that all of the beneﬁts
-- ﬂood control, irrigation and electricity -- ﬂow downstream.

t The protestors accuse the govemrnentof inadequate long-term
planning, and Say that 10,000 people have been hurt directly by .
the dam, and 30,000 more indirectly. No tree-cutting was done ‘
before the reservoir was ﬁlled, resulting in contaminated water
with a constant unpleasant smell and a high enough acid
content to corrode turbines at the dam's powerhouse.

The program of improvements required to remedy these .
problems may take as long as ten years to complete, but the ‘

. concessions won by the protesters could have a valuable impact

on the planning of Colombian hydro projects in the future.

EcologistsPressure.World Bank

Loans by international development banks for environmentally
destructive projects are facing more and more criticism in the
United States. It is no longer a matter of a few
enviromentalists raising the alarm. Editorials in major
newspapers have begun to criticize the banks' apparent
indifference to the environmental effects of their loans. Even the
Reagan administration, which appointed the inimitable James '
Watt to be Secretary of Interior when it ﬁrst came into power
six years ago, is now pressing the banks to incorporate
environmental concerns into their planning.

Last November, Science, a leading scientiﬁc weekly in the
U.S., canied a/major article by John Walsh entitled entitled
"World Bank Pressed on Environmental Reforms." Walsh
gives a prominent place to the counter-meeting by the Citizens'

‘ " Conference on Tropical Forests, Indigenous People, and the

World Bank, held across the street from the World Bank during
its annual meeting in October. (See IDN vol. 1, no. 6).

The Conference called on governments and private investors
to stop funding development banks that do not halt ﬁnancing of
such projects as Three Gorges and the Narmada Valley scheme

Rainiorest Conference a Success

Every continent with tropical rainforests has experienced
considerable deforestation in this century, with the majority of - .
the devastation occuring in the last 20 to 30 years. While the
destruCtion accelerates at an alarming rate, rainforest
preservation advocates held a conference to seek strategies to
halt the destruction. Sahabat Alam Malaysia (SAM, Friends of
the Earth Malaysia) sponsored the Conference on Forest
Resource Crisis in the Third World in Penang, Malaysia
September 6-8, 1986.

The conference brought together concerned parties from 23
countries, including Bangladesh, Pakistan, India, Thailand, the
Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Borneo, the U.S., the U.K.,
and Australia.

A Food and Agriculture Organimtion (FAO) study in 1980
projeCted thatat the present rate, Indonesia would lose 10% of ' its
remaining forests by the year 2000, the Philippines would lose

. ~ 20%, Malaysia 24%, and Thailand 60%. In Africa, Nigeria and

- the Ivory Coast will be completely deforested by 2000, and
Guinea and Madagascar will lose approximately one third of
their remaining forests. In Latin America, Costa Rica would lose
80%, Nicaragua, Honduras and Ecuador more than half, and
Guatemala, Colombia and Mexico would lose one third of their
remaining forest by 2000.

Country reports by Third World participants in the conference
revealed the progression of the rainforest destruction predicted in
the FAO study and some of the serious effects experienced as a
result. Severe soil erosion, both in the deforested areas and in
adjacent agricultural regions, contributes to excessive silting of
river systems. This causes ﬂooding. In some areas, the
destruction of watersheds has brought persistent droughts.
Deforestation proﬁts are channeled to the industrialized
consumer nations which control the timber trade.

Third World countries are hurt by this in several ways. The
indigenous tribal groups who depend on the rainforest for their
way of life'are losing both their livelihood and the mm
of their culture. Ironically, they may be blamed for Eutha-
deforestation, as shifting cultivatms. it was pointed on M
the shifting cultivators are in many cases 'shifted whims,"
page 4

who had already been relocated because the lands they had
traditionally used were taken over for dam construction or. -
reservoir ﬂooding, timber export, planted for cash crop
monoculture, or converted to grazing land to feed cattle for
export to fast-food chains. .

Since the deforestation is not in anything approaching a
sustainable manner there can be grave consequences to
employment and development prospects. In Malaysia, where
nearly 100,000 people were employed by the forestry and
timber industries in 1983,there has been a 23% decrease in
employment in only two years. Thailand, once an exporter of
valuable tropical hardwoods, has so exploited its irreplaceable
rainforests that it now must import wood.

Conference particpants exchanged strategies for changing the
current course of worldwide destruction of rainforests. There
were several emphases. One is to alert the governments and
developers of the disastrous ecological consequences of both the
destruction of the rainforests themselves and of the proleC's
instituted in their place , such as large dams and mines. Another?
rs to seek sustainable development efforts in the Third World
that would not destroy the livelihood and culture of indigenous
Peoples, while channeling the majority of the proﬁts to 319031 ,
ehte and/or transnational corporations. Another emphasis rs on;

Volta Does Not Measure Up

Volta Dam was intended to bring prosperity to the people and industries of Ghana.
Kaiser Aluminum and Reynolds Metals formed a joint smelting operation (VALCO) that
was to be run with the electricity generated by the Volta project. VALCO hoped to be
helpful in procuring a loan from the World Bank for approximately 40% of the cost of
constructing the dam. They were given a substantial electricity price discount for a thirty
year period, which as of 1976 was still below the cost of generating the electricity and
considerably below world standard. Since VALCO is contracted to purchase 60% of the
e total electricity produced by the Volta project, it has never been pro Itable. Repaying the

World Bank loan has caused a severe drain on the Ghanaian economy, particularly it's
foreign exchange costs. Because the anticipated proﬁts never materialized, subsequent
projects, such as a massive irrigation scheme for the Accra Plains south of the dam, have

3P

been dropped.
'1! Eighty thousand people were displaced by the dam and reservoir, which covers 5% of the
.; country. Of those 80,000, only 2,000 were employed by the VALCO smelting operation,
:j approximately 10,000 were able to work in the new fishing industry created by the

reservoir, and the rest experienced the most severe effects of the displacement : loss of their
I land, livelihood, and traditional way of life. Additionally, Ghana has been experiencing a

’ severe drought, with below average rainfall for over ten years, and the level of water in the
reservoir has fallen so 10w that severe cutbacks in power productiOn were necessary.
Experts now believe that the climate of West Africa may be changing to such a degree that
water resources should not be considered a reliable long term power source.

NGO PROFILE

Switzerland's
Declaration of Berne

IDN has recently been in contact with a group in Switzerland,
the Declaration of Beme. The DOB was founded in 1968 and
today has over 8,000 members. They characterize their basic
philos0phy in two phrases: "It is more important to takeless
than to give more (to Third World countries)? and "Think
globally, act locally."

From its headquarters in Zurich, and from branches in the
French and Italian areas of Switzerland, the DOB concentrates
on raising public consciousness inside of Switzerland. TheDOB
seeks to publicize the Third World activities of the Swiss
government, businesses, and banks.

Recently, the DOB has focused its attention on Swiss
involvement in several South American hydro projects. It is
especially interested in the activities of Swiss consulting ﬁrms
working in Guatemala on the Chixoy scheme. The DOB fears
that the firm involved may be the same Swiss ﬁrm that "faced
problems" in Argentina in the seventies.

Currently, a second project of the DOB's is the El Cajon
Dam in Honduras, which is getting support from the Swiss
government and commercial banks. To spread the word on
Swiss involvement in El Cajon, the DOB has published a
detailed brochure titled "Mixed Loans and Misdevelopment."
The publication is aimed at informing the Swiss parliament of
the drawbacks of the El Cajon credit and exposing the loan
evaluations done by the Swiss government, which were kept
"super-positve in order not to provoke skepticism." Much of
the loan money would come back to Swiss firms, which are
contracted to provide turbines and electromechanical equipment
for the dam.

In 1985 the DOB also published a book titled "Giant Swiss
Powerplants in the Third World." Both publlications are
available from the DOB.

Zurcher, Zurlindenstr. 214, 8003 Zurich,

China Reevaluates Three Gorges

Plans to incorporate the proposed Three Gorges Dam into
China's next ﬁve year plan have once again foundered. The
unresolved issues are the same as they were when the decision
to build the dam was made in 1958: the depth of the reservoir
behind the darn during the low-water season, continuing
technological and environmental uncertainties, and the cost and
ﬁnancing of the project -- variously estimated at $12-$20
billion.

Huge cost overruns on construction of the Gezhouba Dam
downstream have added tension to the debate over the Three
Gorges project. Those in charge of producing electricity worry
about the dam's long lead time (10 years until initial power
production, 17 years until it comes fully on line), and about the
potential ﬂuctuations in electric power production that can
result from adjusting the water ﬂow primarily to achieve ﬂood
control objectives.

Every interest group has something to gain and something to
lose if Three Gorges is built. Shanghai needs electricity for
industry, but: worries about the dam's effect on the marine
biology of the Yangtse estuary. Sichuan Province (where
Three Gorges is located), wants electricity now but would like
to minimize the problem of displaced residents. It therefore
prefers to build small dams on the Yangtse tributaries «in
Sichuan first (these would be necessary even if the Three
Gorges dam were built). For Sichuan, smaller dams will
provide more electricity and greater ﬂood control, and will do
both more quickly.

The overseas edition of the People ’s Daily reported in July,
1986, that China's leadership has called for new studies of key
questions involving the controversial project. The new studies
will analyze costs and benefits in such areas as geological
structure, earthquake danger, siltation, water ﬂow, navigation,
investment value, and the disruption of people's lives. The new
feasibility study team will present its recommendations by late
March 1987. .

Many observers believe that a decision on whether to proceed
with construction will likely reﬂect the overall state of the
economy at that time. The Three Gorges dam will be the most
expensive investment project ever undertaken in China, tying
up capital for at least a decade before it begins to generate
revenue from electric power production.

The dam's potential costs are rising rapidly, due to a
combination of domestic inﬂation, devaluation of the yuan
internationally, and increasing wealth of the peasants who will
have to be compensated if the dam is built.

The stark economic trade-offs and ongoing technical
uncertainties surrounding the dam have created strong and
enduring constituencies, ensuring that the Three Gorges dam,
for years to come, will be a part of the political landscape, if
not the physical landscape. -Marisa Gaines

India: Narmada on Hold

IDN has received word that the Sardar Sarovar project (half of
the huge Narmada Valley development scheme) has been held
up because the Federal Department of Forestry has not yet
released the forest lands that will be ﬂooded. Under the terms of
the Forestry Act, any forest lands cut or submerged must be
compensated for by reafforestation elsewhere in the country. As
yet, there is no comprehensive reafforestation program for
Narmada.

International environmental and human rights groups are
taking advantage of the present delay and are petitioning the
World Bank and governments contributing to the project in an
attempt to ensure the rights of those to be displaced. Survival
International and several other groups have ' ten a report
detailing the possible violations of intemation law posed by
the Sardar Sarovar resettlement plans.

There are five points of law in question: 1) "Compensation
with land is offered only to the few oustees who have legal title
to their lands." 2) "None of the oustees will be compensated
for the loss of woodlands and waters that they have traditionally
occupied and used." 3) "Those who are offered lands...are liable
to be settled in a piecemeal and scattered manner." 4)

4) "Unsatisfactory provisions exist to ensure the relocation of the
peoples in social units of their choice. " 5) "There appear to be
no legal provisions to ensure that the tribal people will be
resettled in environments similar to those from which they have
been displaced."

President of the World Bank for Asia, has been suggesting that
India must loosen its environmental restrictions in order to get

According to Walsh, the demand to cut funds has set off a

have put these lower proﬁle organizations on the defensive.

Third World Needs
Scaled-Down Hydro

A World Watch Paper published in the October 1986 issue of
International Water Power and Dams Construction takes a look
at trends in Third World hydro development and predicts trouble
for large-scale hydro projects, endorsinga move towards small
hydro power development.

The paper, by C. Flavin, states some familiar facts. Energy
consumption is expanding in the Third World at such a rate as
to make complete dependence on expensive fossil fuels
impossible. Many Third World countries have abundant
hydropower potential, a very small percentage of which has
been tapped. It comes as no surprise that the World Bank
expects Third World hydro capacity (excluding China) to grow
from 100,000 MW in 1980 to 201,000 MW by 1990.

Flavin, nevertheless, does not see massive hydro projects as
the savior of the Third World. In a short preface he says that
"Many Third World utilities are so deeply in debt that
international bail-outs may be necessary to stave off
bankruptcy." Large dam projects ("some of the largest and
most expensive civil works projects in history") will be affected
by this climate.

Elavin goes on to point out the "substantial" environmental
and human costs of large hydro projects: problems of ﬂooded
agricultural lands and the trapping of nutrient-laden silt. Flavin
says, "The visions of power planners are now often in direct .
conﬂict with the needs of indigenous people." He cites the
Kariba, Chico, and Three Gorges projects as examples.

Small-scale hydro projects may be the answer to at least one
Third World problem -- that of rural electriﬁcation. 1.7 billion
in the Third World do not have access to elecricity. Power
ﬂows to the cities and does not reach those who live in areas
not accessible to easy grid extension. Flavin says small,
decentralized power projects are the answer, and he describes
hydropower as the "most mature small power alternative."

Small hydropower projects can be built quickly, which means
that they can meet actual needs rather than rely on forecasts.
Further, they are comparatively low-tech, so most parts can be
built locally. (In fact, Flavin says one stumbling block in
small hydropower development has been over—design by
westem-trained engineers resulting in higher costs.) Small-
scale industries that supply materials such as pipes to small
hydro projects have started up all over the Third World. Nepal,
Pakistan, India and Zaire are noted for their successful small
hydropower experiments, both internationally and privately
ftmded.

One of the most interesting aspects of the World Watch Paper
is the fact that it was published in the dam-builders' trade
magazine International Water Power and Dams Construction.
Will the big time engineering ﬁrms that subscribe to this
magazine start building small-scale, low-tech projects to beneﬁt
the mral poor? Not tomorrow, but if their own magazine can
help in spreading a new awareness about the costs of and
alternatives to large hydro projects, there is hope.

World Bank Lobby Week

The Environmental Policy Institute and American Rivers
Conservation Council will sponsor the twelfth National
Conference on Rivers, Dams, and Water Policy in Washington
DC, USA, April 3-5, 1987. This year's focus will be on
Instream Rights -- the laws of most U.S. states give water
rights only to those who take water out of the river and few
laws allow the water of rivers to be protected within the river's
channel. -

A special section of the conference will focus on citizens‘
efforts to work with and lobby the World Bank and other
Multilateral Development Banks. Those interested in Bank-
sponsored large water projects should attend this conference.
During the following week, many of the conference participants
will participate in a lobbying campaign directed at the World

Endangered Flivers and the
Conservation Movement, by

Tim Palmer

Dams have been built since early in the history of the United
States, and now they block tens of thousands of streams. A
darn propo’sal sparked the ﬁrst great conservation battle in the
U.S.: John Muir's campaign to save the Hetch Hetchy Valley
in Yosemite Park from its eventual fate as a reservoir. Since
then, people have fought to preseve free-ﬂowing ﬁvers ﬁom
Alaska to Florida.

In his book, Endangered Rivers and the Conservation
Movement, Tim Palmer traces the growth of the movement to
save rivers and the development of a national consciousness that
values rivers for wildlife, farms, ﬁsheries, parks, wilderness,
recreation, and as refuges from the urban world.

Endangered Rivers is not only a history, it also includes
chapters on modern water policy debates, alternatives to
destructive dams and a survey of rivers that are threatened in the
1980's and beyond.

Nevertheless, South Korea plans to build a US$1 billion - )1 )‘x..\,,§‘
"peace dam" complex several miles downstream capable of J '
containing any ﬂows from the new project in the North. The 1...,” NORTH
South's dam will also top 650 feet, but apparently will be left
empty year round. In the event of a break at Diamond
Mountain, the South's dam would deﬂect water back northward.
to ﬂood wide lowland areas of North Korea.

Further, South Korea's defense minister warned recently that
the South "would be compelled to take self-defense measures
before the threat becomes a reality." (Military analysts recall

DEDICATION

This issue of the International Dams Newsletter is
dedicated to the 800 families of the Petrolandia and
Itacuruba rural unions who occupied the World Bank-
financed Itaparica Dam site on the Sao Francisco
River in Northeast Brazil. Their occupation raised
such worldwide support among people and policy
makers in Brazil and at the World Bank that officials
of the Sao Francisco Hydroelectric Company agreed
to direct negotiations for improved resettlement of
these and many other families displaced by the dam.

Atmospheric Administration and now

also scheduled to testify.

Background: Of the many
federal laws that affect ocean and coastal

:. activities, three are generally considered

to have the biggest impact on federal
and state coastal management activities.
Hollings was a principal sponsor of

.the 1972 Coastal Zone Management

Act, the first federal law designed to

voluntarily develop and implement
coastal management plans meeting
certain minimum federal standards. The
law provided two main incentives to
states: grants to help deve10p and
implement coastal management plans,
and a requirement for all future federal
activities to be c0nsistent with state
plans.

 

l
s

In exchange, states would formulate ‘

plans to maximize protection of natural
resources and manage development in
order to minimize potential loss of life
and property, among other requirements.

State plans under the act often
include storm evacuation plans, erosion
control measures and wetlands
protection plans.

In the years since the law was
passed, 29 of 35 eligible states have
implemented federally approved CZM
plans _

In 1982, Congress passed the
Coastal Barrier, Resources Act, which

..eliminated federal insurance -and

subsidies for development on certain
barrier islands, thus removing incentives
for developing wetlands and other vital
habitats in these areas.

The 1968 National Flood Insurance ‘
Act was passed to provide federally
subsidized low-cost insurance to
communities that institute ﬂood-plain
management plans. .

Environmentalists say the coastal

zone management and coastal barriers

laws have generally promoted better
development and management practices
in coastal areas. j

But the insurance act has undone ._
much of the good that the other acts
have provided, environmentalists say,
because community ﬂood management ,
plans are rarely implemented or ,
enforced. The result is that federal
insurance continues to go to developers
who build in high-risk and fragile
coastal areas, further degrading coastal
environments and costing taxpayers
millions of dollars.

Hollings wants to investigate each ‘
of these laws individually, according to
staff, plus their combined effect on f
coastal development, management and ,
conservation.

hacking whales

 

The song that comes out of the sea

By Christopher Swan

Staff writer of The Christian Science Monitor

 

Lincoln, Mass.
OGER PAYNE turns on a tape re-
corder, and the song of the humpback
whale echoes off the high windows of
his 19th-century farmhouse.

“When you get next to a whale, you are
completely awed by it,” he says. “It reminds
you in a beautiful way of where you stand,
that you’re not really the star of the show,
you’re just another pretty face. Whales have

[that] kind of power over our imaginations.”

Whales have long exercised this singular
power over Dr. Payne’s imagination. From the
day in 1967 when he sat in a pitching, noisy
boat and ﬁrst heard their cries, he has been
following them, listening to them, and lobby-
ing for their continued existence.

In the process he has accumulated an im-
pressive body of hard knowledge about
whales, especially humpbacks, the singers of
long, complex songs.

Roger Payne: ‘The ocean is a noisy place toexplore the complex songs of the I

THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR

Payne has studied the songs of whales
probably as much as any person on earth,
logging thousands of hours of tapes in the
process. He contributed whale songs to
“Star Trek IV," a movie that fancifully
attributes powers of intelligent communi-
cation to humpbacks. But he ﬁnds himself
too fascinated with questions to get very
caught up in speculative answers.

“Whether or not whales are — in our
convoluted, human, slightly Simian way
of thinking —- conscious of [what they
communicate] is almost irrelevant.”

What is highly relevant to the bearded
neurophysiologist in worn sneakers and a
tweed jacket is the mystery of just what
manner and shape the thoughts of whales
assume.

“What are the thoughts like that go
through the brains of whales?” he asks
rhetorically. “I really think that’s the
most fascinating question in biology to-
day. All of this speculation about what
the brain is used for, whether they are
super-intelligent, is just that: pure specu-

'_u.

lation. I welcome that sort of speculation
but it’s just guessing. The guesses are
pretty dull, I suspect, compared to the
reality.”

This reality is something he and sev-
eral assistants at his Long '1an Research
Institute here in the barns behind his
farmhouse grape for, while sifting
through spectrograph renderings of
whale songs, comparing them with logs of
recordings and their own knowledge of
cetacean behavior. It is a game of inches,
in which the researchers look for small

increments of knowledge rather than
some dramatic breakthrough to meaning.

“It’s all edges,” he says of the tearn’s
ﬁndings. “It’s all indications.

“What you ﬁnd out is such things as,
‘Oh, well, I’ll be darned, the song isof this
much greater complexity. The ways the
whale is manipulating it are such and
such,’ ” he says. This approach has led to
discoveries such as the one by his former
wife, Katy Payne, that whales gradually
evolve the patterns of their songs over
the years, and that whales in diﬂ’erent
breeding grounds sing different songs.

“If they sing the same song, you know
they have been in acoustic contact very

recently,” he explains.

Payne ﬁnds his way to such observa-
tions by following a subject that surfaces
to be studied only 5 percent of the time;
that communicates through a medium —
underwater sound — that poses consider-
able technical challenges to the listener.

There are places in the ocean, for in-
stance, where the echo of a whale song is
louder than the source; where you can

._ hear the sound at intervals of 35 miles but
not in between; where deep sound chan-
nels act at an acoustic lens and probably
enable blue whales to hear each other

f across oceans.

“The ocean is a noisy place,” he ob—

' serves, adding that ﬁsh, seals, and boats
_ all create a busy sonar background.

Such problems in sound, and the way

. creatures manipulate it to survive and

communicate, have been a lifetime preoc-
cupation of Payne, an amateur cellist,
who began his scientiﬁc career studying
bats, moved on to owls, and then gradu-
ated from moths to whales — always

drawn to phenomena like echolocatiOn
and other forms of sound manipulation.

The turn to whales began on that boa
where he ﬁrst heard a tape recording of
their cries, well before anyone had imag
ined that whales were singing. The boat
was ﬁlled with all sorts of machinery am
noise, he recalls. But out of this mechan
cal cacophony “came these extraordinarj
sounds. I couldn’t believe it.”

He was so smitten that he borrowed a
10-minute snatch of tape and listened un-
til he had all but memorized the sounds —
a process that led to the discovery that
the whales were actually singing, when
he sat, a year later, in a small rowboat
directly over a humpback, hearing its low
rumbles and high, plaintive cries resonate
through the bottom of the boat.

Suddenly, he realized he was listening
to the same basic pattern of sounds he
had memorized from the tape.

“Supposing you were listening to radio
emissions from outer space, and you sud-
denly discovered some were coming in the
form of a repeated sequence, like a song. ”
That’s the experience he had in that boat.
He felt as though a fellow being had
nudged up against him, announcing its
presence as clearly and emphatically as a
phone call in the middle of the night.

That was 20 years ago, and Payne still
hasn’t a clue as to what those songs mean:
“We can make some general observations,
but you can make exactly the same obser-
vations about the cricket.” And anyway,

discovering the “meaning” of the songs
may not be the issue.

“We can be musicologists of whales
without understanding what the message
[of their songs] is about,” he says. “After
all, you don’t really have to put into
words what message music brin' gs to
you.” And, without question, whale songs
bring much to the average person, he
says. “I’ve played whale songs to hun-
dreds of people, and some people weep,
they are so moved by them.”

Over the years, he has helped musi-
cians try to meld whale songs with music.

Alan Hovhannes, for instance. He has just
completed a record with Paul Winter, an
avant-garde musician. which attempts to

S eals and sealing 1'12 Cana
Government’s response .
to major recommendatIons

of Royal Commission

OTTAWA -— The Minister of
Fisheries and Oceans, the
Honorable Tom Siddon, announc-
ed recently the government’s
response to the major recommen-
dations of the Royal Commission
on Seals and the Sealing Industrv
in Canada.

In discussing the commission’s
recommendation for very sustan—
tial financial assistance for Inuit
hunters and commercial sealers,
the minister said: “Helping the
sealing community to chart its
own future, with the aid of the
report’s analysis and recommen—
dations, must be the government‘s
first priority.

“I am therefore announcing a
contribution of $150,000 from my
department’s budget to the Cana-
dian Sealers’ Association (CSA)
and a contribution of $100,000 from
the Department of Indian Affairs
and Northern Development to the
Inuit Tapirisat of Canada, for the
development of a strategy for the
east coast sealing industry and the
northern native seal-hunting com—
munties respectively. Part of the
associations’ reports should in-
clude their recommendations to
the government on how federal
programs, as well as sucl

measures as federal procurement,
could be deployed to serve the
needs and aspirations of the native
and non—native sealing
communities.

“I am also announcing a
' specific allocation of federal fun—
ding to address the special needs
of sealers and to increase the op-
portunities available to them in
sealing and non-sealing activity.
Five million dollars has been ear-
marked over the next four years
in the budgets of the governmeni ’s
labor adjustment, marketing a id
industrial development assistai. 3e
programs. These programs of 1 ie
government include the Industri 2‘:
and Regional Development Pro-

gram (IRDP), the Special
Agriculture and Rural Develop-
ment Program ( SARDA), the Pro—
gram for Export Market Develop-
ment (PEMD) and the Canadian
Jobs Strategy..” Of this total, $1
million will be provided by the
Department of Fisheries and
Oceans; this latter amount in-
cludes the $150,000 contribution to
the CSA.

“Upon receipt of the CSA’s
report, I will be consulting my
Parliamentary collegues from
Atlantic Canada as to the use to
which these funds will be put."

“A senior governmental official,
Dr. Duncan Campbell, has been
appointed within DFO to co-
ordinate the implementation of the
government’s response to the
Malouf Commission. As one of his
first responsibilities, Dr. Camp-
bell will- help the associations
develop their strategies; once
these strategies have been receiv-
ed, he will work on the final alloca-
tion of the earmarked funds with
the associations and the responsi-
ble departments.”

“1 should note that currgm
government programs are
already working to support job
creation and economic develop-
ment in these communities. The
federal government is also pro-
viding assistance, especially to
native people, to develop new
markets and products from older
seals, consistent with the Royal
Commission’s recommendations.
For example, joint support is be-
ing provided by the Department of
Indian Affairs and Northern
Development and the Government
of the Northwest Territories to
Nunasi Corporation in 1986-87 for
the deveIOpment of seal product
markets. Of course, sealers and
the sealing communities remain
eligible for these and all other
federal programs of general ap-
plication.”

The minister also noted the
Royal Commission’s finding that
sealing is a legitimate activity
which should proceed with ap-
propriate management controls.
In particular, the minister cited
the commission’s conclusion that
sealing in Canada has generally
satisfied the following imporant
conditions: _a,_mrye_s_tjng_system
mtg humane [[13an
andsnildanimals; no significant
risks to any seal stocks under re-
cent. regulatory framwork; in—
come from sealing of considerable
importance to peoples living in
conditions of limited economic op—
portunities; little or no waste of
any usable seal product. '

Mr. Siddon said that these fin-
dings of the Commission should of-
fer reassurance to members of the
public who have been concerned
about the hunt. The minister also
highlighted the Commission’s fin-
ding that sealing provides major
social, cultural and nutritional
benefits to many communities,
especially northern native
communities.

In commenting on the Royal
Commission’s recommendation
that the commercial hunting of

whitecoat and blueback seal pups .

not be permitted, the minister
noted that market conditions over
the past several years have
already ended this hunt. “There
has been virtually no commercial
hunt for whitecoasts (harp seal
pups) and bluebacks (hooded seal
pups) for the last three years,”
Mr. Siddon stated. “There ap-
pears to be no need at this time for
the government to end formally
the commercial hunt of these
pups, since the market has resolv-
ed the situation. Consistent with
the report’s findings, however, the
government’s assistance to the
sealing industry will not support a
revival of the whitecoast and
blueback seal pup hunt.”

The Royal Commission also
found that the population of grey
seals, a species not part of the
traditional seal hunt, is increasing
rapidly and is causing damage to
the fishing industry of between $60 '
million and $115 million annually.
The commission recommended
that substantial advantages would
be gained by a cull of grey seals
and indicated that a decision on
the cull needs to be taken as soon

as possible — taking into account
the views of interested parties.
Mr. Siddon stated that the govern-
ment will follow this recommen-
dation and begin its consultations
with interested parties. '

The minister concluded that,
because the report and its recom-
mendations are complex, further
analysis and consultations are re-
quired in order to develop a long-
term overall Canadian policy on
seals. “1 have asked my officials,
considering the report and its
recommendations, to take into ac-
count the views provided by pro-
vincial governments, the Govern-
ment of the Northwest Territories,
interested parties and advisory
bodies,” the minister said.

Commission on Seals and the Seal-
ing Industry in Canada can be pur-

ment Publishing Centre, Depart-
ment of Supply and Services, 45

Sealers must have pelt
subsidy says Carter

In order for an economically
viableseaLfishery to take place off
the east coast of Newfoundland
this year the federal government
will have to provide a financial in-
centive which will boost the
amount received by fishermen for
pelts. '

This is the only way that He
local sealing industry will be able
to hang on for this season, and
start building for the future, ac-
cording to Twillingate MHA
Walter Carter.

The request for a subsidy on
pelts has already been made in a
telex Sent to federal fisheries
minister Tom Siddon last week by
Carter, on behalf of provincial
Liberal leader Leo Barry.

The, text of the telex is as
follows: '

“In light of the Malouf Royal
Commission’s recommendation
that substantial Federal Govern-
ment assistance be made

“In order to make that happen
and for the hunt to be economical-
ly viable, it appears that a Federal
Government subsidy is necessary.
The private sector has indicated
that it will buy all available pelts
for an amount that, in my view is
somewhat less than the fishermen
will require to make the hunt
worth while.

“The cost to the federal
treasury of providing such a sub—
sidy is a mere pittance compared
ot the overall benefit to be deriv-
ed by the restoration of our once-
great and potentially viable seal-
ing industry.

“I urge you therefore, on behalf
of the thousands of Newfound-
landers that will benefit from a
seal hunt and for the sake of our
national pride, that the necessary
action be taken to ensure that a
profitable 1987 seal harvest takes
place.”

Commenting this week, Carter
said that the Carino Co. is willing

guarantee a reinstatement of the

hunt. The $240,000 figure is based

on a, projected landsmen kilj_g_f_
000 se .

He said the Malouf commission
recommended that. $100 million be
spent on the east coast sealing in-
dustry, however the federal
government has only indicated
that $150,000 will be provided this
year.

The MHA added that Newfound-
land cabinet representative John
Crosbie should have seized the op—
portunity provided by the commis-
sion report to make a strong case
for more federal financial support.

He said the response Ottawa has
given to the Malouf report so far
amounts to little more than a re—

jection, and he questioned why
therehas been no comment on the
issue for some time from Morrisey
Johnson, MP, whom Carter
described as a “former champion
of the seal hunt.”

Carter said it is not unusual for
Ottawa to provide substantial sub—
sidies to other Canadian industries .
when they hit hard economic
times, and he wonders why the
Newfoundland seal fishery should
be treated any differently.

The MHA emphasized that the
average contribution to the
economy from sealing in the past
from a single small boatman has
been $3,000. This, he added, coupl-
ed with the spinoff to local
economies, shows just how impor-
tant the sealing industry is, not to
mention the boost it gives to
fishermen trying to get a start on
the regular fishery at the beginn-
ing of the year.

itoyal Commission suggests
phasing out netting of seals

The federal department of
fisheries and oceans hasn‘t
indicated whether or not it
ivill adopt a recommendation
that the netting .Uf.-§_.9§l-S-_li)9
phased out as rapidly as
possible.

The recommendation, con-
tained in the report of the
Royal Commission on Seals

and Sealing, which was
released last month, says
that netting should be banned
because of the suffering
caused to the seals. ’

its
report notes that the killing

suffering to seals captured
by nets is “considerable”
and because of this the

—- Whaling’s Future -—
Waiting for Resumption as "Survey Whaling"

"In the negotiations for reviving certain appropriations in the new
fiscal year, they approved 350 million yen for survey whaling." The
whaling fleet buzzed with the good news which was received on January 7.
"Now we know for sure that the government intends to stand by us." Fleet
Commander Iso Tai (55), who had been anxious over the outcome, relaxed
visibly.

"’It’s all over! It’s all over!’ —— for a while that’s all we heard,
but it’s QQL all over. There’s no reason to expect that this is the
end of whaling. While continuing survey whaling, we’ll wait for the
revival of commercial whaling. Only I wish the media wouldn’t treat this
so sentimentally."

But on the other hand, there are some who take a dim view [of survey
whaling]. Says Communications Officer Aoki Jinjiro (55) of the
Qgi-juichi loshimaru: "I don’t feel the least enchanted with survey
whaling. Since at present whaling is bearly breaking even, there’s no
reason to expect that survey whaling, which has far lower catch quotas,
could possibly make a profit, even if it was subsidized by the
government."

In preparation for the hard times facing whalers in the coming
season, the fleet has made attempts at some truly painful economies and
rationalization. Every day the ship’s newspaper called for lower
consumption of water and electricity.

"All the men are doing their utmost precisely because they believe
that [in the future] commercial whaling will resume," says Commander Iso
in a grave tone of voice. "I would have no complaints if we could carry
on survey whaling with this very same crew."

Some have pointed out that Japan’s whaling has lost the battle to the
propaganda offensive of the anti—whaling nations. Captain Nakanishi Sanji
(53) of the Dai-juhachi Toshimaru, who has met often with foreign
scientists, told me, "I expect they know that there are large stocks of
minke whales. There’s no doubt that we’ve been chased into this [weak]
position because Japan is not very good at speaking for itself. If things
continue as they are, there will be no resumption of whaling in 1990."

”The plan for survey whaling was put together by the Fishery Agency’s
Deep Sea Marine Products Laboratory (Shizuoka Prefecture, Shimizu Cityl,“
stated the ship’s newspaper. "The plan will be submitted to the Science
Committee at the June meeting of the International Whaling Commission
(INC)."

"No matter what happens, it’ll be rough sailing," said Chief
Navigator Mochizuki Kunihiko (SO) in a tense voice as he looked out upon a
snowy sea from the bridge of the mother ship.

The walrus and
the loophole

‘ ‘ I am sorry to acquaint
you that the sea-cow
fishery on these

islands is now totally annihi-

lated." So wrote a Royal Navy
captain more than 200 years ago.
when he reported the demise

through overexploitation of a

walrus-hunting industry on the

Magdalen Islands in Canada‘s

Gulf of St Lawrence.

Now. in an effort to prevent
the Alaskan walrus population
from suffering the same fate. the
International Wildlife Coalition.
a consortium of six conservation
and animal welfare groups. is
mounting a campaign to stop the
wholesale slaughter of the ani—
mals for their tusks.

Walrus ivory is almost as valu-
able as elephant ivory: althout

 

traditional Eskimo hunters
utilised the whole ca .~.ss for vs
meat. skin. oil. guts and blubber.
the tendency now is to cut off the
head and dump the body over-
board-a practice known as
head-hunting. Conservationists
are concerned that this illegal
hunting might be having a dire
effect on the Pacific walrus popu-
lation.

There are few places left
where Eskimos are still depen»
dent upon walrus hunting.
According to the Coalition. this
is tied to the demise of dog teams
as the major means of transport
and the corresponding increase
in the use of snowmobiles-
which. instead of eating free wal-
rus meat. consume costly petrol.

It is the need for money to buy
fuel that has led to a resurgence
of large-scale walrus killing by
Eskimos. There is a large inter-
national market for carved ivory
and mounted walrus tusks. and

10a“

together. with the high price of
raw ivory. this has created what
one scientist has called "an
uncontrollable incentive for
native. hunters to kill these
marine mammals simply for their
tusks.“

The incentive is considerable.
Raw Walrus ivory sells for S44.-

‘ $55 per kilo wholesale. and up to

$1327 per kilo retail. Once the
ivory is cut and worked. the price
can rise to $1.760 per kilo. Or. if
mounted with the skull. a good
pair of tusks might fetch 82.500.

The problem of head-hunting.
although apparent throughout
the walrus‘s Arctic range. is
especially acute in Alaska.
According to the LS Fish and
Wildlife Service (FWS). which
records the number of walruses
landed in all major coastal \il-
lages. the figures rose from 2.289
in 1980 to 3.081 in 1984.

But according to TRAFFIC
USA. between two and three

times the number reported may
be killed ‘lCh year. because
many go unrecorded and up to
half the animals shot sink before
they can be retrieved.

The last survey of the Bering
and Chukchi Seas gave an esti-
mate of 230.000—250.000 walrus.
but that. was in 1980 and little is
known of the population dyn-
amics of the species or whether

the hunt is “having an adverse
,‘ cites: on numbers.

There are. however. indica-
tions that all may not be well. In
1982' so many headless carcasses
were being washed up on the
Russian Diomede Islands that
the Soviet Union made a formal
protest to the US Department of
State. The year before that. FWS
agents seized more than 4.545
kilos of ivory (equivalent to 750
walruses) and found an inter-
national network. During the
unde cover operation leading up

”to the raid. one dealer was

recorded bragging that he could
supply ”unlimited amounts of
walrus ivory.“

And in Alaska there is little to
stop him. In the USSR. strict
quotas regulate the number of
walruses killed. In Canada, the
regulations go further and forbid
anyone from wilfully disturbing
walruses. insist that no meat fit
for human consumption be dis-
carded and require records to be
kept of trade in walrus products.

US lav. does afford some pro-
tection. but there is a large
loophole: the 1972 Marine Mam—
mals Protection Act prohibits
commercial walrus hunts but
allows the sale of traditional
carvings from tusks arising from
subsistence huntings. Clearly.

head-hunting has nothing to do
with subsistence. but legislation
to block the loophole has also to
circumvent the politically sensi-
tive issue of traditional rights of
Eskimos.

The International Wildlife
Coalition is currently tackling
the problem with gory direct-
mail leaflets urging people to
write to Donald Hodel, US Sec-
retary of the Interior. It is also
campaigning for the species to be

vention on International Trade

This. if successful. would at
least ensure that trade in walrus
products would be monitored.

The Rhine Struggles to Survive

 

By JOHN TAGLIABUE

 

BONN
or tourists, the Rhine will always
be a broad brown ribbon running
through the soul of Europe. In

the mountain reaches, like the region
between Mainz and Coblenz, it winds
through wooded hills, its banks lined
with sloping vineyards and green
gorges capped by turreted castles.
But there is another Rhine —- long
flat stretches, like the run that passes
Leverkusen and the immense chemi-
; cal works of Bayer, where nature
gives way to industry. And there is
growing concern that some of the in—
; dusti-ies that depend so heavily on the
‘ Rhine may be wearing out the river.
Bargemen, businessmen, politicians

and environmentalists are among.

those who have a stake in the Rhine’s
struggle to survive. But each group
also has its own agenda, and it is get-

ting increasingly difficult to reconcile ,

the conflicting demands.
The Rhine is a throbbing artery of
European commerce. From Switzer—
land in the south to the Netherlands,
more than 500 miles north, chemical
plants, factories and power stations
dot its shores, drinking in millions of
gallons a day.
It is also a critical transportation
link. About 125 million tons of goods
move along the river each year, al-
though that is
about a third less
than the volume 20
years ago.
And the Rhine
still supports a
fishing industry,
albeit a shrunken
one. Before World
War II, Rhine
salmon were a del-
icacy. but because
of peliutiun, res-
taurants now
rarely serve
Rhine fish. Today,
only a handful of
parttime fisher--
men cast their
nets, catching
maimy the hardy
eel.
For millions of
people in the Neth-
erlands and West
Germany, the
Rhine is a prime
source of drinking water, though it
must. be filtered and mixed with
water from wells or reservoirs.
German economists have devised a
yardstick to measure the produc~
tivity of the Rhine against that of
other great rivers, taking into ac-
, count. the amount of goods produced
l and shipped on or near its shores. By
i that measure, the drainage basin of

the Rhine produces $5 of annual gross

i

i national product per cubic meter of
: its water, more than double the Dan-
; ube. and five times the Mississippi.

l

 

But these are troubled times for the
mighty Rhine. Several recent envi-
ronmental catastrophes have focused
attention on the Rhine’s fragility:

On Nov. 1, about 30 tons of mercury
and pesticides washed into the Rhine
when firemen fought a blaze at a San-
doz chemical company warehouse in
Basel, Switzerland.

Several days later, Ciba-Geigy, an-
other Swiss chemical giant, admitted
it accidently released 900 pounds of
pesticide into the Rhine only hours
before the Sandoz fire.

In January two barges collided
near Diisseldorf, dumping 540 tons of
nitrogen fertilizers into the river.
Shortly thereafter, a Dutch barge, the
Minstreel, rammed a tanker near
Krefeld, Germany, pouring 10 tons of
a highly explosive benzene compound
into the water.

More subtle forces have been chal-
lenging the river, as well.

There has been a dramatic trans-
formation in the industrial use of the
Rhine. Chemical and pharmaceutical
companies, which use the river
mainly as a source of water for pro-
cessing, have burgeoned while min-
ing and manufacturing companies,
which use the river primarily for
transportation, have shrunk. Three of
Germany’s biggest steelmakers have
blast furnaces on the Rhine: Thyssen,
Mannesmann and Krupp. But de
mand for their products -- as well as
coal and sand and gravel for con-0
struction -— has declined in the face of
slow growth and foreign competition,
cutting revenues and employment in
the shipping industry.

OME companies have managed
to adapt to the changes. Franz

Haniel is a shipping company
that has been doing business since the
18th century in the German town of
Duisburg, which sits at the point
where the Rhine swallows the
smaller Ruhr river. Haniel’s neat
gray buildings, grouped around a cob-
bled courtyard, reflect its prosperity.
As bulk cargoes like ores declined,
Haniel bought equipment needed to
handle cargo containers and roll-on,
roll-off ships, which carry the trailers
of tractor-trailer trucks.

Haniel has managed to adapt to the
new facts of life on the Rhine, but the
combination of shrinking tonnage and
automation has put a lot of people out
of work. The decline is reflected in
cities like Duisburg, which, with its
maze of docks and arching cranes, is
Europe’s largest inland port. Last
year, through November, 16.8 million
tons of freight and bulk goods passed
through Duisburg, down from nearly
26 million tons in the comparable

. period in 1978. Today, roughly 30,000

people are employed in Europe’s in-
land shipping industry, most of them
along the Rhine, about 15 percent
fewer than five years ago.

Across the street from Haniel,
signs of the changes in the shipping
business are evident. The little inns
where Rhine bargemen and their
families used to eat and spend the
night while their ships lay moored

until morning, are now private
homes; restaurants have closed and
been converted into apartments.

“Unemployment is high, young
people go elsewhere to seek work,"
said Horst Krieger, an executive of
Franz Haniel.

To prevent a rash of bankruptcies,
the Central Commission for Rhine
Navigation, in Strasbourg, France,
has sought to scrap excess shipping
capacity, paying shippers to take
older ships out of service.

Shrinking the industry in an orderly
manner might make sense economi~
cally, but may not be acceptable so-
cially. In the Netherlands, for exam~
ple, the Government is scrapping
500,000 tons of obsolete tonnage, but
that program will eventually destroy
the traditional way of life of the
bargemen - “partikuliere.”

The partikuliere bid for cargoes at
exchanges in cities such as Rotter~
dam, and then haul them up the
canals and waterways that surround
the Rhine. Most come from families

Sandoz

that have been doing this for cen-
turies, and they live most of the year
on their ships with their families.

They tend to have the least-efficient
ships, however, and have gotten by
only with the help of Government sub»
sidies. The Government is now offer-
ing them pensions and lump sum pay-
ments to persuade them to leave the
business.

The growth of the chemical and
pharmaceutical companies poses a
different threat to Rhine life. Six of

Europe's largest rhemn ' . ompa-
nies have plants on the banks of the
Rhine, including Ciba-Geigy in Switz-
erland, and Bayer and BASF in Ger-
many. They use the Rhine both as a
dump for waste water, and a source
for clean water to use for cooling and
as an ingredient.

BASF, for example, operates an
immense complex of 330 factories
and plants along the river at Ludwig-
shafen, employing 53,000 people. its
water needs are enormous. Dietmar
Kokott, the engineer in charge of its
water supplies, said that the compa-
ny’s pumping stations suck in be-
tween 750 million and 935 million gal-
lons of water a day. As the water in
the Rhine became polluted, BASF has
had to turn increasingly to well
water. It now uses 10 different grades
of water, from unfiltered river water
for cooling to critically pure well
waters, pumped up from depths of 600
feet, for sensitive pharmaceutical
production. ’

BASF has taken several steps to
protect the river that it depends on so
heavily. In 1970, a fire on a chemical
barge not owned by the company
nearly destroyed huge amounts of
chemical feedstocks. Alarmed by the
accident, BASF built a special har-
bor, with remote-controlled fire fight-
ing equipment and floodgates that
could close in case of dangerous
spills.

of treating nearly 200 million gal-

lons. (Most of the water BASF
uses is for cooling, and is returned uno
treated to the river.) Hoechst, the
world’s largest chemical concern,
built a similar facility at its factory at
the confluence of the Rhine and Main
rivers, and Bayer built a treatment
plant at Leverkusen.

Nuclear power plants take a toll on
the Rhine, as well. Seven now stand
on the river’s shores, with two more
planned in Switzerland and Germany.
Nuclear plants use water for cooling,
discharging huge amounts of heated
watt-i into the river, which tends to
raise the water temperature.
Warmer water encou rages the breed-
ing of bacteria that rob the river of
large amounts of oxygen, making it
less habitable for other forms of life.

The quality of water in the Rhine
probably reached its low point about
1970; it has gradually been improving
since then. In recent years, govern-
ments along the Rhine passed legisla-
tion mandating construction of water
treatment plants for cities and indus-
try. Germany strictly regulates con-
struction of new factories along the
Rhine and bars large companies al-
ready operating there from incieas.
mg the amount of river water they
use. Switzerland and the Netherlands
have followed surt.

THE Rhine is monitored around

IN 1974 it completed a plant capable

the clock for the presence 01

toxic substances and increases
in temperature. When the tempera-
ture rises more than 2 degrees (centi-
grade), the nuclear plants are or-
dered to cut their intake of cooling
water.

in January, a group of independent
Swiss experts reported that the long—
term effects of the Sandoz Chell'llL‘al
spill might not be as bad as first
feared. Their study indicated that the
river was rapidly washing out pollu-
tion residues from the spill, and that
enough small invertebrate water life
and plants had survived to provide'
the basis for a rapid 'regeneration of l
fish and other water life. ‘

Nonetheless, serious ecological .
problems persist. Existing water
treatment methods do not filter out
several dangerous pollutants —- in-
cluding mercury, cadmium and lead I
-~ that enter the river as byproducts '
of manufacturing processes. And ac-
cording to Prof. Ragnar Kinzelbach,
chairman of the zoology department
at Darmstadt University, large

amounts of nitrates from farm fertil— l
izers sweep into the river with rain- '~

fall or seep in through
ground water.

While many ecolo- ’

gists believe that
more must be done to
cleanse the river, it is
not clear just what
action will be taken.
Mr. Kokott agrees
that pollution is still a
problem, but argues
that further improve—
ments would be pro—
hibitively expensive.
For politicians, the
river’s fate is becom-
ing an increasingly
important issue. The
Sandoz spill helped
the Green Party in
Germany increase its
share of the popular
vote to 8.3 percent in
January’s national
election; it had won
5.6 percent of the vote
in 1982. Chancellor
Helmut Kohl last
year added a Minis—
ter for the Environment to his Cabi-
net, and the Government has stepped
up prosecution of companies that spill
industrial wastes into the river.

in Switzerland and the Nether»
lands, the major political parties
quickly adopted environmental pro-
grams to forstall the growth of inde-
pendent “Green” parties.

In December, Dotch Transport
Minister Neelie Smit-Kroes organ-
ized a conference of environmental
ministers from Switzerland, West
Germany, France and the Nether-
lands to work out a cleanup program.
They agreed to ask the Rhine Com-
mission for specific proposals that
would enable delicate animal forms
such as salmon to inhabit the river by
the year 2000. But France, West Ger-
many j and Switzerland objected to
other recommendations made by the
Dutch, such as international inspec-
tion of suspected pollution sites, ar~
guing that they violated national
sovereignty.

Some fear that even the tourist in-
dustry, which has been one bright
spot in the Rhine's economy in recent
years, could be imperiled if steps are
not taken to clean up the river. But for
years swimming has been prohibited
in the Rhine’s waters for fear of
residual bacteria from city sewage
systems. And in hot dry summers

court today to pay $1.5 million for
, allegedly dumping thousands of tons
of toxic wastes into the Chesapeake
Bay during the past decade. A plain-
tiff described it as the nation’s larg-

obtained by a citizen lawsuit.

The settlement between the in-
dustrial giant and two environmen-
tal groups came one day before a
trial on the issue was to start in fed--
eral court here.

If approved by the trial judge, tin
$l..5 million settlement will go intc
a fund to help clean up the bay.

In addition to the money, Bethle»
hem Steel agreed to comply with the
terms of its permit for discharging
wastes into the bay and to improve
its monitoring of waste water from
the Sparrows Point discharge pipes.

“We feel great. It’s over,” said
Scott Burns, an aLL-irney for the

main lifelines is itself badly in need of
help. 6

is expertul to approve the settlement within
45 days.

Bethlehem Steel would pay the $1.5 mil-
lion in a lump sum by December, Burns
said.

He described the payment as being “in
lieu of a fine to EPA.”

Burns said the case “shows the importance
of the ‘citizen suit’ provision of the federal
Clean Water Act.” The provision permits in-
dividuals or groups to sue alleged polluters
when government regulatory agencies fail to
do so. Burns said EPA, saddled with budget
cuts and manpower shortages in recent years,
had failed to enforce waste discharge stan-
dards at Bethlehem Steel.

The Annapolis-based Chesapeake Bay
Foundation and the Natural Resources De-
fense Council of New York sued Bethlehem
Steel in September 1984, alleging that the
xtrrctmaker’s Sparrows Point plant in Balti-
more was dumping 300 million gallons of
was: e water daily into the Patapsco estuary of
the lay.

"the waste water contains unmeasured
amounts of cyanide as well as toxic metals
mcluding chrome and zinc, which injure del‘
icatv plant and fish life in the water.

State law allows the plant to discharge
small amounts of the pollutants—~40 pounds
of cx anide a day, for example—but environ—
mentalists maintained that Bethlel‘em Steel
tar ( xceeded those amounts and knew it.

The steel firm is one of Maryland's largest
mu ite employers, but like many other
smokestack industries, has had layoffs and
production cutbacks in recent years.

It also has had previous environmental
troubles, starting in 1977 when it was
forced to pay a $500,000 fine for repeated
violations of its discharge permit.

And in mid-1985, after the bay founda-
tion and the natural resources council filed
their lawsuit, Young ruled that Bethlehem
Steel had regularly exceeded its discharge
permit between 1979 and 1984, citing 369
violations of daily or monthly amounts.

Bethlehem Steel attorney Rosenberg said
today’s settlement is fair but “we had a num-
ber of defenses if we had gone to trial . . . .
Our biggest defense was that our overall com-
pliance record is excellent.”

He said that out of a possible 24,000 “op-
portunities for violations” since 1979, less
than 3 percent were alleged to be actual
violations.

Burns said the settlement tops a $1.3 mil-
lion judgment against Gwaltney of Smithfield
Ltd. of Virginia. Until today, that had been
the largest judgment obtained by a citizen
lawsuit against a water polluter.

The case against Gwaltney, under appeal
by the company, also was brought by the
foundation and the council for allegedly pol—
luting the Chesapeake Bay.

The foundation and the council are pri-
vate, nonprofit organizations.

Bethlehem Steel, based in Bethlehem,
Pa., reported a net income of $34 million
for the last quarter of 1986 but a net loss of
$153 million for the year.

Kiiled by kindness

ONE 0? several accusations
levelled at the Reagan
administration's involvement
in the Iran scandal is that it
was paying (with arms) the
ransom for American
hostages That is illegal under
American law, as it is under
ours. The reason is simple.
Payment encourages further
kidna ping and extortion.
The K and America are
prepared to condemn hos-
tages to death by refusing to

deal with kidna pers. In
effect, current lives are
sacrificed for the sake of
others.

Let's turn to a far simpler
and less harrowing decision.
When we see a parrot in a tiny
cage in the stinking Singapore
market, isn’t our first
humanitarian impulse to buy
the poor creature in order to
sto its misery? If we ignore it
an walk by, aren't we guilty
ofa callousness equal to that
of the captor? After all,
England has a law implying
that to withhold aid from, for
example. a victim of mu ging,
is almost equivalent to eing
an accessory to the crime.

However, kindness can kill.
The parrot is equivalent to a
hostage, not a mugging victim.

 

Paying for its release will
encourage the trade in birds.
The soft-hearted tourist in the
Singapore market might have
saved that one individual. but
he has ensured that many
others will be captured (and
die horribly in the process) to
replace it.

,money changes hands, the
f'transfcr shows that despite

both Congo and the UK being
signatories to a convention
(CITES) to control trade in
endangered species, never-
theless export of gorillas is
still possible and so there-
fore. 15 trade.

Gorillas fetch thousands of
dollars on the animal market,
which American zoos openly
stimulate by selling to one
another. Their prices are well
highly
unlikely that any dealers will
believe that such valuable
animals are being donated
"“‘er than sold.

When importing endanger-
ed species, Westerners forget
the vast disparity in income
between them and the Third
World. One hundicth of the
price of a gorilla could be
twenty times the monthly
wage of an African. To accept
orphans, then, is to encourage
trade. If trade is encouraged,
so is capture, captivity and
death in appalling conditions.

I have argued strongly
against the import of gorillas
to the UK. yet nobody can
doubt that some species have
been saved by captive
breeding programmes. The
list is short at present, but is
undoubtedly going to
increase. The latest in the line
is the Arabian oryx, a species
that went extinct in the wild
but is now back there again
thanks to the foresight of a few
people some decades ago.

So maybe we need to import
gorillas to save the species?
No, we do not There are
already over 450 gorillas in
captivity and breeding well
No more are needed to
maintain numbers or to
prevent inbreeding. One can
calculate that 450 gorillas
will, with proper manage-
ment, keep the population
going for 500 years, at a
minimum, before there is
serious danger ofinbreeding.

I am not arguing against

zoos; far from it. Zoos have
saved species, and will con-
tinue to do 50. Moreover, a
well managed zoo is an
enjoyable and immensely
valuable educational instit-
ution. No person should
doubt, however, that im-
porting animals from abroad
can do far more harm than
good, and in the case of the
gorilla is entirely unnec-
essary for conservation,
science, or education.

To import them is to
encourage trade, and
therefore to put other: In
danger. Untold suffering is
caused by the animal trade
For every animal in captivity,
nine have died on the way.
The message is clear. The
DoE's original refusal of
authorisation for John
Aspinall to import five
gorillas from Congo
Brazzaville was the correct
decision, and they~should
stand by it.

FEBRUARY ll

Wildlife group protests
zoo's gorilla purchases

An international wildlife
group based in the United
States has sent a letter to
President Chiang charging
the Taipei Zoo's recent order
of four baby gorillas from
Cameroon is unethical and
contributed to the slaughter
of gorillas in nature, and
requesting‘a full investiga-
tion.

“The cause of the continued
gorilla slaughter is that some
unethical zoos place orders
for these wonderful animals.
Among these unethical or—
ganizations (is) the Taipei
Zoo," Shirley MCGreal,
chairwoman of the lnterna~

tional Primate Protection Lea-
gue told the president.

Of the four gorillas the zoo
ordered, three died en route
to Taiwan. The only survivor,
which arrived Jan. 14. was
rejected by the zoo as being
too young and underweight,
but was later accepted after
private donors said they would
purchase it for the zoo.

On Jan. 27, the Taipei
Zoo put the gorilla nicknamed
Little King Kong on display
at the newly built zoo in
suburban Mucha.

‘Gross cruclty’

In her letter. McGreal told
the president that baby
gorillas are often captured
by shooting their mothers and
other adult gorillas that try
to protect the young. ”and
many of the captured babies
later die of stress. “By order-
ing four gorillas. the Taipei
Zoo has contributed to the
decimation of a magniﬁcent
species," she charged.

Citing a Jan. 31 report in
the CHINA POST that Little
King Kong had been displayed

in public. McGreal furthur
charged that exhibiting the
gorilla so soon after its arrival
was “an" act of gross cruelty
that no responsible zoo would
permit."

23 February 1987

The comments of the Taipei Zoo make depressing reading. They do not

know, and do not want to know, how their gorillas are caught. They feel
no remorse about 3 of 4 gorillas dying in shipment, and blame the
Japanese dealer involved (Keihin Choju, who had massive insurance on

the shipments, so made a real ”killing” on the affair). This attitude

on the part of buyers of animals is all too typical. It has been quite
prevalent even among scientists acquiring wild-caught chimpanzees for
research. The intellectual curiosity that takes these peOple into careers
in research all too often does not inspire curiosity about how primates

are caught.

Protests may be made to:

President Chang Ching—Kuo
Presidential Palace
Taipei, Taiwan

Kuan-Ping Wang
Director, Taipei Municipal Zoological Garden

You may also wish to contact the Japanese dealer involved:

We hope the Taipei Zoo can be persuaded not to attempt to acquire further

gorillas.

THE LESSONS
OF BHOPAL

Me lure of foreign (apim/ is .i‘trorlger

2mg

Tine BHOPAL TRAGEDY of December
3, 1984, in which at least 2,300 peo-
ple died and more than 200,000 were
injured, brought together two critical
issues facing not just India but most of
the Third World today: the role that
Western multinational corporations will
play in development, and the degree of
environmental risk that poor nations are
willing to accept as the price of rapid in-
dustrialization. Although Indian share-
holders owned 49.1 percent of Union
Carbide India Ltd. and government
policy had required that the plant be
staffed entirely by Indians, the corpora-
tion was almost universally perceived in
India as an American company. Thus it
seemed a foregone conclusion that the
disaster would generate an anti-Ameri-
can, anti-capitalist outbreak of the ﬁrst
order, and perhaps a wave of Luddism as
well.

The disaster apparently resulted from
an unlikely conjunction ofirresponsibility
and misjudgment. “There were main—
tenance problems that would not have
been tolerated at a plant in the United
States,” Jackson B. Browning, Union
Carbide’s vice president for health, safe-
ty, and environmental affairs at the time
of the disaster, told me. Overall plant
maintenance had been curtailed. as part
ofa cost-cutting program. A refrigeration
unit designed to cool the methyl iso-
cyanate had inexplicably been shut off.

A gas neutralizer anda ﬂare tower that ‘

were supposed to handle escaping gas
could not withstand pressure as strong as
that released in the incident. In addi-
tion, a water-spray system had been in-
stalled in such a way that it could not
reach and contain the escaping gas. Few
workers in the plant knew that methyl
isocyanate could be lethal, and virtually
no one in the surrounding community
had been told what to do in case ofa gas
leak. Local management had been com-
placent. “We’d felt very comfortable,”
Vijay P. Gokhale, the managing director
of Union Carbide India, told me when
we spoke in the autumn of 1985. “We
had some of the best safety records in
India.”

Conditions at Union Carbide’s Bhopal
plant may not have been representative
of the way American multinationals op-
erate in the Third World, but they did il-
lustrate some of the problems created by
industrialization in a Third World soci-
ety. “It is obvious that some manufactur-
ing processes are more dangerous in a
developing country than in a developed
one,” Peter Thacher, a former deputy
executive director of the United Nations
Environment Program, says. “You have
to assume that in a developing country
people will not be as careful in terms of

.\ls\R(Ill 1987'

inspection, quality control, and mainte-
nance. And you must assume that if a
problem occurs, it will be more difﬁcult
to cope with.” Researchers from the In-
ternational Labor Organization found,
for instance, that workers in a Volkswa-
gen plant in Mexico tended to think of
accidents as “fate,” and relied for securi-
ty as much on prayers to statues of the
Virgin Mary set up throughout the plant
as on safety training. Until recently,
moreover, environmentalism was often
viewed in the Third World as a West-
ern plot to retard the growth of poorer
countries. In 1972 Brazil’s Planning
Minister welcomed polluting technol-
ogies, saying, perhaps ﬂippantly, “Why
not? We have a lot left to pollute. They
don’t.”

Shortsightedness of that sort is rare
these days, but most developing coun-
tries still have no toxic-chemical-control
laws, and if they had them, would lack
both the technical and the institutional
capacity to implement them. Shortly be—
fore the Bhopal disaster an Indian gov-
ernment study found that only sixteen
of the fifty pesticide-manufacturing
plants in the country had signiﬁcant pol-
lution-control systems. The Madhya
Pradesh state government had never
cited Carbide’s Bhopal plant for signiﬁ-
cant safety violations or, for that matter,
even speciﬁed minimum standards for
plant safety. Nor had the government
ever sought to dissuade tens of thou-
sands of squatters from settling in near-
by slums.

When I arrived in Bhopal, I wanted to
learn how much hostility the disaster
had bred toward the United States and
what consequences it might hold for
other Western multinationals, in India
and elsewhere in the Third World where
the risks from industrial development
were comparable. I also wanted to ﬁnd
out if the disaster had spurred Third
World governments, including India’s,
to act against environmental danger,
and, indeed, whether it had thrown the
whole process of modernization into
question. How inevitable, I wondered,
were future Bhopals?

THE PEOPLE OF Jai Prakash Nagar, a
slum on the outskirts of Bhopal, re-
fer to what happened early on that De-
cember morning simply as “the gas.”
While many of Union Carbide’s workers
ﬂed in panic, a white cloud of methyl
isocyanate, escaping from a storage tank
during a runaway chemical reaction
(probably caused by water contamina-
tion when a pipe was improperly
washed), drifted over the shanties of the
poor. Families were wiped out. Entire
streets and blocks were laid waste.
When I walked through Jai Prakash
Nagar a year after “the gas,” the physical
evidence of disaster had largely disap-
peared. The Indian government, em-
barrassed by the attention of the interna-
tional press, had performed cosmetic
surgery on what was once one of the
city's most dismal slums. Drains had
been laid, saplings planted, the worst
huts pulled down. Fifteen hundred free

housing units had been built for indi-
gent survivors. Public and volunteer
clinics were providing many victims
with their first experience of modern
medicine, including the ﬁrst psychiatrist
ever seen in Bhopal. Job programs, sup-
ported in part by Union Carbide, were
beginning to retrain some of the dis-
abled in leatherwork and tailoring. Con-
trary to early fears, no signiﬁcant in-
crease in the incidence of blindness
seems to have‘occurred. Apparent in-
creases in kidney and liver damage and
in birth defects have been reported,
however. The human suffering was of
numbing dimensions. Of the more than
200,000 people injured, according to In-
dian physicians I spoke with in Bhopal,
perhaps 10,000 will endure some form of
lasting damage, mostly to their lungs.
About 2,500 will remain at least partially
crippled for life.

From Jai Prakash Nagar, I took a taxi
past the lakes that were once the
norm/1’s private preserve, and up the low
hills to the east, where the ofﬁces of the
Madhya Pradesh state government are
lodged in a modern concrete tower. My
appointment was with V. N. Kaul, the
State’s secretary of industry and com-
merce. He told me that the disaster had,
at least modestly, heightened concern
about environmental safety. I learned
later that the state of Maharashtra had
sued the Ministry of Defense for pollu-
tion caused by an explosives plant.
Kerala had sued a chemical concern for
contamination of the Periyar River. Vil-
lagers in Gujarat, who for years had pas-
sively consumed chemically polluted
water, had demanded and gotten a fresh-
water source from the state government.
In Madhya Pradesh, Kaul told me, an
omnibus pollution-control law was un-
der consideration, and an Indian-owned
petrochemical plant had been ordered to
relocate to a less populous site. Howev-
er, he added, “the Bhopal disaster has
had no effect on the pace or process
of industrial growth. No technology
has been turned away or turned down
as a result of what happened. Why
should we condemn all multinationals be-
cause of bad decisions taken by Union
Carbide?”

Later, in Bombay, Kaul's words were
echoed by Gokhale of Union Carbide.
“Bhopal has had absolutely no effect on
multinationals in India,” Gokhale said.
“In fact, since then the Indian govern-
ment has gone even further in seeking
tie-ups with foreign companies, and
ﬁrms from the United States head the
list.” And a senior diplomat at the Indi-
an Embassy in Washington informed me
that as far as the Indian government was
concerned, the tragedy was “a human
problem that resulted from one com-
pany’s bad planning.” In the streets of
Bhopal marchers occasionally chanted,
“America made the poison and dumped
it in Bhopal!” But these protests seemed
almost beside the point. No government
ofﬁcials, no major political parties, took
up the cry. No one called for expropri-
ation of Union Carbide’s holdings or
urged a general crackdown on foreign
capital, though in late November, 1986,

the Indian government announced in a
Bhopal courtroom that it would seek $3
billion from the Union Carbide Corpora-
tiori‘ as compensation for the accident
and its long- and short-term effeas.

IN THE 19703 assessments of multina-
tionals' role in the Third World more
often resembled a demonology than a
reasoned evaluation of corporations’
complex effects on economic develop-
ment. Richard J. Barnet and Ronald E.
Muller observed, in their inﬂuential
1974 book Global Reach, that critics com-
monly viewed the corporations' activi-
ties as “a recipe for a new stage in au-
thoritarian politics, an international class
war of huge proportions, and, ultimate-
ly, ecological suicide." Multinationals
were then predominantly American: in
1971, 280 of the 500 largest corporations
had their headquarters in the United
States. In many places they were hated
for their ability to interfere in local poli-
tics, their control of essential resources,
the ease with which they could shift
proﬁts abroad, and what was alleged .to
be eagerness to dump backward tech-
nology and hazardous wastes on coun-
tries too unsophisticated to recognize
them. Ignorance of the way that multi-
nationals actually functioned sometimes
merged with radical ideology in an eco-
nomic war against real or imagined ex-
ploitation. From 1970 to 1975, Third
World countries nationalized 336 for-
eign-Owned companies, whereas the ﬁg
me for the previous decade was 136.
Many companies left Third World mar-
kets, some feeling squeezed out by pu-
nitive regulation, tariff barriers, and a
trend toward centralized economic plan-
ning, frequently ﬁnanced by enormous
loans from Western banks willing to lend
to governments of any political makeup.
Multinationals that weathered the
ideological firestorms of the 19705
proved to be far more adaptable than
their critics had foreseen. When devel-
oping countries sought to supplant the
multinationals with state monopolies,
the displaced corporations learned to
make money by licensing their technol-
ogy, contracting out management, and
bartering their products for local goods
instead of cash. When countries de-
manded that multinationals export more
ﬁnished goods to bring in foreign cur-
rencies, corporations expanded their
marketing networks. When govern-
ments insisted on a voice in multination-
als’ activities, joint ventures proliferat-
ed. In China, for instance, R. J.
Reynolds is building a cigarette plant in
partnership with a state tobacco com-
pany, American Motors Corporation has
teamed up with a Chinese auto maker to
manufacture jeeps, and the Foxboro
Corporation is building industrial-pro-
cess-control systems with the coopera-
tion of a Shanghai firm. Diffusion of
ownership has weakened nationalist
hostility to multinationals by blurring
the once bitter issue of direct foreign
control. '

A pronounced change has also taken
place in the attitude of many developing
nations toward multinationals. A Latin
American diplomat who specializes in
the activities of multinationals told me
not long ago, “The ghost of ideology is
fading: Third World countries are learn-
ing to deal with transnationals as real en-
tities in the real world.” What conﬂict
remains has ceased to focus on allega-
tions of imperialism and now tends to
take the form of pragmatic negotiations
over such issues as import substitution,
the location of corporate research-and-
development facilities, and the compo-
sition of joint ventures. The reasons for
this change of heart are manifold: the
drying up of easy development loans
from Western banks and the burgeoning
of foreign debt; a growing recognition
that foreign private investment can pro-
mote industrialization and generate
jobs, foreign exchange, and tax rev-
enues; a perception that continuing
modernization may hinge on the absorp-
tion of advanced technologies that can
be obtained only from developed cap-
italist countries; and a widening disillu-
sionment with socialist economics.

For many countries the turnabout has
been dramatic. Turkey has reversed its
long-standing protectionism, junked
most of its export controls, and proposed
the establishment of free-trade zones on
its Mediterranean coast. Algeria has
adopted a new investment code that
guarantees foreign investors the right to
repatriate proﬁts. Mexico in 1985 autho-
rized the largest number offully foreign‘
owned investments in its recent history.
Ecuador recently raised the permissible
proportion of foreign ownership of ex-
port-oriented companies from 30 per-
cent to 100 percent. Guinea and Mo-
zambique have shed many orthodox
Marxist policies that left their econo-
mies in ruins, and are courting Western
investment. As Babacar N’Diaye, the
president of the African Development
Bank, has put it, “Africa in the eighties
is not taking account, as far as economics
is concerned, of ideology. We are prag-
matists.” The sharpest policy reversal of
all has occurred in China, which has un-
dertaken a far-reaching experiment in
free-market policies throughout its
economy and claims some $4.6 billion in
foreign investment since 1979. “Twenty
years ago there were great certitudes on
both sides of the ideological divide,”
says Richard J. Barnet, who is now a se-
nior fellow at the Institute for Policy
Studies, in Washington, DC. “Those
certainties don’t exist today. When Chi-
na welcomes multinationals and- sets up
export zones for companies that it used
to decry as the epitome of exploitation
and imperialism, then it is clear that the
ideological issues surrounding multina-
tionals have changed.”

The India of Rajiv Gandhi embodies
many of the new attitudes that are
sweeping the Third World. “You no
longer ﬁnd anyone of influence arguing
that the future of the economy or the
country lies in greater state intervention,
in more nationalization or government
control,” a director of the State Bank of

India remarked to me one evening at a
cocktail party in the home of an Ameri-
can diplomat. Since his accession to
power after his mother’s assassination, in
1984, Rajiv Gandhi has replaced the Fa-
bian socialists who had guided India
since independence with a generation of
young technocrats who are more inter-
ested in building industries that can
compete with Hong Kong and Japan
than they are in ideology. In the past two
years the government has cut taxes, re-
moved production quotas and import re-
strictions, established export incentives,
deregulated the electronic and engineer-
ing sectors, and vigorously promoted
commercial competition, telling compa-
nies at one point that they would “have
to ﬁght for survival” among themselves.
At Gandhi’s instrucﬁon, the central gov-
ernment has adopted the ﬁrst ﬁve—year
plan in Indian history to rely on the pri-
vate sector more than on the public sec-
tor to create jobs.

Since last year Indian firms have
scrambled to conclude new technical-
collaboration agreements with foreign
investors. While India has successfully
sought licenses to import more than $1
billion in advanced American technol-
ogy, including state-of—the-art com-
puters, record numbers of American
trade delegations have been traveling to
India in search ofinvestment opportuni-
ties. In this atmosphere the Bhopal acci-
dent was perceived less as a political or
moral event than as a fact of industrial
life.

IRONICALLY, MANY COUI’ltl’lCS h'dVC

grown reluctant to set rigorous envi-

ronmental and industrial safety stan»

dards at a time when multinationals
have become, probably, more respon-
sive than they have ever been to envi-
ronmental concerns. Moreover, high en-
vironmental standards seem not to be a
deterrent to investment. According to a
1985 study by the United Nations Cen-
tre on Transnational Corporations, mul—
vtinational investment in hazardous in-
dustries has gravitated chiefly toward
countries with advanced industrial
economies and stiff pollution controls.
Among developing countries Singapore,
one of the most environmentally con-
scious nations in the world, has a virtual-
ly unsurpassed record of winning foreign
investment. In the future, low or unen-
forced environmental standards, sugges-
tive as they are of a backward, ignorant
population and work force, are more
likely to deter Western investment than
to attract it.

In the absence of adequate local stan-
dards for environmental safety, multina-
tionals will in the coming years demand
fuller control over the stafﬁng, design,
and equipment of their foreign plants,
and when they build new facilities they
will probably insist that local govern-
ments share legal liability in the event of
accidents. “You can’t be beholden to a
foreign government as to how to run
your company, and then be liable to law-
suits in American courts,” says Alvin M.
Natkin, the president of the Continental

Environment Company and a former
manager for environmental affairs of the
Exxon Corporation. “If a corporation has
to take in local partners, and especially a
foreign government, it’s going to be a lot
more careful about liability and safety
responsibilities than it would have been
before Bhopal. Ifa corporation goes into
a country on its own, it’s going to run its
business just as it would in the United
States.”

The fears, common in the 19705, that
multinationals would increasingly dev-
astate the Third Worlds’s environment
now seem exaggerated. “Pollution ha-
vens,” free of environmental regulation,
failed to proliferate as many critics had
expected, and where they existed they
failed to attract the interest of major
Western companies. On the contrary,
multinationals now appear to be the pri-
mary source of up-to—date safety and en-
vironmental technology for the Third
World. A 1984 study by the International
Labor Organization determined that
multinationals generally maintain health
and safety standards well above those re-
quired by the developing countries in
which they operate, and that they fre-
quently install the latest safety features
in new plants they build in the Third
World. In two new chemical plants that
it is building in Argentina, for instance,
the Monsanto Company is including a
state-of—the-art computerized process-
control system that is not yet in place in
some of the company’s United States fa-
cilities, and in planning a Brazilian her-
bicide plant the company has used the
most modern available computer model
to gauge the probable dispersion of gas
in the event of a ruptured ammonia stor-
age tank. Since the Bhopal disaster vir-
tually every American chemical com-
pany has undertaken an exhaustive
audit of its safety standards and its han-
dling of hazardous substances.

No real constituency yet exists in
most developing countries, however, for
serious efforts to protect the environ-
ment. Although more than a hundred
developing countries today have agen-
cies that are at least nominally responsi-
ble for environmental safety, up from
just a handful a decade ago, most are un-
derstaffed, underfunded, and overruled
in policy debates by economic planners
who still see development and safety as
mutually exclusive goals. Nigeria, for in-
stance, until recently one of the most
rapidly industrializing nations in Africa,
had in 1984 just nineteen safety inspec-
tors to monitor thousands of factories

and workshops. Where governments are
indifferent to environmental improve-
ment, well-intentioned foreign ﬁrms are
unlikely to have much effect. “It’s hard
to tell a government what to do, and es-
pecially to suggest that it doesn’t know
how to take care of its own citizens,” Al-
vin Natkin, of Continental Environ-
ment, says. Local firms in the Third
World are also unlikely to be imbued
with the sort of environmental ethics
that have become common in the West
in recent years. When 100,000 residents
of the Indian city of Virabhapatnam
were exposed to a cloud of noxious gas
just months after Bhopal, none of the
half-dozen plants nearby was willing to
take responsibility.

BEFORE HIS LUNGS were damaged in
the Bhopal disaster, Tunda Lal had
earned about $1.50 a day as a mason,
when work was available. When I met
him in Jai Prakash Nagar, he rarely had
the energy to stay on his feet more than a
few hours a day. As a registered victim of
the gas leak, he will receive compensa-
tion when the suit against Union Car-
bide is settled. But that may be many
years away. In the meantime, he hopes
to ﬁnd a place in a job-training program,
and sometimes begs in the street. I
asked him what he would do if the Car-
bide plant reopened, handling the same
gas in the same way it had before and
posing the same hazards to his commu-
nity. “If it opened again tomorrow,” Lal
replied, “I’d be happy to take any job
they offered me. I wouldn’t hesitate for a
minute. I want to work in a factory, any
factory. Before ‘the gas’ the Union Car-
bide plant was the best place in all Bho—
pal to work.”

“I’d go too, do or die,” added a neigh-
bor named Tulsi Ram, brandishing a
wad of medical prescriptions and leaning
on a cane.

Lal and Ram, and others like them in
Bhopal, understand the nature of eco-
nomic change better than many Western
critics of multinationals. The security of
a good wage and the dignity ofa modern
job are not things they take for granted
but distant, even profound aspirations
that can be achieved only through ambi-
tion and risk. No one today contem-
plates a reversal of the process of mod-
ernization and industrialization. It must
take place, most Third World govern-
ments, and apparently increasing num-
bers of their citizens, believe, at least in
part on the basis of Western capital.

Kasten Criticizes Multilateral Banks

I Steps taken so far by the World Bank and other multilateral de
velopment banks to protect the environment when approving loan
projects have been inadequate, Sen. Robert W. Kasten Jr. (R—Wis.)
said yesterday. Kasten said a Treasury Department report sent to
Congress yesterday, evaluating environmental reforms requested
by Congress in 1985, “underscores the meager progress” made.
“There is little question that what is going on here is foot-drag
ging by the MDBs,” Kasten said. He had been chairman of a Senate

TREASURY REPORT SHOWS MDB FOOT DRAGGING ON REFORM, SENATOR SAYS

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- A NEW STUDY BY THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT
SHOWS THAT THE WORLD BANK AND OTHER MULTILATERAL DEVELOPMENT
BANKS ARE "DRAGGING THEIR FEET" ON ENVIRONMENTAL REFORMS, U.S.
SENATOR BOB KASTEN SAID TODAY.

The report, requested by a Congressional subcommittee and
scheduled to be released Wednesday, documents the progress of
MDB's in implementing environmental reforms requested by Congress
in 1985.

"I had hoped this study would be a progress report. Instead,
it is another indictment of inaction. It underscores the meager
progress the World Bank and other MDB's are making on critical
environmental reforms," Kasten said.

"There is littlquuestion that what is going on here is foot
dragging by the MDB's," he said.

Kasten was chairman of the Foreign Operations ApprOpriations
Subcommittee that requested the reforms and has been a leading

Congressional critic of MDB environmental policies.

 




"None of the MDB's have yet taken steps we consider adequate
in cleaning up their environmental act," Kasten said. "Many of
these reform proposals have been on the books for two years.
This delay is only going to fuel the fires of Congressional
opposition to continued American funding and support for these
institutions."

The reforms suggested by Kasten's subcommittee in its
appropriations bills for 1986 and 1987 include increased
environmental review of development projects before they are
approved; increased environmental staffing at the banks and the
appointment of an environmental advisor to the President of each

bank (World Bank, Asian Development Bank, InterAmerican

Development Bank); and ongoing environmental review of projects

as they are executed.

Kasten said the Treasury report highlights the following:

0 Inadequate attention has been paid to employing
professionally trained environmental officers;

0 The World Bank has put environmental reforms on hold
pending a personnel reorganization.

O The InterAmerican Development Bank has failed to even
establish an office responsible for environmental review;

0 Only the World Bank has appointed an environmental advisor
to the CEO;

0 The Asian Development Bank did not even know what major
non-governmental organizations were in place to provide

assistance in reviewing the potential environmental impact of
a development project.

Kasten praised the "quick action" of the Treasury Dept., the
Agency for International Development (AID), and the State
Department to Congressional mandates for international
environmental protection.

"Every day of delay in upgrading international environmental
protection means that more scarce tropical forest is lost
forever. We are losing entire species, causing excessive soil
erosion, polluting the world's waterways, and impoverishing the
peOple of less developed nations who must depend on basic natural

resources for their economic future," Kasten said.

‘U.S. DEVELOPING POSITIONS ON
CHANGES TO ENDANG R D SP CIES CONVENTION

 

 

*Ninety—six member nations will convene in Canada in July to review the
effectiveness of international regulation of world commerce in wildlife as the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and
FlOra (CITES) begins its siith biennial conference.

The United States, which organized the global program to control the
burgeoning trade in endangered wildlife and plants in 1974, has announced the
process by which the public, conservation organizations, trade interests, and
others may help develop the positions this country will take on issues to be
discussed at the conference this year.

The Interior Departmentﬁsl S Fish and Wildlife Service, which enforces
thelCITES agreement within the United-States, requests public comments on
matters on the provisional agenda for the meeting by March 31,1987. The
provisional agenda was published in the January 13, 1987, Federal Register.
The agency plans to announce tentative negotiating positions on these issues
by April 7, 1987, and will hold a public meeting on those positions around
April 23 in Washington, DC. Final LLS. positions will be announced on or
about June 22, 1987.

The full meeting of CITES member nations will be held July 12-24,1987,
in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

"The process we now begin is the public}s opportunity to have its say in
how the United States will help regulate world trade in protected species for
the next two years,“ Fish and Wildlife Service Director Frank Ounkle said.

"Nations from around the world will be represented in Ottawa seeking to
improve the ways in which wildlife and plants are regulated in international
trade. As the United States has shown by nearly 14 years of commitment to the
CITES agreement, we take our responsibility to the world's wildlife seriously.
We expect no less from the other CITES member countries,“ he added.

The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna
- and Flora seeks to regulate the trade in hundreds of species of animals and
plants by establishing management and scientific authorities in evenylnember
nation and requiring that documentation accompany international shipments of
designated species or of products made from them. Such documents cannot be
issued unless a scientific authority first determines that trade would not be
detrimental to the survival Of the species. The agreement complements U.S.
’laws, such as the Endangered Species Act and the Lacey Act, that also regulate
trade in endangered species and other wildlife.

CITES establishes three classifications of species it protects.
Protected species are listed in appendices to the treaty: Appendix I contains
animals and plants in greatest danger of extinction, such as the mountain
gorilla, certain sea turtles, and the cheetah, whose trade is severely
restricted; Appendix II identifies Species not presently facing extinction,
such as the African elephant and the osprey, but which could become so if
trade is not carefullymonitored and regulated; and Appendix III contains
species that may not be threatened at all but for which certain nations have
requested international assistance in controlling trade, such as Canada's
walrus and Nepal's water buffalo.

Although specific changes in the CITES appendices have not yet been
proposed for the Ottawa meeting, several issues have been identified and will
be considered at the July session:

0 -A recommendation to continue a ban on all trade in CITES-controlled
species with Bolivia and to impose a ban on trade with Paraguay
because of the continuing problem of illegal trade in protected
Species from these South American nations;

Consideration of changes in the control of trade in African elephant
ivory and disposition of stockpiled illegal ivory in certain African
countries;

Discussion of the continuing illegal trade in rhinoceros horn from
North Yemen despite a CITES-wide ban and assurances from other

nations importing rhino horn that they will sOon end their trade.
Trade in this highly endangered species was the subject of recent LLS.
Congressional hearings; and

A review of the world trade in leopard skins allowed from seven
African countries and sold as personal items under quota. Although
the 03L does not allow imports of such personal items, it does allow
imports of sport-hunted leopard trophies from certain sub-Saharan
nations when it finds that it enhances the survival of the species.

A complete summary of the provisional agenda for the sixth regular
meeting of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild
Fauna and Flora appears in the January 13, 1987, Federal Register. Comments
should be received by March 31, 1987, at the Federal Wildlife Permit Office,

THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR

Earth’s diversity- of
species threatened
by human activity

By Robert C. Cowen
Staff writer of The Christian Science Monitor
. Boston

Humanity’s assault on Earth has so eroded its capac-
ity to sustain a rich mix of living organisms that the
planet may be on the brink of an era of mass extinction.

So warns analyst Edward C. Wolf of the Worldwatch
Institute in a comprehensive study released today.

Mass extinction is a paleontologist’s term for large-
scale disappearance of organisms found in the fossil
record, such as the episode in which the dinosaurs
vanished 65 million years ago. These episodes occurred
over periods of many thousands or even a few million
years. Mr. Wolf notes that pollution, loss of forests, and
other results of human action are beginning to destroy
plants and animals at so fast a rate there could be a
comparable mass extinction over the next few decades.

This is the second such warning issued this spring. On
March 31, the congressional Ofﬁce of 'Ibchnology As-
sessment (OTA) released its own study of escalating
extinction. It ‘explained that loss of diversity among
Earth’s organisms could mean that “at best, resources
that otherwise might improve the quality of human life
will not be available.” It added that “at worst, it could
mean a serious disruption of the ecological processes
upon which civilization depends.”

Wolf’s study ampliﬁes and extends that warning. He
explains: “As species disappear, the intricate links be-
tween species . . . are sundered. Even ecosystem proc-
esses such as the cycling of water and nutrients . . . can
be affected.” In short, he says, the basic ability of Earth
to sustain a healthy mix of organic life is at stake. What’s
needed, Wolf explains, is stepped up research plus rapid
development and use of the new applied science of
restoration ecology. Traditional conservationists try to
preserve what is still here. Practitioners of this new
science seek to revive damaged habitats and restore
biological diversity that has been lost. This can bring
what Wolf calls a “healing of the land.” But he warns

that humanity must move quickly to do this. He explains ,

there can be no such healing if the planet losestoo many
natural habitats that can supply seeds and animal stocks
for restoration and serve as modelsferrsstelsrs- _

Zoos and parks can also serve as refuge for endan-
gered species. However, these only serve as reservoirs of
species to repopulate much larger restored areas. Wolf
explains that large, connected habitats, such as large
stands of forest, are needed to maintain a natural diver-
sity of species.

'lb give a feeling for the rate of loss, Wolf quotes a

THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR JULY 20, 1987

A continuing World need:
protecting endangered species

. HAT’s needed to more effec-
tively protect the rare animals
and plants on the world’s grow-

ing list of endangered species? A Contin-
ued buyer boycott of products made from
such animals, a more aggressive interna-
tional effort to stop the making and sale
of such goods, stronger efforts to protect
the habitat of such species, and renewal
of the 1973 Endangered Species Act.

An American couple, just back ~ from
the Caribbean, was astonished recently
when United States Customs ofﬁcials
conﬁscated a newly purchased pair of

leather boots. The tourists were unaware 4

that the boots were made from the sea
turtle, an animal near the top of the Fish
and Wildlife Service’s endangered-species
list.

Few Americans learn with quite such a
jolt what is on that list of close to 1,000
species.

Fortunately, a few once—rare species,
including three varieties of Micronesian
birds, are no longer on the list. Many more
species are rare now only in certain geo-
graphic areas. The North American alli-
gator, while not everyone’s favorite crea-
ture, has made a comeback; six more
Southern states this summer moved it up
a notch to the "threatened” category.
'IVvo decades ago hunters had so depleted
supplies that the alligator wasdeemed a
relic headed the way of the dinosaur.

Many steps can help in moving species .

off the endangered list.

0 Current US legislation, carrying stiff
penalties of up to a year in jail and a
$20,000 ﬁne for harming an endangered
species, is up for congressional renewal
this year; it deserves support.

0 Greater environmental awareness,
aimed at preserving the habitat of var—
ious species and lessening pollution, also
helps. Revival of the brown pelican, now
faring particularly well on the Atlantic
Coast, for instance, has been largely at-

' tributed to Washington’s ban on DDT in

the ’70s The species was partially re-
moved from the endangered list in 1985.

0 Many efforts to breed species in cap-
tivity, including a recent Wyoming ex-
periment with black-footed ferrets, and
also an effort to breed red wolves, which

will be placed in North Carolina later this
month, have been very successful. The
increase from 15 to 150 in the North
American whooping crane population
over the last 50 years is attributable to
such breeding efforts. .

Yet the challenge of preserving the
best of the world’s wildlife remains im-
mense. Unfortunately, many more species
are added to the endangered list each
year than taken off. The list has quintu-
pled over the last decade; new species are
constantly being discovered and more
species, for a mix of reasons, are in trou-
ble. The last known dusky seaside spar-
row died in Florida this month; wildlife
experts will make, one last search of the
species’ natural habitat next spring be-
fore adding the sparrow to the extinct
species list. Expected to be added soon:
the rare California condor, which has not
yet bred successfully in captivity.

Still, endangered‘species can be helped
to recover. Preserving their home envi—
ronments is vital - which is one reason
that natural scientists, decry the rapid
disappearance of the world’s tropical rain
forests. Commercial development con-
stantly threatens endangered species.
And poaching, usually to trade the skins
and meat of rare species, is on the in-
crease. The Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species, a group of
94 nations, is exploring at its biennial
meeting in Ottawa this week how to cut

down more effectively on such illegal ac-

tivity internationally. Further gains need
to be made against pesticides as well (see
related news story, Page 1).

In the meantime, more vigorous en-
forcement efforts at the border can help.
The Fish and Wildlife Service, which
claims its warehouses are “bulging” with
conﬁscated products made from endan-
gered species, constantly updates, and
proﬁers a list of such taboo products. The
more that travelers refuse to purchase
such items, the less likely traders are to
kill more endangered species to replace
the goods.

Not only should the endangered-spe-
cies list lengthen, but goverrunent’s aim to
reduce the list to zero deserves every
citizen’s full support.

rOugh estimate by Dr. Peter Raven, direc-
tor of the Missouri Botanical Garden, that
several unique plant and animal species
die out every day somewhere on the
planet. If the assault on the environment
continues, Wolf estimates that rate is
likely to reach several hundred extinc-
tions 3 day within two or three decades.
Even though Earth now has several mil-
lion known species of plants and animals
(and perhaps 20 to 30 million uncataloged
species), such a rate soon would decimate

the planet’s biological diversity. What
would survive, Wolf observes, would
likely be species that can live anywhere
and subsist on anything. .

While species are disappearing all over
the planet, the largest losses occur when
tropical rain forests vanish. Thus the
rapid cutting of African, Asian, and South
American jungles — especially the Ama-
zon forest — is the greatest single threat to
biological diversity at this time. Thus

' “ways the nation could meet its food and

Wolf adds his warning to those of many
other ecologists about the need to pre—
serve as much as possible of the remain—
ing tropical forests. .

In this light, the International Socrety
for the Preservation of Tropical
Rainfores't last mOnth announced a joint
Soviet-American project to halt forest
loss on Madagascar. It would demonstrate
fuel needs without destroying its
forestresources.”

New Scientist 16 July 1987

 

IN THE Indian village of Arsikere,
Timmakka grazes her goats every day on
the common land while collecting twigs to
burn on her cooking stove. Her brother
cuts grasses to make the baskets he sells in
the local market. Other villagers collect
manure and materials for housing and farm
implements from the common.

Now the common land here and across
India is under threat. The forestry depart-
ment of the state of Karnataka wants to
fence off the commons and allow the
owners of paper and ﬁbre mills to plant
eucalyptus trees on them.

In Arsikere, farmers have defended 150
hectares of common land by harnessing 78
pairs of bullocks and ploughing the land
overnight. Nearby, villagers overturned
boundary stones marking the lands to be
taken over. Families in the district of
Shimoga blocked the entrance to their
village and put up signs declaring that the
common lands belonged to them.

This week, the Supreme Court in New
Delhi, the capital of India, is set to take a
major decision on the future of the coun-
try’s commons. It must decide whether to
uphold the villager’s rights to the free
common lands or to allow industrialists to
take them over. The immediate fate of
50 000 villagers hangs on the decision. But
the outcome of the case will touch the lives
of the rural poor throughout India.

At the centre of the current row is
Karnataka Pulpwood. The state govern-
ment has handed the company 30000
hectares of village commons. In March, the
Supreme Court ordered a temporary halt to
the transfer after the villagers ﬁled a peti-
tion in defence of their rights.

Between 1984 and 1986, the commons,
spread over four districts in the heart of the
Western Ghats, were leased to Karnataka
Pulpwood. The ﬁrm is a joint undertaking
between the state forest department and
Harihar Polyﬁbres, a subsidiary of an
Indian multinational ﬁrm, Birla. The ﬁrm
is clearing the land and covering it with
eucalyptus, a fast—growing tree that pro-
duces wood ideal for the manufacture of
paper and rayon.

S. R. Hiremath, a coordinator of the
campaign against the scheme, says: “The
case of Karnataka Pulpwood is one of
confrontation between people and industry
for the same land. If the farmer cultivates
common land they call it encroachment;

The campaign has been taken up by
leading environmentalists, and a local
voluntary organisation, Samaj Parivartana
Samudaya, ﬁled the petition in the
Supreme Court. The petitioners contend
that replacing the evergreen and sandal—
wood trees on the commons with eucalyp-
tus will disturb the ecological balance and
affect water resources in the region. They
say that the scheme will impoverish the
50 000 people of 76 villages who for gener-
ations have depended on the lands to meet
their basic needs.

The lands are shrinking fast, in some
areas by more than half in recent decades.
Some common land has been distributed to
the poor; much has been appropriated by
rich landlords. But increasingly the
commons are becoming the property of
industry. The paper and rayon industries
have cleared vast tracts of specially reserved
forests, and are now asking the government
for more land to plant.

The ﬁrst to beneﬁt was Mysore Paper
Mills (MPM), a state-owned company
which receives British aid for planting euca-
lyptus trees. The ﬁrm recently moved onto
the commons with bulldozers. “The people
discovered it was illegal,” said a local acti-
vist. “They literally lay in front of the bull-
dozers and MPM didn’t dare show its face
again.”

One of the most controversial schemes
has been the Karnataka “social forestry”
project funded by the World Bank and
Britain’s Overseas Development Adminis-
tration (ODA). Its declared aim is to end
the rural poor’s shortage of fuel and fodder.
But it has not worked out like that.

From its inception in 1983, the project’s
planners said that 80 per cent of the planta-
tions would be on private land, with 92 per
cent of the trees “likely to be eucalyptus”.

Indians ﬁght eucalyptus plantations on commons

The forest department is meeting these
targets by distributing free seedlings.

The tree has become a lucrative crop for
farmers who can afford the long-term
investment. It has no value for the poor,
however. It is unsuitable for fuel or fodder,
and yields neither fruit nor waste for ferti-
liser. A recent survey by the government of
Karnataka found that almost all the euca-
lyptus sold in Bangalore and Kolar districts
was consumed as industrial raw material by
Harihar Polyﬁbres.

Traditionally, Bangalore and Kolar, both
in the east of Karnataka, have been the
state’s largest producers of mg, a staple
food consumed by the poor. But the
invasion of eucalyptus trees onto farmland
is undermining food productlon and

putting farm labourers out of work.

A ﬁerce debate is growing over the impact
of eucalyptus on soils and water supplies.
The trees drain the soil of its nutrients and
the World Bank no longer backs the plant-
ing of eucalyptus in dry climates where
“indisputably the species does have a nega-
tive impact on total water yield”.

Britain’s ODA takes a similar line. “But
nothing has changed,” says Raj Iyer, an
environmental activist in Kolar. “Women’s
groups in our area who were raising nur-
series were told by the forest department
that at least 40 per cent of the saplings had
to be eucalyptus.”

Campaigners are calling for tree planting
to be based on the needs of the poor, with
the commons remaining under local
control. But they fear that if the Supreme
Court rules in favour of industry in the
present case, the principle of diverting the
common lands to commercial use could
become established.

Karnataka and Orissa are the ﬁrst two
states to lease large tracts of common land
to industry. But at least a dozen private
companies have similar proposals awaiting
the go-ahead from other state governments.
This summer, in India, the decision is being
as eagerly awaited as the monsoon. El

The proposed swap was negoti‘

groups representing 18 Alaskan
native corporations, which have
agreed to lease the land to major oil
companies. The tract selection was
completed earlier this month after
18 months of discussion and leaked
to The Wall StreetJournal.

William P. Horn, assistant sec— '
retary for fish and wildlife and
parks, said the department had in-
tended to make the proposal public
and seek congressional approval,
although Interior lawyers believe
the department has authority to
move ahead on. its own.

.“We are not'engaged in any form
of giveaway,“ Horn said, adding that
the plan has been put on hold after
several members of Congress
sharply criticized it. Earlier this
week, Rep. George Miller (D-
Calif.), chairman of the House In-

fragile coastal area of Alaska.

Canada fears the plan will harm
huge herds of caribou and muskox,
which calve at an Alaskan wildlife
refuge where the drilling is to take
place and then move across the
border to the Yukon. Canadian
Inuit depend on the herds for food.

In a preliminary report last
year, Hodel’s interior department
estimated that up to 40 per cent of
the Porcupine area, named after a
local river, could be lost if full-scale
oil development were allowed.

Hodel later claimed that this
estimate was an “editing error.”

Hodel approved the drilling plan
earlier this year, despite Canada’s
objections.

American conservation groups
and some congressmen also oppose
the plan, which must win congres-
sional approval before drilling can
start. '

Although Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney and U. S. President Ron-
ald Reagan did not discuss Cana-
da’s objections to the drilling .at
their last summit, the issue came
up at talks between External Af-‘
fairs Minister Joe Clark and Secre-

'tary of State George Shultz.

In the statement yesterday,
Clark called the agreement to be
signed today “an expression of the
shared concern for this common
natural resource and the co-opera-
tive determination to protect it.”

Mr. Brower said in a prepared state-
ment he was “relieved” to have the inci-
dent behind him. His attorney, William
Bryson, said his client is cooperating with
authorities and, if necessary, will testify
before a grand jury and at a trial.

The grand jury investigation stems: in
part from an audit of the final days of Mr.
Brower’s administration in 1984. The audit
cited about $15 million in payments ap-
proved by Mr. Brower for questionable
contracts, in some cases for work that ap ‘

parently hadn’t been completed. The bene- -
ficiaries of those contracts included large
contributors to Mr. Brower’s unsuccessul

reelection campaign.

The scandal rocked the Minnesota-sized
swath of arctic tundra, where the borough
had functioned much like a county govern-

ment.

OIL-INDUSTRY executives boast that they did a first-
rate job of protecting the environment while exploit-
ing the major petroleum field at Prudhoe Bay on Alaska’s
North Slope. '

Hence, they argue, there is no need to wdrry about
extending energy exploration and production to the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), some 70 miles to the
east and their next would~be target. ‘

A few weeks ago, Congress heard from environmental
organizations that Oppose large-scale industrial activity in
the ANWR. These groups are especially adamant about
declaring off limits the ANWR’s 1.5 million acre coastal
plain, considered the most complete and pristine wildlife
ecosystem left in the United States.

Environmentalists presented the lawmakers with a re-
port that documents why industry’s performance at Prud-
hoe Bay is not a reassuring basis for allowing drilling rigs
within the ANWR.

The report essentially pulls together scraps of informa-
tion gathered from the infrequent monitoring of regulatory
compliance and environmental damage around the Prudhoe
Bay area.

Contrary to industry’s assertions (and Interior Secretary
Don Hodel’s acceptance of same) that it did an exemplary
job, the record that emerges would hardly engender confi-
dence in opening up the ANWR to the oil barons.

One of the difficulties in preparing the report was that
federal and state regulatory agencies did very little moni-
toring of oil-company activity at Prudhoe Bay until the.

mid-19805. And even thereafter, inspections wereyeryj

sporadic.
Nevertheless, a coalition headed by the Natural Re-

-— Since 1980, there have been 13 documented cases of

. waste laws. The most serious of these episodes led to the

conviction of a waste-disposal firm that failed to pr0perly
get rid of the toxic residues discharged by the big oil
companies. Indeed, the transfer of hazardous surplus mate-‘
rials from the oil industry at Prudhoe Bay to its waste-
diSposal subcontractors has been under investigation by
federal authorities for some time.

- Violations recorded against oil companies at Prudhoe
include 11 air-pollution infractions; four citations for block-
ing fish passages in streams because of poorly constructed
culverts; four citations for illegal placement of gravel;
three citations for flooded mine sites as well as three for
failing to rehabilitate disturbed areas, and a notice of
imprOper tundra travel. .

-—- Federal and state inspectors have told environmental-
ists that there has been significant cumulative impact from
numerous small chronic violations of air, water and waste-
disposal regulations over the years.

Environmental damage on the North Slope is harder to
quantify with precision than the number of violations, but
the data is beginning to trickle in.

The report makes reference to a 1983 study in which
scientists were able to link an 18% reduction in Prudhoe
Bay’s shore-bird p0pulation with industrial activity.

It should also be noted that five hazardous-waste dump
sites at Prudhoe are being evaluated as candidates for
inclusion on the Superfund cleanup list.

The oil industry’s depiction of Prudhoe Bay as its Alaskan
environmental showcase is a very persuasiVe argument for
Congress to designate ANWR’s coastal plain a wilderness
sanctuary without further delay.

Mr. Brower and the borough were sub- ’

jects of Wall Street Journal stories in 1984
and 1985 chronicling the borough’s billion-
dollar debt and, a federal probe of its fi-

nances. The borough, created in 1972 by"

Eskimo leaders seeking a greater say over
local affairs, derived its massive wealth

from its ability to tax the North Slope oil <

fields and TransAlaska pipeline.

Mr. Brewer, borough mayor from 1981
until defeated in his reelection bid in 1984,
pleaded guilty to one count of tax evasion.
He admitted not paying taxes on $42,500
of gifts he received in 1982. Without admit-
ting they were bribes, Mr. Brower acknow-
ledged that the gifts—a boat, trailer, 175-
horsepower outboard motor and grocer-
ies—were part of a “business or commer-

L

 

cial” transaction.

In exchange for his guilty plea and for
cooperating with authorities, prosecutors
agreed to drop two counts of interstate
travel in connection with receiving bribes

and two counts of failure to file tax' re-

turns.

Mr.‘ Brower could be sentenced to five
years in prison and fined $100,000. But gov-
ernment attorneys asked that sentencing
be delayed until next spring so they and

see how candid his testimony is against

“We’ vs no firm proof yet that

in New York City, “so we can only

:es.”

Scientists believe that the con-
centration of carbon dioxide in the
Earth' 3 atmosphere was about 270
parts per million in the mid- 1800s.
It' 13 now about 345 ppm.

A 1983 National Academy of
Sciences report predicted that the
level eculd reach 600 ppm within 50

continued to grow at then- current'
rates. The rate of increase of fossil

‘ fuel use has slowed since that

report was prepared, however, so
that a doubling of carbon dioxide

. levels may take somewhat longer.

An increase in carbon dioxide

levels to 600 ppm, the academy .

report had predicted, could cause
global temperatures to rise by as
much as eight degrees Fahren-

heit—to temperatures that were '

last experienced during the age of
the dinosaur. Los Angeles might

_ then have 27 days each year with

temperatures over 90 degrees,
compared to the current average of

' five days, according to James E.

Hansen, director of the Institute for
Space Studies.

Another effect of global warming
might be a partial melting of the
polar ice caps, which could cause
flooding in coastal cities. Since the
1850s, sea level has increased by
one to two inches.

Global warming would also in-

crease evaporation of the ocean,

leading to a worldwide increase in
rainfall of as much as 11%, accord-
ing to the academy report. But the
patterns of rainfall would change
even more, it said.

Much of the ocean’s evaporation
occurs in the tropics because of the
higher temperatures there. Con~
vection currents then carry the
moisture-laden air toward the
poles at high altitudes. ,If the air

- temperature increases due to glob-

al warming, more moisture will
evaporate and more will be carried
north.

Global warming trend may
be sudden rather than slow

QLRobert c. Cowen

CIENTISTS concerned about
man-made climate change gen-
erally think in terms of 50 to
100 years. That’s the usual time scale
for global warming due to the buildup

of carbon dioxide (002) in the air. But;

what if it happens more quickly? '
That possibility worries one of the
world’s leading earth scientists —
Wallace S. Broecker of Columbia Uni-
versity’s Lamont-Doherty Geological
Observatory. Writing in the journal
Nature, he explains that, rather than
changing slowly and smoothly,-
Earth’s climate can switch abruptly.
He warns that signiﬁcant effects of
the so-called “greenhouse” warming
could happen so suddenly that people
wouldn’t have time to adapt. 7 ,
It’s a warning worth heeding.
Broecker is no more certain of his
climatic expectations than are scien-
tists who have been ex- ‘
pecting a gradual change.
But" he makes the point
that, since the climate
might surprise us, nations
should mount a more in-
tensive and better focused
research effort to under-
stand the COz-induced
greenhouse effect than
has been carried out so
far. This, at least, might
reduce the element of sur-
prise. It could also help
identify the most likely
climatic changes and the
degree of urgency with
which people should pre-
pare to cope with them. .
There’s littledoubt that we will
continue to load the air with 002. It’s
released when we burn fossil fuels.
It’s released when we clear forests,
since burned or decaying trees usu-
ally give up more CO: than the plants
that replace them absorb. Fuel c'on-
servation can slow down the 002
buildup. But, since the processes that
release 002 are built into the world
economy in fundamental ways, the
buildup will likely continue.
Among the possible effects that
are usually discussed, there’s the fa-

mous rise in sea level as warming sea.

water expands and, perhaps, some of
the Antarctic, icecap - melts. More
abundant CO: in the air might help at
least some plants grow more vigor—
ously. On the other hand, climate
changes could shift precipitation pat-
terns, drying out the present North
American wheat lands, among other
changes. .

Such possible effects are predicted
by computer-run mathematical mod-
els of Earth’s climatic system. The
models suggest that there will be

induced

gram that would tackle the 002 cli-

enough lead time'fOr people to adapt

to the new conditions. Broecker '

warns that these models can mislead
us. He explains that scientists do not
know how to incorporate important
aspects of the C02 problem — espe-
cially the role played by the oceans -
into these models.

Furthermore, Broecker explains,
studies of the climatic record con-

tained in North Atlantic seabed sedi-

ments and other “records,” such as
G'reenland’s icecap, have disturbing
implications. They record ecological
changes that. indicate rapid climatic
ﬂuctuation. During glacial time, he
says, “climate changed frequently
and in great leaps.” And the end of
that glacial time appears to have
come abruptly. It’s as though a key
element of the climatic system were
switching between stable modes of
operation rather than changing grad-
ually. Many oceanographers think
that global ocean circula-
tion is such a key factor.
Currently, the overall
circulation of shallow and
deep currents through the
Atlantic and Paciﬁc is
such as to maintain the

sphere latitudes, espe-
cially over Europe, where
the warming inﬂuence of
the Gulf Stream is legend-
ary. But the climatic
record suggests that this
circulation. has another
mode, which shuts oﬁ the
warming effect. Broecker
says that many climatic leaps seen in
the ice cores probably represent ﬂips
between these two stable modes of
the ocean circulation system. '

This raises questions about the
likelihood that greenhouse warming
could jolt the climatic system out of
its present mode and what the effects

. might be. “Unfortunately,” Broecker

observes, “we have little basis for
answering this critical question.”
Hence his call for a more aggressive
research effort.

In the United States, relevant re-
search is carried out by seVeral agen-
cies. Some ﬁelds - such as atmose

pheric science and climatic aspects of

oceanography - are vigorous, while
other ﬁelds important to this issue,
such as climatic studies on land, are
relatively weak. Broecker suggeStsi
creation of a special institute to co-
ordinate and fund a research pro-

mate problem comprehensively.

It’s quite possible that any green-
house climate changes will come
slowly. As Broecker notes, however,

Research, told the House of Rep-
resentatives science subcommit-

cultural research and environ-
ment.

The danger of raising the
Earth’s temperature .through the _
so-called greenhouse effect was
a topic of the session called to
consider funding the National
Climate Program, a research ef-
fort on the future of the planet’s ,
climate. .

The gre'enhouSe effect is a re—
sult of the increasing amount of
carbon dioxide and other gases
in the atmosphere. '

Scientists link this with an in-
crease in the air temperature,
pointing out that carbon dioxide
allows incoming radiation from
the sun to continue warming the
' Earth, but blocks outgoing radia-
tion from dissipating into space.
The result, like a greenhouse
protected by glass, is a rising of
temperature at the "surface;

Ihe cqmmittee -heard that
doubling the current carbon di-
oxide would ’raise the planet’s
average temperature by 1.5 de-
grees to 4.5 degrees. ' -

. The average temperature of
the Earth has been estimated at
between one—half and one degree
higher now than a century ago.
Although that may not sound
like much, the global climate
was only five degrees cooler, on
average, during the great ice
ages.

Other climate changes are
likely to include a cooling of the
upper atmosphere, an increase
in! rainfall in some parts of the
Earth and a melting of sea ice
raising the ocean level. Dryer
weather is considered likely in
the interior of continents, such
" as the great grain growing re-
gions of the United States and
Canada.

The most important sources of
- carbon dioxide are burning fossil
fuels and the destruction of for-
ests, because green plants re-.
move carbon dioxide from the
atmosphere, the scientists say.

“We can alter the technologies
we use, the access to them and
the human population size,” be
said.

 

 

“there is an equal possibility that

they will arrive suddenly and dra-
matically.” The need to clear up this
uncertainty is reason enough to beef
up COz-climate research.

THE GLOBE AND MAIL

 

’ World Bank seeks to clean up
a host of destructive projects

THURSDAY, JULY 23, 17987 ~

BY LINDA HOSSIE ,

The Globe and Mail

 

In its natural state, the leafy
canopy of the Amazon jungle is
dense enough to support a chat-
tering, screeching population of
jaguars, macaws, boa constric-
tors, dozens of their exotic tree-
mates, and even the occasional
light plane that strays off course
and crash lands among its
branches. -~

But in the state of Rondonia in .

northwestern Brazil, much of
what was once vital rain forest is
now a network of failing farms,
impoverished villages and tracts
of greying soil littered with the
snapped trunks of dead trees — a
scene of devastation pierced by a
newly paved highway, 1,600 kilo-
metres long, designed to bring
hundreds of thousands of settlers
to the area. .

Called Polonoroeste, this Brazi-
lian resettlement scheme is one
of what critics call “the fatal
five” — projects financed by the
World Bank that have brought
unprecedented man-made havoc
to developing regions of South
America, Africa and Asia.

Critics of the World Bank —
and they are legion, even among
its friends -- have raised a hue
and cry over the years about
projects such as Polonoroeste.
Since 1983, at least six different
subcommittees of the U.S. Con-
gress have held 20 separatehear-
ings into the World Bank and the
environment, producing thou-
sands of pages of testimony from
all over the world, documenting
projects that have gone wrong.

Now the bank has finally re-
sponded with an ambitious
scheme to overhaul its environ-
mental practices. .

The changes, announced last
month by World Bank president
Barber Conable, will include the
creation of an environment de-
partment with a staff of 100, an
urgent review of environmental
problems in 30 countries, a mas-
sive program to preserve tropical
forests and to slow the creeping
progress of deserts in Africa, and
a program to protect the Mediter-
ranean and its coast.

The reforms have the potential
to dramatically alter the bank’s
impact on the developing world
and as powerful a force, as the
US. Congress appears ready to
insist that they do. '

But manycritics, who accuse
the bank of ignoring enVironmen-
tal warnings in the past, are wait-
ing for more than announce-
ments.

“Obviously, it’s important to
have an increased. staff and so
on,” said Bruce Rich, the senior

attorney with the Environmental
Defence Fund; a Washington,-
based watchdog group. “But the -
real issue is the kind of develop-
ment they’re promoting. The

bottom line is the quality of proj-

ect that comes out of the pipeline.
What we still see are more and-

more of these bad projects.”
What are good and what are
bad projects is the centre of the
storm over World Bank environ-
mental practices, and it is likely
to remain so despite the bank’s
changes. What many of the
bank’s most powerful critics want
are fewer megaprojects, more
small-scale development and an
increased involvement of local
people in planning. What the bank
wants is simply to clean up its act
on the kinds of projects it cur-

, rently finances.

Because of its sheer size, the
World Bank is considered the
most powerful development force
in the world. Created in 1944 .at
the same time as the Internation-
al Monetary Fund, the Washing-‘
ton-based bank grants loans to
governments and government
agencies, development banks and
private undertakings. In fiscal
1986, the bank lent more than $18-
billion (U.S.) for projects in more
than 70 countries, almost half of
it for development with substan-
tial environmental impact, in.
cluding dams, roads and other
energy and transportation, proj-
ects.

The World Bank began to re-
think its attitude toward the envi-
ronment after a 1986 vote in the
US. Congress that knocked al-
most $l-billion off the Adminis-
tration’s request for more than
Sit-billion in World Bank alloca--

tions. More" crucial than the money

lost, perhaps, was‘the explanation
‘ for it: environmental problems with
bank projects. . ~

“If you give money, you get at-
tention. If you don’t give money,

you really get attention,” explained
'Alex Echols, legislative assistant to

Senator Robert Kasten, a Republi-
can who has taken a leading role in
forcing the bank to clean up its envi-
ronmental act. \ - ‘

David Hopper, a senior vice-pres;
ident of the bank, admits that the
0.8. money bill prompted the deci-

. sion to Work on the bank’s environ-

mental reputation. _

' But he said: “There’s no question
that the monitoring by the non-gov-
ernmental organizations in the US
was (also) an important factor.”

It is the non-government organi-
zations —— such as the US. World
Wildlife Fund, Canada’s Probeln-
temational, and the British Interna-
tional Institute for Environment

and Development -- that have fo-
cused on the “fatal five” projects in
a widespread and highly effective
public information campaign. ‘

As well as the Polonoroeste proj-
ect, built with $500-million from the
World Bank, the five include:

0 An Indonesian resettlement

scheme to move tens of millions of

citizens from the crowded inner
islands of A the archipelago to the
tropical forests of Kalirnantan,
Sulawesi and Irian J aya. Critics say

.the outer islands have poor soil and

that by the" end of the decade set-

' tlers will have destroyed millions of

hectares of tropical forests in_ their
search for arable land on which to
grow food. . ‘ , . -

Mr. Hopper said the bank is sensi-

'wants from the World Bank in envi-'

ronmental protection.

One key congressional concern is”

that the ,bank include local non-
government groups, indigenous
people ‘and censervation organiza-
tions at all stages of planning a proj-
ect. . ‘ . - - '

Another is that the bank increase
small-scale; light-technology
projects, such as mixed farming,
high-yield, woodlots, small-scale

hydro projects and rural solar ener-

' Such Congressional interests
seem destined to collide even with
reformed bank policy. Mr. Hopper
said that, while the bank may be-

come more “eclectic” in its choice \

of projects, it is “not going to go

And he. said many. borrowing
countries prefer that the bank not
deal with their national interest
groups. To get around that problem,
the bank may work with such
groups in the United States, many
of which .have connections with

World, he said.

“It’s very important for the Cana-’

said, arguing that the United States
needs the support of as many
members as possible. . . _ .

Canada’s relatively small finan-
cial involvement in the World Bank,
about a fifth that of the United

Frank Potter, the Canadian execu-
tive director of the bank. . . .

Panama Fights for Its Forests

Environmental emerts are concerned'about the

dangers of uncontrolled destruction of the World's .

rain forests. Recently the government of Panama
began an urgent campaign to save the cotmtry’s
forests, but it is meeting resistance from, among
other interested parties, the United, States.

_ Last April the Panamanian government made it
illegal to cut down any tree more than five years
old—one of the most stringent environmean
decrees ever handed down in Latin America. The
plan is to slow the encroachment of lumber and
farming operations on the once-lush Panamanian
Zcountryside, particularly“ in the watershed of the
Panama Canal. The decree resulted from. environ-
mental studies predicting that the flow of silt from
denuded land into the lakes that feed the canal
will make the canal shallower. That could limit its
operations by the year 2000, when Panama takes
full control of the canal from the United States.

Panama’s lumber industry is challenging the ,

legality of the decree, and peasant. leaders ‘ warn

Bolivia to Protect Lands in Swap for Lower Debt

 

By PHILIP SHABECOFF

 

Special to The New York Times

ASHINGTON, July 13 —-

The Bolivian Govern—

ment agreed today to

protect millions of acres

of threatened tropical lowlands in re-

turn for a reduction of its foreign
debt ' ,

Under the agreement, signed at the

Bolivian Embassy here and hailed as

the first of its kind, Conservation In-
ternational, a nonprofit United States
group, purchased $650,000 of Bolivia’s
$4 billion external debt. In return, the
Bolivian Government committed it-
self to setting aside 3.7 million acres

in three conservation areas adjacent ‘

to the. existing Beni Biosphere Re-
serve in the Amazon Basin.
The agreement, which the partici-

pants said could set a broad prece-j

dent, seeks to deal simultaneously,
\w‘th two critical and interrelated
g 'bal problems: the huge external
det‘rt pressing down on many develop-
ing countries and the rapid destruc-
tion bf tropical rainforests and their
plant ‘and animal species. "

Momentum is now building to make
further use of the “debt-for-nature”
concept. Aides to Representative
John E. Porter, an Illinois Republi-
can, said he would introduce legisla-
tion within the next 10 'days requiring
the United States to encourage inter-
national lending institutions like the
World Bank to set up “debt-for-na-
ture" pilot programs. And in the Sen-
ate, there are plans for legislation
that would pave the way for tax
credits for commercial banks that
forgive debts of countries that agree

Peter. Selig-
mann, said at the signing ceremony
today that there was now a “global
debt and environmental crisis” in
which tropical forests and Water-
sheds are being destroyed at “an un-
precedented rate and we are in the
midst of an extinction unprecedented
even by the extinction of the Plei-sto
cene era.” Most of this disaster, he
said, is taking place in the developing
countries of the tropics.
“Environmental degradation and
weak economies, deforestation and
poverty, oVerpopulation and hunger
are now recognized as clearly inter-
related,” Mr. Seligmann said, ex-

plaining that many countries under ‘

pressure to pay off their external
debt seek “quick-fix solutions” that

use up their natural resources and _,_

g The executive director of Conserg
vation lntemational,

thus the country’s economic poten-
tial.

The amount of money involved in
today’s exchange is only a small frac-
tion of Bolivia’s $4 billion external
debt. But Fernando Illanes de la Riva,
the Bolivian Ambassador here, said
at a news conference that the ar-
rangement was “a major break-
through, not only as a means to .re-
duce Bolivia’s debt burden, but also
as an effective way to protect the
natural resources upon which our
country’s long-term economic health
depends.”

Protection by Law _

Bolivia’s 334,200-acre Beni Bio-
sphere Reserve was created by ad-
ministrative decree in 1982 as a

' model for the protection of local eth-

nic groups as well as for the area’s
plants, animals and water. Under the
agreement today the expanded re-
serve would have protection under
the law, rather than under a decree
that could be withdrawn.

The new lands,.all owned by the B0-
livian Government, will serve as
buffer zones around” the reserve.
They includeg the 2.9-million-acre
Chimane Forest reServe, which is
home to the nomadic Chimane In-
dians, as well as the Yacuma Re-

gional Park and the Cordebeni I-Iy-i

drological Basin, which together ex-
ceed 800,000 acres. The area is habi-
tat for 500 species of birds, supports
13 endangered species of plants and

animals and has more species of'

trees than all of North America.
Currently some of the forest is
being cut down, for cattle ranching
and lumbering operations. With the
land now set aside for conservation
reserves, the forest will be'managed

for “sustainable development” Am-
bassador Illanes said. While there
would be economic activity within the
reserves, some sections would be
completely protected for wildlife, for
hunting by Indians or for other uses.

Debt Bought at Discount

The Bolivian Government has also
agreed to set up a trust fund with the
equivalent of $250,000 for administer-
ing and protecting the expanded re-
serve. .

The $650,000 in debt was purchased
at a discount by the Citicorp Invest-
ment Bank, acting as agent for Con—
servation International, from other
lenders in the secondary market. The
debt was purchased for $100,000,
roughly an 85 percent discount, the
participants said. The $100,000 was
supplied to Conservation Interna-
tional for the purpose by the Connect-
icut-based Frank Weeden Founda-
tion. Donald Weeden, director of the
foundation, said the foundation was
planning two other $100,000 awards
for similar projects. Mr. Weeden said.
the swap arrangement signed today-v'
was an “extraordinary precedent.”

The Bolivian Government will hold
title to the conservation areas and ad-
minister them in partnership with the
Bolivian Association for the Conser-
vation of Nature, a private group.
Conservation International will be an
official adviser. ’

Mr. Seligmann expressed hope that
“this new debt-for-nature swap will
encourage future negotiations of this‘
kind that confront the debt crisis
worldwide with workable, long-term
alternatives; and that the current
trends in global resource destruction,
which are exacerbated by the debt

-crisis,will soon be reversed.”

Costa Risans to Plant Trees
On Airstrip North Arranged

WASHINGTON, July 24 (AP) -— Chil-
dren will plant tree seedlings Saturday
on an airstrip in Costa Rica that was
built by the private network Lieut. Col.
Oliver L. North set up to assist the
Nicaraguan contras, Costa Rican offi-
cials say.

President Oscar Arias Sénchez is ex-
pected to sign a decree incorporating
the little-used Santa Elena airstrip,
part of a 39,5003cre property, into the
Santa Rosa National Park. in the northé
western section of the country. \

“The Government of Costa Rica has
moved to insure the protection of the
last sample of tropical dry forest, while

 

SLASH-AND-BURN agriculture is
responsrble for the destruction of large
areas. of forest in the Amazon Basin. This
practice involves crudely clearing the trees,
farming for a few years and then moving on.
Paradoxically, the survival of the rain-
forests may depend upon farmers
continuing this primitive form of agricul-
ure. '
Christopher Uh] of Pennsylvania State
University has shown that there are three
critical factors that determine how fast the
forest returns to abandoned farms (Journal
ofEcoIogy, vol 75, p 377). First is the avail-
ability of seeds or tree stumps that will
sprout again. Second is the availability of
microhabitats where new plants can estab-
lish themselves. And third is the supply of
nutrients. If all these are available, grasses
and other small plants soon appear. After

these come the pioneer tree species which
are fast growing but shortlived. These help
to prepare the way for the primary forest
trees—which may take as long as 50 years
to establish themselves. Once they have,
however, they live for a very long time.
More recently, richer farmers have taken
to ranching in the Amazon Basin. This
bodes ill for the forest because land under
pasture recovers more slowly than slash-
and-bum land. Pasture reduces the levels of
nutrients in the soil still further. And as
ranches are considerably larger than the
average farmer’s patch, incoming seeds
have to travel much further. Ranchers tend
to exercise more control over their land and
iron out the range of microhabitats early
colonisers need. Slash-and-burn is not a
practice that should be encouraged but it is
infinitely better than ranching. D

statement to attain peace in Central
America,” according to a statement by
the Costa Rican Embassy here.

Mr. Arias opposes the idea of a mili-
tary solution in Central America,
where the United States-backed con— ‘
tras are fighting the Sandinista Gov-
ernment of Nicaragua.

As part of the ceremony Saturday,
hundredsof schoolchildren will plant
seedlings on the former airstrip, the
statement said. The'strip was built “in
late 1985 and early 1986 by associates
of Colonel North, who was dismissed
from his National Security Council poSt
in November for his role in the Iran-
contra affair. '

Using Debt to Save Nature

olivia’s commitment to
protect more than four
million acres of forest
and grasslands in the
Amazonian lowlands of
the Beni River in return
for foreign-debt relief of $650, 000 sig-
11515 'a new and promising approach to
twgof Latin America’s most pressing
p_roblems: the debt crisis and envi-
ronmental degradation. Now, it is up
to corporations, philanthropies and
public agencies, notably the World
Bank, to implement similar plans on
a larger scale, as has already been
suggested to halt widespread de-
struction of Brazil’s Amazon Basin
raih forest.

The deal with Balivia — called a
d‘ébi-' for-nature swap — works like
this. Armed with a $100, 000 donation,
Canservation International has
agreed to purchase $650, 000 of deeply
dispounted Bolivian debt, which will
then’be turned over to the Bolivians to
réti e.

For its part, Bolivia is putting to-
Se ether a public-private partnership to

evelop a program that combines
ethsystem conservation and regional
development planning in the Beni.
The newly protected land will be
zoned for a variety of uses: undis-
turbed areas for research; forest re-
Serves in which traditional hunting
and gathering by native Chimane In-
dians will still be allowed; and water-
shed‘ forests where productive, sus-
tainable forestry and agricultural
development will be encouraged.

straints. The future productivity of
soils, waters, forests and grasslands
will be protected, along with the full
variety of native plants and animals.
But this approach should not be
limited to Bolivia and a few other for-
ward-looking nations. Many cauntries
are, economically and ecologically,
living beyond their means. Heavy for-

.eign debt sometimes encourages
countries to use their resources with-'

out regard for the future. The result-
ing destruction of natural resources
undermines long-term economic and
political health and stability. Many
African nations are a long way down
that road, as are Haiti and, to a lesser
extent, El Salvador. The vicious cycle

on earth and the social and economic

choices available to the vast majority
of the world’s rural poor.

In the Beni, the Bolivians have
demonstrated overriding principles
— first, that sovereign nations must
solve their own problems. Developed
nations can help, but no amount of
money or direction from outside Will
build the national capacity and the in-
ternal commitment necessary. The
second is a recognition that econom-
ics and ecology have converged and
that the problems and solutions are
inextricably intertwined.

Mexico, Peru and Brazil all have an
exceptional abundance of biological
diversity and foreign debt. New poli-
cies and legislation are needed to en-
courage support of these and other

countries by American carporate and
philanthropic interests, private or-

ganizations, international banks and

the foreign assistance community.

The World Bank’s plan to increase
its environmental staff from 15 to 100
officers is promising. So, too, was a
recent speech in which its president,
Barber Conable, said “the problems
of natural resource degradation are
development problems” and that “we
must be bold in both the scope of our
enterprise and in testing untried
ideas.” As the holder of billions of dol-
lars of third world debt, the bank has
an important opportunity to encour-
age conservation programs while
easing the debt burden.

Beyond that, the Agency for Inter-
national Development’s $2.5 million
fund for biological diversity should be
greatly expanded. And Congress
should clarify the tax laws to permit
charitable deductions for corpora-
tions for the full face value of gifts of
foreign debt notes to international

conservation organizations.

Debt-for-nature swaps and other in-
novative financial tool51should be en-
couraged. The sum of Latin Amer-

‘ ica’s external debt plus “blocked

funds” — money belonging to multi-
national corporations being held in
foreign countries in local currencies
— probably approaches $500 billion.
Obviously, not all of this money can
be used for conservation. But the
more that can be swapped for land or
local currency to underwrite better
land management, the more the twin
problems of Latin debt and environ-
mental degradation will be reduced.
In addition, debt-for-nature swaps
offer the promise not only of better
protection of biological diversity but
also of greater hard-currency earn-
ings from tourism for nations that
preserve their natural heritage. Peo-
ple will travel in. growing numbers to
these “museums of the outdoors.”

. Whatever is done to help solve the
world’s interrelated problems of ecol-
ogy and economics, it should be done
in the context of helping sovereign na-
tions determine their own future. [3

 

THE NEW YORK TIMES, TUESDAY, JULY 21, 1987

Link Brazil’s Forests to Debt Relief

 

To the Editor:
“Let’s Not Write Off Latin Amer-

_ ica” by David Rockefeller (Op-Ed,

July 5) bristles with wisdom. It also
demands creative solutions to ease
the debt burden of Latin American
countries, Brazil in particular.

Brazil is in deep economic trouble,
with inflation climbing upward of
1,000 percent a year. Brazil’s decision

. to suspend interest payments on its

international debt a few months ago
caused a furor in banking circles
worldwide. Yet we can no more af-

' ford to write off Brazil financially

than we can afford to ignore the im-
pending ecological folly taking place
in Brazil’sAmazon Basin: the rapid
destructionof the last great tropical

.rain forest on the planet.

The coincidence of these two actions

14-— interest-payment suspension and

forest destruction -- inspires a strat-
egy to alleviate both problems simul-

, taneously. Mr. Rockefeller lays out the

justification for continued lending to
Brazil and other Latin countries. But
why not negotiate for concessions of
value to the world in exchange for
temporary financial relief?

The Brazilian Amazon Basin, the
largest ecosystem on earth, is fast

disappearing because of excessive.
cutting at an annual loss rate in thou~ .

sands of square miles. The 2.7 million
square miles of tropical forest will be
gone'within two generations.

The forest acts as a major buffer
against carbon dioxide buildup, help-
ing to inhibit the ominous “green-

house effect,” a planetary time bomb. '

The forest also acts as -a global
weather stabilizer. Proably most im-
portant, the Amazon Basin, with its
vast population of some half million
to two million animal and plant spe-
cies, equivalent to 20 percentrof all the
species on earth, could hold the key to
many of the diseases afflicting man-
kind, Should it survive long enough to
be studied adequately. After all, most
of our medicines were originally de-
rived from plants and animals. ,

A nation struggling to meet debt ob-
ligations cannot afford the luxuries of
preservation activities. National and
international financial institutions
based in the United States should ne-
gotiate a five-year suspension of
Brazilian interest payments as part

of a larger plan to provide Brazil with
the credit to become financially
healthy. Should the loss of interest be
overwhelming for some of the United
States-based debt holders, the Fed-
eral Reserve can monetize the inter-
est debt or Congress can devise legis-
lative financial relief. Neither action
will cause an inﬂationary ripple. Call

‘ it 'all smart foreign aid!

A second part of the plan requires

that Brazil work with the United

States Government and appropriate
national and international ecological
organizations to develop a system of
wildemesses, parks, wildlife refuges,

sustainable-yield forests, farms and
grazing areas in the Amazon .Basin
similar to .what has been accom-
plished in the United States. This ex-
change affords the World Bank an ops.

.portunity to make amends for the ad-

verse ecological impacts of its past
Brazilian projects.
some critics, maybe Brazilians

themselves, will call this plan a form

of imperialism or paternalism from

Last Stand

Malaysian Tribe Fights
To Preserve Forests,
Win Native Rights

Penans Attack Logger Camp,
Block Roads in Sarawak;
Local Scandal Aids Cause

 

Blowguns and Poison Darts

By JAMES P. STERBA
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL.

MARUDI, Malaysia—He wears John
Lennon spectacles and looks frail in rare
photographs. He suffers from malaria and
says he has survived three snakebites. The
few outsiders who have met him say he
talks like a naive idealist out of the
19603.

Armed with a spear and a flute, how-
ever, Bruno Manser, a 32-year-old Swiss
artist, has also roamed Sarawak’s remo-
test jungles for 2% years as a fugitive. He
has been. befriended and protected by the
region’s last known tribe of nomadic
hunters and gatherers,’ the Penans: He has,
compiled a dictionary of their language
and folk tales. And he has enlisted in their
fight to save their tropical rain-forest
homeland from logging-company chain-
saws and bulldozers.

Officials in Sarawak, a state that is
dominated by timber politics and money,
have denounced Mr. Manser as a “Com-
munist” and a “Zionist.” Malaysia’s larg-
est newspaper, the New Straits Times, rid-
iculed him in an elaborate April Fools"
Day spoof. Local environmentalists refrain
from publicly supporting him for fear of

being branded accomplices of an “outside,

agitator” and “outlaw”—his visa expired
Dec. 31, 1984.

A Bit Player

Despite his notoriety, Mr. Manser is
only a bit player. But the battle he has
joined for native rights and forest preser-
vation is taking center stage in Sarawak.

The ﬁght has escalated in . recent
months as the Penans (pronounced pee-
nahns), armed with blowguns and poison
darts, spears and a few shotguns, have
blockaded logging trails and tried to stop.
loggers from sawing down the huge tropi-
cal hardwoods—some 150 feet tall—that dot
their high-country, hunting grounds.

In April, more than 100 Penans besieged
ailumber camp near Long Layun in the up-
per Baram River watershed. Since then,
Penans have blockaded’IZ lumber roads,
preventing trucks from carrying out logs.
And members of other tribes in the region
have joined their fight. ,

State officials and the local press have
tried to play down the confrontations. But
some federal officials in Kuala Lumpur,
the Malaysian capital, are sympathetic,
possibly because of embarrassment (over a
scandal involving timber. riches accumu-
lated by politicians who rule Sarawak, the

country’s biggest but least developed

state.

 

THE WALL STREET JOURNAL WEDNESDAY, JULY 22, 1987

A Bitter Feud

The scandal broke because of a bitter
feud between the state’s chief minister,
Taib Mahmud, and his uncle, Abdul Rah-

' man Yakub, a former chief minister and

governor. The two men, who identify with

. the ethnic Malay minority here, have suc-

cessively ruled Sarawak for 17 years.
The names of the people who get timber

' concessions have long been shrouded in se-

crecy. But to score points against each
other in a state election campaign last

. spring, each man disclosed lists of who got

concessions when the other was in power.
As many suspected, the lists included
mostly political cronies, wives, daughters
and other relatives in a Marcosian web of
front companies and foreign bank ac-
counts. Lumber merchants estimate that
at current prices, 25 concessions awarded

- to Mr. Rahman’s friends and relatives are

worth more than $4.2 billion in logs.

The concessions are free, granted as po-
litical patronage. Concessionaires quietly
sell or subcontract their tracts to logging
companies, mostly owned by ethnic Chi-
nese, for under-the-table millions. The
state is then paid a royalty based on the
amount of wood extracted. The natives
who live in the forests get next to noth-
mg.

Malaysia has been the world’s biggest
exporter of tropical hardwood logs. Half go
to' Japan, and the rest go to Taiwan, South
Korea, the US. and a few other countries.
At logging rates estimated at more than
180 acres an hour, mostly in Sarawak and

Sabah on the island of Borneo, Malaysia’s

hardwoods will be gone by 1996, according
to Ismail Salleh, a university economist.
The destruction of tropical rain for-
ests—and the resulting loss of plant and
animal species—has become a cause ce-

lebre among international environmental
groups. But Brazil’s jungles and Africa’s
animals get much more attention than the
rainforests of Malaysia, Indonesia and the
Philippines.

Local environmental groups are fledg-
ling, with little influence. And local govern-
ments like to keep them that way.

With 48,612 square miles, Sarawak is a
little smaller than New York state. Some
80% of its 1.5 million people live in rural
areas. Borneo’s natives make up nearly
40% of the state’s population. They are
called Dayaks, a collective name for two

, dozen indigenous tribal groups, including

the Ibans, Bidayuhs, Kenyahs, Kayans and
Penans. Most live in communal long-
houses along rivers and were converted to
Christianity by missionaries years ago.

- Those living in up—river high country de-
pend on forests and streams for game, fish
and wild fruit, and they practice swidden,
or slash-and-burn, agriculture on hillsides.
The government says swidden farming is
destroying the forests. It has been trying to
lure its practitioners down river into mod-
ern development projects such as oil palm
and rubber plantations. .

But Evelyne Hong, a social researcher
in Penang, defends swidden farming as an
ecologically sound form of crop rotation,

. given poor forest soil. She says that it de-

stroys only 1/ 50th. of the forests that log-
ging destroys each year. After clearing
two or three acres, families practicing
swidden plant rice and vegetable crops for
one or two years and then move on, allow-
ing the soil to regain nutrients for 10 or 15
years before returning to grow another

1 food crop.
. Ironic Attack

“Ironically, this attack on swidden is

' led by planners, policy makers and bu-

reaucrats who are the very people respon-
sible for the wholesale logging of tropical
forests, causing massive erosion, depletion
of precious topsoil, ecological disruption
and climatic imbalances in the environ-

ment,” she writes in a new book, “Natives

of Sarawak: Survival in Borneo’s Vanish-
ing Forests.”

Logging damage has incensed many
Dayaks in recent years, especially since
the logging companies have moved into
precipitous mountain areas. The recent
money. revelations have fueled cries of
“Dayak nationalism” among native lead-
ers who have traditionally fought among
themselves. In April, Dayaks doubled their
number of seats in the state legislature to
15, making them the biggest single party in
the 48-member body.

Logging Site 21 of Rimbunan Hijau Tim-
ber Co. is situated about 40 miles into

Sulawesi, called “Bugis,” were happy to
take their jobs. About 1,000 Ibans and other
workers drifted back to their longhouses or

them, including Mr. Nayawai, refuse to
leave the plantation and have sued to get

The steep surrounding hillsides sport
reddish-brown cuts in all directions. They
are made by huge bulldozers that move off
the main logging road to retrieve logs, cut-
ting their own horizontal switchback. trails
into the hillsides.

Nearby residents say that the sputter-
ing chainsaws and roaring bulldozers scare
away the wild pigs, monkeys, birds and
other animals they eat. Friendly orangu-
tans are long gone. Thousands of the gen-
tle, red-haired apes used to inhabit
Sarawak’s forests. The state’s current esti-
mate is 250. -

Swift Erosion

What the bulldozers expose [is old,
crumbling sedimentary strata—sandy soil,
shale and clay layers. When exposed to
tropical downpours, which are frequent,
these layers literally dissolve. Erosion is
swift. Deep gullies appear in the trails.
Even main arteries, on which 40-ton trucks
carry 40 tons of logs each to river tugs and
barges, wash out regularly.

The eroded sediment ends up in
streams, then rivers, turning water that
was once the color of weak tea into a thick
liquid the color of coffee with too much
cream. The people who live here say that
their fish, a prime source of protein, die
and that drinking the water sometimes
makes them sick.

Despite complaints, the technique of
using bulldozers to get logs off forested
mountainsides doesn’t bother state offi-

cials. In fact, the man who pioneered the.

technique, James Wong, is a state offi-
cial—the minister for the environment and
tourism. ‘

J along Sepang is a 23-year-old Kenyah, ,

the seventh of nine children born at Long
Anap, a longhouse in hill country that has
yet to be logged. After studying for three
years at a technical institute in Kuala
Lumpur, he returned to Marudi to look for
work.

Long Anap has 30 “doors”-one-room
apartments built on stilts in a long, con-

nected row—and about 250 residents. Last ‘

December, officials from Samling Timber
Co. visited to announce that they held the
logging concession for the area and were
about to begin work. They invited the chief
of Long Anap. and chiefs of 11 nearby
longhouses—all state appointees—to a
meeting. Most of the chiefs can’t read, but
after a friendly talk, 10 of them signed or
put their thumbprints on an agreement
saying that they wouldn’t interfere with
the loggers. The agreement also bound the
chiefs not to complain or seek compensa-

 

tion for water pollution, erosion, damage to
the jungle or the disappearance of wild-
life. '

Christmas Money

In return, the timber company prom-
ised to pay small sums for any damaged
fruit, coffee and cocoa trees, provided they
once bo're fruit. The company also offered
each longhouse ' $800 annually for
Christmas celebration money.

“Two trees are worth that much,” says
Mr. Sepang, who joined the Sahabat Alam
Malaysia (Friends of the Earth) office in
Marudi, which has a staff of four to moni-
tor both SaraWak and Sabah.

Five of the chiefs say that they have
pulled out of the agreement. An “action
committee” has been formed to keep the
loggers out. Company lawyers say that
they weren’t legally bound to offer the
longhouses ' anything since they have a
valid concession from the state.

In 1973, nine Iban families—including
Sadam Nayawai, then 19 years old, his
parents and his new bride—agreed to leave
their longhouse near Binatang to partici-
pate in one of the state’s first big resettle-
ment projects. They joined some 3,000 oth-
ers in creating a 60,000-acre oil palm plan-

tation out of swampy, lowland jungle east ‘
of Bintulu along Sarawak’s north sea‘

coast.

In return for clearing the land, planting 3

 

Word of the resettlers’ plight has spread
far up the Baram River, to the longhouse
of J along Sepang and into the forests
where the Ferrari‘s", roam. Many up-river

residents have come down to the coastal "
towns, gotten laboring jobs, tasted the lux-
uries of the cash economy and stayed. But
many return to their longhouses and for-
ests. ’

The nomadic Penans travel with the
ripening cycle of wild jungle fruit. They
eat the fruit, and it attracts animals like
wild pigs, which the Penans kill with silent
blowguns and poisonous darts.

In the early 19705, a French writer
named Mady ,Villard spent time with a
four-family Penan group in their forest.
She described it this way: .

“The trees are gigantic, their trunks of-
ten covered with parasitic flowers, their
branches arching far overhead, stopping
the rays of the sun. . . . Full of Secrets and
moving colors, the atmosphere here is al-
most as in our cathedrals. . . .

“But above all, here is the kingdom of
the Penans, who circulate within it like
swift and elusive ghosts, always ready to
vanish at the smallest alarm.”

tion, each family was promised 15 acres of

productive palms, 10 acres of other crop ‘
land, housing, electricity, a clean water -.
supply and other amenities. The first;
phase took six years, during which i

able-bodied hands were paid $3 a day.
When the palms began bearing oil nuts
in 1979, the families were paid $16 a ton to
harvest them and $5 as a year-end bonus.
After the first year, the bonus stopped.

Poor soil fertility and low world palm- ,

oil prices turned the project into a money
loser. When it came time, in 1983, to give

deeds to the’ palm and crop land, the fami- ~ 135i

lies were told to wait. Last summer, plan-
tation managers cut harvesting pay to $6 a
ton. Mr. Nayawai says that he and his wife

can’t harvest enough to support his three 7
children and aging parents. “It’s bitter .

work,” he says.

In September, the plantation workers
went on strike. There were riots, and oil
palms were set on fire. Some 2,000 workers

WORLD RAINFOREST MOVEMENT

Dear Friends

Re: Blockade of logging roads by the Indigenous Peoples in
the Rainforests of Sarawak, East Malaysia

For the last three months beginning from March 1987, thousands of
indigenous peoples belonging to the Penan, Kelabit, Kayan native
communities in Sarawak have formed human barricades across logging
roads to stOp the destruction of their lands by timber companies.

The blockades have succeeded in halting logging activities in large
parts of the East Malaysian state of Sarawak which is the world's main

exporter of tropical hardwoods.

This is a historic event as it is one of the few cases in which
indigenous peoples are Standing up for their rights. The blockades
have been set up in at least 12 areas in Sarawak's timber-rich
districts of Baram and Limbang.

We hope you can respond to this development by taking any, some or all
of the following action:

i) Publicize the Sarawak blockade issue in the newspapers, magazines,
television and radio networks. If you need more information or

photographs, please let us know.

Inform NGOs, groups and interested parties of the problem.
Please make copies of this Alert for Action available to all
interested groups and individuals. If you need more materials,
please let us know.

Contact Members of Parliament or other influential people who are
sympathetic to the issue of deforestation and indigenous peoples'
rights and inform them of the problem and ask them what they can
do.

Sarawak is having major negative consequences on the environment,
causing soil erosion, pollution of the water systems and damage to the
forest resources and ecology. We understand this has caused serious
disruption to the lives and sources of livelihood of a great number of
indigenous peOples living in the forests of Sarawak.

We view this with great concern because as you know, the destruction of
the tropical forests has been identified by scientists as the greatest
environmental crisis of our age. Besides causing irreparable damage to
the forest ecosystem, it also affects the resources, the way of life and
the very surVival of the forest dwellers (Penan) in Sarawak.

We, therefore, with great respect, would like to appeal to Your Excellency
to do your best to put a stOp to the further logging of the forests,
especially since we understand that many millions of hectares of the
remaining Sarawak forests have already been given out as timber concessions
for logging.

We also hope that Your Excellency can take all available steps possible
to protect the rights and livelihood of the indigenous peoples of Sarawak
by giving them more land and forests for them to be able to continue
their livelihood."

THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR JULY 23. 1987

Animal rightiSts construct philoSophical base for their cause

Iy Keith Henderson
Stan writer of The Christian Science Monitor
Boston
OR many, the phrase “animal
rights” brings to mind protests at
universities over the use of labora-

tory animals, the sympathetic chimp in ‘

the movie “Project X” -— or even last fall’s
raids on California turkey farms by radi-
cals from the Animal Liberation Front.

Such events represent one, very public
side of the animal-rights movement. But
there’s a quieter side, too; one that sur-
faces in philo— .
sophical debate,
rather than in INTERVIEW
sidewalk pro-
tests. Philosopher Peter Singer is at the
heart of it. '

Dr Singer 13 a dark, curly-haired Aus-
tralian, and his quiet demeanor barely
hints at a bent for the revolutionary. But
his thoughts on the rights of animals have
stirred thousands and helped bring a
measure of intellectual legitimacy to a
movement once brushed aside as frivo-
lous. And such legitimacy could help lay
the groundwork for future action, both in

' the legislative realm and in the realm of
individual behavior.

through Boston recently.

His interest in animal issues
kindled when he was a gradu-

a group of vegetarians who
rejected meat-eating on ethical
grounds and began weighing-
their position against some of
his own thinking on themeaning of equal-

Shouldn’t the same stand demand cansid-

That philosophical stance led Singer to
expound the doctrine of “speciesism,” or
discrimination on the basis of species. It’s
a subject now being argued by students of

philosophy in schools
throughout the United States
and elsewhere, he says. ‘

. Steven Smith, a professor
of philosophy at Claremont—
McKenna 'College in Califor-
nia, , conﬁrms this. “Philo-
sophical and ethical inquiry
into animal rights has been re-
ceiving increased attention in
the last ﬁve years,” he says.
Not that the subject has taken
the philosophical world ‘by
storm, he cautions. Most phi-
losophers probably would not
go along with“ what Dr. Smith
calls “the more extreme point
of View,” which holds that
animals and humans should be
giVen equal moral standing.

Agency and Congress Face ClaShO Over Patentlng 01A

 

By KEITH SCHNEIDER
Special to The New York Times

WASHINGTON July 21 — Congress
is heading toward a confrontation with
the United States Patent and Trade-
mark Office over a decision to allow in-
vento'rs to patent animals produced by
genetic manipulation.

Representative Charlie Rose, a
North Carolina Democrat who is on the
l-ioixsetAgriCulture Committee, said to-
day that he was preparing legislation
to prevent the office from issuing ani-
mal patents until the moral, ethical and
economic implications were thor-
oughiy explored by Congress.

His proposal, announced at the sec-
ond of four hearings a House Judiciary

 

 

 

ing of animals, appears to have so
among members of both parties 1n
houses of Con ress. Similar legislation
is expected to introduced in the Sen-
ate.

For the moment the patent office
has put a moratorium on animal pat~
cuts, but it is making no commitment
about the future. And patent lawyers
are contending that the office has no
legal authority to deny such patents.

Last April the patent office cleared
the way for breeders to patent animals
with new traits produced by trans-
planting genes among species, touch-
ing off a debate that pitted the moral
concerns against the desires of biotech-‘
noiogy companies to protect a valnable

stibeomﬂiittee has held on the patent-1

' development.

Farmers Joining Debate I

Since then farmers have joined the
fray, ar rguing that the decision has im-
portant economic consequences. The
National Farmers Union, representing
250, 000 farmers in 22 states, testified at
the hearing today that the livestock in-
dustry could face increasing consolida-
ti0n, putting many smaller prdducers
out of business, if patents for animals
were approved. it said large corpora-
tions would control the development of
superior breeds. However, the Amer-
ican Farm Bureau Federation, the na-
tion' 3 largest farm group, argued that
patents were needed to encourage the
development of superior livestock.’

In June the patent office responded
to a requeSt from Senator Mark O. Hat-

 

 

 

eputwliaan of: Oregon, by saying
it wouidm not issue any animals patents
for the rest of the fiscal year, which
ends Sept. 30. Fifteen animal patent ap.
piications are pending at the Office. -

Of Commerce and Commissioner of

that while he was aware of strong sen
timent on Capitol Hill for extending the

ry moratorium, the patent of-

Officials in the patent office say that

legislation to impose a delay. “'lhere is

existence— as well as a “biology” or physical existence.
This would obviously apply to dogs, for instance, and to
laboratory rats as well, says Regan.
Such a stance, he says, would never justify a practice
like experimentation on animals. Singer’s “more utilitar-
approach which zeroes in on outcomes— for exam-

Singer and Regan see their movement as

Representative Robert W. Kasten—

Patent lawyers who testified before
Mr. Kastenmeier’ s subcommitttee
strongly disagreed. They said the pat-
ent office was .“morally neutral” and
never functioned as a forum for assess-
ing the consequences at introducing
new technology.

William H. Duffey, general patent
counsel to the Monsanto Corporation,
said, “It would be unthinkable for the
United States to selectively exciut
animal patents from patentable sub-

from a minority who are attacking the

only forum in which they can currently

bedeviled conservation efforts. Now,
in what many experts see as a bright

Violations remain common. Cur-

65‘percent effective worldwide,” said
Eugene Lapointe, the Canadian direc-
tor of the treaty’s small permanent
staff, based in Switzerland.

But a new frankness about treaty
infractions is an encouraging devel-
opment, said Ginette Hemley, direc-
tor of the Washington office of Traf-
fic, a private international network
that monitors international trade in
wild species.

In documents made public in Otta-
wa, the treaty staff named some 40
member countries for suspected
violations and asked them for written
explanations. Lest unnamed coun-
tries gloat, officials noted that they
could easily have listed many more.

Burundi, which has not joined Cites,
and the United Arab Emirates, which
this year became the first member to

uit it, bore the harshest judgment: a
resolution called on treaty members
to use political and economic lever-
age to persuade the two countries to
end their roles as crucial .transit
points in the movement of “contraband
ivory and rhinoceros horns to Asia.

A diplomatic mission will attempt
to visit the two countries on behalf of
the treaty ‘ powers. In addition, the.
United States Government intends to
open” ‘discussions with Burundi and
the Emirates on its own, according to

Clark R. Bavin, chief of law enforce-
ment with the United States Fish and
Wildlife Service. He would not specu~
late on what leverage, if any, might
be applied.

At the Ottawa meeting, three wild-

life-importing countries — France,
Japan and Austria .— came in for spe-
cial criticism from several delegae
tions and private groups. FranCe,
critics charged, has been lax overall
in controlling imports and has al-
lowed nearly unfettered trade- in ille-
gal products through French Guiana,
a French department in South Amer:
ica.

Anger at Being Named

Japan was attacked for importing"

largexvolumes of illegal products and
for exempting itself, as it legally can
under the treaty, from prohibitions on
the import of shells of endangered
sea turtles, glands of: musk deer and
several other items. . Austria was
criticized'for allowing a pharmaceu-
tical company to import 20 chimpan-
zees from Africa, which the treaty

staff asserted was against the rules.
France denied the charges, , the

Japanese said they were working to

improve compliance and . Austria

argued that the chimpanzee shipment

had been legal. All three eXpressed
bitter resentment at being singled
out. A resolution promoted by the
Latin American bloc to- censure the
three countries provoked the hottest

and longest debate of the two—week _

conference. With most countries ar-

guing for preservation of a “spirit of

cooperation” in the treaty, the resolu-
tion was voted down, but observers
said privately that the debate had
sent a welcome message to, all gov-
ernments. ‘ .

The decline in African elephants

quandary. African governments ob-

agreed to accept legal tusks solely.
But delegates were shocked by a
new report estimating that the Af-
rican elephant population had de-
clined by 36 percent since 1981, to

' about 764,000. The report said that
‘ more than 100,000 elephants are being

killed each year, that illegal killings
far outnumbered legal ones and that

. if the poaching persisted at this level

the species would be in danger.
The report argued, and moSt other

experts agreed, that halting the legal ,

trade would do ‘ little good, only

 

 

 

removing the incentive for better
management 'of elephants. Given the
corruption in some governments and
the strong demand for ivory, a total
ban would not work any better than it
has for the rhinoceros, said the report
by the African Elephant and Rhino
Specialist Group. - -

“We need to give the quota system
a chance,” said Perez Olindo, a senior
Kenyan wildlife official. If the value
is removed from ivory, he wondered,
will poor ' people in Africa have
enough reason to protect an' animal
that uses coveted lands?

But many governments and conser-
vation groups expressed deep con-
cern about the elephant trend. If the
illegal trade is not soon stemmed,
some experts predicted, [pressure will
build for more drastic restrictionson
trade in ivory.

Educated monkeys
help the disabled
to help themselves

Once it was regarded with skepticism, but
today a program that trains simian aides

for quadriplegics is considered a solid success

Try this: take the most comfortable chair you own into
the pleasantest room in your house, arrange it in a
convenient location and sit down. Don’t move. Wait
15 or 20 minutes for your muscles to loosen up. Relax.
Look around; take stock of your surroundings. If any
visitors walk in, you can turn your head to greet them
but you can’t stand or shake hands. You can admire the
view out your window, but you can’t crack it open for a
breath of fresh air if the room becomes stuffy or warm.
Wait another hour. Are you bored yet? Hungry?
Thirsty? Sorry, but you’ll just have to wait until some-
body happens by. Don’t worry, it shouldn’t be too long
—-probably no more than a couple of hours.

Welcome to the world of the quadriplegic, Gary
Finkle’s world ever since he was injured in a swim-
ming-pool accident seven years ago. Gary is one of an
estimated 90,000 Americans who have lost virtually all
feeling and movement below their shoulders due to
severe spinal-cord injuries. He lives with his wife,
Micki, and a female capuchin monkey named Jo in a
new home on a hilltop outside the village of Andes,
New York, about three hours north of New York City.
When I visited him there recently, Jo was perched pro-
tectively on the back of his wheelchair.

enterprise called Helping Hands: Simian Aides for the
Disabled. The nonproﬁt organization supplies quad-
riplegics with trained capuchins that increase their
self-reliance and reduce their dependency on friends
and family or hired attendants. Shortly after it started
up eight years ago, Helping Hands received a spate of
publicity in newspapers, magazines and on television.
By now it has long since progressed from the novelty
stage to become a proven success that makes a real
difference in the lives of the people it serves.

Just look at Gary and Jo. Gary uses his mouth to
control a small laser-pointer mounted on his wheel-
chair. ‘Vith it, he directs Jo to open and shut doors,
turn lights on or off, change books or magazines in
a reading stand or audiotapes in a cassette player. She
brings him prepared snacks and drinks from the re-
frigerator and clears away empties. She will even feed
him. On command, Jo fetches the remote control for
Gary’s TV, placing it on the chair where he can ma-
nipulate it with his mouthstick. The mouthstick is a
quadriplegic’s primary tool. It is used for practically
everything: turning the pages of a book, dialing the
telephone, changing channels on the TV, working at
a typewriter or computer. If Gary’s mouthstick drops
to the ﬂoor, Jo will retrieve it and gently reinsert it
into his mouth. “I deﬁnitely cannot imagine living
withouther,” he says.

years. She has become so fully integrated into their

about what she does but about who she is, her person-
ality and style. “She’s smarter than we give her credit
for,” Gary ventures fondly. “Sometimes she’s too
smart,” adds Micki, who once located a missing tube
of lipstick hidden in Jo's cage: she’d apparently found
the stuff quite tasty.

“The main thing is independence,” Gary reflects.
He knows that he will always need human assistance
for such things as getting in and out of bed, bathing or
changing his clothes. But having Jo measurably lessens
his reliance on Micki, enabling her to work afternoons
in town without worrying about her husband’s wel-
fare. Above and beyond Jo’s obvious utility, Gary
prizes her companionship. “She's a constant source of
entertainment,” he marvels, “and she just keeps get-
ting smarter. The more she’s exposed to, the more she
learns. I want to teach her to play backgammon.”

Heavyset and bearded, with a mane of curly black
hair, Gary came to Helping Hands by way of New
York’s Rusk Institute, a renowned rehabilitation cen-
ter. “It seemed like a great challenge,” he recalls. “I’ve
been around animals all my life and I guess I just
thought this would be fun.” Nowadays Jo goes almost
everywhere with him, indoors and out, on social calls
or forays to the local tavern. Wherever they go they
draw attention. “I’ve certainly met people I wouldn’t
have met without her,” Gary says. When I ask if a
robot might not one day be able to do many of the jobs
Jo does for him now, Gary answers, “Robots won’t
play with you. They won’t jump around your living
room or wrestle with the dogs. They won’t comb your
hair and beard with their hands or sit on the laser,
chewing at your face. A robot would be pretty dull.”

On the sixth floor of Abraham Mazer Hall at the
Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, the
corridor resounds with shrieking chirrups and trills.
Ringing bells punctuate a hubbub of hollers and
howls, weird catcalls and cries, crashes, claps and
bangs. The cinder-block walls are dull institutional
yellow; the floor is faded linoleum. What little furni-
ture there is appears to have taken quite a beating.
Windows are missing from the doors to several oﬂices
and have been replaced with wire mesh. If the place
looks a bit disheveled, there is good reason. Here, in
cubicles where medical students once crammed for
exams, “organ-grinder monkeys” are learning to help
the handicapped. “VVe’re very lucky to be here,” Dr.
Mary Joan Willard tells me as we step from the ele-
vator to be greeted by a chattering capuchin chorus.
An assistant professor of rehabilitation medicine at
Einstein, VVillard—who is called M. J. by just about
everyone—is the founder and director of Helping
Hands. “People kill for space at this institution,” she
explains. “If we weren‘t here, we’d probably be down
in the basement or someplace awful.”

In 1977, \Villard was a postdoctoral fellow in psy-
chology at Tufts New England Medical Center in Bos-
ton. There she befriended a 23-year-old quadriplegic
who was paralyzed from the neck down. Visiting him,
she confronted the central fact of paralysis: utter de-
pendence. There was practically nothing he could do
without help. “As a psychologist,” she says. “I was
obsessed with the notion that there had to be some way
to increase his independence.”

Willard had spent three years as a research assistant
to B. F, Skinner, the eminent psychologist at Harvard
University whose research pioneered the still contro—
versial theories of behavior modiﬁcation. It occurred
to her thatiSkinner’s reward-and-punishment tech-
niques might be used to train primates to assist the
disabled. “I was literally lying in bed one night when
it hit me," she remembers. “Why not use chimps?"
Chimpanzees, it emerged, had some practical draw-
backs: they grow to be nearly as big as peOple and a
good deal stronger, and adult chimps are prone to
fractiousness. But Skinner thought the scheme had
merit and suggested capuchins instead. Mature capu-
chins weigh roughly five pounds and stand less than
18 inches tall. They respond well to training and form
loyal bonds with humans. After a preliminary investi-
gation. Willard resolved to proceed. Armed with a
small grant from Tufts Medical School. she purchased
a quartet of laboratory-bred Cebus albifrons. and
Helping Hands was on its way.

After removing'drink from refrigerator, Jo takes off
cap and inserts a tube for Gary Finkle to use as a straw.

The godmother of simian aides, M. J. Willard is a
slim, small brunette who looks a decade younger than
her 36 years. Her manner is direct and informal. When
she convenes a lunchtime meeting in her ofﬁce, every—
one sits on the ﬂoor. Present are Alison Pascoe, Lauren
Westbrook and Alice Levee. the three young women
who form the core of the training staff at Einstein.
Other key staffers are not based in New York. David
Taylor, a high school science teacher from Byﬁeld,
Massachusetts, coordinates the “foster family” net-
work which places infant capuchins in human homes
before they're ready for training. Judi Zazula, a bio—
medical engineer in Boston, oversees the actual place-
ment of monkeys and screens disabled applicants to
check their suitability for inclusion in the program.
Her partner, Doug Ely, a physicist with Arthur D.
Little Inc., designs and constructs much of the spe—
cialized equipment the project requires.

On the agenda this noon are a review of current
training and an evaluation of the volunteer trainers,
14 in all, most of them undergraduates at nearby Ford-
ham University. Alison’s pet capuchin, Amelia, nestles
in my lap. “You’d never know how mean she was,
would you?” Alison chuckles as Amelia attempts to
relieve me of my pen. Amelia is a Cebus apella, a spe-
cies of the genus Cebus that is considered more trac-

i‘able and relaxed than the perpetually antic albifrons.
The ﬁrst monkey permanently placed with a quadri-
plegic was an albifrons, but the seven placed since have
been calmer apella/albifrons hybrids. All but one of
the simian aides thus far have been females, who are
less aggressive, have fewer bad habits and seem to form
stronger bonds than males.

Until recently, most of the animals obtained by
the program have been adults with checkered pasts.
Some are cast-off pets or zoo monkeys, others veterans
of laboratory experimentation. A capuchin named
Freeway was found loping alongside an interstate. As
Helping Hands has gained visibility it has become
known as a safe haven for refugee monkeys, but Alison
notes some problems in working with animals from
unknown backgrounds. “We never have any idea how
they’ve been treated,” she says. Cleo, for instance, a
candidate for placement with a young cerebral-palsy
victim, arrived at Einstein introverted and malnour-
ished. As Alice Levee observes, “It’s hard to expect
food-motivated behavior from an anorexic animal.”

While older animals will still be accepted, young
monkeys, many of them born at the Mannheimer Pri-
matological Foundation in Florida where Helping
Hands has established a breeding colony, will consti-
tute the majority in the future. Four of the six animals
now at Einstein were raised speciﬁcally for Helping
Hands, and another 25 or so are currently living with
foster families. Foster care commences immediately
after weaning, at six to eight weeks. Three years later,
when the monkeys reach maturity, their teeth are ex
tracted to guard against the chance that they might
wound so same with a bite. Then they are ready for

six months or so of training. The animals are trained
as early as possible in order to prolong their useful life
after placement. They live for about 30 years.

Down the hall in a battered training room a monkey
named Marylin is burning off some excess energy. She
vaults from table to chair to wardrobe to windowsill to
chair, ﬂicking the lights on and off, repeatedly testing
the knob of the ﬁrmly locked door, yowling and cheep-
ing and making faces. “She’ll settle down,” Alison
promises, and soon enough she does. I sit immobile in
a wheelchair, playing the role of a quadriplegic, as
Alison puts the capuchin through her paces. After
spending several months with a 54-year-old quadri-
plegic man in New Jersey, Marylin has returned to
Einstein for a refresher course. “Change, Marylin,”
Alison instructs. “Change.”

Marylin enjoys her sticky treat

With a laser-pointer the trainer indicates a magazine
in a plastic binder on a shelf, which Marylin, after a
brief hesitation, crosses the room to collect. She carries
it to a nearby reading stand, removes the binder al-
ready on the stand and puts the new one in its place,
clapping a steel washer attached to the binder onto a
round magnet atop the reading stand. Alison rings a
bell, signifying success, and Marylin scoots over to my
chair for her reward-a sip of sticky, strawberry-ﬂa-
vored Nutrament—which I dispense by blowing into a
plastic tube mounted beside my headrest. The tube
descends into a bottle ﬁxed to the chair’s frame. Blow-
ing into it forces a thimbleful of liquid into a cup in
the bottle’s cap, which Marylin greedily licks clean.

Whenever a monkey properly executes an assign-
ment it receives a reward. If the task is not completed,
or is done incorrectly, the reward is denied. An aston-
ishing range of behaviors can be instilled using this
system. The monkeys learn to respond to verbal com-
mands like “Fetch” or “Change,” as well as visual cues
from the laser~pointer. Complex activities, such as
bringing food and feeding, are subdivided into dis-
crete tasks so that the animal’s abilities expand as the
components of a procedure are linked.

Trainers may bestow rewards in the form of a bit of
peanut butter dabbed onto a ﬁnger, but quadriplegics
use mouth-activated dispensers, either the liquid type
or a sort of carousel loaded with pelletized chow. Nega-
tive reinforcement is administered by way of a tiny
battery-powered backpack which can deliver a slight
electric shock—Alison compares it to the static charge
sometimes generated by touching a metal doorknob—
should the monkey misbehave. Capuchins are endless-
ly curious and their natural inquisitiveness is what
often gets them into trouble.

Willard remembers one early placement that had a

tendency to “tear up the house” when she wasn’t work-
ing. The solution to‘ that was the shockpack, used in
conjunction 'with little white circular stickers called
coding dots. The animal quickly learned to associate
the dots with an imminent shock and henceforth
avoided touching anything with a sticker afﬁxed to it.
In practice, quadriplegics seldom shock their monkeys
and some abandon the shock-pack altogether.

prominent features of their owners’ households. Un-
like most children, the monkeys will go to their
“rooms” on. command and obediently close the door
behind them.‘ They are housebroken, having. been
taught to eliminate only in their cages, but they occa-
sionally make mistakes. Capuchins tend to be fastidi-
ous. “In general, they’re very clean,” Alison reports.
“Some of them don’t even like to eat bananas because
they don’t want to get their hands dirty. You have to
wrap the fruit in napkins."

The animals are formidably bright. They can mas-
ter new tasks in a single half-hour training session and
once a procedure is learned, their performance relia-
bility is close to 100 percent. When researchers were

working on a new “toilet-training” technique, they de-
vised a sort of Stovepipe contraption with an electric
eye in its base. After a monkey defecated into the pipe,
the feces dropped through the optical beam and trig-
gered dispensation of a sweet reward. One day the
trainer left a capuchin alone with the device for 15
minutes and returned to discover that the electric eye
had been tripped dozens of times. The animal had dis-
covered that by dangling a strip of its bedding down
the pipe it could gain an endless supply of rewards.
More than once in its formative years, Helping
Hands came close to shutting down. Even after the

initial experiments proved promising, 38 potential '
sponsors refused “Tillard’s requests for ﬁnancial help[

oﬂicial there told her, “Look, this is a fantastic idea
and if it works, great. But if it doesn’t work you’re go-
ing to get the Golden Fleece award, and we don’t want
to be funding you when you get it.” The agency even-
tually went on to become the project’s principal
backer, but it was the Paralyzed Veterans of America
that really got things going by awarding Willard her
ﬁrst major grant, late in 1979.

Sometimes pure good fortune seems to have inter-
vened. The American Society of Rehabilitative Medi-
cine rejected VVillard’s scientiﬁc paper on simian aides,
but then mistakenly printed the abstract in its pro-
ceedings anyway. A ﬂood of inquiries resulted. Willard
developed a knack for public relations. “I’ve always
known this project was borderline crazy in terms of
people’s perceptions of it,” she says, “so I’ve learned to
capitalize on its sexiness. I feel a little guilty about
that but it works.”

Though she admits to some frustration over the
constant grind of fund raising, Mllard ﬁnds some sol~
ace in history. After all, she points out, training guide
dogs to lead the blind did not begin in earnest until a
century after the idea was ﬁrst proposed in 1819. Even
today, only ﬁve percent of all blind persons use Seeing
Eye dogs. “We expect to be placing ten to 20 animals
a year soon, and expanding from there,” she predicts.

Requests for helpers exceed supply

On the sixth ﬂoor of Mazer Hall, using mostly
begged and borrowed equipment, the Helping Hands
staff has just ﬁnished videotaping the entire training
process. Along with a 108-page instructional manual,
these tapes should go a long way toward helping others
replicate Helping Hands’ success. Already, rehabilita-
tion centers in Canada, Argentina and Israel have ini-
tiated simian-aide programs of their own. In this
country, requests for capuchin aides far outstrip the
available supply. Willard has received more than 600
inquiries from quadriplegics or their families.

Some rehabilitation specialists argue that simian
aides will be appropriate for only a fraction of the
nation’s disabled, and that research money might be
better directed to other areas such as robotics. Willard
disagrees. “\Ve’re training the animals to do some
things that will be very difﬁcult for robots to accom-
plish,” she says. “Monkeys aren’t for everyone, but
dollar for dollar I can’t think of. anything that will
have a greater positive impacton a quadriplegic’s
life.” Monkeys are “all over their owners,” says Alison
Pascoe, “kissing and touching and exploring, and I
think that’s terribly meaningful.”

Judi Zazula, who’s been associated with Helping
Hands almost from its inception, conducts an exhaus-
tive evaluation of every applicant to the program.
“Not all quadriplegics are super people,” she says. “A
lazy person before an accident will likely be a lazy
paralyzed person.” Zazula looks for people who are
interested and energetic, and who have the kinds of
particular needs that monkeys can help meet.

Quadriplegics need special equipment in order to
work well with their monkeys. The feeding tray, for
instance, is an apparatus ﬁtted with attachments and

receptacles exactly matched to the drink bottles and
food holders a quadriplegic will use. Now made of
nearly indestructible molded plastic, earlier models
were fashioned from Plexiglas, cardboard and duct
tape. “We use off-the-shelf components whenever we
can,” Doug Ely tells me, “but some things have to be
specially made.” The socket into which a sandwich
holder ﬁts looks vaguely familiar. As well it might, Ely
conﬁrms. It’s a modiﬁed vacuum-cleaner crevice tool.

Given her professional expertise, Judi Zazula might
be expected to focus on Helping Hands’ more prag-
matic aspects: the ways in which capuchins can help
disabled people accomplish basic tasks. But like every-
one else I spoke with, she seems most profoundly af-
fected by the monkeys’ impact on the quality of the

quadriplegics’ lives. As part of the research for her ‘

master’s thesis she watched people react to a quadri-
plegic in a shopping center. When he was alone, only
two strangers approached the young man to talk in the
course of an hour. When he was accompanied by his
capuchin, 71 passersby paused to chat. Says Zazula,
“Giving a quadriplegic a monkey makes him an ‘ex-
pert’ on something that fascinates able-bodied peo-
ple.” Sue Strong puts it this way: “When I go outdoors
in my wheelchair, all that people see is the wheelchair.
But when I go out with my monkey, the only thing
they see is the monkey. Nobody notices the chair at all.”

Sue Strong is an attractive 35-year-old woman with
an engaging grin, swept-back chestnut hair and partial
movement in her upper right arm. Fifteen years ago
she was on her way West for a summer of fun when the
steering wheel of the van in which she was riding sepa-
rated from the steering column. The vehicle crashed
and rolled, and Sue Strong awoke to the world of
quadriplegia. She lives in a rent-controlled apartment
on Manhattan’s East Side. Her quarters are airy and
light, eclectically decorated, hung with posters and
art. Part-time attendants see to most of Sue’s daily
needs; her only fulLtime companion is a female capu-
chin named Henri, short for Henrietta. “Having her
has completely changed my life,” Sue says. “Before, I
had to depend on people coming in to work, and worry
about whether or not they’d show up on time. Now, if
I’m up in my chair and feeling OK, Henri and I can
get along ﬁne on our own.”

When Strong drops her mouthstick, she quietly says
“Mouth, Henri. Mouth!” The capuchin searches until
she locates the lost tool, then hops deftly up and re-
turns it to Sue’s mouth. “\Ve’ve had to learn how each
other thinks,” says Site. “I have to be careful not to ex-
pect too much. I, forget that she can’t read my mind.”

Henri is dispatched to .the kitchen for a sandwich.
She returns with the food and positions it in the holder
on the‘feedi'ng tray so that Sue can eat, but she can’t
quite resist, trying a small bite for herself. Instantly,
she realizes she’s screwed up, and almost before her
owner gives the command she rushes yowling into her
cage. “Door, Henri!” Sue intones with mock sternness.
Henri yanks the door closed, then peers anxiously out,
awaiting a reprieve. It is not long in coming.

“Oh, all right,” Sue concedes, laughing as she guides
her chair over to liberate the keening capuchin. Freed,
Henri directly curls up on her mistress’ ankles, craning
her neck to gaze up at Sue, the very picture of contri-
tion. Sue laughs out loud. “Look at that, will you!”
she says. “A face only a mother could love.”

At Einstein training facility, Alison Pascoe teaches
future “helping hand” to get objects indicated by laser.

Henri gives her mistress’ ﬁnger a squeeze. Such
touching moments endear monkeys to their owners.

Fear Hurricane M

 

1: By MALCOLM w. BROWNE

 

URRICANE Gilbert may
have destroyed the only
known breeding habitat of
the most endangered of all

sea turtle species, naturalists re-
ported yesterday. '

The 15-mile stretch of beach on
Mexico’s northern Gulf coast where
Kemp’s Ridley sea turtles lay their
eggs was directly in the path of the
hurricane’s center. According to Pat-
rick Burchfield, curator of reptiles at

the Gladys Porter Zoo in Brownsville, .

Tex, Kemp’s Ridley (Lepidochelys
kempi) turtles are so attached to this
spot that its destruction could seal the
extinction of the species.

“At this point,” he said, “we don’t
know whether the,30-foot-wide beach
at the Rancho Nuevo Sanctuary can
still be used for turtle nesting or not.
But’if it has been as badly damaged
aegwe fear, the consequences for
these animals is likely to be severe.”

I m‘portance of Narrow Beach

The reason Kemp’s Ridley turtles
nest only at Rancho Nuevo beach is
not known. Scientists speculate that a
narrow beach like this one is essential
if baby turtles are to survive the
scorching heat of the sun as they
make their run for the water after
hatching. Nearby steep sand dunes
alsoappear to be essential to the nest-
ing pfatterh when mothers dig their
18-inch egg-clutch burrows. Scientists

believe this beach also has other so—
far undetermined qualities essential
to the nesting turtles.

Naturalists cannot plan strategy on
behalf of the turtles until they deter-
mine whether Hurricane Gilbert de-
stroyed the beach irreparably or not.
Mr. Burchfield said he would charter
an airplane to try to land there and in-
Specj the turtle nesting area in the
next few days.

 

33’

Baby Kemp’s Ridley sea turtles making their way toward the Gulf of Mexico at Rancho Nuevo, Mexico.

‘.Lai‘gely because of human preda-
tionnthe world population of Kemp’s
Ridley turtles has declined cata-
str -_’cally. During one day alone in
194 , naturalists counted more than
40,000-female turtles coming ashore
to nest at Rancho Nuevo. During the
past two years, however, only some
500 turtles have come ashore during
an entire season.

An adult Kemp’s Ridley has a shell
diameter of about 32 inches and may
weigh as much as 85 pounds. Ashore,
the “ turtles' predators include
humans, coyotes, coatimundis,
skunks, vultures and many other ani—
mals. The turtle’s habitat is believed
to be largely restricted to the Gulf of
Mexico.

Effort to Protect Species

In 1978, wildlife experts from the
United States and Mexico began a
joint project to try to save the dwin-
dling species. The Mexican Govern-
ment created a breeding sanctuary

for the turtles at Rancho Nuevo due
east of Via Aldama, bounded on the
north by Barra Ostiones and on the
south by Barra del Tordo.

In the breeding season, which ex—
tends from early April to the first
week in September, a detachment of
Mexican marines guards the site
against‘poachers. A dozen American
and Mexican biologists and a contin-
gent of volunteers from both coun-
tries have also worked at the site
each breeding season for the past
decade to improve the turtles’ repro-
duction rate.

When a female turtle digs her nest
in a sand dune to lay about 100 eggs,
the chances are that the nest, if left
unguarded, may be visited as often as
twice a night by predators, Mr.
Burchfield said. The female leaves
and heads out to sea the moment her
last egg has been laid and the clutch
has been buried.

It is impossible for the volunteers
and other conservationists to guard

each nest during an incubation period
lasting up to 52 days. To protect the
eggs, the volunteers remove themﬂall,
sometimes White the mother turtle is
still laying, and transfer them to
nests in a nearby coral guarded by
the marines.

This year’s crop of baby turtles
successfully hatched and crawled to
relative safety in the Gulf of Mexico
during the first week of September,
and thus escaped Hurricane Gilbert.
The danger, Mr. Burchfield said, is
that when adult females return next
year, they may fail to find their famil-
iar nesting site and may thus be un-
able to reproduce. They may lack the
wit and energy to look for alternative
beaches to the north or south, and
thus fail to make any nests at all.

Although these turtles range
throughout the Gulf of Mexico, they
return each year to the same beach,
much as spawning salmon return to
the same rivers.

The New York Times/ Sept. 20, 1988
Narrow beach at Rancho Nuevo is “an

'- ; Hes, _

the only regular nesting site of
Kemp’s Ridley turtle.

 

The United States Fisheries and
Wildlife Service and other federal
and state agencies of the United
States and Mexico, as well as the
Gladys Porter 200, have tried to
create new breeding areas. Accord-
ing to Jack B. Woody, national sea
turtle coordinator of the Fish and
Wildlife Service in Albuquerque,
NM, conservationists have tried to
establish a new nesting beach for
Kemp’s Ridley turtles on the Texas
resort of Padre Island.

Each year, scientists remove 2,000
eggs from the guarded nests on the
Mexican coast and place them in
nests dug by human hands on Padre
Island National Seashore hear Cor-
pus Christi, Tex. By hatching baby
turtles at Padre Island, conservation-
ists hope the babies will be “imprint-
ed” by their infant impression of the
place, and will return there to nest
after reaching maturity. This would
offer an alternative breeding site to
Rancho Nuevo. But none of the babies
have yet matured, so naturalists do
not yet know how the experiment will
turnout.

“We know that every year the
gravid females swim right past
Padre Island, but for some reason,
very few of them ever come ashore to
nest,” Mr. Woody said. “We don’t
know why, but we think baby turtles
may be imprinted by their surround-
ings at the time they hatch. When

(over)

 




(continued)

they reach sexual maturity, perhaps
20 years later, something draws them
back to the same place. That place is
Rancho Nuevo.”

Speculation on Reasons

Naturalists speculate that the tur-
tles may be imprinted by some chem-
ical peculiarity of the water, or the
earth’s geomagnetic field at that
spot, or perhaps even the size of sand
particles on the beach.

JBesides the experimental turtle im-

‘Tirinting program at Padre Island,
conservationists have established a
captive breeding program in the Cay-
man Islands, but scientists say the
latter program could never become
self-sustaining, because turtles will
never return to the Caymans to nest.

During the decade after World War
II, the main threat to Kemp’s Ridley

urtles was the gathering and eating

f turtle eggs by humans.

“During that period,” Mr. Woody
said, “the turtle population fell badly.
Mexico eventually moved to protect
the nesting beach, but then shrimp
fishing became a major economic
factor in the Gulf, and many Kemp’s
Ridleys were caught and killed by
mistake by the trawlers.” Conse-
quently, Kemp’s Ridley turtles have
sustained two major catastrophes,
and the hurricane could finish them
off, he said.

Moreover, shrimp fishing still kills
many of the animals, Mr. Woody said,
despite the invention of “turtle ex-
cluder devices” that deflect turtles
from entrapment. “The shrimpers
claim that these devices also spill 'out
a lot of shrimp and they don’t like
using them,” Mr. Woody said.

“Of all the endangered species
throughout the world,” he said,
“these turtles are in a particularly
precarious position. We don’t know
the minimum number of turtles the
species requires tosurvive, but we
gnust be getting close to that num-

er.”

‘David and Goliath’ to clash
over beavers linked to VSE

A rural lawyer and a Washington law firm will square off in
court later this year over the bizarre goings-on at a beaver
ranch in Montana that formerly had its shares listed on the

Vancouver Stock Exchange.

Montana County Attorney John Robinson of Ravalli sees him-
self as David pitted against Goliath in the person of Roger Gal-
vm, the Washington, D.C., lawyer who is acting for People For
the Ethical Treatment of Animals, an animal rights lobby with

250,000 members.

:The two will lock horns in November over a felony theft

charge that the county has laid against PETA activist and em-

ployee Jeanne Roush. She is alleged
to have kidnapped several hundred
beavers from a fur ranch in Ste-
vensville, Mt.

It is the first time a PETA mem-
ber has been charged, a spokesman
for the Washington group said.

The Stevensville ranch had a his-
tory’of abusing its charges, as had
at least one other beaver operation
run by International Domesticated
Furs Ltd., a company headed by
Dennis Crum of Fresno, Calif.

IDF was listed on the VSE where
its shares last traded for 5 cents in
December, 1987. That’s a far cry
from the assigned value of $2.60 a
share that debtholders agreed to
when they converted $1-million of
debt into stock in 1984.

From the begining, IDF needed
capital, which was always coming
but never arrived. Just over a year
ago, it talked about choosing be-
tween two financing options to meet
needs of $3-million
(U.S.).

IDF began as a junior mining
company that got into the fur busi-
ness in 1984 to breed beavers for
their pelts. Four years ago, it an-
nounced a four-year plan to expand
its herd to 10,000 from 620.

In 1985, when it said it had raised
enough money to feed its charges
for 90 days, a Vancouver business
writer wondered what would happen
when the money ran out.

“We can get a chain saw, go into
the woods and chop down some
trees because beavers eat bark.”

Mr. Crum said at the time. But that
didn’t happen. Instead, the beavers
starved.

IDF ran out of money not once,
but on several occasions, which led
to bouncing pay cheques for its
employees at the ranch, a shortage
of feed for the beavers and death for
hundreds of the animals.

This past March, the VSE delist-
ed IDF for failing to file a basic
corporate document. Its shares
were suspended from trading on
Dec. 16 after changing hands for
prices as high as 63 cents (Cana-
dian) in 1987 and 90 cents in 1985.

The delisting preceded by several
days the company’s conviction and
fine on two charges of cruelty to
animals. dating from the death of
200 beavers last fall. The animals
starved because IDF was no longer
paying for feed.

At that time, Mr. Robinson ob-
tained a court order to allow the
local humane society to look after
the beavers. That in turn led to
charges and, in March. a misde-
meanor conviction for cruelty to
animals. -

The company was ordered to pay
a $500 (U.S.) fine and $4,400 expens-
es to the humane society that fed
the animals — although Mr. Robin-
son wondered at the time where the
money would come from.

That was the second charge-
against IDF. In January, 1986, the
Humane Society of Utah investigat-

 

Beavers iy- thehundreds

ed a complaint about a subsidiary
that ran a beaver farm in Orem,
Utah. _

Between 100 and 200 beavers
starved and charges were laid. The
company and its local manager
were placed on probation. Charges
against Mr. Crum were dropped
because he “was only a money
man” and had no say in running the
farm, the Utah prosecutor said in
1986.

In early June, reports about bea-
vers starving at the IDF farm in
Montana began to circulate. Ms
Roush, director of research and
investigations for PETA, was on the
scene by June 6 and began feeding
the-animals, cleaning their pens and
arranging for the worst cases to be
killed.

“It’s the most disgusting situation
we’ve ever seen,” she said on the
day she arrived. Beavers are not
carnivores, yet there was evidence
they had been gnawing each other.
The animals need water to live, yet
the fresh water system had broken.
Beavers are naturally clean, but the
pens were filthy.

A friend wrote that the impact of ‘

all this on Ms Roush was that she
“suffered immeasurably . . . hav-
ing to deal with animals that were
so distressed.”

According to reports in local
papers, PETA members soon
brought cages on to the ranch; by
June 9, nobody but members were

welcome on the site. By June 14
(and perhaps as early as the 11th),
about 200 beavers were gone.

There was an initial spurt of
beaver sightings in the area, but
several days later local police were
quoted as saying that PETA had
rented two cars - one had been
found “full of beaver hair, drop-
pings and odor” in Cheyenne, Wyo.,
and the other had been found in
similar condition in Portland, Ore.

Charges against Ms Roush fol-
lowed. Part of Montana’s case says
the beavers belonged to two compa-
nies, Pan Orient Ltd., a B.C.,compa-
ny that lent IDF $300,000 (Cana-
dian), and Lake Milling Inc., a
Montana company that held some
IDF shares and provided feed to the
ranch.

Lake Milling sued Ms Roush last
week, adding a civil case to the
criminal charge.

PETA has tried, unsuccessfully,
to untangle the corporate relation-
ships, Mr. Galvin said. A Washing-
ton spokesman said it is also trying
to find out why the VSE ' does not
take any responsibility for its listed
companies. .

Meanwhile, IDF is about to rise
again. Robert Bennett, president of
Hollyburn Development Corp. of
Vancouver, said his company has
put $100,000 into IDF, is reorganiz-
ing it and wants to have the stock
traded again on the VSE, perhaps
under another name.

There will be new financing, cred-

. itors of IDF will convert their debt

into equity, the old company will be
merged into an eXisting VSE shell
and the beavers — an uncertain
number, but more than 200 — will
be brought to Canada in November,
Mr. Bennett said. .

In California, Mr. Crum is in-
volved in personal bankruptcy pro-
ceedings.

MR - RICHARD
Leakey, the chair-

said in Nairobi
yesterda the Minis-
ter for ourism and
Wildlife, Mr George
Muhoho, had re—
ceived a confidential
document. listing
officials involved in
poaching and illegal
trade in ivory.

The document, Mr
Leakey told The Standard
in an exclusive interview,
was compiled by ofﬁcials in
the ministry and presented
to the. minister about a

month ago.

“I am reliably informed that the
matter is being investigated by the
police and as such it is the minister
who should name names. I am not
in a position to give out the names
since I am not in a position to
defend myself." he said.

“I know that the minister ot a
copv of the document. I di not
get 'one." Mr Leakey told The
Standard.

‘ Mr Leakey, who is the director
of the National Museums of
Kenya, was reacting to the chal-
lenoe by Mr Muhoho to name any
hi . or low-ranking tpersons in-
vo ved in poaching o elephants.

The minister, who spoke to The

Bohemians awaken

to poisoned fish

THE AUTHORITIES in Western
Bohemia, Czechoslovakia, have belat-
edly banned the consumption of
contaminated ﬁsh caught in an area of
about 2000 square kilometres. Scientists
discovered six months before the ban that
the ﬁsh contained up to 10 times the
permitted level of polychlorinated
biphenyls (PCBs), which are carcinogenic.
Health workers in the town of Pribram,
about 65 kilometres southwest of Prague,
say that the PCBs came from an
unidentiﬁed industrial leak in October
1986. Almost two-and-a-half years after the
accident, veterinary workers at a laboratory
in Liberec measured between 0-3 and 289
milligrams of PCBs per kilogram of ﬁsh
ﬂesh from the area.
The maximum level permitted is 0-3
milligrams per kilogram of ﬁsh ﬂesh.
According to Frantlsek Reiser, of the

Central Committee of the Bohemian
Anglers’ Association, the disaster will cost
the Czechoslovaks dearly in lost revenue.

In the Orlik reservoir on the Vltava river,
the largest expanse of water affected, “we
catch about 80 per cent of all barbel ﬁsh in
the republic”, said Reiser. He also warned
that many of the contaminated ﬁsh will by
now have migrated elsewhere.

Some spec1es of ﬁsh are particularly
contaminated. Barbel and bream have the
highest concentrations of the pollutants
because they graze near the river bottom
where the chemicals collect. Pike also have
high levels because they eat ﬁsh that are
already contaminated. -

_ The fact that PCBs steadily accumulate

 

stable for decades. D

Florida Panther Undergoes Surgery

I GAINESVILLE, Fla—An endangered Florida
panther, believed to be one of only five surviving at
Everglades National Park, underwent surgery to fix
its mangled leg, state wildlife experts said.

“She was hit by a vehicle. She lost a lot of blood,”
said Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commis-
sion Lt. Jim Hoffstodt. The 60-pound cat was spot-
ted limping by a passer-by who called officials Sat-
urday.

About 30 to 50 Florida panthers, shy and noctur-
nal brown cats, remain in the state. The injured fe-
male is one of five in the Everglades park that have
been tagged with radio collars. Officials said the
collar saved her life.

JAPAN ENVIRONMENT MONITOR, Vol. 1, No. 5 8/31/88

Smuggled Caiman Skins
Correspond to 130,000
Animals
To Japan from South America via
Thailand

Fringed Export [Permits

South American spectacled

caiman skins have been smuggled '

out of South American to
Southeast Asia, and then improp-
erly imported into Japan in con—
siderable quantity through normal
channels, sometimes with forged
export papers, revealed a TRAF-
FIC Japan investigation on
August 25. The spectacled
caiman is a species which has
shown a serious decline due to the
capture of large numbers of the
animals. In particular, the skins
imported to Japan via Thailand
from January through July of this
year come to approximately
46,500 kg, corresponding to
127,000 animals, most of which
are considered to have been
smuggled. In addition to forged
export permits, there were partic-
ularly serious instances in which
fake telex messages supposedly
from Thai government Officials
were sent to the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry
(MITI), which performed pre-
import veriﬁcation. There is evi-
dence of a large international
smuggling syndicate aiming for
the Japanese market. Beginning
on September 1, MITI will beef
up its monitoring system in order
to stop the illegal import of spec-
tacled caiman skins at customs.

 

TRAFFIC Japan
Press Release

25 August, 1988

THAILAND BEHIND MASSIVE
ILLEGAL TRADE IN
SOUTH AMERICAN ALLIGA-
TOR SKINS TO JAPAN

Over the last seven months, a Thai
connection has been used to move tens
of thousands of South American caiman
(alligator) skins into Japan in a series of
transactions involving stolen, forged, or
otherwise illegal documents in violation of
the Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species (CITES), an inter-
national treaty which regulates trade in
protected animal and plant species
throughout the world.

TRAFFIC Japan, the wildlife trade
monitoring arm of the World Wide Fund
for Nature (WWF), launched an investi-
gation into the trade when Japanese
Customs data shown a sudden and inex-
plicable increase in alligator skin imports

from Thailand. At least 46 tonnes of
caiman skins, representing well over
120,000 animals, have entered Japan
between January and July 1988 from
Thailand. This figure represents a 20-
fold increase in the normal annual alliga—
tor skin trade between the two countries
and is greater than the total of all imports
received from Thailand over the last 25
yearsl

Although the spectacled caiman
(Caiman crocodi/us) occurs on the other
side of the world from Thailand, Japan
repeatedly accepted transactions in the
contraband skins on the basis of re
export documents allegedly issued by the
Thai government in compliance with
CITES.

In fact, TRAFFIC's 8-month investiga-
tion has revealed a serious lapse of
CITES administration in Thailand and
Japan, and has uncovered a long paper
trail of illegal CITES documents and
other ploys involving Thailand, Columbia,
Chile, Venezuela, and Singapore to mask
the illegal origins of the poached skins.

TRAFFIC believes that the caiman
skins in question are part of an even larg-
er illegal consignment which was secretly
loaded onto Asia-bound ships on the high
seas off the coast of Uruguay at the end
of 1987. TRAFFIC’s international net-
work of informers has traced the consign-
ment - or parts of it —— through at least
seven countries (Brazil-Paraguay-

Uruguay-South Korea-Taiwan-Singapore-
Thailand) before reaching the final desti-
nation in Japan, with Thailand serving as
the major “laundering" point.

Thai re-expcrt documents, some stolen
and other apparently legally issued but
based on false information, bogus coun-
try of origin export permits, and other
suspect forms of documentation involving
a number of South American and Asian
countries, were repeatedly used to move
the skins to Japan. These documents
were generally accepted by the
Japanese government without verifying
their authenticity with appropriate authori-
ties in the countries of origin.

“It's all a paper game with the trade
routes becoming longer and the ploys
more complex all the time,” said
Tokunaga Hideomi of TRAFFIC Japan
who headed the investigation at a press
conference in Tokyo. “It’s a pity that
Thailand, who previously had an
admirable record with respect to CITES,
has been used to stage such massive
smuggling.”

Japan’s reptile skin trade has long
been the focus of international controver-
sy. The Ministry of International Trade
and Industry (MITI) has responded to the
latest evidence of illegal trade by initiat-
ing a new voluntary, pre-Customs clear-
ance check system for all imports of
caiman skins. In Thailand, government
authorities are reportedly launching crimi-
nal investigations.

Among the highlights of the investiga-
tion:

Thailand: In one of the most sensa-
tional transactions, the Thai government
confirmed that stolen Thai documents
were used to move 20,000 caiman skins
into Japan. One document bore the
exact same number as a permit legally
issued by the Thai government to allow
the export of one parrot to the United
States. Even more remarkably, it was
discovered that telex inquiries between
the Japanese and Thai governments con-
cerning the legality of the transaction
were actually intercepted and falsely
responded to in the name of the Thai
government by collaborators of the
Japanese traders in Thailand.

Columbia and Singapore: Singapore
documents, which identified Columbia as
the source of 35,000 caiman skins, were
later disputed by the Lolomt’a govern-
ment which confirmed to TRAFFIC that
there has been no legally authorized
exportation of alligator skins to Singapore
since October 1973.

(over)

 




(continued)

Singapore: Singapore, which contin-
ues to allow “lree trade” in spectacled
caiman skins although a party to CITES
since 1987, was identified as the source
for large quantities of skins which moved
through Thailand. These skins, labeled
as “pm-convention," are not eligible for
importation into Thailand or Japan,
unless the Singapore authorities can pro-
duce CITES export documents which
unequivocally confirm the legality of the
original import into Singapore. These
checks were apparently not made.

Venezuela and Chile: In another
transaction, Chile allegedly re-exported a
total of 24,000 caiman skins, identified as
originating in Venezuela, to Thailand.
However, the Venezuelan government
has confirmed that the Venezuelan permit
number identified on the Chilean docu-
ment does not correspond to any docu-
ment legally issued for caiman skin trans-
actions from Venezuela. Moreover, the
six different Thai permits which were sub-
sequently issued to re-export the skins
received from Chile to Japan actually
amounted to a total of some 70,000
caiman skinsl

In addition to Japan, TRAFFIC can
conform that large quantities of skins
were re-exported from Thailand to
Taiwan. TRAFFIC fears that Japan may
be the ultimate destination for these skins
and has called upon the Japanese gov-
ernment to refrain from allowing any
import of caiman skins or finished caiman
products from Taiwan until the issue can
be clarified.

Over Rare-

Birds Cargo

 

By GEORGE VOLSKY
Special to The New York Times

MIAMI, Sept. 18 — Five Miamians

accused of trying to smuggle 243 birds

of protected or endangered species into
the United States are to go on trial
Monday in Federal District Court in
Key West. ‘

The four men and one woman are ac-
cused of trying to bring in 48 Cuban
Amazon parrots, which are endan-
gered species, as well as 193 Cuban me—
lodious finches, one mustached para-
keet and one scarlet macaw, all classi~
fied as protected species.

The defendants were on board a 36—
foot motorboat on April 13 when Coast
Guard and Customs agents boarded
the vessel in Matecumbe Key, south of
Miami. The agents found the birds in a
cabin after hearing loud squawks from
below deck.

The birds were taken immediately to
the Metro Zoo in Miami, but only 42 of
the finches survived. Later two Cuban
parrots died of parasite infection.

Possible Shopping Lists

Among papers Seized by agents were
several that appeared to be shopping

lists made by people in Cuba request-‘

ing purchase of American articles diffi-
cult to obtain in Cuba, like cosmetics,
women’s lingerie, automobile accesso-
ries, vitamins, Polaroid cameras and
films and video cassettes.

This has led Federal investigators to
speculate that the boat was part of an
illegal courier service that exiles here
say has existed for years involving the
exchange of Cuban valuables and
American goods.

Cuban parrots are in great demand
by Cuban refugees here. The bird,
easily trained to imitate human
speech, is amusing and often affection-
ate, enjoying having its head scratched
by trusted persons.

A three-count Federal indictment
was handed up on July 6 charging the
five Miamians with conspiracy to ille-
gally transport wildlife from Cuba in
violation of an international treaty that
protects endangered species. If con-
victed each could be sentenced to 10
years in prison.

Denial of Illegal Acts

The defendants, who have all pleaded
not guilty, are Carlos Alberto Fernan-
dez, Jose A. Flores, Felix Valdes Nancy
Lopez, and Rigoberto Cherta~Garcia.

Their lawyer, Ellis Rubin, contends
that no law was broken because no
smuggling Was involved. He has
argued that the birds did not come
from Cuba but were being moved from
the Miami home of one defendant to an-
other residence in the Florida Keys.

The prosecutor, Daniel S. Gelber,
called the seizure “the biggest single
ever of endangered'species in Flor-
ida.” Mr. Gelber, an assistant United
States attorney, said that since 1972
only two Cuban Amazon parrots had

 

been seized by Federal agents in'3Fior-
ida.

Greg A. Moss, general curator of the
Life Fellowship Bird Sanctuary in Seff-
ner, near Tampa, said there were
“very few Cuban Amazon parrpts in
Florida.” He added, “A pair can fetch
up to $5,000 and can be sold only to peo-

‘ple who have endangered speciesgper-

mits, who buy them for procreation, a
very difficult process.”
Two parrots, two finches, the macaw
and the parakeet are going to be
brought from the 200 as materiaTevi—
dence at the trial, Mr. Gelber said) 5

 

U.S. Curbs a Prograni
On Wild Horse Control

RENO, Sept. 17 (AP) — The Federal
Bureau of Land Management has or-
dered an end to free mass adoptions of
wild horses, a practice that critics said
attracted people who sold the animals
for dog food and other commercial'pur-
poses.

The program aimed at controlling
the size of the wild horse population on
rangeland was ended Thursday by the
director of the agency, Robert Burford.
Under the plan, people who adopted 100
or more wild horses did not have topay
a fee of $125 an animal. People can‘still
adopt up to four mustangs a year. for
$125 an animal. _" "

“Several things had all come' to-
gether to make it clear to us the Amer-
ican people did not want this program
to continue,” said Bob Stewart, public
affairs director of the Nevada office of
the Bureau of Land Management. .

John Ohlson, a lawyer for the Animal
Protection institute, said, “It’s adespi-
cable program.” 1,--

Congress had threatened to withhold
money from the agency unless it ended
the mass adoption program. Last year, ,
a Federal judge in Reno ruled that the
policy was contrary to the 1971 Wild
Horse and Burro Protection Act; in-
tended to save animals from slaughter

Oral arguments on an appeal of that
case were heard Thursday in the
United States Court of Appeals foiffhe
Ninth Circuit. No ruling was issued.

'Gmnhouse Effect' _
Stratosphere
Becoming a
Hot Topic

By MAURA DOLAN
and MARK LAWRENCE.
Times Staff Writers

On the June day that a NASA
scientist told Congress that the
“greenhouse effect” may be linked
to the devastating drought and
withering heat of 1988, the mercu-
ry hit 98 degrees in the nation’s
capital, crept up to 90 degrees in
Cincinnati, soared to 97 in Dallas
and topped 100 in Nashville.

Newspapers and television were
telling of the drought’s ravages:
Crops were beginning to fail and
farmers were desperate. A seem-
ingly unrelated global environ-
mental issue—the alarmingly rapid
depletion of the world’s ozone
layer—was in the news too. After
years of doubts and skepticism, the
world’s political leaders and indus-
tries had accepted that a man-
made chemical was destroying the
stratospheric layer that shields the
planet from harmful ultraviolet
rays and protects against such ills
as skin cancer.

 

Message With an Edge

The combination of these cir-
cumstances gave the NASA scien-
tist’s pronouncement a telling edge:
Whether people accepted his opin-
ion that the current drought and
heat could be greenhouse phenom-
ena, they now had a framework for
understanding the kind of misery
that such a global warming could
bring. Moreover, the depletion of
the ozone proved the planet's vul-
nerability to man.

- “First of all, the hole in the ozone
woke everybody up to the fact that
humans can in fact destroy the
life-support systems that nature
provides us,” said Michael Oppen-
heimer, an atmospheric physicist
and senior scientist with the Envi—
ronmental Defense Fund in New
York. “And second, the hot sum-
mer across most of the country has
given people a visible example of
how miserable life can get with
even a modest warming.” ‘

So, nearl 100 years after the
first scienti to paper on the green-
house effect was published, the
nation is taking notice. Interest in
global warming has exploded in
Congress, the news media and

. among world organizations, rapidly

taking the topic from the laborato-
ry to the living room.

Time for a Change?

“If you go by the average taxicab
driver, a lot of people have become
aware of this issue and sensitized to
it,” said Dennis Tirpak, director of
strategic studies for the US. Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency.

But will the public interest fade
when the temperatures drop and
the rains begin? Is the debate little
more than an overnight sensation,
sparked by an unnerving set of
circumstances and a dearth of
summertime news? Is change in
policy and regulation imminent?

Global warming is not the only
environmental issue that has
moved closer to the top of the
public agenda in recent months.
Other global problems, including
ozone depletion and deforestation,
also are increasingly capturing
public attention. In many ways,
they are linked. Chlorofluorocar-
bons. or CFCs, the man-made
chemicals that destroy the strato-
spheric ozone shield, also act as a
greenhouse gas in the troposphere.
The loss of tropical forests around
the world is believed to contribute
to global warming because the
forests emit carbon dioxide, anoth-
er greenhouse gas, when they die
and absorb it when they grow.

The greenhouse effect is caused
by the buildup of carbon dioxide,
emitted by the combustion of fossil
fuels by cars and factories, and
other gases that accumulate in the

atmosphere. These gases trap the
Earth’s heat, acting much like a
greenhouse. Atmospheric scientists
suggest that the temperature rise
may eventually melt glaciers, raise
sea levels, transform verdant
farmland into desert and usher in
an increasing number of days of
sweltering heat.

Scientific projections vaguely
suggest that the climatic disrup-
tions will occur gradually in the
1990S and increase in severity into
the next century. But James E.
Hansen, the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration scientist
who testified before Congress, pro-
claimed that the greenhouse effect
has arrived and cited as evidence
the fact that the first five months in
1988 were the hottest on record. In
the current Journal of Geophysical
Research-Atmospheres, a team
lead by Hansen reported that a
computer model shows the Mid-
west F‘arm Belt and the Southeast—
ern United States may be among
the first regions of the planet to
experience the warning.

While not all scientists agree
that this year’s higher tempera-
tures can be attributed to the
greenhouse effect, most argue that
a significant global warming is
inevitable, even if massive mea-
sures are immediately taken to halt
air pollution.

Beams of legislation are now
being introduced in Congress to
reduce emission of greenhouse gas-
es. Unlike past greenhouse legisla-
tion, which generally called for
more study of the problem, .two
new bills introduced this summer
would force drastic changes, possi-
bly even upheaval, in industry and
life style. Both measures have
attracted surprisingly broad con-
gressional support, considering
their sweeping scope, and lawmak-
ers predict parts of them will be
enacted this year or next.

Views Prove Startling

“It [the greenhouse effect] is so
much more comprehensive, so
much more dangerous, so much
more revolutionary, so much more
life-changing than anything else
we have done that it literally
means everything as far as this
Congress is concerned and as far as

our life styles and our very econo-
my is concerned,” said Sen. J.
Bennett Johnston (D-La.), an ally
of the oil industry who shocked
many by speaking out in favor of
one of the bills.

Balking only at endorsing a pro-
vision that would require cars to
average 55 miles a gallon by 2010—
twice the 1985 efficiency stand-
ard—Johnston announced: “We’ll
have to begin the serious process of
legislating [in 1989]. We’ll act as
fast as the public’s willing to
support us.” .

Some of the congressional activi-
ty may have been spurred by the
news media, which have moved the
subject from the science section to
Page 1. Eighteen days after Han-
sen's stunning testimony, News-
week made the phenomenon its
cover story. Morning television
programs brought word of its po-
tential perils into the homes of
millions, and ABC newscaster Da-
vid Brinkley, whose Sunday pro-
gram from Washington usually
features politics or major world
events, devoted part of his program
to the greenhouse effect last
month.

“There are very few environ-
mental issues that get addressed on
the Sunday talk shows, on the
morning shows, on ‘Nightline,’ ”
said Rafe ,Pomerance, a senior
associate of the World Resources
Institute, a policy research organi-
zation. “I’ve been in the environ-
mental field for 15 years, and no
issue that I know of has ever gotten
this far.”

Lani Sinclair, who has been in
charge of the institute’s media
relations for three years, recalls
that few reporters were interested
in its studies on global problems
when she first took over her job.

“When we first had our report on
tropical forests in October, 1985,
most reporters said, ‘I don't want to
write about that because there
aren’t any tropical forests in the
United States,’ ” Sinclair recalled.
“There’s a real difference in three
years. The biggest difference is
that reporters are now working on
the issues independently of our
reports and calling us to ask for
help with stories.”

Industry is also slowly, and in
some cases grudginsly. beginning
to devote more money and staff to
research the ramiﬁcatiOns of the
warming and prepare for regula-
tions that could require major
product redesigns. '

General Motors, for instance, is
investigating the use of new fuels
that would not emit carbon dioxide.
The Electric Power Research 'In-
stitute in Palo Alto, a private
research funding organization fi-
nanced largely by the utility indus-
try, spent about $2 million on
greenhouse research during the
last eight to 10 years and now is
spending at a rate of $2.5 million
every two years. “And I’m sure it’s
goi to rise in. the near future,"
sai {Ralph Perhac, director of the
inst ‘ ute’s environmental science
dep ment.‘

ade associations are increas-
ingl asking greenhouse experts to
hold. workshops and seminars for
their members. “We’re starting to
pay a good deal of attention to it,”
said Arthur Wiese, a spokesman for
the American Petroleum Institute.
But Wiese, like other representa-
tives of industry groups, insisted
that legislation calling for dramatic
changes in energy and environ-
mental policy is premature until
further research proves that the
warming trend is accelerating.

On the international level, dis-
cussion of the greenhouse effect is

- no longer limited to scientific

meetings. A recent world confer-
ence in Toronto on the changing
atmosphere marked a turning point
in the kind of international atten-
tion the problem is receiving, the
EPA’s Tirpak said. Previous inter-
national conferences ‘on the subject
had been. more science-oriented,
dominated by the “in-group" of
international climate scientists, he
said;

"For the first time, you had the. ‘
prime ministers of Canada and
Sweden and a number of ministers
from _developing countries all at-
tending a meeting and making
proposals to deal with this issue,”
he said. “When you begin to have
people at that level become inter-
ested, I guess you can say it has
moved from strictly a science issue
to a political issue.” ( o v e r )

 




(continued)

Upcoming studies and confer-
ences on the greenhouse effect
suggest that the issue will not
disappear from the public con-
sciousness. The clamor may soften
when the climate cools, but the
scientific and public policy debates
that helped put the greenhouse
effect in the headlines will contin-
ue.

Two Major EPA Studies

Two major studies by the Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency will
keep the issue before the public
until at least the end of the year:
One will examine how the climatic
trend will affect agriculture,
health, energy, air pollution and
forestry; the other will set down
policy options that would help
stabilize the atmosphere.

’ Over the coming year, the Ger-
mans, Italians, Dutch and possibly
the Canadians will each hold an
international conference on global
atmospheric issues. In addition, the
second . World Climate Congress,
sponsored by the World Meteoro-
logical Organization, will be held in
1990, with the greenhouse effect a
major part of its agenda.

, How rapidly such attention will
lead to policy change or regulation
.is unclear. The EPA policy report,
for example, will not contain an
analysis of costs or the feasibility of
various proposed technologies. “1
think there will be a great deal
more work needed,” Tirpak said.

The report is expected to encour-
age use of alternative energy
sources, improved energy efficien-
cy in the residential, commercial
and transportation sectors, more
reliance on natural gas as an inter-
im transition fuel and the use of
more efficient coal technologies.

While parts of the recently in-
troduced greenhouse legislation
may be passed by Congress within
the next year, both bills are expect-
ed to encounter stiff opposition
from various industries, including
coal production and automobile
manufacturing. US. industry in
general strongly opposes any uni-
lateral action by the United States,
arguing that only a global solution
can work.

Sen. Timothy E. Wirth (D-
Colo. ), who recently introduced
one of two bills,~ said he was
surprised when it quickly captured
20 co—sponsors. His $4.2-billion
proposal would profoundly change
the direction of US. energy policy
toward use of energy-efficient ap-
pliances and cars and non-pollut-
ing energy sources.

“It is very hard to pass a bill this
broad and comprehensive," he said,
adding that his purpose is to. “frame
the issue” .in hearings this year
before any legislative action is
taken. -

The'other main greenhouse bill,
sponsored chiefly by Sen. Robert T.
Stafford (R-Vt.), seeks a 50% cut
in carbon dioxide emissions by the
year 2000 and a 75% cut by 2010.
Stafford, who will retire at the end
of this term, predicts that parts of
his bill may be passed as part of
other environmental legislation
this term.

“We haven’t by any means given
up on getting something done this
year,” he said. He believes he could
win Senate approval of his bill this
year if he could get it through
committee in time, which is unlike-
ly because of strong opposition
from outgoing Democratic Majority
Leader Robert C. Byrd of West
Virginia. “If we could get it up
there, I think it would pass,”
Stafford said.

A new administration in the
White House is also expected to
ease the path for new policy.
Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Du-
kakis, the Democratic presidential
nominee, favors holding an inter—
national summit on the environ-
ment with other heads of state
during his first six months in office.
The greenhouse effect would be at
the top of the summit agenda, said
Thomas D. Herman, Dukakis' dep-

; uty national issues director.

Vice President George Bush, the
Republican candidate, on Wednes-
day proposed a similar global meet-
ing on environmental issues, in-

“cluding the greenhouse effect.

The history of the ozone debate
may also be instructive in predict-
ing the future of greenhouse policy.
The first scientific debate over the
role of human activity in ozone loss
occurred in the late 19603. and the

Rising tide of concern in the South Paciﬁc

P TO 300 000 islanders in the South
Paciﬁc and Indian Oceans could be
forced to abandon their homes as sea levels
rise. Peter Roy, a geologist with the New
South Wales Department of Mineral
Resources, and John Connell, of Sydney
University, told the 26th Congress of Inter-
national Geographical Unions, which met

first scientific suggestion that chlo-
rine plays a role in ozone depletion
Was made in 1974. When CFCs in
the upper atmosphere are broken
down by the sun, atoms of chlorine

are released, setting off a series of .

ozone-destroying reactions. In
1985, scientists discovered an enor-
mous loss of ozone over Antarctica.

In 1978, the United States
banned .the use of aerosol propel-
lants, and two years later, industri-
al producers and users of CFCs
banded together to fight further
unilateral regulations by the EPA.
Calling itself the Alliance for Re-
sponsible CFC Policy, the Wash-
ington-based association lobbied
for an international agreement to.

limit the chemical's use and pro-

duction.

By the end of this year, an
international protocol that calls for
a 50% reduction in CFCs by the
end of the 19903 is expected to be
ratified by the requisite number of
nations—about 14 years after the
role of chlorine was first proposed
and 11 years after the United States
had first taken unilateral action.

By contrast, the first scientific
paper on the greenhouse effect was
published in 1896. During the
19705, scientists developed the ca-
pability to model the Earth’s whole
atmospheric system, and under-
standing of its complexities vastly
improved. By the middle 19803,.
scientists were better able to mea-
sure the concentrations of gases in.
the atmosphere and pinpoint how
much each gas contributed to the
problem. . ' ‘

But the United States has yet to
take unilateral action specifically
on the greenhouse effect, and no
industry group has been formed to
study the phenomenon or push for

hkely to rise by between 0-2 and l .4 metres
by the year 2030. They blame the green-
house effect, the trapping of solar radiation
by gaseous pollutants and by some types of
clouds.

. The rising seas could erode low-lying
islands severely or even engulf them
completely. The islands worst affected
would be the Maldives in the Indian Ocean,
and Kirabati, Tuvalu and the Marshall
Islands in the Paciﬁc. The highest points on
some of these islands are only 2 to 4 metres
above the low tide level.

Roy said that rising sea levels would also
create waves which could sweep across
islands. This would change irretrievably the
ecology of the islands, he said. Most
importantly, the sea water would penetrate
the fresh water aquifers on which the
islanders depend for their water supplies.
Roy said that the engineering works neces-
sary to prevent the islands being engulfed
would probably be too expensive for many
of the island states.

Connell said that he believed there was
no prospect of preventing the destruction
of these islands. He said the inhabitants,
would be forced to leave and become
refugees. [j

The Fact
The World
Bank
Won’t Face

In a minor (and probably acciden-
tal) breakthrough for candor, a World
Bank document this week admitted
what everybody knows but few have
been willing to say publicly: all of the
multi-billions in loans and other aid to
Third World countries will go down
the sinkhole if those Countries do not
adopt tougher birth-control pro-
grams.

The reason for the absence of hon-
esty on this issue is no secret: most
officials panic at the thought of the
political backlash from the Catholic
Church in poverty-stricken areas of
the Third World. Even in America,
the clout of the anti-birth-control
crowd is painfully self-evident in the
midst of a presidential campaign, as
arrogant “right-to-life" advocates dis-
rupt Gov. Michael Dukakis’ speeches.

In Latin America, where the debt
problem and the strength of the Cath-
olic Church coincide, the situation is
worse. A top official at the Inter-
American Development Bank, asked
how debtor countries such as Mexico
can ever stop the decline in living
standards without a more vigorous
population-control program, re-
sponds: “I know, but don’t give me a
problem I can't handle."

The World Bank’s allusion to the
population problem was contained in a
single paragraph in the annual report
of the International Finance Corp., its
affiliate that deals with private invest-
ment in the Third World.

The message was simple and di-
rect: so long as population control is
ineffective in poor countries, even a
reasonably high economic growth
rate won't lead them out of poverty.

 

Tm: WASHINGTON Posr

SEPTEMBER 15, 1988

 

More money simply must be spread
to feed more mouths. Although real
gross national product grew at about
4.5 percent in 1987 in the Third
World, the IF C report noted:

“With population. in these countries
continuing to grow at 2 percent a year,
and with increasing needs in many
countries for investments just to make
up for years of low investment and
maintenance, there was little room for
raising standards of living."

But that doesn’t mean that the IFC is
prepared to do anything about it. Its
executive vice president, Sir William
Ryrie, said that the [F C “is only part of
the whole effort” in dealing with Third
World problems, and had no responsi-
bility for dealing with such issues.

If it’s not IFC’s responsibility to
deal with the population problem (and
granted, the IF C is a relatively minor
player at a bigger table) whose re-
sponsibility is it?

It has become increasingly clear in
recent months that the Third World
debt strategy evolved three years ago
under former Treasury secretary
James A. Baker III isn’t working. A
blue-ribbon group of experts assembled
by former New York Federal Reserve
Bank president Anthony Solomon notes
that six years after the debt crisis
surfaced, most of the debtors are even
farther behind the eight ball.

The Solomon group assailed gov-
ernments, the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund for not
coming up with more innovative solu-
tions. Many academic groups and pri-
vate consultants have offered new
“plans” for dealing with the debt.
Indeed, devising debt strategy is a
growing cottage industry.

But I have yet to see a “solution”
(including Solomon’s) that gives ade-
quate attention to the underlying crit-
ical problem—population control. And
yet the impact of exploding population
has been well documented by Werner
F omos’ Population Institute and by
Lester Brown’s Worldwatch Institute.

In Europe and America, politicians
express wonderment (and some con-
cern on competitive grounds) over

Scientists in Warning to Humanity

Population Threat Rivals Nuclear War v

STANFORD (UPI)—The
world’s population—now at 5 bil-
lion—is doomed to reach at least 8
billion, posing a threat to humanity
second only to nuclear destruction,
a group of concerned scientists
warned Saturday.

“Arresting global population
growth should be second in impor-
tance on humanity’s agendaonly to
avoiding nuclear war," Stanford
Professor Paul Ehrlich said at an
annual conference on science and
world affairs.

1 The conference was being held
at the Black Searesort of Dagomys
in the Soviet Union and the state—
ment by the scientists was released
by Stanford. .

Ehrlich, speaking for the Club of

lation biologists—said overpopula-

the Asian countries. But they rarely
remark that the progress there, as
compared with the Latin nations, is
due not only to a stronger work ethic
but to a willingness to work out sensi-
ble birth-control programs over the
past 30 years.

In 1984 the World Bank’s annual
“Development Report" incorporated
a brilliant study of the global popula~
tion problem showing, for example,
that at then current birth rates, a
small country such as Kenya (popula-
tion, 18 million) would swell into one
of the big ones, with a population of

of Arts and Sciences, did not say
when the 8 billion population will
be reached, but Ehrlich said, “The
population explosion will come to
an end one way or another and
quite possibly within the lifetimes
of most people today.

“The only question remaining is
whether we will halt it ourselves
by limiting births or whether it will
be halted for us by some combina-
tion of ecological collapse, famine,
plague, and thermonuclear war-
fare.”

The scientists appealed to all
nations to follow the example of the
40 world leaders who signed the
1986 Statement on Population Sta-
bilization to work for a world in
which the numbers of pedple are
compatible with everyone being
free of want and fear.

SCIENCE, VOL. 2.41

 

Japan Prodded on the Environment

Japan’s Environment Agency has sounded
the call for Japan to take its position as a
leader in international conservation and en-
vironmental protection commensurate with
its position as a leading economic power.

That theme is the central message in a
recently released White Paper (which has
just become available in English) that urges
greater participation by Japan’s public and
private sectors to protect the global environ-
ment. It 15 the first White Paper issued by
the Environment Agency.

But the agency has its work cut out.
According to a Japanese government survey,
the Japanese public is nor very concerned
{about global environmental problems. In
addition, the agency has little political clout.

The report emphasizes that Japan—which
.will soon become the world’s biggest donor
I. of foreign aid—must take into account the
. environmental consequences of projects it
funds. ,

Moreover, according to the report, Japan
has a major international responsibility in
part because it is a leading importer of
exhaustible and renewable natural resources.
It is the world’s second largest consumer of
fossil fuel, of which virtually all is imported.
Japan also imports a huge volume of exotic
woods from Southeast Asia, textile materials
such as corton, and much of its food.

As an industrialized nation, Japan’s
chloroﬂuorocarbon production accounts for
just over 10% of the world production. It
ranks fourth in the world in carbon dioxide
emissions. _ p

“The problem of the global environment
has passed the stage of making proposals
and deliberations and [has] entered the stage
of taking concrete actions,” the report says.

But convincing the Japanese public and
the government of this imperative is anOther
matter. The report says that fewer Japanese
than Europeans are concerned about envi-
ronmental issues. It compared the ﬁndings
of two public opinion polls, one conducted
this year by the Japanese govemment and
one by the Commission of European Com-
munities, which surveyed Europeans in
1986. The results showed that 26% of the
Japanese public are highly concerned about
species extinction compared to 42% of the
European public. In Japan, 30% are worried
about depletion of natural resources, where-

 

as 35% of Europeans are. And 32% of those
polled in Japan are troubled about the
greenhouse effect compared to 38% in Eu-
r0pe.

To some environmentalists and Others,
the White Paper says all the right things, but
Japan’s actions say something else. .

Frank Upham, a professor at Boston Col-
lege who teaches Japanese environmental
law, says that the White Paper “is an expres-
sion of a sincere belief. But there’s a differ-
ence between that and taking steps to realize
that ideal. The Japanese don’t care a whit
about preserving nature per se, but they’ve
been successful in proteCting the environ-
ment” as it relates to human health. Alan
Miller, associate professor at the Widener
Law School in Delaware, who has studied
environmentalism in Japan, says that the
White Paper contains “wondrous rhetoric,
but I’m pretty skeptical.” Upham and Miller
both now that the environmental agency is a
very weak political entity.

Miller remarks that the report’s broad
theme of intemationalism “is a very trendy
topic in Japan. Everything is being reexam-
ined now.” The Japanese, he says, “love
nature symbols, like Mount Fuji. But nature
to the Japanese is an aesthetic that has little
political signiﬁcance.”

Jorgen Thomsen of an environmental
group TRAFFIC, which tracks the protec-
tion of endangered species and is funded by
the World Wildlife Fund, asserts that Japan
has a poor record in conservation in protect-
ing whales, sea turtles, and musk deer, for
example. “There are some new trends in
Japan in conservation law, but there are still
tremendous loopholes.” Japan still has one
of the longest lists of exceptions to a roster
of endangered species that are protected
under international agreement, Thomsen
notes. In addition, the national government

Majority 1n U. S. Poll for Third World Family Planning Aid

By DON IRWIN, Times Staff Writer

WASHINGTON—A majority of
Americans believe that mounting
populations in poor nations of the
Third World are threats to their
jobs, to US. security and to the
world environment and that sup-
port for family planning in devel-
oping countries is therefore justi-
fied, according to survey results
announced Sunday.

Because of population growth in
the poor nations of Asia, Africa and
Latin America, Americans “believe
it is in the national interest to
provide financial support for birth
control programs in such countries

. whether or not abortion is
legal there," said a summary of the
survey.

The study, based on a telephone
poll of a nationwide cross section of
1,250 adults, was conducted in May
by Lou Harris & Associates Inc. for
the Population Crisis Committee
and the Planned Parenthood Fed-
eration of America. Both organiza-
tions have opposed the Reagan
Administration’s ban on US. sup-
port for international family plan—
ning programs that permit or en-
dorse abortion.

Included among major findings of
the study:

—Food shortages and famines ‘

will intensify, 91% of the sample
said, if population growth continues
unabated in poor countries.
—Unless population growth is
slowed, 86% of those interviewed
fear that illegal immigration will
increase; that there will be more
international crises and that the
global environment will worsen.
—-More US. jobs will be exported
to, overpopulated nations where
workers are forCed to accept low

pay, in the opinion of 69%.

—Continuation of current
growth trends will turn more farm
land into desert, 57% said.

—Sixty percent said that the
United States should give family
planning aid to developing coun-
tries, even if they permit legal
abortions.

Humphrey Taylor, president of
the Harris organization, said that
he sees the poll results as a signal to
presidential and congressional can-
didates “that Republican and Dem-
ocratic voters alike support funding
for family planning programs in
developing countries, even when
these countries provide abortiOn.”

Similarly, Faye Wattleton, pres-‘
ident of Planned Parenthood,
called on political leaders to “heed
this message and enact public poli-
cies in synch with the views of the
American public.”

Sharon Camp, vice president of
the Population Crisis Committee,
called the findings “good news for
any candidate running on a plat-
form that includes support for US.
family planning programs at home
and abroad.” Camp cautioned,
however, that population control
takes time and can be achieved
only gradually.

“Unless there is a crash pro-
gram,” she said, “the likely scenar-

io is at least a tripling of the world’s.

population, with growth continuing
beyond the next century.”

At present, Camp said, the family
planning budget for. the Third
World is about $1.5 billion a year,
not counting another $1 billion
China is spending on its massive
program. She estimated that $7

billion a year in worldWide spend-
ing will be required to stabilize
world population, a step that would

' - involve cooperation by 70% 0f

fertile couples. Most industrial na-
tions- and some advanced East
Asian countries, notably South Ko-
rea, Singapore and Hong Kong,
have reached this level, but con-
traceptive use is below 30% 1n most
developing countries and is below
10% in Africa, Camp said.

A third of the funding for family
planning activities in the Third

, World comes from developed na-

tions. In the early 19705, the United
States provided about 20% of funds
for this purpose. But in 1973,
Congress outlawed the use of for-
eign aid funds for abortions or
abortion research. Further moves
to reduce overseas population-con-
trol funding began early in the
Reagan Administration, when the
Office of Management and Budget
slashed the $346 million requested
by former President Jimmy Carter
for programs administered by the
Agency for International Develop-
ment in fiscal 1982 by nearly a
third.

In 1984, reversing a policy posi-
tion adopted a decade earlier at the
first World Population Conference,
the US. delegation at the second
conference in Mexico City called
for more emphasis on economic
progress as a “natural mechanism”
to slow populatiOn growth. It was
announced that, while U. S. support
for international family planning
services would not be reduced, the
United States would end aid to
groups that “perform or actively
promote abortion.”

 




THE WALL STREET JOURNAL FRIDAY, JULY 29,1988

 

World Bank: Development’s Foe

By TOM Cox

The issue of U.S. support for foreign-aid
programs holds a peculiar place in Ameri-
can politics. Very few federal spending
programs are so inherently lacking in pub-
lic support. This is particularly true re-
garding the funding of multilateral lending
agencies. Yet despite this considerable po-
litical liability, the World Bank has gar-
nered the contributions necessary to lift
annual lending volume from less than $8
billion in 1978 to $14.2 billion in 1987.

Recent U.S. contributions to the bank
have gotten a boost from changes in legis-
lative procedure. In both houses of Con-
gress, the trend in the 19805 has been to
minimize the “political heat” resulting
from support for foreign aid by hiding
votes within larger spending bills or one
“catch-all” continuing resolution. The pro-
posed $75 billion general capital increase
(GCI) for the World Bank, which would
allow the bank to boost annual lending
more than 40% to $20 billion, will also re-
quire substantial “political cover,” as Rep.
Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) put it, to win
congressional support.

The GCI would require the U.S. to pro-
vide $420 million in “paid-in” capital and
$13.8 billion in additional U.S. funding obli-
gations to the bank, provided in annual in-
stallments over the next six years. Given
the new political context of the Gramm-
Rudman era, the attempt to fund a mas-
sive expansion of World Bank lending—es-
pecially one involving an election-year con-
tinuing resolution—is widely viewed as de-
livering a slap in the face to advocates of
U.S. budgetary restraint.

It is in the nature of the World Bank
lending process itself, however, that one
finds a major source of political heat. The
World Bank proposal is increasingly vul-
nerable to charges, such as those by Rep.
Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.), that present
World Bank and supporting Reagan admin-
istration policy “just amounts to new lend-
ing l to debtor nations] to pay old interest.”
Between 1981 and 1987, the World Bank
provided a total of more than $30 billion to
the 15 “middle income” LDCs, known as
“the Baker 15,” that face the biggest
credit burdens. Several of these nations,
despite massive commercial and institu-
tional lending throughout the 19805, are
paying more in debt service than they are
receiving in new loans each year.

The commercial-bank bailout mecha-
nism currently preferred by the World
Bank involves “adjustment” lending pro-
grams, ostensibly dedicated to inducing
policy-based reforms in borrowing nations.
This lending tool speeds disbursement of
funds to debt-ridden LDCs to facilitate

their payments to large commercial banks.
Adjustment loans, which represented less
than 10% of World Bank lending in 1982,
now account for roughly 25%. (The rest
goes to projects to build infrastructure and-
train people for such fields as energy, de-
velopment finance and agriculture.)
Meanwhile, results of its lending prac-
tices provide a telling indictment of the
World Bank’s performance in fostering
economic growth in borrowing nations. In
Africa, pencapita food production actually
has declined since 1960. Between 1980 and

The U.S. interests defied by World Bank
lending practices often involve human-
rights concerns (26 cases from 1983 to 1987)
and congressional mandates against U.S.
support for subsidies to enterprises creat-
ing economic distortions or harming U.S.
producers. U.S. objections, to World Bank

' loans that provide unconditional balance-

of-payments support or that fail to foster
economic reforms in borrowing nations
also have been routinely ignored. In fact,
every U.S.—opposed loan since 1977 has
been approved by the World Bank.

1984, the gross domestic product of African
countries fell an average of 1.4% a year.
Yet World Bank commitments approved
for Africa, which had risen to $2.25 billion
in fiscal 1980 from $443 million in fiscal
1970, increased by fiscal 1984 to $3.64 bil-
lion.

World Bank lending to countries in the
region has grown to levels that indicate
such assistance often acts as a substitute
for, rather than as a supplement to, do-
mestic economic development. Note the
authors of a recent study of the bank re-
ported in the Economic Journal, a British
academic publication: “The apparent ina-
bility of development aid over more than
20 years to provide a net increment to
overall growth in the Third World must
give the donor community, as it gives us,
cause for grave concern.’

Perhaps the bank’ 5 most acute political
weakness has been its flouting of Ameri-
can interests. From 1983 to 1987, the U.S.
has opposed 73 loans of the World Bank
Group by either abstaining or voting “no.”
In every instance the loans were approved.
These loans total more than $5 billion in
World Bank commitments (of which the
U.S. share is roughly $1 billion).

These ominous trends in World Bank
lending policy have prompted efforts to in-
crease U.S. leverage over bank activities.
Rep. Jim Bunning (R., Ky.), eager for
Congress to “quit being the World Bank's
patsy,” has sponsored an initiative to sub-
ject annual U.S. installments to the GCI to
a penalty reduction for every World Bank
loan approved in defiance of existing U.S.
statutory directives. A similar demand for
accountability has been launched by Rep.
Bruce Morrison (D., Conn.) and several of
his Democratic colleagues, who are hold-
ing their votes for the GCI hostage to debt-
relief action by fiscal 1991.

According to Treasury Secretary James
Baker, “the time is now ripe for a general
capital increase" for the World Bank. Big
U.S. financial houses echo that sentiment,
as does the Bretton Woods Committee
(largely business executives and former
government officials). Recent efforts to
put some teeth in U.S. objections to World
Bank policy suggest, however, that many
in Congress do not agree.

nomic legislation for Free the Eagle, (1
public-policy lobby.

 




 

The Great Polluter

Congress soon will find itself in the won-
derful position of being able to advance the
goals of environmentalism, economic
growth and sensible foreign aid. The three
issues all surface within the context of re-
capitalization for the World Bank.

The bank wants the United States to kick
in $14 billion of the $74.4 billion it seeks in
recapitalization. Yet there are plenty of peo-
ple in Congress who don’t want another
penny to go to the bank until it becomes
slightly more sensitive to America’s desire
that foreign aid serve the interests of growth
and prosperity. The bank approved all 73 of
the loans the United States found objection-
able in the 1983-87 period, and then added
insult by refusing to disclose terms of the
more controversial loans.

Yet bank policy also has become increas-
ingly objectionable to ecologists, who note
that the bank bases its investments on “inter-
nal rates of return” that make no calculation
of environmental damages wrought by those
projects. Bank investments thus have en-
couraged inefficient energy use, destruction
of important resources and the construction
of projects that eventually produce a neg-
ative rate of return, once one has accounted
for investments necessary to minimize dam-
age created by the original projects.

In Botswana, loans for cattle ranchers
have caused overgrazing and desertification,
resulting in the deaths of hundreds of thou-
sands of migratory animals. Bank-financed
“transmigration” —— sometimes entailing
forcible removal from homes — in Indonesia
has caused the destruction of tropical rain
forests and consequent reduction of genetic
diversity, while crop yields are low because
of the barren soil. And in India, the Narmada
Valley Development Project, which will dam
up India’s largest west-flowing river, is ex-
pected to displace over 2 million people and
increase the incidence of malaria, cholera
and other water-borne diseases.

The bank recently created an Environ-
mental Department and charged it with
studying such issues as deforestation,
desertification and biodiversity. Signifi-
cantly, however, the department still won’t try
to calculate real rates of return based on the
actual consequences of development; it sim-
ply will try to tinker with the technologies to
be used for building bank projects.

Thus, the bank plans to go ahead with the
Narmada Valley Project. As recently as J an-
uary, the bank approved $70 million for Ethi-

opia so that Ethiopian dictator Mengistu
Haile Mariam can continue his forcible re—
settlement of the people from their villages
to collective farms, where many die on the
journey or of starvation, and which already
caused a 60-percent reduction in grain pro-
duction between 1975 and 1982.

Sen. Steve Symms has sponsored legisla-
tion that would attempt to indirectly deal
with the bank’s environmental ineptness.
The legislation would require the bank to
conform to the National Environmental Pol-
icy Act regulations. Such compliance would
require the bank to file an Environmental
Impact Statement giving detailed informa-
tion about the environmental impact of every
project undertaken with its funds, or ex-
plaining why such information was unavail-
able. The United States would lend special-
ists to the World Bank to enable it to complete
studies blocked by lack of personnel. Mr.
Symms’ office also is working on a letter that
could be signed by other countries affirming
the same principles.

Many conservatives support the measure
not because they care about environmental
issues per se, but because they see it as a
great way to hogtie the World Bank. Such a
strategy is too cute by half. Rather than sub-
jecting the entire world to EPA policies that
many American environmentalists consider
counterproductive, Congress should demand
that the World Bank bring market forces to
bear on environmental issues — selling pol-
lution licenses; demanding just reparation
for property seizures and the creation of in-
stitutions that secure and strengthen prop-
erty rights; making environmentalists re-
sponsible for developing and maintaining
land without outside help, etc.

Congress meanwhile should make its dis-
pleasure with the bank known by refusing to
appropriate the $14 billion in general capital
increases that the World Bank wants the
United States to provide for next year’s bud-
get. The bank has $13 billion in unspent re-
serves available for new loans and guaran-
tees. It should be forced to draw on that
money until it stops using its resources to
prop up petty dictators and fat-cat contrac-
tors and begins satisfying American pref-
erences for a World Bank that honors the
commitments embodied in its charter: pro-
growth economic programs, pro-environ-
ment cost analyses and open disclosure of
loan portfolios and conditions.

 

Washington aim“; SEPTEMPEIES, 1988

 

Why not let the World Bank hogtie itself

 

Conservatives have clubbed the
World Bank since it was first con-
ceived. We call it anti-American. We
argue that it promotes communism
and condemn its corruption of the
marketplace. We label it anti-
developmental. And now, we accuse
it of destroying the environment.
Your Aug. 10 editorial is a good ex-
ample of why no one ever believes
us.
Pointing to the Bank’s past perfor-
mance has never worked. The Bank
just responds, “We don’t do that any-
more.” For every disaster the Bank
has caused, it will point to new staff
that has been hired or new direc-
tions that have been issued to “fix” it.

Conservative criticisms will only
be credible when they are directed
against what the Bank is doing today,
this very minute.

Has The Times tried to do that
recently? The World Bank does not
throw its doors open to public scru-
tiny. Proving that the Bank is de-
stroying lives today, and will be next
month as well, is next to impossible.
It would be easier if some light could
be shed on the tightly—guarded inner
workings of this inemational lender.

And yet your editorial chides con—
servatives who support an environ-
mental disclosure bill (the sub-
stance of which you completely
botched). You describe this effort as
“a great way to hogtie the World
Bank.” That is not the intent of any

onservative remotely connected
with this bill.

Our objective is much simpler. It
is to use the mechanisms of the Na-
tional Environmental Policy Act
(which, by the way, is not an “EPA
policy”) to pry the World Bank open.
This might give us a glimpse not
only of environmental policies in-
side, but of economic and social poli-
cies as well.

After all, if conservatives are
right, we don’t need to pass legisla-
tion to “hogtie the World Bank.” Let
it operate in broad daylight, warts
and allfand it will hogtie itself.

Marubeni Makes .
Long-Term Deal for
Wood Chips

WILL BEGIN IMPORTING NEXT
YEAR FROM INDONESIA

Marubeni has concluded a contract with
an Indonesian overseas Chinese group to pur-
chase, on a long-term basis, mangrove chips
for papermaking which are produced on West
Irian, in the eastern part of Indonesia (New
Guinea). Marubeni will begin importing and
selling the chips in 1989, principally to large
papermakers. Marubeni's purpose is to
respond to the increased demand for paper-
making raw materials by diversifying its chip
supplies, and to set up a system for a stable
supply.

The chips Marubeni is to import will be
made from a primary growth of mangroves in
Bintuni Bay, on the western end of New
Guinea. The Pingardi Group, the local
overseas Chinese concern with which
Marubeni concluded the agreement, has
already procured a logging concession from
the government for the approximately
137,000 hectare mangrove forest on the south
shore of the bay. The concern will build a
chip factory, and harbor facilities such as
those for loading ships, and will begin the
annual production of 300,000 to 400,000 tons
of chips in mid-1989.

, Of the Pingardi Group's total $7 million
investment, about $3.5 million will be provid-
ed by Marubeni. Marubeni will receive the
entire amount of chips produced, and will sell
the chips on 10-year contracts to companies
such as the Kanzaki Papermaking Company,
Nakagoe Pulp Industries, Nippon Paper
Processing, and the Sanyo Kokusaku Pulp
Company. There are also plans to sell chips
to companies in Taiwan and South Korea.

Owing to the highly valued yen, imports
of wood chips for papermaking are on the
increase. Forty-three percent of domestic
pulp production, said to be approximately 9
million tons (1987 estimate), is made with
imported wood chips. Marubeni is securing a
new resource because of increasing produc-
tion by large paper and pulp manufacturers

Forests Sought to Counter Greenhouse Effect

 

By WALTER SULLIVAN

IRTUALLY all the carbon
dioxide emitted by power
plants to be built in the next

decade could be absorbed by
10 million acres of new forest, accord-
ing to the Environmental Defense
Fund. The organization has proposed
that such planting be undertaken by
the Federal Conservation Reserve
Program, a project of the Depart-
ment of Agriculture.

The trees would absorb as much
carbon dioxide as would be produced
by the burning of fossil fuels in the
power plants. The gas collects in the
atmosphere, where it traps heat like

 

the glass in a greenhouse. Many
scientists believe this “greenhouse
effect’.’ is contributing to global
warming.

Daniel J. Dudek, author of the pro-
posal, described it yesterday to the
Senate Committee on Energy and
Natural Resources, which began two
days of hearings on the role of forests
in controlling carbon dioxide in the
air.

Discussing the role of trees in soak-
ing up and storing carbon dioxide,
Senator Timothy E. Wirth, the Colo-
rado Democrat who is chairman of
the hearings, said yesterday that
about 27. million acres of tropical rain
forests are being destroyed each

forest material puts even more car-
bon dioxide into the atmosphere.

The Conservation Reserve Pro-
gram encourages farmers to rent
cropland to the Government for 10
years. The land is then planted in
trees and other noncrop vegetation.
Land particularly susceptible to ero-
sion is chosen and the program is also
designed to reduce overproduction of
crops.

Under the proposal, the annual
Government compensation would be
substantially increased by funds as-
sessed from utilities building new

power plants. This assessment would,

encourage utilities to reduce their de-
pendence on fossil fuels.

hoped, under the Conservation Re-
serve Program, that by 1990 farmers
would have rented to the Government
40 million to 45 million acres from the
469 acres now producing crops. Less
than one quarter of this goal has been
achieved, he reported.

Furthermore, his report said, while
Congress proposed that 12.5 percent
of the replanted acreage be in forests,
less than one-third of that amount has
been planted in trees.

Replanting 10 million acres as for-
est would cost $1 billion to $2 billion,
Mr. Dudek said, but it would still be
“the most cost-effective option” to re-
duce carbon dioxide in the atmos-

'Ihe government of Malaysia seems
set on allowing the catplete

implemented new repressive
legislation prohibiting even

In spite of this pressure, so
great was the threat from the
loggers on their homelands and
livelihoods, that in May the
Penan were forced to re-impose
their blockades. Arrests were
threatened bytheGovernment, but
were not enforced, perhapsdue in
part to their concern overthe
telexes received from FoE,

THE RA'NFORESTT'MES — MALAYSIA

- EUROPE MOVES TOWARDS A BAN ON '
SARAWAK TIMBER IMPORTS

The final plenary session of the
European Parliament has
unanimously passed a resolution
for all member nations to suspend
the imports of tropical hardwoods
from Sarawak. The resolution
follows an international outcry
about the damaging social and
environmental effects of the
Sarawak government's logging
policies.

The motion for a resolution was
proposed on July 8th by Bram van
der Lek, Dutch Member of the
Green Alternative Alliance in the
European Parliament. The
resolution demands the temporary
suspension of imports of timber
from Sarawak and a bilateral
timber agreement from the
European Community with Malaysia
"which specifies that timber
imports into the Community must
come fron concessions which must
be shown to be ecologically and
socially acceptable by the
exporting country".

This agreement should include
"the setting up of an independent
committee including ecologists,
anthroplogists and
representatives of the indigenous
people of Sarawak, to be
established and co-ordinated
under the auspices of the ITTO".
In particular, this committee
should assess the ecological and
social acceptability of existing
and new logging concessions, and
draw up management plans for the
tropical rain forests.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The European Parliament also
called for a labelling system for
the imported timber in a way
which indicates to the consumer
that it comes from an acceptable
concession. Finally the
resolution called upon- the
Community to "give the Malaysian
Government and the I'I‘TO financial
and expert assistance in
implementing the proposals".

However, the European Commission

of summary imprisonment or
worse. It is only through
international pressure that the
lives and culture of the Penan,
and the rainforests which are

We urgently need your sugport in
showing the Malaysian government
that the destruction of Sarawak
is an intolerable violation of
human rights and an act of
ecological vandalism of the first
order. Our combined efforts mst

implementing European
legislation) did not accept the
suspension. While agreeing with
the general remarks made by van
der Lek and the need for action,
it argued that Britain is not the
main body responsible for
tropical rainforest destruction
with only 28% of the total world
imports. Japan is considered a
far worse Offender. Banning
Sarawak wood and labelling are
seen as technically impossible
and put the interests of the
European timber processing
industry at stake. These
arguments were rejected by the
MEPs present and the demands
sustained.

Although the European Parliament
can only advise on this issue,
since it has no legislative
power, the unaminous demand for
suspension can be seen as an
important moral and political
victory for the environmental
movement in Europe and Malaysia.
Pressure on the European
Commission to change it's
position will increase, both from
inside and outside Parliament.

Thanks must go to all the people
who undertook to badger their
MEPs at such short notice and
help pass the resolution.

REVIEW

The human key to saving the rainforest 4

GT FIRST glance, the stun-
ning colour photos in this

book looked suspiciously
glossy. Is this another coffee-
table book, I thought, about the
drsappearing tropical rain-
forests, and how dreadful is the
loss of species, habitat and
people? I was wrong. This is
largely about the variety of
people living in rainforests, and
the lessons to be learnt from
them.

Those people are Indians, and
settlers of mixed blood, and
modern immigrants searching
for permanent homes or quick
proﬁts. Some of these people are
successful, others are a human
tragedy, but there are useful
lessons to be learnt from all of
them about sowing rainforests.

What makes this a powerful
book is the marriage of short
essays from anthropologists and
ecologists with stunning photo-
graphs. I was spellbound.

The introduction to People of
the Tropical Rainforest is a
punchy summary of the richness
of rainforest biology and the
ways that it is disappearing.
Nothing unusual about that, but
what bliss to read facts instead
of adjectives. Unfortunately,
Westerners tend to wallow in
cliches when they describe rain-
forests, and the ﬁrst essay helps
to explain why: we still carry
misconceptions taken from the
Garden of Eden, writings of old
explorers, and ﬁlms such as
Indiana Jones and the Temple of
Doom.

Westerners looked down on
the Indians with contempt.
With so much lush vegetation,
went the argument, tropical
jungles must be fertile places,
well worth hacking down and
making into farmland. Only
now is the awful reality of
erosion and extinction of species
and people dawning on us. But
old images die hard, particularly
in crowded slums in developing
countries or in the boardrooms
of multinational farming or
mining companies.

The Indians, of course, have
plenty of experience of the
forest. Scientists have unearthed
12000 years of human habi-
tation in the Amazon. The
prehistoric people lived a precar-
ious existence in lands drenched
in rain and often ﬂooded, labori-
ously felling trees with stone
axes and ﬁre. Only their skills
kept them alive—inherited by
their successors—and these we
are still very ignorant about.

Knowledge of nature: the Indians of the Amazon can teach Western

 

 

 

«w

agronomists a lot about rainforest agriculture

ture, for example. It is a dirty
phrase in the West, but Indians
all over the world, such as the
450 Lacandon Mayans of south-
ern Mexico, know its limits.
After hacking and burning a
patch of forest, they plant 79
varieties of food and ﬁbre crops
on plots just one hectare in area.

First, the Indians plant fast-
growing crops, which protect the
soil and soak up the nutrients
left behind in the ash of the
burnt forest. Then they plant
garden crops, such as corn,
onions and watermelons. They
often allow wild forest
species—wild pineapple, wild
sugar vine, corkwood and so
on—to regenerate naturally in
the garden plots.

This mix of domestic and
forest crops helps prevent plant
disease and plagues of insect
pests, and also attracts pacas,
brocket deer and other edible
forest animals which the Indians
hunt. In fact, several studies in
the tropics have shown that
garden plots in a tropical forest
can actually increase the popu-
lations of certain wild animals.

After intensive cultivation for
ﬁve to seven years, the Indians
leave tree crops such as rubber
and cacao behind for up to 15
years, until the natural forest
takes over again. In this way, a
Lacandon farmer may clear a
mere 10 hectares of virgin tropi-
cal forest during a working life-
time of 50 years.

Mark Edwards/Panos Pictures I

New immigrants in the same
forest have to clear fresh plots
yearly. And yet the beauty of
Indian agriculture is often lost
on the “modern” way of think-
ing. In the words of a mis-
directed agronomist:

“We must teach the
Lacandones how to farm in the
tropical forest.”

It is population pressure that
often drives the deforestation.
Rising numbers of urban people
in the developing world are ﬂee-
ing into the rainforests, where
they have few skills to survive
permanently. The Indonesian
govemment’s transmigration
scheme, for example, has shifted
millions of poor people out of
the crowded inner islands such
as Java, and given them land in
the remote forests of the outer
islands. Conditions are usually
very poor, and communities
struggle to survive in many
cases. Yet, since the scheme
started in the 19505, relatively
few migrants have abandoned
their holdings.

The real solution, though, lies
in overcoming the poverty of
the urban people. And that, of
course, needs a revolution in the
national and world economies.

Some people of the tropical
rainforest have shown how to
combine small-scale slash-and-
burn with natural birth control.
The population of hill people
in northern Thailand grew as
modern medicine began to
control diseases such as malaria
and smallpox in the 19505. But
now they have limited the rise
by marrying later, so the pres-
sure on the land stays fairly
constant.

The economics of the outside
world have other effects as well.
The crash in the price of copper
led Zaire to cut down hard-
woods in its rainforests for alter-
native foreign eamings. All the
forest edges of the Congo Basin
have now been clear cut for
lumber and charcoal. Mean-
while, the rise in the world price
of coffee has also led to a boom
in new plantations cleared from
rainforests.

Ironically, successful new
settlers of the Amazon forest
have often taken advice from
the native people, such as the
Caboclos of the Amazon ﬂood-
plain in Brazil. The Caboclos are
a hotch-potch of descendants of
European and African and the
early immigrants from other
areas of Brazil, Peru and other
Andean countries, together with
detribalised Indians. Their b

BBC WILDLIFE AUGUST I988

 

Loggers let loose in;
Thai sanctuaries

he government of Thai-
I land—a country that since
the war has seen its forest
cover dwindle from 75 per cent of
its land area to 30 per cent—has
worked out a formula that will
make it legally possible to lower
the percentage a good deal
further.

Just as conservationists were
daring to believe they had won
an important victory with the
government’s shelving of plans
for the Nam Choan dam on what
we know as the River Kwai, they
were suddenly presented with a
problem almost too large to con-
template: the legalisation of
logging inside wildlife sanc-
tuaries.

Since all ofThailand’s remain-
ing forest is split about evenly
between already-allocated log-
ging concessions and the once-
inviolate conservation network,
it is possible to see this as a true
beginning of the end of the Thai
forests.

The beginning of the begin~
ning of the end occurred in
November of last year, when the
staff of Khlong Praya wildlife
sanctuary in Krabi province
apprehended some loggers
working inside the sanctuary’s
boundaries, and took them
before the Juridicial Council.

The logging company, sup-
ported by elements within the
Royal Forestry Department
(RFD), pleaded that for the past
25 years the Wild Animals Pre—
servation and Protection Act had
been misinterpreted. The land
where the loggers had been
working was a timber concession
that, like many other timber con—
cessions, had been taken into a
sanctuary since the country’s
conservation network began to
be drawn up in the early sixties.

 

(continued)

This was true. Originally, of
course, the overlap had seemed
academic, since most of the
country’s forests were still stand-
ing, and loggers had plenty to be
getting on with. But as commer-
cial forest shrank and a few new
conservation areas were created,
sanctuary land, by proportion,
grew—from 12.5 per cent to 50
per cent. Now, said the com-
pany, it was time to look again at

those old concessions and the
interpretation of the law that had
been protecting them from their
rightful cxploiters.

The council agreed, the
recommendation for reinter-
pretation was passed on to the
Thai cabinet, and the cabinet
complied with what one observer
termed “obscene speed.” In
a month from the time the
loggers had first been caught and
shortly after the government had
righteously declared its intention
to increase the country’s forest
cover to 40 per cent, it had
become possible for timber
companies to work concessions
inside sanctuaries.

These comprise about a quar-
ter of the 7.5 million hectares of
‘protected’ land. The threat to
the other three-quarters will
come from the unstoppable wave
of slash-and-burn agriculture
and illicit logging that timber
companies’ clearances and
access roads invariably incite.
(Even as it is, says one source,
poverty, corruption and inade-
quate policing have already com—
bined to make illicit logging one
of the park system’s biggest
problems.)

Among the first to be legally
invaded—the sanctuaries where
logging applications have been
quickly granted—are Phu
Miang-Phu Thong, near the
border with Laos, and Khlong
Phraya in the south. The former
contains clouded leopard and lar
gibbon, and the latter boasts
Gurney’s pitta.

Is there anything that can be
done to preserve rainforests and
their native peoples? Attempts
to give Indians legal rights to
their lands and culture often
fall down in practice. Political
movements in the rainforests
have had more success, though.
For example, the Union of
Indian Nations in Brazil has

This lowland forest bird,
thought extinct until it was redis-
covered in 1986, has become a
focus of world attention, and the
International Council for Bird
Preservation (ICBP) has, ironi-
cally enough, just given the RFD
(which has good elements too)
£4,000 to continue work on its
conservation.

And at Huai Kha Khaeng, said
to be one of the best wildlife
refuges in South-east Asia, the
state-owned Thai Plywood Com—
pany has demanded access to old
concessions on about a quarter of
the sanctuary. Popular pressure
has now caused it to withdraw
the demand, but as long as the
new reinterpretation stands, this
and other companies pose per-
manent, looming threats.

Still, the strength of the pro-
tests gives some cause for hope.

Environmental abuse emanating
from high places is nothing new
in Thailand, and the fact that it
has been going on for so long
means that an opposition has had
time to gather force. Thai news-
papers—notably the Bangkok
World and The Nation—are not
afraid, when reporting on fores-
try scandals, to conjoin the words
‘corrupt’ and ‘politician’, and
throughout the north of the
country villagers have been pro-

cessions by marching and by

The inhabitants of one village
reacted to an RFD plan to plant
eucalyptus around their farm-
land (eucalyptus is the tree that
loggers, bureaucrats and politi—
cians everywhere usually mean
when they say ‘reafforestation’:
it grows fast, but it is alien, it is no
good for wildlife. and a forest of
it sucks most of the water out of

the ground for miles around) by
burning down forestry officials’
houses. Elsewhere, villagers
have destroyed RFD green-
houses and planted more than a
million fruit trees on land ear-
marked for eucalyptus. .

Other, more formal protests
have come from the same organi-
sations that won the day on the
Nam Choan dam—WWF-Thai—
land, the Siam Environmental
Group, the Society for the Con-
servation of National Treasures
and Environment, the Mahidol
University Center for Wildlife
Research, and the Project for

the large importing nations—
most notably Japan—appeared
to be softening towards agree-
ments that would guarantee
‘sustainable harvesting’ of rain-
forests. In an attempt to see if
such a thing is as possible as
environmentalists say, and at a
cost of $3 million, the I'lTO set
up its first forest-management
project in Brazil’s Amazon state
of Acre.

Meanwhile, Brazil has asked
Japan for a hundred times that

giving the Asian nation direct
access to the world’s largest

Afrlca ﬁnds a newvmous c1rcle

Development must grow from within, says Lloyd Timberlake

FRIGA often seems nothing but
Vlcious circles. Individual poverty
_ means big families; big families
1ncrease poverty. National poverty means
more export crops; more export crops
mean lower prices for the exports. But these
problems are old hat. Africa is now in
danger of sliding into yet another, cruelly
1ron1c, seldom discussed, vicious curve.

The present economic fads of the indus-
trialised North—“free market” economics,
Reaganomics—are beginning to work their
way into the thinking of many Northern
development agencies and experts.
Impatience has led to the cry: “Let’s stop
fooling about with peasants and go for the
big fix: factories and industrialised farming,
all guided by the magic of markets. It works
for us.”

The major ﬂaw in this thinking—so huge
that it is usually overlooked—is that Africa
has no markets, not in the sense that these
thinkers mean.

Sub-Saharan Africa has well over 400
million people; well over 300 million of
them live in the countryside, the vast
majority being subsistence farmers. In an
average year, 150 million do not get enough
to eat to carry on a normal working life.
The per capita GDP of that part of the
continent fell by just under 3 per cent a year
from 1980 to 1987, while its population
grew by just over 3 per cent. Where is the
market? Where are the consumers?

John Kenneth Galbraith, the American
economist, has pointed out that no area of
the world—not Imperial Russia, nor
Europe, nor North America—“deVeloped”
without ﬁrst developing its countryside,
where its majorities lived. It is only by
getting schools, clinics, transport and
markets into the bush that governments
can develop markets for city goods and a
slow, steady inﬂux of educated workers
into cities. Encouraging the South to indus-
trialise rather than improve the lot of the
farmers, Galbraith has said, “is next only to
our failure to perceive and act on the
consequences of nuclear conﬂict, the most
compelling error in social perception in our
age”.

But that error was first made back when
most of the African colonies became coun-
tries in the early 19605, when development
planners—African and Northem—looked

That is the new circle. We seem to be
coming around again—after a quarter of a
century of development work—to what
French agronomist Rene Dumont
described so eloquently in 1962 as a False
Start in Africa. That false start was so
persistent because it also produced an
education system in “independent” Africa
based on European syllabuses, which
encouraged people out of the countryside

Recently, the amount of grain—mostly
wheat and rice—imported into Africa has
exactly matched the needs of cities. Afri-
cans are being taught not to eat what Africa
grows. Unable to sell their harvests for a
reasonable profit, unable to earn money to
reinvest in their land to conserve soil and
water, unable to find jobs in the capitals.
peasant farmers stay poor. African leaders
and their Northern advisers say, “See, they
lack initiative”—just as Europeans said
when they ruled Africa.

That is not the whole story; nothing in
Africa is. The crisis produced a split reac-
tion. Some development experts are for
imposing Northern solutions amid African

 

 

 

 

 

but rarely gave them skills of much use in
the cities.

Then came the great drought and famine
of 1984 to 86, and even some ofthe biggest
development institutions realised that the
only way to produce “big farmers” and big
agriculture was to develop “small farmers”
and small agriculture until it got big.

Given the slightest chance, these farmers
have been quick to seize on possibilities.
Farmers in parts of Kenya took to hybrid
maize much faster than farmers in the US.
Peasant farmers have become rich in the
few nations where the terms of trade are not
stacked against them: Kenya, Ivory Coast,
Zimbabwe. But in most nations, farmers
are paid little so city prices stay low. As
farmers produce less, cities are fed on
imported grain surpluses from the North.

The sweet olives of Saudi
Arabia

The country of origin of the strain of
olive Olea europaea from which culti-
vated varieties were developed has
never been positively identified, but is
believed to be in the Mediterranean
area or in south-west Asia. All the olives
in cultivation have bitter fruits and they
need steeping in brine or saltpetre to
remove the bitterness before they can
be eaten. Sheila Collenette, however,
found that some wild olives growing in
Wadi Habaqah, 33 km south—east of
Baljurshi in Saudi Arabia, were sweet
when she sampled them by chance in
1983. Previous observations of sweet
wild olives have been reported in the
literature in both Saudi Arabia and

Egypt. but no one seems to have in—
vestigated further. Collenette has since
found sweet olives in other locations
in Saudi Arabia and proposes that the
possibility of propagating them is
explored and that investigations should
be made to determine whether the soil
and climate play any part in producing
sweet olives. The habitat of the wild
olive in Saudi Arabia is very re-
stricted—the species grow high in
mountains of the Hijaz and the Asir on
red granite between 1500 m and 1800
m. Many trees are very old. but muti~
lated by being lopped for fodder and
fuel, and there is very little natural re-
generation because of grazing pres-
sure. The trees fruit sparingly but there
are some good years.

conditions—another false start. But many
governments and institutions pledged to
begin again, nursing African solutions out
of African conditions: appropriate (not
small, but appropriate) technology, appro-
priate science, appropriate institutions.

Chemical fertiliser is a perfect example of
the many inappropriate technologies being
called for (New Scientist, 30 June, p 89),
not because it would not improve fertility,
but because Africa cannot have it. It cannot
have it because Africa cannot afford to buy
it or make it and no one is giving Africa
much.

If Northern donors were taking Africa’s
plight and Africa’s needs seriously and were
ready to follow a “big fix” strategy over
several decades and back it with billions of
dollars, then some Northern solutions
might stand a chance. But annual Official
Development Assistance to Africa from
countries belonging to the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development
rose hardly at all from 1980 to 1987; long-
term, non-concessional loans were halved.
whereas other capital actually continued to
leave the country.

African farming must become more
intensive. But who can do this besides Afri-
can farmers? For the intensification must
fit the realities of the African environment
and of the farmers’ resources. As a West
African farmer told a development worker:
“You cannot turn a calf into a cow by plas-
tering it with mud.” In other words, African
development must grow from Africa, and
not be slapped on from outside. [3

 




 

Small Aid Project in Philippine Village
Tries to Avoid Misguided Efforts of Past

By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

RONDA, the Philippines—This coastal
village of barren hillsides, stunted corn
and fished-out waters is the stuff ecolo-
gists’ nightmares are made of.

Loggers chopped down the trees. Farm-
ers burned off the brush and pulled up the
mangroves. The rains stripped away the
exposed topsoil and carried it down to the
bay. The silt smothered the coral. Fish
died. Desperate fishermen lobbed home-
made bombs into the water to blast re-
maining fish to the surface. Some blasted
off their ﬁngers and arms.

“Life was hard,” says fisherman Lorito
Cereno. “Our catch was so small we could
barely eat three meals a day.” “Some of
us didn’t even have rubber thongs,” adds
Ponciano Lirazan.

Signs of Hope

The hillsides are still bare and rocky,
but today Mr. Lirazan sports a pair of rub-
ber thongs. Down by the water’s edge, fish-
erman Juan Soliva has decorated his parti-
cle-board hut with Save-the-Mangrove
posters. High in the boughs of a nearby
tree, villagers have built a bamboo lookout
for spotting fish poachers. And above the
town, yellow cornfields show stripes of
dark green bean bushes—a first stab at
contour farming.

The changes are part of a World Bank
project to breathe life into the central Phil-
ippines. It will cost $25 million over its
five-year life—a pittance by World Bank
standards—and it has raised eyebrows in
Manila’s bureaucratic circles.

As well it might. After decades of multi-
million-dollar, big-equipment projects to
clear jungle, lay down asphalt and displace
villagers, the World Bank has a reputation
as something of a scourge among biolo-
gists and social scientists. Around the
world. bank critics cite project after proj-
ect where the bank's beneficiaries might
have been better off without the loans.

Unrealistic Planners

The bank isn't solely to blame. Its loans
are channeled through Third World gov-
ernments. and planners in capitals like
Manila can be hopelessly out of touch with
village reality.

In farming. for instance, the Philippine
government has favored large-scale flat-

lands crops like sugar and corn, Lu,“
though most farmers in places like Ronda
live on hillsides. But Manila classifies hills.
as state-owned timberland, even though
Ronda's hills are thickly populated and
covered only with cornstalks and an occa-
sional coconut tree. Because the land is
state owned, the hill-dwellers can’t get title
and live in fear of being evicted.

They refuse to grow trees. Trees take 25
years to harvest. Every so often, govern-
ment foresters truck in thousands of ma-
hogany seedlings, and the villagers play
along with the “reforestation.” When the
trucks leave, they rip up the seedlings and
replant their corn.

Likewise in fishing, agencies have
dredged ports, financed boats, built ice
plants, and sold bigger and better nets.
The fishermen latch onto the equipment in
the beginning, fish the water bare, and are
left with the debt. The fish catch has been
falling for years in the Philippines, but un-
der former President Ferdinand Marcos
officials covered it up. “Back in 1981, it
wasn’t politically wise to admit there was
overfishing," says Frederick Vande Vusse.
a marine biologist on the World Bank pro—
gram here. '

Besides, nixing costly boats, ice plants
and mahogany seedlings would have
meant missing out on skim and bribes.

Big Is Beautiful

Donor nations also tend to prefer big
projects. “There is a kind of unwritten
rule,” Mr. Vande Vusse says. “If it’s
money coming from a participating gov-
ernment, the legislative body of that coun-
try expects a significant percentage to
come back." Whether they need them or
not, farmers and fishermen get fertilizers
and ice plants purchased in the dOnor
countries. First World engineers get con-
tracts, and First World consultants get
fees. Government officials get rich.

Attitudes here started changing in the
19705 when Andrew Mercer, a British
World Bank official, made aerial surveys
of the central Philippines. He declared that
much of the topsoil was gone and predicted
disaster. In 1980, he started drawing up
plans for the region. He included 25-year
land-use contracts, the closest thing possi-
ble to a title deed on the governmen-
owned “timberlands.” artificial reels
made of bamboo. contour plowing and
other simple devices.

Convincing his peers in the develop-
ment community was a slow process.

“I had a fisheries guy from the Food
and Agriculture Organization in my office,
looking for all the traditional elements of a
fishing project,” recalls Mr. Vande Vusse,
who worked with Mr. Mercer in the early
years. “Ice plants. Ports. Motors. Nets. He
kept screaming at me, ‘Where’s the proj-
ect? Where‘s the project?’ He couldn’t see
how the World Bank was going to approve
a loan that didn't have a lot of foreign
costs."

When the funds finally came through,
technicians moved in. They were required
to live in the villages, often in palm-leaf
huts without electricity. They were forbid-
den to hand out equipment unless the lo-
cals really wanted it. Convincing the vil-
lagers was slow work. '

”In the beginning, we believed the prc
gram was useless,” says fisherman Saba--
Bobier, who has seen many development
technicians pass through Ronda, leaving
plows, nets and problems in their wake
“We thought the bamboo was just monej~
thrown into the sea.”

Making Converts

But the technicians ferried Mr. Bobier
and others to another island, where an ar-
tificial reef had been in place long enough
to become a fish spawning-ground. The
men came back converts.

Now there are more than 7,000 artificial
reefs near Ronda. Some mornings, out on
the bay, the azure surface boils with fish.
Fishermen no longer need bombs. Their
diet has improved. Some have new nipa—
palm roofs on their houses.

“Some. even use [metal] sheet roofing,"
says Mr. Bobier. For a Ronda fisherman, a
metal roof not only keeps a household dry,
it can also catch rainwater. A fisherman
with a metal roof doesn’t have to paddle
across the bay to get drinking water.

But the World Bank loan is only good
for another year, and project managers
fear the money will run out before the new
ways take root. So they are looking for new
loans. A parade of development agencies
has passed though Ronda since 1986, sizing
up the possibilities. .

“We haven’t had a single taker,” sighs
Mr. Vande Vusse. “Our project doesn’t
cost very much, but it’s done exclusively
with Filipinos, we don’t need to buy any-
thing overseas except a mOtOI‘CyCIP 31‘ two.
And that is the kiss of death. ‘

Call to unleash dieldrin on locust plague

E WORST plague of locusts on
record 18 now eating Africa’s crops.

But European governments and
other donors will not give African author-
ities the only pesticide that agﬁculturalists
say could save the situation.

The pesticide is dieldrin. Donors do
not supply it because it is banned in Europe
and the US. Scientists

saving some 5 million hectares of crops.
“But they dld not eradicate the locusts,” he
says.

The problem, .says Brader, was that
fenitrothion, the insecticide which is now
most commonly used to kill locusts, does

 

believe dieldrin could
cause less environmen-
tal damage in Africa
than in temperate coun-
tries, and less damage
than the “safer” pesti-
c1des now being used to
replace it. But they say it
IS impossible to prove
their case without more
research.

The locust plague
started in 1986 when the
rains returned after
Africa’s last drought.
Desert locusts lay eggs
during dry periods. The
eggs hatch after rains
and eat up the local
greenery. Then they form swarms which
rampage over large distances, stopping only
when the food runs out. The present
swarms started in Ethiopia and Sudan,
then moved to Chad in 1987. War and
unrest helped prevent control teams from
operating effectively and some swarms
escaped to lay eggs which hatched this
year.

Experts say civil unrest may not have
been the major reason the initial control
efforts failed, however. Locusts massed on
the borders of farming areas in Algeria,
Morocco and Tunisia this spring. Lukas
Brader, the head of locust control at the
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
of the UN. says authorities there were well-
organised and equipped and did a good job.

dieldrin to lie in wait for locusts. It requires
more money and vehicles than most locust
control agencies can muster.

.“From a purely toxicological point of
View, no one can dispute that spraying
two or three times as large an area
with fenitrothion has a greater immediate
environmental effect than dieldrin,” says
Brader.

American and European aid agencies
refuse to supply dieldrin. This is not
because of “straightforward consideration
of the facts”, says Brader, but for fear of
the domestic, political repercussions of
shipping banned pesticides to Africa.

People have been killed and injured, and
wildlife has been damaged in developing
countries, by pesticides that had been

not persist on the ground after spraying. It
will kill the insects if dumped on them
when they have massed together but it will
not lie in wait for swarms of insects, as
dieldrin will.

Because they were not intercepted by a
persistent poison such as dieldrin, locusts
survived in the north African desert last
winter. They hatched this spring and
moved south with the winds over the Sahel.
Locusts are now laying eggs throughout
Niger, Mali, Chad and Sudan. Bands up to
100 kilometres long of young locusts, or
hoppers, have been seen, says Brader.
When they form swarms, they will destroy
this year’s crop, one of the Sahel’s best ever.
The swarms may not stop moving east till
they reach Rajasthan in India.

Brader says: “In the old days, we would
just spray a barrier of dieldrin, at 30 grams
per hectare, on about 10 per cent of the
infested area, and quietly wait for the
young locusts to hop into it.”

As agriculture in Africa has expanded
with the growing human population,
locusts have had more consistent supplies
of food. Dieldrin, say scientists at the FAO,
was all that kept swarms in check after the
last big plague was halted in 1963. But now
“we can only use fenitrothion,” says
Brader. Fenitrothion is considered environ-
mentally safer because it breaks down
quickly. But this also means it cannot be
used to form traps for locusts. Around 500
grams per hectare must be sprayed directly

banned in industrialised countries, but
were exported by their manufacturers to
cut losses. The practice has evoked wide-
spread protest among aid groups and
environmentalists. The Dutch parliament
last week protested about the use of large
quantities of insecticides to ﬁght locusts in
Africa. Friends of the Earth in Britian
opposes the use of dieldrin.

F enitrothion may be no less damaging to
the environment than dieldrin. Humphrey
Crisk, of the British Trust for Ornithology,
has studied the persistence of dieldrin in the
tropics. Half of a sprayed dose of dieldrin
takes three years to decompose in
temperate zones, which is one reason why it
has been banned there. The greater heat
and ultraviolet light of the tropics, however,
breaks down the same amount of dieldrin
in about four months. Fenitrothion has a
half-life of around a month in the tropics.

There have been few studies of the
environmental impact of fenitrothion, says
Crick. Larks show signs of paralysis after it
has been sprayed. Mike Rands of the Inter-
national Council for Bird Protection, in
Cambridge, says large water birds have
been found dead after fenitrothion has been
sprayed. Experts at the FAO say birds have
been poisoned by fenitrothion sprayed on
grasshoppers, and that the pesticide could
cause “similar mortality” to dieldrin.

Rands says the quantities of dieldrin
used to control locusts might well cause less
damage than the larger amounts of

fenitrothion used. But without better
observations, it is impossible to tell. The
council is trying to obtain money from the
EEC to launch a monitoring programme.
“The science has to be done, and we are
extremely interested in doing it,” he says.

Geoffrey Howe, announced another

Fruit farmers blind to the beneﬁts of bats

FARMERS who slaughter fruit bats
because they consider them to be pests
may suffer still greater losses in production
because the bats cross-pollinate their fruit
trees. The 180 or so species of fruit bats are
threatened throughout the world’s tropical
and temperate zones by pest
eradication schemes, hunting
for game. and deforestation.
Two spec1es of Pteropus bat
from Micronesia in the Paciﬁc
are. already thought to be
extinct and a growing number
are endangered.

Concern over the plight of
bats that feed on fruit and
nectar has been heightened by
mounting evidence for their
crucral role in pollinating and
dispersing the seeds of more
than 500 species of plants and
trees. These include banana,
mango, guava, kapok and sisal,
plus varieties of cactus,
mangrove and valuable hard-
wood trees. Such plants have
evolved to be pollinated by
bats. Their blossom produces
large amounts of nectar during
the night.

The Chiroptera Specialist
Group—a branch of the
Species Survival Commission
of the International Union for
Conservation of Nature and Natural
Resources—has just launched an action
plan to protect Pteropus.

As part of the intensiﬁed research effort,
a zoological expedition from the University
of East Anglia is monitoring populations of
bats 1n the Comoros Islands in the Indian
Ocean. Paul Racey, of the department of
zoology at the University of Aberdeen,
chairs the specialist group. He expects the
report to propose the designation of roost-

ing sites as nature reserves and to recom-
mend laws that forbid dealers from selling
bats for food.

On the American-run Paciﬁc island of
Guam, fruit bats are a traditional delicacy.
Pteropus tokudae has been hunted to

not all Pacific islands are party to the

extinction, and islanders now import
frozen bats from neighbouring Micro-
nesian islands as well as from Papua New
Guinea and Queensland, Australia. This
state, under pressure from farmers, recently
declared four species of fruit bats as
vermin.

“Pteropus is a big genus,” says Tim
Inskipp of the Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species, “and many
of the 70 species are under threat.” Political

.. countries.

I‘M There are still many healthy
colonies of fruit bats around
the world. Fruit farmers
commonly regard them as
pests, but the bats prefer to eat
ripe fruit while farmers usually
harvest fruit before it ripens.

In the US, the Federal Regis-
ter reported recently that “the
loss of fruit bats threatens the
future of the entire southwest-
ern desert ecosystem”. Earlier
studies had shown that bats are
important pollinators. They
transfer pollen and cross-
fertilise plants. In the absence
of bat pollination, seed pro-
duction by century plants (the
Agave cactus) dropped by a
factor of 3000 according to a
study by Merlyn Tuttle, the
director of Bat Conservation
International, a group based in
Texas. “About 20 species of
giant cacti in the [US] south—
west are heavily dependent on
bat pollination,” Tuttle says.

The Agave cactus, which is used in the
production of the drinks, tequila and
mezcal, is pollinated by bats that feed on its
nectar. One depends on the other so if one
declines, both suffer.

“It’s a vicious spiral,” says Tony Hutson
of the Flora and Fauna Preservation
Society in Britain. Hutson believes that, by
curtailing the pollination of wild fruit by
killing bats, fruit farmers are putting their
own prosperity at risk. [:1

£1 million of aid for locust control in
Africa. It is not clear if any of the money
will be for research.

The operations now underway could
provide enough data to decide the issue, if
observations are made. Crick says that 3-6
million hectares of land were sprayed last
year with 340 000 tonnes of pesticide, some
12 per cent of which was dieldrin bought by
Sahelian countries with their own money.
A thousand tonnes of food laced with the
insecticide lindane, an organochlorine like
dieldrin, was spread as bait for hoppers. Its
environmental impact is unknown.

Early this month, scientists at the Pan-
African Ornithological Congress, in
Nairobi, sent a plea to the FAO asking for
a full-scale environmental assessment of
alternative methods for controlling locusts.
Crick, and Ya Ntiamoa-Baidu of the
University of Ghana, wrote the request,
which called for monitoring of control
operations against locusts now under way,
especially in areas with special needs for
conservation. One of the last populations of
bald ibises might be threatened by the
tonnes of fenitrothion sprayed in Morocco
this summer.

Even if diedrin were shown to be safer in
the desert than fenitrothion, European
donors could not currently provide it.
According to the European Commission in
Brussels, the EEC would still be bound by
policies which state that pesticides banned
in member countries may not be donated

 

to the Third World.

In a recent summary of what data is
available on the environmental effects of
pesticides in the desert, the FAO says the
scattered spots of desert greenery where
locusts thrive are also critical for other
desert species, so spraying might have wide-
spread effects. “No systematic investi-
gations have been carried out” on how
climate affects the fate of pesticides, or how
desert creatures respond to spraying, says
the FAO. “Ecological assessment of
pesticide impact [in the desert] is not neces—
sarily a straightforward copying of data
gathered elsewhere.”

The FAO recommends “carefully
monitored trials”, as well as monitoring of
spray campaigns. “For both dieldrin and
other less persistent chemicals, studies
quantifying ecological side effects are badly
needed.” Scientists at the FAO suspect that
they now overestimate the damage caused
by dieldrin on desert ecology; but that “if
we go lower, on the basis of the existing
data, we’ll be wiped off the ﬂoor by adver-
saries of dieldrin use and we wouldn’t have
much to stand on.”

The scientists say they “will not put
dieldrin into widespread use for hopper
control again”, until they have more data.
Meanwhile, the locusts keep eating.
“Pressure groups tell me that if I can prove
there will be hunger and suffering without
dieldrin, we can use it,” says Brader. “I
wonder how much hunger and suffering
they will need.” D

A mine for bats

A 364% vacant-land donated to. the;
US Fish and Wildlife Service by the
Pilot Knob Ore Company of St Louis
contains an abandoned iron-ore mine
in which 140,000 Indiana bats Myotis
sodalis—one-quarter of the species's
entire population—spend each winter.
The Service will construct barriers and
signs to prevent people entering the
caves; disturbance during hibernation
is a major cause of the species’s
endangered status. Pilot Knob Mine,
along with two other cave sites in
Missouri, two in Indiana and two in
Kentucky, house three-quarters of the
world population of hibernating
Indiana bats. and by the end of 1987
it was expected that all these sites
would be protected by barriers.

Environment Lobby Says Tha
Waste Disposal at Bases
Still Fosters Pollution

 

By WARREN E. LEARY

Special to The New York Times

WASHINGTON, Aug. 16 — An envi-
ronmental group charged today that
activities at American research bases
in the Antarctic are polluting their sur-
roundings and that the United States
Government has not done enough to
protect wildlife there.

The charges were made in a study by
the Washington-based Environmental
Defense Fund. Bruce S. Manheim Jr., a
lawyer and scientist with the environ-
mental group, said that the United
States is a major offender when it
comes to polluting Antarctica and that
the National Science Foundation has
been slow to carry out sound environ-
mental policies in the region.

The foundation, which administers
American activities in Antarctica, con-
ceded that there had been some prob-
lems but said that steps were being
taken to remedy them.

America operates four of the 57
bases used by 18 nations for scientific
research on the continent, which has an
area roughly the size of the continental
United States and Mexico combined.
Antarctica is administered under an in-
ternational agreement signed in 1959
called the Antarctic Treaty, which es—
tablishes the continent as a demilita-
rized scientific preserve.

“We believe, like our critics do, that
as the last pristine environment on
earth, Antarctica should be protected,”
said John B. Talmadge of the Polar
Programs Division of the foundation,
the agency that administers all Amer-
ican activities on the frozen continent.
“But there may be disagreement on
how fast we are doing it.”

“We’ve made many efforts in the
last few years to clean up the results of
earlier scientific expeditions and ac-
tivities,” Mr. Talmadge said in an in-
terview “Environmental standards

Tourism posing a threat to the vulnerable

luxury hotel on the frozen continent cater-
ing to afﬂuent cross-country skiers?

Though the remote and largely barren Antarctic
will never rival the Caribbean islands as a vacation
playground, its pristine, icy wilderness has been
attracting increasing numbers of tourists.

Operators of a cruise ship did consider a voyage
to Antarctica (though the idea was scrapped).

Yes, Australian entrepreneurs want to build the
first luxury hotel on the desolate continent.
(Whether their government grants permission re-
mains to be seen.)

Amid all this is one certainty. Tourism has estab-
lished a permanent presence in the Antarctic, with
some 3,000 visitors arriving last year on vessels
during the long spring and summer daylight.

the fragile Antarctic environment’s vulnerability.

The climate is so harsh that even the animals and
plants which have best adapted to it lead a mar-
ginal existence. A relative lack of biological diver-
sity reduces nature’s capacity to rebound from even
minor disruptions of the ecological balance.

Moreover, scientists need pristine sites as base-
line models for their research, and they have only a
minimal amount of time to act as tour guides.

Yet tourist intrusions upon these sites and the
researchers’ work are becoming more common.

The National Science Foundation is in charge not
only of our research in Antarctica but of regulating
the American tourist industry there.

In theory, NSF can impose penalties of up to
$10,000 and a year in jail for environmental malfea-

Alaskan Breaks the Ice With Japanese Delicacy

Associated Press

ANCHORAGE, July 28—Alaska
ofﬁcials have begun regulating har-
vests of icebergs, which are being
used in Japanese beverages as gour-
met ice cubes at about $3 a pound.

The Department of Natural Re-
sources plans to issue permits F ri-
day for Tim Dimond of Juneau to
collect ice in southeastern Alaska.

Dimond contacted state 'officials
to ask whether he needed permits
and later said he wanted the per-
mits to reenforce, for overseas buy-
ers, the legitimacy of his ice-gath-
ering business, said Andy Pekovich,
the department’s acting land and
water manager for southeastern

2'33 initiated this,” Pekovich said,
m that a permit “is to every-

one’s advantage” and that anyone
else in the ice-collecting business
will be expected to get one.

Dimond gathers icebergs with a
crane on a ZOO-foot barge and
breaks the ice into chunks for ship-

ment in freezer vans bound for

Seattle.

AK-Pacific Inc. further breaks
down the ice, packs it in one-kilo-
gram sacks and ships it to Japan,
where a bag sells for about $6.80.

In Japan, glacial ice is enjoyed for
its novelty and durability.

Glacial ice lasts about twice as
long as an ice cube from a refrig-
erator and has no trace of chlorine
or other additives, according to Jim
Harper, vice president of AK-
Pacific.

“It’s a gourmet type of product

that complements the Perrier, min-
eral water situation,” he said.

The permits limit Dimond’s prox-
imity to campsites used primarily
by kayakers and specify ice-collec-
tion hours to prevent harvesting
when sightseeing ships are in the
area.

To protect hauling grounds for
seals, he cannot collect ice within
10 miles of a glacier.

The permits will allow Dimond to
collect 1,000 tons a week.

Southeast Alaska Conservation
Council officials oppose the har-
vests. “This is a new, incompatible,
conﬂicting use of areas set aside for
their natural features, their soli-
tude, their pristine nature,” said
Bart Koehler, the group’s executive
director.

Antarctic

sance such as wildlife desecration and pollution.

There are no ofﬁcial guidelines for appropriate
tourist behavior, however, nor any established en-
forcement mechanism for the NSF to carry out its
mandate. Consequently, there has been little actual
direct NSF supervision of tourist activity so far.

Even though American travel companies for the
most part seem to have acted responsibly, the NSF
fears that the situation could get out of hand due to
the recent surge in tourism.

Already, there are indications of stress.

Tourist outings to Palmer Station. a US. scien-
tiﬁc base, have increased from four in 1984 to 38 in
1988. Some researchers complain they are falling
behind in their work.

Certain popular penguin rookeries are receiving
heavy visitation from tour vessels, and the birds
appear to be getting edgy. .

US. tour boat operators have tried to assuage the
NSF by asserting that visitation will always be
modest due to the treacherous weather, the isola-

tion and the enormous cost of reaching the area.
Authorities believe tourism can be compatible

with a healthy Antarctic environment provided that

strict guidelines are promulgated and followed.

NSF’s enforcement capabilities will probably be .
strengthened in a year or two. Another change in
the works is to more strictly regulate the number
and location of tourist visits so that sensitive sites
are not overwhelmed.

A brochure is likely to be developed to instruct
v131tors to. keep at least 15 feet from penguins and
seals, avmd stepping on the 400 species of lichens
and in general leave the area as they found it.

. Even if all this comes to pass, NSF has jurisdic-
tion solely over US. nationals. Citizens of other
countries need answer only to their own govern-
ments. ~

Antarctica will thus have to be a genuine com-
mon concern, or it will soon cease to be unique.

Environmental activist gets his chance

Thirteen years ago, Brice La-
londe was a spunky, dungaree—clad
maverick who had founded the
French chapter of the environ-
mental activist organization
known as Friends of the Earth.

Most of his time was spent
leading street demonstrations and

other protests against an ecologi?

cally insensitive national govern-
ment.

Today, the 42-year-old Lalonde
is France’s Minister of Environ-
ment.

His recent surprise appoint-
ment by the government of Presi-
dent Francois Mitterrand is
roughly tantamount to our presi-
dent naming noted biologist Barry
Commoner or some other militant
ecologist to head the Environmen-
tal Protection Agency.

Lalonde’s designation is all the
more startling, given that contem-
porary France has not displayed
appreciably greater environmen-
tal sensitivity than it did in 1975.

It still lags behind much of the
rest of Western Europe in support
and implementation of many envi-
ronmental protection reforms. '

For example, while auto emis-
sion control devices and the use of
unleaded gasoline are becoming
commonplace in Germany and the
Netherlands, they are rarely en-
countered in France.

The French government has
even pulled back from endorsing a
EurOpean Community proposal
that all member states halve their

 

Flattau

 

car exhaust emissions by the early

- 19903.

Paris apparently retreated un-
der pressure from the French auto
industry, which has trailed other
car makers in producing cleaner
models and wants more time to
meet anti-pollution standards.

French manufacturers Such as
Peugot’s chairman Jacques Calvet
fear that their late start toward
pollution abatement might bar the
sale of their cars in other Euro-
pean countries that intend to
implement the cleanup on sched-
ule.

Calvet even goes so far as to
say that though he’s committed to
cleaner air, the placement of cat-
alytic converters on automobiles
is prohibitively expensive and un-
wieldy.

His words certainly have a
hollow ring, considering that the
state-owned auto manufacturer
Renault has reluctantly conceded
it can meet the anti-pollution stan-
dards within an acceptable pricing
framework.

But even more to the point of
our story, Calvet’s defiance has
infuriated the .newly appointed

Lalonde.

”When you listen to Calvet,"
Lalonde said publicly, “you get the
impression that cleanliness is a
Germanic vice and dirtiness a
French virtue.”

Previous environment min-
isters had not been in the habit of
Openly denouncing the powerful
French auto industry.

I was thrilled because it meant
that the man who is now minister
had changed little from the street-
wise activist I met in Paris 13
years ago when Friends of the
Earth, despite its significant local
grass-roots following, was largely
ignored by officialdom.

In those days, Lalonde was so
concerned about the rapid and
unchallenged pace at which
France embraced nuclear power
generation that he and his charges
sent for the full transcripts of our
congressional hearings on the pros
and cons of atomic energy.

They then proceeded to trans-
late the text into French and
distribute it to deputies in the
National Assembly.

Lalonde was a gadfly, yet even
in those difficult times, he exhib-
ited a pragmatic streak absent in
some other French environmental
activists.

Though he mounted protests
against the political establish-
ment, he was willing to work
within the system to bring about
reform, an inclination obviously
instrumental in his being where he

istoday.

To the disgust of some ideolog-
ical environmental purists, La-
londe ran several times for the
National Assembly as an indepen-
dent.

In 1981, he sought the presiden-
cy of France as head of a newly
formed ecology party. With vir-
tually no organization, he actually
won 3.8 percent of the popular
vote, a tribute to the aforemen-
tioned strong grass-roots senti-
ment for envirOnmental
protection.

Lalonde’s squabble with Peu-
got also illustrates, however, that
while he has not abandoned his
principles in exchange for high
office, his power has definite limi-
tations. °

The French bureaucracy is too
pervasive, well-entrenched and
steeped in autocratic tradition for
one minister to transform it over-
night.

Lalonde will thus undoubtedly
endure much more frustration in
his quest to improve France’s en-
vironmental record.

But at least instead of picket-
ing in the streets, he can now
make his case across the desk
from the chief of state.

The process of change in
France has shifted into higher
gear.

Administration Shifts Stance

said, and the crowd obligingly booed

hearing that James Watt and Anne
Gorsuch and Rita Lavelle are environ-
mentalists too,” he added, referring to
the former Secretary of the Interior
and two former officials. of the Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency.

‘Diluted, Delayed, Destroyed’

Mr. Dukakis, who seemed energized
by the crowd’s enthusiasm, went on to
say that Mr. Bush had called for “zero
tolerance” for those who pollute, “but
lul‘ sewn, and a half years, he’s pr.-
vided zero protect“... for the environ-
ment.” Mr. Dukakis said Mr. Bush had
led a task force on regulatory reform
that “diluted, delayed and destroyed
scores of regulations to preserve our
environment.”

He said the Vice President “stood by
and did nothing while they tried to dis-
mantle” the program to clean up toxic
waste and “supported the President’s
veto, not once but twice, of the Clean
Water Act.”

Bush and the Environment

Then, narrowing his attack to an
issue of keen interest in California, Mr.
Dukakis declared, as he has previous-
ly: “He’s done more somersaults than
an Olympic gymnast on the subject of
offshore drilling off the California
coast. When he’s in Texas, he’s for it.
When he’s in California, he says, well,
maybe not.”

While the audience cheered, Mr.
Dukakis said, “My friends, we need a
President who won’t change his posi-
tions with the time zone.”

Ina formal statement :42; the environ—
ment, Mr. Bush has either ignored or
been noncommittal about offshore oil
drilling and its environmental impact.
For example, in reply to a question by
the League of Conservation Voters on
whether he would favor legislation to
overturn a Supreme Court decision
preventing state restrictions on the
drilling, Mr. Bush said only, that he
would “review” such legislation. Mr.
Dukakis has said he favors such legis-
lation.

Mr. Dukakis also signaled a new line
of attack on Mr. Bush, one used against
the Vice President before. “George
Bush has a resume,” the Democrat
said. “I’m proud to say I’ve got a
record."

The rally in Buena Park ended a two-
day swing through California in which
Mr. Dukakis focused on crime and the
environment. Along the way, in a series
of three closed fund-raising events and
receptions, he raised close to $1.5 mil-
l‘rm for the Democratic Party’s Vic-
tory Fund, according to Anthony Pode-
sta, who heads his California cam-

paign.

 

 

port for the environmental movement.

Clifton Curtis, president of the
Oceanic Society, said be perceived “a
significant shift in attitude” nation-
wide, adding that telephone calls and

. letters to his Washington-based re-

search group were two to three times
what they were at this time last year.

“We’re receiving calls from all

over,” he said, “not just from people
who live along the coast. They’re wor-
ried about what’s happening to the
oceans, too.”

Lester Brown, president of the
Worldwatch Institute, said the experi-
ence at his research organization was
much the same. “We may be crossing a
pert eptual threshold,” Mr. Brown said,
adding that “we’re seeing an elevation
of public awareness,” with people “fi-
nally starting to understand that we
can kick nature only so long before na-
ture starts kicking back.”

Contributions Are Rising

Paula Hayes, director of develop-
ment at the New York headquarters of
the Environmental Defense Fund, said
that contributions were up about 20
percent this summer.

Officials at the Natural Resources
Defense Council and officials of other
organizations said they, too, had been
receiving more mail, more phone calls,
more inquiries, contributions and of-

fers of help. They said that in many in- ‘

stances these expressions were from
people who had never been involved
with ecological issues.

In Congress a spate of environmental
bills has been introduced and recently
formed bipartisan Congressionl groups
like the Long Island Sound Caucus and
the Hudson River Caucus have begun
working on envirnonmental initiatives
intended to aid their areas.

In politics, homage to the need for en-
vironmental protection has become a
standard part of each political party’s
message. President Reagan once
mocked concern about acid rain by
saying some of the acids were
produced naturally by trees; both
Presidential candidates, Vice Presi-
dent Bush and Gov. Michael S. Duka-
kis, are making the environment in
general and the oceans in particular
and an issue.

In his speech accepting the Republi—,
:an Presidential nomination Thursday?

night, Vice President Bush mentioned
the problems of floating medical
wastes, sludge dumping in the ocean
and acid rain. “I am going to stop
ocean dumping,” he said, adding that
he would also “have the F.B.I. trace the
medical wastes” and “reduce the
harm done by acid rain.”

Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, the Demo—
cratic Presidential nominee, has also
emphasized the environmental issue.
At one point he journeyed off the Jer-
sey coast by boat to emphasize his
worry about ocean pollution.

‘Just Started to Get Scary’

Several environmental advocates
said they thought wider support of new

 

 

 

tects the earth from dangerous radia-
tion.

“I think that for a lot of people it’s
just started to get scary,” Mr. Brown
said.

A majority of Americans, 65 percent,
agree that “protecting the environ-
ment is so important that require-
ments and standards cannot be too
high, and continuing environmental im-
provements must be made regardless
of cost” according to a New York
Times/CBS News Poll conducted last
month. Twenty-two percent disagreed
with this statement in telephone inter-
views conducted July 5 through 8 with
1,177 adults.

There is no meaningful statistical
difference between these numbers and
those from January 1986, the last time
,the question was asked, when 66 per-
jcent agreed and 22 percent disagreed.
g Before 1986, the percentage of respond-
ents who agree had increased steadily
since September 1981 when the ques-
tion was first asked, and 45 percent
agreed that protecting the environ-
ment is this important and 42 percent
disagreed.

Environmental groups say they hope
to tap this wide support in seeking
vastly increased government expend—
itures on research and development of
advanced sewage treatment and recy-
cling plants, industrial and agricultural
toxic waste treatment and other
projects long viewed as lacking in
voter appeal.

Environmentalists are also calling
for stricter laws and enforcement
against contamination of the water, air
and land, increased energy conserva-
tion and a shift to cleaner energy
sources and more limits on growth and
development, particularly along the
nation’s beleaguered coasts.

‘Throwaway Societies’

To be sure, the medical wastes mar-
ring the New York metropolitan re~
gion’s beaches this summer are not the
first developments to bring about
greater environmental awareness. A
year ago, a Long Island garbage barge
:wandered the Atlantic in search of a
‘harbor to dump in, vividly illustrating
that “throwaway societies are running
out of places to throw things,” said Mr.
Brown.

The dying dolphins that washed up
along the East Coast about the same
timewere yet another symbol of dis-
ruption of the natural ecology.

It is still not certain that the pre-
dicted global warming linked to a
buildup of certain industrial pollutants
in the atmosphere is a significant fac-
tor in either the severe drought that
,has plagued large parts of the country
,or the heat wave felt from New York to
‘ Moscow to Shanghai.

But this greenhouse effect and other
developments are “starting to make
people understand that we’re putting
too much strain on the system,” said
Peter Bahouth, chairman of the board
of Greenpeace U.S.A., an environmen-
tal advocacy group.

 

 

 

tive and aggressive about using the
powers available to us.”

“We have been bringing in record
numbers of charges, indictments and
convictions,” he said.

Last week the Senate unanimously
passed a bill outlawing disposal of sew-
age sludge at sea within four years. Ob-
jections were lodged by New York City,
the nation’s foremost sludge dumper,
but the state’s two Senators, whom the
city had been counting on to derail the‘
legislation, signed on as co-sponsors.
They said they had undergone a change
of heart on defending the integrity of
the ocean.

An Abrupt Change on Sludge

One of the clearest milestones of how
much attitudes have changed is that
for half a century New York disposed
of its sludge just 12 miles from shore
with little public outcry. At the start of
this year, the city agreed to switch to a
site more than 100 miles off the coast,

, and yet, abruptly, dumping at that loca- ‘
"tion became intolerable to the nation.

Mr. Reagan himself has changed his
position, agreeing to freeze emissions
of nitrogen oxide, an important air pol-
lutant, as part of an international
treaty to curb acid rain. As recently as
198.3, the Administration had refused to i
take part in a similar accord. E

Federal legislation aimed at reduc-~ -
ing acid rain has also recently been in-
troduced in Congress. The legislation is
based on a compromise between the
states with many coal—fired power ‘
plants and factories emitting sulfur ’
dioxide, which is transformed chemi-
cally in the atmosphere and falls to
earth as acid rain, and the states that
are suffering most where it falls.

Both Parties Nod to Environment

Some officials are beginning to con-
sider whether stringent restrictions on
burning fossil fuels may become
needed to reduce the buildup of carbon
dioxide, the gas that researchers say is
the main contributor to the greenhouse
effect.

Just how high a priority the next
President will actually give the war on
environmental deterioration remains
an open qtiestion: the environment will
compete with the military and social
welfare. The cost of a serious environ-
mental rehabilitation effort could run
to hundreds. of billions of dollars, ex-
perts say.

“Ten years from now one may look
back on this time as a seminal moment
when people began to look quite differ-
ently at these problems,” said Jessica
Tuchman Mathews, vice president of
the World Resources Institute, a policy
research center -in Washington. “But
we shouldn’t kid ourselves. It’s going to
be a long, bumpy road.”

because of Australia’s tough im-
port laws.

While McBride was to have been
sentenced Aug. 15, the judge re-
served judgment, saying it may be
time for a “stern measure of retri-
bution” to serve as a warning to
others. McBride faces a maximum
$100,000 fine or five years in jail
for each of his two offences.

Alastair Wilson, public relations
officer for Australian Customs
Service, described the McBride
operation as one of their most suc-
cessful in years.

“He’s known to have come in
and out of Australia several times
before,” he said. “It’s possible he’s
part of a regular courier network
of illegal smuggling of birds.”

Maﬁa connection

Australia has some of the world’s
toughest laws banning importation
and exportation of animals, and no
Australian bird can be legally trap-
ped or exported. Around them has
developed a multi-million-dollar-a-
year illegal export trade, which is
suspected to have drug and Mafia
connections.

Few newspaper reports on the.
subject fail to mention former
Mafia boss “Big Vinnie” Teresa.
who was charged in the, United
States in 1979 after authorities
seized $1 million worth of Austrae
lian bll‘lis

He later told the FBI bird smug-
gling from Australia had become
an increasingly lucrative part of
American Mafia operations and
was linked with drug-trafficking.

While they have their suspicions,
conservationists and law enforce-
ment officers here have no hard
evidence that either the Mafia or a
substantial amount. of drug money
is involved.

Frank Antram, local head of
Traffic, an international organiza-
tion which monitors the legal and
illegal world trade in wildlife, said
there are only a dozen prosecutions
of bird-smugglers a year. They are
mostly picked up at airport cus-
toms after the birds are found
drugged and stuffed into suitcases
adapted with ventilation holes.

It is believed many more ani-
mals are sent through the mail,
transported by boat or private air-
craft. The casualty rate is high, but
dead birds can be sold to taxider-
mists.

While an oft-quoted figure for
the black market value of illegal
bird and reptile exports is $40 mil-
lion, Antram'says he does not want
to put any figure on it.

There Were also four panther skins and 140 kilograms (200 pounds)
of wild animal meat, the daily said.

Restaurant owner Lin Huiheng, a Hong Kong emigre nicknamed "Big
Nose,” was fined 30,000 yuan (8,000 U.S. dollars) plus 16,000 Hong
Kong dollars (2,250 U.S. dollars).

“As with drugs. it’s difficult to
know how much is getting
through,” he said.

The proposed labelling order
was the result of mounting public
concern about suffering caused by
use of the leg-hold trap, which has
been banned in 66 countries includ-
ing Britain, but is still widely used in
Canada, the USA and the Soviet
Union. Public opinion against the
wearing of fur is increasing. Abacus
Research reported in 1986 that in
Britain 74% of people are morally
opposed to the wearing of fur, 83%
wanted a complete ban on the
trapping of animals for fur and 74%
were equally opposed to fur farming.

An immense number of animals
are trapped in North America. III
1977, well over 20 million pelts were

numbers killed that did not have
saleable fur and the so-called "trash"
animals: animals whose fur has no
commercial value. Surveys produced
by conservation organisations show
that the number of "trash" animals
trapped is almost as high as that of
the ”target" animals.

British parliament.

These records would have been a
surprise to many British MP5 for in the
Canadian parliamentary debate the Hon. Bill
McKnight, Minister for Indian Affairs and
Northern Development, said: “The trappers

take action and ask other Canadians to join
them, which 1 as an individual am prepared

The article continued by saying that "the

corroborated by Survival International,

whose main concern is the human rights of.

Indian people, particularly land rights and
rights to education in northern Canada which
are largely ignored, though they do not have
a policy regarding trapping. One wonders if
the trapping issue is a smokescreen to hide
more important problems.

Many Canadian animal welfare organisa-
tions are opposed to the cruelty of trapping.
The president of the Canadian Society for
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals wrote to
Mrs Thatcher applauding the proposal for
the labelling of fur and ended the letter by
saying, “The Canadian SPCA and its 22,000
members stand firmly behind you and your
government in this critical initiative".

The wearing of fur is a moral issue
concerning what is right and wrong, by
conscience if not by law. Trapping involves
cruelty, which is the deliberate infliction of
suffering. The ends do not minimise the
suffering, nor is trapping necessary for
mankind's survival and well-being. Excellent
man-made, artificial fur and warm garments
are available. Resulting unemployment
problems are a matter of management.

“What of it?" say the trappers.
"Nature is just as cruel and profli-
gate." At first glance, nature does
seem to be a random and cruel busi-
ness. But in the wild, through natural
selection, prey species have become adapted to
being preyed upon, so that if they escape. they
soon recover and resume their normal behav-
ioIJr. ffthey did not, they would die. It IS wdl
I: no .-m that a rabbit caught by a stoat candiein

When normal painful stimuli are inflic-
ted upon vertebrate animals, their nervous
systems produce pain killing, morphine-like
substances called endorphines. But this can
only occur when the animal suffers a painful
stimulus for which its species has become
adapted through natural selection. Unfor-
tunately, man inflicts injuries on wild
creatures to which they are not adapted.

Numbers of animals in the wild are finely
balanced. As food supplies become scarce.
reproduction falls off. As prey animals
become less numerous, they are harder to
catch. But man has solved this problem and
can ignore normal biological checks and
balances. IIe alone can choose to be cruel
and profligate.

South Africa
checks ivory
racket claim

OUTH Africa’s Defence

Minister, General Mag-

nus Malan, has ordered

an inquiry into allega-
tions that the military have
been involved in a huge ivory
racket leading to the decima-
tion of Angola‘s elephant popu-
lation.

The allegations include
claims that South Africa and
the Unita rebels have nearly
wiped out Angola’s elephants to
ﬁnance the war in that country.
The ivory has allegedly been
transported by the army across
the Namibian border at Rundu
,— the crossing at which South
African troops last week staged
an ostentatious “withdrawal”
from Angola for the media.

 

The decision to hold the in«
quiry follows detailed charges
made at a recent US Congres-
sional hearing that “a massive
smuggling ring" has been oper-
ating in Africa for years “with
the complicity of South African
ofﬁcials at the highest levels.”
The South African defence
force denied the allegations, but
has agreed to investigate after
pressure from the parliamen-
tary opposition.

The allegations were made at
a Congressional sub-committee
hearing on US enforcement of
the Convention on Interna-
tional Trade in Endangered
Species. Monitor, a consortium
of American environmental
and animal welfare organisa-

Ivory Boycott Urged

'SGVe Elephants' Drive in S.F.

By Jim ‘Doyle
Chronicle WAWrtter

Warning that the African
elephant may soon. become ex-
tinct, environmentalists and an—
imal rights campaigners urged
Chinatown shoppers yesterday
to boycott stores that sell ivory.

The elephant population has
plummeted throughout Africa. they
said, because of the est’s continu-
lng demand for jewelry and art ob-
jects carved from the. wild beasts’
ivory tusks.

In Chinatown, a dozen demon-
strators denounced what they
called “the illegal ivory trade," in
which llong Kong merchants alleg.
edly pay poachers to slaughter
whole families of elephants in Afri-
ca.

but Chinatown merchants,
who said that the ivory trade is suf-
ficiently regulated. dismissed the

protesters‘ warnings as exaggerat-
ed. lvory imports and sales are
down, they said, because of rising
costs.

The estimated $500 million
worldwide ivory business has re-
cently emerged as a conServation
issue. A bill is pending in the Con-
gress that would ban wary imports
from areas, such as Hong Kong, that
do not have wild elephant popula-
tions.

"There isn‘t anywhere in Afri-
ca where elephants are safe right
now, and that includes game reserv-
es and national parks,“ said Rick
Bernardi, an environmentalist.

Other protesters held photo-
graphs show mp. fallen pachyderms.

which South Africa was playing
akey part.

Monitor’s vice-president, Mr
Craig van Note, described
South Africa as “one of the
largest wildlife outlaws .in the
world” and accused the coun-
try’s military establishment of
having “cynically aided the vir-
tual annihilation of the once-
great elephant herds of
Angola.”

Mr van Note said that Angola
and South Africa “have ruth-
lessly liquidated perhaps
100,000 elephants to help ﬁ-
nance the 12~year-old conflict.
Most of the tusks have been
carried out on South African
air transports or trucks. al-
though some move through
Zaire and Burundi.

“The sturdy South African
four-wheel-drive trucks that
carry war materiel and other
supplies across the Caprivi
Strip to Savimbi’s forces in
southern Angola return with

 

ivory and valuable tropical

hardwood.”

He said the traffic was being
managed by “two former Portu-
guese colonists from Angola
who have close ties to the South
African military.”

Mr van Note also claimed
that South Africa was involved

in poaching in Zambia and Mo-
zambique. He said the MNR re-
bel movement in Mozambique
was using ivory poaching to f1-
nance its insurrection.

“Other heavy flows of ivory
to South Africa have been com-
ing out of Zaire, Botswana and
Tanzania,” he said.

“The preferred - and easiest
—~ form of transporting all the
poached ivory is on the many
military and civilian transport
planes that fly north from
South Africa dozens of times
each week delivering arms,
medicine, food, machinery and
other supplies throughout cen-
tral and southern Africa.”

Most of the ivory was shipped
from South Africa to Taiwan —
which was “rapidly replacing
Singapore as the Far Eastern
outpost for wildlife smuggling”
-— as well as to China and India
and probably the United Arab
Emirates. ’ ‘

Although the South African
military have dismissed the al-
legations as “ludicrous,” the
Unita leader, Mr Jonas Sa-
vimbi, was quoted in a maga-
zine interview earlier this year
as saying that South African
Defence Force assistance had
been repaid with supplies of
ivory and teak from Angola.

Making Wildlife Protection Pay in Africa

By KATHLEEN KOURIL

HARARE, Zimbabwe—Wildlife conser-
vationists here have been hawking a board
game devised by the “Save the Rhino”
campaign. Next year they may well be
urging us to buy elephant-ivory necklaces
and crocodile-skin handbags. For when Af—
ricans are allowed to make souvenirs and
money out of wild animals legally, they be-
come keen to protect them. And conven-
tional conservationist tactics are not work-
ing; many large African mammals remain
endangered. In Zimbabwe, a country long
respected for its well-run national parks,
13 rhinoceroses on average are being taken
out each week. Why?

The simple answer is: money. Poaching
continues because park officials in most
African countries haven’t the resources to
adequately police their reserves, and be-
cause those in some countries are bribable.
Africa’s safari/ tourism community is still
enraged over events in the Masai Mara
last year when Kenyan officials allowed a
hunting party of influential Middle Eas-
temers to shoot dozens of buffalo, antelope
and elephant in an obscene recreation of
the days of the great white hunters—right
down to the group photograph with car-
casses.

The more profound answer behind the
simple one is also money. For the great
mass of Africans, simple rural people, pro-
tecting wild animals doesn’t pay. Never
mind about long-term benefits and price-
less ecosystems. Wild animals are simply
a nuisance, eating up crops and occasion-
ally small children, and competing with
cattle for grazing space. Poachers often
pay off local people to warn them when
park rangers are about, so if protecting
wild animals doesn’t pay, endangering
them sure does. And for chronically under-
nourished people, knocking off the odd im-
pala seems a justifiable (and delicious)
way to avoid hunger.

The wildlife industry is reckoned to be
worth between $100 million and $200 mil-
lion annually in Zimbabwe. Tourism and
related souvenir industries keep Kenya
ticking over. Hunting safaris in particular
earn whopping revenues for African gov-
ernments. One can shop around—a license
to shoot an elephant costs $1,000 in Tanza-
nia, almost $2,500 in Zimbabwe—but the
combined costs of safari, fees and “tro-

wildlife “to those who directly bear the
costs,” i.e. themselves. The Zimbabwe
Trust, a coalition of foreign firms with
blocked funds to spend, is helping them.

The Zimbabwe trust is proposing local
management of the area’s wildlife re-
sources. Not just hunting revenues are de-
sired, but also game-ranching projects, 10-
cally based cooperative tanneries, meat-
processing facilities and souvenir work-
shops. Intensive farming of fish, crocodiles
and ostriches is envisaged. For example,
the Department of National Parks recently
estimated ostrich farming alone could be-
come a $20 million export business.

There are naysayers on grounds of prin-
ciple. Wildlife film maker Hugo van
Lawick, who lives in the Serengeti, says li-
censed hunting has provided a cover for
poachers in Tanzania and Kenya. Others
object to crocodile and ostrich farms, say-
ing that the animals are penned up, over-
crowded and badly treated.

The Nyaminyami trust is pitted against
a formidable opponent, the European Com-
munity. In 1985, the EC began a $170 mil-
lion, 10-year program to eradicate the
tsetse fly in southern Africa. Though many
Africans are beginning to question the wis-
dom of producing and exporting beef to a
Europe with a beef mountain, high invest-
ments in cattle ranching must be protected
from re-infestation by the pest.

It is impossible to eradicate the tsetse
fly from ranching areas and not from adja-
cent lands. As more and more tracts of
marginal bushland are relieved of the fly
they are also being relieved of their wild-
life, trees, ground cover and topsoil. One
simply can’t prevent rural Africans from
moving, with their ravenous cattle, onto
lands too poor to support heavy grazing
once the threat of bovine sleeping sickness
is removed. The zooming population
growth of most African countries ensures a
constant pressure on land already yielding
to the processes of desertification.

The noisy protests of the trust and other
conservation groups seem finally to have
reached the ears of EC officials, who re-
cently earmarked $2.5 million to support
efforts to keep cattle out, and wildlife in,
some parts of the areas involving tsetse
eradication.

Wild animals are more efficient pro-

making wildlife pay and contains rather
too much talk of cooperatives.

Of course, the trust would not want to
increase inequalities in wealth by putting
resources into any private individual‘s
hands (though it is working to secure ten-
ure over land and the natural resources on
it for local chiefs for the benefit of their
communities). However, to date the most
successful “harvesting” of wildlife has
been in the private sector, such as at the
crocodile farm at Victoria Falls.

People in other wild parts of the world
are realizing conservation can pay. Fisher-
men on the Caribbean island of St. Lucia
have set aside land for a nature reserve
and agreed among themselves on new fish-
ing practices to save endangered reptiles
and fish—and the fishermen’s livelihoods.
In Annapurna, Nepal, villagers have re-
gained control over local woodlands after
30 years of government mismanagement
left them with tragically depleted, forests
and a shortage of firewood.

“Managing” wildlife for the common
good rather than “protecting” it for gov-
ernment ministers’ pockets seems the only
hope. One hopes the common good is up to
the job. In the Okavango, a team of gov-
ernment rangers sent out for the common
good to destroy a sick and dangerous ele-
phant spent two weeks accomplishing noth-
ing. The night I was there, poachers work-
ing only for their own good and the tusks,
neatly did away with the poor creature
with one shot.

rica, writes on the less-developed world.

Park guards shot
by poachers

IUCN President, Dr Monkumbu Swami-
nathan, has sent a message to the Govern-
mentofSenegal expressing his regretover

the deaths of two park guards and the
wounding ofa third by elephant poachers
in the Niokola Koba Park. The deaths
occurred in late May, shortly after the
completion ofan IUCN study to examine
the environmental impact of a road
through the Park. Weeks previously,
another guard was also killed by poachers
in the Saloum Park. The area is in the
south—east of the country near the Guinea
border, and for some years poachers in
search of ivory and big game meat have
posed problems.

Dr Swaminathan expressed regret over
the deaths, and renewed assurances that
IUCN wished to support the Government
in its battle against poachers.

ducers of protein on poor lands, says the
trust—not that the fine balance between
wildlife grazing and the carrying capacity
of the land is always maintained. In north-
ern Botswana, where the poor quality of
their ivory protects elephants from
poachers, the elephant population is out of
control and has eaten and knocked down
many square miles of scrubby forest.
On an increasingly crowded and impov-
erished continent, clearly, wildlife has to
be “managed” if it is to be saved. By at
least thinking about giving incentives to lo-
cal people to conserve wildlife, the Nya-
minyami trust is moving in the right direc-
tion. Yet so far the trust seems plagued,
like many development projects, with
rather woolly ideas about the mechanics of

phy” processing usually come to more
than $20,000 for a two-week jaunt.

Most African governments pay lip serv-
ice but not much else to the principle of
plowing those hunting revenues back into
the rural communities. In Zimbabwe,
where records are actually kept, from 1982
to 1987 the central government handed
back only 49.5% of the revenue generated
from wildlife to a fairly representative dis-
trict, Nyaminyami. along Lake Kariba in
the northwestern corner of the country.

groups—are trying to return the benefits of

Besieged Elephants Find Ally

By JANE PERLEZ
Special to The New York Times

KORA ROCK, Kenya — This is
George Adamson country, five miles
south of the Equator, a harsh region
blanketed with sandy soil and prickly
gray thorn bushes and populated by
wild game and Somali nomads.

It is from here, in the isolation of
eight thatched huts, that Mr. Adam-
son, who with his wife, Joy, created
the legend of Elsa, the lion of “Born
Free,” has spent the last 18 years
roaming over the 580 square miles of
the Kora National Reserve.

After separating from his wife, who
was stabbed to death years later, in
1980, by a herdsman, Mr. Adamson
set up camp to nurture young lions,
return them to the wild and then re-
main their friend. The name of his
base is Kampi Ya Simba, Swahili for
Camp of the Lion.

But it is not only lions that'Mr.
Adamson is concerned with these
days. '

rich mahogany, a mane of yellow-
white hair reaching for his shoulders,
Mr. Adamson has found a new and
compelling cause: a campaign
against the poaching of elephants,
valued for their ivory by interna-
tional traders.

“They’ve killed all the rhinoceros
and now they’re onto the elephants,”
Mr. Adamson said as he sat, in his
characteristic green shorts and san-
dals, over early morning tea in the
hut that serves as a mess and a feed-
ing place for his favorite ravens,
Mad, Bad and Worse, assorted mon-
keys, several starlings and a goat.
The morning before, he had found a
hunk of fresh elephant meat on a
track near his camp, clear evidence
that yet another elephant had been
shot‘

Along with a number of other con-
servationists, Mr. Adamson worries

that the elephant, once so numerous
all over Kenya, will survive in only a
few pockets of the country. A fierce
critic of what he calls the Kenyan
Government’s lax attitude to poach-
ers, Mr. Adamson is particularly
upset that elephants are killed for
their ivory in the reserve around his
camp where the animals are sup-
posed to be protected.

Numbers Are Disputed

Exactly how many elephants are
left in Kenya is a subject of hot dis-
pute between the Kenyan Govern-
ment and the conservationists. About
22,000 elephants still roam the plains,
the Government says. The East Af—
rican Wildlife Society says it is prob-
able that poaching has reduced the
herds to 6,000. The society’s chair-
man, Richard Leakey, asserted last
week that senior government officials
were involved in the poaching.

Whatever the number of elephants,
the murder of three rangers in the
Kora Reserve by poachers has
spurred the Government to say it will
take more concerted action.

“The Government is increasing the
manpower, training and equipment
available to rangers,” the Minister
for Tourism and Wildlife, George
Muhoho, said after the murders. In
the last four months, he added, 92 ele-
phants have been shot by poachers in
Kenya’s national parks and reserves.

Somali tribesmen, the suspects in
the three murders, hunt the elephants
in Kora. “They’ve got automatic
weapons — Russian and British ——
and anything else they can get their
hands on,” Mr. Adamson said. “The
rangers are supposed to go after
them with World War 1 British
rifles.”

Further, he and others say, the
rangers‘ salaries are so poor that
they are easily susceptible to bribes
paid by the poachers to ignore the
killing.

After a day of fruitless searching
for the elephant that he knew had just
been shot — Mr. Adamson believes it
is vital to find the carcasses so the
slaughters can be reported -— he dis-
patched a visiting pilot, David Allen,
to look for vultures from the air.

Not far from the airstrip, Mr. Allen
spotted circling birds. Back on the
ground, a half-mile drive from the
plane, were two freshly killed ele-
phants slumped in the thorn trees.
They had been killed in the last 48

hours. 'l‘heir heads were hacked off;
they lay in pools of blood.

The mother elephant, about 25
years old, had been shot in the side
and then, as it staggered forward,
shot again in the back, Mr. Allen said.
The 5-year-old baby met a similar
fate.

“They’re shooting anything with
any kind of ivory,” said an agitated
Mr. Allen, a former game warden,
hunter and now a bush pilot. The two
eleghants had very little ivory, he
sat .

Pessimistic Over Campaign

Mr. Adamson believes that his
presence in the reserve serves as a
protection, however small, for the ele-
phants. The Somalis know and the
Government knows, Mr. Adamson
said, that he will do all he can to re-
port the poaching and track the kill-

ers. But despite the Government’s
statements, his is probably a losing
battle, he said.

Mr. Allen agreed. “The Govern-
ment wants George out of here,” he
said. “They don’t want anyone
around so the poachers can work
more freely. I don’t think any interna-
tional wildlife organization should
give this Government a cent until it
commits to a policy that it professes
against poaching.”

For visitors landing at the gravel
airstrip in the stark and forbidding
wilderness here, the first sign of life
is nailed to a bare tree. “Lions on
road,” the notice says. “Buzz camp,
wait at strip until picked up. Kampi
Ya Simba.”

A second message stood out the
other day under the white midday sun
that accentuated the bleached bone

hue of the earth: “Gone to look for
poached elephant. Help selves to gih.
Back for lunch.” ’
As protection against animals, Mr.
Allen dragged wooden boxes from the
thin shade of a tree and fitted them
over the wheels of his small plane:
“They’ve had lions come along agd
eat the tires.” . '
While Mr. Adamson fumes about
the plight of the elephant, he recentjy
received some better tidings. ..
A month ago, he was presented
with three lion cubs, his first batch
since eight years ago when the Keit—
yan Government, concerned after;a’
lion killed one of his assistants, for-
bade him from receiving any more.
But in Mr. Adamson’s twilight yeai’s
the Government has relented. j,
“A farmer was granted permissen
from the Department of Wildlife to
give the orphaned cubs to Mr. Adamn
son and with the help of his assistanIs
he has been been bottle feeding them
milk and coaxing them onto sma‘l
slivers of meat. “a -
So the process of returning lions {0
the wild that Mr. Adamson and his
wife pioneered in the 1950’s has.
started again. A «12-year-old lioness,
called Growe, born near the canfp
and a continuing friend of Mr. Adam-
son, came back to the enclosure to
sniff out the cubs. “s
As Mr. Adamson and his visitofs
sat in the early dark, sipping before-
dinner whisky from glasses set on a
silver tray, a deep growl shattered
the peace. To the alarm of the vi§i—
tors, the lioness charged the enclo-
sure protecting the cubs. “I think
Growe wantsto take possession,” M'r.
Adamson said calmly. T
But he would wait until the culjs
were four months old and active
enough to keep up with the lioness be-
fore freeing them to her, he said. ”

In the meantime, Mr. Adamson
kept up his good terms with Growe.
With a spotlight in one hand and "a
slab of camel meat in the other, life
stepped outside the safety of the
camp enclosure and approached the
lion. “GroWe, Growe, come on
Growe,” he said ever so softly. 7;

The distance between Mr. Adam

,son and Growe was no more than “a

foot as the lioness grabbed the meat

him and then bounded back into the
dark. “ .

“You get to know them,” said Mr.
Adamson of the more than 30 lions h?
has befriended and taken on walks
like so many children. “Some I cah
trust absolutely, others I have to keep
a lookout for.” ,,'

THE ENVIRONMENT
Elephant Slaughter in Kenya

 

 

 

AS the deaths continue unabated, Muhoho engages Leakey in a quarrel over numbers

I T ‘is a quiet, moonlit night near Basadi in the Tsavo East National Park.
The only sounds that can be heard come from a distance: the incoherent
gigglings of a pack of h yenas feasting noisily 0n the rotting carcass of some
unfortunate animal and the eerie wails of some tropical birds of the night. A
herd of perhaps, a dozen or more elephants is gliding almost silently among
the shrubs and thickets that stand out like so many accusing ﬁngers in the

midst of the short savannah grass. The faint shufﬂing of the great feet and

the'snapping of twigs as the giant animals pass by only serve to emphasise
the silence. Unknown to the elephants, however, danger lurks very close at
hand. Suddenly, there is a sharp burst of automatic machinegun ﬁre from
close range and all hell is let loose. The animals break into a panicked rush,
- their huge bodies tearing through the shrubs with a thunderous rumble. But

not all make it in the mad rush for safety: three of the herd drop dead in their

tracks —— a large bull and two cows. Two more, - including a mere calf, fall to

their knees after only a short distance, mown down by the relentless ﬁre of

the unseen nemesis.

enya’s elephant population is

diminishing rapidly and there is

no doubt that‘poaching has
become a major contributor to the
decline in numbers. However, early last
week, a major controversy broke out
between the minister for tourism and
wildlife, Mr. George Muhoho, and the
chairman of the East African Wildlife
Society, Dr. Richard Leakey, regarding
where responsibility lies for the increase
in elephantpoaching activities around
the country, as well as the ministry’s
role in protecting wildlife, especially the

s.

endangered elephants. Muhoho had
called a press conference at the Nation—
al Museums of Kenya (ofwhich Leakey
is director) in Nairobi to announce that
92 elephants had been killed by poach—
ers over the past four months. The
minister expressed “regret” over the kill—
ings and promised that the ministry
and, indeed, the government, would do
their best both to track down thecul-
prits and to provide protection for the
beleaguered animals.

Muhoho’s expression of regret and

his promises were, however, quite in-

adequate to placate ardent conserva-
tionist Leakey, who called a press con-
ference of his own immediately after
the minister’s, in which he denounced
the “lip service” which he believes is
being paid by the ministry of tourism
and wildlife to the cause of wildlife
conservation in the country. Leakey
called the poaching a “national. crisis”
of great magnitude and challenged Mu-
hoho to tell the nation the truth about
the killing of elephants in Kenya.

The next day, Muhoho issued a harsh
retort to Leakey’s charges, and the

dispute threatened to escalate into a

personal quarrel between the two men.
In his press statement, Muhoho de-
plored Leakey’s attitude, and that of
the East African Wildlife Society
(EAWS). Muhoho said that Leakey
had attended his press conference in
Nairobi but had contributed no infor-
mation nor offered any clarification of

what was said. He went on to challenge
Leakey to name any “high— or low-
ranklng person” involved in the poach—
ing of elephants, in reply to implied
criticism by the EAWS that the ministry
is protecting some of its own officials
who are known to be involved in the
poaching.

The minister also wondered why the
society should doubt the validity of the
ﬁgure of 22,000 elephants in the coun—
try given by Muhoho during his press
conference in Nairobi.

Leakey was not to be muzzled and
wasted no time issuing his rejoinder; the
minister, he said, had already received a
confidential document listing the
names of people involved in poaching,
which Leakey said had been presented
to Muhoho by officials of the tourism
and wildlife ministry about a month
earlier. “I am reliably informed that the
matter is being investigated by the po-
lice and as such it is the minister who
should name names,” Leakey retorted,
according to The Standard newspaper
on Wednesday last week. “I know that
the minister got a copy of the docu-
ment. I did not get one.”

Leakey went on to contend that the
ministry’s claim that there are 22,000
elephants in the country was misleading

because, at the end of last year, there
Were only 20,000. He challenged Muho-
ho to tell the Country what action had
been taken against corrupt ofﬁcials,
especially in view of the fact that, early
this year, President Daniel arap Moi
himself declared that corrupt public
ofﬁcials .would be disciplined. “Can

week, ."_;- “ * . . . '- ‘ _ f g .

the many domestic animals — cattle,
goats, sheep and camels —— that graze in
the national parks and game reserves.

still increasing. We have a law which

elephants in the country, quoted by the
minister, came from the report of a
survey conducted last year by the Ken-
ya Rangeland Ecological Monitoring
Unit (Kremu). While he does not dis-
pute the Kremu ﬁgures, Leakey claims
they are outdated, and may have been
overtaken by events during the past few
months. He estimated the number of
elephants in the country to be closer to

{that the Kenya government is doing

nothing to preserve elephants in the
national parks”. The minister went on
to refer to Leakey’s attitude as a “chee-
ky white mentality” that holds that only
whites are concerned about the preser-
vation of wildlife. In making his racial
remarks, the minister carefully avoided
mention of Mr'. W.K. Rotich, who is
secretary to the East African Wildlife
Society, and who is equally critical of

that the purge would continue until “all

ential report Leakey referred to as
containing the names of suspected
poachers, Muhoho declared that there
was “nothing new” in it, contrary to
what “some people would like Kenyans
to believe”. In the same breath, he
admitted that it contained the names of
suspected poachers, and that his minis—
try has been actingon the report by
investigating the acaties of all those
named. ' -‘ ' ‘
Ifthis is indeed so, then it is apparent-
ly taking a long time to make the results
of the investigations known or to have
them produce any of the desired effect.
Conservationists remain unconvinced
that the ministry is doing much to stop—
or even reduce the poaching of ele-
phants in the country, and suspect that

. there must be powerful people involved

in the current spate of poaching to
explain the ministry’s seeming tardiness
in dealing with the poachers. The minis-
ter’s failure, so far, to provide adequate

answers to the conservationists’ con-

cerns. has further hardened suspicions
that the whole truth about poaching in
Kenya may. be far grimmer than the
government is willing to admit.
Olindo, the man with the onerous
task of protecting the country’s
wildlife as fhe director of wildlife con-
servation and management, says that
he backs fully the statements made by
Muhoho on the situation of elephants
in the country. During an interview

.with The Weekly Review in his ofﬁce in

Langata on the outskirts of Nairobi,
Olindo said that the ﬁgure of 22,000

elephants in Kenya is “authentic” and

can be veriﬁed statistically, scientiﬁCally
and through ﬁeldcounts. Olindo con-
tends that the ﬁgure of 20,809 elephants
contained in the Global Resource In-
formation Database (Grid) ofthe {Unit-
ed Nations Environment Programme’s
Global Environment Monitoring Sys-
tem (GEMS), of June, 1987; does not
include areas such as Mt. Elgon and
parts of Mt. Kenya and the Aberdare
ranges that‘are notgazetted as national
parks. “The national parks form~ only a
small part of the area of the Aberdare
ranges and Mt. Kenya; together with
the Mt. Elgon area, which has been left’
out (by the Grid count), there should be
another 3,000 elephants,” Olindo said.
He dismisses a suggestion by Leakey
that the government conduct. an ele-
phant census every six months as “6X-
pensive and impractical”, ‘

that face the elephant population in

he admits that,poaching also consti-

croachment on animal preserves and
the droughts that have killed many
elephants, as well as other wild and
domestic animals, have been the main
causes of the drastic reduction in the
elephant herds in Kenya, he says. There
is a great demand for additional land
for growing. food crops to feed the
fast-growing population and, as a re-
sult, the animals have been squeezed
more and more into a condensed area
: as they try to escape human activity. “I n
such stress situations, many elephants

however, discount the poaching prob-

poaching problem has become a na—
tional crisis. _

In the interview with The Weekly
Review, Olindo implied that
the poaching problem had also become
a security problem and said that his

department is now working very closely'

witlivthe security organs of the govern—
ment, such as the regular police, the
administration police, the General Ser-
vice Unit and even the defence depart-
ment. Muhoho had earlier made similar
remarks, indicating that the govern-
ment has now decided to mobilise more
than just, the game rangers and the
anti-poaching unit in areas where well-
armed-poachers have been killing ani-
mals, especially elephants, on a large
scale. There are increasing signs that at
least some of the poachers are crossing
the border or are being supplied'with

sophisticated arms from neighbouring

countries that may have ill intentions
against Kenya. Recently, when parlia-
ment passed a tough new firearms bill,
leading political personalities within
the Kenya government said that arms
were being smuggled into Kenya from
neighbouring countries in order to des-
tabilise the country; Leakey, ‘in his
recent press conference, said that the
current poaching activities amount to

“economic sabotage” against Kenya.

It is conceivable that some of the
arms, as well as the poachers who are
wantonly killing Kenya’s elephants,
come from neighbouring Somalia, with
which Kenya has had long-standing
territorial disputes, and many observers
believe that the current spate of poach-
ing may be directed from abroad. Ne-
vertheless, there is little to dispute the
fact that many ofthe poachers, whether
foreign-instigated or not, are Kenyans.
At least a part of the poaching activities

 

in Kenya are locally controlled by
greedy and powerful individuals, and
there is ample evidence that at least
some Of the officials of the ministry of

tourism and wildlife have been, and

may still be, collaborating with either
the poachers or the powerful under-
ground figures who control the illegal
ivory trade in and outside the country
—— charges that Muhoho has not come
out clearly to dispute, and which his
sacking of a number of senior ofﬁcials
of the .department of wildlife conserva-
tion and management for suspected
poaching collusion earlier this year
would seem to vindicate. In an earlier
interview with The Weekly Review,
however, Muhoho said that the main
problem that the ministry faces in fer-
reting out such culprits and bringing
them ‘to court is- gathering sufficient
evidence to ensure their conviction. Ol-
indo made a similar point when he
talked to The Weekly Review early this
week. “The one thing we have absolute-
ly no contol over is human greed, and
you cannot condemn people without
proof,” he said.

Some observersthink that Kenya’s
anti-poaching laws are too mild and do
not act as a deterrent to the Wanton
destruction of the country’s wildlife. It
is common for a man found with ele-
phant tusks or other wildlife trophies to
be jailed for a year or two, or even less.
Many conservationists favour much
stiffer penalties for poachers and some
even advocate the introduction of the
death penalty for those who kill en-
dangered species of wildlife such as the
elephant and the rhino. In the People‘s

Republic ofChina, for comparison, the
killing of the giant panda incurs the

however, that Kenya’s wildlife protec-
tion laws are adequate and that it is
only the enforcement stage that has so
far failed the nation. Laments one
conservationist: “How can you put the
death penalty on a person you are
unable to catch and take to court?”

-. The problems of both conservation-
ists and wildlife ofﬁcials charged with
the protection of Kenya’s fauna are

'vantage'of choOs'ing the time to strike.
ACcording'to Muhoho, poachers have
' been attacking spasmodically. He in-
formed The Weekly Review that there
was a lull in poaching activities in the

country after October last year, when.

the anti-poaching unit engageda large
gang of'poachers in a major battle.
Neither the minister nor any of his
ofﬁcials is willing to disclose the numer-
ical or the equipmentrstrength of the
government’s anti-poaching unit, for
the simple reason that it would give
valuable information to the increasing-
ly sophisticated and ruthless poachers.
Muhoho revealed, however, that the
ministry’s rnain anti- poaching training
institute at Naivasha is graduating 60
personnel every six months.

he-anti—poaching unit is now

reported to be trained along
.m111tary lines by police, GSU
iand .. army trainers Even : its
present commander is reported to
"havevbeenian army of ficer. AlthoUgh its
strength is not known publicly, many
people believe that :it is still too weak
and ill-prepared to be able to win the
war against the apparently well-armed
and organised poachers. When three
rangers were killed in an ambush re-
cently, the minister said that the minis-

try had requested and received the aid'

of regular, administration and GSU
police forces to track down the culprits.
Conservationists would like to see a
strengthened anti- poaching unit that is
able to handle its own battles without
the need to call in otherbranches of the
security forces. Others believe that the

 

ministry of tourism and wildlife may be
shirking its responsibilities and passing
them on to other branches of the gov-
ernment by claiming that the poaching
is a security problem.

Whatever the case may be at the
moment, the situation is reminiscent of
the mid-19705, when poaching became
a major national issue. The poaching
then was widely reported in the foreign
press as being controlled by powerful
personalities within Kenya’s political
hierarchy. A major government effort
in July, 1975, managed to recover thou-
sands of elephant tusks and other wild-
life tronhies that were destined for
illegal export. In August, 1974, the
government had banned the private
export of ivory, but the poaching con-
tinued and even increased for some
time. According to an article by a
freelance British journalist, Jon Tinker,
in early July, 1975, there were “per-
haps” 120,000 elephants in Kenya at the
time, but they were being “killed off for
ivory at the rate of 10,000 to 20,000 a
year.” At that rate, he predicted, Keny-
an elephants would be virtually extinct
within a decade. Fortunately, by the
year 1978, the killing of'elephants had
ebbed considerably as newly-
introduced anti-poaching measures be-
gan' to take effect. The situation then
remained stable until recent years,
when the killing of elephants has risen
alarmingly once more. Conservationists
are sounding the alarm once again, with
shrill warnings that, unless drastic mea-
sures are taken to stop the poaching, the
current elephant population, whatever
its exact number, may be completely

wiped out by the turn of the century,-

just 11 years away.
The public controversy between Mu-
hoho and Leakey, mainly about the

‘ numbers of elephants that are still left

in Kenya, provides little consolation for
either conservationists or the affected
animals themselves. There is ample evi-
dence that elephants in Kenya are being
killed for their ivory at an alarming
rate, and that the efforts of the ministry
of tourism and wildlife are still inade-

' ,quate to stop or even reduce the poach-

ing "of the endangered animals.‘ Last
weekend, even President Moi expressed
deep concern at the continued destruc-
tion of Kenya’s important wildlife heri-

tage. Unless the ministry does some-r

thing now —— and something new — it
may be too late for the elephant in

lephant poachers are experts at their trade, and they

come into the business armed to the teeth, not only

with sophisticated weapons of destruction, but also
with a thorough knowledge of their quarry, the geographi-
cal area in which they operate, and the ways and means of
avoiding any dangers that may face them, such as the
sudden appearance of game rangers, tourists or curious
inhabitants of nearby villages. In short, poachers are
prepared for everything —— including death at the hands of
the game’rangerswho hunt them. The prize for the multiple
risks the poacher takes is a few kilograms of a cream-
coloured hard substance called ivory, which forms the
elephants tusks. And although it is not clear what the
poacher 1n Kenya receives for his efforts from the sale of
ivory on the international market, it must be a sum worth
the risks. ; z; .

The poachers jijob also demands patience, toughness and
endurance because the amount and type ofwork involved 1n
stalking and killing elephants does not leave room for
weaklings AnOIher prerequisite for a would be poacher1s
cold blood: the way in which poachers mow down the
dwindling herds of elephants, using the most sophisticated
weapons like FN G3 and Kalashnikov AK '47 automatic
riﬂes, is nothing short of sheer brutality, wanton and
heartless in the extreme.

Once the elephant has been brought to its knees under a
hail of gunfire, the poachers, usually in groups of between
four and 20 people, move in quickly to saw or hack off the
tusks and even the head of the dead animal, often using
mechanised chain saws and axes. These days, a half-hour

hide in the nearby bushes, lookouts for their nefarious
colleagues. -

The sad thing about poaching IS that it is not necessary to
kill an elephant in order to get its tusks which can be
removed without harming the animal and, what is more,
will grow again within a number ofyears. Elephants break
their tusks in internecine fights and in other mishaps, and
the tusks grow again after some time, just like human hair
or nails. Indeed, in some countries such as India and
Burma, elephants are domesticated not only for work but
also to provide 1vory for their owners

In Kenya, the story is, unlo1tunately, quite different. A
few greedy people who would like to make money quickly
through the sale of ivory are wiping out the elephant herds

Elephants also depend heavily on the
availability of plenty of water; during a

Like human beings, elephants are
social animals, and appear to form two
different kinds of social group, separat—
ed by sex. Females stay in their basic
family units throughout their lifetimes;
each unit has an average of four cows
and their calves, although the number
may vary from one to 30. All ages are
usually represented in the herd, and the
elephant cows co-operate in the rearing .
of calves. As numbers increase, the
family unit may split into two, though
the sub-units retain some social ties.

Eyewitness‘Account
IT was just about ten to six on July 22 this year when a local tour operator (who
asked not to be named), his two assistants and two tourist clients, out on an early
evening game drive in Tsavo East national park, rounded a bend in the road on the
so-called river route, to meet a sight that brought the vehicle to "a sudden halt.
Before them, crossing the road, were “at least” 12 men, the first three with AK47
rifles casually slung across their shoulders, and all dressed in jungle fatigues. “My
first reaction,” says the operator, “was that they were our own forces, but then I
noticed that their f atigues were much darker and they all wore a white sash -— like a
rolled kikoi —— from shoulder to waist.” The tour vehicle was downwind ofthe men
crossing the road, so its presence was not'noticed for some 10-15 seconds, says the
operator, who sat with his clients and watched briefly until the group ahead
spotted them «- “at which point,” he says, “I backed off very quickly.” The most
astonishing thing, the operator says, was that when the men on the road noticed the
tour vehicle, there was barely any reaction —‘no fear, no panic, no shock: those
who were armed lowered their rifles as if in a half-hearted attempt to conceal
them, but otherwise the group merely continued on its way. The tour operator has
no doubt that the men were poachers —- the ﬁrst, three armed to kill the elephants
and the remaining members of the group the bearers of the spoils. The following
day, the tour operator retraced his steps and searched the area. On the river side of
the road, just near where he had seen the men, he found the first elephant carcass:

on the other side, over the brow of a nearby hill, lay another six -— all minus their

Paradise

THE giant animals roam freely on the
grasslands and in the bushes and ram
forests that cover much of the African
continent. Alongside Africa Is other
wild, natural fauna, the elephant is
found in great numbers throughout the
continent, and even the human being
and he live in peaceful .co-existence.

hat is the picture of an African

paradise many centuries ago —

one that no longer exists: today,
elephants are mainly conﬁned to a
narrowing geographical belt along the
centre of the continent, and almost
everywhere their numbers are dwin—
dlingat a dramatic rate. Animal res—
earch scientists and conservationists
paint a grim picture of the future of the
African elephant and warn that the
continent may be completely bereft of
elephants within not too many years
unless serious steps are taken to pre-
serve the existing herds.

According to recent studies, there has
been a 95 per cent decrease in the East
African elephant population in the past
decade alone, partly because of changes
in the ecosystem, together with pressure
from human-settlements and drought,
but largely and most significantly be—
cause of wanton poaching for ivory.
The most devastating reductions in ele-
phant populations have occurred in the
Sudan, in Ethiopia and in Uganda,
while Kenya and Tanzania also re-
corded drastic losses in the ’Seventies
and early ’Eighties. Dr. Iain Douglas-
Hamilton, ren'owned elephant expert,

says that Sudan may have lost as much'

as half its elephant population since
1975 “in the best scenario”; in the worst,

 

Sudan’s elephant decline may have
equalled that of its southern neighbour,
Uganda, which experienced a popula-
tion crash of 90 per cent in the space of
five years. In both countries, poaching
aided by a chaotic security situation,
has taken a heavy toll on the elephant
population.

In the other countries of the region,
Kenya, Tanzania, Somalia and Ethiop-
ia, both poaching and drought have
had serious negative effects on the
elephant herds. East Africa, has an
estimated elephant range of 1.866 milli-
on sq km, representing 26 percent ofthe
total range on the ‘African continent;
this now hosts only about 11 per cent of
the elephant population.

cntral Africa with' an elephant

ange of 3.372 million sq. km. (48

per cent of the total) is reported still
to harbour the largest number of Africa‘s
elephants by virtue of» the immense
range and the high proportion of forest
land in Central Africa, which provides
the elephants with effective protection
from their human predators. Zaire,
with its still largely impenetrable tropi-
cal rain forests, especially in the north,
is the country with the largest elephant
population in Africa, with estimates
varying between 350,000 and 500,000.
Its northern neighbour, Congo, as well
as Gabon and Cameroon, also have
significant elephant‘populations, with
estimates varying between 50,000 and
100,000 for each country. In Chad, the
elephant herds have been decimated
since civil war broke out in 1979, while

ed in the slaughter of elephants on an
unprecedented scale during the late
19705 and early 1980s. In the whole of
the region, elephant populations are
diminishing rapidly because of internal
and cross-border poaching. In the Gar-
amba National Park in Zaire, which
formerly had one of the densest ele—
phant populations in Africa, for exam-
ple, the number of animals is reported
to have declined by about 60 per cent
between 1976 and 1983.

In southern Africa, elephants are
reported to be decreasing in Angola
(estimated elephant population
41,000), Zambia (estimated population

55,000), and Mozambique (estimated

population 20,000). The elephant popu-
lations are reported to be stable or
rising in Botswana, Namibia, Malawi,
Zimbabwe and South Africa. The en-,
tire southern African region with an
elephant range of 1.476 million sq km
(21 per cent of the total African range)
contains about 210,000 elephants,
roughly the same proportion as the size
of the range. In some countries such as
Angola and Namibia, where wars have
been going on for a number ofyears, no
hard data is available onelephant pop—
ulations and their movements but, on
the whole, the southern African region
may be the onlypart of the African
continiznt where elephant numbersrare

of the international ivory trade, a big.
money business that stretches from the

East, where the overgrown upper incis—i

nothing more than, its ornamental va—
lue. The insatiable appetite for ivory

ties of poachers, who are slowly but
surely cutting down the African ele-
phant, to the extent that current projec-
tions estimate the extinction of the
great behemoth by the end of the centu-
ry.

Just as in the case of trade in narcot-
ics and various other illicit substances,
there is supply and demand for ivory, a
demand that nefarious businessmen are
ready to exploit for personal monetary
gain to generate a trade that no amount
of legislation or policing will stamp out
— as long as there is money to be made
out of-it. The chain starts in the wilds of

even boats and aircraft, mow down the
stately giant of the African bush at the
rate of 1,600 kills a week. T 1e tusks are

the ivory finds its Way to Burundi, a

The rest of the poached ivory finds its

way to the East African coast, where it
is exported by dhow to Dubai, an
autonomous state in the United Arab
Emirates that has become a major
staging point in the illicit ivory trade.
The CITES treaty covers only raw or
unworked ivory, providinga aloophole

that allows dealers from Hong Kong,

the world centre for the trade, to set up
numerous workshops where craftsmen
fashion the raw ivory into worked ivo-

ry, at which point it can legally be

exported to Hong Kong and onwards to
Japan, the world’s largest market.

Hong Kong has attempted to tighten up'

tion, early last month, that requires
proof that imported, worked ivory was
not originally illicit ivory; this seems
only to have had the effect of turning
dealers’ tentacles to other countries in
the region that do not have the same
restrictions, ehie efly Japan and to a
lesser extent, Taiwan and South Ko-
rea.

The basic philosophy of the CITES
agreement was that a legal and strictly-
monitored trade in ivory would go a
long way towards pushing the middle-‘
man out ofbusiness, and in the long run
come to end the demand for poached
ivory. But since it came into effect, at
the beginning of 1986, the illegal trade
has continued to thrive, even though
‘most producing countries are not har-
vesting suffrcient ivory to meet their
export quotas: acCording to data from
the CITES ivory unit, only 45 per cent
of the export quotas for the African
ivory-producing countries was met in
the 1986—1987 quota ' years, while 'a
large number ofelephants was reported
killed, the conclusion being that most of
the ivory produced was not recorded in
the legal trade, which handled a paltry
22- per cent of total production. This
means that ivory from a staggering
89,000 dead elephants entered the illicit
trade.network. _

Over the last few years, about 800
gmetric tons of raw ivory entered the
‘w0rld market from Africa, fetching
prices ranging from Kshs. 2,700 per
kilogram for a small tusk weighing
about 5kg to double that price for a
large specimen weighing 20kg or more.
On average, that represented a raw.
ivory trade worth some one billion
shillings a year at wholesale prices, a
figure that quadruples with workshop
and retail markups to a “street value”
of over 18 billion shillings. Eighty per
cent of the world ivory trade rs thought '
to be poached, and thus unregistered,
and in the raw state fetches about half
the price of quota ivory, a great incen-
tive for illegal dealers; once worked,

Relatively little of the massive amounts
of money involved trickle back to the
producing countries.

As_ long as there IS demand for carved

and the myriad other uses, there will be

Dear Mr. Nitze:

We are pleased to submit these comments on the UNEP "Draft
Protocol Concerning Specially Protected Areas and Wildlife in the
Wider Caribbean Region", dated August 16, 19885preliminary to
Mr. Lockwood's meeting with NGOs on October 4, 1988.

General Comments on the UNEP Draft

 

The UNEP draft contains many features of the Mediterranean
and Eastern African Region Protocols on Protected Areas and
Wildlife.' Regrettably, it does not significantly show
evolutionary develOpment beyond these historically important, but
limited, first efforts. However, one important new feature is
the provision in Article 16 — Creation of a Network of Protected
Areas for an annual meeting of Party “technical focal points" to
liaise with the RCU on technical aspects of the Protocol and
discuss matters "of joint interest and especially to propose
recommendations concerning' scientific, administrative and legal
information as well as the standardization and processing of
data".

Conversations with UNEP staff indicate that the draft was
designed as a "floor", a base to which the Parties can add new
concepts. We would have preferred to have had UNEP exercise
conceptual leadership.

 




The U.S. draft does indeed go well beyond the UNEP Draft and
is far to be preferred. Again, the Western and Eastern Workshop
Reports carry conceptual protocol development beyond the U.S.
Draft concepts and we hope the U.S. will examine them carefully
as a possible basis for inclusion in the U.S. position.

Specific Comments on the UNEP Draft

 

l. The Protocol Area is limited to marine, coastal and
estuarine areas. It does not include "related terrestrial areas,
such as watersheds, which may be designated by Party having
jurisdiction". It is a lost opportunity to significantly expand
geographic scope, and hence greatly expanded value of the
Protocol.

2. Lacks operational mechanisms to move from objectives to
positive actions by Parties.

a. Does not call for a separate division of the RCU, or
RCU augmentation to provide Protocol Secretariat
support.

Though it assigns scientific and technical support
responsibilities to the RCU, does not provide for a
Scientific and Technical Commission or Committee. The
technical focal point meetings do not go far enough.

3. Lacks provisions for annexes listing protected areas
and endangered and threatened species of wildlife, which have
been approved for listing by the Parties because of meeting
agreed standards for listing.

4. Lacks Party obligation to manage all wildlife so that
further species do not become endangered or threatened with
extinction. (This important concept is also not clearly
delineated in the U.S. Draft).

5. The paragraph on regulation of trade is limited to
wildlife "which originate in protected areas and are subject to
measures of protection". This is taken from the Mediterranean
Protocol and is woefully inadequate and unworkable.

 




In closing, we have already provided your staff and the
other interested Federal Agencies with a more detailed Comparison
Document, dated September 2Q, 1988. This document compares the
Eastern Sector WorkshOp Report with the UNEP Draft. As soon as
the Western Sector Workshop Report is available in English, it
will be included in a revised Comparison Document and distributed
to all Action Plan Governments and the RCU. For the organiza—
tions listed in Attachment to this letter.

Office of Management Authority
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
P.O. Box 27329

Washington, DC 20038

Dear Mr. Jones:

”’”w-Yﬁtzeﬁdms~ref@§enee~to~two permit
applications submitted by the Detroit Zoological Park~
(PRT— 730651 and PRT— 731162) to import a total of fgye
chimpanzees (Panmtmaglodytes) After revieWihg these
permit applications and all relevant documents, The
Humane Society of the United States (HSUS), and the
undersigned organizations, recommend that your office
deny these applications.

In permit application PRT-74116, the Detroit Zoo
requests a permit to import a single female
chimpanzee from a Mexican Zoo, San Juan de Aragon,
using a wildlife dealer who operates both in San
Diego and Tijuana, Mexico. The HSUS questions the
validity of the documentation that this chimpanzee is
indeed captive born. We request copies of the
original government import documentation for the
parents of this animal, as well as veterinary
certification of her birth in captivity. Without
such proper documentation, The HSUS requests that you
deny this permit application. There have been
reports recently of several chimpanzees being
smuggled from Africa to Mexico. While our government
cannot enforce CITES worldwide, it is incumbent upon
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to guarantee that
those animals never enter the United States.

Since Mexico is not a signatory to CITES, we
question how a proper CITES export permit can be
issued by Mexico. According to the permit
application, "A CITES export permit from Mexico will
be obtained upon issuance of import permit". We
hereby request that no import permit be issued by the

 




U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service until all export
papers from Mexico are in order.

The applicant notes that this chimpanzee will be
flown from Tijuana to Los Angeles, for a 60 day zoo
quarantine period. We question where the chimpanzee
will be quarantined, and under what conditions.
Furthermore, we question how the chimpanzee will be
transported from Mexico City to Tijuana. The Humane
and Healthful Transport regulations of the Lacey Act
cover transport both into the United States and
within the country of export. We request .
documentation that the transport conditions for the
chimpanzee within Mexico are strictly in accordance
with the requirements of those regulations, including
veterinary certification, and space, temperature, and
pressure Specifications.

In permit application PRT-730651, the Detroit
Zoo requests a permit to import four chimpanzees from
the Taronga Zoo in Sydney, Australia. Both this
transaction, and the one with the Mexico City Zoo,
are being handled by Zeehandelaar, a commercial
wildlife dealer based in New York. It has come to
our attention that a great deal of money is involved
in these transactions. If both of these importations
are truly an exchange of animals between reputable
zoos, for the purposes of captive propagation, we
question the necessity for the intervention of an
dealer. We also note that such a commercial
transaction in an Appendix I species, involving tens
of thousands of dollars, is a violation of both the
letter and spirit of CITES.

The applicant notes that the facility to house
these chimpanzees is still under construction.
Apparently, the number of chimpanzees that the
Detroit Zoo already has do not warrant a larger
facility. Rather, the zoo is building a facility in
anticipation of receiving more animals. We contend
that there are enough captive chimpanzees in U.S.
zoos today to adequately fill the needs of the
Detroit Zoo. We request documentation from the
Detroit Zoo as to the anticipated dispensation of

 




newborn chimpanzees. We would prefer that the zoo
start out with a smaller pOpulation, so that ample
space is available for newborns to remain within
their family unit.

Please keep me informed of the final
dispensation of this permit application. Thank you
very much.

Sincerely,

Dr. Susan S. Lieberman
Associate Director
Wildlife and Environment

On behalf of:

By FRANCOIS RAITBERGER
of Reuters News Service

MADRID — A small but fervent band of Spanish
animal lovers has declared war on bullfighting, infuri-
ating fans of the spectacle by branding it a national
shame.

“We have taken a lot of abuse. But many people are
on our side and tell us: It was high time, ” said Consuelo
Polo, head of the Association for the Defense of Animal
Rights (ADDA).

Seeking foreign support, ADDA has sent to all depu-
ties in the European Parliament — members of which
are elected by European Community countries — a
document graphically depicting the suffering of a bull
in the ring and calling its will to fight a myth.

“In reality, the bull galloping into the ring is a terri-
fied animal desperately looking for the exit,” it said.

At home, ADDA and other small animal rights
groups are confronting powerful lobbies.

Bullfighting is the second-most-popularpublic enter-
tainment after soccer in Spain. It arouses passion,
draws millions of spectators and provides a livelihood

.for thousands of people from toreros to breeders.

Polo was among a dozen protesters who chained
themselves to the gates of Madrid’s bullring recently to
try to keep them shut to the Saturday afternoon crowd.

Mocking arguments that bullfighting, a centuries-old
show, is deeply ingrained in Spanish culture, they
chanted it was “torture, neither art nor culture. ”

Insults flew, and bullfight fans closed in threatening-
ly. A frightened protester burst into tears before police
stepped in to prevent scuffles and cut off the chains.

Some 20 million people, including King Juan Carlos,
“go to the bulls” every year in this countrylof'38 mil-
lion. Fans say numbers are growing, cutting across age
groups and political opinions.

But others caution thatmfiguwresuare deceptiv?

“Bear in mind that lots of people attend many tights 1
son season tickets and appear as many times in statis- j
itics, ” said Carlos Briones, in charge of bullfight statis- :

1tlcs at the Interior Ministry.

1 “Bullfighting is not booming, far from it. And youths
1faced with a wide range of modern entertainment tend
to turn away from it,” he said.

He said that while seats are sold out for major festi-
vals‘in big cities like Madrid, Seville and Valencia,
rings often remain half empty for minor fights.

Surveys on the popularity of bullfighting show sur-
prisingly divided opinions on what is widely seen
'abroad as a symbol of Spain.

' According to the newspaper Ya, 50 percent of Span-

r1,111de haveno. interestin bullfighting. Only lg percent ,

fexpress keen interest, and most of them are over 40
§years old.
i ADDA complained that its views got little publicity
‘in the Spanishpress, while bullfights were reported atl
’length and often broadcast live on television.
: “It is the law of silence,” they wrote to the Europe-
, an Parliament, where some British deputies introduced
,a proposal to ban bullfights in France and Spain.

Yet, ADDA is acquiring a higher profile, and Polo
recently aired the group’s views in a television debate.
' The group wants to create bullfight-free areas in
_ regions, like northern Asturias, where bullfighting lacks
. deep roots. It calls for strict enforcement of a ban on
the admission in rings of youths under 14 and is study-1
"ing possible psychological damage to children from
televised bullfights.

Fans and professionals of the bullfight have reacted. . . ‘

with skepticism or outright hostility to pressure from
‘abroad.
