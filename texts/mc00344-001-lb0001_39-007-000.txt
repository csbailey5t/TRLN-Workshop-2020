A Schweitzer Laureate Rides Into the Sunset

For much of his 43-year—tenure in
{Tongress W. R. Poage, a west Texas
Democrat, has had the singular honor
of being a code word. Say Poage to
someone in the environmental move»
merit, a welfare-rights group or the
foodnstamp lobby and your meaning is
known: regressive, close-minded, dolt-
ish. l’oage’s political philosophym
formed in. his boyhood on the Lazy
Eleven ranch of his cattleman father
and preached from his pulpit as chair-
man of the House Agricultural Commits
tee-has had little regard for the wel-
fare poor and almost none at all. for the
environmental movement.

His Stone Age image is of his own
making. He asked in food-stamp hear-
ings in 1969 why we should be “so con~
corned with maintaining a bunch of
drones. You know what happens in the
beehive? They kill those drones. That is
what happens in most primitive socie-
ties. Maybe we have just gotten too far
away from the situation of primitive
man.”

As cave-dwellers welcome Poage
back to their midst—he is retiring and
spent his final day in Congress last
week—it ought to be noted that be is
owed one large debt' by many ,of the

same liberals who once fought him so
bitterly. No one in Congress has done
more for the cause of humane killing 0f
animals in the nation’s packing houses.

He picked up the issue in 1956 when
he took his subcommittee to the Chi-
cago stockyards during a lull in the
Democratic convention. The gore and
mayhem of cattle being killed by
sledgehammers to the head—Some-
times the workers would miss and only
knock out an eye—~was enough to get
the group behind Poage’s bill. for hu-
mane methods of killing. Two years
later, it became law. .

The powerful and bullish meat in‘
dustry was defeated. Not only were no
back-home votes to be won by Poage on
this issue, but perhaps a lot could be
lost: He formed an alliance with many
of the humane groups with liberal
memberships that backed other social
reforms held in contempt in west;
Texas. ,

Although Poage’s work on behalf of
animals in the slaughterhouses has
never been a major national issue, it is
instructive as a political lesson never-
theless. It underscores, first, the odd
shapings that political alliances some-
times take and, second, that the dark

clouds of the most reactionary mind
sometimes part-to reveal the brightest
of suns. ~

As with other aging armadillos in the
Texas delegation who are retiring from
the House this year-—George Mahon,
with 43 years in Congress; Olin E.
(Tiger) Teague, 33 years; Omar Burle-
son, 32 years—~Poage was part of the

~ southern rural coalition that long con-

trolled Congress. From safe oneparty
districts, it used seniority as a lasso to
hold: back any stampedes for reform.
Liberals like John Gardner of Common
Cause regularly called for Poage’s de—
feat—as one who “promotes the inter-
ests of influential farmers and blocks
legislation to feed hungry Americans.”
But Poage endured.

To praise him now is not to forget or
condone the grave suffering his philos-
ophy caused among the poor. It is to
recognize instead that in politics, as in
life, no one is all bad and no one all
good. That would appear to be an obvi-
ous enough truth, except that those
who align themselves with the so-called
“good issues”—-whether food stamps or
clean air—occasionally disdain any as-

“ sociation with the Poages. The disdain-

ing can be costly.

In his Office the other morning,
Poage was much the same bronco of a
man with the throaty voice who fumed
against the drones 10 years ago. But
he recalled with affection his endur-
ing friendship with Christine Stevens,
one of the country’s most persistent
animal-rights advocates. For more than.
two decades, they have been an un-
likely team: she a celebrated Washing-
ton party-giver and a champion of wild-
life and he a down-home porch—sitter
and a champion of agribusiness. When
asked about her friend, Stevens says
that Poage will always deserve the
Albert Schweitzer medal he won in
1961 from the Animal Welfare Insti-
tute.

As the Schweitzer laureate rides into
the west Texas sunset, he is proud of
pushing a bill this last session that will
advance ‘a remaining 1 percent of
America’s slaughterhouses into compli-
ance. With Poage’s work 99 percent
complete, it is fitting that the new bill
was sponsored by Rep. George Brown.
He is a liberal California Democrat who
is on the opposite side of Poage 99 per-
cent of the time. But that’s the beauty
of two opposites seeing eye to eye; a
strong vision is possible.

Dear Mrs. Stevens:

Your very kind Letter of December 28th, l977 telling me
that I have been selected to receive the Albert Schweitzer
Medal from the Animal Welfare Institute has just been conveyed

' to me from Our JAWS office.

At the moment I am sompletely overwhelmed by this bery
great honour bestowed upon me, but am made to realize at the
same time that thiswonderful recognition happened not only to
me but to all of us here--- the endless efforts of the JAWS
Board, here and in Londondnn, and the public who generously
help our cause when asked.

If by receiving this AWARD I am able to tell the people
of Japan the work of JAWS 1 am most happy. Also, I thank
Miss Ann Ross who came here from England and taught me to
love and care for the laboratory animals.

I thank you and the Board of Directors of the Animal
Welfare Institute for this honour from the bottom of my heart.

Yours sincerely,

//& 1/60 /}”’/LLE&

Dear Avice,

I'm sending this to Baltimore in the hope it will be forwarded to you
in Florida because I certainly hope you are missing our current weather.
The snow has been both beautiful and extremely inconvenient, and
Baltimore suffered much.more than Washington.

Thank you for your contribution and your kind words. It means a great
deal to me to receive support for the Animal Welfare Institute from
friends and relatives.

Thanks, also, for your suggestion about Larry Foster and Valerie Cross.
I shall make it available to the board when selection time rolls around
again. This year, we are presenting the Schweitzer Medal to a Japanese
woman who has devoted herself to the care of dogs at the University of
Tokyo Medical School Laboratories. I, myself, like the idea of a modest
individual receiving recognition. She does a wonderful job with, cer-
tainly, little material recompense.

With best wishes from.both Roger and me.

Sincerely,

Christine Stevens,
President

Deer Chije,

\ Thanks for your good letter. I hope youire now entirely recovered.
A very nice letter from Miss Mute followed a day after yours, and we

are sending the medal and check to Mike Hensfield so they will be ready
for presentation just as soon as JA¥S decides upon the date in consul~
tetion with the Ambassador.

If you are able to make a recording of the occasion, I know it
would be of much interest to AMI members. I know you will take pic-
tures of the ceremony so that others can enjoy it at a distance.

Please let me know if there is anything you went me to do from
this end. I hope that many other dogs will benefit from attention
focussed on the work of JAMS epitomized in Miss Nutois devotion to the
dogs of Todei who, despote their sufferings are not cowed and cringing
but know that they are loved and valued. That is the message that
needs so badly to be understood.

Kindest regards,
Yours,

Christine Stevens
President

His Excellency

Mike Hansfield

The Ambassador of the United States
American Embassy

APO San Francisco 96503

Dear Mike,

Everyone is looking forward to your presenting the ﬁlbert
Schweitzer Medal to Miss Yoko Mute from whom we have received an
enthusiastic letter of acceptance. It is wonderful of you to do
this. It will mean so much for the animals, and so much to the
Japan Animal welfare Society.

The medal is being engraved and should he completed before
this ietter reaches you. 'We'will consult with the State Department
concerning sending it to you by the most safe and expeditious means.
I am.enclosing checks made over to Miss Mute for the $1,000 award
from the Animal welfare Institute for yohuto present to her when
you hand her the medal.

Perhaps Chije Hechisuka has spoken with you and Maureen about
the ceremony. I hope it will get the attention of the press and
media. I am writing to'Mr. Usui of the Associated Press whom I met
in connection with the International whaling Commission.

Enclosed is some background on Miss Mute, but, of course it
does not tell about all that she has done for the poor suffering
dogs to nurse them through the post Operative period at eXperimental
surgery 9 which, as you know, is sometimes drastic. Her devotion to
them gives them heart, as does the soup she keeps boiling for them
and brings to them warm on the pellets where they lie.

These dogs are not caged as so many laboratory dogs are. They
are treated with kindness and respect and the appreciation they feel

 




 

is written on their faces and the soft expressions with which they
regard Miss MUto.

There are plans to film the dogs in the recovery area with
Miss Mute, and I hope you will allow an informal film.to be made
of the presentation of the medal, too, so that it could be sent
here and seen by members of the Animal Welfare Institute - but
this would be done only if it does not inconvenience you in any way.

Enclosed is a list of Schweitzer medalists and peOple who made
presentations. we are very proud that you have agreed to do this,
and very grateful. Please let me know if there is anything I have
failed to mention that you would like to know.

warmest regards to you and Maureen,

Sincerely,

Christine Stevens
President

Entrance gate of the University of Tokyo, where Yoko works with her

asSistants. She has been working at the place for nearly 8 years,
as animal technician.

She looks after some 80 dogs regularly, which are used for surgical
experiments. DOgs are brought in to the quarantine kennel from
Tokyo Municipal Pounds once a week.

She works in post—operative area in order to provide sufficient and
kind post-operative care.

Usually about 20 dogs are kept under her care.

She also helps the doctors on their daily testings or examinations.

Post-operative food is cooked by her, and she feeds them with
special diet twice a day.

Yoko makes confortable beds for post-operative dogs and changes
blanket every day. It is tough work to wash and dry the soiled
blanket in the cold. i

Dogs are brushed up by Yoko and she examines physical health of
dogs.
She sometimes give deworming pills and vaccination shot.

Yoko confirms with the doctor over the health of the dog in his
charge.

She and her assistants .give exercise to their dogs daily in the
university campus.

England,

Dear Mr. Browne,

We have offered the 1977 Albert Schweitzer Medal to Miss
Yoko Ento of Tokyo and have just received word that she
will accept it. I wanted you to have this glad news as soon
as possible because of the help you have given to the Japan
Animal welfare Society.

Miss Muto first came to our attention when I was in Tokyo
for the December meeting of the International Whaling
Commission and visited the offices of the Socieyy. She
cares for some of the animals at the University of Tokyo
laboratories, and it is touching and gratifying to see her
loving care and the warm, trusting response of her wards.
We have long wanted the Schweitzer Award to reflect the
very real good a dedicated individual can accomplish and
this work Miss Mnto is doing is a perfect example.

The presentation will be made in Tokyo by our Ambassador
Michael Mansfield at a modest ceremony in the Embassy. I
hope you'll join me in my pleasure at‘adding Miss Muto's
name to the list of humanitarians who have received the
Medal.

With my personal good wishes for the coming year.

Sincerely,

Christine Stevens,
President

Dear Senator Crenston,

Mike Mansfield presented the llbert Schweitzer Medal of the

The ﬁndel was awarded for Miss Kate's devoted care of thousands of

spoke in eew york to the annual iWI meeting.

We would be deeply honored and grateful if you would be willing
to speak this year. The meeting can be set at your convenience. any
time between May 15th and Jane 15th would be ideal.

Because you have taken a personal interest in the protection of
animals and have done so much in your quiet and effective way to help
them, the members and friends of an: would be thrilled to hear you.

I hope you will accept.

Sincerely,

Ladies and Gentlemen:

Some of you may know that a gold replica of the Albert
Schweitzer Medal of the Animal Welfare Institute was presented
to Dr. Schweitzer himself in Oslo, Norway in 1954. Since then,

annual award has gone to men and women who, because of

compassion for all the creatures of this earth, have made
utstand ing contribution to animal welfare. The recipients
Rachel Carson, the
pring and former United States Supreme Court
5. These are but a few of the names on a long

(-

hose who have worked ror the better treatment 0

animals. To this distinguished list, today, we add the name,

of Miss Yo} o Muto.

Miss Muto started to work for the Japan Animal Welfare

'iligently and unselfishly to her chosen field. She has been

Miss Muto th ought not hing of working on holidays and week

all she could to see that they were as comfortable as
possible. Of course, these are but a few of the reasons why

she was selected to receive this award. The many reasons can

Colman McCarthy

 

A Schweitzer Laureate Rides Into the Sunset

For much of his 43-year-tenure in
Congress, W. R. Poage, a west Texas
Democrat, has had the singular honor
of being a code word. Say Poage to
someone in the environmental move-
ment, 3 welfare-rights group or the
food-stamp lobby and your meaning is
known: regressive, close-minded, dolt-
ish. Poage’s political philosophy--
formed in his boyhood on the Lazy
Eleven ranch of his cattleman father
and preached from his pulpit as chair-
man of the House Agricultural Commit-
tee—has had little regard for the wel-
fare poor and almost none at all for the
environmental movement.

His Stone Age image is of his own
making. He asked in food-stamp hear-
ings in 1969 why we should be “so con-
cerned with maintaining a bunch of
drones. You know what happens in the
beehive? They kill those drones. That is
what happens in most primitive socie-
ties. Maybe we have just gotten too far
away from the situation of primitive
man.”

As cavedwellers Welcome Poage
back to their midst—he is retiring and
Spent his final day in Congress last
week—it ought to be noted that he is
ﬁrm! one large debt by many of the

same liberals who once fought him so
bitterly. No one in Congress has done
more for the cause of humane killing of
animals in the nation’s packing houses.

He picked up the issue in 1956 when
he took his subcommittee to the Chi-
cago stockyards during a lull in the
Democratic convention. The gore and
mayhem of cattle being killed by
sledgehammers to the headwsome—
times the workers would miss and only
knock out an eye—was enough to get
the group behind Poage’s bill for hu-
mane methods of killing. Two years
later, it became law.

The powerful and bullish meat in-
dustry was defeated. Not only were no
back-home votes to be won by Poage on
this issue, but perhaps a lot could be
lost: He formed an alliance with many
of the humane groups with liberal
memberships that backed other social
reforms held in contempt in. west
Texas.

Although Poage’ 5 work on behalf of
animals in the slaughterhouses has
never been a major national issue, it is
instructive as a political lesson never-
theless. It underscores, first, the odd
.shapings that political alliances some-

. times take and, second. that the dark

clouds of the most reactionary mind
sometimes part-to reveal the brightest
of suns.

As with other aging armadilios in the
Texas delegation who are retiring from
the House this year-George Mahon,
with 43, years in Congress; Olin E.
(Tiger) Teague, 33 years; Omar Burle»
son, 32 years—Poage was part of the
southern rural coalition that long con-
trolled Congress. From safe one-party
districts, it used seniority as a lasso to
hold back any stampedes for reform.
Liberals like John Gardner of Common
Cause regularly called for Poage’s de~
feat—as one who “promotes the inter-
ests of influential farmers and blocks
legislation to feed hungry Americans.”
But Poage endured.

To praise him now is not to forget or
condone the grave suffering his philos.
ophy caused among the poor. It is to
recognize instead that in politics, as in
life, no one is all bad and no one all
good. That would appear to be an obvi-
ous enough truth, except that those
who align themselves with the so—called
“good issues”—-—whether food stamps or
clean air—occasionally disdain any as-

~ sociation with the Poages. The disdain-

lng can be costly.

In his office the other morning,
Poage was much the same bronco of a
man with the throaty voice who fumed
against the drones 10 years ago. But.
he recalled with affection his endure
ing friendship with Christine Stevens,
one of the country’s most persistent
animal~rights advocates. For more than
two decades, they have been an uno
likely team: she a celebrated Washing»
ton party-giver and a champion of wild-
life and he a down-home porch-sitter
and a champion of agribusiness. When
asked about her friend, Stevens says
that Poage will always deserve the
Albert Schweitzer medal he won in
1961 from the Animal Welfare Insti-
tute.

As the Schweitzer laureate rides into
the west Texas sunset, he is proud of
pushing a bill this last session that will
advance a remaining 1 percent of
America’s slaughterhouses into compli-
ance. With Poage’s work 99 percent
complete, it is fitting that the new bill
was sponsored by Rep. George Brown.
He is a liberal California Democrat who
is on the opposite side of Poage 99 per-
cent of the time. But that’s the beauty
of two opposites seeing eye to eye: a
strong vision is; possible.

SCHWEITZER MEDAL TO JAPANESE WOMAN

Tokyo, April 5 —- Miss Yoko Muto, who works with the Japan Animal Welfare

Society (JAWS), was awarded the prestigeous Schweitzer Medal at the U.S.
Embassy yesterday evening. The presentation was made by U.S. Ambassador

to Japan, Mike Mansfield, before a group of invited guests.

The medal, and a cash prize of $1, 000 is awarded annually by the Animal
‘Welfare Institute, headquartered in Washington, D. C.

Previous Schweitzer medalists have included such well—known personalities

as U.S. Sen. HUbert Humphrey, chief sponsor of the Federal Humane Slaughter
Act, Rachel Carson, author of "Silent Spring", U.S. Senators Magnuson and _
Monroney, Sponsors of the Laboratory Animal Welfare Act, and.President Daniel
Oduber of Costa Rica, who created parks in.his country where wildlife can

flourish.

Miss Muto works with her assistants, at the Medical Department of Tokyo

University in the facilities where animals for test use are kept.

She looks after an average of 80 dogs regularly in the post—operative area,
and provides post—operative care. Muto—san cooks their food.and feeds them

their Special diets. She also makes the animals comfortable and changes

their blankets daily.

The young Japanese woman also aSsists the doctors with daily testings or.
examinations, and occasionally administers de—worming pills and vaccination

_shots.

Miss Muto was chosen for the Schweitzer honor as the result of a visit to
Japan, last year, by Mrs. Christine Stevens, president of the Animal Welfare
Institute. The American woman was greatly impressed by the gentle, but
determined, care Miss Muto gave the animals in her charge, and recommended

she be chosen for the award.

Miss Muto considers it a heart—breaking job to choose from among her charges
those to be used in laboratory tests, because 10 or more are killed every

week. It is her love for the animals which keeps her working.

JAWS:

Yoko Mute awarded U.S. Albert Schweitzer medal

By Kathy O’Brien

The Japan Animal Welfare
Society, a well-known watch-
dog for man’s best friend, en-
tered the international limelight
this week. One of its staff
members, Yoko Muto, received
the Schweitzer Medal from the
U.S. Animal Welfare Institute
for the doses of TLC she
administers to animals used in
research.

In ceremonies at the Amer-
ican Embassy Apr. 4, U.S.
Ambassador to Japan Mike
Mansfield bestowed the medal
on Miss Muto, along with
$1,000 in prize money. The
award has been presented an-
nually since 1955, commemo—
rating the year Dr. Albert
Schweitzer received the Nobel
Peace Prize,

An animal technician at
Tokyo University’s Medical
Department, Miss Muto joins
a selected breed of notables
tapped for the honor through
the years. Among them:
authoress Rachel Carson (Silent
Spring); the late Sen. Hubert
H. Humphrey, who introduced
the first humane slaughter bill
in Congress; Dr. Lee Talbot,
who successfully fought against
cruel poisons spread on federal
lands and sought a moratorium
on commercial whaling; and
Associate Justice of the Su-
preme Court Abe Fortas, pro-
ponent of legislation on the

humane treatment of research
an1mals.

“But the award does not be-
long solely to our organiza-
tion,” said Chiye Hachisuka,
who’s been working for JAWS
upwards of 12 years. “We
want to share it with the pub--
lic, whose support has given
us the impetus to carry out our
work.”

The society—whose familiar
acronym, JAWS, belies its
dogged compassion—performs
a menagerie of services for
furry and feathered friends
alike. Respect for all crea-
tures, great and small, under—
lies all its efforts, for instance,
to correct negligent, abusive
treatment of animals in labora-
tories, pounds, slaughterhouses
and the like.

Educating the public is an-
other of its “pet projects.” This
is one reason it offers a junior
membership, at a discount, to
young animal lovers. Learning
to care properly for a pet and
treating it with reSpect must
begin in childhood, JAWS
staffers believe.

A further aim is to enlighten
the public on how pervasively
animals have sacrificed their
lives for the sake of man’s
creature comforts.

.“That tube of lipstick a

woman buys—it might have
required killing hundreds of
laboratory mice before the right
shade was achieved,” Mrs.
Hachisuka said. “Or the medi-
cine we take—for that we owe
a debt of gratitude to untold
numbers of dogs. Or brain
research—otherwsie impossible
without killing monkeys. The
point is, research animals make
the supreme sacrifice for us.
We should offer them at least
humane treatment in their
laboratory environment.’

To intervene for animal wel—
fare in the lab and elsewhere
takes money, of course. Year
round, JAWS solicits funds and
new members (currently, they
number about 1,200- in the
Tokyo area chapter). Member-
ship has proved invaluable to
pet owners,

The toll of lost dogs in
Japan is a major problem, com—
pounded by the difficulty of
tracking down owners between
wards and even prefectures.
JAWS’ members are given tags,
written in English and J apan-
ese, to be worn on their dog.
If Fido gets lost, the police,
upon seeing the tag, will notify
JAWS and speed the pet’s
return.

Twice a year JAWS gears up
for two major fund-raisers, the
Black & White Ball in January
and Bingo Evening, planned

PITIFU L DERELICT DOGS await their fate on the labo- ‘
ratory tables at one of the animal hospitals in Tokyo. Yoko
Muto’s work in bettering conditions for the abandoned dogs
in the necessary lab work has earned her the United States’

Albert Schweitzer medal.

this season for Apr. 21 in the
Hotel New Otani. Tickets are
¥3,000 apiece for the evening’s
door prizes, donated by several
airlines, jewelers and cosmetic
and electronics firms, Even if
you can’t clear your calendar
Apr. 21 at 6 p.m., you can
buy a chance on a door prize.

One further note: JAWS
needs ample supplies of bedding

to use in animal research hos-
pitals. Anyone who has cast-
off towels, mattress pads or
blankets is asked to notify
JAWS. The phone number is
405-5681, and its new address,
having lately moved from the
Masonic Bldg, is 5,Kanizawa
Bldg, 3-1-38 Moto-Azabu,
Minato-ku, Tokyo 106,, '

Your support may just
prompt a lot of tail wagging.

COSTA RICAN PARKS HAILED BY CONSERVATIONISTS

Daniel Oduber Quiros, Costa Rica's environmentalist President,-
is in Washington today to receive the Albert Schweitzer Award in re-
cognition of his dedication in pushing through the most ambitious
wilderness preservation program in modern times.

This is the first time the award, given annually by the Animal
Welfare Institute of Washington, DC, has been given to a foreign
head of state. ‘

Since taking office in May 1974, President Oduber has taken a
fledgling National Park Service and spearheaded a comprehensive park
development program which now protects large tracts of Costa Rica's
highly varied and biologically rich habitats. From tundra-like
landscapes atop some of the country's highest volcanic peaks to
coastal mangrove swamps, more than 300,000 acres of pristine wilder—
ness have now been brought under protection.

Scientists and naturalists from North America and EurOpe have
been lured to Costa Rica for decades, drawn to this small, democratic
Republic whose natural wonders, unlike those of its neighbors, remain
largely unspoiled. During the past few years, there has been increased
incentive to deVelop this land, and virgin tropical forest has been
cleared at an alarming rate -- more than 100,000 acres annually. Mr.
Oduber's efforts to preserve representative types of Costa Rica's
wild lands has spurred the hopes of conservationists everywhere.

The forests of the American tropics have long been recognized as
the biologically richest habitat on earth -- areas which foster the
largest variety of plant and animal species. The birth rates through-
out Latin America, among the highest anywhere, rapacious development
of natural resources andotle‘ economic factors have threatened to destroy,
in a very short space of time, this important ecosystem. Now, in Costa
Rica, and also in countries like Peru, Ecuador, Argentina, Surinam and
Paraguay, there are serious efforts underway to plan the long-term use
of their wilderness resources. This includes setting areas aside to
be kept in a natural state, and plans for a tourist industry in associa-
tion with those areas.

Recognizing the importance of saving rain forest and other endangered
habitats in Costa Rica, the international conservation community was
quick to rush to the aid of the Costa Rican government in meeting the
largesﬂzrt-up costs associated with new national parks. The World

 




Wildlife Fund, The Nature Conservancy, the New York Zoological Society
and the Rare Animal Relief Effort (RARE) have cooperated in raising
more than $200,000 to date to aid these parks. The Costa Rican govern-
ment has committed several million dollars to this program.

President Oduber has stated that he wants Costa Rica to become
known as "the garden of Latin America”, a place where both Costa Rican
citizens and visitors from abroad can enjoy a unique and meaningful
experience. i '

The Schweitzer Award is given specifically for outstanding personal
contribution to the welfare of animals. Since Costa Rica's parks now
give refuge to a host of rare and threatened animals, it is most fitting
for President Oduber to be this year's recipient. The recently estab-
lished Corcovado National Park, for example, is home for Jaguars, Tapirs,
Giant Anteaters and other endangered mammals. Among the birds, the giant
Harpy Eagle, largest and most powerful bird of prey in the world, survives
here, living off a plentiful supply of monkeys, its principal prey.

Tortuguero National Park, on the Caribbean coast, contains the
largest Atlantic Green Turtle colony in the Caribbean, and has breeding
populations of manatees and the highly endangered American Crocodile.

Each of the twelve existing parks containsa unique assemblage of plants
and animals; each has its own special beauty and charm.

It will be years before the world can fully comprehend or appreciate
the importance of Daniel Oduber's forward and courageous program. His is
a contribution that will benefit all mankind. It is hoped that this
award will help to signal similar action elsewhere in Latin America.

Office Building, lst and Constitution N.E.

Sen. Hubert Humphrey, the Schweitzer Medalist in 1958, will
make the presentation to President Oduber, who is travelling
from Costa Rica expressly to receive the award. It will be an
unofficial visit by the Costa Rican head of state.

The Schweitzer medal is awarded annually by the Animal
Welfare Institute of Washington, D.C., to humanitarians making
significant contributions to the protection and welfare of
animal life.

Oduber (pronounced OhdooBAIR) is receiving the award in
recognition of his success in creating a 300,000-acre network
of 12 national parks in the tropical forests and coastal areas
of his Central American nation. Hundreds of rare mammal and
bird species are now protected within the parks. It is recognized
as the most ambitious park develOpment program in the world.

The Costa Rican president has worked closely with international
conservation organizations such as the New York Zoological Society,
The Nature Conservancy, World Wildlife Fund and Rare Animal Relief
Effort to create and Operate two major parks in the fragile coastal
forests: Corcovado National Park, an 86,000-acre preserve of
near-virgin forest on the isolated Osa Peninsula on the Pacific
Coast; and Tortuguero National Park, a 52,000-acre lowland rain

forest on the Caribbean Coast.

The preservation of this unspoiled habitat will ensure the

survival of threatened species such as jaguar, scarlet macaw, ( >

States Mrs. Christine Stevens, president of Animal Welfare
Institute: "The world must have many more foresighted leaders
like President Oduber if the magnificent diversity of wildlife

is to survive. The destruction of their vital habitat continues

at an alarming rate."

The Schweitzer Medal was first awarded in 1954 to Dr. Albert
Schweitzer himself. Authorizing the annual award in his name,
Schweitzer commented:

"I should never have thought that my phiIOSOphy
which embodies a compassionate attitude toward
all creatures would be noticed and recognized
during my lifetime. I knew this truth would
impose itself one day on thought, but it is the
great and moving surprise of my life that I
should be witness to the progress of ethics.
Your medal celebrates this progress."

Past Schweitzer Medallists include Rachel Carson, Russell
Train, Sen. Warren Magnuson, Reps. Tom Foley and W.R. Poage,
and Justice Abe Fortas.

Oduber, 55, was elected president of Costa Rica in 1974.

He has also served as Costa Rica's ambassador to the United Nations
and as European Ambassador-at-Large.

In 1948 Oduber helped found the Social Democratic Party,
forerunner of the present National Liberation Party. After the
1948 revolution, he helped establish the present democratic form
of government in the small nation of 2 million population. He
describes his political philosophy as social democracy, and
maintains close personal ties with Western European social
domocrats such as Helmut Schmidt, Willy Brandt, Mario Soares,
Harold Wilson and Olaf Palme.

As Foreign Minister from 1962 to 1966, Oduber strongly
supported the U.S.-sponsored Alliance for Progress and developed
a close relationship with President Kennedy. In recent years the
Oduber government has cooperated with the U.S. in international forums.

When Oduber was doing graduate work at the Sorbonne in 1949, he
met and married Marjorie Elliot, the daughter of a Canadian diplomat.

They have a 13-year-old son.

In 1972, she took animal technician correspondence
course and passed examination and awarded with d:

Muto, living in Tokyo’s
Setagaya Ward, was quite sur-

prised by the totally unexpect-

ed news of the awarding, and

is a little embarrassed. because

of the sudden recognition. ,
Her choice for the award
came quite accidentally as a

result of a visit to Japan late .

lastyear by Mme. C. Stevens,
chairwoman of the. American
animal organization, to protest
Japan’s killing ofwhales.

During her stay here, she
visited the research facilities at
Tokyo University’s Medical
Department,

kept. '
She was deeply moved by
seeing Mutos warmvhearted
consideration to. the animals
under her care. The quarters
were kept clean and sanitary,

all of the animals vigorously

The decision of picking her

Bowling booming dgain

Another bowling boom is

fiVe-year slump.

In the Kinki areas alone,
the -number of those who
bowled during the first eight
days of January (increased by
50 percent over the corres—

.ponding period of last year,
accounting for almost 80 per--

cent of the average figure set
in 1971 when the boom was
at its prime.

The return of the bowling
boom, according to a Spokes-
man of the Kansai Associa-

tion of . Bowling Centers, is ,
due largely to the less expen-
sive ‘charges which have re-
mained "ichanged during the
period. (¥250-¥300 per game)
and an increase in the num—
ber of .“newcomers” who have
not bowled before. ,

The Japan Animal Welfare
Society, a well-known watch-
dog for man’s best friend, en-
tered the international limelight
this week. One of its staff
members, Yoko Muto, received
the Schweitzer Medal from the
US. Animal Welfare Institute
for the doses of TLC she
administers to animals used in
research.

In ceremonies at the Amer-
ican Embassy Apr. 4, U.S.
Ambassador to Japan Mike
Mansfield bestowed the medal
on Miss Muto, along with
$1,000 in prize money. The
award has been presented an-
nually since 1955, commemo-
rating the year Dr. Albert
Schweitzer received the Nobel
Peace Prize,

An animal technician at
Tokyo University’s Medical
Department, Miss Muto joins
a selected breed of notables
tapped for the honor through
the years. Among them:
authoress Rachel Carson (Silent
Spring); the late Sen. Hubert
H. Humphrey, who introduced
the first humane slaughter bill
in Congress; Dr. Lee Talbot,
who successfully fought against
cruel poisons spread on federal

lands and sought a moratorium'

on commercial whaling; and
‘Associate Justice of the Sn-
preme Court Abe Fortas, pro~
ponent of legislation on the

humane treatment of research
animals. .

“But the award does not be-
long solely to our organiza-
tion,” said Chiye Hachisuka,
who’s beenworking for JAWS
upwards of 12 years. “We
want to share it with the pub-
lic, whose support has given
us the impetus to carry out our
work.”

The society—whose familiar
acronym, JAWS, belies its
dogged compassion—performs
a menagerie of services for
furry and feathered friends
alike. Respect for all crea-
tures, great and small, under-
lies all its efforts, for instance,
to correct negligent, abusive
treatment of animals in labora-

.tories, pounds, slaughterhouses

and the like.

Educating the public is an-
other of its “pet projects.” This
is one reason it offers a junior
membership, at a discount, to
young animal lovers. Learning
to care prOperly for a pet and
treating it with respect must
begin in childhood, JAWS
staffers believe. ‘

A further aim is to enlighten
the public on how pervasively
animals have sacrificed their
lives for the sake of man’s
creature comforts.

“That tube of lipstick a

woman buys—it might have
required killing hundreds of
laboratory mice before the right
shade was achieved,” Mrs.
Hachisuka said. “Or the medi-
cine we take—for that we owe
a debt of gratitude to untold
numbers of dogs. Or brain
research—otherwsie impossible
without killing monkeys. The
point is, research animals make
the supreme sacrifice for us.
We should offer them at least
humane treatment in their
laboratory environment.’

To intervene for animal wel-
fare in the lab and elsewhere
takes money, of course. Year
round, JAWS solicits funds and
new members (currently, they
number about 1,200 in the
Tokyo area chapter). Member-
ship has proved invaluable to
pet owners.

p

The toll of lost dogs in
Japan is a major problem, com-
pounded by the difficulty of
tracking down owners between
wards and even prefectures.
JAWS’ members are given tags,
written in English and Japan-
ese, to be worn on their dog.
If Fido gets lost, the police,
upon seeing the tag, will notify
JAWS and speed the pet’s
return.

Twice a year JAWS gears up
for two major fundraisers, the
Black & White Ball in January
and Bingo Evening, planned
