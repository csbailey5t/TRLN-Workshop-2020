REQUIEM

Fly high, little hawk

Man is here

Here with his limesticks and guns
Your songs of joy mean nothing to him
Fly to the stars and do not return

Swim deep, little seal

Man is here

Here with his nets and his clubs

Your ballet of grace means nothing to him
Dive to the sunless sea and do not return

Run fast, little wolf

Man is here

Here with his poisons and traps

Your bright-eyed children mean nothing to him
Run to the tundra's end and do not return

Hide, hide for ever

Your sweet and fierce splendour

Man has no place for love

Your Mystery means nothing to him
Leave him alone, alone with his kind
Unknowing, unloving, unloved

Pulse soft, littée earth

Man is here

Here with his concrete and bombs

Your hymn of life means nothing to him

Free your soul and to dust and ashes return

Mary de La valette

 




OTHER NATIONS:

The Indians were right, were wiser;
How can we own the land

Parcel it off and sell it 7

This land that gave us birth;

This earth, our mother

The animals, our brethernl

Out of the womb of earth

We are all one

‘United in Gaia, ,

The hunter; the hunted

The killer, the victim

The lover and the loved

The weaver and the web;

We alone have the choice
Life givers or death dealers;

Mary de La Valette
Spring '87

 




MUSTANG:

Wild horses.

Flowing manes

Exuberant screaming
Thundering over the plains _
In an ecstacy of freedom.

Pale, blond palominos

Midnight black steeds

Appaloosas and blue roans
Medicine Hat stallions

Wild; free spirits of the plains
Sired by Pegasus

Soul of the earth

Beauty incarnate;

Tossing manes and stamping feet
Blaring nostrils; glowing eyes
Never was gypsy more passionate
Aristocrat more noble;

The Wild Ones;

Essence of earth

Truth incarnate;

What have we done to them ?
Aerial capture and bloodied hoofs
Bursting lungs and shot-out eyes
Broken legs and broken spirits
Humiliation in death corrals
Lassoes and auctions

Rendering plants and pet food;
Essence of death

Evil incarnate;

Let there be no more joy

No more laughter:

Let there be weeping throughout the land
Weeping and understanding and.rage;

And retribution for their death; _
Mary de La Valette -'87

 




SANCTUARY}

I would like to burrow under Earth's soft skin
And make myself a home

In that other world

Beneath my feet .

A labyrinth of homes and tunnels

A softer, wiser, innocent world ‘
where Earth’s best children live,
Sheltered by their mother, Earth
From summer heat and winter freeze
She keeps them safe.

In her soft body, they give birth

In chambers lined with down and grass
Close to her heart;

I have no love for

Our giant erections of glass and steel
That claim dominion '
Straddling Earth's body

Spurning her love

Precocious children, we,
Delinquent in love

Devoid of compassion.

And yet, in death we return

As if in some unknown last rite
We make amends.

Like prodigal sons

We come home;

ROAD KILL:

Your blood is as red as mine

Your hands delicate miniatures of mine
Clutched as if in prayer

For the babies you have left perhaps.

Tail waving forlornly in the wind

Of another car passing

Those eyes still bright

But unseeing now _

The Spirit gone from your still warm body
To roam the Universe

Perhaps in freedom,

Perhaps in grief,

b at beauty of grass and shadows
Did your brief life know

What soft days and mellow nights
6f stars and starflowers

When your life was joy and harmony
And you were so busy living.

Who hit you and did not care to stOp ?

Who placed no value on the magic of your life
I can't forget your hands

So frail and infinitely perfect

Comparing mine so clumsy

As I pick you up

With rage and tears and pain

And give you the reSpect

Of a burial.

Mary de La Valette @

IKOYAANASQUATSI:

Big, black crow

You fly from me

Raucously warning of danger.
How can I tell you

I would never do you harm ?

I have only love

And gentleness for you

And anguish for our betrayal
Of a bond that once was;

or a golden age ‘ '

When you might have brushed me
With your wing

And.shared.my bread.

All creatures flee from us.
We are death and destruction
We are fear and terror.

I feel the guilt

Heavy as the cross

Of one who bore it

To Golgotha.

To A Fur Scarf

by F.F. Van der Water

The steel jaws clamped and held him fast,
None marked his fright, none heard his cries.
His struggles ceased; he lay at last
With wide, uncomprehending eyes,
And watched the sky grown dark above
And watched the sunset turn to grey,
And quaked in anguish while he strove
To gnaw the prisoned leg away.
Then day came rosy from the east,
But still the steel jaws kept their hold,
And no one watched the prisoned beast,
But fear and hunger, thirst and cold.
Oppressed by pain his dread grew numb,
Fright no more stirred his flagging breath.
He longed in vain to see him come,
The cruel hunter, bringing death.
Then through the gloom that night came One
Who set the timid spirit free;
“I know thine anguish, little son;
So once men held and tortured Me.”

Inspired by and written for Koko

Of Love

You came to me last night in a moonbeam,
Although I could not see you in the usual way,
I knew you were there.

As yesterday, today or tomorrow, you will be
with me in so many ways — a droplet of
water,
a ray of sun, a whisper of the wind, the
green of grass, a leaf, a tree, a melody,
in the air I breathe.

Thank you for sharing my life.

You still make light the heavier times—
bringing a brightness to that which is dim.
Your spirit and warmth are forever.

I love you, my soulmate.
You always let me know what it is to be
appreciated — by being with me.

Dedicated to
“beloved creatures everywhere”

Tom has a great need to roam
In search of a mate in season.
If he’s neutered, there’s no reason
To leave the safety of his home.

Beast: and Bird:

 

THE EAGLE

He Clasps the crag with crooked hands;-
Close to the sun in lonely lands,
Ring’d with the azure world, he stands.

The wrinkled sea beneath him crawls;
He watches from his mountain walls,
And like a thunderbolt he falls .

LORD TENNYSON

THE SILVER SWAN

The silver swan, who living had no note,

When death approached, unlocked her silent throat,
Leaning her breast against the reedy shore,

Thus sung her ﬁrst and last, and sung no more:

Farewell all joys! 0 death, come close mine eyes;
More geese than swans now live, more fools than wise.
AN ON

How DOTH THE LITTLE CROCODILE

How doth the little crocodile
Improve his shining tail;

And pour the waters of the Nile
On every golden scale!

How cheerfully he seems to grin,
How neatly spreads his claws,
And welcomes little ﬁshes in,
With gently smiling jaws!

ARRANGEMENTS

We sleep together
two cats and two people fur
against our skins our skins

against their fur.

Our legs are all mixed up

and their tails are under our necks.

Sleeping and waking
waking and sleeping
we shift from one side

to the other.

Only when morning comes
do we find out
who has furry tails

who wears glasses.

THE BIGHORNS

Once,

climbing Mount Baldy
in August,

seven bighorn sheep
crossed our path.
Ghostly and grey.
they rose

out of steep scree
to stand, poised
on the faint line
that led

to the top

of the mountain.
Breathless and hot
in the thin air,
we were diminished
then opened

by what we saw.
Our hearts bolted
and froze

on our dry tongues
like talus,

while we stared,
mesmerized

by the hypnotic

(no stanza break)

 




yellow eyes

with their unflinching pupils;
the scrolled horns;

the silent hooves;

the apparently effortless

ascent .

It was a long moment
spilled like a lake

on that razorback saddle.
We looked into each other
and beyond, into the real

life of the mountain.

fhen the big male

dipped his horns

and the herd was gone,
absorbed like air

into the ridge line
as quietly

as they had come.

It could have
been a dream

but it wasn't.
And we continued
the last mile

to the bare peak

that rose, spreading
its granite skirt
like a mantle

of light

to the desert.

We arrived,

but to this day

it is the sighting
I remember .

When I feel

most far from you.
I remind myself
that you

were the one
standing beside me
that hot noon

looking straight

into wildness.

That there are
some mysteries
about which

it is impossible
to ever

completely speak.

When you reach the gates of Heaven, lease your
dog outside. Heaven goes by favor. If it went by
merit, you would stay out and the dog would go

in.
——Mark Twain

The child trained to deal with the animal world
about him, according to the teaching of the
Golden Rule, will grow into adulthood constantly
moved to apply this same law in determining his

relations to his human fellows.
——Eric H. Hansen

It's a concern that goes beyond economic value. People are asking-
a revolutionary question--Is man really meant to be dominant over all
earth's creatures?

An eloquent answer to that question is given by
biologist and author Victor Spheffer: "If you be-
lieve that human life has meaning or purpose or di-
rection or destiny, you will know in your heart_that
our life is bound all around and together and forever
with the lives of the animals who were present at.our creation. If we
survive, we will care for whales and the othertwild creatures, and if
we perish through our own cleverness, the end of the wild things will
have been an early warning of our folly." ‘

Snowstorm

By Paulus Utsi

Through the snowstorm

I saw reindeer grazing
The old dog saw them too
sent out his barking

Their antlers were like bushes
the forehorns like tree roots
When they sprang away

it was a birch grove

that vanished in the storm

The noise from their bells
the clatter of their hooves
shaken off by the wildness of the wind

—translated by Jean Pearson

Paulas Utsi was a traditional Saami poet of Swedish ”Lappland This poem is
from his collection, Giela Gielain (Trapping with Language), published in a
Saami/Swedish edition in 1980 after his death. In 1987, this translation appeared in
The Trumpeter, a Canadian eco-philosophy journal. —]ean Pearson

PAGﬂN:

ialk gently.

Walk in balance.

Walk as if you know

How sacred is this Earth.

Walk in wonder and in silence
Eor this is holy ground.

Walk in reverence and awe

For this is our beloved Earth.

VialL softly.

Touch Earth,

Gather strength.

Walk as an army of children
Shining in the sun

For this is our Mother

They have despoiled and raped.

Walk like a thousand trumpets
Like soaring eagles

Like the rising sun.

Walk in passion and truth

For we have come full circle
Mother, child.

Child, mother.

Heep if you must

But gird yourself for battle
For now we must bleed for her

cur beloved Earth.

BREAKDT G BARZZLIER S :

Topaz eyes lined with gold,
Fragile pink lace skin
Delicate throat

And pale, soft belly

The colour of Opals and pearls.
Little toad,

My jewelled Prince

Weleome to my garden.

You let me pick you up

Twice.

And sat with palpitating heart

In my hand.

I sense an ancient wisdom,

That you know all about

Biology classrooms and haute cuisine.
And yet you remained

Trembling and vulnerable.

They have always met us

Mere than.halfway,

Much more.

They know,

With a sense that we have lost,
A sense, truer by far

Than our language of lies,

That there are no barriers
Only those we have erected.

n Will we tear them down ?

End.Eiseley's long loneliness ?

Enter again into Eden 3

Earth's green skin is velvet today

With the mist on it.

Crushed velvet with her children's pawprints.

Some days it is silk

With young winds rippling.

Empty chat of jobs and soaps.
Like a dark cloud I watch
As we carelessly murder the earth

Paralysed, impotent

I give in to despair

And run away

For a morning with my dog
To young Spring grass

And washed brilliant skies
To forget.

How do you forget 5 million murdered kangaroos,
Frozen baboons, brain-mapped kittens ?

A carpet of acorns waiting to be born

The damp, clean smell of earth, a last patch of snow.
18 thousand wild mustangs rotting in Western ghettos
Cleanse me. Take my pain.

Agnus dei, qui tollis peccata mundi
Dona nobis pacem.

Leg of'lamb for Easter dinner
Bibles bound in skin.

Silver Spring monkeys. Do they still dream of freedom ?
Yearning for extinction, a cup of hemlock.

Their pain. My pain.

A bottomless vessel of pain.

That bird's song of joy breaks my heart.

Drowning, searching for a last thread of sanity.

Far off

Running in a straight line to me
Every line of his body
Rejoicing in being alive

HEAVY’HEART

I remember where the rabbits ran

Where muskrats chattered by the stream

Where a last red fox wandered slowly through the trees
It was last summer ‘

Now the bulldozers have been

Cleared the trees, moved the boulders

So many little lives carelessly snuffed out

Not a sound now; their joy and innocence lost forever
Buried under a ton of concrete

My little, last piece of woodland

Laid waste for a ShOpEing mall.

The lady slippers smashed with broken glass
A world.of broken glass

And drowned.heer cans and Marlboro stubs.

Dying forests in Germany

Dying lakes in.New Hampshire
.Dying’reindeer in.Lapland

Dying reefs in Hawaii

And laughed away

Was something more important.

It always escaped me.

Now, as a caterpillar emerges
Fragile and finally beautiful
The essence bared,
Fearless‘and‘strong,

I spread my wings

Alone and finally free.

So much to be done

So little time to do it.
