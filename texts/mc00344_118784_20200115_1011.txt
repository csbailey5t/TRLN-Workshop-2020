My dear Mrs. Stevens:

I am glad to have your letter of February 12 regarding S 533
that pertains to the humane treatment of animals used in research finan-
ced by Federal funds

Iet me take this opportunity to assure you that I share your
concern for the humane treatment of animals. I served as a sponsor of
WARDS, the Society for the Welfare of Animals used for Research in Drugs
and Surgery, and I have given my full support to providing more adequate
quarters for the animals used for testing by the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration. It is very gratifying to learn that the animals will move into
their new building later this year.

As you know, the Hbuse of Representatives last year initiated
consideration of legislation that would provide for the humane treatment
of research animals. I would urge that you keep in touch with.the appro—
priate members of the House concerning their further consideration of

, this legislation. Final action on the part of the House of Representa-

: tives would greatly favor consideration of the legislation in the Senate.
f The schedule of this Committee is extremely crowded since it has juris—
diction over many of the priority measures of the President's program.
You can be sure that I will keep your views in mind regarding S. 533 and
; I shall request the comments of the various interested agencies and de—

é partments.

With best wishes and kind personal regards, I am

Deer Mrs. Bemelmens:

Senator Goldwater's volume of mail has reached such enormous
proportions that we are just reaching those which bear the
date of your letter.

Although the Senator has tried to read and answer each letter
personally, his absence from.Washington to attend the Convention
in San Francisco has now made that impossible.L Hence, I am
acting as his deputy in replying, and he hopes that when time
permits, he‘ll have an opportunity to read your letter.

He asked.me to thank you in his behalf for having taken the
time and trouble to write to him.

Sincerely,

/”75ﬂ.;12.t..~éi, L757, 4533:...~4.»EZZZZ;

Ms. Madeleine Bemelmans, President

New York 22, New'York

Dear Ms. Bemelmans:

It was good of you to let me have your thinking
on legislation to provide for the humane treatment
of eXperimental animals.

You probably know that both the Senate and House
Committees on Appropriations last year recommended an
allowance of $1,750,000 for the construction of a
special laboratory facility for the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration's activities using dogs as a test medium.

It meant that these test animals, at least, will have
proper quarters and care, and I was glad the Congress sub-
sequently approved this recommendation.

Because of the high interest in the problem of
humane treatment of our experimental animals, I have been
studying this entire area and have consulted with repre-
sentatives of humane and other groups. I hope that the
Congress will be able to develOp reasonable and realistic
legislation in this field and you can be certain that if
such is forthcoming, it will receive my support.

Best regards.

Sincerely yours,

Many thanks for your letta*of June 10 concerning

would provide for the humane treatment of vertebrate animals.
used in experiments and tests for recipients of grants from
the U. 8. Government.

H. R. 5M3 and H. R. 10138 are both pending before
the House Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee. S. 533
is pending before the Senate Labor and Public Welfare Com—
mittee. No action has been scheduled on these bills to date.
However, I shall study the bills carefully if and when they
should appear before the Senate.

Dear Miss Bemelmans:

Thank you for your recent letter in strong support of
legislation to insure the humane treatment of animals used for
research purposes.

As one who is deeply interested in the humane treatment of
all our domestic animals, I am in sympathy with proposals which
are intended to insure that reasonable measures are adopted to
protect experimental animals from unnecessary harm and disccmfort.
It is in this light that I will consider any proposals for Cong-
ressional investigation and for corrective legislation.

Perhaps this year at least extensive hearings can be held,
at an early date, on the bills that have been introduced. This
could be an improvement over the last Congress, when no concrete
action was taken, and an intensive study could provide the impetus
needed to have a satisfactory preposal approved by this Congress.

Thank you again for taking the time to write to me. I
appreciate hearing your views on this question.

With all best wishes,

Sincerely yours,

Dear Friends:

Thank you for your letter of April 1 along with enclosures.
I have not had an Opportunity to study the specifics of the
humane treatment of experimental animals bill which was
introduced in the Senate by Senators Clark and Neuberger.
Regardless of the Specifics of the bill, however, I wish to

assure you that I am with you in principle on this matter.

Faithfully yours ,

Dear Mrs. Bemelmans:

Thank you for your letter of May 7 telling me of your
interest in S. 3088 and its companion bill, H. R. 1937, and the
attahhéd MarcheApril issue of the.Animal welfare InstituteS"Infor-
mation Report?

As you may know, I introduced a similar bill
in the Senate two years ago, in 1960, which I believe was
the first bill introduced in the Congress on this subject.
No hearings were scheduled by the Committee to which it
was referred, and the bill died with the expiration of the
86th Congress. Even so, the bill aroused wide interest
and, as a result, many labratories are making improvements
in the housing,care and treatment of research animals.

I am still interested in this matter, and will
follow the progress of all legislation before the Congress
on this subject.

With best wishes, I am

Dear Miss Bemelmans:

Thank you for your letter of February l2, with
enclosures, concerning S. 533, providing for humane
treatment of animals used in experiments and tests
in institutions using Federal funds. I appreciate
hearing from you. S. 533 is presently before the
Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare. In the
87th Congress, as I am sure you are aware, similar
legislation died with the adjournment of that Congress.

On May 18, 1959, I introduced a bill, which was
co—sponosred by twelve other Senators, proposing to
establish standards for the care and treatment of
animals in Federally—financed scientific research.

I did so because of my interest in the matter, and
because I felt it should be studied by the Senate Com—
mittee on Labor and Public Welfare. Upon introducing
the bill I made clear, as I think did all the

sponsors, that it was not intended to inhibit or dis—
courage scientific research in any way. The bill died
with the expiration of the 86th Congress. Even so, the
bill aroused wide interest and, as a result, many
laboratories are making improvements in the housing,
care and treatment of research animals.

I am still interested in this matter, and will follow
closely the progress of all legislation before the
Congress on this subject.

With kind regards, I am

Dear Miss Bemelmans:

I have received your letter of June 10th and the en~
closures, and I thank you for writing me.

I have checked with the Senate Committee on Labor and
Public Welfare regarding S. 533 and no hearings have'been
» scheduled for the near future. However, I will speak to Senator

Hill about the hill.

As you know, during recent years a number of bills have
been introduced in'both the Senate and the House of Representatives
regarding the treatment of animals used in Federally—financed scien»
ifﬁc research. In fact, I was a co-sponsor of such a'bill several
years ago. While none of them.has been passed'by either house, I
do believe they have aroused a greater interest in this subject and
many laboratories are now in the process of improving the housing
and care of these animals.

I appreciate your writing me about your interest in this

proposed legislation, and I assure you that when it comes to the
Senate for consideration I will give it careful study.

Dear Ms. Bemelmans:

Thank you for your June lOth letter and enclosure
thereto regarding legislation providing for the humane
treatment of animals used in medical research.

As you know, 8.533 has been referred to the Senate
Committee on Labor and Public Welfare. I have'been ad—
vised that requested reports from the Government depart-
ments concerned have not been received and therefore no
action has as yet been scheduled on the measure. The
House Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee has in-
dicated that the same situation applies to H.R.5M3O and
H.R. 10138.

I appreciate your thoughtfulness in calling to my
attention your views on this legislation, and you may
be sure that I will give careful and thoughtful consid-
eration to appropriate bills when they are brought to
the Senate Floor for action.

Dear Mis s Bemelmans:

Thank you for your letter urging my support of legislation govern—
ing the treatment of animals which are used for scientific experi-
mentation.

As you are probably aware, the Clark-Neuberger bill is presently
pending before the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare
and is awaiting further action.

As an honorary Vice President of the Massachusetts Society for

the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, I am interested in the humane
treatment of laboratory animals, but I would not want to impose

rigid research standards which would hinder vital scientific progress.
You may be sure that if this measure should come before the Senate
this session for consideration, I will study it carefully and keep your
views in mind.

Sincerely,

Dear Christine:

Thanks for your letter of February 12th and the enclosed reprints
including the New York Times editorial.

I would'be delighted to see early hearings scheduled.by the Senate
Labor and Public Welfare Committee and the issue brought to the Floor
for action. I very definitely feel that present conditions in the care
of experimental animals are unsatisfactory in a great many instances.
Humanitarian safeguards can and should be provided. At the same time,
I believe Congress should be careful that excessive restrictions are
not imposed on scientific research.

Best wishes.
Sincerely,

Dear Mrs. Bemelmans:

Thank you for your recent letter supporting
legislation to provide for more humane treatment
of animals used in laboratory experiments.

I fully support the objective of establishing
adequate standards to protect experimental animals
from needless suffering. There is evidence to suggest
that in some research pregrams adequate safeguards have
not been observed.

The Labor and Public Welfare Committee is confronted
with the difficult task of seeking a bill which would
maintain humane standards without inhibiting vital medical
and scientific research. YOur comments are relevant to
that task and I shall share them with my colleagues who
serve on that Committee.

Best wishes.

Sincerely,

Hubert H. Hamphrey

Your good letter of the 12th has just been received,

I am delighted to have the extracts which you sent,
along with your communication, relative to S. 533, and I want

to assure you I will do all I can in support of this measure
when it is reported to the Floor.

As far as advice and guidance are concerned, I would
be most happy to see you at any time, but I would suggest that
with Maurine Neuberger in there as one of the sponsors, she
might well be the spark which could ignite this fire. I under—
stand from Maureen that we will get together this coming week,
and at that time maybe we can discuss this more fully.

Dear Miss Bemelmans:

monk you for giving me the benefit of your cements
on legislation relating to the treatment of laboratory
animls, the subject of a number of bills in the
Senate and House of Representatives.

Senate bills 8. 533 the less comprehensive S. 10141
are still before the Senate Health Subcomittee. None
of the bills introduced in the House has yet come over
to the Senate.

While I am no longer a member of the Senate Health
Subcomittee, my loHstandi interest in the humane
treatment of animals has continued, together with a
keen appreciation of the benefits which all of us owe
to medical research. I will be greatly interested in
any recommendations which the Health Subcomittee may
mike on this matter, and I appreciate your getting in
touch with me about it .

Sincerely,

Dear Miss Bemelmans:

Thank you very much for writing me of your support for legisla-
tion to establish regulations and standards governing the use of
animals in Federally-sponsored research projects.

 

I wholeheartedly agree that our animals deserve the best care
and treatment and all possible protection from.pain and suffering.
As you may know, in the last Congress I cosponsored legislation simi-
lar to that currently under consideration.

I am.hopeful that hearings can be held to resolve objections
that have been raised, particularly with respect to administration
and enforcement, so exact provisions can'be drafted that are satis-
factory to all valid interests. Certainly no civilized.person could
object to the purposes of the legislation and I want to assure you
of my strongest support for any bill approved for Senate action.which
will accomplish the humanitarian objectives of this legislation.

With my best regards,

Sincerely,

Thanks very much for your letter and the

During the adjournment I went through the
hearings held late last session in the House, and I
thought your case for the bill was most effectively
presented. I have not had an Opportunity to study
the changes in the new bill which you mention, but I

am glad to know they may remove some of the objec~
tions to the measure.

I will certainly do whatever I can to fur—
ther action on S. 533, and when you plan to be in
Washington please let me know and we can try to work
out a mutually convenient time to discuss the bill.

With my best regards,

Sincerely,

Dear Miss Bemelmann:

Them: you for your letter regarding proposed legislation
aimed at protecting laboratory animals from cruel treat-
ment.

3. 553, a bill introduced by Semtor Clark, seems to be
a sound approach to the problem. The Senate Committee
on labor and Public Welfare (which has jurisdiction over
such legislation) will in due time hold public hearings,
soliciting the views and advice of interested parties.

It is my hope that legislation can be developed which
offers the desired protection without handicapping
scientists and researchers who must experiment in
order to save human life.

Sincerely yours ,

Dear Madeleine:

Thanks for your letter of May 7 and the enclosure outlining the
provisions contained in S. 3088. It is very helpful to have a
summary of the bill in this form.

You may be sure that I shall continue to support legislation
that will provide for humane treatment of animals used in
laboratories for experiments and tests. I feel strongly that the
Congress must take some action on this matter this year.

Dear Miss Eemelman;

It is most thoughtful of you to write to me expressing
your support for legislation which would require the humane
treatment of laboratory animals.

As you know, over the years since my election to the
Senate I have consistently supported legislation which would
accomplish this purpose.

I am hopeful that there will be hearings on S. 533 so
that we will have the opportunity to discuss this proposal on
the floor of the Senate.

Sincerely,

Deex'Miss Eemelmens:

It is good of you to let me know of your continued
support for legislation which would prohibit the inhumane
treatment of laboratory animals.

As of this writing these proposals here gone nowhere.
I very strongly feel that the Congress should give careful
consideration to legislation which would prohibit our animal
friends from suffering needlessly. You can certainly count
on my continued support for legislation which.will accomplish
this purpose.

Sincerely,
