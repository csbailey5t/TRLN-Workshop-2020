Dear Mr. Allen:
Thanks for your letter, I hope this one will reach you.

Them in so much taking place at present, and in many cases the

way in which it is presented will have such an important influ»

once on the outcome that I an anxious to discuss the possibility
of your writing on key subjects as they 315189.

A bill regulating importation of ivory into the United States
recently passed the House of Representatives and has gone to the
Senate, where there are plans for a piece of logiulation not yet
drafted but intended to provide fund: for international exchange
of wildlife workers».

Plans for an Iwc~aponsored meeting on cetacaan intelligence and
behavior and the ethics of. killing cetaceans are underway. and
it is expected that the meeting will be held the week beginning
April 28th in Washington. Writing on this subject is obviously
important.

Findings that the offshore spotted dolphins moat camonly set on
by tuna purse seiner: are depleted has created a crisis with
respect to the Marine Maxmnal Protection Act. However, this may
prove to be a blessing in disguise sinco it appears that research
to use the purse aeincs without setting on dolphins will at last

 




Mr. Patridk Allen ~2~ January-31.

attention and follawbup. ‘Ybu may have read Stephan Kellert’a
survey whidh shows that 69% of Amtricans would rather pay a
higher price for tuna fish than see the tuna industry continue
killing dolphins in their nets.

The Animal Welfare Institute is just completing a third revision
of Facts About Furs. and we have used a good deal of material
from the IUCN Bulletin. This neeas follawwup. too.

Please let m9 know your further plant and how you think we might

Reporter’s Notebook: 318t IWC Conference

by Gene Broa’ear

I arrived in London three days prior to
the start of the International Whaling
Commission Conference, to give my
body time to adjust to the eight hours
lost on the ﬂight from Los Angeles. Not
a bad idea, but it didn’t work.

What did recharge my ﬂagging spirits
was a Sunday rally at Trafalgar Square.
Ten thousand people jammed into the
relatively small space to set the theme for
“the year of the moratorium.” The
peripatetic John Perry could be seen
negotiating an impromptu appearance
of Flo (the ﬂying blue whale) with the
bobbies. The crowd got a brief glimpse
of Flo before the demonstration
peacefully wound down.

Perhaps the most dramatic moment
occurred Monday morning, when John
Denver showed up to sing for the whales.
It seemed that the delegates gathered in
the heavily guarded conference room at
the Cafe Royale would have placed
themselves in a more embarrassing posi-
tion, had they not allowed Denver to
sing. Up to the microphone he went, his
guitar slung over his shoulder. After an
explanation to IWC Chairman Thordor
Asgeirsson, Denver delivered the lyrics of
“I Want to Live” as I’ve never heard
them done before . . .

“Have you gazed out on the ocean

Seen the breaching of a whale. . .”
\W hen Denver ﬁnished, there «was a long
pause, then a polite—if not subdued—
round of applause. With this un-
precedented opening, the mood of the
3lst IWC conference was set.

Those of us expecting ﬁrst day action
on the major conservation proposals were
disappointed. The commission’s ap-
proach to the many issues to be dealt
with was painstakingly slow. By Wednes-
day, the momentum was increasing. The
United States call for an indeﬁnite
moratorium on all commercial whaling
was in trouble. Commissioner Richard
Frank found himself in the embarrassing
position of proposing the ban, while try-
ing to appease Eskimo interests with a
20-27 bowhead whale quota. Panama-
nian scientistJean Paul Fortom saved the
US. proposal by splitting the vote. A
moratorium on commerical factory ship

whaling passed: the call for a ban on
land-based operations went down to
defeat. The overwhelming vote in favor
of the call for a halt to factory ship whal-
ing was hailed as a major victory by con-
servationists. The fact that the win
meant the loss of an additional 8,000
minke whales didn’t get as much
publicity.

The Seychelles proposal to create a
whale sanctuary in the Indian Ocean
passed without much objection, but
their 3-year ban on sperm whaling was
doomed from the start. Despite an elo-
quent plea from Jean Paul Fortom for his
colleagues to consider the ethics of
slaughtering a mammal with six times
the gray matter that man possesses, the
measure failed. Jean Paul said the
cachalot [sperm wba/e] would someday
be called “people of the sea.”

By midweek, it was evident that more
and more issues were being discussed in
executive session. The closed door
meetings made it all but impossible to
determine who was pressuring whom
into voting for or against a proposal.

Journalists who had been relying on
non-governmental observers (ngo’s) to
provide them with background on key
votes, found themselves without a
reference. The press room was crowded
and humming with activity during the
ﬁrst three days of the conference. By
Thursday, it was all but deserted. The
daily update issued by the ngo’s con-
tained stories of harassment of creden-
tialed media personnel by security
guards. I had the phone yanked from my
hand while trying to feed a taped report
to my station in Los Angeles. Security ac-
cused me of “bugging the phone” when
in essence, I was sending tape of a story
not related to the conference. I had the
ground rules straight. It turned out that
they were confused.

Craig Van Note, who releasd a bril-
liant expose’ on pirate whaling, com-
plained bitterly about the commissions’
failure to respond to the issue. The ex-
ecutive vice-president of the Wash-
ington-based group, Monitor, told me
the item was shelved till 3:30 Saturday
morning. Van Note said members dealt

with the growing problem of outlaw
whaling, despite the fact that he’d
documented that most of the illicit
whale meat purchased, could be traced
to Taiyo Fisheries Company in Japan.
Van Note plans to make outlaw whaling
a key issue next year.

The low point of the conference came
late in the week, when the U.S.A.
rammed through its bowhead quota of
18 killed or 26 struck, whichever came
ﬁrst. The vote was in direct contradiction
to the scientiﬁc committee call for a zero
quota. Letters of protest from the
American Cetacean Society and several
other conservation groups were of no
avail.

On balance, though, the conservation
theme struck Monday by John Denver,
and enhanced by the partial victory on
the moratorium issue, left me with the
feeling that important precedents had
been established. The push must now
continue to build upon the foundation
of conservation.

Dear Mrs. Stephens:

Thank you for all of your materials which you so kindly sent
me for my recent article on Animals in Research. Needless
to say, your material was both most welcomed, useful and
extremely informative.

I especially appreciated Mr. Diner’s review of scientific
literature and I am interested to know if the preface by
Dr. Peacock is the same Dr. Peacock of "Poodle” fame.
As I am involved with the showing of dogs it is strictly
out of interest that I ask.

I am looking forward to receiving future publications from
your organization and, as soon as the magazine is off the
presses in November please rest assured that one will be
forwarded to you post haste.

Again, many thanks for your support. I remain,

Yours truly,

Dear Friends:

Dr. Andrew N. Rowan of the Institute for the Study of
Animal Problems suggested I write you for a copy of §/
the Diner report. I've enclosed a check for $4.00/Eg/,,r’
cover it. ,

I've also enclosed a review I had published in a Bay
Area women's movement newspaper. The review is of Hans
Ruesch's Slaughter of the Innocent, and although it was
unhappily edited, most of the message is intact.

 

My next project is a half—hour TV program exposing/opposing
animal experimentation. The program will be proposed to
KQED, San Francisco's Public Broadcasting System's station.

As of now, I believe the program should include interviews,
personal narratives, film clips, slides, whatever else is
appropriate and effective.

I'm in the first stage of the project: contacting interested
people via letters, posters, advertisements, announcements.
I've written many agencies also, and often one agency can
suggest another. -

on the entire medical industry, the drug industry, and the
big business that produces animals for the labs. That's a
big chunk of capitalism, and at times this seems frightening.
But it seems to me it is vital that people be informed of
the truth. And now that I know the truth I must try to
do something about it.

I am writing an article for Tnday's Animal Health magazine en the subject

of experimentation on laberatery animals. The practice of using animals

in research is a herrible concept, but ene that undeniably exists even ten

to give insight into this subject, but tn clarify any myths that might

prevale as to the actual cenditions under which the animals used-by scientists
live. '

 

My main concern is net only with the labnrateries themselves, but else

the animal dealerships and recnuperatien centers“ I wish te feces an all
aspects of the subject and perhaps even provide some sniutiens tn this
problemo

In this vein, 1 neuld appreciate it if yeu weuid previde me with any intern

Re: Advertising of Commemorative Stamps
by United States Postal Service

Dear Mr. Chairman:

My five years in the SEC (San Francisco office-—largely enforce-
ment), December '36 to February '42 (when I went into the Navy) gave me
a lifelong sensitivity to fraud, particularly subtle fraud. I enclose
a full page color ad from Life of April of this year. I noted a similar.
ad in another magazine but didn't tear it out. My daughter, who hears
more t.v. than I do, tells me that the same message is repeated widely
on t.v.

I also served on the Citizens Stamp Advisory Committee for the
Postmaster General under PMG's Day Gronouski, Larry O'Brien and under
the short tenure of the last one of the Johnson administration whose
name escapes me. It was a delightful as well as educational experience
and during that period of the '60's, commemoratives were issued in a
volume of approximately 120 million for each stamp.

I, unfortunately, am quite sure that the people who are giving
us the outrageously expensive and very poor postal service have in mind
plucking suckers for milllions of dollars to cover up at least a portion
of their losses due to inefficiency and overpayment of executives.

 

They couldn't possibly have in mind an honest appeal to people
to buy one 15¢ stamp of each commemorative issue. I admit they're
pretty careful about what they really have in mind which is to induce
the ignorant to buy sheets of stamps as an "investment" and put them
away in safe deposit boxes. (From which their heirs will take the stamps
in 20 or 30 years and sell them at a discount.)

The United States is unique, or at least almost so, in not de—
monetizing its postage stamps. You can always use them for postage, but
of course you can't take them and turn them in for money. If you bought
a sheet and saved the plate block and used the rest of the stamps for
postage, you might make a few nickels, but sheets of commemoratives
are readily obtainable from stamp dealers at a discount. A few years
back, when I was Chairman of the Democratic Party in California, I arranged
to buy some $10,000 of stamps at ad ten percent discount from a New York
dealer. Some complications arose and we didn't go through with it but

 
   




Chairman, U.S.
May 16, 1979
Page Two

there was no qu stion but that I could have purchased them at discount.

I beli ve that, without question, the Postal Service is taking
advantage of us-to the effect that stamps are a good investment, steadily
rising in.pr1ce. That is, of course, true for well—selected stamps where
the supply is strictly limited. It is a cruel hoax where the purchasers
are ignorant and are buying sheets of current commemoratives. They don't
get any interest. They don't get any appreciation and the stamps have,
in fact, just about like a new automobile) lost ten percent of their value
the day you buy them from the Post Office (unless you intend to use them
for postage). ~

I repeat, it is impossible that this highly expensive campaign
involving endorsements of professional athletes, full page coy r ads,
t.v., et cetera, is directed at attemptigg to influence Americans to buy
individual commemorative stamps on a one-issue basis. It must be, and it
is, an attempt to con Americans into buying commemoratives in quantity
where they can do nothing but lose money.

Over the years, we've heard brokers and bankers complain bitterly
that the SEC ought to take after the Treasury Department on the savings
bonds advertisements. Granted that in those cases, there was no clear
warning to possible investors that they might get higher interest elsewhere
but at least they got interest and they were certain to get their principal
back. That is a very different kettle of fish from these commemorative
stamps.

Thanks for listening to me.

Sincerely yours,

’ may, “xii/wt

Bennett’s fabulous beasts

Bennett’s Fables: From Aesop and Others,
by Charles H. Bennett. New York: The
Viking Press. $8.95.

Renowned 19th-century illustrator Charles
H. Bennett makes a colorful argument that
morality can be sophisticated, subtle, hu-
morous, and timeless. He puts animals in
Victorian attire and man in his place.

Gerald Gottlieb, curator of early children’s
books at the Pierpont Morgan Library, says
in his foreword to this reproduction of the
hand-colored 1857 edition that Bennett ranks
with Aesop and la Fontaine in using “his
genius to satirize adroitly” the types of people
and their preoccupations that he observed.
Bennett employs his shrewd ‘wit to instruct
on the predictability of human nature.

As in all fables, readers are reassured that
virtues have their rewards and Vices their
price. There are 22 delightful fables printed
on high 'quality, stiffer-than-usual paper with
an accompanying full-page illustration facing
each one.

Thanks for your letter.

If “12215" is the only poem you havo written for the

Dear Friends:

Dr. Andrew N. Rowan of the Institute for the Study of
Animal Problems suggested I write you for a copy of
the Diner report. I've enclosed a check for $4.00 to
cover it. 0

I've also enclosed a review I had published in a Bay
Area women's movement newspaper. The review is of Hans
Ruesch's Slaughter of the Innocent, and although it was
unhappily edited, most of the message is intact.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

My next project is a half-hour TV program exposing/opposing
animal experimentation. The prOgram will be proposed to
KQED, San Francisco's Public Broadcasting System's station.

As of now, I believe the program should include interviews,
personal narratives, film clips, slides, whatever else is
appropriate and effective.

I'm in the first stage of the project: contacting interested
people via letters, posters, advertisements, announcements.
I've written many agencies also, and often one agency can
suggest another.

I'd be most grateful for any suggestions you may have. Do
you have a list of publications you offer? Any advice at
this time would be most appreciated. I realize I'm taking
on the entire medical industry, the drug industry, and the
big business that produces animals for the labs. That's a
big chunk of capitalism, and at times this seems frightening.
But it seems to me it is vital that people be informed of

the truth. And now that I know the truth I must try to

do something about it.

Thank you for anything you may offer by way of assistance.

Dear Mr. Brown, .

In response to your kind letter, I have consulted Hope
Ryden whose studies of the wild hereee in the west have made
her a leading expert on the eubjeet. Her reeemmendatiene,
based on biological considerations, are as fellows:

. "Reduce the number of breeding females in a herd and leave
the rest alone. The breeding females reproduce and create hightr
numbers of animals. It really deeen't matter how many stallions
~are remeved from a-herd. One will accomplish the reproductive
work of all the culled melee. Game managers measure the repre-
duetive capability of deer, etc. in terms of females. In a more
mel horse population, half the herd 1e female. Females do not
reproduce until age three. Thus, it is impossible for horses to
increase their population by more than 25% annually. so long as
the sex distribution and age distribution are normal. If more
than half the herd are femalee due to previous culling. than the
rate at repreduetien will be correspondingly a higher percent.

If rarer than half the herd are female the percentage er increase
will belewer. The above figure of 25% is theoretical and does
not take into account mortality, only netelity. Herd increase,
never reaches 25% due to the fact that horses are always dying
from all causes and at all ages. - '

"Nevertheless, it eheuld be apparent tram the above that it
is not necessary to round up large numbers of males and put them
up for adoption. The number of females will determine how many
foale will be born the next~year.* By reducing the preportion of
females in a herd, this figure will be altered.

 




"Haw to do this? Water trapping in the mast humane way of
gathering mustangs so long as tho traps ara watched daily. When
a stallion anﬁ hia‘harmm are eaught, ramcve ONE female from.his band
and turn the rest laose. They will return to their awn tarritory
without being chased, run into fences, harraaaed, etc.

”The abova procadure can be repaated with savaralharamm. Wham
stud bands enter, turn tham.all lease. They do not raproduee.

"When the percentaga cf females has been reduced, so slow.
Natality.may fall ahart at noamal mortality. Then thn horaea will
naad a raw years to compensata for what will result - an annual dau
cline in numbera.

"The female that is ramovad aheuld in every caaa be yvung
and adaptable. Meat peepla want fillies anyway. The stalliens
that have been run to death and hald toravar in carpal: whara
they fight amang thamaelves, ara net attractiva to wouldmba adapters.

"This plan is aﬂmplu, deea not require expensive r9690 aqnip~
meat, riders, halieoptars, etc."

W6 lock forward to hearing further frem.you concerning the
asaeasmmnt you are making far the state at Nevada.

Washingten D.C. 20009

Dear Christine:

I have been trying te catch up an the mail that
piled up during my absence this summer. I have

been leaking fer bebcats in Idahe. an exercise

in felly.~I am afraid.

The letter yeu received frem Gerald H Brawn regarding
wild herse management in Nevada. deserves attentien.
Unfertunately. I de net have any printed material
that yeu might send te hime I de have my own ideas
abeut the best methed ta manage wild horses. hewever.
It is cheap, does net frighten. injure er disrupt
herses. and dees net require redee riders or helieepters.
I hesitate ta discuss ”management", however. fer
fear that the "managers” are more interested in
eliminating herses than in maintaining them at

truly viable levels.

If left alone. mereever. wild herses weuld stabilize

leng befere they ate up all available forage. I can

quete any number ef authorities whe will suppert this
eententien. The current thinking regarding wild ungulates
is that they are self regulatery and that predatien.
altheugh an adjunct to pepulatien regulatien. eperates
enly en animals predispesed to death from a wide

variety ef causes (not neccessarily weakness). Density.
lack ef birth sites, etc. leads to maternal neglect. i»
stupidity predispeses animals to die frem any cause,ﬁhe.
At any rate. man need net feel obligated to substitute
guns for the missing fangs ef missing predaters. Wild
ungulates. according te the best and meet respected
biolegists. will stabilize. IF ene cause ef mcrtality
fails anether will net. I quote Glen Cele chief bielegist
at Yellowstone Natienal ParK: ”On balance. mortality
equals natality. If this were net true. any given Species
weuld everrun the earth or become extinct."

 




Population intercompensation is tee large a subject fer
me to deal with in a letter. P.L. Errington is an
excellent reference fer understanding this subject.

I also discuss the subject in geg's Qog.and list
souroes that are peerless.

I am net recommending leaving the horses alone. however.
I believe they would stabilize. but perhaps at a number
that would be considered too high by eattlemen ane
sportsmen. One and half million deer on public lands.

I remind you, are eensidered too few animals. By the
same token 35,000~70.000 wild horses (the figure varies)
are regarded as fever running the range.” The subject

is tee controversial at this time to suggest "letting the
horses go." At the same time. culling them actually
stimulates reproduetitity. Here I can quote Durward Allen
whe argues that hunting has no eetrimental effect on
deer population for the above reason: He writes:
"sheeting is actually beneficial for the production of

a new crop.”

This same biolegist tells us in OUR WILDLIFE LEGACY that
"carrying capacity may have its most important offset by
influencing productivity of breeding stocks of varieus
sizes. In a given area. as the number ef breeders
increases. the preduetien and survival of their offspring

is proportionately reducede~~a relationship semetimes
referred to as ’inversity.3 This is not true as long as
a population is far below "normal” stecking, but after
a reasonable build~up it seems to hold. ”

Thus it eould be expected that the horses would not
"compensate” for population losses after a certain
buildup. Nevertheless, the politieal climate ef the

west is such that wild horses will always be "managed.”

I therefore hepe te influenee the managers to do their

jeb with as little disruption as necessary to the mustangs.

.

My.gganmmeneatieaacensinxel9ﬁllhisgftbﬂusewthernummsnrseiA

capability of deer. etc. in terms of females. In a normal

horse population, half the herd is female. Females do net

reereduce until age three. Thus, it is impossible for

horses to increase their population by more than 25% annually.

so long as the sex distribution and age distribution are

normal. If more than half the here are females due to

previous culling, then the rate of reproduotien will be

correspondingly a higher percent. If fewer than half the

herd are female the percentage of increase will be lower.

The above figure of 25% is theeretieal and does net take

into account mortality. only natality. Herd increase.

that herses are always dying frem all causes ans at all

Nevertheless. it sheuld be apparent frem the abeve

that it is not necessary te reund up large numbers of males
and put them up fer adeptien. The number of females

will determine hew many foals will be bern the next year»
By reducing the prepertion of females in a herd, this
figure will be altered.

How to do this? Water trapping is the meet humane way

of gathering mustangs se leng as the traps are watehed
daily. When a stallien and his harem are caught. remeve

ONE female from his band and turn the rest leese. They will
return te their ewn territery witheut being chased. run
into fenees. harrassed. etc.

The abeve preeedure can be reseated with several harems.
When stue bands enter. turn them all leese. They de net
repreeuee.

When the percentage ef females has been reduced. ge slew.
Natality may fall shert ef nermal mertality. Then the
herses will need a few years te compensate fer what will
result---an annual decline in numbers.

The female that is remeved sheule in every case be yeung

and adaptable. Meet peeple want fillies anyway. The stalliens
that have been run te death and held ferever in eerrals

where they fight ameng themselves. are net attractive te
weuld~be adapters.

This plan is simple. dees net require exeensive,r9gee

THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR

By Deborah Hand McRoy

Animal stories hold a‘special delight for
children. Storytellers from Aesop to Uncle
Remus have used animals in an anthropo- ,
morphic sense to entertain or teach moral
lessons. The interest in ecology and preserva-‘
tion of endangered species of the last decade,
however, has prompted writers to give chil-
dren a more realistic viewof the animal .
world. .

In On the Forest Edge, (Morrow, $5. 95),

text to explore the special habitat between
meadow and deep forest that shelters abun-

sides, railroad right-of-ways and other edges,
when [left unmoved and natural, can provide
a sanctuary for many species of mammals,
birds, insects, and vegetation. Although the

searched, with emphasis on alternative solu—
tions to problems of the animal’s relationship
with man.

In Coyote Song and Falcon Flight, particu-
larly, the basic question is the animal’s right
to survive in the face of economic interests.

I am writing a book ADVENTURES OF A ZOOLOGIST for Scribner's

OUR FELLOW ANIMALS, by Ernest P. Walker (1965).

The words I should like to use are on page i, as follows:

[On the eve of publication, parts of the manuscript
were rejected. According to Ernest, they were rejected]
“by spokesmen for the New York Zoological Society...apparently
based on the belief that because some of the statements...
are not in agreement with popular misconceptions and beliefs
they are not true. On the contrary, this material is particu—
larly designed to expose popular fallacies that are harmful
to people and other living things on which we depend, and
to stimulate thought." '

I migh add that Ernest Walker was my friend, as is also‘
Christine Stevens of your organization.

By writing a few letters, you may be
able to curb senseless animal suffering.
The Society for Animal Protective
Legislation has listed the various per-
sons or agencies to which the letters
should be addressed.

Areas in which the group is par—
ticularly interested include:

. ——Animals caught in leghold traps.
~—Bobcat, lynx and river otter which
face extinction. g

——Elephants killed by ivory sellers.

e(Puppies and kittens dying because of
lax shipping laws.

"Inhumane slaughter laws.

e-Anirnals in laboratories and factory .

farms.

Expounding on the above, there are
- two bills . pending in the subcommittee
on resource protection chaired by Sen.
John C. Culver, to restrict the use of
leghold traps. Those interested in saving
animals from needless pain should ad—
dress their letters to Culver, U. S.
Senate, Washington, D. C. 20510.

Trappers’ strong reactions against the
government’s attempt to limit the ex-

porting of bobcat, lynx and river otters’ ‘

pelts, have caused the government to
ease regulations. Consequently, these

The society urges people to write their
congressman. .,

African elephants are being killed by
the thousands for their ivory. It is es—
timated that between 100,000and 400,000

The Teale house in Hampton: perfect for watching a woodchuck sit under an apple tree

A naturalist for all Seasons

EdWin Way Teale ‘,
nature won him early

By William A. Babcock
Special to ‘
The Christian Science Monitor
Hampton, Connecticut

Great American natUralists have never con- .

formed to any one mold

There was Henry David Thoreau the tran-
scendental thinker, John _.J Audubon, the artist,

. - [And John Muir the concerned conserVationist.

Mr. Teale has been recording the natural
phenomena around him since the early 20th
century when as a boy he Would spend sum-

c0untry of northern Indiana.

‘ . Now, with 30 Hbooksto his credit - nearly 1.5

and theBurroughs Award, Mr. Teale is re-

well; He ' chuckles about his keeping 10-cent
stores in business by buying scads of their
small notebooks which he uses to record ‘such

items as species of fern, novel habits of wild—
, elite, and blooming dates of flowers.

Such penciled notes become additions to his

Inquisitive red squirrel: nature observing the naturalist

daily journals Which in turn are fodder for his
books.

“I keep these journals all the time — they’ re
your bank account,” Mr. Teale says, pointing
to one of the three bookcase-lined walls of his
study '

Mr. Teale is currently working on a book en-
titled, “A Walk Through The Year.” Expected
to be published this fall, the volume will serve
as a companion to his “A Naturalist Buys an

, Old Farm,” published by Dodd, Mead & Co.-
Man and, books linked .

It is impossible to separate Mr. Teale from
his books, especially since so many chronicle a
segments of his life. ,

“Near Horizons,” for example, describes an
insect garden he had on Long Island, New
York In “Springtime in Britain” he takes you
along on a trip he and his wife, Nellie, made of
Great Britain in the mid ’.605

Nellie, Mr. Teale’ 5 college sweetheart from
their days. at Earlham College in Richmond,
Indiana, and his wife for more than 50 years, is
a fellow naturalist. “She’s our botanist,” Mr.
Teale says with affection. “She knows so much

’more than I do on some things ”

Mr. and Mrs Teale headed south to Florida
in 1947 to begin what later became the first of
four long journeys through the four American
seasons. The trail did not end until 1962 -—
nearly 100,000 miles later.
“Autumn Across America”
(1965), I“Journey ‘Into Summer” (1960), and
“Wandering Through Winter” (1965) — and a

- Pulitzer Prize — were the result.

ened, now appear with Mr. ‘Teale’s photos in a

like to live over again. We’re preserving them
like a fly’s preserved in amber. Most of the

“The American Sea—

' books I’ve. written are like that — they pre-

serve a segment of our lives.”

Mr. Teale has received undergraduate and.

graduate degrees in English literature, but he
learned natural history through reading and
doing field studies. on his own.

As a result of his literary background, Mr.
Teale’s works are frequently graced with refi
erence to Walt Whitman, Ralph Waldo Emer-
son, Thomas Hardy, John Donne, and Charles
Dickens. Even Leonardo da Vinci, Talleyrand,
and Will Rogers make guest appearances.
Hideaway village

The Teales live in Hampton, a hideaway
New England village of 1,100 in northeastern
Connecticut, in a home Mr. Teale writes about
in “A Naturalist Buys an Old Farm.” 4

Except for the lawn surrounding their home
and for the long, overgrown, winding driveway
which leads to'the house, their property is left
in a wild state, making it a haven for numer-
ous species of' wildlife and, vegetation.

Named Trail Wood because of the inter
connecting network of trails crisscrossing the
property, the Teales bought the farm in 1959 to
be close to both nature and to New York’ 8 cen-
ters of libraryand museum research.

The white frame house has a number of win- ,

dows on each side 4 an observer’s paradise,
perfect for watching an unsuspecting 'wood-
chuck sit under an apple tree and munch on a
green apple.

A winter ‘emergency’.

Mr. Teale remembers when the electricity
went off one winter for four days and, the. liv-
ing-room fireplace provided both heat and a
means for cooking. What with the grilled beef
steaks and roast potatoes they consumed, “We
gained four or five pounds during the ‘emer-
gency,’ ”- he confides with a hearty chuckle.

The living room with its blue-patterned wall-
paper and its comertable- furniture — including

~Mr. .Teale’s favorite, his “Kennedy rocker” —

is similar to those of many rural homes across
the country. Bright, roomy, with reading mat-
ter strewn here‘and there, it serves as a gath-
ering place for friends, somewhere to relax
and read an article from Audubon magazine,
or a spot to savor one of Mrs. Teale’s “bunny
sandwiches” (two slices of buttered toast with
a thick helping of lettuce in between).

Mr. Teale-s library- s—tudy is just off the
front-door entranceway. The shelves are
chock-full with Mr. Teale’s numerous journals,
foreign-language copies of his‘books, and a nat-
ural history library to keep any biology buff

 

Edwin Way Teale: eternally curious

content for the rest of his life. Thompson Se-

'ton’s “Lives of Game Animals,” the complete
writings of Thoreau, Audubon’s “Nature Ency-

clopedia” (all 12 volumes well-worn and out of
order), and numerous field guides on birds by ‘
Roger Peterson fill the shelves of his study.

The author’s desk is situated so Mr. Teale
can easily glance to windows on either his left
or right to get a better View of his 130-acre lab-
oratory.

Mr. Teale also has a cabin. in the Woods
where he does additional research and writing.

Countless observations

The pOnd near their farm house, the bea-
v_ers’ dam, the wild meadows, and the thick
forest groves have been studied countless
times. Some 32 species of ferns and 145 differ-
ent birds have been observed here over the
past 18 years. (Bird No. 145 — a greathorned
owl - was spotted in late August as it booted
from a hickory tree just outside the Teale’s
bedroom window.)

Even with so much study Mr. Teale admits,
“We’ll never know half of what wethave. We
keep discovering new things all the time. The
interest in things never wears out. It would be

‘a very sad thing if you were to arrive at the
"state where you realized you were no longer

interested — it would he a failure on your

paI‘t_,, ‘

ALL 53 countries represented at
the United Nations Conference on
Human Environment, meeting in
Stockholm; voted unanimously (53
to zero) to halt the killing: of whales,
an endangered species. 80 did the
United Nations Environment Pro-
gram -— unanimously.

The British, Dutch, Greeks
and Norwegians have given up

whaling. They have" also urged the

JapaneSe and Russians to stop —.
. to: no avail. Both haVe persisted.

1" . The Japanese and Russians are ,
members of the International g
' Whaling Commission.

But the
’IWC is not part of the United Na-

, tions and is, in fact, merely a
whaling club without authority.

' The Japanese and Russians veto

, all regulations that reduce quotas in
the killing of this endangered spe- '
'cies. Even the pleas of the late Brig.

Gen. Charles A. Lindbergh, who
traveled to (Tokyo to present the.

years.
Lindbergh told the Japanese that

danger of extinction. Since the time
of Christ, he stated, one vertebrate
animal has become extinct every 20

. years. Today the average is one ani-

mal every year.
There are eight species of great

f whales. One whale is usually the size

problem, met only deaf ears. Yet I

Lindbergh himself pointed out that ‘
more than two million whales had '1
been slaughtered in the past . 50
' earth - bigger than any prehistoric

more than 1,000 animals are now in ~

of 30 elephants. The Blue Whale 1s

the largest. In fact, it is the largest
animal ever to have existed on our

monster.

But Whalers have killed so many'
‘ and so few are left; so few that they
‘ seldom find each other to breed. The
Blue Whale’ s mating call can be - »
: heard at least 50 miles. And much ,

deeper in the sea -- between the

[warm surface layer and the dense

cold layers in the sound channels «—

endanger the whales

the mating cries can be heard by an-

other whale for about 400 miles.

A whale 3 ear is so's'mall that it
Would be hard to wedge even a pen.

' oil into it, yet the whale has better

hearing than a man. In fact, whales
can tell the emotional State of each

other by their sonar echoes.

The whale’ 5 muscles are
stronger than steel but more resil-
ient than nylon. The swipe of a
whale’ s tail is overwhelmingly the _

' most powerful blow in" the entire
animal kingdom. Second comes,
the kick of a kangarOo’ 5 foot. The

' whale’s voice can make more;
sounds than any creature, ’includ-f

‘ ing birds. -

Mankind’s first bonanza was the
whale. We have been hunting whales
on the high seas for at least "a
lthousand years and through many
developments in the searching. But
the fact remains. there; is still no
greater natural mystery than the
origin of the whale.

It is interesting too that dogs
do not like catnip. Why, I do not

on this particular subject.

Please do not give catnip to
cats with kidney ailmcnts, nor is
it wise if they are hungry since it
may cause vomiting if eaten.
Some cat lovers leave catnip in a
dish available to their pets at all .
times. Others give it
occasionally. My two Siamese

If your cat is bored, catnip

By Jags TYRELL

The Humane Society of the
U.S., New Jersey Branch, has
caused the introduction of a
New Jersey bill which will result
in impounded dogs and cats
being sent to laboratories. Do
not judge this society by the
New Jersey Chapter which is so
poorly represented. A

The bill contains the following
section:

“Each municipal governing
body may enact ordinances
pertaining to the humane control
of all dogs, cats or other animals.
consistent with this act.”

The HSUS-NJ bill of last year
contained identical wording, in
reference to which the HSUS-NJ
said in a bulletin, under the
heading of" “Important
Features”: “Control is nearly all
with local governing bodies. This
includes diSposition of strays.”_
“Not an anti-vivisection bill.
Local government decides
disposition above.” " '

Thus the ordinances
include the power
impounded animals to
laboratories. When the
legislature resumes this month,
the HSUS will probably push its
current bill. The HSUS bill must
be opposed as the cruel betrayal
of animals which it is.

The number of the HSUS bill
is Senate 841. It was introduced
in May by Senators Maraziti,
Hagedorn, Siscob,Giuliano,
Dowd,- Schiaffr gf-“Tl‘sbowlton,
DelTufo, sciro,“ ~ "t‘d
Hiering. .

Write to your NJ. State (not
US.) Senator, at the State
House, Trenton. Tell him that
you strongly Oppose S. 841
because it will result in
impounded animals going to
laboratories.

As you know from one of my
recent columns, Senator James
H. Wallwork also introduced a
bill whi ould result in
impoum going to
laboratories “a

Will have information on how
many sick animals are used in
the laboratories in one of my.
future columns.

Dear Mrs. Stevens:

On a recent trip to Washington, I spoke with Toby COOper and Mrs. Joan Blue who
recommended that I contact you about animal welfare issues. I am presently

working on a study of attitudes and behavior towards animals, both domestic and
wild, which is being directed by Dr. Stephen Kellert of the Yale School of Forestry
and Environmental Studies. I realize that you have been informed about our study
by Keith Aubry. However I feel that it is important that I also write to you
because I am dealing specifically with animal welfare issues and you are

a representative of both the Animal Welfare Institute and the Society for

Animal Protective Legislation. Would it be possible for you to answer some

of the following questions?

(I) Do you have any literature, articles or surveys of opinions which reflect
on the animal welfare attitudes of your organizations, your members or the
public?

(2) Do your organizations have specific policies or do your members have
certain attitudes on the following issues: .w , trvgﬁ J,,A ,

trapping

animal rights

marine mammal protection

predators

feral animals

hunting , R .
laboratory experimentation §.-£fWﬂ 2
others J;

AAAAAAAr-x
D'LQ “h (D Q. 0 U— Q)

(3) Can you recommend any references of data and literature, or suggest other
persons who might be relevant to contact?

There is a slight chance that I may come to Washington Friday, November l8.
If so I may be authorized by Dr. Kellert to request an interview with you
and the other people working on this study will give me specific questions
concerning their aspects of the research.

I realize that I am asking for a great deal of information. Your input is
greatly appreciated and will certainly be of value for our research.

Dear Ms. Gould:

Thanks for your letter and your kind words about my article
on the gray whale in ﬂountain Gazette.

I published another piece that may interest you: "To Kill
9. Whale" in the January/February 1977 Oceans, which istpublished
by the Oceanic Society. The article is a study of “conservation"
under the IWC. A '

At the moment, I'm hard at work on a book about whales and
whaling, and I'd liketo take you up on your offer of further
information. The background handout entitled ”Some Facts about

Whales" says of the gray whale: ”Recently discovered figures show,

however, that this species was never reduced below 50% of its ori-

ginal population." Can you tell me the source for this statement?
I'd very much like to run it down.

Also, please remember me on your mailing list if you put to»
gather anything on this year’s IWC meeting. The Whalers cloak '
themselves in officious secrecy, and in my book. I very much want to
eXpose them for what they are.

All the best, and most particularly success in saving the
whales from the whalers. ‘

Sincerely,

”£11?"

Dear Mr. Mohally,

Thanks for your nice letter of the let of June. It
is good to know that you are writing a book about whales
and whalinc. I phoned the Marine MammaleCommission here to
get a reference on a study by Dale Rice, which I believe
is the source for the statement you wanted. It is as
follows:

Rice, D.W., A.A. Wolman. 1971. The Life History
and Ecology of the Gray Whale. Special publication
#3, The American Society of Mammelogists.

 

 

If you can't find this in the lhhrary I understand
copies are available from Dr. Bryan P. Glass, Secretary/
Treasurer, American Society of Memmalogists, Department
of Zoology, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, Okla~
home 74074.

In case you haven't alaeady heard the result of the
IWC meeting, E am enclosing a copy of the last telex we
received from Canberra giving the final results. I will
also pass your letter along to Christine Stevens, President
of the Animal Welfare Institute. She went to the meeting
as an official observer and usually there is a report on
the IWC meeting published in the AWI's Informitéon Report.
She will see that you get that also. Do keep her posted
on your book for I know she will be interested.

Best wishes,

Sincerely,

Barbara Gould

The era fairly beamed with cooper-
ation among nations. Horror beyond
name or knowledge had been loosed at
Buchenwald and Stalingrad and Hiro-
shima, and the statesmen were anxious to
erect, on the ruins of war, a peace founded
on good—neighborliness. Advancing the
cause begun in the still new United
Nations, representatives of fourteen gov-
ernments met in Washington, DC, in
late 1946, to establish the International
Whaling Commission (IWC).

The charter of the IWC made specific
note of the exploitation characterizing the
whaling industry’s past: ”The history of
whaling has seen the overfishing of one
area after another and of one species after
another to such a degree that it is essential
to protect all species of whales from
further overfishing." Bearing this necessity
in mind, the cooperating governments
imposed upon themselves rules designed
to ”provide for the proper conservation of
whale stocks and make possible the or—
derly development of the whaling in-
dustry." These regulations prohibited the
killing of the nearly extinct gray, right, and
bowhead whales, and of cows with calves,
set opening and closing dates for whaling
seasons, and established a minimum size
for each commercially sought species.

The United Nations hardly went the
way its dreamers imagined it would. Far
from freeing the human race from the
shackles of nationalism, the United Na-

; JANUARY 1977

tions provided the powerful and the
mighty with yet another source of power
and might. Despite its rhetoric, the IWC
has presided over the greatest slaughter of
whales the world has ever known.

As the Second World War ended and
the International Whaling Commission
began, large numbers of whales remained
to be found. To be sure, past hunting had
ravaged certain species. The bowhead and
the right, long mainstays of the industry,
were virtually extinct. The Korean herd of
gray whales was gone, and the California
herd numbered no more than 200 animals.
Only half the original population of Sperm
whales survived, but that half still totaled
500,000. And off the southern ice there
remained seas full of rorquals.

Perhaps it was this seeming infinity of
Whales that led the conservationists
among the founders of the IWC into
thinking that whales could be managed
like any game animal. In the United States,
wildlife management ensured the survival
of ducks and deer even as hunters ”har-
vested” their autumnal limit. The lW('
charter incorporated similar management
practices by protecting endangered spen
cies and calving mothers and by setting
quotas, minimum sizes, and seasons.

However, the charter provided the form
of enlightened conservation without sup—
plying the substance. To begin with, the
charter members of the IWC — Australia,

Argentina, Britain, Canada, Denmark,

By Robert McNally

France, Iceland, Japan, Mexico, New
Zealand, Norway, Panama, South Africa,
the Soviet Union, and the United States —
did not include all the world's Whalers.
Brazil became a member later, but China,
Portugal, Spain, South Korea, Somalia,
Chile, and Peru stayed out despite invita-
tions to join. The independents had little
reason to come in from the cold. They
could whale as they pleased, with no
regard for quotas or protected species, and
they were not subject to any sanctions
from IWC. countries. Nothing in the
charter prevents an IWC member from
selling whaling equipment to non—
members or from buying their whaling
products. In time, the poaching allowed by
these loopholes became all too clear.
Furthermore, the IWC lacks the power
to police its membership. The rules
require every factory ship to carry an IWC
observer to ensure that the kill includes
only whales of acceptable size and species.
However, until 1972, the observer was of
the same nationality as the ship he served,
rendering these supposed watchdogs
toothless indeed. No Soviet observer was
about to turn his skipper in for blowing a
right whale out of the water; more impor—
tant men than he had disappeared into the
Lubyanka for much, much less. Although
the observers are now international, the
IWC itself cannot punish offenders. It can
merely recommend disciplinary action
against a transgressor by his government,

without any assurance that such action
will be taken.

Similar weakness the
seemingly good intent of the quota sys-
tem. If a particular IWC nation dislikes the
quota set at the annual summer meeting, it
can escape the limitation simply by filing
an objection within ninety days. It is like
having a duck season in which each hunter
sets his own bag limit.

In the early days of the IWC no objec—
tions had to be filed, for the simple reason
that the quotas were higher than the
whalers could fill. The kill started out big
— 31,072 whales in 1951 — and grew larger.
By 1960 whales were being slaughtered at
the rate of over 50,000 a year. In 1962 the
whalers outdid themselves; the reported
kill exceeded 66,000 animals, the bloodiest
season ever.

Understand the historical context of
these figures. It took all the men and all the
ships of New Bedford, the principal Mas-
sachusetts whaling port, over a century
and a half to kill 30,000 whales. Now twice
that many died in a single year.

Because of a peculiarity in the IWC
quota system, that toll fell most heavily on
the blue whale, the largest of the rorquals.
The annual quota was stated not in
numbers per species, but in Blue Whale
Units, or BWUs. To kill one BWU, a
whaler could take one blue whale, or two
finbacks, or two and a half humpbacks, or
six seis. Since it is every bit as costly to
chase, kill, and butcher one sei as it is for
one blue, the whalers concentrated on the
blues and took other species only when
they had to. The effect was catastrophic. In
1931 the biggest pre-IWC whaling season,
the Antarctic kill of 30,000 blues repre-
sented almost seventy-five percent of the
total catch. In 1964 the kill of 63,000
whales included only 372 blue whales —
less than one—half of one percent of the
total. No more than 2,000 blue whales
remained out of a pOpulation that once
numbered in the vicinity of 200,000
animals.

Again, the historical context. It took
over five centuries to hunt the bowhead
and right whales to near extinction.
Civilizations came and went, nations and
kings rose and fell to other nations and
kings, and the whales held on throughout
it all. Now, a whale that had scarcely been
hunted before 1910 was commercially ex-
tinct fifty years later. A man could be born
to a world where animals thrived, and
witness their death well before he met his
own.

The biologists and statisticians of the
IWC’s Scientific Committee were, of

course, in the thralldom of the whaling
industry, but certain facts were distress-
ingly obvious to them. For one, the blue
whale’s survival as a species was very
doubtful. For another, the whalers had
shifted their sights to the finback, the
second largest rorqual, and they were
decimating a steadily decreasing popula-
tion each year. Had the finback also been
doomed to extinction? Oil yield per whale
had shrunk by almost twenty percent in
some species, a statistic that meant the
whalers were killing smaller and younger
animals each year. Instead of harvesting
surplus fruit, the whaling industry was
pruning the vine to its roots.

By the 1964 meeting of the member na-
tions of the IWC, the Scientific Committee
had made a number of hard proposals:
protection for blues and humpbacks, a
drastic cut in quotas, replacing the BWU
with species—by-species quotas. The
representatives disbanded in rancorous
disagreement. An emergency meeting the
next year lowered quotas, though by no
means enough, and granted protection to
the few remaining blues and humpbacks.
As for the BWU, it was faring better than
its namesake, remaining very much alive
until 1971.

Meanwhile, pressures mounted for
putting a permanent end to whaling. Much
of this wave of sentiment arose in the
United States, perhaps because the long
time American abstinence from whaling
had engendered a kind of premature post—
industrialism. At the time, John Lilly was
experimenting with bottlenose dolphins
and publishing his fanciful, probably true,
and certainly attractive ideas about the
cetacean mind. Then Roger Payne record-
ed the songs of the humpback whale, and
there came a popular realization that this
creature, whose blubber had been boiled
into oil for margarine and cosmetics, and
whose meat had been ground to feed dogs
and cats, possessed a highly developed,
communicating intelligence. A visible
shudder ran through the environmen—
talists. They felt like the gods of Greece
discovering that the feast Tantalus had
served them was a stew made from his
only son.

In 1972 Congress passed the Marine
Mammals Protection Act. This law
prohibited whaling in American waters,
and by American citizens —— thus closing
the one last shore station at Point Rich-
mond, California —- barred any ship car—
rying whale products from using Amer—
ican port facilities, and outlawed the im—
portation of any whale product. Sub-
sequently, Britain, which was importing

about 30,000 tons of whale meat and oil a
year (the yield of some 2,700 whales),
passed a similar law against imports.

The line was drawn in the IWC, with the
Soviet Union and Japan on one side op—
posing any further restriction of whaling,
and the United States with most of the
remaining nations on the other side
promoting the strictest conservation. The
politics involved came to a head in 1973,
after the United Nations Conference on
the Human Environment in Stockholm
approved a resolution calling for a
world-wide ten—year moratorium on
whaling. Carried into the IWC, the United
Nations resolution garnered little more
than polite acknowledgment from the
whaling powers. ”Stockholm was an ex-
pression of opinion," said the chairman of
the IWC. ”Here we are in the real world.”

But the real world had its own way of
slowing the pace of whaling. To kill a
whale you have to find it, and whales were
becoming hard to find. Hunt as they
would, the whalers killed only about
33,000 whales in 1973, almost 5,000 under
the quota. The implication was obvious:
few whales had survived the cataclysm of
postwar whaling.

The facts of whaling life have forced the
Russians and Japanese to accept lowered
kills. The quota declined to 32,578 in 1975
and stands at 29,939 for the upcoming
1976 season. While this represents a con-

siderable improvement over the berserk
slaughter of only a decade ago, remember
again the historical relativity of the
numbers: even at the present reduced rate,
contemporary man kills as many whales in
one season as the New Bedford whalers
killed in 160 years.

Modern whaling burns more high-
priced fuel, and must meet bigger payrolls,
than the old style had to, and with the
catch falling off, earnings have plummeted
as well. Last winter, the Soviets put one of
their three Antarctic fleets in mothballs.
The six Japanese whaling companies laid

I off half their 3,000 employees, and merged

into the Japan Joint Whaling Company, to
cut costs. ‘

Whaling has long followed an economic
logic of extinction, and now, with the
whales nearly extinct, the industry itself is

dying. Cuts in sperm whale quotas have
seriously hampered the Russian opera-
tion, which relies principally on sperm
whales. According to Nikolai Makarov,
the Soviet chargé d’affaires in Ottawa, his
government will give up whaling within
the next two years. The Japanese cannot
continue much longer than the Russians.
About the best they can hope for is to limit
their losses and withdraw from the in-
dustry in an orderly way.

The foreseeable end to whaling, how-
ever, places the surviving whales in as
much jeopardy as continued whaling
would. With earnings cut to the bone, the
incentive is strong for a whaler to take any
whale he can, no matter what size or
species. Why bother with such considera-
tions when there are creditors and stock-
holders to satisfy?

The threat to the gray whale is par—
ticularly troubling. Of the protected
species, only the gray has recovered
somewhat, its present population num-
bering about 11,000. With that many
whales concentrated in limited feeding
grounds and migration routes, the gray
offers the prospect of an easy windfall for
the whalers. Of course, the first step

toward realizing that profit is to strip the
gray of its protection, an action likely to
make waves in Canada, the United States,
and Mexico. In March 1975 Motosuki
Yuri, a business agent claiming to repre-
sent the Taiyo whaling concern, visited
Carl Hubbs, a Scripps Institution profes-
sor emeritus and long time student of the
gray whale, and the Mexican fisheries
authorities, to discuss renewed whaling in
the lagoons of Baja California. Yuri failed
in his mission. In a reply to a letter from
Hubbs about the incident, the president of
Taiyo disclaimed any knowledge of Yuri
and any intention to whale in North
America. Perhaps Yuri was, as Hubbs
believes, simply free—lancing in the hope

JANUARY 1977

of a commission if his effort succeeded.
But the suspicion remains that Taiyo
wrapped itself in a cloak of deniability
while checking the possibility of seeking
that gray whale bonanza.

There is another way to surmount the
hurdles of quota and protection: get a little
help from your friends. A number of the
non-ICW whaling operations, which har-
vest 4,000 whales a year, are shadow en-
terprises. The Japanese finance and man—
age shore stations in Peru and Chile, and
they provide the market for the South
Korean catch. Off western Africa, an area
closed to whaling by IWC regulation, the
whaler Sierra, under the colors of Somalia,
hunts Bryde’s whales. The animals are
butchered under the watchful eyes of
Japanese meat merchants, and the prime
cuts are frozen for shipment to the home
islands bearing the label ”Produce of
Spain.”

No rationale, save the short-sighted
logic of market economics, can support
continued whaling. Arguments about
special products and food from whales
abound, but they are largely chimerical.
The only necessity that dictates the killing
of whales is the desire for profits.

protected everywhere
except in North Atlantic,
only 60,000 remain out of

Sperm oil has long been important to
industry as a superb lubricant that works
well even under high temperatures and
pressures. Before the ban on whale im-
ports, sperm oil was used in this country as
a major component of automobile trans-
mission fluid. The Russians set aside much
of the yield from their whaling fleets to
maintain their intercontinental ballistic
missiles. However, sperm oil is no longer a
unique and irreplaceable product. Recent
research, spurred by the pioneering work
Of Nicholas Mirov and Noel Vietmeyer,
found that sperm oil is virtually duplicated
by the oil from the jojoba (Simmomlsia
chinensis or Simmondsia cali/ornica), a‘ com—
mon evergreen shrub of the Sonoran des-

ert of Mexico and the southwestern
United States. Plantation style agriculture
of this plant, which appears to be both
feasible and profitable, eliminates any
need to continue the killing of sperm
whales.

Sperm whale meat is distinctly inedible.
The Russian whalers grind it into a meal
used as feed on the state fur farms, which
supply half the world's pelts and provide
the Soviet Union with considerable
amounts of foreign exchange. The Japa—
nese also take sperm whales because of the
economic value of their oil, but they har—
vest other species, particularly the minke
whale, for food. In defending whaling, the
Japanese often argue the importance of
whales to their diet, making a case that is
overstated yet persuasive.

As to the overstatement, the Japanese
argument casts whale meat as a crucial
source of protein in a protein—poor diet.
The facts sp‘eak otherwise. Whale meat
makes up less than one percent of the
protein consumed in Japan, and per capita,
protein intake is nearly twice the recom-
mended minimum. However, whale meat
means more to the Japanese than the
amount of amino acids it supplies. Whale
is a common item in the diet of particular
prefectures whose people have long been
used to taking from the sea at will, and
who balk at the notion of any limit on that
take. To these people, whale meat is as
much a part of their lives as guns are to the
members of the National Rifle Asso—
ciation.

The Japanese relationship to whales is
instructive, not because it is uniquely
Japanese, but because it is revealingly
human. They kill whales as they wish and
seem little troubled by their circumventing
the self—regulation concommitant with
IWC membership, by means of silent
partnerships and pirate whalers. Yet on
the island of Saikai—to, the embryos taken
from slaughtered females are given Bud—
dhist names and interred in a special tomb,
and every April a Requiem service is held
to commemorate all the whales killed that
year.

”In the world of mammals, there are two
mountain peaks,” writes Toizo Ozawa.
“One is Mount Homo Sapiens, and the
other Mount Cetacea." How odd that the
one pinancle has chosen to lay waste the
other so senselessly. E

 

Robert McNally first felt the curious magic of
cetaceans when a finback surfaced alongside his
skiff in the Sea of Cortez. He is the author of
Biology: An Uncommon Introduction and con-
tributes regularly to the Pacific Sun Literary
Quarterly.

Your May-June ’76 issue was excellent. par—

most part in museums instead of on the water

alive as Carl Hathaway of Saranac Lake builds

Nessmuk’s prediction will come true: HI hope at
no distant day to meet independent canoeists, with
canoes weighing twenty pounds or less, at every

Against hunting

I can’t believe how you people, and the people
who correspond with you, can sit and discuss
hunting in such abstract terms. You are so detach-
ed from the reality ofit all. It’s not as if the hunted
creatures are mere targets or trophies—-those
animals are alive. They eat, sleep, breathe, breed,
and feel. And the reality is that bullets hurt.

First the hunter—who somehow thinks it’s
great fun and even a sport, like tennis or bowling,
to blow some creature’s brains out—kills off the
natural predators like mountain lions, wolves, and
foxes and then proclaims he has to kill off the prey
in order to maintain a natural balance. Great self-
serving logic that is.

I think it is entirely possible to control animal
populations by other and more humane means—
either by the reintroduction of predators or by
biochemical methods.

Even if it were deemed absolutely necessary
for some animals to be killed to insure the survival
of others, I don’t see why this should be done by a
guy who just came from a sporting goods store or
worse yet, from a tavern.

Hunting is a cruel and crude activity. There is

\no sporting contest possible between a creature as

benign as a deer and a high-powered rifle. The gun

always wins.

Dolphins

Albert (1. Jensen’s closing paragraph in the ar-
ticle ”Cousin to ManH (May-June ’76) states that
the ancients believed that "twice, in mankind’s
history, dolphins have approached to establish a
bond with humans." l was wondering if any ex-

plicit incidents are l't't‘()l’tit‘tl, and ill SO where?

by Aristotle and like so many translations of ancient
writings, the specific incidents to go with the remark
are not included. Below are listed some recent books

Selfish bird

The sparrow on the ground warns the other
that his find, a seed, is not to be compromised.

Best wishes for continued success.

My father who died in 1968 was past president
of the Wildlife League of Albany in the 1940’s.
Clayton Seagers, your former director, was one of
his fondest hunting companions.

Critical note

Being a subscriber to THE CONSERVATIONIST for
many years I feel I must write regarding your lean-
ing to almost complete environmental and conser-
vation articles and editorials. I am a hunter and
fisherman and miss those articles on hunting and
fishing. I am also a Hunter Safety Instructor with
the Department of Environmental Conservation

"Lilly on '

and find that I can hardly recommend your
magazine anymore to my students.

Why has the policy of this magazine changed
so much in the last few years? Surely the loss of
hunters and fishermen who subscribe to your
magazine will destroy this magazine. Trying to in-
terest ten or twenty thousand college students and
losing the interest of three and-a-half million
hunters and fishermen is a bad policy. I hope my
views will be taken as constructive criticism.

Anthony Peluso, Howard Beach

0 THE CONSERVA TIONIST contains many
features on hunting and fishing. The magazine also
contains environmental and conservation articles.
Does Mr. Peluso believe that hunters and fishermen
are unconcerned about the environment? The fact is
that hunters and fishermen were among the first to
recognize the threat to the environment and today as
ever they support this magazine’s crusade to conserve,
protect and enhance the environment.—-Edit0r.

Homer print

Your May-June 1976 issue holds so many in-
teresting articles and beautiful color prints.

I cut out the Winslow Homer print and framed
it. It is so free and clear and true and exquisite.

remember it when my father took me boating on
Seventh Lake, Fulton Chain, an age ago!

Thank you for giving us all, young and old,

such a fine magazine in every respect.

Starlings and bluebirds

In the "Letters Department” of the March-
April issue of THE CONSERVATIONIST, Worthington
Rider of Kingston wrote about the starlings get-

ling their heads into the entrance of bluebird

houses and destroying the eggs. We have a
number of houses set up for tree swallows.
Bluebirds and wrens have also used them.

I would think a starling would need a perch
from which to get his head into the entrance hole.
Bluebirds and swallows require no perch.

Late in the season of 1974‘ I saw four bluebirds
momentarily perched on top of one of the bird
houses. I had seen a pair in the spring. Then no
more until the one sighting of the four in the fall.
We have starlings.

Misuse of land

I subscribe to THE CONSERVATIONIST. I must
thank you and your entire staff. Your magazine
does appeal to the average citizen—me.

I am a homemaker. My family and’I live in
Queens, New York. Eight years ago we purchased
land in a development in the Poconos. We had
only a shell erected. My husband and the entire
family literally built our home. It became a labor
of love for the family. As our home grew the com—
munity did also. The problems now confronting us
are huge. ’We have to deal with a developer who
has unlimited funds and hundreds ofthousands of
acres. It seems they have fifteen hundred acres ad-
joining our development. The developer has decid-
