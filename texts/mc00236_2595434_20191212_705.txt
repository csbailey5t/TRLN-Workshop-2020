LINCOLN PARK ZOO, Thalarctus Maritimus

Viewed from the ramp, these spacious cliffs
and generous feast of water offer

Arctic nirvana. Off in a corner

the solitary polar bear

is making a sort of backward somersault

in ice—green sheets of spray.

Below,
through plate glass observation ports
one sees how he does it. Again!

Again, that tumbling circle! The amazing
bulk of him sailing by in a mantle
of bubbles, the huge paws thrusting off.
The ecstasy of his creamy fur
as it billows past, revealing at belly's
root the neat rosette of his sex. .
The priestly head is bowed in a nimbus
of foam. Eyes shut, he does not notice
us. Children, awestruck, then bored
begin to bang on the glass. The parents'
cameras dangle: there's nothing here
for a snapshot. Nothing to watch except
compulsion's endless arc.

They leave.
The acrobat goes on with.his ritual.
Wbrking to get it right? Each turning
your try for the perfect dive? Or have you
become a prayer-wheel, repeating
some mantra ice floes chant
into the polar darkness? There is no
ice here in your private ocean.
They gave you artful rocks, azure
lagoon, a black hatchway that leads
indoors.

All night, I hold against my body
the curve of your body‘s journey.

For Jeremy

I Monkeys

Two little creatures
With faces the size of
A pair of pennies

Are clasping each other.
"Ah, do not leave me,”
One says to the other,
In the high monkey-
Cage in the beast-shop.

There are no people to gape at them now,
For people are loth to

Peer in the dimness;

Have they not builded

Streets and playhouses,

Sky-signs and bars,

To lose the loneliness

Shaking the hearts

Of the two little Monkeys?

Yes. But who watches
The penny-small faces
Can hear the voices:

"Ah, do nOt leave me;

And slumps downward again in cusromary lethargy
om which no mere yeast of merriment

His eyes are mournful, but the long lined palm

He thrusts between the bars expects the best.

His old man’s face as innocent as calm,

The beggar puts compassion to the test

And fails. He grips the bars; his pained stare grows
To a brown study framed in dusty fur.

He has a cold. He sneezes, cleans his nose,

Then gravely licks a flexible forefinger.

A pause; the bald mauve hand from which men shrink,
The fingers, strong to clutch, quick to explore,

Again extended, are again refused,

The eyes, poor sorrow’s jewels, seldom wink,

‘But to his grinning public, as before,

Show endless patience, endlessly abused.

 




 

THE jAGUAR

The apes yawn and adore their ﬂees in the sun.
The parrots shriek as if they were on ﬁre, or strut
Like cheap tarts to attract the stroller with the nut.
Fatigued with indolence, tiger and lion

Lie still as the sun. The boa-Constrictor’s coil
Is a fossil. Cage after cage seems empty, or
Stinks of sleepers from the breathing straw.
It might be painted on a nursery wall.

But who runs like the rest past these arrives

At a cage where the crowd stands, stares, mesmerized,
As a child at a dream, at ajaguar hurrying enraged
Through prison darkness after the drills of his eyes

On a short ﬁerce fuse. Not in boredom—

The eye satisﬁed to be blind in ﬁre,

By the bang of blood in the brain deaf the ear—
He spins from the bars, but there’s no age to him

More than to the visionary his cell:

His stride is wildernecses of freedom:

The world rolls under the long thrust of his heel.
Over the cage ﬂoor the horizons come.

551 The Howling 0f Wolves

IS without world.

What are they dragging up and out on their long leashes of sound

That dissolve in the mid-air silence?

Then crying of a baby, in this forest of starving silences,

Brings the wolves running.

Tuning of a violin, in this forest delicate as an owl’s ear,

Brings the wolves running—brings the steel traps clashing and
slavering,

The steel furred to keep it from cracking in the cold,

The eyes that never learn how it has come about

That they must live like this,

That they must live

Innocence crept into minerals.

The wind sweeps through and the hunched wolf shivers.
It howls you cannot say whether out of agony or joy.

The earth is under its tongue,

A dead weight of darkness, trying to see through its eyes.

The wolf is living for the earth.

But the wolf is small, it comprehends little.

It goes to and fro, trailing its haunches and whimpering horribly.

It must feed its fur.

The night snows stars and the earth creaks.

New Providence Island, Bahamas

Pallid as one fish dying,

the day bloats with heat.

Underneath a lard-white sun

my guide enters a whitewashed building,

strays along walls,

gazes toward a tank of brooding water.

I peer down at sea turtles, filmy green,

adrift in a squat sea.

Excrement bobs in the tank like kelp.

In a dark nook at the rear of the market

two men play a game with plum seed dice,

while one man, back of a snailtrack of dirt,

leans on a broom.

Nearby, the guide extends a blue, enamel basin,
chipped, heavy with its pale strips of sweet, wet meat.
But I see and have seen simply two enormous turtles.

A restaurant has ordered them,

two which awhile ago were wrestled from the tank,
hurled out into the stark, dusty universe of this floor,
now in immense exhaustion, »

heaving, stifling, drowning in air:

dark, salt-caked eyes, profoundly old, straining like the sea,
jaws, horny and toothless, giving off gasp and suck,
'faded yellow bony shells upturned

and, where spiked, blackened by a fist of flies,
leathery limbs extending in a desperate, slow shiver.

The hands of an overhead fan revolve like a clock.
Weak, I lean toward light and shadow
struggling at the door.

Now an iodine sun,

dark blood clabbered on the gills of fish-colored sky.
I lurch in a crowd.

The tourists are taking pictures of passion fruit.

In my ear, far off, I hear the rush and hum of fluids,
pulse of currents.

I feel, far in, a deep sea floor upon which something is asway.
Its form (delicate as the roar of a seashell)

dilates like a membranous sac, pitches,

tosses on a fibrous stalk,

labors in distended blackness.

Something would come forth, would make a gesture strange
and green as motions of a seaweed hand.

Something human would emerge from original silence

and speak with the clarity of water,

would grope toward birth,

would, into stark, bright air, astonished, rise.

The wharf is slippery with the eyes of bonefish.

Song of a Rat (\DDQ

I. The Rat’s Dance
The rat is in the trap, it is in the trap,

And attacking heaven and earth with a mouthful of screeches like torn tin,

An effective gag.
When it stops screeching, it pants

And cannot think
“This has no face, it must be God” or

“No answer is also an answer.”
Iron jaws, strong as the whole earth

Are stealing its backbone
For a crumpling of the Universe with screechings,

For supplanting every human brain inside its skull with a rat-body that
knots and unknots,
A rat that goes on screeching,

Trying to uproot itself into each escaping screech,
But its long fangs bar that exit—

- The incisors bared to the night spaces, threatening the constellations,
The glitterers in the black, to keep off,

Keep their distance,
While it works this out.

The rat understands suddenly. It bows and is still,
With a little beseeching of blood on its nose-end.

110%W, . O .

The rat he rs the wind sayi g something in the straw
And the ni t-ﬁelds that ave come up to the fence, leaning their silence,

The widowed la d
With its trees tha k ow how to cry

VVobbling like re ection on ter.

ANCIENT JUSTICE

AP wire service: "The chimps were being taken to a laboratory
in Maryland when the attack occurred around 2:15 a.m....the
police dispatcher didn't know why they were going to the lab

and couldn't explain the reason for the attack."

In the middle of the night they came.
The glare of lights and men's voices
drummed through the misty January air
like surgical steel striking the cage's
bars. The familiar one smelled

as he always did—-of smoke and food.

But an odor like death clung to the coat
of the other one. When they broke

our sleep and entered our den, I knew

it was for our lives. I said to my mate:

Better to die here than to place our fate

in hands that touch us but cannot feel.

As soon as I was clear of the cage,

I turned on it and bit that hideous smell.

I tore its fingers off and the opposable thumb,
the thing that gives them all their power. I bit
its ear, deaf anyway to our cages of grief.

I bit its face, as full of fear as my own.

It screamed till our keeper put it into a cage.
Without its thumb, it becomes like us!

But I, with only vegan teeth, no rope,

no cage, no gun, I made sure I did not go

to the lab. Though now I die,

I saw a little justice done.

Carries an inse t’s wiry song.

'hy. ‘
MM"

Wedged in a small tank of water

at the roadside 200, a five—foot alligator
curves like a busted tire, in so tight

his mouth goes up one hot metal side,

his tail up the other. His eyes open

straight into mine. I am nine.

I can see how bad it feels.

My parents know it’s wrong. Silent,
embarrassed, we all stand there till

Dad politely questions the ticket-man:
"Isn’t that tank too small?” . ---.
“Nah,” says the gashand who doubles

as zookeeper, "he likes it that way.”

We climb back into our car and drive away.

Now in the Everglades, the place they call
Paradise Key, a little gator surprises me

as he steps out of the sawgrass

six feet away. He crosses my path,

dragging a few reeds over to the pool

where bluegill swim. He means to go fishing.
Something sly and cheerful bubbles

in his glance, and in me, watching him
watching me from the water. He has his life.
He has plans! That’s what his eyes say.

And suddenly I want to bless the tribe

of alligators and the beauty of horned

and glistening skin. I see the primeval
symmetry of reptiles ﬂoating with their prey
in the Everglades. May they go free

of all I know about the tribe of man.

DISPLACED

Antlers ram my house,

batter the east siding,

then loci: with the downspeot.
Edging backward,

the animal

pries the metal pipe

toward the sidewalk.

All twenty feet gives way

and he clahks down Sylvan Stree ,
the monstrous antenna
throwing sparks

at children and dogs

who run howling to their hemes.

We live miies from a forest

or see.

The dogs in this neighborhood
wear sweaters.

Nothing, is wild in this place
long subdued by the leash

and the blade,

 

l gesture at the window
beckoning to the deer

now thrashing at Windshields
and bicycles.

But What would I do

if he came. to me,

this animal tangled in my house?
How could i calm a creature,

lost as i am

in some suburb far from home?

THE PRISONER THINKS OF AN ANALOGY

That possum in Childhood's cove
caught in the beached crab trap --
wandered in to the smell of bait,

old clams, fish heads, chicken backs
finished by minnows, only their essence
of lively death clinging to mesh

inside the main cage
left by departed crabbers
in briars by the shore,

possum huddled inside, clinging
to airy hexagons of. chickenwire,
rubbery tail dangling through,

unable to open the latch
or turn back through the no~exit
throats of the trap,

no food but the blackberry tendril
too young for fruit, aggressively
circling the cage in how many days,

hard to tell how long he'd been in,
passage of time counted out
in feces dropped through airy hexagons,

feeble, yet teeth and claws

stayed sharp, and Father was careful when
he unhooked the top and let him out.

A POEM FOR TRAPPED THINGS

This morning with a blue flame burning

this thing wings its way in.

Wind shakes the edges of its yellow being.
Casping for breath.

Living for the instant

Climbing up the black border of the window.
Why do you want out.

I sit in pain

A, red robe amid debris,

You bend and climb, extending antennae.

I know the butterﬂy is my soul
and weak from battle.

A giant fan on the back of

a beetle.
A caterpillar, Chrysalis that seeks
a new home apart from this room.

And will disappear from sight

at the pulling of invisible strings.

Yet so tenuous, so ﬁne

this thing is, I am

sitting on the hard bed, we could

vanish from sight like the puff

off an invisible cigarette.

F urred chest, ragged silk under
wings beating against the glass

no one will open.

The blue diamonds on your back
are too beautiful to do
away with.
I watch you
all morning
long
With my hand over my month.

The iron drives this bay mare

crazy from chute 8, rowels zinging
like thumbnail-size flies

in fever heat, that sudden bite

and ring behind her ears

again and again, spurring every Jump
and kick. She buries her head

blind between her knees,

hits the fence head-on,

wire mesh heaving. Her neck

snaps above the withers

where the rider feels life go

in one quick explosion of dust.

Mesh collapses like lung wall

on that last long breath. She tumbles
and shakes, the grandstand
stone-still, the cowboy pinned,

his face to her muzzle-~hard

grimace to petrified stars.

And through that deep purple spectrum
end of pain, her nostrils

blossom pink and renegade

as wild rose, a single

springtime applause

in a graveyard of rimrock.

I‘ clench his feathered legs together
like a jilted suitor clings

to a limp bouquet. All his love
nocturnal, in a nightmareless life,
he could not foresee, even with ball-
turret vision, the existence of so much
sterile light and steel: this Great
Gray Owl in shock, deflated,

on a veterinarian table, one wing-
bone, jagged as glass pipette,

broken in two.

 
   
 
 
 
 
   
   
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
  
  

His eyes, dull bulbs
to the brilliance of this room,
beam nothing of his ominous lore,

. his fury at our pluck and probe. Humiliation
quells his outrage for mangled plumes
preened quill by quill
to perfection, each barbule‘
softly muffling the owl's swoop--this ruffled
breadth of feathers that hid his frailness
for so little flesh.

The vet threads
metal pins into the shattered
air-as-marrow miracle, little hope
hollow bone will knit at all, let alone
knit with struts enough for flight. The owl,
exposed and marred, wilted
by so much light, leaves his body
to our last-ditch, taxidermic bid
for immortality. We'll never know
what secret love, what spirit locked within
quill and bone, kept this bird
eternally in blossom--crest feathers
petaled like phlox, ten thousand wings
soaring gorgeous for the dark.

GRINDABOD

In the democratic Faroes

husbands fish, wives shop, and kids
watch TV as a telephone rings.

Across the island, action stops.

Radios then blare location of returning
pilot whales, heating the rush to shore
for best seats at the grindabod.
Waterspouts, fins and masts

appear on the horizon, spurring men and
boys to sheath knives and hooks,

to jump rowboats for a line of

revving engines, shouts and fired stones
halting the approach of mystery,

200 whales hounded into panic and confusion,
into inlets like Hitlerian ovens.
Trapped, harpooned and gushing,

whales are left to swim courageously

in defense of stricken kin, their screams
echoing through the bay, drowning cheers
and shouts of spectators,

red excitement of old amphitheaters.
Grappled to shore, stabbed and sliced,
the whales shed bloody tears,

tradition out of synch with

time and need. A roundfaced boy

walks slowly toward his parents' car
clutching at a whale toy

hacked out of its mother's womb.

THE POLAR BEAR AT CRANDON PARK zoo, MIAMI

Panting, immobile, his head lies flat

in fly-buzzing shade, his brown eyes

shut against the glare. Before him,

pelicans and flamingoes strut brown and pink,
peck shells. Small children suck fingers,
watch him roll. His nose glistens.

His stink, his feces that were meant

to sink in snow, draws generations

of flies. One boy holds his nose.

The bear rises, swings his hulk

around to see the growing crowd,

cool in dacron. Concrete burns his pads.

His small eyes burn like brown suns.

From the ocean a quarter mile away

he smells the cool of salt, the thread

that holds him through the long, lizard days.

REQUIEM FOR A RAGING HOUND

The child tapping each day
upon the window pane
asks when Prince will return;

wonders why the family
.wanting the hound so much.
hauled it back to the pound

 

as if they did not know

of sodium pentobarbitol:
legs buckling before

the needle is withdrawn,
limp body hurled back upon
a rolling rack.

Unlike the pensioner upstairs
splashing through glass to escape

the dullness of each day

’or the grandmother who lost her voice
only her eyes could deflect

the momentum of night

with teeth bared, the hound died
snarling at those who came

to muzzle the fierce light
between its eyes.
