REQUIEM FOR A RAGING HOUND

The child tapping each day
upon the window pane
asks when Prince will return;

wonders why the family
.wanting the hound so much_
hauled it back to the pound

 

as if they did not know

of sodium pentobarbitol:
legs buckling before

the needle is withdrawn,
limp body hurled back upon
a rolling rack.

Unlike the pensioner upstairs
splashing through glass to escape

the dullness of each day

'or the grandmother who lost her voice
only her eyes could deflect

the momentum of night

with teeth bared, the hound died
snarling at those who came

to muzzle the fierce light
between its eyes.

Frieda Singer

 




At the Reelfoot Slaughter House

The tin walls are suddenly around you
_Rising to meet roof beams
At angles that cut and slice

This slant of light

Breaking from their imperfect union.

You are below

Imagining your own white bones and
Pale blue ligaments stretched
Across alabaster ball and socket
In perfect alignment

For the walking

That carries you now

Along the sawdust rows

Between the busy stations

The pools glimmering at your feet
Each step a mesh of frantic piss and sweat

Rising to cuff your ankles.

No need to be afraid
The only sound you hear is food

(no stanza break)

 




But you move too swiftly in any case
A slightly awkward lumber

Until at the flung-back double doors

The moans are finally behind you

Rising in the steam of hair

In that other, twilight land

Dark except for thin blades of light
Cutting from roof to floor

Touching the back of your neck so gently
Like a hand beneath a collar

Tucking a wisp of hair.

Down a dirt road

Lined with pines old as bones

A baby walls in its mother’s arms

Safe and secure from all this alarm

And you think of the silly Virginia woolf
Afraid to let the food touch her lips
Letting her body gnaw itself

You know we must eat

To raise our bulk above the ground.

And so you watch

The dazed bulls in unison led
Down the ramp

By the smell of their own kind

(no stanza break)

 




  

Emerging so neatly wrapped and stamped
In pink and white, thigh and rump
Arrayed side by side

In perfect crimson rows

Along a stainless isle

0f casual and dawdling customers
who reach nonchalantly for this life
weighing once, then twice its heft
You’re safe at last

In this blaze of meat

Choosing to be diminished

By what you eat.

Deer's Death

The springtime long dead
desirous to arise
in resinous white flower

deer trails straggle over hillsides
fragrant with kit-kit—dizze

down escarpements they run

down ravines '

through miniature red forests of manzanita
losing themselves in the shade

of yellow pine along the Tuolumne

just there a wounded deer has eluded
the dogs of his tormentors
has come to slake intolerable thirsts

beside the blasted twisted hulk

of an ancient pine

lying half ashore

hags hands shot skyward from the water

he has used a forked branch for support
his blood free—flowing with current

and with neck outstretched

the light left him

left him standing in a holy place
where fly blown desire

leans in the shallows

where water and blood conmingled
flow down to sea

and the heart of the earth keeps turning
beating

and the sun's blood runs chill

lightly covering the trees

-Daniel

Donkeys

They are not silent like workhorses

Who are happy or indifferent about the plow and wagon;
Donkeys don’t submit like that

For they are sensitive

And cry continually tinder their burdens;

Yes, they are animals of sensibility

liven if they aren’t intelligent enough

To count money or discuss religion.

Laugh if you will when they heehaw

But know that they are crying

When they make that noise that sounds like something
Between a squawking water pump and a foghorn.

And when I hear them sobbing

V I suddenly notice their sweet eyes and ridiculous ears

And their naive bodies that look as though they never grew up
But stayed children, as in fact they are;

And being misunderstood as children are

They are forced to walk up mountains

With men and bundles on their backs.

Somehow I am glad that they do not submit without a protest
But as their masters are of the deafest
The wails are never heard.

I am sure that donkeys know what life should be
But, alas, they do not own their bodies;

And if they had their own way, I am sure

That they would sit in a ﬁeld of flowers

Kissing each other, and maybe

They would even invite us to join them.

 




For they never let us forget that they know

(As everyone knows who stays as sweet as children)
That there is a far better way to spend time;

You can be sure of that when they stop in their tracks

And honk and honk and honk.

And if I tried to explain to them

Why work is not only necessary but good,
I am afraid that they would never understand
And kick me with their back legs

As commentary on my wisdom.

So they remain unhappy and sob .
And their masters who are equally convinced of being right
Beat them and hear nothing.

 




LINCOLN PARK ZOO

Viewed from the ramp, these spacious cliffs
and generous feast of water offer
Arctic nirvana. Off in a corner
the solitary polar bear
is making a sort of backward somersault
in ice-green sheets of spray.
Below,

through plate glass observation ports
one sees how he does it. Again!
Again, that tumbling circle! The amazing
bulk of him sailing by in a mantle
of bubbles, the huge paws thrusting off.
The ecstasy of his creamy fur
as it billows past, revealing at belly's
root the neat rosette of his sex.
The priestly head is bowed in'a nimbus
of foam. Eyes shut, he does not notice
us. Children, awestruck, then bored
begin to bang on the glass. The parents'
cameras dangle: there's nothing here
for a snapshot. Nothing to watch except
compulsion's endless arc.

They leave.
The acrobat goes on with his ritual.
working to get it right? Each turning
your try for the perfect dive? Or have you
become a prayer—wheel, repeating
some mantra ice floes chant
into the polar darkness? There is no
ice here in your private ocean.
They gave you artful rocks, azure
lagoon, a black.hatchway that leads
indoors.

All night, I hold against my body

the curve of your body’s journey.

THE BUFFALO HERD AI THE ONONDAGA INDIAN RESERVATION

 

High among the line of hills

which the Holder Up of the Heavens

dropped long ago to destroy the Stone Giants
a meadow opens, wide and green.

There new posts of poplar and thick wire
protect the herd, dark shapes of power,
keeping them in, keeping out the guns
and narrow anger of those who envy

those few acres left the Onondagas.‘

In that May meadow Indian boys

pick milkweed greens and pull the burrs

from the thick coats of grazing animals.
They relearn the old songs of Buffalo People
from the drumbeat of hooves on earth.

You walk with slow steps, the open sky
above you a face, so large you can't see
its features, only know in your heart
that it observes all you are, all you do

as the Buffalo walk on this land again,
brought back once more to remind the people
of an older balance, a promise of peace

we humans still must learn to keep.

" '«'“ ‘ "‘r' -'-NNM' .

Essay

So many poems about the deaths of animals.

' Wilbur's toad, Kinnell's porcupine, Eberhart's squirrel,

and that poem by someone—Hecht? Merrill?—
about cremating a woodchuck. But mostly

I remember the outrageous number of them,

as if every poet, I too, had written at least

one animal elegy; with the result that today

when I came to a good enough poem by Edwin Brock
about ﬁnding a dead fox at the edge of the sea

I could not respond: as if permanent shock

had deadened me. And then after a moment

I began to give way to sorrow (watching myself
sorrowlessly the while), not merely because

part of my being had been violated and annulled,
but because all these many poems over the years
have been necessary,—suitable and correct. This
has been the time of the ﬁnishing off of the animals.
They are going away—their fur and their wild eyes,
their voices. Deer leap and leap in front

of the screaming snowmobiles until they leap

out of existence. Hawks circle once or twice

around their shattered nests and then they climb

to the stars. I have lived with them ﬁfty years,

we have lived with them ﬁlty million years,

and now they are going, almost gone. I don't know
if the animals are capable of reproach.

But clearly they do not bother to say good-bye.

Monkeys

Two little creatures
With faces the size of
A pair of pennies

Are ClaSping each other.
"Ah, do not leave me,"
One says to the Other,
In the high monkey-
Cage in the beast-shop.

There are no people to gape at them now,
For people are loth to

Peer in the tlimness;

Have they not builtletl

Streets and playhouses,

Sky-signs and bars,

To lose the loneliness

Shaking the hearts

Of the two little Monkeys?

Yes. But who watches
The penny—small faces
Can hear the voices:

"Ah, do not leave me;

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Suck I will give you,
Warmth and clasping,
And if you slip from
This beam I can never
Find you again."

Dim is the evening,

And chill is the weather;
There, drawn from their colored
Hemisphere,

The apes lilliputian

With faces the size of

A pair of pennies,

And voices as low as

The flow of my blood.

THE HARVEST

\

--.Immersed . . .
tangled brush of
a slash slope
Gathering serviceberries,
cool mountain dampness
of day's end
Pretending to be a bear
(brown wool sweater!) . . .

How would it feel to be shot there,
fist full of plump purple berries,
mouth full of sweetness?

Crumpled suddenly into the bush,
staring through blurred branches

into approaching night;

bewildered, hearing voices and footfalls
crashing through the thicket;

not understanding what a rifle is—
nor this searing, violent death.

Babette Deutsch

His eyes are mournful, but the long lined palm

He thrusts between the bars expects the best.

His old man’s face as innocent as calm,

The beggar puts compassion to the test

And fails. He grips the bars; his pained stare grows
To a brown study framed in dusty fur.

He has a cold. He sneezes, cleans his nose,

Then gravely licks a flexible forefinger.

A pause; the bald mauve hand from which men shrink,
The fingers, strong to clutch, quick to explore,

Again extended, are again refused,

The eyes, poor sorrow’s jewels, seldom wink,

But to his grinning public, as before,

Show endless patience, endlessly abused.

 




Coincidence

The instant the owl flew into the car windshield
my grandfather died. And that was coincidence.

On the same day, a year later, the pipes froze
and the dog died. That too was no more than coincidence. But now
two years later I am sitting in the kitchen alone

and a hunter in a black and red jacket is knocking

on the front door. He wants to hunt

on my land. When I tell him something will die

he says, ”A deer, my friend. Just a deer.“ Crossing the back lawn

he climbs over the stone wall at the wood's edge
and tosses his cigarette into the wind. It is morning. Clouds

are passing and the shots that echo through the valley

are followed by the appropriate cries. The animal
playing it just right is taking long strides into the open field
where she caves in

the chest still pumping blood

the head still pulling as if the legs will follow. And here he comes
to slice her from rectum

to Adam's apple. And the coincidence? The second death?
It has nothing to do
with me. At the window, in my T-shirt,

I am watching his tight fist heave entrails

back at the woods. The woods are a dark green.

We have all had enough.

GRINDABOD

In the democratic Faroes

husbands fish, wives shop, and kids
watch TV as a telephone rings.

Across the island, action stops.

Radios then blare location of returning
pilot whales, heating the rush to shore
for best seats at the grindabod.
Waterspouts, fins and masts

appear on the horizon, spurring men and
boys to sheath knives and hooks,

to jump rowboats for a line of

revving engines, shouts and fired stones
halting the approach of mystery,

200 whales hounded into panic and confusion,
into inlets like Hitlerian ovens.
Trapped, harpooned and gushing,

whales are left to swim courageously

in defense of stricken kin, their screams
echoing through the bay, drowning cheers
and shouts of spectators,

red excitement of old amphitheaters.
Grappled to shore, stabbed and sliced,
the whales shed bloody tears,

tradition out of synch with

time and need. A roundfaced boy

walks slowly toward his parents' car
clutching at a whale toy

hacked out of its mother's womb.

REQUIEM

Old Silverback, guarding the rear,

is first to catch a poacher's bullet.
Mountain gorillas, shaken, flee

their foraging ground in Uganda's
rainforest. Thunder waves against

the upslope clouds as one by one the
family falls, the mother dropping
with an infant clinging tight until
it's ripped away in desire for the
live sale, for the paperweight cast
from a gorilla's hand... lOO remain——
feeding, playing, mating, dying in

a specie's red extermination, severed
from its source in man's prehistory,
from frontiers plundered by hands with
the opposable thumb, the cool resolve.

 




 

The Slaughter-House

Under the big SOO-watted lamps, in the huge sawdusted
government inspected slaughter-house,

head down from hooks and clamps, run on trolleys over
troughs, .

the animals die.

Whatever terror their dull intelligences feel
or what agony distorts their most protruding eyes

the incommunicable narrow skulls conceal.
Across the sawdusted ﬂoor,

ignorant as children, they see the butcher’s slow
methodical approach _

in the bloodied apron, leather cap above, thick square
shoes below, .

struggling to comprehend this unique vision upside down,

and then approximate a human scream -

as from the throat slit like a letter ~ ~
the blood empties, and the windpipe, like a blown valve,
spurts steam. ‘ -

But I, sickened equally with the ox and lamb,
misread my fate, -'
mistake the butcher’s love
who kills me for the meat I am

_.

to feed a hungry multitude beyond the sliding doors.
I, too,‘misjudge the real

purpose of this huge shed I’m herded in: not for my love
or lovely wool am I here,

but to make some world a meal.
See, how on the unsubstantial air

I kick, bleating my private woe,
as upside down my rolling sight '

somesaults, and frantically I try to set my world upright;
too late learning why I’m hung here,

whose nostrils bleed, whose life runs out from eye and ear.

The Elephant

The atrocity

Of the great elephant

In the Milano Zoo: He is
Chained by his leg to the
Floor. His cage is as large

As he is—just a little larger.
He stands there, looking

At adults and children
Pelting him with peanuts and
Garbage, he looks out of his
Tear-shaped eye circled by pink.

I will save you.

His name is Pepsi. He was a gift

From the American Pepsi-Cola Company

To the city of Milano. I wrote

A letter to the company and asked “Do you
Know what agony this elephant suffers? This

Beast which was named after your beverage?"

I received a reply

On heavy stationery from

The head of the company saying

Zoo conditions in Italy can

Not be helped. He said he was

Taking my letter under advisement.
But there was nothing he could do. He

I received, a month later, a letter

From the Italian head of the company.
He told me the elephant, Pepsi, had
Been blessed by a cardinal when he was
Given to the Milano Zoo.

I imagine the

Miserable elephant in captivity.
At night I lie awake

Plotting our escape.

I think of the history of the elephant:
Heroic and courageous beasts
Worshiped in India, thought of as
Holy men in Bangkok, treated with love
Throughout Asia. In my childhood

I saw them wrapped in circus dresses
And made to perform—

Displayed

By managers who found them funny. I
Think of the elephant with a chain
On his leg. I think of his life.

His captivity.

Each night

I prepare our departures.

T/zc Howling of Wolves

Is without world.

What are they dragging up and out on their long leashes of sound
That dissolve in the mid—air silence?

Then crying of a baby, in this forest of starving silences,

Brings the wolves running.

Tuning of a violin, in this forest delicate as an owl’s ear,

Brings the wolves running—brings the steel traps clashing and
slavering,

The steel furred to keep it from cracking in the cold,

The eyes that never learn how it has come about

That they must live like this,

That they must live
Innocence crept into minerals.

The wind sweeps through and the hunched wolf shivers.
It howls you cannot say whether out of agony or joy.

The earth is under its tongue,

A dead weight of darkness, trying to see through its eyes.

The wolf is living for the earth.

But the wolf is small, it comprehends little.

It goes to and fro, trailing its haunches and whimpering horribly.

It must feed its fur.

The night snows stars and the earth creaks.

Song of a Hat

1. The Rat’s Dance

The rat is in the trap, it is in the trap,

And attacking heaven and earth with a mouthful of screeches like torn tin,
An effective gag.

When it stops screeching, it pants

And cannot think
“This has no face, it must be God" or

“No answer is also an answer.”
Iron jaws, strong as the whole earth

Are stealing its backbone
For a crumpling of the Universe with screechings,

For supplanting every human brain inside its skull with a rat-body that
knots and unknots,

A rat that goes on screeching,

Trying to uproot itself into each escaping screech,
But its long fangs bar that exit-—

- The incisors bared to the night spaces, threatening the constellations,
The glitterers in the black, to keep oft,

Keep their distance,
While it works this out.

The rat understands suddenly. It bows and is still,
With a little beseeching of blood on its nose-end.

THE jAGUAR

The apes yawn and adore their ﬂats in the sun.
The parrots shriek as if they were on ﬁre, or strut
Like chap tarts to attract the stroller with the nut.

Fatigued with indolenee, tiger and lion

Lie still as the sun. The boa—constrictor's coil
[3 a fossil. Cage after age seems empty, or
Stinks of sleepers from the breathing straw.
It might be painted on a nursery wall.

But who runs like the rest past these arrives

At a cage where the crowd stands, stares, mesmerized,
As a child at a dream, at ajaguar hurrying enraged
Through prison darkness after the drills of his eyes

On a short ﬁerce fuse. Not in boredom——

The eye satisﬁed to be blind in ﬁre,

By the hang of blood in the brain deaf the car—
He spins from the bars, but there’s no cage to him

More than to the visionary his cell:
His stride is wildernesses of freedom:
The world rolls under the long thrust of his heel.

Over the cage ﬂoor the horizons come.

New Providence Island, Bahamas

Pallid as one fish dying,

the day bloats with heat.

Underneath a lard-white sun

my guide enters a whitewashed building,

strays along walls,

gazes toward a tank of brooding water.

I peer down at sea turtles, filmy green,

adrift in a squat sea.

Excrement bobs in the tank like kelp.

In a dark nook at the rear of the market

two men play a game with plum seed dice,

while one man, back of a snailtrack of dirt,

leans on a broom.

Nearby, the guide extends a blue, enamel basin,
chipped, heavy with its pale strips of sweet, wet meat.
But I see and have seen simply two enormous turtles.

A restaurant has ordered them,

two which awhile ago were wrestled from the tank,
hurled out into the stark, dusty universe of this floor,
now in immense exhaustion, -

heaving, stifling, drowning in air:

dark, salt-caked eyes, profoundly old, straining like the sea,
jaws, horny and toothless, giving off gasp and suck,
faded yellow bony shells upturned

and, where spiked, blackened by a fist of flies,
leathery limbs extending in a desperate, slow shiver.

The hands of an overhead fan revolve like a clock.
Weak, I lean toward light and shadow
struggling at the door.

Now an iodine sun,

dark blood clabbered on the gills of fish-colored sky.
I lurch in a crowd.

The tourists are taking pictures of passion fruit.

In my ear, far off, I hear the rush and hum of fluids,
pulse of currents.

I feel, far in, a deep sea floor upon which something is asway.
Its form (delicate as the roar of a seashell)

dilates like a membranous sac, pitches,

tosses on a fibrous stalk,

labors in distended blackness.

Something wduld come forth, would make a gesture strange
and green as motions of a seaweed hand.

Something human would emerge from original silence

and speak with the clarity of water,

would grope toward birth,

would, into stark, bright air, astonished, rise.

The wharf is slippery with the eyes of bonefish.

The Bull Calf

The thing could barely stand. Yet taken

from his mother and the barn smells

he still impressed with his pride,

with the promise of sovereignty in the way

his head moved to take us in.

The ﬁerce sunlight tugging the maize from the ground
licked at his shapely ﬂanks.

He was too young for all that pride.

I thought of the deposed Richard II.

"No money in bull calves,” Freeman had said.
The visiting clergyman rubbed the nostrils
now snul'ling pathetically at the windless day.

"A pity,” he sighed.

 




My gaze slipped off his hat toward the empty sky
that circled over the black knot of men,
over us and the calf waiting for the first blow.

Struck, -

the bull calf drew in his thin forelegs

as if gathering strength for a mad rush . . .

tottered . . .1 raised his darkening eyes to us,

and I saw we were at the far end

of his frightened look, growing smaller and smaller
till we were only the ponderous mallet

that ﬂicked his bleeding ear

and pushed him over on his side, stiflly,

like a block of wood.

Below the hill's crest

the river snuflled on the improvised beach.

We dug a deep pit and threw the dead calf into it.
It made a wet sound, a sepulchral gurgle,

as the warm sides bulged and flattened.

Settled, the bull calf lay as if asleep,

one foreleg over the other,

bereft of pride and so beautiful now,

without movement, perfectly still in the cool pit,

I turned away and wept.

GRACE TO BE SAID AT THE SUPERMARKET

That God of ours, the Great Geometer

Does something for us here, where he has put

(If you want to put it that way) things in shape,
Compressing the little lambs in orderly cubes,
Making the roast a decent cylinder,

Fairing the tin, elipsoid of a ham,

Getting the luncheon meat anonymous,

In squares and oblongs with the edges beveled

Or rounded (streamlined maybe, for greater speed).

Praise him, he has conferred aesthetic distance
Upon our appetites, and on the bloody a.

Mess of our birthright, our unseemly need,
Imposed significant form. Through him the brutes
Enter the pure Euclidean kingdom of numbers.
Free of their bulging and blood-swollen lives
They come to us holy, in celophane
Transparencies, in the mystical body,

That we may look unflinchingly on death
As the greatest good, like the philosopher should.

Paradise Key

Wedged in a small tank of water

at the roadside 200, a fivevfoot alligator
curves like a busted tire, in so tight

his mouth goes up one hot metal side,
his tail up the other. His eyes open
straight into mine. I am nine.

1 can see how bad it feels.

My parents know it’s wrong. Silent,
embarrassed, we all stand there till

Dad politely questions the ticket—man:
"Isn't that tank too small?”

"Nah,” says the gashand who doubles
as zookeeper, ”he likes it that way.”
We climb back into our car and drive away.

Now in the Everglades, the place they call
Paradise Key, a little gator surprises me

as he steps out of the sawgrass

six feet away. He crosses my path,

dragging a few reeds over to the pool

where bluegill swim. He means to go fishing.
Something sly and cheerful bubbles

in his glance, and in me, watching him
watching me from the water. He has his life.
He has plans! That’s what his eyes say.

And suddenly I want to bless the tribe

of alligators and the beauty of horned

and glistening skin. I see the primeval
symmetry of reptiles floating with their prey
in the Everglades. May they go free

of all I know about the tribe of man.

THE PRISONER THINKS OF AN ANALOGY

That possum in Childhood's cove
caught in the beached crab trap --
wandered in to the smell of bait,

old clams, fish heads, chicken backs
finished by minnows, only their essence
of lively death clinging to mesh

inside the main cage
left by departed crabbers
in briars by the shore,

possum huddled inside, clinging
to airy hexagons of chickenwire,
rubbery tail dangling through,

unable to open the latch
or turn back through the no-exit
throats of the trap,

no food but the blackberry tendril
too young for fruit, aggressively
circling the cage in how many days,

hard to tell how long he'd been in,
passage of time counted out
in feces dropped through airy hexagons,

feeble, yet teeth and claws
stayed sharp, and Father was careful when
he unhooked the top and let him out.

Elisavietta Ritchie

 




The iron drives this bay mare

crazy from chute 8, rowels zinging
like thumbnail-size flies

in fever heat, that sudden bite

and ring behind her ears

again and again, spurring every Jump
and kick. She buries her head

blind between her knees,

hits the fence head-on,

wire mesh heaving. Her neck

snaps above the withers

where the rider feels life go

in one quick explosion of dust.

Mesh collapses like lung wall

on that last long breath. She tumbles
and shakes, the grandstand
stone—still, the cowboy pinned,

his face to her muzzle——hard

grimace to petrified stars.

And through that deep purple spectrum
end of pain, her nostrils

blossom pink and renegade

as wild rose, a single

springtime applause

in a graveyard of rimrock.
