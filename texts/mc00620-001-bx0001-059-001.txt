”KINDNESS-V TO ANIMALS
by LOUISE HAMPTON.

l. A very good reason for being
kind to animals is that an easy con~
science is more comfortable to live
with than an uneasy one. ' As
Browning put it: — It s wiser being
good than bad, its safer being meek
than fierce, it s fitter being sane than
mad.”

2. It is only by fair dealing that
we are able to look our fellow
humans squarely in the face. By that
same token, if you are not guilty of
eating them and wearing their coats
and plumage, you are able to meet
your little furred and feathered
friends without fear on your part,
and without reproach on theirs.

3. If we wish to be regarded as
honest, we should refrain from say-
ing so frequently, ” I couldn’t be un—
kind to a poor dumb creature,” and
then paying to see them as prisoners
behind bars in a zoo, or performing
unnatural tricks on a stage or in a
circus. .

4. It is only by continuous fighting
against cruelty that we can repay in
some small measure the love, devo—
. tion, protection and faithful service
which they so freely give us.

5. It is up to us to prove our
boast that we are mentally the high-
est form of life, by using our intelli~
gence to help our weaker brothers
and sisters of the great animal king~
dom, always remembering the great
promise, “ Blessed are the merciful,
for they shall receive mercy.”
