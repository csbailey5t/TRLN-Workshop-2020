I hack

a ravine in his thigh, and eat and drink,
and tear him down his whole length

and open him and climb in

and close him up after me, against the wind,
and sleep.

5

And dream

of lumbering flatfooted

over the tundra”

stabbed twice from within,

splattering a trail behind me,

splattering it out no matter which way I lurch,
no matter which parabola of bear-transcendence,
which dance_of solitude I attempt,

which gravity-clutched leap,

which trudge, which groan.

6

Until one day I totter and fall -

fall on this -

stomach that has tried so hard to keep up,

to digest the blood as it leaked in,

to break up ‘

and digest the bone itself: and now the breeze
blows over me, blows off '
the hideous belches of ill-digested bear blood
and rotted stomach

and-the ordinary,wretched odor of bear,

blows across

my sore, lolled tongue a song _

or screech, until I think I must rise up
and dance. And I lie still. ' ‘

7 .

I awaken I think. Marshlights

reappear, geese -

come trailing again up the flyway.

In her ravine under old snow the dam-bear

lies, licking

lumps of smeared fur

and drizzly eyes into shapes

with her tongue. And_one

hairy-soled trudge stuCk out before me,

the next groaned out, ‘

the next,

the next, ‘

the rest of my days I Spend

wandering: wonderin

What, anyway, “

was that sticky infusion, that rank flavor of blood
that poetry, h by which I lived?

THE INTRUDER

My mother—preferring the strange to the tame:
Dove-note, bone marrow, deer dung,
Frog’s belly distended with tinny young,
Leaf-mould wilderness, hare-bell, toadstool,
Odd, small snakes roving through the leaves,
Metallic beetles rambling over stones: all
Wild and naturall—flashedout her instinctive love,
and quick, she
Picked up the ﬂuttering, bleeding bat the cat laid at her feet,
And held the little horror to the mirror, where .
He gazed on himself, and shrieked like an old screen door
far off.

Depended from her pinched thumb, each wing

Came clattering down like a small black shutter.

Still tranquil, she began, “It’s rather sweet. . . .”

The soft mouse body, the hard feral glint

In the caught eyes. Then we saw,

And recoiled: lice, pallid, yellow,

Nested within the wing-pits, cosily sucked and snoozed.

The thing dropped from her hands, and with its thud,

Swiftly, the cat, with a clean careful mouth

Closed on the soiled webs, growling, took them out
to the back stoop.

But still, dark blood, a sticky puddle on the floor
Remained, of all my mother’s tender, wounding passion
For a whole wild, lost, betrayed and secret life

1

Among its dens and burrows, its clean stones,
Whose denizens can turn upon the world

With spitting tongue, an odor, talon, claw,

To sting or soil benevolence, alien

As our clumsy traps, our random scatter of shot.
She swept to the kitchen. Turning on the tap,
She washed and washed the pity from her hands.

Slugs

Always the last guests

at the banquet, arriving .

from old cisterns and plant-heaps

long after dark,

you mark your trails

neatly, wandering laces of slime

of interest to crickets and house cats.

I watch you, the greatest four inches long,
tigered like flatworms or pike,

nose the round bits of potato

into evening's senescence.

I admire your delicate eyestalks,

the fluid contentment of your bodies,
the ways you go back where you came from
saying nothing, gleaming‘

and muscular as silence.

RICHARD HAGUE

 




Feeding Time, Arbor Farm

In this the quietest place
Frogs stroke love songs at dusk,
The hen soft chucks, the dog
Rustles his bed in turns,

“The churn of teeth on corn,
The bay settles to her grain,
The cat black against rafters
Stalks swallows in sw00ps,
Night air buzzes and breathes
Its soft muzzle close against
My chest, my neck, my ear.

SUSAN HALLGARTH

 




Post Partu in

He is two and mine, and 1 his.

Together we turn an old patch of earth
to new lettuce: I by spade and blister,
he by delicate converse of ants and worms.

"Dear little worm,
you are good.
You eat dirt."

Thus I have taught him and he me:

he whose new hands bruise old things,
I whose old dread is serpents. Must he
make me rest it on a naked finger?

”Dear little worm,
I put you back

in the ground again."

Lois Marie Harrod

 




THE ONLY COWS LEFT IN PISCATAWAY

The only cows left in Piscataway
chew grass by the split-rail fence,
and fix their mild eyes on the horizon

where petroleum tanks squat.

The only cows left in Piscataway
breathe black smoke

settling on the pasture

like fog on'a gray morning,

hang their heads over the fence

‘and fix mild eyes on trucks

spewing their way uphill.

The only cows left in Piscataway
eat grass in a field fertilized
by exhaust, and the farmer

wipes soot from their faces

before he milks them.

 




 

 

 

 

DOG TlED TO A TREE
Gay/e Elen Harvey

hunting deer, you find him frozen,

curled beneath a tree where last night’s snow

has blazed a rough trail

through that useless fur,

where one of your own kind has left him.

you kneel, wondering how long he barked and whined
and waited for food, for someone he loved

to whistle him home.

there’s no reason to, but you untie him,

stroke his muzzle.

rising, you try to read the late sky

for tomorrow’s weather.

clouds are floating overhead like small, dark targets.
the moon drifts downwind, wearing a halo,

3 frayed, blue collar of ice.

Journey to Alaska, page 3

.3. The Beaver

Giant teeth! Exquisite shining

great white squares

I carve in the oval-shaped mouth of the beaver.
The beaver's paws are folded in front of him
his giant tail

held close to his solid body.

Despite the gargantuan teeth

It will be obvious to anyone who cares to look
that it is a smile

not a growl

that the beaver profers.

The paws press a tree lovingly

to the brown breast

and a spirit face smiles out

from just above the heart.

The beaver's eyes flash a knowing look:
we all share these trees

all love the trees

need them

they are part of us

and we flow from them.

 




WITNESS

We'd walked into the small warm shed

where spring lambs lay in straw

in the halt-dark still smelling of their birth,

of ammonia, the damp grass, dung, .

into this world in the middle of a field

where lambs bleating soft songs lifted

their too-heavy heads toward their mothers,

gentle presences within their wool clouds.

Later, outside, as I watched,

Wenzel wrapped his left arm around a sheep’s neck
and struck her with the sledge in his right hand.
The. dying sheep, her forehead crushed, cried out,
past pain, for her mortal life. Blood flowed

from her burst skull, over her eyes, her black nose.
Wenzcl dropped her to the grass.

When I ran home, I struck my head

on a blossoming apple-bough.

Where was the dead sheep?

What (lid I hear?

Where is the witness now?

I was nine or ten.

ller cry was terror,

so I lay awake to hear her,

to wonder why she didn’t seem to know
her next manger, her golden ﬁelds.

ller odors drifted through my screen ——
the hay at the roots of her wool,

her urine, the wet graindust under her chin,
her birth fluids hot and flecked with blood.
I could hear her bleat

to her last lamb, hear her heartbeat

in the black air of my room.

Where was the dead sheep?

Why did she cry for her loss?

Where is the. witness now?

 




Not to accept, but to awaken.

Not to understand, to cry terror, but to know

that even a billon years later, now,

we breathe the ﬁrst circle of light,

and the light curves into us, into the deer’s back,

the man’s neck, the woman’s thigh,

the cat’s mouse-mossed tongue, all the ruby

berries ripening in evening air.

The dead elms and chestnuts are of it, and do not
break the curve. The jeweled flies sip it,

and do not break the curve.

Our homes inhabit, and ride the curve.

The mountains, its children, do not break the curve.
Our moon, our rivers, the furthest stars blinking blue,
the great named and nameless comets do not break the curve.
The odorous apple-blossom rain does not break the curve.
The struck ewe’s broken brainpan does not break the curve.
Wenzel nor this witness breaks the curve.

In the shed’s dusk where spring lambs

sang to their mothers, in my dark room

where the dead ewe’s odors drifted my sleep,

and now, within these cells where her forehead blood

flows once more into recollection,

the light curves. You and I bear witness, and know this,
and as we do the light curves into this knowledge.

The struck ewe lives in this light,

in this curve of the only unbroken light.

WILLIAM HEYEN

 




A REASON To PREFER THE COMPANY OF
BOXELDER BUGS, AND GREET THEIR RETURN

BILL HOLM

WITH PRAISE
After the killing lrost,

boxelder bugs return,

regular as religion,

into curtains, coffee, sunlight,
minding their business
without comment.

Maybe they are in charge

of counting leaves blowing
past the south window.

I won’t ask; they

won’t tell; the old fellowship
blossoms between us.

 




 

{/EXEiE

Big wings dawns dark.
The Sun is hunting.

Thunder collects, under granite eyebrows.

The horizons are ravenous.
The dark mountain has an electric eye.
The sun lowers its meat-hook.

His spread ﬁngers measure a heaven, then a heaven.
His ancestors worship only him,
And his children’s children cry to him alone.

His trapeze is a continent.
The Sun is looking for fuel
With the gaze of a guillotine.

And already the White Hare crouches at the sacriﬁce,
Already the Fawn stumbles to offer itself up

And the Wolf-Cub weeps to be chosen.

The huddle-shawled lightning-faced warrior
Stamps his shaggy-trousered dance
On an altar of blood.

FEBRUARY

i
The wolf with its belly stitched full of big pebbles;
Nibelung wolves barbed like black pineforest
Against a red sky, over blue snow; or that long grin
Above the tucked coverlet—none suﬂice.

A photograph: the hairless, knuckled feet

Of the last wolf killed in Britain spoiled him for wolves:

The worst since has been so much mere Alsatian.
Now it is the dream cries “Wolf!” where these feet

Print the moonlit doorstep, or run and run
Through the hush of parkland, bodiless, headless;
With small seeming of inconvenience

By day, too, pursue, siege all thought;

Bring him to an abrupt poring stop

Over engravings of gibbet-hung wolves,

As at a cage where the scraggy Spanish wolf
Danced, smiling, brown eyes doggily begging

A.ball to be thrown. These feet, deprived,
Disdaining all that are caged, or storied, or pictured,
Through and throughout the true world search

For their vanished head, for the world

 

Vanished with the head, the teeth, the quick eyes
Now, lest they choose his head,

Under severe moons he sits making

Wolf-masks, mouths clamped well onto the world.

ESTHER’S TOMCAT

Daylong this tomcat lies stretched ﬂat

As an old rough mat, no mouth and no eyes.
Continual wars and wives are what

Have tattered his ears and battered his head.

Like a bundle of old rope and iron
Sleeps till blue dusk. Then reappear
His eyes, green as ringstones: he yawns wide red,

Fangs ﬁne as a lady’s needle and bright.

A tomcat sprang at a mounted knight,
Locked round his neck like a trap of hooks

While the knight rode ﬁghting its clawing and bite.

After hundreds of years the stain’s there

On the stone where he fell, dead of the tom:
That was at Barnborough. The tomcat still
Grallochs odd dogs on the quiet,

Will take the head clean oﬂ~ your simple puller,

Is unkillable. From the dog’s fury,
From gunshot ﬁred point-blank he brings
His skin whole, and whole

From owlish moons of bekittenings

Among ashcans. He leaps and lightly
Walks upon sleep, his mind on the moon.
Nightly over the round world of men,
Over the roofs go his eyes and outcry.

VIEW OF A PIG

The pig lay on a barrow dead.

It weighed, they said, as much as three men.
Its eyes closed, pink white eyelashes.

Its trotters stuck straight out.

Such weight and thick pink bulk
Set in death seemed not just dead.
It was less than lifeless, further off.
It was like a sack of wheat.

I thumped it without feeling remorse.
One feels guilty insulting the dead,
Walking on graves. But this pig

Did not seem able to accuse.

It was too dead. Just so much

A poundage of lard and pork.

Its last dignity had entirely gone.
It was not a ﬁgure of fun.

Too dead now to pity.

To remember its life, din, stronghold
Of earthly pleasure as it had been,
Seemed a false effort, and off the point.

Too deadly factual. Its weight
Oppressed me—how could it be moved?
And the trouble of cutting it up!

The gash in its throat was shocking, but not pathetic.

40

Once I ran at a fair in the noise

To catch a greased piglet

That was faster and nimbler than a cat,
Its squeal was the rending of metal.

Pigs must have hot blood, they feel like ovens.
Their bite is worse than a horse’s—

They chop a half-moon clean out.

They eat Cinders, dead cats.

Distinctions and admirations such

As this one was long ﬁnished with.

I stared at it a long time. They were going to scald it,
Scald it and scour it like a doorstep.

T he Chipmuffkis Day

In and out the bushes, up the ivy,

Into the hole

By the old oak stump, the chipmunk ﬂashes.
Up the pole

To the feeder full of seeds he dashes,
Stuffs his cheeks,

The Chickadee and titmouse scold him.
Down he streaks.

Red as the leaves the wind blows off the maple,
Red as a fox,

Striped like a skunk, the chipmunk whistles
Past the love seat, past the mailbox,

Down the path,

Home to his warm hole stuffed with sweet
Things to eat.

Neat and slight and shining, his front feet

Curled at his breast, he sits there while the sun
Stripes the red west

\Vith its last light: the chipmunk

Dives to his rest.

RANDALL JARRELL

 




It sat on my tongue all day, the silence of the animals:
I wondered how I'd manage,

how shop, how smile, how manage this thing called living.
If I turned my head I heard them and became unfit.

It sat on my tongue all day, to mock

that phrase of accomplishment, 'the quality of life.‘
It sat on my tongue all day, to cry out

'Take away our hearts of stone.‘

lt sat on my tongue all day, like Isaiah's coal—~-the question:

What was the name of the doctor,

his assistant, assistants, his nurses?

It sat on my tongue all day to ask a neighbor,
"Do you know about this—-—can you believe this?"

It sat on my tongue all day to write the newspapers
and tell them:

tear down the laboratories
burn them

bu rn them

It sat on my tongue all day

by night I managed better

JOHN wooos

To the Chairperson of the Sonnets

In my Newtonian youth, love songs
hung sweet spittle from my chin.
The green world drew up

into two vast prominences:

man woman man woman

plus and minusing in my bonehead math.
Why the scoutleader left town

in the middle of the night A

was as arcane to me

as the luminosity behind

the Horsehead Nebula.

The world stripped down

to its ﬁnal face, and fire leaped
between cathode and anode,

groin hair swirled, iron filings
around magnetic flow.

Later, in my Einsteinian days,

someone wore my bluejeans on the town.
Lambency haloed the jockstraps
. in the dark lockers.

Lines turned in certain poems
and showed their bottoms.
Space was dense with Pulsars,
quasars, lefthanded mesons,

the ‘strange’ particles.

I had to look twice

at whatever I held in my hand.

Dear Chairperson of the Sonnets,

were you, or where were you, bearded?
Where do you lay your sleeping head, my love
at which end of the spectrum?

For the Lost Generation

Oddities composed the sum of the news.
E = mc2 .

Was another weird

Sign of the existence of thejews.

And Paris! All afternoon in someone’s attic
We lifted our glasses

And drank to the asses

Who ran the world and turned neurotic.

Ours was a wonderful party,

Everyone threw rice,

The fattest girls were nice,

The world was rich in wisecracks and confetti.

The War was a first wife, somebody's blunder.
Who was right, who lost,

Held nobody’s interest,

The dog on top was as bad as the dog under.

Sometimes after whiskey, at the break ofday,
There was a trace

Of puzzlement on a face,

Face of blue nights that kept bleaching away.

Look back on it all - the faraway cost,
Crash and sweet blues
(0 Hiroshima, Ojews) -

No generation was so gay as the lost.

Saint Francis and the Sow

The bud

stands for all things,

even for those things that don’t ﬂower,

for everything ﬂowers, from within, of self-blessing;

though sometimes it is necessary

to retmch a thing its loveliness,

to put a hand on its brow

of the ﬂower

and retell it in words and in touch

it is lovely

until it ﬂowers again from within, of self-blessing;

as Saint Francis

put his hand on the creased forehead

of the sow, and told her in words and in touch

blessings of earth on the sow, and the sow

began remembering all down her thick length,

from the earthen snout all the way

through the fodder and slops to the spiritual curl of the tail,

from the hard Spininess spiked out from the spine

down throng 1 the great broken heart

to the sheer blue niilken dreaminess Spurting and shuddering

from the fourteen teats into the fourteen mouths suclzing and
blowing beneath them:

the long. perfect loveliness of sow.

The Bear ‘ a 4 (00,2

1

In'lete winter

I sometimes glimpse bits of steam

coming up from

some fault in the old snow

and bend close and see it is lung-coloreE
and put down my nose .

and know

the chilly, enduring odor of bear._

2 . .
I take a wolf's rib and whittle

'it sharp at both ends

and coil it up

and freeze it in blubber and place it out
on the fairway of the bears.

And when it has vanished

I move out on the bear tracks,

roaming in circles

until I come to the first, tentative, dark
Splash on the earth.

And III. I set out

running, following the splashes

of blood wandering over the world.‘

At the cut, gashed resting places

I stop and rest,

at the crawl-marks

,where he lay out on his belly

to overpass some stretch of bauchy ice

I lie out

dragging myself forward with bear-knives in my fists.

On the third day I begin to starve,

at nightfall I bend down as I knew I would

at a turd SOpped in blood >

and hesitate, and pick it up, _

and thrust it in my mouth, and gnash it down,
and rise

and go on running.

4
On the seventh day,

living by now on bear-blood alone,
I can see his upturned carcass far out ahead, a scraggled,
steamy bulk,

the heavy fur riffling in the wind.

I come up to him ’

and stare at the narrowespaced, petty eyes,
the dismayed £599

face laid back on the shoulder; the nostrils
.flared, catching

perhaps the first taint of me as he-

died. 1
