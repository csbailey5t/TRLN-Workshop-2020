WHAT
EVERY WOMAN
oucr—r‘r TO KNOW

THAT nearly all furs are obtained by trapping wild

animals.

THAT the trapping of wild animals for fur is accomp-
lished by the most revolting cruelty.

THAT animals caught in the trap suffer intense agony;
their limbs are lacerated and broken by the steel
jaws; death from hunger, exhaustion, or freezing,
from being eaten by some other animal or from the
trapper’s club, comes often after days of torture.

THAT in some districts it is not unusual for trappers to
lose one-third of their catch, ﬁnding feet only. In
these cases, the animal has gnawed its leg through
or torn and twisted it off by frantic pulling. About
one-ﬁfth of the animals caught have only three legs,
having escaped previous capture by self mutilation.

THAT in February, l933, alone, two London ﬁrms offered
for sale over 3,000,000 skins of wild animals of

various kinds.

THAT recent Board of Trade returns show over one
hundred million dressed and undressed fur skins
annually imported into Great Britain.

THAT warm fabrics can now be obtained which. are.

cheaper, lighter and healthier than fur, and the "ﬁsnb- s 4‘3" ':

stitution of which will encourage a home industry.
The continued use of fur can therefore be justiﬁed by
neither principle, expediency or necessity.

THAT the practice of trapping, accompanied as it is by
cruelty, has a deteriorating effect upon the character
of those who are engaged upon it.

THAT the buyer and wearer of fur is morally responsible
for the traps and the trappers and the long drawn
agony of the trapped. It is the wearer who creates
the demand.

THAT this revolting and degrading trade can be stopped

by an enlightened public opinion.

 

REALISING THESE THINGS WILL YOU
(1) RENOUNCE THE USE OF FUR YOURSELF.
(2) INVITE OTHERS TO DO THE SAME.

(3) PRESS FORWARD LEGISLATION TO PROHIBIT
THE IMPORTATION OF FUR.

THE NEXT STEP RESTS WITH YOU.
