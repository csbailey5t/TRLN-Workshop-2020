DETROIT NEWS - July 11, 1988

Panda deal
rejection by
. S. called,

an insult

Chinese province Wen’t
cut relations With state

By Dennis Pfaff
News Staff Writer

LANSING —— A high-ranking official in
China’s Sichuan Province said her govern-
ment was insulted by the rejection of China’s
offer to send two giant pandas to Detroit for
an exhibit. , 1'. I

However, Xu Runhui, assistant director
of Sichuan’s Office of Foreign Affairs. said
the panda fiasco will not harm the province’s
5—year-old sister~state relationship: With
Michigan. '-

In an interview at the Michigan United
Conservation Clubs’ (MUCC) Lansing head-
quarters, Xu said Sichuan’s leaders would
continue to help if future efforts are made to
bring pandas to the state. . i

A nearly three—year project to win a'foan
of two of the rare animals broke down in
'June, when the US. Fish and Wildlife
Service turned down the state’s application
for a permit to import the pandas. XuWas
Michigan’s primary contact and was cred-
ited with being instrumental in gaining her
national government’s permission for ‘the
loan. -‘

THAT PERMISSION, Xu said. is
“very, very difficult” to get. ‘ ""

In its rejection, the Fish and Wildlife
Service raised questions about the Use of
proceeds from the panda exhibition, which
Michigan ofﬁcials said could amount to $1
million for panda preservation programs in
China. . -

At the time, state and MUCC officials
expressed concern about the rejection’s ef-
fect on China. " '

Xu said Chinese officials “of course”.were
insulted by the action but also said she does
not know the country’s official reaction
because she was in the United States When
the permit was rejected. -.

Xu said she has written a report explain-
ing the situation to her superiors. . ‘- .

:11 think the leaders understand this,” she
sai .

AS AN EXAMPLE of Sichuan’s con-
tinuing efforts to maintain its relationship
with Michigan, Xu is meeting with state
officials to set up visits by a provincial song

and dance troupe. She said the province also "

wants an exhibit of light industrial goods at
‘ the Michigan State Fair. . .
Such exchanges, Xu said, help China and
the United States. ' r ’

Panda loans, she said, also provide badlv
needed cash for protection and research into
the animals, which may number fewer than
1,000. Xu said the national government’s
annual budget for pandas is about $12
million and that Sichuan must put up'much
of its own money for preservation projects.

Inl a provrncle Witt}: more than 100 million
peop e —-— equa to a out half the o ulation
of the United States —— that is dilffildult, she
sai .

“We have many other problems in the
province and so the budget that goes to this
project is limited,” Xu said. “We have some
minority areas where the (living) conditions
of the people is not very well, to compare
With the people living in the city, so the
government has to help them to raise their
livmg standard.” '. ' i

A former high school English teacher, Xu
was ousted from the national Ministry of
Foreign Economic Relations and Trade in
the early days of China’s Cultural Retrolu—
tron. Well-educated and a fluent English-
speaker, she was among thousands of intel-

lectuals virtually exiled in their own chuntrv.

. That was in 1965 and she was sent to
Sichuan. By 1978, the notorious “Gang of
Four,” new blamed for the Cultural Revolu-
tion, was smashed and her former emplovers
at the tradeministry wanted her back. ’ i: if

The plight of a tiny deer symbolizes the
fight over Keys developm

 

By MONICA RHOR .

Miami Bureau

BIG PINE KEY —- This is a town
ton in two. Neighbor vs. neighbor.
Environmentalist vs. developer.

And caught in the middle, standing
in the path of the bulldozers, are the
endangered Key deer. ;

These gentle, tiny animals have be-
come the central playersin a 3-year-
old struggle between those who want
to preserve Big Pine Key and those
who want to see it grow. .1

The controversy centers on a local
access road through the town, 30
miles northeast of Key West.

Supporters say the road is needed to
accommodate traffic. Opponents fear
it could trigger uncontrolled develop-
{nent that will wipe out the deer p0pu-
ation. ' '

“Development is going to happen
regardless of what we do today,” ar-
gues Les Field, a proponent of the 1.2-

mile road. “Are the deer more. impor-~
tant than peOple‘?”

Island resident Grace Mannillo
thinks they are. “If people want. an ur~
ban setting, then don‘t come here. Do
we want this place to end up looking
like Marco Island?”

The controversy began innocentljyf
enough.

In 1985, an ad hoc citizens corzsmit—
tee approved plans for an east-west
access road, parallel to L28. 1. they
would allow local residents to area:
the island while reducing traffic or
the highway.

The plan was quickly approve-r3 l:
the Monroe County Commission.
which began acquiring land needed.
for the 50-foot-wide road. In early
1986, workers began a portion of the
road.

road kills reported so far this year.

 




Both’sides claim
more deer will live
if fight succeeds

Then the legal snags started.

Both the Department of Com-
munity Affairs and the Depart-
ment of Natural Resources filed
violation notices against the
county, saying it did not follow its
own land-use regulations. The
county had failed to conduct en-
vironmental-impact and traffic
studies before starting work, the
state agencies contended.

Next, landowners who had
signed over to the county 25-foot
easements for the road began to
protest, claiming coercion.

Environmental groups joined
the fray when they discovered
the road bordered National Key
Deer Refuge land and sat in the
middle of prime deer-roaming

 

The deer should be moved to
smaller, undeveloped keys, he
said. “Put the deer where they
belong.”

“They’re‘ not cattle. You can’t
Squeeze them together,” Holle

1 _ said.

“There’s all this rush to devel~

0p. But the boom can come and
' go just like that,” Holle said.

“Once the deer are gone, you
can’t bring them back.”

The US. Fish and Wildlife Ser- “I’m already seeing less deer and less fish. ,

vice also opposed the road, say-
ing “it will greatly increase the
mortality potential to deer.”
Traffic is one of the biggest
dangers facing the 250 remaining
Key deer, says Deborah Holle, di-

rector of the 7,400-acre deer ref— -

uge.

Key deer are the smallest spe-
cies of white-tailed deer in the
nation, standing about 2 feet
when fully grown. The wide-eyed
animals, sometimes called toy or
elf deer, are so tame they wander
around houses and yards, begging
for food.

Too often, that leads to death,
Holle said. “Some pe0ple coax
, them across the road to be fed.
Even if they don’t get hit then,
they do the next time.”

Last year, 65 deer were killed
by cars, with 32 road kills report-
ed so far this year. About 53 per-
cent of all road kills were report-
ed on US. 1, Holle said.

The access road would actually
reduce deer kills by drawing traf-
fic away from US. 1 and onto the
low-speed road, said Bill Becker,
who was on the committee that
proposed the road.

“Traffic will intersect with
deer no matter where you put it.
But a deer has a better chance
against a car going 25 mph than
one going 50,” said Becker, now
president of the Chamber of
Commerce.

Holle does not buy that theory.
“We had deer who are just
bumped and still die. They are
high-strung animals and they just
lose the will to live,” she said.

In addition, the new read Wlll
soon be “just another road for
deer to get killed on. Pretty soon,

we’ll have heavy traffic on both,”-:
, Holle said.

Legal issues have‘temporarily ' A

stalled work on the road. But the
debate rages on.

And in this debate, the road is
just a symptom. The real issue is
development on Big Pine Key,
now a town of about 3,000.

“They have hidden agendas,”
Becker said of the road Oppo-
nents. “They want the highway to
clog up so there will be a mora-
torium on building.”

“Those people have their heads
in the sand while Big Pine is de-
veloping. If they had their way,
they wouldn’t allow us to build
one more foot,” said Field, 3 Big
Pine resident since 1978.

Mannillo, who supports a limit
on development, accuses road
supporters of having their own
hidden motives.

“The road would Open the far
side of the island for develop-
ment,” Mannillo said. “You have
to decide what you want —— peo-
ple or birds and animals.”

When Mannillo moved to Big
Pine Key 12 years ago, the island
had no grocery stores or banks,
she said. Now, there are several
strip shopping centers. New sub-
divisions are pOpping up all over
the island.

That trend alarms some resi-
dents.

“I came here to get away from
the big city. Now it seems this is
going the same way,” said Barba-
ra Giede, who left Fort Lauder-
dale 10 years ago.

As deveIOpment increases,
more of the island’s wildlife is be-
ing lost, Mannillo said. “I’m al-
ready seeing less deer and less
fish.”

The Key deer are especially
vulnerable to the byproducts of
development, Holle said. 4

They are attacked by dogs, or

i chased into canals, where they

; drown. They learn to accept food

: handouts, which can make them

' weak and unhealthy. Most of all,

they lose the habitat necessary
for survival.

The dangers are clearly
spelled out in the Monroe County
Land Use Plan. “The primary
threats to Key deer are hu-
man beings, with the foremost
being the outright destruction
and alteration of Key deer habi-
tat for residential and commer-
cial development.” ,

“If peOple come first and we
can afford to lose the deer, what
do we lose next? When does it
stop?” Holle asked.

Becker denies the new road
will trigger more development,
saying “that’s an outlandish
claim. It’s not going to be a com-
mercial strip. Of course, we can’t
stOp people from applying for
commercial zoning, but the coun-
ty can always say no.”

However, Field thinks growth
is inevitable and says all of Big
Pine should be opened up for de-
velopment.

“People who bought lots did it
for an investment; they have a
right to expect improvements,”
Field said. “If we do it right, we
{don’t have to cohabitate with the

eer.”

Dean Edward Rhode

School of veterinary Medicine
University of California
Davis, CA 95616

Dear Dean Rhode:

In an age where everyone is becoming more enlightened as to the rights
of animals, it is very upsetting that your school chose to release Dr.
Nedim Buyukmmhci, a professor at UCD, from his position as Course Leader
of Veterinary Opthalmology.

It is my understanding he was released for offering ethical alternatives

to using live, healthy animals for surgical training in the course, such

as working on cadavers or terminally ill animals. This idea makes a lot

of sense to me, and I am sure it does to a lot of people, including a lot
of doctors and veterinarians.

It is long past time for researchers to try and save the taxpayers some
money, not to continue to spend it doing the same thing over and over
‘again. I.sincerely hope the Research and Dissemination Act before our
Congress will be passed so that this endless repetition will cease once
and fOr all. For a modern, so-called ”civilized” country to continue to
kill millions of unfortunate animals every year in our laboratories is
no longer acceptable to the majority of people - not when they know the
facts; when they see what tortures these animals are put through, and
when they understand thoroughly how the majority of this WOTk is merely
repetition. - '

However, I can understand your resistasnce to change - to try other alter-
natives to the use of live animals in your research means you would not be
receiving as much money from the NIH, and this money could go toward re-
ducing the exorbitant debt we face in America.

I believe that by removing Dr. Buyukmihci from his position at your Uni-
versity you have simply strengthened the determination of the Animal Rights
"movement that researchers must find other alternatives. There are far too
many doctors who believe that research on anunmls is not helpfhl to humans,
and as long as they feel that way, other methods must be found.

Sincerely,

(Mrs.) Constance F. Yarbrough

 




BOSTON GLOBE - July 14, 1988

Head of the courthouse mouse patrol

By Elizabeth Neuffer
Contributing Reporter

t‘s 9 am. in the US District Court-
house. The marble lobby echoes with
the staccato clip of high heels and the
shufﬂe of loafers as people race for ele-
vators, en route to a trial or hearing. But
graciously sprawled on the lobby floor is
Mitzi, oblivious to the hubbub.
Mitzi?
The courthouse cat.

The bundle of blackvand-white fur is
mascot and mouser for the courthouse con»
cession stand, run by Armin Gluck. And in
the seven months he has been at the court-
house on Post Office Square, Mitzi has
gained a reputation — and something of a
cult following. .

“They ask: is he married, is he your cat,
where is Mitzi, how is Mitzi?” said Gluck,
“Everybody loves him.”

“Mitzi’s part of the building,” agreed ad—
mirer Mary O’Callahan, an administrative
analyst for the US Court of Appeals. “He's
added a lot of life to this place." .

Most mornings, Mitzi perches on top of
the concession’s garbage can. lounges on
the lobby ﬂoor or sprawls across a table of
the day‘s newspapers while Gluck amiably
dispenses cups of coffee, cigarettes and
candy.

A job of his own

Not that Mitzi doesn’t have his work to
do. Before he arrived, mice had damaged as
much as $400 worth of items in the stand.
Gluck says. Now, the mice have disap—
peared.

“You should have seen the newspa-_

pers,” said Gluck. “Shredding machines
couldn’t do a job like that.”

Black, with a white stripe down his nose
and a white chest and paws, Mitzi was
found abandoned on the street last Christ-
mas by another courthouse employee,
Gluck said. Gluck and his wife, Ilone, took
only one look at the then-skinny and be-
draggled cat and adoption was instanta-
neous.

”He‘s the only baby we have," said
Gluck, a former concentration camp in-
mate at Auschwitz and Buchenwald who
lost his family in the war.

Gluck — who is legally blind — came to
Boston from Eastern Europe in 1962. A na-
tive Hungarian and Jewish, he was to sent
to jail in the USSR and then forced to join
the Russian Army in World War II. But his
division was captured by the Gestapo in its
third day of fighting. When he was finally
freed from a series of concentration camps
in 1945, his weight had dropped from 175
to 75 and he was losing his eyesight.

His left forearm still bears the concen—
tration camp tattoo.

Now 71, Gluck is a popular and well-
known concessionaire. having operated a
stand at City Hall and also at l 10 Tremont
St. under a federal program for the blind.

g
l

“That's 71 in age, but 21 at heart." core
rected Gluck. his eyes beaming from be-

hind his thick glasses.

So each weekday until 3 pm. there is a
steady stream of people who come into the
concession stand as much to see Gluck and

Mitzi as to buy coffee.
“He draws you to him"

“Mitzi’s sort of like the Sphinx,” said
Helen Doona, who works for the US Depart-
ment of Labor, also housed in the building.

“He draws you to him.”

Given Mitzi's mysterious origins, some
things about him are still unknown, Un-
clear, for example. is why Mitzi acts like a
dog, coming when Gluck calls him and

even sitting doWn when told to.
And is Mitzi. in fact. a he?
“He doesn’t know yet." said Gluck.
What breed is Mitzi?

‘They ask: is he married, is he your cat,
where is Mitzi, how is Mitzi? Everybody

loves him.’

“A typical Boston cat." said Gluck.
”That‘s what the vet told me.”

In temper with courthouse character.
Mitzi‘s followers try to be judicious in their

' opinions.

“He’s wonderful.” said Nancy Mat-
thews. who works in the US Attorney's of—
fice. .

“A lot of people come in to see Mitzi — it’s
a great way to start the day." added Mat—
thews, one of the Mitzi fans who have
bought the cat little caged balls and other
toys as gifts.

Judge Rya W. Zobel said she was de-
lighted to have a feline in the courthouse.
and thought it added class. to the building.

And asked what he thought of Mitzi.

. Robert S. Mueller 3d, deputy US attorney.

said: ”No comment." Pressed for details. he
_ added: “The cat‘s fine."

Not everyone in the ZO-story courthouse,
however, knows Mitzi. Judge David S. Nel—
son. for example, doesn‘t visit the eonees
sion stand. He said he had never met Mitzi.
as he has his own coffeemaker in his cham—
bers and has his newspapers delivered at
home.

Rumor has it. however. that Mitzi has
his flaws. He has, on occasion. been known
to sulk and chase flies. And he only eats
one brand of cat food.

But to many. Mitzi seems as much a
part of the courthouse scene as robed
judges and lawyers carrying attache ea St‘S.

And. on the lobby level at least. "He's
the boss.” said Gluck.

CHICAGO TRIBUNE - July 12, 1988

”Will gorillas thrive as a species of tourist

By Bunny McBride Mountain Gorilla Project, a

 

ARC DES VOLCANS,

Rwanda—Rob Campbell

stood in a narrow mountain

pathway of the mist-shrouded

forest, camera pressed to his
nose, focusing his lens on a 400—
pound male “silverback” gorilla
voraciously consuming a bamboo
tree. The great ape was so close
that Campbell and his five
companions could hear every
crunch.

As he stood enthralled, Campbell
felt a heaVy hand on his shoulder.
Expecting it to be one of his
travelmates, Campbell spun

around, only to find himself face to.

face with a pair of luminous brown
eyes set in a massive black patent-
leather face. .

The 300—pound silverback, which
had been waiting patiently to pass,
gently turned the tourist and slid

y.

For Campbell and the others,
such experiences were a sublime
reward for the torturous 2'/2-hour
climb up the lush, slippery slopes
of Rwanda’s Visoke Mountain.

Such encounters are on the rise
in a region known as the Virungas
ecosystem, a string of fertile mile—
high mountains that straddle the
borders of Rwanda, Zaire and
Uganda in central Africa. Here live
nearly 300 of the world’s 400
mountain gorillas. And here exists
a novel tourism industry aimed at
preserving these powerful yet
unaggressive primates.

Mountain gorillas are among the
most endangered species on Earth.
There are no early ﬁgures on their
population, but from 1960 to 1981
their numbers in the Virungas .
plummeted from about 500 to 242.
(An estimated 100 more live 15
miles north, in Uganda’s
, Impenetrable Forest.)

The gorillas live in stable
polygamous family groups and
have no natural enemies, other
than humans. Humans have
usurped their habitat for farming,
sold them to zoos and research
labs and murdered them to make
sculptures with their skulls or
ashtrays with their hands.

During this decade there has
been a dramatic turnaround in the
fate of these creatures, particularly
those living in Rwanda. Major
credit for the change goes to the

consortium of international
conservation organizations, .
including the African Wildlife
Foundation and the World Wildlife
Fund, Working with the Rwandan
government.

The project, founded in 1979
and situated in the Parc National
des Volcans, which is Rwanda’s
comer of the Virungas, combines
three strategies for preserving the
apes.

First, it provides regular patrols
to catch poachers, collect snares

and monitor the gorilla population.

Second, it seeks to educate local
people about conservation.

The third strategy is where Rob .
Campbell and his tourist friends
come in. The project has created a
unique “gorilla-watching” tourism -
industry 1n Rwanda, which has
created a strong economic
incentive for gorilla protection in
the country.

There rs no doubt that Rwanda’
commitment to the program is
rooted as much in money as in
conservation.

Rwanda is the most densely
populated country in Africa, its 5.5
million people living within 10,000
square miles. Ninety-five percent of
its citizens are peasants, and the
country is an almost—uninterrupted
patchwork of cultivated plots,
except in the Parc National des
Volcans.

Because of increased demand for
farmland, nearly half the park was
turned over to cultivation in 1973,
reducing it to about 46 square
miles. In the late 19705, farmers
living at the base of the Virungas
pressed to obtain even more of the
park.

“Researchers like myself and
conservationists familiar with the
region knew that further human
encroachment on the park would
inevitably lead to the gorilla’s
extinction,” MGP director Craig
Sholley said.

“It would also lead to
uncontrolled water runoff and soil
erosion.

“Most of us felt that the only
thing that might convince a
developing country like Rwanda
that saving the park and the
gorillas was important was tourism
money. In our view, the only

_ alternative was to habituate gorilla

‘ attraction? ‘

Christian Science Monitor

A silverback gorilla, one of the
world’s endangered species, “in
Rwanda’s Parc des Volcans.

groups for tourists.”

Between 1979 and 1983 this plan
was carried out among four gorilla
groups. Project staff approached
the animals daily, sitting a bit
closer and staying a bit longer each
day until trust was established.
Now tourists, accompanied by a
ranger-guide, can sit among these
groups in their natural habitat.

“In effect, tourists serve as a
guard force for the gorillas,
deterring poachers just by their
presence,’ ’said Russ Mittemier, of
the World Wildlife Fund.

Visitors are coached on how to
sit among the gorillas without

provoking them. They are

forbidden to touch the gorillas, but
sometimes contact is unavoidable.

“I’ve had a baby jump on my
back and steal an earring,” sai
Diana McMeekin, vice president of
the African Wildlife Foundation,
“and any number of people have
had their cameras snatched.”

Last year’s 6,000 visitors
generated half a million dollars 1n
much-needed foreign currency
through park— —entry and gorilla- .
watching fees. When the charge for
visiting the gorillas doubles this
year, to about $145 a person, the
annual intake will jump to $1

 




:million.

Taking into account the money
spent on gas, lodging, food and
souvenirs, gorilla-watching has
become a multimillion-dollar
enterprise. In fact, according to
Sholley, tourism is now the No. 2
earner of foreign capital in
Rwanda, after coffee and tea,
“totally due to gorillas.”

Without the pioneering
antipoaching efforts of the late
American zoologist Dian Fossey,
there probably would be no

mountain gorillas left to protect.
Fossey initiated the first long—term
study of these primates in 1967,
when she set up Karisoke Research
Station on the remote 10,000-foot—
high saddle between Karisimbe and
Visoke Mountains.

A new biography by Farley
Mowatt, “Woman in the Mists,”
describes Fossey’s extraordinary
research and rancorous struggle to
save the species. Her efforts to
protect them from poachers was
heroic, at times frenzied. She once
went so far as to kidnap the son of
a poacher and burn the belongings
of his family.

In 1977, following the brutal
slaying of Digit, a beloved gorilla
with which Fossey had had contact
since his birth 10 years earlier, she
launched the Digit Fund, a
successful international campaign
to sUpport antipoaching foot
patrols within the park.

But Fossey’s passion for the well-
being of the mountain gorilla was
so intense that she alienated other
researchers, locals, and park and
government officials.

On Dec. 28, 1985, she was
murdered, and the Rwandan

- government tried and convicted in
absentia her assistant, Wayne
McGuire. It is speculated, however,
that she was killed by poachers or
by someone contracted by
Rwandan officials who saw-her as a
roadblock to the lucrative gorilla
tourism industry.

Indeed, Fossey did not even
endorse the founding of the
Mountain Gorilla Project because
she was concerned that its multiple
activities would divert attention
and funds from her single-minded
aim to halt poaching. Yet the
project appears to have made a
profound contribution to Fossey’s
goal of gorilla preservation.

Because of the new Fossey
biography and a forthcoming
Warner Bros. film about her,
starring Sigoumey Weaver, growing
numbers of tourists no doubt will
be drawn to Rwanda.

Will increased demand result in
an exploitation of the gorillas?

“We won’t allow it,” Sholley
said. “Only six visitors are allowed ‘

Ambulance Gives Fido, Felix Human-Type First-Aid Care

By CAROL MCGRAW,
Times Staff Writer

he patient’s yowls turned to whim-

pers as the paramedics adminis-

tered a sedative and began the

delicate work of extracting his 'leg
from the dishwasher. Two hours later,
Mary Lipis’ mangled dishwasher door lay
on the floor, and her somewhat less-man-
gled cat Chu Chu lay on a stretcher in an
ambulance headed for the veterinary hos-
pital. The cat, who had reached its paw into
a crack in the dishwasher, was treated for
his bruises and came back home to San
Gabriel the next day.

“I don’t know what we would have done
without him,” Lipis said, praising Dirk Van
Voris, the animal health technician who
had rescued the curious feline.

Van Voris owns D.J.‘s Pet Taxi in
Hacienda Heights, one of the few pet
ambulance services in the country manned
by trained paramedics. In 18 months of
operation, he has offered medical assist-
ance and tender care to dogs and cats
overcome by ﬂea spray, crazed by drugs,
hit by cars, bitten by coyotes, poisoned by
irate neighbors and debilitated by disease.
The ambulance also picks up dead animals
for burial. .

The service is run much like the human
variety, with 24-hour emergency calls
answered anywhere in the Los Angeles
area, as well as routine transportation to
animal hospitals. The ambulance, which
Van Voris designed for animals, is equipped
with lifesaving equipment, and even has
room for frantic owners who want to ride
with their sick pets. The pet paramedics,
like those emergency workers who treat
humans, use portable phones to get de-
tailed instructions from their patients’
doctors on how to proceed with emergency
treatment,

Van Voris, 24, who received an animal
health technician degree from Mt. San
Antonio College in Walnut, said he had
always been interested in the emergency
side of his profession. Several of his
veterinarian friends told him there was a
real need for such a service and encouraged
him to go ahead with the project.

He designed the ambulance because he
could find no prototypes, and once
equipped, he touted his service at animal
clinics citywide. Now, most of his business
comes from veterinarian referrals.

Only recently, with some of the expen-
sive equipment outlays taken care of, has
the business started to be self- supporting,
Van Voris said. He charges $25 round trip
for . non-emergency transportation. The
base fee for a night emergency run is $45.
Even with emergency medical care added,

Curbing a plastic killer

Degradable 6 pack holders to replace Wildlife ‘death 'nooses’

By James L. Kerwin
News Staff Writer

Indestructible plastic six-pack beverage
rings. —-— death nooses for birds and other
wildlife —— will be banned in Michigan by next
summer, replaced by holders that disintegrate
in sunlight.

However, the outlawing of plastic rings is
only one step toward stopping the killing of
thousands of birds and fish who have died when
they became entangled in discarded plastic
debris. . -

“The strength and longevity of plastic prod-
ucts becomes a liability when plastic becomes
litter,” said State Rep. Kenneth Sikkema, R-
Grandville, who sponsored the legislation that
requires six-pack holders to be made of degrad~
able materials. Gov. James J. Blanchard signed
the bill in June. ’1

MICHIGAN became the 13th state to enact

such legislation. 'The others are ocean coastal
states, except for Wisconsin where plastic dis—
cards have caused serious problems in Green
Bay, off the western shore of Lake Michigan.

New degradable six-pack holders, which
must be used in Michigan by next June, are
made from a corn starch derivative that disinte-
grates in ultraviolet sun rays. They will break
down in two to three weeks in direct sunlight or
after several months in water or under cloudy
conditions.

Manufacturers say the resulting inert plastic
bits become harmless parts of the soil or lake
bottom.

Environmentalists cumplain the more dura-
ble plastic is dangerous and even fatal to birds
and wildlife when carelessly discarded.

“Birds have strangled or starved to death
when they got their heads'caught in the rings,”
said Tom Erdman, a researcher with the Uni-
versity of Wisconsin at Green Bay.

 

“MANY BIRDS get entangled in synthetic
fishing lines. Some take it back to their nests
and get other birds wrapped up in it. Even

.worse, fishermen who snag birds will cut off

their legs. A one—legged gull won’t survive.”
Plastic dumping has gotten so bad in places

that Wisconsin officials have banned picnics on

some Green Bay beaches.

Most of the problem in Michigan involves
nylon fishing nets and monofilament fishing
lines - a problem Sikkema admits his bill did
not address.

“Quite frequently plastic fishing lines are lost
and wrap up in big balls in which waterfowl get
tangled,” said Jerry Martz, a DNR wildlife
supervisor.

DNR crews annually find Canada geese
suffering from injured legs entangled in fishing
line. “Sometimes it can shut off the circulation,
which means it is a struggle to save the bird,”

Martz said.

Coromorants, birds that dive for
fish, have become snared in synthet-
ic fish nets and drowned. The com-

 

mon loon has perished under similar.

conditions, a special concern of DNR
officials because there are only 300
loons still nesting in Michigan.

PLASTIC DISCARDS can
- pose serious problems for boaters,
too. There are frequent reports of
fishing line becoming wrapped
around motors, which then slice
through oil seals and cause serious
engine damage. A new prop and
transmission can cost $2,500.

Much of the 26,000 tons of trash
produced by boaters each year is
made of plastic products, some of
which ends up on beaches or lake
bottoms.

. “I don’t know how many times
someone, fishing 10 miles off shore,
thought they snagged a big salmon,
which turns out to be a big plastic
bag filled with water,” said Joe Wolff,
who operates a charter ﬁshing boat
in northern Lake Michigan.

One bird researcher, Jim Ludwig,
of Bay City, said he has come across
only a few birds snagged in plastic
discards in his extensive travels
along Michigan’s Great Lakes shore-

me.

“The difference between

Wisconsin’s littered shorelines and
Michigan is attributed to Michigan’s
returnable, bottle law, which makes
people more conscientious about lit-
ter,” Ludwig said. .

“While (Michigan’s problem) may
not be as severe as on the ocean and
continental coastlines, we can logi-
cally assume the same problems
could develop here,” Sikkema said.
“We’re seeing more and more litter
cluttering our beaches and streams.”

WORKERS at the Belle Isle
Nature Center said. they frequently
care for birds that get snagged in
beverage holders and synthetic fish-
ing line. Victims include raccoons
rooting through trash.

“We’ve cared for song birds,” said
naturalist Laura Fabbri-Tucker.
“Usually, people catch the birds
snared in six-pack rings because they
have become weakened. Sometimes
they are beyond help. We try to nurse
them back to health.” '

Park officials in the
Huron-Clinton Metropolitan Au—
thority occasionally care for a bird
caught in a plastic ring, but more
often are called on to help waterfowl
snared in ﬁshing lines.

The DNR plans to conduct more
extensive studies on waterfowl and
wildlife injured or killed by plastic
discards. One recent DNR estimate
reckoned that one in every 100 birds
observed by biologists was entangled
in synthetic lines.

EVEN ANGLERS can be vic-
tims. One veteran fishermen reports
parts of the Au Sable and Rogue
rivers in the northern Lower Penin-
sula are crisscrossed with a labyrinth
of lost and discarded monoﬁlament
lines. On a recent outing, be hooked
lines nine times- in a row while
casting.

 

 

 

Degradable
plastics

Michigan recently adopted a
law requiring bottlers to Use
degradable plastic loop rings
for six packs. The law is de-
signed to protect birds and
other wildlife that have be-
come entangled in the plastic
rings and help keep the envi-
. ronment clean.

1. Utter: Careless consumer
‘ drops plastic loop on
beach. ‘

2. Sun rays: Ultraviolet sun

' rays cause plastic to disin-
tegrate in two weeks to six
months, depending upon
amount of sunshine.

3. Remains: Tiny bits of inert
plastic remain and become
part of the landscape but

» are no longer a threat to
birds and wildlife.

 

 

 

 

Others worry about bits of plastic
being swallowed or ingested by wa-
terfowl, mammals or fish, which can
prove fatal. .

More and more plastic is being
used. Production is nearing 50 billion

pounds a year, more than a sevenfold

increase since 1960. Since there is
limited recycling, much of it winds
up in the trash heap.

Plastic can be used in making new
containers, fencing, retaining walls,
packing materials, fiber for sleeping
bags and bristles for paint brushes.

 

Most of the
problem ,
involves nylon
fishing nets and
monotilament
fishing lines

 

 

 

Sikkema says his bill requiring
the degradable beverage rings will
cost about one-tenth of a“ cent per

. six—pack.

THERE HAS been no major
objection to the new legislation and
there is a move for a national law.
The world’s largest brewer,
Anheuser-Busch, already has

switched to degradable holders. Oth-

ers beverage producers are quietly
conforming.

Members of the National Soft
Drink Association, while not oppos-

' ing the state mandated degradable

plastic requirement, urge more re-
cycling. '
While many people are careful of

,what they throw into the water,

anti-litter laws often are unenforcea-
ble on the Great Lakes and inland
waterways.

Sikkema and other lawmakers
feel the best way to ease the problem
is to aim at the manufacturer of
materials that now can last a centu-

ry. ,

“Littering laws depend on peo—
ple’s willingness to dispose of litter
properly,” said Tom Martin, director
of Michigan’s Ofﬁce of the Great
Lakes. “1 don’t think there is any
reasonable way, to expect any law
enforcement agency to enforce it.”

FALcoNs “comma 10 DENVER

Falcons to be put on skyscraper today " C

By Jay Grelen
Denver Post Staff Writer

The hatching of Denver’s pere-
grine falcon project is about
complete, and biologist Jerry
Craig isn’t getting much sleep.

“I’ve been less nervous rappel-
ling off 1,200-foot cliffs,” said
Craig, who works for the state
Division of Wildlife.

The birds themselves, which
will be ﬂown from Boise, Idaho,
to Denver today, have been
hatched for just more than a
month. Craig will be with the
team that places the five newly
hatched birds atop One Civic
Center building today.

the start of Denver’s efforts to
help save the peregrine falcon
from extinction.

Other cities nationwide have
transplanted the falcons success-
fully onto skyscrapers, which
substitute for the falcons’ natural
canyon habitat.

Craig helped harvest falcon
eggs from northwest Colorado
last month. The eggs were turn-
ed over to the Peregrine Fund in
Idaho, where they were hatched,
although the young birds arriving
in Denver weren’t hatched from
those Colorado eggs, he said.

The birds will be placed in a
hatch box for about a week,
where they will be fed quail
meat. Sometime next week, they

will be released from the box.
But, they could fly as early as to-
day, Craig said. .

Remote controlled cameras
will monitor the birds’ activity.
Cameras will transmit the im-
ages to a screen at the Denver
Museum of Natural History,
where visitors can watch the fal-
cons’ progress.

The peregrines probably will
ﬂy south in the winter and may
not return to their home in down-
town Denver for two years, said
Jim Hekkers. The wildlife divi-
sion will repeat the process for
two more years and hopes that at
least one pair will return to nest.

“Peregrines are real loyal to
nesting sites,” Hekkers said.

two years, Craig said. But, bioloa

gists hope, they eventually will

canyons. New birds will be

brought in for the next two
years, and at the end of the

three-year program, Craig
hopes, Denver will have falcons

' Craig hopes the falcons, which

nearly were obliterated by the
pesticide DDT, will be off the list
of endangered species by the
mid‘199tls.

GOODALL BREAKS GROUND
FOR CHIMPS

Ground was broken on May 5 for a world-class
chimpanzee exhibit during ceremonies at the
Detroit Zoo. Nearly 350 guests enjoyed the
morning’s events, including special
guests Mayor Coleman A. Young
and world-renowned prima— ~
tologist Dr. Jane Goodall.

Considered the most
influential and respected
primate researcher in the world,

Dr. Goodall has received numerous honors
and awards. She was the first person to
observe chimps making and using tools, a
behavior previously credited to humans alone.

The Detroit Zoo’s four—acre chimp exhibit will

replicate the Tanzania environment
where Dr. Goodall has studied chimps
for the past 29 years. It will even-
tually house between 25-30
chimps, allowing Zoo visitors
and researchers to observe chimps
in a thoroughly realistic setting.

Mystery Dolphin Deaths: Will They Return?

 




 

1714' Associated Prcss

VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. — A
year ago, beaches were littered with
carcasses of bottlenose dolphins,
killed by a disease scientist still do
not understand.

This summer, there have been
few reports of stranded dolphins,
but scientists are not yet sure
whether that is good news.

“We’re frankly very nervous,”
said Robert Schoelkopf of the Ma-
rine Mammal Stranding Center
based in Brigantine, N.J. “This may
simply be a pause.”

On Wednesday, the center re-
covered a dead bottlenose dolphin
found on the beach in Long Branch,
NJ. Schoelkopf said he ruled out
old age as a cause of death but was
not sure if the mammal, a female
about 8 feet long, died of the same
malady that killed bottlenose dol-
phins last summer. It had been
dead about two days, he said.

Brian Gorman, a spokesman for
the National Oceanic and Atmos-
pheric Administration (NOAA), said
unusual deaths among the bottlen-
ose appear to have subsided com-
pared with last year.

“The bad news is we still don’t
understand what happened last
year,” he said.

More than 800 of the mammals

, ‘ washed ashore and died beginning

 

‘One thing that has become clear, the effect of the deaths
on the bottlenose population is more profound than we had
feared last year. We now feel that between 20 percent and
50 percent of the bottlenose population may have died.’

— Brian Gorman, NOAA spokesman

a year ago, according to NOAA’s Na-
tional Marine Fisheries Service.
Gorman said that number could

mean as many as 5,000 of the ani--
mals were killed, their bodies being'

lost at sea.

By aerial survey, NOAA scien-
tists estimate the bottlenose popula~
tion along the east coast was 8,000
to 10,000 before last year’s episode.
“But you have to realize that such
surveys border on political polls
and black magic as far as accuracy
or reality,” Gorman said.

“One thing that has become
clear, the effect of the deaths on the
bottlenose population is more pro-
found than we had feared last year.
We now feel that between 20 per-
‘cent and. 50 percent of the bottle-
nose population may have died,” he
said.

Schoelkopf agrees.

“We use the beach patrol to
take a daily count on the animals.
Right now, our figures on the bot-
tlenose are down by two-thirds,” he

,said.

Those declining numbers may

explain why there have been so few ~

reported strandings of bottlenose,
Gorman and Schoelkopf said. Be-
cause there are fewer animals, the
number of beachings is down.

- The bottlenose is the most com-
mon of the dolphin species travel-
ing along the east coast. The mam-
mals, which can grow up to 15 feet
and 440 pounds, are trained easily
and often are featured in aquatic
shows.

Scientists know what killed the
dolphins, but they do not under-
stand why the dolphins suddenly
became susceptible to the
microorganism. _

Joseph Geraci, a marine pathol-
ogist and veterinarian from the On-
tario Veterinary College in Guelph,
headed the research team that
identified the bacteria as Vibrio, a
common form that flourishes in
warm water rich in nutrients. The
bacteria sometimes is associated
with polluted water, and some spe-
cies cause cholera in humans and

 

animals.

“You would expect the very
young and the very old to be affect-
ed more by the disease, but that is
not the case.” Gorman said. '

“It makes no sense. Its effect on
the reproductive population could
be devastating,” he said.

Gorman recalled that the first
indications of something being
wrong came at the end of July last
year, so the approach of August
makes scientists nervous again this
year

“We’ve seen a number of bot-
tlenose again this year with barna-'
cies on their dorsal fin. The first
and only time we saw that was last
year. I just don’t know if that indi-
cates a similar condition out there.
We’ll have to wait and see,” Schoel-
kopf said.

Ray Birdsong, an ichthyologist
and professor at Old Dominion Uni-
versity in Norfolk, said the deaths

. of the dolphins is similar to mass

killings of inshore fish from dis-
eases of an unknown source.
“Generally these incidents can
be traced to bottom pollutants that
cause lesions on the fish. The bacte-

ria get in those lesions and take
control,” he said.

Geraci’s studies of the dolphins

showed lesions on the body and in

the mouths.

Michalski says, ferrets are animals
he just wouldn't keep at home.

In the April issue of the Journal of‘
the American Medical Association,
two Colorado doctors warned that
ferrets could be vicious and attack
infants without provocation.

Drs. John W. Paisley and Brian A.
Lauer noted three recent attacks, in-
cluding one in which a 3-year-old Col-
orado girl, drinking her bottle in her
crib, was attacked by a ferret. About
40 percent of both of her ears were
chewed off, the doctors wrote.

Still, those who pamper ferrets
with toys such as the $39.95 ferret-

go-rounds, say that they are no
worse than dogs, which occasionally
maul children. In fact, they argue,
there are a lot more dog bites than
ferret bites.

According to Dr. Thomas Eng, an
epidemiologist at the Centers for Dis
ease Control in Atlanta, the major dif-
ference in safety between being hit-
ten by a dog and being bitten by a fer-
ret is that there is a rabies vaccine
for dogs. Until one is available for

ferrets, every time a ferret bites a
human, the only way to find out if it is
rabid is to analyze its brain tissue.

Rabies, a disease that attacks the
body’s central nervous system, is
always fatal to humans.

Au, who sat by the telephone most
of yesterday, fielding calls about Fuji,
said some of those who called yelled
at her for “putting a ferret ahead of a
person," and others praised her for
“notallowing Fuji to die."

Polecats?
Love-Hate Debate

Rages on Ferrets

 

By Mary Jordan

and Pierre Thomas
Washington Post Staff Writers

 

Ferrets are a lot like’anchovies
and the Yankees: People love
themr hate them.

«There is no middle ground,” _

said George Harmon, president of
the International Ferret Associ-
ation. Some people are immedi-
ately “turned ,on to them,” Har-
mon said, while others recoil and
call them first cousins to a rat.

Jennifer Au loves a ferret
named Fuji so much that she
spent five nights 1n a Prince Wil-
liam County jail last week to
spare its life. Tomorrow morning,
shewill return to her cell unless
she hands over Fuji to health of-
ficials who fear it may have bitten
two people and want to test it for
rabies. The test requires that Fuji
be decapitated.

Both of those bitten, including
5vyear-old Auston Jacob Simpson,
are undergoing a series of rabies
injections with potentially harmful
side effects because Fuji cannot
be found.

Au says she gave Fuji to an
anonymous ferret aficionado and
does not know where the foot-
long animal is.

As her friends and health offi-
cials called ferret clubs across the
United States and Canada yester-
day, trying to locate Fuji and of-

Dawn Lank,nuzzli11g a ferret at Petland in White Flint Plaza, says the animals are “fun. inquisitive and adorable.”

fering a reward for its reappear-
ance, the loverhate debate over
the weasel look-alikes continued.
The estimated .1 million ferret
owners across the country (at
least 6,000 are said to live in
Maryland, Virginia and the. Dis—
trict) see ferrets as the pet of the
19803: uncomplicated, distinctive
and terrific conversation pieces.
On July 4, the Montgomery
Ferret Club, which publishes the
newsletter Ferret Times, will
hold a contest in Clarksburg
where owners will parade their
furry pets before judges. The
winner of the Ferret Stroll will be
awarded an American flag.
“They’re fun, inquisitive and

adorable,” said Dawn Lank, a legal -

secretary, who let Slinky, a sable-

colored ferret, climb down her
back and around her waist at Pet-
land in White Flint Plaza yesterday.

Lank sympathized with Au, and
suggested that the bitten child
“was probably harassing” the

. three ferrets at the Docktor Pet

Center near Manassas.

On June 3, Auston was bitten
by one of the store’s three fer-
rets. Two of them were tested for
rabies, and neither had it. The
third was Fuji.

Because doctors could not be
100 percent sure Auston was not
infected with rabies, the Dale

DETROIT NEWS - July 7, 1988

 

I _ Rebuttal

 

Deciding the Fate of Michigan’s Wildlife

As a result of The Detroit News’ articles of June 23
' and June 26 (“House passes changes in state’s Game
Law”; “Management~oriented bill benefits hunters,
DNR,” respectively) about state Senate Bill 374, the
Michigan Humane Society (MHS) has been contacted
by numerous supporters who were aware of and involved
‘ . in its efforts to have this bill amended. They all got the
f impression from these articles that the MHS’ amend-
iu ments failed. Thus, the MHS would like to take this
' opportunity to clarify any misunderstandings these
articles may have inadvertently left in the minds of its
" supporters and readers in general.

When SB 374 was ﬁrst introduced it contained two
provisions that the MHS and its general counsel
regarded as potentially unconstitutional when viewed in
the light of our successful lawsuit to prevent a Natural
Resources Commission-ordered Mourning Dove hunt-
ing season in 1985. The courts ruled unanimously in
favor of MHS’ argument that wildlife are a “natural
resource,” which our state Constitution regards as
belonging to all Michiganians. Thus? since the Natural
Resources Commission (NRC) is a nonelected, guberna-
torially appointed body within the executive branch of

government, it did not have authority to establish a new
' hunting season against a previously protected species.

SB 374 then arrived upon the political scene and

attempted to give the NRC the statutory power to: 1)

decide which wild animals would be protected as
“nongame” species and which would be classiﬁed as
“game” and placed on the state Game List; and 2) decide
if and when new hunting/trapping seasons would be
established against game animals never previously
hunted/trapped. ‘ ‘
When SB 374 was still in the state Senate last fall.
the MHS succeeded in having the bill amended so that
both of these powers were taken away from the NRC
and put back in the the hands of our elected state
legislators and, thereby, the “people” who elect them.
More recently when SB 374 was in the House it was
again changed so that the NRC would have the power to
establish new hunting seasons. ' '
Moreover, the Mourning Dove was added to the list
of game species on the Game List contained within the
bill. As a result of the Michigan Humane Society’s
efforts over the past two weeks, the dove was removed
from the Game List in SB 374, and the Legislature was
again given back its constitutional power to decide the
fate of our state’s wildlife relative to the establishment

of new seasons.

Remote Island’s Vanishingwolves May Be Victims of Virus

Inbreeding, a food
crisis and disease
may all be factors.

 

By JON R. LUOMA

 

VIRAL disease of domestic
dogs may have contributed
to an alarming, mysterious
decline in the wolf popula-
tion on Isle Royale, a remote national
park in Lake Superior, according to
officials of the National Park Service.
Researchers have identified anti-
bodies of parvovirus, a sometimes
fatal disease, in two of four wolves
captured briefly this spring for vet-
erinary tests. The finding may help
explain why the park’s wolf popula-
tion, one of the best known and least
disturbed in North America, plum-
meted from about 50 animals in 1980
to 12 animals in a census last winter.
' According to the park supervisor,
Tom Hobbs, park service officials are
worried that wolves may vanish from
the‘wilderness island altogether. That
concern led to an unusual decision to
allow researchers to trap, anesthetize
and handle up to six of the remaining
wolves this spring. Although scien-
tists have been studying the predator-
prey ‘relationships between the-1s
land’s wolves and moose since, I959,
research has been on a strictly hands-
off basis, usually amounting to obser-

Two of the four wolves captured
and released by the research team
this spring tested positive for the an-
tibody. The two ' animals were
healthy, suggesting they had fought
off the virus. According to Robert
Krumenaker, the park’s resource
management specialist, the presence
of the antibody suggests that a dog
brought illegally onto the wilderness
island by a boater may have carried

 

It is unclear whether the disease is I

still active, but if further testing of
blood and fecal samples suggests that
it is, officials may consider the merits
of a vaccination program. However,
said Mr. Krumenaker, “The only way
we have of vaccinating animals is by
injection, meaning we’d have to lo-
cate them, trap them and handle
them every few years, and we’re not
eager to turn Isle Royale into a zoo."

A research team is also examining
two other possible causes for the de-
cline: inbreeding and a food crisis —
and also the possibility that all three
factors are involved.

Wolves Arrived in 1949

The surviving wolves are descend-
ants of a pack that crossed an ice
bridge, probably from Ontario, in
1949, and immediately began to prey
on the island’s moose. No known new
stock has reached the island in 40
years.

crisis is more complex. The island’s
moose population has actually

“ boomed as wolf numbers have de-

clined, but most of those moose are

young and extremely fit. “If a moose

survives its first year, it’s almost in-
vulnerable until age 6 or 7," said Mr.
Krumenaker. “The wolves could be in
a food crisis because there just aren’t
moose available at the right ages for
the wolves to eat right now.”

Park service officials face difficult "

ish. In general, national park policy
promotes “nonintervention” in natu—
ral wildlife population fluctuations,
and it is possible that for thousands of
years, wolf packs have been cycli-
cally occupying the island, then van-
ishing until another pack crosses an
ice bridge. On the other hand, if re-
searchers determine that a disease
introduced by domestic pets played a
key role in the decline, the service

\

may be more inclined to introduce
new wolves.

Park officials do not plan to intro-
duce any more wolves now to
strengthen the population. “These
animals would have no territory
carved out, and the existing packs
would do everything they could to de-
stroy them,” said Mr. Hobbs. “Any

introduction now would almost cer-

tainly be doomed to failure.”

national wildlife agencies, the
eastern cougar —— also known
as the Florida panther, one of '

chance of surviving the rav-
ages of 20th-century man.

Last month, five sterilized western cou-
gars — three females and two males —-
were released in Florida’s Osceola Nation-
31 Forest to re-establish the cougar in a
portion of their former range in north
Florida.

Western cougars are not in danger of
extinction even though they are closely re-
lated to the Florida panthers. They are be-
ing used to develop the appropriate rear-

that ultimately will be used in handling

“The animals will have radio collars
and will be monitored to evaluate how well
they survive in the Osceola,” said Terry
Kile, Georgia’s state supervisor for the
.DNR’s Give Wildlife a Chance program.

“We’ve already determined that one of
the cougars ventured over into Georgia and
stayed about one week before returning to
the Osceola. The other four cougars have
moved laterally throughout Florida.”

If the Osceola proves suitable, Florida
biologists will then introduce captive east-
ern cougars into the area.

“The cougars will be allowed to roam
for approximately a year, then they will be
recaptured” said Kile. “If they look OK,
then a natural restocking program will be
underway 1n the area.’

Eastern cougars once roamed through-
out the southeastern United States, ranging
from eastern Texas to south Florida. Their
near-extinction in the 19205 was brought
about by a combination of hunting and hab-
itat loss.

Today, the only conﬁrmed cougar sight-
ings have been in the Everglades and Big,
Cypress regions in south Florida.

“The cougar is one of those animals
that requires a lot of habitat,” said Kile.
“They are shy and do not do well around
people. That’s why they need a lot of es-

cape cover -— large areas that man cannot ‘

get into. That’s why they’ve managed to sur-

vive in the Everglades and Big Cypress

areas.” -

It is for this reason that biologists be-
lieve the cougar will do well in the Osceola,
which lies 10 miles south of the Georgia
state line. With the Okefenokee National
Wildlife Refuge and Wilderness Area near-
by, the cougars will have access to habitat
idealy suited for their survival —— nearly

395,000 acres of semi-flooded forests, prai-

ries and swamps composed of pines and
hardwood hammocks.

Kile said that loss of such habitat
throughout most of the Southeast is one
reason the cougar became an endangered
species.

“That and the fact that they have al-
ways elicited fear in humans,” said Kile.
“So what we’ve had through the ages is
people coming across them, getting scared
and then shooting them for no other reason
than fear.”

Cougars feed on small mammals such as
rats and mice, as well as deer. There has
never been a recorded incident of an east-I
ern cougar attacking man.

“If this program works as expected, .
well, it’s exciting to think they might make ,
it back,” said Kile.

“Given proper escape cover, they just
might make it in spite of man.”

Successful ‘Search’ .

By Phil Kloer
Television Critic

Now that the human 200 that was the Democratic Na-
tional Convention has struck the stage and departed, televi-
sion viewers may want to turn their attention to the other
zoo, the one that’s here year-round.

- Channel 2 offers that opportunity Wednesday night
with “Search for the Red Ape,” a local production that
takes us halfway around the world to the jungles of Indone-
sia, then zips back to Zoo Atlanta.

Making the trip, which lasted 31/2 weeks in April, were
actress Stefanie Powers, who’s as well-known for her wild-
life preservation work as for her acting; Dr. Terry Maple,
director of Zoo Atlanta; John Coe, a zoo exhibit designer;
Ken Gould, a biologist at Emory University’s Yerkes Pri-
mate Center; zoo keeper Ellen Bradﬁeld; and Burt Rud—
man and David Lyman, a producer and cameraman, re-
spectively, for WSB.

Together they faced down Komodo dragons and hun-
dreds of Indonesian fruit bats, came face to face With Su-
matran tigers and killer crocodiles, and even survived the
most deadly part of the entire journey: Maple’s jolly, insis—
tent sing-alongs of a song he “wrote,” “I’m Gonna Marry an
Orangutan.” '

Actually, Maple and crew were not out to marry orang-
utans — the red apes of the title — or even capture them.
They made the trek to study the primates in their natural
environment,to help them design an orangutan exhibit at
Zoo Atlanta. At the end of the special, Channel 2 news an-

chor Chris Curle shows viewers the results of their find-
ings.

Stefanie Powers (left) made the trip with zoo director
Terry Maple; Channel 2 news anchor Chris Curle
shows yiewers the results of their findings.

Powers says during the show, “it is the journey more than
the destination that is celebrated.” That sums up this
“Search,” which spends a lot of time wandering down fasci-
nating side streets. We go to a Balinese “monkey temple”
-— a ruin that’s new overrun by monkeys - and a cockﬁght,
watch Komodo dragons eat an entire goat, including the
hooves and horns, and even get fleeting glimpses of a top-
less beach. (Don’t worry, it’s G-rated and very discreet, but

it provided the male members of the search party with

something to look at besides foliage, and cameraman Ly-
man reportedly got some eye-popping footage out of the 28
hours of videotape he shot.)

Miss Powers, who is president of the William Holden
Wildlife Foundation in Kenya, is a passionate wildlife ad-
vocate. Channel 2 was willing to pay her for lending her
name and narrating most of the show, but she did it for
free. Perhaps it was penance for her last miniseries, the la-
mentable “Beryl Markham: A Shadow on the Sun.” At. any
rate, she is now forgiven for that. .

 




The trek was made to study orangutans in
the wild, which will help in designing an
orangutan exhibit at Zoo Atlanta.

“Search for the Red Ape” cost about $50,000
to make, $30,000 of which was put up by the Ford
Motor Co., which is sole sponsor of the special
and is helping fund Zoo Atlanta exhibits. The re-
mainder came from WSB. That’s not a staggering
sum for an hour of network programming, but
this is a local production and quite an impres-
sive one.

WSB is the only Atlanta TV station doing 10-
cal productions at this level, and it’s paying off
for the ABC affiliate. The last local special, “Two
at the Zoo,“ which aired in June, won its 8 pm.
Friday time slot with a solid 28 percent share of
the viewing audience, according to Nielsen ﬁg-
ures. Monica Kaufman’s periodic “Close—up” spe-
cials also invariably do well.

“We don’t bury our local programming,” says
local programming director Mark Engle. “We put
it in time periods where we want people to see
it” That usually means on Tuesday and Wednes-
day nights, the two nights ABC won in last sea—
son’s ratings.

That also means the specials frequently
black out ABC’s best shows, such as “Moonlight-
ing,” “thirtysomething” and “HOOperman,”
which, in turn, can lead to phone calls from up-
set viewers who have seen ABC promotions for
an episode that they miss. '

This is smack-dab in the dog days, however,
when the rerun reigns and any good new show is
welc0me. And “Search for the Red Ape” is quite
good -— well-written, well-photographed, well—
edited. If you tune in midway, you easily could
think it was a National Geographic or PBS na-
ture program.

The search itself was a success. So is the

show.

 

 

 




FT. LAUDERDALE SUN-SENTINEL - July 16, 1988

Residents report wave ,of

By KEVIN DAVIS
Staff Writer

DAVIE —- Renee Webster buried two
of her cats in her back yard this week.
She said she is sure someone poisoned
them.

Tracy Parrish’s puppy had its head
smashed two months ago, and Joyce
Timmons found a cat shot to death last
week.

Dogs and cats have been killed and
maimed at the Modern Mobile Home
Park recently, and distressed residents
say they fear for their pets’ lives.

“I’m hurt,” Webster said. “I don’t have
any kids. They are my family. They were
very close to me.”

Davie Police Officer William Barczak,
who was called to the park on Monday, is

investigating the matter.

“I don’t think it’s very funny. Some-
body is really sick,” he said. “I think
there’s a legitimate complaint there.”

Police have received a number of re-
ports over the past year of animal abuse
at the park, in the 4800 block of South-
west 82nd Avenue, Barczak said. Howev-
er, he said, many cases are not reported.

Dozens of cats and dogs roam through
the park. Many of the animals have own-
ers, but some of them just live in the park
and are fed by caring residents.

But someone or some pe0ple apparent-
ly don’t care much for the animals.

“I had a cat beaten so badly that she
was bleeding from the mouth,” Webster
said. “There is some sicko in this park.”

Webster’s dog, Brandy, had its eye
gouged this week. Brandy, a catahoula

pet killin

g

leopard hound, required an overnight
stay at the vet. Four of her cats have
been injured in the past year and eight
are missing, she said.

Parrish ’s terrier, Penny, was shot with
a BB gun last month and now is missing.
Parrish came home one day in May and
saw her rottweiler puppy, Bull, lying on
the ground.

“He had been hit in the head with

something,” she said. “His skull was

bashed in. Whoever did it is a sick per-
son.”

Timmons, a former veterinarian assis-
tant, said she has treated man; animals
in the park for BB wounds and other inju—
ries. She recently removed three BBs
from her own cat, Jake.

 

Mobile home park
residents report
pet abuse, killings

Many of the residents won’t com—
plain. “They don’t want to get in.—
volved, but somebody's got to get
involved,” Webster said.

Cythia Colon’s cat, Max, sur-
vived several BB shots but has been
missing since June. She. fears the
cat is dead.

“I raised him,” Colon said. He
even slept in the bed with me.
There’s no way he’s not dead. I
loved Max. He was like one of my
kids.”

Colon and Webster say moving
from the trailer park is not an op-
tion.

“There aren’t that many places
that take animals,” Webster said.

Allan Davis, director of Broward
County Animal Control, said inves-

tigators will look into the case. But
because there is a lack of hard evi~
dence and witnesses, the case is dif—
ficult to break.

Police agree that the lack of wit-
nesses to any of the abuses or kill-
ings is a problem.

“I’m going to try to find out as
much as possible,” Barczak said.

"“Nobody seems to want to come
forward to say anything about it.”

According to Sgt. Sherry
Schlueter, the Broward Sheriff’s
Office’s animal cruelty investiga—
tor, the office receives 15 to 25
calls daily about animal abuse
from all over the county. Sharon
Carmichael, the Humane Society's
cruelty investigator, said she re-
ceives an average of 40 to 50 calls a
month. '

THE PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER - June 6, 1988

use charged at San Diego Zoo

Elephant trainers at park accused of brutality

A:

By Kate Callen

United Press International

SAN DIEGO -- The world-re-
nowned San Diego Zoo, for the first
time in its history, is reeling from an
outpouring of public outrage over
allegations of animal abuse and of a
subsequent official cover-up.

Trainers atlthe zoo have accused
their counterparts at a satellite park,
the San Diego Wild Animal Park, of
brutally beating Dunda, an 18-year-
old elephant, during a botched trans-
fer between the two facilities in Feb-
ruary.

The trainers further allege that
zoo executives quashed their at-
tempts to air the incident.

Officials at the zoo and its park
insist that the elephant had to be
firmly disciplined after threatening
her new keepers. The complaints
from former trainers, they said, are
simply fallout from a personality
clash.

Whatever the root cause, the inci-
dent has prompted hundreds of an-
gry calls and letters from members
of the public, officials say.

_ 79" the.,428 species I have to man-

age, elephants attract more atten-
tion, because of their contact with
humans, than any other species,"

said Larry Killmar, curator of mam- -

mals at the Wild Animal Park.

While humans storm over Dunda‘s
treatment, the elephant has been
quietly recovering from visible head
wounds in her Spacious new digs at
the park.

In the absence of eyewitness ac“

counts, deep cuts above Dunda‘s left
eye have been the chief evidence
supporting reports that she was
chained and beaten over a twoday
period.

“I’ve been around elephants a long
time, and I’ve seen trainers who
were rough. But nothing ever came
close to this,” said Steve Friedlund,
head elephant trainer at the zoo.

Friedlund’s accusations were but-
tressed by the findings of an investi-
gation by the Humane Society of the
United States, which called the inci.
dent “an isolated case of animal
abuse.”

Investigator David Herbet said he
based his conclusions on photo-
graphs of the injuries and on testi-

mony from Friedlund and trainer
Lisa Landres.

“The beating was bad enough to
leave marks three months later,”
Herbet said, “and bad enough that
two trainers . . . stuck their necks out
and risked their jobs“ to speak out.

Friedlund and Landres say they
warned Dunda‘s new keepers that
she was skittish and should not be
isolated or tightly restrained. But

' that is exactly what was done, they

say, during a hasty transfer that vio-
lated standard handling procedures.

Killmar, the park’s curator, dis-g
misses those accounts as “hearsay ~
evidence” and says Dunda was“

verely because of her difficult tem- .

is She or Isn’t She? Zoo Monitors
Possibly Pregnant Panda Ling-Ling

If Ling-Ling, the National Zoo’s female giant panda, is
pregnant, she likely will give birth to a cub by the end of this
month or in early August, a zoo spokesman said yesterday.

“If it’s like last year, we’d be looking to see a cub around
July 30,” Robert Hoage said, “but there could be a birth as
late as Aug. 7 or 8.” He cautioned that 200 authorities can-
not be positive that Ling-Ling is pregnant, even though tests
of the panda’s urine are showing the same hormonal pat-
terns she exhibited before giving birth to twin cubs in June
1987. Ling-Ling, 19, and the 200’s male panda, Hsing-Hsing,
18, mated three times in April.

In four pregnancies, Ling-Ling has not given birth to a sur-
viving cub. She also has had one false pregnancy, which makes
zoo officials hesitant to state outright that she is expecting.
One cub born to her last year died within minutes. The other
appeared to be healthy and lived nearly four days—the longest
any of her cubs have survived—before dying of a common en-
vironmental bacteria infection.

IIIE WASHINGTON POST MAGAZINE

CDIJ'T 'rIH EIFIIE

 

 

,3, . t’s been suggested that I try a positive
. argumentative approach for a change.
So before we get to today’s main

event—a ranting, bug-eyed
complainfest against the National
Pork Producers Council for giving in
to societal pressure to “go upscale” to
appeal to upwardly mobile young
adults—I’d like to say something nice
about the grace and class shown, under
the exact same circumstances, by the
Shriners. Yeah, I know: We urbniks are
used to dismissing Shriners as fez-topped
geeks who run amok at conventions
joy-buzzing terrified bellhops. And if you
saw that word cluster on a billboard—
“Grace. Class. Shﬁners.”—the ensuing
laff attack might have you steering your
car in the “Krazy 8” pattern of a Shriner
en parade piloting a peewee BMW Isetta.
But I salute them anyway because
they’ve been holding ﬁrm.
Recently, The Des Moines
Register reported that Iowa Shrine
membership, following a baleful
national trend, is plummeting, mainly
because today’s young men have
many other leisure-time distractions
and would rather spend quality time
with their families than (this next
part is my analysis, not The
Register’s) with potbellied guys
named Gus who know 1,117 “randy”
limericks. Now, if you know anything
about marketing, you can understand
why I lurched when I read this. The
obvious next step for the sagging
Shriners is “market repositioning”—
the yup—chasing, phony-upscaling
product modiﬁcation strategy that
has given us low-sodium “Alpo Lite”
dogfood and Jaymar-Ruby’s soon-to
appear line of (no kidding) belted
Sansabelt slacks. (Note to Jaymar-Ruby:
Would you please, please call these
“W ivzabelt”?) So naturally I feared that
the Shriners’ national withering would
lead to heinous changes in the Shriner

product. Would we see the Shriners’
lovable scooter patrols giving way to
lock-step, fezless, Snugli-toting men’s
marching choruses? I called the Shriners’
Za-Ga-Zig Temple in Des Moines to find
out, a fellow named Albert answered

(“ Yellol”), and when I asked him about
the paucity of young men in Shrinerdom,
he said: “But that’s WRONG! I’m one. I’m
26 years old!” And had he been drawn in
by innovative new programs, a move to
full-size cars, a—

“Good gosh, NOOOO! The National
Temple would never allow THAT!” I called
the National Temple in Tampa, was told
everybody was at the Imperial Council
confab in New Orleans, called there and
found a potentate type who assured me
that no major changes were in the works.
“There has been talk about not using the

Arabic names, not wearing the fez, not
parading, but I think that was pretty much
overwhelmingly defeated. ”(The emphasis
is mine; if I could, I’d run it in all-caps that
glow and throw sparks.)

Semper fi, Shriners. If only (we are
now switching into Nega-mode for the

A Pox on Perky Pig

duration) the National Pork Producers
Council had shown similar resolve. Just
over a year ago, prompted by a steady
marketplace trend of pork getting its butt
kicked by poultry, the Pork Council
launched a $7 million ad campaign built
around the slogan “Pork, the other white
meat.” (This is not to be confused with
the Catfish Institute’s slogan: “Think of it
as chicken that doesn’t cluck.”) Let’s pass
over the fact that this “white meat” stuff
is, according to potentate nutritionists,
baloney. (If you doubt pork is bad for you,
I challenge you to read about Elvis’ final
days or to take a pound of bacon, let it

' “loosen up” in the sun an hour, hold it

over your head and then wring it like a

dish towel.) No, what concerned me

about those chilling words comes more

under the heading of “spin” than
“science.” See, I’m a person who
says, “Let pork be pork,” and my
idea of proper, authentic use of the
meat (barbecue, BLTs and hot dogs
are different, but we’ll get to them)
involves things I don’t want to eat
but respect deeply because they’re a
unique part of our nation’s culinary
heritage. Like: “fruited” pork roast,
studded with jelly bears and glazed
with corn syrup, orange juice and
Crisco.

But of course, that’s just what the
pork folk are trying to get away
from in their manic lunge at the
young-adult palate. And I can’t
blame them, but . . . it irks me.
Now, instead of unappetizing,
muddy-colored women’s-magazine
ads showing the gross pork lumps of
yore, we get recipes for “Pork

Scaloppine” and “Pork l’Orange.” Instead
of good lines like “Eat More Pork Now!”
and “Pork Is Topsl,” we get the awful-1y
clever “We Lead You to Temptation, but
Deliver You From Evil.” And though the
Pork Council insists there is no
cause-and—effect relationship, at the same

time these changes have come on line,
there has been a wholesale chucking of
classic pork-industry penumbrae. Peggy
Fleming is now pork’s official
spokesperson. This when . . . well,
correct me if I’m wrong, but isn’t George
(Goober) Lindsey still alive and available
for plugging work? Three years ago, the
Pork Council’s women’s auxiliary, for
years rightly and wonderfully known as
“The Porkettes,” redubbed itself (2222)
“The National Pork Council Women.”
This year marked the last time a
teen-age “Pork Queen” was crowned——
that nifty ritual will be replaced in 1989
by (double 2222) “The National Pork
Industry Youth Council Program.” And
any day now, the council will start
pushing a lean, center-cut boneless chop
with a name that smacks eerily of the
nation’s whitest collar football team (the
Cowboys) and its yuppiest sport (yacht
racing): “America’s Cut.” Worst of all, the
pork guys (they’re smart, no doubt about
it) have somehow resisted the urge to
embarrass themselves by making
ridiculous outcries about our society’s
widespread negative use of the term
“porker.”

“I think in the shorter—or nearer—
term,” says Mark Williams, one of the ad
masterminds behind all this, “that it’s not,
ah, our highest priority to change slang in
the English language. We think that will
come in time.” And he may be right,
because all the other goals are getting
accomplished. Pork demand has
rebounded. “The pork industry faced
some difficult decisions back in 1986,”
Williams told me. “And their decision was
to step up to the plate, and they did that,
and I think they hit a home run.” Okay,
fine. You win the big game. But one little
guy is leaving the stadium forever—~me,
Tim
consumer (in the “skinny guy” weight
class) of bacon, pork-shoulder sammiches
and weenies. Actually, I’d been edging

WASI‘IINGTON POST - July 2, 1988

- In Defense of Ferrets

Should pet ferrets be banned, as the I).C.
health coinnnssioner suggests? No way! Uur two
ferrets, nearly 4 years old, have yet. to chase
joggers, bite the mailman or bother the neighbors
by barking and sullying their lawns. They haven’t
clawed little children, the screens or the furni-
ture, or yowled to get out, as our cats have (even
though they’ve been fixed). And we never find
paw prints on the kitchen counter.

Ferrets are forever kittens—”when they are not
snuggled asleep, which is most of the time. They
are people oriented: affectionate, playful and
amusing. They are also gentle and tolerant. Our
18-month-old daughter has lugged our ferrets
around ever since she could crawl, often with
painful consequences for the ferrets, but never
for the baby.

In contrast, she has been bitten by two cats,
scratched by four, knocked off the curb by a big
dog on a leash and bitten by another, all in the
past six months. .

All pets should be carefully selected and
trained. Ferrets should be kept indoors, so they

.won't catch ﬂeas or diseases (including rabies, it
seems). I love dogs and cats, but in my experience
they are infinitely more trouble than ferrets and
more dangerous to children. You might as well,
ban cats and dogs.

-—Susan P. Smith

I

Considering all that I have read and heard since
moving to this area, I don’t know why I should be
so surprised at the recent distortion of facts,
gross species-ism and outright prejudice dis-
played by Judge Percy Thornton as well by a Post
editorial writer concerning the “Ferret vs. the
Child" incident.

Comparing apples to oranges, both Thornton
and The Post claim that ferret owner Jennifer Au,
who is said to have hidden her ferret in hopes of
saving its life, has chosen the life of a ferret over
that of a child. Dramatic, indeed, but far from the
truth and hardly a rational assessment of the

matter. Such a statement implies that one or the
other had to die. A fairer appraisal of Au’s action
is that she chose to spare the life of a ferret at the
cost of one child’s temporary discomfort.

Yes, discomfort. The treatment now used for
victims of animal bites is not the series of 12
extremely painful injections in the abdomen that
was once dreaded. Today, the treatment consists
of a series of six injections not unlike any other
vaccine. .

The public was also not informed as to the risk
to which the young boy was exposed. Was this not
also relevant to Au’s apparent decision in having
an anonymous person spirit away her pet? For
example, how long had the ferret lived at the pet
store? How many generations of the animal’s
forebears were bred in captivity? What are the
official statistics for the incidence of rabies in
captive ferrets? Although I realize that facts can
cloud a legal argument and can lessen the sensa-
tional value of an editorial, isn’t it possible that Au
had the presence of mind to consider facts before
taking her action?

I applaud Au's actions. On the one hand, she
had the ensured death of an animal; on the other,
a series of vaccinations for the boy. If the ferret
were examined and found positive, the boy would
still have to undergo the series of shots; if found
negative, the animal would have died for no
reason worthy of having taken a life (actually
three lives, as the judge had the cage’s other two
ferrets beheaded).

Au weighed the odds and risks against the quite
real costs and made a rational, reasonable deci-
sion. I regret that no one else involved attempted
to put matters into such perspective. Perhaps the
nameless Post writer thinks himself or herself
some kind of journalist, using such passionate
words as “truly contemptible," “dangerous,”
“imperative" and "torture.” In fact, such misin—
formation is cruel and deserves no space in our
newspapers much less in our ferret cages.

Black Couple Charges

Biased Dog Dealing

A Maryland couple has filed a civil
rights suit against a Virginia animal
adoption agency and its director for al-
legedly denying them a 7-month-old
dachshund on the basis of their race.

Maryanne and Johnson Aiyegbusi
claim that Anne Lewis, manager of the

Stonehead Dog Ranch in Aldie, barred
them from adopting the dog “solely be—
cause they are black. and because Mr.
Aiyegbusi was born in Africa.

A white friend of the Gaithersburg
couple, Cynthia Armour, agreed to pick
out a dog for them. She paid a $25
adoption fee and made arrangements to
take the dog. According to the suit, the
manager did not object until she. dis—
covered the race and foreign origin of
the dog’s future owners. The Aiyeg-
busis seek a court order requiring the

ranch to turn over the animal to them as

well as monetary damages.

Animal Assistance
for Disabled Veterans

The establishment of two pilot pro—
grams that would provide animals to
assist quadriplegic and other disabled
veterans is the basis of a bill recently
proposed by Sen. Alan Cranston, a Cal—
ifornia Democrat.

The bill calls for 20 veterans to re—
ceive monkeys specially trained to aid
severely disabled people with everyday
tasks.

The cost of a monkey, from birth to
training to placement, is approximately
$21,000 and would be funded by the
Veterans Administration. ‘

‘Ferrets Do Not Make Suitable Pets ’

The continuing saga of the missing
ferret points up the serious problems
associated with the sale of exotic
animals for pets.

Although they are adorable crea-
tures, ferrets do not make suitable
pets and should not be bred and sold
as such. Irresponsible animal breed-
ers are exploiting these animals and
are creating a market for an inappro-
priate pet for which most people do
not know how to care. The breeders
and pet shops who sell these animals
are doing a disservice to people, as
well as to the ferrets.

Biting is not an unusual behavior
for ferrets. Until there is an approved
rabies vaccine and a known rabies
incubation period for ferrets, the fer-
ret will have to pay the ultimate
price-*death-—-every time it nips
someone.

In addition to the rabies risk, there
have been numerous attacks by fer-
rets on babies. Because of these prob-
lems, several state health depart-
ments, the American Veterinary
Medical Association, the Humane So-
ciety of the United States and the
National Association of State Public
Health Veterinarians have recom-
mended that ferrets not be kept as
pets.

Descriptions of the attacks by fer-

rets on human babies are very dis-'

turbing. According to a March 21,
1986, memorandum from California’s
Department of Health Services,
“[Ferrets] seem attracted to babies.
. . . Typically, attacks are made when
parents are absent or asleep; the
ferret escapes its cage and jumps into
the baby's crib. One infant died; oth-
ers nearly bled to death.”

In 1982, the District banned the
sale and importation of ferrets. Al-
though ferrets are no longer offered
for sale in D.C., people continue to
buy them in Maryland and Virginia
and bring them, illegally, into the
District. In spite of the ban, there
have been two reported cases of ra‘
bies in ferrets in DC. One was a stray
animal; the other was an illegally
owned pet. The owner of the pet
ferret and the owner’s daughter had
to receive rabies post-exposure shots.

In view of the public health con-
cerns, it would seem appropriate for
all states to consider legislation to
prohibit the sale and ownership of
ferrets. It’s also time for the irrespon-
sible breeders to stop exploiting these
animals and endangering the public.

Ferrets Can Be Great Pets

The letter |June 23| from Kris‘
tina Harper of the DC. Commis-
sion of Public Health attacking
ferrets as pets ignores the many
thousands of people nationwide
who find ferrets to be excellent
pets. My wife and I have had pet
ferrets for more than four years,
enjoy their playfulness and affec-
tion and feel they are much better
suited for us than dogs or cats.

Kristina Harper claims that bit-
ing is not unusual behavior for
ferrets. It's not unusual behavior
for untrained cats and dogs ei-
ther. She mentions ferret attacks
on infants, as if such attacks don’t
occur with other kinds of pets.
The point is that most of these in-
cidents happen as a result of irre-
sponsible owners. Anyone who
leaves any kind of animal alone
with an infant is inviting trouble.

Ferrets, recognized as a com-
monly kept household pet in Fair-
fax County, are different from
other animals, and owners need
to know this. These thick-skinned
creatures enjoy rough play with—

out hurting each other, but they
need to learn at an early age that
teeth can hurt humans and that
biting—playful or otherwise——
isn’t allowed.

Perhaps most relevant to the
current controversy is the fact
that there is an effective rabies
vaccine for ferrets. The dead vi-
rus vaccine has proven effective

in European clinical studies, and

it's time that it be recognized in
this country to alleviate fears and
minimize the need for humans to
endure painful shots—and for
poor ferrets to lose their heads!
The fact is that most ferrets are
house pets that aren't exposed to
outside animals and in such circum~
stances aren’t at risk of exposure to
rabies. Even so, our ferrets are in-
oculated annually against rabies (us-
ing the dead virus vaccine) and oth-
er diseases because we believe that
responsible owners should take ev-
ery step possible to ensure the
health of their pets.

Using chimpanzees for AIDS study

Conservationists worry research will endanger wild chimps

By Robin Johnston
Staff writer of The Christian Science Monitor
Boston
Conservationists are concerned that pressure to
come up with an AIDS vaccine will reduce the
already thinning population of wild chimpanzees.
Chimpanzees are used for biomedical research in
several countries around the world because of their
similarity to humans —- 99 percent of the chimps’
genetic makeup overlaps with that of man.
Meanwhile, the total wild—chimp population in
Africa, the only continent where the species are
indigenous, has dropped to between 100,000 and
200,000, according to Geza 'Ileleki, chairman of the

Committee for Conservation and Care of Chimpan- '

zees, a group of international scientists and chimp
experts. Fifty years ago there were millions.
. The Jane Goodall Institute, the World Wildlife
‘ Fund, and the Humane Society ﬁled a petition in
November with the US Fish and Wildlife Service to
get the two threatened chimp species reclassiﬁed as
endangered. In the United States, chimpanzees

The service so far has said that the petition
contains “substantial information indicating that
the requested action may be warranted.” It will
issue an initial ﬁnding later this year after receiv-
ing public comment. A ﬁnal decision will be made
after a second round of public comment.

Some scientists say chimps are invaluable for
AIDS research.

“They are the only animals in which HIV [human
immunodeﬁciency virus] will grow . . . although the
animals don’t get sick from it,” says Thomas
Wolﬂe, director of the Institute of Laboratory Ani-
mal Resources at the National Academy of Sciences.
Dr. Wolﬂe says no chimps have died from the
disease.

Animal-welfare groups claim the chimps’ genetic
similarities with man and the species’ intelligence
and human-like behavior make the use of these

California birds get
:help from cousins

The Associated Press

MIAMI -— A ﬂedgling Andean
condor hatched from a Miami egg
,may soon be soaring in California
skies as part of a plan to save its
North American cousins from ex-
; tinction.

An egg laid at Miami’s Metrozoo
and ﬂown to the Los Angeles Zoo
hatched in March, 11/2 months be-
fore its more famous California
relative, Molloko, peeked through
his egg in San Diego.

Only 28 California condors re-
main alive, all in captivity. And be
fore descendants of those precious
few survivors are released again
.—into the wild, biologists will use the
endangered bird’s close relative
”from South America to pave the
way.

The Andean condors are also be-

coming rarer, but thousands of the
great birds still forage freely in the
Andes, Ron Johnson, curator of
birds at Metrozoo, said.
. If all goes well, at theend of the
:summer eight or 10 Andean con-
dors donated by Metrozoo and oth«
"er zoos across the country will be
itaken to Los Padres National For-
;est to begin acclimating them-
selves to the wild.

After three years using the An-

, deans as surrogates, scientists hope
to have learned enough to release
the precious California condors.
. “We can’t afford naive mis-
takes,” explained Mike Wallace,
curator of birds at the Los Angeles
200 and coordinator of the Califor-
nia condor project. “With the small
;genetic pool we can’t afford the
;loss of any California condors. The
Andean project is vitalij, :

At least one of the first Andeans
released may well be descended
from a mated couple at Metrozoo.
The 21-year-old male and his 26-
year-old mate have supplied two
eggs to the California program, al-

though one died in its shell in June. j

Their first Miami hatchling, a '
male, is healthy and being fed with ?

The Andean condors are ideal for

’ the study because they are similar

lhavior and ecology, said Lora La- 3

' Los Angeles Zoo.

aids rare 3

When the Andeansigrow up, they
average an 11-foot wingspread and

a weight of 25 to 30 pounds, John-

son said.

When they hatch, the Andean
condors, unlike the Californians,
can be distinguished easily by sex
-— an advantage for scientists who
must distinguish the hatchlings’ sex
at birth. Only one sex will be re-
leased for the project to avoid
breeding. California males and fe-
males look very much alike, but the
Andean males have a cruncle, a

flashy adornment on their bill visi-

ble at birth.

The Andeans are also darker and
their necks are covered with feath-
ers, unlike the California condors

’whichhave a long, featherless, vul-

ture—like orange neck.

One important service the An-
deans will provide is a clearer idea
of what happens to chicks raised
with puppet dolls as mother surro-
gates. ' '

Later this'summer the young An-

deans will be moved from the zoo

to tents in Los Padres to become
accustomed to the locations. They

*will remain inside the tents until

they are ready to fly.

The birds, equipped with radio
transmitters, will be allowed to fly
away, but scientists will continue

providing food in the tents.

The sun sinks into the Pacific
Ocean and a blood-curdling howl
rises over Mulholland Highway in the
Hollywood hills. Residents quickly
call in their cats and dogs before the
coyotes make supper of them. Ra- ‘
coons clean out a pool full of expen-
sive goldfish and set up house in the
attic. Coyotes, opossums, skunks and
other urban wildlife seem to know
which day the garbage is put out. Par-

A few days ago the Los Angeles

The incidents peak volumes about
the modern Los Angeles area, a re-
gion that is metastasizing into the

‘hills and deserts that once defined the f

boundaries between civilization and
nature. Human and animal habitats
are merging into one, and territorial
conflict is perhaps inevitable.

. “If we would stop encroaching into
their territory they would stop com-
ing into ours,” said Steve McNall, ex-
ecutive director of the Humane Soci- '
ety in Pasadena, near where new
developments in such communities
as Flintridge, La Canada, Monrovia,
Altadena and Arcadia are putting
human nests amid wild ones. Mr.
McNall considers it “a privilege that
they come into our city.”

The Los Angeles Department of
Animal Regulation regularly gets
calls from irate residents whose cats
have become coyote food. It regularly
sets traps and airlifts a menagerie of
wildlife into the remote countryside
for release.

“We’re the only municipality in the
world that relocates wildlife,” said
Dyer Huston, a department spokes-
man.

The department tries to educate
Angelenos about the furry facts of life
in the big city, that the best way to
deter nocturnal visits by wildlife is to

take a few simple precautions, such
as putting lids on garbage cans.

“They would rather not run after
food and get all tired if then can get
fast food,” Mr. Huston said.

i conditioned them to lose their fear of
humans,” she said. “Their fear needs
to reinstilled, and they need to be sent
back to the hills where they belong.”
Ms. Brooks asserts that many of
the misdeeds attributed to coyotes
are committed by packs of feral dogs,
turned loose by their owners, some-
times to interbreed with coyotes into
hybrids known here as “coydogs.”
She offers a pamphlet to residents
with such advice as,‘~“Don’t try to

Rodeo cruelty?

CHICAGO—In your story on
rodeos in a recent Travel
section, the writer alluded to the
fact that rodeo events might be
considered cruel by some
people, but otherwise gloriﬁed
this form of “entertainment.”

Why did the writer fail to
mention that in bull riding,
these naturally placid animals
have to be forced to be mean
, and omery? They fit an animal
with a “ﬂanking strap” which
causes immense pain. The
animal doesn’t buck because he
is wild and ferocious. The
excruciatingly painful strap has
been cinched tightly in the areas
of his genitals and intestines and
he bucks to try to get relief from
the pain.

To make things more
interesting, sometimes a nail,
tack, piece of barbed wire or
other sharp metal object is
placed in the strap. Before the
animal is let out of the chute, an
electric prod known as the “hot
shot” is applied to the rectum to
provoke the animal into putting
on an exciting performance for
our pleasure.

Is there any doubt that this is
cruel? Unfortunately, in our
“civilized” society greed almost
always comes before compassmn

for animals. Terri Rafats

Animals deserve

A couple of weeks ago, I read an
article that you had in your news-

After reading that article, I was

the plant.

When are we going to stop
slaughtering animals, especially in
such a cruel and inhumane way? I

, know that I cannot change the eat-

and that vegetarians are still very
much in the minority, but there
must be a better way of treating
our animals than processing them

in slaughterhouses.

I believe it is our responsibility

to abuse them as we have always

eave house
with 30 dogs

By Janette Rodrigues

and Greg Lopez
News Staff Writers

 

Five elderly mentally impaired
women refused Thursday to leave a
Detroit house where they live with 30
to 40 dogs in conditions described as
not “ﬁt for humans to live in, much
less dogs,” officials said.

The women were discovered
Wednesday when Michigan Humane
Society investigators entered the
home at 874 E. Grand Blvd. under a
search warrant to investigate claims
that two of the dogs could not stand
up, said Tim Clements, a cruelty

investigator for the society.
' The investigators found six dogs
" with severe cases of distemper and

. several dogs with minor symptoms of

the disease, Clements said. Dog feces
were found in the attic of the 16—
room duplex, and the basement was
“like an open sewer” with feces and
sewage leakage. ' . ’

“Every time I opened a door, there
seemed to be a dog tied up in the
room, with puppies in some of the
closets,” Clements said. “I guess the
woman thinks she’s doing right,
,picking up strays, but she is not
being humane.”

On Thursday, the elderly women
would not respond or refused to leave
when a state Department of Social
Services investigator went to the
home, DSS spokeswoman Margaret
Anzinger said. DSS medical services
workers later Thursday could not get
into the house to examine the women
because of the dogs, Anzinger said.

“Tiny” Chipurn, who owns the
house, refused to comment Thurs—

y.

Chipurn had a state license to
operate the house as an adult foster
care home from 1974 until December
1985. That license allowed her to
5;. receive residents’ Social Security and

Supplemental Security Income pay-
ments directly from the government.

DSS took away the home’s license
for violations that included poor
maintenance, the owner’s refusal to
let a consultant see certain areas /of
the home and animals’ access to
certain areas, Anzinger said.

She said the DSS was trying
Thursday to identify the women and
to determine whether they have legal
guardians who could remove them
from the house.

Four of the women are 881 recipi-
ents and have been identiﬁed, but

the ﬁfth had not been identiﬁed, .

Anzinger said. Two women who re-
ceive SSI benefits at. the same ad-
dress were not at the house.

If DSS determines the women do
not have legal guardians, the agency
could attempt to make them wards of
the state, Anzinger said.

“This is a very, very bizarre case,”
Anzinger said. “But it’s also a very
sticky legal situation. We are hoping
to get the women removed (from the
house), of course, but we have a
number of legal steps we have to
take.”

The Humane Society had re-
ceived several complaints about the
house since 1986 but could not get a
search warrant because “the dogs

seemed to be in all right condition,” ,

Clements said.

Investigators went to the roach-
and-ﬂea—infested house Tuesday but
Chipurn refused to let them on the
premises, Clements said. Armed with
a warrant Wednesday, they returned
and removed six dogs, said Shirene
Cece, a Humane Society veterinari-

flaylan the Heroic Police Dog
‘Becomes a Qanine of Leisure

Dylan, the DC. police K-9 corps dog who
saved the life of his handler, Ofﬁcer William
Gregory, during a shootout, was retired late last

month. His front left leg, which was broken by a
bullet, will never again be strong enough for
police work, Gregory said.

Dylan won the hearts of at least 75 newspaper

’ readers who sent him ﬂowers, get-well cards,
; chew-bones and dog biscuits after reading the

story of how he was shot three times April 1 by a

robbery suspect who ran from the officer and dog.
Dylan, felled by one bullet, rolled over and got
’ back up to continue the chase.

Eventually the gunman ran out of bullets, and
he and three companions were arrested.

Dylan was treated at the scene by DC. para-
medics John Proper and Marianne Knopfmacher,
who took the dog by ambulance to Friendship
Animal Hospital in Northwest Washington.

The alleged gunman is jailed in lieu of
$12,000 bond on a charge of assault with intent
to kill, according to court records, while charges
against two men and a woman arrested with him
were dropped. '

Last month, the paramedics were given the

. Washington Humane Society’s highest award for

saving the dog’s life. Dylan was honored at an-
other ceremony by Mayor Marion Barry, who
gave him the “Purple Bone Award” and a citation
proclaiming him pet of the year.

Dylan, a 90-pound, 8-year-old German Shep-
herd, rests at home and visits a veterinarian for
continuing treatment, Gregory said.

The officer has begun a 14-week training
course with a new K-9 dog named Casper I.

A bullet wound is sending Dylan into retirement.

“Dylan is not too happy about Casper,” Greg-
ory said. “They haven’t really had much of a
chance to become friends, because I have to
keep Dylan quiet.”

Dylan is living in the family home, while Cas-
per has to settle for the kennel in the backyard,
Gregory said. ‘

NATIONAL ENQUIRER - July 26, 1988

 

 

 

 

 

 

Three years ago George and Deborah Roeder
took in a Doberman that had been found wander-
ing bruised and beaten in the woods —- and the dog
returned the favor beyond their wildest dreams by

saving their two chil-
dren from certain death
when their house caught
fire. .

“There’s no doubt about
it, without the dog the chil-
dren wOuld have perished,”
declared Fred Guenst, fire
chief in Quakertown, Pa.

The dramatic rescue un-
folded on the night of
March 28, while George, a
truck driver, was out of
town and Deborah was at
her nurse’s job. Their chil-
dren George, 14, and Jessi-
ca, 12, were asleep in up
stairs bedrooms when fire
broke out in the house the
Roeders were renting in
Quakertown. ‘

That’s when Maxine the
Doberman leaped into ac-
tion.

“She woke me up,” said
young George. “She was
barking and whining and
pulling on my blanket. She
was running back and forth
between my bed and my sis-
ter’s bed.

“My bed, headboard and

the room. _

“I woke my sister up —
she was still sound asleep ——
and‘ went downstairs to get a

.bucket of water. Jessica and

Maxine followed me down.
When I tried to go upstairs
with the water, I got to the
second step and couldn’t go
any further.”

Hair on Maxine’s left
shoulder was singed by the
flames, but the children, es-
caped unharmed.

“The dog absolutely sav-
ed their lives,” said Fire
Chief Guenst. “The children
wouldn’t have wakened for
another one or two minutes
and they probably would
have suffered smoke inhala-
tion. And if the smoke
hadn’t gotten to them, the
fire sure would have. All of
the second-floor area where
their beds were was totally
gutted. They would have
been killed, I’m sure.”

Shrimpers Tangle With Rules

On an Endangered Species

 

By Laurie M. Grossman
Washington Post Staff Writer

 

When Alabama shrimpers go fish-
ing, they head into the Gulf of Mex-
ico. And when a federal regulation

:got in their way, they cast their net
gin the direction of the Hart Senate
:Office Building
; The dispute involves sea turtles
and Sen Howell T. Heflin (D-Ala. ),
who has placed a hold on reauthor-
ization of the Endangered Species
Act. The hold has been the only
”obstacle to floor consideration of
".j the measure since April, when oth-
Qer holds were lifted. ,
‘ The gulf shrimping industry
worth $30 million to $100 million iri
Alabama nets more than hors
.’d oeuvres. The National Marine
Fisheries Service estimates that
gshrimping nets drown 12. 000 sea
turtles each year, including 767
Kemp’s ridley, the most endan-
gered.
g In Alabama waters, where res~
Tidents found 50 dead turtles washed
fup on beaches last year, about 120
turtles are killed in shrimping nets
annually according to Charles
Oravetz, chief of protected species
-- at the National Marine Fisheries
Service’s Florida branch.

With a nesting population of
about 600—1111 1ic h is decreasing by
3 percent each year, according to

env1ronmentahsts—the ‘ Kemp’s
ridley is "teetering toward extinc—
tion,” said Brian Gorman, spokes-
man for the fisheries service. The

.four other species of sea turtle in

’ the Southeast, all protected by the
act, are declining at a similar rate.
The federal government imposed a
regulation last summer requiring
shrimp fishermen to install a cage-
like Turtle Excluder Device (TED)
into each trawling net.

i But gulf shrimpers contend that
the devices clog easily with debris
from the ocean floor and attract
sharks, dramaticalh reducing their
:shrimp catch. “With cleaning and

’ ,trying and cleaning and trying we
lose 50 percent of the trawling time
and 50 percent of production,” said
John Ray Nelson, president of Bon
;Secour Fisheries in Bon Secour,
Ala.

g Offshore testing of TEDs, how-
ever, fc-und that the devices rarely
get plugged up and do not reduce
shrimp catches. With the help of
shrimpers, TED designs have been

~ streamlined in recent years to ad-
dress industry concerns, said Mary
Dell Donnell v, director of the sea
turtle rescue fund at the Center for

1 Environmental Education.

i TEDs, made in five approved de-

2 signs that cost $50 to $300, use

‘ slanted bars or mesh grids to de-

. flect turtles out of shrimping nets,

‘. while allowing smaller sea life, such

f as shrimp, to pass through.

Nelson charges that TEDs, re-

; gardless of improvements, damage
? his trade without helping turtles.
; Where the 56 trawlers operating
; out of his dock “catch the majority

industry will go under if shrimpers .
have to cope with the T EDs

“TEDs would devastate produc-
tion in the Gulf of Mexico. We d
ghave to quit,” he said, adding that

area firms would sell their rigs to

foreign shrimpers.

When the regulation went into
effect, Louisiana shrimpers and the
state filed suit. After a district court
upheld the regulation this spring,
the shrimpers appealed and a cir-
cuit court judge suspended enforce-
ment until oral arguments this
month.

» Alabama shrimpers simply called
their senator. Nelson said, “It‘ap-
pears he’s going to do everything
he can to save this industry.”

In 1986, Heflin blocked reauthor-
ization of the Endangered Species
Act in response to the proposed
listing of the Alabama flattened
musk turtle, which was dying in a
river polluted by the state’s coal
industry. The turtle was listed, over
Heflin’s objections.

Heflin said he has nothing against
turtles. “I am not asking that the
turtles be allowed to disappear from
this Earth,” he said in a position
paper. He said he simply aims to
protect shrimpers from having “to
bear a disproportionate share of the
burden of protecting the turtles.”

Illegal trade in turtles and turtle
eggs has depleted the turtle pop-
ulation, but with Mexican marines
guarding the world’s only Kemp’s
ridley nesting site, the threat is far
less significant than dangers posed
by shrimpers, National Marine
Fisheries officials said.

“Shrimping is the single most
detrimental commercial activity to
turtles in US. waters," Oravetz
said. “There are other causes to
turtle mortality, but not nearly the
same level.”

The Endangered Species Act
provides for the listing of animals
and plants threatened with extinc-
tion and funds recovery projects to
boost their populations. First
passed in 1973, the act expired
three years ago, and the House re—
authorized it by voice vote at the
time. The reauthorization calls for a
progressive increase in the enforce-
ment budget, from $56 million this
year to $66 million by 1992.

WASHINGTON POST - June 25, 1988

Md. Couple, Denied a

 

By Paige Williams

Washington Post Staff Writer

 

A Gaithersburg couple has filed a
racial discrimination suit in federal
court in Alexandria against the di-
rector of a Loudoun County animal
adoption agency, alleging they were
barred from adopting a 7 ~month-old
dachshund because they are black.

' Maryanne and Johnson Aiyegbusi

A of 7519 Laytonia Dr. filed suit

Tuesday in U.S. District Court
against the Friends of Homeless
Animals and Anne Lewis, the agen-
cy's chief executive. The couple is
seeking monetary damages to be
determined by the court and a court
guarantee that Lewis be prevented
from committing future acts of dis-
crimination.

Lewis said yesterday that she did
not know about the suit and that
she did not deny the couple the dog
because of their race. She said that
when she learned that Johnson

1

Aiyegbusi was from Nigeria, she
was afraid the couple might return
to that country, leaving the dog
homeless in the United States.
According to court records, the
Aiyegbusis on Feb. 13 asked Cyn-
thia Armour, a family friend who is
white, to visit the agency and select
a small dog for them. Armour, who
lives in Bethesda, said in an inter-
view yesterday that she did the fa-
vor for the Aiyegbusis because
Maryanne Aiyegbusi had to drive

her husband to his night job in

Montgomery County, making it im-
possible to reach the animal shelter
by closing time.

Armour said she went to the ken-

nel and explained to Lewis that she‘

wanted to choose a dog for her
friends. “We talked because [Lewis]
said she usually didn’t allow third-
party adoptions,” she said. “That
seemed fair enough, so I told her a
little bit about myself."

Lewis asked Armour to fill out
adoption forms and pay the agen~

in the

clocking almost 30,000 ,

cy’s required minimum $25 dona-
tion, court records show. Paper-
work done, Armour said she chose a
brown and black dachshund named
Bambi and prepared to leave.

According to court documents,
Lewis then said she had to speak to
the adopting party by telephone to
ensure that the couple, who have no
children, would care properly for
the dog. Lewis told Maryanne
Aiyegbusi by phone that the ar-
rangements had been made and
that Armour could take the dog,
court papers said.

Lewis then asked Maryanne
Aiyegbusi about her last name and
was told by Mrs. Aiyegbusi that her
husband was Nigerian, according to
the suit.

After learning of Johnson Aiyeg-
busi's native country, Lewis “ad-
vised Mrs. Aiyegbusi that she could
not have the dog," court papers

' said.

‘Lewis said yesterday perhaps she
was mistaken when she denied the

couple adeption privileges. “When
people come from out of the coun-
try, it worries me,” she said. “My
thought was that she was from out
of the country and was going back.
It was just a misunderstanding."

Judging the couple according to
the husband’s nationality is “dis-
criminatory,” Maryanne Aiyegbusi
said yesterday. “It’s prejudging me,
according to a certain segment of
people.”

Lewis said yesterday that she
wants to “work something out” with
the Aiyegbusis, and that her prima-
ry concern is for the welfare of her
animals. Maryanne Aiyegbusi said
she and her husband will not drop
the suit.

Riccardo Wright, owner of Stone-
head Dog Ranch, where Friends of

Dear Mrs. Yarbrough:

Thank you for your correspondence regarding Assembly Bill 4500
authored by Assemblymember Sam Farr. I share your concern over
the puppy mill business which transports small puppies to be
sold to the general public. The inhumane breeding, living con-
ditions and hell for puppies placed in California pet stores

Dear Friend:

Thank you for writing to my Sacramento office with your support
of Assembly Bill 4500 by Assemblymember Sam Farr (D-Monterey).

AB 4500 prohibits the importation of immature puppies for sale in
California. Please excuse the delay in responding to your
letter. Due to the large volume of mail received on this
subject, I must respond with a form letter.

The Assembly recently approved AB 4500 and the measure is now
before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. This legislation

is a long needed step in protecting immature puppies from the
rigors and stress of being shipped cross country. This bill
protects puppies as well as consumers.

Again, thank you for writing and taking the time to share your
views with me.

Sincerely,

Wm,

WILLIE L. BROWN, JR.

Ever wonder where the term “pecking

When six ﬂedgling peregrine falcons were
released from their roosting box Friday atop
downtown Detroit’s MichCon Guardian

staged by two old-timers, Bogey and Solo.

Released a year ago, the veteran pair of

Group rides wind in bid to save dolphins

Special to the Globe

SAN PEDRO HARBOR. Calif. — The 180-
foot Divine Wind rides at anchor on a brilliant
day. silent and rusting. while it waits for the
next direct~action campaign.

The conservationist group that crews the.
Divine Wind is pressing for an end to dolphin
kills. saying that US and foreign tuna boats
regularly massacre tens of thousands of dol—
phins in their search for yellow fin tuna.

”The divine wind in Japan - it‘s called ‘ka-
mikaze’ — is the wind that blew away invading
hordes from the shores of Japan." said Scott
Trimingham. a former buyer for toy compan—
ies. "We picture ourselves as a divine wind in-
tervening to protect the whales and por-
poises."

The Sea Shepherd Society. over which he
presides, is inclined toward blockading har-
bors and blowing up boats used to kill sea
mammals. These actions fall under direct ac—
tion. a philosophy that promotes confronta-
tion and action over talk.

“We‘re not big on lobbying; we're not big
on boycotting." Trimingham said. “We’re big
on physically Confronting - so we need gas
money. basically. The problem is it costs
$1,000 a day for gas and oil."

The Sea Shepherd Society does not have
that kind of money right now. Along with oth—
er California environmental groups. it has fal—
len back on the time—tested and cheaper meth—
ods of lobbying and lawsuits in the campaign
to save porpoises.

Act up for review

The federal Marine Mammal Protection Act
is now up for reauthorization in Congress.
where two Massachusetts lawmakers are in
key positions. Rep. Gerry Studds chaiTs the
House subcommittee on fisheries, wildlife con-
servation and the environment. and Sen. John
Kerry chairs the Senate subcommittee on
oceans policy.

Earth Island Institute. an environmental
group based in San Francisco. has placed full—
page ads in newspapers calling for a boycott of
all canned tuna and urging people to sign a
coupon addressed to Studds, saying: “Renew
and enforce the federal Marine Mammal Pro—
tection Act and bring the kill down to absolute
zero. Future generations won’t forgive inac~
tion." ,

Jeff Pike. a fisheries subcommittee aide.
said the subcommittee has not yet taken a po-
sition on lowering the US quota of dolphin
kills. Speaking on behalf of Studds. he said the
congressman is “keeping an open mind in gen—
eral."

He added that a lawsuit brought by Earth
Island Institute in San Francisco alleging vio-
lations of the act and intimidation of federal
observers on tuna boats has worried Studds.
“These are serious matters." Pike said. “We're
going to investigate."

Because dolphins — porpoise is the common"
name for a species of dolphin — course along
the surface directly above yellow fin tuna. they

are often killed.

This relationship occurs only in the eastern
tropical Pacific. stretching from southern Cali-
fornia to Chile. and “fishing on porpoise" ac—
counts for about 5 percent of all tuna caught
in the world. .

Locate tuna with porpoises .

Using this method, fishermen spot a group
of porpoises. and speedboats and helicopters
from the mother ship then herd the po'rpoises.
A mile-long purse seine is set around them.
and as the bottom of the net is closed. some
porpoises escape over the corklines and others
die.

Signed into law in 1972. the Marine Mam-
mal Protection Act mandated that mammal
kills be reduced to “insignificant levels ap—
proaching a zero mortality rate." In 1981. the
act was amended to say that the US tuna in-
dustry was complying with the provision as
long as it used the best dolphin-saving tech-

niques that are “economically and technologi- '

cally feasible."

The act was further amended in 1984 to al-
low a kill level of 20,000 per year. a number
that had been previously set through a federal
permit issued to the tuna industry.

The result has been a dramatic surge in the
number of dolphins killed. according to the in—
stitute's lawsuit. US vessels set their nets on
porpoises about 50 percent of the time in 1983.
said the lawsuit. with that number rising to
nearly 100 percent in 1986.

Conservative estimates are that foreign
kills rose 500 percent between 1981 and 1986.
according to the lawsuit. while statistics from

 

_ \

.the National Marine Fisheries Service show

that average kills on US boats rose from 199 in
1981 to 608 dead dolphins per boat in 1987.

Questioned figures

Pike said he found the 1987 statistic to be
“unfair." arguing that evidence presented in
Senate hearings showed that overall dolphin
kills had gone down last year._

The most powerful piece of evidence so far
in the campaign to stop porpoise kills is a vid-
eotape taken by a biologist who was employed
as a cook last fall on a Panamanian tuna boat.

He recorded disaster sets, in which 200 por—
poises were killed for 10 tuna. Crew members
would stand in the net and. laughing. toss
dead baby dolphins like footballs as they tried
to clear the net. said Sam La Budde. the biolo—
gist.

A spokesman for the US Tuna Foundation,
an industry lobbying group. called La Budde’s
experience an “aberration." while members of
Congress and federal officials say the blame
for high porpoise kills should be placed on the
foreign tuna fleet where La Budde was work-
ing.

Environmentalists have brought forward
evidence that the domestic tuna ﬂeet is also
slaughtering porpoises at an excess rate. har-
assing federal observers. and regularly violat—
ing the act by. for example. using bombs to
herd the porpoises. Referring to power boats. a
federal observer said in an afﬁdavit: “The cap-
tain said. ‘Go right through the front of the
herd. Chop up the leaders. I don't care if there
is an observer on board.m

governmental agency can change the
use of parkland. it has to provide sever-
alﬁpublic notices, hold hearings and
show that what it has planned can hap-
pen only there. Gould says the city
didn’t do that.

He and Persons also say the city
should have followed its own zoning
laws by providing ample parking spaces
to handle the extra visitors the new
exhibit would draw. They say the city
didn’t. .

In May. Schattman gave Persons his
injunction -- sort of. He ruled that
construction already under way could
continue, but that the city couldn’t oc-
cupy the buildings until the legal issues
are resolved. He also said that if the
Zoological Association wanted to build
other buildings, it could, but at its own
risk.

Several people close to the case say
that if Gould gets his way. the shock
waves could ripple far and wide.

For example. the state law uses the
wording “any program or project that
requires the use or taking of any public
land.” The language does not say
whether that use is permanent or tem-
porary.

Schatiman’s ruling conceivably
could force hearings even for short-
term, events, such as the Junior

'- League‘s Mayfest.

Each May, a fence goes up for 10 days
across Trinity Park at the miniature
railroad trestle to isolate a portion of
the park for Mayfest.

Assistant City Attorney Gary Stein-
berger said he could not speculate on
what Schattman’s ruling might be. or
how it might ultimately apply. But he
agreed that the wording of the statute
does leave itself open to interpretation.

“1 would be very concerned about

., any requests for ‘programs‘ that might

come to the city,” Steinberger said.

“They might well require 30 days’ no-

tice and hearings. I think 1 would be

very hard pressed on how to advise my
client. the City Council.”

Said Emerson: “Recreation officials
all over the state are waiting for this
ruling, and if it goes against us. they‘ll
be filing briefs with the appeals court. I
personally have 22 park projects on the
table, and if we have to comply with
thislaw,l don’t know what I would do. 1
don’t know what any city would do.

“For example, I saw some play-
ground equipment in one park that was

unsafe. I ordered it taken down and a

soccer field put in. 1 would have had to

have left that unsafe equipment there
under this law.”

Lee Tennison, president of the Zoo-
logical Association, said: “lt would
open a Pandora’s Box all over the state.

It would cover a whole lot and could be
3 devastating. I know cities all over the
g state are watching this thing."
' And for the Zoological Association.

 




there is the fear of a serious loss and
damage to its ability to raise money.

Schattman‘s ruling isn’t likely to or—
der the razing of any buildings. If it
favors Persons and stands up on appeal,
it most likely would result in the city
being forced to start over under the
state law and local zoning codes.

If, after all that, the evidence shows
the public doesn’t want the diorama, or

, that it could have been put somewhere
else without cutting the park in half , the
City Council could order the destruc-
tion of the exhibit. Short of that, the

‘ council could restrict the area, move
the fence in and reopen a portion of the
south end of the park.

Zoological officials cringe at even
speculating about either of those two
options, particularly the loss of the $1.7
million exhibit.

“I think those are bridges we’ll cross
if we get there,” Tennison said. “My
question would be,..if you move the
fence in, what do you do with the ani-
mals?”

Said Lancaster. “Should it be torn
down, it would be an incredible loss of
funds, to say the least. It would be
demoralizing. . . . You’ve gone all these
months thinking you had approval. It
would be demoralizing to current and
future donors”.

Gould says neither he nor his client -

set out to have the diorama torn down.

To Gould, it’s a park issue, not a zoo __

issue.
“We want it done right. If they give

notice, hold hearings, show there are no '
feasible alternatives, show us how to '
provrde for parking, then we will have =

no problem,” he said. .

. . . . - i,
He said while buildings that have '
gone up smce the temporary injunction 5

was granted by Schattman in May
ought to come down, the others could

stay, but in a smaller area. . :
The zoning issue would be equally ';
far-reaching. Cities, and other govem- '

ments, traditionally have been exempt
from most zoning laws because they are

required to provide certain public ser- ‘

vices, the location of which may not fit '

. the zoning rules — like putting afire
station in the middle of a residential
area. Persons’ suit contended that the.

city needed to provide parking for the '
. diorama under the zoning codes, but :1

didn’t.
“How do you estimate how many
people will use a park to plan parking?”

Emerson asks. “Depending on that, 3
half your park could be taken up. by .

parking. That’s not practical.”

_ Ironically, Bruce McClendon, the ci- :-
:v’s planning director, says Fort Worth

is stricter with itself than many cities
when it comes to obeying its own zon-
ing laws. It follows some of them.
“Most cities don‘t follow it at all. I
don’t know that I’ve ever been in a city ‘
that followed its own zoning code. I
respect this city. It does a better job in

that regard than any urban area I’m

familiar with,” McClendon said.

For Persons, though, it wasn’t good
enough.

Sometime in the next two weeks,
Schattman will decide if it was good '
enough for him. '

he relationship of man
to animal has long been one of sympathy, manifested
in such welfare organizations as the kindly Bide'A’
Wee or the avuncular ASPCA. In the last few years,
the politics of that relationship have been questioned
by a number of new and vociferous interest groups
which hold to the credo that animals are endowed
with certain inalienable rights.

Typically, when animal rights advocates are called
upon by the media to defend their views, they are
seated across the table from research scientists. The
discussion turns on the treatment of laboratory anir
mals or the illegal efforts of fanatics who smuggle
animals out of research facilities via lattervday un’
derground railroads to freedom.

Behind these easy headlines, however, stand seriv
ous philosophical questions: How should we treat ani’
mals? Why do humans have rights and other animals
not? If animals had rights, what would they be? To
address these questions, Harper’s Magazine asked two
leading animal rights activists to sit down with a phi'
losopher and a constitutional scholar to examine the
logic of their opinions.

The following forum is based on a discussion held at the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and
Art, in New York City. Jack Hitt served as moderator.

ARTHUR CAPLAN
is director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the University of Minnesota.

GARY FRANCIONE

is a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. He frequently litigates animal rights cases.

JACK HITT: Let me ask a question that many readers
might ask: Gary, why have you—a former Sue
preme Court law clerk and now a professor of
law at the University of Pennsylvania—devoted
your life to animal rights?

GARY FRANCIONE: I believe that animals have
rights. This is not to say that animals have the
same rights that we do, but the reasons that lead
us to accord certain rights to human beings are
equally applicable to animals. The problem is
that our value system doesn’t permit the breadth
of vision necessary to understand that. We cur,
rently use the category of “species” as the rel—
evant criterion for determining membership in
our moral community, just as we once used race
and sex to determine that membership.

If you asked white men in 1810 whether
blacks had rights, most of them would have
laughed at you. What was necessary then is ner
essary now. We must change the way we think:
a paradigm shift in the way we think about aniv
mals. Rights for blacks and women were
the constitutional issues of the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries. Animal rights, once more
people understand the issue, will emerge as
the civil rights movement of the twenty-first
century.

HITT: I want to see where the logic of your beliefs
takes us. Suppose I am the head of a company
that has invented a dynamite new shampoo. It\

44 HARP?“ MAGAZINE / AUGUST

. gives your hair great body; everyone is going to
look like Lisa Boner. But my preliminary tests
show that it may cause some irritation or mild
damage to the eye. 80 I’ve purchased 2,000 rabr
bits to test this shampoo on their eyes first. Rog,
er, do you find anything offensive about testing
shampoo this way? ‘

ROGER GOLDMAN: As someone new to the animal
rights issue, I don't find it particularly offensive.

HITT: What if the only thing new about my shame
poo is that it is just a different color?

GOLDMAN: If everything else is equal, then I would
say the testing is unnecessary.

INGRID NEWKIRK: I think Roger hit the nail on the
head. The public has absolutely no idea what
the tests involve or whether they‘re necessary. I
think Roger might object if he knew that there
were alternatives, that a humanvskin patch test
can be substituted for the rabbitvblinding test. If
consumers were informed, then no compassion—
ate consumer would abide such cruelty.

FRANCIONE: The problem is that we can use aniv
mals in any way we like because they are prop—
erty. The law currently regards animals as no
different from that pad of paper in front of you,
Roger. If you own that pad, you can rip it up or
burn it. By and large we treat animals no differ'
ently than glasses, cups, or paper.

ARTHUR CAPLAN: I know you lawyers love to talk
about the property status of these little creav
tures, but there are other factors. We treat ani’

mals as property because people don’t believe
that animals have any moral worth. People look
at rabbits and say, “There are many rabbits. If
there are a few less rabbits, who cares?”

NEWKIRK; Not true. Many people, who don’t sup—
port animal rights, would care if you stuck a
knife in their rabbit or dog. They’re deeply of,
fended by acts of individual cruelty.

CAPLAN: Yes, but I suspect that if in your test we
substituted ugly sewer rats for button’nosed rabv
bits, people might applaud the suffering. There
are some animals that just don’t register in
the human consciousness. Rats don’t, rabbits
might, dogs and horses definitely do.

NEWKIRK: Not always. If the test were done to a
sewer rat in front of a person, the average per
son would say, “Don’t do that" or “Kill him
quickly.”

HlTT: Why?

NEWKIRK; It‘s institutionalized cruelty, born of our
hideous compartmentalized thinking. If the kill’
ing is done behind closed doors, if the govern’
ment says it must be done, or if some man or
woman in a white c'oat assures us that it’s for our
benefit, we ignore our own ethical good sense
and allow it to happen.

HITI‘: If the frivolity of the original test bothers us,
what if we up the ante? What if the product to
be tested might yield a cure for baldness?

FRANCIONE: jack, that is a “utilitarian” argument
which suggests that the rightness or wrongness
of an action is determined by the consequences of
that action. In the case of animals, it implies
that animal exploitation produces benefits that
justify that exploitation. I don’t believe in utili'
tarian moral thought. 'lt’s dangerous because it
easily leads to atrocious conclusions, both in
how we treat humans and how we treat animals.
I don’t believe it is morally permissible to ex—
ploit weaker beings even if we derive benefits.

GOLDMAN: So not even the cancer cure?

FRANCIONE: No, absolutely not.

CAPLAN: But you miss the point about moral selfr
ishness. By the time you get to the baldness
cure, people start to say, “I don’t care about ani’
mals. My interests are a hell of a lot more impor’
tant than the animals’ interests. 80 if keeping
hair on my head means sacrificing those aniv
mals, painlessly or not, I want it.” It’s nor utiliv
tarian—it’s selfish. 1

FRANCIONE: But you certainly wouldn’t put that
forward as a justification, would you?

CAPLAN; No, it’s just a description.

FRANCIONE; I can’t argue with your assertion that
people are selfish. ‘But aren’t we morally obliged
to assess the consequences of that selfishness?
To begin that assessment, people must become
aware of the ways in which we exploit animals.

Maybe I’m just a hopeless optimist, but I be
lieve that once people are confronted with these
facts, they will reassess. The backlash that we’re
seeing from the exploitation industries—the

meat companies and the biomedical research
laboratories—is a reaction of fear. They know
that the more people learn, the more people will
reject this painful exploitation.

HUT: But won’t your movement always be hamv
pered by that mix of moral utilitarianism and
moral egotism? People will say, “Yes, be kind to
animals up to a point of utilitarianism (so I can

. Gee use the category of

‘species’ to determine
membership in our moral
community, just'as

we once used ‘race’

and ‘sex’

have my Cancer cure) and up to a point of moral
egotism (so I can have my sirloin).” There may
be some shift in the moral center, but it will
move only so far.

CAPLAN: 1 agree. Gary can remain optimistic, but
confronting people with the facts won’t get him
very far. Moral egotism extends even into hu’
man relations. Let’s not forget that we are in a
city where you have to step over people to enter
this building. People don’t say, “Feed, clothe,
and house them, and then tax me; I’ll pay.” We
have a limited moral imagination. It may be pe—
culiarly American, but you can show people
pictures of starving children or homeless people
or animals in leg traps, and many will say,
“That’s too bad. Life is hard, but I still want my
pleasures, my enjoyments.” '

NEWKIRK: There are two answers to that. First,
people accept the myth. They were brought up
with the illusion that they must eat animals :3;

45

 




be healthy. Now we know that’s not true. Ser
0nd, because of hUmankind’s lack of moral—or
even just plain—imagination, we activists have
to tell people exactly what they should do. Then
We must make it easier for them to do it. If we
put a moral stepladder in front of people, a lot of
them will walk up it. But most people feel pow—
erless as individuals and ask, “Who am I? I’m
only one person. What can I do?” We must
show them.

HI'IT: Roger, I’m wondering whether your moral
center has shifted since we began. Originally
you weren’t offended by my using 2,000 rabbits
to test a new shampoo. Are you now?

GOLDMAN: I am still a Utilitarian. But if the test is
unnecessary or just repetitive, clearly, I’m per—
suaded that it should be stopped.

NEWKIRK: Precisely Gary’s point. Armed with the
facts, Roger opts not to hurt animals.

Enfranchising

All Creatures

HI'IT: Art, what makes human beings have rights
and animals not have rights?

CAPLAN: Some would argue a biblical distinction.
God created humans in his image and did not
create animals that way. That’s one special
property. Another philosophical basis is natural
law, which holds that inalienable rights accrue
to being human—that is a distinguishing fea—
ture in and of itself.

Personally I reject both those arguments. I
subscribe to an entitlement view, which finds
these rights grounded in certain innate proper’
ties, such as the ability to reason, the ability to
suffer—

FRANCIONE: Let’s take the ability to suffer and conr
sider it more carefully. The ability to use lan'
guage or to reason is irrelevant to the right to be
free from suffering. Only the ability to feel pain
is relevant. Logically, it doesn’t follow that you
should restrict those rights to humans. On this
primary level, the question must be who can feel
pain, who can suffer? Certainly animals must be
included within the reach of this fundamental
right.

If you don’t, then you are basing the right not
to suffer painon “intelligence.” Consider the
grotesque results if you apply that idea exclu—
sively to human beings. Would you say that a
smart person has a right to suffer less pain than a
stupid person? That is effectively just what we
say with animals. Even though they can suffer,

" A.GAZINE IAUGUST

we conclude that their suffering is irrelevant be’
cause we think we are smarter than they are.

CAPLAN: The ability to suffer does count, but the
level of thinking and consciousness also counts.
What makes us human? What grants us the
right to life? It is not just a single attribute that
makes us human. Rather, there is a cluster of
properties: a sense of place in the world, a sense
of time, a sense of selfvawareness, a sense that
one is somebody, a sense that one is morally rel—
evant. When you add up these features, you be,
gin to get to the level of entitlement to rights.

FRANCIONE: And I am going to push you to think
specifically about rights again. What must you
possess in order to have a right to life? I think
the most obvious answer is simply a life!

But let’s play this question out in your terms.
To have a right to life, you must possess a sense
of self, a recollection of the past, and an antici’
pation of the future, to name a few. By those
standards, the chimpanzee—and I would argue,
the entire class of Mammalia—would be en'
franchised to enjoy a right to life.

NEWKIRK: The question is, do they have an interest
in living? If they do, then one has an obligation
to recognize their natural rights. The most fun’
damental of these is a desire to live. They are
alive, therefore they want to be alive, and there’
fore we should let them live.

The more profound question, though, is what
distinguishes humans from other animals. Most
scientists, at first, thought that what separates
us from the other animals is that human beings
use tools. So ethnologists went out into the field
and returned with innumerable examples of tool
use in animals. The scientists then concluded
that it’s not tool use but the making of tools.

A Ethnologists, such as Geza Teleki, came back
with lots of different examples, everything from
chimpanzees making fishing poles to ants mak«
ing boats to cross rivers. One might think they
would then elevate the criterion to making tOOIS
in union workshops, but they switched to “lan—
guage." Then there was a discussion about what
is language. Linguists, among them Noam
Chomsky and Herbert Terrace, said language
possessed certain “components.” But when var-
ious ethnologists were able to satisfy each of
these components, the Cartesian scientists be;
came desperate and kept adding more compo
nents, including some pretty complicated ones,
such as the ability to recite events in the distant
past and to create new words based on past ex—
periences. Eventually the number of compo
nents was up to sixteen! The final component
was teaching someone else_the language. But
when Roger Fouts gave the signing ape, Wav

 




shoe, a son, she independently taught him some
seventy American handvlanguage signs.

CAPLAN: One of the sad facts of the literature of

both animal and human rights is that everyone
is eager to identify the magic property that sepa’
rates humans from animals. Is it the ability to
suffer? The ability to say something? The ability
to say something interesting? I think the philos
ophers are all looking in the right place but are
missing something. We have rights because we
are social.

NEWKIRK: Since all animals are social, then you

would extend rights to non-humans?

CAPLAN: It’s not just sociability. Of course, all aniv

mals interact, but there is something about the
way humans need to interact.

Suppose we were little Ayn Rands who
marched about, selfvsufficient, proud, and arror
gant. If we were able to chop our own wood,
cook our own meals, and fend off those who
would assault us, then we wouldn’t need any
rights. You wouldn’t need to have a right to free
speech if there was no one to talk to!

My point is that our fundamental rights are
not exclusively intellectual properties. They are
the natural result of the unique way humans
have come together to form societies, dependent
on each other for survival and therefore respect'
ful of each other’s rights.

NEWKIRK: None of this differentiates humans from

the other animals. You cannot find a relevant
attribute in human beings that doesn’t exist in
animals as well. Darwin said that the only differr
ence between humans and other animals was a
difference of degree, not kind. If you ground any
concept of human rights in a particular attriv
bute, then animals will have to be included.
Animals have rights.

CAPLAN: That brings up another problem I have

with your entire argument. Throughout this ClIS’
cussion, I have argued my position in terms of
ethics. 1 have spoken about our moral imagina'
tion and animal interests and human decency.
Why? Because I don’t want our relationship
with animals to be cast as a battle of rights.
Only in America, with its obsession for attorv
neys, courts, judges, and lawsuits, is the entire
realm of human relationships reduced to a clash
of rights. ‘

So I ask you: Is our relationship with animals
best conceived of under the rubric of rights? I
don’t think so. When I am dispensing rights,
I’m relatively chintzy about it. Do embryos have
rights? In my opinion, no. Do irretrievably co'
matose people have rights? I doubt it. Do menv

tally retarded people below some level of
intellectual functioning have rights? Probably
nOt.

There is a wide range of creatures—some of
them human—for whom our rights language is
not the best way to deal with them. I want peo—
ple to deal with them out of a sense of fairness or
a sense of humanity or a sense of duty, but not
out of a claim to rights.

NEWKIRK: I don’t like your supremacist view of a

custodial responsibility that grants you the luxu-
ry to be magnanimous to those beneath you.
The rights of animals are not peripheral inter
ests. In this case, we are talking about blood,
guts, pain, and death.

FRANCIONE: Art, when you start talking about obli—

gations without rights, you can justify violations
of those obligations or intrusions more easily by
spinning airy notions of utility. The reason
many of our battles are played out in rights lan’
guage is because our culture has evolved this nor
tion that a right is something that stands

W hat separates humans

from animals? The
ability to say something?

between me and an intrusion. A right doesn’t
yield automatically because a stronger party
might benefit.

If a scientist could cure cancer—without
fail—by subjecting me against my will to a painr
ful experiment, it wouldn’t matter. I have a
right not to be used that way.

CAPLAN: Ironically, I agree with you. That's exact—

ly the role that rights language plays. It defines
the barriers or lines that can’t be crossed. But if
you hand out rights willyvnilly, you lose that
function.

NEWKIRK: When should we stop?

CAPLAN: I’m not sure I know the answer, but if you
cheapen the currency of rights language, you’ve
got to worry that rights may not be taken serir
ously. Soon you will have people arguing that

trees have rights and that embryos have rights.

And the tendency would be to say, “Sure, they

have rights, but they are not important rights.”

NEWKIRK: Art, wouldn’t you rather err on the side
of giving out too many rights rather than too

few?

CAPLAN: NO.

NEWKIRK: So, according to your view, maybe we

should take away some of the rights we’ve al'

An animal can wish to
have life, liberty, and
the pursuit of happiness.
An anencephalic

baby cannot

ready granted. After all, granting rights to
blacks and women has deprived society of very
important things, such as cheap labor. That a
society evolves and expands its protective shield
should not daunt us. That’s like saying, ifI con«
tinue to be charitable, my God, where will it
ever end?

CAPLAN: It may not be rights or bust. There may be
other ways to get people to conduct themselves
decently without hauling out the heavy artillery
of rights language every time.

NEWKIRK: People have to be pushed; society has to
be pushed. Those who care deeply about a par«
ticular wrong have to pressure the general pova
lation. Eventually a law is passed, and then
adjustments are made to correct past injustices.
You have to bring these matters to a head.

HITT: Roger, from a constitutional perspective, do

you think that rights are cheapened when they
are broadened?

GOLDMAN: When you put it in a constitutional
context, you invite conflict. That's inevitable.
If you have a free press, you're going to have fair
trial problems. If you start expanding rights of
liberty, you run up against rights of equality. I
don’t think expansion cheapens them, but by
elevating animal rights to a constitutional issue,
you certainly multiply the difficulties.

HITT: You could argue that conflict strengthens
rights. If you had no conflict over free speech,
would we have the solid right to free speech that
we have today?

GOLDMAN: It depends on who wins. What would
happen if free speech lost?

FRANCIONE: Roger, you will have conflict and diffi’
culties whether you cast our relationship with
animals as one of obligations or rights. The real
question is, are those obligations enforceable by
state authority? If they are, there will be clashes
and we will turn to the courts for resolution.

CAPLAN: Gary, I would like those obligations en;
forced by the authority, if you like, of empathy,
by the power of character. What matters is how
people view animals, how their feelings are
touched by those animals, what drives them to
care about those animals, not what rights the
animals have.

FRANCIONE: I agree that you don’t effect massive
social change exclusively through law, but law
can certainly help. That’s a classic law school
debate: Do moral perceptions shape law or does
law shape moral perceptions? It probably goes
both ways. I have no doubt that we could effect
a great change if animals were included within
our constitutional framework.

NEWKIRK: Great changes often begin with the law.
Remember the 17605 case of the West Indian
slave jonathan Strong. Strong’s master had
abandoned him in England after beating him
badly. The judge in that case feared the conse—
quences of emancipating a slave. But the judge
freed Strong and declared, “Let justice prevail,
though the heavens may fall.”

with Mojo, and she signs back, “I want a baby.”
Roger, are we under any obligation to grant her
wish?

GOLDMAN: Since I am not persuaded animals have
any rights, I don’t believe there is any obli’
gation.

HITT: Doesn’t it follow that if this chimpanzee can
articulate a desire to have a child—a primal dec
sire and one that we would never forbid hu—
mans— we have some obligation to fulfill it?

CAPLAN: You are alluding to a foundation for rights
that we haven’t yet discussed. ls the require—
ment for possessing a right the ability to claim it?
That is, in order to hold a right to life, one must
be able to articulate a claim to life, to be able to
say, “I want to live.”

There may be animals that can get to that
level, and Mojo may be one of them. Neverthe
less, I don’t buy into that argument. Simply be,
ing able to claim a right does not necessarily
entail an obligation to fulfill it.

FRANCIONE: But Moio does have the right to be left
alone to pursue her desires, the right not to be in
that cage. Aren’t we violating some right of Mor
jo’s by confining her so that she cannot satisfy
that primal desire?

HITT: Is this a fair syllogism? Mojo wants to be free;
a right to freedom exists if you can claim it;
ergo, Mojo has a right to be free. Does the abili’
ty to lay claim to a right automatically translate
into the possession of such a right?

CAPLAN; You don’t always generate obligations and
duties from a parallel set of rights, matching one
with another.

Look at the relationship that exists between
family members. Some people might argue that
children have certain rights to claim from their
parents. But there is something wrong with that
assumption. Parents have many obligations to
their children, but it seems morally weird to re
duce this relationship to a contractual model.
It’s not a free-market arrangement where you
put down a rights chit, I put down an obligation
chit, and we match them up.

My kid might say to me, “Dad, you have an
obligation to care for my needs, and my need
today is a new car." I don’t enter into a negotia’
tion based on a balancing of his rights and my
duties. That is not the proper relationship.

NEWKIRK: But having a car is not a fundamental
right, whereas the right not to be abused is. For
example, children have a right not to be used in
factories. That right had to be fought for in ex—

\

actly the same way we are fighting for animal
rights now.

CAPLAN: Gary, I want to press you further. A baby
needs a heart, and some scientist believes the
miniature swine’s heart will do it.

FRANCIONE: Would I take a healthy pig, remove its
heart, and put it into the child? No.

CAPLAN: I am stymied by your absolutist position
that makes it impossible even to consider the
pig as a donor.

FRANCIONE: What if the donor were a severely rer
tarded child instead of a pig?

CAPLAN: No, because I’ve got to worry about the
impact not only on the donor but on society as
well.

FRANCIONE: Art, assume I have a three'year'old
prodigy who is a mathematical wizard. The
child has a bad heart. The only way to save this
prodigy is to take the heart out of another child.
Should we consider. a child from a low socio
economic background who has limited mental
abilities?

CAPLAN: You’re wandering around a world of
slopes, and I want to wander around a world of
steps. I have argued strongly in my writing that
it is possible for a human being-——specifically an
infant born with anencephaly, that is, without
most of its brain—to drop below the threshold
of a right to life. I think it would be ethical to
use such a baby as a source for organ transplants.
I do not believe there is a slippery slope between
the child born with most of its brain missing and
the retarded. There are certain thresholds below
which one can make these decisions. At some
point along the spectrum of life—many people
would say a pig, and I would go further to in’
clude the anencephalic baby—we are safely

below that threshold.

FRANCIONE: You can’t equate the pig with the an'
encephalic infant. The anencephalic child is
not the subject of a life in any meaningful sense.
That is to say, it does not possess that constellav
tion of attributes—sense of self—awareness, an'
ticipation of the future, memory of the past—
that we have been discussing. The pig is clearly
the subject of a meaningful life.

CAPLAN: But if it’s a matter of saving the life of the
baby, then I want a surgeon to saw out the pigs

heart and put it in the baby's chest.

NEWKIRK: The pig can wish,to have life, liberty,

 




50

and the pursuit of happiness, and the anencev
phalic baby cannot.

CAPLAN: But you must also consider the effect on
others. I don’t think it’s going to matter very
much what the pig’s parents think about that
pig. Whereas the child’s parents care about the
baby, and they don’t care about the pig.

FRANCIONE: Then you change their reaction.

CAPLAN: I don’t want to change their reaction. I
want human beings to care about babies.

NEWKIRK: Like racism or sexism, that remark is
pure speciesism.

CAPLAN: Speciesism! Mine is a legitimate distinc—
tion. The impact of this transplant is going to be
different on humans than on lower animals.

NEWKIRK: “Lower animals.” There comes species,
ism rearing its ugly head again. Look, Art, I as’
sociate with the child; I don’t associate with the
pig. But we can’t establish why that matters ex,
cept that you are human and I am' human.

If a building were burning and a baby baboon,
a baby rat, and a baby child were inside, I’m sure
I would save the child. But if the baboon mothv
er went into the building, I’m sure she would
take out the infant baboon. It’s just that there is
an instinct to save yourself first, then your ima
mediate family, your countrymen, and on to
your species. But we have to recognize and re
ject the self’interest that erects these barriers
and try to recognize the rights of others who
happen not to be exactly like ourselves.

CAPLAN: I think you can teach humans to care
about the pig. The morally relevant factor here
is that you will never get the pig to care about
me.

NEWKIRK: Not true, Art. Read John Robbins’s new
book, Diet for a New America, in which he lists
incidents of altruism by animals outside their
own species. Everybody knows about dolphins
rescuing sailors. Recently a pig rescued a child
from a frozen lake and won an award!

CAPLAN: To the extent to which you can make ani—
mals drop their speciesism, perhaps you will be
persuasive on this point.

NEWKIRK: Art, if you don’t recognize my rights,
that’s tough for me. But that doesn’t mean my
rights don’t exist.

FRANCIONE: If blacks, as a group, got together and
said, “We’re going to make a conscious decision

HARPER‘S MAGAZINE / AUGUST

I

to dislike non—blacks,” would you say that black
people no longer had rights?

CAPLAN: No, but I would hold them accountable
for their racism. I could never hold a pig act
countable for its speciesism. And I am never
going to see a meeting of pigs having that kind
of conversation.

NEWKIRK: That happens when the Ku Klux Klan
meets, and the ACLU upholds their rights.

CAPLAN: The difference is that there are certain
things I expect of blacks, whites, yellows—of
all human beings and maybe a few animals. But
I am not going to hold the vast majority of anir
mals to those standards.

NEWKIRK: So the punishment for their perceived
deficienciesa—which, incidentally, is shared by
the human baby—is to beat them to death.

CAPLAN: I didn’t say that. I am trying to reach for
' something that isn’t captured by the speciesist
charge. The difference between people and anir
mals is that I can persuade people. I can stimu’
late their moral imaginations. But I can’t do that
with most animals, and I want that difference to
count

A World With No

Dancing Bears

HITT: How would you envision a society that emv
braced animal rights? What would happen to

pets?

NEWKIRK: I don’t use the word “pet." I think it’s
speciesist language. I prefer “companion ani—
, mal." For one thing, we would no longer allow
breeding. People could not create different
breeds. There would be no pet shops. If people
had companion animals in their homes, those
animals would have to be refugees from the aniv
mal shelters and the streets. You would have a
protective relationship with them just as you
would with an orphaned child. But as the sure
plus of cats and dogs (artificially engineered by
centuries of forced breeding) declined, eventu«
ally companion animals would be phased out,
and we would return to a more symbiotic rela—
tionship—enjoyment at a distance.

FRANCIONE: Much more than that would be phased
out. For example, there would be no animals
used for food, no laboratory experiments, no fur
coats, and no hunting.

GOLDMAN: Would there be zoos?

 




 

 

FRANCIONE: No zoos.
HITT: Circuses?

FRANCIONE: Circuses would have to change. Look,
right now we countenance the taking of an aniv
mal from the wild—a bear—dressing that bear
in a skirt and parading it in front of thousands
of people while it balances a ball on its nose.
When you think about it, that is perverted.

HITT: Let’s say that your logic prevails. People are
sickened by dancing bears and are demanding a
constitutional amendment. What would be the
language of a Bill of Rights for animals?

NEWKIRK: It already exists. It’s “life, liberty, and
the pursuit of happiness." We just haven’t er
tended it far enough.

GOLDMAN: I am assuming your amendment would
restrict not only government action but private
action as well. Our Constitution restricts only
government action. The single exception is the
Thirteenth Amendment, which prohibits both
the government and the individual from the
practice of slavery.

HI'iT: To whom would these rights apply? Would
they apply among animals themselves? Does the
lion have to recognize the gazelle’s right to life?

NEWKIRK: That’s not our business. The behavior of
the lion and the gazelle is a “tribal” issue, if you
will. Those are the actions of other nations, and
we cannot interfere.

GOLDMAN: What if we knew the lion was going to
kill the gazelle—would we have an obligation
to stop it?

NEWKIRK: It’s not our business. This amendment
restricts only our code of behavior.

HITT: But what Roger is asking is, should the
amendment be so broad as to restrict both indiv
vidual and government action?

FRANCIONE: It should be that broad. Of course, it
would create a lot of issues we would have to
work out. First, to whom would we extend
these rights? I have a sneaking suspicion that
any moment someone in this room will say,
“But what about cockroaches? Will they have
these rights? Do they have the right to have
credit cards?” Hard questions would have to be
answered, and we would have to determine
which animals would hold rights and how to
translate these rights into concrete protections
from interference.

NEWKIRK: The health pioneer W. K. Kellogg limit’
ed it to “all those with faces." If you can look
into the eyes of another, and that other looks
back, that’s one measure. ,

So the amendment shouldn’t be limited, as
some animal rights advocates think, to mamr
mals, because we know that birds, reptiles, in—
sects, and fishes all feel pain. They are capable
of wanting to be alive. As long as we know that

I don’t use the word
‘pet.’ I think it’s
speciesist language. I
prefer ‘companion
animal’

they have these primal interests, then I think
we need to explore down the line—if we think
it is down.

GOLDMAN; Let me go up the line. What about
humans?

NEWKIRK: They would be just another animal in
the pack.

GOLDMAN: But your amendment would massively
expand the reach of the Constitution for hu—
mans. For example, the Constitution does not
require states to provide rights for victims of
crime.’Under your proposal, if a state decrimi—
nalized adultery, shoplifting, or even murder,
the victim‘s constitutional rights would be vio'

lated.

CAPLAN: And if we take the face test, how is that
going to affect the way we treat the unborn?
Must we enfranchise our fetuses? That’s going to

be the end of abortion.

FRANCIONE: Not necessarily. I am fairly comfort;
able with the notion that a fetus does not have a
right to life. But that is not to say that a fetus
doesn’t have a right to be free from suffering. Fe

tuses do feel pain and they ought to be free from
suffering. But it doesn’t make sense to talk about
a fetus having a sense of the past, anticipation
of the future, and a sense of interaction with
others.

CAPLAN: But a mouse?
FRANCIONE: Sure.

CAPLAN: I guess we can experiment on and eat all
the animal fetuses we want.

FRANCIONE: I didn’t say you had a right to inflict
pain on animal fetuses. I don’t think you have a
right to inflict pain on human fetuses.

CAPLAN: Are you suggesting that we can’t inflict
pain, but we can kill them?

NEWKIRK: You are talking about the manner in
which abortions are currently performed, not
whether they should be performed. Our stan—
dard of lack of suffering holds up if you apply it
across the board, for human and non'human
fetuses.

GOLDMAN: Let me see if I can bring together those
who advocate animal welfare with those who
believe animals hold rights. What about a dif
ferent amendment, similar to the difference be-
tween the Thirteenth Amendment, which is an
absolute ban on slavery, and the Fourteenth
Amendment, which bans discrimination, but
not absolutely. In faCt, the Fourteenth allows us
to take race into account sometimes, such as af-
firmative action. Do the animal rights activists
see a role for a limited amendment similar to the
Fourteenth? It would broadly protect animals
from unnecessary suffering, but allow for some
medical experiments.

FRANCIONE: Does your amendment simply expand
the word “persons” in the Fourteenth Amend—
ment to include animals?

GOLDMAN: No, but it is modeled on Fourteenth
Amendment jurisprudence. It would not permit
experimentation on animals unless necessary for
a compelling need.

FRANCIONE: I would favor this approach if the ex«
perimenter had the burden to show the compel,
ling need. I would have only one problem with
adjudication under this compelling-need stan—
dard. My fear is that the balance would always
favor the biomedical research community. Ev—
eryone agrees that no one should needlessly use
animals in experimentation. Yet we all know
that millions of animals are being used for frivo'

lous purposes. That is because the biomedical
researchers have persuaded enough people that
their experiments are so important they have
become “compelling” by definition.

GOLDMAN: Of course the difference with this con—

stitutional amendment is that it wouldn’t pass
unless two’thirds of Congress and threevfourths
of the states backed it. So if we’re projecting a
hundred years from now, you won’t have the
problem of science experts always prevailing.

FRANCIONE: Roger, I would retire tomorrow if I

could get your amendment. The problem is that
our society economically benefits from exploita—
tion. The animal industries are so strong that
they have shaped an entire value system that jus—
tifies and perpetuates exploitation. So I am not
sure your compellingvneed test would result in
anything substantially different from what we
have now. That’s why I favor a hard rights no—
tion, to protect the defenseless absolutely. As
soon as you let in the “balancers,” people such
as Art Caplan, you've got trouble.

CAPLAN: The problem with your constitutional

amendment is that, finally, it is irrelevant to
human behavior. When the lawyers, the consti—
tutional adjudicators, and the Supreme Court
justices aren’t there, when it’s just me and my
companion animal or my bug in the woods,
where are the animal’s rights then?

There was a time when I was a little boy run!
ning around in the woods in New England. It
was just a bunch of japanese beetles in a jar and
me. The question was: How is little Art going
to deal with those Japanese beetles? Pull their
wings off? Never let them out of the jar? Step on
them? What do I do with those bugs? What do I
think of bugs? No Supreme Court justice is gov

‘ ing to tell me what to do with them.

NEWKIRK: A lot of these conflicts of moral obligav

tion result from the wide variety of unnatural re—
lationships we have with animals in the first
place—whether it’s little Art with his jar of Japv
anese beetles, or the scientist in the lab with his
chimpanzee, or any one of us at home with a
cat. Just take the single issue of the sterilization
of pets. We now have burdened ourselves with
the custodial obligation to sterilize thousands of
animals because we have screwed up their repro-
ductive cycles so much through domestication
and inbreeding that they have many more
offspring than they normally would. What
would happen if we just left animals alone, to
possess their own dignity? You know, you men
tioned earlier that there is something cruel in
the lion chasing down and killing the gazelle.
Well, nature is cruel, but man is crueler yet. I

happy chatter wasn’t real. It was
dubbed in by Mel Blane.

O’Barry loves dolphins, yes, but
he doesn’t romantieize them.

“After spending all these years
with dolphins,” he says, “I have
ﬁgured out exactly what they are
saying to us. They are saying:
‘Give me another fish!’ ”

Twenty years ago O’Barry was
just a young man fresh out of the
Navy, feeling lucky to have landed
a dream job at the Miami
Seaquarium. He worked on boats
that captured dolphins, then
helped to train them. When
“Flipper” began, he became a full—
time trainer of the ﬁve female
dolphins who together were the
star of the show.

O’Barry grew fond of the
dolphins. He lived in a trailer next
to the lagoon where they were
kept, and spent so many hours
underwater with them, working on
tricks or just daydreaming, that his
hair in those days was perennially
green.

On the other hand, dolphins
were business to him. He knew
how to cut off his feelings. Or
thought he did. .

Once, while hunting a rare
albino dolphin off the coast of
North Carolina, O’Barry and the
two other hunters came upon a
. dolphin that had gotten tangled in
their nets and drowned.

The locals were already angry
about the hunt for their albino. A
dolphin body washing ashore
could be a public relations
disaster. .

So O’Barry slipped into the

water and swam over to the
corpse. He untangled the dolphin.
and with his knife sliced open the ,
body. The water turned black with
blood, and the corpse, its air sacks
punctured, sank out of sight.

He put the experience out of his
mind as best he could when he
was working with the “Flipper”
dolphins. His strategy, after all,
was to make them think he was
one of them. When he had to net.
one of the dolphins to move it to
a filming location, O’Barry

 

’You can’t just take a
highly intelligent
animal . . . then stick
it in a tank.’

 

pretended that he, too, was caught
in the trap. He spoke soothingly
to the dolphin to keep it calm,
like a prisoner consoling another
inmate through the bars. O’Barry
built up a relationship with each
animal, and that, more than the
reward of a piece of fish, was what
kept them doing the tricks the
television cameras required.

It wasn’t until the series was
canceled in 1970 that O’Barry
realized how profoundly those
years with the “Flipper” dolphins
had affected him.

All five dolphins were summarily
retired. O’Barry’s favorite, Kathy,
was consigned to a tank at the
Seaquarium.

One day soon after, he got a call

from the Seaquarium. Kathy was
sick. When O’Bariy got there, she
was covered in blisters: She had
been lying listlessly in the sun,
which had baked her skin. He
slipped into the tank and cradled
her. She was already dead.

“She commit:ted suicide,” says
O‘Barry. “That’s the way 1 see it.
She was so bored that she went
crazy.

“You can‘t just take a highly
intelligent animal and lavish
attention on it for five years and
then stick it in a tank like that.”

The next day, O’Barry bought a
pair of bolt cutters.

“I wanted to release every
captive dolphin in the world,” he
says. His first stop was the pen of
an ailing, malnourished dolphin
named Charlie Brown, who was
being kept in a shoreline pen by a
private owner.

O’Barry cut a hole for the
dolphin, but it refused to come
out. Soon both O’Barry and
Charlie Brown were locked up:
Charlie Brown in a patched—up
pen, O‘Barry in prison, charged
with trespassing. After a brief
ﬂurry of publicity, the charges
were dropped.

From “Flipper,” O’Barry turned
to the risky life of an underwater
stunt man. (He blew off the tip of
his right thumb when an
underwater shotgun meant for
protection against sharks
misfired.) But he continued to
worry about. dolphins, working
with several of his show business
contacts, including singer Stephen
Stills, to stage benefits for the

animals.

But the Joe and Rosie effort has
been the first long-term dolphin
project for O’Barry since his
“Flipper” days. He is hoping to
sustain the momentum. He has
written an autobiography, “Behind
the Dolphin Smile,” published by
Algonquin Books. An Australian
conservation group has recruited
him to untrain four captive
dolphins in that country. The
dolphins, which will be released off
the coast of New South Wales, are
offspring of bottlenose dolphins he
caught 20 years ago in Key
Biscayne, Fla.

O’Barry has also established a
nonprofit corporation, the
Dolphin Project. He wants to
explore the possibility of creating
a new kind of zoo for dolphins in
which the people would be
enclosed and the dolphins in a
natural environment; and he hepes
to establish a permanent halfway
house for reintroducing dolphins
to the wild.

So far, the Dolphin Project has
a limited membership: Ric
O’Barry.

O‘Barry admits that he still feels
like that solitary crusader with the
bolt cutters. “l have spent so
much time with dolphins in my
life that I see things from their
point of view,” he says.

“It seems obvious to me that we
owe it to them to have a humane
way of returning captive dolphins
to the sea. But when 1 say that to
some people, they look at me like
I’m some kind of maniac."

A recent Reader's Digest article by Dr.
Robert J. White claimed to state the
“facts" about animal research. But Dr.
White stated more propaganda than fact.
He failed to mention how useless, mis-
leading, costly, and cruel animal experi-
ments often are.

Dr. White also failed to mention that he
spent nearly 20 years conducting contro
versial head transplants, sewing the living
severed heads of dogs or monkeys onto the
headless bodies of other dogs or monkeys,
with no practical results. Says Dr.
Catherine Roberts, “The details of his
experiments are so horrifying that they
seem to reach the limits of scientific

depravity." A fellow brain surgeon says‘

White's work has “a practical value of
zero.“ The American Medical Association
says "little or no scientiﬁc justiﬁcation for
this kind of experimentation" exists, and
the British Medical Association says
White‘s research goes “too far.“ Yet we‘ve
had nearly twenty years of head trans-
plants by Dr. White!

It’ s not surprising that a man who says
that “animals, in my judgment, have no
rights" is speaking out in favor of the
unregulated use of animals in experi-
ments, particularly when his employer,
Case Western Reserve in Cleveland Ohio
has just announced plans to build a $60
million biomedical research facility where
countless animals will be conﬁn

Dr. White and others whose careers
depend on experimenting on animals want
to scare you into thinking that we must
choose between people and animals. To
hear them tell it, we'll all die tomorrow if
animal experiments are regulated or
ended. But blind trust in the people who
proﬁt most from animal research misleads
and scares the public and keeps us in the
dark ages of science.

We believe you should know what the
approximately 60 million animals used
and killed in experiments each year cannot
tell you. Their side of the story rs important
to learn, because their lives and yours are
threatened daily by animal experiments.

TRUE OR FALSE?

1. “Animal research is necessary to
advance human health."

The use of nonhuman animals to
develop drugs and treatments for human
beings is a two-sided coin: Human and
nonhuman animals respond similarly to
treatments in some cases, but most often
they do not. It is probable that drugs and
treatments that might help people today
were never developed because tests on
other species were not successful. The
physiological differences between differ-
ent species and the fact that the stress and
conﬁnement suffered by animals in labora-
tories does in fact alter reactions to the
experiments, makes animal experiments
highly unreliable.

Many drugs developed in animals
including DES thalidomide, and many
arthritis medicines, actually harm human
beings. Some drugs developed using ani-
mals cause such severe side effects in
humans after being released on the market
that consumers must initiate lawsuits to
have their use banned.

History shows that the decline of many
diseases, including tuberculosis, pneumo
nia, measles, whooping cough and scarlet
fever resulted more from increased
standards of hving, better diets, improved
sanitation like clean water and uncon-
taminated foods, and natural immunities
than from drugs and vaccines. ‘

2. ”Viable alternatives to animal
research do not yet exist”

There are many alternatives to animal
research, the most obvious being the study
of illness in human under controlled
conditions (clinicalsnr ',es) and the study
of naturallyoccurnng disease patterns in
human populations (epidemiology). People
in need of immediate health care currently
are denied the opportunity to help them-
selves and to advance medical knowledge
at the same time.

Clinical and epidemiological studies,
cadavers, tissue cultures, cell cultures
from human organs, and sophisticated
computer simulators (like “THUMTRN
which can rocess 10 million intricate
pieces of ' ormation about the eﬁects of
substances on the human body) are just a
few of the cheaper, much more reliable
alternatives to animal research. We can

now test irritancy on egg membranes,
produce vaccines from human tissues. and
perform pregnancy tests using blood sam-
ples instead of killing rabbits. -

With more funding and a genuine effort
to develop and use them, non-animal tests
can advance human health more quickly
than archaic animal-based methods. The
unfortunate truth is that many experi-
menters simply prefer using animals
because they can be conveniently caged,
used at will and discarded without the
human- based complexities of scheduling
conﬂicts, transportation, and the threat of
malpractice lawsuits from human
subjects.

In the past, some major medical
the use of animals

tried. The discovery of antibiotics, sulpha
drugs, anesthetics, x rays, aspirin, digi-
talis. radium and mercury theraphy dis-
infectants, opium and morphine, and
bacteriology did not come from animals
and the most promising major medical
advances today, including CAT scans, mag-
netic resonance, and thefimes cancer test,
have come from non animal sources.

Results from tests on one species can-
not be accurately applied to another. Ulti
mately, everything tested on nonhuman
animals must be tested on human beings
before it becomes an accepted practice.
The time, money, and resources wasted
on animal studies can be better spent by
studying diseases where and how they
normally occur

The AIDS case is a classic example of
the futility of animal—based experiments.
The AIDS virus was isolated in human
blood, the AZI" treatment for AIDS came
from cell cultunes, and animal experiment-
ers cannot ﬁnd any animals other than
human beings who get AIDS as we do. Yet

the National Institutes of Health is now
funding a multi-million (killar program to
breed endangered chimpanzees for use in
highly exploitive and cruel AIDS experi-
ments. The fact remains that chimpanzees
do not even get AIDS even after they have
been injected with the AIDS virus.

9. “The people who oppose animal
experiments put animals before people.”

Increasing numbers of concerned
people are opposing animal research as
they learn how cruel, unnecessary, waste-
ful and unproductive it is. Although most
experiments are hidden from public view,
many people have taken the time to learn
the real facts about animal research, and
theyareappalled atwhat they see.

Recent cases, like the Silver Spring
Monkeys case, the baboon head-bashing
experiments at the University of Pennsyl-
vania, the infant monkey blindings at the
University of California at Riverside, the
cosmetic and household products indus-
try’s blinding and poisoning of dogs and
rabbits to market makeup, shampoos, and
detergents [tests which columnist Dear
Abby describes as ”cruel and inhuman“),
the view of the military’s irradiation of pri-
mates in the movie ”Project X," the “hve
storage“ of chimpanzees at the SEMA lab
oratory in Maryland and many other cases
of large- scale animal abuse have demon-
strated that the public does care about the
way animals are used in experiments and
will act to stop such abuse.

Groups of physicians, nurses, psycholo-
gists, students, veterinarians, disabled per-
sons, and others who care about their
fellow creatures are promoting productive,
humane and progressive science. They are
teaching people how to prevent illness—
including heart disease cancer, diabetes
and stroke— with proper diet and exer-
cise They are working to reduce life-
threatening pollution and entrironmental
contamination They are working too, to
promote home care and treatment centers
for the disabled, and for the use of sophisti-

innkwngmnmmnyamﬁunw

 

cated and sensible research methodolo-
gies. And they believe that neither animals
nor humans-should be forced to suffer.

10. ”Animal rights activists support
terrorism."

Even the most “militant" underground
animals rights groups, such as the Animal
Liberation Front (ALF) and other groups
who rescue animals from laboratories and
destroy vivisection equipmem, are
opposed to violence. Their rescue of cats
with electrodes implanted in their brains.
monkeys with eyes sewn .shut, or beagles
forced to inhale pollutants is designed to
prevent violence and expose the honor of
such experiments-to those who pay for
them: the American taxpayers. Members

of animal protection grcups are school-
teachers,.veterans, business professionals,
parents,'and others who have become frus-
trated with the lack of humane legislation
and proper enforcement, and the misin- .
formation given the public by animal
researchers who claim that all is well in
laboratories. '

Although the actions of animal hbera-

.tionists are not supported by everyone.

their actions nevertheless have provided
the public with an uncensored look at the

experiments that experimenters
deliberately keep hidden. They may
destroy the instruments used to inflict
pain, but they do not threaten human or
animal life. They try to educate the public
while freeing innocent beings from the
painful doom of vivisection.

As George Bernard Shaw once wrote,
"Whoever doesn't hesitate to vivisect will ,
hardly hesitate to he about it.“ The more
you learn about animal experiments. the
more you realize that the pro-vivisection
industry hes. If you’re concerned about
human health, what your taxes pay for, and
how animals are abused in laboratories,
take the time to learn what the animal
research industry doesn't want you to

9 to leave MaCornb Humane SoCiety

Medical staff blames board of directors for patient overload

By David Kocieniewski
News Staff Writer

Four veterinarians and ﬁve medical tech-
nicians say they are quitting The Humane
Society of Macomb’s veterinary clinic in
Shelby Township, charging that the medical
staff is too overburdened to provide animals
with adequate care.

The outgoing staff members —— whose
departures would leave the clinic with just
one doctor and two assistants —— blame the
Humane Society Board of Directors for
accepting nonemergency walk-in patients.
The veterinarians also say the clinic could
afford to hire additional staff if the Humane
Society would collect bills more efﬁciently
and eliminate discounts for board members:

“There are times when we have to rush
through so many clients that there’s a danger
of making mistakes,” said Dr. Michael Strze-

 

lewicz, a veterinarian. “We don’t want any-
thing for ourselves. We just want the clinic to
work better.”

BOARD MEMBERS said the staff
members are exaggerating their workload,
and have begun interviewing replacement
veterinarians to keep the clinic operating
when the resignations take effect Aug. 10.

“Some veterinarians cannot see the 'word
‘humane’ because the dollar signs cloud their
vision,” said Executive Director George Fox.
“This all boils down to a buck.”

The clinic, which is afﬁliated with the
Macomb Humane Society’s Animal Shelter,
offers low-cost veterinary care to indigent.
Macomb County pet owners. But veterinari-
ans complain that the board is so concerned
with its public image that it won’t turn away
walk-in clients —— even for minor procedures,

such as vaccinations.

PHILIP ODE, board president, said the
number of walk—in patients is roughly equal
to the number of people who make appoint-
ments for their pets and fail, to show up.

“This is just a bunch of petty complaints
that should never have gotten this far,” Ode
said.

Veterinarians also complain that the
board doesn’t act efﬁciently enough to col-
lect its bills: But Fox said that many pet-
owners who use the clinic are too poor to pay.

“What are we supposed to do,” he said.
“Our job is to take care of the animals.”

Ode said the clinic has already hired one
new veterinarian and has a list of 50 prospec-
tive candidates. Although the clinic will
remain open, there may be “minimal” service
cutbacks while the staff is replaced, Ode said.

TAMPA TRIBUNE - August ,

1988

Grizzlies, Turtles and Wolves

. WASHINGTON - Grizzly bears now
present no insurmountable problem. Tur-
tles will be studied. Wolves will be protect-
ed for. at least a few more years. The word
on .Capitol Hill is that Congress may yet
agreevgoh a bill to reauthorlze the Endan-
. gered Species Act before the session ends
in October. Let us pray the word is correct.
Congress is at its best when it takes a
_ long view, but Congress is not at its best
very often. In some areas, yes, our lawmak-
ers look to the future. They will look ahead
10 years for a weapons system, 15 years for
alternative sources of energy, 20 years for
Social Security. That is about the outer lim-
it of congressional vision.”
In the original Endangered Species Act
of 1966, Congress outdid itself. It boldly

looked ahead for hundreds of years and,

said to the country, stop. As best we can, we

must put a stop to the reckless destruction
- of whole species of native fish and wildlife.
, We of this generation hold the environment
‘ as trustees for the next generation, and we
‘ must honor that trust._

That farsighted policy continued in
1969, when Congress strengthened the act.
Definitions were broadened to encompass
“any wild mammal, fish, wild bird, amphib-
ian, reptile, mollusk, or crustacean.” Again
in 1973, wisdom prevailed. Amendments ex-
tended coverage not only to “any member
of the animal kingdom” but also to plants.
Yet again in 1982, when the act was last
reauthorized, a bipartisan coalition main-
tained the trust. Congress amended the act
to. prohibit consideration of economic im-
pact in decisions to list a species as threat-
ened or endangered. Listing or delistings
would have to be based solely upon biologi-
cal data.‘

It is hard to say what happened after
1982. The act technically expired in 1985.
Since then, like a threatened species itself,
the law has been living onr-‘borrowed time.
Three extensions have been granted, but
levels of funding have kept the program
barely alive. The act now is destined to ex-
pire on Sept. 30.

resentatives fought off a series of weaken-
ing amendments and voted 399-16 for
reauthorization. it was a great moment for
the House. Conservationists hoped the Sen-
ate would quickly seize the torch. The Sen-
ate Committee on Environment and Public
Works favorably reported a companion bill,

. S. 675, with only a single dissenting vbte.
That was eight months ago. Wyoming’ 3 -

Sen. Alan Simpson, who had dissented in

committee, objected to a program intended

to reintroduce wolves into Yellowstone Na-
tional Park. Senators whose states benefit
from the shrimp catch opposed a plan to
protect a vanishing species of sea turtle.
Simpson also questioned efforts to preserve
the grizzly bear in Montana.

After months of negotiations, it now ap-
pears that these major objections are close
to resolution. The Senate this week ap-
proved a compromise in the matter of
TEDs (Turtle Exciuder Devices) that will
relieve the shrimp fleet until May of 1989.
This will do no significant harm, and itwill
permit further experimentation with alter-

.~ Simpson has accepted assurances of com-

mon sense in controlling the destruction of
livestock by predator wolves and griwiies.

No one questions that a listing of . .gsr

ticular species may carry a subs? list

price. We learned that lesson in _ the ,, .geat
snail darter case, when construction was
halted on a major dam in order to preé set a
2-inch fish. One can understand the gsa's-
peration and frustration felt in WaShiagton
state When preservation of a threatened
species of owl prevented the harvest of
Valuable timber. On the face of it, it seems

ridiculous to put a bird or a floWer ahead of '

a suburban housing development.

These are costs our nation can absorb
-— and in truth, they are consequences
more often resolved than imposed. The ad-
ministering federal agencies have proved
themselves receptive to accommodation.
.Humankind is a valuable species also. Rep.
Ron Packard of California made the point
in an impassioned argument to the House

last December. Better to build a needed
highway, he urged, than to preserve a few .

endangered birds. The House voted his
amendment down. If that spirit can be
maintained in House and Senate confer-
ence, the trust will be honored for at least
another four years.

Mr. and Mrs. J. C. Yarbrough

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Yarbrough:

Thank you for writing me to express your concern over the impor-
tance of protecting marine mammals from commercial fishing operations.
I appreciate your opinion on this subject.

I agree with you on the importance of protecting and preserving
our precious, irreplaceable wildlife and other natural resources. As
you probably know, H.R. 4189 would authorize appropriations to carry
out the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 for fiscal years 1989
through 1993. Specifically, this bill amends the Marine Mammal Pro-
tection Act of 1972 to extend through fiscal year 1993 the authoriza-
tion of appropriations to the Department of Commerce, the Department
of Interior, and the Marine Mammal Commission to carry out the
specified functions under the Act.

H.R. 4189 is currently awaiting action within the House Merchant
Marine and Fisheries Subcommittee on Fisheries and Wildlife Conser-
vation and the Environment. On May 10, the subcommittee held hearings
on the bill but took no further action. While I am not a member of
the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries, you may be sure that I
will carefully review its report on the bill and, of course, keep your
opinion in mind if this legislation comes to the floor for a vote.

Again, I appreciate you taking the time to share your views.

to name 200 ’s baby/Iongneck

At the San Diego Zoo, the giraffes have descriptive names like Spotty.
Patches and Lofty.

In St. Louis, the gentle giants are just regular guys and gals with names like
Jamey and Gigi. .

At the National Zoo in Washington, DC, the zookeepers go intellectual,
naming one giraffe “Griff" —— after a noted animal behaviorist. But no one
can recall the scientist’s full name or contribution. , ,

Taking another tack, the San Diego Wild Animal Park gives its giraffes
Swahili names.

There’s Mameena, which means "child of the storm.”

Sawapua — a pleasant way to say “ﬂat nose.”

Mandhari Mbingu, or “sky view.”

And Shingo — Swahili for neck.

At other zoos around the country the gentle giants have names like Rusty,
Freckles, Checkers, Ginger and even Lionel.

The longneck born at the Fort Worth Zoo on Tuesday remains nameless.
To help name that giraffe, mail your suggestion to Name That Longneck,
Fort Worth Star- Telegram, Box 1870, Fort Worth 76101.

Entries may also be dropped off in person at the newspaper’s Seventh
Street entrance during regular business hours, 7 am. to 6 pm. tomorrow.
Entries must be postmarked by midnight tomorrow. The winning entry will
be announced in the newspaper Aug. 7. In case of duplicate names, the
earliest postmark wins.

Prizes include dinner for two at the restaurant of your choice in Fort
Worth, a coupon book with 25 admission tickets to the zoo and T-shirts for
the whole family from the 200’s gift shop.

Orangutans
Try Out Home
In New Exhibit

By Jack Warner
Staff Writer

There he sat, the red-headed
stranger, idly scratching his nose in
a patch of weeds and observing mo-
rosely the knot of people gathering
at the foot of the hill.

“That’s one yonder!” trumpeted
an elderly man, tugging his wife
with one hand and pointing urgent-
ly up the hill with the other.

With that, the orang—utan named
JinJing heaved himself more or less
erect and shambled slowly out of
sight to resume the close relation-
ship he has developed with a big
red ladder at Zoo Atlanta.

In its second extravaganza of
great apes this year, the zoo Satur-
day officially opens the exhibit
called The Orangutans of Ketambe,
a companion piece to the popular
Ford African Rain Forest gorilla
habitat around the corner.

Friday, the first nine orang-
utans, most of them on loan from
the Yerkes Regional Primate Cen-
ter, were trying out their new habi-
tat —— rather gingerly. since few
have ever felt dirt under their long

toes before.
There are three separate half-

acre compounds, each eventually to
hold a group of four apes. They dlf'
fer from the habitats of the cele-
brated gorilla Willie B. and his com—
panions chiefly in the huge three-
inch ropes strung like vines from
dead, girder-braced trees. Orang-
utans, unlike gorillas, are in nature
largely arboreal ——- they prefer to
stay in the trees. Nor do they live in
family groups, although the groups
at the zoo get along well.

They are also endangered; natu—
ralists say less than 5,000 are be-
lieved to live in the jungles of Bor-
neo and Sumatra. Ketambe, for
which the exhibit is named, is a na-
tional forest in Sumatra.

On Friday, the only female to
put in an appearance was Biji, who
gets around wonderfully well for a
mother with a 35~pound, 4-year-old
baby who won‘t get off her back.

The child, Janji. was too terri-
fied of its new surroundings to stop

m

clinging to Biji, dangling upside
down from her stomach or clinging
to her back. Despite her obvious an-
noyance, Biji didn‘t peel the child
off, but neither did she let it hinder
her exploration of virtually every
area of the compound, which in-
cludes a little artificial stream and
waterfall.

There was a moment of fear
when she wrapped her prehensile
lip around a iightly charged electri-
cal wire intended to discourage the

animals from venturing into the dry
moats that guard their compound.
The tingling kiss sent her scurrying
backward but did not long deter her
investigation.

The two big males —— 31-year-old
Bukit in Biji’s compound and JinJ—
ing, 12, in the neighboring yard —-
were content to observe.

Bukit and JinJing, bizarre crea-
tures with small, humanoid features
in the midst of broad moon faces,
bare chests and incredibly long
arms, were typical of male orang-
utans, lounging torpidly around
their compounds. Occasionally they
strolled from one point to another,
slowly and awkwardly, the long,
ropy red hair that covers their
backs and arms giving them the
look of decrepit old kings bent un-
der the weight of ragged royal
robes

They are not nearly so large as
gorillas — an adult male orangutan
weighs about 150 pounds; Willie B.
weighs 450 — and do not have the
gorillas misleadingly fierce expres-
sion. Bukit, a hairy blob sprawled
on the hillside watching Biji ex-
plore, had the appearance of an old

man who's seen it all, most of it at
least twice. When a lion confined
out of view some distance away be-
gan a rasping roar, Bukit scarcely
blinked —— but he rose with casual
deliberation and ambled back to sit
by the door of his indoor holding
area. Biji, on the other hand, paid
no attention to the noise.

On Thursday, JinJing got into
the moat, according to Curator of
Mammals Sam Winslow, and a lad-
der was lowered so he could climb
out. The ladder was still in place
Friday, in an area out of the pub-
lic’s view, and JinJing seemed re-
luctant to leave it. He spent most of
the morning draped lovingly around
it.

“They like to have things to
hang onto,” observed Zoo Atlanta
Director Terry Maple. Dr. Maple
said the object ofJinJing's affection
would be removed before Saturday.

At one point JinJing waddled
down to the foot of one of the cob-

bled-together trees, reached out

carefully and touched the hawser
dangling from its apex, his head
raising slowly to follow its upward
arc.

“Momma,” yelped a little boy.
“That roomangutang gonna climb
the rope!”

But JinJing and the other adult
orangutans have never climbed

much of anything, and Dr. Maple
said they’ll probably have to get in ‘
shape before they can take to the
ropes.

.“They’re couch potatoes,” he ex-
plained. 5

Sibu and her 2-year-old son
Tengku didn’t seem to notice the
crowds of visitors that had come to
- see them Saturday afternoon. In-
lstead, the Indonesian primates
spent most of the afternoon loung-
Ling about their new hilly home at
f Zoo Atlanta.

On opening day of the Orang-
j; utans of Ketambe exhibit, 7,292 peo-
“j ple came to Zoo Atlanta to catch a
,glimpse of the red-haired, shy crea-

vftures. The exhibit opening comes a
,3. little less than two months after the

Ford African Rain Forest gorilla
abitat opening. which attracted a
record 13.322 visitors.

While the Ketambe exhibit,
which now includes seven orang-
utans and will increase to 12. at-
tracted a smaller crowd than the
previous opening. 200 officials said
Saturday was a “solid day" for the
zoo.

“It was not as high as we hoped.
But there seems to be tremendous
interest in the orangutans.” said Er-
ika Archibald, a zoo spokeswoman.
“They’re fascinating animals.”

The orangutans were donated
by the Yerkes Regional Primate
Center at Emory University. Ms. Ar-
chibald said the contribution of the
creatures is valued at more than $1
million.

name of Indonesia’s national forest
where many orangutans live. Natu-
ralists say the animals are an en-
dangered species and have estimat-
ed that less than 5,000 are living.

Cobb County resident Steve‘
Pierce stood motionless for about
half a minute as he watched Sibu
and Tengku romp around their hab-

in secluded spots.

Mr. Pierce said he wasn’t disap-

Dear Constance:

Thank you for contacting me to express your concern over the
welfare of dolphins. I welcome the opportunity to share with you my
views on this matter.

Unfortunately, there has historically been a problem of dolphins
being caught in tuna fisherman’s nets. Because yellowfin tuna
usually swim with schools of dolphins and porpoises, it has been all
too commonplace for dolphins to be killed incidentally by tuna
fisherman.

I am pleased to report that this problem has been acknowledged
and addressed by Congress. In the early 1980’ s, the Marine Mammal
Protection Act (MMPA) was amended specifically to place higher
standards and requirements on U. S. tuna fisherman -— and resulted in a
five- fold reduction in dolphin mortality. And in the 1984 amendments
to the MMPA, the Department of Commerce was given the responsibility
for banning imports of tuna from nations whose tuna fleets failed to

reduce their incidental take of marine mammals to a level comparable
to that of the U.S. fleet.

It took the Department four years to issue these regulations, but
as of March 18, 1988, this strict protective policy has been in
effect. I consider such measures as these to be crucial. The
importance of the maTntenance of our wildlife can not be understated,
and you may be assured that I will continue to remain vigilant against
any wildlife violations.

Once again, thank you for contacting me. Please feel free to
write again on this or any other issues of concern to you.

Dear Mrs. Yarbrough:

Thank you for letting me know of your support for strong
reauthorization of the Marine Mammal Protection Act.

As you know, this legislation is before Congress for
reauthorization this year, and the Senate Subcommittee on
National Ocean Policy held hearings on its status and
implementation in April. At these hearings, many of the concerns
you raise were brought out, and Senator Kerry, who chaired the
hearings, gave his assurances that they would be addressed by the
subcommittee.

I have been a consistent and strong supporter of legislation
such as the Marine Mammal Protection Act which ensures, as far as
possible, the protection of our wildlife and the conservation of.
their habitat. I assure you that I will have your thoughts

prominent in my mind when this reauthorization package comes
before me later this year.

Thank you again for taking the time to share your concerns
with me. I hope you will continue to keep me informed on issues
important to us all.

Dear Senator Nunn:

Thank you for your letter of May 31, 1988, on behalf of Mrs. Constance F.
Yarbrough concerning the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service’s (APHIS)
administration of the Animal Welfare Act (AWA). , '

APHIS officials have now completed their work on finaliiing changes to the AWA
standards and regulations based on the more than 7,800 comments received on
the proposal. Deve10pment of the remaining pr0posal for the humane handling,
care, treatment, and transportation of certain animals, including dogs and
nonhuman primates, has also been completed. These regulations, which
constitute a major rule having an effect of over $100 million, are now
undergoing the necessary clearances prior to publication.

In recent years, APHIS has faced new challenges and taken on new
responsibilities in protecting American agriculture and enforcing the AWA. To
help us meet these challenges, we are now planning a major restructuring of
the Agency. Eleven areas of responsibility will now report directly to the
Administrator. These 11 areas are central to the accomplishment of the APHIS
mission, and the increased management attention to be given these areas should
lead to increased effectiveness.

One of the new programs, Regulatory Enforcement and Animal Care, will be
responsible for animal welfare--primarily an enforcement activity--and other
compliance and enforcement activities currently scattered throughout the
Agency. We believe the separation of animal care from Veterinary Services is
in the best interests of all concerned. Animal care will have greater
visibility, be in a position to compete on its own for resources, and no
longer be a small part of an organization whose important principal mission,

animal health, is something else. Instead of spreading out responsibility for
a hundred staff years of work among over 300 peOple, animal care will be the
sole responsibility of 100 highly trained professionals.

We appreciate your interest in this matter and h0pe this information is
helpful.

Sincerely,

Mosser

Administrator

Dear Connie:

I am pleased to be able to inform you that the Senate, with
my earnest and active support, last Thursday passed a strong
reauthorization of the Endangered Species Act. I thought you
would appreciate the enclosed remarks I made on the Senate floor
when we began consideration of the bill.

This bill had been stalled in the Senate for more than three
years because of the concerns of many Senators about programs
undertaken under the Act to re—introduce grizzly bears and wolves
and to require that shrimpers use Turtle Excluder Devices to
protect sea turtles from drowning in shrimp nets.

Through my efforts and those of my colleagues, we were able
to address most of these concerns without weakening the bill.
Perhaps the most serious threat to the bill's integrity, a
amendment requiring that economic impacts be considered in
decisions to protect species, was withdrawn on the Senate floor
in the face of overwhelming opposition. I believe it is almost
impossible to balance the economic benefits of a proposed
development against the unquantifiable costs of an extinct
species, and I feel that such a requirement would lead to
short-sighted decisions.

As you know, I am a cosponsor of this bill and was a leader
in the movement to persuade the Senate leadership to bring this
legislation to a vote. Many conservation organizations —- and
people like yourself -- are to be commended for bringing the
necessary pressure to bear on the opponents of this strong
legislation in order to get it to the floor and approved by the
full Senate.

The bill now goes to conference with the House, where the
differences will be reconciled in a matter of weeks before it

will finally be enacted into law. Thank you again for your
support on this issue, and I hope you will keep in touch.

PROCEEDINGS AND DEBATES or THE 100 CONGRESS, SECOND SESSION

 

 

Vol. 134

WASHINGTON, MONDAY, JULY 25, 1988

Senate

MONDAY, JULY 25. 1988

Mr. FOWLER. Mr. President, I am
pleased that we have an Opportunity
today to discuss a modest extension of
the Endangered Species Act, one of
the landmark statutes of Federal envi-
ronmental protection efforts.

Since my colleagues on the Environ-
mental Committee reported Out this
bill last December, Senators have
widely discussed this bill’s impact on
wildlife and people alike. We have de-
bated the question: What level of Gov-
ernment involvement is appropriate to
preserve our wildlife heritage for
future generations? Some of us have
differed over the methods to this end,
but our goals have remained the
same—an unquestioning commitment

to the conservation of species whose :

survival is threatened or endangered
by human actions.

In recent years, our scientists have
recorded the signs that we are putting
extreme stress on our environment:
The ozone hole over the South Pole
seems to have grown; our summers
seem to be getting hotter; our basic cli-
mate patterns seem to be changing.

These stresses, together with great
increases in human population—and
the attendant pollution and destruc-
tion of natural habitat—is leading to a
crisis of global proportions for wildlife.
Scientists estimate that 2,000 species
of reptiles, birds, and mammals are
now headed for extinction, that 70
percent of the bird species in the
Amazon will be lost by the end of this
century. Clearly, this is no time to
balk at protecting endangered species
in our own country. .

There are a number of ways of look-
ing at this issue.

We can look at it as a moral respon-
sibility. Our mandate for stewardship

is spelled out in the opening chapters

of Genesis. We inherited a natural
world that, with all its diversity, its
hundreds of thousands of plant and
animal species, maintains a very fine
and intricate balance. This balance de-

veloped over millenia. We threaten to
upset and in some cases eradicate it in
a matter of decades.

We can also look at it as a matter of
self-interest, to preserve and study the
diversity of life. We never know which
species may prove a future source of
food. or may provide an enzyme that
cures disease-or even a message in its
DNA that holds the key to other scien-
tific mysteries. That is what we risk
losing with each species that falls into
the black hole of extinction at our
hands.

How does the death Of the last
dusky seaside sparrow affect us? What
will result from the declining numbers
of sea turtles? How do we measure the
loss of the California condor from the
wild? No one knows for certain.

How many species can we lose to ex-
tinction before we feel our world di-
minished? It would be hard to find a
scientist who could tell us for sure.
But common sense tells us that we
can’t go on losing species at the cur-
rent rate.

This bill renews our efforts to stem
these losses. I hope that, thanks to the
perseverance of my colleague from
Maine and the cooperation of the
senior Senator from my neighboring
State of Alabama, we will be able to
move forward with this legislation
today. Because our rich wildlife herit-
age is also a source of common nation-
al pride, of our very national identity.
There is no getting around it.

This bill puts into action our ongo-
ing promise to our children and grand-
children that they will enjoy a natural
world at least as wondrous and varied
as our own. The authors of this legis-
lation deserve our commendation. And
I believe conscience requires us to sup-
port their efforts.

Although I do not anticipate any
amendments that would strengthen
this bill, I will support any that may
be Offered. I will also oppose any
amendments—and I understand there
may be a few—that would diminish
our progress toward this goal, and I
urge my colleagues, likewise, to oppose
such amendments.

No. 107

Killer disease linked ‘

to sewage dumping

By Casey Bukro

OCCAGOTRBUNE

 

SANDY HOOK, NJ. -— The
oceans, so vast and seemingly inde-
_' structible, are nonetheless showing
’ signs of illness.

' The signs include whales dying
' and washing ashore last year on
Cape Cod, and hundreds of bottle-
nose dolphins beaching themselves
along the Atlantic Coast, only to die.

This year, researchers at the Na- ‘
, tional Marine Fisheries Service lab- j,
. oratory here have identified a dis- ?
g—tory in Sandy-Hook, researchers are

; ease that eats away at the shells of

f crabs and lobsters, and at the fins of ,

fish.

They suspect the problem may
be linked to the dumping of New
York area sewage into the Atlantic
Ocean not far from here. -

At a cost of $1 million, the labora~ 5‘"

fytory is studying a site 12 miles off-
_jshore that, for a half-century, was
_ used for the ocean dumping of as
much as 6.6 million tons ‘of sewage
plant sludge per year. _
‘ Though sewage sludge can no
”longer be deposited there, the spot
-- known locally as the “Dead Sea”
' -- still is heavily contaminated, and
‘ it still is used for harbor dredging
It is one of only two places in the

Atlantic off the United States i
where the oxygen content of the '

E}"“Tﬁ’e“ whales" diednot from any

Elmackerel tainted with a poison pro
duced by an ocean-going algae conic
monly known as the red tide.

Marine investigators found that

' high levels of the poison, called‘paﬁ
alytic shellfish toxin, had concen-

trated in the livers and bile of the A

mackerel. But this poses no hazard
to people eating mackerel flesh, sci:
entists insist. '

“This is a perfectly natural but
unique event,” said Dr. Louis Lei-
bovitz, who studies marine animal

health at Woods Hole. “The bottom.

line is there are natural events like
this. One should not immediately
consider it all pollution, although

.. pollution is an important matter.”

Pearce said ocean creatures are

’ experiencing stress in many parts

_ of the world. _

He and other experts are compil-
ing a report on the health of the
World’s oceans, and some trends are

_ emergmg. ,

* “Development itself is having a
very major effect on the quality of
water,” Pearce said. “All of these
events follow development. You see
this all over the world where water

' quality integrity is compromised.”
At Woods Hole and at the labora-

lems of shellfish and the dumping

Reacting to c’omplaints from

‘ commercial fishermen that the
; shell-damaging disease appears to
-_ be widespread, scientists collected
; 260 samples of marine life late in

June from 200 miles off the coasts

Navajos to Cite Hopis huntmg eagles

Permit requested
{but not granted;
task forceurged

By Blll Donovan

Arizona Republic Correspondent

. WINDOW ROCK —-‘ Navajo
tribal ofﬁcials said Wednesday that
, Hopis caught on the Navajo Reserva-
tion trying to capture eaglets will be
issued criminal citatiOns.

Ninebah Cahn, director of re-
sources for the Navajo Tribe, said
citations will be issued because the
Hopi T1ibe has not been g1anted a
.t11bal permit, although one has been
requested.

Earlie1 this month, Navajo t1ibal
wildlife conse1vationists cited four
Hopis who were caught in The Gap
area with eagles allegedly obtained
illegally.~The eagles were released, but
Cahn said tribal prosecutors dismissed

all .four citations because they were '

improperly ﬁlled out.

, The Hopi T1 ibe submitted a hunt~
' ‘ing request to the Navajos shortly
'. afte1 receiving a fede1al pe1n1it to
i hunt and capture 18 golden eagles fo1

use in their religious ceremonies this
fall.

Hopis traditionally captu1e the
‘ eagles 111 the summer and then, in the
fall, sacriﬁce them during ceremonies
so that their feathers can be used in

‘5 other’ ceremonies during the year.

The federal permit allows the Hopis
to ather the eagles anywhere in
nort1eastern Arizona as long as the
tribe receives the permission of
landowners.

Cahn said that the Navajos, who
also use eagle feathers in their
ceremonies but do not kill the birds to
get them, are worried about the effect
the Hopis’ hunting might have on the
area’s eagle population.

Ed Olson, a wildlife biologist for
the Bureau of Indian Affairs’ Navajo
Area, has warned Navajo ofﬁcials that
continued ha1assment of eagle nests
may result in the eagle population’s
abandoning a nesting aiea.

Navajo Chairman Peter MacDon-
ald, in a letter sent by telefax to the
Hopi Tribe on Monday, left. the door
open for the Hopis to gather eaglets in
the future.

MacDonald proposed that a task
f0rce be established to discuss ways
both tribes could continue

w .‘

their ‘

traditional ceremonies using eagles
“while preserving the diminishing
eagle population.”

He also suggested that the two
tribes jointly apply for a. federal grant
to undertake an inventory of the eagle
population in the area. Olson said
such an inventory, which probably
would cost about $10,000, never has
been done.

However, MacDonald said the
Navajos also want. the eagle talks tied
to land disputes between the two
tribes and to the difﬁculty Navajos
have in following their traditional
religious practices on lands affected by
those disputes.

In a 1934 boundary dispute, which
affects lands north and west of Tuba
City, the federal government has put a
freeze on any development without
the consent of both tribes.

Tribal leaders have complained that
in some cases, this freeze violates the
religious rights of Navajos. For
example, traditional Navajos refuse to
live in a' home where someone has
died.

When this happens, the Navajo
family is forced to either move in with
relatives or move outside the freeze

area because of the prohibition on

MacDonald said he feels that the
const1uct10n of any structure required
by the Navajo . peOple for their
religious practices should be allowed ,
without ﬁrst having to get the consent ‘
of the Hopi Tribe.

He also used the eagle problem to
call upon the Hopis once again to
address the problems of relocating
Navajos from lands partitioned in
1976 to the Hopis in the former
Joint- Use Area ‘

And he asked that the Hopis
reconsider the Navajo Tribe’s numer~
ous requests to consider a land
exchange as away to ﬁnally resolve
the longstanding land dispute.

Hopi Chairman Ivan Sidney said
Wednesday that the eagle question is ,
being handled by tribal religious
leaders and not by the tribal govern-
ment. He said the religious leaders are
expected to issue a response to
MacDonald’s letter in the next day or
two.

Sidney criticized MacDonald’s sug-
gestion that the eagle talks also should
include discussion of a land exchange.

“If you bring in the land exchange, .

it mixes politics in with this,” Sidney . .
said.

Into the woods: Aerial Watchdog Michael Stewartt tracks the amount of virgin forest still left' In the Northwest from his Cessna 210” 7

ant to see the big trees of Washing-

ton and Oregon, the great Douglas
ﬁrs and red cedars? Stay in your car. Keep
to the main roads. Avoid high, distant
views. In the national forests here, the
policy of the US. Forest Service has been
to leave buﬂer zones of uncut trees along
the tourist highways. It is prettier that
way. It is also easier for the Forest Service,
which has fewer letters of outrage to an-
swer about the scariﬁcation that used to
be a coastal rain forest.

On the other hand, if you want to see
what is really happening, get in touch
with Michael Stewartt, the chief pilot.
troublemaker, idea man and fund raiser
of an extraordinary environmental ﬂying
service called Project Lighthawk. Just
now a couple of local environmentalists, a
journalist and Stewartt are aboard one of
Lighthawk’s two Cessna 210$. Stewartt. a
lean, relaxed fellow of 38, with a bushy
light brown mustache and hair to match,
radios his plane‘s identiﬁcation to the
control tower at Seattle‘s Boeing Field.

We take OH to the south, then head
west. Below is the Hood Canal. an arm of
Puget Sound, and the Navy shipyard at
Bremerton. Ahead partly obscured by
clouds are the Olympic Peninsula and the
huge trees and muscular ridges and peaks
of Olympic National Park. What we want
to see from the air is the Shelton sus-
tained-yield area, a heavily logged region
just short of the park, most of it in the
Olympic National Forest.

Stewartt and Forestry Consultant Pe-
ter Morrison. working with the help of the
Wilderness Society, have just nailed down
what is either a very large bureaucratic
fraud or a conveniently jumbled process
of long-term fudging. Environmentalists
had suspected for a long time that the
Forest Service had vastly overestimated
the amount of old growth—virgin forest——
still left in the Northwest. Traditionally,
the Forest Service has disapproved of

 

messy, tangled old-growth forests, whose
dank, rotting understory and ancient trees
it has referred to as “overmature” and
“decadent.” It has preferred to clear-cut
the old growth, and then treat trees as if
they were very large soybean plants that
could be “harvested” for timber on a rota-
tion basis every 60 or 80 or 100 years in
“sustained-yield" areas.

Overestimating‘ the amount of old
growth still standing. by underreporting
clear- cuts or by counting mature second
growth as primal forest, is convenient be-
cause it reduces the urgency of squawks

. from environmentalists. But Stewartt and

Morrison (a Forest Service employee
moonlighting on his days off) drew circles
in red pencil around old-growth areas on
the Forest Service‘s own aerial maps.
Then they ﬂew off to ﬁnd the trees.

Most of them, it turned out, had al-
ready been sold, clear-cut and
trucked off. In six national forests in Ore-
gon and Washington, they found that only
about 33% to 50% of the sample tracts
listed as old growth were still forested.
“Several years of clear-cutting simply are
not accounted for, ” says Morrison. In the
Olympic National Forest below us, only
106, 000 acres remain of the 217, 000
claimed by the Forest Service. In Ore-
gon s Siskiyou 142. 000 acres remain of a
claimed 433 000. Much of what was still
uncut was broken into tracts too small to
serve as habitats for those species—the
spotted owl, for instance—whose pres—
ence indicates a healthy old- growth forest
ecology. In some areas. the remaining old
forest, that continent of trees that colo-
nists began cutting in Virginia in the 17th
century, will last only about 20 more years
at present rates of logging.

A hawk‘s-eye view makes the case un-
forgettable. Stewartt ﬁnds a break in the
clouds, and we circle over logging opera-
tions in high, steep valleys. A huge Sikor-

 

sky helicopter is pulling logs out of a nar—
row canyon. What is going on is not just
clear- ~cutting, which a widely ignored pro-
vision of the National Forest Manage-
ment Act of 1976 permits on national for—
est land only when it is the optimum
cutting method. This, says Stewartt, is
really “a mining operation. a one-time ex-
traction of resources.“ Valley walls too
steep to walk on have been scraped to
bare earth. Acreage bulldozed for shep-
ping malls looks like this. Until these rav-
aged uplands reseed themselves—which
on the steepest slopes simply may not
happen—erosion is inevitable. and the
most reliable yield says Forester Morri-
son in disgust, will be sustained sedi-
ment” in the streams that drain them. We
head eastward to a landing ﬁeld near
Mount Rainier National Park.

Michael Stewartt began his ﬂying ca-
reer 2.000 ft. underground, in a copper
mine near Tucson. That was in 1969. He
was 19, short on cash and certainties. too
restless for college. already back from a
year of wandering that had taken him as
far as Australia. The mine taught him
what he wanted. out. He spent his wages
on ﬂying lessons and became a bush pilot
in Alaska, the state with the bushiest pi-
loting of all.

He had begun to think hard about the
scars and stains of prosperity that he was
seeing from the air. “I have no grudge
against wealth or business he says these
days. But around 1975 he had an idea: It
would help if more people could get a pi-
lots view of the damage that was being
done He spent most of the next four
years trying to get Lighthawk started.

We touch down on a rough landing
strip on Forest Service land near Mount
Rainier National Park. There is a camp-
ground nearby. and a tract of huge trees
each about 12 ft. or 15 ft. in diameter and
175 ft. or more high. reserved. from cutting
to show visitors what the forest used to be

 

 

 

 




 

like. Old logging roads lace through this
damp, shaded museum tract. Huge
stumps rot here and there among the liv-
ing trees. These are signiﬁcant: it is obvi-
ous that a sizable number of trees can be
cut without killing the forest. Saplings and
a complex tangle of undergrowth spring
up to use the sunlight.

Such selective cutting, however,
which allowed forests to regenerate spe-
cies that had no commercial value as well
as the highly prized Douglas fir, seemed
too inefﬁcient to the Government forest-
ers. Now, perhaps too late, research has
shown that clear-cuts tend to break an
important ecological chain: they destroy
the habitat of small mammals that shelter
in forest undergrowth. These creatures
eat and distribute mycorrhizal fungi,

which grow among the rootlets of saplings ~

and help the trees absorb water and nutri-
ents. There may be enough spores of fungi
in the soil after a clear-cut to start a sec-
ond-growth forest. but a third crop is less
likely to be successful, and it now seems
possible that sustained-yield forests based
on clear—cutting simply may not work.

So the conversation goes on one of
Project Lighthawk‘s ﬂights this summer.
The nine-year-old. nonproﬁt ﬂying ser-
vice, which operates on a budget of about
$200,000 a year, has tracked radio-col-
lared wolves in Montana and rare por-
poises in the Sea of Cortes. Last winter
Stewartt and Volunteer Pilot Jerry Hoo-
gerwerf ﬂew for several weeks over the
Costa Rican rain forest and discovered
and helped stop illegal gold mining and
logging near a park on the Osa Peninsula.

n a typical Saturday a few weeks ago,

Lighthawk had four planes in the air
—the two Cessnas it owns. the second
ﬂown by Staff Pilot Bruce Gordon. and two
planes supplied by volunteer pilots—over
endangered areas in four Western states.
The charge to journalists, biologists. legis-
lators and environmental groups ranges
from nothing to $40 an hour.

At ﬁrst Stewartt had a tough job ex-
plaining to earthbound environmentalists
how Lighthawk might be useful. That
changed after a successful four—year ﬁght
that led to the shutdown of the smoke-
belching Phelps Dodge copper smelter at
Douglas, Ariz., a notorious contributor to
the West’s airborne sulphur-dioxide levels.
Now Stewartt, with ﬁve salaries to guaran-
tee, two planes to maintain and the costly
prospect of buying three more, spends half
his time raising money. He has no house,
no wife and lives out of a ﬂight bag.

Sometimes he broods about these
lacks. but as we approach Boeing Field. he
is ﬁzzing with good spirits. “Awright, aw-
right!” he yells. The control tower is hold-
ing up the takeoff of Boeing’s newest 747, a
monstrous silver machine with upturned
wing tips. to let us land. This amuses
Stewartt, who looks astonished when asked

whether he ever thought of piloting such an .
ark. “Nah,” he says, “those guys are bus ‘
drivers.” ——By John Skow

LOS ANGELES TIMES - September 22, 1988

Micro ch ips:
The Finders

of Lost Pets

By GARY LIBMAN, Times Staff Writer

Directors of animal shelters in the area
are purring over a new microchip, which is
being implanted in pets to help them get
returned when they wander from their
owners.

The chip costs $40 to implant and will be
offered at 45 area veterinary hospitals.

The major Los Angeles shelters—the
county Department of Animal Care and
Control, the city Department of Animal
Regulation and the Society for the Preven-
tion of Cruelty to Animals—all are expect—
ed by this week to have a computer
program listing owners of animals implant-
ed with the chips.

Implanted Between Shoulders

Here is how the plan works: A pencil-
point-sized microchip containing a regis-
tration number is implanted between. the
shoulder blades of a dog, cat or other
animal through a system similar to an
injection.

When the pet gets lost and is brought
into a shelter or a veterinary hospital, a
worker can check the animal’s shoulders
with a scanner that registers its number.
That number then is matched with a
computer listing of implanted animals and
their owners.

Shelter directors like the system for
many reasons, not the least of which is that
it appears painless to the animal. The
microchip—unlike tags or tattoos—also
cannot be lost, altered or grown over and it
can always be found in the same place.

“It won’t replace dog licenses, but it’s a
pretty neat system,” said Robert 1. Rush,
general manager of the city Department of
"Animal Regulation. “It only takes a couple
of seconds and zap, it’s done.”

Ed Cubrda, Los Angeles SPCA executive
director, said: “In our training session, we
injected the microchips into three of our

mascots, two dogs and one cat. . . . There
was barely a flinch by the cat. It went in
that easily.

“The chip can be used on a variety of
animals-dogs, cats, birds, horses and other
livestock,” he said. “It’s more versatile
than other identification methods. It’s
difficult to hang an ID tag from a bird’s
neck, for example.” '

About, 10,000 animals in North America
and 500 in Southern California have had
the chips implanted, said Mike Thomas,
managing director of International Infopet
Systems Inc., the Agoura Hills company
that is marketing the plan.

Most of the Canadian implants were done

iin tests in the last year; reviews there are

also favorable.

“From my perspective, this system, or
something like it, offers the greatest hope
of reducing the number of animals which
would have to be destroyed because the
owners can’t be located,” said Jim Bandow,
executive director of the Canadian Federa-
tion of Humane Societies in Ottawa.

“In Canada, the claiming rate for return-
ing lost cats to their owners is less than 4 %.
If we could bring that up to the rate for
dogs, 50%, we would save a tremendous
number of cats. We’re talking in the
millions.”

The return rate for lost animals is
equally low at the 15 Los Angeles animal
shelters operated by the city, the county

and the SPCA. .

CHIPS: Implants May Lead Pets Back Home

Continued from Page 1 p ,

Only 12.4% of 134,092 stray dogs,
cats and other animals found each
year are reunited with owners.
That includes 22.3% of 65,709 lost
dogs and only 1.7%. of 51,318 lost
cats. (Cats are not required to be
licensed.)

Owners who have had pets im-
planted with microchips think they
can beat the odds and get their
stray animals returned.

“If the dogs go farther than the
neighborhood and do get picked up,
there is some way to identify
them,” said Ann Scully of Winnet-
ka. She had chips implanted in her
three ISO-pound dogs-a St. Ber-
nard, a Rottweiler and a mastiff.

Initial, Annual Fees

For peace of mind, pet owners
pay not only the initial $40 fee but
an annual $11 renewal charge to
provide such services as changing
computer listings of owners' ad—
dresses while they are vacationing.

Shelter directors say this pet-
finding plan is a significant im-
provement over tattooing, the most
recent major identification system.
It also is a helpful addition to
licensing, the main pet identifica-
tion method in Los Angeles since
1871.

“This department tried tattooing
in 1946,” Rush said. “They got out
of it because there was so much
pain for the animal. Having an
animal cry and scream in an animal
shelter while they were being
tattooed is ridiculous. There’s no
way you could do it unless you put

the animal under anesthesia.

“Also, there was no mandate on a
national basis that said where the
tattoo had to go. . . . If you tattoo a
Great Dane when it’s 8 weeks old,
by the time it’s 11/2 years old and
weighs 160 pounds, the tattoo
might be as long as 30 inches.”

Whatever the form of identifica-
tion. experts generally agree that
working with animal shelters is the
best way to find a lost pet, though
several groups do try to help in the
search.

The Mercy Crusade of Van Nuys
takes calls from those who have

 

 

lost and found pets. It lists the
information in a registry.

Actors and Others for Animals of
North Hollywood tries to help
people find their way through the
shelter system, which can be be—
wildering: 24 animal shelters
throughout Los Angeles are run by
11 different agencies, said Cubrda
of the SPCA.

Mary Flint, Actors and Others
executive director, said: “If an
animal is picked up in West Holly-
wood, it is under the jurisdiction-of
the county; if it is found in east.
Hollywood, it is under the city; if it
is in Beverly Hills, it is handled by
the SPCA; and if it is in West Los
Angeles, you are back under the
city again.

“If the public thinks it’s only got
one shelter to go to, it could be
wrong. It depends on where the
animal was picked up. Can you see
how confusing this mishmash is?"

Other Pet-Finding Plans

As optimistic as they are about
the possibilities of the new micro-
chip, shelter directors noted that it 3
may not be the final word in pet
identification and retrieval.

“We will be putting in a fax
machine in district shelters so that
if you walk into one animal shelter
and say, ‘I lost a dog, here is a
picture of it,’ we can put the picture
out on a fax machine instantly to all
other shelters,” Rush said.

“We’re looking at taking video—
tapes of lost animals and putting
them on cable television,” he said.

 

 

 




DALLAS TIMES HERALD - September 22, 1988

SPCA marks
half century
of protection

Animal advocates say

they see same abuses .

By Jeff South
OF THE TIMES HERALD STAFF

 

 

It began as a cramped, dirt-ﬂoor
pound and has evolved into a
$750,000-a-year organization that us-
es computers to ﬁnd lost pets. But
as the Dallas Society for the Preven-
tion of Cruelty to Animals turns 50
today, officials say at least one thing
hasn’t changed: the abuse some peo—
ple inflict on dogs and cats.

“We see as much abuse now as
ever,” said Carol Cobb, executive di-
rector of the local SPCA. “A lot of
people don’t think of animals as liv-
ing creatures. They see them as‘dis—
posable items. If their dog barks too
loud, they think nothing of dumping
it and getting another dog.”

That mentality, Cobb said, leads
people to lock their pets in suffocat-
ingly hot cars during the summer or
chain them outside in freezing win-
ter weather. Last year, her staff re-
ceived 810 cruelty reports, ranging
from starving horses to organized
dogfights.

Outrage . over similar abuse
prompted Emilie Schuyler to estab-
lish the Dallas Animal Protective
League on Sept. 22, 1938. The group
was concerned not only about ani—
mals but also about women and
children, “who were treated almost
as badly in those days,” said long-
time SPCA board member March
Walker.

In 1970, the league merged with
the Society for Animal Protection,
taking the SPCA name, and restrict-
ed its concerns to the animal world.

Schuyler, who died in 1973 at age
82, was the driving force behind the
protection efforts. Born in Denmark,
she moved to Dallas in 1932. At
ﬁrst, Schuyler opened her Oak Cliff
home to stray dogs and cats. But
when neighbors complained, she or-
ganized the animal welfare league

and opened a shelter near down-
town Dallas.

Schuyler pursued her work with-
a fervor that matched her imposing
countenance. Once, when a vaca-
tioning family left its dog in a
locked garage without food or wa-
ter, Schuyler took an ax, bashed in
the door and rescued the pet.

She also nursed back to health a
donkey that pranksters had set
afire. When the culprits went to
trial, Schuyler brought the animal
up the elevator to the courtroom -——
so the judge and jurors could see
the victim. .

But Schuyler’s uncompromising
style alienated some people. She

harangued politicians with pit-bull
zeal for stronger laws against ani-
mal mistreatment, and resorted to
public relations gimmicks. To pro-
test a plan to rid downtown of pi-
geons, Schuyler poured a sack of
seed on the sidewalk and invited
the birds to partake — and police
to arrest her.

During her tenure, veterinarians
generally shunned the animal pro-
tection group, charging that Schuy-
ler was practicing veterinary medi—
cine without. a license.

Schuyler, using personal funds
and groveling for donations, operat-
ed her Quonset hut shelter on a

shoestring, with just one volun-
teer and one employee, Walker
said. The facility had dirt floors
and lacked air conditioning. Each
pen held several animals, Walker
said.

“The only reason they didn’t
fight is that they were so
cramped,” she added.

But that changed in 1974 when
the existing SPCA center opened
across the street at 362 S. Indus-
trial Blvd. Despite a few contro—
versies — in 1975, the shelter
was indicted for animal cruelty
for using a decompression cham—
ber to kill animals, an action now
done by injection -—~ the organi—
zation has developed a national
reputation.

This year, the Humane Society
of the United States named the

Dallas SPCA as one of the three
outstanding animal protection
groups in the country, said Cobb,
who has run the local organiza-
tion since 1985.

One measure of success, she
said, is its adoption rate: The Dal-
las SPCA finds homes for about
70 percent of the dogs and more
than half of the cats it receives.
Many shelters “put down” —— or
kill —— 90 percent of their ani-
mals, Cobb said. ‘

She attributed her center’s
adoption rate to the veterinary
care and shelter conditions that

_ ensure healthy pets.

Besides operating a shelter
that receives up to 7,000 animals
annually, the SPCA has a low—
cost spay and neuter clinic that
performed 2,500 operations last
year; an education department
that speaks to schools and com-
munity groups; a program that
subsidizes pet adoptions for the
elderly; and an inspector who
conducted, 554 cruelty investiga-

tions in 1987.

The group also has developed '
a computer network called PET-
NET that links nine shelters in
the Dallas area, helping owners
of lost pets ﬁnd their animals.
Animal welfare organizations in
other cities have'expressed inter-
est in copying the system, Cobb
said.

But the Dallas SPCA still has
much work to do, she said. A re—
cent focus is to persuade the city
of Dallas to stop selling dogs and
cats from its animal shelters to
medical institutions. Of the
29,000 animals impounded by
the two municipal shelters this
year, about 1,400 have been sold
to research laboratories.

Although researchers say their -
experiments are in the interest of
science, Cobb said they shouldn’t
use shelter animals. “It under-
mines the whole concept of a
shelter. Instead, the shelter be—
comes a warehouse for lab ani-
mals.”

The Real issue ls Humane Animal Research

This letter is in reference to the one by Dr. M.S.
Silberman, headed “Research On Animals Helps
People.”

The key phrase in that letter, to me, is “judicious
and humane use of laboratory animals.” ’

What animals’ rights groups are working to
abolish, as much as anything else, is the cruelly
inhumane misuse of animal lives in laboratories.

Also, researchers often do not judiciously opt for
alternative methods of testing and experimenting

when they are available.

Bioresearchers prefer to work in secret, behind
closed doors, and not give the public the opportunity
to consider these facts.

The public has a right to consider all the facts,
because it. is tax money that pays the salary of many
a sadistic laboratory worker and/or researcher.

Mrs. Constance F. Yarbrough
3149 King Arthur Court, NE
Atlanta, Georgia 30345

Dear Mrs. Yarbrough:

Knowing of your concern for animals and of your support for the
Pet Protection Act, I thought you would be interested in recent
legislative activity in this area.

I am pleased to report that the Senate, with my support, on
August 10 passed an amended version of this bill, the Pet Theft Act.
This legislation prohibits class B animal dealers from obtaining
animals from auction sales, the source of almost all stolen pets
that are used in laboratory research. This bill, like the Pet
Protection Act, seeks to eliminate the use of stolen pets in
biomedical research, thereby decreasing the incentives for shady
dealers to steal pets.

As you know, I think it is important to remember that while
research involving animals has provided us with scientific
breakthroughs, random source animals are not always appropriate for
such activities. In addition,-we must not lose sight of the fact
that recent technological advances have greatly reduced the need for
many animal experiments.

The Pet Theft Act simply and directly reduces the available
pool of animals for experimentation, and I believe it will go a long
away toward eliminating thefts of pets. The House of
Representatives must still consider this legislation in its current
form before Congress adjourns in early October, but I am hopeful
that this non-controversial bill will find its way to the
President's desk in the near future.

In Poaching Case

Enter Innocent Pieas

 

They Are Among 43 Indicted in ‘Operation Smokey’

By Sam Hopkins
S Iaﬂ Writer

ROME, Ga. -— Hoyt Bond, an in—
: ternational dealer in furs and gin-
' seng and chairman of the Murray
County Ripped Off and Uncounted
Taxpayers Association, pleaded not
guilty in federal court Friday to
buying and selling illegal black bear
pelts and body parts.

Mr. Bond, 65, a long-bearded
mountaineer, was one of 43 people
indicted last month after a massive,
three-year investigation called “Op—
eration Smokey,” which federal au—
thorities said exposes the sale of
bear parts as supposed aphrodisi-
acs on the international black mar-
ket.

Fourteen other defendants also
pleaded innocent at an arraignment
held in Bryson City, NC. All of the

defendants are charged under the «

federal Lacey Act, which prohibits
the interstate transportation of ille-
gally taken game.

Bear gallbladders in particular
are thought to be a powerful stimu-
lus to sexual potency. They are sold

for as much as $1,000 each on Ori-'

ental markets.

Bear feet and claws also are
considered aphrodisiacs.

Operation Smokey was aimed at

stopping the poaching of black

bears that roam the southern Appa-
lachians. It is thought that about
700 black bears inhabit North Geor-
gia.

Bears are not the only animals
believed to have body parts that act
as aphrodisiacs. Some people, au-
thorities say, believe they can get
sexual stimulus by consuming such
items as swan testicles, camel
humps and hyena and turtle penis-
es.

Mr. Bond, whose trial was set
for Nov. 7 by U. S. District Judge
Harold Murphy, vigorously denied
he was guilty of three charges that

he boughtbear and other illegal

furs on Feb. 17, 1986, submitted a
false record and sold them on Oct.
19, 1986.

He charged that his arrest was
partially politically motivated be-
cause he had been active in trying
to get local officials in Murray

County out of office and had fought.

federal authorities in Tennessee
over the use of crop chemicals that
were killing wildlife.

Mr. Bond said he was sitting at
his kitchen table in his pajamas and
bedroom slippers drinking a cup of
coffee about 6 am. on Aug. 23 when
“15 people, heavily armed with
automatic rifles and machine guns
and wearing battle dress with bul-
letproof vests, rushed into my house
and started running around- like a
ounch of fools.”

“They never showed me a war-
rant or served papers on me,” he
said Friday. “I thought, ‘My God,
this can’t be America.’ They put
handcuffs, leg shackles and chains
on me, and all this 65-year-old man
was armed with was a cup of cof-
fee.” . '

“They treated me like I was a
damned murderer,” he said.

Mr. Bond said he was placed in
a cell in the federal courthouse in
Rome for nearly five hours before

he was taken before Judge Murphy

later in the day.

. Mr. Bond, who said he had nev—
er been arrested in his life, recalled
that when he asked the officers to
take his leg shackles off so he could
walk into the federal courthouse, he
was told, “Walk, damn you, or we’ll
drag you.”

Mr. Bond, who lives in the little
community of Cisco just north of
Chatsworth, said he was the largest
sourwood honey producer in Ten-
nessee before he moved to Georgia.
He now buys ginseng and furs from

more than 4,000 people in the .

Southeast.

BOSTON GLOBE - Sept. 7, 1988

For bears, ;

the real _
w problem
is people

-PRESERVE, Alaska -— “Managing
bear-human conﬂict is 90 percent

‘human management,” said Jo- -

seph Van Horn, who has this re-
.sponsibility at the park.

The conﬂict between visitors
and park resources can take
many forms. Here at Denali, con-
sidered by many the most out-
standing wilderness and wildlife
park in the country, bear—people
conﬂicts escalated dramatically. in
the 19705 after a paved state high-
way reached the park and visita-
tion increased sevenfold.

By 1981, Denali had won the
dubious distinction of having the
highest rate of bear-people en-
counters in the entire national
park system. In the back country
areas the incident rate rose to 90
per 100,000 visitor nights, which
was extremely high compared
with other parks where grizzlies
live.

In the past six years, however,
resource managers at Denali have
developed simple but effective
ways to make the park'safer not
only for visitors, but also for
bears.

Savvy wildlife managers have
long recognized that humans usu-
ally bear the lion’s share of the
blame in human-animal conﬂicts.
In the case of bears, careless han-
dling and disposal of food and gar-
bage allows bears to develop a
dangerous taste for things such as
peanut butter and granola.

“Mugger bears"

Some national parks have had
problems with “mugger bears"
who learned that they could get
backpackers to abandon their
packs if they accosted them along
the trail.

Regardless of the human role,
however, problem bears have in-
evitably taken the rap. In tradi-
tional bear management pro-
grams, any bear who began nos-
ing around campgrounds in
search of food was trapped and de—
ported to distant locations. If a
persistent bear managed to find
its way back to the campground.
often as not it was shot. .

 

 

Such an approach posed a par—
ticular dilemma for a wilderness

park such as Denali, said Van '

Horn. “We were moving enough
bears that we could be having an
effect on the natural system." And
besides, he said, “it’s been shown
over and over again that reloca-
tion doesn’t work." Worst of all.
failure meant having to kill bears
in a park set aside to protect
them.

Casting about for alternatives.
park resource specialists decided
in 1982 to turn their attention to
prevention.

But keeping bears from getting
food from backpackers on Dena-
li’s treeless tundra was easier said
than done. In wooded areas,
campers try, not always success-
fully. to outwit bears by slinging
their packs over a line strung high
up between two trees.

Smart about food

“They are incredibly smart
when they want food.” said Van
Horn. _ /'/‘" ._

Denali park managers did not
want to require backpackers to
camp at designated sites or town-
struct bear-proof food lockers in
this untouched wilderness.

After trial, error and bear test-
ing. the park hit on a simple, ele-
gant way to foil bears that has re-
duced incidents in the back coun-
try by 88 percent. When back-
packers receive a permit to go into
Denali’s back country, they also
receive a portable black plastic
food container that weighs 3
pounds and has loops for attach-
ing it to a backpack.

The park service has also been
working on techniques to change
the behavior of bears who had al-
ready developed a taste for human
food. When a report is made that a
bear has bothered backpackers,
Van Horn goes to the campsite
and sets up an ambush. To lure
the bear back into camp. he cooks
a pot of Lipton chicken soup.
Then he hides himself in a tent.

When the bear appears, it gets
pelted with a plastic shotgun pel—
let developed by the Canadian
Wildlife Service to condition polar
bears. This plastic bullet packs a
mean sting, Van Horn said, but it
does not harm the bear. The idea,
he said. is to make the bear afraid
of the camp, but not of humans.

This technique has been tried
in only a few cases, he said, but it
seems to have worked so far.

“Last year, no bear got, food
from backpackers in the back
country,” said the park’s resource
manager. John Qalle—Molle. “We
don’t have problem bears to kill
and move any mere.”

Surrogate Mothering
—— Panther Style

Florida’s big cats may have a new
chance at survival.

Wildlife scientists in Florida, along
with representatives of the National Zoo
in Washington who are determined to
save the endangered Florida panther.
have for the first time succeeded in fer—
tilizing eggs using sperm from one Flor-
ida panther and ‘sperm and eggs from
several wild Texas cougars, which are
members of the same species. Ten em-
bryos were implanted into two of the
cougars, who will serve as surrogate
mothers. Whether this University of
Florida study will result in live births
will not be known for at least a month,
says the Florida Panther Reintroduction
Project, operated by the state Game and
Fresh Water Fish Commission.

Only a few dozen wild panthers re-
main in Florida, their number having
dwindled due to hunting and loss of

habitat. Wildlife laws forbid using Flor— .

ida panthers in experimental programs.
If kittens are produced in this effort, the
female cougars will be temporarily re-
moved from the wild to serve as sur-
rogates for the Florida panthers, says
Dr. Melody Roelke, a veterinarian with
the commission’s Wildlife Research
Laboratory. Any kittens born to either
cougar will remain with the mother for
14 months, learning to hunt and defend
themselves before being released into a
designated wildlife area. “Even if the
surrogates don’t produce babies,” says
Roelke, “we consider this [embryo im—
plantation] a tremendous success.”

Blaze, a small collie, was
lying under the porch of the
Hecox family’s Illinois farm-
house to escape the hot sun
when he spotted the Hecox’s
25-year-old daughter Dawn
toddling across the yard -—
straight toward disaster.

Wandering away from her
mother, Dawn had caught
sight of the new litter of pigs
rooting in the farm’s pigpen.
Fascinated, she slowly made
her way toward them. As she
crawled beneath the bottom
board of the pigpen, the or-
nery mother hog spied her.

Dawn toddled toward a
lone piglet. The sow, infuri-
ated, lowered her head and
began her charge. Ramming
her full weight into the little
girl, the sow knocked Dawn

 

 

against a fence post. As
Dawn crumpled helplessly to

the ground, the sow’s teeth .

ripped at her. Sharp hooves
sliced into the child’s body.

Under the porch, Blaze
heard the sow’s screams of
rage and leaped to his feet. A
glance in the direction of the
pigpen brought the sight of
little Dawn’s plight.

Scrambling out from un-

across the barnyard. With a

and flew at the sow. Lunging
for her throat, he sank his
teeth into the thick, bristly
skin and hung on.

and swung Blaze sideways,

furious pig lunged at Dawn
again, Blaze shook himself
and leaped forward.

The collie clamped his
teeth into the hog’s flank. En-
raged, the sow turned on the
dog. Blaze was no match for
the big hog, but his onslaught
bought Dawn enough time to
escape.

Mr. and Mrs. Hecox, alert-

Badly "banded Pigeon Delivers
Note Tliat Saved ”.5. Soldiers

By zu VINCENT

The Battle of the Argonne, fought in September/October
1918, was one of the most bitter of World War 1. Cher Ami, a

small racing pigeon trained to

messages over the battlefield, became

a legend during that epic strug-
gle.

On October 2, the seventh day of
fighting, Cher Ami and four other
pigeons accompanied the US. 308th
Regiment into combat. One battalion
of 700 men, commanded by Maj.
Charles W. Whittlesey, penetrated
deep into the enemy’s front.

In their determined attack, Whit-
tlesey and his men advanced beyond
their SUpporting forces. The Ger-
mans had them surrounded and
were smothering them with mortar
and machine-gun fire.

Ami recovered from his wounds, he
was shipped to the United States
aboard a naval warship. He lived
the rest of his life as an honored
pet of the Signal Corps in Washing-
ton D.C.

As for Maj. Whittlesey and his
men, they fought their way out and
Maj. Whittlesey was awarded the
Congressional Medal of Honor. Cher
Ami was awarded the French War
Cross, for bravery.

Richards, Cher Ami’s handler, re- "
leased a first and then a second pi- ' ‘

geon with messages requesting artil-
lery support, ammunition and medi-
cal supplies. The birds never ar-
rived at headquarters. A third pie
geon was sent aloft on October 4 but
it didn’t make it, either.

The battalion had dwindled to 245
men. Then, in the worst hours of the
siege, American artillery began
shelling the trapped U.S. battalion.

Richards inched to the pigeon
cage and withdrew a bird. Before he
could put the message in its leg
tube, the bird flew free. He reached
for the last pigeon, Cher Ami.

The message was slipped into the
small metal tube attached to Cher
Ami’s right leg. It gave the battal-
ion’s position and the plea: “For
God’s sake, lift your firei“

Set free, Cher Ami flew above the
battlefield and circled to pick up di-
rection. It was more than 20 miles
through enemy fire to home.

Suddenly a bullet crashed into his
head, tearing out his left eye. The pi~
geon tumbled toward earth. Shrap-
nel tore. into his chest, destroying
his breastbone.

He plummeted. But the compass
in his head, the instinct for home,
fought back and he flew on. Cher
Ami was struck a third time,
one leg ripped away by more shrap-
nel.

When the pigeon finally arrived
at headquarters, he was a mass of
blood and feathers. Miraculously,
the message was still there, hanging
from the remains of his right leg.

Immediately, the cease-fire or-
der went out to the American artil-
lery batteries pounding on Maj.

Jacobson lay nearly three-quar-

High weeds along the shoulder and
the dark night hid him from passing
motorists. The man was uncon-
scious.

Albert Jacobson, an Everett resi-
dent, had been struck by a car as he
made his way home along the high-
way. Immobilized by massive inter-
nal injuries, the elderly man lay
still.

The Sheepdog leaped up out of the
ditch and raced home.

Minutes later, her owner Bob
Spurling woke to the sound of his
dog making a hair-raising clamor be-
neath his raised window.

Spurling ordered the dog to lie
down. Instead, the usually well-be-
haved Muggie barked louder. Spurl-
ing had never seen her so upset.

As soon as the light switched on
indoors, Muggie leaped for the back
door and scratched relentlessly at
the screen. When Spurling ap-
peared in his pants and robe, she
ran to the edge of the yard and back
again. He grabbed a flashlight.

Muggie gave a frenzied yelp and

Out on the road, Spurling tried to
give up on what he thought was a

back to him and tugged on his arm
with such desperation that he re-
lented.

Jacobson was lying just where
Muggie left him. Still unconscious,
he was rapidly bleeding to death.
When the dog reached him, she laid
a paw gently across his back and
then stretched out protectively
alongside him.

“My God!” Spurling breathed,
shining the light over the crumpled
form.

Given emergency medical care
and many days of bed rest, Jacobson
recovered from the hit-and-run acci-
dent and often visited the dog which
had saved his life. The two had
never met before that fateful night
in March 1930, but they soon became
good friends.

‘ Boat ps ‘ ‘Dedicated to Whales"

 

 

 

 

A humpback whale begins a dive near Mount Desert Rock.

For more than a decade,
Maine Whalewatch, with its
cruise passengers eager to see
marine wildlife, has been offer-
ing daily trips from June
through September out of
Northeast Harbor. But the dif-
ference between
Whalewatch vessels and other
excursion boats off Mount
Desert Island is as vast as the
ocean beneath their hulls.

Maine W halewatch, a private
education and research
organization, operates two
vessels, The Island Queen and
The Seal, that are more than
pleasure boats; they are
research, vessels with the
passengers paying for fuel and
equipment. As Capt. Bob
Bowman says with deep feel-
ing: “We’re not doing it for the
money. . .our trips are
dedicated to the whales.”

Bowman is a research...

Maine

associate at Allied Whale, a
research arm of the College of
the Atlantic in Bar Harbor. in
1976 he started Maine
Whalewatch to fund Allied
Whale, and proceeds from the
trips provide monies for
research of the finback and
humpback whale. Allied Whale

is now the central cataloguing '

agency for finbacks and hump-

. backs for the entire north Atlan-

tic hemisphere. The‘cataloguing
effort has provided more infor-
mation about the population
size and life histories of these
endangered whales than has
been learned in any other way.

Bowman and his staff, com-
posed of COA

marine mammals year-round in
New England, Mexico, and the '
Caribbean. During the winter of _'
1987, Bowman workedin the

associates and students working ,
on specific projects, work with ‘

Sea of Cortex in Mexico with
finback and blue whales; last

winter he spent in the Domican .

Republic, and he expects to
return there for more research
this winter.

Since 1976, the researchers
have catalogued 3,800 hump-
backs. Humpbacks come back

year after year to Maine to feed _
and are one of the area’s most

commonly sighted whales.
ACcording to Bowman, the
cataloguing of finbacks, the sec-
ond largest whales in the world,
is a fairly new thing. “Most
people 10 years ago did not
think finbacks could be iden-‘
tified as individuals. In 1985,,we ,'

_..l

began photographically identi-
fying finbacks, and we now
have 200 from the local study
area around Mt. Desert Rock,”
he said. ‘ ’

“The Rock” is a remote,
three-acre island located 25
miles south of Mount Desert
Island. It is home to the marine
research station operated by
COA during the summer.

Maine Whalewatch makes its
day-long whale and seabird
cruises to Mt. Desert Rock,
Matinicus Rock, and as
Bowman puts it: “anywhere I
will find whales.”

“Of course, we can’t
guarantee whales, but our
sighting average is very high,
and passengers feel that even
on the possible few days
without whales, their time was
enjoyably spent. Harbor por-
poise and grey seals are seen on
virtually every trip," said
Bowman. Since the third week
of June, Maine Whalewatch has
had a 100 percent sighting
record, even on those foggy

days in August. .

The search for seabirds is
another important part of the
cruise. Regular sightings include
loons, greater and sooty shear- ’
waters, puffins, gannets,
Wilson’s storm-petrels, red and
red-necked phalaropes, and
great ,cormorants.

Maine Whalewatch cruises
are all-day trips, and many of
Bowman’s passengers are
repeaters who have found the
trip a true naturalist experience. .
Bowman’s dream is to educate
more people about marine
wildlife in its environment and
to involve them in the Adopt a
Finback Whale program
through Allied Whale so that
more research can be done on
the whales.

By contrast, Bowman’s
nightmare is that more an
more people will be operatin
lucrative excursion boat}
businesses, and that the en-f
dangered species will be
exploited.

“I’m having a hard time with
that right now,” he said recent-
ly. Bowman’s whale watching is
nonintrusive. Before his boat
moves in for a closer inspection,

at least half of the data on the
whale is compiled. If the whale

~buy~for has been made easy by

two wildlife groups in Maine.
What could be a more im-
pressive gift than a finback
whale, or cuter than a baby
puffin?

To help fund the finback
research and educate the public
to the plight of the whales,
Allied Whale is offering whales
for“‘adoption." For $30, adop-
tive families receive a color
photograph of their whale, a
history of it, and a record of its
sightings. For $50 a mother and
her calf can be adopted. All pro-
ceeds go toward helping Allied
Whale continue its program of
identifying finbacks. The adop-
tion lasts for one year, and a
$15 renewal fee updates sight-
ings each year.

Another creature of the sea
that is endangered is the Atlan-
tic puffin, a cute little bird with
a penguin’s body and a bright
red and orange beak. The Na-
tional Audubon Society has
undertaken Project Puffin to
restore and protect puffins on
their historic nesting islands off
the Maine coast. The puffin
vanished from many of its usual
breeding grounds 100 years ago
due to overhunting for food and
for feathers used in ladies’ hats.

Now on the federal en-
dangered species list, these
birds with the sad eyes and
comical habit of hopping from
rock to rock have been saved
from the risk of hunting but
must face predation from gulls
and encroaching human activi-
ty at nesting colonies.

Project Puffin has stations on
four Maine islands. In 1984 the
program began transplanting
chicks to Seal Island and will
continue moving 200 chicks
each year through 1989, hoping
they will return in adult years
to breed.

The program is funded total-

ly through private donations '

and the Audubon Society‘ hopes
people will adopt puffins as
unusual birthday or holiday
gifts. A puffin chick will be
assigned for each contribution
of $7100. Adopters will be
notified of the fleging date and
will receive annual reports of
future sightings at Maine puffin
colonies. '

DEKALB NEIGHBOR - Atlanta — September 21, 1988

New animal control center ready by. summer

By Eden Jackson
Neighbor sum Writer

As early as next summer, De-
Kalb’s new $1.7 million animal
control center will be improving the
efficiency of DeKalb Animal Control
and the care of animals confined
there.

The new facility will be at the
intersection _of Camp and Kens-
ington roads in Decatur on the site
once occupied by the DeKalb Ex-
tension Service cannery, demolished

to provide for the new animal
control facility.

“The DeKalb County Commission

 

 

was very good to us to realize our

situation and allocate the funds
several years ago; and last year
they put the funds into this year’s
budget and we went ahead and got
an architect to design the building
and put out the bids,” said Capt.
Harry Wood, commander of DeKalb

Animal Control.

 

 

 

 

NOT FIT FOR MAN NOR BEAST: The present animal control center will be replaced soon because
it was built on a land-fill site,.and the building is coming apart due to settling of the ground
underneath. Kennel supervisor John Williams points out where the cement is pulling away from the
building and the separation of the gutter and sidewalk.

Barge Construction Co. was
awarded the construction contract

for the building, which is scheduled
to be completed by next summer.

The new facility will house about
500 dogs and cats in a 25,000 square-
foot building that will include separ-
ate wards for the animals to be
adopted and for wildlife such as
Opossums, raccoons and ferrets,
which are occasionally brought to
the county facility for holding until
the state animal control authorities
pick them up.

The new facility will also include
more office space for the animal
control administration, which has a
staff of 40, and a veterinary treat-
ment area that will be staffed by a
full-time verterinarian. Larger
quarantine space will also be
provided for sick animals.

“The county has come up with the
money for one of the nicest animal
control facilities in the state or even
the Southeast,” said Wood. ‘

The new facility will also have a
classroom so that animal control
staff can be given in-service instruc-

tion in animal handling and control.

“I expect that one day animal
control officers will have to be
certified, though they’re not re
quired to now. Two thirds of our
officers already have been ac-
credited by the National Academy
sponsored by the National Humane
Society in Tuscaloosa, Ala.,” said
Wood.

DeKalb’s present facility. was
built in 1971 on a land—fill site.

The Perfect Place to Picnic ~
- Is Ellsworth ’s Birdsacre .

Among the fast food
restaurants. shopping malls,
and motels on High Street in
Ellsworth is a 100-acre wildlife
sanctuary hidden from the road
except for a small sign marking
the entrance to Birdsacre.

The sanctuary contains
ponds, gardens, trails, and pic-
nic areas. it also has a Children’s
Acre and scenic sites such as
the Queen’s Throne, Miles of
nature trails wind through the

woods. The home of Cordelia
Stanwood, the pioneering or-
nithologist who founded Birds-
acre, is preserved in its turn-of-
the-century style.

During Stanwood’s 93 years,
she observed and recorded the
birds in these same woods that
visitors enjoy today. Many of
her belongings, including her
field books, remain in the
house, which is on the National
Register of Historic Places.

Stanwood also took wonder-
ful photographs of birds in the
wild and one of her pictures
became famous as an illustra-
tion of the children’s classic, Six
Little Chickadees.

The sanctuary continues to
carry out her life’s work of
studying and rehabilitating in-
jured birds. Birds are released
into the wild after rehabilitation
and ones that cannot be re-
leased are on display at Birds-
acre. The owl exhibit is
especially popular, with Ollie
the Owl greeting young visitors.
Hawks, falcons, _and domesti-
cated ducks, geese, and more
all reside at the sanctuary.

Less than $60,000 has been
raised toward the goal of
$200,000 for the nature center,
with construction beginning
next spring.

The sanctuary hosts about
10,000 peOple a year from all
over the country and from
foreign nations. The grounds of
Birdsacre are open year-round
from dawn to dusk and make a
great spot for a picnic. The gift

Mrs. Constance F. Yarbrough

Atlanta, GA 30345

U.S.A.

Dear Mrs. Yarbrough:

Thank you for your letter of May 20, 1988, regarding the seal hunt in
Canada.

In order to clarify the government's new seal policy, I am enclosing a
copy of my December 30, 1987, news release which clearly outlines the
new policy directions for the seal harvest. ’

I would like to emphasize that with the elimination of the large vessel
hunt which focused on the hunting of whitecoats, the remaining harvest
is now less than one third of the size of the historic harvest. It is
no longer a large scale commercial harvest but has, with the
implementation of our new policy, become an activity related to the
cultural, traditional and economic survival of Inuit and rural coastal
inhabitants whose alternative Opportunities are extremely limited.

You should know, for example, that in many Northern communities, over
seventy-five percent of the community's income, prior to 1982 was
derived from sealing. This income helped to finance subsistence hunting
for other species thereby ensuring a viable community. The loss of this
income as a result of protest activity had a devastating effect on the
livelihoods of individual Families and the community as a whole. The
same phenomenon has affected other communities in the north as well as
in Labrador. For the coastal fishing communities in Newfoundland and
parts of Quebec, while sealing only contributed a portion of their
relatively small annual income, for centuries it was nevertheless very
significant and served as an important cultural and economic factor in
their livelihoods.

This remaining harvest has as one of its basic principles, maximum use
of the harvested animals, which reduces waste and produces meat, fur,
leather and oil. The vast majority of seal meat, has been and continues
to be consumed by humans with the remainder being transformed for other
uses, as is being done in the meat and fish processing industries.

Thank you for your interest in this matter.

Yours sincerely,

Tom Siddon, P.C., M.P.

NR-HQ-IIIE FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 30, 1987

IMPLEMENTATION OF MALOUF RECOMMENDATIONS AND
NEW SEAL POLICY ANNOUNCED

OTTAWA - The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, The Honourable Tom
Siddon, today announced implementation of key recommendations of
the Royal Commission on Seals and Sealing, chaired by Mr. Justice
MaIOUfo '

The Government has had an opportunity to examine the
recommendations closely since the Report was released in December
1986, and to consult widely on the issues raised in it. The new
policy being implemented is the result.

Under the new seal policy, the government will no
longer permit the large vessel offshore seal hunt in Canadian
waters. All commercial hunting~of whitecoat harp seals and
blueback hooded seals will be ended.

As the Royal Commission recommended, the annual harvest.

' of older seals by Inuit and other coastal people will continue.
New Seal Protection Regulations, covering all seals in Canadian
waters, will ensure that the harvest is conducted as humanely as
possible and in accordance with the principles of the World
Conservation Strategy and the guidelines outlined by the Royal
Commission. The netting of seals will be phased out over five
years except for traditional hunts north of 53 degrees north
latitude.

The government will continue to work with the Inuit
Tapirisat of Canada and the Canadian Sealers Association to
ensure sound harvesting practices and to utilize the earlier
authorized $5 million funding to develop new opportunities for
the sealers and sealing communities that were affected by the
collapse of the sealing industry.

 

 

 

 

Can ad'a "

 




"The serious consideration of a grey seal cull
recommended by the Royal Commission has been undertaken," said_
Mr. Siddon. "After widespread consultations it has become clear
that, while the grey seal represents a problem for the fishing
industry, the scientific evidence is not as yet strong enough to
justify a cull. We are launching, with the assistance of the
fishing industry, a collaborative research program designed to
establish the facts and explore alternative ways of controlling
the grey seal population."

 




 

SICK OF HIS MENAGERIEA TROIS,
GERALD YOAKUM’S NEIGHBORS WANT
HIS HOUSE TO BECOME SANS SIMIAN

Foster dad Yoakum feeds a nourishing breakfast of ice cream and veggies to Joshua.

The residents of First Colony, Texas,
are proud of their manicured bedroom
community in the HOuston suburbs. It
has a golf course, swimming pools,
man-made lakes and rivers. Some of
the homes cost as much as $1 million,
and First Colony is a real community, a
great place to raise children, human
children, that is. ’
Gerald Yoakum, 26, once thought
First Colony would be a great place to
raise his furry, fanged children, Joshua
and Jason, which is why he moved
there in 1986. His neighbors, though,
want Yoakum to move to some other
fine community—and take his children
with him. The problem, as the neigh- _
bors see it, is that the Yoakum boys
smell bad and have disgusting groom—
ing habits. Josh and Jason, the neigh-
bors say, scamper along the tops of
fences. Sometimes, they say, the boys
can be seen perched on the roof, glar-
ing at passersby and baring their teeth.
And those teeth, with their upper and
lower matching sets of truly formidable
fangs, are apt to make the neighbors
nervous. The fact of the matter is that
Joshua and Jason are olive baboons,
native to West Africa and seldom seen
in suburban America. Now the neigh-

I

bors are chasing the mixed-species
Yoakum family out of town. When they
go, two other residents of the house—
William Hall, 23, a Michael Jackson
impersonator, and .Yoakum’s divorced
father, James—will go with them.

Yoakum, an exotic dancer who shim—
mies for the Ding-a-Ling Monkey-
shines, a strip—o-gram service, under
the stage name Magnum, thinks the
whole situation isjust terrible. “The
boys,” as he insists on calling his ba-
boons, are family. In fact, Yoakum got
them because he couldn’t have a more
traditional kind of family. “My girlfriend
and l were trying to have a baby,” he
says. “When nothing happened, I went
to the doctor and was told I’d never be
able to have children.”

Many people in this situation opt to
adopt. So did Yoakum—he went to the
Big Three Acre Farm, a private 200, to
see what kind of surrogate children
were available. At the 200, he spotted
a baby baboon, which he bought for
$1,000. “I named him Joshua James—
Joshua because that’s a good biblical
name and James for my father,” he
says. At the time Yoakum was living in
Houston, which has a law against the
possession of exotic beasts like ba-

boons, so he moved—to First Colony,
where he paid $49,500 for his modest,
three—bedroom brick house.

At first, no one in First Colony
seemed to mind. Yoakum devoted
himself to being a good baboon daddy.
“Joshua had been abused by his previ—
ous owner, so for the whole first year i
spent a lot of time holding him close to
me so he could learn to trust me,” Yoa-
kum says. He petted Joshua, and, in-
deed, he Pampered him, since ba-
boons do not take to housebreaking.

One day a keeper at the zoo told
Yoakum that he had another baby ba—
boon in need of a home. That was how
Jason Zachary joined the Yoakum
household. Yoakum built a cage house
for the boys to play in. He dressed
them up, and he took them on outings.
They played ball and hung out together
in the backyard hot tub. “I generally

spend five or six hours a day with
them,” says Yoakum. “I read to them,
or sometimes I just sit and talk to
them.” The baboons and their father
became familiar figures at such local
events as ice-cream parlor openings.

Then last fall something went sour
between First Colony and the Yoakum
ménage; A group of residents com—
plained to the county AnimalControl Di—
vision about odor and noise. Yoakum
thinks the whole hullabaloo was related
to property values. Indeed, Jeannine
Haller, one of the neighbors, told a
Houston paper, “Who would want to buy
a house next door to a baboon?”

trol Division, District Attorney Larry

 

 

 

 

 




Wagenbach intervened in the case. “I
talked to several wild-animal experts,"
he says, “and they all said there was
no doubt that baboons could be vi-
cious. If we don’t do something about
them and one of them hurts some-
body, then what happens?” David
Ruhter, curator of mammals at the
Houston Zoo and one of the experts
Wagenbach consulted, says, “There
are reported incidents in Africa where
baboons have killed children.”

Last month, just before a scheduled
court hearing, Yoakum signed an
agreement that gives him 120 days to
find a new place to live. In the mean-
time, the baboons will be kept locked
in their cage or in the house.

URRICANE Gilbert may
have destroyed the only
known breeding habitat of

the most endangered of all
sea turtle species, naturalists re-
ported yesterday.

The 15-mile stretch of beach on
Mexico’s northern Gulf coast where
Kemp’s Ridley sea turtles lay their
eggs was directly in the path of the
hurricane’s center. According to Pat-
rick Burchfield, curator of reptiles at
the Gladys Porter Zoo in Brownsville,
Tex., Kemp’s Ridley (Lepidochelys
kempi) turtles are so attached to this
spot that its destruction could seal the
extinction of the species.

“At this point,” he said, “we don’t
know whether the,30—foot—wide beach
at the Rancho Nuevo Sanctuary can
still be used for turtle nesting or not.
But if it has been as badly damaged
as. we fear, the consequences for
these animals is likely to be severe.”

Importance of Narrow Beach

The reason Kemp’s Ridley turtles
nest only at Rancho Nuevo beach is
not known. Scientists speculate that a
narrow beach like this one is essential
if baby turtles are to survive the
scorching heat of the sun as they
make their run for the water after
hatching. Nearby steep sand dunes
also appear to be essential to the nest-
ing pattern when mothers dig their
18-inch egg-clutch burrows. Scientists

U .

 

Kemp’s Ridley
turtles return each
year to the same
beach to breed.

 

- believe this beach also has other so-
far undetermined qualities essential
to the nesting turtles.

Naturalists cannot plan strategy on
behalf of the turtles until they deter-
mine whether Hurricane Gilbert de-
stroyed the beach irreparably or not.
Mr. Burchfield said he would charter
an airplane to try to land there and in-
spect the turtle nesting area in the
next few days.

NEW YORK TIMES - September 20, 1988

iol,..oeists Fear Hurricane May Have
Doomed Rare Turtles

An adult Kemp’s Ridley has a shell
diameter of about 32 inches and may
weigh as much as 85 pounds. Ashore,
the turtles’ predators include
coyotes, coatimundis,

skunks, vultures and many other ani-
mals. The turtle’s habitat is believed
to be largely restricted to the Gulf of
Mexico.

Effort to Protect Species

In 1978, Wildlife experts from the
United States and Mexico began a
joint project to try to save the dwin-
dling species. The Mexican Govern-
ment created a breeding sanctuary
for the turtles at Rancho Nuevo due
east of Via Aldama, bounded on the
north by Barra Ostiones and on the
south by Barra del Tordo.

In the breeding season, which ex-
tends from early April to the first
week in September, a detachment of
Mexican marines guards the site
against poachers. A dozen American
and Mexican biologists and a contin-
gent of volunteers from both coun-
tries have also worked at the site
each breeding season for the past
decade to improve the turtles’ repro-
duction rate.

When a female turtle digs her nest
in a sand dune to lay about 100 eggs,
the chances are that the nest, if left
unguarded, may be visited as often as

twice a night by predators, Mr.
Burchfield said. The female leaves
and heads out to sea the moment her
last egg has been laid and the clutch
has been buried. ‘

It is impossible for the volunteers
and other conservationists to guard

, each nest during an incubation period

lasting up to 52 days. To protect the
eggs, the volunteers remove them all,

The danger, Mr. Burchfield said is
that when adult females return next

iar nesting site and may thus be un-
able to reproduce. Thev mav lack tho

i , wit and energy to look for alternative
' beaches to the north or south, and
; thus fail to make any nests at all.

Although these turtles range
throughout the Gulf of Mexico, they
return each year to the same beach,
much as spawning salmon return to
the same rivers.

The United States Fisheries and
Wildlife Service and other federal
and state agencies of the United

= States and Mexico, as well as the

Gladys Porter Zoo, have tried to
create new breeding areas. Accord-

‘L‘argely because of human preda-
' tion, the world population of Kemp’s
.Ridley turtles has declined cata-
- strophically. During one day alone in
1947, naturalists counted more than
.40,000 female turtles coming ashore
l'r'to nest at Rancho Nuevo. During the
past two years, however, only some
500 turtles have come ashore during
'an entire season. .

place, and will return there to nest
after reaching maturity. This would

’ offer 'an alternative breeding site to
Rancho Nuevo. But none of the babies
have yet matured, so naturalists do
not yet know how the experiment'will
turn out.

ical peculiarity of the water, or the;
earth’s geomagnetic field at that

s,pot or perhaps even the size of sand
particles on the beach.

Besides the experimental turtle 1m-
printing program at Padre Island,
conservationists have established a

- captive breeding program in the Cay-
man Islands, but scientists say the
latter program could never become
self-sustaining, because turtles will
never return to the Caymans to nest.

During the decade after World War
II, the main threat to Kemp’ s Ridley
turtles was the gathering and eating
of turtle eggs by humans.

“During that period,” Mr. Woody
said, “the turtle population fell badly.
Mexico eventually moved to protect
the nesting beach, but then shrimp
fishing became a major economic
factor in the Gulf, and many Kemp’s

PRESS a SUN-BULLETIN - August 13, 1988 ROANOKE, VA

Ading has taken a

Rex Harrison did it on the screen
in Doctor Dolittle. Doris Day does it
in real life. She talks to the animals.

Day, on the phone from Carmel,
Calif, excuses herself for a mo-
ment. There’s a dog barking in the
background. “Who’s that barking?”
she shouts in a friendly tone. “What
are you doing here?” Day comes
back to the phone. “It was Schat-
zee,” she explains. “Schatzee
wanted to come‘into the kitchen. I
didn’t know she was in the hall-
way.”.

The 64-year-old Day also didn’t
know that perhaps her greatest dra-
matic-film performance — in 1955’s
Love, Me or Leave Me — had just
been released on videocassette.

The blond, bubbly Day starred in
some 50 films and garnered a 1959
Oscar nomination for the comedy
classic Pillow Talk with Rock Hud-
son. She hasn’t made a movie since
1968’s With Six You Get Eggroll and
hasn’t- acted in series television
since the CBS’s The Doris Day Show
went off the air in 1973.

For the last 10 years, for Day, en-
tertainment has taken a backseat
to protecting animals. And animals
still are at the forefront of her life.
In fact, Day’s publicist made this
interview conditional: Talk about
the animals or don’t talk at all.

Doris Day co-founded Actors and
Others for Animals in 1971, the Do-
ris Day Pet Foundation in 1977
and, more recently, had a brief run
with a pet-care TV series on Pat
Robertson’s CBN cable network.
Last year, she founded the Wash-
ingtonbased Doris Day Animal
League.

The Pet Foundation organizes for
free spaying and neutering of ani-
mals, as well as caretaking and

adoption services for animals in

the Carmel area. The Animal
League exists primarily to lobby
Congress for legislation to prevent
animal experimentation abuses.

Her message? Americans must
neuter and spay their cats and
dogs. “But it isn’t happening fast
enough. Sometimes I just, say,
‘We’re never gonna see the light of
day) 33

But she keeps plugging away.
Living with her dogs and cats on an
‘ 11-acre ranch in Carmel, she seems

.like any one of her cheery, optig

mistic movie characters. One of the
first things that hits you about Do-
ris Day, the woman, is that she is
Doris Day — the husky-voiced
charmer whose records and screen
work have won over a legion of
fans, including some of today’s
youngsters.

“I still get letters from children
who think I’m Calamity Jane,” she
says, laughing, referring to her
1953 movie-musical hit. Unlike the
fans, Day doesn’t live in the past.
She says she hates to watch her
own work on video. “No,” she
moans. “I would like to redo it all. I
suppose most people are like that.”

Although she doesn’t blurt.it out.
you get the impression that Day is
ready to make another movie or TV
series.

“If I could find something good
to do, I’d like to do it here (in Car-
mel). I like to be with the animals
and I like to be in my own home. I
don’t think the climate (in Los An-

geles) is right. The smog, you know.

“No,” she continues, in a soft,
low tone. “I don’t think I’ve done
anything great. I think that maybe
I will sometime. That would be
nice.”

teaching stint in Turkey, where
she noticed handicapped people
used burros to carry themselves
and their. belongings. When Ber—
gin returned to the United States,
she decided dogs would do the
trick.

“She started in her kitchen
with one disabled person and one
puppy,” said Karen Luton, direc-
tor of the company’s regional
training center in Santa Rosa,
Calif. “They became the proto-
type.”

The dogs cost $6,000 each to
train but are sold for $125 to any
physically handicapped person
who demonstrates the need. The
company is funded by private
donations.

“Don’t pet the dog,” reads a
sign on Yarrow’s back. “He’s not
here to play. He is here to help
me be more independent. Please
don’t bother him while he’s
working.”

And working is what Yarrowf
does best. i

On a busy Friday afternoon ini
Herrin’s bank, he readies Yarrow :
for a transaction. “You gonna be
a g’boy? You gonna be a g’boy?”
Herrin coos to the canine.

The bank teller places a $20
bill on the counter. Herrin says
“Up,” and Yarrow puts his front
paws on the counter. He says
“Get,” and Yarrow paws at the
bill, pushing it into his mouth.
The dog jumps down to give the
money to his master; it is marred
with teeth marks.

“Normally, he doesn’t chew it
up,” Herrin said. “He’s trying to
make me a fool.”

Herrin said he knows what’s
going on in Yarrow’s head, be-
cause he’s well-versed in canine
psychology.

Herrin had to pass a textbook
course on the subject and under—
go a grueling two-week training
session called “boot camp” to
qualify for the dog.

“They can’t leave boot camp
with that dog until they prove
they can take care of that dog,”
said Luton.

Because the soon-to-be dog
owners don’t have the physical
capability to control the animals,
Luton said they must demon-
strate human-mind over canine-
mind.

Yarrow has dominant tenden-
cies and often tries to take
charge, said Herrin, who insists
he keeps the dog in line by out—
thinking him.

“In reality, he is a dog. But
psychologically, he is not a dog.
He has too much potential. He
knows how to get to me, I mean,
. to make me mad,” he said. “He

 

could’ve done better at the bank, '

 

but he goofed up to see how I’d
react, to see if I am in the leader- ,
ship role.” '

Herrin says Yarrow does more
than just make life easier physi—
cally, for example, by pulling
him in his manual wheelchair
when the bulky motorized one
must be left behind.

“When I am sad, he will try to
give me love,” he said. “He will
try to do something for me. He
will try to please me.”

He has nicknamed the dog
“Son” because he says he is like
one. “When you comb your hair
in the mirror, you see who you
are, the same way you see who
you are through your kids,” he
said. “Yarrow taught me to see
who I am.” '

Most days, Herrin can be seen
riding along his neighborhood
streets in his motorized wheel-
chair, Yarrow trotting at his side.
They spend much of the day in a

nearby shopping mall.

“Everybody knows Richard,”
said Mark McGruder, 21, a store
employee.

" But Herrin said he wasn’t al-
ways welcomed by the mall’s
management, who initially told
him the shopping center was no
place for a dog.

“They gave me a hard time at
first, but I let ’em have it,” he
said. Texas law prohibits banning
from public places dogs trained
to help the handicapped.

Herrin says he often finds him-
self teaching others his and Yar-
row’s operating procedures.

“I will give the dog the mon—
ey,” he told a girl behind the

counter of a fast-fwd restaurant. 1

“Don’t just take the money out of
his mouth until you hear me say
‘Give.’ When you give the change
back, you put the dollar bills on

the counter and put the coins in ,Q

the sack. It’s time to work,
Son.”

And when the work is done . . . ,

W henIam sad,

he will try to give me

love.’
Richard Herrin

 

“Gimme me kiss. Gimme me
kiss,” Herrin said in a soft-
spoken, high-pitched ,voice re-
served only for Yarrow, his face
then glistening under a long pink
tongue.

Now, a three-week whale

them from extinction. “We are

The Dallas Morning News: Nun’ Vanbonii

Rodney Marsh, foreman at Fossil Rim Wildlife Ranch, tries to persuade a gazelle to eat some breakfast fruit — only to be rebuffed.

nEASTlVlAS

By Cynthia Sanz
Staff Writer of The Dallas Morning News

GLEN ROSE, Texas — At first glance, the
Fossil Rim ranchers look like most other
cowboy types. They wear boots. They drive
pickups. They spit Red Man.

But Fossil Rim Wildlife Ranch isn’t just

another cattle spread. The ranch’s 1,500,

acres serve as home to 22 species of exotic
animals —— everything from addaxes to
wildebeests.

So its ranchers are a little different, too.
Instead of punching dogies, they’re more
likely to be found punching zebras. And
when the deer and the antelope play, these
guys have to round them up again.

It’s a strange life for three country boys
who studied ranching at Tarleton State Uni-
versity in Stephenville, Texas. But they’re
getting used to it.

“I grew up on a big cattle ranch in Lake
Whitney, so I’m used to being around ani-
mals. But these are completely different,"
says Rodney Marsh, the ranch foreman,
who came to Fossil Rim 31/2 years ago.

Like his co-workers at the ranch, Marsh
wound up at Fossil Rim by accident. An ag-
ricultural business major at Tarleton,
Marsh had taken an office job after gradua-
tion and later decided that he’d rather be
back on a ranch. When he heard that there
was an opening at Fossil Rim, he jumped at
it. After all, he thought, how different
could the animals be? ,

He found out soon enough.

“A lot of them are like cattle in that the
graze, but that’s where the similarity ends,”
he says. ,

Take the zebras, for example. They look
like horses. They even eat like horses. But
after that it gets more complicated.

“We had this zebra that used to run into
the front of the truck and try to chew off
the bumper,” says Marsh, 26. “When he
couldn't do that, he tried to chew the side-
view mirror." .

Why? “Just ‘cause he’s crazy," Marsh
says. “We had to go through his pen to feed
some other animals and he didn’t like the

:truck in his area.”
“WHarsh‘says. he.

.learned to dodge the attacks by

wasting no time when traveling

through the zebra’s neighborhood.

And most of the other zebras have

‘simply gotten used to the rev of the ‘

epickups’ engines, if not to the pres-
fence of the ranchers.

"Although these animals are in
captivity, they’re still wild animals
.and they still have all the basic in-
:stincts and fears,” says Ranch Man-
.-ager Bruce Williams, 29. “You have
‘to'remember that one of those fears
'is human beings."

Williams joined Fossil Rim’s staff
.six years ago, while finishing his
'degree in agricultural education. At
:the time, the ranch was a private
-wildlife ranch, breeding animals
. for zoos and parks around the coun-
I try. (It opened its gates to the public
;four years ago.)

“I had planned to go to work for
ithe soil conservation service and
:had only planned to work here
i about six months,” Williams says. “I
:thought this was the neatest thing
. I'd ever seen."

' Assistant Ranch Manager Kelley
ISnodgrass thought the same thing
: when he signed on with Fossil Rim
°four years ago. A native of Lake
3 Worth, Snodgrass says he expected
,' working with the ranch's LOGO-plus
(animals to be exciting and chal-
: lenging.

- But he didn't expect Little Fella.

; Half American elk and half Euro-
,‘pean elk, Little Fella has figured
3 out that the ranchers carry feed in
v the back of their pickups. So when
i an absent-minded rancher leaves
Ithe tailgate to his truck down for
: any length of time. Little Fella
: jumps in and has a snack.
. “It‘s kind of a weird feeling,”
I says Snodgrass, 27. "You turn
: around and there‘s an elk in your
i truck."
. Still, Little Fella is easy com-
: pared to some of the other animals
I Snodgrass has to deal with. Little
: Fella can be shooed away. Cheetahs
: can’t. So Snodgrass has had to come

 

“With cows and horses
you can make them do
what you want. With
these animals, you have
to figure out a way to
make what you want
something they want.”
—- Bruce Williams,
ranch manager

 

up with his own ways of dealing
with them.

”In the beginning, I was a little
leery,” he says. “I'd never been
around cheetahs before, and I
wasn’t sure I wanted to be.”

Three years later, however,
Snodgrass doesn’t think twice about
walking into the cheetah enclosure.
(The cheetahs are kept in an en-
closed area to prevent them from at-
tacking other animals or tourists.)
When a cocky male cheetah tries to
sneak up behind him, Snodgrass
calmly turns around to face the
cheetah down.

“Half of it was just getting to
know their personalities,“ he says.
“You learn a lot just by watching
them."

Which is a good thing, the ranch-
ers say, because there's virtually no
other way to learn it.

“You're faced with so many dif-
ferent species and situations here
and there‘s no one to call to ask,"
says Williams. The problems of a

rambling ranch are a lot different 3
from the woes of an urban zoo, and ?

specialists in wild gnu behavior
aren’t easy to find.

“We have to dream up ways to do
things," Williams says.

Such as figuring out a way to tag
newborn animals on the ranch
without angry parents throwing a
fit. (More than one of the ranch’s
pickups carry the scars from the at-
tacks of irate parents.)

“They don't really like us to
touch the newborns,” Williams

says. ”We have to grab it, jump in
the pickup bed, and stay in the.
pickup until we’re done with'it."

But the biggest problem for the
ranchers has been catching the ani-
mals.

“How do you catch a giraffe?”
Williams asks. “The approach I take
with these animals is you can‘t
make them do anything. With cows
and horses you can make them do
what you want. With these animals,
you have to figure out a way to
make what you want something
they want."

And when that doesn’t work, the
ranchers wing it.

“Growing up on a cattle ranch
taught me the basics, everything
else we learn by trial and error,“
says Marsh. '

Which is how he figured out that
rolls of toilet paper are the best
cushions for ostrich eggs in the in-
cubator. And that the best way to
administer antibiotics to a baby os-
trich is to hold the bird between
your knees and pry its mouth open.

”I got here right about the same
time the ostriches did, so we just
wound up together,” says Marsh,
who‘s hatched about 150 ostriches
so far this year.

And while the birds‘ insatiable
curiosity sometimes gets on his
nerves (once, they ate his salt and
pepper shakers), he says he
wouldn’t want to go back to ranch-
ing just horses and cattle.

“One thing about the job out

here is that it’s never really the
same thing two days in a row,”
Marsh says. “Once you’ve been out
here, it‘s just not the same."

Terry Grosz, one of the U.S. Fish and

Sho ld

' Wildlife Service’s chief law enforcement 0f?

ﬁcers, calls it “the dark side.”

“These things come from the dark
side,” he explained. “We all have a dark
slide, but you control yours. These people

on’t.”

. By “these people,” he means the repre-
hensible wildlife poachers and slimy mid-
dlemen who slaughter endangered animals
for the proﬁt that can be made on the illicit
black market where the gallbladders of
black'bears are prized as aphrodisiacs, as
are rhinoceros horns, grizzly bear paws,

- swan testicles and sea turtle eggs.

5 Some threatened creatures are consid-
:5 ered Epicurean delights and are big busi-
5: ness for unscrupulous dealers who sell
g.f them to swank restaurants in this country,
a: Europe and Asia. Others are illegally hunt-
eduand eviscerated because their claws,
ﬁfeathers or teeth are highly sought for
; necklacesJand other jewelry.

I
I”

The going rates for these dear trinkets
are pricey, indeed: rhino horns can bring
up to $12,500 per pound; sea turtles eggs,
$250 apiece; turtle shells, $600 a pound;
fake Indian artifacts made with bald eagle
talons and feathers have brought as much
as $12,000 in England. ‘

Bear gallbladders bring $1,000 in Asia,
and, not long ago, a Saudi Arabian buyer

‘paid $103,000 for an Alaskan gyrfalcon that

first sold to a middleman in Anchorage for
$2,000, resold in the mainland U.S. for _
$8,500 and inCanada for $12,000.

Mr. Grosz, whose territory covers Colo-
rado, Kansas, Utah, Montana, Nebraska,

Wyoming and the Dakotas, says: “The com-

mercial market hunter is alive and well.
I’ve been in this business since 1966. At no
time have I seen it worse than it is today.”

The West and Midwest are not the only
areas afflicted by greedy poachers. Last
week, 43 people, including a Georgia man,

were arrested for illegally poaching black
bears in the southern Appalachians and
selling their body parts on the black mar-
ket. The busts resulted from a three-year
investigation by the wildlife service and
agencies in Georgia, Tennessee and North
Carolina.

Frankly, those arrests only made a '
.small dent in this disgusting enterprise. .
Those nabbed will be replaced by others '
eager to pocket the profits. Mr. Grosz says
that in the last seven years, the 20 officers .

Poachers Before It ’s Too Late. A

\ " poachers to prison for terms of three to 15

in his region have helped send 483 criminal

years. “But we‘re (barely) touching it,” he

says.

~ The good guys aren’t winning the battle, ,
' and because they aren’t, a number of Wild-
5 life species may ”disappear within a couple
,5 of generations. The reason? The good guys
5 are outnumbered by the bad guys and may-
; be even outspent. .

The annual budget for Mr. Grosz’soper-
ation is only $1.7 million, the same as it was
seven years ago. Nationwide, the Wildlife
service has fewer enforcement officers to-
day than it had in 1970, even though the in-
cidents of poaching have skyrocketed Since
then. ,

Make sense? Not unless we, as a nation,
really don’t mean any of the things we say
about preserving wildlife and natural re-
sources for our children and their children
to enjoy. Is it just talk?

Maybe we don’t really mind poachers
looking at a grizzly bear and not seeing a
magniﬁcent, proud animal, but a walking
collection of merchandise with price tags
on its head, paws and gallbladder. _

Maybe it doesn’t really pain us to think
iof those bears, slaughtered by poachers, be-
headed, paws chopped off, hides removed,

' carcasses left .to rot. Just another triumph
of commerce over conservation and:

conscience?

But, if we do care, we will give Terry-
Grosz and his colleagues around the coun-
try the resources they need to put poachers
and their associates out of business.

And before we have to explain to our
children’s children that the cute little teddy
:bears they love so much are replicas of real
animals that actually lived among us, once -
upon a time. a —

not having much luck.

“It's hard to get people to care .

“They’re not cute or cuddly and

This puzzles Seippel, who has

“did their best to make me afraid,
telling me that snakes were the

his own four children.

Seippel is the founder of the
Greater San Antonio Herpetologicat
Society, with 80 members from the
Austin-San Antonio, Texas, corridor
who share his love of reptiles. The

group does more than campaign to ‘~

save rattlesnakes. They hold a
yearly convention, where members
are instructed to leave their snakes
at home. “This is not a pet show,” -
Seippel said. “We are educated,

monitor lizard.

Lizard scares neighborhood;

a...

officer nabs reptile after fight

 

By PATTI ROTH
Staff Writer

FORT LAUDERDALE — The critter causing a
commotion in a Lauderdale Manors neighborhood on
Sunday may have been a stowaway on a cargo ship.
Or perhaps it was once someone’s exotic pet.

In any case, the large lizard with a long tail and
claws was not welcomed by those who saw it and
called police for help.

Even the police called police.

Officer Tim Bronson called his former partner,
Detective John “Mongo” Curcio, a former SWAT
team member who is known for his enthusiasm for
reptiles and other animals.

“I’m into snakes and lizards and all kinds of wild
things, so he figured I was the most likely culprit to
get him,” Curcio said.

Police and residents kept their distance from the
shed in the 900 block of Northwest 14th Street where
the animal had sought refuge, Curcio said.

“All the neighbors were either in their house or
back behind the fences,” he said.

“It’s such a minor thing for me to do it and seemed
like a major thing for all the pe0ple because it’s a 4—
foot lizard,” he said. “I go after 250-pound criminals.
That’s what I should be afraid of, not the lizard. I
could tell it was not armed.”

Curcio found the reptile inside a cabinet and
grabbed its tail, but it broke free. About 10 minutes
later, he saw it under a tire.

 

 

“I go after 250-pound
criminals. That’s what 1 should

“I grabbed him by the tail, and of course he grabs
me by the arm and we go back and forth and I finally
come out of the shed [holding it],” Curcio said.

“I got some good scratches out of it.” - ,,

Curcio, who has a similar exotic lizard at home,;3"='»
said the reptile is a type of monitor lizard, which can;
grow to six or seven feet.

Lani Wigand, education director for the Humane
Society of Broward County, said monitors and other
exotic reptiles often are released by people who buy
them as pets and later choose not to keep them. 17.?” .L.

offersreiuge to wild animals, education to

By Wayne Brown
Southern Aroostook Bureau

NORTH AMITY —-— Multiple. sclerosis, emphysema,
colitis. phlebitis, a broken back, a fused hip; the list goes
* on. So many of life’s raw deals would have caused most
people to give up, but not Arthur E. Howell. He saw them
as reasons to work even harder.

Howell, who founded the Arthur E. Howell Wildlife

Educational Foundation and Refu e more than seven '

years ago. sees his work with chil ren and nature as a
way of paying back God for giving him the opportunity to
live; It was an opportunity because Howell said he had a
choice. ,

At 29, he suffered a broken leg while training to be a I

police officer in Massachusetts. There were complica-
tions’ a short time later from blood clots, and he was

rushed to the hospital where he saidthat at three min- .

utes before midnight, just before he went into a coma
that lasted several days, he saw Jesus Christ and had a
Vision. . . . ' '

“He told me I had to have the operation to live. He told
me i could leave with Him and serve God in heaven or
stay’with my family and friends and serve God here,”
Howell said with tears in his eyes.

i The vision Howell had was of apple orchards, and a
spruce- and pine-lined rural area. “That’s the gospel
truth.” he said.

Ten years later, after a fire at a waste-handling facili-
tv where he was a security guard. and again just before
midnight. he had a very strange feeling and an impulse

to go to Maine. He said his wife thought he was suffering ,

from smoke inhalation. , .

After some discussion, Howell convinced hiswi‘fe and
six Of his seven children to travel north to Maine with
him. After traveling several hours on Interstate 95, How-
ell said, he saw a moose cross the road at B Stream in
Houlton.

“in all my years asa bounty hunter and working with
Sportsmen, I had never seen a moose. I knew this was the
p ace 1 was supposed to be," he said.

The family'spent the next three weekends and more
that $000 returning to Maine in search of the right piece
of property.

“I searched from Lincoln to Presque Isle and from the
; Woodstock border to Patten but couldn‘t find what I
i wanted," Howell said.

, with the help of his wt 9,

. sick or injured animals that w
wild as soon as they are well.

. It wasn’t until the end of their search that a real estate

. agent showed them the property they new own on Ly-
: cette Road in North Amity. As it turned out, the house

was owned by the family of Samantha Smith.

“As soon as I saw the house, I handed the mant real
estate agent.) a check for $1,000 as a deposit," he said. He
said he didn’t even bother to look at the inside of the
house initially, because he was so sure that the house and
property were what he had seen in his vision 10 years

. earlier. As Howell put it, “I walked out to a hill in the

back, leoked tip toward the sky and said ‘Thank you
Lord, I’m home."’
That was almost ei ht ears ago. Since then, Howell,
got, their children and friends,
has built a 70-acre-plus wildlife refuge and rehabilitation
center, which is the only One of its kind in Aroostook
County.
_ The foundation ~ named for Howell‘s father who died
in 1980 —— is a nonprofit organization established for the
purpose of promoting wildlife and conservation projects,

‘ and to provide basic educational programs to the public
. in areas related to wildlife management. ' ’

To this end, Howell has Constructed more than 311-2
miles of nature trails, built a trout pond with plans for

’ two mere, and. lanted a tree farm to support an assort-

ment of wildli e, including bear, moose, innumerable

birds, coyotes and even a bobcat, none of which are in
cages.

There are some animals in cages, but these are usually

1 1 be turned out into the

Some of the animals do not leave. Fluffy, a fox, has
been turned loose at least 20 times but always comes
back. ‘Others like MacHoot, a great horned owl, have
permanent injuries and are unable to fend for
themselves. ‘

The newest member of the “permanent family” is
Bell, a bald eagle who was injured when she flew into
radar tower support cables at the Brunswick Naval Air
Station.

A first for Aroostook County, Bell resides in a custom-
built mew designed by David A. Morrow, a shop instruc-
tor at Ashland High School. It was constructed largely by
students from the school. Howell said the eagle would be
used in an educational raptor program he has developed.

Education is another major goal of Howell and the
foundation. Through his efforts and numerous contribu-

tions from around the state, Howell has assembled per-
haps one of the best wildlife information centers in the
state. ~
Mere than 20 slide programs, dozens of video presenta-
tions, and file drawers full of literature are available to
schools and other non-prof it public organizations. Howell
is also part of the program traveling around the County
to area schools and civic organizations, talking about
Maine wildlife and the environment.

For the last three years, Howell has been attempting to
move a building from Littleton to the refuge in North
Amity to house an educational center. He said the build-
ing would allow him to run education programs on site,
in addition to going out to visit schools.

‘ So far the building has not been moved, though Howell .
said several people had offered to help. He said that
because of the demand for the educational materials, he
will have to start a mailing program because he is un-
able to visit all the schools that invite him.

Howell said that the foundation would be around even ..
when he‘s gone. “I’ll manage the place from the grave,"
he said.

Howell said his will was tight and maintained that,
with the exception of a few acres for his wife and mother,
all the property will remain with the foundation in its
natural state. He said he has his will arranged that way
because of the children.

“People are destroyingwhat they'have," he said. “It’s
important to take care of the land and preserve it for the
children.”

Indeed, children are the main thrust of Howell’s pro-

ram, although adults are certain] part of it too. To
bring children closer to wildlife and t e outdoors, Howell
will be host for the foundation’s annual “Back to Nature
Day” Saturday, Sept. 10. .

The day’s activities will offer demonstrations includ—
ing some by the Maine Forest Service and the Meduxne-
keag Long Rifles. There also will be the annual fishing
contest just for children. Prizes will be awarded to the
child who catches the largest trout each hour. Refresh-

. ments will be available.

Howell said he holds the Back to Nature Day because,
“I want to tell kids how to stop living like a City person in
the country. I want to bring back to Aroostook County
something that it once was being first."

recovered at home from the Sunday,

‘ Says After 2 Pit Bulls Maul Her Badly":

said Sgt. CW. Cowan of the Gwin—
nett Animal Control Center.

' “Pits have about 2,030 pounds of
jaw pressure per square inch com-

pared to about 800 for a German'

shepherd,” Sergeant Cowan said.
They do what, they do with gusto.”

Gwinnett County law requires
all dogs to be restrained or con-
fined and dangerous animals to be
conﬁned on a collar and leash not

longer than 6 feet unless attended
by an owner. Police said Mr. Bor-
druf‘s dogs were not chained be-
cause he wanted them free to be
able to “relieve themselves.”

Mrs. O’Brien, a teacher’s aide at
Peachtree Elementary School, said
doctors at Northside Hospital told
her she must undergo extensive

plastic surgery and possibly vascu-
lar surgery.

' Her husband, Peter J. O’Brien,
said he is “outraged” and he be-
lieves the dogs should be destroyed.

“Whether they’ve ever attacked '
before, they’ve tasted this. They al-
most killed my wife. I don’t think
this state or nation needs animals

like that running around,” said Mr.
O’Brien.

Mrs. O’Brien was walking her
dachshund, Charlie. about 7:30 am.
Sunday when she heard “terrible
barking” coming from the bed of a
': pickup truck parked on her street.

The dogs almost immediately
surrounded her and began to bite
her legs after she picked up her
dachshund. Mrs. O’Brien said. “I
would have protected him at all

costs. He’s a part of the family,”
said the 100-pound, 5-foot-4 woman.

. “I kept. turning to avoid him get-
ting hurt, and then I felt them hit-
ting my legs. I just started scream-

ing. I‘ve never had to scream like

that before.”

DEKALB NEAIG DEKALB NEIGHBOR (Atlanta) — August 3, 1988

By Eden Jackson
Neighbor sum Writer

DeKalb County will soon double
the number of animals it can shelter
with the approval of a new $1.7
million animal control center.

The DeKalb Board of Com-
missioners approved spending $1.7
million to build the new facility.

The commission unanimously ap-

proved the transfer of $289,968 from , ‘

the county’s contingency account at
its Aug. 23 meeting, completing
authorization of total expenditures.

Six bids were received for build-

ing the facility, and the low bid'was~

awarded to Barge Construction Inc.

as general contractor for the ~con-_ .

struction. , _
“The new facility will house twice

as many animals as the present

center,” said DeKalb Chief Er!
ecutive Officer Manuel Maloof. is
design will-provide better facilities
for the 500 animals it can accommo-

date.”

In addition to the new animal
control center, DeKalb’s new
spay/neuter program goes into ef-
fect Sept. 1. The program issues a
certificate with each pet adopted
from animal control center that can
be redeemed at participating veter-
inarians for either spaying or neu-
tering. _

“Every day unwanted puppies and

kittens are born because pet owners
fail to have. their animals spayed or
neuteredg” Maloof said.
_ DeKalb County Animal Contrcil
euthanized 8,379 of the 13,121 dogs
and cats handled by the Animal
Control Center last year.

The program calls for a new
adoption fee schedule; $66'for a

female dog, $61 for a male dog, $56

for a female cat and $36 for a male

. cat.

In other business at Aug. 25
meeting, the board voted unani-

mously to:

I consider a one-year lease with
the US. Department of Agriculture,
Forest Service at Building 2-D and 2-
E at DeKalb Peachtree Airport.

I consider adopting a new resol-
ution accepting a $100,000 Rec-
reation Assistance Fund grant and
authorize appropriation of $70,000
and $30,000 grand-in-aid funds from
the county. The board had acted to
accept the grant funds in June and
July, but due to restrictions had to
be reapproved.

I execute an agreement with
Emory University for $36000 to
train DeKalb County School System
employees in the development of a
program for teenage pregnancy
prevention.

I approve increased funding of
$92,100 for the DeKalb Community
Council on Aging, whose funding

from the county cannot exceed

$327,100.

 




DAILY TELEGRAPH — London, England — Au gust 23, 1988

: Killer disease of
seals spreads to
British waters

By Clare Hargreaves

THE DISEASE which has killed more than 7,000 com-
mon seals in the eastern North Sea and the Baltic has
spread to British waters, scientists said yesterday after
studying results of blood tests on six sick seals from
the King’s Lynn seal sanctuary on the Norfolk coast.

Earlier samples, taken
three weeks ago from 15
common and grey seals in the
Wash and other parts of the
east coast, had proved
inconclusive.

Dr John Harwood, head of the
Natural Environment Research
Council’s sea mammal research
unit at Cambridge, which col-
" lected the samples, said: “The
preliminary results show that
British seals are suffering from
the same disease as the North
Sea seals.

‘ “We suspected this was the
case because of the similarity in
symptoms. Now the results con-
ﬁrm our worst fears.

“The problem appears to be
getting worse in Britain, and if
the disease has the same effect
as elsewhere a large part of the
(British seal population could

1e.” ‘

Britain’s common seal popula-
tion, believed to number at least
25,000, amounts to about half the
European total.

About 7,000 of the Continental
population of 16,000 seals are
believed to have beenkilled by

the disease off the coasts of
Sweden, Norway, Denmark,
West Germany and the
Netherlands.

Fears that the North Sea virus
had reached British waters had
been rising over the past few
weeks as growing numbers of
dead seals were washed up on
the north Norfolk coast.

“We have reports of around 30
seals being washed up on the
north Norfolk coast, although
this is likely to be a very conser-
vative estimate. The number is
going up all the time,” said Dr
Harwood.

Twenty dead seals were
washed up last week at Blakeney
Point, on the north Norfolk coast
where 700 seals live, and another
seven dead were re; orted yester-
day, he said.

The warden at Blakeney,
owned by the National Trust.
said: “We have lost about 30
altogether. They are becoming
infected at the rate of about ﬁve
or six a day and I think it is going
to get much worse.”

There are fears the virus could
spread to the 6,000 seals living in
the Wash, which so far seem to
have been unaffected.

Flanna, Robin and Snapper at Natureland Marine Zoo in Skegness. In the past two months, 19 of the 25 seals
there have died. They were believed to be suffering from the disease that is killing seals in the North Sea

Experts are still divided over
the precise cause of the epi-
demic, and whether it is due to a
virus or pollution or both.

Two suspect viruses have been
found in dead and Sle seals, a

herpes-type implicated in previ-
ous deaths from pneumonia, and
a picorna virus, but exactly what
is causing the deaths is still
unknown.

Dr Harwood said scientists
from the Sea Mammal Research

Unit were setting up a joint pro-
gramme with Dutch virolegists
m look at the link between the
deaths and pollution.

Earlier this month, an emer-

gency meeting of 18 scientists,

organised by Greenpeace and

Queen Mary College, University
of London, called for efforts to be
made to reduce the leakage into
the environment of polychlori-
nated biphenyls (PCBs) which
are known to suppress the
immune system of mammals.

Glowing His Way to an Old Age

BOSTON— Marc Tadler of the Boston & Maine Fish Co. lifts a
35-pound lobster, believed to be about 140 years old, from a tank
Friday at the fish company. The giant crustacean was caught off
New Bedford, Mass, and brought to Boston for display.

DENVER POST

POP: E’I‘ELLO, Idaho -- Conser-
vatiomsts say if Western animals
are to survive and avoid “genetic
isolation,” a wildlife corridor
should be created in the Northern
Rockies.

The crescent-shaped passage—
way, linking Yellowstone National
Park, central Idaho wilderness ar~
eas and Glacier National Park :‘in
Montana, would allow animals to
migrate across interstate high-
ways and would encourage inter-
breeding among otherwise isolated
populations.

Sara Vickerman, Defenders of
Wildlife regional director in Port-
land, said too often animals are
confined to small, piecemeal ar-
eas. That prevents selective breed-
ing and encourages genetic stagna-
tion of some species.

“What happens, particularly
among animals at the top of the
food chain, is as land is developed,
wilderness areas are fragmented
into smaller and smaller segments.
If animals cannot migrate, they
tend to become genetically isolated
and become inbred," she said.

Defenders of Wildlife, which is
attempting to restore the gray wolf
to Yellowstone National Park, sup-

ports a passageway linking areas,
where reintroduction has been en-

dorsed.
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Ser-
vice last year approved a plan to

eas in central Idaho. Political op-
position put that plan on hold.

Wildlife advocates say the com-5

dor would not only benefit wolves,
but also other large carnivores,
herd animals and reptiles that are
threatened by development.

Susan Dejmal, Greater Yellow-
stone Coalition program assistant

at Bozeman, Mont, said she thinks

the corridor is essential for wildlife
preservation.

“It is very necessary to connect
the gene pools between ecosys-
tems,” she said.

The migratory path could be es-
tablished through a variety of
means, including establishing more
official wilderness, adopting strict—
er forest management policies and
making private land purchases
that benefit wildlife.

She added the corridor should
link old growth forests, protect
mountain lakes and streams and

parallel existing migratory routes.

Destruction of habitat already

has caused genetic isolation in oth-;

er parts of the country, mostly no~
tably with the black panther in
southern Florida and the grizzly in
western Washington and Oregon.
Vickerman said highway under-
passes have been built in Florida to
aid wildlife development.

The wildlife corridor concept
has been tossed around for years,
but so far the proposal hasn’t got-
ten much support.

“lf we all go through 2.4 career
changes, so do these little yuppie
' pigs. They used to be eaten, then
kept in zoos, and now they’re mak-
ing marvelous pets.” .

Breeders like to say the tiny
swine let city folks bring a littleubit
of country into a living room, With-
out it becoming a sty. They say pigs
are smarter, cleaner and cheaper to
take care of than dogs —— and some-
times even mimic man’s best friend.
But while no one glances at people
walking their Rottweilers and Dal-
matians, a mini-pig always gets a
double or triple take. .

“The joggers and neighbors
around here thought it was a dog at
ﬁrst,” said Ms. Shapiro’s husband
Marvin, who lost his battle to name
the new pet “Pigmy.”

“I said, ‘Yeah, it’s a dog. It’s a
rooter-hound.’ Some people walk

grgenda Hudlow said her 10-
month-old pig Ninja chases cars
alongside the fence of her Douglas-
ville home, just like her little Lhasa
Apso dog. The two sleep in a dog-
house and eat out of the same dish
of pig chow, which at $6 for a 50-
pound bag, beats dog food. .

“He’s a great conversation
piece,” she said, “and he plays With
my 3-year-old daughter too.

Ms. Shapiro said she had a pet
pig while growing up in the south
Georgia town of Adel. She liked to
watch the TV show “Green Acres
and its star pig Arnold Ziffle, billed

as the smartest pig in Hootemlle.

“I think pigs appeal to .theuhill-
billy in all of us,” she said. And
he’s country, believe me. Look at
his little beer gut.” . .

Being cool — and keeping cool
—— is very important to a pig. Forget

the mud-wallowing stereotypes

Ninja has his own baby pool in the
back yard, and Pigasso gets bathed
regularly — with a toothbrush.

But Ms. Shapiro said she’s care- I

ful to keep toilet lids down around
her house after a breeder told her
four piglets drowned in their water
dish.

“I’m afraid he might try to climb
in there and because his front legs
are so short, he might not get out,”
she said.

But if he is in any discomfort,
her pig lets her know —— with an
ear-splitting squeal. He also grunts,
snorts and smacks his lips after he
pigs out.

Getting one’s very own potbel- ;

lied pet, however, may be as hard
as, well, catching a greased pig. Ms.
Hudlow said she saw a dwarf pig on
a television talk show, but when she

phoned Atlanta area pet stores try-
ing to find one, “they thought I was
a crank caller.” Finally, she got on a
waiting list at the zoo in Columbus,
Ohio, and when a sow farrowed a
litter of 12, she got Ninja for just
under $500. -
Sincegthen she and a partner,
Jean Anderson of College Park,
bought two pigs they breed on a
farm in Tennessee, and they recent- .4
ly sold a litter of five for $1,500 l

 

“It’s too soon to tell if we'll
make a lot of money,” Ms. Hudlow
said. “Maybe if they become [as
popular as] cats and dogs.”

Nancy Cardillo, who owns Lil”
Porkers Pig Pals near Chattanooga,
Tenn, and who bred Pigasso, says
she has received more than 100
calls since advertising in national
and local papers; more than half
the calls were from Georgians.
Some of the callers had seen the
large litter of sus suidae in a corral
at Zoo Atlanta.

Ms. Shapiro said after owning
Pigasso two weeks, she’ll never
again feel the same when encoun~
tering a menu with babyback ribs.

As Fad F ades Exotic Pets Get Cast Aside

By Michelle Hiskey
Staff Writer

Skunks, camels, ostriches, lla-
mas —— Atlanta-area animal control
officials see them all after their
papularity as exotic pets has worn
o .

And they say they wouldn’t be
surprised if Vietnamese potbellied
pigs were next.

“They were cute fuzzy things at
first, then the pet owner ﬁnds out,
geez, I don’t have time for my pig
anymore,” said Nicholas T. Marin-
elli, the director of animal control
for Cobb County.

The Cobb County animal shelter
has already picked up two of the lit
tle pigs in the last two months when
owners could no longer take care of
them, Mr. Marinelli said.

The pigs are “not for every-
body,” he said. “Maybe if you were
raised in Tennessee and slopped
the hogs growing up. But if you get
one to be trendy or yuppie you may
find when the fad wears off, you
have a dwarf farm animal not a
whole lot of people want to take off
your hands.”

pets is $40, Mr. Marinelli said, but
potential owners must meet strin-
gent criteria for adopting exotic
pets.

Bill Garrett, the executive di-
rector of the Atlanta Humane Soci-
ety, said exotic pets “become a
problem when people buy them for
the wrong reason,” adding that
more than 50,000 unwanted dogs
and cats are destroyed each year in
the metro Atlanta area. “They want
them for conversation pieces rather
than companionship,” he said.

Officials in DeKalb, Fulton,
Clayton and Gwinnett counties say
they have not encountered the mini:
pigs, but the DeKalb and Fulton an:
imal control units regulariy get calls
to retrieve ordinary pigs on the
loose in rural areas

“I haven’t heard about the little
ones, but we get about two calls a
week on the big ones,” said Douglas
B. Slappey, field supervisor for De-

Kalb animal control. “Hogs and pigs .

don’t run that fast, and you can cor-
ner them pretty easy.”

Robert Fisher, the director of
animal control for Fulton County,
said pigs of any size are not permit-

many of the county’s municipalities.

A pig expert said if owners tire
of their little porkers, there’s al-
ways the auction or slaughter block.

“People might not want to eat .

Porky the pet,” said Thomas

McDaniel, the associate professor of

herd health management at the
University of Georgia. “But you can
sell even the little ones. They won’t
bring the $125 or $150 that a market
hog will bring now because there
pork chops won’t be too good. But

they’d make pretty good barbecue.”___u

THE DENVER POST - September 4, 1988

Peregrines adapt to Salt Lake City’s canyons

By James Coates
Chicago Tribune

SALT LAKE CITY —- The fog
here may not come in on little cats’
feet, as in Robert Frost’s poem,
but these days the streets along-
side the Mormon Temple are lit-
tered with bird legs.

The bird legs lying on the side-
walks, streets and gutters of this
otherwise spanking-clean city are
the table scraps of a pair of endan-
gered peregrine falcons currently
feeding and raising their young
atop the ornate Hotel Utah build-
mg.

Pedestrians crossing the busy in-
tersection at Main and South Tem-
ple streets, with its center statue of
Brigham Young capped in pigeon
white, often watch the skies for the
swooping falcons.

Scientists delighted

Scientists are delighted because
the sheer number of bird legs being
counted indicates that this city en-
joys one of the most successful ur-
ban falcon projects in the United
States.

(In July, five peregrine falcons
were relocated to One Civic Center
Plaza. Since their placement, sev-
eral have taken to flight through
the canyons of downtown Denver.)

It is not uncommon in Salt Lake '

ff City to see one of the mighty wind—
. hovers swoop and strike a pigeon
. in flight and then soar upward, tal-
' ons grasping the victim in a wild-
‘ life drama of the sort that millions
have seen on TV but, until now,
few have seen in nature.

Peregrines have been clocked at
, nearly 200 miles an hOur while
streaking out of the sun at their
hapless prey. ’l‘hey are highly cov-

Today peregrine falcons promise to be one
of the few success stories in the usually futile
quest to save America’s thousands of
endangered species from extinction.

 

eted by wealthy Arabs who love
the sport of falconry.

‘ In 1984 a federal “sting” code-

named Operation Falcon resulted
in 61 arrests after federal agents
posed as illegal peregrine brokers.
That produced allegations that sev-
eral of the birds had been captured
for members of the royal family of

- Saudi Arabia who reportedly offer-

ed upwards of $100,000 per bird.

Today, however, peregrine fal-
cons promise to be one of the few
success stories in the usually futile
quest to save America’s thousands
of endangered species from extinc-
tion.

By 1970, largely as a result of
poisoning from the now-banned in-
secticide DDT, peregrines east of
the Mississippi had vanished. Only
an estimated 200 survived, scat-
tered about 27 Western states.

The current reintroduction pro-
gram, which includes releasing
many birds in the wild as well as
locating a few falcons in cities, has
produced roughly 2,100 birds and
returned them to 19 states, includ-
ing most of the East and Midwest
where they once had been wiped
out. «

A big reason the birds may sur-
vive, said falcon expert Bill Burn-
ham of Boise, Idaho, is that scien-
tists have happily discovered that
falcons can be brought back to

places where humanity once
forced them to flee.

Such cities as Denver, Chicago,
Los Angeles, Baltimore, Milwau-
kee, Minneapolis and New York,

which now also have falcon popula- '

tions living in their concrete can-
yons, can look to Salt Lake for a
hopeful glimpse at their futures,
said Burnham, president of the
World Center for Birds of Prey, the
moving force behindthe nation-
wide reintroduction program. '

In May a pair of falcons residing
on a 34th floor ledge of the North-
ern Building on Wacker Drive in
Chicago hatched two chicks, the
first peregrine births in Illinois
since 1951.

In the Midwest, say experts, the
peregrines do better in cities than
in the countryside because urban
life protects them from the great
horned owl, which finds peregrine
chicks toothsome morsels.

In Utah, which has 50 breeding
pairs of peregrines in the wild, a
nesting pair flew into Salt Lake on

their own in 1986 and took up resi—.

dence on a ninth-story ledge of the
famous llotel Utah. Since then sev-
en of the rare chicks have hatched
just above the clatter of traffic on
West Temple Street.

Nurtured by their parents, who

range widely about the city and the
surrounding countryside for birds

to take home for dinner, the seven
chicks have learned to fly the old-
fashioned way -- by leaping off the
roof and seeing what happens next.

Snarled traffic

As a result, traffic frequently is
snarled on the busy thoroughfare
while frantic scientists in orange
vests plunge into the roadway to
keep one of their feathered trea-
sures from being run over after it
hits the ground too hard and is
stunned. - .

Officials here‘say that despite an
occasional traffic jam and a few
grumblings at the “guts and gore”
left behind by the survival-of-the—
fittest drama being played on the
city’s streets, the Salt Lake pere-
grines are very popular.

“People find the peregrines liv-
ing among us a real treat,” said
Bob Walters, of the Utah division
of wildlife, who coordinates scien-
tific studies of the birds.

Walters said he tries to clean up
the mess - “prey leftovers,” as he

. calls it - but admitted that he does

so more for scientific than sanitary
reasons. .

“Seeing the legs in the street is,
after all, part of the natural experi-
ence, too,” he noted. , '

What intrigues Waltersis that
the legs come not just from pi-
geons but from as many as 30 dif-
ferent species of birds, indicating
that the falcons are‘thriving in the
city and roving far from downtown
Salt Lake. He has also found parts
of teal and ruddy ducks, black— ,
headed grosbeaks, three species of 2
black birds, grebes, mourning '
doves, oriels, robins and seagulls._

“It’s a real smorgasbord,” he ;
said.

Charlton Heston Happy to Pay 406
After Beloved Pooch Bites Jogger

 

 

Charlton Heston has reached a $40,000 out-of-
court settlement with a jogger who claimed he was

bitten by the star’s dog.
Tennis pro Alan Boltin
had filed suit charging that

 

Heston’s dog Wota‘n jumped,
attacked and bit him as he
ran near the actor’s Beverly
Hills home.

But despite all the trouble
over Wotan, Heston —- who
has three other dogs -- is
still keeping his mixed-breed
; ‘ boxer. “We’re a dog family,”
Heston declared in a deposi-
tion that would have been
used for the trial had he not
settled out of court. “All the
dogs (in my house) were ac-
quired through animal shel-
ters.

“This dog, Wotan, weighs
maybe 35 pounds. At the
time of the Boltin incident

caused any injury to anyone
at any time.
“It’s my belief that dogs

know who’s the head man. if" V

I’m tall and . . . dogs, even
strange dogs, obey me.”

But according to Alan Bol-
tin, Heston was nowhere to
be seen when Wotan and his
canine companion ran after
him along a road in Franklin
Canyon, near Heston’s home.
“The dog was trying to bite
me,” Boltin said in his depo-
sition. “It was gnawing at my
calf, trying to jump up and
bite my right’calf.

“The dog was barking and
growling. I got knocked
down by the dog, and as I fell
to the ground the dog contin-
ued trying to bite me.

“After a period of time,
the dog ran away.”

Boltin’s Beverly Hills at-
torney, Laurence Ring, also
said Wotan had previously
bitten a young secretary who
was on an outing in a park.

A month before the case
was due in court, Heston’s at-
torney settled with Boltin.

“I’d rather pay and get
this thing over with,” Heston
told a pal. “I don’t want to be
pictured as a careless guy

to settle.”

a-half stories. A third only required observation and one,
who fell 52 stories, was released after (18 hours.

Veterinary surgeons Wayne Whitney and Cheryl Mehlhaff
attribute this remarkable survival rate to cats’ instinct to right
themselves into a feet first position, which also happens to

. be effective in slowing their rate of descent. Falling in the

legs spread out in the manner of ﬂying squirrels, the average
cat achieves its maximum rate of descent in about 60 vertical
feet. ——Am’mals .

MAINE SUNDAY TELEGRAIVI - Portland - Sept. 4, 1988

kitty, tOy boycott

Assocmt‘eud Press
Salesman Mike Haskins holds a "krushed kitty” being sold by
his store in Columbus, Ohio.

 

The Associated Press

 

COLUMBUS, Ohio —- Two
humane societies are urging con-
sumers to boycott a new stuffed toy
called Krushed Kitty. '

The yellow-and-black striped
toy -— a cat’s bottom with hind legs

and tail —-— is designed to be stuck '

out of car doors, hoods and trunks.
A card attached states that "a por-
tion of the profits are donated to the
Humane Society.” .

However, Phyllis Wright, a vice
president with the Washington
D.C.-based Humane Society of The
United States, denied any connec-
tion to the item and said she doubts
"any legitimate humane society
would take one penny from this.”

She and Gerri Bain of the Capital
Area Humane Society in Columbus
called on consumers not to buy the
stuffed toy, which retails for
$17.99.

"I think the onus is on the
consumer,” Ms. Wright said.
"Unless the public responds in a
negative way and goes to a store
and threatens never to buy any-
thing else there because of this

item, nothing will get done.”

The attached card does not state
how much will be donated, nor
whether the money will go to the
national Humane Society or to local
humane societies, which are pri-
vately operated and not affiliated
with the national organization.

The Krushed Kritter Kompany
of Kalifornia, which lists its address
as Tarzana, Calif., could not be
reached to comment Friday. No
telephone listing was available.

The toy’s packaging said the cat
parts are registered in at least five
states — Ohio, Maine, Pennsylva-
nia, Florida and Texas.

The packaging urges the pur-

lchaser to "Krush your kitty in your

car, work or home!” and to write to
the company to "tell us your
favorite place to krush your kitty.
And vote for who or what you would
like to see KRUSHED next."

"This will do for kittens what '
'Jaws’ did for sharks,” Bain said.
"This is not only disgusting and
irreverent, but it is misleading.”

“I think the best way to stop this
disgusting product is fer consum-
ers to just not buy them. Let them
(the manufacturer) eat their
Krushed Kitties,” she said. .

 




 

MEMPHIS COMIWERCIAL APPEAL - Sept. 10, 1988

Dogged cat

eases down

0 safety,
W home

By John Beifuss
Staff Reporter

 

 

The kitten that made a mon-
key out of would-be rescuers for
five days was rescued Friday
afternoon from its perch on the
Hernando DeSoto Bridge —— and
it found a new home at the same
time.

“We’re going to keep him,”
said Alan Barnhart, 27, of Barn-
hart Crane 8: Rigging Co., one of
the cat’s rescuers. “My wife in-
sisted on it.”

Barnhart supplied a hydraulic
crane that lifted Eddie Hoskins,
a worker with another construc-
tion company, to the superstruc-
ture of the bridge. Hoskins
climbed to a height of about 80
feet and grabbed the shy and
hungry kitten from a pillar.

The cat had eluded a cage bait-
ed with sardines and other at-
tempts at capture since it was
spotted mewing on the bridge
gridwork Monday afternoon. In
fact, Thursday night it apparent-
ly ate the sardines without trip-
ping the trap and then “it was
back to its old trick of letting out
all those loud screaming me-
ows,” said Bill Calhoun, a Mud Is-
land worker who first spotted
the frightened feline.

Barnhart, who first tried to
reach the. cat with a crane Tues-
day, said he was determined to
catch the kitty. “Today (Friday)

we said, ‘We’re gonna do it.’ ”
He said the rescued cat “is just
a little bitty thing. Her feet are
really torn up from walking on
that concrete and steel — she
doesn’t have much claw left.”

But, he said, he and his wife
Kathy will nurse it back to
health. And, yes, they’ve already
given it a name:

Pet Power

 

 

 

 

 

 

We were inundated by letters from proud
pet owners in response to our pet poll in
the ]uly issue (“Pet Two Poodles and
Call Me in the Morning”). Here are some
highlights.

Each morning on her way to work, our
daughter brought her dog to stay with
us as she didn’t want to leave Fiﬁ alone
all day. FiFi was a welcome addition to
our lives and we looked forward to her
daily visits.

One day I had a tremendous shock. I
was diagnosed as having cancer. Treat-
ment would require three months of
chemotherapy, then surgery.

The evening before the surgery our
daughter said with tears in her eyes, “I
am not taking FiFi home tonight. She is
to stay with you the rest of her life.”

During my year of followup chemo-
therapy FiFi was constantly by my side.
On my sickest days she was there look—
ing at me with love. Being able to put
my hand on the soft fur and feel her
breathing gave me strength and cour-
age. Knowing she was near me made
the nights less frightening. She was my
husband’s special companion during my
three hospital stays.

Several years later Fiﬁ became deaf,
her sight gradually failed, and her arthri-
tis worsened. It was my turn to care for
her. I carried her upstairs, fed her spe-
cial food, and petted her—'—a lOt.

One morning she looked at us with
that loving look as if to say “Thank you.
I’m going away for a while. Take good
care of each other.”

I do not live alone. We are quite a
gang—two dogs, an old cat, a stray kit-
ten who wandered out of the woods and
into my pocketbook, ﬁve ducklings on
my pond, a hive of bees among my ﬂow-
ers, a buck who naps under my apple ‘
tree, a transient coyote, a resident red
fox, and countless wild birds. They pro—
vide companionship, entertainment, hu-
mor, solace, and a reason to get out into
the world to “earn the dog food”.
CONSTANCE KIPPAX
New Gloucester, Maine

I am 59 years old, live alone, and work in
a one-girl ofﬁce where I am alone 99
percent of the time. About 5 years ago I
got a dog to keep me company. I ended
up with a Lhasa Apso named “Princess
Di” (it was the time of the “big” wed-
ding.)

I immediately started bringing her to
the ofﬁce. Well, since the ﬁrst day she
and the ofﬁce mailman have had a love
affair you could not believe! He comes
in every morning, gets down on one
knee, and gives her a complete mas-
sage.

The boss I had when I got her as a
puppy was something else. I would go
into his ofﬁce and she would be in his
one arm, chewing on the chair, while he
was writing with his other hand.

GEORGIANN KERNS
Bettendorf, Iowa

I have two cats: a Siamese I call N efer-
titi (and let me say she lives up to her
name) and an orange tiger-striped tom I
call Garﬁeld. I also have Mikey, an Aus—
tralian Cattle Dog and his granddaugh-
ter, Snow’s Amazing Grace, H.I., who I
show.

There are times when I get blue, but
then I look into those loving pairs of
blue, brown and yellow eyes and I think:
Hey, I can’t get sick. I’ve got my gang to
care for. I forget about my aches and
pains and get busy. The “experts” call it
therapy, but I call it love.

JUNE ZUBER
Lakebay, Wash.

I am only 58 and I keep pets for compa—
ny since I live alone, but I want to tell
you a story of a 79-year young lady I
work for. I do the heavy work, the shop-
ping, the driving.

She was alone—had been for quite a
long time. She is mentally well, but her
health is failing and it keeps her con-
fined most of the time. I had the idea

maybe a kitten might help her. Well it
has. She has had the kitten for about 8
months now. No longer do I hear the
complaining and feeling of hopeless-
ness. Each day she has another new tale
of her cat. Her spirits are up most of the
time and when her life seems to be get-
ting a bit too much she does some small
thing for her kitten and feels better. It
truly has meant fewer visits to the doc-
tor. BETTY ROE
Crystal River, Fla.

I don’t know if I could ever live without
a pet. I have had one ever since I can re-
member. Over the years I have had a
collie, a fox terrier, a springer spaniel,
two cocker spaniels, a dachshund mix
and, now, two more cocker spaniels.
There have been times when I felt lone-
ly or was grieving, that I could only ﬁnd
love and comfort through my pets. The
problem is ﬁnding a place to live with
two pets. I am moving into senior hous-
ing where tenants aren’t allowed to
have pets. I think that is a big mistake
because seniors, especially single ones,
DO need them. . LUCY TIMM
Northglenn, Colo.

It means so much to us to have some-
thing to care for, to hug, to be needed
by. Won’t you please advise your read-
ers of HUD’s regulations concerning
pets in senior housing developments?
JANET E. GLAVE
Port Townsend, Wash.

We received several letters from people
who are misinformed or uncertain about
tenant’s rights to have pets.

Since 1986, owners and managers of
federa lly-assisted rental housing for the
elderly or handicapped are required to in-
form all present and prospective tenants
of their right to keep “common ” house-
hold pets. You do not, by law, have to re-
linquish your pets in order to move in.
Housing covered under this law includes
all rental housing designed for elderly or
handicapped persons and “assisted ”by
the Department of Housing and Urban

Development (HUD). “Assistance ” refers

not only to rent assistance, but also to fa-
cilities owned by HUD or with a HUD-in-
sured mortgage. '

While considered an endangered

whales are commonly seen off the
coast of Northern California at this
time of year, feeding while migrating ,
south. According to a 1982 Federal
publication, the largest ever meas
ured was 961/2 feet long and it weighed
about 160 tons. That suggests that the

Samuel Harvey doesn’t care
much for felines, so when an
itinerant ——— and pregnant —— cat
chose his house in Oak Cliff to
deposit ﬁve kittens, he was not

delighted.

' He waited until the kittens
were weaned, put them in a card-
board box and carried them to
the Dallas Animal Shelter in Oak
Cliff. There, atop a tall desk just
inside the front door, they began
an exploration of the world
around them.

They sniffed about and peered
tentatively over the edge at the
floor. One crawled into a desk
drawer and studied the surround-
ings.

“Typical kittens,” Lt. Ray Por-
. ter said with a grin as he tied
tags around each little neck.
“Don’t do nothin’ in the drawer,
fella ”

Within 48 hours all five of the
kittens would be dead.

Euthanasia is something no
one at the animal shelter gets

ly it is handled -— and here it is

DALLAS TIMES HERALD - September 5,1988

Stray animal problem growing at Dallas shelter

be painless —— destroying animals
goes against the nature of the

employees who daily deal with a .
_ disposable society’s disposable

pets.

Tom Hickey, manager of anit
mal control for the city of Dallas,
says simply, “It’s very difﬁcult,
and it’s very sad.”

The problem of unwanted ani-
mals appears to be growing. Sta-
tistics are inconclusive because
the number of impounded ani-
mals has declined, in the last cou-.

ple of years, but Hickey says ,

that’s probably because city bud-
get cuts cost him several ofﬁcers.

His guess is, though, that the
numbers of cast—off dogs, wild
cats and other unwanted animals
is increasing with the population
of the city. Which means that, in
the foreseeable future, there will
be mounting activity in what is
referred to as the shelter’s PTS
(for Put-To-Sleep) Room.

Last year, Hickey says, about

.135,000 animals were impounded.

Of those, only 2,800 “went out
the front door” to their owners.
“The rest went out the back
door,” he says.

Hickey’s 52—member staff op-
erates around the clock out of

.-____“\

two shelters, one near the Dallas
Zoo and one on Forney Road in
southeast Dallas. At any one
time, a maximum of four ofﬁcers
are in the ﬁeld, and though they
give priority to calls involving
bites and injured or sick animals,
they still manage to round up
and bring in dozens of stray dogs
and cats every day.

And every day most of them
go out the back door.

Dogs are held for three days,
Hickey says, and then are either
killed, or, if they pass staff veter-
inarian Janet Morris’ physical,
given necessary shots, sterilized
and put up for adoption. Cats are
held for only one day.

On a typical day, the shelter
will ﬁeld about 500 calls from
residents complaining about ev—
erything from dogs ravaging
their garbage cans to raccoons in
their gardens.

DEAR ZAZZ: I live in an, apart-
ment, work a day shift; and feel
guilty leaving my wonderful dog,
Benji, alone by himself. .

Benji and I go for walks and

exercise together when I come home '

from work. But what can Ben'i do
during the 10 hours I’m out o the
house? He’s so glad to see me when
I get home that I fear he’s been

going stir crazy all alone.

Do you have any recommended

activities for a dog left alone all
'day?

There are also dog commercials:
A mouthwash ad focuses on dreaded

uling Support ‘
Chesapeake Bay
Wildlife Protection

By Paul W. Valentine

Washington Post Staff Writer

 

In a ruling that could put new limits on builders seek-
:ng Chesapeake Bay development under Maryland’s
controversial critical areas law, a state judge has upheld
the way local authorities barred construction on a 40-

acre Eastern ShOre property occupied by endangered

wildlife. .

Judge Marvin H. Smith rejected claims by a Talbot
County developer that he was forced to withdraw his
development plans on the 40 acres to meet a deadline
for complying with the critical areas law. Smith ruled
that the developer voluntarily had agreed not to build
on the 40 acres to gain approval for the rest of the de-
veloper’s ZOO-acre proposal, and that county officials
were correct in barring Construction on the 40 acres.

“This is the first court ruling on a direct challenge to
the critical areas protection law,” said Maryland Attor-
ney General J. Joseph Curran Jr.

“By upholding the law, which is the cornerstone of
our intensified efforts to protect the environment, the
court has sent a clear signal to developers and local
governments throughout Maryland and given them a
guide on how they can proceed with development
plans.” A '

The seven-page ruling, which cited the bald eagle
and Delmarva fox squirrel as endangered species living
in the forest habitat, was issued Thursday.

The developer, Clifford E. Meredith, could not be
reached for comment. State officials said numerous build-
ers and local planning'agencies had been waiting for the
ruling as a guide for future development procedures.

The critical areas law, pushed by environmentalists
and fought by developers, is designed to help clean the
Chesapeake Bay’s waters and preserve animal habitats
by limiting development to no more than one house per i‘
20 acres within 1,000 feet of the bay. 1

The law also requires developers to submit plans to

protect wildlife that could be adversely affected by
housing construction.

Computer games
steal appeal of insects

BY ERIC TALMADGE

Associated Press
' TOKYO

Kids are changing in Japan, appearing to
lose interest in some of the world’s most
timeless creatures: bugs. Purveyors of insects
say modern entertainments such as computer
games have slowed their sales to a crawl.

“This has been a terrible year for sales,”
said Mitsuo Otsuka, manager of the Insect
Corner at Tokyo’s Takashimaya department
store. ’

Mr. Otsuka said the store used to sell $380 to
$480 (U.S.) worth of insects on a good Sunday.

“Now we’re lucky if we can sell half that
much.”

In rural Japan, the sight of a child with net
out to nab a cicada or dragonfly is common.
But in the city, Mr. Otsuka and other bug
salesmen say hopping insects are no match for
modern diversions.

“It’s computer games. Kids are more inter-
ested in machines these days,” Mr. Otsuka
said.

Even so, he added, Takashimaya expects to
sell about $6,000 worth ofbugs this year.

The bug-hunting season in Japan hits its
peak in early July and lasts through August.
Rural children collect the bugs near their

A clerk at the Tokyo

7 ’I . department store’s pet shop

said she had sold a 71/ﬁ-cm male

stag beetle for $770 early this month.
“But only insect-crazy adults buy those
bugs, not kids.”

A medium—range item, she said, was a pair
.of smaller stag beetles. The beetles, which
came with a plastic cage, dirt and a few slices
of rotting eggplant, were priced at $77.

“It’s a real buy, ” she said. “Until yesterday,
the price was 15,000 yen ($115)."

Mr. Otsuka said Takashimaya doesn’t sell
pricey insects anymore, and relies on the
smaller stag beetles, the Homoeogryllus japa-
nicus or bell-ringing insect, and the coleop-
teran or Atlas beetle. Most of his insects were
selling for $1.54 to $4.60.

“The male Atlas beetle is the most popular
with the kids because its ‘horns’ are shaped
like a samurai helmet,” he said.

“When I was a child growing up in Tokyo
they didn’t sell bugs in department stores,"
said Mr. Otsuka, who has been in charge of
Takashimaya’s bugs for the past 10 years.
“But children now have less chance to see
insects in their natural environment. It’s very
sad to think that they have lost interest. “

Heartwarmmg Stories of Pets RIskIng Death to Save Beloved Owners

Inspiring true stories of animals’ courage, devotion
and sacrifice pack the pages of the new book "Real

Animal Heroes,”

edited by Paul Drew Stevens. In the

following ENQUIRER installment from the book,
Stevens tells how a small poodle saved eight lives -—

and how a cat fought off

a vicious intruder.

Tabb y Turns Tiger
And Protects Sick

Old lady From "my 4 7' “f:

By PAUL DREW STEVENS

Shade McCorkle, a short-legged cat, had been
taken in by frail 88-year-old Nell Mitchell and the :2
two had developed a close attachment. On a day in ~

late December 1932, the

Memphis, Tenn., woman

 

 

 

was lying ill and groggy from medication on a day- 6
bed in her kitchen, with Shade curled up at her feet,

when suddenly there was
a knock on the door.

Unable to rouse herself,
Nell hoped that whoever it
was would go away. Instead,
she heard the porch door be-
ing pulled open and someone
walking toward the kitchen.

At her feet, partially cov-
ered in the afghan over the
bed, Shade lazily rolled over.
Nell was startled when the
kitchen door swung open.

The intruder was a thin,
grubby-looking man in his
early 205. His eyes darted
around the room. He asked
her for something to eat.

“Go next door,” Nell
winced. “I’m too ill.”

Instead, the stranger
pulled up a chair. He settled
into it and said, “When will
your old man be back?”

Suddenly, the intruder
was out of the chair and
standing over her.

“Your ring!” he shouted.
The frightened woman pull-
ed the ring from her finger.
She hoped the man would
just rob her and go away. He
didn’t. In a fit of unprovoked
anger, he pulled back his
open hand and slammed it
against her cheek.

The intruder never got an-
other chance at Nell. Shade’s
14 pounds of feline claws,
teeth and muscle sprang
from beneath the afghan in a
hurtling fury.

Shade bounded onto the
man's shoulders. In a flash
the cat circled to his throat
and, with a fearsome yowl,
clamped down hard with his
fangs. His claws flailed at
the stranger’s neck.

The man hollered out in
pain and whirled around the
room, punching at Shade in
an effort to dislodge him, but
Shade hung on.

The man stumbled into a

Neil’s carpet from the fang
and claw wounds. The man’s
hands found Shade’s neck 3
and he tried to throttle the

life out of the fearless feline.

“Call him off!” the man 3

screamed at Nell.

Shade, however, was far i '

from finished. He squirmed

out of the man’s suffocating

grip and again lashed out at
the intruder’s face. The man
backhanded him, but Shade
set upon him with renewed
vigor, clawing until the now-
terrified attacker screamed
in agony and backed toward
Nell’s front door.

As he retreated, the man
got another choke hold on
Shade and slammed the
tabby against a table. He’d
had enough, however, and
he dashed out the door be-
fore Shade could launch
a new attack. Although
bruised, Shade suffered no
lasting effects from his bat—
tle with the intruder. For
protecting his mistress that
day, the cat was awarded the
Latham Foundation’s Gold
Medal for animal heroism.

Corkle’s daring attack on an intruder

show in his Danbury, Conn,
home. As fire swept through
the two-story house that
morning of Jan. 30, 1972, he,
his wife and six children
slept unaware.

Mimi instantly leaped
onto Nicholas’ chest and,
yapping sharply, scratched
at his shirt. ,

Nicholas reeled to his feet.
The whole house was ablaze.
His mind raced. His wife and
5-year-old son Peter slept
downstairs, but his five
older children were in bed-
rooms on the second story.

Nicholas ran toward the
downstairs bedrooms, shout-
ing hoarsely as he went.
Mimi raced toward the stair-
case and scrambled up its
hot steps. Fire licked up the
stairwell after the little dog.

Mimi rushed into the girls’
bedroom and tugged at 11-
year-old Lisa’s bedcovers.
Darting across to 9-year-old
Patty, Mimi yapped and
dragged her claws over Pat-
ty’s back. Both girls tumbled
bewildered from bed. Mimi
turned and skidded down

 

the burning stairs to Nicho-
las, who had managed to
rouse his wife and Peter.
As Mrs. Emerita left the
house with Peter, Nicholas
hurried back through the
smoke-filled living room
with Mimi. Lisa and Patty
were crouched halfway down
the blazing stairs, faces
blanched with fear. Mimi
ran to them and pulled at
their nightclothes, urging
them down the steps.
Flames whooshed Up the
stairwell, making descent
for the other three children
upstairs impossible. But
Mimi again raced up the
flaming stairs and awoke
Debbie, 15, and Anthony, 13.
By now the father, Nicho-
las, had climbed a ladder
outside Anthony’s bedroom.
Mimi raced to wake Edward,
16. Then she began to herd
the three children toward
Nicholas.
Lifting the window, Deb

bie stepped onto the ladder 8'

and descended hastily be-

ignited the ladder.

his arms and crawled out
onto the shingles.

But Mimi broke free of
Edward’s grasp, and refused
to leave the roof until Ed-
ward and Anthony had leap-
ed into their father’s arms.

The entire Emerita family
was safe now. Satisfied,
Mimi sailed off the roof into
Nicholas’ arms.

For saving eight lives,
Mimi was presented with the .

By Bill Kurtzebom

ISNEY turned up one

morning at Bob and

Sandy’s house. He
was short with white fur, flop~
py black ears and a tail that
was longer than it should have
been. He wore a grin from ear
to ear, despite the fact that
you could count his ribs. His
hip bones stood out like
doorknobs.

I had gone to our son and
daughter-in-law’s to use their
phone. We had been in our
new house in the woods for
two weeks, but the phone
company that serves Warren
County hadn’t yet seen ﬁt to
reconnect us to the rest of the
world. (Life in the country is
less hurried, particularly if it

involves getting some kind of

service.)

When I ﬁnished pleading
my case there was this emaci-
ated puppy outside the door,
looking up and wagging.

“Poor little fellow,” Sandy
said. “somebody dropped him
off this morning at the school
bus stop. They dropped off his
mother, too.”

His mother, a white collie-
shepherd-setter-something
mix, had been around when I
came to the house. Now she
was gone. We haven’t seen her
since.

But there stood her tragi-
comic offspring, looking up
with big, brown eyes and wag-
ging, hopefully. Obviously he
knew a soft touch when he
saw one.

“What kind of a person
would just drop off a pup like
this?” I asked.

Sandy shrugged. A lot of
animals are abandoned in the
country by people who are too
poor, indifferent or ignorant
to take unwanted pets to an
animal shelter.

Peg and I already had two
cocker spaniels, easygoing
Kelly, blond, 11 years old and
a friend to the world, and
Misty, a 5-year-old black and

white parti-color, who was
hyper and paranoid. The idea
of becoming a three-dog fam-
ily was out of the question.

“I’ll take him home and
we’ll fatten the little guy up,”
I told Sandy. “Then when
he’s more presentable we’ll
take him to the Humane
Society.”

She just smiled

I walked back to our house,
the pup close on my heels.

“Look, honey,” I said. “He
followed me home. Can I keep

 

him?”

I was joking, I thought.

“Oh, isn’t he cute!” she
said “But he’s so skinny.”

Since both our cockers were
inside dogs, we set the new-
comer up on the breezeway on
an old mud rug that he
thought was just ﬁne. The
question of a name was no
problem since he was so clum-
sy. Peg quickly began calling
him “Dizzy.” But that eve-
ning as we walked along our
gravel road, the dog capering

ahead of us and stumbling fre-
quently, she laughed. —

“He looks like a cartoon
dog. We should call him
Disney.”

And so we did.

When the little fellow got
into mischief, which was of-
ten, Peg would reprimand him
sharply:

“Disney, no!”

If he persisted, she would
snap:

“Walter, no!”

One evening as the three of
us were walking, Diz fell be-
hind. Peg turned.

“Disney, no!”

Nothing happened.

“Walter, stop rolling on
that!”

An awful thought struck

me.
“Peg,” I said, “we’re new
around here. Do you realize
our neighbors might think I’m
Walter?”

Since then we’ve just called
him Disney or Diz.

A few days after we had un-
dertaken to fatten the pup,
our granddaughter Christine,
9, came by the house.

“Are you going to keep
him?” she asked.

“Unless I can find some
nice people who want him,” I
told her.

This was about the time
that the plumber came out to
ﬁnish hooking up the bath in
the basement. He seemed like
a nice fellow.

“Would you like a neat pup-

, py?” I asked him.

“Heck no,” he said.

The next day Dave, our 13-
year-old grandson, dropped by
to see Diz.

“Are you going to keep him,
Grandpa?” he asked.

“It sure looks like it.”

That was about a month
ago. Since then Diz has lost
his milk teeth, thanks in no
small part to my slipper,
which he sneaked away and
chewed into an unrecogniz-
able blob.

 

His ribs no longer show,
and he’s about a foot higher at
the shoulder. From the looks
of his paws he still has a lot of
growing to do. And he’s every
bit as clumsy as when we ﬁrst
saw him. The other night I
was trying to teach him to
shake hands. I picked up his
right forepaw, and he fell on
his side.

He follows us everywhere
and with extra relish when
we’re walln'ng to the commu-
nity lake to swim or ﬁsh. He’s
a natural swimmer and de--
lights in wrestling — in the
water or out —— with Bob and
Sandy’s dog Brandy. «

But his real passion is ﬁsh—
ing. He watches a caster in-
tently, though he does make
things a bit tough for us by
plowing into the shallows fre-
quently to chase the lure as
you reel it in.

Disney’s biggest problem is
his tendency to bark at the
beasties that move through
the woods at odd hours of the
night. Sometimes I have to
get up, put on my remaining
slipper and go out onto the
breezeway to assure him that
all’s well. -

His position was guaran-
teed, however, when I took
him to the Warrenton rabies
clinic for his ﬁrst shot. The
dogs whose masters had cho-
sen them — instead of the
other way around -— were
raising a ruckus. Most yelped
or whimpered when they got
the needle. Diz marched up to
the veterinarian with a grin,
took his shot and licked the
vet’s hand.

I have just one thing to say I
to the people who dumped
him off:

You’ve missed a lot of

tired recently as a copy

He acknowledged that “there’s
room for better communications
and tighter regulations.” He de-
scribed those operating the horse-
drawn carriages as “ambassadors to
the city. We welcome thousands of
conventioneers to the city and ex-
plain the city to them on historical
tours.” '

Donna Browning, president of '
the Atlanta Equestrian Society, be-

lieves that “because the market has
fallen out on horses, they can buy;

them cheap, they can drive them
into the ground and replace them
cheap. It’s a bad situation.”

Ms. Browning, who said she was
speaking as an individual and not
as head of the Equestrian Society,
recalled hearing of horses being fed

stale bread. “That wouldn’t be so

bad, but they didn’t take it out of
the plastic bags. Plastic has stuck in
the intestines and killed some
horses.”
, “My young Girl Scouts know
more about taking care of horses
than some of these people,” de-
clared Shari Burkett, one of several
citizens who have taken an active
role in trying to improve conditions

for the horses.

“If one of these horses drops i
dead on the street,” she said, “the ‘
carriage is going to flip over and it’s
going to hurt somebody.”

Deborah Carton, a member of
Fund for Animals, said the horses
“deserve better for the kind of work
they’re doing. I’ve had more horror
stories told to me, about horses be-
ing hosed off in bitter cold weather
and real thin horses working on
streets. I witnessed some nasty, nas—
ty, foul living conditions. They are
health hazards.” »

Joe Hall, who has jurisdiction;
over the horse-draWn carriages asl
head of the city's Bureau of Taxi-l
cabs and Vehicles for Hire, saidiI
“everybody recognizes we’ve got;
problems and that we need to cor-:
rect them.”

“I want to develop a program of :
instruction for drivers,” he said.
“But the bottom line is the health of
the animal.”

State Veterinarian John A Cobb
said there “have been some deﬁ-
ciencies in the stables and the care
of the horses, but. they seem to be
making some progress to get it cor- .
rected. I told the people over there

that we don’t expect them to put the _

horses in luxury stables, but just ad-
equate stables so they have decent
protection from the elements.”

astor Has a Bow Sight to Behold

 

By Kent Mitchell
Staff \l’riter

Jack Davidson. pastor at a non-denomina-
tional church in Romeo, Mich, had a vision a
few years ago.

It had nothing to do with his calling.
though. The vision has become one of the
most revolutionary new bow sights in the
country. Elegant in its simplicity, Insta-Sight
is the better mousetrap . . . or deertrap.

Archers for centuries have tried to unrav-
el the Gordian Knot of bow sights. Devices,
some complicated to Rube Goldbergian pro-
portions, have come and gone.

Until Davidson’s invention, there were
two general types of sights available, the pin
type and the type used from tree stands. Both
worked but had their limitations.

.The pin type —— usually three pins set for
specific distances -— was hampered because
an archer had to know the exact distance of
his target. and it couldn’t be used accurately
in a tree stand. .

The sight used in tree stands allowed a
hunter to shoot downward with accuracy but

couldn‘t. be used on the ground.

Davidson’s invention, lnsta-Sight, was an-
other example of simplicity at work.

The sight is shaped like a V with a curved
bottom. To sight, simply put the V on the
deer’s chest area and raise or lower the bow
until the sides of the V are “touching" that 13-
inch vital area of the chest.

Once the sight is calibrated, it works with
uncanny accuracy on the ground or from a
tree stand from 45 yards or less. _

Archers have put five arrows in groups as
small as three inches the first time they tried
it. '

At the time of his vision. Davidson was a
dry wall contractor. He was also an avid bow
hunter, and like most archers, he wasn't hap-
py with his hunting sight.

He was looking for ways to improve it, and
the idea came to him while he was at work.

“I stopped and wrote down the plans on a
piece ofdry wall," he said.

uted by Big 10 Guns and Deerclilf .»\l‘t"i‘iri_‘lj»’.

Society Says
Carriage Firms Deny
Abuse; Meeting Set

By Sam Hopkins
Staff Writer

n Atlanta Humane Society official says

horses would be better used pulling

carriages through Oakland Cemetery

than carrying sightseers in downtown
traffic, and a meeting has been set between
city officials and citizens complaining the
horses are maltreated.

“The society,” said Bill Garrett, executive
director of the Atlanta Humane Society
(AHS), “has some serious problems with
horses intermingling with motorized traffic.”

He cited two cases, one in which a horse
was killed by a bus a few months ago, and an-
other involving a horse that panicked when a
‘car backfired and leaped with its carriage
through a plate glass window.

“Our animal control division has had a
number of complaints of horses being over-
loaded with too many people in the carriages,
of whipping the horses, of harness sores, of
being underweight and improperly shod and
of using them during extremely hot days,” Mr.
Garrett said.

“There’s nothing to see downtown,” he
said. “You’ve got hotels and buildings, and
that’s it; It would certainly be more interest-
ing driving through Oakland Cemetery — but
it may be a little spooky, eSpcclaiiy 'dt msm.”

Some prominent figures, including author
Margaret Mitchell and golfer Bobby Jones, as

well as many Confederate soldiers, are buried ,

in Oakland Cemetery.

City Councilwoman Barbara Asher, chair-
man of the council’s Public Safety Committee,
said a City Hall meeting of city officials and
interested citizens will be held at 11 am.
Thursday to discuss the problems of safety
and physical conditions m“ frames

“1 know we have a problem,” she said,
“but I’m trying to find out if we have the

proper inspection mechanism in place.” .

The owners of two carriage companies,
who have been the principal targets of criti-
cism from some quarters, denied Monday that
they have mistreated their horses.

“There are no horses being neglected or
mistreated,” insisted Walter Gates, owner of
the Atlanta Carriage Co.

“We may not have the most complete and

proper facilities that a horse maybe should
have,” he said, “but I can assure you they are
not being neglected or mistreated. They ain’t
got the best place to live, I’ll admit that, but
so have a lot of human beings, and they're liv-
ing well.”

Robert Howze, owner of the Metropolitan
Carriage Co., believes a small group of people
wants to remove carriages from the streets
“because they think it’s abusive to have a

horse'pulling people around.” _

“They think horses ought to be free and in .
pastures, and you and I both know if it hadn't
been for horses. America wouldn’t. be. what it
is today." he said. '

Mr. Howze said he “wouldn’t think of
abusing my horses. it would be senseless not
to take care of my animals."

Huntna Takes a Dip inPopuIari

BY ROBER T RE/NHOLD
NEW YORK TIMES

 

 

 

 

 

Chester

he fir-covered slopes of the Sierra Ne-

vada are teeming with blacktail and

mule deer now, and when fall replac-

es summer the hunters will come to shoot

them just as surely as the winter snows will
follow. ‘ ‘

But the lure of the hunt is not what it
used to be for Chuck Mears, a construction
worker from Sacramento who says he won’t
be coming up here much this deer season.

“The area has just been infiltrated with
houses,” he said. “They’re moving the deer
back further and further.”

Mears’ sentiments are widely shared.
From the north woods of Maine to the des-
erts of Southern California, the ancient pur-
suit of hunting is experiencing a broad de-

cline. _.

The reasons speakvolumes about the

changing face of America as its rural past

recedes into distant memory. Ur-
banization has turned town into cit-
ies, shrinking wildlife habitats. Rec-
reational habits have changed, with
some peOple waging successful cam-
paigns against hunting. Tighter con-
trols have been placed on dwindling
supplies of game.

Nowhere is the trend more pro-
nounced than here in California.
Even as the state’s population swell-
ed by 35 percent from 1970 to 1986,
to 27 million, the number of reci-
dent hunting licenses issued plum-
meted 44 percent

There‘s less and less quality
land to hunt on,” said Gerald H.
Upholt, executive director of the
80,000—member California Wildlife
Federation. “A guy could go out for
a week and not see an animal. Also
our population is changing. More
people are turning to t..- has:
recreation, like watching a ball
game, that do not cost as much or
take as much time.”

Nationally, the figures are less
dramatic, but the trend is similar.
While the American population in-
creased 20 percent over the last two
decades, the US. Fish and Wildlife
Service reports the number of. li-
censes issued by the 50 states fluctu-
ated only slightly, peaking in 1982 at
16.7 million; by 1987 the figure was
15.8 million. .

a- a

An apparent exception is Michi-
f gan, where hunting restrictions
have been loosened recently be-
cause of an explosion in the deer
population. Licenses there rose by
56 percent in a decade.

In themselves, license figures
are not a direct gauge of hunting
trends, since the requirements and
fees change often and not all hunt-
ers: are obliged to buy a license. But
hunting leaders confirm the trend.

Receding natural habitat is a
major factor in the Northern Cali-
fornia wilds of the Lassen National
Forest, considered the best area for
deer hunting in the state. Retirees
from the San Francisco Bay area,
225 miles away, are putting up
homes around Lake Almanor, forc-
ing people like Mears to drive an
extra 20 miles to find good hunting.

The human assault is most dra-
matic in Southern California, where
developers have put the animals at
bay. “Drive down Interstate 5 south
of San Juan Capistrano -- most of
those communities did not exist 12
years ago,” said Bob Fusco, a Navy
engineer in San Diego who is presi-

dent of the California Wildlife Fed-

eration. _

 

 

Chuck Mears of Sacramento says he will be hunting less this year

Another major factor is that a
maturing generation has grown up
largely in an urban environment

' with many other distractions. “I
grew up on a farm and there wasn’t

much to do in the fall except hunt,” '
said William P. Anderson, chief of ,

the hunting license division at the
Pennsylvania Game Commission.
“Now I live in a town, and my kids
and everyone else’s have all these
sports to choose from.”

in addition, there is evidence
that American’s attitudes toward
wildlife, perhaps influenced by the
potent environmental movement,
have changed. According to a sur-
vey taken by the Fish and Wildlife

( .u ,. "#273“ C. . ..., _ r“ . ,_

‘There ’3 less and .
,_ less quality land

Service, the number of Americans
over 16 engaging in such nonlethal
activities as birdwatching, and feed-
ing and photographing wild ani-
mals grew from 83 million in 1980 to
135 million in 1985.

NEW YORK TIMES

 




Some hunters have been deter-
red by rising license fees and tight-
ened controls. The California De
partment of Fish and Game has an-
gered some hunters by alloting deer
tags in the most p0pular places by
lottery to limit the number of hunt-

ers and relieve pressure on shrink- ‘

ing habitats.

This has meant that local peo-
ple in these areas often cannot hunt
near their homes. “Some of the less
serious hunters have dropped out,”

said Terry Mansfield, fish and wild- ‘

life manager with the department.

Big game is big business. The

Fish and Wildlife Service estimates ,
hunters spent $10.1 billion in 1985 ,

on guns, telescopic sights, food,
lodging and magazines. While the

overall slowdown has not been .
great enough to cause sales drops ,

for most equipment makers, nei-
ther has there been great growth.

Paul S. Thompson, spokesman
for Browning. the maker of guns
and hunting accessories in Morgan,
Utah, said the company had contin-

ued to prosper by diversifying into ‘

other outdoor sports.

The market is not growing like
it was 20 or 30 years ago,” he said.
“Some smaller companies are prob-
ably being affected and it’s not an
easy business to get into now.”

Many hunters believe the sport
has been hurt by the growing anti~
hunting movement in liberal states
like California, where such interests
legally blocked this year’s mountain
lion hunt. and recently disrupted
the bighorn sheep hunt.

The California Wildlife Federa-
tion has attempted, in vain, to have
the legislature require public
schools to teach “about the role
hunting plays in wildlife manage-
ment,” according to Upholt, thedio
rector.

3 Charged With Selling
Pets to Medical Labs

By STEVE PADILLA, Times Staff Writer

Three San Fernando Valley resi—
dents, described by City Atty.
James K. Hahn as “cold—hearted,"
were charged Thursday with dup-
ing pet owners into giving away
dogs and cats that were then sold
for as much as $500 to medical
laboratories, where most ‘ died in
experiments. ‘

“Those animals were sentenced
to death,” said Hahn as he filed 73
misdemeanor theft and conspiracy
charges against Barbara Ann Rug-
giero, 25, and Frederick John
Spero, 43, both of Sylmar, and Ralf
J acobsen, 25, of Chatsworth.

Ruggiero owned two now-de-
funct Sun Valley kennels, Comfy
Kennel and Budget Boarding, and
along with Spero operated Bio—
sphere, a company that was li-
censed by the US. Department of
Agriculture to sell animals to re—
search facilities.

Ruggiero and Spero allegedly
paid J acobsen to obtain animals for
free, then sold them to three
Southern California laboratories
for prices ranging up to $100 for a
cat and from $250 to $500 for dogs.

Jacobsen allegedly got the ani-
mals by responding to classified
advertisements offering free pets
to good homes. He would tell the
pet owners that he would take the

animals to a ranch where they
could play with children and hors-
es, according to the complaint.

“I never heard of such a heart-
less scheme before,” Hahn said.

The complaint states that nine
pet owners, most from the San
Fernando Valley, were duped into

. giving away 14 dogs and cats

between last October and January.

“All but three of the 14 animals
listed in the complaint died in
medical research,” Hahn said. The
surviving animals were reunited
with their owners.

Ruggiero, Spero and Jacobsen,
who have not been arrested, are
scheduled for arraignment Sept. 22
in San Fernando Municipal Capri.
Ruggiero’s attorney, Hugh H.
Siegman, said Ruggiero probably
would plead not guilty to the
charges, but refused further com-
ment. Spero and J acobsen could not
be reached for comment.

' Biosphere sold 78 animals to
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Lorna
Linda University and the Veterans
Administration Hospital in Sepul-
veda, said Deputy City Atty. Nor-
man T. Wegener. The investigation
was aided by several pet owners '
and Last Chance for Animals, an
animal rights group based in North
Hollywood, a city official said.

' oad show converts kids i

into big fans of raptors

By Katherine Corcoran
Denver Post Staff Writer

When lecturer Sharon Hines in-
troduces her majestic birds to a
classroom, most students have
never heard the word “raptor.”

When Hines is done, the students
want to join campaigns, raise mon-
ey and vote to keep the birds of
prey alive and prospering.

The Raptor Education Founda-
tion, which uses 20 injured eagles,
hawks and other species to make
its point about conservation, has
taken its presentations cross-coun-
try and even to tourists on an Alas-
kan cruise.

But the Aurora-based organiza-
tion now is concentrating on its
most sympathetic audience —
schoolchildren.

Through its Spirit of America
tour last spring, the foundation
tried to convert 5,300 Colorado
schoolchildren from considering
the f ierce~looking birds as enemies
to caring about their survival.

This year, raptor advocates hope
to expand their road show to 10,000
Colorado students and possibly an-
other l5,000 students in neighboring
states. .

Raptors are birds that catch
prey in claws known as talons.

“When I’m old enough to vote,
I‘m voting to not have any of the
raptor birds-to be extinct,” Jada
Wilson of Carver Elementary
School in Colorado Springs wrote
after seeing the pmsentation.

“Raptors will live forever if we
help them survive those mean peo-
ple that don’t care,” added student
Nicky Lee Davis.

The campaign is being paid for
by nickels, dimes and quarters cus-
tomers throw into Raptor Educa-
tion canisters, which are placed at
7-Eleven stores around the state.

The canisters will begin appear-
ing again next month to finance
next year’s campaign, which be-
gins in March. The foundation rais~
ed $8,200 last year for presenta-
tions, which cost $125 an hour.

It hopes to raise another $10,000
by the end of November, and if it
can raise $15,000, the organization
will get a matching grant from the
National Fish and Wildlife Founda-
tion to travel the Rocky Mountain
West.

“We’re hoping the tour can go
national with a half-dozen crews
doing these year-round,” said Pe-
ter Reshetniak, founder and direc-
tor.

Seeing a presentation changed
Scott Brewster’s attitude toward
birds.

“My big brother Todd has a BB
gun and used to shoot small bird
(sic) such as robins and black-
birds,” Scott, another elementary
school student, wrote to the foun-
dation. “I really didn’t care much
until you told us they were my
birds he was killing, and how im—
portant they were.”

‘Judge Dismisses Frog Dissection Case

United Press International

Les Angeles

A lawsuit filed by a high
school student who refused to
dissect a frog on moral grounds
was dismissed yesterday by a
federal judge after her school
offered alternative classwork
using photos of frogs that had
died of natural causes.

In dismissing the suit, U.S. Dis-
trict Judge Manuel Real said Jenifer
Graham had pressed her case about
as far as it should go.

“I don’t think she has any
choice in this (accepting the com-
promise),” Real said. “She can’t take
this to absurdity. The Constitution
is not meant to be absurd.”

an, sued the Victor Valley High
School District in Victorville in San
Bernardino County in June 1987,
seeking alternatives to dissection.
The girl had argued that dissecting
frogs would violate her religious be-
lief that killing animals harms “the
God in everything.”

Roger Kindler, a Washington,
DC, lawyer for the Humane Soci-
ety who agreed to take Graham’s
case, said he might ask the court to
rehear the suit or appeal.

“They’re going to have to show
her (that the frog) died of natural
causes,” said Jodi Clary, another
lawyer for Graham.

“We’re certainly not going to
take the school district’s word for
it,” Kindler said.

veal baby food and ground cat food,

Surgeons at the University of
Florida Veterinary Medical Teach
Hospital rebuilt the panther’s left
hind leg on Monday in a four-hour
operation, using wire, screws and a
12-inch steel plate to piece together
the severely fractured thigh bone.
“The long-term prognosis is dif-
ficult to say yet,” said Lt. Jim Huff-
stodt of the Florida Game and
Fresh Water Fish Commission.
“The next few days will be impor~

pretty good.”

Graham had wanted to be test-
ed by use of models or transparen-
cies that do not require the death of
frogs, but the school district con-
tended that that would give her an
unfair advantage over students dis—
secting real frogs, whose organs are
not as easily defined.

Joseph Arias, a lawyer for the
school district, said the district de-
cided to try to settle the suit by
offering to provide Graham only
with frogs that died of natural caus-
es because the ‘suit “has cost us so
much money.”

He conceded that finding such
frogs may be difficult, but he said it
was not an “insurmountable prob-
lem.”

L Trainer hoping Flipper fans

 

 

By JANE SUTTON

’ _ jump in to sa ve Baiji dolphins

of United Press International

MIAMI — Twenty years ago,
dolphin trainer Ric O’Barry took
Flipper out of the warm Atlantic
waters of Biscayne Bay and into
millions of living rooms. .

Today, he is counting on Flippe
fans to help save the rare Baiji dol-
phins that share China’s congested
Yangtze River with one-tenth of the
Earth’s human population.

The International Union for Con-
servation of Nature and Natural Re-
sources declared the Chinese River
Dolphin one of the 12 most endan-
gered animals on the planet in 1986.

There are fewer than 300 left,
all in the middle and lower Yangtze.
Traffic on the river is expected to
double in the next decade, further
decreasing their chances of surviv-
a1.

“They will be extinct in less
than 10 years unless something hap-
pens now. This is a real emergen-
cy,” said O’Barry, home in Miami
after a July fact-finding trip to Chi-
na. ‘

The Chinese government has
designated three sites along the riv-
er, one between two islands in the
Datong region and two others near
Wuhan in Hubei province, for sanc-
tuaries where the Baiji can live and
breed in peace.

But there is no money to move
the dolphins into the sanctuaries. In
a region where few people have
enough food, saving the dolphins is
not a high priority.

“If it. is up to the Chinese, they’ll
become extinct. These people are
very poor, shockingly poor. Their
attitude is, if the dolphins can’t be
used for something, they’re not im-
portant. It’s going to take outside
help.

“This is not a Chinese problem.
.It is a world problem. The dolphins
are not nationalistic. They don’t
know they’re Chinese.”

'O’Barry believes the goodwill
and dolphin interest created by the
Flipper television show can help
provide that outside help.

“That show has run all over the
world. It is still running in Australia.
Everywhere in the world they know
Flipper, except in China,” O’Barry
said. “If all the Flipper fans would

get involved, we could save the dol-
phins.”

The Baiji, pronounced by-jee,
(Lipotes vexillifer) are freshwater
dolphins with blue-gray backs, white
bellies and. long, slender snouts. Un-
like the Atlantic bottlenose dol-
phins, they are blind and rely
entirely on their sonar to navigate.

The Baiji filled China’s rivers
when scholars of the Sihan Dynasty
wrote about them in 200 BC.

They were the weather forecast-O

ers of the Sung Dynasty a thousand
years later. Ancient boatmen noted
that they were seen more frequent-
ly before storms, and counted dol-
phins to predict the weather.

The Baiji died out as the rivers
filled With boats, water taxis, fish
hooks and pollution. Today, pig
farms crowd the banks of the Yang-
tze, dynamite is used to speed con-
struction of new bridges, boat
propellers slice the dolphins to bits
and people live in every inch of
space where a boat or raft can be
anchored.

Scientists at Nanjing Normal
University and the Institute of Hy-
drobiology in Wuhan recruited
O’Barry’s help after reading his
book, “Behind the Dolphin Smile.”

The hook tells how O’Barry
caught and trained the five Atlantic
bottlenose dolphins that portrayed
Flipper in the TV series, and how
he came to believe that captivity is
no life for a dolphin.

Back in the mid-19505, when Mi-

ami was a small oceanfront commu:

nity and Biscayne Bay was full of

dolphins, O’Barry and his friends

-used to catch them and sell them

for $300 each.

After a stint in the Navy, he got
a job catching and training dolphins
for the Miami Seaquarium, which

,. later became the back lot for the

“Flipper” series.

He trained animals for the show
and worked part time as a movie
stunt man, filling in underwater for
Sean Connery in the James Bond
movie “Thunderball.” :

After hours at Seaquarium,
O’Barry played the flute for Hugo
the Killer Whale, hoping to find a
musical language that would allow
humans to communicate with the
cetacean world. He arranged dol-
phin sing-alongs for Stephen Stills
and David Crosby.

He tried looking at the world
from the dolphins’ point of view and
decided it was pretty boring to live
in a tank and perform tricks in
shows five times a day.

When the “Flipper” series end-
ed in 1967, the dolphins were no
longer needed, but federal law pro-
hibits returning captive dolphins to
the wild. They ended up living in
small tanks where eventually they
died.

“After watching the Flipper dol-
phins die in captivity, I can’t go
back to making them jump through
hoops and wear silly hats,” O’Barry ‘
said.

O’Barry does not see his role as
an attempt to make amends for tak-
ing so many dolphins out of Bis-
cayne Bay.

State Panel
OKs Measure
to Boycott “
‘Puppy Mills’

By NOEL K. WILSON.
Times Staff Writer

SACRAMENTO—Citing ‘
“squalid conditions” at
Midwestern puppy breed- ' "
ing farms, animal rights
groups on Tuesday suc-
cessfully lobbied the Sen- 1
ate Judiciary Committee to j ,
approve a bill that would
prohibit bringing into the
state puppies under 12 4‘
Weeks old without their »
mothers.

The committee, after
hearing an hour of emo-
tional testimony from sup- 4
porters and opponents of
the bill, voted 7-1 to, in
effect, impose a statewide _
boycott on so-called “pup- ,
py mills" that mass breed

ll ‘ e

 

 

iy unprote
elements.

The bill, which has already
. passed the Assembly, was sent to ‘

the Senate floor, where a vote
could come as early as next week.

Most of these farms are located
in Kansas, Missouri and Iowa.
Those on both sides of the issue
agreed that few, if any. of the
puppy mills are in California.

Bob Baker, a field investigator
for the Humane Society of the
United States, said that the dogs
are raised in cramped conditions. in
cages with wire floors so that feces
can drop below the cage, ofte

ture.

to the animals. '10 seer: relief from

the pain of standing on the wire
floor, puppies are forced to stand in
their water dishes, said Baker, who
has inspected more than 450 puppy
mills.

Assemblyman Sam Farr (D-
Carmel) authored the bill, which
would make importation of the
puppies a misdemeanor punishable
with a $250 fine. Farr limited the
ban to puppies under 12 weeks
because at that age, proponents
said, it is difficult to spot health
problems and the genetic deficien-
cies caused by careless breeding
practices.

California is the largest buyer of
puppies from the breeding farms,
importing about 300,000 a year, or
about 60% of all the puppies sold in
California. Many times, Baker said,
people who buy these animals find
themselves paying enormous vet-
erinarian bills because the dogs are
often diseased. In some cases, he
added, the puppies can pass along
illness to their owners.

“This is not just a cruelty prob-

- lem,” Baker said. “It’s a consumer ?

fraud problem . . . [and] a public '

health concern.”

Dissent From Davis

Opponents of the bill agreed the
breeding farms pose health prob-
lems for the dogs. But they ques-

, tioned the constitutionality of a bill

that places restrictions on trade
between states. Sen. Ed Davis
(R-Valencia), who cast the sole
dissenting vote, also questioned the
legitimacy of restricting trade.
“You don’t have a logical bill,"
Davis told Farr. “You have an
emotional bill.”

Baker said that the puppy mills
are located in the Midwest largely
because of weak animal abuse laws
and the number of small farmers
that operate puppy breeding busi—
nesses to supplement their primary
income.

Due to increased attention on the
“puppy mill” industry, Kansas en-
acted legislation this year requiring
all commercial kennels to be li~
censed, regulated and inspected by

. The racing greyhound’s career
i: lasts no more than five years. and
? retirement is a grim prospect — it
often means death by lethal injec-
2 tion.
‘ Gloria Gibson is trying to make
: retirement something a greyhound
Qcan enjoy. She belongs to a non-
' profit organization that tries to find
the dogs homes as pets.

, She sets a good example. Bed-
: time Story. Xotic, Magic and Lori ~-
. greyhounds all too old or otherwise
i; unsuited for the track — greet visi-
-: tors to her Stone Mountain home
J with delight.

;_ As Xotic chewed avidly on a fa-

vorite toy. an old quilt. and her
‘.- housemates investigated a newcom-

er, sniffing and licking at the visi-

‘tor’s hands in turn. their mistress
i said a major challenge is convinc-
f- ing the public that greyhounds can
* make good pets. .

People whose only exposure to
greyhounds is at the track. watching
the muzzled animals in frantic pur-
suit of a lifeless metal lure. can
probably be excused for considering
greyhounds to be hyper, even vi-
cious, she said.

As pets. the dogs are gentle.
friendly and eager to please. Ms.
Gibson said. Though they are high-
ly competitive racers. they are even-
tempered pets. “My dogs are all fe-
males. but they get along with each
other fine, and they get along with
my three cats.” she said.

Still, she cautioned. any cat.
owner who acquires a pet grey-
hound needs to supervise them
closely until the animals become ac-
customed to each other. given the
greyhounds instinct to chase any-
thing that runs. But greyhounds are
naturally friendly toward children.
and are easily disciplined.

Their gentle nature does not
make for a’ good watchdog. however.
"They might lick a burglar to death,
but they sure won’t bark at one.”
said Ms Gibson, a secretary with
the DeKaIb County solicitor‘s office.

From 26 to 29 inches tall and
weighing 50 to 80 pounds, the sleek,
long-legged hounds race at speeds
approaching 50 mph. “They'll run
till they drop." Ms. Gibson said.

a fellow member of the organiza-
tion.

Though a greyhounds life ex—
pectancy is 12 years. its racing ca-
reer ends by the age of 5. said Mr.

Viener. Many leave the track before
then. “A dog can be a hundredth of
a second off, and that will put them
out of the money.“ he said. “They’re
fast, but they’re just not, fast
enough, and they become a liability
to their owner.”

wouldn’t chase the rabbit, and that
was it for her.” she said. stroking
the dog’s head.

Brandy, a greyhound owned by
Ms. Gibson’s daughter, Kathy Ben-
nett. was prone to bump other dogs
in her eagerness to leave the start-
ing box, Ms. Bennett said. Scratch
another racing career before it even

- started.

Relatively few greyhounds re-
main gainfully employed at stud
and as brood bitches after they are
too old to race. said Ms. Gibson. If
they are not put to death. they often
become blood donors to veterinari-
ans or medical research subjects.

Just in states like Texas and
Oklahoma. where dogracing was re-
cently legalized. Greyhound Pets of
America estimates that there is a
“whim of 12.000 greyhounds bred

for race tracks that were proposed
but never built.

Ms. Gibson said she has no in-
terest in dog races. but became in-
terested in the animals as pets after
learning of the Greyhound Pets of
America. ,

She said she has found homes
for about 20 greyhounds from ken-
nels in Connecticut. Alabama and
Indiana. Potential owners are sent
one of the organization‘s question-
naires seeking such information as
whether they have a fenced yard to
exercise the dog, requesting person-
al references and advising that. the
dog's racing career is terminated
and “you will be unable to reacti-
vate this career.”

“We try to determine that an
owner is sincere about keeping a
pet, that they're not out to resell the
dog to a medical laboratory." Ms.
Gibson said. She charges owners
$100 for their purebred greyhound.
“Basically. what we want is to re-
cover expenses. and if an owner
pays for the dog. we know they‘re
going to take better care of it." she
said.

In August, 1985, the DeKalb News/Sun printed an
article featuring our yard- as the nation’s 3357th
Backyard Wildlife Habitat, certiﬁed by the National
Wildlife Federation. Our. habitat includes shelters
where animals can dwell in safety. Now it seems that
our habitat has become a killing ﬁeld for a pack of
dogs who roam our suburban neighborhood, and we
wonder if even the children are safe. I

On July
and killed two pet raccoons in our back yard. They
destroyed their shelter, mutilated them, and snarled
at us. We called DeKalb'County Animal Control at
4:45 p.m. and again at 6" .m. —— both times with no
response, although we told3 them of the pack of dogs.
At 6:30, we phoned 911 to request a police ofﬁcer and
were put on “hold” for several minutes, then discon-
nected. We phoned again and got the same dispatcher
who spoke with Animal Control. He was told by them
that they had received no such call. Although he
seemed reluctant to do so, he did send a police ofﬁcer.
The officer saw the damage done'by the dogs and

called Animal Control, who ﬁnally arrived at approxi—
mately 7:30 -— 'a total of almost three hours from the
time we called. ' ' '

Why didn’t Animal Control respond sooner? Why
were we put on “hold,” then disconnected from 911?
What aboutthe attitude~of the dispatcher? Why did
Animal Central tell him they had received no such

call? Alipthese

are questions that really disturb me.

Sf0p Pack Of Dogs

Would they have responded if it had been a child
rather than pets that the dogs killed? (The Animal
Control officer told me that DeKalb County had only
eight units for the entire county). What are we paying
all these everincreasing taxes for?

This is not a new situation. These dogs have been
reported before my several neighbors. They .have
attacked dogs on leashes, and threatened others.
They tore apart our downspout and an underground
drain trying to capture a chipmunk. They have bitten
joggers (including me), I don’t know who, if anyone,
owns these dogs. I am doing my best to ﬁnd out and
put a stop to their destruction before they mutilate a
child or more pets.

Perhaps Animal Control and steeper ﬁnes or
punishments should be an issue to consider when we
elect county officials. Why is it so often put on the
back burner? We are tired of not being able to enjoy
our own property without fear of others’ animals
encroaching on our rights. When the dogs return to
our yard, there will be traps waiting (placed there by
Animal Control), and we will not hesitate to defend
our property, pets, and ourselves against these vi-

cious animals.

Abused '
Animals

Sheltered

By Tom Uhlenbrock
Of the Post-Dispatch Staff

David Garcia opened the door of a
stall and the light inside the barn fell
on a pony with the distinctive spotted
markings of the sturdy appaloosa
breed.

But the brown and white hide clung
to the horse's protruding hips, and its
frail legs were unsteady.

“Most of the horses that end up
here are starvation cases like this
guy,” Garcia said, turning to the
horse. “Come here, Patches. We’ve
already put 75 pounds on him. This
particular horse was so weak, when
he got down, he couldn’t get back
up.” .

Moving to an adjoining stall that
held a potbellied pony, Garcia said:
“This fellow was just like that. Now
he’s fat as a tick.”

Garcia, 36, is a former rodeo cir-

cuit rider and cowboy. He has little
sympathy for those who abuse his fa-
vorite mode of transportation --
which makes him perfect for his job
as manager of Longmeadow.

LongmeadOw, in Franklin County,
is a 165-acre farm that the Humane
Society of Missouri has turned into a
haven for abused horses and other
large animals. The farm, the largest
of its kind in the nation, took in its
first cases earlier this summer. Long-
meadow will be officially dedicated
- Sept. 25.

Only a mailbox marks the entrance
to the farm, which is off a gravel road
in a picturesque, secluded valley
southwest of Union. The property is
called the George H. Packwood Jr.
Animal Sanctuary in honor of the late
benefactor who made its purchase
possible.

“The 20 horses we have here now
are all involved in court cases,” Gar-
cia said, explaining why the sanctu-
ary did not publicize its site.

“Some individuals may do things to
retrieve their animals. We had three
people who were involved in one case
sneaking around, and I had to ask
them to leave.” .

Garcia lives in a small house on the
grounds with his wife, Earlene,
daughter, Quintana, 3, and three
barnyard dogs.

The farm’s residents also include
two pigs, two geese, five ducks and 11
goats, all of which were either donat~
ed, abused or found running loose.

But Longmeadow’s top priority is

horses. Garcia said-it had space to
handle up to 100 at a time. The farm
has a new 12-stall barn and covered

quarantine area and nine paddocks in.

the grassy expanse for which Long-
meadow is named. .

All the improvements were paid
for through donations. ‘ '

“Formerly, when a law enforce-
ment agency asked us to impound an
animal, we had to depend on people
to take care of them for us, and we
paid them so much a day,” Garcia
said. “Sometimes, they didn’t get the
best care. Now, we’re able to take

‘ starved and abused horses and bring

them back to full health.”

Garcia, who is part Papago Indian,

was born and reared on ranches in
Arizona, where he and five other
cowboys tended 20,000 head of cattle.
He has been an investigator for the
Humane Society for several years.
‘ For the last three years he has
been an instructor at the National
Horse Abuse Investigation School,
run by the American Humane Associ-
ation in Denver. ”

On a tour by pickup truck of the
fenced pasture, Garcia recounted the
history of each of the horses, which
were brought to Longmeadow from
throughout the state.

“We have horses here that were
starved,” he said. “We have horses
here that had massive injuries and
nothing had been done for them. We
have a horse that is 15 years old and
had never been out of a stall until it
got here. .

“People will say, “This horse is 16

 

 

years old. It’s supposed to look like
that.’ I’ll show you a horse down here
that’s 32 years old, and he’s fatter
than mine,” Garcia said. “Sixteen, in
my opinion, is a horse in its prime.
When I was roping in the rodeo, my
best horse was 18 years old.”

In most cases, Garcia said, he in-
structs the owners on proper care,

rather than impounding their horses.

“I’d much rather educate than take
a horse,” he said. “If they respond,
we will work with them. But when
they get irate, they flunk the attitude
test.”

A warrant is applied for and the
mistreated horse is brought to Long-
meadow to recover while the case is
in court. If the animals ultimately are
awarded to the Humane Society, they
are offered for adoption to families
that have asked for an abused horse.

“These horses. . . John Q. Public is
sometimes afraid to adopt them,” he
said. “They think they’d be mean,
and it’s the exact opposite.

“You give them a little care and
they love you even more for it."

them'off in a lecture called “Bats: Nature’s Own Bug Zap-
per." About 40 local residents attended. ,

“Mom people are afraid of bats,” Cope says. But most
such fears are unfounded. Contrary to popular belief, he
says, it’s highly unlikely bats will get tangled in your hair.
Bats can see and they “have one of the best sonar systems in
the world.”

They use their echolocation system to bounce sound
waves (above our hearing) off objects, listening for the echo.
They often congregate in huge colonies to hibernate, yet
“they never have a traffic jam. You don't see bats knocking
into one another." .

There is reason to be concerned about rabies in bats, but
people should not be unduly concerned, he says. “In the last
40 years there’s been only 10 deaths that can be attributed to
hats that have rabies."

Still, “bats are the only mammal that can carry rabies
without dying." The best advice is, if you see a sick-looking
bat (acting strangely or on the ground), “don't touch it.”

Bats have gotten a bad rap from the vampire bat’s pen-

chant for blood, Cope says. People have
been scared by films such as Dracula in
which vampires are portrayed as suck-
ing human blood. Of the more than
1,000 species of bats, only three are
vampire bats and none inhabit the Unit-
ed States.

The vampire bat is very small com-
pared to the world’s largest bat, the
fruit bat, which inhabits New Guinea,
the Philippines and the Tropics. The
fruit bat weights about 2 1/2 pounds and
has a wing span of 51/2 feet. The vam-
pire bat, which lives in South and Cen-
tral America, weighs less than an ounce
(15-20 grams) and is about 3 inches
long.

Two of the three species of vampire
bats feed 0n bird blood and one (the
smallest) feeds on mammal blood,
mostly cattle and horse blood. The lat-
ter is the most destructive, but even it
“doesn’t suck blood.” After slicing into
the animal’s skin with its sharp inci-
sors, “it laps up the blood.”

But blood is only the vampire bat’s
favorite meal. Seventy percent of the
bats in the world prefer insects, with
the brown bat common in Ohio munch-
ing up to 150 mosquitoes in 15 minutes.

Other bats feed on meat, pollen or
fruit. A bat in Peru feeds entirely on
fish.

Ohio has 11 known species of bats,
some of which only pass through on
their way elsewhere, Cope says. All of
Ohio's bats are insect eaters. Some stay
during the winter, seeking warm
southeasr walls of buildings or attics,
while others migrate south.

They are not rodents and are more
closely related to humans than to mice,
having the same bone structure in their
wings as we have in our arms and
hands (including a thumb for grasping).

The biggest of Ohio’s bats, about 5
inches in length, is the hoary bat, rec-
ognizable by its silvery fur coat. It
weighs 20 to 25 grams. The smallest is
the small-footed bat, which is about
21/2 inches long and weighs about 3
grams. (A dime weighs 2.3 grams.)

While some bats live in caves, others
live in open trees, the hollows of trees,
banana leaves (in the tropics), termite
nests and a multitude of other places,
such as attics and barns. Most are gre-
garious and seek other bats for compa-
ny, Cope says, but some, like the hoary
bat, are solitary.

Many of the insect-eating bats seek
caves for hibernation during winter
when they can’t feed. During hiberna-
tion their body temperature drops from
97-106 degrees to 34-36 degrees. Their
heartbeat drops from 400 to 25 beats a
minute. “In that state of torpor they
become very vulnerable,” Cope says.

Thousands of bats have been wiped
out by people playing sport with bats,
either shooting them or making loud
noises to wake them out of their winter
sleep. Awakened, but with no food, the
bats quickly die.

 

hio has 11 known
. species of bats, some
of which only pass
through on their way else—
where. All of Ohio ’3 bats
are insect eaters. Some stay
during the winter, seeking
warm southeast walls of
buildings or attics, while
others migrate south.

 

 

 

Cope recently visited the Eagle
Creek Cave in Arizona that 20 years
ago had about 30 million bats but now
has 30,000. The Indiana bat, on the fed-
eral endangered species list, has been
reduced to 500,000. A cave in Kentucky
that once had 200,000 of these bats
now has 25,000. “Kids went in with
firecrackers and a blowtorch and just
burned the bats off the walls,” Cope
says.

Bats need to be protected to protect
the ecolOgY, Cope says. Besides eating
insects, bats disperse seeds and polli-
nate flowers.

Bats are used for food in certain
Asian, African and South Pacific coun-
tries, and bat droppings are used for
fertilizer in developing countries. Sci»
entists also have been using bats in re-
search to help the blind find their way
in the dark and to learn more about
artificial insemination because they
have a delayed sperm implantation.

The best way to help conserve bats,
Cope says, is to leave them alone in
hibernation and to build or buy a bat
house, a bird house-like structure, open
at the bottom, with several slats inside
for bats to cling to.

Wooden bat houses are available for
$29.95 at Glen Helen or people can pick
up free plans to make their own, says
Lois Bradstreet, assistant administrator
for the center. The house should be put
up on a southeast wall any time this
winter before the bats return next
spring. “The free aCCommodations is
what attracts them,” Ms. Bradstreet
says. “Nothing else is needed.”

CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR - September 13, 1988

Saving the ‘teddy bears’ of the sea

Otters off California coast get new home far from oil-spill hazards

By Roy Nickerson
Special to The Christian Science Monitor
Monterey Bay, Calif.
The lot of the sea otter — known to
some people as “ﬂoating teddy
bears” and to scientists as Enhydra
lutn's — has not been easy. Their
population off the California coast
has diminished from more than
18,000 in 1800 to 1,724 in 1988. '
They were brought to the brink of
extinction by Russian, Spanish, and
Yankee fur hunters. It appeared that
they had been wiped out until 1938,
when a Big Sur rancher spotted sev-
eral small, furry animals ﬂoating on
their backs - the usual sea otter
position — off the mouth of Bixby
Creek, 15 miles south of Monterey.
Then, as these otters slowly mul-
tiplied and extended their territory
in search of food, they came at odds
with the commercial shellﬁsh indus-
try. Sea otters eat clams, abalone,
lobster, crabs, and sea urchins.
Now that they are getting a pre-
carious pawhold on the road to re-
covery, there is a new and insidious

threat in the very heart of their
range: oil.

The sea otter is unique among
marine mammals in that it has no
insulating layer of blubber. What
keeps it warm in the 50-degree wa-
ters is that same fur that excites coat
manufacturers. The fur is long and
thick, and the otter must keep it

ﬂuﬂ’y and full of air bubbles to keep ,

the water from coming in direct con-
tact with its skin. This keeps the
animal warm.

An oil spill that could mat its fur
would cause death by freezing with-

_ in hours. Some 104 million barrels of

crude and reﬁned oil are transported
up and down the Paciﬁc Coast annu-
ally. In addition, there has been a
proliferation of offshore oil rigs
there in recent years.

A leaky engine, the rupture of a
tanker, a ship sinking in a collision
or a storm, could cover hundreds of
square miles of ocean with oil. Such
oil spills have already taken a toll of
sea birds.

otter — a separate northern popula-
tion inhabits the coast of Alaska - is
220 miles along the central Califor-
nia coast (see map). This coastal
area also has some of the busiest
shipping lanes in the world. Conser-
vationists have long dreaded to
imagine What would happen to the
southern sea otter, should their pop-
ulation and an oil slick meet.

'Ibn years ago, the Friends of the
Sea Otter decided action must be
taken to set up a reserve breeding
colony of these otters where they
would be safe from oil spills.

The United States Fish and Wild-
life Service obtained a permit from
the Department of Interior in 1987
that allows 250 sea otters -— over a
ﬁve—year period and no more than
70 a year - to be translocated from
their normal habitat out to one of the
Channel Islands that are grouped
offshore due west of Santa Barbara
and Los Angeles. San Nicolas, the
smallest, is the farthest outside the
main tanker lanes.

Over the past two years 74 otters
were caught, tagged, and trans-
ported to San Nicolas island.

Now that enough time has passed
to assess the situation, it’s “good
news and bad news.” The good news
comes from Friends of the Sea Otter
biologist Rachel Saunders, who
worked with the Fish and Wildlife
Service during the translocation:

Please see OTTERS next page

 




 

OTIERS from preceding page

“About 20 sea otters have set up housekeeping at San
Nicholas - rafting, grooming, foraging, and breeding in
the near-shore island waters just as they must have done
more than a century ago.”

Ms. Saunders adds, “The remarkable news is that at
least 11 of the animals moved apparently decided that
while it was a nice place to visit, they didn‘t want to live
there. They have returned home to the areas where they
were captured -— incredibly some to within just a few
hundred meters of their former kelp bed rafting spots in
the near-shore waters off San Luis Obispo County. This
is a swim of more than 200 miles.”

Of the other missing otters, eight are known to be
dead: three from drowning in ﬁshing gear at other
islands, three from stress, and of two found dead on the
southern California mainland - one had been shot.

Later this year, another group of sea otters will be
captured and taken to join the small colony at San
Nicolas. “We will take younger otters this time," says

 

 

Michael Kenner, a biologist with the Fish and Wildlife
Service. “Apparently the homing instinct is more
strongly entrenched in the older otters, like most of those
we took in the ﬁrst move.”

“We never thought translocation would be a ‘quick
ﬁx, ’ ” said Carol Fulton, executive director of Friends of
the Sea Otter. “We realized that it would probably take
manv years before the success or failure of the breeding
colonv would be known.”

Fish and Wildlife is convinced that the translocation
effort lS worthwhile. “If the reintroduction is a long-term

success,” Mr. Kenner said, “it will be a giant step toward

the recovery of the California sea otter.”

A new pound forth

Giles County
finally gets to
move ahead on
a new animal
shelter

By KEVIN KlTl'REDGE

EARISBURG — Giles

County strays may be in

for a break. Plans for a

long-awaited modern an-

imal shelter to replace

the county’s cinderblock
pound near Eggleston cleared a ma-
jor hurdle this week when the state
Water Control Board gave the proj-
ect its approval.

The board — which received
an application for a Virginia Pollu-
tion Abatement permit from Giles
County a year ago — has deter-
mined the county doesn’t really
need one after all, said Elizabeth
Gresham, a water control engineer
in the board’s Roanoke office.

She said a new law has made a
permit for the Giles County project
next to the county landﬁll unneces-
sary.

 

Asked about the long delay,
Gresham said the county didn’t
complete its application until July
18. “We can’t process it until it’s
complete.” V

The engineer who handled the
application for the county said it
was incomplete because the board
kept asking more questions.

“The questions that were asked
were just totally out of proportion
to what was being requested,” said
Jeﬂ“ Crate of Draper Aden Associ-
ates in Blacksburg.

“They were really going
through the hoops on this. I think
Giles County got caught in the mid-
dle of a bureaucratic policy mix-
up.”

But Gresham’s supervisor at
the Water Control Board, Julie
Grzyb, said everyone is asked the

same questions.

“We need to know a great deal
of information. Until we get that
information there’s no way we can
proceed,” she said. They couldn’t
waive the permit, she said, until
they’d reviewed the application
carefully.

County Administrator Barbara
Hobbs said she was both happy and
relieved by the board’s decision, but
declined to comment on the delay.

“I don’t think that makes a
whole lot of difference,” said Her-
bert “Hub” Brown, a county super-
visor. “We have approval, and that’s
what’s important.”

The road to a new animal shel-
ter has been rocky.

In 1981, Michael J. Davis, an
attorney and member of the Giles
County Humane Society, took the
county to court over the issue.

. He said his petition called for
the county to build a new pound that
met state guidelines. The petition
charged, among other things, that
water at the pound was provided to
animals in dirty tin cans, if at all;
that animal waste was shoveled out
from under the suspended cages and
simply tossed into a nearby ﬁeld;
that the pound lacked temperature
control, proper lighting, and ade-
quate ventilation; that it was inac-
cessible to the public; and that the
cages were too small for large ani-
mals to turn around in.

. Circuit Judge Robert Powell de-
nied the petition in 1985, and Davis
later abandoned his suit. Davis said
last week he dropped it because the
county ﬁnally seemed to be moving
on the problem.

“They don’t want to do it,”
added Davis, when asked why it has
taken so long to build an animal
shelter here. “It’s attitude.”

County oﬁicials have other ex-
planations.

“The bureaucracy of county
and state government agencies try-
ing to work toward a common goal

takes a long time,” said Supervisor
Willard Gowdy.

“It’s been on the back burner
for too long, whatever the reason,”
Gowdy added. “I deﬁnitely think
it’s going to be an asset to the coun-
ty.,,

Part-time Animal Control Ofﬁ-
cer E.B. “Bennie” Baker said the
problem has always been that “the
county doesn’t have a whole lot of
cash.” ,

Hobbs said the state veterinari-
an —- who ﬁled an uncomplimenta-
ry report on the current dog pound
after a recent visit -— still must give
ﬁnal approval to the plans for a new
pound, although work may proceed
in the meantime.

Dr. Barry Dawkins has reported
the current Giles County pound fails
to meet minimum state guidelines

for cleanliness and protections-

against heat and cold, Dr. Lorenz
Beuschel, assistant state veterinari-
an, satd this week.

Beuschel said the guidelines are
not technically law —— but some oth-
er counties that failed to meet them

here to heart.

But they don’t give each other the time of day.

Shirley McClung, president of the SPCA, called
it “a difference of opinion.”

“The Humane Society and the SPCA don’t see
eye to eye,” said McClung, who rounds up strays here
herself in an SPCAvan and takes them to the modern
animal shelter in Mercer County, W.Va. “There’d be
no way we could ever work together.”

“About a snowball’s chance in hell,” echoed
Humane Soaety Treasurer Michael J. Davis.

The differences between the two groups go back
years, to when there was only the Humane Society
and both McClung and Davis belonged to it.

McClung said an argument occurred between
Davis and Connie Dodson, who had just become the
Humane Society’s new president. Dodson quit to
start the SPCA.

Dodson this week denied there was an argument
between her and Davis, saying she quit because the
Humane Society wasn’t accomplishing anything.

Dodson quit the SPCA as well last January, she
said, because the group voted to sell hot dogs at an
SPCA fund-raiser and she is a vegetarian.

McClung said she tried to keep her membership

and join the SPCA too, at the time of the split, but the
Humane Society kicked her out.

She said Davis’ attorney even sued her, claiming
she had six dog houses that were Humane Society
property. '

“They had some stuff we thought belonged to
us,” explained Davis. He said there were also some
ﬁnancial records involved.

McClung eventually turned over the dog houses
to the Humane Society. “It was a big, stupid mess,”
she said. “It shouldn’t have happened.”

Dodson said it is “a tragedy” the two groups
can’t get along.”

It is a headache for county ofﬁcials, who this
week cleared a major hurdle in their efforts to built a
new animal shelter.

On Monday, the state Water Control Board said
a new pound at the county landﬁll would not require
a Virginia pollution abatement permit, for which the
county has been waiting a year.

Both McClung and Davis have said they want to
be involved in the operation of a new animal shelter.

County Administrator Barbara Hobbs said she
wasn’t aware the two groups weren’t willing to work
together. She said a ﬁnal decision on who operates
the new pound must be made by the Board of Super-
wsors. -

have been ordered by the courts tr
> bring their pounds into compliance.

; Hobbs, meanwhile, said the
. plans must also be submitted to the
z Board of Supervisors before con-
istruction can begin, because new
rboard members have been elected
; since the plans were ﬁrst submitted
f to the Water Control Board last fall.
l “1 think this board has a right to
3 ﬁnal approval,” she said.

' Hobbs said she hopes to put the
3 dog pound on the Board of Supervi-
’ sors’ agenda for the ﬁrst or third
' Tuesday in September.

, The current dog pound, a 26-

; year-old makeshift affair Baker built

' himself in his yard, has long been a
lightning rod for complaints.

Baker, who retired three years
ago as the county’s full-time animal
warden, recently started receiving
$300 a month rent for his dog pound
from the county, after years of get-
ting nothing.

He said he built the pound as a
temporary measure until the county
built its own.

“They asked me if I could keep
the dogs until they built a dog
pound. Nobody had any idea it
would be this long,” said Baker, 66.

The pound juts like a wart from

1 an outbuilding on Baker’s property

near Eggleston, amid scenic Appa~
lachian farmland. To enter. a visitor
ﬁghts off clouds of black ﬂies. The
stench is tremendous.

One day this week there were
six dogs in the 10 wire cages. Once a
week, said Baker, he hauls the ma-
nure to the landﬁll.

“It’s an oven in the summer and
an icebox in the winter,” com-
plained Catherine McCurry, presr-
dent of the nearby Mercer County
(W.Va.) Humane Society, whose an-
imal shelter handles many animals
brought by Giles County residents.

“It’s the responsibility of the
county to provide a shelter,”
McCurry said. “And that could nev-
er be called a shelter.”

Crate, with Draper Aden, said if
the board approves the project in
September that should still leave
time for construction before cold
weather sets in. He said the county
will handle the construction phase of
the projeCt itself.

Seoul develops distaste for

Special to the Globe

EOUL - As the eyes of the world

turn toward Seoul. one of the city's

favorite dietary delights is getting

harder to find. it‘s not ice cream.
lemonade or some other cooling treat to
beat the August heat. It’s dog meat.

Under pressure from animal rights ad»
vocates abroad and politicians at home
seeking to project a modern image for
Seoul. where the Summer Olympics will be
held next month. the city has banned the
sale of dog soup at 740 dog-meat outlets.
The crackdown has tightened as the Sept.
17 torch-lighting ceremony nears.

The sign outside the Lilac House. a dog-
meat diner in southern Seoul. says, “Vol-
untarily closed from Aug. 1 to Nov. 1 be-
cause of the Seoul Olympics."

But the ban has not entirely stopped the
consumption of dog meat, a tradition Kore-
ans trace back thousands of years to their
roots in Mongolia. Dog meat is most popu‘
lar in the hot days of summer when. it is
said. the lean canine meat goes down easi-
ly, producing extra vigor. stamina and re-
cuperative powers — especially for men.

South Korea's new democratic reforms
are making the ban somewhat difficult to
enforce. denying the government its former
absolute power to stop whatever it disliked.
Many restaurants have shut. but dogs —
living or cooked — are still sold openly in
markets.

One type of dog favored for the table is
the Hwang Gu, a beige, short-haired ani-
mal about the size of a cocker spaniel. An—
other is the Chindo. which is similar in size
and shape but more golden in color.

People who are fond of the delicacy dis-
like the campaign against their traditional
repast.

“How can foreigners dare say we can‘t
eat dog meat?” demanded Choi Bong Hyun.
32. a dog salesman at the Chungang Mar-
ket east of downtown. “People shouldn't
criticize us for our food. If something else is
wrong. OK. But food is our culture."

Choi‘s dogs lay listless in wire cages,
panting in the August sun. Nearby, a
cooked and quartered dog carcass was
ready for sale in a glass case. A. live dog was
taken from its cage, bundled into a burlap
bag. then strapped on the back of a motor-
cycle and driven off.

Only special dogs are eaten. Choi said.

"Hounds. pointers. poodles, we don't
eat." he said. “Pet dogs in Korea are never
cooked for eating.“

But animal rights groups abroad want
an end to the dog meals. An ad placed in
British dailies by the International Fund
for Animal Welfare shows a photograph of
a dog hanging by its hind legs.

"Outside Seoul’s Olympic Park." the
caption reads. “cats and dogs, just like our
pets. will be brutally killed as luxury food
for those who believe such dishes give them
the strength and stamina of the animals."

Seoul has spent $3.1 billion to be host to
the games. and the government does not
want to let local custom distract foreign
visitors and television viewers from the na-
tion‘s remarkable economic development.

Said a European diplomat. “That‘s the
price you pay for opening yourself to the
wOrld." .

Traditional dog shows have been orga-
nized. and the government-run news agen-
cy. Yonhap. has published articles that
say. ”Dogs are Korea’s No. 1 pet."

“Our basic policy is to stop doing that
kind of business in the Seoul area and
throughout the country because it gives a
bad image to our country." said Kim Sang
Burn. a spokesman for the Seoul city gov-
ernment.

While ending dog eating might make for

bad. politics at home among increasingly
proud and nationalistic South Koreans.

“The politicians are ashamed because
they don't appreciate our Korean food cul-
ture." said Chang Sang Sup. author of sev—
eral articles defending the practice. “People
in politics don't know our history. They are
trying to discard it because they feel
shame." ‘

Chang spoke over a meal-pf dog stew at
an outdoor restaurant beside a stream
north of Seoul. The meat, which arrived in
a cauldron. was roasted at the table on a
bed of greens liberally. spiced with red pep-
pers. -

“It's a special recipe. a secret recipe."
said chef Lee Kang Soon. smiling.

She was reluctant to divulge her culi-
nary secrets. not because she feared the au-
thorities but because she feared the compe-
tition. She had heard about American ef-
forts to sell beef in South Korea.

“l‘m not going to tell you any more.” she
said. “Maybe you’ll try to export dogs from
America. We don’t want American dogs

- here. They're too big. and they don‘t taste

good."

Researchers are studying
how squirrel monkeys have
adapted to subtropical j.
habitat of South Florida:

By TOULA VLAHOU
Staff Writer

ORT LAUDERDALE — For the 25 years

they have been swinging from fig trees and

strutting on wires, a bunch of playful squir-

rel monkeys were just another attraction to
= the sprawling, 35-acre Bartlett estate.

But for Broward Community College instructor
John Fletemeyer and Ryan Wheeler, a junior at Flori-
da Atlantic University studying anthropology, this
monkey business is vital research.

Fletemeyer and Wheeler are studying how the mon-
keys, indigenous to places such as the Amazon basin in
South America. have adapted to the subtropical envi-
ronment of South Florida. ;

In their natural habitat. squirrel monkeys are hunt-
ed by predators such as snakes and wild cats. By con-
trast, at the Bartlett estate their placid existence. void
of natural enemies, is a curious aspect of their life.
Fletemeyer said. .-

Fletemeyer is examining the monkeys‘ behavior for
a documentary film on wild animals, which he plans to
use in a new animal behavior course at the college.
where he teaches part time. He also wants to distrib-
ute the film to other educational institutions.

Wheeler is collecting data for a research projec .-

Fletemeyer is studying the monkeys because he
says they are living in an environment different from
their natural habitat, the deep jungles and marshes in
the Amazon. .

Wheeler, a former student of Fletemeyer’s, tends to
disagree. He said the miniature squirrel monkeys
have been seen in other subtropical areas, such as Hai-
ti. ‘1'

Both Fletemeyer and Wheeler were on the estate
this week, observing the 18-inch-long. 24-ounce crea-
tures leap from tree to tree. wrestle on the ground, eat
grapes and play Catch across tree branches. at;

As part of a test to determine whether the monkeys‘
fear is inherent or learned. Fletemeyer said he will
walk a leashed dog through the estate to gauge the
monkeys’ reaction. Dogs have been known to roam the
estate, sometimes eating the squirrel monkeys or bit—
ing off their tails. 'n

The animals also have provided companionshipfor
the estate’s owner, lOO-year-old Evelyn Bartlett, who
spends summers in Massachusetts. When in Florida.
she lives in Bonnet House, on the estate. j

She has owned the property for 56 years. Afterher
death, the estate will be turned over to a public trust
to preserve the undeveloped site, between the ocean
and the Intracoastal Waterway south of Sunrise Bou-
levard. ..

Bartlett’s fondness for monkeys is displayed
throughout her home, with large wood carvings of var-
ious species of the animal. .7

According to folklore, two pairs of Brazilian squir-
rel monkeys were owned as pets by members of a
nearby social club more than 25 years ago. But some
members decided that the monkeys would be happier
out of the cage and they were released. Since then, the
monkeys have multiplied.

According to Fletemeyer, the monkeys‘ forefathers
were tourist attractions more than 20 years ago at the .
now-closed Monkey Bar restaurant. the current site of
the Covenant House, near the estate.

Fletemeyer said that the monkeys learned that they
would be awarded jam for an appearance before
morning customers.

Fletemeyer said the 43 monkeys that careen
through the Bartlett estate are second or third genera-
tion. Four of the monkeys are pregnant. Their life ex-
pectancy in captivity is 10 to 15 years. Monkeys have a
shorter life span in the wild because of predators.”

Rare sea turtles
may be first born

in captivity in us.

By JUDY HILL
Tribune Staff Writer

CLEARWATER — Two
Kemp’s ridley sea turtles — a
nearly extinct breed —- were
hatched Saturday at the Clearwa-
ter Marine Science Center in what
may be the first hatching of the
species in captivity in the United
States.

The endangered turtles once
were found throughout the Gulf of
Mexico in large numbers. But pol-
lution, commercial fishing nets

While the hatching is consid-
ered good news at the Marine Sci-
ence Center, its effect on the
survival of the turtle species in the
wild may be negligible.

Dr. Edward Klima, director of
the National Marine Fisheries Ser-

vice’s research center in Galves-

ton, Texas, said the hatching
“doesn’t have any bearing” on the
preservation program.

Although Marine Fisheries has
placed Kemp’s ridleys at several
aquariums around the country as

The breeding turtles at the Ma-

about 6 years old and have been
there about five years, Kellenber-
ger said. The female nested in an
artificial beach built specifically
for the Kemp’s ridley and com-

pleted in May.

' On June 2, the turtle laid "a
clutch of 21 eggs, but only two
were fertile. Clearwater’s Kemp's

rine Fisheries Service, the Mexi-
can government, the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service and the National
Park Service.

Survival of the breed only in
captivity, he said, would indicate a
failure of the international effort
to preserve the turtles.

Manley Fuller, president of the
Florida Wildlife Federation, was
more excited. “I think that it’s
very interesting that the animals
have been able to complete their
life cycle in captivity. To my
knowledge, this may be prece-
dent-setting.”

Fuller added that while the
overall conservation strategy for
the species should concentrate on
the wild population, "this is a very
interesting development zoologi-
cally.”

over beavers linked to VSE ,

A rural lawyer and a Washington law firm will square off in
court later this year over the bizarre goings-on at a beaver
ranch in Montana that formerly had its shares listed on the
. Vancouver Stock Exchange.
Montana County Attorney John Robinson of Ravalli sees him-
»self as David pitted against Goliath in the person of Roger Gal-
vin, the Washington, DC, lawyer who is acting for People For
the Ethical Treatment of Animals, an animal rights lobby with
250,000 members.
The two will lock horns in November over a felony theft

ployee Jeanne ROUSh. 51161.5 alleged ——-~ animals, dating from the death or (and perhaps as early as. the 11th),

to have kidnapped several "hundred
beavers from a fur ranch in Ste-
vensville, Mt.

It is the first time a PETA mem-
ber has been charged, a spokesman
for the Washington group said.

The Stevensville ranch had a his-
tory of abusing its charges, as had
at least one other beaver operation
run by International Domesticated
Furs Ltd., a company headed by
< Dennis Crum of Fresno, Calif.

IDF was listed on the VSE where -

its shares last traded for 5 cents in
December, 1987. That’s a far cry
from the assigned value of $2.60 a
share that debtholders agreed to
when they converted $1-million of
debt into stock in 1984.

From the begining, IDF needed
.capital, which was always coming
but never arrived. Just over a year;

. 200 beavers last fall. The animals
{starved because IDF was no longer
. paying for feed.

At that time, Mr. Robinson ob-
tained a court order to allow the

, local humane society to look after

i

the beavers. That in turn led to

'charges and, in March, a misde-

meanor conviction for cruelty to
animals.

The company was ordered to pay
a $500 (U.S.) fine and $4,400 expens-

es to the humane society that fed
. the animals -— although Mr. Robin-
} son wondered at the time where the

‘Wsammmg be-

tween two financing options to meet

" near-term needs of $3-million
(U.S.).

_ IDF began as a junior mining
company that got into the fur busi-
ness in 1984 to breed beavers for
their pelts. Four years ago, it an-
nounced a four-year plan to expand
its herd to 10,000 from 620.

In 1985, when it said it had raised
enough money to feed its charges
for 90 days, a Vancouver business
writer wondered what would happen
when the money ran out.

“We can get a chain saw, go into
the woods and chop down some
trees because beavers eat bark,”
Mr. Crum said at the time. But that
didn’t happen. Instead, the beavers
starved.

IDF ran out of money not once,
but on several occasions, which led
to bouncing pay cheques for its
employees at the ranch, a shortage
of feed for the beavers and death for
hundreds of the animals.

This past March, the VSE delist-
ed IDF for failing to file a basic
corporate document. Its shares
were suspended from trading on
Dec. 16 after changing hands for
prices as high as 63 cents (Cana-
dian) in 1987 and 90 cents in 1985.

The delisting preceded by several
days the company’s conviction and
fine on two charges of cruelty to

money would come from.

That was the second charge
against IDF. In January, 1986, the
Humane Society of Utah investigat-
ed a complaint about a subsidiary
that ran a beaver farm in Orem,
Utah.

Between 100 and 200 beavers
starved and charges were laid. The
company and its local manager

‘ were placed on probation. Charges

against Mr. Crum were dropped
because he “was only a money
man” and had no say in running the
farm, the Utah prosecutor said in
1986.

In early June, reports about bea-
vers starving at the IDF farm in
Montana began to circulate. Ms
Roush, director of research and
investigations for PETA, was on the
scene by June 6 and began feeding
the animals, cleaning their pens and
arranging for the worst cases to be
killed.

“It’s the most disgusting situation
we’ve ever seen,” she said on the
day she arrived. Beavers are not
carnivores, yet there was evidence
they had been gnawing each other.
The animals need water to live, yet
the fresh water system had broken.
Beavers are naturally clean, but the
pens were filthy.

A friend wrote that the impact of

all this on Ms Roush was that she

“suffered immeasurably . . . hav-
ing to deal with animals that were
so distressed.”

According to reports in local
papers, PETA members soon
brought cages on to the ranch; by
June 9, nobody but members were
welcome on the site. Bv June 14

about 200 beavers were gone.

There was an initial spurt of
beaver sightings in the area, but
several days later local police were
quoted as saying that PETA had
rented two cars — one had been

found “full of beaver hair, drop-
~ pings and odor” in Cheyenne, Wyn,
, and the other had been found in

“Similar-"condition in Portland, Ore.

Charges against Ms Roush fol»
lowed. Pa‘r't of Montana’s case says
the beavers belonged to two compa-

I nies, Pan Orient Ltd, a BC compa-

ny that lent IDF $300,000 (Cana—
diam), and Lake Milling Inc., a
Montana company that held some
IDF shares and provided feed to the
ranch. .

Lake Milling sued Ms Roush last
week, adding a civil case to the
criminal charge.

PETA has tried, unsuccessfully,
to untangle the corporate relation
ships, Mr. Galvin said. A Washing-
ton spokesman said it is also trying
to find out why the VSE does not
take any responsibility for its listed
companies.

Meanwhile, IDF is about to rise
again. Robert Bennett, president of

iHollyburn Development Corp. of

Vancouver, said his company has
put $100,000 into IDF, is reorganize

: ing it and wants to have the stock
traded again on the VSE, perhaps

under another name.
There will be new financing, cred-

, itors of IDF will convert their debt

into equity, the old company will be
merged into an existing VSE shell
and the beavers -- an uncertain
number, but more than 200 ~- will
be brought to Canada in November,
Mr. Bennett said. 1
In California, Mr. Crum is in--
volved in personal bankruptcy pro— ‘

Why California’ s timber companies are
behind this season’s special bear hunt

 

BY BRYANJA YBASHIN
‘ ldon‘t want to give the hpression that

 

every bear feeds on trees -— or even

that most of them do,” said Herb
Pierce, a wildlife biologist f or the California
Department of Fish and (lame. “But the law
says we must allow the individual to protect
his resource.”

Calif ornia’s Fish and Game Commission
voted this spring to set up a special bear
hunt this year, starting last month. Private
hunters —— for the first time ever ——.were

granted 250 permits to shoot bear in the
private timberlands in Humboldt and Del
Norte counties.

Three Northern California timber com-
panies -— Louisiana-Pacific, Arcata and
Simpson —— said they want the bears shot
because they damage their redwood planta-
tions. For a six-week period in the spring,
some black bears scrape away at redwood
bark in search of the'tree’s sweet~tasting
inner cambium. This kills some trees and
damages others. Though the timber compa-
nies hax 9 never published a formal study on
the extent of the damage they want it re-
duced.

The littlenoticed approval for this
year's special hunt was intended to avoid a
repeat of the governmentconducted depre-
dation hunts of 1987, in which a record 68
bears were killed - cruelly, in traps. Start-
ing in 1980 -— after issuing very few permits
for years —— the DFG began without fanfare,
to issue more depredation permits to timber
companies

The DFG had no choice. California’s
Depredation Statute, which has been on the
books since at least the 19305, grants land
owners the right to kill elk, beaver, gray
squirrels. wild boar and hear, if the animals
do any damage to property.

property means trees. Last year a halfdozen
timber companies there felled a billion

This year s depreciation substitute —-— 
the special hunt —— is taking place in a sea of
biological ignorance Although no one is say-

ing that black bears will become eittinot.

anytime soon, scientists don’ t know how
many of them exist They .dont know how
many can be hunted before the population
will crash, or whether the bear’ 5 average age
dropping below reproductive age will cause
adisaster. . ‘ - -' ‘ '

No study has been published on how

many trees the bears actually kill in Califor—.

nia. The timber companies give widely rang-
ing and inconsistent estimates.

Timber companit ‘ -ave had little incen-
tive to study the problem. In the past, just by
asking, they’ve gotten free state permits to
trap bears on their lands. Then government
trappers from the US. Department of Agri-
culture 3 Animal Damage Control section set
traps and shoot the bears. The timber com-
panies don’ t spend a dime. It’s estimated
that each bear killed by a USDA trapper
costs taxpayers $600.

Trapping bear isn't pretty. Most bears
are lured to baited leg traps anchored in the
ground Seized by the leg, the bear is tor-
mented in an unspeakable frenzy to free
itself. When the trapper returns, he shoots
the hear immediately. Most trapped bears
are left to rot on the forest floor.

Last year North Coast lumber compa-

 

nies asked for —— and received — permits to
kill 68 bears this way. After the ensuing
wave of negative publicity, they agreed to
this year '3 special hunt instead. ,

“It may seem rather harsh that we kill
an animal just because he’ s destroying prop
erty," said Don Koch, the DFG’s top bear
expert, “but when you look at the species as
a whole, it is one of our better management

"The timber companies aren‘t anti-wild-
life,” he said, “they’ re just pro-timber. ”

like trees once had an average age of half a

began to grow. So more bears began to live
in the newly logged patches.

They were lucky to find the new habi»
tat. As farmers, ranchers and miners deci-
mated the Bear Republic‘s bear population,
few areas were safe for the huge mammals.
Today maybe 10 percent of the original bear
population survives, twothirds of it concen-
trated in California‘s six northernmost coun-
ties.

The unnaturally young private forest of .
25 to 60yearold trees was at first a paradise ‘

for the black bears, who became fat on this
private empire of salmon-filled creeks, sum-
mer berries and clover. They would lie on
their bellies and scoop clover into their
mouths like candy.

Slowly, the paradise was lost. Erosion
from poorly constructed logging roads
choked streams and decimated the historic
salmon runs. European pasture grasses al-
most annihilated California's native species.
The quick-growing European grasses turn
brown long before native grasses. The bears
now had months when no fresh grass, an
important food source, was available.

In recent decades, the bears' best
springtime food, newly clearcut brushy ar-
eas, has been turned into a gastronomic des-
ert by the timber companies’ widespread
herbicide spraying. The spraying is intend-
ed to eliminate any plant competition with
newly planted saplings. '

Somewhere along the line, some hun-
gry bears probably relearned a old trick:
peeling trees. They‘d claw away the bark
and use their teeth to eat a l/ldinch-thick
layer of living tissue called cambium, which
grows just under the bark. They hadn‘t used
this trick much in California’s original for;
ests, partly because they had other, more
nutritious food and partly because the trees
were so old their thick bark was too much
work to peel away.

hen today's North Coast bears
emerge from hibernation, there

isn’t much to eat. So, for a few
weeks in May and June, some of them climb
10 or 20 feet up young redwoods and claw
away the bark. As soon as other food sources
become available in June or July, the claw-
ing seems to stop.

If a bear strips the living cambium com-
pletely around a tree, it will die. If the tree is
partly stripped, its growth may be stunted.

“You can drive along a road and all of a
sudden you come around a turn and every
tree is damaged. It can be overwhelming,”
said Grey Giusti, a farm adviser with the
University of California Cooperative Exten-
sion in Crescent City. But the damage may
be more apparent than real, since wild ani-
mals tend to use the same logging roads that
vehicles do.

From the air, the damaged redwoods
are easy to spot. The tops of the tree turn
bright red, in contrast to the brown usually
indicative of insect damage.

A bear’s long memory ensures that it
will remember this survival skill into old
age, about 30 years. Should the bear have
cubs, they'll also learn the technique. This
learned behavior can become part of what
could be called bear culture. Some bear pop-

ulations seem to know about tree scraping,
while others are still living in the Stone Age.

he special hunt will be bad news for

bears living in Redwood National

Park, adjacent to Louisiana-Pacific
and Arcata Redwood special hunt zones.

There are probably close to MIX) bears
in the long, narrow park, a 172-5quaremile
biological enclave. There, Terry Hofstra, a
Park Service wildlife ecologist, says female
bears, with their one- to twosquare—mile
ranges, would probably stay inside park
boundariesj

“The exception is males,” Hofstra said.
“Large males’ range can be 20 square miles
-— but there are few places where a 20-
squaremile range would fit inside our park,
which, being long and narrow, is at most five
miles wide."

Hofstra said the males, as well as the
young dispersing cubs, would likely cross
out of thepark and into LP or Simpson
special hunt areas. This bear mobility is the

greatest flaw in the idea that killing bears ‘

will solve timber company problems.

"it you have a special hunt with some
regularity, that will leave habitat available
-— and dispersing animals will wind up in it,"
said Hofstra. “So privately held lands will
become repopulated with younger, unhunt-
ed bears who live inside Redwood National
Park.”

\ ll the years I was hunting to con.
trol bears,” said Ralph Flowers,
“I’d been searching for an alterna-

tive.”

Flowers, a former professional trapper
;.; L.. - . sDA in Aberdeen, Washington, had
killed more than 1,120 bears over 16 years. In
1984, Flowers discovered that female bears
have very small home ranges, and a solution
occurred to him: supplementing their feed-
ing when they‘re likely to peel trees.

“After all, here in the Northwest we’ve
been killing bears for years and it still hasn’t
stopped the damage,” he said.

Flowers got approval for his project

 

sf

“In many of the areas, it's doing a better
job than many of the hunts we’ve had,” he
said. In fact, damage to the Douglas fir,
hemlock, spruce and cedar trees is down in

. some places between-'85 and 100 percent.

“1 would think this feeding technique
would work in the redwood plantations of
California," he said, “and it could really re-
duce the number of special permit hunts.”

The cost of Flowers’ feed: about $2.50
per day per bear, or about $140 per bear for
the spring season.

Flowers’ limitedsupplemental feeding
isalready saving bears - and board feet —
in Washington. Thirty miles east of Seattle,
Weyerhauser’s 200,000-acre Snoqualmie
Tree Farm has had bear problems and hunts
for years. Then, two years ago, Flowers per-
suaded Weyerhauser to try his technique.

“It’s the most effective tool we have
available to us to reduce bear damage,” said

to

Weyerhauser. “We’re literally overjoyed to
have a tool as effective as this. . . . If we can

from Washington foresters, his employers,
but hadn‘t a clue what the bears would eat
Neither did animal nutritionists. “So I just
had to go on my own and come up with
something,” the 59year-old hunter said.

The first year Flowers concocted a pel-
let that bears would eat, but weren’t particu-
larly fond of. He kept at the taste tests with a
few captive bears.

“Eventually I found a formula they real-
ly gobbled up.” he said. Like tree cambium,
the mixture contains lots of sugar, as well as
fruit and vegetable fiber and beet pulp.

In 1984, Flowers started attaching five-
gallon buckets of the feed to trees. Today,
tons of Flowers’ formula are used through-
out Washington state. Using a feeder every
10 square miles, the method has protected
more than 1,600 square miles of forestland
in western Washington.

in past years don’t need them now because
the trees have grown too large for the bears
to desire them.

Because tree damage has been reduced
so dramatically, Weyerhauser reduced the
15 bears usually killed each spring in the
Snoqualmie forest to just two. Weyerhau-
ser's entire manpower and feed cost for last
year‘s 200,000acre effort: about $6,000. The
program has been so successful that Wash-
ington’s Department of Wildlife is now con-
sidering some financial support to forest
companies. .

“Politically,” said Vogt, “it is becoming
more and more inappropriate to kill animals
— and many people judge that killing bears
for trees is unacceptable. For the same cost,
I've been able to shift from politically unac-
ceptable solutions to acceptable ones. And
the feeding has turned out to be much more
effective."

Other units in Weyerhauser‘s vast
3,000,000-acre western forest empire are
now beginning to try supplemental feeding.

But not in California.

Despite four years’ experience with
feeding in the Pacific Northwest, not an
ounce of protective feeding has ever been
tried here. “A lot of foresters see bears as
pests,” explained farm adviser Giusti. “If

' you had rats in your house, what would you
say if someone said to put food outside and
feed them there?”

A second ingenious and nonlethal solu-
tion has been proposed, but not tried: Plant
natural food that ripens when the bears are
attacking the trees — in May and June.
Grasses, legumes and forbs such as clover
and dandelion have been suggested.

“There’s a shortage of these plants,"
said Gary Monroe, a wildlife biologist for the
DFG in Eureka. He agrees with many of his
colleagues that these foods could be planted
along the thousands of miles of logging and
access roads, log landings and clearcut ar-
eas.

A problem with that solution is that
timber companies spray most Open land
with herbicides to ensure that the only thing

growing on their property is trees. Biologists
point out that roads and log landings could
be utilized because they’re places where tim-
ber companies aren't likely to grow trees
and use herbicides. " . "

And there are more unanswered ques-
tions about the proposal. What will grow in
the redwood forest? Where can bulk quanti-
ties of native grass seed be purchased? How
much do you plant, and where? "

A legal alternative that has gained sup-

port in other states is to set a minimum .,

dollar amount of damage before landowners
are issued killing permits. In Montana, land-
owners must prove some minimum damage
before they can shoot elk .And Oregon’s
legislature has considered a similar proof-
ofdamage clause by timber companies be-
fore bears can be killed.

Finally, it might make sense simply to

compensate the timber companies for their,

losses —- and let the bears live naturally. A
number of ' states already pay landowners
for wildlife damage rather than issue depre
dation permits. '

r0ponents of California’s .87 billion
forest products industry say they’ve
been trying to find alternatives to

bear killings for years. But they can’t specify -

any.

The timber companies are a little better
at complaining about the dollar value of
their destroyed timber. "Last year,” said
Shep Tucker, a public relations man for
Louisiana-Pacific, “our estimate was about
half a million dollars for bear damages to
young trees.”

That averages out to about a dollar's
worth of damage for every California acre
LP owns. -

“When people think of bears, they think
of Smokey, all cute and nice," said Tucker.
“But they're really big and mean. I’ve seen
rocks on whole hillsides turned over. They

aren‘t warm and cuddly. They knock over
trees. In urban communities most people
never have even seen a bear. They don’t like
us to shoot them —_ yet most of them like
their wood products." , _

Environmentalists say bear damage
must be put into perspective. Insects, they
say, cause an estimated $10 million annual
loss to California forests — 20 times what L-P
says are its bear damages. Fires, wind-
storms, .root rot and floods damage forests
even more. Last year's California fires caus-
ed a loss of 13 billion board feet.

Timber companies don't like it pointed

 

out, however, that last year they still were
able to harvest a record 5 billion board feet
in the state.

Many Californians probably thought
the bear problem was about to be solved
when they read headlines last spring: $135,-
000 to Be Spent Feeding Bears" Actually,
California’s forest products industryhasn’t
spent a dime feeding bears so far. To date,
the research has concentrated on figuring
out what kind of damage bears do and how
much it costs the timber companies it’ll be

The timber industry’s total yearly in-

try $1,338 each for the four companies that
chip in. Four~fifths of the ballyhooed $135,-
000 is actually coming from state and federal
grants, which, over five years, total $107,525.

In the first six months of 1988, by con-
trast, Louisiana-Pacific alone had record
revenues of $888 million.

Some foresters think the damage tim-
ber companies complain about may be over-
stated. Andy Stahl, a forester with the Sierra
Club Legal Defense Fund in Seattle, says
some trees killed by bears may be part of
natural and necessary forest thinning.

“My suspicion,” he said, “is that in most
cases what you‘re seeing is the traditional
' forester’s mentality that a dead tree is bad, a
loss. If you look at the revenues from identi-
cal stands —— one with bear damage, one
without — 50 years later they‘re practically
the same. Foresters don’t often think about
long-term economics; they have a near-term
Outlook." . . I

Orphan Cubs Are Part of Hunt’s Cruelty '

hatever the economics, many biol-

ogists and hunters say this year’s

special hunt is cruel and unselec-
tive.

Unselective because, for the most part,
the wrong bears are being shot. Cruel be
cause a summer hunt will produce more or-
phaned cubs.

Though most of the tree damage seems
to be done by bear sows - females -- 74 per-
cent of North Coast bears shot last year were
males. Furthermore, autopsies of bears shot
around damaged redwoods show that only
five of 15 bears -— 30 percent -— had cambi-
um in their stomachs.

It is likely that many monthsold or-
phaned cubs will die in the forest after hunt-
ers shoot their mothers, believing them to
be cubless. It’s illegal, of course, to shoot
mothers with baby cubs, but a quirk of bear
behavior makes it likely that the 250 sum-
mer hunters won’t notice the cubs until it’s
too late. . .

“In the spring,” said Scott Elrod, who
has hunted California'bears for 37 years,
“the cubs are small and stay with their moth-
er." In July and August, however, bear be-
havior works differently. Then, when faced

with danger, the sow will send her cubslup‘a f

tree away from her, so as to draw off the
danger and hide her cubs

For decades, California's bear hunt '
hasn’t started until the first week in Octo-
ber, when older cubs will behave different-
ly. "In October and later," said Elrod, “99
percent of the time we tree a sow, she's with
her cubs”

Now, however, despite hunters' best ef-
forts to the contrary, biologists fear the ex-
tra-early special hunt'will kill many sows
who’ve hidden their cubs away in an effort
to protect them. “Just about any time you
can find a place that has early hunts, or-
phaned cubs are a problem.” said Tim Bur-
ton, a Department of Fish and Game wildlife
biologist in Siskyou County.

Could cubs orphaned in August or Sep
tember survive?

“Probably a 5-month—old cub has less

. than a 50 pere'“a‘:= ' chance of making it," Bur-

ton said. “Be:

mm The accidentawlﬂogphaning ofcubs could

were to start, like all other California bear

- hunts, in October. Why didn’t the lumber.

companies opt for the later hunt? It has to
do with the mechanized way bears are hunt-
ed in the North Coast.

‘ Gone is the era when alone hunter
stalked a bear with a rifle for days. Today’s
bear hunters almost always are houndsmen,
who run trained packs of dogs across the
backroads. The beSt dogs —- each of which
canbeworth $3,000—cansniffabearu‘ail
12 hours old. '

Lurching along rutted roads in 4x45, of-
ten using night scopes, CB radios and radio-
collared hounds -— illegal in other states -
today’s bear hunter is as efficient a search-
and-destroy machine as has ever patrolled
the California back country. That equip
ment, however, has made necessary the ex-
tra-early special hunt

“Each fall before the rains start, timber
companies have to put erosion controls in,”
explained DFG's Monroe. “After that they

cant have the houndsmen driving down
roads prepared for the winter. They’d tear
up the barriers. So if they're going to hunt
bear with vehicles and dogs, they have to do
it before the rains."

In addition, observers say, it’s far easier

to track and shoot an overheated, poorly fed
bear in August than a cooler, well-nourished
one in October.

{‘The timber companies wanted to begin
the hunteven earlier,” said biologist Pierce.
“We said no, we don’t want to shoot sows
with very young cubs. We’d like to get as far
away from mothers with tiny cubs as possi
ble. The timber companies, on the other
hand, said that spring was when the bears
are most likely to be causing the damage —
and they’d be in the area. That’s when we’re
most likely to kill them. So we compromised
by picking August. We feel that possibly by
then the orphaned cubs might be able to sur-
Vive."

Loss of cubs puts stress on the bear pop-
ulation. Female bears give birth only every
two years, usually just one or two cubs —
and sows don’t come into reproductive age
until they’re 4% years old.

“How long a species that reproduces
painfully slowly can suffer 12 to 20 percent
of its numbers slaughtered each year is any-
body’s guess,” said environmental writer
Marc Reisner in the March 1987 issue of Cali.
fornia magazine.

And guess they will. There has never
been a published paper answering how
dense the bear population is in the redwood
region. ._ 3,8.

These giraffes are part of the breeding program at Busch Gardens. Giraffes are sold

or traded to other zoos.

 

Busch Gardens
helping ensure
animals’ future

By MICHAEL DUNN
Tribune Staff Writer

TAMPA -— As the sun rises
over the Serengeti Plain at Busch
Gardens, giraffes, gazelles and ze—
bras kick the soil and shake off
the morning dew.

In the distance, a flatbed
truck rumbles through the muddy
grass. As it approaches, the ani-
mals’ ears twitch to attention.

Riding on the back of the
truck, Dave Seager slits open a
50-pound grain bag with his pock-
et knife and pours the food into a
hollowed-out log

“You’ll see some of the most
exotic wildlife anywhere on the
face of the earth,” he said, scan-
ning the tall grass for a baby an-
telope.

More than 400 head of African
big game roam this 60-acre grass-
land. Among the most colorful
and treasured of the animals are
the 200’s reticulated giraffes,
brought here from Kenya in 1984.

Busch Gardens has a unique
giraffe breeding program, and
three reticulated giraffes have
been born at the zoo this year.
Zoologists hope to establish a new
gene pool for future captive
breeding, then sell or trade some
of the giraffe offspring to other
U.S. zoos, said 200 operations
manager Gerald S. Lentz.

The reticulated giraffe gene
pool in U.S. zoos has weakened
because of crossbreedlng, which
occurred because so few of the
animals have been imported into
the United States, he said.

Tallest animal

Giraffes are the tallest of all
animals. Adult males can grow up
to lS-feet tall, and at birth a calf
can weigh as much as 100 pounds
and stand 6-feet tall, said Seager,
a zoo attendant.

0f the 12 subspecies of gi-
raffe, the reticulated giraffe is
the best known and is considered
by many to be the most beautiful
because of its chestnut-colored
blotches separated by creamy
white lines.

"Every giraffe has a distinct
pattern, like a person’s finger-
prints,” Seager said. “We take a
picture of them at birth for identi-
fication.”

The giraffe population in Afri-
ca has dwindled drastically in re-
cent years because of human

encroachment, wildlife experts

said. As Kenyans move farther in-
to the wild lands and carve out
farms and ranches, little territory
is left for the giraffes, which have
angered landowners by browsing

through private property and knock-
ing down fences.

“The fact is, the reticulated gi-
raffe is on the brink of extinction,”
Lentz said. ‘

Africans call the giraffe “twiga.”
But the scientific name is “gird/7a
camelopardalis reticulum,” which
translates to “camel with leopards’
spots,” Seager said. Oddly, the gi-
raffe is related to the hippo family,
according to zoologists.

“Glraffes are unique animals,”
Seager said. “They’re not an aggres-
sive animal, unless they have a calf.
A giraffe can kick any leg in any
direction, and if they hit you with
that leg they can kill you.”

The giraffes captured national
media attention when they were
brought to the United States four
years ago. Lentz was part of an ex-
pedition to Kenya that included ac-
tress Stefanie Powers of television’s
“Hart to Hart.”

Lentz worked with Don Hunt,
co-owner of the International Ani-
mal Exchange and the Mount Ke-
nya Game Ranch, to capture the
wild giraffes. Powers is on the
board of directors of the Mount Ke-
nya Game Ranch and has been in-
volved in many wildlife projects
like this one, he said.

The giraffes are native to the
vast, green Laikipia Plateau, 130
miles northwest of Nairobi in Ke-
nya. Capturing them wasn’t easy,
Lentz said.

Because of the animals’ unusual
respiratory system, they could not
be darted with tranquilizers. In-

stead, the game catchers would lo-
cate a herd, select a suitable
giraffe, then separate it from the
herd by chasing it in a Land Cruiser
until it tired and slowed its gait.

The team used a 12-foot wooden
pole tipped with a rope to loop the
giraffe around the neck. The animal
was then given anti-stress medicine
to keep it from thrashing about and
hurting itself, Lentz said.

The giraffes were confined to a
wooden “boma,” or corral, at first
to get them used to people and to
acclimate them to a new diet, Lentz
said. Eventually they were trans-
ported by train to a quarantine sta-
tion on the African coast, where

they were inspected for diseases
and viruses before coming to the
United States.

But the US. Department of Agri-
culture kept the animals quaran-
tined longer than expected, said
Busch Gardens publicity manager
Glenda Gilmore.

Too tall for plane

By the time the animals were
ready to leave Africa, some had
grown too tall for the airplane, Gil-
more said. A World War II CL-44
“Guppy” cargo plane was located in
England, and 17 giraffes were load-
ed into the plane in specially built

wooden crates.

A gaggle of photographers greet-
ed the bewildered giraffes when
they arrived at the Newburgh, N.Y.,

‘ airport in November 1984. As the

plane’s cargo door opened, the gi-
raffes poked their heads out and
looked around as if to say, “Where
the heck am I?”

Kenyan game officials approved
the translocation project, citing the
animals’ apparently dim future on
the Laikipia Plateau.

“It’s a tragic thing to see a sub-
species vanish altogether,” Lentz
said. “Zoos may be the last refuge
for many of these animals. It ap-
pears to be so already for the retic-
ulated giraffe.”

the trees. Because the zoo is so new, l
most of the trees are young and short. ‘
Also, because of the 200’s layout, exv
hibits tend to be hidden among hills,
rocks and buildings, and the animals
themselves often tend to be hidden in
the exhibits, at least on the hot and
humid day when we visited.
The trees and the 103-degree heat

to

index (temperature and humidity) add-
ed up to one feeling: misery. Unlike
such parks as Kings Island or Disney
World, the Indianapolis Zoo has almost .
no man-made shelters against the sun,
other than a small number of buildings
and umbrella tables at eating areas. The
short trees simply aggravate the prob-
lem. Moral: If you think you can go to
the Cincinnati 200 on a warm day,
don’t think you can do the same in Indi-
anapolis. Now that September has ar-
rived, visitors should be assured of a
much more comfortable time.

Miserable weather may have had
something to do with the popularity of
the aquarium at the Waters complex. It
is the first exhibit beyond the education
building and gift shop/visitor accom-
modations center at the entrance. One
of the few inside exhibits, it also had
the longest line of the day. The 40,000-
square-foot aquarium contains the usu-
al assortment of sea life, including
sharks, sea lions, penguins and polar
bears. The polar bears provided the
highlight of the complex, if not the en-
tire visit. At the end of the aquarium
tour, visitors watched through a wall
of glass as the bears cavorted in their
outside tank of water. One of them
might have been a good enough gym-
nast — somersaults and flips off the
glass wall -— to compete in the Olympic
trials.

Not surprisingly, playing in water
seemed to be the favorite pastime for
the animals on this day. One of the next
areas beyond the Waters complex was .
the Forests habitat, which was a re-
markably unpopulated area of Japa-
nese snow monkeys, Siberian tigers
and bald eagles, among other animals.
Actually, the word “tigers” is inaccu-
rate, because only one was visible: Visi-
tors had to peer between obtrusive .

'rocks and lift children over sight-im-

pairing bushes to catch a glimpse of a

 

 




 

tiger that sat up to its neck in a pond. It
should be noted, however, that the de-
s, of the zoo is intended to suit the
lifestyles of the animals. In some cases,
visitors will have to accept a few extra
inconveniences.

More activity could be found in the
African Plains area, which is home to
giraffes, ostriches, zebra, eland and ele-
phants. The elephants played in water

near the visitors and entertained them [

with their antics, but the other animals
seemed to hide from people at the least-
visited end of their spacious area. In
defense of the zoo, the design is sup-
posed to provide both long vistas and
up-close experiences. Whether visitors
will enjoy the animals obviously will
depend on whether they can get close
enough to see them.

The animals also hid in the small
Australian Plains habitat, which fea-
tured wallabies, invisible kangaroos
and a closed walk-through aviary.

More to come

Animals were non-existent in the in-
triguing Deserts building, simply be-
cause the building hasn’t opened yet.

The same is true of the much-touted

 

orld class’ zoo

Whale and Dolphin Pavilion, which is
to open in the late fall. The pavilion,
also part of the Waters complex, prom-
ises to be unique and the best attraction
for the zoo: It will house four false kill-
er whales, four beluga whales and
eight bottlenosed dolphins that will
perform daily programs showing their
intelligence and abilities.

Probably the second best attraction
for the 200 is one that had greater suc-
cess during this visit: the hands-on ex-
periences. Visitors can ride a train, car-
ousel, horses, ponies, camels and
elephants (prices range from $1 to
$1.50). The Encounters area has an out-
door arena, various domestic animals
and a discovery center building with
exhibits and activities that emphasize
the dependence of people on the animal _
world.

Still, this young zoo needs more ma-
turity before it’s ready for most visi-
tors. People who are interested in going ’
should wait until the late fall and at
least call to make sure all attractions
are open before they go. More impor-
tantly, they should go when they know
they can keep as cool as the frolicking
polar bears.

After all, it would mean the
end of trained animals in

Nora, a 6-year-old African elephant, has her broken leg X-rayed at Va. Tech

Pachyderm for a patient

What do you do for an elephant with a broken leg? You bring her to Virginia Tech’s
veterinary hospital to see what can be done to help it, as Bob Johnson of Pet Farm Park in
Heston did earlier this week with 6-year-old Nora. The elephant was put in Johnson’s care in
June after it was confiscated by a Fairfax humane society after possible maltreatment by a
traveling circus. You can’t put a pachyderrn on a table for X-rays, so Nora was photo—
graphed while standing. A chip fracture, believed to be mor than two years old, was found in
Nora’s right rear leg. Surgery to ﬁx the leg and improve Nora’s movement was deemed
useless, so the elephant will be sent to live on a farm near Peterstown, W.Va.

her philosophy to work on a small ranch
in northern California, where she
founded PAWS (the Performing Animal
Welfare Society), a retirement home for
performing animals. It was also turned

, into a shelter for homeless animals, in-
cluding a wolf, a coyote, two leopards,
and a runt African elephant named “71”
that couldn’t keep up with the herd on a
Florida millionaire's ranch.

Derby talks with each of the 15 ani-
mals in a unique, imitative “language,”
pausing to let Harriet the baboon groom
her through the cage bars, and handing
“71” a hose so she can spray herself. She
and partner Ed Stewart keep round-the-
clock watch on the animals in the spa-
cious, clean cages. PAWS is nonproﬁt and
claims nearly 2,500 members.

Strangers driving down the country
road would never guess that behind the
ordinary ranch-style house with a
cracked driveway is a miniature zoo.
Here, in this peaceable kingdom, Derby
plans a strategy for her ﬁght to improve
the lives of exotic animals in California.

Right now she’s optimistic. At the close
of the August California legislative ses-
sion, Democratic state Sen. Dan
' McCorquodale announced he would form
a study group consisting of zoo personnel,
_ federal and state agency ofﬁcials, and
public-interest groups to deal with the
question of exotic-animal care.

This question surfaced at the July 29
hearing int 0 the alieged mistreatment of
Dunda, an African slephant at the San
Diego Zoo’s. Wild Aaimal Park. Derby,
who starred in the public hearing, is
heartened by the public outcry and be-
lieves the incident Eras united animal
rights supporters.

The hearing revealed that in Hebruary,
Dunda, an lSyear-old African elephant,
was disciplined with beatings by her han-
dlers at the Wild Animal Park. Reports of
the beatings -— more than 100 blows to the
head over two days -— sparked investiga-
tions by the San Diego Zoological Society,
the Humane Society of the United States,

Zoo ofﬁcials decided to move Dunda
from the zoo, after 11 years, to the nearby
1,800-acre Wild Animal Park because her
“highly excitable” and “defensive” per-
sonality made her difﬁcult to manage in
the zoo. Following the move, Dunda
lunged at a keeper with enough force to
break a tusk, threatening the safety of
her keepers, until Alan Roocroft, the
park’s elephant training supervisor, de-
cided to discipline her “in a manner that
would get the most effect and cause
Dunda the least harm.”

During the next two days, six trainers
short-chained her legs, brought her to a
kneeling position, and hit her on the head
with hickory sticks (some reports said
keepers used ax handles and elephant
hooks), shouting, “Dunda, no! Dunda, no!”

Zoo ofﬁcials maintain that beatings are
an acceptable form of elephant manage-
ment and offered no apologies for the
incident. Mr. Roocraft defended the ses-
sion, saying keepers struck the elephant’s
head rather than her limbs to avoid per-
manent injury and let the animal see who
was administering the punishment.

Witnesses at the hearing gave varying
views of the severity of the beatings.

_ Roocraft maintained the discipline ses-

sions did only superﬁcial damage to

 

for this bear

Dunda’s head and did not break the skin.
But veterinary reports from the San
Diego Humane Society investigation de—
scribe “excessive skin breakage” and con-
clude “the discipline went too far.”

Jeﬁ Jouett, publicist for the Zoological
Society of San Diego, the private corpora-
tion operating the zoo and park, says

4 elephants are accustomed to a group hier-

archy. “Elephants look to the keeper, ask-
ing who’s in charge. They may challenge
the control, but basically they want a
leader.” Beating is an apprOpriate disci-
pline for elephants, he adds, because herd
members hit each other. “After all, how
much damage can a lBO-pounrl human do
to a four-ton animal?” On the « ather hand,
elephants’ great size endanger strainers,
so “keepers must dominate."

Derby disagrees. “’Il'ainers iay that
unless you dominate the elepl ant it will
kill you. But it’s the trainers v ’ho make a
killer elephant by keeping the animal
fearful and dependent.”

The hearing ended without igreement.
But after the Dunda incident, the San
Diego Zoological Society announced that
in the future, Roocraft may recommend
elephant discipline but a zoo veterinarian
and a curator will make the decision.

Derby’s appearance at the Dunda hear-
ing angered and disappointed some zoo

personnel who remembered when she
rode her elephant, Neena, through the

‘ ceremonial opening ribbon at the Wild

Animal Park in 1972 and later gave talks
about her animals to zoo visitors.

“They wanted me to tell of the good
times,” Derby says. “But I have to speak
about what is happening now.

“Most people don’t include zoos in the
category of animal training, ” Derby says.
“But the San Diego Zoo trains animals for
on-site shows and offers animal rides.”

Mr. Jouett says the 200’s performing
animals “are trained to show their natu-
ral behavior. For example, an otter will
walk through a tube resembling a hollow
log, demonstrating its natural agility, or
an owl will ﬂy silently in circles.”

“There’s no training without some neg-
ative reinforcement,” says Derby. “'Ib get
an animal to perform on cue requires
cruelty. A dog doesn’t willingly jump
through a hoop. A bear doesn’t want to
waltz.” She has not been a sideline specta—
tor in the animal world. “I’ve personally
done everything I’m criticizing. I’ve
learned by doing wrong things.”

While working for animal trainers in
Hollywood, she watched in horror as they
eleCtroshocked elephants in the vagina,
anus, ear, or mouth; or broke the noses
and burned the feet of bears to establish
dominance. She began to ask questions:
“Do we have the right to hurt an animal
that depends on us?”

Her colleagues told her to get tough or
get out. Her marriage to animal trainer
Ted Derb ended after a ﬁnal argument
over his 2.4: .sistence on using an electric
cattle pr( .1 in training.

In 197 2%, Derby published “The Lady

_ and her 'l'iger,” exposing the inside world

of performing-animal training. In 1985,
she fougl for passage of a California law-
to improx- the regulation and inspection
of exotic-animal compounds statewide.

“I’ve been called anthropomorphic, a
bleeding heart, and a victim of the Bambi
syndrome for raising questions about ani—
mal treatment, but it hasn’t quieted me,”
Derby says in a well—modulated voice.

“Animals can’t speak for themselves.
People have to speak for them.”

ZOO ATLANTA’S SWINGERS

 

Orangutans
Try Out Home
In New Exhibit

By Jack Warner
Sinﬂ Writer

There he sat, the red-headed
stranger, idly scratching his nose in
a patch of weeds and observing mo-
rosely the knot of people gathering
at the foot of the hill.

“That’s one yonder!” trumpeted
an elderly man, tugging his wife
with one hand and pointing urgent-
ly up the hill with the other.

With that, the orangutan named
JinJing heaved himself more or less
erect and shambled slowly out of
sight to resume the close relation-
ship he has developed with a big
red ladder at Zoo Atlanta.

In its second extravaganza of
great apes this year, the zoo Satur-
day officially opens the exhibit
called The Orangutans of Ketambe,
a companion piece to the popular
Ford African Rain Forest gorilla
habitat around the corner.

Friday, the first nine orang-
utans, most of them on loan from
the Yerkes Regional Primate Cen-
ter, were trying out their new habi-
tat — rather gingerly, since few
have ever felt dirt under their long
toes before.

There are three separate half-
acre compounds, each to eventually
hold a group of four apes. They dif-
fer from the habitats of the cele-
brated gorilla Willie B. and his com-
panions chiefly in the huge three-
inch ropes strung like vines from
dead, girder-braced trees. Orang-
utans, unlike gorillas, are in nature
largely arboreal —- they prefer to
stay in the trees. Nor do they live in
family groups, although the groups
at the zoo get along well.

They are also endangered; natu-
ralists say less than 5,000 are be-
lieved to live in the jungles of Bor-
neo and Sumatra. Ketambe, for
which the exhibit is named, is a na-
tional forest in Sumatra.

On Friday, the only female to
put in an appearance was Biji, who
gets around wonderfully well for a
mother with a 35-pound, 4-year-old
baby who won’t get off her back.

The child, Janji, was too terri-
fied of its new surroundings to stop
clinging to Biji, dangling upside
down from her stomach or clinging
to her back. Despite her obvious an-
noyance, Biji didn’t peel the child
off, but neither did she let it hinder
her exploration of virtually every
area of the compound, which in-
cludes a little artificial stream and
waterfall.

There was a moment of fear
when she wrapped her prehensile
lip around a lightly charged electri-
cal wire intended to discourage the

Zoos move to cage humans

 

By Kiley Armstrong
The Associated Press

 

NEW YORK -— American zoos
increasingly are becoming a
place where cooped-up humans
view free-roaming beasts, and
many institutions are uniting to
save endangered species and re-
turn them to the wilderness.

“Animals aren’t in cages any
more. They’re in spacious enclo-
sures, in a much more esthetical-
1y pleasing environment,” said
Charles H. Hoessle, director of
the St. Louis Zoo. “Modern ex-
hibits are being designed to ca-
ter to their behavioral needs.”

The trend is evident at the
new Central Park Zoo, where
wilderness has been duplicated
in the heart of the city. The re-

zoos are finding ways to keep
their animals entertained.

“It’s quite common in ape ex-
hibits to put sunflower seeds on
the floor so animals have some-
thing to do to keep them occu-
pied, or artificial termite
mounds with honey or mus-
tard,” said Marvin Jones, regis-
trar of the San Diego Zoo. “It’s a
way of easing their boredom.”

Busch Gardens in Tampa, Fla.,
was a trend-setter in 1965, en-
closing visitors on a monorail
while the gazelles and zebras
frolicked unfettered on 60 acres.
In the early 1970s, drive-through
parks proliferated.

Since then, realistic settings
have multiplied. In 1987, the zoo
association’s 132 members spent
nearly $500 million building or
renovating exhibits, Wagner

said. “American zoos are in their
heyday,” he said.

“The public has changed, due
to television primarily. People
are able to see how animals live
in the wild” and expect no less
from zoos, Jones said.

The Bronx Zoo’s Jungle World,
a 37,000-square-foot, indoor mi-
crocosm opened in 1985” boasts
five waterfalls, a cloud machine,
100 species of tropical plants and ,
780 animals, including endan-
gered Bali mynah birds.

In St. Louis, schoolchildren
and scholars can study ecology ‘

Robert Wagner, executive di- j
rector of the American Associ-‘i

Aquariums, which grants accre-
ditation, said the new Central
Park Zoo “clearly depicts the lat-
est state of the art.”

Experts at the zoo let the ani-

week when you all should
have been reporters and you all
should have been with me. That
morning, the Dallas Zoo put on a
preview of its Wilds of Africa ex-
hibit, and the Dallas Museum of
Art previewed the Georgia
O’Keeffe show for the local
press.

Wilds of Africa —— 55 acres of
natural setting, just north of the
zoo — won’t open for a year, but
the monorail is in place, and
most of the barns and other in—

route through the treetops; so
was MayOr Pro'Tem John Evans

and so were several members
and former members of the park

the seniors. We’re having to cut
things for people who don’t have
f anywhere else to go.”

For people who care enough to
give big chunks of their lives to
public service, it’s painful and
- depressing to have to go through
' the kind of hacking and slashing
they’ve all got to do now.

_ For that very reason, and in

that very context, something like

the opening of the Wilds of Afri—
ca Exhibit is a moment of dearly
:- priced joy and hope.

‘ They are all convinced that,
the moment it opens in the fall
of 1989, Wilds of Africa will be-
come the No. 1 place in Dallas to

take your out-of—town guests,
your conventioneers, your tour—
ists, your everybody. _

Trudging up through the con-
struction dust toward the embar-
kation point, park board member
Ruthmary White said: “If you
want your kids to be educated
about animals, you’ll bring them
here.”

I think she’s right. It’s going to
be spectacular, and we are all go-
ing to brag and brag about it.
Now when we go to other peo-
ple’s cities, we can sniff and say,
“Well, yes. You do have a nice
little zoo. Of course, we’re
spoiled.”

Compared to the Wilds of Afri-
ca preview, the O’Keeffe opening

hope for Dallas’ future ‘

was extremely non—sweaty and
finger~foodesque, as it should
have been. It was smoothly done.
Rick Brettell, the museum’s new
director, is suave and ﬁrst-rate at
handling this kind of event.

The sense I had at the end of
the day was that we really did
accomplish some things during
the period of The Big Boom —-
some things other than savings
and loan failures —— and that
thoSe good and lasting accom-
plishments are going to be our
ﬁrst leg up when we ﬁnally get
out of this soup we’re in now.

Maybe we’ve gone two steps
back in. the last couple years. But
we went three steps forward be-

fore.

DENVER POST - August 3, 1988

Zoo’s neighbors fear loss e

of park space to exhibits

By Bill Briggs
Denver Post Staff Writer

City Park area residents turned
out in force Tuesday to vent their
concerns over two proposed Den-
ver Zoo exhibits which some said
could have a bad impact on al~
ready shrinking green space.

.As many as 200 people listened
at East High School as zoo officials
detailed the “Primate Panorama”
and “Tropical Discovery” projects
and tried to sell residents on a new
shuttle system designed to curb
parking and traffic problems.

The meeting, convened by the
Denver Board of Parks and Recre-
ation, was the first public hearing
aimed at helping to protect urban
green space.

Zoo consultant Floyd Ciruli said
the shuttle, which has been carry-
ing people from off-site lots to the
zoo for two weeks, will help reduce
traffic to the facility and ultimate-
j 1y cut the need to pave more

 

parking areas in City Park.

About 20 park area residents lat-

er presented their views. Nearly
all those who stepped to the podi-
um said they favored the new ex-
hibits, but they said they were
nonetheless worried about what
expanding the zoo will do to the
park. .
“The tvio projects can do noth-
ing but enhance the park and zoo.
Our responsibility as citizens is to
work with the park and the zoo. To
hinder the projects would be detri-
mental to everything,” said Myrtle
Rose Green. .

“Sometimes we have to trust
somebody, and now’s the time to
do it. Now is the time to have our
arms around each other and have
mutual trust and go for it,” added
zoo tour guide Joe Ridgeway.

But others were less enthusiastic
about the proposed exhibits.

“The park has been my sanctu-
ary and my retreat. I’m very con-

No offspring for Ling-Ling

The National Zoo in Washington
is ending its “panda watch,” saying
the female giant panda Ling-Ling
experienced a false pregnancy.
The aging panda has given birth to
four cubs, but none has lived. Zoo
oflicials’ hopes were raised last
week when Ling-Ling showed hor-
monal and behavioral changes in-
dicative of pregnancy. “We all had
high hopes that a birth would occur

TIMES - September 6, 1988

The New York Times; Raymond Bonner

George Adamson, who has been fighting the poaching of elephants by
international traders, at the Kora National Reserve in Kenya.

Besieged EIephants Find Ally

By JANE PERLEZ
Special to The New York Times

KORA ROCK, Kenya — This is
George Adamson country, five miles
south of the Equator, a harsh region
blanketed with sandy soil and prickly
gray thorn bushes and populated by
wild game and Somali nomads.

It is from here, in the isolation of
eight thatched huts, that Mr. Adam-
son, who with his wife, Joy, created
the legend of Elsa, the lion of “Born
Free,” has spent the last 18 years
roaming over the 580 square miles of
the Kora National Reserve.

After separating from his wife, who
was stabbed to death years later, in
1980, by a herdsman, Mr. Adamson
set up camp to nurture young lions,
return them to the wild and then re-
main their friend. The name of his
base is Kampi Ya Simba, Swahilifor
Camp of the Lion.

But it is not only lions that Mr.
Adamson is concerned with these
days. _

At 82, his sun-cured skin the color of

rich mahogany, a mane of yellow-
white hair reaching for his shoulders,
Mr. Adamson has found a new and
compelling cause: a campaign
against the poaching of elephants,
valued for their ivory by interna-
tional traders.

“They’ve killed all the rhinoceros
and now they’re onto the elephants,”
Mr. Adamson said as he sat, in his
characteristic green shorts and san-
dals, over early morning tea in the
but that serves as a mess and a feed-
ing place for his favorite ravens,
Mad, Bad and Worse, assorted mon-
keys, several starlings and a goat.
The morning before, he had found a
hunk of fresh elephant meat on a
track near his camp, clear evidence
that yet another elephant had been
shot.

Along with a number of other con-
servationists, Mr. Adamson worries

Continued on Page A14, Column 4

 

 




 

 

AIIy for Kenya ’s Besieged Elephants

 

Continued From Page Al

that the elephant, once so numerous
all over Kenya, will survive in only a
few pockets of the country. A fierce
critic of what he calls the Kenyan
Government’s lax attitude to poach-
ers, Mr. Adamson is particularly
upset that elephants are killed for
their ivory in the reserve around his
camp where the animals are sup-
posed to be protected.

' Numbers Are Disputed

Exactly how many elephants are
left in Kenya is a subject of hot dis-
pute between the Kenyan Govern-
ment and the conservationists. About
22,000 elephants still roam the plains,
the Government says. The East Af-
rican Wildlife Society says it is prob-
able that poaching has reduced the
herds to 6,000. The society’s chair-
man, Richard Leakey, asserted last
week that senior government officials
were involved in the poaching.

WhateVer the number of elephants,
the murder of three rangers in the
Kora Reserve by poachers has
spurred the Government to say it will
take more concerted action.

“The Government is increasing the
manpower, training and equipment
available to rangers,” the, Minister
for Tourism and Wildlife, George
Muhoho, said after the murders. In

the last four months, he added, 92 ele- '

phants have been shot by poachers in
Kenya’s national parks and reserves.

Somali tribesmen, the suspects in
the three murders, hunt the elephants
in Kora. “They’ve got automatic
weapons —— Russian and British —
and anything else they can get their
hands on,” Mr. Adamson said. “The
rangers are supposed to go after
them with World War 1 British
rifles.” '

Further, he and others say, the
rangers’ salaries are so poor that
they are easily susceptible to bribes
' paid by the poachers to ignore the
killing.

After a day of fruitless searching
for the elephant that he knew had just
been shot — Mr. Adamson believes it
is vital to find the carcasses so the
slaughters can be reported -— be dis-
patched a visiting pilot, David Allen,
to look. for vultures from the air.

Not far from the airstrip, Mr. Allen
spotted circling birds. Back on the
ground, a half-mile drive from the
plane, were two freshly killed ele-
phants slumped in the thorn trees.
They had been killed in the last 48

'

hours. Their heads were hacked off;
they lay in pools of blood. _,

The mother elephant, about 25
years old, had been shot in the side
and then, as it staggered forward,
shot again in the back, Mr. Allen said.
The 5-year-old baby met a 'similar
fate.

“They’re shooting anything with
any kind of ivory,” said an agitated

Mr. Allen, a former game warden,

hunter and now a bush pilot. The two
elephants had very little ivory, he
said.

Pessimistic Over Campaign

Mr. Adamson believes that his
presence in the reserve serves as a
protection, however small, for the ele-
phants. The Somalis know and the
Government knows, Mr. Adamson
said, that he will do all he can to re-
port the poaching and track the kill—

ers. But despite the Government’s
statements, his is probably a losing
battle, he said.

Mr. Allen agreed. “The Govern-
ment wants George out of here,” he
said. “They don’t want anyone
around so the poachers can work
more freely. I don’t think any interna-
tional wildlife organization should
give this Government a cent until it
commits to a policy that it professes
against poaching.” .

For visitors landing at the gravel
airstrip in the stark and forbidding
wilderness here, the first sign of life
is nailed to a bare tree. ”Lions on
road,” the notice says. “Buzz camp,
wait at strip until picked up. Kampi
Ya Simba.” ' '

A second message stood out the
other day under the white midday sun
that accentuated the bleached bone

hue of the earth: “Gone to look for
poached elephant. Help selves to gin.
Back for lunch.”

As protection against animals, Mr.
Allen dragged wooden boxes from the
thin shade of a tree and fitted them
over the wheels of his small plane:
“They’ve had lions come along and
eat the tires.”

While Mr. Adamson fumes about
the plight of the elephant, he recently
received some better tidings.

A month ago, he was presented
with three lion cubs, his first batch ‘
since eight years ago when the Ken-
yan Government, concerned after a ’
lion killed one of his assistants, for-
bade him from receiving any more.
But in Mr. Adamson’s twilight years
the Government has relented.

“A farmer was granted permisson
from the Department of Wildlife to
give the orphaned cubs to Mr. Adam-
son and with the help of his assistants
he has been been bottle feeding them
milk and coaxing them onto small
slivers of meat.

80 the process of returning lions to
the wild that Mr. Adamson and his
wife pioneered in the 1950’s has
started again. A 12-year-old lioness,
called Growe, born near the camp
and a continuing friend of Mr. Adam—
son, came back to the enclosure to
sniff out the cubs.

As Mr. Adamson and his visitors
sat in the early dark, sipping before-
dinner whisky from glasses set on a
silver tray, a deep growl shattered -
the peace. To the alarm of the visi-
tors, the lioness charged the enclo-
sure protecting the cubs. “1 think
Growe wants to take possession,” Mr.
Adamson said calmly.

But he would wait until the cubs
were four months old and active
enough to keep up with the lioness be-
fore freeing them to her, he said.

In the meantime, Mr. Adamson
kept up his good terms with Growe.
With a spotlight in one hand and a
slab of camel meat in the other, he
stepped outside the safety of the
camp enclosure and approached the
lion. “Growe, Growe, come on
Growe,” he said ever so softly.

The distance between Mr. Adam—

.son and Growe was no more than a

foot as the lioness grabbed the meat
Mr. Adamson placed on a rock next to
him and then bounded back into the
dark.

“You get to know them,” saiu Mr.
Adamson of the more than 30 lions he
has befriended and taken on walks
like so many children. “Some 1 can
trust absolutely, others I have to keep
a lookout for.”

“Because we don’t want

of a hill very close to adapted trailers
that hold Koko, the elder gorilla, and

and trailers stretches a large apple or-

I penetrated the leafy hideaway, ap-

and a cidery smell ﬁlled the air. A black-

of the house, barking, to be followed
by a Manx cat and, at a distance, an
inquisitive kitten. Penny Patterson, a
striking young woman with long, ﬂow-

Penny, Ron, Koko, and
Michael. We peered into
Koko’s quarters ﬁrst, and
she peered out at me, the
stranger, and made signs

Penny, who replied to
them as fast as they came.
Koko sat behind the chain
links that divided us with
the dignity that goes with
weight (she was about 250
pounds), but there was
nothing else digniﬁed about
her. She was eager. She
opened her mouth wide,
ﬁxed her dark eyes on my
face, and stuck one ﬁnger
behind her upper teeth in
an urgent way. Penny ex-
plained: “She wants to see

and Koko scanned the exposed area
with rapt attention. So did Penny, who
reported to Koko, ﬁngers ﬂying, “Yes,

I was sorry not to oblige, but I was
able to answer Koko’s urgent question
as to what I had in my bag. (“She calls
it a ﬂower bag,” said Penny, puzzled.
“I think somebody brOught her ﬂow—

sight of which Koko immediately asked

EVE & THE APES

I said I had something else in my
tote bag, a roll of Gelusil which I
didn’t want because it tended to cause
constipation.

“That would be good for her,” a new
voice said from behind us; it was Ron.
“She could do with something like that.
Do you mind letting me have it? I’ll
give it to her.” He had an opening in
the chain link fence at the corner of
the veranda.

Koko went over there to collect her
candy, while Penny watched with a
certain anxiety, and said, “I think she
has an earache, but she hasn’t said so.
She keeps putting her hand up there.”

“Eardrops?” I suggested.

“I suppose so,” she said reluctantly.
“We’ve done it before, but it’s always
a struggle. Ron, do you think it’s warm
enough for her to go out into the yard?”

If she wore her jacket and stayed in
the sun, said Ron.

“What on earth is she doing?” I in-
terrupted. Koko was advancing men-
acingly toward me, waving something
long and thin.

Penny said, “Oh, that’s her croco-
dile. Koko’s afraid of crocodiles, I don’t
know why, because she’s never seen
a real one. She threatens us with that,
too, all the time. It’s a game.”

Koko brandished her crocodile, and
I recoiled as if in terror. She loved that
game and repeated it several times.

“Funny, isn’t she?” said Penny.
“She’s got a new terrorizer as well;
one of the girls has brought her a
dinosaur.”

Koko went back to watch out of the
chain links and viewed with some dis-
favor the antics of a kitten that had
followed us up on the stoop and was
now wrestling with my handbag. It was
Koko’s kitten, said Penny, and she
seemed to think of it as a nuisance
sometimes. She was now in a better
light, and I exclaimed at the smallness
of her feet. Gorilla feet, like their
hands, are noticeably unlike ours, being
stubby, with the big toe not aligned
next to its neighbors, but down to the
side, more convenient for gripping.
Koko’s feet were almost petite.

“I know,” said Penny. “We take the
same size in shoes.”

Ron was inside the room now, help-
ing Koko into her red jacket — a pres-
ent from one of the volunteers. Since
it had to be large to accommodate Ko—
ko’s chest and arms, it was oddly
shaped, but it did ﬁt her. She played

with one side of the zipper track, run-
ning it up and down without closing it.
She went out into the play yard, which
was fenced and ﬁlled with hanging tires
and other playground equipment, while
we moved around and kept her in view.
Penny told her to come over and sit
on a stool in the sun. Koko looked
about at the trees, the apples on the

gorilla; you wouldn’t want to
tangle with him!”

ground and the dog. Penny said, “This
climate’s not really the best for the
gorillas. We’re going to move if we can
manage it. It isn’t only the damp. This
place is built almost directly on the San
Andreas fault, and you can’t help
thinking about quakes. If we had a bad
one, what would happen to the goril-
las? We’ve thought of other places; the
most appealing is on Maui in Hawaii ——
do you know that island? A lovely cli-
mate, and the authorities are friendly;
we’ve been offered a lot of acreage.
But we’d have to put in electricity and
water, and it would cost thousands.
We’re trying to ﬁgure a way, but so far
it’s just a dream.”

Koko kept her eyes ﬁxed on us.
Now she broke out into ﬁnger con-
versation. “She wants to play a game
with you,” said Penny. “She wants you
to run.”

“Me? I can’t, Koko,” I said. “I’m
too old.”

Inﬂexible, Koko repeated her de—
mand. Feeling foolish, I obeyed by
running up and down in front of the cage
while Koko watched approvingly.

“There now, wasn’t that nice,
Koko?” said Penny.

Koko ignored her. Taking off her
jacket, she moved into .the shade.

“No, get back into the sun,” said
Penny. “Oh, very well, you’ll have to
go back into the house. Ron?”

As Koko was removed, Michael was
brought in for his turn in the yard,
which he shared. I exclaimed at his
beauty. At eleven he had not yet de-
veloped the heavy—looking muscle that

characterizes full-size male gorillas, but
his hair was beginning to show the
white ends that would make him what
is called a silverback. Even so he
looked beautifully muscular, with a face
like an Egyptian mask carved in obsid-
ian. He stood as if posing, staring into
the trees where the dog moved around
among fallen apples.

“They call him the Tom Selleck of
gorillas,” said Penny, smiling. . . . But
what interested me more was the in—
formation that Koko is learning to read.
Penny explained: The only way in
which Koko exceeds a human child in
development is in her visual discrimi-
nation, which is excellent. For exam—
ple, take the difference in a printed
word such as “cat” and its neighbor
“cot.” Koko would spot that immedi-
ately, and such things are beginning to
interest her.

“If there’s an insignia on your dress
or on a book, or a little thing like that,
she can pick it out. She must have
pretty good vision to do that. In fact,
she’ll notice that somebody’s insignia
is a bird and tell you so. She’s really
good at that game What’s Wrong with
This Picture. . . . She can ﬁnd the lit-
tle wrong things really well. I would
think it’s quite an adaptive talent, what
with having to ﬁnd the appropriate
things to eat, that sort of thing, and
maybe for social relations as well, be-
cause facial expression is really im-
portant for them. Watching her, even
I can see how her expression varies
between a dark, hostile facial conﬁg—
uration all the way to a happy expres—
sion, through all the gradations. And
because gorilla faces are so dark, it
might take more skill to judge their
expressions. It would be very impor-
tant to steer clear of an angry gorilla;
you wouldn’t want to tangle with him!
They can pick up instantly on people,
and this must be absolutely visual; it
can’t be smell because they are so often
behind glass windows. They make
judgments as to whether they’re going
to relate; it’s got to be visual. Quicker
than I’could possibly do it; I can’t judge
a person in that amount of time. But
they both do it, and most of the time
they stick with it. Sometimes there are
exceptions, but most of the time that’s
it. So the reading part is natural, I
think. At ﬁrst people will think no, it
can’t be, but why not when they’re so
quick at visual discrimination? Quite

EVE 8: THE APES

(FROM PAGE 28)

early in the reading thing when we
were just playing around, Ron —— he’s
really funny, likes to joke -— well, he
would take Koko’s words and spell
them wrong, make hard spelling er—
rors like ‘banama,’ and she would catch
it; he’d ask her what was wrong with
this word, and she’d ﬁnd it. And I said
maybe we’d better give her a little
substitution test and see if she could
put the correct letter in there, and she
would do that, too. Some of her teach—
ers have tried to get her to write a
word, and she’d get two letters of
‘frog,’ for instance; they were kind of
crooked but the R was pretty darned
good. . . .

“Hearing is very important to her.
She does a lot of her inventions based
on the sound of words — ‘obnoxious,’
for instance, and ‘You blew it.’ There
are no signs for these phrases in sign
language, but we say them all the time,
verbally. ‘You blew it, Koko.’ ” Penny
laughed. “So she’s changed it into
something incredible. When we say it,
she jumps and waves her arms and
blows so hard her hair ﬂies —— ‘You
blew it.’ And the ‘obnoxious’ reaction
is a violent kind of knock.” Penny
knocked hard on her chair. “We didn’t
know what it was for a while. The part
of ‘obnoxious,’ ‘knock,’ is the only part
she can say. . . . .

“It’s too bad to have only two ani-
mals. Of course, we hope for more,
babies, if possible, and if we could
move to a nice climate like Hawaii, we
could perhaps get others on loan.

‘ ‘ UT THAT’S not all. The
things you have to think of

in a project like this! You
have to be in a politically stable place,
you have to have access to volunteers
—— schools mostly —-— a good climate.
. . . There are so many restrictions I
wonder if we’re ever going to ﬁnd the
right spot. That place we were offered
on Maui is just beautiful. It has a pop-
ulation of —— what, Ron?” “Three
thousand.”

They talked wistfully of the 680
acres in Hawaii. You could develop a
wild animal park, said Ron. “But it’s
the water and the electricity.”

For some time we-discussed ways
and means. PR all over the States? A
motto in Honolulu: “Bring the gorillas
to Hawaii”? Pictures of Koko distrib-
uted to schoolchildren?

“It all came about in Hawaii because

we had an exhibition there of the go-
rillas’ art,” Penny said. She brought out
a number of photographs to show. “Oh,
yes, they like to paint once in a while,
Michael more than Koko. . ”

They were not, as I had expected,
like paintings made by chimpanzees,
with which I was familiar — but why
should I have expected them to be like
that? I shouldn’t have been so racist.
Koko’s pictures were not like Mi-
chael’s, for that matter. They use acrylic
paint and have a free choice of color.

“But — why, they’re representa-
tional, some of them,” I said when I
looked at Michael’s efforts. Penny and
Ron nodded, surprised by my surprise.

Penny said, “Here’s a representa-
tion of the dog Apple that you saw.” It
was nearly a good portrait, nearly the
conventional picture of the dog’s face.

“And they name their pictures,” said
Ron proudly. “He named this one Ap-
ple Chase.”

Penny added, “Koko names all our
animals, really strange names, some
of them. Here’s a self-portrait of Mi-
chael. Here’s a portrait of me. This is
Koko’s picture of a bird; if you look
carefully, you can see a bluebird there.
They did a whole lot of these for the
art exhibit in San Francisco, and one
of the critics said the only good things
in the show were by the gorillas. . . . I
wish now I hadn’t sold so many of their
best ones, but of course, we needed the
money. I asked Koko to do these two,
Love and Hate. You see, Hate is dirty
brown, but Love is pink and orange.”

“Look at this one,” said Ron.

“That’s Cat Trouble,” said Penny,
laughing. '

“Naming the pictures themselves,”
said Ron, “adds another dimension.
The really remarkable thing about all
this is the naming. A month or two ago
we had an earthquake, a pretty big one,
and next day we asked the gorillas to
paint it. Michael used a very dark
brown.” '

Penny said, “Here’s one by‘ Mi—
chael,.and it’s supposed to be blocks.
I think he must be very disturbed about
Love, because, look, it’s all in blocks.
Koko wasn’t being terribly coopera—
tive then.”

“Do they use their ﬁngers?”

“Oh, no,” said Penny. “Brushes.
Michael sometimes uses leather, balls,
anything that will carry the color. He
has always been good; he tried rep-
resentational drawings, like the tree

outside his window, when he was very
young. Koko tends to do the drawing
where it is — that is, if I give her a
sheet of paper with some of my writ-
ing on it, she draws or paints over the
writing. If I’ve made a list like a col—
umn, she draws a column, too. Here’s
one Michael did, trying to get a picture
of the toy dinosaur.” We talked a little
about the dinosaur and Koko’s trying
to frighten people with it. “The thing
is, she’s such a silly.” Penny laughed.
“She does silly things, and you hear
her laughing at herself. She’s such a
character.”

graphs in one of the magazines:

Penny had put on a grinning mask,
and Koko was grinning in imitation,
pointing to her own exposed teeth.

“She thought I had gone crazy,” said
Penny fondly.“Gorillas have this funny
chuckle, like this.” She made a chufﬁng
noise. “When she tickles my feet,
Koko chuckles. Of course, I have to
yell. She even chuckles sometimes
when we crack a verbal joke. I think
it grows from the contentment sound,
you know that rumbling kind of purr?
That grades into the laugh and then in
the hysterical, uncontrollable laughter
they do sometimes. When they’re
happy, they make that sound. She uses
it sometimes to sing along. We have a
music teacher who comes in, and Koko
will make these vocalizations and go
along with the teacher, humming and
purring and sometimes matching the
intonation. She does have a reasona-
ble amount of control over her vocal—
ization. Both of them have a funny
sort of puff, a yes or no in their own
language.”

“Isn’t there a kind of cough, too, in
warning?” I asked.

“Oh, for sure,” said Penny. “I call it
a bark.” She brought out some more
photographs. “Here’s Koko a day old,
with her mother. Jackie died last year
of valley fever. They look alike, don’t
they? Koko has a half brother at the
zoo; you might go and look at him,
and her father. She’s got a full brother
who looks very much like her; his
name’s Kubi. . . .”

Lately Penny and Ron have been
stepping up their publicity about Ha-
waii, with good results. It is possible,
really possible, that they and the go—
rillas can make it one of these days to
that island in the Paciﬁc. [l

The renovated 5.5-acre
Central Park 200
includes three major
climatic zones — tropic,
polar, and temperate; at
Monday’s opening,
children and animals
were all in wonderment
at the new, splendid
surroundings

 




By Bunny McBride
Special to
The Christian Science Murmur

New York
A human being known
as Mayor Ed Koch stood
poolside, pulled back his
shirt sleeves, and gingerly
picked up a mackerel by
the tail. A sea lion named
Finn saluted the onlookers
surrounding the pool,
dived from his rock island,
and swam toward the
mayor. Then the mayor
tossed, the sea lion
caught, and the crowd
cheered — all celebrating
the reopening of New
York’s dramatically trans-
formed Central Park Zoo.
In a joint effort by the
New York Zoological Soci-
ety (NYZS) and the City of
New York, the old zoo,
which once conﬁned big
animals in small dreary
cages, has been largely
razed and rebuilt. The $37
million renovation is
clearly an effort toward
animal conservation as
much as human pleasure.
The 5.5-acre zoo, which
opened Monday, now pro-
vides roomy, naturalistic
habitats for smaller ani-
mals, as well as enchant-
ing gardens and other
amenities for people.
Managed by the city for
more than a century, the
zoo is now operated by the
Zoological Society, which
oversees the famous
Bronx Zoo and is known
for its pioneering work in
animal conservation, re—
search, and display. New
York City parks commis-
sioner Henry Stern, who
calls himself “a man for
all species,” admits that
the society “can do a bet-
ter job than we can. We
will continue to own the
land and the buildings, but
they’ll be in charge of the
animals. It’s a marriage.”
The “marriage” con-
tract was drafted in 1980
by William Conway, gen-
eral director of the NYZS,
and Gordon Davis, parks
commissioner from 1978
to ’83. For animal lovers
who criticized the zoo for

 

years, it was a long-
awaited solution to the
zoo’s sad conditions.

There were no critics in
sight on opening day. The
atmosphere was one of
sheer delight and mutual
curiosity as the animals
and. 14,000 New Yorkers
caught their ﬁrst glimpses
of each other.

The 200’s 450 animals,
representing 110 species,
live in indoor and outdoor
exhibits divided into three
climatic zones - the Tropic
Zone, the Polar Circle, and
the Temperate Territory.

The Tropic Zone, ren- _
tirely indoors, matches
New York’s steamy sum-
mer weather. Fairy blue-
birds and Peking robins
ﬂit about freely in the
richly planted aviary, at
the core of the two-story
building. Several habitat
displays encircle the avi—
ary. In one, colobus mon-
keys swing recklessly
from limb to limb. In an-
other, a long-nosed tree
snake slithers around a
trunk. Big fruit bats ﬂut-
ter among the vines and
ferns of their shadowy
habitat, while in the ant
nest exhibit, 100,000
cutter ants dash about
their daily business with
the fervor of a rush-hour
subway crowd.

The greatest people
pleaser on opening day
was the Polar Circle’s in-
door penguin exhibit,
which simulates the stark,
glacial terrain of Antarc-
tica. The temperature is

' set at a brisk 35 degrees

F., and visitors View the
cool scene through a glass
panel that enables them to
watch these playful birds
waddle atop the rocky
landscape, or glide to and
fro underwater.

“He kissed me!” .
squealed a little girl whose

» nose was pressed to the

glass when a penguin
bumped it with his beak.
“Are you sure they’re
not seals?” asked a young
boy, who looked highly
doubtful when his father
told him that penguins

were birds.

. The polar bears are
also featured in the circle
and are by far the largest
animals in the zoo. Their
territory is outside, con-
sising of mountainous
heaps of simulated rocks
and water pools that are
kept. at 65 degrees F. Visi-
tors can climb about the
habitat’s perimeter,
watching from various
levels as the bears lumber
over the rocks or leap into
the cool pools.

Zoo designers faced
some tricky technical
challenges: devising
heated rocks for the frogs
and complex climate con-
trol and ﬁltering systems
for the penguins; creating
an escape-proof ant dis-
play, as well as simulated
rocks that wouldn’t wreak
havoc on penguin feet.

According to the 200’s
animal curator, Jim Mur-
taugh, the animals have
adjusted quickly to their
new homes. The penguins
seemed especially thrilled
to reach the zoo. After be-
ing harvested as eggs on
the Falkland and Nelson
Islands, incubated and
hatched at Sea World in
San Diego, then transport-
ed by truck and plane in
an ice-ﬁlled elephant
crate, all 39 were hand-
carried into their new
habitat. “They went ba-
nanas with delight,” said
200 director Richard Lat-
tis. “They zinged back and
forth, ﬂying under

_water.” Adds Mr. Mur-

taugh, “It was utter exu-
berance.” . -

In addition to the live-
animal exhibit, the zoo in-
cludes a Wildlife Conser-
vation Center for displays

0 that highlight the world-

wide conservation efforts
of the New York Zoologi-
cal Society, and 3 Zoo
School, which carries out
an extensive wildlife edu-
cation program.

. The original plan for
the 840-acre Central Park,
designed by Frederick
Law Olmsted and Calvert
Voux, did not include a

zoo. The idea came after
the park was under con-
struction. Jonathan Kuhn,

‘ Central Park historian, ex-

plains that “one day in
1858, someone dropped
off a small bear at the
park gatehouse. A park
messenger boy began tak-
ing care of the bear, and
gradually other animals
were brought in and kept
in makeshift conditions in
the basement, and on the
grounds surrounding the
Arsenal building at the
southern end of the park.”
In 1864, parks commis-
sioner William Conklin es-
tablished a formal
menagerie and had
wooden cages built.

By 1934, the menagerie
facilities were outdated
and dilapidated. Parks
commissioner Robert Mo-
ses spearheaded a remod-
eling effort that resulted
in the Central Park Zoo, 3 ‘
quadrangle of red—brick
animal houses encircling a
pool for sea lions.

In its day, the 1934 zoo
was seen as grand. Open—
ing ceremonies began with
a trumpet fanfare. Then,
while thousands of bal-
loons were released, a city
ofﬁcial, scheduled to give
a speech, instead startled
the audience by singing,
“Oh, I went to the animal
fair.” The entire ceremony
was true to park commis-
sioner Moses’ conviction
that the purpose of this
zoo was “to encourage the
having of a good time.”

Now, more than 50
years later, the 200’s
physical transformation
reﬂects a gradual change
in our view toward ani-
mals. Certainly, the stated
purpose of the zoo is less
anthropocentric than it
was in 1934.

Says Dr. Conway: “Our
goal here is to get people
to think not just in terms
of affection for animals,
but also in terms of their
long-term survival. The
Central Park Zoo animals
are ambassadors for all
other animals throughout
the world.”

 




 

It’s conveniently located downtown, yet
surrounded by both forest and ocean, des-
ert and jungle. It’s serene, yet bursting
with wildlife. It’s the new Indianapolis Zoo,
the ﬁrst major zoo in many years to be
built from the ground up.

Planners can hold receptions in one of
several environments, be it amongst the
beluga and killer whales of the Whale and
Dolphin Pavilion Gallery, a ground-level,
fully-enclosed facility holding up to 500
that provides a panoramic -
underwater view of deep-water
wonders, or the Outdoor Pavilion,
an enormous 900—capacity tent—
covered area, right in the vi-
cinity of the lions, tigers and
bears. Evening cocktail parties
for up to 300 can be enjoyed in
the reception area
of the World of
Water Aquarium.

It comes equipped
with slide, tape and
Video capabilities.
Rest assured the
penguins will be well
dressed. Opened on June 11, this
$64 million dollar home to over
2,000 animals is also available
after hours for rental in its entirety.
And by the way, the animals live in envi-
ronments known as “biomes.” Translation:

200 Atlanta AWorded Specnol Grant

Zoo Atlanta has received a $17,- ‘

025 grant from the Institute of
Museum Services for a special
conservation project. The funds
will be used to study the drill, a
critically endangered African for-
est primate. Results of the project
will be used to help increase drill
breeding success and to provide.
new information for managing
this endangered species. It ena-
bles Zoo Atlanta to further its
commitment to conservation re-

‘ search.

“(This) conservation grant is a
clear indication that our collabo-
ration with the Yerkes Primate
Center at Emory University is
working,” said Zoo Atlanta direc-
tor Dr. Terry Maple. “The efforts
of our first-rate scientists .will

g.....o...__ ,5" .4-... ,

surely result 1n a better future for
this endangered species.”

Heading the project will be zoo
assistant director/general curator
Dr. C. Dietrich Schaaf and Dr.
Kenneth G. Gould, who is chief of
reproductive biology and research
professor with the Yerkes Re-
gional Primate Research Center of
Emory University in Atlanta.
Schaaf, who has a Ph.D. in wild-
life biology, initiated an ongoing
study of drill behavior at the
Philadelphia zoo. Gould, who is
both a veterinarian and a Ph.D. in
medicine, is a leading authority
on primate reproduction.

Facilities for the study of drills
are already in place at the zoo’s
new Ford African Rain Forest,
which is home to Willie B. and 13

gorillas from Yerkes. This exhibit
is a multi-faceted complex, which
has special areas for the exhibi-

. tion and study of not only gorillas

but other primates as well -- birds
and small forest ungulates. A new
exhibit for African forest mon-
keys, including drills and man-
drills, will open at the zoo in 1990.

Drills, in addition to being en-
dangered in the wild, also have
not reproduced well in captivity.
They have not been thoroughly
studied and the captive population
has declined. Schaaf and Gould
plan to study the species’ reprod-
uctive physiology and to compare
this information to that of the
mandrill, a related primate which
has been more extensively investi-

gated and which has a better ;
breeding record. The study in- .
volves obtaining and analyzing ;
urine samples and other endocrine ;
measurements on a regular basis 3.
from a number of drills and man- i
drills. Results of the study will be 1
in scientific journals and '
presented to zoo visitors through ‘1
special educational displays. The .
study will begin later this fall.

The Institute of Museum Serv- :.
ices is an independent govern- ;
ment agency operating within the ;
executive branchﬁnd provides fed 1
eral support for museums of all
disciplines. There were 404 appli- j
cants for the 1988 conservationi
project support grants. Zoo At- 1
lanta was one of 219 recipients. 1

iLet Us Visit 266 forrl’li’ree

We visited the Atlanta Zoo this.
'summer and while it IS gratifying to see
improvements in progress, it will be a
long time before these are completed.
I strongly object to being charged $5 50
for entrance as though it was a first-
class exhibit.

As a child, my home was in the
“Grant Park area. And I spent a happy
childhood enjoying all the facilities.
There was no charge then, and it was
in better condition than it is now. I
don’t believe there should be a fee
even when it is completed, and certain-
. ly not as high as it is now. Let’s let the
citizens have free use of it.

wild gibbons die annually as tropical

forests are destroyed for industry and "

she talks. They are siamangs, black-
haired gibbons from Indonesia. Dar,
their infant son, clings tightly to

Belem’s chest. He, like his brothers

and sisters before him, will eventually

be sent to a zoo in need of a gibbon to
multiply the threatened species’
chances for survival.

other zoo-goers. She weighs about 20
pounds and has a beautiful, soulful face
with dark, wise eyes. Suddenly Sam
inﬂates his neck sac and begins
booting softly, a low sound like
blowing into a jug. Belem joins in, and
they raise the pitch and intensity to an
ear-splitting, shrieking duet, a
gibbonesque declaration of territory
you can hear half a mile away.

Later, Belem and Dar hang lazily
from a rope, watching the Chinese-
cultural counselor talk about White-

housed with the siamangs, have

Zoo Shows Off Its New Hospital

f Animals Must Be 111, This $3. 4 Million Facility 13 the Place to Be

 

By Karlyn Barker

Washington Post Staff Writer

 

, The patient broke his right leg
sand will have to spend a few days in
wthe hospital. But he is getting used

to his cast and eating well—and

doctors say the marabou stork has a

good chance of making a fuil recov-

gen,
The stork, a Pere David’s deer
and three baby red pandas are find-
ing the National Zoo’s new $3.4
million veterinary hospital very
much to their liking, or so it seemed
yesterday when the state-of-the-art
. facility was opened to the media for
Lia quick tour.
, “It’ s like riding a tricycle versus
riding in a Mercedes-Benz,” said
Mitchell Bush, the 200’s chief ’vet—
-«erinarian, comparing the ultramod-
ern hospital with an adjacent build-
ing that housedthe animal medicine
facility for two decades. “We’ll be
able to do so much more.”

Zoological medicine has under-i

gone a dramatic‘change in recent
years. There was a time, according
to Bush, when zoo doctors did little
to or for the animals except dis-
'pense medication and try to make
{them comfortable. Now, with ad-
'vances in animal anesthesiology,
pathology and research, the Smith-
sonian Institution’s National Zoo is
reonsidered a leading facility for so-
..phisticated treatment practices,

‘

.ricluding important innovations in
preventive medicine and reproduc-
tive techniques for the 200’s 4,000
residents.

Current patients include the
.stork, whose prognosis is consid-
ered favorable because zoo veter-
inarians have made a study of how
bird bones heal, and the Pere Da-

vid’s deer, whose broken rear'leg

also is on the'mend.

The 200’s new hospital, which
has more than 21,000 square feet
of work space, houses the depart-
ment of animal health, headed by
Bush, and the department of animal
pathology, headed by Richard Mon-
tali. The facility has the kind of
treatment and examination rooms
found in a hospital for humans——
with some obvious differences.

The zoo hospital, for example,
needs special rooms and equipment
so that large or dangerous animals
can be shifted or fed by remote con—
trol, and anesthetized from afar
with blow darts. One ward comes
with tanks to house marine life. An-
other comes with padded cages, a
scale built into the ﬂoor and open-
ings for blow darts so that fright-
ened animals can be housed and
examined without undue trauma.

The operating room has a hy-
draulic surgical table that can hold

and lift an anim 1 weighing up to ~

2, 000 pounds. l ,
Thereis l Especial laboratory

for studying exotic animals, where
the staff is busy taking blood counts
and tissue cultures of healthy as
well as sick animals. It’s impossible
to know what an abnormal blood
count for an elephant is until the
animal’s normal blood count is
known, Montali said.

Another study project: the
diaphragmatic hernias in golden lion

- tamarins. Researchers hope to find

out if this frequent problem is
caused by a genetic defect that can
be controlled by selective breeding.

The zoo suffered a major diasap-
pointment this summer when Ling-
Ling, its celebrated female giant
panda, failed to give birth to a cub.
But the hospital staff is now min-
istering to 8-week-old baby red pan-
das.

One was rejected by its mother af-
ter birth, not an uncommon occur-
rence,‘and is being hand-raised. Two
other babies, also being raised by
humans, were brought in from the
Kansas City Zoo to keep the new
baby company and help all three re-
member that they are pandas.

“Besides us getting too attached
to them, they also imprint on us,”
said Bush, as he watched the red
pandas being bottle fed by keepers.

The panda socializing will have to If

wait a few weeks, however, until
the Kansas City arrivals getover a
bad case of ringworm, which the
200 is treating.

Like many arthritis sufferers,
Marie had trouble getting on her
feet one morning this week. In fact,
nearly 20 helpers were needed to
get her up.

. “Whether she lay down to go to

sleep, or got pushed down by the '

~ other elephants, We don’t know," St.
Louis 200 veterinarian William Bo-
ever said in discussing Marie, a
5,725-pound Asian elephant.
Boever said Marie suffered from.
arthritis in ‘her right hind leg,
which turns noticeably inward.

“She injured that some 10 years.

ago; I think she fell,” he said.

He added that Marie probably
had arthritis in her other joints but
that x-rays were unable to confirm
that diagnosis because of the ele-
phant's mass.

Marie, a veteran performer in
the elephant show, came to the Zoo
in 1955 at the age of) or 3, making
her about 35 years old.

“I wouldn’t call that ancient,” Bo-
ever said. “Elephants have lived 50
years or more in captivity.”

Boever said it was not unusual
for keepers to have to help an ele-
phant to its feet, especially after
medical h‘eatrnent.

But that usually is done in the ,

Elephant House, where iron rings

suspended from the ceiling are,

used to hoist the patient This was
the first time an elephant had to be
lifted in the yard. .
“Elephants, When they get down
like that -— a lot of debilitating

problems can cause that,” he said.~

“They get weak and just are unable
to rise and will die unless some-
thing is done for them.”

When antibiotics and steroids
failed to help Marie get back up
Tuesday morning, keepers tried
hoisting chains, a block and tackle
and iron come-alongs -- the long.
iron poles used to prompt the ani-
mals to move.

Eventually, the keepers were
able to maneuver Marie onto skids
and wheel her inside, Boever said.

“Off and on, we had probably 20
people helping,” Boever said. “We

“When we got her inside, we put

“Now what we’re doing is gradu-
ally lowering the sling so she can

By Wednesday, Marie was able to

 

put about half her weight on her
own four feet. By Thursday, she
was supporting herself. On Friday,
the sling hung loose as Maria swung
her freckled pink trunk back and
forth, occasionally showering her.-
self with hay.

“She also lost a tooth this week
-- they periodically shed their mo-
lar teeth ~ so that complicated the

“She’s a little unstable yet, and
she has some bruises where she

swelling about the head. But that
will heal with time.” _

Boever estimated that Marie
would be kept in the sling a week.
“At night, we’ll lift it to support
her,” he said.

“She’s taking it very well,” he
said.

BQYING AND SELLING OF ANIMALS

Zoo trades
*not limited
to exotics

By Alan Gottlieb
Denver Post Staff Writer

If anyone has a spare Canadian
Lynx, the Denver Zoo would like
to make you an offer.

Each month, Denver and most
other zoos throughout the United
States and Canada list their needs
and surpluses in a professional
trade publication called the “Ani-
mal Exchange.” Many breeding
loans, sales and purchases are
consummated each month
through the publication.

Zoo exchanges

Although buying and selling ani-
mals isn’t a big money-maker for
zoos, the exchanges do enhance
breeding.

Last year, Denver budgeted
$30,000 to buy animals, and esti-
mated revenues from sales at
about $75,000. The zoo bought 77
animals and sold 178.

Purchases weren’t limited to
exotic species, said Paul Linger,
assistant director of the zoo. The
zoo bought such commonplace
animals as hedgehogs and Asian
squirrels, as well as the more un-
usual roan antelopes, worth be-
tween $3,000 and $4,000 each.

In addition to the selling and
buying, the zoo traded 24 animals,
borrowed 15 and loaned out 11.

Different bloodlines

The primary need for such
transfers is this: Nine of every 10
animals in American zoos are
bred domestically. To breed suc-
Cessfully, pairs have to come
from different bloodlines.

Most US. zoos and many
throughout the world share a
computerized data base called
the International Species Invento-
ry System. It allows zoo directors
to keep track of bloodlines, mak-
ing it easier for them to buy or

RARE CAT: Snow leopard, an endangered species, is one of the
many animals on loan to Denver 200. '

borrow animals with no blood ties
to their stock.

The system is part of a revolu-
tion in breeding technology that
has created a glut of some types
of animals — especially carnivo-
rous mammals, which are easier
to breed. "

“In the last 20 years, it has
gone from being great stuff to
breed a tiger to the point where
you can hardly give them away,”
Linger said. “Zoos now give most
carnivores vasectomies or hor-
monal implants.”

Loans are becoming increas-
ingly popular in the breeding sys-
tem. Under loan arrangements, a
zoo borrows an animal at no
charge in exchange for the first
pick of the offspring. But if the

borrowed animal should die, the
lending zoo won’t demand repay-
ment.

Rare antelope

Last year, the Los Angeles zoo
loaned Denver a pair of bongos, a
rare type of antelope, worth
about $25,000 each.

“On the second day, the keeper
let the male into the female’s

room. As soon as he walked
through the door . . . she dropped

dead of a heart attack, right on
the spot. So they sent us another
one.”

With all the trading and lend-
ing, there’s great demand for
transportation. And it’s a tricky

business, best left to specialists.

Among the largest transporters

‘of zoo animals is the International
Animal Exchange of Ferndale,
Mich. The exchange owns seven
custom-made tractor trailers for
hauling, but also charters jumbo
jets to move animals. Tom Hunt,
one of five brothers who runs the
company, said weeks, if not
inonths, go into planning a trans-
er.

“It can be a traumatic experi-
ence for an animal, so you have to
get it prepared.”

Weeks before a move, zookee-

per-3 often will introduce the ani-
mal to a smaller animal it can be-
friend.

“This works especially well with
the giant hippopotamus,” Hunt
said. “We get them a small goat or
a dog, and make them buddies.
Then the hippo will follow its friend
right up the ramp into the trailer.”

. The toughest animal to transport
is the killer whale.

. The company has to charter a
Jet, set up a special tank and sling,
and make sure the water tempera-
ture is maintained throughout the
flight. Moving a killer whale costs
a zoo or aquarium up to $200,000.

Zoo May Get
A Tax Break
For Animals

Beasts Given Away
After Fairfax Seizure

 

By Alice Digilio
Washington Post Staff Writer

The owners of the traveling Won-
der Zoo may cash in on their dona-
tion of 40 animals that had been
impounded after they were found in
sweltering trailers last month, an
attorney for the owners said yes-
terday.

Under an out-of-court agreement
that averted a criminal proceeding
in Fairfax General District Court,
Richard Garden and Frank Buck
Bring ’Em Back Alive Inc. gave the
animals to an animal welfare asso-
ciation.

According to Steve Mandell, at-
torney for Wonder Zoo’s~ owners,
the donation of an African elephant,
zebra, two ostriches and other an-
imals was not made under any du-
ress and qualifies for a corporate
tax deduction.

“They gave them to an organi-
zation for whom they could obtain a
tax deduction. We had a very clear
option,” he said, adding that his cli-
ents had been fully prepared to go-
to court.

“We felt it really resulted in a
position that was best for the an-
imals at the time,” he said. “We all
like to make contributions to char-

' itable organizations. We give things
to Goodwill, for instance.”

The animals are worth about
$80,000, according to Bettijane

Those big bad wolves1 From
childhood we learn they have ears
to hear us, noses to smell us and
teeth to eat us.

Such fear-creating fairy tales
are exactly what the Denver Zoo
hopes to dispel with its newest ex-
hibit, “Wolf Pack Woods.”

The first Denver wolf exhibit in
30 years, Wolf Pack Woods fea-
tures five white arctic tundra
wolves who look more like their
household descendants than huff-
ing and puffing predators.

Zoo keepers obviously are fond,

not afraid, of their new charges:—

“They’re persecuted,” said keeper
Dottie Kreid-er, whose sunburned
face glows even more when she
gets to talk about wolves.

The five wolves roam three-

quarters of an acre of natural

grassy habitat designed to repli-
cate a boreal forest, with pines,
rock formations and a pool. There
are two viewing areas at the
$90,000 exhibit, which was paid for
with private donations and opens
next Friday.

“It fits the northern routine . . .
the edge of the tundra,” said cura-
tor John Wortman.

Natives of northern Canada, the
wolves stand about 32 inches high
and weigh up to 125 pounds. Three
males -— Old Man, Buddy and
Lanky — and two females — Scar-
face and Angel -— were split from a
pack at the Toronto Zoo.

Old Man is the only pack mem-

ber who was caught in the wild. ’
But so far, Angel has presented the

most problems.

‘ “She’s the hardest one to work
{with . . . we have trouble getting
ﬁsher into the back holding area,”
,Kreider said. “We figure maybe
2 she’ll take after her name soon.”

,3 The wolves prefer dog food to lit-
:tle girls wrapped in red capes. And
:they’re playful, using a glove left
sby a workerfor a game of tug of
f war. They also like romping in the

(pool to cool off. ‘

The exhibit points out what a
bad rap the canis lupus has gotten
from Homo sapiens.

Wolves were the first animals to
live with humans. They eat hoofed
animals and other large mammals
in the wild, but pose very little
threat to people. And their icy
lhowls, which are heard just south
of the 200’s harbor seal exhibit ev-
ery morning and evening, often are
voiced all in fun.

Wolves are now an endangered

species after being killed off earli-

er this century by fearful people.

j According to the exhibit, 24,000

g. wolves were killed, primarily in

l; Wyoming, Montana and Colorado,
between 1915 and 1942.

“There’s a lot of lore and mys-

‘ tique about wolves that’s just not
; true,” Wortman said. “The idea is
.g to learn to appreciate the ani-
, mals.”

A giant panda from London named

Chia Chia is about to embark on a

”5 Proceeds from Chia Chia’s Cincinnati

The final obstacle to the arrange-

“Now all we need is a safe journey

she reported that the permit, pending
since spring, was at last in hand.

The journey over “the pond,” the At-

cinnati Zoo. More importantly, special
panda-breeding facilities at the Chapul-
tepec Zoo in Mexico City are being ex-
panded especially for him.

“The remaining funds will be used to
create a Giant Panda Conservation
Fund that will be managed jointly by
the London and Cincinnati zoos,” Bra-
dy said.

The Chapultepec Zoo, which has
bred more giant pandas than any zoo
outside China, needs an unrelated male

”giant panda to mate with a female

named Tohui. The 7-year-old was the
first giant panda ever successfully born
and reared in captivity outside of
China.

London Zoo officials last year of-
fered to loan Chia Chia - one of a pair
of pandas given to Britain in 1974 by
the People’s Republic of China —- to
Chapultepec, but that 200 had to reject
the offer because it had no room for
additional pandas.

The Cincinnati Zoo came to the res-
cue while negotiating with Chapulte-
pec for a loan of one of its pandas. The
loan bad preliminary approval of Mexi-
co City officials, but the necessary im-
portation permits were blocked by
lawsuits filed earlier this year by oppo-
nents of temporary panda loans. '

Because there only about 900 pandas
alive in either the wilds of China or in
captivity, the opponents maintain tem-
porary loans hurt the species. Brady
said using the Cincinnati Zoo proceeds
to pay for efforts to enlarge the species
helped defuse the opposition.

Officials of all three zoos involved in
the match-making will learn if true
love awaits the pair when panda breed-
ing season arrives in March and April.

"Homesick" panda given day off: Cincinnati Zoo officials are
giving giant panda Chia Chia five days off to see if he can overcome
what they believe is homesickness. Chia Chia' went on display Friday
at the start of a three—month stopover on his move from the London
Zoo to Mexico City. But the zoo administrators closed the exhibitthe
same day because the panda was staying in his den and acting
strangely.

LOS ANGELES TIMES - August 10, 1988

Rare [6%

By AMY STEVENS,
Times Staff Writer

A rare snow leopard cub at the
Los Angeles Zoo has died of anemia
.caused by flea bites, zoo officials
said Tuesday. They said the male
.cub, one of three born at the zoo
about a year ago, showed none of
the usual warning signs of infesta-
tion by the blood sucking insects.

Zoe veterinarian Dr. Ben Gonza—
les said the fiea problem is “partic-
ularly bad" this summer in some
parts of the park, but he and others
expressed surprise that the young
snow leopard reacted so suddenly. .
. “Wejust didn’t see anything that
would'make alarm bells go off,”
leopard keeper Birdie Foster said.
-“The day before [he died] this cub
was taking his nap in his usual
relaxed position. . .We didn’tsee
ﬂeas until we had our hands on
him."

Foster said the animal had not
been scratching or licking itself
and had not lost weight, even
though it had stopped eating about
three days before it died on July 13.
County health officials, called in to
help treat the flea problem, said it
appears the fleas were breeding in
an animal run in the snow leopard
enclosure that was covered with
wet soil and leaves. .

Two remaining snow leOpards in
the enclosure-the cub’s mother
and a female sibling—have been
dipped and sprayed for fleas and
are believed to be healthy, al-
though the exhibit area has been
closed indefinitely. (Another sib-
ling was sold to a zoo in Indiana.)

- ‘fIn retrospect, it’s always easy to

look back on. these things and say
we could have prevented it," Gon-
zales said. "If a cat looks absolutely

healthy, do you jump on them and

decide they have fleas?”
Fewer than a thousand snow
leopards remain in the world today.

In its native Nepal, the majestic '

silver-fumed cat leads a reclusive
and predatory life in the cold crags
of the Himalayas. About 350 of the
endangered animals live in captivi-
ty, including . 200 in U.S. zoos.

‘ According to Gonzales, unlike do-

mestic cats and even some wild
ones such as lions that allow them-
selves to be petted by keepers,
snow leopards are “standoffish”
and are not easily examined by
doctors except under anesthesia,
which itself can be risky to the
animal. ' '

An independent veterinarian.

 

The rare snow leopard that died at the Los Angeles Zoo was one
of these three cubs, pictured after their birth a year ago.

noted that big cats sometimes do
not scratch when they have fleas.
“The only way the keeper would
have known [about the fleas] is if
there were fleas actually biting the
keeper," said .Dr. Richard .L.
Shackelford, a Pasadena veterinar~
tan.

Enclosure Not Sprayed

A zoo spokeswoman said the
snow leopard enclosure, known as
the China Pavilion because it was
built for the giant pandas that
visited Los Angeles in 1984, was
not treated for fleas until the
leopard died. , '

“This zoo does not have a history
of a major flea problem," the

. spokeswoman, Lora LaMarca, said.

“This exhibit has never had fleas,
and we never have fleas with our
other big cats.”

The Denver Post /' Karl Gehring

Clayton Freiheit runs the Denver Zoo W1' tb a firm hand and a clear vision —— a combination that works, say his admirers.

But savvy manager Clayton Freiheit
has tamed the city’s wild kingdom

 

HEN Clayton Freiheit

was a teenager, he had

a basement zoo and par-

ents of surpassing toler-

ance. But when a snake

escaped its container
and wriggled through their Buffalo, N.Y.,
home, and an alligator scared a gas-meter
reader, Clayton’s mother, Ruth, set up
stricter rules.

No more escaping animals. Got that,
son?

Got it. So Clayton made the basement
absolutely secure. That way, he wouldn’t
have to give up his hobby — collecting rep-
tiles, birds, rabbits and any number of
smaller mammals. From that beginning,
Ruth Freiheit’s son would eventually take
up animal keeping as his life’s work, be-
coming at age 22 the youngest zoo director
in the country. Later, as his stature as zoo
keeper grew, he would earn an internation-
al reputation for his knowledge and high
standards.

Today at 50, Freiheit — whose middle
name is Fredric, after the actor Fredric

March — has been director of the Denver
Zoological Gardens for nearly 18 years. He
is in charge of an annual operating budget
of more than $4 million. He supervises
about 100 employees in a 76~acre zoological
park where 500 trees have been planted on
his orders and where more than a million
adults and children annually stroll about
while observing 1,500 individual animals of

. more than 300 species.

His biggest accomplishment, however, ,
may be that he gets things done. Bird
World, Northern Shores, Wolf Pack Woods
— those and other exhibits at the Denver
Zoo are a testament to Freiheit‘s ability to
finish a job he starts.

How does he doit?

“He bird-dogs things,” says his boss, Don
Etter of Denver’s department of parks and
recreation. “Clayton thinks strategically.
He knows where he is. He knows where he
is going. And he then puts together a strate—
gy that sees it through.”

Not only that, he is a good communica-
tor, says Etter. “You can have all the strat-
egy in the world. But if you can’t communi-

 

 




 

 

cate with people what it is you
want, and where it is you’re
going, it doesn’t fall into
place.”

REIHEIT knows

where he is going, de—

spite a grueling

schedule that entails
travel (last week he was in
Stuttgart, West Germany, at a
zoo directors’ conference),
fund-raising and promotion,
plus day-to-day administra-
tion. He is so busy that even
his interruptions are inter-
rupted. At particularly hectic
moments, he is likely to growl
in a dramatic baritone, "‘It’s a
zoo out therel”. ,

Yet Freiheit loves his work
and he credits his parents
with the encouragement he
needed to follow his instincts.
“They were kind, good folks,”
he says. And they let him take
risks. He was clawed and bit-
ten by animals from time to
time, but his parents didn’t
discourage his hobby. Besides,
he was fascinated with the an-
imals. “I was probably too
young to be afraid of them.”

He says this from his office
in the zoo administration
building. It’s a comfortable
but modest space with win-
dows that look out on the
grounds. Dominating the
room is Freiheit’s desk, piled
high with papers. The desk it-
self is dominated by Freiheit,
whose Falstaffian girth is car-
ried well on a 6-foot-l frame.

His manner is charming
and, because of his size, rath-
er grand. And there’s a bit of
the showman in Freiheit. He
once astonished city officials
by giving a report in Swahili
-— and then translating. He
learned the Bantu language
during travels in Africa, and
he wears a large gold Afri-
can-agate ring and an African
silver bracelet on his right
hand and wrist, as well as a
matching African silver ring
on the pinky of his left.

Style notwithstanding, the
man doesn’t mind grunt work,
and he runs his “urban ar ”
as a tight ship.

No surprise, then, that on a
recent afternoon he was inter-
rupted by an employee, re-
porting that a private con.
struction crew was still
working on a repair job in the
zoo, past normal hours. Freih-
eit’s eyebrow shot up.

“I hope they don’t think
they’re on overtime,” he said.
“Go find out. ”

The subordinate returned a
half hour later to report that,
yes, “they’re on overtime.
They say the work has to be
finished before they quit, or
the concrete won’t set up.”

Freiheit did not look pleas-
ed. “Well, have they been
working hard all day? Since
early this morning?”

Yes, the employe said, ad-
mitting that “they have stood
around at times.”

At that point — in language
best described as earthy —
Freiheit demanded to know

 

 

just how much time the crew
had wasted.

When you’re a frugal man-
ager like Freiheit, every dime
of expenditure must be justi-
fied. And time is money.

*****

LAYTON Freiheit is
bullish on the Den—
ver Zoo. He believes
the zoo is developing
rapidly toward greatness.

 

 

The Demer Post ’ L}.n Alxxeis

Northern Shores, one of several showcase habitats opened dunng Freihe1t’s tenure, debuted 111 1987.

Others say if it achieves inter-
national stature in the near fu-
ture, it. will be because of
Freiheit.

Only a lack of money holds
back expansion.

Despite the hopes of many
citizens, Denver won’t have
an aquarium in its near fu-
ture, because the funds to
build and maintain one aren’t
available.

As a little joke, a fish tank

in Freiheit’s office is labeled
“the Denver Zoo’s Aquari-
um.”

Priorities are in adding and
improving exhibits and animal
collections.

For example, the zoo has
only a few snakes, and Frei-

heit — renowned for his ex»

pertise with venomous snakes

-- believes that a significant .

snake collection is long over-
due.

With Tropical Discovery, a
planned new exhibit, a major
assortment of snakes — as
well as other exotic animals
— will be in place.

“This (commitment to ac-
quire snakes) was in direct re-
sponse to visitors’ inquiries,”
Freiheit told a Denver Post
reporter earlier this summer.
“The first most-asked ques-
tion we get is, ‘Where are the

Among Clayton Freiheit’s major accomplishments at
the Denver Zoo in an 18—year tenure:

IBlrd World was completed in 1975.1

IA gorilla habitat was compMed as an addition to
the Primate House in 1977.

IA restaurant and gift shop were completed in 1978.
lSheep Mountain was renovated in 1979.

'lThe old Monkey House was remodeled in 1980.

IAdditions were made to the zoo hospital and edu-
cation and administration buildings in 1980—82.
IExhibits in the Pachyderm House were renovated in
1985. ‘ .

lNorthern Shores, a showcase habitat for polar
bears, sea lions, arctic foxes, harbor seals, river ot-
ters, snowy owls and waterfowl, was opened in 1987.

[Wolf Pack Woods, featuring five white arctic tundra
wolves that roam three-quarters of an acre of natural
grassy habitat, opened earlier this summer.

lUnder Freiheit's guidance, the 200 has become al-
most self-supporting. ln 1987, only 17.4 percent of
zoo revenues came from the city. Admission tees ac-
counted tor 52.9 percent, while concessions made up
12.3 percent and private contributions through the
Denver Zoological Foundation lnc., 17.4 percent.

bathrooms?’ The second is,

ti$t¢

HE snakes were‘in Ruth

Freiheit’s basement

when Clayton was a boy.

He began collecting
snakes while he was still in
grammar school — along with
rabbits, raccoons, frogs, turtles,
salamanders, fish, and whatever
else he could find during hikes in
the countryside near Buffalo
with his father, Clayton John
Freiheit, a railroad employee,
and grandfather, Fred Freiheit,
a retired automotive worker.

“My father and grandfather
were sportsmen,” Freiheit ex-
plains. “They were confirmed
hunters and fishermen. And be-
cause their interest in wildlife
was very broad, they- went to the
Buffalo Zoo almost every Sun-
day, and they started taking me
as soon as I could toddle. That
was our church.”

Thus young Clayton not only
brought home animals from the
fields and woods he explored, but
he also developed a deep interest
in zoos.

Dr. Kenneth Condrell, a Buffa-
lo child psychologist who went
through school with Freiheit
from elementary grades into col-
lege, recalls: “Before Clayton
finished high school, he had trav-
eled to zoos all over the country.
That’s what he lived for. When
he came back from a zoo, he
would draw the equivalent of a
blueprint -- showing how the 200
was laid out, how it was land-
scaped, everything.”

Condrell remembers going to
the Freiheit home where his
chum had “a real menagerie.”
“Typically I would find him
studying and watching TV with a
monkey or a parrot sitting on his
shoulder. He was very gentle,
very caring, with a strong com-
passion for animals and for peo-
ple.”

When Clayton was 14, he be-
came a volunteer at the Buffalo
Museum of Science, which, for
educational purposes kept a chil-
dren’s zoo each summer. He was
so adept in handling animals that
the curator of education, Ells-
worth Jaeger, hired him as a
part-time employee.

In time, J aeger put Freiheit in
charge of the 200 on holidays and
weekends when more- mature
employees were off. “It Was
good training,” comments Freih-
eit.

Freiheit was 18 when he was
contacted by Ronald Shanin, a
Buffalo rocket engineer who had
decided to spend several years in
Africa as a wildlife cinematogra-
pher. Says Freiheit, “He asked if
he should send animals over to
me when he encountered them,”
says Freiheit. “in those days,
there weren’t the restrictions (on
exporting wildlife) there are to-
day. So I basically became an an-
imal agent for this guy.”

The animals included baby
chimpanzees and cheetah and
leopard cubs and many deadly

 

 

vate donations.

struction.

 

COMINGSOON
dihezoo

N the drawing board are

two new Freiheit proj-

ects, the most ambitious in
, the 200’s 92-year history:

ITropical Discovery —— a 1.5 acre, $5 million rain—
forest home for a large variety of exotic animals, ev-
erything from sloths to mouse deer to venomous
snakes. Scheduled to open in 1991 after two years
of work, Tropical Discovery will be built with $1.7
million in 1982 bond funds plus $3.3 million in pri-

I Primate Panorama — a 5-aore simulated natural
habitat for at least 20 kinds of primates, from low-
land gorillas to dwarf galagos. Estimated cost is
$9.2 million -— entirely in private funds. The exhibit
is expected to open in 1993 after two years of con-

 

adders, Spitting cobras, and
black mambas. The reptiles
were shipped in cans labeled
with warnings in several lan-
guages. The mammals, fed and
watered at each stop along the
way, arrived in crates and boxes.

Shipments were opened in
Freiheit’s basement, where the
l9—year-old cared for them until
he could sell them to zoos around
the country. “My parents were
extremely tolerant,” says Freih-
eit. “In retrOSpect, I would say it
(the business) was dangerous
and very foolish.”

Thanks to his selling animals
to zoos, Freiheit became an ani-
mal celebrity locally and won the
friendship of some of the nation’s
most famous zoo keepers, includ-
ing Marlin Perkins.

Perkins, who died in 1986, had
been director of the Buffalo Zoo
from 1933 to 1944. Later he be-
came director of Chicago’s Lin-
coln Park Zoo and a pioneer of
television with “Zoo Parade,”
which continued as “Wild King-
dom” after Perkins was appoint-
ed director of the St. Louis Zoo.

On the strength of a letter of
recommendation from Perkins,
Freiheit at 22 was offered the cu-
ratorship of the Buffalo Zoologi-
cal Gardens.

“I told my father,” he remem-
bers, “and we went to a bar and
got on a pretty pleasant buzz.”

Freiheit — who says he was
“scared to death” by the chal-
lenge -— accepted the appoint-
ment in May 1960, dropping out
of his studies at the University of
Buffalo. “1 never looked back,”
he comments. He became the
youngest zoo director in the Unit-
ed States at that time.

During the 10 years he was in
charge, the Buffalo Zoo attained
a national reputation, with exhib-
its and collections doubling in
size. \.

On Oct. 1, 1970, three months
after his father died, Freiheit be-
came director of the Denver Zoo-
logical Gardens. He now is paid
not quite $54,000 a year — an “ad-
equate” salary, he says. In fact,
the city is probably getting a bar-
gain. Freiheit frequently puts in
15-hour days. He only stopped
working weekends five years

 

ago. “Hell, yes, I get tired,” he
admits. “I basically use week-
ends to unwind, listening to pop
music."

Despite his absorption with his
zoo duties, he finds time to trav-
el. On a regular basis, he returns
to Buffalo for family visits. His
sister, Anne Zloty, and her hus-
band and daughters live there.
His mother died in 1978.

Otherwise, all his travels — ex—
cept one brief trip to Yellow-
stone National Park — have been
to zoos in this country and
abroad.

He has led photographic teams
on safari in Kenya, Tanzania,
Uganda, Rwanda, Namibia, Zim-
babwe and the Republic of South
Africa. His studies of wildlife
have taken him to India, Nepal,
Indonesia, Singapore, Japan and
Australia, as well as to Mexico
and many European countries.

“International travel is one of
the marvelous perks of this job,”
Freiheit acknowledges. “I have
dozens of good friends in nearly
every major city throughout the
world. It is a privilege to know
other zoo directors and to have
their friendship. And I’ve had
some exciting moments.”

He also has had some laughs.
The first time he saw an African
lion up close in the wild, a large
male was walking steadily
across a treeless plain toward
the stopped open vehicle in
which Freiheit and others stood.
Freiheit was nervous. Was the li-
on going to charge?

“No, he was only looking for
shade,” recalls Freiheit, with a

. smile. “He ﬂopped down in the

shade of the car.”

*****

HERE is an irony in the

name Freiheit — pro-
nounced Fry-bite —

which means “freedom”

in German. “That’s interesting,”
he says, “because my job basic-
ally is to keep wildlife confined.”
But confined with freedom -—-
as much freedom as available
money will allow. That means re-
placing “anirnal jails” with repli~
cated natural habitats. In the in-
ternational movement to build
such zoo environments, Freiheit

is a recognized leader. The habi-
tats are costly, however, and
Freiheit emphasizes that a zoo
can’t succeed without money.

But a good zoo also requires
leadership, and Freiheit has pro-
vided it, his admirers say.

“Because of Clayton,” says
Don Etter of parks and recre-
ation, “the Denver Zoo is no lon-
ger a menagerie. It’s a park.
That’s the basic philosophy that
Clayton is carrying through. It’s
an environment, not a bunch of
cages with animals‘in it. From
that point of view, even though
it’s a relatively small zoo, it’s
very high quality.”

Freiheit’s knowledge extends
to veterinary techniques and his
understanding of hundreds of
species and environments has
been recognized by the world’s
top zoological organizations.
(He’s a past president of the
American Association of Zoologi-
cal Parks and Aquariums and be-
came a member of AAZPA’s ex-
ecutive committee in 1987.

Despite such honors, Freiheit
says he has “always tried con-
sciously to keep a low profile. I
try to orchestrate -— to make
sure our operation comes togeth-
er.”

He says he couldn’t succeed
without the help of the Denver
Zoological Foundation Inc.,
which raises money through pri-
vate donations for the 200’s capi~
tal improvements. The founda-
tion, organized in 1950, has 44
trustees. It became an official

city agency in 1956. The group’s
president, Charles Warren, is a
Denver businessman who de-
votes large amounts of time to
the zoo. '

Freiheit and Warren some-
times appear in public together
to promote the zoo.

They can be a study in con—
trasts.

Warren’s deliberate presenta-
tions may be interrupted grandly
by Freiheit’s outbursts, which
Warren brushes aside as he pur-
sues a subject he clearly loves.

Apparently they make an ef-
fective team. Comments War-
ren: “Clayton is a great people
person, very diplomatic and a
gentleman, and he certainly
makes it fun for me as president
of the foundation to deal with

Adds Warren: “We’re lucky
he’s a bachelor. He’s married to
the zoo.”

In fact, Freiheit offers a simi-

lar assessment. He confides that
the “tragedy of my life" was a
broken marriage engagement in
Buffalo shortly before he moved
to Denver. “My fiancee,” he
says, “prophetically said she
didn’t want to be married to a
zoo.”
. There isn’t any sadness in his
voice when he tells this story:
“In retrospect,” he says, “I think
she was right. It takes a lot of
time, a lot of effort, and a strong
commitment to establish a first-
class 200, and,” he adds, “we’re
close to being world class.”

Springs gorilla undergoes I

Special to The Denver Post
COLORADO SPRINGS — A 32-
year-old gorilla at Cheyenne Moun-
tain Zoo has made history by be-
coming the first ape ever to under-
go an induced pregnancy
procedure used for sterile women.
And if the procedure proves suc-
cessful, 212-pound Becky could de-
liver a baby gorilla in May, said
Dr. Paul Calle, zoo veterinarian.
Becky, infertile since 1985, was
given a Gamete Intrafallopian
Transfer — or GIFT — on Monday.
Whether she is pregnant will not be
determined for eight to 10 weeks.

High dose of hormones

For six days last week, Becky
was given hormones by dart injec-
tions, receiving four times the hor-
mone supply a woman would be
given.

375-pound, 2&year-old gorilla, was

Gorillas Start Families

 

By ERlC N. BERG
Special to The New York Times

. SAN DIEGO —— Katie and Jimmy,
two 15-year-old gorillas, are the big
“item” here at the San Diego Zoo.
Lovers, the two have been courting for
months — climbing together on rock
formations in their outdoor enclosure,
frolicking in a nearby pool of water,
even mating publicly.

But try as they might to make a
baby, nothing seems to happen. As Fer-
nando Covarrubias, a gorilla keeper
here, put it: “He likes her, she likes
him, and they breed all the time. But he
cannot seem to impregnate her.”

More precisely, the problem is that
Katie appears to miscarry almost im-
mediately after conception. And as it
turns out, Katie is not the only gorilla in
American zoos having trouble staying
pregnant. By one expert’s estimate,
one-third of the 130 female gorillas in
captivity are having trouble with preg-
nancy. And another third have been
able to produce only one baby and are
now considered infertile.

May Vanish From Zoos
This is not just another instance of

animals, such as white pandas, reluc— ‘

tant to mate in captivity. The problem
is far more complex. The gorillas are
mating — publicly and unabashedly —
and seem to be conceiving. They just
cannot seem to remain pregnant once
conception takes place.

Unless their pregnancy problem can
be solved, experts say, the North
American gorilla population, currently
numbering 270, will slowly decline and
the powerful apes may vanish from
North American zoos.

Prompted by the disappointing par-
enting record of Katie and other fe—
male gorillas here, Nancy M. Czekala,
one of the San Diego Zoo’s endocrinolo-
gists, has uncovered dozens of other in-
stances at zoos around the country in
which gorillas have miscarried shortly
after their egg was fertilized.

“We’re going backwards,” said Ms.
Czekala. “We have a lot of older goril-
.as and a lot of younger ones that can-
iot seem to reproduce. It’s a problem.”

Zoos Sharing Data

All the gorillas in American zoos are
from the subgroup called lowland goril-
las. While endangered in the wild, these
are far more plentiful than the sparse,
more critically threatened population
of mountain gorillas, considered by
scientists to be a separate race within
the species.

Concerned scientists have created a
Gorilla Species Survival Plan, in which
zoos holding gorillas share animals and
data in the effort to build a healthier,
genetically varied population and im-
prove reproduction. The gorilla effort
is one of nearly two dozen plans set up
to bolster the future of captive popula-
tions of other endangered species. The

 

 

volved, are a crucial supplement to the

i even more vital efforts to save the wild
- populations of the animals.

The program has an unusual twist.

and other large primates to gain better
insight into man. A good portion of the
original data on human physiology
came from studying apes. Now the

“Humans have a very similar type of
fertility,” she said. “This is one of the
few times that humans can serve as
models for the study of apes.”

Her hunch, in fact, was that the goril

problem similar to what childless cou
ples often face. So,‘traveling the coun
try, Ms. Czekla collected urine samples
from 50 female gorillas.

 

Sure enough, her hunch was borne
out: Of the many gorillas who seemed

to be miscarrying, virtually all suf— ,

fered from a shortage of progesterone,
a hormone critical to the thickening of
the uterine wall. The shortage seemed
to be particularly notable in the luteal
phase of the gorilla’s menstrual cycle,
when the embryo would ordinarily
cling to the uterus.

“There just was not enough proges- '

terone to create the proper environ-

ment for the embryos to attach,” she' _'

said.
What is causing the, problem? Al-

though no one seems to know for sure, a
variety of educated guesses are of-
fered. .,

Ms. Czekala theorizes that the prob- ‘ .

lem may be the stress that gorillas are

experiencing from being in captivity. It "

has been shown that stress can lower

One Of Zoo Atlanta’s Visiting Cubs

Tiger Cubs Visit Zoo Atlanta

Zoo Atlanta has announced the special exhibit
of two tiger cubs on loan from the Columbus Zoo in
Columbus, Ohio. The Bengal tiger cubs will be on
view at Zoo Atlanta from Oct. 1-30.

The cubs were born' at the Columbus Zoo in
June. One 08 a normally colored Bengal, with
orange background and black stripes. The other,
named Wei, is white with brownish stripes. They
are both males and weight about 25 pounds each.

Tigers are the largest cats found in Asia.
Bengal tigers (Panthera tigris tigris) come from

India, where they live in forested and long-grass
areas.

Tigers are one of the most endangered of all
animals, due to the destruction of their natural
habitats. It is estimated that there may be about
4,000 Bengal tigers left in the wild, making it one
of the more numerous subspecies. Caspian and
Balinese tigers, howevers, have already become
extinct, while several other types have reached
extremely low numbers. Tigers are predators, and
feed on deer and other big game animals in the
wild.

At Zoo Atlanta, the visiting tiger cubs will be
exhibited in a special'new outdoor habitat near the
Ford African Rain Forest.

Maine may be moose coun-
try, but seeing one in the Ells-
worth area is rare. A few can be
spotted in Trenton, however,
where a couple of the large
beasts reside at the Acadia
Zoological Park.

Moose, along with a wide
variety of other animals large

and small, can be seen at close

range at the park. Visitors stroll
through acres of woodlands and
open fields, within a few feet of
most species. Food pellets sold
from gumball-type dispensers

can be hand-fed to many of

them. A petting area full of
pygmy goats is particularly
popular with children, who
become fast friends with the
animals.

The park is a nonprofit

charitable organization whose
aim is to educate the public
about animals — those native to
the area as well as more exotic
species. _

The 40-acre park encom-
passes large fields where buf-

‘falo, camels, reindeer, and elk

roam. A brook runs through the
park and several of the animals’
living areas, where coyote and
deer splash in the water.
Informational signs describe
each species and where they
originate; many are from Asia
and South America and will be
unfamiliar to most visitors.
Picnic areas and a gift shop
accommodate visitors, and in
the main building tiger cubs, a
prairie dog, and other small
animals are on display. The
park is supported entirely from
admission fees, which are $4 for
adults and $3 for children 3-12
and senior citizens. 'Season

“We turn the profits back into
the park,” Ashmore said, “and
when we have a good year, we
can afford to build a new ex-
hibit.” .

The park is also licensed as a
rehabilitation center and or-
phaned raccoons and foxes are
on display until they are old

Letters to the Editor

1713' -;'-”‘.':§'«"5‘1'-.."¢‘-.

:Zoo Atlanta Is Well on the Way to Cracking Top 10 of US. Zoos

From time to time we receive in-
quiries from our visitors who are seek-
ing information about the zoo and its
new programs. The zoo is undergoing a
period of rapid change and revitaiiza-
' tion as we build new, natural habitats
for all of our animals.

Today’s zoo is very different from
the traditional zoo of the past. Zoo At-
lanta is, for the first time in its long
history, positioned to become one of
the top 10 zoos in America. Some of our
visitors may treasure their memories.
but the old zoo was never regarded by
its peers or by the community as a first-
rate institution. Today‘s zoo is better
than it has ever been. and its quatity
will be enhanced year by year.

it is true that our animal collection
today is somewhat less varied than-it
was five years ago, but this was a nec-
essary step as we removed animals
from dilapidated cages and closed sec
tions of the zoo for construction of the
naturalistic habitats. Some of our most
popular animals -— lions. giraffes, rhi-
nos —— are off exhibit at present. But
these and many new animals wili rc~
turn next June, in habitats that will be
as good as any in America.

At the moment, we exhibit 290
birds. 62 mammals and 3.00 reptiles.
amphibians. insects and. fish. {‘iur total
animal collection will gradually expand
to more than 1.500 animals within the

next five years.

Next year is also our centennial,
and in many ways 1989 will be a major
turning point for the zoo. By the end of
the year, our redevelopment will be 50
percent complete. Our mammal collec-
tion will have returned to its full
strength. matching our excellent bird
and reptile collections in numbers and
variety. Our big cats, which have been
away for three years, will return. And
for the first time, the zoo will exhibit
hippos and crocodiles, both in a very
unique underwater viewing area. We
want our next 100 years to be a period
ofdistinction. ‘

The 200‘s admission prices have
been increased in recent years, but the
priceis stili competitive with the cost
of a movie theater ticket. We also offer
very attractive group rates. Compared
to an amusement park or a major
aquarium, the zoo is a bargain. A trip
to the 200 is one of the most wholesome
family experiences, and certainly one
of the most enjoyable.

Zoo Atlanta is a nonprofit organi-
zation. which must recover its operat-
ing costs primarily through gate re-
ceipts. We are providing high-quality
environments for animals and people.
This could not be accomplished with-
out periodic increases in admission
fees. which go directly toward the oper-
ation of the zoo. We are now able to

hire highly trained sta f, many of whom
have been recruited from established
zoos throughout the country. This is the
price of making the zoo great.

The support we have received from
our generous visitors and corporate
supporters, as well as from city, county
and state government, has resulted in
improvement that has led to our ac-
creditation and to our selection by the
Metropolitan Atlanta Community Foun-
dation as the best-managed non-profit
organization in Atlanta. We have a
number of exciting surprises in store
for the fail, and we hope that our sup-
porters will continue to Visit us to help
us reach our goal of 800,000 visitors,
the largest attendance in our history.

For those who want to visit the zoo

free of charge, we invite you to join the

Friends of Zoo Atlanta. For a small an-
nual free you can visit the zoo as many
times as you wish. The Friends have
grown from 4,000 members to more
than 45,000 in just four years, making it

oor Chia Chia. At the Cincinnati Zoo

last week, the giant panda didn’t seem

to appreciate his role in a scheme to

aid his endangered species. Since his mate
died three years ago, he’s been contentedly
living a solitary life in the London Zoo. His
masters had nobler plans. Concerned about
the dwindling stock of pandas, the zoo’s
curators arranged to send him to Mexico
City where three nubile females await him.
Along the way, he was scheduled to make a
three-month guest appearance in Cincin-
nati. The attendant pandamonium, the
keepers thought, would produce receipts to
cover Chia Chia’s future expenses. They
were right: 81,000 tickets sold in advance.
But when Chia Chia went on display the
day after his 17—hour trip, he unhappily
paced and panted around the exhibit. He

         

 

really got agitated when his keepers shut
the’door to his den. Inside was his only link
to London+his bedding. Worried zoo ofﬁ-
cials decided he was suffering from some-
thing worse than jet lag and closed the
exhibit last week. Chia Chia, they conclud-
ed, needed time to recover. What was
wrong? According to Jo Gipps of the Lon-
don Zoo, "Homesick is exactly the word.”
Bust hone: No one meant to rufﬂe the
animal’s fur. The arrangements for Chia

, Chia Were a model of good intentions, and
’ are part of an international effort by zoos to

keep the giant panda alive. Native to Chi-
na, there are fewer than 1,000 left in the
wild. They have fallen victim to dwindling
supplies of bamboo and vicious poaching.
To repair the damage, zoos are trying to
breed pandas in captivity. The Chapulte-
pec Zoo, where Chia Chia is headed, has
bred four surviving cubs since 1980. Other
zoos have raised funds for panda work by
“renting” animals from China and then
donating a share of the huge proceeds the
animals draw. Both sides beneﬁt from this
arrangement—but critics question wheth-
er the animals do. The Toledo, Ohio, zoo
currently has two Chinese pandas on dis-
play. The city tourism oﬂice expects them
to pump at least $15 million into the local
economy; the zoo has pledged to donate at
least $300,000 to the Chinese.

Money was the least of Chia ’Chia’s con-
cerns last week. He was slated to be back on
display by the weekend, then off to Mexico
City in another 12 weeks. There his pro-
spective mates will greet him and, as
George Bush likes to say, it will be "tension
city.” Pandas are a notoriously fussy lot
and their breeding habits have been known
to degenerate into very rough play. Poor
Chia Chia. London must seem but a distant
memory now.

ROB CAMPBELL stood in a narrow mountain
pathway of the mist-shrouded forest, camera
pressed to his nose, focusing his lens on a 400-pound
male “silverback” gorilla voraciously consuming a
bamboo tree. The great ape was so close that Campbell
and his five companions could hear every crunch.

As he stood enthralled, Campbell felt a heavy hand on
his shoulder. Expecting it to be one of his travel mates,
Campbell turned. only to find himself face to face with a
pair of luminous brown eyes set in a massive, black
patent~leather face.

The 300~pound silverhack, which had been patiently

waiting to pass, gently turned the tourist and slid by.

; mile-high mountains that straddle the borders of

'Rwanda, Zaire and Uganda in central Africa. Here live
nearly 300 of the worms 400 mountain gorillas. And here
exists a novel tourism industry aimed at preserving these
powerful, yet unaggressive. primates. '

Mountain gorillas are one of the most endangered
species on earth. There are no early figures on their
population. but from 1960 to 1981 their numbers in the
Virungas plummeted from about 500 to 242. (An
estimated 100 more live 15 miles north, in Uganda's
Impenetrable Forest.) .

The gorillas live in stable polygamous family groups
and have no natural enemies -— other than humans. .
48umans have usurped their habitat for farming, sold
them to zoos and research labs and murdered them to
5male sculptures with their skulls or ashtrays with their
thands.

During this decade, there has been a dramatic
turnaround in the sorry fate of these creatures,
particularly those living in Rwanda. Major credit for the
change goes to the Mountain Gorilla Project (MGP), a
consortium of international conservation organizations,
including the African Wildlife Foundation and the World
Wildlife Fund, working with the Rwandan government

The project, founded in 1979 and situated in the Parc
National des Volcans, which is Rwanda's corner of the
Virungas, combines three strategies for preserving the
apes. First, it provides regular patrols to catch poachers.
collect snares and monitor the gorilla population.
Second, it seeks to educate local people about
conservation. .

The third strategy is where Rob Campbell and his
tourist friends come in. The MGP has created a unique
“gorilla watching" tourism industry in Rwanda, which
has created‘a strong economic incentive for gorilla
protection in the country.

There is no doubt that Rwanda‘s commitment to the
program is rooted as much in money as in conservation.
Rwanda is the most densely populated country in Africa,
its 5.5 million people living within 10,000 square miles.
Ninety-five percent of its citizens are peasants, and the
country is an almost uninterrupted patchwork of
cultivated plots, except in the Parc National des Volcans.
With increased demand for farmland, nearly half of the
park was turned over to cultivation in 1973, reducing it to
about 46 square miles. In the late 19705, farmers living at
the base of the Virungas pressed to obtain even more of
the park.

“Researchers like myself and conservationists
familiar with the region knew that further human

left to protect. Fossey initiated the
first long-term study of these pri-
. mates in 1967, when she set up Kari-
] soke Research Station on the remote
. 10.000-foot-high saddle between
Karisimbe and Visoke mountains. A
biography by Farley Mowatt
(“Woman in the Mists”) describes
Fossey’s extraordinary research
and rancorous struggle to save the
species. Her efforts to protect them
. from poachers was heroic, at times
frantic. She once went so far as to
kidnap the son of a peacher and
burn the belongings of his family.

In 1977, after the brutal slaying of
Digit, a beloved gorilla that Fossey
had had contact with since his birth
10 years earlier, she launched the
Digit Fund, a successful internation-
al campaign to support antipoaching
foot patrols within the park: But
Fossey’s passion for the well-being
of the mountain gorilla was so in-
tense that she alienated other re-
searchers, locals, and park and gov-

ernment officials. On Dec. 28, 1985,.

she was murdered, and the Rwan-
dan government tried and convicted
in absentia her assistant, Wayne Mc-
Guire. It is speculated, however.

that she was killed by poachers or
by someone contracted by Rwandan
officials who saw her as a roadblock
to the lucrative gorilla tourism
industry.

Indeed, Fossey did not even en-
dorse the founding of the MGP, be-
cause she was concerned that its
multiple activities would divert at-
tention and funds from her single-
minded aim to halt poaching. Yet,
the MGP appears to have made a
profound contribution to Fossey’s
goal of gorilla preservation.

With the new Fossey biography

and Warner Bros. film about her‘

(starring Sigourney Weaver), grow-
ing numbers of tourists will no doubt
be drawn to Rwanda. Will increased
demand result in an exploitation of
the gorillas? “We won’t allow it,”
says Sholley. “Only six visitors are
allowed to visit each of the four go—
rilla groups for just one hour a
day. . .. Not that people don’t sug-

,gest abuse. At least twice a day I’m

asked to increase the size of the
tourist groups to seven. But I say no
because we can’t afford to de-
stroy the gorillas’ tranquillity.”

But, given the economic needs of
Rwanda and the tempting profitabil-
ity of gorilla-watching, there’s no
guarantee that Sholley won’t be cor-
nered into at least an occasional yes.
When recently pressed by the

 

Rwandan government to habituate a
fifth gorilla group for tourists, the
MGP staff complied. It did not, how-
ever, succeed in habituating the tar-
get group.

Beyond these pressures, there re-
main unstaved fears that contact
with humans could present grave
health problems for the gorillas.
Shirley McGrail, director of the In-
ternational Primate Protection
League in Summerville, SC, is con-
cerned about gorilla tourism as it is
now conducted, because “it is not

100 percent safe for the gorillas,

who are vulnerable to human para-

sites and viruses. Everyone visiting

them should be forced to wear face
masks and carry plastic bags to pick
up their own waste . . . and it should
be mandated that they bring evi-
dence that they have tested nega-
tively in the standard tuberculosis
test.”

Dr. Sy Kalter, a leading diagnosti-
cian of simian viruses in the United
States, corresponded with Fossey on
this very issue just before her death. ‘
“I’m in a very small minority
(among primatologists),” he says.
“but I’m against the tourism. If it
could be set up so observers were at
a distance, that would be one thing,
but this crawling around among the
gorillas at a close distance could
spell disaster.”

In April, 13 gorillas in one
group came down with colds, stir-
ring concern among the research-
ers. McMeekin of the African Wild-
life Foundation, who stays in close
touch with MGP staff, said, “It is not
likely that there is a connection be-
tween tourists and the gorillas’ sick-
ness. They always get colds at the
height of the rainy season, and this
year it has been unusually chilly
and very rainy.” She said the MGP
usually avoided giving medication
to the gorillas, but with such a sig-
nificant number ailing within one
group, two veterinarians were
called in to observe the gorillas and
dart them with antibodies. After-
ward, “they were carefully watched
for several days, and I received a
report that all of them are recover-
ing,” McMeekin said.

Clearly, tourists need to be edu-
cated about possible negative ef-
fects of their privileged association
with the mountain gorillas. Mean-
while, MGP’s effort to educate
Rwandans about conservation has
been highly effective. According to

Sholley. “In the early 19805, when
asked if it was important to save
(Parc des Volcans), 60 percent of
the public surrounding the park
said, ‘No, we want to use the land
for our (gardens).’ Now 70 percent
are adamantly in favor of saving the
park. They understand that it is
their water supply, their protection
against erosion, and that the gorilla
tourism has provided lots of jobs for
locals.”

The MGP’s antipoaching patrols
have also met with success. In the
decade before the creation of the
MGP (and the Digit Fund), about 15
gorillas a year were killed in Rwan-
da. Echoing Fossey’s efforts, MGP
and Rwandan park personnel
equipped and trained antipoaching
patrols that continue to thwart and
arrest poachers and to uncover
thousan’ds of snares. (Snares that
poachers set in the park to catch
small antelopes have long been per- ‘
ilous for gorillas.) Since 1983, not
one gorilla has been poached in
Rwanda, and the population there
has slowly begun to rise.

Scientists look to pollution as

By Joe Kirwin
Special to The Tribune

T JARNO, Sweden—Scientists at
the Swedish Marine Biology Labo—
ratory are trying to determine if
the AIDS-like virus that has killed
about half of Scandinavia’s harbor
sea? population this year is being
caused by man’s pollution of the
ocean.

“We know the seals are dying
from pneumonia,” said Tero Her-
konen, a marine biologist who has

devoted his life to researching thet

harbor seal and has unexpectedly
become a spemalist in the dynam—
ms of an envrronmental disaster.

“They start to hyperventilate,
their lungs expand and then they
ﬂoat like, a cork. Something is
wiping out their immune system.
Are pollutants in the water doing
that and making them susceptible
to a virus they have had all along,

or is it pollutants creating a virus
or mutations of Virus?”

In the past two months, Her—
konen and his assistants have
counted more than 3,000 seal car-
casses that were brought to the
dock at Tjarno for autopsy and
disposal. Many of the dead seals

were females carrying unborn seal
pups

At least 6,700 seals have been
killed in northern European waters
in an epidemic that was ﬁrst dc—
tccted in Denmark in mid-April.
Dead seals have been found on
Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, West
German and Dutch coz‘ists.

Swedish and Dutch scientists say

Harbor seals found floating in the North Sea are

belongs to, but that knowledge has
been insufﬁcient to determine the
origin of the malady. The virus
breaks down the seals’ immune
system, similar to how acquired
immune deﬁciency syndrome at.-
tacks humans.

“The most, important thing now

is to isolate the virus,” said Her—
konen, whose long hours of re-
search have left him with blood—
shot. eyes, unkempt. hair and a
haggard look. “To date, the virus
has been species speciﬁc. No other
animal or other species of seal has
been affected.“

ry in T'jarno, where autopsies will be performed to
try to ind the cause of a fatal, AIDS—like virus.

He said if it can be shown that
the virus is restricted to the harbor
seal population, then probably it is
a natural phenomenon. But. if the
virus is found in other species, he
said, then it likely is caused by
pollutants in the ocean.

So far, Herkonen said the virus

 




 

 

 

virus kills off seals

has been found only in harbor seals,
despite reports that gray seals had
died of it, too.

. It is diflicult to tell the difference
between the two specres, he said.

The deaths are unprecedented in
European waters, Herkonen said.

But last year the US. National
Marine Fisheries Service reported
that whales and hundred of bottle—
nosed dolphins were dying along the
United States’ Atlantic seacoast.

Scientists explored everything from‘

manmade pollution, to stress caused
by oceanside development, to the at-
mospheric warming known as the
greenhouse effect, but the cause of
the dolphin deaths remain unre—
solved. The whales died from eating
ﬁsh tainted with an oceangoing algae
known as red tide.

Herkonen said the viral epidemic
in Europe could not have come at a
worse time because this is when the
seals congregate to mate. Later this
month their susceptibility to disease
will increase because they molt, or
shed their skins.

“If this had only happened in the
winter or fall it would not have been
nearly as bad,” he said.

Research efforts are being carried
out on many shores of the North
Sea. For example, English biologists
have agreed to kill and perform au—
topsies on 30 seals from a harbor
seal colony of 25,000 they monitor
off the coast of Britain.

“You have to kill them because a
seal would drown” if shot by a tran—
quilizer dart, said Peder Agger, a
marine biologist in Denmark. “But
it is important to get the samples

from seals from North Sea waters
that have not been infected.”

ln Holland, where 50 seals already
are in captivity at the Dutch Reha—
bilitation Center, some biologists
have proposed capturing more seals
to protect them. But Swedish and
Norwegian biologists rejected the
idea, saying captivity could prolong
the problem.

“I can understand why they might
want to do it,” said Agger. “There
are only about. 1,000 seals left in
those waters. But keeping them out

of the wild and then putting them ..

back in could start the whole cycle
again.”

leni Hart, director of the, Dutch
Rehabilitation Center, said a vaccrne
has been administered to the seals
held there.

“It is an experimental vaccine we
developed here after an outbreak of
a herpes virus some years back,”
Hart said. “We hope it will save
these seals from the virus when we
re—release them. But there is no way
you could use this vaccine on seals
that are wild.”

Danish authorities have done ex—
tensive testing of the water where the
seals were ﬁrst found dead, but say
they have found no clues.

“That water is some of the clean~
est in the area,” said Arne Nilson,
director of the Marine Pollution
laboratory in Denmark.

“We have done very detailed anal-
yses on water samples, especially for
PCBs [polychlorinated biphenyls]
and heavy metals, and we haven’t
found any traces of those.”

LAUDERDALE LAKES ——- A
teen-ager is facing an animal cru-
elty charge after a Broward Sher-
iff’s Office deputy saw him strike a
dog repeatedly with a rolled towel,
a spokesman said'on Wednesday.

The 16-year-old suspect, who
lives in Lauderhill, told an investie
gator that a friend wanted him to
beat the dog to make the animal
mean, Sheriff’s Office spokesman
Al Gordon said.

Witnesses called authorities on
Tuesday to report that the animal
was being jabbed repeatedly with
something that resembled a mop
handle, said Sgt. Sherry Schlueter
of the Agricultural Crimes and Ani-
mal Abuse Unit.

The witnesses said the jabbing
had been going on for about 15 min-
utes in back of a home in the 3000
block of Northwest 43rd Terrace,
Schlueter said.

Deputy Mike Vadnal, watching
from a nearby home, saw the dog
struck in the head with a rolled
towel, Schlueter said.

“He was not playing. The dog

was being hit,” Schlueter said. “The
deputy said the dog would cry out
eyery time it was hit.”
”(t-The dog, named Ruff and de-
scribed as a German shepherd mix
about a year old, was taken into
protective custody, Gordon said.

He said the suspect is a friend of
the dog’s owner. Neither of their
names was released.

The teen-ager was released to
the custody of his parents, Gordon
said.

Animal cruelty is a first-degree
misdemeanor that carries a maxi—
mum penalty of one year in jail and
a $5,000 fine, Schlueter said.

taring at the monkeys and apes at the
Memphis Zoo is a fun house mirror
exercise in self-awareness:

There, but for the grace of a few
lucky turns on the evolutionary
family tree, go I.

The 36 inhabitants of the recently
reopened Primate House hold a strange
fascination for us because they appear to be
almost human. _

The De Brazza’s monkey is a wise and wizened
graybeard grandfather; Junior, the orangutan,
obese and slothful, is an indolent civil servant
who takes his own sweet time to acknowledge

 

with bigger arms and a somewhat smaller
vocabulary.

The Primate House closed in late April becaus
of seVeral cons-:11 action p1 ejects including root

and removal of asbeStos. It reopened last weekent

The most noticeable change, however, is the

addition of a long barrier, complete with
benches, tropical plants and informational
graphics, through the formerly wide-open middle
of the building '

Barbara Moses, curator of education, calls this

the “primate interpretive area.” Most zoo
em loyees call it "the salad bar. ”

Rick Pudwell, zoo curator of horticulture, 111en
added about 15 species of plants, embellished
with vines, lichen and Spanish moss.

“By building it in such a naturalistic way, it
kind of gives you a feel for a rain forest,” Ms.
Moses said. The wall also provides a natuml
pathway through the building for zoo visitors.

More noticeable to the Primate House’s full-
time inhabitants -- apes, tamarins, titis, lesnurs
and tree kangaroo (the building 3 lone no* 1-
primate), among others - are the changes in
their individual “homes.” Eacht :31hibit has; been
repainted, from a drab c1 eam to a deep, patterned
green that gives an impression of forest fol age.

blocs increasingly are breeding and preserving rare spe
cies The zoo association recently shipped endangered mynah
birds back to Bali, where development eroded the native rain
forests. Others: the return of black buck antelopes to Pakistan;
tamarin monkeys to Brazil; Arabian oryxes to Jordan.

“The new role of zoos is coming about because there are too
damn many people,” says William Conway, director of the
New York Zoological Society. “Within the next 20 or 30 years,
we will lose, at the very least, 20 percent of the remaining plant
and animal species on Earth’

And preserving them in zoos has meant a complete tum-
about from the days of cages. Virginia’s Busch Gardens set the
trend in 1965, opening a zoo that allowed animals to roam free
over 60 acres while visitors looked on from a monorail. But
after a generation of gradual progress, the movement caught
on in 1987 when 132 members of the zoo association spent
nearly $500 million building or renovating exhibits.

“School systems have to be continually revitalized, and the
same goes for zoological parks’ says Wagner. “The practices
acceptable in displays of wildlife in the ’BOs are no longer con-
sidered appropriate or acceptable today.”

Replacing the bars: moats and foliage-covered fences “Be-
fore, exhibits were arranged around people,” says Victoria
Furber of the Dallas Zoo. But animals will call the shots in
Dallas late next year when the 55-acre Wilds of Africa opens.

“This exhibit will allow people to see animals as themselves,
to see behavior they couldn’t see before,” Furber says. “It
promises the feeling of discovery.”

Another new-found mission for zoos: Educating the 110 mil-
lion annual visitors to the nation’s 140 zoos and aquariums.
“We’re taking a more aggressive role in presenting environ-
mental issues,” says Charles Hoeesle, director of the St Louis
Zoo. “We have to be very careful in managing our remaining
natural resources. We can do that by elevating the knowledge
of our young people.”

That has made zoo directors conscious about their own envi-
ronments. No one wants the embarrassment Atlanta went
through in 1984 after the Humane Society cited cases of a dead
baboon tossed in a city dump truck and Twinkles the elephant
dying while on loan to a roadside circus.

Mishaps and mismanagement also were problems at the
Central Park Zoo. “The old zoo was built in an unenlightened
way with cages with bars and tiled walls more in line of an
ofﬁce building.” says Richard Lattice, coordinator of the reno-
vation. Now, he says, “the only bar is the snack bar.”

Starting today, the public can watch white bearded colobus
monkeys leap among vines in the wild, sea lions dive oﬁ
chunks of arctic rock and Indian fruit bats ﬂy in a misty jungle.

Animals come in at night, and 24-hour guards patrol to avoid
the sort of tragedy that occurred last May in Brooklyn’s Pros-
pect Park 2.00. No polar bears mauled an 11-year-old boy to
death when he climbed into their cage after hours; the bears
were subsequently destroyed. “That will be physically impossi-
ble in the new zoo,” says city parks commissioner Henry Stern.

For zoo audiences, all this means putting a little more dis-
tance between themselves and the stars of the show. But that’s
OK, say the experts, because spectators are increasingly so-
phisticated. They don’t expect “cute.” They expect “freal’

“Many citizens have had the opportunity to travel abroad
and they’ve seen wildlife in its natural habitat,” says Wagner.
“They’re also watching more educational television.”

To keep pace, the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., has an
audio-visual program that teaches visitors to use eyes, ears and
sense of touch to experience the rain forest Dallas Zoo visitors
will study gorilla behavior in a research station with sound re-
ceivers, video cameras and electronic tracking devices.

Still, zoos aren’t giving up old standbys.

At the newly renovated Phoenix Children’s Zoo, kids still pet
goats and rabbits. In the educational playground, they climb a
lS-foot-wide rope spider’s web, and burrow like prairie dogs in
a tunnel. “There’s no reason education has to mean textbooks
and rulers across the knuckles,” says staffer Dick George.

As for the kids, well, they like the no—bars look just line. “I
felt so sorry for Willie B. when he was in a cage,” acknowl-

edges 10—year-old Scott Jones of Atlanta. And the added dis- .

tance apparently hasn’t stifled kids' powers of observation.
Notes Corey Oldknow, 9, watching Willie B. destroy bamboo
stalks: “He’s big and fat. and he’s got a punk rock haircut.”

idnapper sentenced to life
pit bulls put to sleep

By David York
Neighbor Staff Writer

Robert Wayne Harris was
sentenced to two consecutive life
sentences July 21 after being con-
victed by a DeKalb County jury of
eight counts of kidnapping, five
counts of armed robbery and two
counts of aggravated assault on a
police officer July 21.

DeKalb Superior Court Judge
Curtis Tilman sentenced Harris
after the three-day trial.

According to reports, Harris, 39,
used a semi-automatic machine gun
to rob the managers of two Burger
King restaurants and one Captain
D’s in South DeKalb last December
29. After robbing the victims, be
locked inside the freezers of each
restaurant.

Harris was able to flee after
shooting at two DeKalb County
uniformed patrol officers at point
blank range during a chase. Harris

after the incident occurred based on
a physical description provided by
the victims.

Fran W. Shoenthal prosecuted the
case for the state. Ms. Shoenthal
expressed satifaction with the jury
verdict and stated it was fair based
on the evidence that was presented.

Pit bulls ordered euthanized
after fatal mauling of todler

DeKalb County Superior Court
Judge Jonathan Peters has ordered
the humane extermination of eight
pit bull dogs belonging to Curry
Hobbs, whose ninth pit bull killed a
2-year-old child last March.

The DeKalb County District At-
torney’s Office had petitioned De-
Kalb Superior Court to have the dogs
destroyed because they proved a
danger and constituted a public
nuisance.

At an evidentiary hearing in June,

animal control officers, kennel
supervisors and investigators from
the DeKalb District Attorney’s Of-
fice. Evidence was presented that

the dogs were kept by Hobbs in *

voilation of DeKalb’s dangerous dog
ordinance, that there was evidence
that the dogs were being trained to
fight, and once impounded, the dogs
had repeatedly destroyed kennel
property and had killed several
other impounded dogs.

The dogs were exterminated July
20, the same day Judge Peters
ordered their destruction, said As-
sistant District Attorney John
Petrey.

Petrey said the District At-
torney’s Office was extremely
grateful that Peters recognized the
danger that Hobbs’ dogs proved to
the public.

“I have no doubt that because of
Judge Peters action, DeKalb County
is safer today than it was as long as

was apprehended about two hours

the court heard from police officers,

the dogs were alive,” he said.

oman Charged With Cruelty to Animals

By JAMES RAINEY, Times Staff Writer

Five misdemeanor counts have
been filed against a Hawthorne
woman accused of keeping a yard
full of malnourished and lice-in-
fested animals, which authorities
suspect were to be used in religious
sacrifices.

Catalina Sierra, 55, will be ar-
raigned Aug. 15 in Inglewood Mu-
nicipal Court on charges of animal
cruelty and illegally keeping barn-
yard animals in a residential neigh-
borhood. If convicted of all counts,
she could be sentenced to up to four
years in jail, Hawthorne Assistant
City Atty. Ronald Pohl said.

Agents for the Society for Pre~
vention of Cruelty to Animals said

Sierra’s yard on Imperial Highway ‘

appeared to be the scene of sacri-
fices for Santeria, a secretive Afro—
Cuban folk religion that is increas-
ingly evident in the Ice Angeles
area.

But Sierra said in an interview
that she is not a practitioner of
Santeria, and that her entrants were
well cared for.

Police raided Sierra’s home last

month after neighbors complained

to the SPCA about a foul smell and
flies hovering around the back
yard. SPCA investigators seized 22
chickens, two goats, a piglet, a
lamb, two cockateels and a parrot.
Sierra also removed 50 pigeons and
doves from the home .

The animals’ pens contained no
food or water or had water contam-
inated with feces and algae, Whet-
stone said. The yard contained
feathers, goatskins, blood and other
evidence of animal slaughter, she
said.

The home is listed in the tele-
phone directory as a botanica, a
type of religious curio shop that
often caters to Santeria devotees.

But Sierra said that the home is
not a botanica and that she kept the
animals for milk and food.

Pohl said the case does not hinge
on the intended use of the animals.
“People are free to believe what-
ever they believe,” he said.
“Whether this is religiously moti-

vated I don’t know, but for the

purposes of this prosecution it does

' not matter."

Sierra was charged with violat-

ing two state laws, one that re-
quires adequate care for penned
animals and another that prohibits
mutilation of domesticated animals

She also faces three counts of
violating the Hawthorne Municipal
Code by keeping more than 24
birds, keeping domesticated ani-
mals within 35 feet of a property
line and failing to maintain a clean
environment for animals.

Citing an increase in the discov-
ery of disﬁgured and slaughtered
animals, the Los Angeles Board of
Animal Regulation has scheduled a
hearing Monday on an ordinance—-
aimed at Santeria followers—that
would outlaw ritual animal sacri-i
fices. .

Santeria devotees have chalé.

'lenged a similar law in Hialeah,

F1a., saying that the ordinance
violates their First Amendment
right to freely practice their relia
gion.

Santeria priests, called Santeros,
say animals are kept and sacriﬁced
humanely, and that the rituals are
no worse than the commercial
slaughter of livestock.

DEKALB NEWS/SUN - August 10, 1988

SPCIy/ Neuter Plan Set For Septlw

The DeKalb Board of Commis-
sioners’ spay and neuter policy for
animals adopted from DeKalb’s
Animal Control Center takes effect
Sept. 1.

DeKalb will provide a spay/neu-
‘ter certificate with each pet
adopted from animal control on
and after that date. '

Participating veterinarians will

_ honor the certiﬁcate within six
months of the adoption at no
4 charge.
. “Everyday, unwanted puppies
1 and kittens are born because pet
5 owners fail to have their animals
spayed or neutered,” DeKalb’s
Chief Executive Officer Manuel
Malcof said. “Our new policy will
encourage people adopting pets
from animal control to be responsi—
ble pet owners and have this done
to their dog or cat.”

Every year, over seven and a
half million animals die because of
over population, according to the
Humane Society of the United
States. More than 70,000 puppies
and kittens are born each day.

Capt. Harry Wood, commander
of DeKalb" Animal Control, said
8,379'of the 13,121 dogs and cats
- handled by the animal control cen-
ter in 1987 were euthanized.

“Pet over population is not the
sole responsibility of animal con-
trol,” Maloof said. “It is everyone’s
responsibility.” ' ‘

“If just the several thousand
animals adopted each year in De-
Kalb County are spayed and neu-
tered, it will drastically reduce the
number of unwanted animals that
are born only to die,” Maloof said.

Estimates from the Humane So-

ciety of the United States support
Maloof’s position. In just six years,
one female dog and her offspring
can produce 67,000 puppies and in

seven years a female cat and her
offspring can produce 420,000 cats,
he said. ' ,.

“Pet owners who have already
paid for the spay or neuter proce-
dure ,are more likely to follow

through and have the procedure

done,” Wood said.

The adoption fees are $66 for a
female dog, $61 fora male dog, $56
for a female cat and $36 for a male
cat. The cost of the spay/neuter
service is included in the adoption
fee according to Capt. Wood.

Commissioners also created a
new position of Adoption Clerk for

Animal Control. In addition to‘ '1

handling the paper work on adop-
tions, this employee will counSel
owners about personality traits
and health needs of their new pets.

DeKalb Animal Control Officers
are undergoing extensive training
through the Humane Society of the
United States (HSUS). 'Training
includes shelter management, re-
port writing, testifying in court
cases and other areas related to

Animal Control operations. ‘
“By next year, all officers will
have received HSUS training,”
Wood said. _ '
“This will greatly beneﬁt ani-
mals and DeKalb citizens,” Maloof
said.
“DeKalb will have groundbreak-
ing in September for a new animal
center. The new facility will house
twice as many animals as the
present center. It’s design will pro-
vide better facilities for the 500
animals it can accommodate. “All
of this is good news for animal

lovers,”g_M€=llOOf said. _ _ . ,,.:~,_. ‘2.

Sea Lion Found.
Shot to Death
At S.F.. Shore

By Harriet ,Chiang
Chronicle Stqﬂ' Writer

A sea lion was found shot to
death yesterday at San Francis- ‘
eo’s Fort Funston, the seventh
marine mammal discovered
killed in the Bay Area in the

‘ past six weeks.

Most of the animals have been
killed by shotgun blasts, some shot
four or five times, said Raymond t
Deiter, a Sausalito veterinarian who F
has conducted extensive research
on marine mammals. Two of the sea '
lions were decapitated.

. “It’s a senseless act, it’s an'irra-
tional act,” said Deiter. “All we need
is a witness.”

The first of the seven marine

‘ mammals was found shot to death

at Stinson Beach on June 22.

Usually by this time of year,
two or three are found slain, Deiter .
said. All have been killed with a
shotgun, except for one found on

.Wednesday at Ocean Beach, which
‘ was shot with a .22—caliber gun and

then decapitated. ‘

l Ari Audience‘in Congress

, Life Patents:
Doubts Are
Registering

 

By KEITH SCHNEIDER

 

WASHINGTON
HE House Judiciary Committee struck. a
compromise between farmers and the bio-
technology industry last week when it de-
cided that, in most instances, new forms of
animals can be treated like mechanical inventions
and patented. In deciding that farmers should be elit-
empted from paying royalties on the off spring of t e
patented livestock they buy, and in speCifically stat-
ing that humans should not be patented, the commit-
' tee sent a strong signal that cultural, moral and ethi-
cal considerations are important factors in drawing
up legislation to regulate new biological technologies.
The legislation now movgs tto thgélouse and Senate,
te could come in ep em .
and ii‘Tlci’ere is broad apprehension in the farm com-
munity, in the religious community and in othercom-
munities about developments in biotechnology, said
Representative Robert W. Kastenmeier, a.\I_isconsm
Democrat and chairman of the HouseuJudICiary sub-
committee that considers patent law. In some cases
it is fear over what kinds of organisms Will be
produced. In other cases it issuspiCion about who
really benefits. There is a coalition out there that is
making its presence felt in Congress. .
The committee‘s deciSion stems from a policy
established in April 1987 by the United States Patent
and Trademark Office to grant patents to inventors
of “nonnaturally occurring nonhuman multicellular
living organisms, including animals. In April 1983,
the patent office determined that a mouse geneti—
cally engineered for use in cancer research was a
“composition of matter” and a ’product of human
ingenuity,” and issued the world s first animal pat-
ent to two researchers at Harvard Medical School.
Both decisions brought protests from a coalition
of religious leaders, animal rights groups, fart?
groups and environmentalists such as Jeremy Ri -
kin, president of the vFoundation on Economic
Trends, 3 Washington-based public policy group. _
“Patenting higher forms of New“ essentially
allow multinational corporations to literally own and
control entire ,animal gene pools, from apes to in-
sects,” said Mr. Rifkin. “It Will reduce all animals. to
matter for manipulation. And it enables companies
to define the genetic blueprints of all livmgthings as
their own property. It is a profound change in how we

regard animals.”

From Plants to Animals

' ' ' fficials
Biotechnology industry executives and o .
of the Patent Office, however, believe patenting am-

mals such as pigs that grow faster and leaner, is not _

' to new territory. In 1930 Congress passed the

311:3? gatent Act, enabling breeders of trees, roses

and other plants that reproduce through cuttings to

protect their developments In 1970, Congress exci

tended protection to new varieties of wheat, cornéirin
other crops that reproduce through seeds. An .

1980, by a 5-to-4 vote, the SupremeVCourt ruled that
microorganisms transformed through artificial
manipulation of their genetic codes could also be pat—
ented. “Patenting animals is a logical extension of

growth hormones
that make them
bigger and leaner.

 

Edison Center/Ohio University

previous policies,” said Donald J. Quigg, Assistant‘
Secretary of Commerce and Commissioner of Pat-
ents.

The conflict over patenting animals and other
developments in biotechnology, however, is far from
. resolved. Many farmers, who worry that animal pat-
ents might enable large companies to control live-
stock agriculture, supported a bill introduced by
Representative Charlie Rose, Democrat of North
Carolina, that would have prevented the patent office
from issuing animal patents for two years. Last

; ‘ week, the Judiciary Committee defeated Mr. Rose’s

legislation. Farmers also support the legislation that
exempts them from having to pay royalties on the
offspring of patented livestock. Royalty payments,
they argue, would be an expensive departure from
usual practices in which farmers pay breeders for
adult animals or for stud services, and then are free}.
to produce and sell offspring without additional fees.

Biotechnology industry executives and many
molecular biologists believe such concerns are mis-
placed. Genetic engineering, they say, will help farm-
ers raise productivity, and big and small farmers
will benefit equally. And they argue that biotech-
nology companies are entitled to royalties from in-
ventions that in many cases cost millions of dollars to
develop. '

The battle over animal patenting now moves to
the Federal court in San Francisco where several ,
animal welfare organizations and a Wisconsin farm
group brought suit last month against the patent of-
fice, contending that patenting animals is illegal. The
patent office has not responded to the suit.

“Congress never intended that animals should
be viewed as compositions of matter under the pat-
ent law," said Steven M. Wise, an attorney from Bos-
ton and president of the Animal Legal Defense Fund,
an animal welfare group.“ ‘fAnimals are sentient,

; have consciousness, and are far above mere compo-
sitions of matter.” . 1 ,

threatens Britain

A DEADLY virus that is
wiping out North Sea
-harbour seals is feared
to have reached British
waters.

Some experts predict
that'at least four in five—-
and possibly all—seals in
affected areas will die of
the disease within the next
few months.

More than 5,000 dead

seals have been washed up
on beaches from Denmark
to the Netherlands since
the ﬁrst deaths were
reported in March. The
true death toll is believed
to be far higher as many
bodies will not have been
recovered.

Marine biologists had
hoped the virus would not
spread across the North
Sea because prevailing cur-
rents sweep away from Bri-
tain. Now it is feared to
have reached the Wash,
where 7,000 harbour seals
form the largest concentra-
tion of the animals in Euro-
pean waters. _ .

Last week, eight dead
seal pups were washed up
on a beach at Snettisham,
Norfolk—the cause of
death unknown, but sus-
pected to be the virus.

At a sanctuary in King’s
Lynn, Norfolk, 25 out of 29
young seals have died in
the three weeks since a pup

dentified viral illness. The

tracted the same disease
and are unlikely to live.

Although the symptoms
are slightly different from
those recorded in the Con-
tinental seals, Mr Allan
Giles, who with his wife

by SIMON DE BRUXELLES

Brenda has run the sanctu-
ary in his back garden for
13 years, said: ‘We have
never seen anything like
this. The last three weeks
have been a nightmare.

‘It looks like the mortal-
ity rate is going to be 100
per cent. Although the pups
that died had been brought
to us with other problems
and were already weak, the
effect on the wild popula-
tion could be devastating.

‘We have been nursing
them 22 hours a day. Once
the seals become ill, they
lose interest in food and
have to be tube fed.’

Other symptoms include
lethargy, boils and erup—
tions on the ﬂippers, and
severe coughing.

The only uninfected seal
pup, a recent arrival suf-
fering from dehydration, is
kept in ‘isolation’ in the
back of a derelict Peugeot
estate car. Although still
weak, the contrast with the
sick seals—coughing and

be greater.

Blood samples from the
Norfolk seals are being
analysed by scientists at
the Amsterdam University
to discover whether they
contain the same viruses
believed to have been
responsible for the deaths
so far of a third of the Ger-
man, Dutch and Scandina-
vian populations of seals.

Mr John Hammond, of

the Government—fu nded
Sea Mammal Research
Unit, said: ‘The disease

spread far too quickly for it
to have passed directly
from seal to seal. If it is
carried in the water, British
seals may escape for a
while because of the direc-
tion of the prevailing cur- .
rents. However, if it is
spread on the feet of sea
birds, as we suspect, we
will see the same cata-
strophic effects here.’

Scientists have isolated
two potential culprits, a
herpes virus and another
known as picorna.

Mr Hammond said: ‘One
of our difficulties is that we
know very little about what
viruses occur naturally in
seals. The herpes virus
appears to be quite wide‘
spread. The picorna virus
is new but it may just be
that no one has isolated it
before.’

Environmentalists and
many scientists believe the
seals’ resistance to viral
infection has been weak-
ened by pollution, particu-
larly from Britain, which
alone amon North Sea
countries st' l dumps sew-
age sludge at sea.

 

 

 




HOUSTON POST - August 20, 1988

New Mexico gets contract
to run federal horse refuge

By Kathy Kiely
POST WASHlNGTON BUREAU

WASHINGTON —— If not for the
one flaw that ruins it all, Dee Dee
King would be a classic American
success story.

The Texas horsewoman is a
model entrepreneur. She found
something she loved to do and

 

D Felton West/page 2E

 

turned it into a thriving business.
She created jobs for seven people
—- including a former resident of a
homeless shelter.

She’s enthusiastic and hard-
working. She gets good marks
from her clients and her customers.
Most likely they’ll all miss her.

Because come the end of next

; month, the seven people who work
at Tex—King £30. are going to be out

of jobs and King is going to be
trying to come up with a way to
stay out of bankruptcy.

Basically, it’s all thanks to the
fickleness of Uncle Sam.

For the last 2% years, King has
operated a horse adoption center in
Williamson County, just north of
Austin, for the federal government.
Her assignment: To find good
homes for some of the thousands
of horses rounded up from public
lands each year by the US. Depart-
ment of Interior’s Bureau of Land
Management.

It would be hard to find a more
enthusiastic government contrac-
tor. “I eat breathe and sleep wild
horses,” said King. “I was out the
other day from 7 am. till 11 at
night.” Losing the contract she
worked so hard to get and make

 

l.

good on is going to hurt her more
than just financially.
, miéing got the bad news at the end
of June.
It wasn’t that the government
Sf’didn’t like the way she was han-
ﬁdling the horses. “We have no
complaints. There’s nothing wrong
with what she’s doing,” said Lee
Keesling, a spokesman for the Bu—
reau of Land Management’s New
:Mexico office, which oversees
jKing’s contract.
e It Was just that the BLM found a
Contractor if preferred.
The. New Mexico prison system.
Beginning Oct. 1, horses that are
"going to be put up for adoption in
the four—state region supervised by
theNew Mexico BLM office will be
shipped to one of three New Mexi-

co state penitentiaries. King’s Lib- _

erty Hill adoption center —— the
only federal horse adoption center
in Texas — will be closed.

BLM officials say they will be
able to find more horses homes by
ietting New Mexico convicts break
in large numbers of the animals.
But King charges she was rooked
out 9f her contract — which had
one more year to run —- by politi—
cal cronyism. _

l,
l
l

: sﬁhe says New Mexico Gov. Gar—
rey’éarruthers, a former assistant
secretary at the Department of In—
terior, and Rep. Bill Richardson, D-
Santa Fe, twisted arms at Car—
ruthers’ old shop to get the wild
11¢ng ~.money moved to the New
Mexico prison system.

Carruthers’ office won’t com-
ment, other than to say that the
gqjegnor is “supportive” of the
prison program, but Richardson
pleads guilty as charged.

__.T.he. congressman said he ap-
proached Robert Burford, director
of the BLM, on behalf of a constitu-
ent,’ David Salazar, whose new
technique for constructing walls
out of adobe is being used to build
horse corrals in the New Mexico

‘ prisons.

Richardson said he was sorry if
his efforts to help a constituent hurt
someoneelse. “I didn’t know it
took a contract away from some-
one else,” he said. He also suggest—
ed that Carruthers —- a Republican.
— deserved most of the credit for
cmivincing the BLM to move the
wild horses from Texas to New
Mexico.

i know the governor of New
Arnie helped . . . and he’s proba-
e got more stroke with Bob Bur,
frrrr.’ than i do.” Richardson said.

, 21+ BLM’s sudden decision has
lattracied the attention of the Gen—
eral Accounting Office. The con-
gressional watchdog agency, which
is in the process of investigating a
number of questions surrounding
BLM’s management of the wild
horse program, has added the New
Mexico prison program to its list,
according to GAO official Carolyn
Kirby.

. “It’s a big thing they’ve gotten
into, with a lot of horses in a short
period of time,” said Kirby. She
added that the GAO has heard
‘some complaints about the condi-
tiojns of horses” that have been
Coming out of the prisons.

. But BLM officials contend that
the pilot programs they have run at
prison facilities in New Mexico and
Colorado have been smash suc-
cesses, giving them every reason to
believe they would work on a larg-
er scale.

, BLaM is going to pay New Mexico
corrections officials more to take
care of the horses than it did King
— $225,000 a year, compared
with Tex-King Co.’s fee of
$197,000 — but officials say they
will end up getting more bang for
their buck because they will be
able to move more horses through
the prison system.

The BLM rounds up about 6,000
animals a year in an effort to keep
the public range from being over-
grazed and has been grappling
with enormous backlogs in its
“Adopt-A-Horse” program.

Keesling insisted that the horse
adopting public is not going to be
inconvenienced by the BLM’s deci-
sion. He said BLM will continue to
hold f“satellite” adoptions ——-
events where it trucks horses and
burros into towns and fairgrounds
—— throughout Texas, Kansas,
Oklahoma and New Mexico, the
four states covered by the New
Mexico office.

_ Meanwhile, King is left holding
an $88,000 bag. That’s how much
is left to pay on the bank loan King
and her husband took out back in
1986, when they won what they
thdught would be a four-year con-
tract.~

They used the money to build
corrals and holding pens, and to

buy pickup trucks and trailers to
take the horses to satellite adop—
tions.

King said she questioned BLM
officials closely about the clause in
her contract that said the govern-
ment had an option to renew or not
to renew each year but was assured
it would never be exercised unless
the Congress failed to come up
with money for the wild horse pro-
gram or King did a bad job.

“I was told over and over again
that it was a technicality,” King
said, “They soothed my fears, my
lawyer’s fears, my banker’s fears.”

Now she Wishes they hadn’t
been so easily allayed. “I feel abso—
lutely helpless,” said King. “These
people have done things to my life,
my business and my finances that I
have absolutely no control over
and that I have done nothing to
deserve.”

King’s congressman, Rep. Mar-
vin Leath, D-Marlin, has ques—
tioned BLM on the matter but
Leath aide Doug Canatsey fears
there’s little that can be done even

though “she legitimately has a beef i
with BLM.”

Canatsey says there’s no ques— !
tion BLM had a legal right to cancel i
its agreement with King. “Whether ‘
it’s ethically or morally proper I’m ,

not so sure,” he added.

Recently, neighboring Republi- *
can congressman Mac Sweeney .
weighed in, suggesting in a letter ‘
to Burford that the agency’s move '

violated a principle the Republican
Party holds dear -— the promotion

of free enterprise. Sweeney’s letter, .
which questions why BLM “elected ,

to suddenly end an agreement with
an independent businesswoman
and transfer her contract to two
government bureaucracies,” still
has not received a response.

At her Liberty Hill property, ’

meanwhile, King already has start-
ed to lay off employees.

“You know how we see it out
here,” she said. “Convicted felons
in New Mexico get rehabilitative
training and seven hard-working,
tax—paying citizens of Texas get
unemployment.”

Politics and animals

 

 

Regarding the article “Bangkok gov-
ernor is dog’s best friend,” July 20: I
would like to commend Bangkok on its
choice of a governor and the implemen-
tation of a kind, creative program to
assist the city’s homeless dogs.

Gov. Chamlong Srimuang’s compas-
sion and progressive ideals are qualities
that citizens of every country should
strive for in themselves and their lead-
ers. As Mohandas Gandhi said, “The
greatness of a nation and its moral prog-
ress can be judged by the way its ani-
mals are treated.”

As a country whose animal “shel-
ters” are selling many homeless animals
to laboratories where they’ll be used in
painful toxicity tests, radiation experi-
ments, and other such research, the US
must emulate Governor Chamlong and
his policies.

With today’s technology and knowl—
edge, there is no need to harm or kill
other beings for our survival, comfort,
or entertainment.

The article about Governor Cham-
long was refreshing and uplifting.

It is admirable to see someone who
applies his moral convictions to political
life. I respect Governor Chamlong’s eth-

ics, which are expansive enough to in-
clude the animals. '

as buck passes

By Claire Martin
Denver Post Staff Writer

BOULDER — The deer materialize at dawn and
twilight, deliberate and unafraid, stately as royalty as
, they pick their way past parked cars and over mani-
, cured lawns, heading for Boulder’s ﬂower beds and
' vegetable gardens.

They especially like roses, tulips and raspberries,
but cheerfuny eat almost everything elSe, too. To the
approximately 1,116 mule deer living in Boulder’s
mountain parks and open space areas — and now
even in the city itself - Boulder’ 8 back yards are a
24- hour buffet.

Nearly everyone in town once considered this
charming, evidence of the rapport with wildlife in a
town with a reputation for being aggressively consci-
entious. Boulder is the sort of place where animal

rights groups picket restaurants that serve veal,

' where rescue groups recently captured and relocated
600 prairie dogs from the University of Colorado cam-
pus, rather than kill them.

Reaches council agenda

But complaints from residents, many furious over
their ruined gardens, have convinced the City Council
to take up the deer isSue. Next Tuesday, the council

will consider a number of options, ranging from relo- 1'
cating the deer - expensive, at $400 per deer, and 1111-7

likely to succeed with an 80 percent mortality proba—
bility — to killing the deer and donating the venison to
food banks.

Brian Peck, a ranger and naturalist With Boulder

tory -- the town is built on several ancient deer mi-
gration routes — and in part to the deer’s discovery
that the fodder in suburban gardens is tastier than
the mountain mahogany and wild grasses in the foot- ’
hills.

Few threats up to now

Aside from car-deer accidents - approximately
160 road-killed deer were found within city limits last
year — the deer have been unthreatened. Mountain

used to put out food and salt licks to attract them, un-
til 1985 when the City Council passed a law forbidding
citizens to feed deer.

Even so, pickings are so good that many deer have
quit the foothills and canyons to move permanently to
town. They are common in the Table Mesa and Gun-
barrel neighborhoods, where they shelter under
decks and in the bushes of carefully landscaped
yards.

“When we started studying the deer m 1982, we
thought of them as seasonal and transient, but it
seems we have a resident population now, having,
fawns in people’s back yards and sleeping under
decks,” said Laurie Kuelthau, state Department of

Disaster strikes '
puffins and skuas
in the Shetlands

By Robert Reid, Scottish Correspondent

THE SHETLAND ISLANDS, one of the three most
important areas for breeding seabirds in Europe, have . ' ' j -— 2% ~-.; 1;? .-
suffered their worst season on record. “It is an unprec- “‘ " ‘ “ ' ' ' Red-throated -, if: ‘

 

A»,

\.

edented disaster,” the Royal Society for the Protection , i" i' - " .:: x Diver E

of Birds said yesterday.

Ornithologists are calling
for urgent discussions with
the Government over the
threat to such species as
puﬂins, Arctic terns, Arctic
skuas and red-throated
divers in the islands.

They say that numbers in
several colonies are becoming
dangerously low.

The RSPB may demand a Shet-
lands ban on the ﬁshing of sand
eels—staple diet of many of the
birds affected—in the hope of
arresting the accelerating
decline before it is too late.

It is not known for certain why
the million-plus seabirds in
Britain’s most northerly archi-
pelago have had such a calami-
tous season, but RSPB experts
fear that overﬁshing may be the
main cause, with adult birds
unable to ﬁnd enough ﬁsh to feed
theiryoung.

Most great skua chicks on the
island of Foula, the world’s larg-
est colony, have died—a fate
that Arctic terns throughout
Shetland have been suffering for
ﬁve years.

An estimated 41 per cent of the.
British and Irish population of
Arctic terns is found in Shetland.

The largest colony, on Papa
Stour, had 6,000 birds in 1980,
but has plummeted to only 1,500
this year, with no young reared.
It is estimated that the total
Shetland population may have
declined by as much as 70 per
cent from its 1980 figure of
32,000 pairs.

Mr Peter Ellis, Shetland
officer of the RSPB, said: “Fail-
ures on this scale have never
been witnessed in UK waters
before. -

“Colonies which normally
have thousands of chicks now
hold only a handful.”

The RSPB describes the toll as

follows:
OArctic skua—The Shetland
population in 1986 was 1,912
pairs, 61 per cent of the British
population. Monitoring at 10 col-
onies has shown that few young
have been reared this year.

0 Kittiwake — N 0 chicks have
survived at any colonies on Shet-
land’s east, south or southwest
coasts. Complete breeding fail-
ure was noted at the major colo-

 

nies of Noss (10,000 pairs),

Sumburgh Head (2,000 pairs) _

and Foula (4,400 pairs).

OPuffin—Records at Herma-
ness National Nature Reserve,
where there were around 25,000
pairs last year, indicate large-
scale breeding failure this year.
On Foula (around 48.000 pairs).
breeding failure is “almost
total”.

0 Red-throated Diver — Shet-
land has some 700 pairs, which is
70 per cent of the United King—
dom population. 0n the islands
of Unst and Yell, which together
have 55 per cent of the Shetland
total, chick production is some
50 per cent lower than normal.
That makes it the worst breeding
season since monitoring began
in 1980.

.Arctic terns—The Shetland

population in 1980 was 52.000 .

pairs, some 41 per cent of the

British and Irish total. Wide—

spread breeding failure has been
noted every year since 1984 and
it is feared this number may be
down by as much as 70 per cent.

0 Great skua wShetland’s 5,647
pairs two years ago accounted
for 76 per cent of the British pop-
uiation and 43 per cent of the
entire northern hemisphere pop.
ulation. On Foula, where most
chicks have starved to death, the
few survivors are in poor
condition.

So far the guillemot, cormo-
rant, shag and gannet popula—
tions appear to be unaffected by
the crisis.

Investigations ﬁnanced jointly
by the RSPB and the Nature Con-
servancy Council are being con-
ducted by Glasgow University to
establish whether overfishing
can be conﬁrmed as the main
factor in the decline.

Researchers in Norway have
already concluded that
dwindling sand eel stocks are the
reason for the breeding failure of
large numbers of pufﬁns and
razorbills in their waters.

The sand eels are harvested
for processing into ﬁsh meal and
feed pellets for poultry and ﬁsh
farming, and have been commer-

Fur seals return to
Australian islands

By Geoffrey Lee Martin in Sydney

FUR SEALS are returning to the sub-Antarctic islands
south of Australia after being almost wiped out during
sealing operations last century. A survey on Heard
Island, 2,500 miles south west of Perth, has disclosed a
record 15,000 seals, including 248 pups.

. 7‘ Although a few fur seals
began returning to the island
40 years ago, none was
1’ known to have bred there
until 1965, when two pups
were observed suckling.

, By 1980 some 4,500 seals,
. including 46 pups were counted.

However, other wildlife counts
were less encouraging. There
were falls in both the elephant
seal population and the Colony of
giant petrels.

Australian scientists say the
relatively few seal pu‘ps on the
‘ island suggests that adults have
i been coming from more remote
islands where populations are
recovering more rapidly.

Adelie penguin and crabeater
seal populations are also
increasing. '

“It seems that fur seals are
exploding in numbers, particu-
larly in the South Atlantic,” said
Mr Harry Burton, the survey-
leader and a senior research sci- '
entist with Australia’s Antarctic
Division.

5 “We think we’re dealing with
; migrants from that region, but
‘ that’sjustabelief.”
‘* Many scientists believe the
« explosion of fur seals may be
associated with the destruction
, of southern whale stocks, which
has freed vast amounts of food.
However, they predict that
severe population adjustments
are likely to occur as the south-
ern whales build up their num-
bers again. .
Some have even suggested
that seal culling might he needed
: to allow the whales to rev over.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 




DALLAS TIMES HERALD — July 30, 1988

Man’s way
with Cheetahs
matter of life

By Tom Boone
or THE TIMES HERALD STAFF

GLEN ROSE —— It is almost like
hypnosis as Kelley Snodgrass ap—
proaches the cheetah, Cimmarah, with
a hypodermic needle in hand. He
speaks softly, moves slowly, grasps the
big cat by the tail and tugs.

Cimmarah’s 85-pound body relaxes
as his hind quarters are pulled gently
to the edge of the steel enclosure. He
exhibits no response.

“It’s almost as though he goes into a
trance,” Snodgrass says.

The 27—year-old assistant manager of
the Fossil Rim Wildlife Ranch, a
breeding and research facility for exot-
ic animals near this town on the north-
ern edge of the Texas Hill Country, is
almost as lean and graceful as the
creatures that have come to dominate
his attention and his interest.

Cimmarah has diabetes, a rare con-
dition among Cheetahs, and perhaps is
the only big cat in the country that
needs and receives insulin injections
every day.

“His muscle tone isn’t what it should
be because of the diabetes,” Snodgrass
says. “He ought to weigh about 115
pounds.” .

,For two years, ever since pancreati-
tis destroyed the cat’s ability to pro-
duce its own insulin, Snodgrass has re—

peated the routine that has cre—
ated a close but still cautious re-
lationship between man and
beast.

The 23 Cheetahs inside the
wire enclosure recognize his
brown pickup when it arrives.
They know it means breakfast,
consisting of a whole plucked
chicken, which Snodgrass tosses
to each animal. Cimmarah, who
shares a fenced area with two fe—
males, Rachel and Cami, can ex-
pect something more.

Snodgrass lures the cheetah in-
to a cage with an offering of
ground horse meat, in which are
mixed pancreatic enzymes Cim—
marah cannot produce on his
own. Once secured inside by a
sliding door that Snodgrass low-
ers with a rope, Cimmarah bares
his fangs and emits deep guttural
noises. Finally he lies down.

Snodgrass moves closer, speak-
ing quietly, and reaches through
the cages framework _to take the
cheetah by the tail. Cimmarah al-

lows a hind leg to be pulled out—

side the cage, where Snodgrass
first inserts a syringe. Through
the proceedings, the cat does not
flinch.

“He’s taking blood to test his

blood glucose level,” says Dr. Ev— .-

an Blumer, the ranch's newly ar- ,
rived staff veterinarian, who '
watches the procedure and open-

~1-

ily marvels at. the way Snodgrass

deals with his animals.

“The success of this program is
directly related to Kelley,” Blu—
mer says, referring to the ranch's
3-year—old cheetah breeding pro—
gram. “He’s amazing. You know,
he never gives them a piece of
meat that he doesn’t smell ﬁrst.
I’ve never seen anybody do that,
even” '.

Snodgrass responds: “I’m para-
noid. I just don’t want them to
eat some bad meat.”

His intense care of the chee—
tahs —- he puts flea powder on a
litter of cubs ever other day, for
instance —— has resulted in some
startling successes. Infant mortal-

ity is high amon Cheetahs in

.I'captix'ity, approaching 50 peze
ﬁcent. Snodgrass says. But the
'Fossi] Ri:.. . 2:353," in: only a;
handful of cubs in the three
years it has reared. them.

And while Cheetahs have diffi—
culty breeding in captivity, three
females on the ranch have pro—
duced litters recently, and anoth-
er female is expected to deliver
this week.

The Cheetahs, like the 1,000 or
so other animals on the ranch,
are available for trades or “loans“
(which are sometimes perma-
nent) to zoos around the country.
They also can be seen by visitors
who, for a fee, can drive the 9-
mile stretch through the wooded,
hilly ranch.

Snodgrass says he feels a rap-
port with his cats that is greater
than that for any of the other 21
species of animals he works with.

“It gives you a chill up and
down your spine just. to see them
run.” he says.

NATIONAL ENQUIRER - August 16, 1988

Birdwaman or Brook/y
She Nurses Thousands of Sick, Injured
Or Abandoned Birds

 

They call Hanna Richard the
Birdwoman of Brooklyn -— each
year more than 1,000 birds are
dropped off at her door, and she
helps return them to the wild.

In the past 12 years Hanna has
rescued countless lost ducks .
saved numerous confused owls
trapped inside buildings . . . and
raised untold thousands of baby
birds whose nests were disrupted.

"We’re a halfway house for
birds!” says Hanna, 52, who is
\Ucensed as a wild bird rehabilita-
tor by the state.

“There’s always an extra box
or something to put a bird in. .
Sometimes I’ll get up in the
morning and there will be a -'
box by the back door with a bird in
it that someone drapped off.”

It was 14 years ago that Hanna
started caring for stray birds as a
hobby —- but soon it became an ob.
session. Before long she got her li-
cense to care for them, and she and
her hubby Artie turned their back-
yard into a big-city bird refuge.

The 25- by 35—foot yard is filled
with several large cages, including
one seven-foot-high enclosure, built
around an evergreen tree, espe-
cially for owls.

“ ne time we got a call about a

Hanna’s husband Artie, 53, has
his own bird care specialty -- he
sneaks orphaned baby owls into the
nests of surrogate owl moms in the
wild.

“The parents usually leave when
we approach, so then we stick a cou-
ple more babies in,” said Artie, who
works for the Transit Authority.
“The parents never know. They’re
not very good at math.”

Returning baby birds to the wild

sible for them to return to normal
life. A perfect example was an alco-
holic crow, says Artie.

“Someone left a baby crow with
us, and one day my son, who was
drinking beer with friends in the
yard, put a little beer in a bottle ca
for the crow. He really liked it.

“He developed a drinking prob-
lem. He’d fly to a nearby yacht club
and drink people’s booze there.
Once someone who knows us came
running over and said, ‘You better
come over. Your crow’s at the yacht
club and he’s drinking!’

“He always acted strange when
he’d been drinking. He’d try to land
on a railing, miss and fall.”

Finally, the Richards took the

 

crow to the country and released
him —— forcing him onto the wagon
once and for all.

Hanna says she can identify
about 300 types of birds by their
sound. In fact, she often has some-
one who’s calling her about a sick or
injured bird hold the critter up to
the phone so she can “hear” what
kind of bird it is.

“We were amazed at the incredi~
ble variety of birds in the city,” said
Hanna. “We’ve had to send birds to
Florida that got lost in a hurricane
and wandered up here. We pack
them and send them down in an air-
plane. A Fish and Wildlife agent in
Florida receives them.”

It costs Hanna and her hubby
$6,000 a year to run their bird home
-- and they don’t get paid one
penny for their efforts.

Still, she adds proudly, “Wefve
never turned down a bird!”

ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH — Oct. 28, 1987

Artiﬁcial Habitat

A recent trend in the design of 200
cages has been a move toward what are
called, strangely, natural-like facilities.
As exemplified by the new great ape
house at the St. Louis Zoo, this supposed
step forward is merely a continuation of
a long-entrenched policy that places the
entertainment (or, at least, guilt-ap-
peasement) needs of the public before
the very real needs of the animals.

For example, the public area for hu-
mans at Jungle of the Apes is decorated
with hanging greenery, waterfalls and
streams. Visitors are greeted by colorful
murals of rainforest scenes to remind
them of the beautiful natural habitats of
orangutans, chimpanzees and gorillas.

Actually, the living spaces of these
captive primates are harsh in contrast
to this lushness. Ugly concrete tree
trunks rise out of hard concrete floors
that wear patches of hair from the
backs and legs of the chimpanzees.
There is no visible bedding, and apes
curl up on the bare floor for naps.

The ropes hanging in the cages are
frayed. Apes sometimes eat the-loose
ends, which may cause intestinal
obstruction.

Even though Missouri has moderate
to hot weather through much of three
seasons, only the gorillas have access to
the outside. The chimpanzees and
orangutans must spend all their time in
their cement jungle. Joint pain has been
reported in some chimpanzees who live
their lives in captivity on hard surfaces.

The outside area for the gorillas has a
grassy area, rocks and a stream. It was,
however, constructed to allow the public
to observe the gorillas from all sides
The gorillas have no flight space to es-
cape eye contact with the public, which
these great apes consider threatening.
Several visits were made to this area,

and no gorillas were seen, as they pre-
ferred the protected inside cage.

The viewing public is above the ani-
mal’s outside area. From this vantage
point, people throw pennies into a pool
where they can be reached by the goril-
las. No full-time keeper was on duty to
keep more dangerous objects from end-
ing up in the enclosure. Also, this pool
appears too deep for an infant and

Like a proud papa. Bruce Read
peered through the glass and
beamed at the newest arrival at the
St. Louis Zoo’s Elephant House.

"The little guy runs around and
gets in the drain and has a good
time." said Read. who is curator of
large mammals. “We kind of like
him. but we're prejudiced."

The object of Read's affection is
a babv pygmy hippopotamus born
t)('i ii to Join and Henry, two of

 
 

 

the 200’s three adult pygmy hippos.
Like her offspring, JoJo was born
at the Zoo, in 1963.

While the two giant Nile hippos
snoozing in the sun outside can
weigh up to 11/2 tons, a pygmy hip-

po tops out at a svelte 550 or so
pounds.

The little gray-and-pink bundle
of joy that shadows Jo.lo’s every
move in the house’s calving stall
weighed a mere 5 pounds at birth,
Read said. But the baby already

”He’ll put weight on really fast,”
Read said. Then referring to JoJo
and Henry, he said with a laugh,
“You can see they’re both
underweight."

Although the infant. as yet un.
named, is the fourth born to JoJo.
each birth of a pygmy hippo is im-
portant because the animal is on
the endangered species list, Read
said. The Zoo has recorded ll pyg~
my births.

 

JoJo, a pygmy hippopotamus, and her "new baby boy born Oct. 11. The baby has yet to be named.

10-P0und Hippo Brings Ton 0f Joy To Zoo

“They live in the heavy forests in
Nigeria." Read said. “They‘re en-
dangered because of deforestation,
human encroachment and hunting
pressure.

The pygmles live solitary lives
while the Nile hippos are social an-
imals, Read said. Because of that
and less pressure on their environ-
ment, the larger hippos breed more
rapidly and are not endangered.

But both species can be a threat

to man, Read said.

 

“The pygmy hippo in captivity
can be a very aggressive animal.
We treat. it as such and don‘t go into
the cage with it at any time," Read
said. ”We don't go in there. so we
never have to argue with them."

Read said the baby would be

weaned after six months or so and
then sent to another zoo or institu-
tion to take part in a captive-breed
ing program. In the early '605,
when pygmy hippos were found to
be endangered, zoos began building
breeding programs. he explained.

Read said that mother and baby
are doing well and will be on view
inside the house over the winter.

JoJo “was raised here, so this is
'her normal environment." Read
said. “She's not nervous with peo-
ple at all. You can have 100 people
in the building, and she just goes
about her business.

"In the wintertime, people. can
get close up and see these ani-
mals,” Read said. “Hippos really
have a following."

AUSTIN —— Merlin Tuttle sees
Halloween as an educational op-

“It gives me a perfect opportu-

Most bats don’t have rabies,

State Wants
Birds Scored
At Toxic Ponds

United Press International

Fresno

Operators of toxic farm
wastewater ponds in the south-
ern San Joaquin Valley would
be forced to set up programs to
scare birds away if the state De-
partment of Fish and Game has
its way.

A bird scaring program utiliz-
ing noisemakers and ground patrols
— known as “hazing” -— has been
under way since 1984 at the seleni-
um-polluted Kesterson National
Wildlife Refuge, where great num-
bers of bird deformities and deaths
have been attributed to toxic levels
of the trace mineral in farm drain-
age water.

Recent analysis of ponds and
birds in the Tulare Lake Basin at the
southern end of the San Joaquin
Valley show some selenium levels in
the livers of shore birds that are
nearly double that of similar birds
at Kesterson.

Some of the largest agribusi-
nesses in the state drain their waste
waters into the Tulare Lake Basin
ponds in Kern and Kings counties.

State Fish and Game Depart-
ment official Pete Chadwick said
last week that his agency will set up
a meeting with the Central Valley
Regional Water Quality Control

, Board “as soon as possible” to estab-
llSh guidelines for hazing at some of
the 7,000 acres of drainage water

ponds in the southern San Joaquin
Valley. '

The announcement comes
nearly two years after Fish and
Game Department biologists began
recommending a hazing program
for the southern part of the Central
Valley. Fish and Game workers
have carried out some hazing opera-
tions, but they lack the personnel to
adequately police all the ponds.

Environmentalists and sources
in the Fish and Game Department
say the agency is guilty of “foot
dragging” on the protection mea-
sures.

 

 

 

Biologists say that the ponds
are a magnet for shore birds and
migratory ducks and geese, which
winter in the San Joaquin Valley. In
a drought year, with little fresh wa-
ter available at state and federal
refuges, birds will again be forced

"to use the toxic drainwater ponds.

When state and federal offi?

cials argued to keep the Kesterson
refuge open in 1984, they warned
that “mini-Kestersons” could result
if groWers were forced to begin-de-
veloping their own wastewater
evaporation ponds.

Mastiff Collection Showcased As Dog Museum Upens

The Dog Museum of America, featuring a 7 ' I ‘
major collection of paintings and statuary of
mastiffs, opened Sunday in Queeny Park.

The museum, housed temporarily in the Jar-
ville House, features a collection assembled by
Marie Moore of Virginia. Mastiffs are large,
short-haired dogs of European origin; they
were first bred for hunting. The collection was
given to the museum earlier this year. '

“It is a remarkable collection,” said Walter
Dunn, the museum’s director. “This has to be
the finest collection of mastiff art anywhere.
The Moore collection does contain an excep-
tional collection of bronzes by French sculptors
,of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.”

 

 

The site of the Dog Museum in St. Louis
County was chosen over Cincinnati, Pasadena,
Calif, and several other cities. The collection
of art depicting dogs will be displayed at the
Jarville House until construction of a larger
museum in Eureka is completed in 1990. The
Jarville House was the residence of the late
Edgar M. Queeny, president of Monsanto Co.

The museum had been in New York City but
chose to move to better facilities in a central
part of the country. The museum was set up
both-to honor dogs and to preserve art collec-
tions that might otherwise be broken up in
sales.

County Executive Gene McNary presided
over the opening. “In the next couple of years, I

hope-'the American Kennel Club will also

choose to relocate here in St. Louis." he said.

McNary brought his best friend, a rottweiler
named Kate.

.loining Kate on the stage was Crunch, a
Welsh corgi; Susie, a Shetland Sheepdog; Fan-
nie. a bearded collie; T.J., a West Highland
white terrier; Easy. a basset; Corky, a dalma-
tian; and Esme, a mastiff. All behaved well.

But the star of the show was Manhattan. a
German shepherd belonging to Jane Firestone.

Manhattan is to show dogs as Laurence Oliv-
ier is to aetors. Before Manhattan retired to his
home in upstate New York. he won 201 best in
show awards.

“That is more best in shows than any male
dog." Firestone said. “No dog has ever come
close."

On Sunday. Manhattan was the center of at-
tention and was clearly enjoying himself. One
person familiar with the dog said that on the
few occasions when he failed to win first place
at shows, he would sulk.

At one point. Manhattan got a few unfriendly
growls from a dog in the crowd of onlookers.
Manhattan paid his critic no attention.

Dunn has said the museum will change its
exhibits regularly. Sunday's display of the-
Moore collection, valued at $1 million, filled
the 2.506-square-foot building.

Many of the paintings are by Dutch artists of
the 17th century and English artism of the 19th
century. The paintings show mastiffs posed as
if nobles, piaying or fighting with ether dogs, or'
sitting by their master.

The National Dog Museum

The St. Louis area has gained another
important tourist site: The National Dog
Museum. Located in the pre-Civil War Ja‘rv
ville House in QueenyPark, this museum
is dedicated to “paying homage to man’s
and woman’s best friend.”

The displays primarily will consist of
works of art and literature honoring fa-
mous dogs, past and present. Much of the
artwork formerly belonged to the estate of
Geraldine Rockefeller Dodge, a niece of
oil baron John D. Rockefeller and a noted
dog fancier, who reportedly kept some 200
dogs, mainly English cocker spaniels.

The National Dog Museum was original-
ly established in New York City in 1982 by

an American Kennel Club foundation, but
it has relocated to St. Louis County because
the site is more central for the nation’s dog
owners. A number of local civic leaders
and corporate sponsors also have given
both enthusiastic backing and strong finan-
cial support for the museum.

While the Jarville House is an excellent
location for the dog museum, it is only
temporary. Plans are already afoot to
build with private funds a larger, $2 mil-
lion facility for the museum’s exhibits.

Until then, however, this county site
should prove to be a popular new St. Louis
attraction for dog owners and the general
public, from both near and far.

KIli’ANIS MGAZINE - November/December 1987

 

l ENRICl—l THE WORLD OF THE HANDICAPP"D
Kiwanians fetch funds for friends

For some disabled persons, dogs are,
indeed, man’s best friend.

That’s why Happy Canine Helpers Inc.
(HCH) in Johnstown, ()hio, encourages
such friendships. The organization pro-
vides individually trained assistance and
support dogs to disabled persons to help
them lead more normal lives.

The nonproﬁt HCH, founded ﬁve years
ago by current executive director Linda
Allaby, trains the dogs, places them with
disabled persons, and then works with
the two once they are together. The
process usually takes up to eight months
and costs nearly $4,200 per dog.

After its inception, HCH relied on
donations from individuals, service clubs,
churches. small foundations, and United
Way grants to function. But with more
help needed, ()hio Kiwanis clubs are
offering assistance. Rather than under-
taking short-term projects, however,

several clubs are conducting long—term
fund-raisers to generate money for HCH.

“Kiwanis clubs are raising enough
money for one dog, even if it takes them
nine months or more,” says Allaby. “That
is such a big commitment."

The Kiwanis Club of Northwest
Columbus, for example, sponsored a
canine helper for a teen-ager who had
broken his neck in a high school football
game and now is a quadriplegic.

And the Kiwanis Club of Hamilton has
raised nearly $2,700 to provide a helping
dog for a thirteen-year-old girl with mul—
tiple sclerosis. The club began a bank
account with $1,000 to which Hamilton
residents may contribute.

“We’ve been working on this since
April, and the young girl is very excited
about getting a dog,” says Hamilton
Kiwanian John McWilliam. “A second dog
would be easier to raise money for.

With a little help from a friend, Ohio
Kiwanians are opening doors for many
disabled persons.

because by then the first dog will have
been seen in public.”

John is hoping that enough clubs will
be interested to make the fund-raiser a
district project in the future, because
“what better way is there than to help
kids who have no way of functioning on
their own? Just giving them that little bit
of independence is worth everything.”

‘Live lure’ pari- -mutuel argument phony

UCH HAS been written

about the use of live animals
as lures in greyhound racing. The
issue has been drummed up by
opponents of racing and present-
ed without solid evidence. Well,
it is time to set the record
straight.

First, the use of a live lure is
prohibited in Texas. It is a crime
punishable by one year in prison
and a fine up to $2,000. When the
law passed, it had support of the
racing industry.

To determine compliance with
the law, my staff contacted every
county, district and criminal dis-

trict attorney in the state to see if

anyone had been prosecuted for
the offense.

Out of 239 attorneys, we re-
ceived written or verbal respons—
es fro 228. All answers were a
uniform “No.”

A similar survey of the 14
states that allow greyhound rac-
ing showed that live lures are il-
legal on racing tracks.

Although in the last century

 

 

 

LLOYD CRISS

MY WORD

greyhounds were brought into
this country to control jack rab—
bits, who were destroying the
crops, today’s animal is quite dif—
ferent.

During the past 50 years, the
dogs have been bred into a sleek-
er, faster form, stressing their
natural instinct to run. In fact,
modern greyhound racing started
as a result of the invention of the
artificial lure.

Today, the breeders frown on
the practice of using the live
lure. The only training approved
by the National Greyhound Asso-

ciation is that in which an artiﬁ-
cial one is used.

In spite of the evidence to the
contrary, opponents of grey-
hound racing have consistently
exploited the subject of live
lures. They admit it is an easy
issue; it strikes a responsive
chord with most people.

“It’s very easily understood,”
says Dick Stanford, political di—
rector of Texans Who Care. To
beef up its case, the organization
has relied on manufactured evi-
dence, often substituting exam—
ples and pictures from other
states.

Pari—mutuel wagering is an im-
portant issue for Texans. Our cit—
izens should not be subjected to
deceptive claims and allegations,
randomly disseminated by its op~
ponents. The press should direct
some hard questions to Texans
Who Care and other opposition
groups. asking them to prove
their charges. We are entitled to
know the truth.

If the practice of animal abuse

is as widespread as the oppo
nents allege, why have they not
done something about it earlier“?
Why do they “care” now, when it
so conveniently serves their po—
litical goals?

Joe Murphy, commander of
criminal intelligence with the
Department of Public Safety,
had this response to our inqui-
ries: “To the best of my knowl-
edge, this department has re—
ceived no complaints, nor
investigated any allegations into
the uSe or live lures to ’u aiu grey-
hound racing dogs in this state.”

plain the Options and costs to pet owners, and
let them decide. Unlike with sick humans,
putting sick animals to sleep is still considered
acceptable, he said.

Susan Regan of the Peninsula Humane
Society suggests pet owners get second opin-
ions before agreeing to expensive operations
on their pets. ,

There are vulnerable people who, she
said, might be too willing to pump a lot of

.money into elaborate treatments just to save

their pets, without considering the quality of
the life their pet will lead.

“You have to put yourself in your pet’s
paws,” she said.
Still Guinea Pigs

 

Despite many willing pet owners, it
hasn’t been easy for the profession to pick up
new techniques as quickly as some practitio-
ners want. Veterinarians doing specialized
work often must barter and bargain for
equipment and money in a medical world
where animals are often merely the guinea
pigs for human medicine.

“I was tired of. waiting,” orthopedist Paul
said. “I don’t think it is fair that the experi~
ments are done on animals so that humans
can benefit, then veterinarians have to wait
10 years for the technology to become cheap
enough for them to be able to use it.”

He struck a deal with a maker of human
hip replacement parts: They make parts

cheaply for him and he promises to collect the
parts for research after the animals’ deaths.
The company will benefit selling to human
physicians if Paul’s work proves durable.

Another. veterinarian tired of waiting is
Dr. Jay Stone, a cancer treatment specialist
who runs the Veterinary Tumor Institute in
Santa Cruz.

He used to pay to use a local hospital’s
Computerized Tomography scanner (a CT
scanner generates cross—sectional X-rays,
which, viewed in series, give a three-dimen-
sional view of the organ being studied).

“But they get tired of you dragging dogs
and cats through their hospital where pa-
tients are,” he said.

When the hospital bought a new scanner
a year and a half ago, he bought its old one,
built a room for it and installed it for $60,000.

With the machine, Stone treats animal
cancer patients just as a physician would treat
humans: Helga, the 14~year-old dachshund
owned by Scott of San Jose, suffered from
dementia and fits of hysteria. Other veteri-
narians said there was little they could do.
Using his CT scanner recently, Stone found a

large tumor in I-lelga’s cerebrum. He destroy-
ed the tumor cells with seven radiation treat-
ments and will conduct another brain scan in
a few weeks to see if it is gone.

Helga-is back to normal, Scott reported.

The only sign of her trauma is a patch of
white hair on her head from the radiation.

The Ethical Questions

While most veterinarians seem pleased
withtheir profession’s progress, it poses some
problems.

Dr. Ronald Gammon of Martinez ap-
plauds the fact that veterinarians are begin-
ning to agree dogs and cats should have den-
tal checkups as part of an annual physical
examination. But he wonders about the ethics
of some treatments he performs. He feels
uneasy about the $1,000 he just earned. for
fixing a show dog’s overbite. The owners
might turn around and make money breeding
the dog without telling others the dog had a
congenital defect.

“We need to stop and sort out what is
right and wrong here,” he said. “We don’t
have the answers yet.”

 

 

 




DENVER POST - October 21, 1987

 

 

The Denver Post /Dave Buresh

Tammy Lang and Kevin Schrenk in foreground led their team in stuffing pig into can at Longmont Pigfest II in September.

Pig wrestling ﬂoored by squeals

By Renate Robey
Denver Post Staff Writer

LONG MONT — Squeals of protest have
halted pig wrestling in Longmont, but some
say the objections are just hogwash.

The Longmont Area Chamber of Com-
merce on Tuesday canceled all future Pig-
fests because of public criticism and declin-
ing attendance at the 2-year-old annual
event

Animal lovers complained it was cruel to
chase the swine around in a pit of mud and
then stuff the captured pig into a plastic gar-
bage can, tail-end first.

“At no point in time was the pig hurt,”
said David Daugherty, executive director of
the chamber. “It’s really too bad that it has
been taken out of context.”

Pigfest is not a f und-raiser for the cham-
ber but just “a f un-type family event.” said

Daugherty. At Pigfest II in September, 80
people wrestled and then “pignicked” on
roast pig.

Daugherty said animal scientists have as-
sured him that the pig wrestling is less
stressful for the hogs than being in a pig pen.

Others disagree. .

“We see it as cruelty to animals. We do not
understand why and how Longmont would
have allowed it to go on,” said Jennifer
()rme, an associate with the American Hu-
mane Association in Denver. '

The wrestling and rough handling Can
traumatize the pigs, said Kit Sutherland,
manager of the Colorado State University
Swine Lab. Sutherland said the trauma can
transform a calm swine into a vicious boar.

“It’s like cock fighting,” Sutherland said.
“It depends on how long the thing lasts; that
kind of manhandling can very much change

the pig’s personality.”

Some of the human Pigfest participants
said they did not see the harm.

“I liked it. I just don’t think it’s stressful,”
said wrestler Heidi Whitfield, 23. Whitfield
said she grew up on a farm, where people
chased pigs all the time. “How do people
think they get rounded up and changed from
pen to pen?”

“It’s not cruel to the animal,” said Steve
Crawford, who was on the winning 1987 Pig-
fest team. “In fact, all four of us came out
with bruises and scrapes and everything.”

Although Crawford disagreed with cancel-
ing the event, he said he could understand
the complaints: “It is sort of pagan. We’re
sort of like a bunch of natives running around
chasing a pig.”

One Person Testifies

 

Panel Gets Only A Nibble

By STEVE TEASLEY

DeKalb Countians must be sat-
isﬁed with their new dangerous
animal law.

That was one of the possible
explanations Georgia lawmakers
had for the light turnout at a
“vicious dog” public hearing
Wednesday night in Decatur.

Six state legislators - including
DeKalb’s Max Davis and Frank
Redding - were present for the last
in a series of state hearings on the
subject.

They brought three staff mem-
bers with them.

But, only one citizen, Maria
Zorka, was there to speak.

REP. HOWARD RAINEY, a
Cordele Democrat who chairs the
Vicious Dog Subcommittee of the
House Game, Fish and Recreation
committee, said the light attend-
ance disappointed him.

“We’ve had good crowds at the

other hearings out in the state,” he
said. “I thought it would be the
same here.”

He said DeKalb had been se-
lected as site of the ﬁnal hearing
because of “the high number of
accusations concerning so-called vi-
cious dogs in the county.”

There was some speculation
among subcommittee members
that the DeKalb meeting hadn’t
gotten sufﬁcient, timely publicity
to insure a big turnout.

THE SUBCOMMITTEE has
been gathering information about
“vicious dogs” from individual dog
owners, veterinarians nd animal
control ofﬁcials.

It’s expected to compile a report
on its work before making recom-
mendations to the standing Game,
Fish and Recreation Committee
and the General Assembly when
the legislature convenes in Janu-
ary.

The subcommittee has already
collected “ample” testimony from
expert witnesses and from kennel
club ofﬁcials during its three pre-
vious hearings.

In DeKalb, it wanted views from
dog owners whose animals have
been labeled “vicious.”

At least one dog owner has been
prosecuted under the county’s rela-
tively new dangerous animal law -
but not too successfully. Although
the owner still faces a civil suit for
his pit bull’s attack on an older
Stone Mountain woman, there was
only a light ﬁne when he was
prosecuted under the new law.

That’s because his dog had no
history of violence and was not
subject to the law’s provisions.

There have been other highly-
publicized dog attacks in DeKalb
in recent months. In fact, when
three pit bulls killed a four-year-
old south DeKalb boy last. Novem~
ber, it prompted the county com-

At 'Vicious Dog' Meeting-

mission to produce its dangerous
animal law.

The local law will prevail in
DeKalb unless the state adopts a
vicious dog law with stronger prov-
isions.

Legislation that comes out of the
subcommittee, said Rep. Rainey, is
primarily for the beneﬁt of Georgia
residents whose cities and counties
don’t have local laws.

DEKALB’S LAW attracted a
critical critique during the course
of the subcommittee’s meeting last
Wednesaay.

Ms. Zorka, who served on a
citizens committee that recom-
mended dangerous animal legisla—
tion to the county commission, said
the resulting DeKalb law “has a
hole in it.”

Pressed by legislators to explain,
she said the measure’s language
allows a dog one bite before it’s
considered dangerous and is there-

fore subject to tougher restrictions.

“There are ways to tell if a gun’s
loaded without shooting it,” com-
plained one of the lawmakers.

Besides having a clear deﬁnition
of a vicious dog, any state legisla-
tion should be aimed at preven-
tion, Ms. Zorka told the subcom-
mittee.

Animal owners must be made
responsible for the actions of their
dogs, she said, adding that increas-
ing the ceiling on possible court
ﬁnes might be one way to do that.
Requiring owners of dangerous
dogs to carry heavy liability insur-
ance might be another, she said.

Ms. Zorka also suggested an
educational program aimed at
kids, and possibly ﬁnanced with
some of the revenue from license
fees.

Committee members seemed to
like many of her proposals. But,
they balked when Ms. Zorka men-
tioned increasing the possible top

ﬁne for a violation of the proposed
new law from $1,000 (present ceil-
ing in local courts) to $5,000.

“The maximum ﬁne for a drunk
driving charge, third offense, is
$1,000. A $5,000 ﬁne is a little out
of line,” said one of the legislators.

Committee members said one of

The last word on pit bulls from columnist

Dear Readers -- Several
months ago I opened the floodgatesi
by printing a letter from a reader
whose child had been attacked by a:
pit bull and nearly died. I was
swamped with letters from readers
who recounted hair-raising stories
about relatives and friends who
were similarly attacked. I printed
those letters.

1 subsequently heard from hun-
.dreds of pit bull owners and
breeders saying I was misinformed
and “crazy.” There was a menacing
tone to many of those letters.

Amid the hysterical rantings was
a voice of reason by columnist Neal
Pierce, who writes for the Washing.
ton Post Writers Group. Here are
some excerpts from his column:

- v»

Pit bulls have inflicted 21 of the
nation’s 29 fatal canine attacks
since 1983. Fourteen of the victims
have been children under 6 years of
age. Each story of a mutilated

count has soared from 25 to 4,000 in'
five years. Time magazine reports
the animals are often fed gunpow-
der or hot Sauces to make them

their taste for blood.

The Humane Society of the
United States reports that many pit;
bulls involved in attacks on humans

dogfights. Dogfighting is a felony in

Animal Shelter to House rvme

down and visit. . . .

By STEVEN R. CHURM.
Times Staff Writer

Despite widespread opposition from
reeidents the Irvine City Council voted
3 to 2 early Wednesday to use a federal
grant to remodel part of an animal
shelter into a 50- bed center for the
homeless.

The kennel to be converted is one of
two structures built in * 1984 to house
stray dogs and cats at the Irvine Animal
' Care Center. Animals will still be housed
in the other building.

The facility's remote Eastside loca-
tion, away from most homes is perfect
far Irvine' s first centralized homeless
shelter, Mayor Larry Ag'ran said. As the
plan’ 3 chief preponent, the mayor ap-
peeled to residents of the master-
planned community to do their “fair

share" to help house Orange County’ s

estimated 5,000 homeless. ‘
Most opponents say they agree With

the message, but not the method. They

centend that housing humans in close

 

 

proximity to animals, even temporarily, , ..

is unthinkable. They also contend that
low- flying fighter jets from the El Toro
Marine Corps Air Station often buzz the
animal shelter, making it difficult to
hear or sleep.

And council members who oppose the
centralized homeless shelter in Irvine,
warned that such a shelter would lure
street people and derelicts to the mid-
dle— and upper-class community

DECATUR-DEKALB NEWS/ERA (Atlanta) — 10/29/87

Pound Reform Group
Gets Partial Victory

By STEVE TEASLEY

Animals from DeKalb County
government’s animal control cen-
ter cannot be sold to institutions
for research purposes, DeKalb Su-
perior Court Judge Robert Caste]-
lani ruled Monday.

At the request of Gary Shapiro,
a member of the DeKalb Coalition
to Protect Our Pets, the judge
granted a permanent restraining
order against the county, prohibit-
ing such sales.

But, the action does not prevent
the county from giving pound ani-
mals to research institutions like
Emory University. And, DeKalb
government could sell the dogs and
cats if it starts complying with its
own animal control laws.

Mr. Shapiro last month obtained
a temporary restraining order from
Senior Superior Court Judge Ar-
nold Schulman. The plaintiff
pointed out to the court that the
county’s own ordinance requires

the establishment of new rules and
regulations by the DeKalb Animal
Advisory Board before such sales
for research could take place.

No applicable rules and regula-
tions exist, and, in fact, the advis-
ory board presently does not exist,
the court was advised.

The ordinance states, “Under no
circumstances shall any animal
not claimed or adopted as provided
be sold to any public or private
institution or to any member of the
animal control advisory board or
staff of the animal control center.”

The ordinance does allow the
advisory board to produce rules
permitting alternate animal dis-
posal methods, however.

TAMPA TRIBUNE - Oct. 31, 1987

Victim of dog attack dies

ST. PETERSBURG —- An 85-year-old grandmoth-
er died Thursday afternoon, eight days after she
suffered a heart attack when she and her dog were
attacked by a Doberman pinscher.

Lockie Loeffler of 2535 4lst. Ave. N. had been in
critical condition at Humana Northside Hospital
since Oct. 21, attached to a respirator. Doctors had
told her family she was brain dead.

The Pinellas-Pasco Medical Examiner’s office
was scheduled to perform an'autopsy on Loeffler to
determine whether her death was directly related to
the dog’s bite, a spokeswoman for the Medical Ex-
aminer’s Office said Friday.

Sheriff’s spokesman Lt. John Bocchichio said in
an earlier interview that if investigators can find
proof that the dog bite directly contributed to the
heart attack, the case would be submitted to the
state attorney for possible prosecution on charges of
criminal negligence.

The doberman bit Loeffler on the leg after she
tried to break up a fight between the dog and her
own white terrier, Harvey, according to sheriff’s re-
ports.

The doberman, Bruno, remained quarantined
Friday at the Pinellas County dog pound, said Rob
ert Corey, who lives with Bruno’s owner, Billie K.
Rogers, at 2564 415i Ave. N. The dog was scheduled
to be released today, Corey said.

 




ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH

October

29, 1987

Support Puppies Need F ester Family

Just around Thanksgiving, about
24 special Labrador retriever pup-
pies will be born. Before they go
into training to become support
dogs for physically handicapped
people, each one will need a foster
family for about 13 to 15 months.

These puppies are a part of a
program sponsored by Support
Dogs Inc., a non-profit organization
with its training center on Dogwood
Lane in Pevely. The program is the
only one of its kind in Missouri.

Although the organization has re-
ceived about 175 calls since an arti-
cle earlier this week, the program
is still interested in applicants.
About 20 applications were mailed
out to prospective foster parents.

“It’s an ongoing process, and
we’ll always need foster homes for
puppies,” explained founder and
president Marilyn Pona. The next
group of puppies is scheduled to
arrive in January.

She said that these puppies first
need to reach the age of about 13
months. Then they are trained for
six to nine months to pull wheel-
chairs up ramps, open heavy glass
mall doors, pick up dropped crutch-
es and do other unusual tasks.

They are then placed free of

charge with a physically handi--

capped person.

“We build partners and friend-
ships,” said Pona while holding on
to Jocko - her support dog, a
Great Dane mix. “We have about 50
applicants waiting all over the na-
tion but we can only do so much.”

Pona, who suffered a spinal and
joint defect several years ago, now
has neuromuscular degeneration
that left her in need of J ocko’s help.

“We teach these dogs to wait for
your instructions,” said Pona.
“They don’t just do things when
they decide.”

Trainer Mitzy Kirkbride and her
husband, training director Jerry
Kirkbride, have dedicated their en-
tire lives to training dogs who pro-
vide such help.

They live in a two-bedroom
house on the training facility with
three children — Jimmy, Eric and
Christopher — and “a lot of pets.”
A monthly salary of $125, food
stamps and community donations
support the family.

“It’s hard at times,” said Mitzy "

Kirkbride. “It’s a very taxing job —
both emotionally and physically,
but it’s very rewarding.”

Mitzy Kirkbride described the

puppy training classes. After a fos-
ter home is found, the parent
comes to regular classes to receive
instructions on developing a proper .._

personality for the dogs.
“We teach the foster parents how

to live and deal with the growing
stages,” she said. “We look for fam-
ilies with kids or active families
who would expose the puppy to all
sort of situations.”

Kirkbride saidthat the Puppy
Foster Care Program is a lot like
rearing a child.

“You want to get your kids up on

‘their feet and become responsible,”

she said. “You teach them to do
some good in this world, and when
they grow up, they leave to do just
that.

“Some people (feel) hurt when
they return the dogs. But if they
have enjoyed this experience, we
will replace the adult dog with a
new puppy.”

Kirkbride said that the job’s re-
wards and joys take away the
chance of ever considering another
way of life.

“We see a lot of pain and heart-
aches in people with disability,” she
said. “But we try to give them at
least a small amount of happiness.”

Janise Webster, 21, is a dog re-
cipient who said her golden retriev-
er, named Tune, has given her a lot

more than a “small amount” of
happiness.

Webster has muscular dystrophy
and is confined to a wheelchair.

“But since I got Tune last June,
I’ve become completely indepen-
dent,” Webster said. “I’ve moved
out into my own apartment since
and am now doing a lot of things on
my own.

“Before, I was active too, but al-
ways relying on other people,” she
continued. “Now, I feel totally com-

fortable going shopping and doing

I
,

things by myself.”
Webster said that Tune has been

1a great help in opening doors at the

University of Missouri at St. Louis,
where she studies psychology.

“Now it’s so much easier,” she
said.

She found the organization in the
phone book one day “by accident,”
she said. In November 1986, she
applied to participate in the train-
ing program. Last June, she got her
“partner.”

Her case was an unusually quick
one, she said. Normally, it takes
longer to get a support dog.

“It’s a long and strenuous proc-
ess,” said Webster. “They (the or-
ganization) were helping me and
the dog form a partnership.”

“For a while there, I thought we
weren’t going to make it, but they
were so supportive,” she continued.
“They are like a second family to
me, always there for any kind of
help.”

Pona explained that the organi~
zation has a follow-up program that
first helps the two form a partner-
ship, and later makes sure the “re-
lationship is working out.”

Within the first three weeks, the
recipient is reached by phone and
later visited. A yearly veterinary
checkup of the dog and a review of
the team are also provided

for declaring a dog "vicious” even if it has not
bitten anyone.

"I think we all acknowledge the need is there
to do something,” Vice Mayor Dave Guthrie,
chairman of the Police Committee, said Thurs-
day at the conclusion of a brief hearing on the
proposed ordinance.

Guthrie and fellow committee members,

Councilwoman Peggy Rubach and Councilman
Ross Farnsworth, also suggested a public
hearing in early November. The full City

Council is scheduled to consider the ordinance
Nov. 16.

The proposed ordinance calls a dog vicious if
"when unprovoked, in a vicious or terrorizing
manner (it) approaches any person in an
apparent attitude or attack upon the streets,
sidewalks, or any public grounds or places.”

Eric Norenberg, the city employee who
drafted the proposed law, told Police Commit-
tee members the intent is to not wait for a dog
to bite before declaring it vicious.

Mesa’s proposal covers all dogs and defines
an attack as “a violent or aggressive physical
contact or violent or aggressive behavior that
confines the movement of a person, including
but not limited to cornering or circling a
person.”

However, the ordinance says a dog is not
considered vicious if it attacks someone who is
trespassing at the time of the attack.

The proposed ordinance allows Mesa police

to request a hearing to determine whether a
particular dog is vicious.

Once a dog is officially declared vicious, the
law would:

I Require the owner to muzzle and leash the
animal any time the dog is allowed outside its
pen or kennel.

I Prohibit the dog from being kept on
porches, patios or in houses with open windows
or screen doors and windows.

IRequire the owner to register the dog as
vicious with the Mesa Police Department.

I Require the owner to post signs warning of
a vicious dog.

It also would force owners of vicious dogs to
carry $100,000 liability insurance on the dog
and furnish the police with yearly proof the
coverage has been renewed. Norenberg said he
did not know how much liability insurance
would cost owners of vicious dogs. but said some

TAMPA — Saturday’s Lowry
Park Zoofest was big - a crowd
Tampa police estimated at between
80,000 to 100,000 made sure of it.

The fun-seekers jammed the
park at North Boulevard and Sligh
Avenue for food, contests and free
live entertainment — including a
farewell performance by the Mon-
kees rock group.

“We anticipated initially 35,000
to 50,000 people, and obviously it
was about twice that,” Tampa po-
lice Capt. Keith Linton said. “But
overall, everything went pretty
smoothly for us.”

And even better for the 200.

The third-annual fund-raiser for
the zoo should at least double the
$20,000 raised last year, said Randy
Kabrich, program director for
WRBQ-AM and FM (Q-105). Al-
though admission was free, the zoo
kept a portion of the proceeds from
concession sales.

Final tallies probably won’t be
in until Tuesday, he said.

“In the best-case scenario, it
could reach six digits,” Kabrich
said. “We are benefiting the zoo and
the city of Tampa, and that’s what
it’s all about.”

Kabrich said he didn’t see much .

evidence that a new policy from
Mayor Sandy Freedman disallowing
beer sales on public property hurt
fund-raising.

Beer was sold on rivate ro u‘ -

ty near the park this year because
of the rule. City officials did not try
to stop people from drinking in the
park. ‘

“It just makes it harder to get to
because people have to go through
the crowds, which are backed up
because of the concert,” Kabrich
said. ~
The zoo gets $1.50 of every $2 in
beer sold, making beer the leader
over food and soft drinks in pro-
ceeds. Tampa police reported no
major problems related to the sales.

But they had a few other prob-
lems to keep them busy. I

At one point Saturday, about 40
lost children and 20 lost parents
waited to be reunited behind the
stage where the Monkees per-
formed.

“He's been lost about two
hours,” said a concerned Laurie
Gisi, Palmetto Beach, as she hugged
and consoled her son, Nicholas, 10.

Meanwhile, on the other side of
the stage, fainting Monkees fans -;—
mostly teen-age girls — kept the
Tampa Fire Department busy. '

At one point, firefighters gave
first aid and ice to about 10 teens
who had dehydrated. They were
lifted through the crowd to near the
front of the stage. ‘

 




I ‘TIONAL ENQUIRER

ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH - Oct. 22, 1987

By Joan Bray
Of the Post-Dispatch Staff

St. Louis Zoo officials are pleased
about the birth Saturday at the Zoo of
a lowland gorilla -— an endangered
species —- even though problems the
infant has had with nursing have
forced officials to remove him from
his mother’s care.

The birth is particularly exciting
because lowland gorillas — an endan-
gered species — have had difficulty
breeding in captivity, said Roger, C.
Birkel, the Zoo’s general curator. The
St. Louis Zoo is working with other

‘ zoos to strengthen the genetic lines of

gorillas, he said.
Because of the baby’s nursing prob-

lems, he is being tended round the

clock by a phalanx of zookeepers,
who feed him bottles of human baby
formula every four hours, cuddlehim
and change his disposable diapers.
“His cry is just like a human baby’s

cry,” said Michael Lynch, the nurse- '

maid Wednesday afternoon. He

' raised the small gorilla to his shoul-

der for a burp.
Birkel said the baby was born early

old female. The baby’s father is ei-
ther Fred, “3 big, beautiful male” at
age 29, or JoJo,'7, “a teen-agar who’s
playful and mischievous," Birkel
said.

For research purposes, a test will.

be given later to determine paternity,
he said.

Although Kivu demonstrated many
maternal qualities, she failed to nurse
the infant successfully, he said. After
observing the mother and child for
four days, Zoo officials tranquilized
Kivu to examine her and the baby.

Veterinarians and a neonatalogist
determined that the infant was dehy-
ilrated because of lack of fluids. They
decided to quarantine him in the
Children’s 200.

On Wednesday, the infant lay in an»

incubator, fingering a furry blanket
and sucking contentedly on a pacifi-
er. An intravenous tube fed dextrose,
a sugar solution, into his veins. Lynch
said he weighed 4 pounds, ll ounces.
Birkel said he expected the baby to
be‘ rehydrated by today. But Birkel
declined to predict when the gorilla

'would make his public debut.

 

Birth Of Gorilla Delights Zoo Ofﬁcials

Saturday morning to Kivu, a 10-year- “That just depends on how he pro-
gresses,” Birkel said. Aside from the ;
dehydration, “We think we have a ‘

healthy baby,” he said.

Kivu, the mother, arrived here last
year with three other lowland gorillas
on loan from the Lincoln Park Zoo in
Chicago. They live in the new ape
hause, called Jungle of the Apes.

“Kivu matured shortly after arriv-
ing,” Birkel said. As Zoo officials kept
track of her reproductive cycle, they
realized that she had become preg-
nant at the earliest possible time. Af-
ter an 81/2-month gestation, the baby
was barn before dawn Saturday in
the ape house.

Kivu “was an excellent mother,”
said Ingrid Porton, deputy curator of

primates. “She held him and cuddled

him and touched him gently.

“But it is not unusual for a mother
gorilla not to raise her first baby.’

Porton said the Zoo’ 5 staff was try-
ing to simulate “as much as possible
the kind of care a gorilla mother
would give” — care much like that of
a human mother.

“falli for tlle ‘ Vi1 d . . . DETROIT FREE -' Oct. 5, 1987

\

brings in $13 500  

By DAWSON BELL
Free Press Staff Writer

With a “Walk for the Wild” walkathon Sunday, the Detroit Zoo
moved $13,500 closer to making a new chimpanzee exhibit a
reality. _ -

About 2,000 chilly but cheerful primates of the human variety
began a two-mile circuit of the zoo grounds in Royal Oak about 9
am. and concluded about two hours later with an entertainment
and awards ceremony. Each of the participants paid $7; in return,
they received a T-shirt, a look at the current animal exhibits and the
hope they will be able to return to the zoo in 1989 and see chimps.

The zoo has been without a chimpanzee exhibit since 1983,
when the Chimp ampitheater was closed.

“Everybody who comes here misses the chimps,” said Chuck
Hammond, executive director of the Detroit Zoological Society,
organizer of the fund-raisin g campaign. “They had been here for 50
or 60 years and created a tremendous legacy.”

The new chimp exhibit, which is to built on about 21/2 acres on
the site of the old amphitheater, will Cost about $7 million, zoo
officials said. It will feature 20-25 Chimps in a natural setting.‘

. The City of Detroit, which owns and operates the zoo, has sold
about $2.25 million in bonds for the project. The rest will come from
the 200’s regular budget and from a private fund-raising effort
headed by David Lawrence Jr., Free Press publisher and chairman.

BIRMINGHAM NEWS - October 2, 1987

 

Baby gorilla moved
to Cmcmnatl Zoo

Wednesday was moving day for Mwelu.

The l4-month-old gorilla, who has had his home
at the Birmingham Zoo since being moved from the
Columbus (Ohio) Zoo in March, was taken by car
to the Cincinnati Zoo Wednesday night by Birming-
ham Zoo Director Bob Truett. ‘

“Mwelu slept most of the way to Cincinnati and
appears to be relaxed and doing well,” said Dick
Mills, assistant director of the Birmingham Zoo.

Mwelu has been placed with a young female gorilla
and a chimpanzee at the Cincinnati Zoo to help him

learn to socialize with other gorillas, Mills said.
He said the zoo plans to bring Mwelu and the other

two animals back to Birmingham in the spring of

1988 for about two months so that the pe0ple of
Birmingham can see them.

“Then they’ll probably go back to Cincinnati until
our Social Animals Building, which in now under con-

; struction, is completed,” he said.

“At that point we’d like to bring Mwelu back to
Birmingham on a permanent basis. We believe that
that will be in the spring of 1989,” Mills said.

Both Mwelu’s mother, Ponji, who is on loan at the
Columbus Zoo, and the Birmingham Zoo’s male
gorilla, who is on loan to the Denver, Zoo, are
expected to be moved back upon completion of
the building. , ‘ ‘ -

Carlton Set for Leap From
Warm Pail to Wide x World ‘

By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, Times Staff Writer

SACRAMENTO—Born on a California freeway and nurtured in
a bucket, Carlton the wallaroo is healthy now, his brush with
danger over, say Sacramento Zoo officials.

The next challenge for the 10- month- old marsupial, who
Survived after his mother escaped from the zoo and was killed by a
truck on Interstate 5, will be adjusting to life with other wallaroos
in captivity.

Hairless and hardly larger than a small cat when he was jolted
' ' from his mother’ s pouch 1n February, Carlton fairly strutted about
at his first press conference Thursday. Zoo keepers looked on
proudly as the little guy hopped from one end to the other of his
new pen and played with his pal, a rabbit named “Mr. Bun."

Carlton, who has grown from less than two pounds to more than

 

? i, 12 and now sports a thick gray and white fur coat, will soon join the ..

zoo’s eight healthy wallaroos in
their regular enclosure.
Mary Liebmann, one of three
l zookeepers who cared for Carlton
. at home during his struggle for life,
i said she and the others are nothing
‘ short of astonished that he sur-
: vived.
Wallaroos, smaller versions of
their close cousin the kangaroo, are
‘ notoriously difficult to raise be-
' cause they are sensitive creatures
that don’t like human attention,
Liebmann said. Normally, the ba-
bies don’t even leave their mother's
pouch until they are 6 months old
orso.
But Carlton had no choice.
Late in the afternoon of Feb. 24,

his mother bounded over a zoo;

- .1

LOS ANGELES TIMES - October 9, 1987

 

fence and hopped about a half mile
through a residential neighbor-
hood. With zoo workers and neigh-
bors in pursuit, she scooted down a
ramp and onto a stretch of L5 that

is named for Carlton E. Forbes, a.

late Caltrans chief engineer. She
was hit by a tractor-trailer rig.
Mother Wallaroo died later at a
nearby veterinary hospital, but her
baby was thrown free, born into
the outside world there on the
pavement, although he had been in
the pouch for two months. A
passing motorist stopped and
scooped up the baby, keeping him
warm until help arrived.
Zookeepers quickly dubbed the
little fellow Carlton, for the free-
way. After a flood of initial atten-
tion from the media—Which in-

Y

spired Santa Barbara resident Pete
Nevin to pen the song for the
wallaroo—the keepers set out qui-
etly to save Carlton’s fragile life.

Pillow Hung in Bucket

To substitute for a pouch, they
suspended a pillowcase from the lip
of a five-gallon bucket. They added
a heating pad in the bottom for
warmth. Regular applications of
mineral oil kept the youngster from
drying out. The keepers took Carl-
ton home so they could feed him
from a bottle every three or four
hours.

Although Carlton overcame mi-
nor intestinal illness and eye infec-

‘ tions during his first few months,

his life was threatened at one point
by a calcium deficiency that re-

 

 

; tarded bone growth. He suffered
several breaks in each hind leg and
spent two months in what Lieb- '

mann calls “wallaroo traction."

“It looked like there was no
hope,” she said. “For a wallaroo not
to have use of his legs. . . ."
Shrugging, Liebmann didn’t finish
the sentence.

A change in diets got Carlton the
calcium he needed, and he re-
sponded with vigor. For the last

ning pooches including every breed
from a basset to a Welsh corgi to a
West Highland white terrier.

They will all be in town for the
grand opening festivities for the new
Dog Museum next weekend. The mu-
seum —- an institution dedicated to
“paying homage to man’s and wom-
3an’s best friend” in art, poetry and

Jarville House was to be strictly

Many visitors come to see the oil

The museum has more than 2,000"

members and admirers nationwide.

An American Kennel Club founda-
tion started the museum in 1982 after
the major dog-art collections of the
Geraldine Rockefeller Dodge estate

art lovers decided then that some;

way had to be found to preserve such
collections. (Dodge, the niece of John

, 04 THE ARIZONA REPUBLIC THURSDAY, OCTOBER 22, 1987

By BILL DONOVAN
Arizona Republic Correspondent

GALLUP, N.M. —- State and
federal ofﬁcials raided several Gal-
lup shops Wednesday and arrested
more than a dozen people in a
sweep of suspected wildlife poach-
ers who allegedly used feathers of
protected birds from several states
to make replicas of Indian artifacts.

Additional arrests around the
country could bring to 50 the
number of people facing charges of
illegally killing birds, illegally sell—
ing them or articles made from
them or related offenses, said Clark
Babin, chief of law enforcement for
the US. Fish and Wildlife Service.

At a press conference in Wash-
ington, DC, on Wednesday, Inte-
rior Secretary Donald Hodel said
the 18-month, undercover opera-
tion was not the first of its kind and
will not be the last.

"We’re making a big production
out of this so that those who would
make a quick buck know they
, stand a good chance of a jail term,”
he said.

Department officials said more
than 600 protected birds have been
killed illegally over the past 18
months by individuals who are part
of "a poaching network” in nine
Western and Southern states.

Officials said unfinished sets of
bald- and golden-eagle tail feathers
sold for between $100 and $350
each, while finished eagle-tail-
feather fans brought as much as
$800 each.

About 75 agents each from the
federal and state fish and wildlife
agencies took part in Wednesday’s
arrests at five businesses and one
home in New Mexico.

Tom Smylie, public-information

ofﬁcer for the federal wildlife
service in Albuquerque, said the
busineSses searched were the
Windy Mesa Gallery, the Swap
Shop, Pino’s Curios and Brown’s
Turquoise Shop in Gallup, and
Piano’s Taxidermy in Farmington.
Federal and state officials also
searched the home of Steve Cole-
man, a Gallup police officer, who
was among those arrested.

Others arrested in Gallup were
identified as David Clark of Far-
mington; Clyde Withers of Albu-
querque; Charles Naukei of Navajo;
Raymond Pino of Gallup; David
Clawson, Elvin Lewis and Parley
Ansley, all of Ramah; Mickey
Williams of Datil; Jerry Muller of
Bloomfield; and Marcellus Jones of
Lukachukai, Ariz., on the Navajo
Reservation. All were charged in
federal court in Albuquerque and
released Wednesday on their own
recognizance.

Four other people were arrested
Wednesday in Wisconsin, Idaho,
Texas and Utah as part of the
nationwide operation, Smylie said.

“In each case, the arrest was the
result of the individual having sold
an illegal item to an undercover
agent sometime during the 18-
month investigation,” Smylie said.

US. Attorney Bill Lutz of Albu-
querque said that conﬁscated items
included kachina dolls and loose
feathers, including those of eagles,
which are protected under the
Endangered Species Act and the
Bald and Golden Eagle Protection
Act. Other birds involved are pro-
tected under the Migratory Bird
Treaty Act and the Lacey Act,
which makes it a crime to sell
illegally taken birds. '

Lutz said he had not received a

 

The Associated Press
interior Secretary Donald Hodel displays an lndian headdress at his press conference in Washington.

Officials round up suspects
in'protected-brrd poach'ng

complete report on what kinds of
illegal feathers were conﬁscated
but said some of the feathers in
search warrants were from the bald
eagle, the golden eagle, the red-tail
hawk, the owl, the woodpecker and
the scissor-tail ﬂycatcher.

“This is a serious problem, not
only in Gallup but in other parts of
the Southwest,” Smylie said, ad-
ding that arrests are the only way
to keep the sale of illegal feathers
down. The feathers are prized by
collectors in Europe as well as in
the United States.

People convicted of selling illegal
feathers could receive a fine of up
to $20,000 and/ or a ﬁve-year prison
term.

These are the first major arrests
made by the Fish and Wildlife
Service on counts of possession of
illegal feathers in four years. In the
early 1980s, the agency conducted a
series of raids in cities throughout
the Southwest, including Phoenix,
Albuquerque and Oklahoma City,
arresting more than 20 dealers of
kachina dolls as part of a crack-
down on the use of illegal feathers
on kachinas.

Smylie said wildlife-protection
laws were passed because allowing
the indiscriminate killing of mi-
gratory birds-would soon result in
their extermination. In some cases,
certain birds are allowed to be
killed by non-Indians for food but
not for use of the feathers.

Smylie stressed that although
some of those arrested are Indians,
the agency does not plan to curtail
Indian use of feathers. Indians, he
said, have a right to use feathers for
religious purposes.

Press International contributed to this

A lion’s savage attack on a
young girl at a flea market con—
vinced Houston City Councilwom-
an Eleanor Tinsley Wednesday that
the city needs an outright ban on
the possession of any wild animals
within city limits.

Tinsley said current city laws,
which prohibit the possession of
any wild animals within 300 feet of

-any building occupied by humans,

have not been tough enough. -

Harris County Assistant District
Attorney Roberto Gutierrez has set
next Wednesday as the target date
for the case to go before a grand
jury to decide if charges can be
brought against Gary Durkovtiz,
the owner of the lion that attacked
the girl.

Tinsley said, “It’s time in a big
city with a lot of congestion to have
a total ban of all wild animals in the
city limits.”

She asked that city ordinance be
amended to include a total ban but
with exceptions for zoos and cir-
cuses. .

However, the city’s chief animal
control official said he thought cur-
rent law is adequate but that the
maximum $200 fine' should be in-
creased to $2,000.

On Saturday, 8—year-old Rox-
anne Hernandez was mauled by
the lion as the animal was being
escorted by Durkovitz out of a flea
market in the 7100 block of the
North Freeway.

Hernandez remained in serious

vi

‘ but stable condition with severe

mann Hospital. 3’
Mayor Kathy Whitmire said
Tinsley’s proposal needed more
study. 7 L:
The councilwoman said that
when she learned of the attack-on:
Saturday, she decided then that no
individual in the city should have.
the right to own a wild animal. W,
“We have animals at the flea'
markets, and I’ve seen wild ant-g
mals at some of these festivals
where poeple go upand pet,
them,” she said. ‘ “3
Police and prosecutors are look-
ing at ways to charge the animal’s“:
owner with a criminal offense, but
they have said it will be difficult to
charge him with anything stronger
than violation of the city ordinance;
The ordinance, passed in 1968.
and .most recently amended last
year, prohibits any individual from‘
possessing a wild animal in a.
Houston “residence or within 300.
feet of any other residence or-
building habitated by humans. . W
City officials interpret that to
mean shopping malls, flea markets-
and other places where people;
congregate, although some lawyers
have wanted to challenge that law}
and interpretation, said Dr. Robert;
Armstrong, director oi the city Ani- :2
mal Regulation and Care Bureau. ’
Gutierrez said he does not sub- ‘
scribe to the so~called “one free;
bite rule,” which continually
emerges as a traditional means of L
holding pet owners immune from
liability for their pet’s first attack on
human beings. ~ M.- . "37-

Grizzly ’5 just Plane Unbearable

--Pilot Ed Gurtler decided he was no
match for a determined and hungry grizzly
bear. So when he saw the animal tearing
apart his Cessna 170 to get at 500 pounds of
moose meat inside, Gurtler left. As an
old-timer once told me, you can always get a
new airplane, but you can’t get a new pilot,
he said. Gurtler said he was returning to his
plane on a sand bar in the lnnoko River near
Cripple, Alaska, when he heard a commotion.
When he got closer, he shined his light on the
plane and saw a big grizzly staring back. He
fired a shot over the bear with no effect. The
bear already had bent the plane’s fuselage by
picking it up and slamming it down. When
the bear ignored his shot, Gurtler said he
retreated to his river boat and headed back to
his homestead. The next morning, the 500
pounds of moose meat had been reduced. to
200 pounds. Gurtler removed the remaining
' meat, but that didn’t discourage the bear,

which returned, tearing up seats in the plane .

and in the boat. “Everywhere he could smell
that moose meat, he went after it,” Gurtler
said. He estimated that the bear did as much
as $10,000 damage to the plane.

Racing advocates deny ,
  greyhounds are abused

By George Kuempel

Austin Bureau

‘ AUSTIN -— Greyhound racing ad-

vocates Wednesday branded as

.3 “outright lies” statements by oppo-

; nents that the dogs are mistreated

3 and that live rabbits are used as
lures in training the animals.

State Rep. Lloyd Criss, D-
LaMarque, a co-sponsor of the rac-
' ing measure, also said that business

is thriving at all but two of the na-
tion’s 124 greyhound tracks.

“Greyhound racing is one of the
healthiest industries in the United
States, and the future is even
brighter,” Criss said.

At a Capitol news conference,
Criss sought to counter statements
by Texans Who Care —— a group of
prominent business people, law en-
forcement officials, sports figures
and clergy that is Opposing passage
of the Nov. 3 proposal to legalize
betting on dog and horse races in
Texas.

ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH - October 27, 1987

~ ‘ U.S.“Closes DOo’r’

By Christine Bertelson
91 the Post-Dispatch Staff
" The US. Fishand Wildlife Ser-

vice may abandon plans to reintro- .

duce the Mexican wolf into its for-
mer range in the southwestern
United States because it has been

unable to find a home for the ani-

mals in the wild.

That prospect casts an ominous
shadow on the fate of the 31 Mexi-
can wolves in captivity in the Uni-

' ted States, including 14 wolves at

.the Wolf Sanctuary in St. Louis
County near Eureka.

. The federal wildlife agency was
denied permission late last month

by the US. Army to release the

‘wolves in a remote, mountainous

part of the White Sands Missile

Range in south—central New Mex-

,ico. The range was the last of 26

sites in New Mexico, Texas and Ari-
Zona being considered as homes for
the wolves. '

_ Arizona and Texas turned down
the wolf project, said Tom Smylie,
assistant director of the Fish and
Wildlife Service in Albuquerque,
NM. Texas law forbids the reintro-
duction of wolves, and Arizona
wanted more time to evaluate the
project and educate the public, he
said. Cattle and sheep ranchers in
all three states strongly opposed
the program, Smylie said,

The White Sands Missile Range
covers 4,000 square miles, an area
about the size of Israel, and was
considered the last hope for the
‘wolves, Smylie said.

The range is used for testing of
military equipment as diverse as
combat boots and top-secret weap-

‘on'sz'A White Sands public affairs

officer, Lt. Col. Ed Williams, said
that the project could jeopardize se-
curity at the missile range.
‘;:,;“The wolves wouldn’t make any
“difference to our mission, but the
people associated with it certainly
Would,” Williams said.
_‘ Bill Montoya, assistant director
of the New Mexico Department of
Game and Fish, said that “the door
is closed” on the Mexican wolf.

“I think we have exhausted all

thé'ipéssibilities for releasing the

Mexican wolf in the United States,”
Montoya said. '

range as a prospective wolf habitat.
The Fish and Wildlife Service con-
sidered the survey a first step
toward the eventual release of the
wolves. '

“We were given a caution light,
but we thought we were under
way,” Smylie said. “We thought we
were at first base, and we didn’t get
that far with anyone else. We told
our 'co-operators in Albuquerque
and St. Louis that it looked like an
opportunity, .so all our spirits were
raised ” ‘

. The Army said that its permis-
sion to evaluate the site had been
misinterpreted and that the Army
was not prepared at any time to
allow wolves at White Sands.

Williams said the Army had been
made the scapegoat for the demise
of the project because it was the
last to say no.

“No one asked us if we thought
we were suitable,” he said. “If they
had, it would have generated a no

The Fish and Wildlife Service is
the federal agency charged with
the protection of endangered
specnes. -

In this fiscal year, which began
this month, only $5,000 is budgeted
for the Mexican wolf program,
.Smylie said. That amount falls far
short of covering the cost of feed-
ing the wolves in captive breeding
programs, providing veterinary
care for them and paying the sala-
ries of staff members.

'About $135,000 is budgeted for a
reintroduction program under way
for the red wolf at a refuge near
North Carolina’s outer banks. Eight.
wolves were released into the wild
there earlier this fall.

The Mexican wolf is a subspecies
of.the gray wolf. By the early 19603,
the Mexican‘ wolf was eradicated in

’ the United States by predator-con-

trol programs and by human en: .
croachment into its range. The last
remaining wild Mexican wolves are
in Mexico. ' .

All the wolves in captive breed-'
ing programs in the United States
are the progeny of wolves caught. in
the wild in Mexico and are legally
the property of Mexico. Three pairs .
of wolves will be shipped to Mexico >
next week to establish a captive
breeding program there. Among
them will be a 2-year-old female
named Sonora, born at the Wolf
Sanctuary here in 1985. Three pup-
pies born this spring will be
shipped to the Alameda Park Zoo
in Alamagordo, NM.

Vicki O’Toole, administrative di-
rector of the Wolf Sanctuary here,
called the release program “a
mess.” O’Toole said the Wolf Sanc-
tuary had spent j‘tens of thousands '
of dollars” on the care and feeding
of the Mexican wolves. . ._

If the sanctuary is ordered to sus- ,

be implanted into the breeding fe-
male wolves.

" HE primal howl of the wolf, once heard
‘ from central Mexico to the Arctic, has
' been almost completely silenced south
of the Canadian border in the few centuries

, since Europeans arrived on this continent.
' Slaughtered by the thousands by ranchers

carnation of a dark and threatening wilder-
ness, wolves were brought to the brink of ex-

* tinction in the United States by the early part

of this century.

But recently there have been signs that the
wolf is returning to the wilds in the United
States, although the return is already threat-
ened by politics and economics. Protected by
the Endangered Species Act and increasingly
embraced by a public whose fear and hatred
are gradually changing to admiration and
sympathy, scattered packs of gray wolves
are beginning to venture inside the nation’s
northern border. Some of them are staying.

“We are seeing what we thought was al-
most impossible happen — we are seeing the
return of a large predatory animal to a sig-

Slaughtered by the thousands,
wolves, which once ranged from
the Arctic to Mexico, withdrew to
the North. By the early 20th'century,
they had virtually disappeared from

the United States.

Wolves that migrate into the United
States are now protected by the
Endangered Species Act, and the
Government plans to reintroduce them
to areas where they have vanished.

nificant part of its former range from whicn
it had been previously wiped out,” said Ron
Nowak, a mammologist in the endangered
species office of the Federal Fish and Wild-
life Service. .

The Federal Government has devised sev-
eral programs to reintroduce wolves in areas
where they had vanished. It is taking these

actions under provisions of the endangered

; species'law' that seek to restore species near-
,ing extinction. Earlier this month, the wild-

life service turned four mating pairs of red
wolves loose in North Carolina. The red wolf,
Canis rufus, a smaller relative of the pre-
dominant gray wolf, Canis lupus, had been
reduced to a total population of 85, all in cap—
tivity before the program started. \
“This is the first time a native species ex-
tinct in the wild has been returned to the wild
from a captive breeding population,” said
Donald Pfitzer, the wildlife service’s assist-
ant regional director in the Southeast. - ‘ ‘
The service has also prepared an ambi-
tious experimental program to reintroduce
Rocky Mountain timberwolves, a subspecies
of the gray'wolf, into the northern Rockies.
The plan calls for transplanting wolf packs
into Montana, Idaho and Yellowstone Na- .
tional Park in Wyoming. ____
' Now, wolves are back in.
Minnesota, Wisconsin, . J ..
Michigan and Montana.

 




The Yellowstone recovery plan is strongly
supported by the director of the National
Park Service, William Penn Mott Jr. , I

“We do not have a right to eliminate these
animals from the web of life,” Mr. Mott said.
“Future generations have a right to go to
Yellowstone and hear those magnificent ani-
mals howl.” - ."

But opponents in Congress, apparently re-
flecting the views of cattle and sheep raisers
and hunters, have blocked the plan. It has
been put on the shelf by Frank Dunkle, direc-

tor of the wildlife service, after vigorous pro- ,
tests by members of Wyoming’s Congres?

sional delegation: Senators Alan K. Simpson
and Malcolm Wallop and Representative
Dick Cheney, all Republicans. '
Mr. Simpson said in a telephone interview
that his opposition to immediately reintro-
ducing wolves in Yellowstone was ‘in re-

sponse to pressure from his constituents, who

, believe the wolves would be “a very
serious threat to the livestock indus-

. try.” .

He said that hunting was an impor-

' tant part of Wyoming’s economy, and
that not enough information had been
gathered on what effect the wolves ‘
would have on moose, elk and other

,' game outside Yellowstone. No hunt-
ing is allowed in the park.

Mr. Simpson said he was also con-
cerned that the Park Service might
close off large sections of Yellow-
stone to protect wolves, just as it did
to protect endangered grizzly bears.
He insisted that more information
and public debate were needed before
allowing wolves back.

Signs of Natural Return

Mr. Dunkle of the wildlife service
said one reason the wolf recovery
program was put on hold is because
of signs that wolves are “drifting
naturally” into northern states from
Canada. He said much more needs to
be learned about “whether the wolves
could be controlled and whether we
can safeguard personal property.”

“The director of the National Park
Service said he would like Yellow—
stone Park to have wolves, but I sug-
gest that now is not the time and I
would not recommend it,” he said.

Mr. Mott, the park service’s direc-
tor, said he believed that proper man-
agement could solve any problems
caused by re-entry of the wolf into
Yellowstone. For example, radio col-
. lars fitted on wolves could keep track
of them and could also be used to in-
ject harmless tranquilizers to re-
strain wolves that venture too far
from the park. Compensation could
be paid for livestock destroyed out-

growing livestock for predators," he
said. He also complained that even if
ranchers caught wolves attacking
their livestock, they could not shoot
them because of the endangered spe-
cies law. .
. In Minnesota, wolves and the live-
stock industry appear to be co-exist-
ing reasonably well. There are 1,200
wolves in northern Minnesota, by far
the largest wolf population in this
country outside of Alaska, and they

. are listed as a threatened rather than

an endangered species in that state.

After long legal and political bat-
tles, the state introduced a program
that encourages the wolf population
but also instituted a control program
under which state hunters kill wolves
that attack livestock. Ranchers who
lose stock are compensated by the
state.

L. David Mech, a biologist at the

; wildlife service who is an expert on
, wolves, said the Minnesota experi-

; ence had raised his hopes that wolves
; can exist in reasonable proximity to
people.
He noted that in Minnesota wolves
mainly stay in the wilderness and

z 3 only rarely wander on to rangeland to

3 attack cattle.

‘ “There has been a lot of oppor-
tunity for wolves to kill livestock but
they haven’t,” he said. “They live on
wild prey.”

Dr. Mech said he was also encour-
aged by changing public attitudes.

' Recent opinion polls in Minnesota,

; Wyoming and Montana indicate that

most residents support efforts to

reintroduce wolves into their states. 1

Opposition was expressed mostly by L \
stockmen and people associated with

hunting.

Judging by the polls, the public no
longer _Views the evil creature de—
picted in such tales as “Little Red
Riding Hood.” In fact, Dr. Mech said,

the savage, threatening wolf was

never more than a myth. He said
there is no recorded instance of a non-
rabid wolf attacking and killing a
human being in this country.

Another myth, Dr. Mech said, is the

' increasingly popular view of the wolf
_ as an amiable creature that befriends
_ human beings and lives largely on

mice and other small animals. This
View has been put forward in such

.. works as Farley Mowat’s book
- Never Cry Wolf” and in the movie-

based on it.

In reality, he said, wolves are shy
creatures that avoid human contact
and live largely on large hoofed ani-
mals such as deer, elk and moose.

Southwest and Mexico;

Alaska has from 4,000 to 8,000
wolves. They are not an endangered
species in Alaska, and state has been
shooting them from aircraft in recent
years to reduce their taking of moose,
elk, caribou and other large game
animals valued by hunters.

In Canada there are still 25,000 to .
30,000 wolves. The reason they were
not eliminated in Canada as they ~
were in this country, according to Mr.
Nowak of the Fish and Wildlife Serv-
gice, is that far less of that country is ‘
:fsuitable for ranching. “The intensity
’ of combat against the wolf is always
5 most intense when people’s livestock
is at stake,” he said.

The provincial government of Brit-
ish Columbia has encouraged the
hunting of wolves to reduce losses of
game animals. The practice has been
bitterly criticized by conservationists
in Canada and the United States be-

'_ But ranchers in the area seem to be

“You can’t plunk these animals
down in an area where "they can’t

5,000 sheep on his ranch 50 miles
north of Yellowstone near Dillon,
Mont. “We are not a wild area out
here. The wolf plan introduces a large
predator who eats pre‘y every day.
But the wildlife prey base is not there.
The prey base is now livestock.” '
Mr. Helle said ranchers strongly
opposed the idea of being compen-

wolves. “We are not in the business of

“the wolves are under siege again. ‘

like, so they don’t bring thosein.

And there’s just more horses . . .
“Due to the bad weather condi-

tions out there and not enough
food to make it through the win-

ter, there are a lot of horses that

die of starvation. And that’s

what the government is trying

to keep from happening.”

Although they receive approx- ‘
imately 500 horses a year, Mrs. .

Carr said, they’ve only seen 20 or
30 true mustangs come through
their center in the past eight
years. '

“A true mustang is really only
about 13 or 14 hands high (about
41/2 feet) and has one less verta-
brae than a dOmestic horse. Very
few true mustangs exist today
because the breed has been bred
out.”

Burros aren’t readily avail-
able, either. “Burros have come
under management level. There
are not that many to find‘any

more."

Still, the Carrs continue to see
a demand for burros because the
animals protect cattle from
coyotes and other wild animals.
Unlike horses, burros eat this-
tles. thus cleaning up a part of
the land that the horse won’t eat.

But whether adopting a burro
or a wild horse, people have to
think about the responsibility
involved. “Our contract covers
that we are paid on a per-head
basis. Well, we can be contrac-
tors where we just really send
out a lot (of h'orses), but then I
think that would come back to
haunt us. So, we are pretty
strict," Mrs. Carr said.

“If somebody comes in the of-
fice and they’re impatient with

 

 

 

the government form or impa-
tient about picking out or load-
ing up. then they don’t have
enough patience for a Wild
horse. So, we just tell them that."

“I' give them the phone numa

her.

The Carrs have known of cases
in which horses have killed
themselves because somebody
who doesn’t know how to halter
break a horse takes them home
and just ties them to a fence. A

suring him that all was well before

heading back for more trysting

. behind the rock.

' Intentionality is what scientists
' in this realm call a “mental state,"
' clearly a prerequisite for thinking.

' David Premack and his colleagues
at the University of California,
Berkeley, set Out some years ago to
see if a chimpanzee was able to
attribute a mental state to a human
being.

It was a new wrinkle on earlier
studies that had shown that a
chimpanzee was smart enough to
figure out that by piling two boxes
up to make a platform, it could
reach some bananas hung other-
wise out of reach. .

E]

In this instance, Premack
showed a chimpanzee a videotape
of a human jumping up and down,
waving his arms, trying to reach a
bunch of bananas overhead. Then
the chimp was shown several pho-

_' tographs. .

Most of them were utterly irrele-
vant, but one photo showed two
boxes piled one on top of the other.
The chimp had never been in-
volved in the reaching-for-the-ba-
nana gambit, but it had been
trained that the choice of a situa-
tionally relevant photograph would
lead to a reward. The chimp chose.
the photograph of the boxes piled

. up. ‘
It is difficult not to think that the
chimp correctly attributed a men- .

‘ tal state—intention-to the human ‘
since otherwise the photograph of
two boxes piled up would have had
no meaning whatsoever. ‘

El

Deceit and cheating may have
played a significant role in the
origins and development of intel-
lect. That is because deceit and
cheating are the reverse of recipro-
cal altruism, which is practiced
among many animals besides hu-
mans—most notably perhaps
among our primate cousins.

In the Gombe Reserve, for exam—
ple, scientists often spot a male
baboon enlisting the aid of another
male to help attack a third male,
usually when the third, one is
involved with an estrous female. '

Typically in such situations, the
first baboon runs off with the
female while the enlistee and the

cuckold finish the fight. In the
words of Colin Beer of Rutgers, the
“solicited male gets the blows
while his friend gets the girl.”
Importantly, observers have found

that mare dig-7:1 than not the solic-
ited male later asks for the same
favor, and it is granted. Long-term
partnerships form from such coop-
eration.

For such a situation to arise—
and to work well enough to contin-
ue—several factors must be pres-
ent. First, the society in question
has to be small enough so that all"
the members can recognize one

“ another. (You wouldn’t expect 'a

pair of sea gull con artists to team

. u .)
pSewnd, the group has to .be
’ stable enough over time to prov1de

opportunities for the repetitive
getting and giving of aSSistance.
And the members of the group

1 have to be smart enough to keep
i score.

Even so, given the notion that it
is to a male’s advantage to sow his
genes as far and wide as pos31ble, ,
there could be a payoff for a
cheater. A blatant cheater who
accepted help but never proffered
it in return would probably not get
away with it for very longbefore
being ostracized, but this still
leaves considerable inducement for
ever more clever attempts to cheat
(like the hamadryad female con-
sarting behind the rock). And this
in turn would force the altruists in
the society to become ever more
clever in spotting deceitful behav-
ior.

El

Some scientists have suggested
f that it was precisely this kind of

“arms race” between two strate-
gies—cheating and altruism—that
ultimately escalated into the high-
est form of intelligence we know:
ours. ~-

But certainly, th kind of altru-'

ism observed in the Gombe ba-

boons cannot be understood as

 

anything but intentional. One ani-
mal must persuade another that it
wants help and that it will return
the favor. That sounds like think-
ing. -

Even so, this are’a of science is a
perilous thicket, replete with prob-
lems of definition as well as experi-
mental design and interpretation.
But today a growing number of
scientists are beginning to peer.
through that opaque lens that sep-
arates us, so completely it seems,
from the rest of animal life and,
perhaps, mind.

As different as we are from other
animals, we share an enormous
array of physiological, biochemical
and behavioral similarities. .

As Carolyn Ristau of New York’s
Rockefeller University has said:
“We and most existent animal life
have nervous Systems that are
remarkably similar, and most neu—
rons are connected by synapses
that also seem quite similar.

“If we wish to assume other
species are not conscious, what is it
that is so distinctly different about

our nervous system that precludes
consciousness in other species?”

Device Gauges the Universality of Animal Language

In the 1950s, Bell Laboratories
developed a machine called a
sound spectrograph for the anal-
ysis of the human voice. The
device quickly came to the atten-
tion of wildlife biologists, particu-
larly ornithologists who were in-
terested in using it to analyze
animal sounds and calls.

Although we may hear such
sounds as a single tone, they
actually consist of a combination
of numerous pitches.

The sound spectrograph con-
tains a bank of frequency filters,
each of which responds to a

specific range. It breaks down
incoming sounds into their fre-
quency components. A stylus re-

sponds to the various signals and"

makes marks on a strip of paper,
drawing a “contour map” of the
sound. Frequency is shown verti-
cally, duration horizontally.
According to Eugene Morton,
an ornithologist at the National

Zoo, it doesn’t take a great deal of ‘

practice before one can begin
“seeing”
dimensional way.

Over the years. as a student of

a bird in this two-

bird song, Morton immersed him-
self in the sonograms of thou-
sands of birds. Eventually he
began to perceive a pattern or
“vocabulary” emerging. He also
knew a bit about the sounds that
mammals make and how they
appeared in sonograms. They too
appeared to share the pattern.
Morton saw, he said, “not a trend,
but what seemed to be a law.”

So he began to test his hy-
pothesis with zoo colleagues, ex-
perts in communication among
creatures such as elephants and
tigers. There followed a “pretty

baring” period involving a long
and painstaking search of scien—
tific literature and comparisons of
hundreds of sonograms.
Eventually the thesis was con-

_ firmed and Morton announced the

existence of a nearly universal
language of .“expressive sound
symbols” among animals.

Today a machine is available

i that displays the sonogram on a

screen at the same time it is
heard. “You see it like water
falling past you,” Morton said.

HOUSTON POST - October 28, 1987

 

 

 

By PETE WITI‘ENBERG
Post Reporter »

 

Witches will ride their broom-
sticks this Halloween without
black cats to accompany them if
Houston’s SPCA has its way.

The Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals will with-
draw its black cats from adoption
today through Saturday because
of past abuses, including some
blamed on devil worshipers.

“Some cats are physically mis-
treated,” said SPCA health direc-

 

 

tor Alison Mata. “Occult groups
get hold of them. Then they’ll say
they found them in the street, run
over. But the cats have been beat-
en.”

More common is the practice
of taking out black cats temporar-
ily for adornments with Hallow-
een costumes or for Halloween
parties, Mata said.

“People will bind their legs
with tape so they won’t move
around. You can see where the
hair has been pulled out when
they took the tape off the legs.”

The SPCA’s Lou Guyton with some cats that can’t be adopted until after Halloween.

Cats have alWays been subject~
ed to more abuse than other ani-

,mals, whether at Halloween or

any other time, said Richard
Rains, Houston Humane Society
shelter manager.

“People throw them, pick
them up by the tail, stick tire-
crackers under them,” Rains said.

The SPCA about five years ago
began removing its black cats
from its adoption wing and hous-
ing them in its clinic until Hallow-

een was over to prevent such
abuses, Mata said. .

“We formerly were just like a big
pet store,” she said. “In 1982 or
1983, we changed to an adoption
policy. We weed out the people
who are just looking for a tempo-
rary pet, then bring it back because
they don’t want it.” '

Last Halloween, a couple in full-
dress costume —— the woman in
witch’s garb —-— came in and asked
for a black cat for two hours. They
were turned down, Mata said.

“They’ll put them on a leash or
hold them in their arms. A bar hav-
ing a Halloween party called asking

for cats. Cats are petrified by the
noise and the crowd,” she said.
Mata said most of her knowledge
of Halloween abuses of black cats
comes from her previous experi-
ence with a veterinary clinic.
“We’d get three or four abuse
calls every Halloween,” she said.
“Some cats would be decapitated,
others would have broken necks.”
The Humane Society relies on
in-depth screening of would-be cat
fanciers rather than place all its
black felines in a back room, Rains
said. .
Pet shops differed in their poli-
cies. The Pet Spoilers, with two lo—
cations, “is in the habit of not sell-
ing black cats during Halloween,”

said owner Barbara Brock. Pet
.Kingdom reported sales continue
as usual. . .

“lf youngsters call looking for a
black cat, we can tell they just want
it for a prank,” Brock said. .

Rains and Mata said abuse of
goats in the Halloween period also
increases particularly because of
occult practices. Goats apparently
used as sacrifices are found with
their throats cut, Mata said.

The SPCA, which normally has
15—20 black cats out of a feline
population of about 35, will in the
meantime keep temptation out of
sight.

“We tell people we have none
for adoption,” Mata said. '

HUDSON, N.H. — Al Jones loves animals. And he loved Ben-.

son’s Animal Park. Yesterday, he did something about both.

At the auction of animals and equipment at the recently
closed Hudson amusement park and 200, Jones bought himself
a 3-year-old elephant named Tanya for $14,500.

The purchase is the culmination of a love affair with pachy-
derms that began at Benson‘s 37 years ago and the fulfillment
of a dream for the insurance consultant.

Benson’s. a 65-year-old zoo and amusement park. renamed
New England Playworld last year, fell victim to rising costs and
declining attendance and closed Oct. 12. Yesterday‘s auction
was the result. > p

More than 1,200 people attended the opening day of the

two-day sale of exotic animals and amusements in which more

than 300 animals. including a gorilla, four elephants. a white
rhino and other members of endangered species, were up for
bid. .

Auctioneer David A. Norton. owner of a Norton Auctioneers.
a Michigan company that specializes in 2005 and amusements.
was dressed like a carnival barkerin a red sports coat and
electric blue trousers as he surveyed the crowd. He reported
that people came “from as far afield as Puerto Rico, California
and Asia.” All paid $10 forthe privilege of attending the auc-
tion — “to keep the sightseers out of the way of the serious
bidders,” he said — and each bidder was required to hold per-
mits to buy exotic or endangered animals.

Bids were solicited in a rapid-fire blur of words and figures
over a loudspeaker on a pickup truck~ that rolled from cage to
cage through the 80-acre park. . '

Where There Can Be 3 Pa ten 1‘" on Life

By KEITH SCHNEIDER
Special to The New York Times

DAVIS, Calif. ——

, ' , _ Old MacDonald

_ N. ' ' had a farm, and on

’ .rro' ‘ that farm he had
. some geeps.

In an experimental barnyard here
on the University of California cam-
pus, researchers are raising the
world’s largest herd of man-made
livestock, an astonishing group of
creatures with the faces and horns of
goats and the bodies of sheep.

Most of the animals, called geeps,

- are still babies, peeking from behind
the legs of their mothers, which are

_ adult sheep. But an adult geep gave

, birth to a sheep last summer. Goats

‘, have shown promise of bearing

. geeps. And more sheep are expected

5 soon to have little geeps. ’

Dr. Gary Anderson and his col-

‘ leagues have made nine geeps by tak-

' ing cells from a seven-day-old goat

1 embryo and inserting them into a
seven-daybld sheep embryo, then im-
planting the joint embryo into a ewe’s
womb. ‘

Nowhere is the power of the new
life-transforming techniques in ani-
mal biotechnology more clearly evi-
dent than in the open barns of this 79-
year-old university, a renowned cen-
ter for farm research previously
known best for developing square,
thick-skinned processing tomatoes
and huge machines to harvest them.

For years the University of Califor-
nia at Davis, which is about 15 miles
west of Sacramento, has been at the
center of a national debate over its
advocacy of an increasingly ad—
vanced and industrialized form of

. agriculture dependent on chemicals,

machines and the ability to design
plants and animals to fit that produc-
tion system.

With the development of the geeps,
new criticism has erupted, even as ‘
supporters have been energized,
showering this campus in recent
months with cheers and jeers.

The geeps are the handiwork of Dr.
Anderson, a 40-year-old reproductive
physiologist who prefers to call his
creations chimeras. In Greek mythol-
ogy, chimeras were monstrous ani-
mals, part serpent, part lion and part
goat. Dr. Anderson’s geeps are nei-

ther horrible nor ugly. They are, he

believes, intelligent, agile and sturdy. ,

Geeps just look strange. The oldest,

Duchess, was born in April 1985 to a

‘ sheep. Duchess has the face and eyes
of a goat, but the rest of her is, well,
quite sheepish. She has short legs,
cleft hooves and thick wool.

Dr. Anderson insists his research is
invaluable for studying the functions
and vital processes in livestock preg-
nancies. “We are learning about the

nature of the barrier which prevents

an embryo of one species from being
carried to term by another species,“
he said.

Understanding how the process
works, Dr. Anderson added, could

lead to many important advances, in-

cluding the abili

gered species by implanting fertilized
eggs into more common animals that
would act as surrogate mothers.

But ever since his research was na-
tionally publicized in April, after the
United States Patent and Trademark
Office said animals that were the
“nonnaturally occurring manufac-

tures" of man could be patented, Dr.

Anderson has been criticized by advo-

cates of animal rights who say such

tinkering violates the sanctity of life.

Because geeps are formed from
cells of sheep and goat embryos, ewes
would ordinarily be expected to abort
the pregnancies as foreign tissue. But
in most cases the implanted embryos
are not rejected, Dr. Anderson said,
suggesting that the cells of the geep
embryo send the proper biological
signals and encourage the develop-
ment of a healthy womb and placenta
to nurture the geep fetus until birth.

“This is a productive model that
will lead to significant contributions
to our understanding of develop-
ment,” said Dr. Anderson.

Last June, in a test of her reproduc-
tive capabilities, Duchess acted as a
surrogate mother and gave birth to a

Lion victim

doing well,
doctor says

Owner of beast
sought by police

By MIKE YUEN
' Post Reporter

 

 

A neurosurgeon who operated

on the 8-year-old Houston girl at-

‘ tacked by a 300-pound lion Oct. 10

said Tuesday he is encouraged by
the recovery the child is making.

Dr. Michael E. Miner warned,
however, that it is still unclear. what
the long-term impact the attack
will have on Roxanne Hernandez.

“Over the last 10 days, Roxanne
has done quite well,” said Miner,
director of neurosurgery at the Uni-
versity of Texas Medical School.
“She’s able to talk, able to eat, able
to stand, able to understand what’s
going on about her, able to enjoy
her family and other people and
certainly to bring joy to her family.
But she’s still in the midst of treat-
ment and this treatment is going to
last at least for several more
months.”

There is “no clear evidence”
that the damage to her brain tissue
has hampered Roxanne’s learning
ability, Miner said. Nor is it appar-
ent what long-term psychological
impact the attack will have on the
child, Miner said.

Psychiatrists also are seeing the
child and testing her learning abili-
ties.

The girl, who has been operated
on twice, will undergo further skin
grafts this week, Miner said.

Roxanne’s mother, Sonia, 27,
said, “I’m glad she’s alive, and she

.. acts like the same little girl she
was.” '

Meanwhile, the owner of the lion

. that mauled Roxanne has ,disap-
i‘ peared, and police want to ques-
‘1 tion him further, authorities said

Tuesday, the eve of a Harris Coun-

ty grand jury investigation into the

attack. .

with a “talking cat”?
”My news-handling job has many

some things I don’t want to know.

1987 had already cost me Whit and Mike

about it, except that once you give an
animal a name it becomes a member of
the family. .

We buried one of the barn cats Satur-

Despite our best efforts, it was an
uncomfortable demise. Later inthe
afternoon I’m alone in the hammock
between two spreading oak trees, con-

“Smoky.” Entirely uninvited she’d

Indians such as Andrew Bertrand face a loss of hunting grounds and jobs.

Fur foes threaten to leave

.

Indians out in the cold *

By Howard Witt

Chicago Tribune

, T. LIARD, Northwest -
.f' Territories—Andrew Bertrand and
'3 his family do not wear fur coats,

' although furs surely would help to

ward off the cold that scoffs at the
,‘moldering cardboard and tattered
plastic enlisted to tuckpoint their
wilderness cabins 50 miles south of
here. , ' -
. It is not for lack of opportunity that
they have made this choice. The
Bertrands, Slavey Indians whose
forebears survived for centuries in the
- isolated bush along the border of the
Northwest Territories and British
Columbia, annually trap scores of
beavers, martens and lynxes. -

The pelts eventually become luxurious
coats sold in swank urban stores that i
the family can scarcely imagine, in
places such as Toronto and New York
and Paris that they likely Will never see.

Nor do they shun fur out of moral
objections to killing animals for fashion.
The Bertrands, vaguely aware that
people in cities thousands of miles
distant raise such objections, say they
are mystified by them. »

For the Bertrands, not wearing fur is

simply a matter of economics. They say”

they can’t afford to.

“If it’s a really badly damaged pelt,
maybe we’ll keep it for a hat or .
somethin ,” said Andrew Bertrand, 34,
his gaze rxed on several of his young
nieces and nephews playing outside in .
torn shirt sleeves on a, near—freezing fall
morning. .

“‘But anything we can take to sell, we
sell. There is no other way to get
money so we can continue to trap and
survive.” ‘ . . »

As Bertrand matter—of-factly explains
it, each year’s trapping income—his
father, Francis, 65, had an especially '

ood season last year, making about

6,000—just about pays off the
previous year’s bills for supplies bought
on credit at the nearest Hudson Bay
outpost, in Ft. Liard, north by boat
along the placid Liard River.

natives who continue the struggle to
preserve their vanishing cultures in _
isolated settlements across Canada’s
vast north. ‘ '

On lands they once owned"

indisputably—lands now the subject of
complex legal claims lodged against the
federal and provincial governments that .
took them over—the Indians persist in
traditionalwavs of hunting and . ' i 13"]: :r

trapping “in the face of a rapidly

encroaching modern world.

But as the winter trapping season -
approaches, the future looks especrally
bleak to the 500 Slavey Indians of Ft.
Liard, a band of the Dene Nation who
live scattered in wilderness .clearrngs
along the Liard River. Their problems
and fears largely are unknown by the
outside world, even as it'squeezes them
harder from every direction, . .7 -

To the est, the natives say, 011 and

4 gas pipeli es that bisecttheir trap lines .
'1 have polluted their tradrtrona] fishing
lakes. The younger Slavey have had to

come up with a new phrase intherr
native language to try to explain. to .
their elders the appearance of seismic
lines all around them, narrow cleanngs
bulldozed through the bush by .
geologists in search of 011 deposrts.

The phrase is “me che ne et te ne,”
which means “trail made by a true ”

Just 10 miles south of the place where
the Bertrands live, clear—cut loggrng
operations sanctioned by the British
Columbian government are felling vast
stands of forest, causing the wrldhfe that
long has sustained the Indians to
disperse ever farther. - a

The Slavey have a new phrase for
this, too, which translates “place where
there are no more trees.” -

And from the urban centers far to the
southeast, the isolated Indians hear the
strange new drumbeats of a
strengthening animal-rights movement
that would shut down their fur. trade.
Words in Slavey to describe thrs
phenomenon have eluded them so far.

“We don’t understand what the norse
is about, but we know one thing: If you
shut down trapping, people up here are
going to suffer a lot more than the
animals do,” said Fred Berreault, 54, a

cousin of the Bertrands and, like
his father and grandfather, a
trapper all his life. _ ,
‘i‘People here don’t go to school.
They live in the bush, and they
haVe big families to support. You
, shut down trapping, and what will
. we live on? We can’t just eat
‘ berries.” '
’ ' There'is nething simple about
- the existence the Bertrand family
. has, carved out of this unforgiving
= wilderness, although the fresh
" moose carcass hanging from a pole
and the sweet wood smoke rising
from old iron stoves might suggest
a stereotypical vision of Indian
. bliss. ' ‘ ‘ .
It took high-powered riﬂe shells,
. at 75 Cents each, to kill that
mouse. It takes gasoline, at $2.50 a
1 gallon .rin that remote region, to
powerrthe metorboats and
snowmobiles necessary to reach the
ever-receding game stocks, and
costly parts to repair the machines
: when they break down.
Charter plane ﬂights, at, $500 or
f "more, frequently are necessary to
take furs to outside markets when
the prices offered by the fur buyer ,
at the local Hudson Bay store are '
too low. Grocery Staples and

 




clothing are as much. as ‘30‘percent‘

f more expensive than in the
, urbanized south. -

' The inescapable pressures of the Z

' modem world, born of the first
vrsrts of 17th Century European
fur traders to North America, long
:ago. forced Canada’s wilderness
Indians to succumb to a cash
economy. The need for modern
equipment to pursue their .
itradrtions binds them inextricably
to_that economy. And domestic
SklllS have been lost as
contemporary life overtakes them.

“It was easier‘ for my
grandfather,” Fred Berreault said as
he reached for a small $2-jar of
store-bought jam, kept on a‘ '
tabletop with other perishables

4 because there are no refrigerators.

“They didn’t have to buy all _ ’

 

“these-thing's from white people.
They didn’t need thegas and the
, snowmobiles because the animals

~ were closer. .

“Now,” he continued in a voice
betraying less anger than
. resignation, “they take the gas
from our land, send it south, then
truck it back up here to sell to us.”

For families such as the
Bertrands, who say they shun an
array of available social welfare
programs for reasons of pride and
independence, fur provides the only
way to earn the cash they need.

But if the issues are complex in
the wilderness, they are no simpler
in Toronto, home to a burgeoning
North American animal-rights
movement that is moving -

, aggressively to ﬁght the commercial
use of fur. , ;

Motivated by fundamental moral
concerns over the killing of animals
for human adornment and
' buttressed by evidence that many
fur-bearing animals do appear to
die inhumane deaths at the hands
of some fur trappers and fur
ranchers, the animal-rights groups
say they are preparing an
international public relations
campaign to persuade consumers
to shun furs during the fall and
winter fur-buying season. ‘

“Wearing fur is quite simply a
moral issue,” said Michael
O’Sullivan, Canadian representative
of the World Society for the
Protection of Animals, the leading
international antifur organization.

“Society cannot justify the
' commercial killing of wildlife
because it’s of pretty questionable
social value.”

Fur sales are a $75 million
business annually in Canada, and
the commercial fur industry,
backed by various federal and
provincial government agencies

‘. that promote the wildlife harvest,

surprisingly has not rallied to the
defensive.

To answer charges that trapping
is inhumane, the industry has - _
striven to persuade wilderness

trappers to abandon old-style
leghold traps, with their ominous
steel teeth, in favor of new “quick-
. kill” traps that are supposed to
break an animal’s neck with a
spring-loaded device.

The industry has put forward
scientific studies, scorned by
animal-rights groups, that purport
to show that commercial harvesting
does not imperil wildlife
populations. And where all else has
failed, the industry has sought
openly to portray the antifur
groups as radicals and kooks.

Into the middle of this heated
propaganda war the Indian has
been thrust by both sides. Although
wild-caught fur accounts for only
about 15 percent of the world fur
market, the balance being
“ranched” fur from animals raised

on commercial farms, it comprises

about half of Canada’s fur exports,
and beleaguered Indians make
powerful symbols for either side. ~

The fur industry emphasizes the
damage that will be done to native
trappers if the antifur movement 15
successful. For its part, the antifur
movement cynically suggests that
the Indians are being used by an
industry that, as O’Sullivan says,
“has never done natives any
favors,” having made them
financially dependent on a fur-

, buying system over which they
exert no control.

Canada’s major native ,_
organizations, meanwhile, have
formed their own group, ‘

. Indigenous Survival lntemational,
to speak for them. They resent

what they see as the pious morality

of the animal-rights groups and at
the same time fear that the fur
industry ultimately will sacrifice
their interests to expediency.
“These urban people are asking
the native people who live closest

to the land to give up their way of -
life, and for what? To appease their

own consciences,” said Cindy
Gilday, a Dén’e Indian who .
recently moved from Yellowknife,

Northwest Territories, to Toronto

; to run Indigenous Survival.

_ “Respect for animals is nothing
g new for native people, although it

, is new for people in the cities who. ‘
y have destroyed all the wildlife

around them.” . .
Gilday worries that the fur ”

L industry eventually might agree to .
-- a ban on fur trapped in the wild,

both to appease animal-rights
groups and to deprive them of
their most powerful propaganda

. photos that show wild animals .

caught in traps, chewing on their
own legs to escape.
“Wild-caught-fur is the only area
our people are involved in and the
only area where the industry can

, give without losing too much,” she

said.
. Such sophisticated debates in the _
cities still seem very far away to
the Indians at Ft. Liard, although
Andrew Bertrand, in a new role as
-- a part—time wildlife officer and
T trapping instructor for the
1 Northwest Territories, attempts to
; explain them. ,
* So far, Bertrand said, his Indian
"brethren are willing to trade in
‘1 their traditional leghold traps for
, newer varieties. While they reason
that doing so might cool the
_ hostility of the antifur groups, they
are making the switch pnmarrly
because the new traps are more
effective and are less likely to
damage an animal’s pelt, Bertrand _—

fr

3‘ said. ‘

His father, Francis, however,
speaks for most when he expresses
his, frank bewilderment over the '

. whole issue. .. ,
g “A lot {of people say it’s cruel to
kill animals,” he mused inhis
j native Slavey, translated by his son.
3' “But outhere you see animals with
diseases and starvation, and they ,
die a lot worse deaths in the bush
than in traps. Trapping makes a
balance in nature. It prevents
’ overpopulation and starvation.

“It, was the white man,” he
added‘finally, “who came here for
fur in the ﬁrst place. And now he

doesn’t want it anymore?” . .

TA PLASTIC SEA

Long-lasting trash is killing ocean life, researchers warn

By Dianne Dumanoski

When National Marine Fish-

small submarine down 50 miles
or so offshore on Georges Bank
recently. one of the first things
encountered was a fish with .a
plastic six-pack yoke hooked
around its gills.

Persistence is not a virtue in

along the
North Atlantic than 15 years ago.
The researcher who conducted
' the study, R. Jude Wilber, a staff
scientist at the Sea Education As-
sociation in Woods Hole, said he
did not set out to study ”plastic
pollution," but the subject became
literally unavoidable. On research
cruises he says,‘ you couldn’t put
a net over the side without getting
plastic." .

“Just about every commercial,
recreational or research vessel
throws plastic trash over the
side,” Wilber said. “Years ago
when most packaging was card-

board or paper, there was no»

buildup because these materials
degrade rapidly.”

lndiscriminate dumping of
trash is still “standard practice"
on most oceangoing commercial
vessels, Wilber said, and consti—
tutes a significant source of the
plastic pollution that is wide-
spread even far offshore. Closer to
shore, waters are fouled with fa-
miliar litter such as bags, cups
and disposable containers.

Global treaty

A global marine pollution‘trea-
ty has been negotiated to address
the problem of garbage dumping
at sea, but it awaits the ratifica-
tion of countries representing half
of the world’s shipping commerce.
US ratification of the treaty,
which is pending in the Senate
and is expected to pass, will bring
the agreement into effect.

Kathy O‘Hara of the Center f0r
Environmental Education said
the National Academy of Sciences
has estimated that one-third of
the plastic debris in the oceans
originates from US sources.

A bill introduced by Rep. Gerry
Studds (D—Mass.) to implement the
treaty in the United States passed
the House on Oct. 13. The Studds
bill prohibits the dumping of plas-

tic anywhere, whether on the high
seas or in territorial waters. And
though the Navy had sought to to
be exempted, the no-dumping pro-
visions in the bill apply to Navy
ships and private vessels. In the
Senate, similar bills are still in
committee.

Plastic trash can travel widely
once it is dumped over the side.
Because of currents, Wilber found.
beaches in spots like Bermuda be

plastic trash from all over the
North Atlantic.

Along the New England coast.
which is not touched by currents
that drag in trash from the open
ocean, the plastic debris washing
up on the beaches is largely of re-
gional origin. “If we could clean
up the neighborhood,” Wilber ob-
served, “you would clean up both
the water and the beaches.”

Hundreds of pounds of trash

According to figures published
by the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology Sea Grant Program.
volunteers have collected about
170 pounds of trash per mile —
most of it plastic — on Massachu‘
setts beaches during annual
cleanup days in coastal communi—
ties.

Beyond these figures, said
Thomas Bigford from the National
Marine Fisheries Service's North-
east office in Gloucester, “we don’t
know how much of a problem we
have.”

Bigford, the Northeast region's
chief of habitat conservation, said
research is being done on plastic
pollution and wildlife in the North
Pacific, which is considered to
have the worst problem national-
ly. But no similar effort is taking
place in the Northeast, in part be—
cause officials in Washington as-
sume the problem is less severe. “I
would feel more comfortable
knowing that for a fact". he said.

While the situation in the
Northeast may be less severe,“ Big-
ford thinks the situation is, in

fact, “worse than we see." Albert
Manville, a staff biologist for De-
fenders of Wildlife and chairman
of The Entanglement Network.
agreed, noting that “most animals

In the past few years, the Prov-
incetown Center for Coastal stud—
ies has successfully freed several

feed or swim properly because
they were entangled in lost or dis-
carded plastic fishing nets. These
“ghost nets" can continue to fish
on their own for years after they ,
become separated from a fishing
boat killing hundreds of birds
and marine mammals, including
endangered whales. Before plas-
tics, nets lost at sea would rot
after a time.

Mistaken for food

Entanglement is, however, just
one of the hazards that plastic pol-
lution poses. Wildlife specialists
report that turtles often eat plastic
bags — mistaking them for one of
their favorite foods, jellyfish — and
die from blocked intestines. Birds
and seals have been found stran-
gling from six-pack yokes.

Some states, including Mass-
achusetts, now require that six
pack yokes be made of photode;

after exposure to sunlight. This re—
quirement will not however, help

Trained lion that bit man
wins reprieve from death

Associated Press

CRYSTAL BEACH, Texas — A 320-
pound lion in training for a motor-
ized jet ski show won a reprieve
from death Thursday pending a
hearing on whether it should be de-
stroyed for biting a man.

‘ State District Judge Ed Harris is-

sued a temporary restraining order
against the Galveston County
Health District, which sought to
have the African lion named
Shanda destroyed so it could be
tested for rabies. A hearing was
scheduled for Oct. 22.

Tuesday’s attack on Shawn
Schilder, 20, of Port Bolivar, was the
second lion attack in the Houston
area in four days. Schilder was
treated at John Sealy Hospital in
Galveston and released.

Roxanne Hernandez, 8, was
mauled Saturday by a 300-pound
lion being led through a north
Houston flea market on a leash. The
. girl remains in the intensive care
unit at Hermann Hospital. The lion
was killed.

Shanda’s owner, Mike Kujawa,
said he was desperately trying to
find a way to avoid having his lion
killed for laboratory analysis.

“It’s kind of like a witch hunt, ”
Kujawa said. “I guess they are asso-
ciating it with the other lion inci-
dent. ”

He said he had been training the
lion to ride a remote-controlled jet

ski in the ocean off this seaside l

town as part of an exotic animal ex-
hibition.

“This one is about 90 percent (ca-
pable of) running aKawasaki jet
ski, ” he said. “I’ve got pictures of
her on the water.”

Kujawa said two friends were
trying to locate Schilder to ask him
to take rabies shots so the lion
won’t have to die.

Kujawa, 25, said Schilder, an oc-
casional employee of his Crystal
Beach Riding Stable, was bitten
when he fell chest-down on the ani-
mal’s head.

But Joe Vickery, Galveston

-County Health District sanitarian,

said Schilder had walked up to the
declawed animal to pet it and then
was attacked in Kujawa’s front
yard. Vickery said officials were not
concerned over why the lion at-
tacked the man.

Texas health codes prescribe
killing wild animals for rabies tests
rather than quarantining them for
10 days, as is done with domestic an-
imals, he said.

Kujawa told the Houston Chroni-
cle that the lion was to be one of
several exotic animal exhibits at
his planned Crystal Beach Zoologi-
cal Gardens and that he had a per-
mit to display the lion that was is-
sued last November by the health
district.

But Vickery said Kujawa was in
violation of the permit.

health officials want put to death after

Wendell Sandlin Jr. with Toby, one of his tigers at the Tiger Truck Stop. Sandlin owns four tigers.

By JACK DOUGLAS
Post Reporter

 

Four tigers caged at a northeast Hous-
ton truck stop were seized by city animal
control officers because they were with-
in easy reach of'the public, authorities
said Tuesday. ‘

The big declawed cats were taken
from the Tiger Truck Stop at 4101 Ful-
ton Monday aftemoon and then returned
Tuesday morning to their owner, who
was cited for allegedly violating a city
ordiance.

The city of Houston Bureau of Animal
Regulation and Care seized the tigers
because they were penned in cages that
anyone could walk up to, said Dr. .Robert
E. Armstrong, bureau director.

A city ordinance, in effect since 1978,
requires such animals to be kept no less
than 300 feet from the public, Arm-

strong said, adding that public zoos and
veterinaries are exempt from the ordi-
nance. . .
Wendell Sandlin Jr., owner of the ti-
gers and the truck stop, said he had to
pay $300 in overnight boarding and re—
covery fees before he could get his ani-
mals back. Sandlin said he raised the two
Bengal tigers and the two Siberian cats
and that they were being used in a pro-
motional venture for his company.

He said he was upset that city officials A

did not warn him about their plans to
seize the tigers and that he had to pay
boarding fees for the animals’ short stay

‘at bureau headquarters in the 2700

block of Evella.

“If they had just approached me like a
reasonable man, I would have taken
them away (from the truck stop) until
we had this rectified,” Sandlin said. He
said he would keep the tigers on a re-

mote piece of property he owns in Mont-
gomery County while he fights the four
city citations he received, each of which
carries a fine of $175 to $200.

Sandlin also said animal control au-
thorities overreacted to a citywide scare
caused Oct. 10 when an 8-year-old girl
was mauled and critically wounded by a
lion at a north Houston flea market.

However, Armstrong said bureau offi-
cials were prudent in seizing the tigers
and that Sandlin had been warned he
was in violation of a city ordinance.

So far this year, Armstrong said, three
lions and the four tigers have been taken
into custody within the city limits.

Twenty “large jungle cats” have been
seized in Houston since late 1983, in-
cluding one jaguar, four bobcats, one
mountain lion, six African lions and
eight tigers, Armstrong said.

 

 

 

 




 

TAMPA TRIBUNE - October 18, 1987

  

iBy MARTY MARTH
g, Tribune Correspondent

An odd blip showed up on aerial photographs of '

4‘ Columbia County late in July, puzzling U. S. Forestry
Service personnel. What appeared to be a small figure
could be seen deep in the woods on a photograph.

. Curious, they enlarged the section showing the blip.
.. It was a pony, far from any home, from any care, from
';_jany humans.

Hoping to rescue the animal, forestry officials as-

‘Fsembled their aerial maps of the area and were able to '
. pinpoint the pony’s exact location. The Columbia Coun- '

f ty sheriff was called in.

’ Trekking deep into the forest, authorities found a
black pony, about 10 years old. He was listlessly roam-
ing the wilderness with a 12-foot tow chain embedded

, in his neck.

1 “We named him Sad Sam because he seems so sad, "

; said Laura Cohen, a veterinarian in High Springs, north

? of Gainesville. She surgically carved the chain out' of

I; the pony’s small neck.

.‘ Sam remained in her care for about a month before

being placed for adoption by Laura Cohen, who works

> 7 With the Humane Society and handled the case.

Had Sad Sam not been spotted by forestry officials,

' it is likely he would have died from snake bite, starva-

' tion or disease.

. Usually when officials find an orphaned animal in

‘ . Sam’s condition, Cohen said “it would be put down.”

> But in north Florida, Sad Sam become a media ce-

Sad Sam, a black pony about 10
years old, Was found deep In the forest
in Columbia County with a 12-foot chain
embedded in his neck.

lebrity. His progress and picture regularly appeared in '

newspapers and on television in the area.

Area humane societies, which are inundated this
year with reported animal cruelty cases, often involv-
ing horses, found Sad Sam an excellent public relations
subject. Because of Sam’s horrible dilemma -— walking
around with a tow chain growing into his neck — north
Florida residents have become more aware of increas-
ing animal abuse in the area.

“I think it did an awful lot to make the public more
aware of animal cruelty cases. It heightened public
awareness. This was more a case of negligence than
anything else. ”

In Sam’ 5 case, humane society investigators learned
the pony had been tethered by its owner in a back
yard. The owner had wrapped the tow chain around the
pony’s neck and fastened the chain to a concrete block.

Somehow, the chain came off the block and the ';
pony wandered off. g'
John H. Reed was found guilty of animal abuse

‘ Sept. 30. His case is now in the presentence investiga-

tion stage.

“It’s healed nicely,” said D.r Cohen, who treated the

animal for about a month. Perhaps Sam ought to be
dubbed “lucky” Sam. Once Cohen cut the chain out of
the pony’s neck it took 20 stitches to close the wound.
. For Cohen, cases like Sam all too frequently come
to her attention. “We’ve seen instances before where a
chain or halter has been left on a horse or a dog and
the skin has grown over it,” Cohen said. “That usually
happens because a collar or a chain is too tight. In this
case, I think it was the weight of the chain that caused
the damage.”

Humane officials and veterinarians report that
many cases of horse abuse can be linked to ignorance
on the part of owners.

“Too many people who acquire a horse do not know

what to feed it and when to feed it,” said Cohen. “And

they know little about vaccinations the horse needs or
the type of fencing and shelter that are necessary.

“l: have often thought new horse owners should be
required to take a horse care course,” she said.

Odds of that happening are, admittedly, rather slim.
So the odds of more cases like Sad Sam’s are, unfortu-
nately, likely.

This one, however, has a happy ending. . .
“We call him Farley now,” said Diana Lee, who '

adopted the pony. “He was called alot of thins in the

press, but Farley is more appropriate.

“He’s gained a lot of weight and has a 5-inch scar,
but with winter coming on Farley’s hair has about cov- ,
ered it. He’ s got his own pasture, about three-quarters
of an acre. He’ 3 happy. I think Farley thinks he’ s a dog.
He’ 3 ours for life now. ”

 




 

TAMPA TRIBUNE

:mBy ANN L. HUNTINGTON, D. V. M.

There are more than 38 million people age 65
or older in the United States today. Many live
alone. They are often lonely, and, in many in-
stances, their mental and physical health is dete-
riorating faster than it should. Why? For many,
the mere sense of being alone, inactivity and a
craving to feel needed and loved take their toll.
Here are just a few examples from my own expe-

rience:
A while back an elderly gentleman brought in

his aging dog, Nicole, a papillion, for a checkup.
The owner struck me as a rather frail man, but
he was extremely fond of Nicole. I learned that
he lived alone and, if it hadn’t been for his dog,
he probably never would have gotten any proper
exercise. He faithfully took Nicole out three
times a day for good walks.

He also might not have expended the effort
and energy to go to the grocery to buy food and
other necessities if he didn’t need to care for
Nicole. About six months after the initial visit,
Nicole died. It was then that I met the man’s
children, who admitted they were very worried
about what would happen to their father without
his beloved companion. They feared he would
cease trying to go on. And he did. Within months
he, too, died.

The benefits, both physical and psychological,
. that pets can confer on anyone, but particularly

on the elderly, are almost miraculous. Not only
do pets give lone senior citizens a sense of being
: needed and loved, but dogs, in particular, be-
; cause they require walking, give older people the
very exercise they‘ need to maintain physical and

mental well-being, help reduce high blood pres-

sure, and even speed recovery from an illness.

And this leads me to a beautiful solution: the
Purina Pets For People Program. The program
provides free pets for those over age 60. And in
addition to the dog or cat of their choice, each
owner also receives a collar, leash, food and wa-
ter bowl. Each pet receives all necessary shots
and is spayed or altered if necessary.

If this sounds too good to be true, it’s not. Just
call your local humane society. The Connecticut
Humane Society, Newington, Conn. (which han-
dles thousands of pets a year), provided the fol-
lowing information on the program:

Representatives of Purina carefully check out
the facilities of each society participating in Pets
for People (not all are approved). Once accredit-
ed, Purina provides the humane society with the
supplies to accompany each pet. Purina also de-
frays the expense of neutering (if necessary),
shots and the physical exam.

Humane societies mail each applicant an
adoption form to fill out, or the information may
be taken by telephone. Owners are then invited
to come and select a pet. If transportation is a
problem, some humane societies are willing to
take several pets to an applicant’s home for
him/ her to choose from. '

Puppies are not recommended due to prob-
lems associated with house training. However ap-
plicants may specify the size of dog they prefer
and the kind of temperament they’d feel most
comfortable with.

In return, owners must meet several basic
requirements. Those taking a dog must have eia
ther a back yardand/or be able to take the pet
out and give it needed exercise. If living space is;
confined and /or an applicant is unable to take a
dog for walks, obviously a cat would make a.
better roommate.

Owners must provide their new pet with a
safe and comfortable place to sleep, and proper.
food and fresh water (these requirements are
checked on). They, should also be able to bathe
and groom their pet when needed, and take it for.
regular veterinary checkups and vaccinations.

We need more a

Having just one animal control center in a
city of about 600 square miles is plainly ludi-
crous. Yet it is the way Houston handles stray
dogs and cats and exotic animals.

Los Angeles (440 square miles) had six fa-
cilities and opened a seventh last month. Chi-
cago’s dog pound is located right downtown.

Space City’s center, complete with slippery
floors and leaky roofs, lies tucked away in a
rundown neighborhood off North Jensen Drive
just inside the Loop. A few years ago, city
officials attempted to establish a second loca-
tion and even purchased some land. Predict-
ably, nearby neighborhoods would not allow it.

As far back as 1979, Houston voters ap—.

proved a bond program which supposedly in-
cluded the construction of two new centers.
Like a flea on a junkyard dog, the plan has
jumped on and off the city’s capital improve-
ment plans for the last eight years, languishing
as a low priority.

Just how low was highlighted last week
when a lion mauled an 8—year—old girl at a flea
market. The immediate reaction was to
strengthen animal control ordinances .so this
wouldn’t happen again.

Stronger laws, however, are not the answer.
Houston already has a stringent ordinance af—
fecting exotic animals like lions and tigers:
They must be kept 300 feet away from any
, human habitation. Dr. Robert Armstrong, head

of Houston’s animal control center, said Chica—

can Armstrong’s understaffed, low—priority di-

vision afford the time to educate people about ‘

walking their lions?

Councilman John Goodner, who generally
praises Armstrong for improvements he has
made in the city pound, said, “We’re suffering
from lack of knowledge of the law. What we
need to do is get the word out —- notify all
constables and private security agencies so
they know what the ordinance says.”

In his five years on the job, Armstrong has
caused many city officials to raise their eye-
brows. One time, for instance, he requested an
expensive cage for exotics like lions and tigers.
“We were asked, ‘When would you ever need
this?’ Now, as thelion incident demonstrates,
we get animals like these on somewhat of a
regular basis," he pointed out. .

.. animals shot to death last month

ed as threat to Air Force One

After visiting state-of-the-art animal control
centers around the nation, Armstrong came up -
with a high-tech plan for Houston -— a three—’

story, dome-shaped facility to be built adjacent ;

to his rundown center near the intersection of
Jensen and Evella. The city already owns the:
site, so was spared the usual neighborhood“;
protests that come with garbage landfills, low— ;
income housing and halfway houses. .

However, the bids for the soundproof, at-—f-
tractive center were about $1.2 million higher:
than the $2.6 million earmarked for the job..
Public Works now must cut down the specifi-;
cations before going out for “rebids,” a process :
which could take another two or three months. ':

Some portions of the dome plan are contro- 9
versial. A surgical area to make possible spay- '1
ing and neutering has raised the ire of private j
veterinarians, and Armstrong‘s insistence that;
tile floors are more cost-effective and sanitary

in the long run —— “tile doesn’t absorb urine;
like concrete” — has drawn criticism from
Councilman Larry McKaskle for being too ex»
travagant.

There is still too much foot—dragging after:
eight years of off-andnon planning. The city-
might even consider some interim repairs to;
the rundown center -—-— parts of which probably f
couldn’t pass a cursory safety inspection»
Things are pretty bad when — as some would 2
say -— they are not fit for a dog. ‘

TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) --- Two
dogs near an airport runway at
Forbes Field were shot to death
last month by security officers who
feared the dogs posed a danger to a
plane carrying President Reagan.
. The incident has prompted let-
ters of complaint to the White
House and threats on the life of the
man who ordered the dogs killed.
“We did what we had to do,”
said Marvin Hancock, deputy di—
', rector of the Metropolitan Topeka
Airport Authority. “We were told
' anything that moves has to be re-
moved.” '
Hancock said airport security of-

ficers were combing the grounds
Sept. 6 just before Reagan 'was
scheduled to arrive on Air Force
One. Reagan was in Topeka for a
pre-lOOth birthday celebration for
former Gov. Alf Landon, who died
last week.

A Secret Service spokesman said
officials ordered airport security to
“take care of the problem” of the
dogs, but he said he did not know
shooting the dogs was going to be
the solution.

“We were not involved in the
dog incident at all,” said Douglas
W. Buchholz, special agent in
charge of the Secret Service in the

Kansas City office.

Hancock and Buchholz were
quoted in Sunday’s editions of The
Kansas City Star.

Airport security officers first beat
the dogs, which were mating, with
heavy welding gloves in order to
separate them. When that failed,
they shot the dogs, Hancock said.
The bodies were carted off in plas-
tic bags and burned.

Hancock said the dogs might
have run onto the pavement and
interfered with the Boeing 707 jet
carrying the president. He said
there wasn’t time to move the dogs
or spray water on them before the

plane landed. ,
Hancock said he was surprised

by the controversy and added, “I

wasn’t aware that a dog’s life had a

greater value than the life of the

president of the United States."
Audrey McCaig, executive direc—

tor of Helping Hands Humane So- '-
ciety in Topeka, wrote a letter of ~

protest to Reagan on Sept. 14, she

the beauty parlor when she went to get a

Miss Grace does not bat an eye at
rattlesnakes.

Wolves are something else, though.

“As long as they stay put, they don’t
worry me a bit,” she said a tad edglly. “As
long as they don’t come near my house.”

Miss Grace's attitude, and the attitudes
of her neighbors, may be the most
important and least predictable elements in-
a grand experiment under way in Dare
County in North Carolina to secure the
future of the red wolf in North America.
The US. Fish and Wildlife Service is
making its first attempt to reintroduce into
the Wild 3 species that is believed to exist
only in captivity. The project’s director,
Warren Parker, says the program has five .
years and $135,000 to make a go of it. _

Only a half-hour’s drive inland from the
burger joints, beach rentals and surf shops
that litter Nags Head’s beach on the Outer
Banks, Mashoes (population 60) lies at the
edge of an impenetrable wilderness. Its 20-
odd houses form a wide boomerang at the
northern tip of a peninsula that was settled
in 1564 by a few English colonists looking ..
for Virginia and has been left pretty much
alone since then. .

On the peninsula is the Alligator River "

”Wildlife Refuge, more than 120,000 acres of

sparsely settled, inhospitable swampland

.that wraps around a Navy bombing range.

The‘land’s previous owner, the Prudential
Insurance Co., had elaborate plans to drain
the swamp and put up condominiums, but it
was unable to get the necessary permits.
The Nature Conservancy, a national
conservation group that buys wilderness
threatened with development, helped to
swing a deal that gave the wolves room to

romp and gave Prudential an $87 million
' tax deduction.

The refuge was chosen by the US.

Fish and Wildlife Service as the new home
: of the red wolf because of its thick cover
”f and abundant small game — and because

its geography greatly simplifies the job of
keeping the wolves out of populated areas.
The human population is clustered in four
small towns at the fringes of the refuge.
Fewer than 2,000 people live in the area,
and livestock is sparse.

The program is being closely watched by
conservationists who hope to put other ;
endangered species back into their former
ranges.

Trees are anomalies on the refuge.
Stunted stands of aquatic pond pines give
proper scale to the disorienting landscape ‘
of neck-high, leathery evergreen shrubs,
sunk in boggy, sulfur-belching peat. Every

‘few years, when the swamp burns, red

cedar trees sprout. Those volunteers are all 3'

IF THE WOLVES survive the

j of parasites that infest the swamp,
they’ll have a friendly enemy to

contend with -— the coyote.

Red wolves, at 40 to 80 pounds, are
smaller and shyer than gray wolves. .
They are named for their pelage, but

they are not foxy red; their color

ranges from somber reddish-brown
or tawny to nearly black tones.

The range of the red wolf once
extended from the Gulf Coast of
Texas north to eastern Oklahoma and
eastward across Arkansas and
northern Louisiana to western

. Mississippi. At its western edge, the

red wolves’ range touched that of the
coyote. Coyotes, clever and
adaptable, moved eastward to invade
the range of the red wolves as more
and more land was cleared.

By the mid-19603, most red
wolves were in Texas. The population
was estimated at up to 3,500 wolves in
Texas, 1,500 in Arkansas and a few
score scattered in Louisiana. Shot,
poisoned and elbowed out of most of
their range by development, the red
wolf teetered on the edge of
extinction through the early 19705. To
complicate matters, the wolves began
to breed with coyotes when suitable
lupine mates were, unavailable.

In 1975, when extinction appeared
imminent, Curtis Carley of the US.
Fish and Wildlife Service led a team
that captured the last remaining 40
red wolves in Louisiana and Texas.
SOme were sent to zoos, but most
went into a breeding program in
Tacoma, Wash, and some went to the
Wolf Sanctuary in St. Louis County. In
1980, the red wolf was declared
extinct in the wild.

Ewelves were born. The wolves in

But the red wolf’s identity is far
from clear. Confusion has existed for
the last 175 years over the taxonomic

status of the red wolf, called
" variously Lupus niger, Cam's lupus

ater, Canis rufus, Canis niger, and

' again, Canis rufus. It is still sharply
' debated whether the red wolfis a
; distinct species of the genus Canis ~—

which includes wolves, foxes, coyotes
and dogs -—- or is merely a race of the
gray wolf, related to it as Poiynesians

j. \are to Scandinavians.

In the simplest terms, the question

of whether two populations of .
f animals are members of separate
; species hinges on whether or not they
interbreed freely under natural
7 conditions, producing viable
'- offspring. But this classic definition of .
. .species is too narrow for canids,

which can and do interbreed.

from another. Although little is
known about red wolves’ behavior,
studies have found consistent differ-

; in skull, foot, nose and body size.

. America’s preeminent wolf
biologist, David L. Mech, suggests in
“The Wolf, The Ecology and Behav-
iOr of an Endangered Species,” pub-

lished in 1972, that the red wolf may i

be a fertile cross between wolves
and coyotes. ’

But Ron Nowak, a mammalogist
for the US. Office of Endangered
r Species, argues that the red wolf
i constitutes a distinct species.

i “The key expression here is
3% whether they will interbreed under

.31 fully natural, not human-modified

, conditions. They may have bred
_ when people killed off a large per-
. icentage of one population and
. changed the habitat to allow anoth-
. ear to move in. But that is not natu-
.‘ r al,” he said. ‘

‘ Curtis Carley, the wildlife biolo-

ggtist credited with doing more to
agave the red wolf than any other
1’ “person in the nation, is uncertain
~ about the red wolf’s status. But Car-
. ley suggests that the question is of
‘ only academic importance.

:“There really isn’t time to find

i out,” Carley said. “We don’t have 20
E_ryezirs to wait. The wolves have to be
» sav ed now.”

Three geographic races, or sub-
species, of the red wolf are recog-
nized: the Florida red wolf, Canis
rufus floridanus; the Mississippi Val-
ley red wolf, Canis rufus gregom;

_: and the Texas red wolf, Canis rufus
‘ rufus. The eight Alligator River

wolves are, as near as anyone can.

Nowak says the future of the

them tram co‘yotes as well as:

“Some people involved think that

Iation, rather than physical barriers; ;

have done it at all without guaran-
teeing the people who live here that
the wolves would be contained.”
Another pivotal concession was to
guarantee no curtailment of hunt-
ing, which is allowed in the refuge
from mid-October to the end of De-
cember. Although some biologists
are concerned that hunters might
kill some wolves — accidentally or
maliciously - they are prepared to
accept such losses. Anyone who kills
a wolf accidentally or in self-de-
fense on refuge property will not be
prosecuted. Anyone who intentional-
ly bags a wolf and gets caught is
subject to a $200,000 fine. ,
1’lt would have been impossible to
ban hunting, even for a year,” said
the refuge’s manager, John Taylor.
“We promised that there would be
no change in refuge practices to ac-
commodate the wolves, and we
could not go back on our promise.”
Eight red wolves — fourmales
and four females, including a fe-
male born and raised at the Wolf
Sanctuary in St. Louis County near'
Eureka -— have been released at the
refuge this autumn. Eight more ani-
mals raised in captivity will be

The wolves just released spent 10

Sawyer, wiping briny hands on her

‘ peach-colored jeans. “I think it will '

be a good thing to have the wolves

Others, such as Mike Payne, a
Stumpy Point fisherman, greet the
project with skepticism bordering
on hostility.

"I’m not in favor of anything -—
bumblebees, wolves, whatever ——

ject‘s wrector. ~ ~

.Mike Phillips, a Fish and Wildlife
biologist who supervises the ani-
mals’ care, explained: “The wolves
have to be able to make it on their
own, and they need to have the
proper reaction if they are noticed
first in a confrontation with a hu-
man. That reaction is to run.”

Caged in 50-by-50-foot chain-link
pens, the wolves’ view of humans

was blocked by plywood sheets lin-

‘ing the bottom of the fence. They

were fed dry dog food, then the car-
casses of animals killed on nearby
roads. Finally, they Were fed live
prey to prepare them for release.
Brackish water from the bogs was

- poured into troughs through funnels
attached outside the fence.

The caretakers rarely

glimpsed or heard their wary
charges. Every three weeks, they
entered the pens to check their

1 health. But the encounters were not

l'

friendly. Quite the contrary.

“If thewolves came up to us and .

local veterinarian and given a final
set of imaginations and vitamin
boosters. Then they were fitted with
collars that emit computer-con-
trolled radio signals, allowing biolo-
gists to track them and analyze their
movements. The collars also contain
tranquilizer darts, which could be
used to immobilize them if they
should try to leave the refuge.

The first pair of wolves left their
acclimation pen at the northern end
of the refuge on Sept. 13; six others
were released Oct. 4.

The moment of truth was, like
so many other aspects of the pro-
tect, qu1et and anticlimactic. Parker
Simply opened the door of the pen
andwalked away. .

.Like nervous parents, the biolo-
gists monitored the first pair’s
movements 24 hours a day for the

first l0 days of their freedom. Using
an airplane. an antenna-topped
.truck and two boats, Phillips, Lu-
' cash, Parker and others kept scrué '
y, pulous records of the wolves’ where-
abouts and activity levels. A series

of 12 one- and two-part blips are

._ .g .....4. "A _. un-
t...._ .-._.-.

giVen off by the collars every hour.
The blips form a code that indicates
how active the wolves have been
during a given time period. The de-
gree of accuracy of the telemetry
ranges from 10 degrees, triangulat-
ing from a boat, to 3 degrees or less
when the calculation is done from a
plane. A glimpse of the wolves from
the air is rare.

The sudden freedom apparently
was perplexing. After two days of
sticking close to the pens, the fe-
male in the first pair trotted north
— alone. After two more days, she
returned to the pen 'area and her
mate. _

Two pairs released together on
the. western side of the refuge met
and scuffled at some point, Phillips
said, but they have since spread out
and have begun marking their terri-
tories with Seat and scratches. Biolo-
gists do not know if the wolves will
form a pack or even if the pairs will
stay together.

“We really don’t know what to ex-
pect from them,” Parker said. “We
may find that releasing captive-
raised animals into the wild just isn’t
a good idea. It may be. It’s just too

.4

soon to know." .
What seems clear is that the red

.wolves’ survival in the wild means

long-term, and probably perpetual,
involvement by humans. .

“When people mess something up
to begin with, they usually have to
stay involved to reverse the situa-
tion,” said Ron Nowak, a mammalo-
gist for the US. Office of Endan-
gered Species.

Whatever the long-term prob-
lems, Phillips, Parker and Taylor
are optimistic —- at least in the short
term.

“It may take more than these
eight animals to make it work,”
Phillips said. “But I think they’ll
make it. For the program to really
be a success, these animals will
have to have puppies, and those will
have to have puppies. Whatever
happens, we will learn a tremen--
dous amount about how the red wolf

' lives.”

Taylor has a more modest meas-
ure of success.

“I think it can be called a success
it one pair survives,” Phillips said.
“In captivity, the animals have no
future at all.”

Chicago Tribune
MEMPHIS—David Hall leaned over the
podium, his ﬂat cop’s voice reciting the
‘ gruesome details.
’ So maybe we’d like to know how mil-
. lions of ducks and geese might have disap-

peared?

Hall would not just tell us, he would

show us.

The TV monitor ﬂickered as he inserted
a remarkable videotape made just in the
last year. '

The screen came alight with a boater

scooping sheets of corn onto a large
r southern bottomland marsh.

f Next we saw the geese, thousands
feeding upon the bait. Then came the
poachers, scuttling low behind the dike,
, resembling a line of soldiers about to
;, charge.

Shotguns and even riﬂes were ready. "

Then came a signal, and the ﬁring began.

Hall’s camera showed dozens of geese,

“dead and wounded, ﬂoating on the water.
Thousands more peeled upward, ﬁghting

The ﬁring continued, and dozens more
died. When the last goose was beyond
shooting range, the men and some boys
waded into the marsh and retrieved geese
by the amiload. The bed of a pickup truck
soon was overﬂowing. »

Hall’s voice out through the awestruck
room. “They had 246 geese,” he said.

“And cripples kept falling out of the sky
as far as you could see.”

That was in the morning, he said. They
got rid of the geese and shot another 250
in the aﬂemoon.

And that’s the way it has been, Hall
said, throughout the South for generations.

migrating waterfowl, poachers illegally bait
and kill countless ducks and geese from
the ﬁrst day these birds arrive in the fall to
the moment they leave for springtime
nesting in the North.

Seasons mean nothing. Laws and regula-
tions are jokes. The game is to outwit
wardens and to kill as many birds as pos-
sible. Limits occur when the poachers run
out of shells.

One fellow on the ﬁlm, who worked for
years as a guide, said his parties averaged
100 cases of shotgun shells a year—from a
single baited blind. -

“I probably shot six or seven cases
myself,” the man confessed.

Hall is. a senior enforcement agent for

:‘formed poachers in the audience

{came forward to add their own ex-'

11periences. . g

j “Poaching’s a way of life,” said
r;Pat Pitt, a Memphis chemist and
itaxidermist. “You grow up killing
3 as many birds as you can. You tell
s‘someone you’ve killed 50 or 60
:birds, and they ask if you’d had a
{bad day.

“You see so many birds that you
:just don’t think it’s wrong. You
,r Lcan’t conceive that the birds might
iihave limits. You absolutely believe
:that they’ll keep coming back, no

matter what. You think it’ll ’ never

f end. You laugh at regulations. You
i think they are silly when you see so

many birds.” -

Poachers just don’t believe that
what they are doing can be wrong,
added Andrew Quattlebaum of
Stuttgart, Ark. They don’t think of
excessively killing birds as immoral.

“Why, I used to take half a case
of shells and stay in there all day
and kill ’em,” Quattlebaum said.

Everyone they knew did it, they
said. Especially out-of-state hunters
who thought they would be unde-
tected. Well-tipped guides will indi-
cate if unlimited shooting is all
right.

“For those of you from the
North, these are your birds these
people are shooting,” Hall said.
“These are the birds that otherwise
would ﬂy back to nest and breed
some more.” '

Although Hall stressed that Loui-
siana judges now are getting tough-
er—l 3 poachers have received fed-
eral prison terms there this year, he
said—his ﬁlm quoted one irascible
Cajun poacher whose outlook was
extremely bleak. ' - .

“Jail won’t prevent it,” the man
declared. “They’ll just go out and
kill the ducks and leave ’em there,
just like the rich people do. If we
can’t eat ’em, why should rich peo-
ple get to shoot ’em?”

Hall said that illegal baiting and
poaching is far more widespread
than most people think

“I can go up in a plane and ﬁnd
a hundred baited Spots in a single
day,” he said. .

He told of seVeral corporate
“clubs” where guests are encouraged

revealed many comparable incidents as“
sar, pg. 6

i,

to shoot all the ducks they can, just

for the “entertainment.”

-Hall is convinced that the illegal '
kill of waterfowl may be larger than
the legal harvest in this country.

US. Fish and Wildlife Service of-
ﬁcials at the symposium added that
they have no measure of the illegal
harvest. “But we’re going to need a
measure if we’re going to adequate-
ly manage the problem,” said Rollin
Sparrowe, chief of the service’s
migratory, bird management in
Washington.

“I see a new day, I really do,”
Hall insisted. “I see more of these '
people beginning to realize that
what they have been doing might be
wrong, that the ducks aren’t coming
back like they always did and that
the poaching could be part of the
problem.

“While I believe that declining
nesting habitat in Canada and the ‘
northern United States is the main
problem with ducks by far, I do be-
lieve that poaching on these levels
has been a major contributor to our .
decline of ducks.

“Unfortunately, no one believed
us in the past. They thought it was

' just a small, localized problem, not

nearly as widespread as we now
know. They didn’t believe the war-
dens.

“Well, maybe now with ﬁlms like
these, they’ll start to come around.”

From the perspectives of Pitts
and Quattlebaum, however, change
is coming slowly.
- “Now that I’ve cleaned up my
act, my buddies won’t hunt with me
anymore,” Quattlebaum said.

Pitts silently nodded.

Exterminated inYEIIOWStone, the W0“? .
prompts howls over plans for its return

By James Coates ,
Chicago Tribune

, ammoth Hot Springs,
Wyo.—lt has probably
been 60 years since the
~. " moumful howl of the r
timber wolf has been
heard here in Yellowstone
National Park, a sanctuary where
. managers of the National Park
Service long have worked to
preserve everyone of God’s
creatures native to the Rockies—
except the wolf. :

, Managers long agoordered all
the wolves shot.

New as an autumn Moon like
the ones that once set ~
Yellowstone’s wolves wailing”
hangs over the park’s primordial
forests, backers of a plan to
reintroduce the wily and
voracrous predators say they are
closer to their controversial goal
than they have been in years.

Hardy-eyed hunters hired by the

‘ selfsame National Park Service

' that now has proposed importing
wolves to Yellowstone are
believed to have shot the last

.. wolf living here in 1927,

. explained John Varley,
Yellowstone’s chief wildlife
scientist. '

Those shootings were part of a
nationwide federal wolf slaughter
~ undertaken in the 19205 to halt
the killing by wolves of livestock
on the nation’s farms, Varley
explained. The national parks
were included in the eradication
to prevent wolves from using
them as a sanctuary, foraging
beyond the boundaries for
livestock on neighboring farms
and then returning to the ,
national preserve, where they
could not be hunted. The
program was carried out by the
_ U.S. Agriculture and Interior

Departments.

Today there are fewer than a
couple of thousand timber wolves
. left in the contiguous states,
including about 1,200 in.

. Minnesota, a few dozen in -
Wisconsin and Michigan and a
handful in Montana’s Glacrer
National Park and in central
Idaho, Varley said. There are
about 5,000 wolves in Alaska and
perhaps 50,000 in Canada.

So successful was the program
that today the Northern Rocky.
Mountain timber wolf, the .
original inhabitant of
Yellowstone, is consrdered
extinct.

In the early 19705, however, a
growing environmental
movement, coupled With a new

fiihilosophy in Yellowstone that
the park should be returned. to its
natural state before the ﬁrst
cowboy intruded, led the federal
government to place the Rocky

ayountain wolf’s Midwestern cous-
.;_in, the gray timber wolf, on the list
;~ pf endangered species and begin
i'ﬁﬁe quest to increase the wolf
fpppulation in the contiguous states”.
{.3 To date, however, not a single
-‘;v{:olf has been reintroduced under
' the federal plan. Only last year did
9.. the studies and data generated by
3 *the 1973 order result in a plan—-
and subsequently a controversy,
once it was made public—about
how that reintroduction should be
accomplished. Yellowstone was se-
lected as the first site to import the
gray wolf, a large canine weighing
120 pounds or more as an adult

finely truck in shipments of wolves

, to the park this winter.

Meanwhile, mainstream environ-

; mental groups, including the Fund

 

v
“t

for Animals and Defenders of
Wildlife, have spent tens of thou—

? Sands of dollars lobbying for the re-

covery plan. _
Defenders of Wildlife ofﬁcrals

. have gone asfar in their public re-
lations push as to pay ranchers in
‘7 Montana more than $3,000 after

‘ the ranchers claimed to have lost
livestock to the handful of wolves
living in Glacier National Park.

' The group promised that it would

also pay for any animals killed by

wolves once they are reintroduced
7 into Yellowstone. .

The Defenders also spent

4 $0,000 to take a group of

Myoming, Montana and Idaho

and capable of eating 20 pounds of
meat at a sitting.

“There definitely is an ecological
niche that throughout time was

2: ranchers to Minnesota, where they
there shown evidence that wolves
Esthere had killed only about two

:d‘pzen cows, and sheep last year on _

éIhe more than 12,000 farms within

filled by wolves that has been va-
cant here in Yellowstone for about
60 years,” Varley noted. The elimi-
nation of the wolf, which preyed .
on large ungulates—moose, elk and
bison—has led to overpopulation
of those animals, whose grazing in
turn has spoiled habitats for small-
er animals such as the beaver, now
rarely found in the park.

But as far as many Westerners,
including the three powerful Re—
publican lawmakers representing
Wyoming in Congress, are con-
cerned, 60 years without wolves
hasn’t been long enough.

. Because of. the political 'strength
of wolf opponents, advocates of the
wolf’s reintroduction have suffered
repeated reversals since their drive
started in 1980.

_ The issue has divided top oﬂi-

‘ cials in the Reagan administration,

. angered ranchers in Wyoming,
Montana and Utah and created
concem among professional hunt-
ing guides, called outfitters, who
worry that wolves will cause a

. drastic drop in the supplies of elk,
deer, antelope and other game.

A University of Wyoming study
published in August about the
views of ranchers who oppose wol-
ves said that to many people the
wolf “is the Devil, red-tongued, sul-

, fiat-breathed and yellow-eyed; he
was: :he werewolf, human cannibal;
he was the lust, greed and violence
i that men saw in themselves.”
-‘ And the fomentation has been

2 equally intense in the pro-wolf
" camp. Earlier this month members =
of the violence-prone environment- 1
al group Earth First! issued a state- i
_ _ment that theyplanned to clandesg-M“

izhe wolves’ hunting grounds.

i ’ -

L;..;I_argely unmoved, the Wyoming

l J
. n, i _ -

Stock Growers Association voiced
strong objections to the plan, and
Wyoming Senators Alan Simpson
and Malcolm Wallop and ,
Wyoming’s only congressman,
Rep. Richard Cheney, joined forces
over the summer on behalf of
ranchers and outfitters and per-.
suaded the Interior Department’s
Fish and Wildlife Service director,
Frank Dunkel, to order the recov-
ery project scrapped.

Dunkel’s order, issued after a

meeting with the three lawmakers,
1. led to a confrontation between him

 

; and the popular director. of the Na-
' tional Park Service, William Penn

Mott, who strongly endorses the re-
covery plan, said George Berklacy,
spokesman for the National Park

. Service in Washington.

The bureaucracy requires that

Dunkel’s Fish and Wildlife Service

reintroduce the animals into Mott’s
park, so the conflict “means that
the hopes for a recovery program
are on hold,” Berklacy' said.

Mott, a friend of President

Reagan’s who ran Califomia’s state

parks when Reagan was governor,

f rejected Dunkel’s order to stop
calling for the plan but can’t over-

ride his colleague and implement it
on his own, Berldacy said.
“There is just no way that you

._.-v

can claim to be director of the Na-

tional Park "Service and not be in
favor of restoring one of the key
species that lived in a park before

. it was designated a park,” Berklacy l
saidalisppted that behind the _

U
V

. ne‘W—fouridop’tir'iiis‘mmof wolf advo- '
g cates is a congressional decision to
ﬁnally take the emotional issue be-
fore a committee.

Rep. Wayne Owens (D., Utah)

”3 introduced a bill in early October
that would order Dunkel or his
successor to attempt a three-year
experiment in which 10 packs of

‘ wolves, consisting of 18 to 30 wol-
ves each, would be introduced into
3,000—square-mile Yellowstone.

‘ Wildlife biologists at Yellow-
stone, including V arley, estimated
that these wolves each year would
kill about 3,000 of the park’s enor-
mous herd of 30,000 elk, thereby
helping to restore the herd’s natu-
ral population and prevent the
overgrazing that has driven out

‘ smaller animals.

But the poll results, compiled by
r Alistair J. Bath, a professor in the
1 College of Commerce andlndustry :
the Univerity of Wyoming,.es-
taslwhed that those in Wyoming

who don’t want wolves largely take ‘
the view that the only good wolf is
a dead wolf.
Wyoming wolf opponents largely -

refused to drop their opposition

_ even if all wolves were kept in the

. park or if the federal govemment

. were to pay for any livestock killed

5 by the predators outside the park.

Said park biologist Varley, “The

"i But'oppOnents such as SimpSon W
icounter that the wolves would srm-

 

{ply remove animals that now are
killed by hunters each winter when
the elk migrate into forests of
Wyoming, Montana and Idaho.

After Owens offered his pro-wolf
bill, Simpson, Wallop and Cheney
told reporters that they would con-
tinue to oppose the measure. Said
Cheney, “I intend to work strongly
against it.”

But public hearings required by
the bill’s introduction mean that
the issue will get a hearing beyond
the three well-connected Wyoming
Republicans, who have succeeded
in stalling the plan until now, said

a key wolf advocate, Hank Fischer ‘

of the Montana chapter of the De-
fenders of Wildlife. *

“We believe that Americans as a
whole, including even a majority of
the residents of the state of
Wyoming, support the idea of rein-
troducing wolves and that majority
is being thwarted by three con- ‘
gressmen responding to the special
interests of a few of their consti-
tuents,” Fischer said.

In 1985, he recalled, the Univer—
sity of Minnesota staged an exhibit
in Yellowstone featuring Minneso—
ta’s wolf population and explaining
how farmers and ranchers there
coped with having predators near
their livestock.

, A poll conducted by University
of Montana researchers of visitors
to the Minnesota exhibit found
that 85 percent of tourists favored
reintroducing wolves." , ’ ‘ '

. By contrast, a poll taken last
summer by the University of
Wyoming and paid for by the Na-
tional Park Service found that sen-
timent against the wolves ran at 17
to 1 in the Wyoming counties that
border the park. ’

The poll found that people living
in counties far away from the park
support wolves. The poll of
Wyoming residents overall found ‘
48.5 percent in favor of wolves,
34.5 percent against and 17 per-

_ cent with no opinion.

people opposed to wolves are very,
very strongly opposed. There is
something about the animal that
simply brings out hatred, anger and
fear in many people.”

Despite the poll results, Defend-
ers of Wildlife leaders think they
can change at least some minds by
promising to pay for any livestock
killed by wolves once the 10 packs
are restored to Yellowstone.

“We’re putting our money where

' our mouths are, but the fact is that

we are right, and therefore we
aren’t taking that much of a risk,” 7
said the Defenders’ Fischer.

A study by William J. Paul of

the US. Department of Agriculture
in Minnesota found that the 1,200

wolves in that state had hunted
over ground covered by 12,230
farms and yet had been linked to
the deaths of only 7 cows, 10 cal-
ves, 13 sheep, 285 turkeys, 1 goat
and 1 dog.

“There is only a fraction of the
numbers of livestock around
Yellowstone as there is in the Min-
nesota wolf ranges, and we’re only
talking about a couple of hundred
wolves here instead of 1,200 like in
Minnesota,” Fischer said.

“We definitely can afford to pay
for the small numbers of animals
likely to be taken by a reintroduced
Yellowstone [wolf] population.

“It would be a tiny price for the
privilege of living around a magnif—
icent animal.” .

colored and red Abyssinian survives in the wild
as well as he does in comfortable domesticity.
Neither wars nor careless breeders have been
able to destroy him. However affectionate, the
Abyssinian is fundamentally feral. This is the

peramentally and physically with all elements of
the cat in proportion.” These complex standards
have been set on purpose. A trend in pedigree
breeding has resulted in extreme types, especial—
ly in the Siamese, which is often bred to be very

 

source of his great allure.

Forty years ago there were only about ﬁfty domesticated AbYS'
sinians in the world. Even before the Second World War they
were rare, with ninety—two registered in Great Britain, where
they had been most common. The war devastated the breed. Cat—
tery owners, no longer able to buy them food, put many animals to
sleep or shipped them to countries where survival seemed likelier.
Today, 12,000 are registered in the Cat Fanciers’ Association.
Though as a pet the Siamese is still the country’s most popular
pedigreed shorthair, the Abyssinian has just edged out the Sia—
mese as the country’s most popular show cat.

An alley cat produces an average of 4.4 kittens per litter. A
Siamese produces 4.1. An Abyssinian has only 3.1. Still, after
the breed’s virtual disappearance it took only ten generations for
the line to reestablish itself. One of its most prominent saviors is
the eight’year—old Phoenix, whose name could not be more apt.
A large red grand champion of champions, he has sired no fewer
than ﬁfteen grand champions. His sons and daughters, grandsons
and granddaughters consistently garner awards in the hundreds of
annual cat shows. Phoenix’s own sire, Soketumi Samadari, also
continues to procreate, on a faraway island in northern Japan,
where he was taken in 1981 after a Japanese breeder picked him
up for $10,000——probably the highest price ever paid for a cat.

The Abyssinian Cat Club of America, with such active mem'
bers as Phoenix’s owners, Ralph and Hilary Helmrich, maintains
exacting standards for the breed’s appearance and temperament.
For a kitten of quality, go straight to a breeder. Pet stores may not
only misrepresent their cats but also sell them far too young. The
Helmrichs, who own the Abydos Cattery, will not sell to anyone
they have not met. They want to be sure that each of their kit
tens, whether it is being bought for show, for breeding, or as a pet,
is in good hands.

These are the general requirements for an Abyssinian, as pre—
sented in The Cat Fanciers’ Association’s Yearbook: “The overall
impression of the ideal Abyssinian would be a colorful cat with a
distinctly ticked coat, medium in size and regal in appearance.
The Abyssinian is lithe, hard and muscular, showing eager activ’

ity and a lively interest in all surroundings. Well—balanced temr

thin, with an especially elongated nose, to look
more “Oriental.” Abyssinianvlovers won’t tolerate any transforv
mation in their glamorous wild cat. They ﬁnd their strange ani—
mal from by the Bay of Bengal the most satisfying creature on
Earth.

With the stance of a royal Egyptian cat and the alert face and
burnished color of a mountain lion, the Abyssinian captures the
hearts and imaginations of many who otherwise dislike cats.
Claimed by their owners to be smarter than other cats and most
dogs, Abyssinians remain wild, capricious, and provocative all
their lives. They dig into garbage like goats, contrive games for
themselves like children, play with water, greet their masters,
and fetch like devoted dogs. Then, after long spells of creating
chaos, they will curl up, docile as lambs, and expect hours of
petting. Their idiosyncrasies guarantee that Abyssinians do not
suit everyone. One is either born an Abyssinian person or not. It
is not something one grows into.

We ﬁnd an early mention of an Abyssinian in a book by Gorv
don Stables published in 1874 (six years after the British troops
left Abyssinia), along with a colored lithograph. “Zula, ” the text
reads, “the property of Mrs. Captain BarrettvLennard. The cat
was brought from Abyssinia at the conclusion of the war, fed on
the way home on raw beef and was very wild. She is now very fond
of her mistress, but has a great many eccentricities which other
cats have not, and is altogether a wonderful specimen of care
kind.” It would be nice to know more about those eccentricities.
Did Zula, like her counterparts today, pick up food with her paw
rather than bring her head down to her bowl? Would she eat
everything, from cantaloupes and raisins to corn on the cob? Did
she race to escape out of every open door?

Abyssinians were shown in the ﬁrst great cat show, at London’s
Crystal Palace in 1871, and one of them placed third out of 180
cats. Harrison Weir, the show’s initiator, described the Abyssin'
ian as “pretty and interesting.” His criteria for excellence of breed
were far more extensive than those that are accepted today. The
cat was to have no markings except for a black band along the
back of a mostly brown coat ticked with black; the fur on the inner
sides of the legs and belly was to be more of a rufou5rorange tint

than the body. The eyes, Weir felt, should be
deep yellow, with a tint of green, the nose dark
red and blackvedged. He liked the ears rather

small and dark brown, with black edges and tips,
and the pads of the feet black. He thought that

the ruddy’and'red faction, which pleaded with
them to call their animals something other than
Abyssinian.

That was but one of the more recent skirr
mishes in the Abyssinian wars. Another hotly

 

the contention that the animal really might be a
cross between a cat and a rabbit was highly improbable.

In fact, the belief that the Abyssinian was kin to the British
“Bunny” cats, which were also ticked, almost did the breed in.
Abyssinians came to be confused with other foreign cats imported
into Great Britain in the last years of the nineteenth century, and
many half~breeds of no distinction resulted. Still, by 1896 only
two Abyssinians were listed in the British Stud Book. These were
Sedgemere Bottle, born in 1892, and Sedgemere Peaty, born in
1894 and memorialized twenty—six years after her death by her
stillvgrieving owner, H. C. Brooke. “I regret not having preserved
her skin, ” he wrote, “to at least retain her glorious colour, though
her beautiful sinuous form and delicate limbs can hardly be imag—
ined by those who have not seen her." Sedgemere Peaty was
unusual in many ways. Most Abyssinians have powerful maternal
instincts—they often kidnap other cats’ kittens—but this one’s
were extraordinary. Although members of the cat and weasel
tribes usually detest one another on sight, Sedgemere Peaty raised
a young ferret—stoat hybrid, and the two remained friendly even
after the ferret was full’grown. The strange pair were admired at
the Royal Botanic Gardens Show by Princess, later Queen, Alex-
andra and lived on good terms with Brooke’s other pets, which
included a white sherwolf.

Though the criteria for most breeds have changed markedly
since the nineteenth century, the standards for the Abyssinian
are still substantially those Weir knew—no thanks to those late
Victorian crossbreeders, who found it amusing to develop what
they called a silver Abyssinian. Even Weir was seduced by the
hybrid. “The Abyssinian Silver Gray or Chinchilla,” he wrote,
“is the same as the plain Abyssinian in all points, with the excep«
tion of the ground being silver instead of brown. This is a new and
beautiful variety. ” Today’s most respected American breeders——
such people as Joan Wastlhuber, Tord and Suzanne Svenson, and
the Helmrichs—shudder at such heresy. Within the genetic code
the white or silver gene supplants the rufous gene characteristic of
the true Abyssinian. Nevertheless, three years ago, breeders of
“Blue Abyssinians” were able to pressure the Cat Fanciers’ ASSO'.‘

ciation into accepting their cars into competition, overcoming‘

134

debated issue is unlikely ever to be resolved.
Most British aficionados contend that the breed originated in
England. As Rosemonde S. Peltz writes in The Abyssinian Cat
(1972), “With careful selection and meticulous breeding the
British hand tailored the group of cats that they called Abyssinv
ians. They began with British Shorthairs, in most instances of
unknown parentage, and gradually broke up tabby striping and
eliminated white spotting and bars until they produced a cat with
a uniform ticked coat.” Most Americans thought this theory
improbable, given the very unwild look and nature of the British
shorthair. Eventually, after several years’ research, two Ameriv
cans put forward a competing case. The breeder Tord Svenson
began his search for the Abyssinian’s origins many years ago. One
day he read that an international cat judge had come across a
stuffed cat very similar in appearance to the Abyssinian. He folv
lowed the lead to the director of the Leiden Zoological Museum,
in Holland, and learned that the cat had been purchased in 1836
from a supplier who had simply noted, “Felis, a small species
unknown to me in between Felis bengalensis and minuta.” The
museum’s founder, C. J. Temminck, a noted taxonomist, went
further and labeled the cat, “Patrie. domestica India.” India is
exactly where modern feline geneticists would expect the AbySv
sinian to have originated. According to Neil Todd, a geneticist at
Boston University, they are frequent along the shore of the Bay of
Bengal and in parts of Southeast Asia, and he has often sighted
them on his travels to trace feline migrations.

Cinéastes have been told another story about the roots of the
Abyssinian. In 1977, Walt Disney hired an Abyssinian named
Rumple to play Jake, the starring role in the film The Cat from
Outer Space. In the story, Jake crash—lands his spaceship on Earth
and has only thirtyvsix hours to repair and lift off or to be stuck
there forever. During those thirty'six hours, he manages to coma
municate with a physicist through thought transference (to any
owner of an Abyssinian, this part was completely lifelike) in the
hope of ﬁxing his aircraft. But lo and behold, in the meantime,
Jake falls in love with a white Persian named Lucy Belle and is
thus willing to settle for a life on Earth. Since Abyssinian’owners
have been known to call Persians “furniture that purrs,” Jake’s

defection has struck more than one of them as
wildly unlikely, but then Abyssinians do usually
manage to teach any other cat new tricks. Not
long ago, two days after the Helmrichs returned a
friend’s Persian that they had boarded for two

a young couple distraught by a parent’s rapid
decline into senility. The old woman just sat in
her rocking chair on her porch in Maine, waiting
for death. She had hardly spoken or moved for
years. In a last—ditch attempt to give her some

 

weeks, they received a frightened phone call.
The friend was shocked to ﬁnd that suddenly her Persian was
active. She wanted to know what had happened. What had hap—
pened was that the Persian had been living with Abyssinians.
She had learned to play.

Abyssinians change human lives, too. The Helmrichs like to
recall one kitten they sold to the parents of a child sick with ler
kemia. The cat not only amused the boy when he was at home; it
remained with him through chemotherapy, hospital stays, and
long sieges of pain—frisky when appropriate, steady and affeo
tionate when times were hardest. They also remember the case of

happiness, the couple got her a mature Abyssin’
ian for company. Two months later, she was getting up at 3:00
AM. to ﬁx snacks for the cat and spent her days busily devising
games for her intelligent companion. Every Abyssinianvowner
has his own reason for throwing common sense to the winds and
choosing a life with such a demanding animal, but on one point,
they all agree: an Abyssinian confers nobility on his master or
mistress. The wilderness is still aﬁre in his soul. [I]

WILL AN ABY CHANGE YOUR LIFE?

If you are tempted to acquire an Abyssinian, be forewarned that the creature will change
your life. Below, a longtime Abyrowner makes a modest attempt to count the ways.

1. You will never again sleep past 4:00 AM. Like the wolf, an Aby feels that
predawn is the hour to hunt (but then he also hunts on and off all day). The
problem is that he needs you to help him ﬁnd his prey. At ﬁrst he may just stand
over your head and stare at you, but soon he’ll develop a heavy purr. Only the
extremely naive will suppose that the pun expresses devotion. If you have not
responded within a reasonable time, he may begin to nibble at your nose or toes.
Occasionally he’ll burrow into your hair and try to get some of it between his teeth.
Within thirty minutes you will be in the kitchen, can opener poised.

2. You’ll never eat alone. Even if you are eating food the cat doesn’t like (in my
experience, only grapefruit), he will develop a taste for it. He will steal anything in
the pot or on the plate—from croissant to steak or corn on the cob—and drag it to
whatever place he considers his lair. You will never be able to sit through a meal
when an Aby is nearby. Fortunately, they don’t mind being removed to another
room. Unfortunately, this action never inspires reform.

3. You will have to sneak in and out of your home like a criminal. This is to prevent
your Aby from running away. When I open my front door to greet visitors, I clutch
my Aby in my arms. No doubt my visitors now talk behind my back about my
neurotic attachment. It’s actually selfvdefense. To my shame, my Aby has been
known to flee into strangers’ apartments and hide under their beds. He has rushed
into the elevator and descended alone to the lobby. On one horrible night, with"
out my knowing it, he slid through a partially opened window to the ﬁre escape,

136

where he sat overnight one flight above his real home. I hope he missed me.

4. You will dress in tatters. The Aby is a wonderful climber and jumper. If he can
get into a closet, he will go straight to the top. And he may stay there so long that
you forget where he went—until late at night, when assorted things start hurtling
to the ﬂoor as he tumbles down to join you in bed. With an Aby in the house,
moths will never again be a problem. He can perforate a silk shirt or wool jacket in
a single assault. Most Abyssinian—breeders frown on declawing.

5. You will have to put up with his tantrums. An Aby is moody. He actually gets
grumpy. When he does—and you never know why—he will do anything and
everything to annoy: for instance, eat your plants, walk across the piano keys as
you practice, rewind your VCR with his paw, stand on your book while you read,
climb into a cabinet and wend his way through the crystal, cozy up to the phone
when you are doing ofﬁcial business and purr. If you block them one way, they will
ﬁnd another way to drive you mad. They are very, very smart cats.

6. You will have to throw out overnight visitors—for their own protection. Abys are
very sociable and will usually seduce even the most hardened cat hater. They love
to be petted and will often end up in a stranger’s lap in a very undigniﬁed swoon.
But overnight visitors quickly outlast their welcome. An Aby’s hostility may be
manifested by his scratching the offender’s suitcases, sitting on the offender’s
clothes and shedding, or, in desperate cases, using the guest bed as a litter tray.

7. You will beneﬁt a thousandfold. With an Aby, you will never lack for affection.
And since the Aby remains as wild as a kitten for life, you may also ﬁnd yourself
holding on to your youth—just to keep up with him. —V. G.

out trapping seasons and limits. In essence
this means the state —— and the homeowner
in the valley —- relies on a robust fur
market to keep the beaver population from
squeezing out the human population. The
numbers, according to wildlife experts,
now'stand at around 60.000 beaver New
Englandwide. This is the highest since the
resurgence began and is increasing.

Boycotts of natural furs may be working
too well, speaking in a strictly pragmatic
way, coming back to haunt some of the
former city folk who conscientiously tend
garden and orchard in Granby, Connecti-
cut, or Tamworth, New Hampshire. The
fact that long-haired fur is the mode today
exacerbates the situation, as beaver fur is
short-haired.

Aside from humans and their traps, it
takes something like a wolf. mountain
lion, bobcat, or coyote to make inroads
into the beaver population. Unfortunately,
these predators who help maintain the
natural balance shun civilization, may not
be welcome at that, and in any case, could
only catch beaver in signiﬁcant numbers
once a year, during spring dispersal. That‘s
the time when anywhere from one to six
two-year-olds are kicked out of the lodge
and seek a new home.

Where it suits them — not necessarily
where the conservation ofﬁcer or property
owner would like — they’ll establish new
homes. A pioneering beaver may live for a
few months in a tunnel in a stream bank
while working on the dam or building a
new lodge — essentially a dome of sticks
over a mud platform just above water
level, located at one of the deepest parts of
the pond.

In dam building. several colonies have
been known to cooperate. For weeks a
crew of beaver may tirelessly place brush
in a stream, butt-end downstream, work
more brush and sticks in crosswise, and
weight things down with stones and water-
logged logs. Double handfuls of mud are
packed on. The project is a show in stam-

Btu) RAP P01:

WHEN 686 PEOPLE IN PITTSFIELD, MASS-
achusetts. came down with giardiasis
—- an intestinal parasite that produces
severe diarrhea — in December 1985,
authorities immediately suspected bea-
ver of contributing to the epidemic. An
old reservoir known to be inhabited by
beaver had recently been tapped while
work went on with a new filtration
system for the city water supply.

While a boil order was issued, the
city switched back to its other reser-
voirs and ﬂushed the hydrants. The
epidemic subsided. Meanwhile, nine
beaver were trapped by the state de-
partment of health and tested.

Dr. Tom Eng, the public-health vet-
erinarian for the department who co-
ordinated the study, described the ﬁnd-
ings to date:

”Only one of the nine [beaver] tested
positive for giardia,” he said. “In the
implicated reservoir, we found a lot of
cy5ts -- 80 per 100 gallons of water. In
past outbreaks, there‘s been a lot of
speculation that beaver were responsi-
ble. But there‘s no good evidence up to
this point that that’s the case. We know
beaver can shed was, but it appears
only a few can be shed at a time.

“Our next step is to compare how
similar isolates (cysts) are between
those found in humans, in water, and in
beaver. Even if we know they are the
same, it will be difﬁcult to pinpoint the

course of the infection.”
Dr. Jesse Ortiz, a professor in the
University of Massachusetts Depart-
ment of Public Health who is consid—
ered the state’s top expert on the dis-
ease, puts it this way: “There are other
animals that could contaminate water,
including humans and muskrats. The
poor beaver are getting all the ﬂak.”
Though beaver “were present and
implicated” in giardiasis outbreaks in
other states, Ortiz said, “there’s the
possibility they were victims of the
same epidemic.” Mt“ rm .

fates, ranging from having the colony’s
dam broken to being shot by a property
owner with a permit from the state (in
Vermont no permit is required), being
killed by a fish and game agent, or being
discussed to death by an afﬂicted but
tenderhearted property owner. Conserva-
tion ofﬁcers report that among those the
beaver hath dammed, a great many are
satisﬁed by free advice. This often comes
around to heavy grates or “beaver pipes”
— a way of extending culvert pipe into a
beaver pond to limit water level. Only a
small and decreasing number are live-
trapped and relocated.

The latter course, being consistent with
the doctrine that a problem moved out of
the jurisdiction is a problem solved, has
great popular appeal. Wardens have to
explain that the act of relocation is not so
easy. Beaver are smart, so lots of colonies
successfully evade attempts to live-trap
and move them. Relocated animals often
have to vie for new territory, yet most good
beaver habitat is already claimed. Plus a
beaver understandably prefers to utilize
his own work investment — in other
words. to stay home.

“Once I caught a beaver in Brookﬁeld,
out ofa particularly tough colony,” recalls
Chris Thurlow, manager of the Worcester

. County district of the Massachusetts Divi-

sion of Fisheries and Wildlife. “It was a
hot August day, the ﬂies were buzzing. I
got him out of the water and started half
carrying, half dragging the trap with him
in it up to the truck, maybe a quarter of a
mile away. He was a big fellow. The wire
mesh on the trap must have deteriorated
and he was starting to push his way out.
“Just as I reached the truck, he got out
and headed back down the path. I ran
through the bushes and managed to get
ahead of him and we met on the path. It
was a Mexican standoff. Then,” Thurlow
recalled, “he grinned at me. I told him,
‘Sure fella,’ and kind of let him on by with
a bow and a wave. They’re pretty quick,”

he mused. "And determined.”

So the final category for problem beaver
is cases that are referred to trapper".

Harry Thompson of Tamworth is one of
the more aetive beaver trappers 31 New
Hampshire. Now in his seventies. he came
to the state in 1950. "I drove a Jeep With
Massachusetts plates.” he recalls. "The
locals looked down on me. I was a: out—of-
srater plus an Indian.

"Back then trappers were quitting be-
cause prices were low. I was the cnly one
willing to trap beaver. You know. beaver
trapping is not for the t‘ainthearted. You‘ve
got the elements to contend wiz'n. and
you’ve g0t to get where the beaver are. At
that time I had to pull a sled en foot,
loaded with trapping equipment. Now I go
in on snowshoes to pick a trail, then come
afterward with the snow machine.

"Many out-oﬁtowners have moved up
here. They like to live near water, they like
seeing beaver. You need a landowners per-
mit to trap. Some owners let us trap every-
thing but beaver, some want every beaver
out. They're killing merchantable timber
or plugging culverts. The whole Ioad of
management is put now on the trapper.
Toe following summer. if the landowner
complains. the conservation oiﬁeer tells
the trapper he muSt get them out. We r: to
persuade them,” Thompson said. “to Wait
until fall when the peit primes u; and is
worth something."

Pelts have brought between $12 and $40
in recent years. Most of the fur goes to
Europe. Which long ago trapped out most
of its species of beaver. Castor bar. but
which retains a taste for beaver coats. The
ca5tor gland is also sold to perfume com-
panies. (At one time this substance was
prescribed for insomnia. impotence. and
headaches. It includes salicylic acid. the
active ingredient of aspirin.)

Today, trapping is done with either a leg-
hold trap or a collapsing~cage (Ccnibear)
trap. To assure quick death, most states

require the leg-hold trap to be fastened to a
drowning wire, stretched between a fixed
object on the hank and another in the
water. When the trap springs. the heavcr or
otter heads instinctively for the water. A
one-\ my clip assures that the animal can't
return to land and drowns -- a merciful
arrangement when contrasted with the
maimings and prolonged d ‘aths of former
trapping systems. The expensive Conibear
trap kills the creature instantly.

With the old systems, a beaver would
often be still alive when the trapper re-
turned to check. Most used a club to
administer the coup de grace. The beaver’s
response during his last moments is unchar-
acteristic of other furbearers and disquiet-
ingly human. “He raises himself and with
upraised hand tries to ward off the death
blow,” says Enos Mills in his book, In
Beaver l4 i)rld(Houghton-Milllin, I9 I 3).

Trapper Thompson agrees about beaver
intelligence. “l have acquaintances,” he
says, “who have given up trying to trap the
last one or two out of a colony. Beaver
learn very quickly what a trap looks like.
When they had a trap, they take mud and
sticks and bury it. The trapper has got to
have a few tricks up his sleeve. 'l‘rapping."

place in legend and his persistence despite
genocidal trapping strategies and system-
atic takeover of his habitat. It explains our
identilication with him and, taking a psy-
chological leap of faith. also our rivalry.

“'l‘he h 'aver is practical, p ‘acel‘ul, and
imlustrious." wrote-Mills. “lle builds a
permanent home and keeps it cl ‘an and in
repair. llesidc it he stores his food supply
for the long winter. He takes thought for
the morrow. These and other commend-
ahle characteristics give him a place of
honor among the hordes of homeless
hand-to-mouth folk of the wild. During
winter he has little to do but bathe and eat
his three meals a day from the food he has
stored in the autumn. Toward spring,
when his neighbors are lean, hungry, and
cold, he is fat and comfortable.”

Call this pipe-and-slippers portrait ide-
alized and anthropomorphized, but it has
much truth in it. We in northern climates,
whose obsession with preparing for winter
spills over into obsession With so many
things, like to justify ourselves and do so
with what’s handy. The example of an-
other animal that logs, dams. digs. builds.
and puts up food for lean times is useful
and good.

Almost too good. lnevitahly, the idea
admits itself that the heater may llultl

on in imagination. anyway. and it's easier
to say ”Sorry, llustei, I stay, you go” to a
sn 'aky rat or a hristly porcupine than to
an animal with a set ofcrmlentials.

We see his Western traits of manipula-
tion and goal-directedness, somehow
missing the balancing. Eastern side of his
character. For in reality. beaver only work
when necessary. All summer they paddle
around freshening up territory markers
and checking the dam. The heavy labor
comes during the fall with winter prepara-
tions and in spring when moves are made,
repairs undertaken, and the kits trained.

cian with a series of beaver experiments

BEAVER
COMEBACK

(continued)

on a date,” she recalls, “and at a certain
point I’d say, ‘Well, I’ve got to go to work
now.’ It was a great job, the excitement of
spying, ﬁnding out what they were up to.
I’d say, ‘Hey, N-23 is over here? She’s never
been over here before!’ ”

Boardman reported that beaver vocal-
ize quite a bit. “You hear high-pitched.
whimpering sounds inside a lodge just
before they come out,” she said. Much of
her observation centered around beaver
play. “The young face each other in the
water, lock shoulders, and push. They go
around in a circle. They do that for a long
time. We decided it helps their muscles in
the head and neck area.”

Anyone with a color television set
knows a beaver’s incisors are orange: the
fact that those teeth are constantly growing
is less known. Beaver with a faulty bite
have been found dead from a particularly
gruesome kind of starvation: their mouths
propped open or sealed shut by teeth of an
uncanny length -— sometimes they actual-
ly curve around and pierce the lower jaw.

It takes the average beaver an hour to
gnaw down a four-inch sapling; stumps as
big as 42" inches diameter have been found
after beaver felled the tree. They don't
generally eat wood per se, but only the
cambium —— the dark-colored layer be-
neath the bark — plus the tenderer tips of
branches. The beaver stomach digests cel-
lulose with the aid of certain bacteria it
hosts in symbiosis. This organ might not
know what to do with a bite of ﬁsh;
biologists say beaver are complete vegetar-
ians. They make a food pile of branches
underwater beside the lodge. Summers
they eat mostly herbaceous matter.

They spend half their lives underwater.
Their ears and noses have valves that close
when submerged, and a membrane is
drawn across the eyes. On land they are
considered myopic: a friend of mine had a
beaver actually stumble over him, partly
because the beaver was keeping an eye on a
dog. The famous tail, contrary to myth,

isn’t used as a putty knife for mudding the
dam, nor is it left to hang in the water to
detect changes in the depth; it is a multi-
ple—use tool that serves as a diving plane,

warning-signal slapper, fat storage place, _

temperature regulator, and “kickstand” to
give its owner a prop when chewing down
a tree. .

Ecologically the beaver seems to be one
of nature’s solutions to the problem of
creating fresh habitat in the instance where
forest ﬁres or glaciers have been neglectful,
a clever redundancy. The beaver meta-
phorically eats stream valleys and —— once
his ponds ﬁll with sediment — excretes
meadows. Scientists increasingly accept
R. L. Ives’s hypothesis, ﬁrst published in
1942, that the beaver made some of the
prairies, wetlands, and meadows of the
North American continent.

Dr. Robert Naiman, who is carrying on
Ives’s line of inquiry while working for
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute on a
beaver study project in Quebec, says the
beaver introduces nitrogen into the pond
through his nitrogen-rich foods -— alder,
willow, aspen, and birch. The nutrients
enrich the water in the pond and in the
watercourse below. This attracts more ver-
tebrates and invertebrates. The “soup” is
then heated by the sun through the open-
ings the beaver created in the tree canopy,
and new communities of soil bacteria
form. With the regulating of ﬂoods and
droughts by the dams and the new adja-
cent habitats (“edges”) inviting their own
unique species, the beaver, wherever he
goes, creates a bull market in the commod-
ity of life. This ought to compensate for a
good deal of the nuisance factor.

The beaver comeback, even now that it’s
peaking, has produced nothing compara-
ble with the creature’s former glory, when
beaver ponds numbered as many as 300 to
the mile, when over 100 million of the
peaceful animals inhabited North Amer-
ica. But it appears that game and wetlands

A Nose for Deer

S THE FERRY EASED
into the dock at Pru-
dence island and
lowered its loading ramp, a
man approached it carrying
a large suitcase. At the en-
trance to the loaiing area a
man in a greet: State of
Rhode Island uniform was
holding the leasi: of an alert
year-old Germa: shepherd.
The two seemed :3 be scruti-
nizing the passengers arriv-
ing to board the ferry. As the
man with the suitcase came
closer. the dog stand intent-
ly at him, then surged for-
ward. straining a the leash.
Although the man tried to
protect his suitcae. the dog
pawed it to the g:ound. The
man in the grea uniform
quieted the dog with a sooth-
ing “Good girl, Sceba.”

for, drugs?” asked a curious

‘ onlooker.

“Nope, deer,” said an is-
land resident. “That’s John
Canario, a state conserva-
tion officer. He’s training
that dog to smell out deer

' meat.”

“Pretty good,” said Can-
ario, the man in the green
uniform. “Sheba smelled
that meat in the suitcase at a
good distance. We’ll try it
again with a deer skin in a
plastic grocery bag.”

This time the dog shot
forward, grabbed the bag
with sharp white teeth, and
wrestled it away from the
man carrying it. Sheba only
reluctantly gave it up to Can-
ario. The performance was

being videotaped by a police

oﬂicer, and we watched it
later in Canario’s home
while he critiqued Sheba’s
performance.

Canario brought out a

framed map of Prudence Is-,

land, a nine-mile by three-
mile piece of land shaped
like a ﬁsh with a crooked tail.
Most of its 3,800 acres are
privately owned by resi-
dents. The island lies off
Portsmouth in Narragansett
Bay and is serviced by a ferry
which makes several round-
trips a day from Bristol. One
of the island’s chief distinc-
tions is its herd of white-
tailed deer. Deer are far
more numerous here than in
any area of similar size in
Rhode Island. And that has
created Canario’s chief
problem as a state conserva-
tion oﬂicer. The problem, in
a word, is poaching.

“The poachers use bows
and arrows, so we don’t hear
any shots,” Canario said.
They dress the deer in the
woods and bring the meat
out in suitcases and travel
bags. Police ofﬁcer Tony
Parker told me he saw a guy
board the ferry with a big
suitcase that had blood drip-
ping out of it. “You can’t
prove it’s deer meat, and you
can’t search without a war-
rant. So I thought that if we
could train a dog to sniff out
dope, it ought to be possible
to train one to' sniff deer
meat. And that’s what we are
doing with Sheba.”

Canario says he has been
training Sheba for about six
months and that it will prob-
ably take another year to get
her fully trained.

“But she is learning fast,”
he says. “We haven’t caught
any poachers yet, but word
has gotten around. I would
say that poaching is almost
down to zero. It is going to be
very difﬁcult to sneak deer
meat past Sheba. She can
detect it even in the trunk of
a car. We do have other prob-
lems with deer. Despite only
about 17 miles of road on
Prudence Island, a number
of deer do get killed by cars
each year. We don’t pay for
damages to the car, but the
driveris allowed to take the
deer for meat. That can be a
temptation. After one guy
hit three deer in a row, we
arrested him. That’s not a
legal way to hunt deer.”

LAST SUMMER VACATION
my brother Alex and I
invited a friend to our
Kongscut, or Rattle-
snake, Mountain home.
While he was here, we
lost a ball in the small
wooded area to the side
of our house, and when
we were looking for it,
my brother came only
inches from stepping on a
three-foot rattlesnake.
After we had gotten a
safe distance away, we felt

 

we had three options. We
could kill it and no one
would know, we could
leave it alone and put our-
selves in danger when-
ever we went back to that
place in the woods, or we
could have it relomted.
My friend thought we
should kill it. I thought it
was illegal and wrong to
kill the innocent snake,
but I felt my safety. was
more important. We had

Saving the whales
istill uphill battle

HEN THE PILGRIMS landed in
Massachusetts, the North Atlantic Ocean
had about 50,000 right whales. A journal
7 entry noted that Cape Cod Bay had so many
?: whales that you could almost walk across the
2' = water on the backs of the animals. ’ . .
Today, fewer than 300 right whales (Eubalaena _
glacialis) can be found in the North Atlantic. and ~ ’
oniv 3,000 to 4,000 are alive worldwide, Before.
whalers took to the sea with harpoons in hand. the e.
.’ ‘seas had 100,000 to 300,000 right whales. Scientists
B’predict that the species will be‘extlnct in the »
course of the next few generations. .
Other species of thegreat whale-s have fared
' little better, Blue whales (Balaenoptera
' musculus), the largest animal to inhabit the earth.
‘ once numbered 20,000. but the current stock is
‘4 estimated at 6,500. The bowhead whale (Balearic

i papulation has recovered.

a About 15,000 humpback whales

(Megaptera novaeangliae) lived in the North
Pacific at the onset of mechanized commercial

. whaling, but today’s population is less than 1,000.

‘ The western North Atlantic is home to 2,000
humpbacks, but the eastern North Atlantic's stock
is small. The southern oceans once had close to
>100,000 humpbacks, but the current number there
"is believed to be about 2,500. Worldwide, the
humpback population has been reduced by more
than 95 percent. . ' . . -. . ~

. ' About 450,000 fin whales (Balaenopfera

g.“ physalus) once swam the seas; the current
number is a fourth of that. The population of the
sci whales (Balaenoptera borealfs) is estimated at
less than a third of its highest count. _
More than 2 million sperm whales (Physeter
macrocephalus) inhabited the oceans of the world
in the 19405, but only about half that number
surviVe today. The peak of the exploitation was
reached in the 19605, when 29,000 sperm whales
were killed each year. -

In the United States, whales are protected by

r. the federal National Marine Fisheries SerVices,
which enforces the Marine Mammal Protection
Act of 1972 and the Endangered Species Act of

‘ mercial slaughter of all marine'

bar the importation of products;

Worldwide efforts to save the
whales have been mounted by the
International Whaling Commission,
which first met in 1949. Some say
those efforts came too late; it was
1972 before the commission serious-
ly set about protecting individual;

_. species of whales, and another 10.;
years passed before the commission f:
decided to impose a moratorium on a:
commercial whaling; ___,__ , ,,

Although that moratorium began

31 last year, the whaling commission i
lacks enforcement power and is um i

lines. The moratorium has been}
j opposed by Japan, Norway, Korea, i

v

i and Norway have issued themselves
permits to kill whales for scientific
research and then have sold the
subjects of their “research” for
food.

Last June, the whaling commis-
sion adopted a strong set of rules
governing such scientific permits.
The commission rejected the re-
search programs proposed by Ice-
land, Korea and Japan because “as

Attorney Candace Sturdivant with lioness on beach at Port Bolivar.

Post Reporter

 

:3 GALVESTON — A 350-pound
lioness ordered destroyed after
biting a Crystal Beach man on the
chest was given a last-minute stay
of execution Thursday by a state
district judge.

Mike Kujawa, 35, a Crystal
Beach riding stable operator and
owner of the cat, was given until
nOOn Thursday to turn his 17-
month-old African lioness over to
Galveston County Health District
authorities, who ordered the cat
killed and her brain tissue exam-
ined. for the possibility of rabies.

State District Judge Ed Harris,
however, granted Kujawa’s peti-
tion for a temporary restraining
order preventing health officials
from taking the animal. Kujawa
{iled his petition 21 minutes be-
ore he was to turn the lioness,
Shanda, over to authorities.

'1 It was the second incident in-
volving a lion in the Houston area
in a week. In the first incident, an
8-year-old Houston girl was at-

P

Animal bit man

of execut

tacked by a BOO-pound lion at a
ﬂea market Saturday. The child,
Roxanne Hernandez, was listed in
serious but stable condition
Thursday at Hermann Hospital.

In Crystal Beach, the lioness bit
Shawn Schilder, 20, who works at
Kujawa’s riding stable, Tuesday
night while he, Kujawa and anoth-
er man were playing with~the cat
on the floor of Kujawa’s living
room, said Kujawa’s lawyer, Can-
dace Sturdivant. ’

“They were good-naturedly
wrestling around with her on the
ﬂoor when he (Schilder) acciden—
tally fell on her," Sturdivant said.

The cat, which has been de—
clawed, snapped at Schilder one
time on the chest, leaving a 2-
inch-by-Z-inch “L”-shaped
scrape, Sturdivant said. Schilder
was later treated for the bite at
Galveston’s John Sea‘ly Hospital
and released.

Neither ,Kujawa nor Schilder
could be reached for comment
Thursday. - "

Sturdivant said Kujawa, who

Ch
'on ,

has ailicense from the Galveston
County Health District to keep

Shanda, is trying to convince

Schilder to voluntarily submit to a
series of rabies vaccinations to

prevent authorities from destroy~

ing Shanda.

“The issue is not whether she is
dangerous — it’s obvious if she
wanted to hurt him she could
have —— it’s whether she has ra-
bies,” Sturdivant said. “So if he
has the shots, it’ll take care of it.”

But Joe Vickery, chief sanita-
tion officer with the Galveston
County Health District, said state
law requires that wild animals that
bite humans be destroyed and ex-
amined for rabies.

Despite the fact that Schilder
has not filed a' formal complaint
with the sheriff’s department or
with the health district, Vickery
believes the cat is dangerous and
should be put to sleep.

“I don’t think you can domesti-
cate any wild animal —— you saw
that in Houston,” Vickery said. . .

A hearing is set for Oct. 22 in
state district court.

How would you like it if there were bears

Think about it now —-— you could be squir-
rel or turkey hunting one spring and be run
up a tree by an irritable old sow with a cub.

It even that appeals to you, you’re a can-

even been formed yet. Naturally, it doesn’t
have a name. Think of Ducks Unlimited, but
for bears.

Black bears, of course. The kind that used
to live here before the settlements became

around in very small numbers in remote

woods that 1 can only figure must’ve been
made by a bear,” said Dudley Casey of Dai-
setta, which is in Liberty County and right
on the rim of the famed Big Thicket.

Moreover, Dudley is an expert woods-
man, an inveterate squirrel hunter more at
home under a leafy canopy than most of us
are on our patios. If he says he found a bear
track, he probably did.

“It stirred up in me something that’s been
inside for a long time now,” he said.
“Somehow or another, I’m going to put
bears back in these woods.” .

Dudley’s boss, Herbert Koen, seconds the
motion. Herbert is a former Texas game
warden who once had a bear until the Loui-
siana Department of Fish and Wildlife
learned it was one they had tagged and
came to claim it.

‘fWe’ve got enough property around here

it.” .
Well, there you have it, the birth of a
notion: Get bears from somewhere else and

turn them loose in East Texas. It has,

worked with whitetail deer. It is working
with wild turkeys. Why wouldn’t it work
with bears?

Without knowing anything of the ecologi-
cal factors I’d guess the biggest obstacle will
be money. Even a state like New York that’s
full of bears would probably charge an arm

to start them out on,” he said. “I’m all for

and a leg for each one, and then you’ve got
what I imagine would be fairly exotic freight
charges to deal with. You can’t just ﬂy back
with them in cuffs, you know. ,

And can a New York bear stand the clii.
mate down here, or would someone have to
go in and shear them every spring? L

On the other hand, predation’s certainly

not going to be any problem. Outlawry has _

been largely curbed in East Texas now",
thanks to Herbert Koen and others like him.
Besides, they say you can smell bear cook«
ing two miles away. Even in a microwave.)
Dudley and Herbert don’t pretend to havé
the answers, only the desire. They plan to
solicit the advice of Charles Allen, the
state’s chief wildlife biologist. If it’s possible
to reseed bears here, he’ll know how.
The money? Hard row to hoe but not
impossible as long as there are . organiza—
tions like the Houston Safari Club, which
has helped fund the new Type II Wildlife
Management Area program, the restocking
pheasants, and other similar projects.
There may be enough interest in re-esé
tablishing a wild population of bears to actu—
ally form an organization, hold banquets,
raffle off .30~30s and so forth. I shudder to
think of what name we’ll have to come up
with to produce the acronym BEARS, but
I’m sure we’ll live it down eventually. ,
Anyway, I’m all for it. I’ve been bear
hunting three times and it’s great. All you
have to do is keep whistling something
snappy and the bears will give you plenty of
room. '

Cowboys Ignore
Animal Rights ‘

Al- S.F.

 

-odeo,

By Katy Butler

Cowboys ﬂew off bucking
broncos and wrestled steers to
the ground yesterday at the
Grand National Rodeo at the
Cow Palace — despite a handful
of animal—rights protesters who
tried to get the crowds to go
home. '

When it was over, the protest-
ers wrapped up their banners and
declared it a success - and so did
the cowboys. ' ‘

A few families turned back at
the gate, and a handful of others
said it was the last rodeo they will
attend. ,

The action began shortly after
noon, when the protesters set up a
gantlet- in the Cow Palace parking
lot, trying to turn back a steady
stream of families dressed in their

finest tractor hats, Woven-straw"

cowboy hats, overstuffed blue jeans
and fake conch belts. ' '

“An investment in knowledge
pays the best dividends,” shouted
Leo Ruiz," offering leaflets showing
a steer with his tongue hanging out,
flying through the air at the end of
a lariat.

"You'll probably go home and
have a steak dinner," said a man in a
cowboy hat, pushing the leaflet
aside.

Ruiz.

“I believe it," said the man, as I

though Ruiz had confessed to first-

degree wimpdom. .

“What are you wearing on your
feet?" shouted a woman towing a
bewildered 4-year-old boy.

“They’re not leather," said
Ruiz, sticking out his running shoe.
“I’ve been a vegetarian for 15 years,
and I run ultra-marathons. Don’t let
anybody kid you about vegetarian-

m." ..

“Just what is so cruel about ro- -,
deo?” asked John Cummington, a.

former amateur cowboy, as he
drove by 'in a' pickup truck full of

Coke tanks for the concession stand.

“It’s an animal! It's a sport!"

Nancy Berna‘rdi put down. her ‘
sign and walked over to the win"

dow. “Sometimes calves have two or
three gallons of free blood in their
necks after calf-raping," she said
earnestly. “They’re damaged inter;
naily." ' " -

“They've been doing this for
years, lady,” said Cummington.

“They used to feed Christians
to the lions, too. They used to deny
blacks the right to vote," said Ber-
nardi, looking meaningfully at
Cummington's companion, Regen-

“No, I’m a vegetarian, pal,” said

Sen Justine Glyn-odd:

aid Hammond, who is black. “And I
marched in. the ’605 to stop that."

“I used to ride in junior rodeo .

- in Half Moon Bay, and I seriously

didn’t see any abuse —- although to
tell you the truth, it does happen,
they do break their necks once in a
while,” said Cummington, after the
confrontation‘was over. '

Then the protesters registered
a-small success. “We’re from Berke-

; ley and we’re really political,” said

Prudence 'Poppinck, clutching a
leaflet as she approached the Cow

Palace entrance with her family.

‘ is may he the last rodeo we go
to.”

Inside the Cow Palace, the ro~
deo and horse show carried on as it
always has. Broncs burst out of box-
es, all four feet in the air, twisting
and shaking until the whistles blew,
and handlers pulled the bucking

knees and to nuzzle Olsen's neck. .

“This is done with love and time,"

" ‘22” A alienating rummaging

[Pari'mu

I, Protesters at Dallas concert oppose
racing as form of cruelty to animals

By Bill Lodge
and George Kuernpel
Staff Writers

Officials of the Texas Horse
Racing Association said they
raised more than $300,000 Tuesday
night at Reunion Arena in Dallas
to promote pari-mutuel horse 'rac-
ing before a Nov. 3 statewide re-
ferendum on the issue.

More than 10,000 supporters of

L legalized racing attended a con-
, cert sponsored by the racing asso—_
; ciation that featured appearances

by country singers Willie Nelson
and George Strait, as well as pro-
fessional jockeys Willie Shoe-
maker and Eddie Delahoussaye.
Television personality Jimmy
Dean, a native of Plainview,
Texas, served as master of ceremo-
nies for the event and received, a

. lengthy ovation when he said:

 

 

 

“We’re going to have some run-
ning in this state. By golly, I think
we’ve got this
whipped.” _ .

Outside the arena, however,
about 20 protesters carried pla-
cards, some bearing the words: “A
vote for pari-mutuel gambling is a
vote for animal abuse.”

Diane Rukavina coordinated
the protests by the Dallas-based
Animal Connection of Texas, Gar-

land Humane Society and Austin-
. based Texas Human Information

Network.

’\

thing about

Ms. Rukavina said the three
groups have a combined member-
ship of more than 9,000 people and
oppose dog racing because some
trainers use live rabbits and other
animals to train greyhounds.

“We’d like to say that as much
as we admire Willie Nelson for his
work with Farm Aid, we’re just re-
ally disappointed that he would
use this concert to support some-
thing that’s going to cause so

many animal cruelties,” Ms. Ruka-

vina said.

Rick Knox, executive director
of the racing association, said con-
cerns about possible animal cru-
elty are unnecessary in Texas,
where, “It’s against the law to use
a live lure to train greyhounds.”

Earlier Tuesday, opponents of
legalized betting in Austin said
they may sue four television sta-
tions that refused io air an ad-
vertisement showing racing
greyhounds killing a rabbit.

Sue Cox, director of the oppo-
nents’ coalition, Texans Who Care,
said the stations -—— KDFW-TV
(Channel 4) in Dallas, KTRK-TV
in Houston and KTBC-TV and

KXAN-TV in Austin ——'rejected the ’

commercial because it was “too
sensitive.” .

The 30second spot, which Ms.
Cox said is being run by five other
stations in Houston, Dallas and
Austin, shows greyhounds run-

DALLAS MORNING NEWS

How two pet lovers
pamper hundreds
of hamsters, rats,
snakes and more

By Steve Levin
Staff Writer '

Diane Fishman lives with five snakes
named Rambo, Shera, Samantha II, Samp-
son and Delilah, 17 turtles, three dogs, a
tarantula, a South American hairy arma-
dillo, 150 rabbits, three dozen guinea
pigs and gerbils, about 700 rats and mice
and her husband.

They all get along fine together, al-
though sometimes her husband snores
and Mandy the armadillo gets gas and
the snakes knock over furniture while
slithering through the living room.

At mealtimes, they all pretty much
have it their own way: Her husband eats
meat and potatoes; Mandy has a custom-
made, high-protein stew; the turtles
slurp guppies and crickets; the guinea
pigs get pellets; the gerbils gobble
groats, sunﬂower seeds, peanuts and ra-
isins, and the mice and rats dine alfresco
on a combination of grains (wheat, bar-
ley, oats, alfalfa, milo and corn). The ro-
dents also manage to root their way
through 310 pounds of .bread every two
weeks. The snakes eat only once a month
-— usually a plump rat chosen from one
of the sawdust-filled cages in the garage.

Except for Ben, who is Ms. Fishman’s
favorite rat. He watches her wash dishes,
crawls all over her and, when he’s in a
loving mood, nibbles on her ear.

Life around the South Dallas house is
a lot easier these days. Just a few months
ago, Ms. Fishman had more than 2,000
rats and mice and three dozen snakes.
She has cut back quite a bit.

She and other Dallas animal lovers
get along fine with their menageries —
it’s the neighbors whom they fear. They
don’t exactly have to live secret lives —
just circumspect ones. The average

neighbor would probably rather have
Lyndon LaRouche next door than snakes
and rodents, even if they’re domestic ro-
dents.

Ms. Fishman asked that her maiden
name be used instead of her married
name.

“Most people that have this many ani-
mals have to hide and sneak and not tell
anyone because everybody’s scared to
death,” she says. “None of my neighbors
know about this stuff. I don't broadcast
it. I'm not trying to get thrills out of scar-
ing them to death.”

Ms. Fishman keeps her critters for
love and profit — she sells rats and mice
to other snake owners, who take advan-
tage of prices much cheaper than those
at area pet stores. But it’s mostly love.

“Not everybody can do it," says Ms.
Fishman, 43. “It has to be a special-type
person. There‘s very few people that can
pick up and love and cuddle a rat. But
the main thing is that you’ve got to have
a love for the animals because there
damn sure ain't any money in it. There
isn't any prestige in it either."

The strain of feeding and caring for
as many as 1,000 animals takes its toll.
Rats, mice, gerbils, hamsters and guinea
pigs all need their cages cleaned at least
once a week. It takes about 15 minutes to
clean a cage of rats, so figure an average
of four an hour, or 32 in an eight-hour
day.

Ms. Fishman not only has 57 cages of
rats and mice, but also eight cages for
gerbils and guinea pigs, 20 for rabbits,
five for snakes, three aquariums for tur-
tles, and Mandy’s glass home. By the
time she tends to everyone, it’s time to
start over. - .

And when Ms. Fishman cleans the
cages, it’s not as easy as just setting the
trash bags out on the curb. She has to
load the bags in the car and drive to a
city dump, the better to keep the manag-
erie a secret from the neighbors.

Although Ms. Fishman’s family is
used to the animals now -- she has photo
albums filled with pictures of her kids
holding snakes — 20 years ago it was a
different story.

Please see HOME on Page 3C.

 




 

Home is where the hundreds of hamsters, rats and snakes are

Continued from Page 1C.

“My husband had a fear of
snakes when I met him,” she says.
“He used to sit out there and blow
the horn, and I'd have to come out
and meet him. He said, ‘I ain’t com-
ing up there as long as you got them,
up there.’ I said, ‘Well, they live
here. Nobody asked you to come up
here. You don’t want to come up
here? Keep your. . . (expletive) out
there.’

“If you love your animals, it's no
different from raising kids. Each
one has its own little things that it
needs and requires. I mean, you can
raise kids cheaper than you can
raise these guys. The only break is,
you don’t have to get up and take
them to school and pick them up
every evening.”

Animals were a big part of Ms.
Fishman's childhood, including the
usual — stray dogs and cats, birds
with broken wings -— and the unu-
sual — snakes, snails, mountain li-
ons, tarantulas and mice. But there
are animals that Ms. Fishman just
plain hates: Small dogs, wasps and
bees top the list. She began keeping
snakes after moving to Dallas. Her
snakes needed to eat, and her love
for rate and mice led her to start
breeding colonies. The rest is a
study in proliferation.

But-the work is getting to her.
She plans to, reduce her zoo to a
handful of guinea pigs, gerbils and
rats and concentrate more on ex-
otic turtles and other animals.

"I do not want to work myself to
death," she says. “I want to be able
to enjoy my animals. I want to be
able to play with them besides just
working from sunup to sundown
cleaning.”

Nearly all of Ms. Fishman’s ani-
mals live outside -—- except the
snakes, turtles and armadillo - so
her home stays relatively clear of
clutter.

Most people would prefer to keep
all their animals outside. But maybe
drafts or chills are bad for birds, or
maybe the ﬂying squirrels would
glide away or maybe the ferrets
would get into fights with the chow

stew. The turtles get crickets, and the gerbils get groats.

PUPPY. ,
This is why Ann, a 40-year-old
North Dallas woman, keeps a major-
ity of her animals inside the house.
In her dining room are more
than 400 hamsters. Their cages
cover the dining room table, hiding
the china buffet. In her bedroom,
four ferrets run free. In another

bedroom, cages of rabbits and birds

and two flying squirrels line a wall.
In the den are half a dozen large
parrots and ET, a rope fish.

In what used to be her children’s
playroom, about 200 birds flutter
around a wiremesh aviary and a

dozen ' cages. in nearby cages,
guinea pigs luxuriate in sawdust
andrhay while rabbits survey the

. scene from cages stacked against a

wall. Wandering through this zoo
are two cats, the chow, and, when
she doesn’t have ﬂeas, Brandy the
Doberman pinscher.

Ann, who didn’t want her real
name used, admits that she’s gone
oVerboard with her animals. Be-
cause she operates a small pet store
where she sells some animals on
weekends, she is perpetually be-
hind in her cleaning and care. In
addition to all the indoor animals,

she has a back room filled with 40
or so rabbits and a back yard where
three dogs, a duck, pigeons and
more rabbits wander around like
Animal Farm come to life. A Shet-
land pony and Peggy Sue the pig,
two longtime backyard mainstays,
are gone.

“I think a lot of my love for ani-
mals is my kids’ getting older and
them not needing me," says Ann,
who is divorced. “The animals need
me. But I think that I’ve overdone
it. My big joke is that I’m going to
get out of pets and limit myself to
50. But you’d be surprised when you
work with them and take care of
them how attached you get to them.

“Of course, I’ve always gone to
extremes. I’m not educated. I'm not
skilled. But I’m the type I have to do
something I like. I would feel no

nsense of accomplishment working

at Foley's and having some little old
lady telling me what to do. When I
go into something, I go into it with
gusto.”

Take, for instance, her rabbits.
Months before Easter, she bought
them to breed as Easter bunnies.
But when you breed animals, she
says, you have to be willing to cull
the crop.

“And I can’t kill,” she says. “So
they all grew up, and I had too
many rabbits. 1 had 25 ferret babies
and luckily sold them all.” Now she
hopes to sell most of the rabbits.

Cleaning up is her biggest chore.
and since she works weekends, she
has only five days to get it done.

“You can’t say, ‘I’ll do it next
week.’ It just won’t work," she says.
“Can you imagine if I went for three
weeks without doing anything
here? Can you imagine what real

\ filth there would be?”

 

None of her three daughters
helps on any kind of regular basis.

“There’s no way I can get sick be-
cause I have no one else to care for
the animals,” Ann says. “My kids
would let mine die, so I don’t dare
get sick. However, I’m a Very
healthy person. ' '

“I’ve never made them take care
of the animals or clean up after
them, so they could care less about
me having them. Oh yes. They say,
‘Oh, Mom,’ because it’s gotten too
big. And it’s embarrassing. My
younger one, she really can’t have
friends over.”

Ann has gone to great lengths to
keep her secret secure from the
neighbors. The only animals she
has that can be heard from the
street are birds, cats and dogs. Her
one remaining duck is a quackless
duck.

Eventually, Ann would like to
open a full-line pet store. Or move
to a 20-acre piece of land in the
country. Or have some help tending
the animals. Still, there are doubts.

“Some days,” she says, “I get up
and lthink, ‘This is stupid. I must be
crazy.’ ”

fall to the ax, chain saw and bulldozer to
cover Chicago’s Lincoln Park. Another

arid desert. In those same l5 minutes, 12
species of plants and animals will vanish
from the Earth forever.

Such statistics tumble from the mouth of Peter
Thacher, whose four-plus decades serving humani-
ty on this fragile blue, green and brown globe
taught the diplomat/scientist/politician a grim les-
son: “If you can’t save the world, at least you
should try to see as much of it as you can before
it’s gone.”

Time, notes Thacher, a leading environmentalist,
is running out for those who would experience the
exotic flora and fauna that are so much a part of
an afﬂuent American’s armchair travel daydreams.
Many of the planet’s most beautiful assets are dis-
appearing under the sheer press of humanity.
Among the mounting toll: thousands of species of
plants, animals and fish; entire forests, savannahs,
coral reefs and beaches.

The effects are dramatic and widespread, from
the overpopulation threatening the famous safari

tral America, where opportunities are diminishing

maining meager natural resources to the maximum
Just to feed their hungry and to service the debts
they owe to othér countries. Wiping out the natu-
ral resources, of course, makes these countries
even more poverty—stricken even as their more for-
tunate neighbors mourn the passing of their
dreams of wilderness experiences.

Those .dreams, Thacher says, are fading with
every swrng of a peasant’s ax, hoe or sickle, with
every newborn’s cry. And Thacher sees a positive
Side toyrewing these wrenching global quandaries
as tourism issues: “In many ways our best hope is
that as many people as possible will make a trip to
where our best assets are disappearing and then
come home with a commitment to help save as
much as they can.” >

Such travel, he says, is bound to dramatize the
press of hungry humanity against the world’s fast-
shnnkrng wildlands. Chain saws rip into millions
of mighty trees in the tropical rain forests of Asia,
Africa and South America even as hordes of Third
World villagers scour grasslands and rangelands for
the last wood chips, dung piles and dry grasses to
burn in their cooking ﬁres. Burning the dung costs
the farmers badly needed fertilizer, which means
less food and still more country turned into desert
in a Vicrous cycle that shows no sign of slackening.

t the same time a deadly cock-
tail made of billions of gallons
of raw sewage, every imaginable
chemical and vast quantities of
silt loosened‘when trees are
felled pours into the world’s
lakes, rivers and oceans, wiping
’ out aquatic life forms even as other species are
; dying out wholesale in the devastated rain forests
" anddried-out rangelands.

This year, as the human species welcomes its 5
billionth baby, no fewer than 17,500 other species
of plants and animals will become extinct, an an-
' nual human-caused toll now thought to be part of
r a looming mass extinction to equal famous natural
, episodes in the dim past, 'such as the one that
; killed off the dinosaurs. " ' '

,_ The World Resources Institute, where Thacher

labors on such momentous global issues, predicted
in a just-completed “inventory” of the planet’s ge-
- netic diversity that a million separate species will
. die off between now and the fast-approaching turn
of the century. “In the next century, if present
rates of forest loss continue, one-third or more of
all species could be lost—a mass die-off that would
rival past extinctions that occurred over millions
of years,” warns the 353-page “World Resources
1987.” - .

Key to these. grim predictions are forces that
environmentalists call “deforestation” and “deser-
tification” (creation of arid conditions through
land mismanagment), twin engines of destruction
'most apparent in precincts of Asia, Africa and
~ South America that are famous as habitats of the
, world’s most exotic animal and plant life.

As populations grow in these areas, local govem-
ments are forced to exploit resources—often solely
’ trees—to feed and house the masses. As 1. Michael

Sweatman, a Canadian banker and allyoof .
’ Thacher’s, put it: “A tree isn’t worth anything 3

. until you cut it down, and once you cut it down

it’s gone forever. But if you’re hungry, what else '

can you do?” . . .
And so the trees topple in Brazil, Indonesia, the

Philippines, Malaysia, India, Kenya and Rwanda, Burma,
Bangladesh, Peru, Belize, Paraguay, Guatemala and the rest of the
Third World countries blessed with forests. The poor in countries
lacking timber, such as Nepal, Botswana, Ethiopia and the High
Andean Plateau of South America, scratch out their crops from the
arid ground, often causing the spread of desert conditions in their
quest for wood and other “biomass fuels.”

The devastation is demonstrated most dramatically in numbers
compiled by groups such as the World Resources Institute, the Unit-
ed Nations Commission on the Environment and even the U.S.
Central Intelligence Agency, whose dire predictions on the environ—
ment’s immediate future in “The Global 2000 Report to the Presi-
dent” were made public by President Jimmy Carter in 1979.

“Global 2000” focused strongly on deforestation and desertiﬁca-
tion: Every minute of every day another 100 acres of tropical forests
are cut down, a yearly swath of 82,000 square miles, an area much
larger than Illinois (56,000 square miles). At the same time the
deserts of the world grow each year by another 43,000 square miles,
an area larger than West Virginia.

Over the last 30 years no less than 40 percent of the world’s
tropical rain forests have been cut down; the World Resources Insti-
tute estimates that another 40 percent will be gone by the year 2025.

A number of scientific issues have been raised by the global assault
on tropical greenery. Most widely publicized is whether the so~called
“greenhouse effect” will set in as the felling of trees halts the trans-
formation of billions of tons of carbon dioxide from the world’s
autos, factories and animals into life-giving oxygen.

 

 

 

n the greenhouse scenario, the resulting addition of earbon
dioxide will reduce the amount of heat given off by the planet
into surrounding space, eausing a rise in global temperatures.
Scholars such as Cornell University’s science guru Carl Sagan
debate whether the result will be a melting of the polar ice eap

, and the sudden immersion of such coastal cities as New York,

London, Bombay and Tokyo. ‘ ,

But while futurists speculate about Third World pressures on rain
forests creating a potentially eatastrophic let Century sea rise, a num-
ber of recent studies question whether\ acid rain in the industrialized
worid, another legacy of overcrowding, is robbing the potential traveler
of some of Europe’s scenic wonders right now.

At issue here is a suddenly vexing problem that scientists have named
Waldsterben (forest death) in such famous areas as Germany’s Black
Forest, the Swiss Alps, the French Vosges countryside, Czechoslovakia’s
Giant Mountains, parts of Yugoslavia and southern Sweden.

First detected in 1980, Waldsterben is a still-mysterious malady char-
acterized by yellowing and browning of nwdles and leaves, loss of feeder
roots, markedly decreased growth and “prodigious production of lichens”
on affected trees followed by death of the tree, according to a German
study of the phenomenon in the scientiﬁc journal Plant Disease.

The most readily suspected culprit is the vast air pollution being
released by Europeans through auto emissions, factory srnokestacks and
other industrial sources. It is, however, unclear whether the pollutants at
fault are sulfuric acid, nitrous oxide, aluminum, ozone or certain heavy
metals such as the lead in gasoline.

“Worid Resources 1986” lists forests in 15 European countries where
trees are affected by the symptoms and estimates that 17 million acres
are damaged or dying “West Germany is the most seriously affected
country in Europe with 52-55 percent of its forests, covering neariy [9.8
million acres], in various stages of decline and death,” the study says In
Switzerland, the southern alpine eantons of Grisons and Valais reported
between 50 and 60 percent of the trees affected, according to the 1986

survey. .

The industrialized world, then, is far from immune to the awesome
and destructive forces of overcrowding and environmental mismanage—
ment that inspired Thacher to urge his fellow Amerieans to get in their
travel before the changes now underway are complete.

For years people have been traveling to Venice to view that city’s
ancient artworks and buildings as they are being attacked by acid rain.
But unlike the Third World, with its seemingly overwhelming burdens of
poverty and overcrowding, prospects exist that Europeans on both sides
of the Iron Curtain will put the needed ﬁlters on their ears and ,
smokestacks and take other steps to stop Waldsterben and perhaps even}:

 

 

 

 




to ease the slow rotting ofVenice.
The European forests, like those along the US-
Canadian border ean largely spring back from much
of the damage caused by acid rain, but, notes
Thacher, “What is happening in the tropical rain
forests is simply devastating and often irreversible.” '
1 Of particular concern, scientists say, is that the

same rain forests being chewed up by Third World
peasants are the richest sources of plant and animal
life on Earth. No less than 50 percent of all species of
plants and animals live in the 7 percent of the globe
covered by rain forests.

Oﬁentimes a single tree acts as an ecosystem for "
dozens of animals and hundreds of plants In Western
Ecuador the Rio Palenque Research Station boasts of
recording 1,025 plant species within its 1.7-square-
kilometer (.64-square-mile) compound, the greatest
plant diversity recorded anywhere on Earth. Much of
the nearby forests are being logged.

In Borneo a single ZS-acre forest was found to con-
tain 700 speciesoftrees,asmanyasinallofNorth
America. The Amazon Basin is known to contain
50,000 tree species. At the current rate 40 percent of
thebasinwillbeclearcutbytheyear2025, erasing
much of this genetic diversity.

A National Forum on Biodiversity held in Wash-
ington last year by the National Aeademy of Sciences
and the Smithsonian Institution noted that 25 percent
of all medicine is derived from plants, mostly tropieal
varieties.

Worse yet, the meeting’ 5 participants warn, despite
the millions of species of plants and animals on Earth,
80 percent of all food consumed by humans comes

 

from fewer than two dozen species of plants and
animals, mostly in the form of wheat, rice and com. .

Thus a hungry planet has little margin of safety
should drought, climatic changes or such diseases as
the Ameriean Corn Blight of the 19705 attack one of
these few crops. The scientists warn that chances are .
high that among the tens of thousands of species
being wiped out each year will be the one that could
have saved millit'ms For instance, a grubworm that .
became extinct conceivably could have secreted an
enzyme that could cure, say, a eatastrophic illness
such as AIDS. .

University of Wisconsin scientist .
recently found plants in Mexico of
the rare grass species ealled teo-
cinte, the ancestor from which In-
dians bred the plant now known
, as corn. The ﬁnd was considered
' enormously important because
that humble grass contains the genes that once made
Indian corn immune to the many diseases that afﬂict
many of today’s hybrids. Yet it might well have been
one of the 17,500 species wiped out each year. The
university now is combining the rare teocinte with '

various hybrids to improve their chances for survival.

Nine leading biologists at the Washington biodiver-
sity conference, including Edward O. Wilson and
Ernst Mayr of Harvard University, Thomas Eisner of
Cornell and Paul Ehrlich of Stanford, formed what
they called the “Club of Earth,” warning that the
i danger of extinction is “a threat to civilization second

Another success story is in Rwanda, in east central
Afriea, where gorillas are the attraction. “If it weren’t
for tourist dollars, gorillas would be extinct,” says
Overseas Adventure Travel’s Rick Thomson. Revenue
from tourism helped the govemment to maintain its
national parks, track poachers and help fund gorilla
research.

Erosion is conﬁned to the trails. And best of all, the
unique Galapagos wildlife has not lost any of its fa-
mous trust in man.

“Although conservation in the Galapagos is expen-
sive, a substantial part of the cost is paid by the
25,000 visitors who come every year,” Lindblad notes.
“Foreigners now pay a fee of $40 to visit the islands
Locals play a lot less, but this is fair in my view.”

Most tour operators agree that the Galapagos is a
model for other Third Worid countries. “The govem-
ment recognizes that it has a real wealth. It has made
strong efforts to preserve the islands The Galapagos
show the positive worth of tourism,” says Bangs of
Sobele

g “In the last IS years there has been a strong lobby
5 to maintain wildlife preservation in India,” says San-
: jay Saxena, director of Himalayan programs for Over-
:seas Adventure Travel. “The effort was started by the
as World Wildlife Fund with Project Tiger.”

The tiger, Saxena explains, is a powerful link in the

i food chain, the ultimate carnivore. If tigers are threat-
§ ened, the deer and antelope on which they fwd may
g become overpopulated and, as food supplies become
> searce, also start to die out, along with their food
gsources. “The tiger was down to 300 to 400 about 25
years ago,” Saxena says. “Now the population is close
to 3,000.”
3; India also has had success with the one-homed In-
3; dian rhino, whose population fell to some 150 but

§ ways been a certain amount of conservation of

Finally, acknowledging that the tourists would come
anyway, she agreed to help train guides to bnng
tourists to nearby chimp-viewing areas. The govem-
ment in turn agreed to protect the integrity. of ; her
research area and, with revenue generated by tourism,
to support primate conservation efforts. _

MariePierre Griffin of Travel Plans lntemational in
Oak Brook sends her groups to Voleanoes Nau'onal
Park in northwestern Rwanda for gorilla viewing. The
govemment, she says, issues a maximum of 24 per-
mits each day, six for each of the four families of
gorillas that can be seen. The current fee of $119 for
each permit reportedly will jump to $150 next year.

When a country such as Rwanda develops tourism
potential, tour operators are eager to develop a base
for themselves. For example, Abercrombie & Kent
recently sent a reconnaissance team to report on po-
tential operations in Tanzania’s Gombe Stream,
where Goodall does her research.

“The potential for the area is excellent,” says the
report, though it notes that the area is not properiy
controlled or managed, “aggravated by an
acrimonious relationship existing between national
parks and scientists.” ' ;

las and an itinerary, it is indicative of the groundwork
required by a tour company before a conunitmentis
made to take tourists into a wilderness area.

Every wilderness area, it seems, has its own exam-
plesofhowmancanhelporupsetafoodchainor

 

 

ecosystem.

In the waters off Antarctica, Japanese and Russian
ﬁshing vessels are hauling in loads of krill, high-pro-
tein planktonic material used as food by the Japanese
that is also a major food source for whales, seals and

gums

“The question is, how much krill can we take away
without putting the (whale, seal and penguin] popula-
tion in danger.” asks Vemer Zehnder, Society Ex-
peditions’ vice president for planning and operations,
who has has been to Antarctica 32 times since 1969.
Society Expeditions sponsors wildlife cruises to An-
tarctrca.

mm 1900 to 1940 the whales’ enemy
off the continent’s shores was the
whaler. When the whales were de—
pleted, the hunters turned to fur and
elephant seals and then the penguins
All three have made a comeback, but
the reduction of krill could create a
potentially lethal imbalance. Whales would then go
after the seals and penguins, who would be forced to
seek food farther and farther from shore. The penguin
chicks ultimately would starve to death from lack of

care.
“It’ s a whole chain reaction depending upon the

krill, a tiny see-through shrimp,” says Zehnder.
“At this time the wildlife in Antarctica is fantastic.

It hasn’t been hunted in 40

yearsYoucansitonabeach,

Such pristine wonders

notwithstanding, a more un-

conventional look at the cur-

rent state of nature might also

proﬁt tourists, says Jacques

Cousteau, pOp environmen-

talist, scientist and skipper of

the world- famous boat

Calypso. In his “Cousteau Al-

manac,” he suggests a world

theme tour akin to visiting

gourmet restaurants, global

wineries and the like but with

the goal of learning about the

world’s environmental crisis.

First Cousteau would have
the traveler board a yacht in
the Caribbean to view what
the UN’s Environmental Pro-
gram has labeled “the most
pesticide-damaged sea in the
world. .. largely as a result of
agricultural runoff from the in-
tensely sprayed croplands of
Mexico and the United
States.” Additionally, the
sewers of Havana, Kingston
. (Jamaica), Nassau, Belize City
(Belize), Barranquilla and Car-
tagena (Colombia) and Colon

 

(Panama) all ﬂow into the turquoise waters alo:
with “the chemical residues from ﬁelds of coffee, or
ton, bananas, sugar, cocoa and citrus fruits,” the A
manac notes

Next stop is Port—au-Prince, Haiti, “a pocket - ,
human and ecological misery, perhaps as intense
that in the most impoverished nations of Africa ar
southern Asia,” Cousteau writes.

Under strongmen Francois “Papa Doe” and Jea
Claude “Baby Doc” Duvalier, there was scant Chan
for environmental enlightenment between 1957, Wht
the father became “president for life,” and 198 ,
when the son was ousted. Masses of Haitians we
kept alive for those Duvalier decades by clear-cutting
the island’s mahogany forests until 90 percent of al
the island’s mahogany trees were gone. The resultin:
erosion made much of the land unﬁt for agricultur
even as population growth continued, resulting in tl
well-known tragedy of Haiti’s boat people. Some e:
perts, says Cousteau, warn that the last tree in Hai
willfalltotheaxwithinthenextsixyears

The tour continues up the Amazon to the exot
community of Manaus, Brazil, an excellent stopping
off point to view ﬁrsthand the global assault on bi(
logical diversity by developers of rain forests. North «

has been given over to 20 national parks or wildland
preserves Showpiece for the parks, says Cousteau, is
Corcovado, 89,000 acres of rain forest on the Paciﬁc
coast and home to the spider monkey, peccan'es,
coatimundis and six species of rare eats, including the
celot and jaguar, which are no longer present in the
.-.st of Central America But, adds the explorer, a
sitor should hurry beeause increased oil prices are
)rcing major park cutbacks in personnel, and
"caching is becoming a major problem. -

or an African perspective, Cousteau
recommends Tsavo National Park in
Kenya, where 8,069 square miles of
ﬂat brush country and semidesert, the
largest national park on Earth, is being
devoured by elephants driven there by

"’- vast farming in the rest of the crowded

)untry. Although speciﬁcally designed to preserve el-

ihants along with the rest of the famous Afriean
--«una, Tsavo now hosts an overpopulation of 30,000
nachyderms, each of which consumes roughly 700
f )unds of grass, leaves and twigs a day even as the
‘~ rman population, growing 3.5 percent per year,

esses against the reﬁrge’s fences. . ‘

A Kenyan game preserve complete with zebras,

ms, giraﬁ'es and other exotic wildlife remains within

ght of the skyscrapers of downtown Nairobi, but all

:e elephants have been driven away by pressure from

rming and suburban expansion, Cousteau notes.

To view the effects of acid rain, Cousteau points

avelers to Athens, where the very air is eating away

the Acropolis and its famous statuary even as
etal clamps installed during the 19205 to stabilize

e temple now are badly oxidizing .

One ean view similar damage, Cousteau observ ,
. the great cathedrals of Europe: Rheims, Chartres

1d Strasbourg (France); Cologne (West Germany);

ncoln and Wells (Great Britain). He writes: “It is
7 issible that the Acropolis eventually will be listed as
mething the serious world traveler could have seen
: another time.” ‘ ‘

So, perhaps,will it be said that the next generation

iuld have seen an elephant, a rain forest, a black
' .ino, a California condor and so many other of the
:::asures that millions of world travelers have enjoyed
Free the ﬁrst tourists, two Romans named Herodotus

rd Plutarch, hit the road seeking foreign wonders.

Still, while conservationists paint bleak pictures,

any with good cause, there are bright strokes on the

)rldwide conservation eanvas. They certainly include
:uador’s approach to preserving the Galapagos, In-

a’s good fortune with the tiger and Rwanda’s efforts

“We may have to extend the idm of limiting the
umber of people who can visit certain sites,”
I ndblad suggests “In the Galapagos it is already
-. me by controlling the number and size of boats that

-. ipelago. . . .

“We in the West are getting more afﬂuent and have
are time and inclination to set off on our personal

Jrneys of exploration and discovery. It would be
' rd—and I believe quite wrong—to deny people the

'ance to spend their holidays in the way they want.

“But,” Lindblad concludes, “there must be control.
Z’iphazard grOWth is no answer. And I’m sure that
.L.: vast majority of tourists will understand and_be

iteful for such controls whether we are talking

out crowded cities or remote wilderness areas.” I

reat zoos today are
. as much botanical
gardens as they are
, zoological gar—
dens,” says Dr. Terry Maple,
director of Zoo Atlanta. And it
isn’t just a case of a few daf—
fodils here or a manicured lawn
there.

The most basic objective is to
simulate the animals’ native en—
vironments with plants and
trees that can survive in our cli-
mate. “What. we’re trying to
create here is a naturalistic
landscape where people and
animals will come to know each
other,” adds Maple.

Accordingly, the 200 has re-
cently taken what Maple calls a
“tremendous step forward” and
created a horticulture depart-
ment. The new team is headed
by Don Jackson, who last
served as horticulturist for the
Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical
Garden and is, says Maple,
“one of the best young horti-
culturists in the country.”

“We use honeylocust trees to

 

simulate the acacia trees of the
African savanna,” says Jack-
son. “We can even prune the
lower branches to make it look
like giraffes have just gone by.
. . . For the rain forests, we
use some real tropical plants,
which we put in the greenhouse
in winter, as well as cold—hardy
plants that look tropical.”
Magnolias, for example, simu-
late tropical ﬁgs with their shiny
leaves and channeled ribs for
water drainage.

Aside from re—creating the
wilds of Cameroon and Ke-
tambe in the backyard of At-
lanta, the horticulture team will
use plants and trees to provide
shade for animals and people,
to give the animals privacy, to
soften architecture, to provide
browsing material for some an—
imals, to camouflage the signs
of the city and for aesthetic
purposes.

Plants and trees can be ar—
ranged to provide barriers and
to create a sense of anticipation
in the same way as the cutout

 

windows inside the High Mu-
seum. They also provide color,
even in winter, when bark tex-
tures and bright berries stand
out against the browned
grasses. In spring, the place will
be ablaze with the color of
20,000 flowers whose bulbs are
now being planted. By sum-
mer, Willie B. will move to a
brave new world of lush herbs,
bamboo and tropical trees, a
place where, says Maple, sci-
ence and artistry are as one.
Already in operation are a
festive new entrance plaza

 

capped off with a flock of Chi-
lean flamingos, the Okefenokee
Cafe next to what will one day
be the 200’s own swamp, and
the snazzy Zoo Atlanta Trad-
ing Co.

Even the messy look of con—
struction is a welcome sight.
Nearest to completion are the
Ford African Rain Forest,
which will house “Tillie B. and
three new gorilla families, and
the adjacent Asian Rain Forest
where orangutans and gibbons
will reside.

GREAT FALLS, MONTANA TRIBUNE - September 10, 1987

Z00 bears hope

By RALPH BIDWELL
Tribune Correspondent

Two problem grizzlies now living
in the Detroit Zoo may produce cubs
to help restore the Cabinet Moun-
tains’ faltering grizzly population.

The female grizzly was sent to the
200 after being captured under the
porch of a ranchhouse west of
’ Choteau. The male was sent to the
zoo from Yellowstone National
Park. ,

; Although females don’t normally
‘ mature until they are 4 or 5, the
bears showed signs of mating this
. spring. If she does produce cubs,
they may be placed in the den with
a female black bear hibernating in
the Cabinet Mountains to see if the
black bear will raise them as her
own.

“It’s never been tried before,”

“We have several black bear sows
with radio collars in the Cabinets
and monitor their activities,” he
said. “When they are hibernating we
will go to their dens to learn if they
have given birth to cubs.”

“When the zoo cubs are about six
weeks old, they will be taken from
their mother and placed with a
nursing black bear still in hiberna-
tion.

“but no females.” Black and grizzly
bears don’t cross-breed.

Kathy Latinen, zoologist in the
mammal section of the Detroit 200,
said she heard about the federal
program and got approval to accept
the grizzlies. The zoo has been

They were moved three times in

1985 after they got into beehives and ' ~

tore up crab apple trees. Once they

were moved as far west as the Mis- ,
sion Mountains, but they made their ‘

way back to the east SIOpes of the
Rockies in a few weeks.

The third time she was darted she‘
was freed on the Sun River Game

Choteau. That encounter earned her
the flight to Detroit.

Her male companion came from
Yellowstone National Park. He was
captured last October, detained at
the Seattle Zoo over the winter and
air freighted to Detroit last spring.

Latinen said the grizzlies have not
been given names. They are fed
omnivore pellets, a mixture of meat
and grain. Occasionally they get a
treat of fish or berries.

‘ The zoo grizzlies have shown signs:

.5 of mating. Females normally don’t
fmate until they are 4 or 5, but
Servheen is hoping the bear will be,

mate in the spring but the embryo

doesnt begin growing until the bear
- enters the den in the fall. The babies
are tiny when born. They feed on-
their mother’s milk until she wakes

up in the Spring and they get to,
travel outside.

If the sow becomes pregnant, she
will be placed in isolation and kept
as calm as possible. If she is upset
she might kill and eat her cubs,
Latinen said.

Zoo bears don’t hibernate because

they have a constant source of food. .
