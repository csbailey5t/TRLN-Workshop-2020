and buried it in a ﬁeld

LAMENT FOR.AURIC*

1971 - 1985

You sleep-curled round as a secret, safe

from pain, arthritis & old age.

You sleep deep in earth: dog tags, water bowl
close to your paws in the underground

& glow of golden minerals where

azaleas sigh in summer air. The fearless
grackles fly in pairs. Soon many birds
'crowd our lawn. Are these the mourners

for golden retrievers?

Moving carefree, content to be off the clock
I saw you become grass, muscle-loose, rolling
over & over for the joy of it on the verge

of laughing out loud, leaping

for imaginary tennis balls. Your third eye
beamed scent to places & things

the sighted never see. ‘

You never offered love in a limited way

as intellectuals do. Old lover,buddy, smoocher
kissing my toes, arms, hand & generous

with leftover kisses for any passerby

who looked your way.

Yet, on the greenest day of July

you went down like a seal, trusting

that nightmare shark: the terrorist

who strikes with no warning or conscience
in terrible thunder, piercing

your heart through.

NOT A DEAD-MOUSE POEM

Moving a dresser in my
half-done home, I met

the mose who'd been munching
my bread and granola,

in the bottom drawer.

She was curled in a nest

of fiberglass insylation;

her three furry infants

dangled from her nipples

when she dashed away frcm light.

In my mind were poems

about mother mice in drawers
leaving or eating their babies:
I tried to catch them all

but the mother ran away,
across the floor out a hole.

I put the now squealing
blind ones in a pan

under the house with cheese
to tempt the mother back.

I heard her come and g0:

went outside to look.

She jumped out of the pan,
empty except for cheese.

She'd already moved the babies
and was coming back for a meal.

A REASON To PREFER THE COMPANY OF
BOXELDER BUGS, AND GREET THEIR RETURN
WITH PRAISE

After the killing frost,
boxelder bugs return,

regular as religion,

into curtains, coffee, sunlight,
minding their business
without comment.

Maybe they are in charge

of counting leaves blowing
past the south window.

I won’t ask; they

won’t tell; the old fellowship
blossoms between us.

 




SMALL ESTATE
For Z.

When the dog died we buried

the orange bowl, the pink blanket,

and the red rubber bone, sweet-breath-
scented, made in England--

kept the collar and leash
hanging still in the entryway
under coats and umbrella hooks.
Hairs are herevand there--

black, white needles stitched
to an old pair of slacks at the back

oflthe closet, or falling from even
\lwe

’vacuumed cracks in the couch.

The gold throw has loops

where claws have caught, but
the corners, the sun on the rug,
the mat by the door hold less

than themselves to mark an eight-year
presence. The clutter of me

that is this room wants to be

such a friend, to go unencumbered,

leaving so little to fill great emptiness.

why We Feed the Hummingbirds

At noon in early spring
the first one comes alone
to hover above the hanging clay

pot of sweetened water.
He balances delicately
above the next breathless

moment of his life, a little
green jewel suspended on
the nervous motoring of wings.

He glides forward and stops
as quickly as a thought,
bobs and tastes the sugar

with the curved needle of his bill
and levitates onto a twig,

which dips and rises, swaying

just barely as he rides it
through the tiny breeze
his sudden stopping makes.

 




(For my cat, Sinbad)
by

Patsy Anne Bickerstaff

She hovers, standing on a piece of sky,
Beautiful anger beating sunlit wings.
She screams her golden curses on my head,

This angel of small deaths, who dares defy

Love‘s strength with destiny's. Those wild beings

That know her shadow's threat, have cause to dread;
Not you, meek friend. Her victory is dead,

Her danger crushed to futile posturings.

Rescued, embraced, your blue eyes contemplate
Lessons for cats, for sparrowhawks and kings:

That beauty does not always glorify;

That circling evil is not always fate;

That hunger is more murderous than hate;

And love is keener than the hunter's eye.

—-from ”For a Coming Extinction"
by N.S. Merwin

So, here it is, Brown,

even filthier than you used to get

in a wet December field, even smellier

than your constant

black-and-red-gummed panting.

Your death ;

has been brought right to you, you lazy dog.

You don’t have to ask any more

of eyes that have pulled blue curtains

or back legs too stiff to lift

and quick to turn every surface icy

or a clumsy heart

or lungs that are already going back

to swamps like the ones they were born to work

Here it is, you big web-footed poodle.

Too soon. From not nearly as far away

as we tried to think, ‘ ‘

something almost friendly

has fetched your death.

we found it rolled up on the step this morning
on top of the human news.

So, take it, Brown. Don’t

just wag and want your ears rubbed,

you dumb dog, you bump, you noodle,

you soft-bitten pussycat.

It’s the least you could do in a century--
one trick

you didn’t make up yourself.

THE BUFFALO HERD A2 THE ONONDAGA INDIAN RESERVATION

High among the line of hills

which the Holder Up of the Heavens

dropped long ago to destroy the Stone Giants
a meadow opens, wide and green.

There new posts of poplar and thick wire
protect the herd, dark shapes of power,
keeping them in, keeping out the guns
and narrow anger of those who envy

those few acres left the Onondagas.’

In that May meadow Indian boys

pick milkweed greens and pull the burrs

from the thick coats of grazing animals.
They relearn the old songs of Buffalo People
from the drumbeat of hooves on earth.

You walk with slow steps, the open sky
above you a face, so large you can't see
its features, only know in your heart
that it observes all you are, all you do

as the Buffalo walk on this land again,
brought back once more to remind the people
of an older balance, a promise of peace

we humans still must learn to keep.

The Night Vet

After hours, on weekends and holidays

an aquamarine sign goes on at the corner

of Constance and De La Vina streets,
"Emergency Pet Clinic." One by one

they come, parking in the finance company lot
and carrying an animal towards the green glow.
Like a mender of broken toys,

the pet doctor has seen everything.

As the night gets deeper
the cages, big and small, fill.

A bird treated for asthma stops wheezing
and chirps at the hospital lighting.

Two dogs and a puppy, hit by cars,

move in the white sleep of slowly
dissolving anesthesia. One cat

with a hairball stuck in his stomach

awaits surgery with open black eyes.

The soul of this place is in its sounds:
the phone, urgent and empty

without day noises; the squishy

radiology apron; a dissonance of scissors
in a metal pan. The puppy wakes up and
whines steadily until morning. It is then
that owners reappear to meet the doctor.
He calls the pets by name, handing them
back with all the hope of a Noah,

the flood over and the ark unloading.

The basis for friendship is

Yet they call our families “packs”

A communard who knows

I object to this moniker

of shufﬂing beast. It’s true

that the only way to eat
is ultimately to rip something apart,
but you can’t swallow

With your eyes, and besides,
we wolves have big hearts:
We are gentle, bright,

and penultimately kind.
Survival rules,
but after that comes conviviality!

A wolf attack on a moose
is no worse
than the conventions

of nations,
or the strategies

NURTURE

From a documentary on marsupials I learn
that a pillowcase makes a fine
substitute pouch for an orphaned kangaroo.

I am drawn to such dramas of animal rescue.
They are warm in the throat. I suffer, the critic proclaims,
from an overabundance of maternal genes.

Bring me your fallen ﬂedgling, your bummer lamb,
lead the abused, the starvelings, into my barn.
Advise the hunted deer to leap into my corn.

And had there been a wild child—
ﬁlrlzy andﬁerce as a ferret, he is called
in one nineteenth-century account—

a wild child to love, it is safe to assume,
given my ﬁreside inked with paw prints,
there would have been room.

Think of the language we two, same and not-same,
might have constructed from sign,

scratch, grimace, grunt, vowel:

Laughter our ﬁrst noun, and our long verb, howl.

 




To Brother

There were mornings I'd awake in a basement.
It was hard times for me living beneath my folks.
My dog was there too.
We'd get up an hour after the birds.
He'd meet me at the top of the stairs

with three wags of the tail,

a two front paw hop up, a huff,

a smile, a one front paw hop up,

a back up single front paw lift,

a crouch back and a dash

once round the kitchen table,

then a still stand whimper,
two tail wag and a loud huff.
I'd open the door and out he'd dart.
His dance always made me smile.
A smile with a friend to soften some hard times.

George Liaskos

 




For Squiddy.

The Siamese sleeps

curled up around himself

like a fur covered seashell

tossed up on our shore

by the tides of chance.

Who knew he would be there

living in the woods sof Alabama,
stealing fish guts

from the garbage cans

like his cousin

the similar masked raccoon?
Aristocrat in the wild,

a begger prince,

choosing carefully even as he stole,
dainty paws belying the

brambles, fleas, and dirt in his fur.
”My ancestors were temple guards."
his blue eyes said.

”My ancestors were‘bred like royalty.”
We sc00ped him up in our arms

and brushed off the dry clay

til his fur was cleaned,

nursed him until

his azure eyes were cleared.

We tested a name,

he came

to stay with us.

He slept all the way to New York
safe in a milk crate cage.

Now he curls up on our sofa
dreaming, little seashell,

floating on the waves of an old pillow
and our love.

THE CAT’S DEATH

That night you called repeatedly,

A forlorn cry, as if I could never reach you.
You were alone already.

The pupils of your eyes grown wide and black
Stared past the border of the dark land.

At daybreak you died in my arms.

I carried you to the rainy mountain,

To a mossy tree whose roots cleft rock.

The mist that silvered my hair and your rich fur
Had been in store for us, Terra.

The leafy earth of the winter mountain

Had patiently waited our coming.

Then there were dreams.

Something of you came back to me from the mountain,
A bobcat, heavy with wild kittens —

No one else could touch you but you came to my hand.
In bewilderment I stroked the same brindled fur.

In the grey dawn I knew you.

Where I cro ch furred and wakeful

Tightening c ws in damp clay.

Within a fear huge the mountain is shaking
I don’t need to be fraid.

Old Dog

Toward the last in the morning she could not
get up, even when l rattled her pan.

I helped her into the yard, but she stumbled
and fell. I knew it was time.

The last night a mist drifted over the fields.

In the morning she would not raise her head—
the far, clear mountains we had walked

surged back to mind.

We looked a slow bargain: our days together
were the ones we had already had.

I gave her something the vet had given,

and patted her still, a good last friend.

How far riends are! They forget you,

it’s lonely in being far and a friend.

I put my han out—this chair, this table——

Call up a friend? 1] right, but the phone

She came out of the ﬁeld—low

where it rolled wide, our farm. She came

and up to the door. For greeting, I

held out my'hand. I felt the tongue touch
my palm, and a breath came: something
entering my whole life in a rush.

What came to me in trust no one

could take away. I knew

it was mine. Not father, even, or mother,
could end the new feeling: mine.

Now I belonged wherever dark

ﬂowed, from that night on,

anywhere, any touch that was kind.

[Poem]

ANOTHER DOG’S DEATH

By John Updike. From the January issue of the New
England Monthly. “Another Dog’s Death" also ap—
pears in a new collecn'on of Updike’s poetry, Facing
Nature, published this month by Knopf.

For days the good old bitch had been dying, her back

Pinched down to the spine and arched to ease the pain,
Her kidneys dry, her muzzle gray. At last

I took a shovel into the woods and dug her grave

In preparation for the certain. She came along,

Which I had not expeCted. Still. the children gone,
Such expeditions were rare, and the dog,

Spayed early, knew no nonhuman word for love.

So she made her stiff legs tror and let her bent tail wag.
We found a spat we liked, where the pines met the field.

The sun warmed her fur as she dozed and I dug;
Carving her a safe place while she guarded me.

I measured her length with the shovel's handle;

She perked in amusement, and sniffed the heaped earth.
Back down at the house, she seemed friskier,

But gagged, eating. We called the vet a few days later.

They were old friends. She held up a paw, and he

- Injected a violet fluid. She swooned on the lawn.
And we watched her breathing slowly ebb to naught.
In the wheelbarrow up to the hole. her fur took the sun.

 

 

 

34 ‘ HARPER'S I MARCH

 




The Attraction of Housecats

’I can hear the cat coming

from the moment her paws

begin to pad softly down the bare
wooden steps from the third floor.

-She leaps to the windowsill
without so much as a glance
in my direction, yawns once,
and curls up in a lazy
gold patch of sunlight
floating through the window.

An hour passes, the two of us
companions in silence.

When I look next, the cat is looking
back at me with half—closed eyes.

She stirs, stretches, approaches,
nuzzles my palm with her nose,

and sits back on her haunches
collecting affection

as if it were due without question,
the ears raised, the chest puffed out,
the forepaws placed just so.

A subtle shift

of posture, and then that
penetrating gaze, always unexpected,
the dark slits of the pupils,

for an instant, flaring,

intensity so pure and startling

one can almost feel a coldness
crossing the heart like a cloud.

Then in the twitch of a whisker,
the head cocks slightly;

the tail swishes the air

with animal grace,

and the cat turns,
and is gone.

 




In the Season of Possibilities

in the Real World

In spring I wander with my dog a1 ng a river,
and the river’s our own. No one else

hisper at the top of a willow.
pable river! Such handiwork,
plicit, high technology!
am still a small creek of a girl
ing beside it, for all my years.

The Comet at Equinox

Last night, because there were stars,

I woke at four, entered the sub'freezing
weather with my dog, and drove

to the mountain with cold hands.

They stood already there, the man,

the woman, the boy, gazing at the sky

for the chance of a lifetime.

A tall stranger who spoke like

an engineer scanned the dark beside them.
He told us where to start, the three electric
lights on the horizon, at what angle

to proceed upward to the trapezoid

of stars that pointed the eye down again
to where the comet blurred. My dog
meanwhile, engrossed in earthly smells,
nuzzled each hand that hung down, waiting
its turn at binoculars. The comet

had a tail that first night of spring,

visible to the naked eye. And so our small
human group stood an hour on the mountain
between two tails: the friendly one
wagging close to us on earth, and

that faint one, more like a memory,
holding our eyes on the sky.

 




DIALOG WITH THE DOGCATCHER

I say son

Everything cold can teach, they learn.
