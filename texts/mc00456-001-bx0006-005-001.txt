EIGHTY-FIRST

ANNUAL REPORT

OF THE COMMITTEE
For the Year ended 37st December, 7943

 

The Committee has pleasure in submitting the Report and
Accounts, together with the reports of Inspectors Hillyer and
Bacon, for the year 1943.

Two hundred and eighty-five Complaints were received
and investigated during the year, one hundred and sixteen
verbal Cautions were given by the Inspectors, two written
Monitions were given by Headquarters and nine persons were
taken before the Magistrates and convicted in respect of the
following offences :—

Horses.——Working in an unfit state... '2
Dogs. —— Omitting to provide sufficient nourishing food,
care and attention . .. ll
Causing unnecessary suffering, omitting to provide
proper care and attention 1
Pigs. —— Causing unnecessary suffering, omitting to provide
proper care and attention 2
/
Rabbits.——Omitting to provide sufficient nourishing food,
care and attention 2
18

We are pleased to report that the Inspectors have again
performed their duties in their usual efficient and tactful manner

despite the continuance of wartime difficulties, one of which'

being that Inspector Bacon has to devote half his time to per—
forming duty in the area of the Stockport Branch.
. Cats’ Shelters.

The total number of cats destroyed at the four Shelters
was 19,238, this being an increase of 4,019 compared with the

 




 

 

 

3

previous year. In addition, 146 dogs were also destroyed, in
most cases owing to severe injuries sustained on the road.

0

The Committee desires to express appreciation of the way
in which Mr. and Mrs. Oxton, Miss Hoyle, Mrs. Ashworth and
Mrs. Graystock have carried out their unpleasant but most
necessary and humane tasks. '7

The boarding of cats continued during the past year, the
number being 989. -

CLINIC.

The records of the Clinic reveal a very successful year in
the treatment and, where necessary, the painless destruction of
animals and birds. Any of our Subscribers, who would like to
pay a visit of inspection, is cordially invited to come to 265,
Eccles New Road, Salford, between 3 and 4 pm. on a Wednesday
or 4—30 and 5-30 pm. on a Saturday. The number of patients
treated by our Veterinary Surgeon, Mr. A. E. Proctor, M.R.C.V.S.,
during the year was 642, whilst the treatments given totalled
1,074. We are most grateful to Mrs. Caplan and Mr. Bowkett
for their valuable help in attending to perform the necessary
clerical work. '

Russian Army Horses.

Two special efforts in aid of the Society’s fund for the provi—
sion of veterinary requirements for the enormous number of
horses employed by the Russian Army were made in 1943. For
one week in January and two weeks in February the amount
collected in the window boxes at the Branch Office and the
Clinic was allocated to this fund. Appropriate exhibits were
placed in the windows and attracted considerable attention.
The amount so collected, together with special donations, was
£15 155. 11d. A greater effort was made in November when, as
the result of a very successful “ Sale of Goods,” the substantial
sum of £1 1 was realised. This effort was arranged by the
ladies of the Cats’ Shelters Sub~Committee and their friends,
and the greatest credit is due to them in achieving so satisfactory
a result.

Finance.

The Committee have once again to express their thanks to
the Lady Collectors and Box Holders upon whose efforts the work
in the Branch so much depends. There are, however, districts
where we have no Lady Collectors, Davyhulme, Irlam, Cadishead,
Worsley and Walkden for example, and offers of assistance in
those localities would be very welcome. ‘

 

 




 

4 ,
INSPECTOR’S ANNUAL REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1943.

T0 the Secretary and M embers of the Committee.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

I beg to report that during the year ending Slst December,
1943, 6 cases of cruelty were reported, with the result that 4
Convictions were obtained and 2 Monitions were sent from
Headquarters. 195 Complaints were received and investigated,
resulting in 79 verbal Cautions being given and advice given as
to the better treatment of the animals concerned.

55 animals were destroyed, all of which were in a suffering
state. Of this number I destroyed 48. The majority of these
were destroyed at the owners’ request, being either ill and old,
or having been injured on the roads.

The roads in my district have been regularly patrolled,
railway sidings, loading ways at the warehouses and depart—
mental stores and all places, where horses are used, have been
visited and observations have been kept for any ill-usage of
animals.

I have paid regular visits to shops where puppies, birds,
rabbits, cavies and other livestock have been on show for
sale and the animals have been inspected and also their

accommodation.

A Departmental Store in Town was visited during the
Christmas Season, where a miniature Zoo was on show for the
children.

The Annual Circus was visited at Belle Vue and theatres
where animals were used in the performance, such animals and
their accommodation being inspected.

The outlying parts of my district have been visited during
the winter months and observations have been kept on animals
turned out to grass. ‘

I have also kept observations on the canal towing paths
and inspected barge horses and their stable accommodation.

 

 

 




 

 

5

In conclusion, I wish to thank the Chief Constable of
Manchester, the Superintendent of the Manchester Division of
the Lancashire County Constabulary and the members of both
Forces and also members of the public for the assistance they
have rendered to me in the performance of my duties.

I have the honour to remain,
Your obedient servant,

LAWRENCE HILLYER.

during the year ended Blst December, 1943. .

Your obedient servant,
ALTIE W. BACON.
