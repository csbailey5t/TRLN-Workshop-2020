Death by Torture. That is the fate
of hundreds in this country every day.
Hundreds of the helpless creatures '
that are experimented on in labora-
tories and by students wherever op- .1
portunity affords. If you saw a bunch
of boys, girls also, dissecting a living
animal on the street, you would rush ‘
to the animal’s rescue, you would call
police and in righteous Wrath demand
that the offenders. be punished. Do you
know that sort 0f thing is going on. 1

‘dren are being encouraged to engage
in experiments on dogs, cats, rats, mice
and other helpless creatures? I assure 2

Animal Experimentation
Reduces Human Suffering

Editor of the Press Herald:

The letter of Mrs. Harold C Gain
leaves me greatly disturbed. She and
the sponsors of the bill for the pre-
vention of cruelty to animals are in
:fact supporting a measure to protect
lanimal lives at the expense of human
lives. Human suffering caused by such
jthr‘ngs as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis,
leukemia, cystic fibrosis, and muscular
l dystrophy, should not be placed second
to the suffering they claim is caused
by the experimental methods imposed
upon animals in the research labora-
tory

If Dr. Jonas Salk were deprived of

the use of the rhesus monkey in his 1
research leading to the discovery of
the Salk vaccine I wonder how many
needless polio deaths and cripplings
we would have this year?
‘ Polio protection would not be pos-
‘ sible if this bill had been in effect ten
lyears ago. The hopes of thousands,
gsuffering - from cancer, would be
dashed if the bill should pass.

Citizens should weigh the evidence
carefully and objectively. The obiective
evidence supporting the defeat of the
bill is very real to most of us. It comes
in the form of small pox vaccine, Salk
vaccine, diphtheria toxoid, tetanus
toxoid, and the fight against vitamin
deficiency. These are just a few medical
milestones that could not have been
achieved if animals for experimenta-
tion were banned from use.

surgery and instead of being killed afterwards are
left to die a painful death. ~~

This bill would not interfere with bona ﬁde
research but would provide for its being done under '.
humane conditions.

As there IS a good deal of opposition to the bill;
letters and telegrams of support should be sent
immediately to your senators and congressmen, to

the US. Senate Committee on Labor and Public

\Velfare, and to the House of Representatives Com-
mittee on Interstate and FOreign Commerce.

l ‘ Letters: HumaneBlll Supported

To the Editor. All humanitarians in this
area ought. to be alerted to a bill being in
troduced by Senator John Sherman Cooper
of Kentucky, designed to prevent unneces~

l stitutions receiving federal grants, and in
l agencies of the U. S. Government. It has
the support of a few liberals in Congress
but needs wide public backing. It is S. 3570.

Conditions are incredible, and we have
never‘y legally enforced humane treatment,
as the British Government has. Unclean
quarters, lack of veterinary care which
1 causes epidemics of virus disease, mange,
l fleas and worms; sick and healthy animals
left unsegregated; dead animals not
promptly removed; callous mishandling;
, malnutrition sometimes causing death from
thirst-these are some of the conditions.
Animals are often kept' in cages so small as
l to prevent them standing erect; for seven

 

years animals are housed in metal mesh
l cages so small they can exercise only by
1 spinning in a cirCle. They have to sleep on

this metal mesh; there is poor ventilation
and inadequate temperature control.

This is one of the greatest shaman of.
our society. The normal mind balks at
13110118“, Of- what men accept, in experiment,-
lng with living flesh. Adequate use is not.
always made. of anesthesia; sedation is
virtually never used to alleviate post-or»
crative suffering, severe pain is inflicted

 

\ I . . I

sary cruelty to animals in research in»

without the. benefit of anesthetic; animals
are not killed at the end of an experiment,
though suffering severely; they are left
to die; those who survive are “used again”;
one dog may undergo up to nine painful
surgical operations performed by students;
experiments involving infliction of severe
pain are undertaken by insufficienlty quali
fled students, and are often designed with
out regard to suffering.

These are all facts, assembled by those
supporting the bill. Are we all savages,
a species below the beast, to tolerate such
cruelty? Other countries safeguard against

it. If this is done in the name of “human
betterment and scientific progress,” then
it were better that all of us suffer untold
agony and no discovery relieve human woe ;_
for to benefit at the exrpense of such in-
conceivably vast and terrible pain is no
benefit at all, but the foulest crime against
God and man and a curse that will blacke
our conscience for generations to cor?”
We must stop it without delay; we pro
to be moral and ethical people; am
claim the name of religion; moreove
rest. of, the. civilized world, many 11
of which have passed beyond thi
barity are watching us and they wi
judgment.

Cruelty To Animals

Editor of the Press Herald:

Death by Torture. That is the fate

‘ of hundreds in this country every day.
QI-Iundreds of the helpless creatures

that are experimented on in labora-
tories and by students wherever op—
portunity affords. If you saw “,a bunch
of boys, girls also,.dissecting a living :
animal on the street, you would rush

to the animal’s reScue, you would call
police and in righteous wrath demand: 3
that the offenders be punished. Do you
know. that sort of thing is going on
every day in many schools, that chil-
dren are being encouraged to engage
in experiments on ‘dogs, cats, rats, mice
and other helpless creatures? I assure ,
you it is true. If you wish verification
of this claim write to Society for
Animal Protective Legislation, 745 Fifth

'Avenue, 6th Floor, New York 22, N. Y.

Will.you help stop thisabuse? Then
write to the Hon. John Sherman Coop-
er, sponsor of a bill to prevent cruelty
to animals, and tell him how you feel.
Write also to the following senators,
co—sponsors of the bill, tell .them you:

‘ want it to pass. Write also to our own
: senators. These are the :co-sponsors:

Senators E..L.'Bart1ett, Robert C. Byrd,
Joseph 1 S. Clark, Ernest Gruening,
Estes Kefauver, Mike Mansfield, Pat).
McNamara,. Wayne Morse, William
Proxmire, Jennings Randolph, Harri-
son Williams.

If this bill passes, no more will:
animals be used far experimentation,
then left to die in torment, their
wounds open and infected “and often
their vital organs hanging out (Oh this
is not pretty reading, but if we do not
read then we cannot know nor help.)
Dead and dying dogs are drenched

- with cold water as they lie in the same

already sick, how about you? Will ydu .

spent by the Fiscal Court to renovate

none fdea‘lt with this subject. Instead new
sidewalks for children Walking to school,
, . widening of County roads, purchase of

rights of way, proper distribution of wel~ '

fare between city and county and a num-
ber of other emotiOnal or “glittering
generality” subjects were mentioned.
Now we find that one of the first things
to be done is to renOvate the Armory
at a cost of at least $650, 000.

Who benefits by such a plan? I fail
to see how the Well known “chicken

farmer from Fishersville” or the aver- -

age citizen of the city or county will
benefit Could it be that Certain dOWn-
town interests have applied political
pressure for the good of a few? Maybe a
better plan would be: to tear doWn the
Armory and use the site for a much-

  

‘1‘"‘5R

3‘7; :EFreedom Hall to use fer conventiOns and

other activities. Why spend county.

money to duplicate facilities?

" Couldn’t the $650, 000 be used to better
advantage to make an initial payment
for a county share in the Louisville Water
W'orks‘? This would insure the extension
(if needed water to the county. After all,
the population in the county is increas-

ing and will continue to increase while '

that of the city, barring annexation, will
remain relatively constant. With such a

Ecuador’s Election '

I knew Drew Pearson’s sin-
cere interest for promoting
better Understanding between
the United States and the sis-
ter Republics of Latin Amer-
ica
. I know that he is aware of
the serious threats that democ~
racy as a Whole is facing in
Latin America as a- direct con-
sequence of the underdevelop-
ment Which ,is the cause of
poverty, malnutrition and dis-
'ease.

I know that Mr. Pearson is
deeply aware that Ecuador,
my Country, is following a
very remarkable and outstand-
ing democratic process and-
everybody realizes that the
last presidential elections that
took place 13 Ecuador on June
5 are the m st tangible demon-
stration of the political matur-
ity of Ecuador. _

The overwhelming victory
of one candidate, Dr. Velasco
Ibarra and the defeat of the
other three candidates, Mr.
Cordero Crespo, Mr. .-Galo
\Plaza and Dr. AntOnio Parra
did not have any relation with
the sentiments or friendliness
towards the United States of
America. The Ecuadorians in
electing Itheir President used
to think ﬁrst in the national

' - interest of the country and sec-
ondly in the Welfare of the ,

hemisphere.
. I felt obliged to send this
letter after reading Mr. Pear-
son’s June 27 article entitled
“Ike Addresses Humiliate'd
Nation.” I have to say that I
cannot share his opinion that
Mr. Galo Plazagtborn and edu-
cated in the nited States,
“was defeated for President
largely because he too was
friendly to the United States.”

_ . HumanityFor
Laboratory Animals

Addressed , to William Loeb: Senator
Cooperwof Kentucky, with 11 supportingco-
,sponsors, has introduced a bill into the
Senate to insure that laboratory animals
used in experiments supported by gov-
ernment grants, be given humane. treat-
ment and care. This entails 80 per cent
of all. animals used." A similar billwas in-
troduced into the House by Rep. Martha
Grifﬁth of Michigan. ‘ . i

TheAnimal Care Panel of the National
Society for Medical Research is violently
opposed to such legislation, therefore
proving how far they now fall ,short'of
humane standards, or such regulatiOn
would be meaningless to them.

Not all laboratories are inhumane, of
course. I myself have visited about 18~ of
the biggest. While outright cruelty is far
less than the general public believes, the
inhumane practice of conﬁning dogs in
cages too small for them to even stretch

,out in, simetimes for’years on end, is a
rule rather than the exception. And, o‘ccae
sionally, there are insufferable. cruelties
which the. taxpayers, should not tolerate
when they foot: the bill. . |

There have been many ﬁne editorials
about this in the? last month. I enclose a
sample. Won’t you raise the voice of the

' NEW HAMPSHIRE SUNDAY NEWS and
the MANCHESTER UNION LEADER in
an editorial urging peopleto let their views

To the Editor: There is a fine bill.
before the Senate which will do much to
alleviate the suffering of laboratdry ani-
mals. This bill was introduced by John
Sherman Cooper, of Kentucky, and is
Senate Bill 8-3570. Over 250 dogs are
penned in the sub-baseman of the Food
and Drug Admi istration Building in
Washington, DC. ey are never given
fresh air or exercise. These dogs can be
helped if S-3570 is passed. .

I personally enter into this in memory
of my own beloved dog, Butch, which
passed on January 23 this year and I
hope that I can help. I know that others
would like to help these dogs so I write
this letter. Write at once to your Sen-
ators, Senate Office Building, Washing-

Laboratory Animals Bill 8-3570. For fur-
ther particulars you can write to George

. Possible Steps

A St. Joseph woman who op-
poses vivisection has sent to
The News-Palladium copies of
two recent Washington, D. C.,
neWSpaper editorials regarding
animal research. Vivisection is
the practice of subjecting living
animals to cutting operations in
the interest of research. '

Mrs. Vera Betts, 703 Lake bou-
levard, writes that local high
school students told her of “cruel,
vivisection (without anesthetic) '
of frogs and cats in biologyi
classes.” ‘

One editorial urges standardsi
to see that experimental animals3
suffer as little pain as possible}
and that standards are enforced.
to see that sadism is not con-
fused with science. The other
editorial supports a proposed bill?
which it~says “steers a sensible;Z
middle course between the ex-.5
tremes of those who would avoid;
any scrutiny of their experi-g-
mentation and those who would;
abolish entirely the use of ani-'
mals in laboratories to save hu-:
man lives. i

Mrs. Betts, who writes that .3"
she would prefer to abolish Vivi-"f
section, said the Society for Ani-t‘
mal Protective Legislation, New
York, N. Y;,’suggested the cop-e
ies be submitted to local news-

“Man Bites Dog” is the dream headline of newspaper

equally surprising bit of news, one we are glad to chronic e,

' h con ratulations.
Wit Robirt Grundy, Joseph Strassner and lack. Greenman had
bought 85 acres in Smithtown for a subdrvrsron. Then they
read an editorial in Newsday calling for more parks on Long
Island. They decided to build their homes on half—acre instead .
of one-acre lots, and to donate 36 woodland acres, potentially
worth $180,000, to Smithtown for a park. .

This is a wonderful example of civic Spirit, one in part
inspired by Norman Blankman’s planning for the former
C. V. Whitney Estate in Old W estbury, where houses Will be
concentrated to preserve the maximum green space, although
not as a public park. However it is done, we .favor saying .
Long Island trees and Long Island meadows, in particular
those on the Marshall Field estate, which the state wants to
buy. May the example set in Smithtown be widely c0p1ed!

dent to reduce the sum paid Cuba annually for its sugar, in
effecta subsidy. Castro threatens to seize. all American hold—
ings if it passes. It must pass; we cannot let ourselves be black-
mailed. If this means that Cuba will move still closer to the
Communist orbit—well, the evidence is plain that we can’t-
buy7 her oﬂf, and that Castro is determined not to change his
headlong course. ' ‘

Our best and only'answer is to reduce our trade with

' Cuba to the point where we buy only what we need, or can’t '
- get elsewhere for the same price; and therewith to build up our

trade (and aid) with other Latin—American countries which

‘ now are on our side. Coincidentally, and with the utmost tact,

we should encourage the Organization of American States to
take 'a good, hard look at the Cuban situation and to express
its frank opinions. These, when ielled, are not likely to make
Castro any happier. '

Congress in Recess

Whatever the occult reasons involved, it’s good that Con-
gress will recess during the political conventions and return
in August to consider a vast amount of important legislation
on which no action has been taken. This is a good deal better
than the usual wheeling, dealing, headlong rush to jam bills
through on a deadline, as has hereto-fore happened.

If, as seems possible, the Dems pick Kennedy and (as
seems certain) the Republicans ”pick Nixon, the net result
will be tough on the two nominees. Whichever man is elected
will have earned it. ,

This in a sense will be a conCealed blessing for the voters:
They won’t be hearing much from the nominees until Congress

.adjourns, which shortens the campaign season, and for the ﬁrst

timethey’ll have ample time to take a good, long look at the
platforms. These documents, usually pious platitudes, will this
time need to be mighty speciﬁc, and the parties will have to
put up quite a ﬁght for them.

Speaking of blessings, isn’t it dandy that former Presi-
dent Truman has decided not to be a delegate to the Demo-

cratic convention? That should at least cut down on some
unneeded oratory. i 0

To the Editor:

One of our correspondents sent
us the clipping £10m the Patent
Trader in which you reprinted the
fine editorial in support of the
Cooper bill for the humane treat-
ment of experimental animals
from the Washington Post.

We Wish to express our grateful
appreciation for this valuable
support and hope that many of
your readers will write to their
senators and representatives ex-
pressing their Wish to have this
much needed humane bill enacted
into law at the earliest possible
time.

Three companion bills to the
Cooper bill have been introduced
in the House of Representatives
by Representatives Martha Grif-
fiths of Michigan, Cleveland M.
Bailey of West Virginia and James

Thomas Paine

Needed Today

To the Editor:

John Adams, who was one of
the leading actors in the American
Revolution, said that “without the
pen of Paine, the sword of Wash-
ington would have been wielded in
vain.” And General vonSteuben
said, during the most critical

‘ period of the Revolutionary War,

that “a pamphlet by Thomas

‘ Paine would have a better effect

upon the country than all the res
olutions of Congress in prose and
verse.’ .

I believe it is beneath the dig-
nity of our country to further tol-
erate these insults; and I feel
sure that if Thomas Paine were
alive today, he would suggest that
We break off diplomatic relations
with the Soviet Union because of
the guttersnipe conduct of Nikita
Khrushchev. How appropriately do
these words of Paine apply to
Khrushchev: “To argue with a
man who has renounced the use
and authority of reason, and whose
philosophy consists in holding hu-
manity in contempt, is like ad'
ministering me dicine to the
dead.

 

If Russia is determined to pro-
voke a conflict, then, as Thomas
Paine again so truly said: . . let

 

it be in my day so that my chit-1

_ dren may have peace.” Because,

as Paine so eloquently expresses
it, “Those who expect to reap the
blessings of freedom must, like
men, undergo the fatigues of sup-
porting it.”

Finally, I am constrained to
conclude with this quotation from
Thomas Paine: “The cause of
America is, in a great measure,
the cause of all mankind.”

Oh! for another Thomas Paine.

Spirit Of Law
Seen Violated

To the Editor:

In your Sunday, July 17, and
Thursday, July 21, issues, I saw
a classified advertisement under
Domestic Help Wanted that began
with the words, “Chauffeur, white."
Before writing this letter, I called
the New York State Employment
Office and the New York State
Committee Against Discrimination,
both in White Plains. From the lat-
ter, I learned that domestic em-
ployment along with private club
employment and employment in
firms employing fewer than six
persons were especially exempt
from the provisions of theNewYork
State anti-discrimination employ-
ment law. However, the repre-
sentative of the Committee Against
Discrimination agrees with me that
such an advertisement violates the
spirit if not the letter of the law.

Repudiation Asked

Because of my general impres- ,_
sion of your editorial policy, and
because of the specific opinion of
your excellent columnist, Mr. Gil
S. Joel, I feel that you do yourself
a disservice as a newspaper to
carry such advertising. At a time
when both national parties have
taken strong positions on civil
rights, I feel that a repudiation
of such advertising by your paper
would be welcomed. Further, I feel
that the national as opposed to a
sectional emphasis on civil rights
by the responsible political leaders
calls on all like-minded citizens and
organizations to stand behind what
should be a bi-partisan movement.

May I say in conclusion that I
realize that the incident at hand is
a small one and not nearly so
important as discrimination in pub—
lic housing or in government con-
tract labor. However, I feel that
the economically and socially de-
bilitating institution of discrimina-
tion should be vigorously opposed
in its practice, however small, by
all who recognize the danger and
work for its irradication.

They Save Lives

Editor, Nevada State Journal:
Millions of animals are used
every year for scientific experi-
ments in the laboratories of
America. Countless human lives
have been saved by the knowl-
edge gleaned from these adven-

tures. Those who rejoice in the,

miracle of modern science could
do so with truly full heart if they
could be assured that the ani~
mals used for experimentation
have not suffered unneeded pain
in the process. No such assur-
ance has been possible up to the
present. Now it is offered,
large degree, if Congress can be
persuaded to pass a bill intro-
duced by Senator John Sherman
Cooper of Kentucky and 11 other
senators. This bill is officially
known as 8.3570.

On June 9 the Hon Martha

in Congress, which provides
for humane treatment of

ernment and by recipients
of grants from the Governe

there are many other ex.

not to interfere with scien—

Mr. Neal W Phillips:

Dear Mr. Phillips:

May the enclosed be in your
Meredith News and ' Sandwich
News. Thanks so much.

Sincerely,

. Marion P. Howard
Dear Readers: ' ,
A bill is before the Senate in-

. troduced by the Hon. John Sher-

man Cooper of Kentucky to pro‘
vide that all animals being used
for research work have humane
treatment in laboratories.

Some research institutions do
treat animals humanely --- others

do not. Bill 83570 is ‘designed for
~ persons and labs to obtain a cer- .
tificate and be under inspection

by the Department of Health, Ed-
ucation and Welfare. If not up
to :humane standards their certif-
icate would be suspended.
Senators Robert C. Byrd, Estes

_Kefauver, Wayne Morse and

eleven other Senators are co-spon-
sors with Senator Cooper.
A few of the inhumane condit-

.’. ' -—r~r““‘“‘—_
l ,

 

ions and treatments are lack of
space, lack of a resting place, ani-
mals forced to sleep on metal
mesh, no temperature controls,
animals not always killed at term-
ination of experiments, no veter-
inary care when epidemics of vir-

«us disease start, or mange, fleas

and worms, dead animals not al-
ways promptly remfoved. These are
a few of the horrors. Write your
senators to pass Bill ~8-3570.

For your information, the state
of Kansas passed a law prohibit-
ing pulling contests by horses and

oxen and have tractor pulling en-
tered in Fairs instead of this in- g;
human sport. Why cannot New
Hampshire rise to this standard 1;”,

also?

quarrel with your state-
ment that “Man owes ani-

gratitude: for their affec-
tion and their aid in over-
coming pain and, disease,"
I must protest against the

ly, there would” ”be reason
to prelim But it is not.

tized and protected by
laws governing their use.”

The truth is that some
experimental animals are
cruelly treated and that
others are not; that some
experimental animals are
anesthetized and others

1 are not. The choice is not
between the life of a man
and a life of an animal but
between human decency
in the treatment of eX-
perimental animals and
the callousness and indif—
feience to whiCh animals
without number have
been and are being sub-
jected in laboratories
throughout our nation.

 

I have personally obs,“
served this callousness '
and its results in scientiﬁc
institutions from New
York to California and in-
cluding both these states.

Backs Couper Bill

Dear Sir:

The article on laboratory animals and the
Sherman Cooper bill, written by Caroline
Stone, were no doubt read with interest by
lovers of animals. This bill deserves. the
backing of the public and letters to our men
in Washington. I wasn’t aware of cruelty
to animals in research laboratories nOr in
any Schools, at least not in this vicinity; but
apparently it, has happened even in schools
in some areas where live animals are used
for. experimentation and vivisection. _I read
an article in one of the Sunday papers writ-
ten by' Ruth McCloud, who was concerned
about this matter, this being the first time I
read about this problem and the concern for
it. She described the c1uelty inflicted upon
a small, helpless animal when dissecting it
in a classroom and wondered what sort or
psychological effects will this sort of thing
have on a developing child.

She also writes the following, “Prof. James
Mehorter believes that if schools allow ex-
perimentation on live animals in the class-
room, it will contribute to the mounting in-

 

. cidence of mental illness in your young chil-

dren.”

Psychologists tell us that if a child is con-
tinually cruel to an animal he is not right
and ought to be treated as soon as this is
noticed. What about the adults, if he prac-
tices unnecessary cruelty to small, help-less
animals that he uses in his work in research
centers or in a classroom in the presence or.
adolescent pupils?

May I also add that the article “CDL Urg-
ing Support of Senate Bill, ” in the Aug. 10
Mining Journal deserves our careful study
and then see what we can do as individuals
or as a group in this matter, as suggested

 

by the writing. We are grateful to the Mar-

quette CDL for keeping us well-informed in

their line. of work.

I Asks Support For

Humane Treatment

Of Experimental Animals
745 Fifth Avenue,
New York 22, N. .Y
August 9 1960
Editor, The Long- Islander
Dear Sir:
Editorial support of the Cooper
bill for the humane treatment of
experimental animals is most deep-

ly appreciated. The bill is urgently
needed to stop completely unnec-

essary abuse and neglect of these
animals which is as detrimental to
scientific work for which they are
use-d as’it is to the animals them-
selves suffering needlessly as they
do all too often.

Last week I visited a laboratory
where ticks, mites and black bee-
tles were thickly infesting the un-
fortunate animal subjects and their
quarters. Tens of thousands of dol-
lars of federal tax funds had been
granted to this laboratory for ani-
mal experiments by the National
Institutes of Health. Why cannot

decent standards be maintained in

' Cooper

the care and treatment of animals
which have been purchased with
the tax-payers’ vmoney? If the
bill were law, humane
standards enforced by federal in.-
spectors would prevent needless
suffering and waste. I .
We hope you will continue to
support this measure actively, for
ant-i-vivisectionists and medical re-
search extremists am doing their
utmost to‘kill'it. Your supportand

that of all. geod citizensism’dch

needed.

\
1/ The new issue of the Bulle-
tin of the National Society for
Medical Research is devoted to,
violent opposition to the Cooper
Bill for the humane treatment
of experimental animals. .

The tone of the oppOsition is,
set in. the editorial, ‘which
‘states, in part: .in the care
’of animals in laboratories, a:
corps of official snoopers might-
Quncover an occasional instance
of brutality, but would it justi-
fy the expense? Would it com-
pensate for the insult to the-
humaneness of the vast major-
,ity of students," teachers and in-
.i.v vestigators?”

. The NSMR account of the
bill, its . sponsors, develop-
ment and intent is riddled with
false statements from begin-
ning to end. But just aslfalSe
statements about the bill by the
"National 'Anti-Vivisection So-.

With considerable dis-
gust-I read about the won»
an‘ who ' Was given a
choice of paying $150 ﬁne,
serving 30 days in jail or
picking‘up tin cans for a
mile. along the road. It

\ seems this woman did a

l horrible thing—she threw
\ one can out of a car win-
1 dow.

j ; For that she had a choice
of ' going into debt, going
Crazy in cenﬁnement if
she is subject to c1aus‘tro—-
phobia; or, possibly, if she‘
. has any back trouble, in—
juring her back seriously
by stopping over a couple
of thousand times.

It seems to me any of
these is pretty tough pun-
ishment just for littering
up a landscape. Just whom
did this woman actually
hurt?

I’ve known of less severe
punishment for wife beat-
i n g, drunken driving,
speeding,”reck1ess driving
and gang ﬁghting.

I hope no one comes up
before this judge for
throwing two tin' cans. No
doubt the culprit would be
sent to the gas chamber.

Generalization

Your editorial of July 19
has been forwarded to me
and while I would not
quarrel with your state-
ment that “Man owes ani-
mals a double debt of
gratitude: for their affec-
tion and their aid in over«
coming pain and disease,”
I must protest against the
enormous generalization .
you make when you state:

“If such experimentm
tion were conducted cruel-

ly, there would be reason

to protest. But it is not.
The animals are anesthea
tized and protected by
laws governing their use.”

The truth is that some
experimental animals are
cruelly treated and that
others are-not; that some
experimental animals are
anesthetized and others
are not. The choice is not
between the life of a man
andga life of an animal but
between human decency
in the treatment. of ex-
perimental animals and

the callousness and indif-

ference to Which animals
without 11' u m b e r have

been and are being sub-g,

jected in laboratories
throughout our nation.

I have personally ob-
served this callousness
and its results in scientiﬁc

institutions , 1' r o m- New .

deplorable conditions "in the research

stated. ‘

Insanitary conditions: Caretakers do
not keep quarters clean. No. veterinary
care is provided; sick and healthy ani-
mals are not ”segregated, dead animals
are not removed; no post-operative
care. Attendants hose down small cages
without removing gm; thus sick
dogs are drenched with cold water;
feeding and watering so irregular that
animals die of thirst.

Lack Of space: Animals are kept in
cages so small that they cannot stand
erect or stretch out "and have no exer»
cise; animals are forcedto sleep on

wire mesh without resting boards or

bedding, or sometimes cold metal or

" den concrete floors are beds for
animals.

.3; 1;. ;;- Laboratory Animals
‘20 this CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR:

 

The Monitor is to be congratulated for
its, reprint of the Washington Post editorial
and the ensuing reader comment on the

‘1 welfare of laboratory animals as contained

in the Cooper bill now before “Congress.
However, a statement in a recent letter
denying any similarity between the Cooper
bill and the infamous Metcalf— Hatch Act
in New York State, was a half- truth, mis-
leading by omission

Even a brief scanning of the Metcalf-
Hatch law indicates that it is not merelyr
a law forcing humane societies tO sur-
render animals to laboratories; it contains
deceitfully impressive provisions for the
humane treatment of the animals. The
Commissioner of Health of the state is
directed to prescribe rules under which
approvals for experimentation on live
animals shall be granted, and said com-
mis oner may 1efuse or revoke such ap-
pr0&7al where the law is being violated;
alsb performance of animal expeIimenta-
ti0n without an ofﬁcial approval consti-
tutes a misdemeanor under this law,

Passage of the Metcalf—Hatch Act in

.1952 was favored by many persons who

mistakenly thought that laboratory
animals would have some protection at
last. TO date, however, this law has only
succeeded in anesthetizing thepublic con—
science; there has been no information
available to the public that an approval
has ,ever'been refused or rekaed, nor any
prosecution undertaken for experimenting
without an ofﬁcial approval. The same
silence still prevails, even with this law
on the statute books

The Cooper bill and the Metcalf— Hatch
Act are identical inthat both leave en-
forcement up to medical research itself——

the Secretary of Health, Education, and

Welfare, which necessarily means the
National Institutes of Health, and the
State Commissioner of Health. Thus en-
actment of the Cooper bill will forever
close the doors to any outside efforts to
protect laboratory animals. ,

Initiative in Disarmament
TO THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR: 1
Recent events in Asia suggest not as

,0 our cold warriors would have (it that our

military, strength 'is too weak but rather

 

 

that militarism as a policy is morally and
pragmatically bankrupt. While it is true
that Communists helped inspire the Tokyo

2 riots. they did not manufacture Japanese
‘pacifism. We, although there is little rec-

ognition of the fact lately, did this.
It was our government which gave the

Japanese people the only actual experi-
'ence with atomic destruction the world

has known. It was our government which,
in a moment of long-repressed idealism,
had the Japanese renounce militarism in
their constitution. Many of the students
who rioted this week learned about the
evil of war in schools run by Americans
during the occupation of Japan. We can—'
not expect these people tO leap grate-U
fully to arms once again at our behest
unless we support the very forces in Jap-
anese society which made for militarism
prior to 1945.,

The issue goes deeper than this, how-

irrever. Our world policy is dominated by

{the military mind. Each aggressive act on
both sides of the cold war leads to an act
10f aggression in retaliation. We violate

”.3301

1.);

The Reader Writes ‘

Russian air space with a U-2 plane and

Khrushchev wrecks the Paris Confer- -

ence. The militarists and cold warriors

on both sides are reinforced. Peace ad?

vocates on both sides are quieted. We
must somehow break free from this dead-
1y dialectic. .
A beginning Would be made if we
ceased to think of the world in black and
white terms. Certainly, one does not need
to be a sympathizer with Communist to-
talitarianism to realize the absurdity of
President Eisenhower’s recent praise for
freedom and justice on Chiang’s Formosa
dictatorship. Some of our other allies,
such as Spain and Korea, are in no sense
democracies. All evil is not on one side,
nor does all justice reside on the other.

The arms race, which both stiﬂes social
reform at home and is heading mankind
toward a nuclear holocaust, can be
stopped. We must show our willingness to
disarm and place the competition with
Russia on the economic and social level.
We should have conﬁdence in America’s
peace power, and only scorn for a pros-
perity based on armaments. We must
make more of an effort for a nuclear test
agreement and other disarmament treaties.
We should take the initiative in disarma-
ment; and encourage, instead of discour~
age as with the U-2, any Soviet tendencies
for peace.

We mUst realize that militarism is no
longer a rational alternative in an cm
of atomic weapons. In the long run, a
Japan neutral like India and Yugoslavia
is much more in our’ 5 and humanity’s in-
terest, than an armed Japan exacerbating
the cold war.

Rights Of the Individual
To THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR:

We hear a good deal about Russia’s
Iron Curtain; and how the “Voice of,

. America” tries to get the truth about-

America OVer to the unfortunate people
behind it. But how many of us realize
that we have an Iron Curtain right here
in America?

Some of our men in Washington have
advocated what they call “the people’s

‘ right to know.”

One of our local radio stations puts on a
public interest program called “What’s
Your Opinion?” I have written many let—
ters to this program; and all of them have
been read except the ones condemning the
ﬂuoridating of our drinking water. None
of these have been heard.

This issue is being put on the November
ballot, after we defeated it in 1954. We
have a Self-appOInted “Committee of
Fifty,” organized for what they tell us
is the good of the community. They are
the ones who are Working for ﬂuoridation.

I am interested in this issiie only from

‘the standpoint of the constitutional right

of the individual to choose his own
method Of treatment.

The United States Health, Education,

and Welfare Department tells us that the
householder does not own the water that
he pays taxes on and uses in the many
rounds Of his everyday life. Do the fluori-
dation interests own it?
. At least three provisions of Our Consti-
tution and Bill of Rights would have to
be eliminated before ﬂuoridation could be
legal. ANNA' PARKS

Congress Bill S. 3570
To THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR:

The issue of the Menitor of July .29
containing the letter on the Cooper bill
reached me a few hours after I had ad,»
dressed a protest meeting in London
(organized by the Animal Defense Sav-
ciety) against that bill.

Air Chief Marshal Lord DOwd'ing pin-Q
sided, and the speakers drawn from E1;-
rope represented most of the leading ani-v
mal welfare societies of Great Britain
and the continent. The meeting passed—é I
unanimously—a resolution condemning
the Cooper bill.

" This society is of the opinion that no
Act Of Parliament in the world has done
more to legalize animal suffering than the
British Cruelty to Animals Act of 18-76.

‘ The background and history of this

antiquated British Act shows that the ..

early antivivisectionists believed—~With all;

2 the faith that burns in the heart Of every

pioneer—k—that the passing of this bill inth‘
law would sound the death knell t0 suf-
fering in animal experimentation. Their

disappointment can be imagined; under
the act the experiments have increased '1
from just over 300 to over 3, 000, Q00 '

annually.

Mrs. Stevens says: “The fact that there

has never been a prosecution under the '

act is a tribute to its efﬁcacy.” Theré
cannot be a prosecution, so well shielded

and protected are those who hold the "

necessary license and appropriate certifi-
cates.

Let it be stressed that the passage of
time from LOrd Shaftesbury to Lord_
Dowding marks the greatest period of
humanitarian reform in British history}
yet never in our long history were re-

formers so utterly, so grievously, disap‘.’ .

pointed as when they unwittingly legal-

'ized this evil. We in Britain know from

our experience over the last 90-Odd years
that the act has literally legalized and
entrenched the suffering to animals these:
same pioneers were determined to abolish.

Speaking for myself, I suppose I have

., seen only a mere fraction of the suffering ' .

allowed by virtue of this act, but I have
watched tens of thousands of experimental,
animals. Many suffered an appreciable
amount of pain. In my opinion, so long as:
men and women are allowed to keep ani-
mals alive after experiments, suffering
will always be present. ’

We beg American animal lovers to op-
pOse the C00per bill, no matter how .111...
core the promoters may be. =7

MAIL FOR CONGRESSMEN

Dear Editors:
Florence Harrison’s letter (CATS, Au-

gust 1962) echoes my own thoughts and

feelings. I do hope your staff can do
something to help the poor animals in
laboratories, and certainly bringing the
current acrivities in Congress on these re-
forms to your readers’ attention would
help.

Many people who would act are unawaie
of the situation and your magazine certainly
ieaches a group of most interested persons.
The Animal Welfare Institute, 22 East
17th St., New York 3, N. Y., would be

one interested enough to write, as would

Not Miss Verhoeff’s Bill

~ Because of my known interest in the welfare
of laboratory animals I find that I am regarded as
chief advocate of.a bill about to be presented to
the Senate by Kentucky’s John Sherman Cooper.
I hasten to correct such impression. I had never
heard of the bill until a copy was sent to me about
ten days ago by its originator, the president of
the Animal Welfare Institute of New York.
Although I respect and admire the officials of
the Institute and have cooperated with them in
many worth-while projects to relieve animal suf-
fering, I am - unwilling to endorse their present
bill, or any other bill, attempting to interfere with
the power and responsibility of the medical pro-
‘ fession to care adequately for animals used in
research. Every institution in which animal experi-
mentation is “practiced has individual problems
solvable only by the scientists in charge. ‘
Societies devoted to the promotion of animal
welfare can render valuable assistance if invited
to investigate the conditions, criticize and suggest.
Increasingly today such cooperation is sought and
appreciated by departments of research not only
because of ethical censiderations but also because -
of the very positive value of the principles of
. huma-nitarianism to all Scientific procedure. ,
In the ideal world of the future all scientists
will have developed into humanitarians and. all
.humanitarians into scientists realizing that com-
passion for the helpless, both "human and sub-
human, is the basis and potential of an advancing
and durable civilizatidn. I can’t endorse any bill
that would arouse hostility and interfere with the
growing co-operation between those dedicated to
the promotion of human welfare through research
and those dedicated to the rescue of helpless
Creatures from distress. . .. ‘
No law, only the scientists themselves, can
provide 'what I want for laboratory animals. I

Critical Of CooPer Bill“;

' It is with considerable dismay that I find. ‘
such admirable newspapers as The Courier-Jour- <

nal and The Washington Post giving editorial
support to the so—called Cooper Bill, S. 3570,, with-
out heeding the full implications of such a meas-
ure. No one can deny the worth-while motives
behind such a bill; but it is doubtful that the bill
strikes a sensible balance between the needs of
‘esearch and the demands of humane treatment.
our editorial does not state the central thesis of
his bill, which is to require detailed research
lans for all research projects using animals to
.be submitted to the H.E.W. Secretary prior to
research. Detailed annual reports covering all
such research would be required. It would .rez
move the initiative for devising and executing
research tasks from the individual scientist,
Where it belongs, to a remote bureaucracy.

Scientific work is, in essence, creative despite
the modern trend toward production-line meth‘
ods. The accomplishment of small improvement
in animal care would be made at the cost of
acres cf red tape. One need not use a steam
shovel to pick defective raisins out of a barrel of
good raisins. . ERNEST K. MONTAGUE.

gOEOsES Cooper Bill

While the main aim of the Cooper Bill (s.
3570) is commendable to legislate against gov-

ernment support of cruelty to animals, the bill

seeks to effect this through the imposition of a
bureaucratic system whose result will be to win ,
ple the life sciences. It is rather unfortunate that ‘
your editorialist and the author of a Point of
View letter did not carefully peruse the details .
of Bill S. 3570.

The Cooper bill denies that there can be any
purpose other than the desire to prolong life or
to further military requirements which could be
justified in the use of living vertebrate animals.
The fundamental purpose of biology, namely to. 1‘
accumulate knowledge in an orderly body, is thus ‘
denied. The Cooper bill opposes any experiments ,
on living sharks or salamanders or snakes (all
vertebrates) unless these experiments could be
shown to provide information leading to the cure
of human illness or for some military reason,
rather unlikely in these species. . .

The Cooper bill also provides that a repre-
sentative of the government can enter the lab-
oratory .of any biologist or medical investigator
and, if he does not approVe of the experiment un-

j..derway, can order the experiment stopped and- ,1

READERS” POINT OF VIEW

‘Let Us Unite In Spirit9
To the Editor of The Courier-Journal:

I was born a Catholic by tradition and reared
a Protestant by supposition, but have tried to
live by realism and respect the other fellow’s
right of choice and freedom of equality. In other
words, I have rendered unto Caesar that which is
Caesar’s and have tried—although I know I have
failed—to render unto God that which is God’s.
But we mortals all are guilty of that error.

Today we are near that hour (how near only
God alone knows), but it is surely time to heed
the warning: “I will come in a cloud.” That cloud
is getting nearer and nearer each passing day.
The world is living on the theory of greed, gross
indifference and false complacency. To plead for
unity and peace While in this state is but to cast
pearls before the swine or set the olive branch
and dove with a broken wing adrift on a stormy
sea.

Let us consider and try to be realistic in the
true and Christian interpretation of these Gospel

words, “What profit has a man to gain the whole ‘

world and lose his own soul? Choose ye this day
whom ye shall serve; God or Mammon.”

Let us unite in spirit, choose the man or men
to lead us in this dark hour, not by tradition nor
supposition and—least of all—not by his right
of choice of religion but by the true Christian
dictate of our true hearts and impartial minds.
Be of good faith for it is the peacemaker that
shall inherit the‘Kingdom of God. “Judge not
lest ye be judged.” There is but one God, one
church and one way by which we all should be-
long and serve in .unity and equality. God is no
respector of persons. BEN E. ROWLETT.

Needed Leadership

Another great Democratic National Conven-
tion is over and the party has selected a great
ticket, Kennedy and Johnson, giving both the
nation and the world hope once again that so
tragically has been lacking since January, 1953.
The convention has always proved the Demo-
cratic Party to be blessed with the finest states-
men of leadership ability and capability —— to
mention a few, Stevenson, Symingtoii, Collins,
Blair, Jackson, Meyner. I challenge the Repub-
lican Party to name those in-their ranks who can
even Come near to the statesmanship and leader-
ship of all I’ve mentioned. I know of two the
Republicans can claim, Rockefeller and Lodge,
who have leadership abilities. Yes, for the peoples
everywhere there’s new hope once again.

Great leadership is needed again, and all
biases and prejudices should best be put aside,
and all work together to save the world and our-
selves.

For Secretary of State, Stevenson or Bowles;
Defense, Finletter; Agriculture, Freeman; Health,
Mennen Williams or Rockefeller.

Lexington, Ky. JOHN T. DURR.

Knows Of No Cure-All

Now that the Democratic tornado starting in
Massachusetts swept across the United Statesand
settled in Los Angeles, it is time for all good
people to. meditate. What debris didit carry with

it as it left our shores? What material did it,

leave the people upon which to build a new
thought foundation?

The Democrats want me to believe we are
now all going to be free and equal in race, color
and creed, equal in all ways of life. This is
against God’s laws and we shall pay a heavy price
if we go along with this theory. God created each
living thing for a purpose within its own life
orbit. He knows far better than we His purpose
of this earth.

I have never yet known a cure-all for ailments.
That medicine destroys its victim because the
victim is lulled into a false sense of security.

Irvine, Ky. LENNIE ALCO-RN.

Against Cooper Bill

I offer my opposition to Senator Cooper’s
bill, S. 3570. A printer and liberal Republican, I
have no vested interest or political bias. I am
opposed to seeing animals suffer. I am also op~
posed to seeing human beings suffer, and the
latter will suffer if this bill is passed Whether
the bill passes, laboratory animals will continue
to serve the experimenter’s purpose. It is odd
that advocates of the bill overlook this. ’

More at issue is whether financed laboratories
are going to eradicate the lone and Small-group
expe1imenters. If it passes, the intent of S. 3570
will be legally interpreted as valid for all cx-
perimenters. The governmental standard will then
be necessary for unfinanced experimenters who

normally are unable to provide the “comfortable
resting place, adequate space and facilities for

normal exercise, and adequate sanitation, lighting,

temperature control and ventilation” and “ade- ,

quatc food and water.”

These impositions also show ignorance of an
experiment’s course. One may be designed to test
starvation or endurance. The bill’s passage would
unwisely define the limitsof experiment. I am
not willing to see the animal psychologist, physi-
ologist, or behaviorist circumscribed except by
his peers, notably scientific discipline.

Students do not enter the experimental field
to harm animals, but to elicit scientific facts
which will benefit man. It is odious to think we
will educate people to scientific experimentation
and then crush them under laws and licensings
which betray narrow perspective and unexpected
implications.

,If knowledge of maltreatment of animals is

had and legal recourse is warrantable, surely ex-- '

isting laws would encompass such cruelty and
apply to the scientific experimenter. Believing

. that they would, I conclude that the bill’s impli-

cations, tendencies and aspersions are the es-

sential issue and the bill should be defeated to

remove them. GEORGE E. STRICKLAND.

Observes Buying Slump

My observation of the alarming let-down in
consumer buying since the inauguration of the
sales tax may be a bit premature; but after talk-
ing to people who are forced to pay this tax, I
have come to the conclusion there is more than
the tax involved.

. From many peopleI hear the comment, “I

just quit buying.” That seems to indicate there is
a principle involved and implies that people are
reaching the saturation point of taxes on top of
taxes, hidden and unobscured. The one thing that
might have provided a temporary shot in the
arm for business in our state was the soldiers

bonus, but it seems that that is to be held up untii”

some remote future date.

Now comes the political platform to be pro-
mulgated by our profound thinkers which plainly
gives away staggering amounts of money for
various social benefits and no mention of where
the money is to come from. By the way, where
is it coming fro-m? Alas, little man, what now?

Lyndon, Ky. W. G. SLATER.

Heritage Of The Country

It seems almost ridiculous to hear someone in
our America complaining or criticizing another
fellow citizen’s religion. Perhaps a person of this
sort has forgotten, or perhaps the poor fellow

never knew, that the very heritage of this coun.

try is religious freedom.

"Maybe he never read the “Landing of the Pil-
grims.” There is one portion of this poem that
has always stood out in my mind from early child-
hood, although I have not read the poem for many
years: “There were men with hoary hair amidst
this pilgrim band. Why had they come to wither
there away from their fair home land? What
sought they thus afar, bright jewels of the mine
the wealth of seas, the spoils of war? They sought
a faith’s pure shrine.”

Louisville. FLORA N. SWAFFORD.

The Human Inventory

Concerning the G. E. layoffs, let me state that
this is an act of inhumanity. In his book, “Human
Use of HumanBeings,” Professor Norbert Wiener,
of MIT, points out that human beings cannot be
put into and taken out of inventory as if they
were hard goods for sale without doing violence
both to the workers’ morale and the economy’s
health. EARL R. PETERSEN.

Strength for the UN

To THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR:

The United Nations, which for 15 years
has been working for peace in a world
fraught with danger of war, has become
increasingly important. Any doubts on
that score were quickly dispelled by the
news of the great gathering of world

the same time the position of Secretary-
General has been growing in importance.
This last summer theSecretary—General
was no longer the arbiter between factions:
in the Congo question he took his stand for
' order and peace,

The UN, given apprdpriate' power, is
the one place which can be the hope of
all the nations of the world: East'and
West small nations and large. It can pro-
tect the United States and its allies against
Soviet imperialism the neutrals in their
rights as neutrals and independents, the
Soviet Union against what it fears, en—
circlement by the West.

During his stay Mr. Khrushchev advo-
cated revision of the UN Charter, some-
thing~.many United States citizens have
been wan-ting for years. But Mr. Khrush-
chev’s revision, substitution of a triumvir-
ate f01 the Secretary— —General would not

Russian veto into the administration of
the organization. For the total dis-arma-
ment which the Russians say they want,
a security force would be needed, says
Mr. Khrushchev, to maintain , peace and
protect rights. We should perhaps not care
to have powerover such a force in the
hands of one man. But this power in the
hands of the proper authorities, the As—
sembly, the executive, the courts, is some—
thing else.

Why not take Mr. Khrushchev up on
Charter revision—not going along with his
revisions to weaken the UN but calling a
conference to see that it is strengthened?

Experiments on Animals
To THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MoNI'rdR:

Monitor for July 29 and Sept. 22 I was
grateful to read letters advocating passage
of the Cooper bill regarding the humane
treatment of laboratory animals.

Mindful of the many letters to the Mon-
itor prior to the ﬁnal passage of the Hu—
mane Slaughter .Act, and in an effort
to understand how much the Cooper bill
means td the care of laboratory animals,
I have obtained a book entitled, “The
Principles of Humane Experimental Tech—
niques, ” by William M S Russell and “Rex
L. Burch of University College, London.

The authors outline what they term the
“three R’s” of humane technique. They
are replacement, reduction and ieﬁne—
ment.‘ These are described brieﬂy as
follows: '

“Reduction: means reduction in the
number of animals used to obtain infor-
mation of given amount and precision.-

“Reﬁnement: means any decrease in-the
incidence or severity of inhumane proce-
dures applied to those animals which still
have to be used.”

Another method of reﬁnement they ad-
vocate is “ﬁlming of experiments,” which
would greatly reduce repetitious tests in
laboratories, and colleges, where the stu-
dents could not possibly make such tests.

Regarding a statement that experiments
on living animals in 1958 in England to-
taled roughly 12, 000 per day—“two-thirds
of which were carried on without anes-
thesia—I am told that many more experi-
ments are performed in the United States
than in England. and we do not even
know how many thousands ofanimals are
used. Why can’t we have a law based on
the English “Cruelty to Animals ACt of

, 1876” which controls experiments on ani—
.mals within certain humane bounds?

A very hopeful sign in this writer’s
opinion is the growing ﬁeld of scientists '
who, in their efforts to develop more hu-

mane techniques, are ﬁnding that it. is

often'possible to use bacteria or tissue
cultures instead of living. animals. May
we hope that thesetrue animal lovers are
pOinting a way to ultimate liberation for

N onstrategic Islands
To THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR:
, It seems to me that the policy with
regard to the islands of Quemoy andMatsu

‘ pursued by the present administration, and

which was endorsed, although evidently
with varying interpretations, ’by‘ bOth '
presidential candidates, comes dangerously
close to duplicating the unfortunate policy
of the Truman administration which led to
the Korean War. It wduld seem that if it
is .our intention to defend the islands, it
would be much better to make thisclear.
The policy of “keeping the Communists
guessing” seems to increase the danger of
war, as in Korea, through a bad guess on
their part.

On the other hand, if we are not to de-
fend the islands, surely this should also be
stated in advance in order to make it clear
that the decision is our own and avoid the
impression --of yielding to force, an im- ‘

. pression Which might encourage Commu-

nist attacks against positions which we do
intend to defend. .

I feel that the latter Is the correct course
for the following reasons. First, the islands
appear to be nearlyvalueless strategically.
Secondly, it would be difﬁcult to show that

‘the population of the islands would be

worse off under a Communist dictatorship
than living under the presentNati‘onalist
dictatorship amidst the dangers of awar

'zone In any event, the population is small

enough that the resettlement of those de-
siring it should be feasible. _

Lastly, because of the difﬁculty Of naval
operations in conﬁned waters Off an enemy

of the islands, as distinct from Formosa,
may well require attacks on the mainland

Lastly, the Cooper bill is predicated on the

The Reader Writes »

F reedom’s OﬂenSiV'e
To THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR:

Whether it is in the Congo or at the
United Nations, Communist imperialistic
objectives remain unchanged. In the
Congo, Communists are posing before the
peoples Of Africa as the defenders Of free-
dom and national independence. At the

‘UN, the Soviet Union is hindering the

work Of establishing law and order in the
Congo Republic.

It is particularly interesting to point
out to what extent the principle Ofna-'
tional self-determination has been ex-
ploited by Communist propaganda. This
exploitation is, indeed, a historical para-
dox and complete 'misrepresentation of
facts Of how Russian imperialism under
the cover of international communism
subjugated freedom-loving nations of
Central and Eastern Europe and a great
part of Asia. It should be emphatically
stressed here that such an exploitation of
national aspirations in Africa should be
regarded as a mere tactical Communist
maneuver to distract world attention, par-
ticularly of the new African states, from
true Communist objectives for world dom-
ination and the Unwilling, presence of
many non-Russian nations in the Com-
munist empire. _

While Khrushchev propagates self-
determination for African peoples, national
aspirations of the captive nations within
the Soviet empire are totally persecuted.
“Bourgeois nationalism” ’Of Ukrainians,
Latvians, Byelorussians, Lithuanians‘,
Armenians, and other captive nations, con-
tin es to haunt the imperialistic Moscow.
All possible methods are used to destroy

the indestructible nationalism of non-.
Russian nations in the Soviet Union. Yet,.

today communism is posing as a friend of
national self- determination for peoples of
Afiica and Asia, disregarding the fact
that once- -free Republics of Ukraine,
Lithuania; Latvia, Armenia, were de-

, stroyed under the pretext that communism

is replacing nationalism as a binder of a
state! .

It is the moral duty of the United States
and the free world to present the true
picture of the relationship between Mos-
cow and conquered peoples. We have facts!
In July, 1959, Congress Of the United
States passed the Captive Nations Resolu-
tion (Public Law 86-90). This resolution,

‘ grounded in historical facts, spells out

. entrusted to a special agency. Congress- _

clearly the weaknesses Of the Communist
empire.

Moreover, this resolution cOnstitutes the
basis upon which a more realistic and
dynamic policy toward the captive nations
must be developed, a policy which would
not only challenge Communist “ﬁrsters,”
but initiate the free-world’s crusade for
freedom and justice for all nations of the
world. Rejecting Communist claim of
“status quo” in Central and Eastern Eu-
rope, the new policy should stress the
principle of self-determination and free-
dom not only for satellite countries but
also for captive peoples within the Soviet
Union.

Furthermore, the development and im-
plementation of the new policy should be

5 man Daniel J .. Flood of Pennsylvania pro-
1 posed the establishment of a congressional

committee to deal with captive nations.
Senators Paul H. Douglas Of Illinois and

Karl Mundt of South Dakota proposed the
establishment of ‘a freedom commission
and freedom academy in the United
States.

Let us hope that the new Congress will
establish such an agency. Only an imag-
inative, dynamic, and realistic policy,
based upon the principle of self— determi-
nation and justice for all peoples, will
demonstrate to the new nations Of Africa
and Asia the true meaning and objective
of communism. It will keep alive the
spirit Of freedom among the captive na-
tions. The meeting of the United Nations
Assembly and our presidential elections
are the most appropriate occasions to
sharpen freedom’ 8 Offensive.

Impartial Reporting
TO THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR:

I was disturbed to read in an Associated
Press item that my favorite daily news-
paper was to expurgate Nikita Khrush-
chev’s speech at the United Nations Gen-
eral Assembly, presumably lest Monitor
readers should be subverted by Commu—
nist propaganda, I should much prefer to
be given an impartial report, leaving me
free to decide for myself about the propa-
ganda. CHARLES A. BOWMAN

Nanaimo, BC.

[Editor’s note: The Monitor had no
fear its readers would be subverted by Mr.
K. Nor has itabdicated its responsibility
to supply the news. Its own statement of
purpose said: “We shall give Mr. Khrush-'
chev’s doings the coverage required by
any news he actually makes. His Ofﬁcial
statements will be reported; what he had
for; breakfast will not be.”] ,

Need for Understanding
To THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR:

There seems to be considerable mis-
understanding On the part Of objectors to
Senator COOper’s Bill S. 3570, including
the letter in the Reader Writes column of
the Monitor by Harvey Metcalfe, Secre—
tary, Scottish Society for the Prevention
of Vivisection.

Some of this misunderstanding is gen-
uine; some of it is deliberate misrepre-
sentation and an attempt to confuse the
issue by claiming that Senator Cooper has
withdrawn his bill ,

Senator Cooper has not withdrawn his
bill but rather will request hearings on it
when COngress reconvenes. All he is try-

ing to do through legislation is to procure

care and the elimination of all unneces—
sary suffering through the use of“ anes-
thetics both before and after vivisection—-

little enough for the life Of helpless little,

animals sacriﬁced.

Newspapers throughout the country are
making strong appeals for the passage of
this bill.

Though the practices it seeks to elim-

inate are hidden, they are as dastardly as,

those of killing the burros and wild horses
and as slaughter methods, both Of which
were stopped or altered by legislation
through urgent letters of protest.

Every humanitarian I’m sure, will want
tO rally to the protection of these little
Victims who cannot speak for themselves.
Letters to the government will help.

lithe Wamnmm which you re-
in support of his Coopér bill for
"-1: humane treatment of experimental
: animals

The British Cruelty to Animals Act of

   
 

be ineffective is, unquestionably, the best
legislation on this subject anywhere in
the world. To compare it to the wretched
Hatch-Metcalf law- is false and misleading
‘ in the extreme.

The IH‘atch-Metcalf Act is a measure
designed to force humane societies to sur-
render animals-to laboratories for experi-
mentation which has no limit in pain in-
fliction. Itwa‘s ardently supported by the
National 'Society for _ Medical Research.

5 The Cooper bill, whiCh is violently op-
posed .by: theNation-al Society for Medical
Research, has'nothing to do 'with procure-
ment in any way, but it ”.provides humane
standards including a pain rule which re-
quires the killing of an animal suffering
severe, prolonged pain. It licenses each in-
dividual experimenter so that callous and
indifferent individuals cannot hide behind
the reputation of . a great scientiﬁc insti-

treatment of the animals/they use and the
procedures they use for conducting their
research If they fail to observe the hu-
mane standards clearly stated in the
Cooper bill, they stand to lose their li-
cense to experiment on animals.

The fact that there has never been a
prosecution under the British act is a

legislation of this kind is not to creep up
upon an offender and drag him through
the courts; it is to prevent cruelty to ani-
mals before it. takes place. '

I know from personal experience in
I visiting English and American laborato-
ries, talking with soientiSts and animal-
room personnel in both countries and
making a careful study or legislation in
both countries over a period of eight
‘ years, that British laboratory animals are
”inﬁnitely better off than arethe generality
of American Ones, even though so very
much less money is available to provide
for them in England and even though

The Best Prepared

To THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR: .
The opening salvos of the 1960 presi-

 

I dential campaign have been delivered in

two major cities of this country.‘ The
voting public has been eXposIed to a mass
of informatiOn and details about the two
nominees unequaled in previous Icam-

' ,paigns. j But we must look deeper than
the eye at television can take us. Between ,

now andfthe November elections the judg-
ment and saga'city of the AmeriCan people

. will be Sternly tested.

Some critics say there is very little

.I Choice between the two nominees, Senator

Kennedy and Vice—President Nixon. Both
are young, sincere, courageous, and speak
out fearlessly. BOth have appealing fam-

ilies. Then, barring platform differences,

how does one determine a choice?
Perhaps one guide might be to ask

Igwherein * does each candidate’s loyalties

stand. Towhat ideals is each‘pledged and
what obligations does each intend‘to as-

sume, if elected? For a'm'an 'seldOm arises
higher in performance than his concept -
» of the oﬂice he holds. Therefore let us not ,
~. choose merely between two pleasant young

men of good record, both able politicians,
but rather choose the one who is best pre—

'pared to be the future standard-bearer

of the government.

Mr. Nixon, with true perception of the
difﬁcult days ahead, does not promise
peace and security. He asks for sacriﬁce
and a sense of national purpose by the

people. Although not belligerent, he states
that 1m the field or fore1gn affairs Amemca
I‘ Will not tolerate being pushed around
‘ This exempliﬁes the American spirit of
, freedom. '

Certainly. the ViceAPresident is mind-

' ful of the responsibility of the ofﬁce of the
_ President when he utters such a ringing

phrase as “We mustresist hate, we must
remove the doubts, but aboVe all we must
be worthy of the love and the trust of
millions on the earth for Whom America
is the hope of the world”

These are the words of a standard-

V bearer who possesses both idealism and

The Farm Problem

It appears to me that the. current; ,
cussion of farm problems suffers from i
serious failure to deﬁne basic terms. When
it is asserted that the farmer should res-
ceive his fair share of the national incom,
no responsible person can disagree. Th ,.
difﬁculty comes in deﬁning the fair share.

Certamly a farmer who preduces foodl‘i‘

little more because of the capital the
farmer must have to operate. But When
farming becomes so eﬁice nt that farmers
ore than their
fellow citizens can consume, it becomes ,
necessary to stop looking at farmers as a '

group and start looking at them as indi-
viduals. When this is done it is quite clear
that there are individual farmers whose
services as farmers, producing the food
they are now producing, are no longer
needed.

The political debate revolves around
these farmer‘s. Mr. Kennedy’s wish is evi-
dently to tax ”the farmer’s fellow citizens
in order to keep these farmers in business.
Mr. Benson’s Wish is evidently to reduce
this tax support so that these farmers will ,

. change to work of more value to the come

munity at large. Mr. Kennedy has noted.
that some thousands of farmers have al-
ready done this. (He has not noted the ' ,
corresponding beneﬁt to society.) Mr.I
Nixon has eXpressed his desire to have
the federal gOVernment render ﬁnancial

assistance to these farmers but, signiﬁ- ‘

cantly, Mr. NixOn has not yet stated how
he wishes the money to be spent.

I am sure Mr. Nixon will soon give us ‘
~ this information but I should like to make ,
two preliminary suggestions. First, not all i 1-

farm prbducts are surplus. Some, of this a
money could usefully be spent in assisting

farmers to produce farm products thatg‘f‘i”

are in ' strong demand. My suggestion-1'
would be, for example, more beef and
less wheat. The money would be spent in]
technical assistance and in aiding. the-
farmers involved to obtain the required“
capital for the change.

Second, one important defense need is"
to disperse our industry. Monetary en-'

'couragement for establishing light indus-

try in the farmbelt would be appropriate '
and WOUId give marginal farmer's an al- I

ternative occupation. Some money could.

be used to give farmers the necessary
training. .

We may assume, I believe, that indi-L;
.vidual farmers have no desire to live by

producing somethmg that nobody n. ‘

and security whiCh bankruptcy out Is;
Yet bankruptcy is the only path open to”

 

tern 0f priCe SUpports is reduced or el’1m-" it;

Basically the farm problem is a spend:

1 case of a single industry area trying to, .'
adjust to an expanding and changing'
economy. Ignoring the need for adjust-
ment, as Mr. Kennedy seems to deSire, on},
ignoring the hardships of too rapid ad; ,

justment, as Mr. enson seems to desire. _
are not solutions. I am curious to see "if \
Mr. Nixon, who has not really committed?“-
himself, will ﬁnd a better way.

The Cooper Bill
Gentlemen: -

The Society for Animal Protective Legis-
lation, 745 Fifth Ave, New York 22, N. Y.,
importunes the Marquette County‘Hu'mane
Society on behalf of the Sherman Cooper
bill, S. 3570, now pending in Congress, for
the protection and humane treatment of
laboratory animals. The above organization
is headed by Madeline 'Bemelmans, author
and wife of the well-known author and il-
liistrator. She urges that our organization go
all out on publicity for this bill, which was
introduced in the Senate by John Sherman
Cooper (R.-Ky.). A companion bill, H. R.
12587, was introduced in the House by Mar-
tha Griffiths of Michigan and others.

Because of Michigan’s active participation
in this bill, the Marquette County Humane
Society hopes that all members and all citi-
zens interested in the welfare of animals,
especially those used in experimentation,
will invest a 4—cent stamp and write to any
member on the following list or their own
Michigan men in Washington.

.Senators may be addressed at the Senate
Bldg, Washington, D. C., and congressmen
at the House Office Bldg. Write your letter
today. ‘

The Cooper bill has the following co-spono
sors in the Senate: C00per, Robt. C. Byrd,
Joseph S. Clark, Estes Kefauver, Wayne
Morse, Pat McNamara, Harrison Williams,
William Proxmire, Mike Mansfield, Jennings
Randolph, Frank C. Church, E. L. Bartlett,
Ernest Gruening. Any of these gentlemen
may be contacted.

The bill was designed to prevent unneces-
sary cruelty to animals in research instituo
tions receiving federal grants and in agencies
of the US. government, without hampering
‘medical research.

. The bill can be passed if we who own and
we who are interested in animal welfare will
get behind it, with our two Michigan repre-
sentatives who are two of its sponsors. . f

Mrs. Bemelmans will gladly send literature
nd information on this bill to anyone. s~end—_

C60per Bill 521‘! /
Humane Standards

Editor of the Press Herald:

Mr. Ralph H. Long Jr. is misinformed
about the bill to ensure humane treat-
ment of experimental animals, 8.3570.
which was introduced in the. U. S. Sen-
ate by Senator John Sherman Cooper.
In his letter, he states that the Cooper
bill would “protect animal lives at the
expense of human lives.” This is not
the case. In introducing the bill, Sena-
tor Cooper said, “This bill would not
inhibit or prevent experimental re-
search. Nor is it my intention or that
of the co—sponsors, of this .bill to do so.
Its basic‘goal is to insure that in experi-
ments requiring the use of animals, pre-
cautions will be taken” and every effort
will be made to conduct such experi-
ments in a manner that is as humane
as poSsible.” .

The Cooper bill sets humane stand-
ards in the use of experimental animals
to which scientists. doing federally fi-
nanced research must adhere. It re-
quires that animals should “be given
adequate food and water. comfortable
housing and adequate sanitation, but
that animals should be anesthetized
during. painful experiments33"“exce‘pt to
the extent that the use of anesthetics
would frustrate, the object or the ex—
periment,_ , and in any event, animals
which are seriously injured as a result
of the experiment or which are suffer-
ing severe and prolonged pain shall be
painlessly killed.”

It is not an anti-vivisection measure.
Similar legislation has been in effect in
Great Britan since 1876, and has been
"'aCcepted by the scientific community
there. Indeed, the Cooper bill could
7benefit research by requiring improved
{housing and better 'pre- and. post-

 

 

 

 

  

.EOpei'ative care in laboratories. where
tandards in animal husbandry are low.
This moderate and humane bill de-
-‘;:§‘e'rves the support of every friend of
animals. ' ‘ '

“Animals and Research”

_ Your June 6 editorial “Ani-
mals and Research” was most
disturbing. Having been in
the laboratories of four differ-
“ent medical centers both. as
student and as teacher, I have
not seen experimental animals
subjected to cruelty.

Why hamper the labora-
tories that are advancing the
frontiers of medicine with
needless legislation? Why add
to the already staggering load
of the National Institute of
Health a new bureau and a
new burden of-red tape?

This is not a real attempt

to restrict cruelty to experi»,
mental animals but 1a thinly
disguised effort on the part of ‘

well organized forces, who op-

pose even the humane use of 1
animals, to put a stumbling
block in the path of education 1

and research.

They advocate this“ regard-
less of the cost to the Nation’s
taxpayers and regardless of
the impediment to the prog-
ress of medicine.

A Humane Bill

The use of animals for scientific experi-
ments has saved thousands of human lives as
a result of knowledge thus obtained.

 

 

ff.

l

Certainly, any (animal used in such ex-l
periments deserves to be spared all unneces-
sary pain, and" tobe" properly housed. Prob-

ably the majority of research institutions do
treat animals humanely. There is evidence.
that a few do not.

The Laboratory Animals Bill introduced
by Senator. John Sherman Cooper (R-Ky)
and 11 other senators was intended to make
certain that all animals used for research
would be treated humanely by medical
schools, research institutions, hospitals and
pharmaceutical houses which receive federal
research grants.

, However while the agencies involved
have endorsed the apparent intent of the bill,
the Arnerican Huriiane Association has
pointed out one weakness and, because of
this, cannot approve it. The defect is lack of
proper evaluation of humane treatment of
laboratory ,animals by advisors from humane
interests, the veterinary profession, medicine,
etc. In the proposed bill, the enforcement and
determination is left, vaguely, to the secre-
tary of Health, Education and welfare.

In holding out for a clearer, more 'de-

We feel the AHA is on the right track.

shocking experience when I rushed
up to the property in response to
an urgent call from my wife to
find that a huge bulldozer had
gone rampaging through the woods,
cutting a swath which for nearly
half the distance measured from 30
to 40 ft. in width, felling huge 75
ft. oaks, numerous large dogwoods,
etc, and doing much damage to
trees standing on either side of the
hideous gap. “The only explanation
I received from the 'deVeloper for

was legally entitled to was that
“he could not bend his pipe.” E
Apart from the flagrantflouting

Humane Treatment

Of Experimental Animalsw

Editor, The Long- -Islander
Dear Sir:

Editorial support of the Cooper
bill for the humane treatment of
experimental animals is most deep-
ly appreciated. 'The bill is urgently

. needed to stop completely unnec-
essary abuse and neglect of these
animals which is as detrimental to
scientific wbrk for which they are
used" as, it is to the animals them-
selves suffering needleSsly as they
do all too often. .

Last week I visited a laboratory
where ticks, mites and black bee-
tles were thickly infesting the un-
101 tunate animal subjects and their
“quarters. Tens of thousands of dolé
lars of federal tax funds had been
granted to this laboratOry for ani-
mal experiments by the National
Institutes of Health. Why cannot f
decent standards be maintained in .
the care and treatment of animals
which have, been purchased with
the tax-payers’- money? If the
Cooper. bill were law, humane .,
standards enforced by federal in«
spectors would prevent needless
suffering and waste.

We hope you will continueto
support this measure actively, for
.ant1v1v13ectionists and medical re-
search extremists are doing their'
utmost to kill it. Your support and '
that of all good citizens ig much .
