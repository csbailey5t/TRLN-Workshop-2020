MAM A “WILD” BIRD? x.

‘rl'iIn these days all thoughtful people are convinced that it is a brutal act to catch a
wild bird and imprison it for the' rest of its life, but many do not realise that the word
“ Wild” applies to many other birds besides those usually classed as such, 'z'.e., our own
English songsters. The general idea appears to be that the tropical and foreign birds

too often seen in captivity are all cage—bred. This is a grave mistake. Only a very small
proportion are cage-bred, for the very good reason that many species will not breed in
captivity.

WHAT ABOUT THE BIRDS IMPORTED FROM TROPICAL COUNTRIES?

Do we realise that these birds, as free in their own homes as our English birds in
our country, are caught in circumstances of terror, packed tightly together, stowed away
for voyages of many weeks, and that the sufferings thus endured cause the death of a large
proportion before the end of their journey P Then they have to endure not only the
'miseries of captivity, but the rigours of our climate. They are cheap to catch, 5 /— per 100
to the bird catcher, but as so many die en made they are expensive to buy over here.

Let us consider what Captain Rattigan, the expert adviser on the treatment of
foreign birds, replied to a correspondent in Cage Birds .°—— '

“ Still, it is just as well to remember a fact in this connection which cannot be
~~serious~1y disputed, and that is, that of all the common parrots imported at least 70%
to 80% die within a few weeks of arrival, and in the vast majority of cases from bowel
trouble.” ’

Let us now turn to the evidence of an eye—witness of birds packed in Brazil for the
English market. Amongst other horrors he describes :4-

“ Two crates, 3ft.- by 1ft. by lft., each containing 30 Blue—bearded Jays (cyanocoraX
cyanopoque) .

“ Their long tails were all broken, in many cases to mere stumps. Some of them -
were pecking in a desultory way at the dead body of another that remained at the bottom
of the incredibly ﬁlthy cage. The man in charge, Italian—German~Brazilian, called ............... ,
promised to remove dead body, but ﬁnally assured me that the others had eaten it !

t

. “ Two crazies of similar dimensions each containing 35 all-green Parakeets (conurus
terica). There may have been 36 or 37 of these, but they were so frightened that I did not
like to handle them, and ............... did not know the exact numbers himself.” "
