A Memorandum of
Understanding for
Humane Organizations
And Veterinarians

%

published by
The American H uuuuu Association
896 Pennsylvania St... Denver. Colo.

 




A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING FDR
HUMANE ORGANIZATIONS AND VETERINARIANS

The American Veterinary Medical
Association and humane organizations
exist by right of public approval,
legal authorization, and from necessity.
Each has its appointed task in the field
of animal welfare: the veterinarian
diagnosing and prescribing for, treating,
and conserving the life and well-being of
animals; humane societies working for the
protection, relief, and comfort of animals
from the humane standpoint. The veterin-
ary profession and the humane organiza-
tions have much in common and at all times
there should exist between them the closest
c00peration.

As a basis of agreement, the follow-
ing revised articles are advanced:

I. There should exist at all times the
heartiest and most loyal cooperation
between veterinarians and humane
organizations.

Humane organizations should endeavor,
in the building of their work, to avoid
conflict with the development and pro-
fessional activities of the veterinary
profession.

Humane organizations should continue

to emphasize the importance of the
proper care and humane treatment of

all animals; in localities where _
either the veterinary profession or
humane organizations are unable to
provide proper facilities, the stimula-

tion of an exchange of counsel between
the veterinarians and the humane organ-
ization in each community is desirable
in an endeavor to work c00peratively
for the better treatment, care, and
condition of animals in that district.

In each community where there is a
humane organization, there should be
developed a joint council to which
grievances on the part of either the
veterinarian or the humane society
may be referred for consideration and
friendly adjustment.

Humane organizations should use their
influence, through the advice of their

officers and through their published
literature, to urge the public to
avail themselves of the services of
qualified veterinarians in all matters
requiring professional skill or knowl-
edge and, as far as possible, the
organizations should encourage and
c00perate with state and national
veterinary medical associations.

There should be incorporated into the
curricula of the veterinary colleges
correlated instruction in the humane
care and treatment of animals, an ex-
position of the duties and responsi-
bilities of humane societies in the
enforcement of the law against cruelty
to animals, and the importance of an
early deveIOpment of a close bond of
fellowship between such organizations
and the veterinary profession.

 




Existing veterinary facilities of
humane organizations, under the
supervision of qualified, licensed
veterinarians, offer an exceptional
opportunity for training and further-
ing the work of the veterinary pro-
fession. It should be the policy of
such an organization to offer its
facilities to all licensed veterinar-
ians on an equitable basis.

The widespread develOpment of well-
equipped private animal hOSpitals
throughout the_United States offers
an exceptional opportunity for pro-
viding charitable veterinary services
through mutual c00peration between
the local veterinary associations and
local humane organizations.

Discussions between the American Veterinary
Medical Association and The American Humane
Association over the past thirty years led
to the acCeptance of this Memorandum of
Understanding which was passed by the House
of Delegates of AVMA August l5, l960 and
accepted by the AHA Board of Directors,
September 29, l960.

The person in charge of installation of your exhibit should know HOW and WHEN shipments were
made in case they become lost. Memoranda of shipping details should be in his possession.

Freight shipments should be made on straight bills of lading, showing number of pieces, weight,
routing, etc. Forward immediately a copy covering each shipment to United Exposition Service
Co., 1812 Half Street, S.W. Shipments made in exhibitor’s own trucks or not covered by straight
bills of lading, must be accompanied by a delivery ticket showing number of pieces, weight, etc.

Exhibitors planning to exhibit machinery or other heavy materials (or materials requiring special
handling equipment) should forward as early as possible detailed information and handling instruc-'
tions.

The rate for our complete drayage service is $7.50 per cwt. or fraction thereof. Minimum charge
of $10.00. This rate includes all of the following services:

A. Receipt of crated shipments, and up to 30 days free storage.

B. Delivery to Exhibitor’s booth.

C. Removal, storage, and return of emply crates and containers.

D. Removal. of shipments from booth and reloading same on out-going carriers.

All cases that arrive direct at the exhibition hall by Railway EXpress, private company trucks, or
common carriers, will be placed in storage during the show at thecost of $5.00 per case. Please
pack smaller empty containers in the larger crates.

Uncrated materials can be handled only at the exhibit site and at the exhibitor’s risk. Such
special handling (which includes inbound and outbound movements) will be charged for at the rate
of $7.00 per cwt. or fraction thereof with a minimum of $10.00.

We shall not be responsible for:
A. Damage to uncrated materials, materials improperly packed and/or concealed damage.
B. Loss or theft of exhibitor’s materials after same have been delivered to booth or before we
have picked up materials for loading out of the booth.

As official drayage contractor, we shall have control of all traffic into and out of the building
to prevent tieups at the loading platform, to keep aisles clear, and to provide an orderly and
efficient operation for the show as a whole. To accomplish this show management urges all
exhibitors to work through the official drayage contractor.

Exhibitors should arrangefor outgoing shipments during the Exposition or immediately after its
close, We will assist, at your request, in the preparation of bills of lading. Be sure that your

material has been carefully’crated-or packed, and properly tagged or marked.

If designated carriers do not pick up on time (or make destination delivery on time) we cannot be

liable for resulting delays. We shall have authority, without clearance from exhibitor, to change
to another carrier in order to expedite removal of materials.

Insurance—we respectfully suggest that you arrange all-risk coverage; this can usually be done
by “riders” to existing policies, often at no extra cost.

Above rates are subject to change without notice in the event of increases in labor costs prior
at the show. .
