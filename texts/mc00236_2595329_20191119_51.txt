L’A'Siiigled out as having a special kind of causality, inasmuch
‘ as it can be ‘determined to action by the presentation
(V orstellung) of certain laws,’$§Kant shows what it is he is
thinking of. The ‘mere conception,’ in the only justiﬁable
sense for freedom, would be the laws themselves, and not the
‘,presentation’ of the laws. Every ‘conception’ may be re?“
garded from two points of View, either as a psychical existent,
or from the point of View of its content; and it is this very
important (and obvious) distinction which Kant appears to
have neglected. If the causation exercised by the presenta?"
tion of a conceptﬁﬁf were enough to justify freedom, freedom’
would be no more than that aspect of every mechanical pro?”
’ééss, which was distinguished above as the only preCise
"sense asggnable'to freedom, on'the common VleW which re?

‘ga'r—dsfthe objects of experience as reaf ; and' thus there?~
would not even be an appearance of conﬂict between it and
natural causality. For it is precisely ‘presentations’ to
which Kant repeatedly asserts that the objects of experience
are reduced, when they are viewed, as he holds they must
be, as appearances. An appearance is a ‘mere presentation,’
and it is only between such that the causal laws will hold.
There would therefore be no difference between ‘an action
of which the ground was no more than’ the presentation of
‘a conception,’ and an action of which the ground ‘must
always be an appearance’ : for the presentation of anything
Whatever is, as such, an appearance.

i Kant himself would seem to recognise this in a passage of
the ‘Canon of Pure Reason,’ in which for that very reason
he is driven to an almost direct contradiction of what he says
in the context quoted above. In this passage (p. 530) he says :
‘Practical Freedom can be proved through experience. For
not only that which charms, 3.23., affects the senses directly,
determines human choice, but we have a power to overcome
impressions, upon our sensual desiderative faculty (Begeh?
rungsvernio'gen), through plmgggéigzgsﬁ of what, even in a
somewhat remote way, is useful or harmful; and these con?
siderations of that which, in View of our whole state, is desir?‘
able,j,q._, good and useful, are based upon Reason. Hence also
Reason gives laws, which are Imperatives, 56.5,, objective
Laws of Freedom, and which tell us, what 0449,14”th M10206”, even
though perhaps it never does happen, and are distinguished
in that respect from Natural Laura, which deal only with that
which happens.’ He then goes on to suggest that, on a wider
view, What here appears as freedom, might be seen to be

if: 'l‘vrf— \T‘fiﬁ present paper is selected from a much longer essay on
Kant’s notion of Freedom, which I hope in future to re?
arrange and enlarge into a treatise on the whole of his Ethi+
cal Ehilosophy. This fact may serve to account in part for
any difﬁculties of transition or apparent omissions of im«
portant topics, which may occur in it. If, after allowance
for this, it should still seem too obscure or ill-arranged, I can
only apologise. My object in the paper is to emphasise and
defend, against such other views as seem to me the most
important, certain points in Kant’s doctrine in which I
believe him to be right; and to criticise others in which
I believe him to be wrong. It is not my main object to ex;
pound Kant, but to arrive at the truth on the subjects which
he discusses. I have chosen to deal with him at such length
mainly because fthml? that reference to the views of the
philosopher, With whom you are most in agreement, {a often
. "The clearest way 01 explaining your own View to an esoteric
..--.2 audien_ce_;_but partly, also, because I think hehas been much
‘rﬁiisunderstood.

“7-" l The paper falls roughly into three divisions. In the ﬁrst
I emphasise Kant’s adherence to Determinism, as that doc?
trine is usually understood, and state brieﬂy the nature of
that Freedom which he also afﬁrms as not inconsistent with
such Determinism (pp. 1793185). In the second I attempt to
defend and explain Kant’s ﬁeterminism and to dispose of the
theory of ‘ Liberty of Indifference ’ (pp. 185}194). In the last
I discuss what seem to me the main difﬁculties in Kant’s
doctrine of Freedom, and attempt to convict him of in?
consistency, and to disprove his position on those points
in which he seems to approach nearest to maintaining

_‘ Liberty of Indiﬁ'erence’ (pp. 1945204). .

fl Irrig-III beginning a discussion of Kant’s notion of ‘Freedom,’
which he himself considers to be essentially connected with
his Ethical system, it seems most important to emphasise

the fact that, so far as his express statements are concerned,
he accepts unconditionally the view of Determinism and re”?
‘octs that of Freedom, in the only sense in which the two
imve been generally discussed by English thinkers. In or?
ilinary controversies on the subject, no such absolute distinc?‘
Linn is drawn between two kinds of ‘causality,’ two kinds
of ‘ determination’ (‘ Bestimmung ’F’rthe sense which is
implied in ‘Determinism’), two kinds of ‘possibility,’ or,
ﬁnally, an ‘intelligible’ and an ‘empirical’ ‘character,’ as
is drawn by Kant. Professor Sidgwick, indeed, puts the
question in such a form that Kant’s answer would probably
have to be on the Libertarian side; but this result seems
only to be obtained at the cost of the above-mentioned
ambiguity. ‘Is the self,’ he saysﬁ‘v‘ to which I refer my
deliberate volitions a self of strictly determinate moral quali?‘
ties, a deﬁnite character partly inherited, partly formed by
my past actions and feelings, and by any physical inﬂuences
that it may have unconsciously received ; so that my volun?‘
nary action, for good or for evil, is at any moment completely
caused by the determinate qualities of this character, together
with my circumstances, or the external inﬂuences acting on .
me at the momentE—i'eincluding under this latter term my
present bodily conditions? or is there always a possibility
of my choosing to act in the manner that I now judge to be
reasonable and right, whatever my previous actions and ex”?
periences may have been '? ’

’7 gNow to the ﬁrst half of the ﬁrst alternative, ‘Is the self

to which I refer my deliberate volitions a deﬁnite character,’
etc. 7? Kant would be compelled to give what Professor
Sidgwick considers to be the Libertarian answer of ‘No,’
because there seems to be implied in it the alternative of
what he would call an ‘intelligible character' ; though even
here he would be in some doubt, because it seems implied
that the ‘intelligible character’ cannotﬂbe ‘of strictly dc?
terminate moral qualities’ or ‘deﬁnitefil. And with this
presumption that Professor Sidgwick accepted his distinction,
he would also probably answer ‘No’eto the second half,
‘Is my voluntary action%.?.?. at any moment completely
caused by the determinate ’qualities of this character? ’
although, had that question come by itself, his answer would
probably have been ‘ Yes,’ since the sequel shows that when
Professor Sidgwick says ‘completely caused’ he is only
thinking of what Kant calls ‘natural causality’ (Natm‘?

causalitat). So, too, in answer to the second question, he I.”

would only say ‘Yes’ on the presumption that Professor
Sidgwick might mean by ‘ possibility,’ intelligible, as well as
empirical, possibility. But when Professor Sidgwick goes
on to exemplify the deterministic view by reference to the
principle of causality as employed in the Natural Sciences ;
when he says (p. (52) ‘ that the substantial dispute relates to
the completeness of the causal dependence of the volition
upon the state of things at the preceding instant,’ there
could no longer be any doubt that only that causality was
meant of which Kant had been at such pains to prove the
universal validity in the QELLtL'que of, Pure Reasoui'ﬂ? and only
some reason for surprise that reference should have been
made to the possibility of a self with an other than a psy-T
chological character. Professor Cliffordv gives a statement
of the doctrine of Free \Vill, as commonly understood, which
seems so clear as to be worth quoting: ‘ Whenever a man
exercises his will, and makes a voluntary choice of one out of
various possible courses, an event occurs, whose relation to
contiguous events cannot be included in a general statement
applicable to all similar cases. There is something wholly
capricious and arbitrary, belonging to that moment only ;
and goehave no right to conclude that L] ctrcumstanceswere
exactly "lifeji'eaited, and the man himself absolutely unaltered,
he "would’ehoose the same course} Now this doctrine Kant-
would absolutely condemn. In fact, if Determinism only
means that all men’s actions conform to the laws of nature,
and so, with the progress of psychology, could ultimately be
predicted as certainly as the motions of the planets (and this
is what Professor Sidgwick seems obviously to mean, and
What is usually meant by it), Kant would have no hesitation
in calling himself a Determinist. ‘All actions of man in
appearance,’ says he, ‘are determined (bestimmt) by his

empirical character and the other contributory causes accord?"

ing to the order of nature, and if we could investigate all
Appearances of his choice (Willkiihr) to the bottom, there

withcerta'iutywand recognise as following necessarily from
its preceding conditions.’ 5”

AFreedom, according to him, is absolutely impossible, if
reality is ascribed to events in space and time. ‘ Since the
thorough-going connexion of all Appearances in a context of
Nature is a law that admits of no exception, this must neces?"
sarily upset all Freedom, if one were determined to cling
obstinately to the Reality of Appearances. Hence also those,
who in this latter respect follow the common opinion, have
never been able to succeed in uniting Nature and Freedom
with one another.’ F; Now the dispute between Libertarians
and Determinists is undoubtedly conducted in general by
those who do ‘follow the common opinion’ of ascribing
reality to what Kant calls Appearances, 3.3:, matter as treated
in thsics and.-.Inlﬁ’dfaéiitﬁéateiﬁnisyclidoa, y.

Determinism is regarded as bringing the phenomena of Will
into harmony with the results established by experimental
investigation of Nature, it can only be a doctrine concerned
with what Kant calls Appearances, and as such the above
quotations seem to prove his unqualiﬁed adherence to it.

I It would, in fact, appear absurd to the ordinary champion
of Free Will, to declare that ‘ actions i.‘,.;.;which never
have happened and perhaps will not happen ’3 are yet ‘neces?
sary ’ ; and yet it is only on this basis that Kant is prepared
to defend Free \Vill. If this be absurd, there is no choice
but Determinism. Kant, in fact, uses ‘ necessity ’ here in a
totally different sense from that in which common sense
usually understands it. “ ‘ Ought’ expresses a kind of
necessity and connexion with reasons, which. is found no+
where else in the Whole of Nature:§{/‘!.i-” .17 .5’ It is impos‘f‘
sible that anything else ought to happen in Nature, than
what in all these temporal relations actually is; indeed

“:jutelyrnocineaningrg If you declare a future action to be

‘necessary’ the ordinary man would suppose you must
mean ‘ it will happen ’fgthat you are predicting something
according to the Laws of Nature; if you do mean that
‘ perhaps it won’t happen,’ he would say that you are using
terms inaccurately; you ought to have said it was only
probable or possible. But meanwhile it is sufﬁcient to point
out that Kant does say this absurd thing; and that from this
second meaning of ‘ necessity’ there follows a second mean?
ing of possibility also. Since that which according to the
Laws of Nature is only possible can be called necessary,
that which according to the Laws of Nature is absolutely
impossible may, from Kant’s point of View, be regarded as

of the impossible, that Kant could have answered ‘Yes’ to
Professor Sidgwick’s second question.

- W What then, if Kant is a Determinist, does he mean by
that Freedom, the reality of which he asserts? The
answer to this question is, I think, to be found in his dis?
cussion of Transcendental Freedom, as an Idea of Reason,
in the Milagofwfafg 71chst The result of this dis?
cussion seems to me to be that Transcendental Freedom is

seek for an actual existence as the ground of another. we
get a mere cause. But that which has Transcendental
Freedom is not a mere cause because it is no part of the
temporal series of events ; and it is not a mere logical reason
because it has all the self-subsistence which appears to
belong to the given temporal series.

‘52 This ‘free causality,’ therefore, is not causality in the
ordinary sense -; and there may well seem a good case for the
contention that it is not free either, on the ground that
freedom has an essential reference to human volition.
Kant’s conclusion at the end of the wigygyﬁjﬁtgvgﬂcawn
should have been that Transcendental Freedom was not
merely possible but actual. But this independence of the
proof of ‘ Freedom’ from the Categorical Imperative, would
seem to justify a suspicion that this ‘ Freedom ‘ is not free?

while, his restricted view of freedom makes it easier for him to
establish a connexion with the vulgar notion. In the vulgar
notion, too, some actions are free and some are not; and
though it would not be admitted, as for Kant is necessary,
that those which were free, might also, in another aspect, be
seen to be completely determined by natural eausality, yet
the mere fact that the application of freedom is so partial,
and also its especial connexion with man, assimilate the
View more to that of Kant, than is possible with that here
mocated, according to which freedom is universal.

Gil, QR ﬁrﬁln t e vulgar notion- of free om the most universal
characteristic seems to be the absence of external constraint
whether exerted to impel or to prevent. Where the im-T‘
mediate cause of a motion or change seems to lie in the
thing which moves or changes and not in anything outside
it, there, in a sense at all events, freedom is predicable.
But this is a notion which is obviously not limited to human
actions. Many of the movements and changes of animals
and plants have their proximate cause in the things them?
selves ; and the same might probably be said of any body in
so far as it moved in accordance with Newton‘s second Law

. of Motion. It is thus we seem to talk of ‘ free as air,’ or of
the wheels of a watch moving ‘ freely

(‘2 lBut there is an obvious defect in this wide notion, in that
the limits, whether spatial or temporal, of any group we
may take for our unit or thing, are always more or less
arbitrary. A watch may be moving freely when its spring
18 driving it ; but the movement of any one of its wheels is
not free, because the wheel is driven by the spring or by
another wheelﬁgAnd, again, there seems no reason why we
should single out the proximate or immediate cause for such
pre-eminence, nor anything to determine how far back in the
past a cause ceases to be proximate. It is difﬁculties of this
sort which seem to have gradually tended to restrict the
notion of freedom to man, because in man the notion of

self is far more striking than elsewhere and the distinc?
tion between the internally and externally caused, therefore,
pgjntafctcie more satisfactory. The difference between him?
self and anything else whatever is more constantly forced
on a man’s notice and more practically important to him
than any other difference, and it is therefore not unnatural
that the notion of freedom, in the sense of self-caused action,
whether or not it is originally derived from his own ex.”

erience and transferred anthropomorphically to other things,
should at all events he more widely applied and less easy to
dispense within his own case, and that of other beings like
him, than elsewhere.

1‘; . Now the vulgar doctrine of Free Will, as ‘ Liberty of In?“
difference,’ seems to be in the main an attempt to raise this
distinction between self and the world entirely above the
level of an arbitrary distinction. It was seen that this could
not be done, if the self were regarded as a part in the causal
chain of events, since it must then be subject to the inﬁnite
divisibilitv inherent in time and the ultimate causal unit
remain as arbitrary as any unit of time. It was therefore
maintained that man’s soul was an agent undetermined by
previous events in time; it was the absolutely simple unity
of Rational Psychology, and, as such, distinguished from all
natural objects, which were always both themselves divisible
into parts and also incapable of certain discrimination from
an ever wider whole. Such a notion of a finite uncaused
cause inevitably follows from the attempt to distinguish
within the world of experience cases of purely internal and
purely external causation.

’ And there are good reasons why the human will should
have been taken as the final instance of a cause which is
not also an effect. The progress made in the analysis of
mental processes has been very slight in comparison with
that made in physical science, (1) because of their greater
complexity, (‘2) because experiment in psychology must be
either indirect or encumbered by the fact that the observed
is also the observer, and (3) because subconsciousness must
be taken into account. And the region of theincompletell ”a

only modify our view of that, if the real connexion of body

though obviously corresponding to physiological, and useful
for their investigation, have only too much the appearance
of a totally independent world from the point of view of
causality and reciprocity. So that the distinction is justiﬁ:

a ‘ i As for ‘the immediate afﬁrmation of consciousness in the

against Determinism, great care is needed in deciding what
it is that consciousness then aﬂ'irms. The ﬁrst thing to be
noted with regard to this matter seems to be that, if such an
afﬁrmation is to apply to the Free Will controversy, it must
afﬁrm, not the possibility of my {19mg what I choose, but
the possibility of my Qikqgéj‘lg’llg. In fact, the controversy
seems to narrow itself to the question of Free QZRQ’IQQ? For
it is only choice which distinguishes voluntary from non:
voluntary action, and the ordinary Libertarian would hardly
maintain that non-voluntary actions could be free. Thus
the question is also seen to be a wider one than that which
is ordinarily discussed. For since the physical possibility
of the action, which is. the possible object of choice, cannot
be considered to be a necessary element in constituting it
good or reasonable, in the sense which is fundamental for
‘practical reason,’ it seems hardly possible to exclude mere
choices, such as that I should" have the genius of Shakespeare,
though, that I should have it, might be reasonably con?“
sidered physically impossible. Even such a case as a ch01ce
to prevent the sun rising to-morrow can hardly be excluded
from the discussion. For though, perhaps, none but a
madman would make such a choice, yet his choice would
prove that it can be made : and we ourselves do often choose
through ignorance what is impossible in this sense; the only
reason why we do not choose what we also £19249 impossible,

the effect chosen, seems to be merely one for experience to
decide, and we judge of it just as we judge of the probabili—J”
ties and possibilities of events in the physical world. It does
not seem to be concerned in the Free Will controversy, if
the issue of that controversy be clearly stated.

.rinLocke and Humeﬂindeed, agree marvellously in their
treatment of Liberty, both asserting that it means simply
‘a power to act as we choose i. .- But it would seem to be
for this very reason, that they are able to treat the Free
Will controversy so cavalierly as they do. If the question
were merely as to whether we did not sometimes do what
we choose, it would, as they say, be obvious what answer
we should give; but it would not, as they also say, be
obvious that liberty in this sense was not contrary to
‘necessity,’ since the question ‘Can we choose?’ would
still remain unanswered. They both, it is true, leave an
ambiguity even on the ﬁrst point, by not sufﬁciently con-TS
sidering what is implied in their notion of ‘power’; but,
nevertheless, when they speak of a power to act as we _
choose, they would appear to mean only, as Locke saysf'rg;
that the existence or non-existence of the action is de:
pendent upon our choice. In this part of free action, then,
it may be admitted that they leave no room for anything
contrary to ‘ necessity’ ; since their notion is that the action
is necessitated by the choice. Locke, however, sees that
the point in dispute occurs not here but in the questionat V
Are we free to choose? And this question he dismisses as?
absurd, on the ground that it means : Can a man will, what
he wills? But it does not mean this, unless his deﬁnition
of freedom, as power to do what I choose, be already
accepted. It would indeed be absurd to ask ‘ Can I choose
to choose ?’ in the sense ‘Am I free to choose which of two
alternatives I will choose?’ But Locke has no right to.
assume that this is meant by the question ‘Am I free to
choose?’ That question may mean ‘Am I the original
cause of my choice ? ’ and this he leaves undiscussed. Both
Locke and Hume therefore neglect the point of the contro?"
versy by their deﬁnition of freedom. They have, however,
done some service to the question, inasmuch as their treat?
ment of it is a protest against the confusion of freedom “to
do, if I choose,’ with ‘freedom to chooses".x Their defect is
- that they assume that it was an answer to the ﬁrst question -.
only, which was really wanted; and hence their contempt I???

of the dispute. As a matter of fact, I am free, in the
ordinary political sense, when ‘I do what I choose, Maine.
’I_ .-.§11:Q.Q§§.--f§’i2’ since there the immediate cause of my action
lies in myself, 13., in my choice. But that is not freedom
in the sense demanded by Libertarians. What they wish
to maintain is that the choice itself is caused only by a
self which is an uncaused entity; and this implies that,
where alternatives are presented, their choice between them
is wholly independent of their previous habits, disposition,
etc.

‘g The question then is : ‘ Does consciousness affirm, when
alternatives are presented, that I can choose any of them that
I think either good or bad ?’ which would seem/to be equiva'é"
lent to ‘any conceivable presented alternative“; And with
this we come to the last ambiguity of statement, which
seems to me to stand in the way of our giving a clear answer
to the question. Professor Clifford (Lectures and "Essay;
p. 327) rather ingeniously urges that, if the deliverance of
my consciousness is to be ‘of' any use in the controversy,’
it must be ‘ competent to assure me of the non—existence of
something which by hypothesis is not in my consciousness,’
3L.e., the subconscious mental elements which the Deter?“
minist must suppose to determine the choice. But it seems
possible to surmount this objection by maintaining that it is
enough if consciousness can make a positive afﬁrmation as
to what is cause of the choice, without requiring it to prove .
exhaustively that nothing else in the world can be. If' the
man of science before he enunciates a law is always bound
to prove that no other elements besides those whose constant
connexion with the eﬂect has been observed by him, really
contributed to it, no scientiﬁc laws have been discovered yet.
If, therefore, consciousness does afﬁrm that ‘ I’ am the
cause of the choice, that should be sufficient. But then the
question arises, What can it mean by ‘ I ’ ? Is it quite
certain that when consciousness seems to affirm that ‘ i 99,21,
choose so and so,’ it means more than ‘it is possible that
such and such a choice will take place in my mind’? If it
does not mean more than this, its afﬁrmation is not against
Determinism; since, as we have tried to show above (p-
187 ), even on the Deterministic hypothesis, it must always
be entitled to afﬁrm the latter prOposition, even if it does not
always exercise its right. For by saying that such and such
a choice is possible I imagine we can mean no more than
that we do not know but. that it ”will happen ; and even 1f
‘ the uniformity of nature ’ can be proved in such a sense as _‘
to justify an assertion with regard to any event whatever ll‘lli

with regard to an event conditioned by a conscious forecast. '
at: It seems, therefore, that the ‘ afﬁrmation of conscious?
ness ' as against Determinisﬁdisappears on the attempt torﬁ
make it premse. The attempt to ﬁnd a more exact meaning
_for the vulgar notion of freedom has thrown us back upon
the conception with which we started. Instead of free action
being the action of an ‘uncaused self,’ we have to be content
with it as self-caused action : anything may be said to act
freely in so far as the immediate cause of its‘changes lies in
itself. We have now to see how this notion is connected
with that explained above as derived from Kant ; and to
examine Whether there is any justiﬁcation for applying it in
‘ an exclusive sense to Willég-a restriction which Kant seemsg
l to adopt in the application of his notion also. If the restricl “
tion turns out to be unjustiﬁable in both cases, we shall have.

l Reason to have pointed out that there is nothing absolutely 4 3.133;?
‘inner’ in the objects of experience, either of the outer or a ’
inner sense, either in nature or in mind. He gave the ﬁnal
blow to the doctrine of ‘essences’ and ‘faculties,’ as prim-7‘
ciples of explanation, by showing that advance in scientiﬁc 3%
knowledge presupposed the corgilete interdependence of
f t _s ' that all we can knowvfor certain about them is their _‘

Bitit'hisimainwpoint was that, if you‘iitreatedw natural objects
as if they were self-subsistent, you could not escape the most
unbearable contradictions. This was the ‘natural dialectic

sidering that there could be no efﬁciency unless there were
also ‘ form 73. It is no doubt of more practical importance to
establish tli’é relation between things than just to recognise
those things ; and Kant, in his desire to justify the methods
of natural science, seems to have been misled, by the promif‘
nence given in it to “the discovery of relations, into an un?‘
justiﬁable neglect of the qualitative aspect of things. There
was also, as has been pointed out above, another reason for
the emphasis which he lays on relation-rignamely, his desire to
protest against the assumption that the objects of experience
were real, or qlgsﬂovljzttel‘y self-subsistent. And ﬁnally, quality, so
far as it is necessary, is only one: there are not, as in the
case of relation, a number of different forms to justify. But,
still, from a philosophical point of view, it seems to be of
equal importance, and is always presupposed by science in
discriminating the things between which relations are to be
discovered.

are as yet not entitled muggy: to infer in the world any
differences of quality. And if there were none, as in the
case above supposed, there would be no reason to suppose
that the causal connexion between the successive world:
states was in any way dependent on their qualities. The
quality would necessarily be taken into account in explain?
ing the series as a whole; but the causal connexion might
be considered to hold between them purely as Mtgg, ”923., in
so far as they had matter, in the Aristotelian sense, not in
virtue of their form. And this, it is to be noted, is all that
Kant proves for causality in the Critique of ,PurewRequzt ;
the necessary connexion is between the existence (Dasein)
of things. But, as a matter of fact, there are differences of
quality in the world of experience, and whatever be the
justiﬁcation for it, there is connected With this difference of
quality a most important addition to the notion of causality.
Causality in Kant’s sense would not justify any Law of
Nature, and yet without these science would be impossible.

no way based on arbitrary distinctions. It is a sense, which

show that the notion of freedom is irreducible by maintaining
the existence of uncaused choice. We havenow to show
the connexion between this and Kant’s sense of Freedom ;
and to consider whether he can give any justiﬁcation for
speaking as if his, any more than the'popular sense, were to
be found exhibited in special cases in the world of experience,
i.e., especially in human volition, and not everywhere alike.

mH.-Yi—r1Kant’s use of the term Freedom does seem justiﬁed

can be done in knowing the world. But we have seen that
Kant does not, in the “erﬁgag of Pure Reason, seem to allow
that freedom, in the sense just explained, where it consists in
recognising the part played in nature by each thing’s form,
is an objective notion. His failure to do so seems to be due
to his confusion of this notion with the wider one of syste-T‘
matic unity in Nature, which involves it. It is in the same
way that his notion of Freedom involves the common one,
but also goes much further. According to him Freedom
means not only that each part of Nature is necessarily coni”
nected with all the other parts in respect of‘its form as well
as in respect of its existence ; but also that all these different
forms,considered in themselves,together with theirdiﬁ'erences
and the laws of their connexion, must be taken into account
in explaining the world as a whole : and since the worldasw
a whole is an impossible conception, if the OBJGCtS of expe?‘

”fieiicebe taken to be its ultimate constituents, since they “are ” ”

l’ﬁ‘eCessarily cOncéi‘ved'a's in the inﬁnite forms of spacewand

‘ time, the complete—reasonef‘ all that appears must be placed

"""in‘a‘ supers‘énsible reality. Thi ' ' realit is the
'“Wo’rld'asia Whole, and is the reason of everything that apf

'“pears ; and, as such, it has Freedom. As such, too, Kant
’Will not allow it to Be known as more than a mere Idea; but
There seems reason to think that this was only due to his
failure to reconcile two diﬂerent criteria of reality : so that
he generally considers the being given in the context of ex?
perience essential, and since the context of experience can
never offer the required completeness, such completeness
must be condemned as merely regulative.

163‘ 3 Now our question is, whether a relation, really analogous
to this of the real world to the world of experience, is pre‘f“
sented in the relation of the human will to its actions, and in
that alone among the objects of experience. Kant himself
distinguishes between freedom ‘in the cosmological sense’
(which is the one we have hitherto discussed as his) and
freedom in the ‘ practical sense’; but he asserts that the
latter is possible, only if the former be also possibleSKy In
the ‘ Critique of Practical Reason,’ he proves that ‘ practical
Freedom ’ is actual, and from that infers that ‘ cosmological
Freedom’ is also actualﬁ} What, then, is his account of

ity ’ of ‘reason,’ ‘ to begin a series of events entirely of itselefiE}
‘ Pure practical reason’ is identiﬁed with ‘pure will’; and
‘will’ again, up to the end of the ‘Critique of Practical
Reason,’ seems to be identical with ‘ohoice’ (Willlx‘g’ignr),
though in the preface to the ‘Metaphysic of Morals’ (p.
28), they are distinguished in a very important manner ; for
it is there declared that only ‘choice’ can be called ‘free,’
‘ will’ being concerned not with ‘actions,’ but only, like
practical Reason, with the giving of Mora] Laws.

fie; Kant’s account of the way in which we must conceive
‘practical freedom’ in relation to experience is, as follows:
Every ‘ cause’ (Ursache) has a ‘power’ (Vermogen), which
may be also called its ‘ causality’ (Causalit'at), which ‘power’
is necessarily connected with the subsequent appearance of
a deﬁnite ‘ effect’ (Wirkung) ; and the law of this connexion
is called the ‘character’ of the cause. The transition from
the ‘causality’ to the ‘eﬂect,’ however it be conceived, is
called the ‘action’ of the cause (Handlung). Now in ‘natural
causation,’ the ‘causality’ of every cause is also an effect of
some previous cause, and so on ggﬂgvgﬁgttyn ,j“ and the
‘action,’ therefore, is merely a transition in time. But for
every natural object, we must also suppose there to be an
intelligible ground ; and there is no contradiction in thinking
of this intelligible ground as cause (in another sense) of the
‘causality’ of the natural object. The ‘causality’ of the
natural object would thus be effect both of some preceding
natural object andalso of its intelligible ground. But the
intelligible ground is, as such, in no way subject to ‘timef
conditions,’ and therefore its ‘ action’ in producing the
‘ causality,’ which is its appearance, is not a time-transition.
It cannot therefore be said to ‘begin to act’ at any time,
although its effect, 1.5;. the ‘causality ’ of the natural object,
has a beginning. It is thus original cause of an appearance,
which is on another side also effect of a conditioned cause
and in its turn cause of other appearances. It begins ‘of
itself ’ a series of events in time, without itself beginning to
act.

:1: i Now, so far, except for the ambiguity of the word ‘cause’
as applied to an intelligible object, and except for a lack of
ﬁxity about almost all his terms, many of which are at one
time distinguished, and at another used as synonyms (3.51;
Causalitiit =1 Charakter =é Handlung), there seems no reason
to object' to Kant’s accbuntm- But it is an account which

i, would apply to any natural object whatever, and we have
now to consider Whether it will apply in a special sense to
human volition. g7

' i I quoted above (p. 184) a passage of Kant,"‘/in which he
says that ‘ man knows himself’ not only through his senses,
but ‘ also through mere apperception, and that too in actions
and inner determinations, which he cannot ascribe to the
impression of the senses. He is to himself, it must be ad?
mitted, partly a phenomenon, but partly also, namely in
view of certain faculties, a merely intelligible object, because
his action cannot be ascribed to the receptivity of sensibility.
We call these faculties Understanding and Reason.’ And
hegoes onto say that Reason appears pre—eminently as the
faculty of a supersensible being. We are next told that the
Imperatives expressed by ‘ought’ make it plain that ‘this
Reason hasra Causality, or at least that we represent it as
having onelf. And ﬁnally we have the following sentence:
‘Now this “sought ” expresses a possible action, of which the
ground is nothing more than a mere conception; whereas,
on the contrary, the ground of a merely natural action must
always be an appearance 3.”,-

gs { In this passage I think we have presented the full extent
to which Kant’s error of restricting practical freedom to
reasonablerbeings goes, together With the eonﬁsions on‘
wlﬁch that reg—fiction was based. One ambiguity occurs in
the last sentence; and it is a very important one, since it
seems to have given rise to many false notions of what Kant
meant by freedom. This sentence expresses in an anti-7~~
thetical form the difference between ‘free’ and ‘natural’
causalityﬁwhich he frequently says are the only two kinds
of causation possible. The ﬁrst is distinguished by this,
that its ground is a mere conception; whereas the ground
of the second is always a phenomenon. Now from the
account given above of Transcendental Freedom it will
appear in what sense I accept this description of free
causality. A free cause must necessarily appear to us as a
logical reason, and, so far, as ‘a mere conception ’ ; because
it 1s not, as such, presented to us as an object of intuition.
It is always a universal, and though we can know that it
must also be an individual, we cannot experience it as
uniting both characters. But from what Kant says in the
preceding context, as well as from his general account of
W111 elsewhere, I think it is plain that he is not thinking
of ‘a mere conception’ in this sense. When our will is

’1‘ nature (which would, indeed, with regard to part of his state?"
' ment, be certainly the case) but this, he says, is a speculative
question, irrelevant just here. Finally he comes to this:
‘ Accordingly we know practical freedom through experience
as 31% {Namigjggwggagtgrgé ”ceases, namely a causality of the reason
in determination of the will ; whereas Transcendental Free?
dom demands an independence of this reason itself (in view
of its causal power to begin a series of appearances) from all
determining causes of the sense-world, and so far appears to
be contrary to the Law of Nature, and hence to all possible
experience ; it therefore remains problematic. But‘for reason
in its practical use this problem is irrelevant.f.5 .’.’,The
question with regard to Transcendental Freedoni concerns
solely speculative knowledge. We can set it aside as wholly
irrelevant when we have to do with the practical.’ Now in
this passage Kant states very well what is characteristic of
human volition; and his deﬁnitions of ‘will’ are constantly
expressed in the same fashion. Will differs from other
instances of natural causation, inasmuch as in it the ‘idea’
(to use the common English word for ‘ Vorstellung ’) of
something, which is not yet real, tends to bring about the
realisation of that thing ; and he may be justiﬁed in saying
that this process ‘is based upon Reason,’ since to have an
idea of anything either real or imaginary, presupposes that
faculty of cognition which distinguishes man from beasts,
and still more from inanimate nature. Nay, more than this,
in the special instance, which Kant takes to be the only
truly ‘moral’ willing, where the idea which acts as cause, is
the idea of conformity to a universal law, the content of the
idea is so abstract that it may be conﬁdently asserted that
only reasonable beings are capable of having such an idea.
But nevertheless the idea is even here still ‘an appearance,’
and, as such, separated by an impassable gulf from_tlzecon+
tent, of which it is an idea. And, inasmuch as it is in its
character of idea, 75.2., as “a psychical existent, that it pro?“
duces an effect, the causation is still merely ‘natural ’-'._.This,
as we have said, Kant in the present passage fully recognises.
But it is only the more remarkable that he should speak of
Reason in the same context as ‘giving laws of Freedom,’ as if
it were Reason in the same sense, which is the source on the
one hand of objectivity, and'on the other hand of abstract
. ideas, whether true or false. In this Kant betrays the too
psychological standpoint above'ﬁghicﬁ he seems nevW
Womplétely risen in treating epistemological questirofni'“

,He supplies, as it seems to me, more materials for a true
’view than any one else, and those, too, in a wonderfully for?
ward state of preparation, but nevertheless they are still for
him encumbered and confused with the irrelevant matter,
from which it was his merit to set them free for others. It is
perhaps impossible to dispense with the term ‘rational’ for
what is true or objective, especially after its full adoption by
Hegel ; but it is extremely important to avoid confusing the
‘rational’ in this sense, which is the_fundarnental one for
Kant’s system, with the ‘ rational’ in the sense of that
which implies the psychological faculty of making judgments
and inferences. The distinction between what is true and
What is only believed (although only a ‘rational’ being can

- believe) is one which cannot beeither done away or bridged

ﬁnitentjnbeheve; and it IS this distinctlon which is here‘i'n-~-

question. Knowing, the function of Reason, is on one side a
natural function, and, as such, it is indistinguishable from be?“
lieving; but, in so far as knowing is distinct from believing,
1:53., in so far as that which is known is true, there are no
two words which express a difference more profound. When
Kant talks of the only true morality as based upon the laws
which Reason gives itself, the whole course of his work
shows that he means laws which tell us 3359/ what ought to
be done; it is, indeed, only on this condition that he could
claim universality for themE‘WIn this sense ‘Reason deter“?

action, is an idea of what i ruly goodinut it is only in an
utterly different sense thatv‘ft‘ea'som/"Ean be said to ‘deter'?
mine the Will,’ whenever the idea, which causes our actions,
implies the power of abstraction. And it is only in this
second sense that such determination of the will can be called
a ‘practical freedom’ which is independent of ‘Transcendental
Freedom?) Accordingly Kant himself, as we have said, re?
cognises elsewhere that ‘ the practical conception of freedom
is based upon’ the ‘ transcendental Idea of Freedom ’ (p. 371);
and again, speaking of freedom ‘ as one of the faculties
which contain the cause of the appearances of our . sense:

1 according“ to [WWeapeﬁqgtgg’ (p. 385). And this seems

sufﬁciently t ' icontradict h); statement in the ‘ Canon ’ that
‘we knoyv pragtiq . r929.magmasahaszpsrienss... as one
among natural causes,’ and that ‘for reason in its practical
use’ the problem of transcendental freedom ‘is irrelevant ’
fiLIgant has therefore confused the purely natural process of
human volitTon, with the transcendental aspect of itswhich
alone entltles us to ascribe to man ‘ practical freedomT’ ; and
it is solely on this confusion that the special place he assigns
to man as a ‘ free ’ agent seems to be based. It is true that
the content of the idea, which acts as cause in volition, is
different from the content of any other natural cause; but
that content is merely the form of the cause, and diﬁerence
of form is sOmething which in no way renders one natural
’ cause more or less of a natural cause than any other. In?
deed Kant himself seems to me to have guarded sufficiently
against misapprehensions on this point by the rigour with
which he rejects the attempt to conceive as prior in time,
that which, if it; determine the will, shows that will to be
‘practically free ’1', In this rejection he is quite consistent.
" The action,’ he’says (R. V., p. 381), ‘so far as it is to be
imputed to thought ’ (Denkungsart, identiﬁed just before
with ‘ intelligible character ’), ‘ as its cause, nevertheless does
not follow from it at all according to empirical laws, that is,
so that the conditions of pure reason, but only so that the
effects of pure reason in the appearance of the inner sense,
prequg.’ In other words, that which is to be regarded as
the condition, or, as Kant calls it, cause, of the action, in so
far as that action exhibits practical freedom, giggslzot precede
“the action in time. The action is only preceded by‘th'ewconé‘;
sequence, or,‘ as‘Kant calls it, effect, of this ‘ intelligible’ conif‘
dition; and hence the action itself may be said to ‘follow
from ’ the condition, as a conclusion follows from premises,
but not to follow it in the time-order (of. above, p. 196). Now,
In the case of moral action, this ‘etfeEt,’ which produces the
action, is just the presentation of the moral law; and the
Intelligible condition of that effect is the moral law itself.
Kant himself allows that this effect or presentation must
&1ways be present in human volition ; and, what I Wish to
maintain, is that this is all that the analysis of human voli-T“
tion, as such, can ever show to be present. I have examined
the confusion upon which Kant’s contrary View that the
law Itself is somehow to be obtained by analysis of volition,
that it is given by a ‘ pure Will ’ or‘ practical Iteason,’ seems
to bebased; and that confusion seems suﬂicxent to explain
the Vlew and to show that, for Kant at any rate, it was base?

less”, It only remains to give a positive summary of the

reasons against the legitimacy of any such view.
” 3 The point at issue is this : Whether ‘ will ’ can be under; ‘

stood at all as other than a form of ‘activity ’ ; and whether,
if it be an activity, it must not be conceived as essentially
conditioned by time, and therefore, in Kant’s language, a

mere ‘ appearance - If it be 3‘4 mere ‘ appearance’ the con?"

ception of a ‘pure Will’ is nonsense ; and ‘ will ’ cannot be
ascribed as an attribute to anything realrﬁeither to God or
to the Transcendental Ego. ' ‘

..T- :That ‘will ’ is a form of ‘ activity ’ has, I suppose, never
been disputed. Kant himself, as we have seen, refers us, for
our notion of pure Will, to the pure activity of the Ego.
What is disputed is Whether psychical activity, at least, may

not be considered as fundamentally real. Our contention is ‘
th.@t._,.1.l3..§8{1199t be so, Because it is inconceivableexcept’ar"

....~

1::iavlghngmplacﬁjgihﬂﬁié:TTfat"‘time itself cannot" be conceived

to be fundamentally real is always admitted by Kant himself,
and indeed he has attempted a proof of it. How far his
proof is satisfactory, and whether, if unsatisfactory, any
other proof, isnforthcoming, is too large a question to be fully
discussed here;"°'“’-"‘I\can only state that the arguments by
which Mr. Bradley/has endeavoured to prove the unreality
of Titre” pear togmeﬂ perfectly conclusive. The question
which remamsfthen, is whether we cannot conceive a time-T
less activity; for it is to such that Kant must be referring
us, for justiﬁcation of the notion of ‘pure Willi]. That such a
conception is very djtﬁ'éﬁltftoxmaintain appears plainly enough
from the attempt of LotzeEWho assumes psychical activity to

be the fundamental‘reality, and ﬁnds himself forced, in con?

sequence, much against his will, to accept the ultimate reality
of timeﬁ}? And we have seen that Kant has nothing valid to
say for it. It is a notion which would seem to rest on a com?
bination of the notion of causal dependence between empirical

things in time, with that of logical dependence. Both are neces?“

sary connexions, but in the one case between things, in the

other between concepts. That the relation of reality toap? ”a

"it, nly ‘ activity ’ seems a misnomer for it, as great as Kant’s
' "causality’ for the same notion, apt only to create confusion.
If anything else be meant, it is to be wished it were brought
forward ; as it would then be possible to discuss it. Mean?"
while, I must be content to let the matter rest in this result :
That if the logical relation of reason to consequent, regarded
as synthetic, 13.6., holding between real objectsﬁiﬁis to be con’ll"
sidered as esﬁblished by ‘ Will’ and the type of its ‘ activity,’
then pure ‘Will’ may indeed be the fundamental reality;
but I should still protest that it would be better to keep that
word for the distinct notion which it ordinarily conveys,
instead of transferring it to another notion which has long
had a sufficiently distinctive name of its own.
"i My'conclusion, then, is this : That ‘ will’ is only a special
form of natural causality, or, rather, a naturalgcausalﬂ rm‘_
' ’Wh‘ere the cause is of one deﬁnite "'so‘r’tf'WIt is aspecia farm“
of natural causality, just as explosion of gunpowder by a
match is one special form of natural causality, and explosion
of dynamite by concussion is another. And, that on which
I wish to insist, is that voluntary action, of whatever sort,
whether autonomous or heteronomous, exhibits ‘ freedom,’ in
the sense which I have hitherto explained as essential to
Kant’s notion, no more and no less than gunpowder explo?
sions or any other natural process whatever. It seems,
indeed, strange that this conclusion from his doctrine should
have escaped the notice both of himself and others to the
extent to which it has. For he repeatedly asserts that for
every ‘appearance’ we must W intelhgiﬁle ground 4 ‘
’Tthe Ding an Sich), and it is just this dependence of the cause
(Ti—Es actions on an intelligible wund (the Transcendenm ‘
’Egb), V‘Llﬂgh die describes as constituting man’s 7“practical
"Tfeedoniil. Moreover, even the identity oFtHe Ding an Sich—I
an t e ranscendental Ego has been suggested by him and
accepted by others ; though this would not be necessary to
justify the inference, since the dependence on an intelligible
ground is by itself sufﬁcient for practical freedom. When
this is acknowledged, ‘practical’ freedom disappears alto?
gether as something intermediate between natural causality and
transcendental freedom. For, as Kant himself says, nothing
intermediate is possible ; only two sorts of causality can be
conceived at all. ‘Freedom,’ then, for Kant means only
‘transcendental freedo'm,’ and ‘transcendentalTreedom’ is nor:
WI; in the sense that it is Inseparably connected with
Want aione. It is true that actions are dependent on

transcendental freedom,’ but that is only because it is the

relation which holds between the empirical causes of those
actions and the transcendental ground of such causes.
Whether sensible objects produced effects, and so vindicated
their right to be considered practical (as they always must),
or not, they would equally be results of ‘ transcendental free‘f‘
domﬁ”.

<74" i The degree to which Kant himself was forced to recognise
the unpractical nature of his conception of Freedom, is sin?“
gularly illustrated by a passage in the ‘ Metaphysic of
Morals,’ to which I have referred above (p. 196; M., p. 23).
He here declares that ‘ Will,’ which he has hitherto regarded
as identical with ‘ pure practical Reason,’ and as that which
is M endowed with ‘ Freedom ’ in his special sense, cannot
be called either ‘ free ’hor the reverse, because it is not ‘ susi“
ceptible of compulsion ’.’, This ‘ susceptibility of compulsion ’
implies subjection to natural law, nd, as so subject, be de?
clares that human ‘ choice’ (Will I r) may be called ‘ freeZ},
He would seem, therefore, here to recognise that ‘action
can only be conceived as a time-process ; indeed he says that
‘Will’ does not refer to ‘actions’ (Handlungen) ; and it is
only because he sees that he would be departing too far from
the ordinary use of ‘freedom,’ if he disco nected it from
action, that he now denies freedom to ‘Will ._, The fact is
that his previous doctrine has already departed from the
ordinary usage, further than he himself was fully aware ; and
hence the inconsistency, with which he now tries to patch up
the discrepancy. The true way of meeting the difﬁculty
would have been, as has been pointed out, to insist on his
meaning of Freedom as the true one, and to give up the
special connexion which he had hitherto asserted between
it and human volition : to recognise that ‘ Will "'hr’ was a
mere ‘ appearance,’ and, therefore, not ‘ free,’ an that, that
which was free, had not even-so muc‘h connexion with voli?
tion as to deserve the name of ‘ Will 2:. There would, then,
have stood out clearly the problem which remains for
Kantian Ethicsﬁhow to establish a valid connexion be?
tween the notion of Transcendental Freedom and that of
End or Good.
