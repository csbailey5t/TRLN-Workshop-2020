Dear Friends:

Thank you for your letter indicating your opposition
to H. R. 1839, a prOposal to allow free importation
of Wild animals into this country.

Am sure you will be glad to know that the Senate re-
jected this prOposal on July 28th. Have always op~
posed unnecessary cruelty and suffering inflected
upon animals and certainly believe they should be
treated as humanely as possible.

Will be glad to hear from you whenever I may be of
assistance.

Kindest regards.

Lam..wf%incerely,

Dear Mrs. Megginson:

Thank you for your letter urging passage of the
measures that have been introduced in Congress
relating to the humane treatment of animals.

The Clark—Neuberger proposal is still before the
Committee on Labor and Public Welfare which has,
as yet, taken no action on the measure. Have
taken the liberty of forwarding your letter to
the attention of the Committee. Am sure that
the Committee will find your comments most help~
ful in its consideration of the measure.

Assure you of my concern for the humane treatment
of animals and that I shall continue to give my
closest attention to legislation for their pro~
tection.

Kindest regards.

i cerely,

Edward V. Long a

United States Senator

this bill applies to the free importation of birds and

concern about the humane treatment of animala, and would

Dear Mrs. LaRoche:

Thank you for your letter of August 10th with further
reference to your interest in seeing that animals are protected
frdm needless suffering when used in laboratory experiments.

As you know, the New Hampshire Legislature voted for
the sweepstakes bill, the Governor signed it, and the citizens
of New Hampshire indicated their overwhelming support for it in
March.

Since the administration of the sweepstakes program
is entirely under the jurisdiction of the State of New Hampshire,
I do believe it would be advisable for you to bring your views to
the attention of Edward J._Powers, Director of the Sweepstakes
Comm1s51on, Concord, and to Paul E. Farnum, Commissioner of Educa-
tion, State of New Hampshire, Concord, and recommend that no
funds derived from the sweepstakes be allocated to finance
bizarre experiments on helpless little animals. I am sure these
gentlemen will appreciate having the benefit of your views.

With every good wish,

Dear Mrs. Rogers:

Many thanks for your thoughtful words about my efforts
here in the Senate. Nothing is more welcome than an en~
couraging word now and then from the people back home, and
I certainly appreciate your taking the time to write me your
thoughts on some of the issues before the Congress.

I was delighted to hear of your strong support for the
proposed hospital insurance for the aged program which I
have joined in sponsoring here in the Senate. Your parents‘
spirit of independence reinforces my conviction that insurance
financed through social security would be the best way to
assist our senior citizens in meeting the spiraling hospital
costs of today. Financing in this manner puts the program on
a pay~as~you-go basis and will guarantee a minimum level of
self-financed support.

I appreciate all your efforts in support of the humane

' legislation. You may be sure that I am following s. 533

closely and have your interest in mind.

I realize your deep concern for the new Post Office,
and I want you to know that I have written to the Postmaster
General urging that this be given prompt attention. However,
in view of the current economy drive, it is doubtful that
there will be any new construction starts for some time. I
shall continue to do everything I can here in washington to see
that you get your new building at the earliest possible date.

It was good to hear from you, and I do hope that you will
write again about other questions which you may have from time
to time.

With best wishes,

Sincerely,

Dear MS. laRoche:

Thank you for calling my attention to H.R. 1839, which would
have amended the Tariff.Act of 1930 to provide for the free
importation of wild animals and wild birds which are intended for
exhibition in the United States.

On Tuesday, July 28, the Senate passed H.R. 1839 after
adopting the Keating amendment to eliminate the Hbuse language and
‘the committee amendment to provide for such free importation.

This bill now deals strictly with the question of limiting beef
imports into the U. 8.

Since coming to the Senate, I have made it a practice to
support measures designed to preserve our magnificent wildlife for
future generation of.Americans. I certainly would not want to see
these animals exposed to inhumane treatment and unsanitary condi-
tions nor conservation problems created in other parts of the
world as a result of free importation.

I am glad to learn of your deep concern for conservation
matters, and I hope that you will write again about other questions
which come before the Congress in which you have a particular
interest.

With best wishes.

Sincerely yourif

Dear mrs. LaRoche:

I was very interested in your comments concerning the
need for protection against cruelty to animals used in re~
search. As you know, legislation has been introduced here
in the Congress to provide for humane treatment for animals
used in experimental research. I am enclosing c0pies of
two hills which have been introduced in the Senate in case
you have not had an opportunity to study them. Although no
action has been taken on them during this session, I am sure
that legislation of a similar nature will be re-introduced
next year.

I personally feel that a request for a policy statement
such as you suggest would be of greater significance if it
came from those who are leading the anti-vivisection battle.
Should a strong endorsement against existing practices be
forthcoming, this would be far more effective ammunition for
the leaders who are in a position to determine the best time
for action on this question. Not being a member of the Senate
Labor and Public Welfare Committee which handles this issue,

I am rather handicapped as far as my influence on scheduling
legislation of this nature is concerned.

I might add that I have receivedﬂawgreat deal ofﬂmail
onhthis subject from Néﬁ‘ﬁaﬁpsgife and when the question of
providing the most effective prSEECtion for animals used in

 

 

 




Hrs. Madelyn LaRoche September l5, l96h

government-supported research does come before the Senate for
a vote, you may be sure that I shall keep New Hampshire‘s in-
terest uppermost in mind.

Your concern for this matter is understandable, and l
hOpe that you will write again about other policy questions

in which you have a particular interest.

With best wishes,

Sincerely yours,

Dear Ted;

a . mirlt’s'very good to hear-from you, and I'm certainly still Pete
to you and all my friends. Most of the time, in fact, I feel far
from august. Sometimes, however, as when we voted on the test ban
treaty and the civil rights bill, there is an awesome realization of
the responsibility and privilege this office carries.

should do everything posSible to re ieve” e animals who serve mankind
so well of all possible pain and cruelty and to assure them of humane
care and treatment. I have already urged,§ggggg;;ﬂill_to hold hearings
on S. 533, but I am not very h0peful of action this session because
he takes the position that EREW§BBEEW§QEQ£E£$SJ which already has held
hearings, should act first. I

The late stage in the session also is a problem, and my best
assessment of the situation is that we cannot hape for action this year.
This is discouraging, of course, but I know the effort will continue.
In the case of the humane slaughter bill, it took several years to
finally bring about enactment. I will certainly do all I can to further
progress on the legislation at the earliest possible time.

My father is not too well, but fortunately in wonderful Spirits.
I will certainly remember you to them both. I know it will mean a great
deal. Needless to say, your kind thoughts for me and my family are es-
pecially appreciated. I h0pe all is well with you also, and that we will

have a chance to get together when I am up in New Hampshire.

Dear Ms. lea:

Thank you very web for bringing to my attention your opposition
to the provisions of H.R. 1839 which would permit the duty-free impor-
tation ocf.‘ wild birds and animals for exhibition.

I certainly understard your concern and I share your thoughts
about the need for all possible protection for wildlife throughout the
world. Let me assure you of my Opposition to H.R. 1839 when it is

considered by the Senate. I appreciate very much having your views
on the problem.

With my best regards.

Dear Friend:

Because of your interest in animal welfare, I am
sure you have been greatly concerned about the provisions
of H. R. 1839, to permit the duty-free importation of wild
birds and animals for exhibition. I am very glad to advise
that when the Senate considered the bill July 28 we were
successful in having these provisions deleted.

In my judgment there was no justification for ap-
proval of legislation which would accomplish no other pur~
pose then to increase the profits of a few individuals who
import wild animals and birds for commercial gain.

Testimony at the Senate hearings, including a fine
statement presented by Hrs. Christine Stevens on behalf of
the Animal Welfare institute, gave clear evidence that the
bill would not eliminate present conditions of transporta-
tion, care, handling and exhibition which cause suffering
to wild animals and birds. On the contrary, I am convinced
that this bill would undoubtedly have resulted in suffering
and cruelty to many more animals and birds. Of great concern,
also, was the fact that the bill would surely result in in-
creased imports of wildlife and thus endanger international
conservation efforts to preserve the world's rare and diminish-
ing species of wildlife from extinction.

I was very glad to have the opportunity to vote against
this bill. Its defeat is a significant victory for everyone
concerned about animal welfare. Much more still remains to
be done, and particularly essential of course is enactment
of pending legislation to assure humane care and treatment for
animals used in research. I will certainly continue to do all
I can, and I want you to know that your support and encourage-
ment in this cause are truly appreciated.

With my best regards.

Sincerely,

need for further Federal legislation to insure humane
treatment of animals.

As you know, I have in the past voted for such
legislation, and when this legislation comes to a vote
in the Senate, you may be sure that your views will
receive my very serious consideration.

Your taking the time and trouble to get in touch
with me about this matter is sincerely appreciated.

Very sincerely yours,

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Cohen:

Thank you for your recent message expressing your
opposition to that part of H.R. 1839 providing for the
free importation of wild animals and birds. I have
read your comments with interest and appreciate having
your views on this issue.

Frankly, I was not sympathetic to any part of the
bill, either the provision encouraging imports of wild
animals and birds or the amendment discouraging imports
of lower priced meat for consumers.

I am pleased to inform you that the Senate approved
my amendment to eliminate altogether the section referring
to importation of wild animals. As a result, the Senate
voted not to reduce or alter existing tariff treatment
on imported wild birds and animals.

Because of your interest, I am enclosing a COpy of
the debate on this issue.

Very sincerely yours,

MEAT IMPORTS—WILD ANIMALS
AND WILD BIRDS

The Senate resumed the consideration
of the bill (KR. 1839) to amend the
Tariﬂ Act of 1930 to provide for the free
importation of wild animals and wild
birds which are intended for exhibition
in the United States.

Mr. KEATING. Mr. President, I have
an amendment, which I send to the desk
and ask to have stated, on behalf of my-
self. my colleague (Mr. JAVITS], and the
Senator from Pennsylvania er. CLARK] .

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
amendment offered by the Senator from
New York, for himself and other Ben-
atora. will be stated.

The Incremrm Cues. It is proposed.
on page 1. to strike out lines 8 and 9; on
page 2. to strike out lines 1 through 7,
and renumber the succeeding sections.

Mr. KEATING. Mr. President. I yield
myself 10 minutes.

We have heard a great deal about
meat, and now I want to talk about birds
and wild animals, which is what the orig-
inal bill which came over from the House
concerns. ‘

This amendment is designed to strike
out the provisions relating to wild ani-
mals and birds.

The bill before the Senate would re-
move the present 7.5 percent duty on
wild birds and animals imported into this
country that are not intended for exhibi-
tion in zoological collections for scientiﬁc
and educational purposes.

According to present law. zoos may
import wild animals and birds duty free.
The duty is only on those animals that
are to be put up for sale or proﬁt or for
exhibition for proﬁt.

In short, the bill before the Senate
would, for all practical purposes, remove
the duty on all wild animals and birds
imported into this country.

So far as I know, this proposal is ope
posed by all the conservation organiza-
tions in this country. These groups feel
very strongly about it. They feel that
present law, which removes the duty as
regards wild animals and birds for zoos,
educational institutions, and so on.
. should not be altered to make it easier
to import wild animals for commercial
Purposes.

At present qualiﬁed zoological parks
may obtain the animals and birds they

Senate

desire without paying any duty whatso—
ever. When the animals arrive from
abroad for such institutions, they are
cared for by experts who know about
their living habits and know how to
minimize their adjustment to a. new cli—
mate. These zoological institutions
which now import animals and birds
duty free, let me stress, would not be in
any way affected by the proposed legis-
lation or my amendment.

There is no question that the removal
of the present. 7.5-percent duty would
lead to a great increase in the number
of animals imported into this country.
There are several reasons why the ln~
crease in the import of wild animals is
undesirable. -

In the first place. those who are able
to acquire wild animals and birds under
this legislation are often unqualified to
care for them properly. We have all
been disturbed by the so—called "road—-
side zoos which are often fronts for un~
desirable establishments, which put out
an exotic animal to attract customers.
One suburban shopping center attracted
customers by chaining an elephant out-
side its store in the asphalt parking lot.
The cruelty inﬂicted on this animal in
the hot sun with inadequate food and
water was not considered.

Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. President. will
the Senator yield?

Mr. KEATING. I know what the Son-
ator is about to say—«this applies also to
donkeys.

Mr. MCCARTHY. They are domestic
animals and are not subject to this leg-
islation.

Mr. KEATING. It would apply if a

.wild ass were imported from Africa. for

example.

Mr. MCCARTHY. So this cruelty is
not restricted to what is done by super-
markets.

Mr. KEATING. No; that is correct.
It may even be engaged in by this body.
Mr. MCCARTHY. That is correct.

Mr. KEATING. This measure applies
to all wild animals. I picked out one
example because it was called to my at.-
tention that a poor elephant had been
chained our. in the hot sun without ade-
quate water. Comparable to that ex-
ample was the case of the elephant they
tried to stud in the back seat of a Volks—
wagon.

16578

I must emphasize what was brought
out by the recent colloquym-that it is
wild animals that are under considera~
ticm. That means that in almost all
instances these animals are. being
shipped to a. strange climate where their
habits must be completely changed.

Improper care-improper because few
people have the knowledge to care for an
African or European wild bird or ani-
mal «will be more prevalent if these
animals become available more readily
than they are. now. Why should Con—
gress make it easier for people who do
not know how to handle animals to ac-
quire them for commercial use? When
aidinals are imported they should go to
men and, women who are trained. in arts
of animal husbandry and who can care
for these animals properly. This is an
area where we need more control—mot
less control.

Mr. President, I was much impressed
by the testimony of Charles II. Calllson,
assistant to the president of the National
Audubon Society. when he appeared be—
fore the Conunittee on Finance. He em~
phasized the reasons for the opposition.
of the National Audubon Society. First.
he cited the fact that this bill would en~
courage needless commercial exploita-
tion of many species that are rare or on
the verse of extinction. l-Ic speciﬁcally
referred to the West Indian ﬂamingo. the
population of which has been reduced
from more than 100,000 birds a half cen-
tury ago to probably fewer than 20.000
today. Other birds and animals that
would be affected are the Bermuda pet-
rel. the cahow, the African elephant. the
lion. leopards. some species of snakes, and
monkeys. Secondly, Mr. Callismi empha-
sized the need to protect Arm-ricon spew
cios from birds or animals which can
multiply to the detriment of our own
wildlife. Mr. Callison’s presentation w as
fully supported by the Federation of We.»
man‘s Clubs and the Garden Club of
America.

Impressive testimony was also offered
by Christine Stevens, president of the
Animal Welfare Institute. Her pitiful
descriptions of the cruelty involved in
the trafﬁc of intelligent and sensitive
living; animals should more us deeply.
Other nationally recognized organiza-
tions which oppose the Present language
of this legislation are the Izaak Walton
League of America. the National Catholic

 




196$

Society for Animal Welfare. the National
Wildlife Federation. the Society for Ani-
mal Protective Legislation. the Wildlife
Management Institute, the Defenders of
Wildlife. Inc. I may also add, Mr. Presio
dent, that the record includes a letter
dated July 29, 1963. from Rachel Carson
who did so much during her lifetime to
alert the country to the dangers facing
our own native ﬂora and fauna.

Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President, will the
Senator yield?

Mr. KEATING. I yield.

Mr. CHURCH. I have listened with
keen interest to the argument being pre-
sented by the distinguished Senator from
New York in behalf of his amendment.
His argument is persuasive. The objec-
tive 'he seeks to serve is highly laudable.
I commend him for his effort and for
that of those he has mentioned, includ-
ing Christine Stevens. and humane or-
ganizations, which have long been inter-
ested in proper treatment for dumb ani-
mals, whether tame or wild. I believe
that his amendment ought to be ap-
proved by the Senate. I hone it will be.
I assure the Senator from New York of
my wholeheartcd endorsement and sup-
port.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
time of the Senator from New York has
expired. _

Mr. KEATING. I yield myself 5 addi-
tional minutes. I am grateful to the
Senator from Idaho for his remarks.

Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, will the
Senator yield?

Mr. KEATING. I yield to my col-
league from New York.

Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I, too.
would like to join my colleague from New
York. I was honored to be invited by
him to join as a cosponsor of the
amendment. I. too, have received a
great amount of mail, and have had per-
sonal visits and phone calls from a tre-
mendous number of nature lovers who
fight hard for proper practices with re-
spect to animal life. I hope this par-
ticular provision can be stricken from
the bill. I shall Join my colleague from
New York with great feeling of public
service in doing that, if he can possibly
accomplish it in the Senate.

Mr. KEATING. I am grateful to my
colleague from New York.

I also thank him for his cosponsor~
ship of the proposed legislation.

Before I yield the floor I wish to raise
one additional point.

There is practically no‘question about
the fact that the amount of money in-
volved is negligible. What really is in-
volved, I sincerely believe. is the ques-
tion of cruelty to animals. Many peo-
ple are not aware of the miserable con-
ditions in which animals and birds travel
when they are shipped from one country
to another. Many people are not aware
of the cramped and uncomfortable
quarters available for mam of these
creatures when they have arrived at the
point of exhibit. Many people are not
aware of the suffering of such animals
whether they be small babies separated
from their mothers, or whether they are
full-grown animals who are being sent
to a new and terrible captivity.

Mr. President, let me emphasize very

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -—~ SENATE

clearly that I am not opposed to zoos. I
have never lost an interest in zoos. which
dates back to my earliest childhood. I
have visited many zoos in many distant
cities as I am very much interested in
zoos. I know that most municipalities
and 3003 have done a ﬁne job in pre-
paring proper facilities for animals and
are making it possible for Americans in
all walks of life to see and learn more
about the animals that share this planet
with us. But the importation of wild
animals and birds. who have never
known the harshness of captivity, for
purely commercial purposes is a practice
that must be deplored by all who are
familiar with it.

Mr. President. my ofﬁce has been
ﬂooded with letters describing the con-
ditions under which these animals are
shipped, and in which they must live.
Boxes too small for the animal to stand
or lie down comfortably, dark cages in
which birds are kept conﬁned from the
light of day, unsanitary conditions with
no attendants to care for the animals.
extremes in climate which have caused
many animals to die before they reach
their ﬁnal destination, and ﬁnally, the
lack of food or water to alleviate the
hardship of travel—all these and more
privations are the fate of imported birds
and animals. who suffer miserably as
they travel from their native habitat to
conditions of caged imprisonment for
commercial exploitation.

Mr. President. I strongly urge my
colleagues who are concerned about the
rising importation of these pitiful crea-
tures to support the amendment, which
would insure that the tariffs of our great
country would not be deliberately
manipulated to make it still easier to de-
prive wild animals of their freedom and
to conﬁne them behind alien bars.

I now yield 5 minutes to the Senator
from Pennsylvania iMr. CLARK}, who is
a cosponsor of the amendment.

Mr. CLARK. Mr. President. for the
second time in 2 days. I ﬁnd myself in
a position of cospo coring an amendment
sponsored by ti distinguished junior
Senator from New York [Mr Kan-moi,
I hope we shall have better luck today
than we had yesterday.

In my judgment. the case in support
of the amendment is conclusive. I hope
that in due course the distinguished Sen-
ator from Minnesota er. MCCARTHY].
who is in charge of the bill, will be willing
to accept the amendment.

It is my understanding that the bill
is being used, to some extent, in the
manner in which a few years ago, the.
Stella School District bill was used, to
hang on it a piece of proposed legislation
which had no particular pertinence to
the original bill. Being an advocate of
civil rights. I cannot very well have any
objection to that rather odd parliam en»
tary procedure; therefore, I must con-
ﬁne my comments to the hope that the
original bill will be stricken out and that
the meat import measure will be handled
strictly on its merits.

It is my further understanding that
the bill passed the House without hear--
ings. I wonder if the distingmshed Sen-
ator from Minnesota can enlighten me
as to whether that is a fact or not.

16579

Mr. MeCARTHY. I am not certain
whether there were hearings. Some.
statements were submitted in writing,
so some attention was given to the pro-
posal, for and against it. I believe some
hearings were held in the House.

Mr. CLARK. Perhaps I was misin-
formed. At any rate, there was a hear—
ing in the Senate Committee on July 23,
1963. and we who support both the con-
servation and the humane angles of op-
position to the freeing from duty of wild
animals and wild birds imported for
commercial purposes thought the bill
had been put to rest, but now ﬁnd that it
is suddenly resurrected. I hope that the
Senate, in its wisdom, will see fit to sup—
port the amendment.

Mr. President. I ask unanimous con—
sent to have printed at this point in the
Rscoan a statement in opposition to the
bill, made on behalf of the Animal Wel-
fare Institute by Mrs. Christine Stevens.
wife of Richard Stevens. chairman of the
National Cultural Center, and a woman
whom many of us have known for some-
time as a strong advocate of the humane
treatment of animals.

There being no objection. the state-
ment was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:

Imposimmcm or WILD ANIMALS AND Bmos

(Statement submitted on behalf of the AWI
by Christine Stevens. to the Senate Finance
Committee hearings, July 23. on HR. 1839
which would pennit duty-free entry of
wild animals and birds intended specially
for exhibition whether intended to be used
by the importer or (or sale for such
purposes)

On behalf of the Animal Welfare Institute
I wish to express strong (.pposltion to HR.
1839. Our experience in observing the lam
pUrl'fttlUrl of wild animals shows that there
is much suiierirzg involved. Such importer-
tion should be made only when a serious
purpose is served and when conditions can be
iiaaintuincd to avoid needless suﬂering. To
eliminate all obstacles to the unlimited lm~
portution of wild creatures for the were pur-
pose of comn'ierciul gain is unthinkable in a
civilized natirm, and we respectfully urge the
distinguished members of this committee
to reject this bill.

In the House debate on HR. 1839, Con~
gressm'm Mums stated: “Wild animals which
would most likely be imported under the.
provisions or }.Rl!‘.lgra1)l’i 1607(b) as amended
by this bill would include monkeys. ele-
phants. leopards, lions, and snakes." All of
these [rilllIlliin‘ except {or the snakes are high-
ly developed mammals. some of them par-
ticularly the: monkeys. are nervous and scum-
tive to such a degzee that individuals will die
simply because they cannot endure captivity
-~-particulariy captivity of the kind too of ten
meted out by commercial speculators and
dealers in erotic animals and birds.

These people are. or course, getting ani-
mals now. though in lesser numbers than
they would if there were no duty to pay or
formalities to go through with customs. I
remember how eager the importers were to
discourage me from climiug a ladder into a
plane to inspect a mued load of wild ani-
mals which had arrived at Idlewiid a few
years ago. They even told me there was an
escaped .mbm lrxzse in the plane in the hope
of dissuading me. I saw no loose snakes,
but I did see how extremely hard such a trip
is or. the animals. In the cargo building a
baby chimpanzee was lying crated in a box
in which i". had to remain flat on its back
until the crate ww: ripped apart. This plti~
ful infant was being sent to commercial

exhibitor and dealer in Florida. Its fellow
had died en route.

On another ﬂight, one group of ill-con-
structed 'and overcrowded crates full of
monkeys, was destined for 'ﬁefﬂich’s. the big
pet shop and animal importer, in New York.
Assurances that these animals would be re-
leased to comfortable “ﬂying cages" immedi»
ately, proved empty. When we went to see
them the following afternoon in the upstairs

' e area which is off bounds for the pub-
lic who Visits the pet shop. we found the
unfortunate animals still in their dirty.
cramped traveling crates, in which the large
ones had to maintain a crouched position,
many oi the monkeys with untreated bleed-
ing sores from the rough treatment they
had received on their trip, and without any
food or water—in short, utterly neglected.

The dreadful overcrowding I have seen in
the crates only a few inches high in which
beautiful, brightly colored little birds are
imported, is a. similarly painful sight, To
increase this entirely needless and unjustifi-
able suﬂ‘ering by letting down such bars as
do exist. would be a retrograde action of
which our country would have to be
ashamed.

What could be gained by passage 01 this
bill? All it would do is to give a few animal
dealers an additional proﬁt. It is hard to see
why these individuals should have special
privileges "with regard to the payment of a
Federal tax.

So far from removing the tari’i on the
importation of wild animals and birds by
commercial exhibitors or those who intend
to sell to them, the imposition of stricter re.
quirements and higher tariﬂs would be more
appropriate. While we believe the cruelty
involved is the most urgent reason for de-
feating HR. 1839. the possible extinction of
rare species it this bill is passed, deserves
careful thought by this committee. too. Our
country should provide moral leadership in
maintaining the natural wonders of the
earth-«not in exploiting to the very point of
extinction any of these remarkable and
beautiful creatures. Passage of such a bill
as HR, 1839 would dismay our friends and
delight our critics in foreign lands where
our enemies like to claim that Americans
care for nothing but money.

In the House debate. it was stated that
the bill would eliminate certain customs
procedures which make the importation of
such animals and birds a diiﬁcult practice.
Humane societies throughout the Nation
have long struggled against the chronic mis-
treatment or animals in many commercial
roadside zoos. Passage of HR. 1839 would
make a bad situation very much worse than
it now is.

Free importation privileges now exist for
wild birds and animals intended for exhibi-
tion in zoological collections for educational
and scientiﬁc purposes, and not for sale or
profit. No Justiﬁable purpose can be served
by extending this privilege to those who seek
personal gain at the cost of great physical
and mental suffering by large numbers of
intelligent and sensitive living animals.

Mr. CIARK. I also invite attention to
the proceedings in the Journal of the
Fauna Preservation Society, published
in April 1964. which cites important con-
servation problems and urges the preser-
vation of adequate numbers of species of
wild animals which are gradually becom—
ing extinct. The orangutan is a good
example; the ﬂamingo is another.

This type of exploitation and impor—
tation of scarce wild animals for exhibi-
tion in commercial zoos and tourist
camps should not. in my judgment, be
encouraged by the Senate. I commend
the two Senators from New York and
the Senator from Idaho for their opposi-
tion to this part of the bill and for their
support of the amendment. :

I wonder ii’ my good friend from Min-
ne‘sota er. MCCARTHY]. who I know is
humane and a lover of animals and also
a stanch conservationist. would not feel
inclined. after conferring with the chair-
man of the committee (Mr. BYRD of Vir-
ginia]. who I know is as humane as any-
body else, and is just as much interested
in conservation, to accept the amend-
meni.

Mr. MCCARTHY. The Senator from
Minnesota and the chairman of the com-
mittee. for whom I speak, have been will-
ing to accept. the. amendment. ever since
it was offered. We could have saved the
birds and wild animals from the dangers
of inhumane treatment 15 or 20 minutes
earlier had we had the opportunity to
do so. I might. add that hearings were
not hold by the Ways and Means Com»
mil-tee on the House bill, but they were
held by the Committee on Finance in the
Senate.

Mr. BYRD of Virginia. I may say to
the Senator from Pennsyl 'ania that I
wish to save the “Byrds.” '

Mr. CLARK. It is a great pleasure to
ﬁnd oneself on the side of the birds..--
both the birds that ﬂy in the air and. the:-
Byids of Virginia.

Mr. KEATING. Mr. President, on be»
half of the birds and wild animals. 1
wish to express appreciation to the Sens-
tor from Virginia and the Senator from
Minnesota for their assistance.

Mr. JAVI'I‘S. I, too. wish to express
my appreciation to the Senator from
Virginia and the Senator from Minne~
sota. There are many who think as we
do on this subject».

Mr. MCCARTHY. The 71’: ~percem;
tariff is not adequate to protect wild ani~
mals from importation. It is merely a.
substitute for regulations which should
be in force. But in the absence of such
regulations. evidently the imposition of
this. very small tariil is sufﬁcient to dis-
courage many persons who otherwise
would bring m animals. whether there is
any market for them or not. and who
would treat them badly and in some. cases
abuse them.

In the absence of more thorough and
proper regulations to control such impor-
tation, it is my belief that the present
duty should be retained. Consequently,
speaking for myself and for the chair-
man of the committee, who is willing to
accept the amendment. I ask unanimous
consent that the amendment. be agreed
to.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. With-
out objection. the amendment is agreed
to.

Dear Mrs. Hale:

Humane treatment of animals is. of course. a moral
obligation of any civilized society. I know you will agree,
as well, that legitimate scientific research is a process
which we should encourage. I nevertheless share your concern
in the matter of animal experimentation and I thank you.for
your recent letter expressing this opinion.

When Congress adjourned last fall. it left several
bills before its committees dealing with regulation of
government-financed research projects where animals must
be used. I will certainly keep your views in mind should
any of these bills come to the floor of the Senate for a
vote.

Thank you once again for your letter.

I am not a member, advises me that it has not as yet scheduled

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Westall:

Thank you for your letter expressing your strong
opposition to H. R. 1839, which would permit the duty-free
importation of certain wild birds and animals.

As you know, this bill passed the House some
time ago and has been favorably reported to the Senate by
the Senate Finance Committee. It is now on the Senate Calendar
awaiting action.

Since I am not a member of the Senate Finance
Committee, I have not had an opportunity to study the bill, but
I assure you that before it comes to a vote I will give the
Committee's report and your objections full and careful con—
sideration.

Again thanking you, and with all best regards,

Sincerely,

Please disregard my bulletin of July 30 relative to provision
in H.R. 1839 which Would have permitted duty free importation
of wild animals and birds to this country.

My bulletin to you was late, but I was late getting it.

However, the efforts of others were successful and I quote
below one of the replies I have received to numerous letters
I wrote prior to sending out the bulletin to you:

("Dear Mrs. Boyce:

"Thank you for letting me know of your organization’s strong
objection to the provision in H.R. 1839 which would permit
the duty~free importation of certain wild birds and animals
for exhibition.

Although final action has not been taken on this legislative

Dear Miss Rall:

Thank you for writing me giving me the benefit of
your strong views in opposition to H.R. 1839-

It appears to me that I completely agree with your
views Opposing eliminating tariff barriers on wild animals
and birds imported for commercial purposes.

Certainly non-profit educational and scientific
organizations, such as municipal zoos, should not be re-
quired to pay import duties.

This privilege should not be extended to profit-
seeking animal dealers who may, and usually do, show little
regard for the health, safety and humane treatment of these
animals or for the preservation of wildlife.

Ybu probably are aware of the fact I am a co-author of
the pending bill requiring humane treatment of animals used
for experimental purposes.

Sincerely yours,

Thank you very much for writing me.

elimination of tariff barriers on wild animals and birds imported
for commercial purposes. This privilege should not be extended
to profit-seeking animal dealers who may, and usually do, show little
regard for the health, safety and humane treatment of these animals

It no doubt has come to your attention that prior to
the passage of H.R. 1839 in the Senate early this week, an amendment
was adopted to eliminate the House language that would remove the
7.5 per cent duty on wild birds and wild animals imported into this
country that are not intended for exhibition in zoological collections
for scientific and educational purposes.

I appreciate having heard from you.

Dear Friend:

Thank you very much for your letter of July 27.

I know that you will be as pleased as I was that when
S. 1839 passed the Senate, it did so without the provisions regarding
the imports of wild animals which disturbed you.

With regard to the second point you have raised, I am
advised that the Senate bills regarding humane treatment of labora-
tory animals are still being considered in Subcommittee. However,
as this session draws to a close, it would be my hope that the Senate
would be given the opportunity to vote them up or down and you may
be sure that at such a time as the matter is raised on the Senate
floor, I shall keep firmly in mind the views which you as well as so
many other Oregonians have expressed to me on this subject.

Dear Miss McKenna:

Mr. Bill Mooney of Ludlowy Massachusetts, was in my office
last week to report on some of the activity in your area in
support of legislation for humane treatment of animals used in
scientific experiments.

Mr. Mooney was advised that prospects are not bright for
action on the legislation in the remaining weeks of this session
of’Congress.

Before another session begins, I hope that all interested
groups will concentrate their efforts on Obtaining hearings'before
House and Senate Committees on humane treatment legislation. I
have been concerned over the fact that members of humane organizations
hare been engaged in somewhat heated debate on what the bills contain.
It seems to me, that the place for such discussion is at a committee
hearing.

1 am writing to you because Mr. Mooney asked me to send you a
memorandum on the current situation.

Dear Mr. Smith:

I share your opposition to the section ofﬂELWELngggmwhich
will permit the free importation of wild birds and wild animals.
This will merely add stimulus to over—commercialization in the
marketing of wildlife, and thus endanger the future existence of
some species. I trust that you have written to the Senators from
your own state, as well as to your Congressman.

As you know, legislation to impose quotas on beef imports

was added by the Senate Finance Committee as a rider to the House-

\

passed version.of H. R. 1839. I am.fearful that some harmful anti—

conservation legislation may be enacted as a vehicle for protecting

Mo»—

the domestic cattle industry. It ould be unfortunate if a few
traders in wild animals were to be the residual beneficiaries of a

bill whose primary political motivation is solution of meat import

problems. I thank you for sharing your views with me.

Dear Mr. Weston:
Thank you for your postcard.

As chief Senate Sponsor of the legislation providing for
humane treatment of laboratory animals you can be assured that I
will do all that I can to see that it is enacted. I am hopeful
that it will come before the 89th Congress.

I co-sponsored, and spoke strongly in favor of, an amendment
to strike out those sections of H.R. 1839 eliminating the import
tariff on wild birds and animals. I am pleased to advise you that
the amendment was accepted by the Senate, and that the present imr
port tariff will remain in effect.

Sincerely yours,

Dear Miss Doxrud:

In reference to your note, on July 2a the Senate passed
H.R. 1839 by a vote of 72 - 15. I voted against the bill
because I question the wisdom of establishing rigid quotas
on the importation of meat. Regretfully the outcome was
not more favorable.

With best wishes.

Finance Committee on June 2 of this year.

I assure you that in the event H.R. 1839 is called up for
consideration by the Senate I shall be mindful of your very
cogent argument in opposition to the free importation pro-

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Mays:

Thank you very much for your recent letter concerning cer-
tain bills currently pending before the Congress.

I note your opposition to certain provisions of H. R. 1839 re—
lating to the importation of wild animals and birds. As you may have
learned, the Senate approved this measure, deleting from the House—
passed version those sections pertaining to animals and birds. The
bill is now before the House of Representatives for a second time, and
no further action has been taken.

A number of measures relating to the use of animals in sci—
entific research have been introduced in the Senate and House of Repre-
sentatives and have been referred toathe Labor and Public Welfare and
Commerce Committees reSpectively; to date, however, neither Com—
mittee has acted on its bills. Although I am not a member of the Labor
and Public Welfare Committee, I am glad to know your views on the
matter, and I shall want to bear these in mind in the event this legisla—
tion comes before the full Senate. '

The Wilderness Bill, S. 4, has now passed both Senate and
House. There are differences between the two versions, and it is ex-
pected that a Conference Committee will meet to resolve these differ—
ences in the near future.

I appreciate your taking the time from your vacation to ad-
vise me of your interest in these matters.

With best wishes, I am

Dear Jeannie:

Please excuse the delay in my
reply to your letter of July thirtieth.

When H.R, 1839 was before the
Senate, we adopted an amendment which deleted
the objectionable provisions to which you
made reference.

I do not know what attitude the House
of Representatives will take concerning the
matter, but I will certainly speak to some of
my old colleagues about it.

Despite the efforts which have been
made the Chairman of the Senate Labor and
Public welfare Committee has given no indication
that he is willing to schedule action on the
Clark-Neuberger bill.

Jennette joins me in sending best.

Thank you for your July 24th letter about several
matters pertaining to conservation.

H.R. 1839 would allow free entry into this country of Wild
birds and wild animals which are intended for exﬁbition. No
date has been scheduled for this bill to be brought up on the
floor of the Senate. If it does come up for a vote, however,
I'll certainly have your comments in mind.

When the Wilderness Act passed the Senate in April of
1963, I supported it. Since that time, it has been held up
in the House of Representatives. The House version was just
reported out of the Interior and Insular Affairs Committee
the beginning of this month. It is impossible to predict
when it will be voted on by the entire House membership.

I have noted your other comments and shall keep them
in mind if pertinent legislation should come before the

Senate for a vote.
Sincere—W

WARREN G. MAGNUSON, U.S.S.

Kind regards.

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Garnett:

Thank you for your recent communication giving me the
benefit of your thinking on proposed legislation which
would regulate measures for the supervision of medical
research involving animals used in experiments.

As you may know, there have been many bills introduced

during this session. At present, these bills are pend—
ing both in the House and Senate where they are await-
ing Committee action. I am making a careful study of
all of these measures and you may be assured that I will

keep your views in mind should one of these bills come
to the Senate Floor for a vote.

It was good to have your comments and I send my best
wishes.

Dear Paul:

Thank you for letting me know of your opposition to
that provision of H. R. 1859 which allows free importation
of wild birds and animals.

This legislation was recently reported from the
senate Finance Committee with an amendment restricting imports
of meat. .Although I supported the restriction on meat imports
I also strongly Opposed the wild animal import section of the
bill which was eliminated by a Keating amendment.

You can'be sure that I continue to be concerned over
the inhumane treatment of all animals.

Dear Mr. Alstrom:

Thank you for your letter concerning legislation to provide
for the humane treatment of animals used in the experiments
and tests by recipients of grants from the United States and
by agencies of the U. S. Government.

Bills intended to treat this specific area have been referred
to the Subcommittee on Health of the Senate Labor and Public
welfare Committee. There are no hearings scheduled as of this
date.

The expected September adjournment by the Senate and House will
likely preclude consideration of most matters not now already
scheduled for consideration.

I understand your concern and I appreciate having your views
on this matter. You may be sure of my careful and thorough
consideration of any legislation of this type which may be
scheduled for action.

Sincerely yours,

It was good to hear from you again.

I am glad to know of your objection to that
portion of H.R. 1839 which would permit the free
importation of wild animals and birds. It does
not appear that the Senate will be considering this
bill for some time yet, as there are several other
measures scheduled for prior consideration. I assure

I thought you would like to know that H.R. 1839
was called up unexpectedly Monday evening.

This measure was passed last night after

provision for the free importation of wild animals

Dear Friend:

I deeply appreciate having the benefit

bill, and S. 1041, the Randolph bill, concerning
the humane treatment of animals used in research.

I have heard from a number of people

Dear Mrs. Leavitt:

Thank you for your letter of July
twentyufirst.

The Senate Labor and Public Welfare
Committee has not taken any action on S. 533,
the legislation involving animals used in
research.

Although I am not a member of the
Subcommittee before which this bill is pending,
I have urged the Democratic leadership to
consider it. The Committee, however, has
been involved in the President's anti-poverty
bill and is presently working on education
legislation.

I am glad to have your views on this
issue and you may be sure Ishall have them
in mind and will continue my interest in it.

Sincerely y>urs,
