I_. This work aims at providing carefully veriﬁed information
by experts on the subject of” man’s treatment of animals.

2. It is not a volume of propaganda in the ordinary sense. It does
not aim at harrowing the feelings, but at furnishing an equip-
ment of knowledge for the use of those who are opposed to
the inﬂiction of cruelty.

3. It maintains the high standard of the preceding volumes
published in 1931, 1933 and 1935 respectively, which were
received with enthusiasm by the medical, scientiﬁc and edu-
cational press as well as by the humanitarian journals.

Volume II .

"This extremely valuable year-book, which should be read by every-
one who has not thought it worth while to deﬁne in exact terms what his own
View of suffering in animals is, surveys a wide ﬁeld . . . . The sentimental
appeal is everywhere avoided, and no traces of bigotry can be found in the
book.”-—The ﬁlaneheslei/ Guardian.

"It is an important and accurate work of reference to all those who
are interested in animals.’ ’-——Bi/itisli Medical journal.

”The volume is avowedly propagandist, but rarely is propaganda
presented in a manner so perfectly calculated to engage andto hold the

iritgr'éévt' of the"?é3dé?j“£§id"to‘étimulai‘éEEEE'ti‘caféylnpathymwith‘lh‘ewiirork . ’ '
—The Birmingham Post.

‘ ’Carefully documented facts, simply stated, carry constant conviction.
”The year book is propaganda of the most deadly kind.”—State Service.

Volume III .

“The year book is a most valuable and interesting compilation present-
ing in handy form much information that could not easily be secured else-
"where in short compass.”——]‘v1anehestei/ Gaai/dian.

‘ ‘The Animal Welfare Society associated with the University of London
is tackling this matter from the higher rungs of the educational ladder. It
has discovered a department of sociology which has been neglected in its
scientiﬁc aspect even more than the rest.’ ’~—Biiminghani Post.

“The editor of this interesting annual, C. M. Knight, D.Lit., must be
congratulated on the excellence and variety of the material contained within
its pages . . . Its objects are most praiseworthy . . . . We trust that many
of our readers will secure a copy of this year book and so help on the excel-
lentrwork which this Society is undoubtedly performing in the cause of
.animal welfare.”—Medieal World.

‘ ‘All lovers of animals should read this book . . . a very attractive,
interesting and instructive volume.’ ’——The Listener.
