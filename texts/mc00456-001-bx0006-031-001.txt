THE STEEL—TRAP ATROCITY
VIEWED IN THE LIGHT OF
[CATHOLIC PRINCIPLES

 

THE STEELeJAWED TRAP—the common
steel=tyrap now in universal use—inﬂicts
upon defenseless creatures needless suf=
fering. This wanton inﬂiction of cruelty
upon fur=bearing animals is entirely un=
necessary for the satisfaction of man’s
needs.

Such unnecessary and unwarranted
cruelty to animals injuriously affects the
character of the perpetrator—is in con=
ﬂict with the design of the Creator and is
therefore to be condemned for moral as
well as humane reasons.

‘. The time has come to end this atrocity.

HAS THE CATHOLIC CHURCH A SET OF PRINCIPLES
TO GUIDE THE FAITHFUL ON SUCH 'MATTERS?

THE CASE AGAINST THE STEEL TRAP .
The humane trapping law advocated by the Anti-Steel-T rap League,

- .Inc., a national organization, to be passed in every state of the Union

has raised a very interesting and important question which is now being
asked on all sides, namely, “What is the position of the Catholic Church
on measures of a purely humane nature?” Or to put it in another way:
“Has the Catholic Church a deﬁnite body of principles for the guidance
of the faithful on the general subject of CRUELT Y T O ANIMALS?”

Needless to say, and strange though it may appear to some, the Catholic
Church has on this question—as on all other questions of a moral nature——
a clearly deﬁned attitude which she expects and demands her children to
assume in their treatment of brute creation.

CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA

In deﬁning the Catholic attitude on the subject of CRUELT Y TO
ANIMALS the Catholic Encyclopedia speaks in part as follows:

“The Literature of monastic life in the Middle Ages, which so largely
formed and guided the moral sentiment of the Christian world,” as Lecky
sets forth with ample evidence, “represents one of the most striking efforts
made in Christendom to teach a feeling of kindness and pity towards
brute creation.”

“ . . . The Scholastic theologians condemn the inﬂiction of needless
suffering on animals chieﬂy because of the injurious effects on the char—
acter of the perpetrator. Thus St. Thomas in his Summa Contra Gentiles
(Bk. I I, ch. CXLL) says that it is sinful to be cruel to brute animals ‘lest
anyone by exercising cruelty towards brutes may become cruel towards
man.’ Elsewhere St. Thomas states that God’s purpose in recommending
kind treatment of the brute creation is to dispose men to pity and tenderness
for one another. While the Catholic theologians rest their condemnation
of cruelty to animals on its demoralizing inﬂuence, the general teaching
of the Catholic Church concerning the nature of man’s rights and duties
furnishes principles which have but. to be applied in order to show the
direct and ESSENTIAL SINFULNESS OF CRUELTY TO ANIMALS,
irrespective of the results of such conduct on the character of those who
practice it. It is indisputable, that when properly understood and fairly
judged, Catholic doctrine DENOUNCES CRUELTY T O ANIMALS AS
VIGOROUSLY AND AS LOGICALLY AS DO NON-CATHOLIC
MORALISTS.

H

inﬂiction of pain on brutes, it is not necessary to acknowledge that brutes
have rights. Our duty in this respect is part of our duty to God. The
very essence of the moral law is that we respect and obey the order es-
tablished by the Creator. ~ We are bound to act towards animals in a
manner conformable to their nature. We may lawfully use them for our
. wants and welfare—but the WANTON INFLICTION OF PAIN IS NOT
A SATISFACTION OF ANY REASONABLE NEED, AND, BEING
AN OUT RAGE AGAINST THE DIVINELY ESTABLISHED OR—
DER, IS, THEREFORE, SINFUL.”

CATHOLIC DICTIONARY

Following closely along the same line of thought the Catholic Dic-
tionary, under the general heading—CRUELTY TO ANIMALS—says
in part:

‘We are bound for our own sakes not to inﬂict long and keen suffering
on the brutes. If we accustom ourselves to see animals tortured, we are
apt to become hardened even to human sufferings, and we SIN 1n exposing
ourselves to such a danger.”

CARDINAL ZIGLIARA (Catholic Philosopher)

“When man with no reasonable purpose treats the brutes cruelly, he
does wrong because his action conﬂicts with the order and the design of
the Creator.” (Philosophia Moralis, 9th Edition Rome, P. I 36)

FATHER BILLUART (Noted Catholic Theologian)

“A man who puts brutes to death 1n a cruel manner, SINS by abusing
his power as master and lord. For by such cruelty a man accustoms him-
self to be cruel to his fellow men.’ De. Justitis XA I.

CANON LYONS (The Catholic Mind, Dublin)

“Cruelty to animals isrepugnant to right' reason. Why? Because
it offends against the order ordained by God. And because such wanton

‘, conduct argues a perverse end or purpose. And because it easily degen-
' erates into cruelty towards human beings. IT IS A SIN THEN TO

TORTURE, TO MALTREAT, TO STARVE OR OVERWORK ANY
OF GOD’S ANIMAL CREATION.”

FR. .1). J. CORMICAN

“He who is cruel to the helpless brute is likely to oppress the widow
and orphan. . . . Kindness'to animals begets kindness to our fellow man.
And the reverse is also true. Kindness has a magic power. It bridles the
demon in others. It makes hearts grow young as heads grow old. Kindness
is the sunshine of life. It brings out the good qualities in our neighbor.
AND SO ANYTHING WHICH PROMOTES KINDNESS TO THE
DUMB ANIMALS DESERVES THE HEART Y COOPERATION OF
CAT HOLICS AS A'STEPPING—STONE TO FRATERNAL CHARITY.”

ADDED TESTIMONY

St. Mark was a guardian saint and protector of animals. St. Godric
of England was celebrated for the protection which he lent to all animals.
Cruelty to animals was intensely repugnant to St. Francis of Assisi.

Saint Francis’ love of God extended to animals. They seemed to see
in him the image of Jesus. The horses, cattle and birds responded to his
call. Passing near Bevagna he saw a number of birds in a tree: he called
and as, they approached him he preached this sermon:

“My little brothers, you ought always to love and praise your Creator
for His goodness to you. He has given you feathers and wings with which
to ﬂy wherever you please. He made you ﬁrst of all His creatures, and
preserved you in the ark with Noah. He. has given you the spacious and

 




beautiful region of the air for your dwelling. He nourishes you, so that
you have no need to sow or reap, or to take the least trouble to ptbcure ..
your food. He has given you the trees for your nests, and He watches over
your young ones. Therefore, for all these reasons you ought constantly

to praise God.” Pope Benedict XV contributed 2000 liras to the
Italian Society for the Protection of Animals and also‘sent a letter-
to this society, through the then Secretary of the Papal state,-
Cardinal Gasparri, IN WHICH HE SCATHINGLY CONDEMNED
THE USE OF TRAPS WHICH CAUSED UNNECESSARY SUFFER=
INC! TO THE ANIMALS CAUGHT IN THEM. Cardinal Gibbons

was vice-president of the American S. P. C. A. and this ofﬁce is now held
'by a member of the American Hierarchy—Cardinal Daugherty.

TRADITIONAL CATHOLIC ATTITUDE

Thus it can be seen that the Catholic Church by its traditional teach-
‘ ings and practices is resolutely opposed to the inﬂiction of wanton and
unnecessary cruelty to the defenseless creatures of the brute creation.
AND THIS IS ALL THAT THE PROPOSED ANT I-STEEL-TRAP
LAW AIMS AT.

A humane law will not prohibit the trapping of fur— —bearing animals.
It has nothing to do with the false sentimentalism and erroneous principles
‘which actuate extremists.

The only purpose of the proposed law 15 to do away with cruelty by -
compelling a substitution of humane traps for the steel— ~trap—traps which
mercifully kill the animals outright or catch them alive unhurt.

Consequently, this question should receive the serious consideration
of Christians and it would seem to be their duty to materially aid in
promoting the interests and in securing the adoption of this humane '
measure.

THE CASE AGAINST THE STEEL TRAP

One hundred million fur-bearing animals are trapped every year on the
North American continent, according to “The Fur Trade of America,” by
Agnes Laut, historian of the Hudson’s Bay Company.

The vast majority of these warm—blooded and sensitive creatures are-
tortured to death in the cruel steel-trap, which is a pair of Steel jaws
operated by powerful springs. The jaws snap upon the animal’s leg,
frequently breaking the bones, and as the creature struggles to escape
the steel bites deeper and deeper into themuscles and tendons, causing
excruciating pain in the imprisoned leg, ﬁnally resulting in spasms of
suffering that engulf the whole nervous system. ,

To this intense and unremitting pain are added the horrors of fever—
thirst, the pangs of hunger and often the rigors of bitter cold. This con-
tinues for many hours, frequently- for many days, until the animal dies
from the bludgeon in the hands of the trapper, or from sheer pain and .
exhaustion. Most of the furs worn are obtained at the price of untold
suffering by God’s wild creatures, due to the type of trap in universal use
