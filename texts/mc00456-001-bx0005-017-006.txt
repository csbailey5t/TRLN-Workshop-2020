September, 1946.

Dear Sir,

I have great pleasure in sending you the first Report of our
work published since the beginning of the War: War conditions having
made it impossible for us to issue our usual Annual Reports. This Report
contains only a short outline of our activities from 1959 to 1945; so
much have we accomplished under great difficulties.

You will appreciate, I am sure, that we have not spent much
money on the production of the Report, as the abnormal expenses during
the past stormy years, have made a heavy demand on our resources.

That we have been able to continue and even further to establish
the P.D.S.A. is due to the generosity of our subscribers, and to them we
still look for support to enable us to help the suffering Animals in the
future. And, once again, I am confident we shall not look in vain.

During the last few months we have been relying on our Flag Days
to relieve the pressure of our needs; but most unfortunately the weather has
greatly reduced the results of our efforts. Especially was this the case on
our London Flag Day, when it rained so heavily that our loyal but disappoint—
ed workers were obliged to return to their Depots for shelter - it being too
wet to remain in the streets.

It is very difficult to thank you adequately for your past help,
and also to ask for your further kind support in these days of stress and
anxiety.

I can only say that, as with human suffering, the suffering of
the Animals never ceases, and more than ever is the P.D.S.A. needed today.

I am,
Yours very truly,

. U 5‘
