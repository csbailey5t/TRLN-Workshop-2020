ANOTHER BLACK EYE FOR BERGH.

Mr. 381111011133 Employe Pulled Officer Snowden's
Starboard Leg and the Jury Virtually
Said He Did Right.

W

The pair of gas jets ﬂickered dimly in the 01d
oaken Town Hall at Hempstead, L. 1.. yesterday
afternoon When the Court of Special Sessions again
took up the trial of William Thompson for inter-
fering with Oﬁicen‘Snowden, of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

The six jurors took their seats on a. front bench.
looking grave and holding tightly on to their hats.
The day was dark and chilly. the wind howled across
Hempstead Plains and the pouring rain prevented
the farmers from working. But nothing interfered
to keep them away from the court room. They
came by the hundreds, and with the villagers ﬁlled
all the seats and every inch of standing room.

The prisoner Thompson appeared in a spik and
span new suit, with his grayish hair cropped closely
and his stubby mustache dyed very black. Coun-
sellor Elliott. the special attorney for the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, made the
opening address to the jury in behalf of the people,
and stated that the prisoner was charged with a
misdemeanor under section 668 of the Penalwode.

Justice Clowes was compelled to lift his silvery
voice to warn the laughter loving audience that or-
der must be preserved or the room would be cleared.

THAT smunonnn LEG.

The ﬁrst witness called by the prosecution was
Superintendent Hankinscn, of Mr. Bergh’s New
York cities, and he told the story of last Saturday’s
events on the ground of the Hempstead Coursing
Club, as has been published in the HERALD. He ac-
knowledged that Mr. August Belmont, Jr., handed
to him an oﬁlcial programme of the coursing which
contained the following clause in very red lulu—-
“The ofﬁcers and assistants are cautioned positively
to see that the rabbits not instantly killed by the
dogs are to be immediately destroyed by

striking them on the back of the neck,
and to see that no cruelty or mutilation
- be permitted. By order of the committee.” Mr.
: Belmont had told the witness that day that he pro»
‘ posed to course rabbits, and had ordered the pins
oner (Thompson) to release a rabbit from the box.
Uilicer Snowden, acting under orders. placed his
foot on the box, and the situation was then quite
thrilling. Thompson stooped down, pulled the of-
ﬁcer's leg and attempted to open the box. Thompson
was arrested for assaulting and interfering with the
oﬁicers. It was the starboard leg which was
"pulled." But Snowden did not put it in as evi-
deuce.

The questions of opposing counsel brought out a
, good deal of fun, and this induced the Court to raise
his clarion voice and cry out, “If any man makes
more noise than the law allows he will be put out.”

ALL FOREIGN TO THE ISSUE.

Ofﬁcers Clark, Snowden, Drew and Gay, 0: the
society, were also called to the witness stand, and
corroborated Superintendent Hankinson’s testimony
in the main points. There was no end, of evidence
about rabbit coursing, but very little about the
point of issue—namely, interfering with and assault-
ing an ofﬁcer. Oﬁicsr Snowden did not limp, and
was compelled to acknowledge that the prisoner did
not hurt his leg.

When the superintendent was asked "Was there
any violation of the law in having rabbits in the
box?" he answered “Yes. There was cruelty about
to be attempted by releasing rabbits where dogs
were ready to chase them."

A lively passage of words occurred between Mr.
Elliott and Mr. Weller when the attempt was made
to have Mr. Hankinson admit he knew that rabbit
coursing had been declared to be not cruelty in a. re-
cent casc in that very court.

, The argument was very warm, and Mr. Downing,
for the defence. followed with a speech full of rare
oratorical ﬂowers. He threw back his head and,
raising both arms in dramatic gesture. exclaimed :—

"He nagced on beeple to resist him and proclaimed
that he could not get justice in Hempstead." This
referred to Superintendent Hankinson’s action.

Finally the Court decided that the question must
not be admitted. There the prosecution rested, and
an hour was given the stranger for dinner.
‘ At the evening session Judge Weller addressed the
; jury for the defence and claimed that there had
1 been no violation of the law.
‘ NOT cnUEL BY ANY MEANS.

German Hopkins, an Englishman in Mr. Belmont’s
employ, was brought in as a. witness to show that
rabbit coursing was not cruel, when an hour’s spat
occurred between Counsel Elliott and Downing.
He was an expert for the defence, and ﬁnally was
allowed to go on. The effort of the risoner's
counsel was to show that the dogs usual y bit the
rabbits in the breast or back, and that death was
instantaneous. No method of killing rabbits was
less cruel than coursing. These iacts Hopkins testi-
fled to. and that he loved the sport and believed it
1101th be cruel.

‘ e witness was prett badly twisted u _
Elliott, and when the lattZr objected. to thepwgn‘ggs
telling how they do it in England because "we had
our own laws here.” there was loud applause in the
audience and snnles on the faces of the jurors.

The opposmg counsel afforded considerable amuse-
1118;1th their cross ﬁring and gave the boys great
dehsht. Finally. the constable'was obliged to lock
the doors, With the noxsy youngsters on the outside.
The disappointment of the debarred youths was
manifested by lively howling in the street,

Mn. BELMONT’s EVIDENCE.

Mr. Belmont then took the stand and told how
l he had read the rules of the Coursing Club

committee given above to Superintendent Hank-
inson on the ground wherein all employés of the
clubwere ordered to kill the rabbits instantly. He
admltted that he had ordered the release of the
rabbit on Saturday last premeditatedally, but the
hrst rabbit which he ordered Thompson to let loose
was to be given its liberty. He took the advice of
counsel before going on the ﬁeld.

Mr. Belmont gave his testimony in aclear and

[SPECIAL TO THE wonLD,]

HEMPSTEAD,Dec. 11. —And the heavens opened
and the ﬂoods‘descendcd, and the winds blew,
but the good people of IIcinpstcad were not
shaken, but kept on coming into court to sm-
what would become of the wicked man who
pulled Oi‘ﬁcer Snowdon’s 10;; Saturday. Indi—
rectly, the cause of the Bergh men against the
rabbit coursers was at stake, so all the 8.1). C. A.
army and all the Belmont men were on hand to
take part in the battle. Mr. Justice Clowes,
whose conduct of the various coursing cases has
called out the highest comment from good
judges of how such things should be «loi_1c,inovcd
to-day’s hea1~ingojnto the binr room of the beauti-
ful mauve Town Hall on Front street. This
gave more room for everybmly. T be jury of six
lined up on a big settcc like the rushcrs of a
football eleven, and with the witnesses for half-
backs, the counsel for quarter-backs and Mr.
Justice Clowes himself for full-back, with all his
bearded dignity, play was callwl at 3 o‘clock.

Lawyer Elliott opened the game with a ﬁne
run into the enemy’s territory. during which he

 

 

explained that the culprit. William Thompson,
did then and there pull the leg of Oi‘llccrl’or-
3 man Snowdon, of the S. P. C. A., in direct vio-
lation of section 068, chapter ~17. of the Penal
Code as amended by the statutes of 1888. The
pulling was done, he said. while Snowdon was
guardinga crate of rabbits brought out for
coursing.

Supt. Hankinson. of the S. P. C. A., was:
sworn, and told all about the log-pulling from i ,
his standpoint. Two men working under Mr. ‘
August Belmont’s orders carried a crate of‘

rabbits out into the ﬁeld.

“Mr. Be‘lmont's said they were to be hunted

with dogs,” said Mr. Hankinson, ”and I told
him that it would be a violation of the law. lie
said he would go ahead, and I ordered my mm
to guard the. rabbits, and lr-t none: be taken out.
He ordered Thompson to take out a rabbit. and
Thompson grabbed Snowdmi bythc knee and

i pulled. Then he was arrested. ”

3 Under cross-examination by Judge Weller the
witness declared that he knew nothing: about
the rules of coursing, but it was cruel work,

i anyhow.

! Q. Even if the rabbit escaped and was not

, killed by the dog ‘2 A. Yes; to hunt it with dogw

l .

i 1s cruel.

i It was shown that no dogs were in the ﬂuid at
1 the time, and the defense tried to bring out the

fact that the present arrests were the result 01'

malice in the face of Mr. I-lankinq—‘on’s acknowl—

edged statement that he know in: IlC‘l‘d not (X-

pect to get justice from a Heinpstcml jury. Mr.

Elliott objected to this line of cross-examina-

tion. His argument was solid and bi < grr'ill'l‘exs

were long, low. swinging iippi:1‘-('111H with the-

right and stra1ghi, lush ‘nnwbcs with ilw li-i't.

CAUSED BY A RUBBER BAND.
One Placed around a. Klurse‘u Ear
fanned the Organ to Roi Off.

A short time ago a ﬁne roan horse owned by
the Flatbush Avenue l‘tailroad became affected
with a sore ear, which caused the
animal intense pain. As .«rlon as
the stableman discovered it he reported
the matter to SuperinLendent Lllorrison.

l who had the animal placed under treatment.
l This. however. did not seem to give the horse
1 any relief, and the organ continue-i to swell
until it became almost twi. e its normal size.
On Monday the ear droppe l 011' at 3.15 an int-n
' above the head. l'pon era. lination Superin-
tendent -‘lel‘l'erll found that the cause of the

decay was a small rubber band which had l

been placed on the animal‘s ear.

The Society for the lr’revenion oft"'rtie1ty to
Animals has been noti‘ied, and its ot‘licers are
in search of the lniscreant who is the cause of
the cruelty.

This latter table includes the work done by
the branch in this city, which is under the
management of Superintendent Frank 0.
Clark. The report for the year .1880 shows that
139 arrests were made and. iii-l. convictions ob:
tained. At the close of the year there wasbut
one case pending in court. Three hundred.
and nine disabled animals were relieved from
work and 000 animals sick or dinbled beyond
recovery were humanely destroyed. (in addition
33 Suffering from glainlcrs or farcy were shot.
Three cows and 150 small animals were also
destroyed. One hundrol and thirty-Jive ani-u
inals were removed in the society’s ambulance
and 380 complaints received and investigated.
" The tlmrougli investigation which each and
every complaint brought to Mr. Clark’s notice
undergoes before the persons accused are
prosecuted in court, or even. censured, is
plainly demonstrated by the fact that the so:
ciety lost but .3 cases out of 13:).

perhaps, from an empty tl'UCk that might be

present at the time. , ,

“ Ofﬁcer De Nyse. of our Seeiety. is also
there pretty much every day and at 11011138.
when the truck travel is heaVIest. that is
from about 7. 30 to 10 A. M. and from 4. 30 ,
to c P. M. De Nyse has made reports to me 9
at different times of the trouble there and
has made several arrests and lines were ini-
posed in court. We have had some little
difﬁculty in getting convictions. lor this
, reason, a truck would get stuck getting up
3 that hill and people looking on would de-

clare it was overloaded. while in reality on
a level it would be an easy read. When, a. ,
case of this kind comes before a Police
Justice we are put out of court because we
cannot show that the truclr was overloaded.
Ateam of horses can easily run off onﬂa
level with a load of 4,500 pounds, while
they would struggle and tug to get 53.000
pounds up that hill. '

' ‘ As to the suggestion of the correspond-
ent that a— hill—horse be stationed at the
ferry, 1 would: state that some menths ago

President llaiues, of our Society. went to
the Ferry Company and 5 min: to them about
having a tow-horse placec there. The Berry
Company made a good argument against it.
which was that if the drivers knew there
was always a. tow-horse on hand to help
them up thehill With their loads they would
3pile on a bigger load, so that instead of
. assisting the truck horses it would be hurt—
. mg them. because on the level they would

 

 

 

 

I haven much heavier load to draw.

n.__ ...,_

l have suggested, and do so again now,
that the Ferry Company ﬁnd a special offi-
cer, whose duty it should be to see that the
horses are not put upon. 11' our Society had
larger means at its command we would only
be too glad to have an officer there always.

" it is all very well for the correspondent
to say take elf-some of the load at the "erry

.gates. but directly we did that the Ferry

, Company and the public would be down on

l
l
l

us for obstructing the passage in and out of
ferry-house. it seems to me that a special
ofﬁcer, with full powers, would soon correct
the exrsting evil. In a few weeks the truck-
drivers would know just what they might

' expect if they overlaxedorbeat their 1101‘888.

A good plan is this: ‘ he business man who
owns a team of truck horses wants them to
be beaten or o’ﬁerstrained, so that whenever
a driver lS_Ca11l2'llt-'ia.8lllll£f up his team. re-
dort him at once to hiseniployer,’ ” ;,

be put upon or .

1883. when Pilot and (‘ribh fought. was be-

Jersey‘s champion. Barney. A match for
$400 a. side was made five weeks ago. the
agreement being that each canine should
weigh twenty-eight pounds or less. Last
Saturday night was agreed upon as the time

HENRY BERGH FORCED OUT

~ " ' THE s. P. c. A. - :

 

BOARD

OF MANAGERS~MR. BEBGH OFFERED THE.

ALTERNATIVE or SUBMISSION OR
RESIGNATION: . ‘

Henry Bergh has been forced to resrgn the
pl’E‘Sidéncy of the Society for the Prevention (it
Cruelty to Animals, Which was founded by 11.19.
uncle twenty-three years ago. His successor in
the ofﬁce is James M. Brown, 0f Brown Brothers
&. 00.. bankers. The change Was made on Mon"
day at an executive session of the Board of Man-1
3861‘s, thirteen members being present—Elbl'ldge T“
GBI‘I‘Y. the Rev. Dr. Morgan Dix, W- 0' schermer-r
horn, Alfred Wagstarr, N. M. Beckwith, Charles
Lanier,’ James LI. Brown, Parke GOClW'lD, George
G. Haven, Horace Russell. Edward A. Hammond.
James Grant Wilson and George G- De \Vitt. Jr‘
Mr- Berg-11’s resignation was accepted unanimously ’
Mr. Brown was elected without- a dissenting V9139
and the lucky or unlucky thirteen, after passmg
a. few resolutions and adepting a new ‘05“va
shook hands and went their several Ways. agrEeing
one with another to keep perfectlY quiet about
the whole business.

The new by-law was the lever with which}
M15 Bergh Was ousted,“ and the fulcrum under
this lever was Superintendent Charles H. Bankin-
son. Physically, Mr. Bergh is a small man, a
cabinet—size photograph of his uncle, as it were}
and, moreover, he is young} having, as a member
of the Board of Managers remarked, much to
learn. But the same by-laws which made the
founder of the society an autocrat made his
nephew a dictator, and the latter used his power
in a way that caused the Board of Managers
to believe that he abused it. This Board is com-
posed of twenty-three men in the prime of life-<
the ten vice~presidents of the society and the
thirteen members of the executive committee—«
and it has been galling to them to be dominated
by so young 3. man as Henry Bergh.

Trouble was brewing for several months. The
youthful president, weak in himself, but strong
under the constitution and by—laws} seldom did
the members of the Board the honor to consult
them in regard to the management of affairs,
and this seeming neglect, which began by breed-s
ing dissatisfaction and discontent, ended by giving
offence. “ This young man is too domineering,“'
agreed the Board. “ 'He must be taken down a
peg or two; his power must be lessened. We
shall change the by-laws so that they will give

us some control. We should like to be consulted.
We are Willing to be ruled by the founder of the
S. P. C. A., but as for being run over by, the
nephew, that Is a different matter.” .
While th1s discontent was being well digested
President Bergh, oblivious of the impgndingi
hurricane, discharged Superintendent Hanidnson
as he thought, for cause. The Board of Managers;
was not consulted; it was informed, however-D in
the course of orchnary business that Hankirison
had1 gone. This action was taken about three
weeks ago, and 1t settled affairs as quickly as an
egg settles coffee. Such rossure was put on Mr
Bergh that he_ reinstate Hankinson and thd
superintendent is again in his accustomed place.
TheBoard men hastened to change the by-laws.

assumed a more serious aspect than a trivmlex-
' hibitlon of maliciousness or an animated ex-
change of uncomplimenlary epithets Hum (1mm
recently, Then the gravily of the dilliculty was
attested by the narrow escape of the resuients
lhcrcabouls from death by poisoning. ‘ ,

T110863 unneigbborly neighbors are Mrs. Sophia
Hopkins, of 267 Moll‘altstrcct; Mrs. Helena HMS-309
Moll‘alt street. ; Mrs. Amelia Schmidt. 1371 ““6““
street, and Mrs. Charlotte Miller, 277 Moﬂ'att street.
.Belwcen the last two houses 18 a larl:C open 30‘ m
which-the chickens belonging to each 01 the
women except Mrs. Schmidtlhave been wont to
while away the hours in characteristic Sportive-
ness. The tribulations of this lively quartet have
invariably been ventilated in court and reciprO-
cal binding over to keep the peace was the result.

Aﬁhirs finally reached that stage when each had
the other under bonds. Then they resumed their
original antics. Threats are said to have been
liberally exchanged. but none were apparently put»
into execution until the chickens belonging to all
except Mrs. Schmidt began to show evidences of a
peculiar ailment and dmp offrapidly. Mrs. Miller
lost thirty-live in one day and the others nearly
as many. In each instance the symptoms were
the same. The bird's legs seemed to be suddenly
and nnexplicably paralyzed, after which it laid
down and gracefully gave up the gh ’Sl- Early in
November Mrs. Hopkins slaughtered a pair of
birds and utilized their carcasses tor a Sunday
dinner. The meal was heartily partaken ofby the
family and nothing unusual occurred until about
10 o’clock the same night, when each of the diners
was attacked with violent cramps in the stomach
and continual retelling. The conclusion was then
arrived at. that the chickens had been poisoned,
and a survey of their erstwhile stamping ground
on the open lot near by was taken the succeeding
day. The result fully justified the su3plcions.
Several small pieces of bread and a quality of
corn were found covered with a green substance.
The analysis to which it was subjected proved
that the green substance was no other than arsen-
idc of copper, probably known better as Paris
green. Mrs. Hopkins made known her discovery
to Mrs. Miller and Mrs. liar-is, and after carefully
putting their heads togelher they determined that
Mrs. Schmidt was. alone respoxniblc. Antagonism
had been rampant among the four, but as the
three had formed a pronounced combination
against Mrs. Sclmiidc,3_tliey concluded that she
adopted that means ofot’lisctting the advantage
given them by numerical superiority.

Superintendent Frank 0. Clark, of the Society

for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, was
notified and be detailed Olﬁccr Dc Nyse to investi-
gate. Dc Nyseivisited Mrs. Schmidt, obtained, as
he claims, a clean breast over her own signature
and then placed her under arrest. She was tried
yesterday ailernoon in the Gates avenue police
court. , Counselor George F. Elliott conducted the
prosecution, while Counselor Kramer looked after
the defense. Mrs. Schmidt- had demanded a trial
by jury and that was accorded her. She is
dark complexioned and slimly built, not
over preposscasing in appearance and was plainly
but neatly dressed. She exhibited no signs of a

seemed to rather enjoy the proceedings.
Mrs. Hopkins appeared in the role of chief ac-
cuser. She was very determined and looked «.lago
gcrs at Mrs. Schmidt. She described at length the
summary dos-patching of her chickens and the pe-
culiar sickness in her family, and added that. she
strongly suspected Mrs. Schmidt, though she had
not seen her handle the poison or boner her fowl.

strain. 3 Then Oiﬁcer De Nyse described his visit to
the l‘CSldCllCC of the accused.

“ I went to her house on the afternoon of No-

vember 3,” he testiﬁed, “ and told her that. com-

plamts had been made against her for throwing
poxsou about and poisoning the chickens. She

said she might as well admit the truth that. she did

do it by lelllg'3l’ul‘lS green with bread and boiling

HEMPSTEAD. L. I., December 8.

The attempt of the members of the Meadow
Brook Hum-[to have a coursing; Contest at the .
Plains this afternoon was prevented by the 50'
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
with ﬁfteen ofﬁcers in charge of Superintendent
Hamkinson. The representatives of the select
Four Hundred were out in considerable force
and feel greatly Cllagl'ined at this inter—
ference with their sport. There were pro 5-
scnt R. W. Stewart, Mr. and Mrs. S. S.
Sands. R. D. Winthrop. Mr. and Mrs. V. R. Ken-
nedy. E. L. Herbert, August Belmont, Jr.. Fred-
erick Hoey, Bliss May Bird, Miss l—Iarrimrin. I’crcy
Hoyt and Mrs. Earl Do lgc. The ofﬁcers arrived 3
on the scene early. When a box of rabbits ar-
rived they surroundcdit and one ofliccr sat on
the cover. When t-ht.‘ hour for the sport to begin
arrived the dogs were in readiness, but when the
slippers approached the rabbit box they were for-
bidden to touch it under pain of arrest. Mr. Del-

mont became angry, but could not help himself.
The dogs were kenncled and then Mr. Belmont
mfdercr"l William Thompson, his grown, to open
the box and release a bunny. Mr. Thompson pro-
ceeded to obey with a acriiy. Two ofﬁcers laid
hold of him and he was declared under arrest and
taken to the jail at Hmnpstead. There being no
way to get at the rabbits the hunt members and
their lady fl‘lClllls' (llil‘llhf‘nm‘l the outrageous con-
duct of youngllr. Bcruli from their positions on
horseback and in carts and drugs. l
Mr. Belmont was at his wit’s end how to circum- .
l vent the ofﬁcers, and an order was given to bringr
rabbits from his house in the pockets of his serv-
ants, so that there should be some fun. any how.
The ﬁrst rabbit to arrive was let go, and Edward 3
Kelly's white and tan (loo: lesolutc and Mr. 1ch-
7‘ lnont's black, white and tan bitch were soon in
pursuit. lcsolutc caught and killed the game in
43 seconds. The officers Were away oil in the
ﬁeld when this performance took place and could
not interfere. In some way lI-rwhinson got the
‘ tip, and, being armed with a search warrant, he
; sent two ofﬁcers to Mr. Bwlmout‘s country house
3 and seized alltherabbita found tin-re. Mr. 1121-
mont made up his mind to have coursing at any ,
i cost. He ordered a rabbit brought on tlu- ground.
sot lllO dogs ll'solm‘c and Tiara ‘n-asly for slip—
ping, called out to the oilivcrs: “I'll show you the
course," and oil went the rabbits. The dogs Wi-rc

Mrs. Bridget Roddy, who claims to own the

{93' «1 yesterday afternoon in the most

_. lble and inelegant style that she is the
ssessor of a very ﬁery temper.
i” let ire was aroused by the presence in her
1 l backyard of a pigeon 000p owned by one of
1 her tenants named Michael Durham, who has
; . Lresided in the house a number of years.
1 Some time ago Mr. Durham‘s irritable land-
Lady began .to complain about his feathered ;
spots, of which were about sixty, but according f
”to . is story he never received a formal notiﬁ. f
.‘ cation from her to remove them from the l
.- premises. ’

thathe would get rid of the birds as soon as
’ giglsesible, and otfered a number of them for
. In this way he had disposed of all but about
-a,l dozen, among which were several
"very young ones which he intended
to sell when old enough. Mrs.
Reddy did not seem to think that Mr. Durham
was getting rid of the pigeons fast enough, and
.to hasten matters thought she would
take a hand in clieposing of them
herself. So yesterday afternoon she pro-
cured an ex and chopped the supporting post
from under the coop, bringing it to the
‘ground. ‘7}?9 then took several of the l
young birds out of their l " l
and stamped their lives out With
her foes, and after telling ~Elli: Durham that i

’ she would dothe same to him if he dared in~

I splinters, which he did with artistic grace.

These cars run along Smith street. and also
to «Hamilton Ferry. Many of these ever-
worked animals. I have noticed. have
been driven for weeks With these
terrible running sores on their
breasts. I have also noticed, as have my
men. that in most cases nothing has been
put between the sore spot and the collar, or
when done it has been in suchacareless
I manner that in most cases the padding has
. slipped and been perfectly useless. _ .

‘ ' When we ﬁrst noticed this condition of
things. ” continued Mr. Clark. “I Went
directly to Supt. Sullivan. of the Company.
as I thoucrht if he was apprised of the tact
he won d immediately take steps to I
prevent its recurrence. Buninstead Of that. i
matters went from bad to worse. and you ‘
can see the result. In the major-

, ity of cases the horses must have
, suffered the most intense pain. as the
breasts of nearly all were .111 the same
condition as the one from which this collar
was taken. Undoubtedly there are many
more of them equally as bad. and we pro-
ose to turn out every one we ﬁnd. In fact.
shall make a personal inspection of all the
car horses of the different companies, and
where I ﬁnd any of them in a. disabled or,
lame condition I shall act as I have in this ‘
instance.” l

tor of a riding academy on Pamﬁc street. “ (2
was charged with cruelly treating ahorse. A_
the close of the examination his Honor not only
acted as judge, but to a certain extent became a
witness as well. '

Mr. Gerlach was charged by M1" Edward?-
Simmons, or" 122 Park place, With splll'l‘1n¥.a
horse until its sides bled. The complaining u it-
ness was backed by the Society for the Pl‘u-
vention of Cruelty to Animals, the counsel
of which, Mr. George F. Elliott. 5.1131791?“ ‘
for the prosecution. Mr. Simmons testlﬁed That
on June 30 he saw Mr. Gcrlach riding abay

’horse on Sixth avenue, whence the latter turned
into Sterling place and entered the FleetWOOd
Stables. There the horse’s mouth, WhICh was
bleeding. was spouged out. Blood was also trick-
ling from the animal’s sides, in which several
wounds had been made by squS- After that, the ,
witness continued, Mr. erlach mounted the l
horse again and rode to his stable on Paciﬂcd
, street, using the Spurs and pulling on the lines
severely enough to cause the animal 110181“? a
trail of blood spots in its wake. The witness was
subjected to a cross examination by Lawyer
O’Brien and the court, during which he said he
had had some experience with saddle horses,
having kept one for several years.

Dr. Plagcman, a veterinary surgeon, of Sterling;
place, testiﬁed that he saw Gerlach inflict unnec-
essary cruelty on the horse. He said that he had

trained horses in this country and India and
rarely had occasion to use Spurs at such times.
He did not think it necessary. He said that he
was a member of the Society for the Prevent-ion
of Cruelty to Animals.

Mr. Gerlacli then took the stand and said, in a
voice pitched in a high key, that he had been a.
horse trainer for forty years and never treated an
animal cruelly in his life. The horse he was ac-
cused of treating improperly was, he said, a vic-
ious one, and harsh treatment was necessary to
keep it from running away. Such treatment was
not cruelty.

“Do you mean to say,” interposed Mr. Elliott.
“that digging the spurs into the horse’s sides
and pulling on the bit in the way the witnesses
say you did, drawing blood, was not cruelty ‘2"

“I do; it was not cruelty, it was horseman- '
ship.”

Dr. Burns, a veterinary surgeon, of 100 Adams
street, who is employed by Gerlach, testiﬁml
that he examined the horse in question and
could ﬁnd no traces of any wounds upon it. If
any had been made ﬁve days previously he would
have seen them. He knew the horse. It wasa

yielous one. ,

“In your acqua'ntance of nine years with Mr.
Gerlach have you ever known him to treat a horse
cruelly ‘2” asked Lawyer O’Brien.

Lawyer Elliott objected to this question, saying
that if such a line of testimony was to be
admitted he could bring 100’citizcns to prove
that Mr. Gerlach was the cruelest man in Brooklyn
toward horses. The question was admitted and
Dr. Burns replied in the negative. ‘

Dr. Plagcnian, recalled, said that an injury.
such as was describe: in tliiscase, could be healed
in twenty-four hours. He was asked if Mr.
Gerlach was a member of the society, and said

that he did not know.

Gerlach-was recalled and asked this question
by Mr. Elliott:

“Were you ever arrested for cruelty to animals
while youwere a member of the society?”

'01:,"1nter3ected Justice Patterson, “the society
never prosecutes its own members.”

“I never treated animals cruelly,” said Mr. Ger-
lach, answering the question. ,

This conpluded the direct testimony. and
.fléiﬁgﬁgf’etterson began delivering himself as i

“I have never spoken to Mr. Gerlach in my 1m.
but I know him as a great horseman '
tationstands the highest in the country. 1' have
seen lmn ride-this identical horse, and know the
horse to boa particularly vicious one that could
no be ridden w1thoui spurs. I have a. little
horseknowledge myself and know that Mr. Ger-
lacli is a great horse trainer. I think if the
society would turn their attention to the race
., tracssand stop the cruelty to horses practiced

there, it would‘pay them much better. Horn-vol.
on the evidence here, I must ﬁDer C'ml 11’
guilty and ﬁne him $1.” ‘ . ' “A AL I

he would immediately take steps to
Prevent its recurrence. Buhlnstead of that.
matters went from bad to worse. and you
can see the result. In the major-

suffered the. most intense pain. as the
breasts of nearly all were .111 the same
condition as the one from which this collar
was taken. Undoubtedly there are many
more of them equally as bad. and we pro- ,

‘ ‘ Well. possibly it has. I think the strap .1

our own continent. all are invited to become
members of the New York WORLD’S Little
Defender Society.

NEED OF SUCH A SOCIETY. -

Noble-hearted boys and tender-hearted
girls are being constantly shocked by the
cruel treatment which they see bestowed
upon unfortunate creatures that either have
no home or have strayed away.

Cats are stoned and worried and dogs are
chased. kicked and abused.

It is all very dreadful!

And then there is the great number 0f
patient work horses that we see driven along
the streets. chaﬁng under rough. worn har-
nesses and tugging at loads much too heavy
for their strength. while their cruel drivers
urge them on with kicks and blows.

These are onlya, few of the street sights
that 1.11864? 0111‘ eyes every day. We cannot
tell of all the fearful things that we see—the
poor crippled beasts~the helpless. harmless

creatures that are made the victims of cruel
boys and men.

Is it not time that a.
pic was organized to d
making these things less common ?
.. But what can be done ‘2” yen ask.

How are boys and girls to prevent his.

burly. brutal men from misusing and 8th“!!-

01' course. no little boy or girl can go up to
a burly truckman or cahdriver an d iemon-

there is something that can be done. and it :5
this: Take the number of the driver. or of
the truck. and report the case to thehocmty
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

 

 

WHAT CHILDREN CAN Do.
Some very interesting stories are told of

little children who have reported cases of.

cruelty to the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals.

A little girl went to the ofﬁce one day With
the number of a truckman whom she had
seen kicking his horse.

When the Society’s agent went to the man i
he said: i

my horse, but I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to
kick him. butI got mad ”———

Thus. you see even a little child can be of
help in this kind of work.

The Society has an agent in every city
and will always investigate a case that is re-
ported. no matter how small may be the
little boy or girl who reports it.

Now I take it that so far as the actual ar-

of it. He based his claim on a standard
rule. The Cocker's Manual. the game-fowl
authority, recognizes only ﬁve sets of rules.
namely.the New York. the Philadelphia. the
Southern. the Western and the English.

Jamaica Man, Arrested and Fined. ‘ l

A young heifer, the most'pitiable specimen!
of that description of animal conceivable,

stood in front of the Town Hall at Jamaica
yesterday for several hours. She was coated

culated to excite profound DitY-

unfortunate heifer.

thereby hangs a. tale.

For some time past it had been known that
a man named Paul Hoffman kept three cows

‘1 in‘a shed on South street. that were not

properl cared for, and It was reported

Board of Health of the village should act in
the manner, but no complaint was Eever ﬁled
and the scandal continued. At length it was
decided by some of the neighbors to invoke
the aid of the New York Society for the Pre-
vention of Cruelty to Animals. Accordingly
the ofﬁcers of that institution were notiﬁed,
and yesterday Alonzo S. Evans, of 456 West
I Twentieth street, New York, and William
Denyse, of 415 Fulton street, Brooklyn,

agents of the society, appeared in the village
l and paid a visit to the wretched cow stable.
A warrant was sworn out against Hoffman

 

» and he was taken before Justice Brush. One i
of the animals, the heifer already referred '

to, was taken up to the ball, so that his
Honor could see for himself how that one, at
least, was kept. ,

"he complaint alleges that Hoffman did
“Wilfully, unlawfully and wickedly torture
and torment certain living creatures, to wit:
three cows, by conﬁning the said cows in a.
small shed while the said cows were in a
ﬁlthy condition, being covered with ﬁlth,
and the shed being also in a ﬁlthy condition,
and did cause thereby to the said living
creatures unjustiﬁable physical pain and
suffering in violation of the statute in such
case made and provided."

“What have you to say to this charge?”

asked the J udue, after he had read the com- ,

plaint to the prisoner.

“Not guilty,” he said.

. “When will you be ready for trial ?” asked
the. magistrate.

“Well, I vill change dot," said the prison-

er. “I plead guilty.” '
_ The magistrate thereupon ﬁned him $10, or
in default ten days in the county jail. Hoff-
man said he would pay the ﬁne on Saturday
and was allowed to go.

The stable Where the poor animals were
conﬁned is on the Sayre property on South
street. Hoffman lives in Puntine stteet, and
at one time had his cows on his premises
cooped up in the back yard. But the neigh-
bors forced him to move them. He then put

them in the little shed where the ofﬁcers
found them.

cated in Woodhaven south, was complained
of as a foul place, the worst of it »
being that the cows conﬁned there were '
niilch cows, fed on the vilest swill, and that _.
their milk was sold to consumers. The
officers found the place fully as bad as rep-
resented. The proprietor, Luke Horstman,
who owns a big farm, of which the offensive '
stables form a part, was highly indignant

who seemed to take so deep an interestin his
affairs, and he said he would get the better
of them though he had to spend $1,000. An
investigation by the ofﬁcers showed that
Horstman kept twenty-two cows conﬁned
in a dark and unventilated stable laden
with mephitic odors emitted from a mass of
ﬁlth several inches deep on the ﬂoor, which 7‘."

attack is altogether unwarranted, and is based
on personal animus towards me. It is not true.
as he alleges, that our club is the onl * one 111
the country that courses rabbits Wit dogs.
There are four others. He claims that the sport
of coursing rabbits with fox-terriers is unknown
in England. That is not true. For the act
ﬁfty years rabbits have been coursed With w 1p-
pets in England, and fotherriers have been
used for the same purpose for the past eight
years. To make the pomt absolutely certain I
cabled to Mr. P. C. Astley, of England. one o
\ the most eminent sportsmen known. He cabled
in reply to-day that coursmg both for pom Us
and catching to kill With fox-terriers has been
practised in :England for the past eight years,
andno conviction for cruelty has ever been had
against those who practise "the sport. The
trouble is that Mr. Peshall is a3v1olent member
of the Seeiety for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, and everything he‘says on thesubiect
of coursing 1s tinged With his preiudices.
Furthermore. he has a strong animus against
me articularly because of his mistaken posmon
on t is Gordon setter question some years ago,
which caused him to Withdraw in a huﬁ as a
delegate to the American kennel Club. I was
Pres1dent of the Club at that time. ” 3
Mr. Belmont said at 12 o‘clock to-ni. ht that

rabbits at Mr. Belmont’s barns that were destm ed
for the ﬁrst meet two weeks ago. J u_dge Weller

RABBIT—COURSING.

Some Information for People Who Decry l
the English Sport. l

To the Editor ofThc World -'

Among your “Echoes from the People” a
person styling himself ” British Sport” has
spoken to you as an authority on rabbit-cours-
ing of the Hempstead Club and elsewhere. His
ignorance, which I will by the following point
out to you, does not entitle him to the signa-

ture.

1 N0 British sportsman would be guilty of such
gross ignorance on the subject he was treating.
The coursing. which “British Sport” refers
to, With the whippit, is. quite a diiferent one
irom the regularly established fox-terrier cours-
ing in England, which I will explain after ﬁrst
dISpOSlIlg of the whippit-coursin referred to.

iThe colliers of. the north of lngland own a
dog calleda whippit, which is a cross between
the greyhound and the bull terrier, and has
become practically , a breed, as stated by

British Sport.” They live in a hotbed of
cock—ﬁghtinrr, dog-ﬁghting and ingilism (and he
forgot to add rattbaiting),modelling their court:-
mg upon their ideaso this latter indulgence.
They course the rabbit purely with a View of
killing him.3 Their coursing consists of slippina
their whippits from a canvas slip in the she e of
a narrow, we Will say lane, to give a sinor e di-
rection to therabbit, and the contest is between
the dogs killing the most rabbits. It‘is thi‘s‘

nestion alone which controls their sport viz 1‘
t 0 dog that kills the most rabbits; and their
matches are made on the basis of the most

, kills. we Willvsay, out of ten, ﬁfteen or twenty-

Progress of the Grout Trial in the 01d Oak Court
Room, Whore Learned Counsel Sat Sur-
rounded by the Fashion of
Hompstoad.

VERDICT—“NOT GUILTY.”

_._——-

 

The sun blazed brightly on Hempstead Plains yes-
terday. The Cathedral spire glistenod in his rays.
The little rabbits peeped undisturbed from their
burrows.HA single guest was clasped to the Stewart
Arms. Bishbp Littlejohn sat long over his luncheon.

In the meantime the preparations for the trial of
Messrs. August Belmont, J r.; Winthrop Rutherford,
Frederic 0. Beach and their two servants. Reardon
and Doty, had proceeded rapidly. There have been
spectacles more dazzling to the eye, more gorgeous
with jewelry and more attractive to grOwn up chil-
dren than that which Was exhibited at Hempstead;
but perhaps there never was a spectacle so well cal-
culated to strike a sporting and reﬂecting mind.
Every step in the proceedings carried the mind
either backward to the days whén the foundations of
thef S. P. C. A. “were laid. or far away over, the
boundless plains to Old hayseed natives who drank
applcjack with their left hands and bet their bottom
dollar on Flora Temple and Fashion.

THE TOWN HALL. _

The place was worthy of such a. trial. It was the
great wooden Town Hall of Hempstead; the hall
which has resounded with the acclamations of thirty
political conventions, and once witnessed the just
sentence passed on Lydia Thompson’s calves.

The main street was lined with buggies. The
roadway was full of mud. The farmers, in their
vestments of homespun, attended to give advice on
the "crops.” Nearly a. hundred and seventy boys
jammed the gallery.

Sheriff Jones made proclamation. .“The people of
the State of. New. York against'ﬁelmonafﬁlitherfOrd
Beach, Reardon and Doty.” They advanced to the
bar (a common deal table) and bent their knees.

THE CULPBITS.

The culprits were indeed not unworthy Of the
great presence of Lord Chief Jusiice of the Peace
Valentine Clouds. They looked like great men and
not like bad men. ‘Belmont—~ smalLbur not emu-
ciated, deriving dignity from a. carriage (a dag cart)
which, while it indicated deference to the Court,

indicated also habitual self-possession. Rutherford— ,

a high and intellectual forehead. a brow pensive, but
not gloomy, and a. Seymour coat. Beach—a. face
serene, on which was written as legibly as under the
_ great picture in Stokes' art gallery Ecce homo.
, _ THE COUNSEL.

Their counseiéfilcoompanied them, J udqe Weller
who,“by histalents and learning. made matters ut:
terly u. ‘py for the other side. But neither the
culpri ' nor their advocate attracted so much
notice as the, 'accusers. In the midst of a
painful silence, andto the right of the bench sat
the ofﬁcers of the S. P. C. A. who had made, the
arrests, with Henry Bergh IL, sad-eyed
and Quixotic like his uncle, at their head
And there, tOOw was Counsellor Elliott of

WHAT MR. BERGH SAYS. . _ ,
“There has been so much criticism of this SOCIBtY 5
action in regard to the recent meeting of the Hemp-
stead Courslng Club,” said Mr. Berah to 1118 yester~
terday, “that I feel called upon to aa)‘ 8 l
few words also in eXpIanation of our po- 1
sition on this question. There assembled. at
Garden City on Wednesday a number of 89(11th
people who seem to covet the further distinction of
being called sporting men, to Witness what 18 called
a rabbit coursing match. gotten up under the aus-
pices of the club to which many of them belong. .
“It seems natural for us to inquire, under the err-
cumstances. what was their object in being there?
Was it for any necessary or useful purpose or was it
withaview to the wanton inﬂiction .of pain and 1:,
death upon a number Of defenceless animals merely
for their own entertainment?
“If it were with a view to aid in the extermination
of rabbits, we naturally ask why, after having
caught andnplaced them in cages, were they again
let loose and allowed a possible chance to escape?
“Before our ofﬁcers put an end to the proceed-
ings those who enjoyed them had the satisfaction of
seeing a. little animal, while trying to escape, caught
by two dogs, one of which seized it by the
head and the other by the hindquariers and
actually pulled it to pieces, the head being torn oil”
and the body fearfully lacerated. and it was in-
tended to submit scores of others to a similar fate. ,;
A SIMPLE QUESTION OF CRUELTY. {a
"In equity as well as in the eye of the law the ques-
tion Of the position of the creature in the scale (1'
animal existence has nothing whatever i) do
with the case so far as the question Of
cruelty is concerned. Let us remember that the
same power that created us brought animals into i:
being. That it is necessary to take their lives for the
purpose of food or because they are noxious or
destructive no one can deny, but is it too much to
ask that they be killed without the inﬂiction of need-
less agony?
“The late Dr. Chalmers said:—‘The beasts of the
ﬁelds are not so many automata—they look and
tremble and give forth every indication of suil'er-
ing as we do. Theirs is the distinct cry of pain.
theirs is the unequivocal physiognomy of pain.
They put on the same aspect of terror on the demon-
stration of a menaced blow. They exhibit the same
distortion of agony after the inﬂiction of it
The bruise. or the burn, or the fracture, or the
deep incisson, or the ﬁerce encounter Wllh one of
equal or superior strength just affects them simi-
larly to ourselves. All this is palpable to the gen-
eral and unlearned eye, and when the phys- l
iologist lays open the recesses of their sys-
tems by means of that scalpel, under
whose operation they just shrink and are convulsed
as any living object of our own species, there stand
forth to view the same conductors for the trans-
mission Of feeling to every minutes: pore upon the
surface.” ’
"The hunter who uses his gun or other methods
of securing game, which inﬂict mutilation upon the
animals, has the valid excuse that there is no other
more human wav of securing them for a perfectly
legitimate object—to supply the human race with
food or clothing. The butcher destroys life for the
same reason. In neither case is it done for the pur—
poseof inflicting suﬁ‘ering and death merely to sar-
isfy'ghgrnorbid cravrng for amusement.
“The main cause for complaint would appear to
be that this society has interfered with the enjov—
ment of a number of wealthy people and treated
them precisely the same as others who violate the
law under which we act.
"The sooner these people and 1heir friends under-
stand that we propose to do our duty without fear
or favor from any one the better for them. and that
if there be any leniency shown it will be to the man
whose time is occupied in earning a. living and not
_ 111 killing animals merely for the sake Of enjoying
the sight of their dying agonies.”

IS HE INCOMPETENT?
Sevoral Conlpiaints Received About
/ ; Pound Keeper Stratton.
w.» 2-... ; Several complaints have been received re-
‘ ‘ -- 2 cfmtll’by Inspector Frank 0. Clark, of the So-
ﬁle” for the Prevention of Cruelty ro Animals,
st Pound Keeper Stratton, who is employed
2 2 2 by the city to take charge of the tramp canines
‘ " ] .fQund running at large in the public streets,
., " {'18 either negligent in the discharge of his
duties or incompetent to properly perform the
york asked of him.
If the statements of the dog catchers, as well l
:4 as of several persons residing in the immediate ;

vicinity of the pound, which is at the foot of I

Budge street, go for alight, then Mr. Stratton’s
method of doing busrness is dec1dedly of a
very slow order. ’

-Yesterday morning Inspector Clark was
called upon to shoot a dog which was sutlering
from injuries received from being trampled
upon by other animals during its conﬁnement
in the dog catcher’s wagon. Mr. (Illark, upon
F looking around, found another dog similarly

aﬁected, which he ordered drowned. Upon

further inquiry he elicited the information
that when the beast-burdened wagons arrived
\ at the pound they were kept waiting for from
three to ﬁve hours before an effort was made
by Stratton to receive the dogs.
One dog catcher informed Mr. Clark that
one day not long since he was compelled to
wait from:8 o’clock in the morning until 3:3
O’clock in the afternoon. Another said that
on Tuesday last he experienced a wait of ﬁve
, hours, during which time two animals died in
I the wagon, and although not his fault, Keeper
; Strattou refused to pay him for them.
in the face of these facts it is a great wonder
that the death rate is not much larger. From
all appearances it begins to look as if Keeper
Stratton was a triﬂe slow, as the facts of the
case seem to justify the assertion, as he alone
is responsible for the long waits which the dog
catchers are unjustly caused to undergo. ‘

Inspector Clark says that if he hears of any
more like occurrences he will certainly prose-
cute Keeper Stratton for cruelty to animals. 3

Some of the complainants were of the opin- l
l

    

 

 

   

 

 

 

   

ion that .Keeper Stratton is entirely too old to "
have charge or the pound, and his dilatory ‘
; methods are due to old age rather than incli- . ‘
’ nation. '3

IﬂIe Is Not? Serving Sixty Days in the
Penitentiary.

Joseph West, a colored stablcman,of Charles-
ton, 5. 0,, in the employ of C. l). McCoy, of
the same place, Was on trial before Justice
Sutherland, of Concy Island, yesterday,
char-89d by Mr. McCoy’s trainer, J. B. Slack,

- Jr;-, with haying kicked about the head and

1 otherwise injuring one of his employer’s thor- 3
. z . oughbred horses, several of which are stabled
I'\ at the Sheepshead Bay racetrack.

‘ . ‘ According to the statements of the witnesses,
west threw the horse to the ground and than
proceeded to use his pedal extremities vigor-
ously onth'e animal's head, the result of which
is an ugly and painful out.

After his Honor. had lectured the prisoner
severely. hegave hull hischoice of paying a
"ﬁne of $50 or, servmg sixty days in the peni-

. tentiary. As West was not possessed of the"
nose ary amount of cash, he was handed over
to \ arden Hayes.

The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals prosecuted West. This is the ﬁrst
caeepf theirs tried before Justice Sutherland,

Famous Fox Terriers - How the Animals
Are Cared For.

“ 3e quiet, Lucifer! Less noise, Rachel I"

August Belmont, J12, president of the American
Kennel Club, and the proprietor of 1313c: Blempton 1n
kennels of “fox terriers, was showing some of his
choicest specimens to a visitor.

"Less noise, Rubicon. Mr. Hopkins will YOU
take Lucifer and Rachel and Rubicon and
Brilliant out on the chains? I want to Show them
to their best advantage.”

Manager German Hopkins, a sturdy, bearded
Briton, touched his hat, and in ten minutes the
particular favorites of the kennels were tugging
away at their chains in the barn, making heroic
but iniudicious attempts to get at an imaginary
hare sori‘iewhere outside in the yard.

Mr. Bclmont’s Blempton kennels are situated
on his country place in the Village of Hamp-
stoad, L. In and ﬁler“ are so wonderfully 00m"
plete in all their details that they attract atten-
tion even in that center of canine culture. Not Yr

\ only are they the most complete fox terrier k611-
nels in this country, but they are also the largest C

Mi“ lielu‘mnt 11% GVGI' been an ardent lover of
the fox terrier, and ha always had some ﬁne
speclinei s of the strain on one of his country
places. but he only began breeding in 1878. He
had previously shown some terriers in the ﬁrst
bench show of the Westminster Kennel Club in

l 1 8’77- In spite of this early start it was not until 1
l 1885 that the Blempton kennels became widely
1 known as the nursery of winners.

In 1887 Mr. Hopkins was brought over from
England to manage the kennels and some of the
most famous dog‘s on the other side were added
to All‘. Belmont‘s string at prices that 11123110 the
GYCS Of the everyday Clog importer open With
amazement. ’lf‘he kennels to—day contain Chain-
pion Diadcm, Champion Rachel, probably the
best fox terrier bitch in the world: Champion
Marguerite, New Forest Ethel, Lucifer. Baccha—
nail, Regent Vex. .iesolute, Verdict. Media, Tiara.
Rubicon, Brilliant and a dozen other dogs that
are known by name to every well informed dog
man in the world. The kennels now comprise
about eighty dogs and puppies, half of the latter,
however. are boarded out among the neighbor-

! ing farmers after a plan described later on.

; The daily management of eighty dogs is by no

; means an easy task, but when these eighty ani«
, mails have a market value running high up into
E the thousands and an actual value that is not
l computable in figures the management grows
heavy with responsibility.
, Mr. Deliriont i‘iianages his kennels upon a sys‘
‘3 tom partly his own and partly borrowml from the
best kennels abroad. This system is seldom dew-
l alcd from. ll‘hekcnnels consist of. several rows

of small houses fronted by a screened. yard. In
unpleasant weather this yard is rooted over with
l a water tight: cover. Every morning at 7 o’clock
l Mr. Iii‘ipkins and his assistant let the dogs out
l of their houses into their yards. These houses
i are models of their kind.
The walls are of double thickness, with sheets 1
3 of paper laid between the layers to make their}
l absolutely windproof. The walls and ceiling art: -
l coated with liquid tar and phenal. one of the best
i disinfectants known. The ﬂoor is of I‘ortland .

L of the bunks are covered with straw, in which are i
5 mixed tobacco stems to keep fleas out. and the
Georgia pine sawdust en the com )«lll- ﬂoor is well
doetorcd by the admixture of sanitas. With ken-
nels so arranged, epidemics of sickness are well
nigh impossible. '

“Were it not for the visits of strange dogs to
my kennels,’7 said Mr. Belmont. “and were it not
for the visit of my dogs to the various bench
shows, we should seldom have any serious Sick-

While the kennels are being cleaned out the
dogs make the place merry with their yelpingg,
When the time arrives for their run their delight
knows no bounds. All the dogs are not exercised
at once. It would not be safe, for imported dogs
of the bluest of canine blood have naughty pas-z
sions the same as dogs of common life. and the
Blempton terriers enjoy a sharp ﬁght about as
much as they do a run on the course. Only sl'ich
dogs as agree together are taken out at one time.
They are led on to the plains between Garden
City and Hcmpstead, their chains are slipped out
of their collars and in a second they runoff and
avay. After their return to the kennels they are
curried and rubbed and put back into their little
yards. This exercise goes- on from morning until
the last dog has had his run. Then comes supper.

shut away from his companions until the feast is
over. Envy is a vice that even Mr. Belmont's
management cannot drive out oi the kennels,
and it is not in the nature of the best bred dog to
stand hungrily by and calmly watch another dog

PROTECTIl‘lG DUMB ANIMALS.

Report of the S. i”. it. . o for the Month
out January.

The report of the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals for the month of Jan-
uary shows that twenty-three arrests were
made by the society’s oliicers. Fifty-six Coin-
plalnts were received and invcsiiratcd and
Sixty-one disabled were temporarily relieved
from work. Seventy-four disabled and dis:-
eased horses were humanely deszrm‘cd, four
0t which were suii'ering from §."l:lll('lcl'r5 or
farcy. The number of smallanimals dosaovcd
Was ﬁfteen and seventeen Slt‘li animals were
removed in the society‘s ambulance.

In submitting the above rcp01't,6uperiniend-
ent frank 0. Clark says that a great many
comnlalnts are received by the society in the
form of anonymous communications. and
while they are attended to will the same
Dromptness‘_ as if the writers were to make
the complaints in person, it is much
more desirable to have the com-
plainant’s signature or name attached
as an ov1denco of good faith and convenience.

s-xn to ill: bonitcntiary for one year by Judge

poi one l inn to his neighbor‘s dogs, while
ill i:'._v :‘ull: ll'cl'e‘ of a dog light were SCOUpO'l in at
om haul and lined $20 each. Hundreds of such
cups are nicntloncd in the 'upcrintendcnt‘s rc-
inrz't, but one that might be mentioned specially
is that of llcinrich Eichlcr. He was arrested on

J um I o for thrusting two ﬁngers into the eye of

a so. about to be slaughtered. This cruel prac-
ti~c had been indulged in for years by buiclicrs’
.15 den-int; and the object was to get the animal‘s
ll 'il'l in a laticr position for execution. Through
lll': vigilance of the society‘s oiliccrs the cruel

. practice has bccn almost cntircly suppressed.

Then said Delaney “ihrow it Oeiit ,5f the
window for out into the street!” There-

ipon Anderson-*good, obedient soul that h l
is--——seize<’i the animal and tossed it out bf tl‘: :

was approaching the Sidewalk a gentleman
' ‘ ’

who happened- to be passing by, barely es- l

coped being 5111le by lb. The dog lanr'ed OD.

of the First Precinct happened along; and twifn
a. well directed bullet put an end to its suffeix
mg.

in the meantime Superintendent Clark of
the society for the Prevention of Crueltlr to
Animals, had been notified of the occurrence
and he had one of the society’s ofﬁcers on thé
spot in less than twenty minutes after the am
imal had been pitched into the street. b‘everal
witnesses who saw Anderson throw the dog
out of the window called to see Mr. Clark that

f evening, and each and every one of them told
3 him that as soon as the dog had leftAnden

son’s hands Delaney stepped up to the window
and looked out.

Bothljelaney and Anderson, when questioned
by the society’s orlicors regarding the matter
they‘denicd all knowledge of it. However thci
following morning, Delaney thinking it bétter
to make a clean ")reast of it Since he saw
Superintendent Clark was determined to cap.
ture and punish the guilty party, called at the
societyls office and said he did order Ander-

son to “throw the dog out of the window," and '

stated further that he was Willing to shoulder
all the resiponsibility and blame. Anderson
called at the ethos a little later and acknowh
canted what he had done, saying that he would
not have done so had he not thought the dog
was dead. .ilclaney also claims that the
animal was dead before it was thrown into the
street. Delaney in his cil'ort to get rid of the
dog seems to have lost at leastapart of his
discretion, for his action would have beena
violation of a city Ordinance even if the dog
had died before it was hurled from the win—
dow.

AUGlIT AT A COCK FIGHT.

 

gnaw YEAR’S NIGHT SPORT SPOILED
BY .1 POLICE H.411).

iéTen Men, Seven Game Birds and a Pair
.- of Cruel Gail‘s Secured—The Arrest
was hlade on a Tip Given Superinten-
dent Clark.

, Superintendent Clark of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals received
word last night that a cock light of considera-
ble proportions was to be held in a saloon on
Graham avenue. He went to the Nineteenth
Precinct Station House and found that the

police knew nothing of the ai‘l‘air. He had .

two men with him and seven policemen were
detailed to assist him in raiding the place.

\Vhile these preparations were going on a
score of men and boys gathered in the rear of
John Massey’s place at 540 Graham avenue
about 10 o‘clock. Some one took eight tine
game birds to the place, and a pit was ar—
ranged by placing some boards up against
one corner of the room.

Most of the sports, as they called them-
selves, who were on hand had never seen a
cock light before, and they watched with con-
siderable interest the outcome, it is said, of
the ﬁrst battle. Another one was about start-
ing when the crowd turned pale at a thun-
dering knock at the door. A break was made
for the windows, but the oliiecrs broke in the
door and captured nine or the men. The
proprietor of the saloon escaped, but was an
hour or two later arrested by Uﬂicer Altield.

This morning the following mauled busi—
ness men were arraigned before Justice Greet-
ting in the Lee avenue police court: Patrick
Skelly, 2-13 Freeman street; Samuel Ash, 1,09
Ewen street; William l‘leill y, 1:51 Greenpoint
avenue; James Burns, 334 Oakland street;
Daniel Skelly, 219 Oakland street; Michael
McYaeter, 20:5 Greenpoint avenue; Patrick
Skelly, 296 Oakland street, Bartley Farrell,
67 Meeker avenue; George :l’ease, 191 Union
avenue; John Money, 54 Graham avenue.

They were all under bail furnished by As.
semblynian Blanchiield.

They pleaded not guilty. in a bunch, and l

were held for exainination'one week hence.
hlr. Clark will not give up the name of his

informant, but he considers the capture a.

. very clever one, considering the fact that the

‘- police knew nothing of it, The oiliccrs se- 1

cured sevcirof the birds and a pair of cruel
looking galls.

At noon. therefore, ra
men and a. dozen hounds got 0

wagons. Some of the vehic

hayricks with broad seats. Hempsteadel‘s
looked on in amazement and admiration as
the caravan started. It journeyed a dreary.
fatiguing. chilly. slow eight milesto Mr- Lng‘
land’s farm.

As the wagons turned into the yard the mem-

bers saw two familiar figures seated comforta-

bly on a meal box just Within the barn door.
They were John H. Gay and W. Seaman, offi-

cers of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals. They had been there nearly four
hours. having taken the early train from Long .

Island City, and the only comfort the club had .
was that the officers had been kept waiting so .
long. Not a low. however. growled at the un- 3

W. B. Growtage’s Zoe. Blemtonﬂolliwood ken- ;

Fleet was missmg, He had been let out from
the kennels early in the morning for exercise

and he took the day off. Probably he went ;
home when he got ready. Waverly and Minnie ;
l

Statnn'ran the rst course. Minnie won easily

in a brief run across the ﬁeld with one turn. ,

This bound is owned by August Belmont,Jr.
She arrived from England by the Etruria last
Monday evening. and. in spite of the liourney
and lack of recent training. she showed re-
markable speed and skill. 11) England she has
taken many minor prizes. Last year she Was
beaten in the second round for the Waterloo

cup by Banbury. the Winner of the cup in 1887. l
The next course between Wanda and Gypsy ;
was long, and the most exc1tmg of the day. l

The rabbit turned about the ﬁeld several
times, and more than once it looked as if he
Would either escape or tire out the dogs. He
Was caught at last and killed by Wanda. who
Won the course on pomts. Meantime Oﬁicer
Gay was taking notes. but he made no arrests.
Ofﬁcer Seaman looked on. and tried to appear
as if he were enloymg himself. About 100
residents of the neighborhood were on hand,
men and women. and some of them made

things, interesting, especially for the ofﬁcers.
by revrhng the sport and the club men in loud .5

veices.

“They call themselves men 1” exclaimed a
young woman who was surrounded by several
small children; “I’d like to see them all
spanked.”

The club members smiled. and Oﬂicer Gay 4

took notes.

The next course was a bye run by Highland ;

Chief with Waverly. Credit, of course. was

given to Chief. although Waverly had the 3
.. paintshy a large maiority. The course would
have lacked importance except for the fact 3’

that the rabbigbeat the dogs and won his life
by an escape. ‘ he members of the club had
noticed that almost all of the rabbits. instead
of making for the open plains beyond the ﬁeld.

turned at the fence and endeavored to gain the .

Warren. Accordingly they raised the f
shghlly at several places in the runwagngg

AL RFPORT OF THE PHILANTHRO‘
PISTS SOCIETY, “'ITH PICTURES. 1
Th0 twenty-third annual report of the American ,
SOClBW f0? the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
w Inch has just been issued. is printed on black bor-
dered paper, in mourning for Henry Bergh the
oldel§1_riwilnder of the society, whose death occurred
ape 13011:??be 1gm March 12 last. The action of l
~. . ana crs on the de '
printed on length. 3 Mb of Mr. Bergh ls
.. {115 report of Mr. Henry Bergh the younger who
, succccded his uncle as president. is an mew" '
. pull-utivo of the year’s work. The story of the 6:, .
(.115 to stop rabbit coursing on Long Island is. re-
lold‘. with illustrations added. One of the pictures
. Iellrcsentu two fox terriers savagely disputing pos-
‘ session of a. rabbit, and another reproduces a. photo-
! graph oi what; is lefc of the dead bunny after the
dogs have pulled him apart.
’ “An attempt,” says Mr. Bergb, “was recently made
l by 8. numborol’ wealthy people to introduce into
i
i

this country the So-callod ‘sport' of rabbit baiting,

under the impression that through their inﬂuence

such cruel and demoralizing exhibitions could be

made popular and respectable. Though acquitted I

by a local jury they have not been so successful be-

fore tho bar of public opinion, and perhaps they be~
gin to realize that here in America such acts are re-
garded with contempt and abhorrence by respect-
able and law-abiding people. The ofﬁcers of your

: society hadu well established precedent for their I

; action on this question in the case or the People vs.
l-jdu :ird Burl, convicted for a. similar oﬁ'encc known ’
as ‘rut baiting,’ and sentenced at the Court of Special

Sessions, of this city. to serve a term of three

months' imprisonment in the Penitentiary.”

A CONTRAST.

Mr. Borgh makes uninteresting allusion to one of
the ladies at the Courslng Club trials when he
says :-“'l‘hat without some restraining inﬂuence on
approach to such lnhumunilies [Roman gladiatorial
combats] might be possible among a. certain class in
America, I was led to believe by an incident which
occurred in a. Long Island court recently, and which

l gave inc all additional illustration of how the human
sensibilities may become blunted by familiarity with
acts of cruelty. An ollicer of your society was de—
scribing on the witness stand an incident which
tool; pluco at a. rabbit baiting match, in which a
helpless animal was torn to pieces by two dogs,
when l was horriﬁed to notice that one of the ladies
present seemed much amused 8.1; the most distress~
lng part of his narrative.

“Once, while in the performance of my duty, I
was approached by a. man who came to express his
thanks and approbation of my interference in behalf
Ufa. maltreated animal. His face wa4 black with
coal dust; his hands were hard from honest toil.

“The face and costly apparel of that woman con-
cealed a conscience devoid of pity—4], heart as cold
as marble. Beneath the rough exterior of that;
l‘rlendless man there was a. heart- as tender as a.
woman‘s—a soul as gentle as a child's.”

A YEAR’S WORK.

The report of the Executive Committee shows the
aggregate result for the year 1888 as followu—~Caacs
prosecuted in the courts, 991; disabled animals tem-
porarily suspended from work, 1.74:); horses dis-
ubled past recovery humanely destroyed, 2,455;
small animals disabled past recovery, humanely de-
stroyed. 1,281; disabled horses removed from the
streets in the ambulances, 495; complaints received
and investigated, 3.052.

The work aCCOmplished during the past twenty.
three years is as followsz—Cascs prosecuted in the
courts, 14,841; disabled animals temporarily sus-
Dcnded from work, 36,857; horses disabled past re-
covery humanely destroyed. 26,554: disabled horses
removed from the streets in tho ambulances. 4,939.

An account is given of a. new method of killing
dogs at the pound bychloroformlng them instead
of drowning, and it. is announced that. the hospital
for animals will soon be opened at No. 111 East.
Twenty-second street.

The treasurer’s report shows that $105,516 cash
was received during 1110 year, and 578-850 03 was
expended. The cash balance is $50,738 73. From
the Currie J. Wclton estate $73,588 60 was received,
and from the William D. Fuller estate, $12,000.

CARING FOR ANIMALS.

What the P; C- A. Society Did in Brooklyn

 

 

 

. Last Year. 3

The twenty-third annual report of the Ameri« I
can 8°01“ny the .l’reycntion of Cruelty to
Aﬂi'm‘dlﬁ has in“? been issued, embracing the
your18o’8. According to the facts and ﬁgures
as presented, the organization is in admirable
0011mm“? and (icing 'ell'octive work in thirty-

States

Union. which have given 'lewal recog—
nition to the doctrines of tlio society,
and have constituted their violation 3.
crime.

It has certainly taught men to avoid the
lush. to pursue the line of kindness toward the
brute creation and Where conscience -has not:
been reached a healthy fear of the law 111-is in-
tervened and saved animal creation from many
{01‘11101‘ hardships. That excesses of jurisdic-

tion have ’ taken place on the hurt .
of tho olhcers of tho association in
currymg out the governing principles

and that there is a stretch of: power occasion-ally
cannot be denied. and in has sometimes own-bod
ridicule which cunts a. reﬂection upon the more
noble and honorable purposes for which the origi~
no.1 body was orgunizcd. and the course it pur—
sued in its earlier yours. An instance of their
over zealousucss occurs in the attempt. to
estop rabbit couruing,r on Hompstcud l’luius,
under the auspices of a legal society,
and which has been editorially noticed in Till;

Elﬁn-13*. In general, however, the main ob-
jects of L'hc society have the hearty and earnest
sympathy of the communities where the society
exist-r3 and have officials, and the latter always
liud ready and helping; hands from regular
ofﬁcers and citizens Whenever called upon for
assistance in olrlerlzcnt (32188.8. .

The Brooklyn Agency rcccivcs a special notice
in the broad rovww which covers the whole
United States and is cubioincd:

“The cliicioncy oftho Brooklyn Agency has
been materially increased through tho appoint»
mom; of several additional olhcers to ope 'utc in
that. Vicinity. ‘

“A. tolcp‘uouc has also lately bcen placed in
that ofﬁce, and direct communication with their
headquarters cstnblicbcd. By this means, also,
the cliiceru, while out on puirol duty, receive
their instructions, and all message’s from the
Police Dcpurbmonb arc morc promptly trans-
mitted.

“l‘ho i‘cllowmg record of work performed by
the officers annulled to that agency, under tho
direction of Superintendent Lilia-13:. indicates
that the increased oxpondinurc of money in that
direction has been productivo of ado-yuan) ro~
suits.

This showing is very crodilublo to the city
whcn its large bcrritory and commerce is taken
into consideration, and presents more than a
luvoru‘olo cmnparison With 1E8 greater sister

AS the society is mainly existent upon por-

Mr? Charles Luurcr. the treasurer, states that
this handsome surpluu is p11inci3mlly due to the
receipt of 1lhe moricc donated from. osmium,
ncurlv $743,000 having been received lrom two
contributors in that way, tho period cl puy~

Millionaire Morgan‘s Actiondttroots the
Attention of Veterinary Surgeons.

"USELESS, CRUEL AND lNDEFENSIBLE.”

‘[ The Various llIcthods Employed by People
“7110 Are liVilling to Be Barbarous to Be
1 Fashionablelelo Modern RIethod Is
Cruel Enough. but the Old-Fashioned
“7113' Was Agonizing Torture to a Noble
Animal.

“ Cruel, unnecessary and indefensible,” was
the reply of Dr. R. A. McLean, the veterinary
surgeon, and surgeon to the Society for the
l, Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, when asked
by a WORLD reporter for his opinion of the prac-
ltice of ”clocking” or amputating the tails of
,horses. In this concise and forcible opinion
4 Dr. McLean is supported by no less an authority
than George Fleming, LL. 1)., F. R. C. V. 3.,
“the leading veterinary surgeon of the British
; Army, and the acknowledged authority on all

matters appertaining to veterinary surgery.
. “Iain glad you came to me,” continued Dr.
McLean, “ because I think the practice
abominable and should be abolished. particu-
larly in country places, where the methods em-
ployed are crude and entail more or less suffer-
ing on the horse.”

“What is the object in ‘docking?’

” You might just as well ask why a. dude, or
these Anglo-maniac Johnnics, wear outlandish
clothing, making themselves look ridiculous
and seriously detracting from their personal

. ‘ comfort. It is purely a
fashionable ‘fad’ started
in England years ago.
In that country, as you
. probably know, there is
/ a great deal of cross-

”.country riding. and it
{was found that the long
‘1 [ﬂyand ﬂowing tail was
-~" more or less of an im-
pediment to the horses
in taking a jump, as the
hair was liable to catch
in the brush, thus caus-
ing the horse to swerve
while in mid-air, throw-
ing the rider and fre-
quentlyfcausing serious
HOLDING THE VICTIMS injury to both horse and
Nosn. rider. In order to avord
this the hair of the tail was cutoff or banged
close to the end of the stump. Then it became
fashionable in. London to have the tails of
carriage horses so out, and like all such ‘ fads’
it was run to death. and the ultra fashionable
vied with each other in, to use a paradox,
seeing who could add the greatest brevity to a
horse‘s tail, and for a while, almost any day in
Hyde Park. you could see magniﬁcent animals
with hardly as much tail as a rabbit.

 

      

    

 

l AN IMPORTED CRUELTY.

V “ Thus it was that docking was begun, and it
was carried onto such an outrageous extent
that the authorities were ﬁnally compelled to
step in and put astop to the cruel practice.
Several examples were made of well-known peo»
ple, and ‘docking’ in England received its
deathblow, and if practised at all now it is done
surreptitiously.

A BRUTAL METHOD.

It Will be seen that this surgeon, the greateSt
authority oi his day 111 Veterinary surgery", by
no means iavors the )ractice of “ docking.” i

_AiterDr. McLean ad concluded his illustra- l
tron orthe mpdern process and reading the ex- 3
tracts from 1* 16111111 8 text book, he was asked by .
the reporter how 0 ten he was called upon to
perform such an operation. “Not tWice in a,
year,’ he replied, ‘ and then I only do it under

wrotest, alter iniormiug the owners of the use-

GSSDOSB and cruelty Qf_ such an operation, un-
less, of course, the tall 18 diseased, which is not
lnirequcntly the case. If people admire short
tails why don’t they have them banged?
answers every purpose for ’cross—country riding,
of which, by .the way. there is very little in
America, and it certainly does not add anything
’60 the beauty Of a ﬁne team of horses to have
thell‘ 10D rand ﬂOWlng tails abbreviated until ‘
they look, lke mo p-brushes. ”

" Does it detract from or add to the value of a
horse to be docked?” ,

't can’t add to the horse’s value, and in my
opinion it detracts. At least, ifI was purchas-
ing an animal, I should look at it in that li ht. ”
' Are there any methods employed in 00k-
mg a. horse other than that wh1ch you have de-
scribed ‘2”

‘ ‘ Oh, yes. The one I have just illustrated to
you is the method which inflicts the least suffer-
ing and by which the animal is sub'ected to the
least danger. In country places w ere they do
not have ‘ the fac1l1ties enjoyed by veterinary
surgeons 111 large Cities a. different instrument— 1
one of the old style—is used. With this instru-
ment, which is made on the same principle as a
pair of soissors, It is almost 1mpossrble to avoid,
111a measure, crushing the jomt. In fact, if the
jomt is not crushed 1t 18 an accident. Irre-
spective of the dangers described by Fleming,
the use of this instrument is brutal in the ex-
treme and brings about the most acute suffer-
ing. In the ﬁrst place, inexperienced hands,
who are really the ones who generally do this
sort of work _in‘countrfr places. take a large pair
of pincers, similar to t rose used by blacksmiths,
A. helper takes hold of the horse’s snout with
these,

HOLDING THE VICTIM BY THE NOSE.

By pressing them together until the pain is in—
tense, he distracts the attention of the animal
from the operation in the rear. The same pre-
liminaries are then gone through with, except
that the sliding block is dispensed with and the
horse’s tail is held in a horizontalposition. The
horse’s tail is then placed in the slot or the old-
stylc docking instrument, and by the same mo»
tion with which you’d cut a piece of cloth, bone
and ﬂesh are crushed through.

A BRUTAL METHOD.

Sometimes a sharp knife is used and the tail i5
severed at a single blow, but in any case, as I
said before, it is an accident 1f the s ot between
the joints is struck. The bones of t e JOlllt are
crushed and then the red-hot 11‘011 IS brought
into play. The bone, as well as the ﬂesh._ is
seared. and when the former is 'seared. asrde
from ﬁll suffering, there is no telllng where the 1
case wi end. .

In conclusion Dr. McLean said that he be:
lieved the practice should be dopeawaiy With, as
it simply inﬂicted pain and suffering on a dumb
animal without any beneﬁt either to the animal
or the owner. and was glad that THE WQRLD had
taken the matter up from a proper physmloglcal

Dr. McLean, when asked if the placing of the
l ligature did not cause pain to the animal, said
that it did but that it was done-to prevent the
ﬂow of b ood after the operation, and that it
this were not done the invariable result would be

Purchased a “whistler,” or, in other words,
a wind—broken horse. Pete Franklin sat in a
green wagon oifering a “hollow-back” for $40,
but snapped at acustomer who paid $15 for
the horse. Pete is a comical genuis and full of

r

fun. He had named the animal ,9
“Little Dannie,” and collected a crowd
about him by shouting out loudly :

“Who wants to buy Brooklyn’s pride; Little .
Dannie is not a clothes horse, gents; step up ;
and examine him; what a handsome head he '
has; just look at that tail; isn’t he a beauty?" ,
The crowd acknowledged that he was, and .
Pete got down from the wagon to assure them l
that "Little Dannie” was a race horse, but
hadn’t been on the Brighton track since he

won the Suburban Stakes a few years ago. “If
you don’t want to go so high for a horse. I’ll
sell him for twenty-live,” said Pele with a
wink. A little man with big whiskers se-
cured “Little Dannie” for three five-dollar
bills.

Paciﬁc Street Sam had a three-dollar nag,
which he sold for $2 to an Italian junkman,
and While Sam was pocketing the money the
horse lay down. The Italian was about to shed
tears,when he was advrsed to hold up and take
his loss philosophically, which he did.

New Brooklyn Mike, another shrewd dealer,
stood in a group of horse traders telling his
companions of the death of Mnnnie Wright. a
colored dealer, who had never before missed a
market day, “Mannie died in a wagon the
0151191 night over in Schenectady avenue." said 1
Mike, and the crowd enclaimed in chorus,
“Come 01f; d’ye mean it ?“ Mike assured
them that it was a fact, and each took a turn
telling What a good fakir Mannie Wright had
been. and how he had stuck his father on a
glandel'ed horse. “Captain Jinks," another
dealer, whose parents are sold t0_be wealthy,
related a story about Mannie, saying that the
~ colored trader had taken a team irom the liaL ,
l seV Street car stables and sold them across ill:~ 'v
street in the market. "Mannie then went over
and told the railroad starter that a team .be-
longing to the co jumpy was‘ about to be taken 1
away," said the captain. ' l‘h‘e starter got the -
horse back,” he continued, but_ the fellow
who bought the team from Mannie never got
his cash back.' ,

Tom Hegeman, the mustang trainer, thought
“Mannie“ had gone tonheaven if there were
horses up above. But, said hey if there‘s

stable and left nothing there butafew empty 1

barrels and. boxes. Just before he looked the
door Jim crawled into his old home and was
locked up too. It is presumed that th‘eblack cat
took up her abode in the stable at the same time.
- The neighbors do not know 110'me and the
cat managed to live so long without food, but
they think they may have caught a few rats and
mice and dined in Chinese fashion. The animals
grew tired of their bill of fare on Friday night
and began to howl. As the night grew longer
the noise increased, until many heads were visi—
ble at the windows in the neighborhood.

" It was worse than all of the bands at Coney
Island playing at once,” said Mr. Arbuckle. who
lives next. door. “ I thought somebody was be-
ing murdered. It awakened the people for a
block around.”

On Saturday night they bowled worse than
ever and nobody slept. On Sunday the uc1gh~
bors told the police about the case and begged
them to release the dog and cat. After making
an examination of the stable the olliccrs decided
that it would be illegal to force the door or win-
dow. so they let the animals bowl. The noise
was so terrible on Sunday night that one lady
fainted and children were almost thrown
; into convulsions. The nuisance had be-
; come so great that yesterday morning a
‘ public-spirited and enterprising young man liv-
ing opposite went to the ofﬁcer of the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and asked
that an oﬁiccr be scut- with him. '

This was done, and shortly after noon the ofﬁ-
ccr pried the back window Open. It was our-
mised that the dog had become mad through
hunger. and the ofﬁcer carried a. big revolver for
use if it became necessary. But the dog was
all right. He almost turned. a. somersault Iorjoy
when the sunlight burst in upon him.‘

The dog was very thin. but his lungs were in
good condition. He had eaten away an inch
deep of the front door in his cﬂ‘orts to get out.
The cat rusl ed away when released and refused
to be interviewed as to her ﬁve weeks' fast.

“ We are not out of the woods yet." Said Mr.
Arbuckle, painting to the yellow dog. " Jim Wlli

, was locked up. I’ll give 50 cents out of my own
: pocket to anybody who will send the Clog—catcher

a. horse and truck belonging to Ketran. On the
vay down they got thoroughly drunk and tried
to make a race horse out or" the poor old animal,
who found trouble to drag along the load he had
behind him. A whip was too mild an instrument
of punishment, so one of the number beat him
about the head with a heavy strap with a buckle

Opposite Frank Erziugcr’s, at the ocean end of
the Boulevard, when he fell down, and they left
him and went on to the beach to have agood
time. In the meantime George W. Barmore, Of
4.96 Seventh street, having seen their cruelty,
notiﬁed the police, and Ofﬁcers Conway and Clear
went where the horse was, to ﬁnd him dead.

Smith and Denis Sullivan, of 359 Cherry street,

They were beating their horse so that he ran
away and carried them into a bunch of stages on

COUBSING DESPITE COPS.

FIVE IVIORE ARRESTS-

X” Small amount of fun and some exciting 8091103
were furnished yesterday by the Society for the Pre-
ventlon of Cruelty to Animals and the llempstead
Coursing Club, live men being placed under arrest.
for killing rabbits at the meet.

Mr. Henry Bergh has renewed his war against rab-
bit coursing with fox terriers, and seems to be de-
tvrmined to suppress the sport, or at least make it
unpopular, and appearances Indicate that he will
succeed, much to the regret of several score of fash‘
ionable New Yorkers who frequent the pretl.V village
of llempstead. And the gentlemen Sportsmen of
the coursing Club are just as persistent. 100. in
maintaining thelrrights to have their dogs chase
the little bunnies over the plains.

l‘he ground was staked off early in the morning,
about a mile north of the village, on an ”Fe“ “dd
belonging to the A. T, Stewart estate, and a pretty
marquee erected to the westof the course for the av—
commodation of the judges and stewards. A crowd
of villagers and a dozen society people from the City
gathered about eleven o’clock and found everything
in readiness for the sport. There were the scales
for weighing the dogs, several kennels of
nervous fox terriers and a box 0f rﬁbl‘iis
those tender little animals which have furnished so
much sport and been the cause of no end of trouble.
Among: those present were Miss MAY “it'd on a
spirited seal brown hunter; Mr. Egerton Winthrop:
)lr. Frederick Hoey, Mr. and Mrs. Van Relisselaer
Kennedy, Mr. R. W. Stewart, Mr. and Mrs. S. S.
Sands, Mr. H. L. Herbert, Mr. R. D. wmtllror. Bliss

The gentlemen sportsmen who participated in the
film were very few indeed, for it was said that most
of tilt-In had been frightened away by the lust raid
of the “Cruelty” oillccrs and the rumor of trouble
expected. Mr. August~ Belmont, Jr., and Mr. l-‘rl‘d
limey were apparently the only gentlemen who were
lll charge, and when they arrived they were coll‘
fronted by no less than thirteen ollleors of Mr.
“01”,}th society in all the dignity of blue
coals, brzlss buttons and silver badges. They
looked for all the world like real city "cops," but
were not its tldv. Young Mr. Belmont was not a.
whil surprised, because he had gone Out on the same
train with the otllcers and knew theirrrrand. lie
exhibited undaunted courage in proceeding,’ with
his sport in the very face of the society’s men, and
ii there is any gentleman in these parts who can
give dignitvaud character to rabbit coursing it is be.

When the oilicers and the sportsmen met there
was a quick word or two. the crowd gathered about
them and Superintendent llanklnson, of Mr. Bl'l‘zjll'n'
otiicc, with a. slightly trembling lip, informed Air.
lielmont that he was there to prevent the sport, and
he ordered his men to seize and hold the rabbi: box.
The handlers were permitted, however. to carry it
out [0 the centre of the course, where Mr. llelnmnt's
groom, William Thompson, under instructions, at-
tempted to release a rabbit. In an instant two big
oi‘licers pounced upon him and hustled him oil to
the village. Was there any mild "cuss" words and
gnashing of teeth! Oh. no!

rinsr AND SECOND “BLOOD.’

This little episode. which was looked upon as the
"first blood” for the b‘. P. C. A., caused a good (19,11
of uneasiness among the spectators. Nobody
knew how the disagreeable aﬁ'air has to terminate.
and although a score or more of people feared they
were um for it," yet they stood their ground.
Twelve blue coats were keeping guard over the rab~
bit box. when suddenly a loud ”Ki-vi ki-yl" was

‘ heard to the west of the marquee, and away sped a

 

“‘bbil. followed by two terriers. In less than a
minute it was caught and killed, but the
unexpected incident created a commotion among ,
the societyvg oﬁlcers. Before they could cover the
, course. which was outmde the bounds, sump boys
i had concealed the dead rabbit, and nobody was ‘
l identiﬁed as having been guilty of anything more
Serious than laughing. The crowd did shout prettY
l lively to see the oillcers thus ‘llItWitted.

HE FELL A VICTIM AT THE LAST RAID ON
THE HEMPSTEAD COURSERS.

Justice Clowes Summoned Him to the Bar
Yesterday, but It Took All Evaning to
Get a Jury—William Is August Belmont,
113’s, Groom, and His Employer Wm See
Him Throngh._ .

August Belmont. J‘r.’s. groom. William
. Thompson, who was arrested Saturday in the
. raid made by Bergh’s men 011 the Hempstead
; Coursing Club, was arraigned for trialin that
village yesterday for ”interfering with an offl-
cer.” The jury was secured and the case will
be resumed tie-day. Coursing, which the S. P.
C. A. says is cruel, will be explained.

 

Mr. Justice Valentine Clowes sat as a, magis-

trate yesterday afternoon at Hempstead, L ’I

n . u o . . .,
to inquire into the case of William Thompson
who is charged With having committed the aw-
ful oﬁense of resisting an ofﬁcer. William didn’t
know last Saturday that to grab aBergh offi-
cer by the leg, when the said leg is resting on a
crate of rabbits, is resistance, but he will know
better next time. He is one of Mr. August Bel-
mont, jr. ’8, grooms, and when Bergh’s gorgeous
blue and gold trimmed ofﬁcer put his foot on the
crate of rabbits that were to have been used in
the coursing-match, William was ordered to
take one out.

William meant well—too well-but as soon as
he pulled Ofﬁcer Snowden’e blue-covered leg he
found himself lunged off to court. This exam-
ination was set dOWn for yesterday. and Mr. Bel-
mont came with him, leading an imposing train
of lawyers, because Vi'illiam’s case was the ﬁrst
gun in the second campaign of the great war to
determine whether or not the sport of coursing
rabbits with fox terriers may be carried on in
this State.

Mr. Justice Clowes sat at the end of a long
green table in the back room of the Sessions
Court in the mauve Town Hall on Front street.

‘ He is a kindly gentleman, with along, thick and
, imposing brown beard tinged lightly with gray.
‘ Beside him sat Town Clerk Thomas B. Smith,
acting as general auxiliary and clerk of the court.
He is not so big a man as the Justice and

1 his Whiskers are not so attractive, being more

i maroon Burnsides and smaller in area. As coun-

. sel for the Scolety tor the Prevention of Cruelty

l to Animals, Lawyer George 13". Elliott, of Brook-

. lvn, had been retained. For William Thompson

, a peered George W. kaershai’t, Surrogate

, \ eller, and the great. Ben Down1ng,ex-District-

i Afﬁomey of Queens County and holder of many

' o .ces.

I Lawyer Elliott arose from the midst of a

g dense throng of Hernpsteadlans and accused

i poor “William of havxng committed a misde-
meanor by Violating sec. 668 of the Penal Code,

i winch says: "An ofﬁcer or agent may inter-
fere to prevent the perpetration of any act of
cruelty upon any animal 1n'h1s presence. Any‘
person w 10 shall interfere with or obstruct any
such officer or a cut in the discharge of his duty
shall be guilty 0 a misdemeanor. ” Many of the

, villagers groaned at this, for the ' are all in

l sympathy W1th the sportsmen. .B'ol .
'l,i'lg"a.1'ose and declared that William waived ex-

‘ animation, whereupon Mr. J ustlce Clowes With
rare dexterity resolved himself into a Court of
Special Sessions and issued a venrre for twelve
talesmen, from Whom six JUIOI‘S Wlll be selected
to try the cause. The order was given .to
Deputy Sherlff John. Cornelius, charging him

' strictly to bring in the talesmen at 7. 30 o’clock

sharp.
Then all hands went to the Becar House and

i fortiﬁed their minds with large quantities of

iamand eggs and to a, and so made ready to try
William, _Willlam ate heartily and seemed in
good spirits. .

Promptly at ’7 o’clock Mr. Cornelius marched
into the little bit of a room with ten candidates
for the jury box. Messrs. Epenetus Nostrand
and Seaman N. Snedeker for some mystenous
reason were absent, and thereby called down
upon themselves the severe displeasure of the
Court. The Villagers crowded the little room
until a whiff of fresh 311' would have exploded at
once if if had drifted in. Mr. Justice Clowes
drew back his green tablemcﬂze west, 0 ,d
of the room, and elees loaded
lawyers, talesmen'and ordinary Citizens were
ranged about, facmg h_1m 1n ahollow square.
There was a lot of sparring over Charles B. Skld—
more, the ﬁrst candidate for a seat 1n the box. It
was developed with painful accuracy that Char-
ley is bookkeeper for Cooper & Powell. harness-
makers. Cooper (is Powell make harness for
Mr. Belmont. Mr. Belmont employs Thom son,
the prisoner; therefore Charley could not 3 an
unbiassed 'uror. He was excused.

The Whole ten men were sorted over, and as a
result Hackman, Luke Fagau and T1nsm1th
Thomas Mimno were put'm the box—or rather
planted on a settee facmg the Justice, from
which place they made several furtlve but 1n.-
eifectual attem ts to escape. Nearly every tales-
man examined lad made up his mind as to the
good or evil inﬂuence of coursing, but was coy.
William Br ant was the only outspoken man,
and he dec ared that he thought coursmg was
s ort. He was challenged by the. rosecutlon.
V hen the sup 1y of candi ates gave
out Constable heodore A. Wright and
De uty Sheriff Cornelius were armed with
an ority to gather m talesmen from
among the throng. Nearly every man
they tackled smiled and refused to Jury fora
cent. Nearly all the able-bodied men 1n this
Villa. e are ﬁremen or exempt ﬁremen, and they
laugh at the jury-box from afar. _Juror Button
is a ﬁne-looking, sturd .man,.W1th a judicial
cast of features. Mr. ll“ mine 18 a vouth With
red cheeks a. curled black mustache of great
beauty, and the general our of a young man
about town. «

Lawyer Elliott fought hard to have every man
excluded from the box who said he had an opm- ,
ion, no matter whether he declared he could
render unbiassed serv1ce. After much tribu 9.-

e”The copious cascades of questions that Mr.
Elliott poured out kept the court stenographer
hustling briskly. John H. Chase, a Witty young
entleman who. has charge of the Greenﬁeld
Cemetery, convmced the lawyers that 1118 nund,
so far as rabbit coursmg and the alleged gu1lt of
William was concerned, was a pprfect blank. and
was ace ted. Then the num er of Victims ran

while the Constable and the Deputy bherlﬂ‘

hunted up a new surgﬂy. After the supplementary ‘

1. Where in the run-up a clear lead is ained
of the dogs, in which case one, two or .gthree $1332
may be given, according to the length of the lead,
apart from the score for a turn or wrench: . In award-
ing these points the Judge shall take into considera-
tion the merits of a lead obtained by‘adog- hlch has
lost ground at the start, either from being nsigh‘ted
or fxl-om a bad slip, or which has had to run the outer
011°C e. L

2. Where one fox-terrier leads the other so long as
the rabbit runs stral ht, but loses the lead from her
bending round decl' edly in favor of the slower dog
of her own accord, In Which case the one fox-terrier
shall score one point for the speed shown and the
other dog score one point for the ﬁrst turn.

3. Under no circumstances is s eed, Without subse-
quent work, to be allowed to decfde a course, except
when great superlorit is shown by one fox-terrier
over another in a long and to cover.

The Golly—Two oints, or if gained on the outer
circle three pomts. he o-by is where a fox-terrier
starts a clear length be ind his 0 ponent and yet
gasses him in a straight run and ge s a clear length

efore him.

. The Turn—One point. The turn is where the rabbit
18 brought round at not less than a right angle from
her revious line. .

T e Wren-ch.——Half a point. The wrench in Where
the rabbit is bent from her line at less thanaright
angle, butwhere she onl leaves her line to suit her-
self and not from the‘fox- errier pressing her, nothing
is to be allowed. - = ' ,

The Kill.—~Two points, or in a descending scale, in
proportion, to the de cc of merit displa ed in the

111, which may be 0 no value. The men s of a kill
must be estimated according to whether a fox-terrier
by his own superior dash and skill bears the rabbit
whether he picks her up through any little accidental
circumstances favoring him, or whether she is turned
into his mouth, as it were, by the other fox-terrier

he Trip—One point. The trip, or unsuccessful
effort to kill, is where the rabbit is thrown off her
gags or where a. fox-terrier ﬂecks her, but cannot hold

There are a number of allowances which may
be made for acoldents to the do s left to the dis-
cretlon of the Judge, Who from t 1e above, it will
be seen, must not only be well mounted, but
must be an accomplished rider, have good sight,
and above all thoroughly honest. .

After each course the Signal 18 given as to
winch of the two has won. The Hempstead
rules are a red ﬂag for the dog on the right slip,
a White ﬂag for the dog on the left and a yellow
ﬂag for an undecided. At the completion of the
first round the Winners come together in couples
for the second, and so on untl , by the surv1val
of the ﬁttest, one of them 1s a Winner. With
fox terriers against rabbits the courses are com-

Appear at special Sessions.

. During a meet or the llempstead Courslng 0111b

. yesterday at its grounds near that old Long Island
town a Brooklyn agent of the Society for the Pre-
ventiou or Cruelty to Animals, backed by

‘iour omcers, appeared on the scene, stopped

’ the sport and arrested August Belmont -

3r., W. Rutherford and J. 0. Beach, besides two i

mean employed as rabbit handlers.

; were arraigned before a. Police Justice at Hemp-

The prisoners l

l

aloud and paroled to appear at Special Sessions to-

l morrow.

Several ladies were present when the

, ohlcers interfered.

 

The quaint old town of Hempstead, in Queens
l‘ounty, L. 1., had a genuine sensation yesterday.
One that fairly divided the whole population as to
\l'ilC‘thfzr rabbit coursing. or to put it plain, the
chasing and killing; of rabbits by fox-terriers, is
cruelty to animals or not. The cause of this con-
troversy was the arrest of prominent gentlemen
at thn meeting this season of the Henihsiead
Coursing 'lub. The ilrst meetingr was held at
(‘eiarhurst on the ﬁrst Saturday in November,
biliCC‘ which the Iiempstead Club have leased
grounds about half a mile to the west of St. John’s
College, at Garden City.

The grounds were made picturesque With a tent
and flags. and rabbits were plentiful. The entries
for the Challenge Stakes were at 15 lb. each and
under, and those for the Garden City Cup at 18 lb. '
and under. The former had 1] entries and the lat-
ll‘l' 14. There was also a Consolation Sweepstakes

; {01‘ dogs beaten for the Challenge Stakes and Gal'-
den City Cup on the cards, and a match for $100 a
Side. best in live courses, on the “cards. ”

The match had been decided and three courses ,
in the ﬁrst round tor the Challenge Stakes run,
when Supt. F. 0. Clark, of the Brooklyn branch of ‘
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Ani-
Illuls, appeared on the hold backed by four ofﬁcers,

3 two or which were ironi New York. The display
E or authority caused some little excitement and
' surprise. The ofllcers arrested Mr. W. G. Bother-
l lord, the acting,r judge; :».r. F. 0. Beach. the
slipper, and W. {cordon and J. Doty, who were act-
ing as rabbit handlers. Later Mr. August Belmont

who had acted as Judge in the match, was added to

l the number. The prisoners were informed that

l they must appear immediately before Police Justice
Valentine (-‘.oud at ileinpsiead, The sport was at .
once stopped, the dogs were returned to their
boxes. and the ladies. of whom there were a num-
oer present on horseback or with their country
carts, were informed of the law’s interference With
their pleasure.

They could not see by what authority an unnni-
formed man irom Brooklyn or New York could
maize arrests in Queens County. The matter was
explained, and its the order was to appear at
lleiupstead at on as the scene changed, the ladies
going home to lunch and the members or the
lll‘mI‘SlClld Club to the Police Justice’s 03106. i

The oliice of Police Justice Valentine Cloud—a l

typical County Justice’s trial-room—Was reached ‘ .
in due time. After the prisoners, who had ridden
ovdr from Garden City, had taken seats, Mr. Jus-
tice Cloud opened the proceedings by rapping his
(103K with his knuckles for order. The silence that
followed was only disturbed by a friend of the pris- -
oncr, Doty, who tried to convey to him the infor-
mation that he would get at least six months:
H hard. ” In the mean time Supt. Clark had per-
iected his afﬁdavit, citing under the law and
charging Messrs. Rutherford, Beach, Belmont,
lleardon and Doty with cruelty in the killing of
rabbits by two dogs.

As the prisoner: .had no counsel, Justice Cloud
read them the law on the subject. A long talk
then followed, with Mr. Belmont speaking for the
Club, the Iinal result of which was that the case .
was sent to the ('oul‘t of Special Sessions for trial ‘

l to-morrow, at 3 P. M., pending which all were re— l
s leased on their parole, with a special warning that j'
if the coursing was resumed it would be a violation
of the parole. ‘
The decision in the case will be important in de-
ciding it coursing is cruelty. ,It has been held to
the contrary in Enzlund and in California. As in
pigeon-shooting some twelve or ﬁfteen years ago.
the Society tor the Prevention of Cruelty Will
make astrong light, while the Hempstead Club,
tor which Mr. Belmont speaks. claims that it is t
not cruel; that like angling, shooting and hunt-
ing, coursing-is alegitimate sport. He and other
gentle-men or the Club have spent a large amount
i importing.r dogs, of Which they have at the present
5 tune the ﬁnest strains living. Many persons con-
. sider the arrests an unwarrantable procedure on
the part of the Society. '

The match relerred to above was the best or ﬂve ;
courses for $100 a side between L. and W. Ruther- ;
lord’s white dog Warren Spider and H. B. Rich-

' ardson’s white. black and tan dog Meadow Brook
‘ Jack, backed by Mr. R. D. Winthrop. Owing to
. Jack’s ﬁghting proceusitles when in “Slips,” it
Was agreed that both dogs should be held in hand
until the judge ordered “Let go.” Mr. Angus:
Belmont was the judge and lie was most liberal to
the rabbits, which, in the ﬁre course made neces-
sary to decide the event. always had from
thirty to forty yards’ start. The ﬁrst course
was won by the Spider by three points,
m 42;“, ; the second by Jack by one paint in 373.
Spider then won the third course by two pomts in
535., after which Jack. who was much stronger.
had the match at his mercy, he Winning the fourth
course by live pomts in 30%5” and the ﬁlth by four
points in 16s. _ -

As to the three rounds run in the Challenge
Stakes, the Blemton Kennel’s bitch Dahabiah beat
Mr. E. D. Morgan’s Tapered; G. Bell’s Flora iat-

; ters beat the Blemton Kennel’s Dusky Trap and
l Edward Kelly’s Resolute, beat H. Van it. Kenne-
uy’s Antic in the last course run.

What have these gentlemen to be thankful for?
Well. they were not locked up.

his name as Thomas McLarnon and his resi-

‘ The writing was on plain cap Paper: and
‘ looked as if it had. been written ve‘rY 11111"

Clark informed his caller, that he knew 110131-
ing whatever about the transaction, ”5 11“”
was the ﬁrst time his attention had been
called to it. He would be highly pleased to
have some light thrown on the matter. 85‘ he
noticed the society's name was monthll3d 011
the paper. , -
Mr. acharnon, who is in the trucking b391-
ness at the above number, then told the tol-
lowing story: “I came into possession _of the
paper throuzhmy foreman, who received It
from one of my drivers, John Bracken. “'11050

quest that it be handed to me. The fOl'C‘illfll):
did as requested, but by the time i got hold oi
1t Bracken had left the stable for Brooklyn
with his Cart. I did not know Just
where to locate him, so I. questioned the
foreman. He informed me that Bracken told
him that last Wednesday, while loadini,r his
cart at a dock in Brooklyn, he was approached
by two men, one of whom were a badge, and
said:

“You got away from me yesterday, but l‘vo

f not you to—day.”

Bracken replied that he had not been there
the previous day. ,

“Well," said the men, at the same time dis-
playing the badge, “that horse you are «lriv-
ing was. It has a sore back and you will
have to go along with us.”

According to Bracken’s story, he accom-
panied the stranger to a saloon a short dis-
tance away. When they reached the place he
was taken intoa back room where a third ;
party, apparently an acquaintance of the ,
others, was lying on a bench. As soon as the '
trio entered he jumped to his feet, and after a
short conversation with the "man with the ,
badge,” he turned to Bracken and informcl
him that he would have to pay a line and coats
to the amountof $6.84). Brat-ken said he paid
the money and asked for a receipt, which was
cheerfully given him. He then left the place
and continued his work.” Continuing, Mr.
McLarnon said that Bracken did not tell his
foreman what the men looked like or where
the saloon was located. and he himself did not
know.

Mr. Clark, accompanied by Mr. Mclnrnon,
visited police heai‘lquartcrs. where the hour
repeated the story. Acting Superintendent
l‘vlackellar told him that he would do all in
his power to ferret the case out,
but he could do nothing until he
obtained the location of the saloon where
the alleged fine was paid. To do this Mclhrnon
he would have to see lirackcn
and before leaving promised to bring him to
this city last night. Up to noon to-day he
had not done so.

This leaves the police as well as the society
as much in the dark as ever. If Mr. Mohair-
non does not put in an appearance 2dr. L'lark

Illc ls Fined 835 for Using: a. Halo
{stick on a. ﬁﬂoree.
Dr. Archibald ii. Robertson, chief lDSpector
f the local Bureau of Animal Industry, was
yesterday found guilty by Justice Kenna of
cruelly beating his horse with a halo stick and
ﬁned $15.

~Robertson was arrested for the olfense on
Aug. 21 by Ofﬁcer Kiley, of the Fourteenth
precinct. lle was taken to the station house
and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals was notified. inspector (Illark ini-
inediately began an investigation. He sought;
out several witnesses who informed him that
Robertson’s treatment of the animal was hot '
brutal and unwarranted. ’ -

It. appears that the accused was riding be-
hind the horse in a sulky on the day men—
tioned. The animal became frightened, lost
its footing: and fell to the around. According
to the story of a witness the horse’s head was
in the gutter and its feet on the sidewalk.
llobertson, becoming enraged, hastened to the
stable a short distance away and. procured a.
balestick, with which he vigorously belabored
the animal over the head instead of trying to
aid it in regaining its feet.

As soon as Robertson saw Ofﬁcer Kiley ap-
proaching he tried to sneak the stick back to
the stable, but he was felled in his attempt.
It is now in possession of the society, and will

3 be kept as a memento of the occasion.

convention of the anti cruelty societies in this

Colonel E. A. Rockwood. of Buffalo, and Dr. E. V.
Stoddard, of Rochester, and the reasons for the
same are stated to be: First—To bring the several
organizations into closer connection, and thus
insure greater uniformity of procedure as well as
assistance and support when needed in adjoining
districts; second-To consider and discuss im-
portant questions of daily experience: third——
To insure more extended means of education of
society in the objects of the organization; fourth
--To secure a general understanding of the hear-
ing of necessary humane legislation, both exist-
ing and to be secured in future, and, ﬁfth-—

 

careful consideration of
mane work.

sented by President Henry B. Jones and Secre-
tary Robert J. Wilkin, while the local branch of
the society for the prevention of cruelty to ani-
mals will be represented by Mr. John P. Haines,
the president. Invitations have been sent also to

narrative of the year’s work. The story of the 6:. l
“’1‘" ‘9 “OP rabbit coursing on Long Island is rc- .
told, With illustrations added. One of the pictures
Nhresmits two for terriers savagely disputing pos-
session of a rabbit, and another reproduces a. photo-
graph ol‘ what is left of the dead bunny after the
dogs have pulled him apart.
"An attempt,” says Mr. Bergh, “was recently made
bya numbcrot‘ wenlthy people to introduce into
this country the so-callod ‘sport' of rabbit baiting,
under thelmpression that through their inﬂuence
such cruel and demoralizing exhibitions could be
made popular and rospecruble. Though acquitted
. by a local jury they have not been so successful bo-
' fore tho bar of public opinion, and perhaps they be»
pill to realize that here in America. such acts are re-
garded with contempt and abhorrence by respect-
1 able and law-abiding people. The ofﬁcers of your
, society had a. well established precedent for the'
, action on this question in the case of the People

Mr: Charles Luurcr, rho treasurer, states that
this handsome surplus is principally due to the
receipt of the monies donated from. cstulica,
nearly $743,000 having been received irom two
contributors in that way, the period at pay-
ment extending over some time. it is greatly
to the honor of the society that, the treasurer
ctutcs “in the management of the, socicty s

Millionaire ll’Iorgaii’s Action'vilttracts the
Attention of Veterinary Surgeons.

 

"USELESS, CRUEL AND lNDEFENSIBLE.”

l Th0 Various Methods Employed by People

Who Are \Villing to Be Barbarours to Be
a Fasliionablew'l‘lie Modern Illethod Is
Cruel Enough. but the (Md-Fashioned
“7113' W’as Agonizing Torture to 31 Noble
Animal.

“ Cruel, unnecessary and indefensible.” was
the reply Of Dr. R. A. McLean. the veterinary
slll‘geon. and surgeon to the Society for the
hPrevention of Cruelty to Animals, when asked
by a WORLD reporter for his opinion Of the prac-
tice Of “docking” or amputating the tails Of
horses. In this concise and forcible Opinion
Dr. McLean is supported by no less an authority
than George Fleming, LL. D., F. R. C. V. S...
‘the leading veterinary surgeon of the British
:Army. and the acknowledged authority on all
'matters appertaining to veterinary surgery.
"Iain glad you came to me,” continued Dr.
McLean. “ because I think the practice
abominable and Should be abolished. particu-
larly in country places, Where the methods em-
ployed are crude and entail more or less suffer-
ing on the horse.”

“What is the Object in ‘docking?’

” You might just as well ask why a. dude. or
these Anglo-maniac J ohnnies, wear outlandish
clothing. making themselves look ridiculous
and seriously detracting from their personal
comfort. It is purelya
fashionable ‘fad’ started
in England years ago.
In that country, as you
probably know, there is
it great deal Of cross-
'l‘i country riding. and it
kl‘jwiis found that the long
if (and ﬂowing tail was

pediment to the horses

hair was liable to catch

quentlyﬁ‘causing serious
HOLDING THE VICTIM-S injury to both horse and

NOSE. rider. In order to av01d
this the hair of the tail was cutoff or banged
close to the end of the stump. Then it became
fashionable in London to have the tails of
carriage horses so cut, and like all such ‘ fads"
it was run to death. and the ultra fashionable
vied with each other in, to use a paradox.
seeing who could add the greatest brevity to a.
horse’s tail, and for a. while. almost any day in
Hyde Park. you could see magniﬁcent animals
with hardly as much tail as a rabbit.

 

 

 

   
 

 

AN IMPORTED CRUELTY.

“ Thus it was that docking was begun, and it
was carried onto such an outrageous extent
that the authorities were ﬁnally compelled to
step in and put a stop to the cruel practice.
Several examples were made of well-known peom
ple, and ‘docking’ in England received its
deathblow. and if practised at all now it is done
surreptitiously.

Alter Dr. McLean ad concluded his illustra- 1
tion or the modern process and reading the ex- 1
tract-s from Flemin ’3 text book. he was asked bV 3
the rcporterhowo ten he was called upon to
perform such an Operation. ”Not twice in a
year.’ he replied, ‘ ‘ and then I only do it under
irotest. aft-er informing the owners of the use-
GSSDGSB and cruelty of_ such an Operation, un-
less. of course, the ta.1l 18 diseased. which is not
infrequently the case. If people admire short
tails why don’t they have them banged? It
answers every purpose for ’cross-country riding.
of which, by the wey. there is very little in
America, and it certainly does not add anything
to the beauty of a. ﬁne team Of horses to have
their long-and ﬂowmg tails abbreviated until
they look like mo p-brushes. ”

Does it detract from or add to the value of a
horse to be docked?” .

It can’t add to the horse’s value. and in my
opinion it detracts. At least, if I was purchas- .
mg an animal. I should look at it in that li ht. ” ‘
. Are there any methods employed in 00k-
mg; a. horse other than that which you have de-
scribed ‘I”

Oh. yes. The one I have just- illustrated to
you 18 the method which inﬂicts the least suffer-
ing and by winch the animal is sub'ected to the
least danger. In country places W ere they do
not have‘the facilities enjoyed by veterinary:
surgeons 111 large Cities a. different instrument—-
one of the old style—is used. With this instru-
ment. which 18 made on the; same principle as a.
pair of seissors. 1t 15 almost imposmble to avoid,
inn men-sure. crushing the jomt. In fact. if the
mintuis not crushed 1t 18 an accident. Irrc»
spective Of the dangers described by Fleming.
the use of this instrument is brutal in the ex-
treme and bungs about the most acute suffer-
ing. In the ﬁrst place. inexperienced hands.
who are really the ones who generally do this

sort of work in countr * places. take a. large pair
Of piiicere, Similar to those used by blacksmiths.
A. helper takes hold of the horse’s snout with
these.

HOLDING THE VICTIM BY THE NOSE.

By pressing them together until the pain is in-
tense, he distracts the attention of the animal
from the operation in the rear. The same pre-
liminaries are then gone through with, except
that the sliding block 18 dispensed with and the
horse’s tail is held in a horizontalposntion. The
horse’s tail is then placed in the slot of the Old-
etylc docking instrument, and by the same mo»
tion with which you’d cut a. piece of cloth, bone
and ﬂesh are crushed through.

A BRUTAL METHOD.

Sometimes a sharp knife is used and the tail ig
severed at a. single blow, but in any case, as 1
said before. it is an accident 1f the. 5 ct between
the joints is struck. The bones of t c JOint are
crushed and then the red-hot iron is brought
into play. The bone. as” well as the ﬂesh._ is
scared. and when the former 18 .seared. aside I
from thﬁi angering. there is no telhng where the .
case *m en . '

In conclusion Dr. McLean said that he be-
lieved the practice should be doneaway With, as
it simply inﬂicted pain and euftering on a dumb
animal without any beneﬁt either to the animal
or the owner. and was glad that THE WQRLD had
taken the matter up from a. proper physmlogical

DONNELLY AND'nIs-T‘EZEMEE

He Struck a Dog on the “can with It
Almost Iiilling Him.

Err-Policeman William Donnelly. who keeps
a grocery store at No. 98 Third street
will be called upon shortly to ex: l
plain before Justice Tighe his action 1'
in striking on the head with aghammer ‘
ab‘hepherd dogfuelozlgmg to a Mrs. ” ‘ ’
who lives opposrte hisplace of b‘ISiness, -

. Last Sunday morning the dog in question ,
stole out of the house and crossed he sheet
in the direction of Donnelly’s store. "he soon
as Donnell)’ observed the dog he grabbed a ‘
hammer, and walking toward the approaching 1
animal. and dealt 1t aheavy blow on the head.
The dog reeled, feel in 133 own tracks and lay

 

 

 

, as if dead.

When the animal started for the Street Mrs.
Kenney sent her daughter alter it, She had

‘a just reached the animal and was about to drag
‘ it back into the house when Donnelly struck

the blow. Yesterday she notiﬁed the Society
for the Prevontlon of Cruelty to Animals, who
will apply to-day tor a warrant for Don-
nelly’s arrest.

\i’hen Donneliy appears in court he will
also be called upon to answer a charge of as-
unit which James Burns will prefer against
him. Burns saw llonuelly strike the dog and
tried to prevent him from so doing. Donnelly
became enraged at Burn’s interference and ,
gave him a severe heating. ' V

It, is said that Donnelly was greatly rejoiced
over his almost successful attempt to kill the
dog, and remarked afterward that if the anis
mal survived he would shoot him next time.

familiar with the letter of Sir Walter Scott on the
“Lust Words of Bonny Heck,” which clearly shows
that at that time as well as at the present the bare
always had a. chance before the dogs for its life.
Sir Walter gives us a. sporting anecdote said to have
happened in Fife and not far from the residence of

in what regard the rules of fair play between bound
and bore are held by Scottish sportsmen. This is
what Sir Walter says :—

ing the gentlemen an easy cantor of a. mile or two threw
out the dogs by passing through a particular gap in an
enclosure. This sport the some hare gave to the some
party for one or tWo seasons, and it was just

 

enough to afford the WUl‘Lhy members of the club a suf-
ﬁcient reason to be alleged to their wives. or others 1
whom it might concern, for passing the day in the pub-‘7i
lic house. At length a. fellow who attended the huntl'
notoriously thrust his plaid or great coal: into the gap I ,
mentioned. and poor puss, her retreat beingthus cut otf, l

seemed to end with this fumous hare. They either found
no hares or such as all‘orded onlyn halloo and u squeuk,

; or such, ﬁnally. as gave them further runs than they 3

had pleasure in following. The spirit of the meeting died .‘
away, and at length it was altogether given up. The pub-
licuu was, of course, the party most especially affected '
by the discontinuance of the club, and regarded. it may i
be supposed, with no complacency the person who had ~.
prevented the here from escaping, and even his memory. .
One day a gentleman asked him what was become of such

Addison, in his charming papers on Sir Roger De

tion of a. run, says:—— ‘

reach of her enemies when the huntsman, getting for-
ward, threw doWu his pole before the dogs. They were‘
now within eight yards of that game which they had been
pursuing for almost- us many hours; yet, on the signal
before mentioned, they all made a, sudden stand. and
though they continued opening as much as betore, durst
not attempt to pass beyond the pole. . . - .

At. the came time Sir Roger rode toward «an. 3'

after delivered to one of his servants with an orderit

gave the hare not only a. chance, but allving chance.

NOT POPULAR IN ENGLAND. ' 3

Rabbit bailing is seldom patronized by English
gentlemen and never by the ladies, as it is looked
upon as not only a cruel and unlawful, but an un-
m'anly sport. Instead of the bare and the grey-
hound being used it is the rabbit and the Whippet

, dog, which is across between the bull terrier and

baiting. Stonehenge says “it
should be remembered that in the early
shows from 1859 to 1863 the fox terrier
was ignored altogether, no class being assigned to 3
him, owing; to the fact that the breed, though exist-
ing in certain foxhound kennels, was not known be-
yond them. Even at the great London international
show of Mary 30, 1863, no class for this breed was
made.” . _
The only use made of the fox terrier 11p to this
time was to follow the fox hunters and drive out the
foxes from their burrows or holes. They afterward
became popular for ladies’ pet andvhouse dogs, While
sporting men of the lower classes have used them

NEW YORK, Dec. 9, 1888. . '

PRESIDENT PESHALL OUTVOTEDE'il’

The governors of’ the New Jersey Kennel Club;
helda meeting last evening at Taylor's Hotel. in.
Jersey City, to consider arrangements for the com- ‘
ing dog show, to be given under the cuspices of the. ‘
club at Jersey City in February next, and incident-
ally to take action on a. resolution framed by Presi-
dent Peshall, and which commended Mr. Bergh. of .
the Society for the Prevention, of Cruelty to Ani-I

mals, for his attempt to suppress rabbit coursing on
Hempstead plains. '

It was decided that the dog show should be fgiven 1
during the week immediately preceding that of the ’
szmilor exhibition in the Madison Square Garden in‘ .
this city in February. and that it should last four .1
days. It was stated in the course of the discussion '
over the matter that it 'would be undoubtedly a suc- ‘
cess, inasmuch as between eight and nine hun-
dred canines would be entered in the competitions
for prizes.

The Bergh resolution, however, was laid on the
table. though only after a. long and spirited debate,

In which President Peshall warmly defended the
course he had taken. He was seconded by two or
three of the governors of the club, but the majority
was against him. and that settled it. --

It is understood that one reason for the action
taken by the governors was that word had been
conveyed indirectly to them that August Belmont, l

Jr., the president of the Hempstead Coursing Club.
and whole also, by the way, the presideutofithe
American Kennel Club, of which the Jersey City
Kennel Club is a member, intended to give up
rabbit coursing or baiting. That was held to indi-
cate that no action by the Jersey people was
necessarv- , , . _

Send for . a Jack Rabbit or Two.

By the way, the coursing club at Hemp-
stead, L. I.. seem to hate come into
conﬂict with a. pretty strong public opinion.‘

Mr. Peshall, of the Jersey City Athletic
Club, in a letter 9 inted elsewhere, gives us

Scott, on the subject, and adds a word from

tween 3. hare and a brace of greyhounds.
The run covered several miles, and when it
Was over “both the dogs and the hare lay
dead within a. few yards of each other. ”
Well, that shows the Hempstead club a
way out of their difﬁculty. ' We have in the
Far Wests. quadruped kn’Own as the jack rab-
bit, and if the object is to speed the dogs !
and put them on their mettle, this jack rub-
bit can teach them a. wrinkle they never l
dreamed of, l
He is an eccentric little rogue, but he can
get’ over the ground ahead of a. telegraph
message. He is small, but, oh my, how he
can run ! When chased by the ordinary cur
he fully appreciates the fun of the situation,
makes a mile or two in a. minute or two, then
sits down on his haunches, fans himself with
,his big ears and waits for the poor, panting
dog to come up. Then he goes along at a.
jog trot, leisurely looking over his shoulder;
if he scents danger he hustles along like a_
cannon bull and is soon so far away that the
dog couldn’t see him with the Lick telescope.
Yes, the jack rabbit could teach those fox ‘
terriers how to stretch their legs and not
feel that he had taken any exercise. By all l

GOOD SPORT 0N THREE TRACKS I

Football Men in the Field and Bow'ersi

W

The Eastern Coursing Club, a. new organization.
is composed of a number of gentlemen residing in
New York, Brooklyn and near by cities, Who own
greyhounds.

An inaugural meeting for the purpose of testing
the Speed and endurance of the dogs W118 arranged
for yesterday at Hicksville, Long Island. The Amer—
ican Coursing Club rules were adapted, which PrO'

legitimate and sportsmanlike manner.

There was a good assembly, which included a few
ladies and the following gentlemen :—-Mr. De Lan-
cey Kane, Mr. Baird Caminoni, Mr. J. H. Watson, Mr.
C. S. Wixom, of Hornellsville; Mr. Alfred Heald, of
Lancaster, Mass; Mr. H. W. Huntington, Mr.

Charles L. Grifﬁth, Mr. Edwin H. Morris, Mr. Phil I

339.9312 Of Troy; Mr. C. D. Webber, of Newark; Mr.
T. Farrar Rackham, of Orange; Mr. E. O. Garbrett,

Mr. J. F. Simmons, Mr. German Hopkins, Mr. J. H. .

Work, Mr. W. R. Caminoni, Mr. R. Lambert, Mr.
Taylor. Mr. H. W. Lacy, Mr. P. Caminoni, r., with
many others.

It was decided at a. meeting of the oﬂicers of the
club which was held the previous evening that they
would remove all reason for interference by the
Bergh society, and therefore cancel the priZe list.

WELL BRED ’uzvs.

There was a ﬁne lot of greyhounds present, includ~
ing the noted show bench crack Balkis, the Scottish
dog Glenbrig, recently imported by gentlemen of
Troy, N. Y.; Mr. J. H. Watson’s fawn dog Waverly,
the Woodhaven Kennel’s Fleet, Mr. Caminoni's
Wanda, Mr. Huntington’s Highland Chief,

the Harmony Kennel’s black dog Hazelhurst, a. .

ﬁnely formed hound, and their bitch of the same

color named Harmony. Mr. Charles L. Grifﬁth,
who has enjoyed this sport in the West, took his
beautiful brindle bitch Gypsy down with a small
sized bitch of good. racy style belonging to an en-
thusiastic Englishman, Mr. E. A. (iarbrett; the
secretary’s stylish Highland Chief, his black and
white dog Andy McGregor, and that well known
dam Mother Denidike from Mr. Webber's kennel, to-
gether with Sister in Black, that did such good
work some year or two ago out West.

The ofﬁcers of the day were as follows:~Dr.
Matthew H. (fryer. of Philadelphia, judge: Mr. C. E.
Garbitt. steward of the ﬁeld: Mr. James Black, late
of the East Kent Courslng Club, of England, slipper,
while Mr. J. Herbert Watson and Mr. H. W. Hunt
lngton carried out the rest of the duties.

. 'rrm FlRST HEAT.

Waverly and. Fleet having been drawn for the ﬁrst
heat, these dogs were put in the slips at eleven
o'clock. and a. few minutes later one of the Western
jack rabbits (which the club had procured at an ex-
pense of from $10 to $20 a head} was let out of the
enclosure and given a chance to be for ever free.

The rabbit would doubtless have got awav, but
when he neared the corner of the ﬁeld he noticed
the three suspicious looking gentlemen in blue
coats standing there and made a. turn on his own
account, which gave a chance to the dogs.

. THE Anunsrs.

'lhe Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Ani‘
mals new thought it was time to have their turn
and three of them made a dash for Waverlv wlth the'
rabbit in his Ina-11th. The lieetest of these nentle-
men, after examining the rabbit, heard sobmany
humane remarks about not torturing it that he
took out his club and dealt it a blow sufﬁcient to
kill an OK, fracturing the skull and makin the
blood rush out of the nostrils. g

I'l'hzs bravery was followed up by the arrest of the
slipper, Mr. James Black, and the game Stal‘tnr 3111
Mellregor, who were taken to the village and the
coliilrsnriz was suspended. ’

Thomas (terry was the descendant of an
Old family living at Newton, England, and
he laid the i‘mindntion oi’ the present. great
tortune ol the Llerry tamily by starting in
life as a merchant as soon as the Village of
Marblchead came into existence.

Mr, Gerry's lather, Elin-nlgo (lorry, won
considerable fame as a Sitili'h‘liltlll in Wash—

nothing but his profession to depend upon

'a. little lawsuit he won for a poor widow.
Before many years be attained a position
at the bar second to but very few. , Many

important and noteworthy cases were in-
iLtrusted to his care, oneof Which'was the

famous trial of Daniel Maofariand for the
murder of Albert D. Richardson. The elab-
orate defence worked up by the young law-
V91; which was one oi the legal wonders of

His skilfiil work ill the. Marx and Bonard

one, the decision to be cited as a. pre-

A Unique Case for the Prevention or

male. Friday afternoon a man who_ gave
his name as Thomas McLarnon and his resi-
'dence No. 50 West Forty-third street, i\'cw

that gentleman if he knew anything about. a

: paper which he handed him, containing the ‘

‘ following: g

riedly. After reading it very carefully 311'-
Clark informed his caller, that he'linew noth-
ing whatever about the transaction, as that
was the ﬁrst time his attention had been
called to it. He would be highly pleased to
have some light thrown on the matter, as he
noticed the society's name was mentioned on
the paper. _ 1 _ _
Mr. McLarnon, who is in the trucmng bliSl-
uses at the above number, then told the fol-
lowing story: “I came into posseesrouof the
paper through my foreman, who received it
from one of my drivers, John Bracken, whose
name is contained on the paper With the re~

did as requested, but by the time 1 got hold or

It appears that the accused was riding be«
hind the horse in a milky on the day men—
tioned. The animal became frightened, lost
its footing and fell to the ground. According
to the story of a witness the horse’s head was
in the gutter and its feet on the Sidewalk.
Robertson, becoming enraged, hastened to the
stable a short distance away and procured a
balestick, with which he vigorously belabored
the animal over the head instead of trying to

aid it in regaining its feet. ‘ -.
As soon as Robertson saw thcer ltiley

proaehing he tried to sneak the stick back to
the stable, but he was foiled in his attempt.
It is now in possession of the society, and will
. be kept as a memento of the occasron.

echoed Mr. Sidney Ripley Dillon, “and it
is decidedly line sport. am sorry that

“ir‘wours‘ror WORK. *

l‘hcy \Vantcd to Dispense with 'll‘our
Horses on Ninth Street.

When the parties now owning the Jay,
Smith and Ninth Street Railroad took posses-
sion some three months ago they immediately
began to curtail expenses in every direction.
One of the ﬁrst moves they made in this direc-
tion was to dispense with the” use of tow horses
on the hill on Ninth street, tron. Fourth to
3:1,:th avenues. The old concern always had
from two to four of them stationed at this par-

 

 

pulling the cars up hill whether they happened
to be crowded or not.

on Nov. 21 Superintendent Clark of the So-
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
noticed a letter in one of the daily papers
signed 13. A. F., which complained bitterly of .
the company’s action in withdrawing the tow—
horscs, when it was an absolut e necessity to
have one or more stationed. at the beginning
of the up-grade. The writer complained
further that the cars often contained from
i‘orty to sixty people, and one team was com-
pelled to draw the car thus crowded up the
steep incline Without any assistance whatever.

}.l r. Clark made an investigation and found
the statement to be cori'ec.’ He immediately
called upon the railroad oliicials, and, after ‘
pointing out to them that they were Violating
the law, they promised to put one tow horse
on the following day and keep it there. This

 

; they did until the past week, when, probably

thinking the matter had been entirely forgot-
Superinten-
dent Clark heard of it and, immediately de-
tailed two of the society oliicers to stop the
ﬁrst car that came along crowded and refuse
to allow it to proceed Without the assistance of
another horse.
"two cars were stooped. And, the company,
upon being notified that the ofﬁcers would not
allow them to proceed Without the tow horses
they had two on the Spot in a very short time.
The cars were then permitted to go ahead."
’lhe society has no objection whatever it the
horses attached tothe cars are allowed to pull
3 them up the hill Without assistance, promding
the load is not more than they are capable of
pulling, It IS a shame that a rich corporation
will 183m itself open to public critic1sm and
contempt by resorting to such measly tricks
for the sake of saving a few dollars.

Some Four Fooled Fliers with Records

Who Make It Interesting for
Jack Rabbits.

“Do you consider coursing a sport?"

This was the question asked by Lawyer Elliott
when the Eastern Coursing Club’s Slipper Black was
being tried before a jury at Hicksville, L, I,

This nearly equalled 8' certain young lady’s
knowledge of greyhounds. She Wanted a dog “like

C. L. GRIFFITH.

 

‘ those she had read of which caught the rabbits at

Hicksvillc~one of the latest fashion.” She did not

5 know whether they were English, Indian or Rus-
sian greyhounds, but she said "she had read of
ocean greyhounds and would like to see one of
these, with a good disposition and a pedigree.”

The Eastern Coursing Club had nothing to hide,
so they invited the legal gentlemen to visit their
trials the following day, and gets better knowledge
of coursing.

No, they were ﬁghting for a principle!

, "Oh, yes, a. principle! 80 only one of the Bergh
ofﬁcers could face the coursers after their second
defeat, and he happened to miss the train.

Drew was his name, he appeared to be of
more than ordinary intelligence and was heard to
remark to a gentleman who had come a. long dis-
tance to witness the sport:-—“You must be very
much of a sportsman to take such a journey.”

“Yes,” said the gentleman, ”some of these dogs
come from England and Scotland for this meeting,
and others have won honors in the Western States,
and the owners in nearly every case have brought
their dogs long distances. We wish to improve
our breed and if possible beat those of our cousins
over the water. and send others to different parts
of the States to insure greater excellence every-
where. I am here to see them run and to judge
for myself as to which are the superior.” 1

BLUE BLOODED BALKIS.

Balkis is the name of one of the dogs. He is the
sire of many a dog that has won laurels on the
Western plains and one of the most noted bench
show prize winners in the United States, coming of
the bluest blood of England. Even, with his weight
of years he ran well on Wednesday. but could
scarcely be expected to take the Atlantic Ocean in a.
bound.

His owner, Mr. H. W. Huntington, is an enthusi-
astic courser, and an admirer of the beauty, sym—
mctery and grace of his favorite dog. He has long
been one of the leading gentlemen interested in

. this breed, and when the National Dog Club of

. America was formed some year or two ago he was

the American Kennel Club, and hence Mr. llunting-
ton is now secretary of the Eastern Coursmg Club.
MOTHER DEMDIKE'S cnir. .
Mother Demdike is more at home on the plains
than on the ocean, also. She has reared many a.
youngster that has gone West to make warm work
for the Jack rabbits, but on the ﬁrst day 8 meeting
one of those despised Long Island cottontails made
it warm for her. She was taken down for a turn
with the rest, and afteri the S. P. C. A. had stopped
the fun, she was enjoying a quiet run and sharing
in the gambols of the younger doors. when a. COEtOIl’
tail threw up his head just in front or her and
made off. ' Mother Demdike, despite her years, was
off too, and Sister in Black followed close at her
heels. and, a. ﬁne chase they had, convincing the
SDGCtdtOI'S that ecttontails can not only run fast
011011841 to keep themselves warm, but are mighty
01111111113 3150. for just as the dogs were gaining the
rabbit ran through the fence, and although both
dogs 0193'er in ﬁne style no cottontail was visible-
Hc went the nearest way home. and got there. '
This was not so with the Californian jack rabblfs-
They seem t0 be fond of giving the dogs a. chat-e,
and rare fun they Create with their doubles, turns,
wrenches and other manccuvres. After the Bergbh
society oliiccrs’ brave conduct in seizing and clu -
hing one of these to death-and arresting twoof. mg
servants of the club, the day’s sport was suppose
to be ﬁnished, but the gentlemen present Ma 11015
brought their dogs from Troy, Newark. ONIUEZB,

Mr. Engels‘sccnreil the EQuiuc Bar,
gain at the Ridgewoed Horse Market
“ton Mondaywil‘uesday the Animal De-
f Veloped Hydrophobia, and After
I Wrecking Everytliing'in Sight: Was
' Finally Killed.
l
l,

“7illiam Engels, a. produce-dealer, at No.
587 Sixth. avenue, wandered out to the
l Ridgewood' Horse _Market last: Mon-(la y
afternoon aiid'purchaseda horse; just what
the price was which Mr. Engels paid for the
animal is not known, but, at any rate the
“purchaser was satisﬁed with his equine bar—
;Vgain. The‘latter was ﬁled home to Mr.
- Eligels’ stable. on Prospect place, near Fifth
' avenue, where he was installed in a comfort-
.VE-ahle- stall for the night.
; Tuesday morning, when Engels visited the
l stable, he discovered that, the disposition of .
,2 his new horse had changed very much during l
the night: instead of the seemingly gentle l
l
l

 

animal, which he had purchased, he found
a ﬁcry, untamed steed :iii possession’of the
stall. 3, ' . 3 ‘

Vlﬂluring the night the horse had improved
his leisure moments by chewing up the feed-
; box and all the woodwork jwithin reaching
distance; incidentally he had kicked several
holes in the wall. Engels found it inipos~
sible to get near the horse, which made-
_fi'a,ntic efforts to bite him. ll‘iiuilly. with
- the assistance of a helper, who arrived on
. the seine, tho horse was lassoed and hauled
i out into the yard. where he promptly lfll'O-
~ C-ii‘eded to run ainuck. ' 3 »

He hit a large chunk of one of the oak‘
. gate posts: then he jumped. high in the air
and toro the water pipe, on the side of the
stable. from its tastenings; ﬁnally he
dropped on his fore legs and proceeded to
. bite. the earth. throwing large quantities of f
dirt to each side. “Thile he was engaged?
in biting terra tii'nia, Engels and his assist-
ant sin-eemled in getting another lasso over
the animal‘s head. l

Tllhen, with Engels pulling on one side of
: him and the helper on the other. the horse :7

was pulled in between a peddler's wagon and i
an irg-e cart, being: tied securely to the latter l

vehicle with both ropes. It took the horse 3

about ﬁve minutes to wreck the peddler's
f wagon: then he proceeded to devote consider-
5 able attention to the ice wagon; this was.
tonic-her than the pediiller‘s wagon and stood
“the strain better. but the equine marvel from
:he V“l{ide‘VVewoodHorse Market succeeded in
.,_.,V—;,iuttin;:_ it. in'slieli condition that repairs will
be necessary before it is used again.

Engels ﬁnally decided that the horse was
mad and sent a. messenger to the ofﬁce of
the S. I), (Z‘. A.’. asking to have. an oﬁice;
sent down to shoot, the animal. Ofﬁcer De
Nyse was dispatched to. the scene of hos—
tilities, and found the horse monarch of all l
he surgeyed. 2 He had wrecked:everything I
in. the yard. and was just starting" on the
tonce when De. Nyse reached. the. stable.
VV hen the oﬁicer entered the yard the horse
midmied the fence and proceeded to make
matters interesting for 'De Nyse. Tllt’! latter:
succeeded in reaching the top of the 13.5.1

Inspector Clark’s Reply to, Dog Owner WhoV
' Complained of Animal Society Methods.

Inspector F. 0. Clark, Superintendent
of the Brooklyn branch of the Seeiety for
the Prevention of Cruelty to animals. at.

13 ~Willoughby street. was, seen yestercl
regarding the complaint or a. Flatbu .
dog owneﬁ: who claimed that the socle 21V
was ignoringa court decision, by conﬁs-
eating unlicensed dogs. The complaint
referred to the summoning of dogVOWDQI‘S;
to court to compel theinto obtain annuab
licenses as unjust. particularly aa-somt-.
times happened during the month of
April, which necessitated procuring a re-
newal of the licenses in Maya.

When Mr. Clark’s attention wasVealled ..
to the. complaint, he smiled and intimated 3.
that'tbe complaining dog owner was Just

a triﬂe mixed in part ofhls statements.
“Yes. sir,” he. said, “we are conﬁscatmgV
dogslvvlicrever we ﬁnd one without the .
necessary license and do so with due au- .V:
thority prescribed by the lap/SEE 1894.a.nd

 

amended in 1895. This particu r law is
an act for the better protecti n of lost.
and strayed animals and for securing the. V
,rights of owners. Sections of this law 1i
‘ read: .
“Every person who owns or harbors
one or more dogs within the corporate
limits of any city having a population ot 31,
over 8.00.000. shall procure a yearly license
and pay the sum of $2 for each dog. L1-
censes granted under this act shall date
from the. first day of May in each year
and must be renewed prior to the expira-
tion of the term by the payment ot $1 for
each renewal. Dogs not licensed pursu—
ant. to the provisions of this act shall be
seized and if not ri-rltwiued within forty- .
eight hours. may be destroyedVor other- .
wise disposed of at the discretion of the V
society. Any person claiming a dog or Cat '
Seized undere the provisions of this not
and proving ownership thereof, shall be
entitled to resume possession of the ani-
mal upon payment of the. sum of $3, pro-
vided. however. that such claim shall be
‘ made before the expiration of the forty—
eight hours as provided in section {‘in0.
‘ The American Society for the Prevention
of C uelty to Animals is hereby empow-
' cred and authorized to carry out the pro-
visions of this not. and the said society!
is further authorized to issue the license
and renewals: and to collect the fees there-
for. as herein preserilmd. provided. how—
ever. that the said society shall defray
the cost of carrying out the. provisions of 3
this act and maintaining a shelter forl
lost. strayed or homeless animals. I
Any person who owns or liarbrn-s a dog: 1
without complying: with the proviSions Vol
this act shall be deemed guilty of (lis—

 

 

 

 

Oi‘dci‘lv conduct. and upon conviction
thereof before any Magistrate shall be
ﬁned for suel' offense any sum not ex—

ceeding: fill”! and in default. of. l)(l_‘\'lllF‘lll. of
such line. may be committed to prison by .
such ‘. agistrate until the some be paid, I
l
l
l
.
l

 

but such imprisonment, shall not exceed
ten days."

"This law.” resumed inspector
“was prepared to cover the entire part
of what is now the greater city. Justice
London‘s decision in relation to dogs and
their owners (lo-es not. affect this law in g
the least for the reason that it refers to l
the City 0t Albany which is covered by l
an entirely different law and his decision
was made in reference to the law under
which the society in that city works and
does not, touch our law in the. least.
Judge London is a member of the Appel-
late Division of Albany. in his decision
he said that. the. society had no right to
ienter a. person’s premises to seize an
animal. but was at liberty to summon
the dog owner to court and compel him
to Show cause. During the past year we
caused in the neighborhood of 1.800 sum—
lmons to be issued and each had the (le~
fslred effect. So long as the. law exists
we. intend carrying it. out to tlk letter.
Besides this people jump at conclusions
too quick. for if they consider the. law
they will ﬁnd that it is a protection for
owners of valuable animals. They must
comply with it. I cite the case» of Mr.
Friend of Gravesend who made a test
case and resulted in his being ﬁned for
contempt. by Justice Steers._ For the. pro-
tection of the licensed dog the society
offers a reward of $25 for the. arrest and
conviction of any person found stealing
a dog bearing a license tag of the so-

V TOWN TALK AND DOINGS.

“There is no such society in this State,” writes
on the letter-

i
t
l the secretary,
: head of “The American Society for the Preven-
in correcting a

or somebody else,

jtion of Cruelty to Animals,"
[most glaring error of The Standard Union,
5 when, on last week \Vednesluy, it referred to
lthe organization as the York" Society.
l The Standard Union is also obliged to confess
E that it referred to John P. Haines as “superm-
Etendent." Mr. Haines directs his secretary, or
fwhcever the gentleman is, to say that he is
l of the American Society. It is a
‘society that has done so much good in New
1 York and elsewhere that one can easily overlook

the personal eccentricity or its president.

“New

“President"

 

Speaking of the society from its local point
of view, the branch in this city, with its odice
in Willoughby street, it may be remarked that
Mr. Clarke, who has charge of it, is getting
things into shape for the execution of the pro—
posed new dog and cat law, whenever it becomes
a law in fact. Mr. Clarke and the assistants
he will have, uniformed and gentlemanly, will
afford no suggestion of the ertal dog catcher,
F but they will “get there” by more gentle means.
lThe licensed dog with a collar and tag number

on him can go at large unmolested, except by
lthe casual thief who will steal at any time.
lThe ofﬁcials are salaried. There are no pre-
l miums
.4 licensed can be taken and quietly chloroformod

paid for capturing dogs, but the un-

The Status of Dogs and Cuts.

In framing a bill to be presented at
Albany for deﬁning the status of (_‘Lti$
and dogs in large cities, Mayor Schieren
. and Corporation Counsel McDonald have
l performed a. valuable service. Under the
lproposed measure, cats occupying posi-

 

 

tions of respectability are to be supplied
with collars, bearing the names and resi-
dences of their owners, and all felines
found wandering about which are not
thus decorated may be seized and dis-

posed of. The same bill provides that a

license fee of $2 shall be paid after May
1 by all owners of dogs, and the canines
as well as the felines must wear a c

0113?.
, haying a metal tag attached, bearing the

; number of the license.

 

Unlicensed dogs
are. to be seized, and if not redeemed
within forty-eight hours, they are to be
destroyed and disposed of at the discrc- l
tion of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals. Dogs may be re-
claimed wit‘hin forty-eight hours, if they
have been seized, by the payment of $3.
Penalties are imposed for interfering
with the agents of the society w

1112 done there now, but we hope. that the pro-
posed legislation may be accomplished In order
that our Operations in Brooklyn may be extend-

in New York. smoklyn people will,.l am sure,
be pleased to have the present very inadequate
system displaced by one that has operated
with such great success here already: I drew
the bill last year for New York and It became
a law. It has now been in operation for eight
months and I am in receipt of hundreds of
letters from people all over this city commend—
ing the new order of things and thanking me
for securing the passage of the law and the
wav in which it is being enforced. The scolety's
efforts have been constantly directed toward the
extension of the work wherever possiblc,and Iain
glad to say, within the last ﬁve years its sphere
of usefulness has been more than twenty times
extended. There is one misconception, how—
ever. which I wish, it possible. to remove re-
garding the society. Many people believe that
it is independently wealthy and tliereioie 1106ng
no pecuniary assistance in furthering lbs wort.
This is iar from beina’ a fact- The 20(31-

l the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, of which
the Earl of- Harrowsby was at. that time presi-
dent. Its birth took place April 10, in Clinton;
hall, and its charter members were many of the
most eminstnt citizens of the city and state 05.
New York. Its history, as told in ()ur Animal?
Friends, the society‘s official journal, is as fol-o.
lows: “On April 19, in the szuno year, Mr.
Berni} secured the passage by the legislature of»
New York of the ﬁrst law ever enacted in this
country for the protection of animals. it provided

i that “every person who shall, by his act or

I neglect, maliciously kill, maim, wound, injure,

ltorture or cruelly beat any horse, mule, cow.

|

 

cattle, sheep or other animal, belonging to him—‘
I sell or another, shall, upon conviction. be ad—
' judge-i guilty of a misdemeanor.” The purpose
of the association. as set forth in its constitu~
l tion, was “to provide «xii'ocijve means for the
l prevention of cruelty to animals throughout;
I the United States, to enforce all laws which
I

 

then were or might thereafter be enacted for
the protection of animals. and to secure, by
lawful means. the arrest and conviction of all
persons found violating: such lavas.” .

'Within twelve months, however, another “act.
I for the more oilectual prevention oi' cruelty to;
animals” was passed by the legislature of the
same state. and from time to time additions
have been 'mntie to it, so that l'l‘lt‘t‘u is now .-
hardiy a phase of cruelty which the society has; .
not the legal power to prevent Wllilill the boun-
daries of the state of Now Lock.

to their work. The American Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals is a case
in point. It is a little over twenty-ﬁve years
since the ﬁrst society was organized by Henry
Berg to labor for the prevention of inhumani-
ties to dumb beasts, and since then similar
organizations have been formed in various
parts of the United States, which are doing

 

 

 

There hasﬂrecently been addﬁd.,t°.- the 10133 J

‘l list of humanitarian organizations ot'this Olly 1

lthe Brooklyn Woman‘s Dumb Animal Aid?
lAssoclation, which has for its object the-3
helpng on of the branch of the American“
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to,
Animals which is located in this CitY- No
more appropriate work could be selected by
women than that of relieving the sufferings
of dumb beasts, which are frequently the
victims of human animals who are quite un-
worthy of being called beasts.

Just now this association is directing its
efforts to the collection of funds for the erec~
tion of a building where the work can be
more eﬂiciently done than is possible under
present conditions. As one of the means of
furthering this object, the ladies have decid-
ed to hold a garden festival on the grounds,
1444 Paciﬁc street, on next Wednesday night,
when it is hoped that a large addition
to the funds of the organization will be se- ,
cured. The entertainment should be support- I
cd, because of its merits, and because of the i
noblé objects to which the proceeds are to be t
devoted. I

Notwithstanding the multiplication of so- ,
cletles for the prevention of cruelty to ani-
mals, there is a great deal of unnecessary T
‘ suffering, and brutes in human shape who,
are guilty of the most atrocious acts go un- ;
whipped of justice. These ladies now offer
a rare opportunity to persons who are fond
oi! animals, who do not believe that they
should be made to suffer unnecessarily, and
who desire to give a. practical expression to
their sentiments. The promoters of the sum-
1 met-night’s entertainment have worked faith—
fully in season and out of season to secure
funds to keep the work of relieving and pro-
tecting dumb animals in this city going. They
are worthy of and should receive the utmost

 

 

 

 

encouragement.

DUMB ANIMALS REMEMBERED. ,l
Lawn Party of the Brooklyn Women’s I
Dumb Animal Aid Society. ‘
Miss Blanche D. Small is an active little
woman who is very fond of animals. Her
home is full of pots of all kinds and part of
it is set aside for the reception of “810k dogs
1 and cats which Miss Small doctors herself,
and then sends them on their way rejoicing.
Dumb animals have a champion in her of.
which they might well feel proud. She had
long felt that the efforts of the Brooklyn
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to

Animals were not as effective as they might
have been with the well-organized assrst-
ance of those who sympathized with dumb
beasts. She put her ideas into practical
shape in the latter part of last August by
organizing the Brooklyn Women’s Dumb
Animal Aid Society. The society has now
some thirty-five members, and a. good sum
in the treasury. It has no stated head-
quarters, but at present hold their meetings
at one anothers’ homes.

It was but nine days ago that they decided
to hold a lawn party, the object b61112 to
. raise funds to be turned over to the Brook-
‘lyn Society for the P. C. A. The lawn
:party was held last night on the .grounds
surrounding the private unoccupied r951-
idence at 1,444. Paciﬁc street, which was
‘ given for the occasion. Everything except
the music and a few articles on the package
table were presented. .

The commodious grounds were lighted
with hundreds of Japanese lanterns and
decorated with ﬂags and buutlug. An 1m-
promptu entertainment CODBlS$1ﬂg_0f vocal
and instrumental music and recitations was
rendered in the parlors while the band dis-
coursed sweet music on the .veranda. In
an upper ﬂoor of the building Miss Ida
Elkins had charge of the ‘menagerie. A
large business was done at tne refreshment
table under the charge of Mrs. J. D.
Anthony and Mrs, Gleason, and a. band of
pretty gypsies told fortunes in a tentat the
rear of the house. Miss Glover precided at
the lemonade well, while thOSBT who loved
ﬂowers Datronized Mrs. Arthur V an Ostrand
and Miss Ella. Bissau. Mrs. De Latour pre-
sided at the candy booth. l‘hcpackasd
booth was under the direction of Miss
Blanche D. Small, assisted by the Misses
Annie Davis and Winnie Supple. ,

The Committee of Arrangements, were
Mrs. Gleason, Mrs. Schmidt, Miss hiking,
Miss Dalzell, Mrs. Touedeberg and Mrs.
Derrigrand.

Brooklyn Ladies Now Interested in
Their Behalf. ‘

The dumb animals have the women now ﬁght
ing for their rights, and this organization of fe— _
male Berghs has already assumed quite formid-
able proportions. The BFOOklyn Woman’s Dumb
Animal Aid ASSOClﬂUO‘ﬂ gave a gardenﬁff
festival Wednesday on the grounds of the man~
Bion located at NO- 1444 Paciﬁc street. The,
scene reminded one of a. pagofrom Shakespeare’s
“ Midsummer Night} Dream,” or " As You
Like it.” Fairies and gypsies ﬂit-ted to and fro»
across the greensward. and the moon‘s celestial
beams agsjsted the Chinese lanterns to illuminate .
the surroundings. The house, the piazzas and
the parterrcs were decorated With ﬂags of everyr
hue and every nation. While men and women
were having their fortunes told or were delyjng 1
into the sweets of a plate of ice cream a. band /
' played soft and loving airs ‘from
the porch and the pari’ume of ﬂowers scented
the air. A little donkey, not long from Texas,
carried children many times around the green ,
for5cents. Mr. Donald Burns, or New rork,
loaned the society a number of animals, includ-
inaa monkey, an armadillo and some prairie >-
dogs. These vere allexhibited on the second,
ﬂoor of the house, and they attracted many
persons and many pennies.

The gypsy encampment had a. score or two of
dark-eyed beai'ities, among them ‘being Mrs.
J. D. Dalzell and the Misses Cane, Porter. Her-
ries, Jackson, Moog, Madge, Glover, Gray.

The candy store was cared tor by Miss De la.
Tour, Miss Cane and Mrs. Napier, and the :
ﬂoral temple by Mrs. Van hostrand and Miss
Foster. The wild beasts were tamed by the
presence of Miss Elkms.

Mrs. Dalzell told the CITIZEN reporter that
the festival was for the aid of the building
fund of the American Seeiety for the Preven-
tion of Cruelty to Animals. The society .18
an adjunct of the Brooklyn association located
on Fulton street, between Pearl and Adams.

FESTEVAL Alli) PACKAGE SALE
Fora. Building; Entire: for the Soonety‘ to”
Prevent. Cruelty to Airiniaﬁe. 3

The Brooklyn Woman’s Dumb Animal Aid
association held a garden festival and package
sale Wednesday afternoon and evening at 1,444.
Paciﬁc street in aid of the building fund for a.
Brooklyn home for the American Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

A friend of the association who owns the,
large vacant house at 1,444 Paciﬁc street con?
tributed the use of the property to the friends
of the dumb animals. From being adreary:
looking house, with spacious grounds, poorly
kept, the members of the association trans-
formed it in a single day into a combination of
scenes from Fairyland, “The Arabian. Nights,”
church fairs, museums of natural history, cou-

, leCtlonﬁ‘i‘Y stores, gypsy camps and other
3 Places. Hundreds of lanterns were hung about

the house and strung from tree to tree all

around the grounds, scores of ﬂags and stream-
rs ﬂoated in the light breeze from the piazzas.

waved from the branches of trees and bright-

; ened the interior of: the house.

, A winding walk extended through the :
grounds, and removed a short distance from it i
were the several booths. The ﬁrst one, the
package table, was in charge of lilies Blanche
Small, Miss Winnie Supple and Miss Annie
Davis. Hundreds of packages, carefully folded
so that one could not even guess what was in-
side of them, were offered for sale at diilerent
prices. Each purchaser was supposed to get
full value, and if it proved otherwise there was
the consolation of money expended in a good
cause. There were also a number of ﬁne paint—
invs which were rallied off.

Mrs. Mildred Dalzelle was in cl argc of a.
small camp of gypsies and thoy’toldlortunes‘
with an easy disregard for truth Which was
simply charming, They also sang and danced.
Mrs. Belle Van Nostrancl and Miss Ella Sisson.
sold flowers from a. tastefully trimmed bower.
Mrs. De Latour sold candy, and was assisted by
several Young: girls. Within the house wasa.
room in which a number of rare animals were
kept caged, and where many curious objects

_ familiar to natural historians were exhibited. ,

. In a lot, back of the house, a patient donkoy.‘

; carried little children ones around for 10 cents.

He was exceedingly popular. Refreshments

were served by a. well known caterer. During

the evening there was music and dancing. '
The ofﬁcers of the association, which nOW

has twenty-live members, are Mrs. A. I).

Schmid, president ; Mrs. J. D. Daizello, secre-

tary, and Mrs. Blanche D. Small, treasurer.

George F. Elliott and his Wife were present all

the cvenino,‘ and assisted in making it pleasant:

for the friends of the association.

TALE OF A CAT

But It Is Out of the Usual, and l
Therefore “'01-“: Reading. .
A particularly lively feline and twol
ofﬁcers of the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals caused lots of
amusement for the small boy and
loungers on li'illoughbystreet, near Jay,
the other afternoon. There was nothing

i

l

l
l
in the general appearance of the cat l
to warrant even a lurking; suspicion l
:hat It had ever been potted or pam— l
pered. and as the necessary ribbon was l
lacking from the neck there was every 9
l

l

 

 

ONLY—Til

reason to believe that no household
would go into mourning over its loss.
The S. l’. C. A. ofﬁcers took this view
of the Case. and decided to gather pussy
In. Then the fun began. Coaxing was
ﬁrst tried. and was successful as far as
letting,- the ofﬁcers approach within a.
few feet of the prey. Then with a
nimble jump the cat was out of reach.
'l‘his was repeated several times, and
the onlookers began to offer suggestions.
“Put some salt on its tail,” remarked
one. “(let him a mouse,” volunteered
another, and when one parltlcularly
facetious individual added that they 9
ought to call out the ﬁre department:
and drown him out, the ofﬁcers began ,
to look bored. They were perspirlng
freely as well. Some of the future
voters essayed to help, but all they did
was to make pussy all the more lively.
Another chase up and down the side-
walk and in the roadway followed with
like success.
. Some one called “time,” and the S. P.
C. A. men determined on a ﬁnal move.
Two or three small boys were ranged
along the 0other to prevent pussy from
breaking away from the walk. Then
the men approached, one from each end.
The cat vainly tried one after another ‘
of the doors and windows of .the shops,
and ﬁnding a door slightly agar in one,
slipped in. Then the prey was bagged.
It took nearly ﬁfteen minutes to catch
that cat. ‘

The little court room was Crowded Ex-

Assistant District Ath-torney John U._ Shorter
appeared for the sports and George- F. Elli-

out for the society for the Society for the

Prevmtion of Cruelty to Animals. The best
part of an hour was consumed in the exam-

ination and select ion of the jury, as one or
two of the tatlesmen were particularly dense.
F One man named 002115,th lives in the vi—
. cinity where the cock ﬁght was to take place,
7 said in reply to Mr. Eliiot‘t that'he didn’t;

know Whether or not the had ever attended a
. cock ﬁgl‘ut
“Whv don’ t you know?” asked Mr” Elliott
“ Because it’s so long” _
“What do you consider a cock ﬁchtw’
“I’m no judge.” " '

1 Mr. Elliott challenged the juror and. he
' was permitted to go.

Philip Schweickert, who said he was,:a
brother, created some amusement, by his
description of-a cock ﬁght. In rich dialect
be declared that he didn’t think. it. was, a
f ock ﬁght if the birds got together them~
suites but if men put them against each
other, he considered that was cock ﬁghting
and a violation of '1the law.

‘1 man named Quinn was eccepted by both
sides. He said he had been a farmer and a
policeman and a lot of other things, although
at present he we doing nothing. When
Mr. Elliott asked him whether he had any
objection to cock ﬁghting.

“We'll, ” said the juror, .“I have 1' eased a
gm (1 many chickens myself and I like to see 1
coo 11s ﬁghting, but I don? t like a prize cock
ﬁg ht. ”

John S Rider was challenged by Mr. Short-

er on the ground that he was a member of
the church and on his admission 1111.111 he Was
biased aig'aims 1t; cbck ﬁghting.
. A jurbr was selected at 11: 30 and themMr
iShor’teir formally moved that the case We dis-
'missed, because as no ﬁg'l' t had itakén place,
11tlher'e was no case against his clients: He
argued that a man might have murder in his
heart, but he could not be indicted for mur—
der because of the thought. - 2 '

His hcnor declined to dismiss the case.

, Mr. Elliott brieﬂy pointed out the law gov-
erning the case and then called Commanding
Sergeant Abe J. Lees, who said thet‘t on infor-
mation he received on January 13,? he went to
the blacksmith shop with Sergeant McCamen
and saw several men there, some or Whom
triedt to escape. They were brought back.
He saw the pit there and one of' the, men
said2~ “Ca-p, you’ re too quick- for 11s.. Here.

boo AND (SAT OWNERS, OBSERVE.

 

Public attention is called to the 110W dog
law to be found in the advertising columns
of THE CITIZEN. It is, as has been already
'said by us, a law that is :in the interest of
the animals, as well as of their owners. and
is highly commendable for the reasons
which we have set forth at length on
various occasions, and principally because
it puts the work of keeping down the ting
and cat population within reasonable
bounds into humane and honest hands in
f committing it to the Society for the Pro
1' vention of Cruelty to Animals. And here
we quote from the letter of President
Haines of the society for the edit‘ication oi'
dog and cat owners. He says :

 

ished. and the city dog—catchers are now
out of ofﬁce. The society will establish a
‘Shelter for Lost, Strayed and Homeless
Animals,’ to which stray animals will be
taken and where they will be held forty-
eight hours to allow owners to redeem
them. Lost dogs bearing the liCl‘liH" tag
of this society, found by our men, will bu
taken to the ‘ Shelter’ and the owners will
be immediately notified, and, upon proving

dogs without charge for redemption; and.
as you will see by referring to the last
paragraph of the advertisement. this society
offers a reward of $25 for the arrest and
conviction of any person found stealing
dogs bearing license tags, which reward is
also a protection to the owners. The men
employed by this society to remove from
the streets unlicensed dogs and cats with-
out collars, have a distinctive uniform of
brown Bedford cord and a. badge bearinfr
the initials of this society, namely. ‘.\. i:

nance requiring the mouth-hr
mouth-perspiring dog to wear a muzzle dt

THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR THE' PRE-

VENTION OF CRUELTY TO ANIMALS
TO TAKE ACTION.

”M!—

SAYS THAT HORSES
CRUELLY

AN AGENT OF THE SOCIETY

DESIGNED FOR SLAUGHTER ARE

TREATED—DISEASED ANIMALS ARE FRE—

QUENTLY BUTCHEREDaTHE FLAT—-

LANDS PLACE SAID TO

BE A NUISANCE-

The American Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to‘ Animals is about to make a deter-
mined effort to prevent the granting of a permit
to Henry Bosse, who, as told in The Tribune
yesterday, conducts a horsenslaughtering estab—
lishment in Rockaway—ave.. Flatlands.

Late Thursday night Frank 0. Clark, who has
charge of the society’s Brooklyn ofﬁce. accom—
panied by two detectives, went to Bosse’s place
in the hope of making several arrests. Upon
their arrival at the slaughter-house, the trio
were joined by another detective who had been
secreted in the building for several hours after
sunset. He reported to Mr. Clark that Frank
Sheeman, the buyer for Bosse,A had brought
seven horses to the main door shortly before
7 o’clock. Two of these were brought into the
big room where the killing is done, and through
the agency of several blows with a stout club
they were dispatched. They had already been
quartered and'hung up, when the detectives
entered the building.

The latter made a careful examination of the
ﬁve remaining animals, and convinced them-
selves that none of the horses were diseased,
although they were in various stages of de-
formity. One gray mare particularly attracted
the. attention of the ofﬁcers. It had a bad
shoulder wound, but in every other way was
sound. While the ofﬁcers were making a tour
of Bosse’s place, Superintendent Hankinson and
Drs. Evans and Batten went to another slaugh-
ter-house in 'Woodhaven, where they found thir-
teen starving horses that had not been given
any food or water for days. The bones pro—
truded from the ﬂesh of the animals, and they
were. really in a dilapidated condition. The so—
ciety’s doctors examined them, and the superin-
tendent gave directions to have them killed at
men who were working about the
arrested, and were held by Judge
~Henderson, of Jamaica, in $100 bail for ex—
amination. The prisoners gave thei’ names as
Frank Wolf, August Castado, Philip Kelly and
Joseph Renaud. The latter is said to be the
proprietor of the place. ‘

Mr. Clark, when seen by a Tribune reporter
in his ofﬁce yesterday afternoon. said: “We have
received many complaints to the effect that
horses taken into Bosse’s place are kept for
days previous to their death without food or
water. Then they are taken there in great
numbers, I am convinced that this is the case.
The horses are purchased at a few dollars a
head, and, of course, the proprietor cannot af—
ford to feed them. The horses which we ex—
amined on Thursday night had no contagious
disease. We witnessed the killing of several
animals, and I asked if they had been previously
examined by a veterinary. One of the employes
told me they had, which was a lie.

“I do not favor the bringing of this horse—
slaughtering place under the jurisdiction of the
Health Department, for the reason that it would
take more time and expense than the ordinary
person can imagine to see that the laws are
observed in connection with such an establis.—

once. Four
place were

ment as that run by Bosse. I saw enough
there, as I informed Dr. Emery, to justify

the Health Department in knocking out the
business entirely. The place is ﬁlthy, and every~
thing in connection with it is conducted in di-
rect violation of all sanitary ordinances. Blood
is allowed to run in great quantities across the
ﬂoor to a hole in the correr of the building,
through which it passes into a barrel.”

Right here Mr. Clark was asked what the
ﬁnal disposition of this blood was, and he re—
ied: “I asked that same question at the Health
Department this morning, and I was told by a
doctor, whose name I will not mention, that it
found its way to the sugar reﬁneries.”
Continuing, Mr. Clark said: “The slaughtering
of animals in Bosse’s place is done during the
night, for a reason which is obvious. ~An em—
..y'ploye told me that the horseflesll is cut up,
fsalted and packed in barrels at night, and that
the‘place is cleaned up in contemplation of visits
during the following day from some ofﬁcial of
the Department of Health.

“The statement of Dr. Volckening, to the
effect that diseaszd animals are not killed at
Bosse’s place, is untrue. I know of the discov—
ery of two glandered horses in a Maspeth
slaughter-house, which was at that time con-
ducted by Bosse. Dr. McLean, of our society,
has the lungs or one of the animals now. I
am opposed to the granting of a permit, and if
the Health Department will do its share to
prevent it, we will also do ours. Dr. Volcken-
ing also says that an owner can get more for
a glandered horse by observing the law than
by selling it to Bosse. Well, any man with
common-sense would know that a horse is
worth more when alive than. dead if it 'is a ‘
healthy one. Those that are only ﬁt to kill
are certainly unﬁt for human food.

“Before I left Flatlands on Thursday night I
was told that the Department of Health had
issued a permit to Bosse for the continuance
of his horse-killing place within the city limits
landhad also awarded him a contract for the
.rﬁmgval of dead animals fromthe new Wards of.

HOT TIMES AT A COOKING MAIN.

A Cry of Police Stopped the Main—An Ab;
tempted Hold—up. [

Over 300 sporting men of all types gath-l
cred at Michael Kearny’s National hotel
on 'Greenpoint avenue, Allissville, lastl
night in anticipation of seeing a lint- cock— l
ing main. One ﬁght had been pulled off!
when a cryof police went up and some}

’ of the sports and friends rushed down the

stairs, while other jumped from the. vin—

society had, in a quiet way. got
The olllcers
could not obtain a warrant from a judg-
during the day, and at night, while the
fighting was going on they informed Kear—
ny that they were going to raid the place.
Kearny raised the cry of police and the
pit and other paraphernalia was out of
sight in less time than it takes to tell
it. Then it was that the disgruntled
sports began to look amund for another
place in which to pull off the main.
Kear‘ny’s place is where the dead Non-V
pariel was to have fought his second bat-,'
tie, which was interrupted by a posse or.
deputy sheriffs. The place has been one
in which cock ﬁghts were the rule. Last.
night the reputable sports were in the;
majority in attendance, and when an in—
nocent spectator had left the house with
a f‘niend was held up by a gang of tough
sports from the Fifteenth ward, the hotter
element took a hand in and scared the life
out of Farmer and his gang. They had
to take to their heels, and the man whoml
they held up happened to be a reporter‘
who applied to-day for warrants for their
arrest. Artie-r disposing of the crowd at
Kearny’s the sports from Brooklyn ar-
ranged several private ﬁghts, w-hich were
pulled off a short distance from the Na-
tional. The Brooklyn contingent won all
the money, leaving J'erseyites who backed
their birds, with car fare to go home.

lrefused, as the animal was unable to:

“ ered about, and the driver. was ﬁnallyl
compelled to walk the animal to the;
sidewalk. l
Here an ofﬁcer of the S. P. C. A. came
running up, and excitedly demanded to
know who moved the horse. and when i,
the driver said he was compelled to do
so by Sergt. Hayes, the S. P. C. A. man
remarked: “If I had been here I would.
have locked him up!” ‘1
Sergt. Hayes afterwards heard of the?
remark and located the oﬁicerin Fed—i

meant. 3

“Are you a veterinary surgeon?” l
“No,” answered the . C. A. of—i

should be done in a case of this kind.” 3
“You were going to lock me up for
doing my duty. Now why don’t you do
it?” queried Sergt. Hayes._ And the of~
ﬁcer of the society, avoidlng the ques~
tion, said, while the crowd about the.
butcher shop grew larger: “That poori
animal was in pain and should not have“.
been moved.” 1
“Why, there » are policemen going“.
around with their heads cut open, and;
yet they have to keep themselves and;

they are to be considered less than a
horse. These are riotous times, and if :
I can avoid a riot by moving a horse‘
,I am gomg to do so,” answered Hayes.
The crowd cheered, and the S. P. C.
A. ofﬁcer was hustled away, the crowdl
yelling: “Why don't you lock him up?“

Howard Hashour, the South Woodhaven
,1, horse factory” proprietor, and ﬁve of his
employees, who were arrested January 23
”and 24 and bailed, had a hearing before
Justice Hendrickson at Jamaica yesterday.

Hashour was found guilty of thecharge,
that of permitting the doomed animals to

go without food or water, and he was ﬁned
$50, or in default to spend six months in
' the county Jail, the highest penalty pOSSI~
ble in a justice’s court.

l The other defendants,
I

l

  
  

 

 

Joseph Renaud.
Philip Kelly, August Capobus, Frederick
VVOlif and Victor Weirsbouski, his em—

\ ployees, Were discharged, the court giving
them the beneﬁt of the fact that they, as

'. employees, were not responsible for the
horses having no food.

It came out on the examination that the
ﬂesh of the slaughtered animals is sold for
human consumption, probably in the form
of Frankfurt sausage,

The arrests were the result of an inves—
tigation instituted by the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and were
made by Ofﬁcers Noble and Evans on war-
rants issued by Justice Hendrickson.

At the hearing yesterday Counselor
George F. Elliott of Brooklyn, appeared
for the prosecution and Counselor James C.
Van Siclen, of J amaica,for the defendants.

Joseph Renaud, one of the defendants,

a boy of 15, is the son of a‘ man with whom
Hashour has intimate business relations.
The horse meat, as it was shown, is shipped
to Belgium and Renaud handles it in that
city. The boy was examined by Mr. El—
liott as to the feed in the factory. He
1 said the horses were fed oats since January
1,8 twice, but he could not remember the‘E
‘. dav. ,

Dr. Eugene C. Batten, a veterinarian of l

- the society, testiﬁed to going to the estab— l,
C‘ . ,. ‘ﬂ lishment on January 23, accompanied by 1

l i ll ’ " Ofﬁcer Evans. There were fou 'teen horses ‘

u there then; one was just. being slaughtered

as the two men arrived. Upon learning

that the meat was used for food the doctor

ordered that three of the animals be set on 7
one side. One of them had an open joint
from which the lubricating oil was run-
ning, another milk—leg and the third
elephantiasis, an aggravated form of milk—
leg. He found the animals starving and .

3 directed that oats be “given them. The

inext day he visited the place again, and

upon inquiry he found he found the ani-

. mals had notbeen fed cats. The feed or—

,dered was procured on the second visit. I

9. One of the poor animals was too weak to

eat it, while the others devoured it vorac- j

iously. He said one of the original horses 1

had been substituted by another. The only ‘

feed the doctor could ﬁnd in the place‘was 2

salt hay, and much of that was saturated V

with blood. He said the horses did not;
eat it. The witness said large holes were
l

gnawed in the woodwork in the stalls. ‘

There were eight horses in the place, ﬁve V

in the shed and three tied outside, on the

1, . ' second day. The rlay was cold and the .

animals were shivering on the windward

i, side of the building. He said the neighbor—

1 mg trees were gnawed, and some had

. topped over because of the trunks being

gnawed through. A branch gnawed into
fibre was shown in court.

Ofﬁcers Evans and Noble corroborated the
doctor’s testimony.

‘ The case for the prosecution being closed
Counselor Van Siclen asked for the dis1
charge of the employees on the ground that
they were not responsible for the horses notr
having proper food. ‘

Counselor Elliott opposed, declaring that
"under the statute they were equally liable
with their employer.

, Judge Hendrickson denied the motion.
. 4 g The defense put forward Night W atch-
,_: ‘, man Alfred Fenn. He testiﬁed to feeding
' . the horses outs on the 23d. Salt hey, how-

ever, was the menu of the establishment.
On cross~cxamination Mr. Elliott asked

3: : f i The witness s0.- he would not say as to
f, that and then w «drew from the case

rather than answei any more questions.

The defense put on Dr. Van Siclen, vet—
erinarian for the “ factory.” He said he
examined the horses alleged to have the
diseases testified to by Dr. Batten, and he
found them sound.

To meet this the prosecution sought to
showthat the horses had been changed.

.Both sides summed up very earnestly and
his honor called up the employee defend-
A,a,nts and discharged them, as stated. Then

HORSE SLiUGHTERER FINED.
Owner of the Ryder’s ‘Vo'o'ds Snu—
' Sage Factory Pays $50 for Treat-

ing Animals Cruelly.

JAMAICA, Feb. 13,rHoward Hashour,
proprietor of the horse slaughter-house
in Ryder’s woods, at South Woodhaven,
and his employees, Joseph Renaud,
Philip Kelly, August Capobus, Frederick
\Volff and Victor W'eirsbouski, were
tried before Justice Hendrickson to-day.
AS already told in The VVCl‘ld, the men
Were arrested in January by Ofﬁcers A-
E- Evans and John l’oble, of the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Ani—

mals.

Counsellor George F. Elliott, of Brook-
lyn, appeared for the society, and James
C- Van Sicklen, of Jamaica. for the pris-

oners. Exhibits such as butts of trees,
which the horses had eaten, and coarse
salted hay were put in evrdence by the
prosecution.

Dr. Batten testiﬁed that the horses
found at the. place were diseased. He
found all the hOI'SES, nunioerzng four-
teen, exposed in a northeast Wind. Jo—
seph Renaud had told him they never
gave the horses drink or food other than
the salt ha} ,

Dr. Van Sicklezn. V. M. D., of'Jamaica.
testiﬁed for the defense, and said he had
examined the horses referred to by r.
Batten, and found only one horse knuc-

 

 

kled on the off hind leg‘. '

The testimony for the defense was
that the employees had no money to
buy feed for the horses, but each 01 the
arrested men said that he had such

 

 

 
     

 

  
    
    

     
   

 

 

the horses fed oats, but could _not state
how often. Counsellor Van SIC‘RlCll, lll
summing up, asked that the live em-
ployees be discharged, as they WQI‘C‘llol
the cause of the horses being deprived
of food.

Counsellor Elliott asked that a. small
ﬁne be placed against each of the em-
ployees, and that Hashour be not fined
but imprisoned. In the beginning or his
summing up Counsellor Elliott said that
horse—slaughtering in the town would
be stepped, and that it was a disgrace
to civilized America. Justice Hendrick—
son discharged the ﬁve employees and
fined H-aisyhour $50.

Couatty Dog night.

, . A very well developed bull pup was tenderly
' held up in front of Justice Connolly this morn-
? ing by Superintendent Frank Clark of the S. P.
L C. A. The court looked just a. triﬂe uneasy and
l the pup was dismissed for the moment. Super-
intendent Clark introduced the dog as the prin-
cipal exhibit in a case of alleged cruelty to
animals. The defendant in the matter Was
Michael N. Brown, ayoung man who lives at
.‘11-9.North Elliott place, and claims to be em—
ployed at the navy yard. .

It appears that Brown and three companions
were ﬂushed in a lot near the corner of Myrtle
and Gates avenues very early this morning by
Patrolman Francis Womyss of the Cedar street
station. Three of the group escaped but Brown
was caught and in his keeping Wemyss found a
bag. In the bag was the bull pup and it was
Subsequently developed that the quartet had
just returned from a Queens county dos: ﬁght
when surprised by the policeman. Brown was
remanded for trial under bonds.

Sergeant Lees of the Twenty-second sub~pre—

adog light during the early morning hours in
the cellar of George Lyons’ saloon at Vernon
and Brooklyn avenues in the Twenty-ninth

learned all he could in a quiet way
about the coming event. The old inhab-

itants of Flatbush who told him .about
it did not seem to think he was doing Saloon-
keepor Lyons any harm. for dog fights, it is
said, have been common in certain sections of
the old town. and nobody dreamed that the po-
lice would take any notice of a little thing
like that. But Brooklyn policemen do not.
understand that feeling, and when Sergeant
Leos returned to the station in the town hall
and madearcpert to Commanding Sergeant.

It was 12 :30 A. M. when they left the

the policemen having marched with mufﬂed.
brogans through the dark clear up to the door—
way of Lyons’ place, surrounded the building,
Zimmerman and Kaiser boldly went to the
front door and demanded admission. ’

“What do you want?" asked Lyons.

“We went to examine your place,” said Zim-
merman and there was no opposition to their
ingress. The policemen examined the. entire
building but found only Lyons~the dog pit
and a 32 pound bull dog, which sat full of light
and bleeding from a dozen ‘ scars on the
cellar steps. A dog fight had unques-
t1onably. been in progress but the police
had arrived too late to make a successful
descent on the sports. A citizen told the
sergeant that there had been a look Out on the»
roof, who had warned the dog ﬁghters of the
approach of the pelice, but maybe the man who.
gave the information to Sergeant Lees repented
and gave the saloonkcoper the tip. The pit
was in the cellar. It was constructed.

AWAY WITH Mu'z'zin‘nsnnwpmooo
CATCHERS. ‘

I‘I‘cw York city has preceded Brooklyn in
the reform of the dog laws long since sug-
gested by THE Cl’l‘lZEN. The dog catchers

have been dismissed and their~ Olllccs abol- .

iscod, and the work of protecting the com-
llllll'llllj,’ from ﬁerce or otherwise daugorous
{logs has been given to more humane
hands.

The Society for the Prevention of (.Truelty
to Animals has taken charge of the diSposal
of he superﬂuous, and will do it in a way

least likely to shock the foolil'lgss of the

lemma“

sensitive. The not infrequent. spectacle: of
the past of a ferocious rufilan pulling: at one
end of a yelping animal while a screaming
female was pulling at the othor will in; seer-u
no more, and nobody’s promises \rll lw:
raided in search. of dogs ('(mtrnry to law.
The men who will be appointed by the
Society to pick up and make am; with
stray canines will be instructed to rival
humanely with them. and to hear mun--
eously the complaints of those persons who
claim them; and no Opportunity will in)

gaffordod to any employee. if possible, to
1’ Victimize a claimant by charging more than

the fee for redemption which is ﬁxed by law.

Thus the temptation heretofore held out
to tho predatory vagabomls in the (log—
catching business, to steal a valuable dog.
or even to rob the owner of. it in the 01m
street, and refuse to- rcloasc it except. i! r

an extortionate consideration, will In:
kavoided; though, we have no dmzbt. the

work of keeping the dog population vitllin
reason'r blc limits will be better performed
than ever before.

What New York has done in this regard
is a good example for Brooklyn; but liroolt-
lyn can better it by making similar arrange-
mentshcro, and by abolishing the ordinance
which requires a dog to wear a muzzle dur-
ing the hot weather. The muzzle has been
required up to the present because- tlic pub-
lic was under the impression that a dog was
more apt to go mad in hot weather than in
cold, and that if he have a muzzle on he
cannot blte anybody.

the president, Mr. John P. llains; the general
Superintendent, an. Charles H. llankinson,
and other chief ofﬁcers reside. At the head of
the Brooklyn oii'ices is lnspeclor Frank 0.
Clark, one of the most obliging, conscientious
and efficient ofﬁcers the organization pos-
sesses. lie- was born- in this city forty-three
years ago and educated at Public School No.
1'6. Always fond of animals, he joined the
society as an ofﬁcer is lit; "-1, and rising rapidly
in his new vocation, he became superintendent
at Brooklyn under the late Mr. lienry Bersh.
At that time the Brooklyn headquarters Went
under the name of the ”Brooklyn Agency of
the A. S. P. ”.11.,” but in 18:39 it was deemed
advisable by those in authority to change the
name from “lﬁroolilyn Agency” to “Brooklyn
Ofﬁce.” at the same time substituting for
superintendent the title of inspector, which
Mr. Clark assumed. Since his inspectorship
the institution here has enlarged its scope to
double its former extent, and it is earnestly
honed that soon the needed. funds Will be
forthcoming whereby the society may be en-
abled to erect a suitable building which will
be a credit to this city.

little Southern lizards, incorrectly designa-
netted chameleons, as ornaments, will inter;
est a. great many persons; for it appears,
that a very large trade has lately been done:
with these poor little creatures, it being one
of the latest “society” notions to wear them
on the part of both young men and young
women. The lizards are held fast by a.
small brass chain and pin to the coat lapel.
in the one case, and t0 the corsayge in the
other, and there they languish and suite]:
until death relieves them. _
The chameleon is popularly supposed to
live on air, and since these lizards have the ‘
name, it appears that no one thinks of feed—
ing them; and although active motion is
natural to them, they are not at liberty at
any time to get beyond the limited ﬁeld Of .
exercise indicated, while they are inside to
endure occasional exposures to changes of
temperature to which they are not adapted ‘
by/nature, and are otherwise abused, sim-

 

 

ply because the wearer or owner knows
i nothing whatever about their wants or
' habits. and does not think it worth while to
inquire.

That the treatment they receive is cruel
there can be no question; the mere fact
that they are kept conﬁned and under com
ditions such as described. and which force
upon them a life directly contrary to the
natural one, constitutes cruelty, and if they
could speak a. human language they would,
no doubt, be able to present a. bill of per-
ticulars along with their complaint.

Their case, as described above, is not
that of the canary bird, though there are
many persons who hold that strict-l y speek-',
ing it is cruelty to the bird" to keep it in a. l
cage, because if left in freedom it will Spend
the greater part of its time in ﬂying, and l
certainly its wings are provided for the pur-
pose.

But the canary has been bred in captivity
for thousands of generations, it is not
much. of n ilycr in a. state of nature, and it
receives such attention in other respects as
partly compensate for its deprivation of
liberty. being provided with pleasant sur-
roundings, light and air, plenty of agreeable
food. and often allowed the freedom of a
whole room ”

The question whether it is cruel to keep
it in e. cage has nothiiiig, however, to do
with the (fluestion raised by the ction of l
the slim-Cruelty Society in the case of the l
lizards, and we may expect to see the letter
decided on its merits. i

HOULD theyork that
is now fairly. under
way progressas favor«
ably as isfexpected by
the American Seciety
for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals,
the days of the va-
grant dog andv the
. nights of the homeless
§ cat in Brooklyn :are surely numbered. The
l traditional bootjack and the bottle, which
l were wont who brought into requisition to
l disimrse feline concerts on back yard fences
and onksheds, will soon be at a discount, and
werthless dogs will be but a memory.
,i The police census of the dogsin the City
" of Churches, which was Completed in July
last, under the provisions of the Ray law,
’ whic gave the American Society for the."
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals controlof
l. the dogs and cats, showed that there were
? 26,300 dogs within the limits of that city. But
the approximate number of cats that roam
hrough the highways and byways or nestle
at the domestic hearthstone no man can
tell. 5
As a result of the recent census circulars
have been sent by mail from the society to
every dog owner inﬁlérooklyn. The law under
which the society is proceeding provides that;
“every persbn who owns or harbors one or

more dogs shall procure a yearly license and
pay $2 for each dog.” The owner is required
to state in writing the name, sex, breed, age,
color and markings of the dog. Licenses are

 

 

to date from May 1. For each yearly renewal-

$1 is the license fee required. This is less."
than the old rate charged by the Common
. Council ordinances, which was $2.10 yearly
for each dog.

Dogs so licensed must wear a collar with a
metal tag attached furnished by the society
and bearing the number of the license. Dogs
not so licensed are seized by the oﬁ‘icers of
the society and are taken to the “Shelter for
Animals,” an enclosed structure, at .Nos-
trand avenue and Malbone street, whilfh is
ﬁtted up smilar to the place provide; for
like purposes by the society in New york.
.There they are fed on meat, oatmeal and
dog bread for forty-eight hours.-

. SECURE YOUR PET FOR $3.

Though each particular cat may run its
nine‘lives out wthout its owner being called
upon to obtain a license fee for it, the law
declares “that any cat found Within the cor-
porate limits of the city without a collar
about .its neck bearing the name and res;-
dence of the. owner stamped thereon may be
seized and diSposed of in a like manner as
prescribed for dogs.” It will also cost the
owner of the captured “Puss” or"? “Tom,” as
the case may be, $3 to redeem- such cat, and
the redemption thereof must take plaCe'
within forty-eight hours after seizure. “:Any
person who owns or harbors a dog without
complying with the provisions of this act”
shall upon conviction before any magistrate
be ﬁned a sum not exceeding $10, or he or
she may, in default of payment, be impris—
oned for ten days. To interi‘ere with an ofﬁ-
cer of the society wh 1e in the performance
of his duty is a misdemeanor. ' ,

President John P. Haines, of the S. P. C. A”
offers a reward of $25 for the conviction of
any person found stealing a dog bearing a
license tag of the society. The Superinten-
dent of the soc'ety, Frank 0. Clark, who‘has
been in charge of the Brooklyn branch since
its establishment in 1874. told me when I saw
1him at his ofﬁce, No. 13 VVilloughby street.
yesterday that a very promising response
had been made by the citizens to whom the
circulars had been sent, and that he bel‘eved
that the law would be very generally com—
plied with.

 

MANY TOLD UNTRUTHS. .

“In my jud ,ment there are thirty thousand
dogs in Brooklyn, though the police census
does not show the presence of more than.
26,300,.” said Superintendent Clark. “It is a.
.Iquestion whether persons gave correct an~
swers. Bersons who owned three or four
dogs said that they had only one, while those
:whohad one dog may have said that they
had no dog at all. So far no house searches
have been made to verify the presence of
any dogs, or their absence. Thelaw under
,‘which this society is acting is stringent. The
‘Tﬂld City dog license ordinances were declared
“by Judge Gaynor, of the Supreme Court to
gibe unconstitutional because the city charter

:An Act of Mercy to :1 Lame Horse 1
I Leaves Him in :1. Curious .
3 Position. 1

Supt. Clark, of the Society for thc'I
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, is
searching for the owner of the racing‘
stallion Eclipse, which is said, to be
worth many thousands of dollars, andl
is at present in the possession of Pat-1
rick McCanna, a livery stable keeper!
on Flatbush avenue, near Caton. Thel
Lhorse has been in a. box-stall at the sta-
ble for the last ten days while Mr. Mc-
Canna and a veterinary surgeon have
been doing their best to relieve this home -
ness.

Ten days ago the horse was being led
along Flatbush avenue by a colored
jockey, who gaVe his name as Charles
Lewis and his home as in Virginia.
The {horse was very lame, so lame that

he had to occasionally hop on three
legs. HenryE. Duncan, of No. 91 Lemon
road, who 1s_the organist of a Fifth
avenue, New York, church, noticed the
horse and stopped the jockey with a
threat of- arrest if he continued to walk
the horse. Mr. McCanna offered a box—
stall for the use of the horse until the ‘-
Soc1ety for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals “could be notiﬁed, and the
hoVIigIsIe heaped into it.

The State Board of Health has stepped in
to do the work neglected by the local board,
and has undertaken to locate the butcher
shops to which this diseased meat has been
consigned.

officer of the Society for the Prevention of

Cruelty to Animals. made a visit a‘day or two
ago to the slaughter-houses on Jonnson ave-
nue, and round carcasses that Were entirely

’ihe society had received information that
some of the diseased cattle at John Redferns
place at Canal-sic, which had been raided by
Dr. McLean, had round their way to ‘the
Johnson avenue slaughter-houses. When
Dr. McLean and Ofﬁcer be hyse got to the
slaughter-houses they found no trace of the
lie-chem cattle alive, but the carcasses around
were in a highly diseased condition, some oi
them undergoing the process of putrefnctron.

The men in charge claimed that the meat
was net or the carcasses of the Redtcrn cat-
tic. Ii that be true. Dr. McLean says, there
must he more sources than one irom which
such meat is received. 'l‘o expOSe meat of
this character for sale as an article or human

Board or health should look closely after

Ion May 11 OWlng to the expose “111011 the

5 World made of the place, was arraigned 139'
ffCre Justice Matthews yesterday. Kellie?“
iwas charged with feeding swill to cattle. for
keepingdiseased cattle in the place and on
several other counts. Decayed garbage,
emitting all manner of foul odors it has
said, surrounded the sheds.

F. 0. Clark and Alonzo F. Glover. State
inspectors, were called as Witnesses by the
State Board of Health’s counsel, George 1“-
Elliott. They were followed by Dr. lilacklm
McLean, of. this city;.l)r. S. K. Johnson, of
New York; Prof. J. W. Gansten, Alonzo b‘.
Evans and George Lambert, agents for the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, and Charles I]. Hankinson. All
testiﬁed to the 10111 condition of the sheds
the feeding of swill to the cattle and the
diseased State of many-of the cows.

It was shown that ltedfern‘s meu collected
garbage and swill from many or the hotels
in this city, and that the meat or the cattle
was detrimental to public health.

When the dcieuse opened a startling state
of aﬁalrs was disclosed. The opinion pre-

vailed that the reason for Itedi‘ern’s inde-
pendence and scorn at interlerence was ex- 1
plained.

The counsel for Redfern appeared in we
person or haidwin F. Strauss, counsel for the 1
board of Health of Breakiyn. Dr. 1,. \.

jumped to his feet at this question out ch-

nate his client the defendant was relieved
mom answering.

So the iarce went on. Whenever Redteru
was driven to bay he was relieved by the 0b-
jection or interjection of his counsel~Coun-
sci tor the Board or Health or this city.

After Rediern had testiﬁed it was evident
that the teatimony of prosecution and de-
fense could never be made to agree, it they
called witnesses all day.

City Inspeccor Molter, who is supposed to
examine the meat that comes into this city,
was on hand to testify for the defense, as
were others, but they were not called upon.

L FLAMES Tim BERGH SOCIETY.

Fibell Accuses Its Ofﬁcer of Refusing to
Remove a Wounded Cur.

De Lara Fibell, of No. 50 i'lcrgcn Street.
”complained to the police yesterday that
. on Monday he saw a bulldog attack a
, stray dog on Court street, near Bergen
street. Fibell rescued the dog and took
it to his office. He sent for a Bergh
society ofﬁcer and asked him to kill the
animal. ~,g-T‘he ofﬁcer could not take the
dog from Fibell’s ofﬁce, and Flbell oh-
3.; jected to its being shot there.

Inspector Clark, of theisociety, said:
“I. sent an ofﬁcer to Mr. Fibell's place.
He objected to the animal being killed
in his ofﬁce. We have no means of con-
veying sick animals to our ofﬁce. if Mr.

Fibell will bring the dog here we will
take care of it.”

FOR PURE MILK AND MEAT. ‘

The report concerning the condition of
cattle, Stables and other things on the 11th-
fern farm in Flatlands near Canarsie, giWIl
in these columns yesterday, conﬁrms what
has been said on different occasions about

the danger to the people of 11115
City from diseased meat . and dis—
casod milk supplied from cowstahlcs

in its vicinity. it. is also conﬁrmatory Of
the statements made on this vel‘ysult.l0“l
by the Grand Jury, attention to which W115-
culled by This (irrizrx the other day: and it
shows that our trust in the vigilance and
lirmness of llealth Department of
Brooklyn was not misplaced.

It is altogether a l'lltlltt’l‘ of great import-
lelt‘t} to the public: for cows fed on brew-
ery swill so that they are in a continuous

the

state of intoxication cannot yield
healthy milk or healthy meat. and the
average . citizen takes both as
sound on the statennuit of ill”
butcher and grocer he deals

with. On the facts presented there can be
no doubt that a. very large proportion of the
deaths of children, particularly in the sum-
mer time, are due to the unwholesonie milk
they are served with; and especially because
the milk is generally given them uncooked.
The cooking process, if thorough, is cer—
tain to kill the disease germs in any sort of
food. and hence meat- that. is llllWilOlQSOIllt‘
in quality may often be eaten without dele—
terious effects; but the milk taken raw into
the stomach of childhood is free to work
destruction as it will; and the description
of. the raided farm in question makes the
danger clear. ,
This is, in fact. one of the things referred
to by THE 011.1er in its commendatory com—
ments on the work of the Grand Jury. and
it is gratifying to know that the suggestions

1 of that body have so soon been aviwl on

, have

and with such good et‘fec .

This is far better than the work of some
Grand Juries which have allowed the
pUWH'S of their otlice to be turin-d to
the account of St.‘£llltltlilll()llj.:i‘X'S and
repudiated politicians ‘

DB. M’LEAN FOUND AN UGLY STATE OF AFFAIRS

M,“

He Went .at the Instance of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Which
Wanted to Investigate a. Rumor That John
lietlfcrn’s Condemned Cattle Wore Being.
Butcher-ed and Sold There—Although None
of the Canal-sic Herd Could Be Identiﬁed,
Muck Bad Meat Was Discovered, and, as Will
Be Seen by the Reports Eerewith Submitted
for Public Inspection, Brooklyn Housewives
Need to Exercise Great Care in the Selection
of Their Meats.

 

i A startling menace to public health has been
exposed by‘ the visit of Dr. L. McLean of
l Brooklyn, veterinary surgeon and an oiﬁcer 0t
jtho Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Ani-
i male, to the Johnson avenue slaughter houses
l last Saturday. The visit was the result of in- 7
ltormatlon which reached the society’s ofﬁce
‘that a number of the herd of John Bedfern,
ICanarsie, which was recently examined and
: condemned by Dr. McLean, acting for the soot-

‘ ety, had been shipped to the slaughter houses
1, for butchering)“.
i Upon Dr. McLean’s arrival there the animals
could not be found and it was supposed that;
they had been destroyed. His inepection re-
vealed a deplorable state of affairs in the condlo
tion of some of the meat. examined. Some car-
casses to which his attention was drawn he pro.
, nounced to be totally unﬁt for human con-
! sumption. This meat is circulated among the
i retail butchers of Brooklyn and sold to the
'_ public, who, as a rule, are poor judges or no
; judges at all of, what moat they are buying.
. When visited by a- reportor Dr. McLean ,a’t ,
. first r51;."5ed. to make any statement, but subsom
, queg submitted the following outline of his
‘ vii“; . ‘/ .
if went to the Johnson avenue slaughter
houses with Ofﬁcer DeNice to examine some of,
John Bedfern‘s cattle which had been sent there
to be slaughtered. We could tlnd no trace of:
the animals alive, but in one of the slaughter
houses my attention was attracted by some car-‘
cusses which the men were engaged in stowin’g'»
away in the lee boxes. It was, without excep-
tion. the worst meat I had ever seen. It was
ﬂabby; you could have taken a piece and
twisted it up into a ball, and the fat. was of an
unhealthy yellow color. No rigor mortis . had
developed in the muscular tissue, which fact,
in itself, indicated a diseased condition; more-
over, the putrefactive process had well ad-
vanced. 1 could see none of the vicera. .0!
these animals, but I have no doubt that it
would have been found to be in a. diseased
; condition. They claimed that this meal: was
not of the carcassespof the Redfern herd. If
that be the case it only goes to show that there
are more sources than one for supplying such
meat. Superintendent Clark of the society’s
Brooklyn office and myself went to the ofﬁce of
the Brooklyn board of health at 1 o'clock Satur-
day afternoon to tender our services for a. rein-
spection of said carcasses and prepared to dem-
onstrate to any of the medical staff that‘nly
description of the condition of affairs was com-t
~ paratively mild in character, but we found the
premises closed and could get no response to
our call.” ' '

ized to be given out for publication by the 8001'
oty. The ﬁrst one refers to his visit to the form

CANARsm, L. 1., May 1'l.—«Tno trial of the cutie .
of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals against Joseph Beyner came off in'
Justice Matthews’s court at Canhrsio Village
this afternoon. It went against the defendant.
hen the 3d of May ofﬁcers from the society
descended on the premises of John Redfern, 9.‘
cattle raiser at Canarsie, and removed eighty-
elght steers. halls, and cows which were suﬁ‘er-
ing from disease and ill treatment. It was,

 

 

 

‘f Bedfern'e custom to buy scrawny, weak cattle
‘ from the Western marker. and put them in his
; barn, where he fed them on swill. '

He obtained
the swiil from the hotels of this city and Brook-
lyn and boiled it down to a proper consistency.
The olhoors of the Society tor the Prevention

- of Cruelty to Animals say that this food brought

on disease and irnade the meat, which was after-
Ward sold in NeW~York and Brooklyn, impure

‘ and unwhelesome.

Vhen they seized the cattle last week they
also placed under arrest John Rellfern and two
of his employee, Joseph iteyner and John
Rudinsky. A. strong ei’l'ort was made today in
the came at Reyner to get a conviction, so as to
inﬁi‘ienee the other cases. The charge alleged
misuenieanor, punishable by a ﬁne or $50 or im-
prisonment for sir. months or both. Beyner, it
was said, had been apprehended in the act of
feeding the swlll to the cattle.

The hall was crowded to-day 'wit-hlawyers,
Witnesses, and villagers. All the seats were
taken, and all the windowsills, too. For the ;
society appeared Lawyer George 1.151110%, and l

for the prisoner Lawyer Frederick Costner.

It was some time before ajury. was chosen.
Most of the villagers had formed opinions on
g the case. and these opinions had been empha-

sized in; the territic odors from lledfern’s burn.

At last six good men and true, with William

rortineyor as lorcman, were chosen, and the

trial outrun. ‘l‘he conversation quieted down to

have the seals broken. Being; residents of .‘

READERS ABoilT fr.

Have you ever visited an inﬁrmary for Sid:
and invalid horses? There is an inﬁrmury of
nus kind down on lustre“, .11an the come“
of York, and a. standard Union reporter “th
went there the other'day learned a great deal
more than he ever knew before about the
methods used in treating dumb beaStS that
are suffering from 8101016335 and disease. D1"
Daniel s. Brasilia".,the Wen'known Wterimry
surgeon, courteously showed the “390”” over
the establishment, and explained how horses
are taken care of, the remedies that are used,
and the peculiar affections that the equine
race is heir to, in an interesting and instruc-
tive m’anner. ' '

Suppose, then, that your favorite EON—‘0'
through long and enforced traveling, has be-
come road-weary; he is not attended [0, and
develops a lameness of so alarming a charac-
ter that something must he done instantly to
save more serious consequences. Your groom,
who should have had the wit to discern that
something was wrong and to at least make
an examinatiOn of the animal’s feet, is or-
dered to take him around to 111 J my street in

is a, grave dang-er, however.

PHENOMENAL ACHIEVEMENTS.
1 tell you Bergh was a great man.
Judged from the heights on which we stand

and View the past, his achievements were phc- 3

nomcual.
As a unique personality in the history of
New York State, Bergh stood alone.

He can be compared, he can be contrasted ,

with no one.

Peter Cooper was unique and peculiar, but
in such a. line of personality and of outwerking
as makes comparison possible, because other
men,ytake Horace B. Claﬂin, for instance, and
others Whose names will occur to thinkers,
outworked their individual developments along
alinc common to that on which Mr. Cooper
was also signiﬁcant.

But Bergh was different.

I knew they say that Bcrzh secured for his
society, which was virtually nothing but him-
self, a legacy of $100,000. They claim that he
had a large and well appointed mansion at the
corner of Fourth avenue and Twenty-second
street, chieﬂy for his own personal comfort,
and that he secured from this, that and the

ON A TELEGREEFMLE.

 

That IS “’here a Cat Perched “5911‘

Yesterday.

All amusing comedy was enacted shortly be-
fore 11 o’clock yesterday in the vicinity 0f
Quincy street and Reid avenue. A distressed
looking out Was discovered perched
uDon the top of a telegraph P016
Opposite No. 716 Quincy street, “Ila
an assorted crowd of people from the ubiquit—
ous small boy to the patriarchal old gentleman
Cul‘iously watching it from the sidewalk belOW«

HOW the animal managed to raise so quiCkly
in the world no one of the gatherings seemed to

'know, with the exception of an aqueous—eyed '

.A youth. who said the animal had been chased up
, dere by a dorg. This appeared to be a satisfac-
tory solution oi the problem to the surround-
lng spectators.

A discussion then followed as to the most
available means of rescuing the poor beast, any

' number of impractical theories being
advanced by the solicitous onlookers.
All old-fashioned suggestions, however,

were scouted by the large army of smell boys,
who straightway proceeded to coax him down

With a shower of missiles in the shape of stones, 3

sticks, and specimens of tired fruit. .
These oﬂerings apparently had no apprecr-
able effect upon the suspended Thomas, who
still held the fort against all inducements to
come down.
Another council of war Was then held by the
older heads, some of Who suggested shooting

It is quite noticeable that since the llcens-l
ing of dogs, has been transferred to the So-
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to Ami-I
mals the police department has lost interest.
in hunting up unlicensed dogs. Last year
quite a stir was caused by the unusual ac—
tivity of the members of the police force 'lll
reporting owners of these pets. This acts:—
ity provoked a ﬂood of letters to the license
department from owners wno refused point
blank to recognize the ordinance ordering the
tax and from those reported harboring a
dog and not in possession of the same. This
is the inactivity of the department in this;
direction is quite as glaring as the persistcncy 5
last year. I am acquainted with a large num— 1
her of people who are owners cf dogs and as l
yet have not in any any been notiﬁed to pro- E
cure a license. It is hinted in some quarters

that the meaning of this is that a certain por-

Mrs. Mary Anderson, of No. 105 Ash-
ford street, which is in the residential
section of the Twenty-sixth \Vard, does
‘, not take kindly to stray cats. Onegreat
' ﬁg black feline in particular has made
Mrs. Anderson’s life almost miserable.
She made severalattempts to rid her-é
self of it. but all to no avail. This wasl
-_-.n.°. ordinary cat. Hardknocks about thel
ﬁverld and frequent contact with boot-l
_‘jacks had taught him more than his
[potted brothers and sisters will learn‘ in
:a. lifetime, and when his enemy, lifrs.
Anderson, ﬁlled some nice choice meat
and fis'h with poison, he did not gobble’
it down likc‘other cats would have done, i
but ate it cautiously and managed to,
3 get away with everything but the}
igge‘adly drug. The latter, it now trail—l
'spires, was eaten by a pet dog and catl
‘owned'by Mrs. Nellie Berry, Mrs. An-l

‘ 1 _thrs. Anderson is said to be a very
,mice woman, much liked by the people
.j‘the set in which she moves. To an

declared herself free from all blame for
_ "the death of Mrs Berry’s pets, and
i ygave her VCI‘SIO‘n of her designs on “Mr

A little palace for lost dogs‘and wan-
!dering cats will soon be erected in this
loity by the Society for the Prevention
lof Cruelty to Animals. It will take the
. place of that melancholy rendezvous
. for missing Trays, the city pound, and

will be known as a “shelter.” The site
for it has not yet been selected, but it
may be said that it will not be built in
Clinton avenue or on the Heights.

The shelter will have a separate ken-
nel of an almost luxurious character
for every dog and a metal cage with a
wire front for each cat. It will also
have a well—equipped kitchen, with a
,chef in charge to cook meals for the
’animals. A dog doctor will always be
'on call when his professional services
are desired. The dogs and cats will ride
to the shelter, with considerable dis-
play, in three red ambulances, equal in
point of comfort to those of the hospi-
tals. All the animals will be attended
by polite ofﬁcers of the S. P. C. A. in
brown uniforms.

The new dog law abolishes the form
fof piracy known as dog-catching, and
,‘sweeps the city pound out of existence.
The statute is ofﬁcially entitled “An Act
}for the better protection of lost and
strayed animals, and for securing the
rights of the owners thereof.” It places
all lost dogs and errant cats under the
protection of the Society for the Pre-
vention of Cruelty to Animals, which,
at its own expense, will gather them in
from the streets and maintain a. “shel-
ter" for them. In return for these ser—
vices the society is empowered to issue
all dog licenses, and to employ the fees
in defraying" the running expenses of
the dog and cat home.

The police are actively engaged in
taking a census of the dogs ci‘ Brooklyn.
and they expect to have it complvlml in
about a week or ten days. Last yrur
there were 28,600 dogs in the city. This
is about one dog to every thirty—live in-
habitants. or every seven families. It is
believed that the dogs will show a murv
or less gratifying increase in lllllllln‘l‘
this year. In addition to the respectable
dog element of the city there an: about
3,000 tramp dogs in Brooklyn that new-r
have had any owners. They lead (i no-
madic existence in the streets put of thn
year, and in winter they often ;:0 to lllt‘
woods and hunt rabbits and birds.

Since May 1 2.600 dog licenses
been issued by the S. 1’. (I. A. to llmok7

pound. and he regarded every dog as u

are paid salaries, and have no interest
in takingr a dog that wears a collar'a‘nd

formed and will be held strictly account-

it would b9 abused; but horses whose owners
are too 9001' to pay for treatment are attended
to at Dr. JOhUSOD’s place, and also on two days
of the week at the hospital connectedmthﬁthc

half of man’s best friend.

The 30(31th for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals has a prOicc-t on foot for the estab<
lishment of a home for abandoned animals of all
kinds. Horses that are turned into the streets
t0 die WOUld be cared for. or. if they were oe-
yond cure, they would be put out of their
misery in the most merciful manner. Stray
cats and dogs would also be sheltered, and. if
necessary, the dog pound could also be incor-
pOl‘ated with the home and its objectionable
features done awa with. The society proposes
’60 build the home from private subscriptions
entirelv- and no appropriation will be asked

opposite the headquarters of the society, at

2‘2d street and Feurth avenue. There are two

horse ambulances, one ambulance for dogs.

wagon. All these are well housed, and quar—

ters ar; provided for a dozen horses on the

ground. ﬂoor. Upstairs are kennels for dogs

captured at dog ﬁghts or found injured in the

street and smaller cages for cats.

The ambulances go out in charge of a. driver
and an ofﬁcer of the society, both in uniform.
The patrol wagon is a sort of traveling drug
store. It carries appliances, medicines and
surgical instruments ready for‘immediate use.
Its province is that of ﬁrst aid to the injured.
An incident that happened recently will illus-
trate its usefulness. A truck horse was taken
with what is commonly called "blind stag-
gers.” An old Irishman who was passing said
he knew what; to do, and pulling out a blunt .
knife was about to bleed the animal. Just at :
.- this moment the patrol wag-Ion drove up. The l
‘ ofﬁcers prevented the suffering brute from i
" being stabbed. and taking a sponge saturated
with ammonia held it to the horse’s nostrils. 2

poses to hunt live animals. We shall lam-sq-
gate the matter at once and ta '9 steps to
prevent it carrying,r out its plans.

-- it is one of the chiet objects or LDC soci-

FISHING FOR A CAT.

ﬁlm ‘v‘i'ouldn’t Bite, .‘30 They “'eut to the 1
lottom to Catch Her. _ l

 

The, Society for the Preventibn of Cru-
elty to Animals yesterday, after labor of
two days, rescued a cat from the bot-
tom of a chimney, three stories high,
of the building No. 289 Fulton street,
occupied by Miletus Frank, manufac-

:-

‘ Alli

A boy was the ﬁrst to hear the mew-
ing of the cat. On Wednesday theso—
ciety was notiﬁed. The chimney has
been unused for years. Its dimensions
are “153:? 1-2. inches. The cat must have
fallen down while listening to the strains
of an ardent wooer on the'higher roof of
an adjoining building. Oti‘icer Grace
ﬁshed all day 'VVednesday for the cat,
lowering a basket with the hope that
she would jump in on the new-fashioned
elevator and take. a ride up to sunlight
and freedom. But she didn’t.

Cl’l’icer De Nyse then tried to coax , till
her with food, but she didn’t bite nor - 0%
tumble to the racket as easily as she
had fallen down the chimney. So he
lowered a can of water and. some meat
and left her. Yesterday ()ﬂicers Glover
and Seaman tried a. new scheme and,
against the pr0:.es‘;s of Mr. Frank, Whom
they threatenedwith arrest if he inter— eq
,felEd, they made a hole at the base of
the (flllllll’ley and released the cat. Her
ribs looked like a scrubbing—board when
she. staggered. and rested against the
wall to preserve her balance.

At the present moment she is ﬁlling

an owner, and Mr. Frank is con. 'dering
the advisability of covering the ch mney,
as the expense of repalrmg it must be
paid by him and not by the society. 09*

knockers, the door knobs and the windq: .-
and the houses all shine With , m

in the city desert, a place of green ‘ g
bright ﬂowers and spreading trees. In the" ‘
ter it still preserves its air or". neatness.’ w7 ..
such a block, in fact, as would have Suit "
David Copperﬁeld‘s Aunt Betsy Trottvo'odfadi“7
residence, a place Where the mere presence: '
donkey boys would have seemed a proi’anatid ~
and have caused her to ﬂy out other house and?
box their ears. ' ' 7 “-
There are no donkey boys in Brooklyn 1b it
there are ash cart men, and on Friday morning
last ash cart men came through the portioning
Sbuth Oxford street described with a loadéﬁl
wagon and got it stuck in the snow and main:
front of 1170 South Oxford street, where Mrs;
Thomas ll“. Goodrich lives. As to what has
penal afterward, there are diverse accounts?
All that is certain is that Mrs. Goodrich ran out,

oi’ the house and had a controversy with.,,th§l '

ash autumn and threatened them with arrest ..
and that Oiﬁcer Kelly of the Tenth precinct poi}?
lice reinsed to make an a ‘l‘8§'l§.
Mrs. Goodrich’s story was printed in t '.
EAGLE last evening. She accuses the driver'”:;
the cart that had become wedged of crueltyito’li
his horses and says: "For one and a. half honfs‘i
the wreteh threw bottles at the heads of the3
horses, beat and jerked them most cruelly and-'75
after throwing them oil their feet, kicked’il
the prostrate animals until the neighborhoédf
protested. Roundsman No. 140 at last passéliiil
by, but refused to arrest the driver, even in ‘tliefi
name of. the society i'er the Prevention of Cruz:
city to Animals, of which I am a member, be- ‘
cause he did not see the deed. The ashmeiili
laughed and said we could not arrest them. I?
Eheasoelcty ol' no use? What are policemen}
or ‘ i"? 1
Mr. F. 0. Clarke, inspector in charge of t ”ed?
Brooklyn branch of the Society for the Prevehiés
tion of Cruelty to Animals, said that Mrs. Good-i“
rich called on him yesterday afternoon. “She";
is a member of this society,” continued the in; ii
specter. “She could not identify the ashriietllll’j
now. , She could have done so then because 1911511
had her eye on the man and pointed him out“?
the policeman who refused to make the arrest-.1
The man in question is not a roundsman. as!
stated in the letter to the EAGLE. He is a pain,
trolman, and I suppose a new man on the
force. The heads of the police department are?Tl
all right, but the subordinates, especially,"_ . it)“
new men, are opt to shirk their duties in oasedfi
of this kind. (they don’t know the law, or they;

troduced by the S. P. C. A. of This

The Brooklyn Society for the Prevention of

Cruelty to Animals got in new Bmothcrino'

boxes yesterday afternoon. These are the ﬁrs:

smothering boxes introduced in this city, and

 

 

wholesale exodus of cats if the back—fence song'-
sters only realized their danger. .

One of the boxes will be used to put stray
canines out of pain. The idea of these new
contrivnnces is to administer death with I'm
utmost dispatch, and, incidentally, to nuke it
as pleasant for the dumb victim as possible.

.The- cat box is about eighteen inches lone.
nine inches in width and a foot high. The
case for dogs is more than three times as large.
In the side of the boxes is a pane of glass to 911- I
able the humane executioner to perceive when
life has departed from the doomed animal.

After the animal is put into the box a pint or
so of chlorolorm is poured into a tube that has
. a periornted 'unnel at the bottom which ill"-

fuses the vapor throughout the box, which is
air tight. The animal lasts about fodr seconds
atter its ﬁrst inhalation.
It has been the custom of the Brooklvn
society to send small animals to the‘h‘ew York
l socrety to be disposed of, but during the past
l season the number has been so great that this
, was round impracticable. , 7

, Contractor Slavin’s Stables Under
Government Investigation.

 

”a.

Second Assistant Postmaster General Bell
Found That Decided Evils Existed and
Ordered an immediate Change of Methods.
Complaint Lodged With the Health Board.

 

In consequence of continued complaintsre-
gardmg the condition of the horses employed
on the wagon mail service in this city Second.
Assistant Postmaster General J. Lowery Bell
has ordered an immediate change on the part
of the contractor, H. O. Slcvins, 01' Kansay City,
who has charge of the carrying of mails be-
tween the stations and the general ofﬁce.

Early this morning, acting under the advice
of Superintendent Hankinson of the American
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Ani-
mats, Inspector Frank Clark of the society, of
this city, in company with Veterinary Surgeon
McLean made a. visit to the contmctor’ssta- ,
bias in Flood’s alley, between Washington
and Adams streets, near the post ofﬁce.
They found thirty horses stubled there, all
of which showed the effect of improper
core. The stable is a three story and basement
structure in bad repair. The horses are stabled
5n the basement and on the second ﬂoor. The
second story was ﬁrst visited. Hero were four-
teen horses, all of which were so thin that their
ribs plainly showed. Seven of them were in
very bad shape. In the basement a. worse con-
dition of affairs was discovered. In a room
20 by 25 feet in size were stubled fifteen horses.
Most of them were gnawing at the boards. In
response to a query as to why they were not
supplied with hay, Stableman Guerke said:

“We can’t afford to teed them all of the

time."

Acting under Dr. McLean’s advice, Inspector
Clark ordered the stubleman to detain ﬁve of 1
the horses. The inspector at once lodged a. ‘
complaint against the stable with the health de-
partment. Two of the mail wagon horses have
died within the last month.

This afternoon, Inspector Clark notiﬁed the
formuan of Contractor Slavins’ stables, that ,
they must remove the horses from the basement
immediately or some responsible person will be

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arrested.

The amendment to the State code permitting
the coursing of hares by greyhounds. intro-
duced by Assemblyman Shields . 1n the
Assembly a short time ago will be vxzorously
opposed by the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals. It Is the intention of the
President of the society, Mr. John P. ﬂames.
to appear before the Codes Committee. to
which. the amendment has been referred,
and ask that it be permitted to die the speedy
death it so justly deserves. The-present laws
of the State strictly prohibit the cruel and
rather unmanly pastime of coursmg, whereby
inoﬁensive animals are torn limb from limb
by dogs. The society will also petition the
individual members of both the senate and
and Assembly to assist it in defeating the pro-
posed amendment.

A HORSES TONGUE CUT OFF. 5

...... 2

And :1 Flntbush Commissioner “'ns Only
Fined Five Dollars.

Henry Balsaur. a Highway Commissioner i
of Flat-bush, was ﬁned $5 for mainlinzl
a horse by being an accessory to pulling off 2
about three inches of his tongue. llalsaur
lives at the corner of Grant and Lots streets,
Flatlmsll, and is credited with having eon-
siderable political pull. Several weeks ago
he came in possession of a handsome bloods-l
horse. The animal was a very balky one,
but nevertheless Balsaur started to drive him
Monday, and accordingly hitched him to a
buggy. The horse refuse". to move an'l
ﬁnally broke one of the shafts. lialsaur
became enraged. and, prcmu'lng a heavier
harnesshitched the horse to a (hrt cart, but
the animal still refused to more.

Just then a farmer‘s wagon came also:

‘ and Balsaur tied the l0w<_~r {.21 w of his lwrso
to the rear oi the farmer's: wagon with a
piece oi rope. V'l‘he farmer’s horse: \Vcl‘u
lashed up, but Balsaur’s horse sat bacl; on 1
his haunches. lie was dressed a good (115- 1
tance, and ﬁnally about three lllClzCR of the
horses tongue was cut 0111‘ am} full to the

M The Cat Question. .
, l If The" general roomer (not to be con-
" I' ‘ , I 1rinsed with general rumor), will probably
I I§r§ympat~hize with Dr. Virgil F. Parker (he
spells his name in the English old way,
'I‘iant, the Roman Old‘ way), who was ﬁned
{jéQOTiL’for the. luxury of shooting cats,
gimme of them, who had'by their nightly

invited the very catastrophe that over-
I took them. The doctor, as. a cure for in~
I somnia, gave the cats several pills, which
I were'administered hypodermically, with
.I . an air-gun. The cats now sleep well, and
1- I, - so does the doctor. In fact, it was the
« .I doctor who was troubled-"with insomnia,
If - I - and not the cats. They were wide awake.

, The cats were owned by a wealthy
I I butcher, and were said to be choice ones,
. , and he objected' to the doctor’s operating
nil-3 on them. . I
'4 Of course it was risky for the physio?
ian to shoot, but cat concerts are exas-
perating, and there are'tho'se, who do
not own cats, that hold that those who
do should work the eight hourllaw on
them, and have them shut dOwn after

V

dark, and, if they are choice breeds, keep
them indoors by night and leke by day.
Twenty dollars for three cats seems a

privilege which the proud
has not. He can be his
catcher. This is the chance afforded
to him by the Society for the Pre-
,vention of Cruelty to Animals, which
has the legal right to catch dogs but
“ does no catching.

SO if there‘is any old dog which is
annoying your slumbers by midnight
howlings,“and has no license, swoon
down upon him and take him around
to" the’lsoOiety’s headquarters in VVil—'
lOughbyStre’et, and he‘vnll be pain-
ilesslv put to death. '
The last Legislature

taking away from the city the riglit
catch dogs and drown them in tl:--
sriver. The power was vested in tltm
society. - That is the reason you (10 not,
see wagons ‘ with grated tops germ;
about the city, with two or more tough-
IOOkirfg‘ men ready to pounce dow."
upon your pet.
"The society has the right to license)
the dogs at $3 a head. The IllOll'xf
goes into the coffers of the society and
is used for its own benefit. Of coursu
everybody knows that the society is
doing a good work and the money is
not begrudged.

Everybody likes a good dog, and it
troubles lots 03 good citizens to See
some noble brute being" carted about in
a rough wagon without a shelter and
suffering from the heat.— But that, it
is'claimed, is no reason why one mall
should pay $2 for the freedOm 01' his
dog and his neighbor pay nothing.

The man who has paid his tax can,
however, get even with his neighbor.
Just corral his dog and take it to
the society’s headquarters. The animals
are kept there forty-eight hours {till
then put to death. The dogs, if they
are small animals, are put in a,
narrow box and Ichloroformed. 'l‘lv'I-V
die without a struggle. The larr‘c dogs
are taken to the New York shelta' r sin-l
are put in a large gas tank, where they
are slowly asphyxiated. The death is: :i.
-pa.1nless one and the men who do tlju
killing are aria; Illf'l in Cl'lt‘~.~'l‘l.‘l.’.ill'~‘-
principles of the thing. The dog, ll(!\\::
ever, can‘be‘ redeemed by the O‘Nlll‘l' it
not too late. Good dogs are kept and .1.
. home is secured for them. .

It is the intention of the socretyIto
. build a shelter in Brooklyn exactly like
theIone in _New York. it Will be fully
: equippec With the latest dog-killing au—
Ipliances. 'SO far the society has line-ll
,unablc to .get grounds upon which 1.»
build the shelter. Once or twmw a lo—
cality has been settled upon, but thy
people 111 the vicinity have set up Slll'l:

. doned. , . , .

Just now .PrcsidentIJohn P. Hainm:
is looking about the City for a suitable
spot. He has about determined upon :I
place, butis, not yet ready to malco the
proposed location of the shelter known.
He is fearful lest some property owner

object and he be unable to get the
land. gVVhy people shoulucbject to hav-

One Hundred Canines Captured in
Flatbush by Agents of the S. P. C. A.

The special agents of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty (to Animals made :1
mad yesterday on the dogs of Flatbush.
Under a recent law the destruction of un-
licensed dogs is vested 'in the society, and
ﬁve ambulances and ﬁfteen Of the sovcictv’s
officers have within the past week been
detailed to the work of catching stray dogs.

About one hundred and ﬁfty unlicensed

dogs were captured yesterday in the Flat—
hrush territory alone. They will be held
f-o-rtyaenght hours and then asphyxiated at
the new shelter of the society, at‘the corner
of Malbonie street and Nostrand avenue.
I‘he treatment in handling dogs under the
new law. is in great contrast With that under
the Old system, when the Mayor appointed
Idog catchers. Here-tofore the ,dogs have
. eenlasosooed, beaten and welted and ﬁnally
pitched '111l‘:0- a wagon by the tail. ‘

.____......._..

1 Glander's and farcy have developed to an
”alarming extent among the horses of this
city. Attention was called a few weeks ago
in the HERALD to the fact. In an interview
had at that time with L. McLean, a well
known veterinary surgeon, he declared that
the disease was more prevalent than ever 1
before. He said it had spread over a larger
area and affected more centres than. at any 1

if. RAGING IN SOUTH BROOKLYN.

called the attention of Health Commissioner

Emery to the matter, but that his depart-
ment seemed to be doing nothing to sup-
press the disease.

“There is one stable of twelve horses in
this city,” said Dr. McLean. “Five of them
have been condemned for glanders with—
in the last two months. Still the Board
of Health has not isolated or quarantined
any of the animals, nor have the premises
been in any way cleansed or disinfected.
These facts speak for themselves.” The
Health Board at that time denied that ther

was any epidemic of glanders in the city.

Dr. McLean’s statements seem to have
been borne out by an alarming development
of the disease in South Brooklyn. Horse
owners in that part of the city are dismayed,
and they are unable to stamp it out. The
chief sufferer so far is E. H. Itjen, a whole—
sale coal dealer at Union street and Gowanus
canal. Glanders in his stable was ﬁrst dis—
covered last Saturday. Since then nine
horses have been destroyed, and eight others,
suspected of being infected, are quarantined.
There were twenty-three horses in the stable
where the disease was discovered last Satur-

.y. .

Unly one of them seemed to be afﬂicted
and it was killed that day.‘ On Monday it be—
came necessary to destroy three more. The
following day the disease was noticed. in
ﬁve more animals, and they were shot. All
but four or ﬁve of the other horses have,
been isolated and are being watched. The
average value of the animals that were killed
was $250. .
Dvn TO rvnmc TROUGHS.

I saw Mr. Itjen last night at his home, No.
2-3 St. Felix street. He said he believed‘that
his horses had contracted the disease by
drinking from public watering troughs that
had previously been used by glandered ani—
mals. ‘Dr. Ackerman, the veterinary surgeon
attached to the Health Department, Mr. It—
jen said, had told him‘ that the disease had
. spread all over the city and that they were
having a hard time in trying to stamp it out.

Superintendent Clark, of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, admitted
1 that there were many cases of glanders and
Marcy in the city at present. He said the
chief cause of the epidemic was the public
. watering troughs, where one glandered horse
‘ otti1uld spread the disease to hundreds of
.0 ers. -

Refusal of the Health Commissioner to
Make Any Statement About
1 1 the Disease.

'—

HUMAN LIFE IS ENDANGERED.

Z. Taylor Emery, Health Commissioner, r’e-
fusedto be interviewed yesterday regarding
the outbreak of glanders among horses in
this city, which was described exclusively in
the HERALD yesterday. I was told by a clerk
in the Health Department, however, that the
Commissioner »was preparing a statement
which Would be given out for publication to-

day. ,

The HERALD’S story telling of one stable of
twenty—three horses in which nine had had
to be killed since last Saturday, while eight
others were suffering from suspicious symp-
toms and werequarantined, caused consid—
erable comment among veterinary surgeons.
When I saw Lachlan McLean, of Nevins

street, he said :— .

“In my last interview with you I made
speciﬁc charges against the Health Depart—
ment of this city, namely, that it was doing

, little or nothing to stamp out or suppress
glanders. and that the disease was assum-
ing an epigoptic character. The Health Com—
missionerﬁnet these charges by saying that I
wanted advertising, and that I was a crank.
Now I will not follow his ungentlemanly ex—
ample.

ANOTHER DANGER.

“Subsequent events have proved my asser-
tion, and ‘it is a very serious matter for
horse. owners in the city. Moreover, the
men who attend these affected‘animals are
in great danger of contracting the disease.
It is only a few months ago that a man who
'had contracted the disease by attending a
horse died. There is no cure for this dis—
ease. The killing of nine horses in one sta—
ble suffering from fully developed cases. as
told in. the HERALD, shows at once the im-
perfect inspection practised by the Depart—
1ment of Healt...

“For all animals destroyed on account of
this disease the State allows a maximum sum
of $50; I have had several so affected killed
during the last month, and the State prompt-
ly paid that sum for each animal.”

1 OTHERS QUARANTINED.

It was not found necessary yesterday to
kill any of the eight horses that are quaran—
1tined at the stables of E. H. Itjen, a coal
1merchant at. Union street and Gowanus
Canal. The six animals that were thought
not to be affected, however, began to show
‘symptoms of the disease, and were at once
isolated. .

Ambulance and Strikes the flﬁicer.
James Cosgrove, a saléon keeper of Fourth
avenue andTwenty-eighth street and Third
avenue and Twenty—seventh street, was ar—
raigned. in the Adams Street Police Court
yesterday charged with assaulting John
Stover, of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals. . .
Stover on November '20, with Mr. Zedler, of

the society, was driving the dog ambulance
in Third avenue, When they e‘spied a bull
terrier trotting along without a collar. The
men captured the animal. and were placing
it in the ambulance when Cosgrove ap—
peared.

“Let go that dog!” shouted the saloon
keeper, catching Stover by the collar.

".11“ you are the owner of the dog and can
prove it to Superintendent Clarke,” replied
Stover, quietly, “you can get him again by
calling at the office.”

This angered Cosgrove, who struck Stover
a violent blow in the face, at the same time
calling fer help on a crowd of sympathiz-
ers.

Suddenly CosgrOve took out a knife, cut
the. cord and, with the dog, made his way
through the crowd.

The hearing will take place next Monday.

TUlEvSDlAY EVENING, l)l3:l:‘l‘:1}wl.l3liR,

Glanders and Public Troughs.
There is :1. good deal of talk about
glanders in Brooklyn. \l'heiher the ”11"»—
?‘asc is seriously prevalent. or not i1 is

well to take premfmtions against it, since

veterinarians have found no sure our.»

appear. or.
signs of spreadinc', the health authorili :s
in conjunction with the city works M1111-
missioner. should turn the water oil? from
every trough in the city and thorougldy
disinfect them. \Vatering troughs on:
seldom cleaned. They are at best dan—
gerous conveniences and in times like the
present they are doubly so.

 

THE PREVALENCE OF GLANDERS

NOT SUCH AS TO BE REGARDED WITH

ALARM.
To the Editor of the lrlrol)kl.vn Eagle:

Apropos of the article published in the Herald, 1

Friday morning, November '39, regarding gland—
ers, permit me to remark that the veterinarian
who is trying: to induce the public to believe that
there is an epillwnllc raging in the city of Brook—
lyn is either looking for professional publicity or
has been‘asleep for the past twelve years. It is
a well known fact that glanders is epidemic in
the United States, the same as in all temperate
climates. If this epidemic shouter has not been
asleep or without practice he would certainly
know there are always cases cropping up here and
there, through the city, at all times, and in all
seasons of the year, more especially in stables
wherelarge. numbers of horses are kept. The
main reason that the public hears of glandemi
more frequently now than previously is that the
state pays a, nominal sum to the owner of a dis-
eased animal for his loss. Consequentlv cases
that were previously not reported are how all
reported. Certainly there is no necessity for a
scare as glanders is no more prevalent now than it
has been in the last ten years. I might justlv

asay here, from experiences as a Veterinarian
”nacticmg in South Brooklyn for the past twelve
Years, that the board of,heal‘th in the citv of.

Brooklyn for the past two years has been handled

 

in a very judicious manner, as far as the veterin< ‘
any department thereof is concerned. In every ‘

case that I have reported there has been prompt
action and all necessary precautions taken 1;“
sarding the isolation of suspected subjects and
the disinfection of the premises and apphrt‘en-
ances of the stable. The correspondent states
that the attention of the board of health was

called to the saiddisease, but that it seemed to
be doing nothing. In the latter part of the.

article, however, he clearly contradicts himself by
alluding to the very marked and prompt atten—
tion given by the board of health to the stable
of a. certain coal dealer. In conclusion I beg to
say to .the epidemic bowler that if he were as
prompt in diagnozing his cases of 'glanders, and

likewise reporting the same to the board on"

health, as he is ready to, look for free advertise.
ment, he: would thereby do credit to himself and
t0 the profession of which he is a member,

It should have a. dispensary for animals and a.

All these are needed in New York, and an institu~
tiou of this kind would not be complete unless it
included them besides the public dog pound.

If the home was established they would ﬁnd it
more than a. convenience. The animal could be
{sent there and the owner be certcin it would be
kindly treated, well fed. exercised and returned in
good health. This would be a. source of income to
the society, as e. couple of dollars a week could be
charged per head and the expenses would not
reach half that sum.

Many peepic owning dogs give up their houses or
close them for a month or Six weeks prior to their
departure to Europe or to the country and put. up
at a hotel in the city. Here their dogs cannot be
housed and. the home would be of use, particularly
if it was placed within reach by being on the
island.

The advantage of this is obvious; to all, end can-
not help being: appreciated. At present there is no
place in this city to board cats and dogs, and it is
the difﬁculty of (licensing of them for the summer
months that prevents many from keeping dogs.

Redfern. a coal dealer, whose place is on Neck"?
road, was put on trial before Justice Matthews iii
the latter’e corrt room, in Morrison’s hull. Thai
trial was set down for 2 o’clock. but long before ,
that time the place was crowded. In one. corner
of the court room an interprising individual had.
put a small. bar, where ginger pop and peanuté}
were sold during the trial. ‘

The charge against. Redfcrn was that he failed:
to provide sufﬁcient and wholesome food for, li'isig‘
covwl, and that he had fed them on hotel garb_a.ge,f§{_
which was boiled in vats in a. roomndjoining the?
stable. The story of the raid on the place was-‘
told in Friday’s EAGLE. George F. Elliott, the .
counsel for the sdcieiy for the prevention of};
cruelty to animals, appeared for the pi'osecution,l;:
while Major E. D. Benedict looked after Red.»
fei'n’s interests. The ﬁrst business was the se-—-
lectiou of a. jury. Six. men were ﬁnally chosen, ,
every one of when). belonged to the Methodist '
church and the Canursie gun club. Redfern is a. .
member of both. '.

The first witness called was Ofﬁcer William Deg“
Nyee, of the society for the prevention of cruelty :
to al'iif‘l‘ifilS. He tectiﬁed to ﬁnding sixty culvesiil
in the piece. lie new garbage in the troughs from ':
which the animals ate their food, but found 110?:
hay in the place. His evidence was corroborated
by Inspector Clark and Ofﬁcers Drew and Noble.

Veterinary Surgeon McLean said that the gar:-
huge on which the calves were fed was entirely;
i unﬁt for 1‘5“ The moat would not be ﬁt to eat}?

and any expert in a. slaughter house could pick iii;

out by the smell. ' -

1 In his own belizilf Redforn said that there was

‘3 plenty of hay about the place. He had pits full .
of it. Heﬁfcd thdcalvee on hay, feed and gar-j
bage. '; V ‘ "

John W. Rumph testiﬁed that he saw the calves

‘ in Redforn’e place on December. 22, and that.

j they were what. he would term in good condition.

, Counselor Elliott objected to the testimony of

l the. witnesc, as he was not an expert. .
“But this man is 60 years old and knows all.
‘ about cattle." interposed Counselor Benedict.

“He may be 60 years and might be a. hall fool
or the brightest man in the village,” said Mr.
Elliott. “I know of a. man who stood at a. billiard
table all his life, but still he could never playa
game.”

“I suppose that was you,” said Benedict.

“You guessed it that time,” was the retort.

The witness then continued that he had seen
Redfcrn feed bay to his cattle in the morning
and at noon.

Robert Hawkehurst saw plenty of hay on Red-
feru’s premises, but on cross examination be ad-'
mitted that it was salt. hay. _

John Huwkshuret had seen Redfern feed his‘
cattle hay and “sixty” feed. He had sold Redfern
$50 worth of hay himself. a. .

"What is ‘rixty‘ feed ‘I” the witness was asked.

“Well. it’s half way between ﬂour and meal.”
was the reply.

, On cross examination Hawksliurat admitted
that. the hey he sold Redfern was salt hay.

William Dickson testiﬁed to seeing 10% Of hay
about the place.

”YOU are pretty friendly with Bedfern?" asked
Mr. Elliott.

“No, I am not friendly,” was the rephr-

“Then v u are an enemy of his?”

“No, I am not," answered the witness. ,

”You generally go and sit on his front stoop, I
suppose?” -

”NO. I don't,” was the reply: “I go into the
house.” [Laughter] i
Surgeon McLean, recalled. acid that salt he?

was not ﬁt to eat.

“Well, what is your objection to meadow grass?’
asked Major Benedict.

“It is unwliolesome.” answered the doctor.

A Heiiernlxlaugh followed this rank. as almost
everybody in Canarsie feeds his cattle on salt ,
hey.

”Don’t you think that the salt would give the
hey a ﬂavor?”

“I can‘t say": I never ate any.” (Laughter)
InsoectorGiark and his ofﬁcers were recalled
and all were positive that they had seen no he! g

about the place.

Major Benedict then addressed the iur)‘ and in
the course of his remarks characterized the so-
ciety for the prevention of cruelty to animals 33
a. lot of old women. “They are all well enough in

7.. , o ORE DOGS MUZZLED IN NEW
w YORK.
’ New York city has at last reached the
* common sense conclusion that nothing is
gained, but rather something is lost, by the
ﬁnuzzling of dogs during the hot weather,
and the practice will be abandoned at once.
This conclusion has been arrived at through
the efforts of the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals, which thinks that
dogs [should receive that consideration
which their nature demands.
' _, The Society in question, with the ap-
proval of the local authorities, secured the
enactment of a bill by the last Legislature,
which the Corporation Counsel reports su-
persedes and repeals all previous acts in
”relation to dogs in the city, and “takes
away the power of the Common Council to
; enact ordinances relative to the taxmg and
R destroying of dogs Within said city.”
7 The act provides that all dogs shall be
incensed, and those that are not shall be
seized, and, if not redeemed within forty-
eight hours, may be detroyed or otherwise
disposedvol. By section 8 the Societyls
empowered to carry out the provisions of
the act, to collect the fees prescribed and to l
usethe same in del‘raying the cost of the
work and maintaining a shelter for lost,
strayed or homeless animals.

. ’l‘his supersedure of the Common Council
ordinances on the subject carries with it
the abolition of the regulation requiring all
dogs to be muzzled in the hot season, and
the Society will not revive it,bccause it has
ascertained from long and patient observa-
tion that if a muzzle is not made to ﬁt so
tightly as to keep a dog’s mouth closed ab.
solutely, he can bite; and if. the muzzle

 

l

 

does ﬁt. tightly, it injures the dog’s health,
and is a species of relincd cruelty which
ought not to be iniiicted on any animal.

tion of the society, in commenting on this.

hydrophobic. If that dread were well founded
no measures to insure the eal'etv of man and, .
beast from so horrible a. disease could be too
stringent: but experience has shown that this
dread is practically Without foundation. In the
elty of London. where a similiar ordinance was
for a long time in force, it' has been
repealed on the ground that the apprehended
danger was not real; and in the city of New
lork, during the last twenty-live years. not one

, single case of hydrophobia has appeared. In
the presence of such facts as these, the public

If the muzzle were necessary it would be
right to use it, even at the cost of inconveni-
ence and suffering to dogs; but since it is not
necessary, the use of the muzzle in most- cases
:15 a superfluous and gratuitous cruelty. is
we have said in a former article the muzzle
is useless unless it keeps the dog’s mouth
close shut; but if it does that it

'Ho Harbored Horses in the City Infected
i with a. Contagious Disease.

Justice Walsh handed down a decision
yesterday in the case of Dietrichl
Jtens...-hberg, of No. 538 Hamilton ave~,
hue, who was charged in the Adams
Street Court a few days ago with allow-.
ing a horse suffering from farcy to
main among other horses. Reuschberg
was ﬁned $250, which he paid. He was

arrested on June 21 last by Ofﬁcer A“

F. Glover, of the Society for the Prev
'vention of Cruelty to Animals. ,

Two days previous to that date the‘
officer found Reusehberg’s horse in the:
ﬁeld at Forty-ninth street and Eighth,
avenue. The animal had a well-de—
veloped case of farcy, which. is very
_m,uch likeglanders and is conta‘ious.
There were a number of other animals
in the same ﬁeld. Ofﬁcer Glover shot,
the diseased horse, arrested the owner!
and compelled him to send the other-
horses to a farm in Rockland County, ,
where two of them have since died.
Justice ”Walsh heard the case a few:
days ago, but reserved his decision.

The ofﬁcers of theVSociety for the Pre-
ventl-onwof Cruelty to Animals are much
afraid, that the disease has been com-
munlca‘ted to horses in otheraparts of.
the city by the animals, which were
driven about before being taken to
Rockland Count-y.~

The rooms of the Society for the? 1' 3'
vention of Cruelty to Animals in the Wil-
loug’hby Building shite their existence.
have been the scene of many a 5‘9“”
of cruelty not often known by
people in the ordinary walks of life.
Many are the maimed and crippled ani-
'mals brought there, living accusations
to, brutality. The, walls are adorned
'With weapons used upon the lower ani-
.mals by their interiors—cruel and en-
raged drivers and owners. , ,

On every side may be seen imple-
ments. of torture equal in pain-inﬂict-
ing qualities to any relics of the In-
quisition. Huge cudgels, knives, hatchets
and even crowbars are stacked in the
.lféo'rners or arranged upon the W3135~ A“
V'have'been used with cruel effect. On
{the mantel-place is a wagon-rung.
lséveral feet long and six inches Wide.
JOn it is an inscription that tells how,
{on March 5, while driving a team of
themes to Coney Island, Thomas F.
.Boland beat a horse’ over the head until
it dropped to the ground. A hatchet
Lbears silent testimony against the
foruelty of F. n. Giumurrar. of . N0.
'964 Third avenue, who on July 18. 1391,
cut off his horse’s tail.
The brutality of John Skinner will
never be forgotten. for in a prominent
position on the east wall hangs a heavy
iron poker, bent deuble by being brought;
down with fearful force upon a horse’s
back. A sharp-pointed knife bears a
label which describes how on Jan. 15,
1890, John Gilnour cut out a dog’s eyes.
The occurrences of one day, as wit—
nessed by a. World reporter, show
graphically the varied incidents that
occupy the time of Supt. Clark and his
assistants. Some of the incidents are
pathetic. Others. are curious or laugh-
able. All are interesting, and show

either enlightened man’s love and care
for dumb animals, or afford striking il~
lustrations of low brutality. A timid
rap was heard upon the ofﬁce door.
“That,” said Supt. Clark, who by.
long experience has become able to
form an idea of a person’s character
and appearance by the manner of rap-
ping upon the door, “is probably a little
girl with a wounded pet.
“Come in.” he said.

were playing on the corner near our
hOuse with a. pet white rat. On the
corner was a. fruit stand owned by Peter
Arcolae. The rat escaped from the
children, and ran up the stand, across:
the piles of fruit, where Arcolae caught
it. ‘With a dozen expletives, he held the
rat by the tail, poured kerosene 011 over

threw the lifeless and still ﬂaming body
to the street.”

Accustomed as Supt. Clark is to such
cases, he shuddered involuntarily several
times during the recital. Making sev—
eral notes, he assured the young man
shat the case would meet prompt at-
tention, and retained the rat’s body as
testimony.

As the minutes rolled by and no more
callers appeared, Supt. Clark related
several examples of cruelty that had
come under his notice. ‘

‘fLast summer,” said he, “Henry
Balsaur, .ighway Commissioner of

F‘lat‘oush, came in possession of a hand—
some blooded horse. The animal was
balky, but nevertheless Balsaur started
out on a drive with him, but on the
road the animal stopped and refused
to move. laisaur became enraged and
lashed it with a. heavy whip. Still the
animal refused to move. Just then a
farmer’s wagon came along, and Bal—
saur tied the lower jaw of his horse to
the rear of the wagon. The farmer

it, and, lighting the Struggling creature,
held it as long as possible, and then!

 

lashed his horses. and Balsaur’s horse,
although he Si’llt back on his haunches.‘
was dragged along the road. W'hen he
reached home he found that severe-J
inches of the animal’s tongue had
been cut off, and upon removing the
rope the severed tongue fell to the.
ground. Several witnesses informed U.“
and we were prepared to take action
Balsaur went immediately to the police
station and gave himself up. He was
ﬁned $5 and we. couldn’t reach him, as
you can’t arrest a man twice for the
same offense.
“That is an example of cruelty.
tell you the storyof a man who gave
such free rein to the control of his
animal instincts that he placed himsell
upon a level with brutes. In September.
l889, Henrich Malz, while working in a
Phird avenue barn, discovered three kit—
tens. He declared his intention of
drowning one, when a companion re-
marked that he hadn’t the requisite
nerve. Malz answered that he woulci
as soon kill an animal as eat, and
would prove it. A wager to the. extent
of a pint of beer was made. The beer
was procured. Malz picked up the kit-
ten, placed its head between his teeth
and bit off the head. The other kittens:
were served the same way. Then.
throwing the bleeding heads into the
beer, he drank it before the eyes of his
horriﬁed and disgusted companion. That
man was ﬁned heavily. and the public-
lty given to the affair by the newspa—i
hers ruined him. .
“I’ll tell you anotl‘ler”~——. ‘
;Luckily for the listening reporter a
knock was “heard, and in answer to 3

bleeding and fearfully mangled bulldoap

morning on complaint of Mart-in Doscher, a
grocer at the corner of Fenimore street and
Nostrand avenue, who claims Wiggins tortured

 

it i'or life.

The dog in question is owned by Dcscher, and
is still alive with a swclen log. A few days ago
the dog was being led along the street by
Doschen's son, with a chain. Wiggins’ little son
patted hilh on the head and the dog bit him. In
the evening Wiggins hunted for the dog, and
ﬁnding h1m on Doscher’s premises shot him in
one of his paws and then said he was even. Then
W'ggins tried to have Just-ice Steers order the dog

no appearance when the case was called, and
Wiggins has reluctantly discharged by the
Court.

Wiggins now says he will sue Doscher for

BOG TAX AND DOG CATCHER.

 

Between dog taxing and dog catching the
local authorities are subjected to a. gloat
deal of worriment this summer. A great
many dog owners, as appears from the
basketfuls of communications to thellnyor,
refuse to pay the tax because their dogs are
not protected from the dog catchers. This
does not mean that the tax is objected to by

‘ sensible people as unconstitutional. but
that it is the most emphatic and effective
way of protesting against the (log catcher.
If the latter caught only dogs that were
unlicensed, therenvould be no complaint
against him; but “everything is ﬁsh that

 

 

comes to his net,” as the sayii a; is. and it .
makes no difference to him whether the
dog has the license tag on his collar,
Whether he has a muzzle on, indeed, or own
whether he is at large on the street, sunning
himself in the front yard, or playing with
the children in the hall; all that t'liccatchcr
,wants to know is whether the coast is clear

 

l
l will pounce upon any animal he is not afraid
1 of, even if he has to pull it from the arms of
f the woman or child who is trying to pro-
, tool: it.

‘ This has taken place so many times that
1 no man who owns a dog leaves it in the
morning with any conﬁdent expectation that
he will see it again when he returns home
in the evening. Dog catching is a brutisli
business, and honorable dealing is not to be
looked for in those who engage in it, and there
is nothing surprising in the fact that they
ﬁndit more proﬁtable to steal the household
pets, with a view to their redemption at $3
ahead, than to pick up stiay curs at 50
cents apiece for the pound. The letters to
1 the Mayor show that this old game is' being
‘ played again this year, and it is a. reproach
to the city. " .

It and every other reasonable source of
complaint would, however, be done awav
with if the matter were treated with the
common sense displayed in the hand—

; ling of most questions as simple

. as this. We have passed tlirouwh
the Worst of the heated term—ahd

it was the worst we have seen in many a.

F year—and not a dog has gone mad between
the East River and 00119)’ 1813M. 1110"”11
the muzzle was enough to drive those thbat
wore it in such weather crazy.

This fact sustains the statement made at
the beginning of the season that hydro-
phobia~a very rare disease—~43 not caused

, by the heat, and there is, therefore no
3 sense in maintaining the old.time prerClices
as expressed in the old-time ordinances on
t the subject. If a. dog were really mad
Ethe. muzzle would not prevent him from
, bltlng, and the muzzle should be done
, away with as a relic of the ignorant past.
The annual tax should be imposed rigidly

How the Misery of Animals

.czeity's ofﬁcers and were not removed, while

Ieig'hteen horses died after the society had 7_

gbeen notiﬁed.
iiwhen he sees signs of fatigue or weakness
ybout his horse," said Superintendent Clark,
{its to get the horse in the shade just as soon
figsapossible. Then let him' pour ice water, 01‘
. iéwater as cool as he can get it, over the head
1’ the. animal. Keep it quiet and in the

as To DOGS.

“There are no mad dogs in Brooklyn,” said
Mr. Clark. “There are a great many, how—
ever, sick with ﬁts and the staggers, caused
by the heat, to which they are very sensi-
c'tive. Dogs should be kept Well supplied with
fresh, cool water, and when they are. ill the
owners should be careful to guard them
from excitement and keep them in a cool,
i secluded place.

“Cats, it may appear, will survive any-
ithing and anywhere, and yet, as they are
Efriendly. domestic animals, they ought to
'be cared for kindly,” continued the Super-
jintendent. “The cat is better off than the
,dog in the matter of ability toﬁnd a shel-
* ter. If the cat does not feel comfortable in
.her own yard she can 'scale the fence and
‘ soon ﬁnd a cool spot in some adjacent place.
Comparatively few dead cats have been
found lately.
‘ Drums 1:: THE SHADE. ‘

“Birds should be always kept in the shade
during the summer,” said Mr. Clark. "There
is a great deal of ignorance, I ﬁnd. about this
mar tcr. Our ofﬁcers in some of the best
neighborhoods in the city frequently ﬁnd
the birds in cages hanging in the glaring
sun’s rays, fairly baking with the heat, to
'Which they are thoughtlessly exposed under
the wrong impression that it is good for the
bird. In such cases the officers go into the
house and ask that the bird, which. is apt to
fall from its perch in a ﬁt. may be put. in a
oool,_shady place. In the winter days. when
the sun is not warm, sunlight is a good thing
for birds, but the summer sun may prove
fatal. Many birds have died during this
as“?! spell” -. . .

TREATMENT or HORSES.
, This torrid weather has been more fatal to
Li‘horses than anything that has come within
the knowledge of the BrooklynSociety for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals since
the epidemic of cpizootic in 1872. Superintend-
ent Clark. of that society, told me last evcn~
ing that in all his twenty-three years of of...
ﬁcial experience he had never known any-
thing to equal the suffering among the
Echors'es.

District Attorney Foster L. Backus of
this city, appeared for the people this morn-
ing in the Grant Street Police Court before

Justice Steers. He was called to tell what
he knew about a dog ﬁght that took place

. last Friday night on the veranda of his next
‘ door neighbor, Mrs. Clara M. Langford, I\o.
, 19 Lincoln road.

Mr. Backus was asleep When the ﬁght he-
gan. He had been carefully Put to MC]
about. 10 o’clock, and was suddenly awak-
ened by the snapping and snarling of a cou—
ple of degs directly under his window on the
next door veranda. When he heard the
screams of women for help he jumped out
of bed. He did not. even step to pull on his
trousers, but rushed out into the darkness
to the rescue. He certainly looked pictures-
que with his slender legs stretched below a

rufﬂed and embroidered night shirt.

\Vhen he reached the veranda. of Mrs.

,Lsang'ford there were three women sitting on

rustic chairs crying and screaming. A pet
Gordon setter which had been presented to
Mrs. Langford by the District Attorney was
at, the merCy of a ferocious bull terrier.
owned by a well-known sporting character,
Hargreave Tattarsall, of No. 435 Malbone
street.

The bull terrier had taken several prizes
for ﬁghting in New Jersey. 'His owner
was at the foot of the steep sicking the dogs
on each other and applauding the flow of
blood. The steep and veranda were liter-
ally covered with blood when Mr. Backus
appeared on the scene.

Mr. Backus called upon Tattarsall to call
off his dog. Tattarsall told Mr. Backus to
mind his own business. Mr. Backus grah~
bed the bull terrier and pried Open his
mouth and released the setter, which fell
to the floor from sheer exhaustion.

Mr. Backus excused himself to. the wom-
en on the veranda for his picturesque ap-
pearance. Then he devoted himself to
Tattarsall. He wanted to arrest him. He
walked in his bare feet to Prospect Park,
where he met a policeman, and the bull ter-
rier and the owner were taken into custody.

This morning Mr. Tatarsallwas repre-
sented by Luke D. Stapleton, while Mr.
Backus appeared for the people."

The ﬁrst. witness called was Miss Eliza:
.beth B. Langford, of No. 19 Lincoln road.
and a pretty daughter of the complainant,
Mrs. tiara M. Langford. Her description
of the ﬁght was graphic. -

“What does your‘family consist of?” asked
the District Attorney. ' ':

“Mymother, three brothers. two sisters, a
dog, a 'cat and a kitten,” laughed the pretty
witness. Then she added, covering her face
with a jeweled hand, “Mr. Backus was in
his bare, feet when he came on the veranda '
to stop the ﬁght.” ‘

“What. was the condition of the veranda
after the ﬁght?"

“It was covered with clotted blood and
black hair. My dog is black and the bull
terrier is white. My dog was badly cut
about the mouth; his face was swollen and
he was very lame. Mr. Tat-tersall Wanted to
thrash Mr. Backus.”

Mrs. Langford testiﬁed to the ﬁght, and
that Tattarsall when called upon to stop
it, said that the Gordon setter would either
kill the bull terrier or the bull terrier would
kill the pet setter.

“Mr. Backus and I have naturally talked
over this matter on account of what the
neWSpapers said,” remarked Mrs. Lang—
ford, “and wasn’t it funny no two newspa-
pers had the same story. I thought that
Mr. Tattarsall was going to take .it out of
Mr. Backus after the ﬁght.”

“Pity that he didn’t.” laughed Lawyer
_ Stapleton. >

“He couldn’t,” was the retort of the Dis-
trict Attorney. -

Alice Langford. another pretty daughter
of Mrs. Langford, testiﬁed that when she
got a cane for Mr. Backus to pry open the
mouth of the bull terrier, that had closed on
the setter’s neck, Tattarsall wanted to ﬁght
Mr. Backus.

Mr. Hargreave Tattarsall testiﬁed that
he lived at No. 435 Malbone street, and was
a. member of the Manhattan Cricket Club,
He couldn’t, have separated the two degs
without running the risk of getting bitten
and, that might have been darkerous to his
life. The Gordon setter and a bulldog be-
longing to, Mr. Chase, of Lincoln road, start-
ed an attack on his terrier in the middle of
the road, and the ﬁghtwas continued on
the veranda of Mrs. Langford’s house.

. “Itold' Mr. Backus,” the witness con-
tinued, “that he could not hurt my d08,.and
Backus said, ‘You deserve a thrashing,’ and
I said, ‘pr you try"it, I will show you that,
you cannot do it.’ ,

“WheaMr'Backusﬂcame after me, I told;

Aritoney to have certain horsesdestroyed. The

The case of Samuel Ackelman, of 105 Debe—

. ‘ date.-

. After all of the cases had been disposed of,
lawyersfor the defendants began to scour
about for bondsmen for their clients.

The police are still working on the case,
and may make more arrests. Detectives Pin-
der and Kelly triedfto get a woman living in
the Sixteenth Ward to give information re-
gardingthe'poisoning of one of her horses,
but she refused to give any names. “I know
the man," she said, “who poisoned my horse,
but I am afraid to give you his name. If I
did, he would kill my new horse and would
also poison my husband."

The Hebrews in the Sixteenth Ward are
much al-armed‘over the numerous cases of
poisoning, and have «become so frightened
they have engaged men to watch their
stables at night. In many cases it is. known
men put muzzles over the mouths of their
beasts at night, so that they cannot take
anything offered them. ‘

While the cases, were being'heard, one of
the friends of the prisoners bored 8. hole in a
panel of a. door leading to the .prisoners’ pen.

BY 8. P. C. A». TREASURER.

“-.....

Practical Test to Be Made at
Local Abattoir.

w ‘b‘_— -—.....——-—.

Practical experiments which were
completely successful were. held yes-
terday in the ambulance house, of the
American Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals, 111 East Twenty-
second street, Manhattan, to test the
efficiency of a new pneumatic device
for the humane slaughtering of food
animals recently invented by Henry
Esrgh, treasurer and vex-president of
the A. S. P. C. A

This pneumatic instrument, designed:
for use in abattoirs, is very much,
like a ﬁreman’s hose and nozzle in out =
ward appearance, and is controlled by"

the operator in precisely the same
manner. Instead of a stream of water,
however, on the pressure of a trigger
it hurls a javelin with such force as to
pierce a one—inch oak plank, and by an
automatic recoil attachment this jave-
lin is instantly brought back for use
again by merely pulling the trigger. In -
yesterday’s experiments boards and
cadavers were used, and although the
“instrument employed was intended only"
for slaughtering small animals, its
power proved ample for the largest.
Mr. Bergh has been at work on this
invention for several years, and he
claims for it the following advantages:
Rapidity of ﬁre, for the javelin can
be discharged at the rate of ﬁfty times;
per minute; accuracy in striking at the ‘
desired point; economy of operation,
the cost being merely nominal, and
efficiency in producing instant insensi-
l ity.

Since animals must be slaughtered l

for food, it seems desirable they should;
be killed with the least possible sufferw
ing, and the A. S. P. C. A. has been in
correspondence with similar organiza-
tions throughout the world for many
months with a View of arriving at
some improvement on the methods now
employed. It has even offered a re—
l‘i’m‘tv‘l Of $500 for the best machine for
slaughtering, and instituted a competi~
tion in which a jury of experts is eX-
pected to make an award next month.
Mr. Bergh’s invention is not, of
course, in Competition, for as an offl-
cer of the society he feels that it would
be indelicate for him to accept pecu—
niary reward from it, or to participate?
in any way in such a contest.

It might be added, however, that Mr.
Bergh has devoted much thought to
just such problems. It was at his
suggestion that the present method of
asphyxiating homeless or disabled dogs
and cats was introduced here and else—
where. The practice in the old days,
when the pounds were controlled by‘
the municipal authorities, had been to
place these small animals in an iron :1
cage, which was then lowered into the
river by means of a pulley, gradually
drowning the unfortunate animals,
which protested as loudly as their lungs,
would permit.

VVhile' president of the A. S. P. C.
A. (which was founded by his uncle),
Mr. Bergh wrote the city authorities
on several occasions, asking that some-
more humane method of destroying
“strays” be adopted, only to be re~
buffed. Finally, Mr. Hewitt became"
Mayor, and Mr. Bergh then intimated
that the municipal authorities had no
more right to disregard. the laws of
the State of New York than any in-
dividual. Mayor Hewitt at once took
the matter up with the A. S. P. C. A.,
and as a result, the lethal chamber in—
vented by Mr. Bergh was proposed, 1
adopted, and its use continued. when
the care of “strays” was turned over
tolthe society. . .

Mr. Bergh calls his latest invention
an “air gun,” and, in fact, an.a1r gun
it is. But the resemblance lS much
more striking in the larger apparatus
meant to be used in slaughtering steers,
for here the cylinder containing the
javelin is mounted on a swivel, like the
ordinary types of rapid—ﬁre. guns. The
operator in using the gun stands about
six feet away from the animal to be
killed, the muzzle of the gun pereC§S
within about three feet of the animals
head, and the point of the Javelin Wm,-
as proved by experiment, penetrate into
the brain with unerring accuracy anr

1'OfAcepractical test will be made this

week at one of the Manhattan slaugh-
tering houses. ﬂ 7 7

’lhc 01111111 1171 this tender hearted little

111111.711: at his home, Avenue H and Mill
11.11.1111. Since this bereavement Toby has
grieved incessantly. He loved his master
with alinost human intensity, and his'sor-
row is mournful to behold.

The dog c111 neithei eat nor sleep. He"
.vandeis through the house disconsolate,
and whinin,“ in a ma'nnei that touches the‘
hearts of those who try to comfort him.

I “Hard Grease" Tattersall,as he is commonly
known in Flatbush, who gave his address as
435 Malbone street, Flatbush, was held for
trial yesterday afternoon by Justice Steers in
the Grant street police court on. 9. Charge of'
,siei'uely to animals and in default of $300 bail
{Went to jail. The complainant was Mrs.
”Clara Langford of 19 Lincoln. road. District
Attorney Foster L. Backus, who is a neighbor
'of Mrs. Langfo-rd, was also present’in court
ready to prosecute 5n behalf of the people
and also an officer of the Society for the
.Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. -
'nMr Tattersall was, it is said, under the in-
;iﬂuence of liquor on Friday night and was on
this, way home with his ﬁghting bull terrier,
IRex, ‘which, by the way, has earned several
prizes in New Jersey, when he suddenly es—

' .pied a pet Gordon setter resting on the stoop

of Mrs. Langford’s home. Mr. Tattersall, ac—
cording to statements made in court, clapped
his hands together and said to his terrier,
“Sic ’em.” That was enough for the terrier,
for he made .one hop up the stoop and in a
second had the Gordon setter on his back on
the veranda. Mrs. Langfo-rd and two of her
women friends were setting on the veranda.
at the time and they lost entire control of
themselves and screamed for help.

Mr. Backus only lives a few doors from the
home of Mrs. Langford. He had been to,
prayer meeting with his wife and thought it”,
best to retire early when he returned. It was
only 10 o'clock when the dogs got at each
other, but Mr. Backus was in bed“ and enjoy-
iuig his beauty sleep. Between the dogs snap~
ping, snarling and growling, the rest of Mr.
Backus was disturbed and he 1‘ inpcd out of
bed with the screams of women for’help ring~
' ing in his ears. Mr. Backus did not wait to
put on his trousers or slippers, for he ap-
preciated that assistance was demanded a;
once. He was barefooted and an embroidered
“night robe could be seen in the dim light
that fell from his hall chandelier as he
emerged from the vestibule into the darkness
of the street. Mr. Backus ran to the home
of Mrs. Langford. He dashed up the stoop
, apparently forgetful of his appearance and in
a few seconds was-standing in the midSt of
i the fray. Mr. Tattersall was still. at the foot
’ 0f the stoop encouraging his bull terrier. Mr.
Backus declared it was an outrage to torture
the dogs in that manner. "
Mr. 'l‘aattersa-lrl declared that if. the district
attorney attempted to interfere with the'bull
. terrier he, would have to account to his Owner,
who was ready to ﬁght to a finlsw. Mr. Back-
us, who is an athlete of recognized ability,
remarked that he had no time to bother w ith
a light then. Then the district attorney grab-
bed the bull terrier, who had the setter by
{the throalt, and tried to pull him away. The
,‘bull terrier had a ﬁrm hold, however, and the
harder the district attorney tugged on him the
more ﬁrmly ‘he held on. But the district at-
torney would not be outdone, so he finally
pried the bull terrier's jaws open and released
the setter, Which actually fell to the ﬂoor from
exhaustion. The setter was carried into the

“Now I am ready for you,” remark-ed Mr.

Backus, addressing the owner of the bull ter-

an; short time the dogr was captured by an
gainer and locked up in the Litchﬁeld man-

bare feet and night robe, trotted after Mr. Tat-
gtcrsal‘l until near the Willink entrance to

promptly placed Mr. Tattersall under arrest
for disorderly conduct.

“CHICKENS WERE SUFFERING.

Isolomon' Friedmann, a Brownsville

Butcher, Arrested fox-Packing Live
Fowls Into Small Coops.

 

The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals is determined to extend the hu-
mane inﬂuence of its enforcement of the law
for the protection of animals even to the
frequently oppressed and helpless chicken.
In furtherance of this end, Superintendent
Frank Clark, of this society, will appear to-
morrow as a witness against Solomon Fried—

mann, who is the prOprictor of a chicken
slau hter house, in Brownsville.

Fr edmann was arrested on Tuesday morn-
ing last, by an ofﬁcer of the society, at Flat-
bush avenue and Dean street, while driving
a wagon load of chickens over the hot and
dusty road to his slaughter house.

The officer was greatly annoyed by the
spectacle of suffering that the poultry pre-
sented. In eleven small coops he found the
chickens literally packed together like sar—
dines. Their heads protruded through the
openings, and they were gasping for air.
l‘l‘ledmzllln was arrested at once. The
wagon was driven to the Veterinary HOS-
pital of the society, N0. 14 Nevins street.

“1 never saw such a sight in my life.”
said Mr. Clark yesterday. “as I witnessed
when we let these poor half famished chick-
ens out of their packed coops and-put them
in a box stall. \Vater and food was Spread
for them in abundance, and you should have.
seen them jump into the water, drink and
roll all over in it. 1 tell you there is a great
compensation in this work that we are
(icing in relieving such suffering as this.
Just think of it. There were ﬁve hundred
poor chickens stowed in eleven small Coops of
which two hundred and ﬁfty-six were in five
of them. They were cared for at our hospital
until the next day, when Friedmann was re-
quircd to furnish twenty-two coops—just
twice as many as be had before—to remove
them in."

Friedmann

was taken before Justice
Adams Street Police Court.

mitted to bail in the amount of $500 to await
examination on a charge of cruelty to ani-

WHAT THE SOCIETY FOR THE PREVEN—
TION OF CRUELTY TO ANIMALS IS
DOING FOR ABANDONED DOGS
AND OATS THIS SUMMER.

The adopted creed of the Society for the ‘Pre—;

vention of Cruelty to Animals is: “The people must
be trained and educated in the ways of humanity,
as well as punished for acts of cruelty,” and there-
fore in all the new American possessions its inﬂu-
ence is already being felt.

In the Hawaiian Islands Mrs.
Craft has taken the protection of animals
hand, and is

Helen K. Wild or
in

of this one woman is working a reformation no less
signal in those islands than that which has been
accomplished in New~York. That others like
minded will be found in Porto Rico, Cuba and the
Philippines John P. Haines, the president, feels
conﬁdent.

During the last year the society has humanely

destroyed 89,135 animals, both large and small,
which were homeless or disabled past recovery, and
:early sixty thousand cases were investigated.
Not the least important of the work of the so—
ciety during the summer is looking after aban~
{toned cats. The superintendent, Charles H. Hank-

lnson, stated to a reporter for The Tribune in an,

interview yesterday: “After the middle of June
we take in on an average from 250 to 300 eats a
day. Many of these have been brought here by
persons who are about to close up their houses;
others we are requested to call for by persons who
‘will not take the trouble to bring them to us, and
still others are entirely abandoned.
cats for forty-eight hours. to give them a chance
to be reclaimed or adopted.”

“Do you ever keep any for pets?” was asked.

“Very rarely,” Mr. Hankinson replied. “V’Ve have
done so when a particularly ﬁne or intelligent ani~
mal has been brought to us, but we do not keep
them for "long, as some one is sure to beg them
away. ,

“The question arises," he continued, “whether
this large destruction of cats may bring about a
pest of rats, for already in'districts iwhere cats are
scarce rats predominate. and vice versa. It may
becomea matter for serious consideration.”

Mr; Hankinson relates many interesting incidents
which have occurred during his experience of thirty
years as superintendent. He says:

“You would be surprised at the number ofper—
sons who come here. with animals who believe in
the transmigration of souls. To cite an incident:
On one COIQ, sleety day'some years ago a woman
came to us, bringing a miserable, dilapidated kitten
'She carried it rather under protest, and said to
me: ‘I don t like cats and I don’t like dogs, and I
never have had any pets of small animals, but I
came across this kitten a few blocks away
crouchedyin the corner of the sewer opening in the;
gutter. I heard it cry. and I, wentback to. it the
second time. It looked up into my face in such an
an 681mg way, and it brought to my vision my
on y daughter who died about six weeks ago. Then
i! ‘pi‘ggedl itI up and brought it here.

e . suppose you wan‘ us 4' .
said I. L LO destroy it?

"'NO. I dOD’t.’ she answered;

keep it. and it will I am going to

‘ _ be the ﬁrst cat I ever h ‘
mynhfe. And then she left. A few years pigség
by, continued Mr. Hankinson, “when there rwas
some tall; about having cats licensed when one
day a woman came in with a basket of forel

AT T. E BROOKLYN SHELTER.
Wanda, a Scotch deerhound, occupies a prom-

was brought in by two small boys ﬁve years ago, a1

’more dejected specimen of doghood it would have

been hard to ﬁnd. Not handsome at best (except
to his master), unkind treatment and hunger had
But in spite
of his forlorn condition Mr. Hughes, superintendent
of the Shelter, recognized in him points that

testiﬁed to high birth, and Wanda escaped the
death tank to become an honored member of

society. Wanda acts as “watch" by night and day,
and if a wily cat ferrets out the secret of its cage
fastenings and escapes, or any other irregularity
occurs, Wanda reports it at once tO Mr. Hughes.
He was called Wanda because he wandered in, and
also for the reason that most people wonder what
sort of dog he is.

Billie Etcetera, a big gray cat with speaking
eyes and eight toes to each foot, is one of the pre-
siding geniuses of the place. He was given to the
institution by the doctors of one of the hospitals
in Flatbush, because they mistrusted that he was
receiving more regular attention from the nurses
than the patients were. Billie knows ambulance
N0. 8, which brings the beef hearts, and only one
thing ever fools him. That is when the springs of
No. 8 break down and another ambulance is sub-
stituted. Billie is the only cat that has ever stayed
at the Shelter, all others having suspected a lurk-
ing danger to cats.

Brown Bet is a Scotch terrier who devotes him-
self to his master, Mr. Hughes, but has his doubts
about the rest of the world, and, although his fam-
ily tree in red and black ink occupies a large page.
Brown Bet. at the approach of a stranger, cowers
under the furthest corner of the safe like a. very
ordinary dog. “Like some foolish people,” says

- one Of his friends, “he has judged the whole world

by a.few mean persons, and given himself up to
cynimsm.”

Qne thousand six hundred and thirty-six cats and
36:) dogs were released from the burdens of a
vagrant life in the Brooklyn Shelter last month.

“Some of.the animals that are brought here
seem consolous of impending evil,” says Mr.
Hughes. “Some feel it much more than others.
I‘hey are much like the prisoners over here in the
Jenitentlary. Some act sulky, others bold, and
some seem to think it is fun. There are always
me or two in every catch that will yelp and cry
while others w111 sit up in a corner and seem as
regularly ashamed of themselves asif they had
lone somdething wrong.

“A goo many peOple mistake the shelter f
:at and dog hospital, and bring their pets ﬁler:

'ormerly, 1f oneocan judge by the numbers brought
ierez. About thirty or forty women visit us daily
with their cats. Dogs die in the death tank in
tbout four seconds. but cats live about three

During the recent hot spell columns on

by the Society for the i’l't‘VCllllOll of,

horses were saved. ‘1
In a few days almost two hundred calls'
were made for ambulances to remove,

stricken animals to hospitals and

night, for they were in consmnt demand.

The effect oi‘ the heat was not Ski great
among the animals as might hayw bot-n
expected. Supt. Limit, of the society
when asked about the work or l11s
organization «‘iuriroar the last heated spell
said: “People lake cure of their
animals now than heretofore. The pub-
lic is Waking up to the fac: that we are
here to persecute notiody, but to protect
animals that cannot cart- for ihcmselxw-s.
The well-~tO-tlo citizen and business man
cares for his horse because he thinks a
lot of it, and in some cases the animal i.
loved. The lower class of men who drive
horses take «are of their animals b.--
cause it pays. and that is the sum and
substance of it all.

“Early in the summer we sent out
instructions as to how to treat 41 horse

animals have been overcome during in.)

Last year the society removed from the ,I- ‘1';

dogs and 62 ,47,4 cats. .Of these 1, 511 10st dogs ,
‘were restored to their owners. I

When the wagons, which go out every
morningto patrolthe town, return 1n the after—
noon, about half- ~spa t four o "clock, with them
loads of “found,” the dogs and cats brought
in are, examined for marks of identiﬁcationf
separated into pens according-to sex, and
"eachvicious or diseased animal is caged
alone by hims'élf. These lost dogs and cats.
'Vare'kept'at the Shelter for forty-eight hours,’
awaiting pessible identiﬁcation by their oWn-‘
ers, and being fed and the water changed twice.
a day. In summer the animals are fed dog":
biscuits, and in winter a porridge, of corn-
meal, oat-meal, and beef. The execution ap-
paratus consists of a big steel air—tight tank,
charged with illuminating—gas. After the al-
lotted forty—eight hours for identiﬁcation
have expired, all the unclaimed animals are
removed from their kennels and dropped int}1
the tank. . . 1

“It’s all over in a minute,” said the at-
tendant who showed the Evening Post re-
porter through the Shelter. “They just lie
down and go to sleep Without a murmur or
any pain. You wouldn’t know they were be-
ing put to death.”

The usual run of stray cats and dogs
brought by the wagons to the shelter is not
of a very high order of breeding. They are

 

{mostly animals running loose in the streets ff;

out. of the way. J 1'

An aged woman who lives on West Sixty-
fourth Street is a frequent caller at the
shelter in‘One Hundred and Second Street.
She is a cat fancier, and says she always
has been. Every miserable feline she sees
about her house without a home she catches, ' - g
or has caught for her, puts him in a basket, '
and carries him to the shelter. She averages ..
about three trips 21 month through the year, .
and usually has three cats ‘in her basket}? 1
each time. She had just come in to the‘shel- l '
for out of a pouring. rain, carrying her bas— ?'
ket of cats, the afternoon thetreporteere 5
sited the shelter. On her last trip she had --
brought in her basket a stray ‘white cat .
she had found in her cellar,“ but two days” ' .. .:
later she discovered that it was unfortu- ,
nately the lost pet of her neighbor, next
door. She mourned her mistake bitterly.

“For now there’s trouble between us, all
on account of my pains to be good!” she
cried, wiping her eyes. . . I ,

One day, She said, when she was on herl 1

way down One Hundred and Second Street

_ “1..-”, - - w,” _ T”.

she met a little man, leading slowly towards 1’

the shelter a fat pug dog. He had his hand-
kerchief to his eyes, and was crying. .
“I Went up beside him," said she, telling l

the story; “and, touching him on the shoul- ,.

der, said, ‘What’ s the matter?’ .

“ ‘MV' dog, Tony, replied he, ‘he’ s got {to

Obsessed by the passiony of the period,

 

Comptroller Metz at thkeérBoard of Esti-

mate meeting this morning asked 1361‘-
mission to investigate the acounts and
methods of the Society for the Prevention
The request was
ofﬁcially granted by res'olution, and in the
words of Mayor McClellan, the Comptrol-
ler will proceed to “keelhaul the society
from top to bottom.”

The Comptroller’s action was provoked

f oy Health Commissioner Darlington, who
‘Y wanted from the city $15, 000 to pick up
i stray dogs.

The Commissioner stated that the de-
partment had to care for many people
bitten by mad dogs, and declared that
there would be a saving if the city

would grant an appropriation to round
:4

up the beasts

The question was immediately raised
as to why the S. P. C. A. did not do this
work. Compt1ollerl Metz assented that
the society was neglecting its business
and the Mayor asked if license fees and
ﬁnes were not still being collected.

“They are,” said the Comptroller,
“and that isn’t the worst“ part of it.

‘ I’ll tell you about my dog. They bor~
I rowed it from my stable, and I had a.

Mayor McClellan said that he had

back, even by injunction.

“I think,” said the Mayor, “that the
societyought to 'be looked into. ‘91,,Iiaevt.

cats and dogs is responsible for the dc-

is- of the right kind, while "many others,

district is not the proper place for hai-
b-oring mongrel curs and homeless
felines. The feeling between the two
factions increases with time. and the

animals. .

The complainant, Charles Barnes. of
42 Herkimer place, said that Collins
had taken his (Barnes’s) dog, and after
tying a rope around its neck held it
up in the air and beat it over the head .
with a shovel until life has extinct.
Collins pleaded guilty but asked for an
opportunity to explain the reason of
iis seemingly inhuman act.

On the day the dog met with such a
painful death, according to Collins, his

ing on the street in front of his home
and while at play was attacked by the
log, which sprang at him and sank i
its teeth in the child’s breast. The;
youth was terribly frightened and after .
getting out of the animal’s clutches
ran into the house, _Where he sank
to the. floor utterly exhausted by the
loss of blood and the fight he had put
up. , ..
A. physician was summoned and the his
wounds dressed.

The father when he arrived home
that night andwhen info ‘med of what

 

 

 

 

    

 

 

 
 
 
  

had happened, in no amiable mood,
started to look for Barnes’ dog, and

  

when he found him he proceeded to
put the animal to death in the manner
described above.

The court. after examining Mrs.
Barnes and her son, called little Henry,
the victim, and questioned him. He
was willing to show to the Court Where
he had been bitten, but this was not
asked. The Court did not deliberate

same day.
The. operation preparatory to a dog‘s de—
mise is his capture. Usually this consists

'1' merely in placing him in the ambulance, but
f there are dogs who do not appreciate the
,‘ worthy intentions of the ofﬁcers, hence the
} wishes of the two do not harmonize. There
are some tramp dogs, who imagine that they
- can still discern something sweet in life. and
2' in their en‘orts to remain here and get.
i a taste of the sweetness, they accidentally
i, taste the officer’s hand. ‘When affairs reach
_ this highly unsatisfactory stage, a. lasso is
brought into use and the refractory instincts
,t of the brute are restrained. The cats are
‘ kept in compartments separate from the
,.. dogs and, it there are any kittens. each
.l litter is placed in an individual basket.

 

9. When the ambulances reach the Shelter,
., the man who unloads them calls out. “Killer”
‘ 0r “Shelter," as he takes each animal from
. the wagons. The first call means that the
. owner has sent the animal there to be killed
. and it goes into the tank at once, but the

‘5, second indicates that it has been picked up
. on the street and must be sheltered for forty-
,f' eight hours. The best possible care is given
‘ to the animals that remain at the Shelter
-, during the Speciﬁed time. Sawdust is strewn
. 0n the ﬂoors of the stalls Where the dogs are
i. kept, they are given fresh water in thor-
oughly cleaned troughs and. in cases of dis-
. .ease, everything is done to alleviate their
‘ suffering. I! a young puppy that cannot eat
is brought in, it is given a bottle to nurse
on. Owing to the aggressive distiosition of
cats, they are kept in individual cages. The
food consists of the fresh hearts of cattle
boiled with meal into porridge.
After many experiments it was decided
that anaesthesia by illuminating gas was the.
' most humane manner of destroying animals.
Carbonic acid gas was tried. but the use of
1t is attended with suffocation and for this
reason causes some pain or irritation. All
DOisons are more or 1» ss irritants, and cannot
buf be painful. Drowning is much slower in
Producing results than illuminating gas. The
Gestroyinu tank is about ll) feet long and 4
feet in height and breadth. This is suiti-
Clently large- to cont-tin any number of dogs
and cats that would it"('llllllllzti€‘ in one day.

te-ri‘ercnce on the \part'of bystanders.
"line of the greatest refOrms by the so-
t-iety was in the methods of transpoxt-
in}: animals. Formerly poultry dealers
would go through the streets carrying
fow'ls by the legs andletting theirheads
diag along the sidewalks or over the
rough cobble, Poultry is now transport-
ed in crates, and the agents of the so—
ciety visit the poultry markets daily to
see that the society’s restrictions as re-
gards the size. of crates, number of ani-
mals in a compartment, proper ventila-
tion, etc. ., are not violated, and also that
the animals are properly fed and watered
and receive kind treatment. The method
of slaughtering cattle sent to this city
has been improved until now it is prob-
ably as humane as it can be. The.

 

treatment of animals. intended for}

shelters are well cared for.

with running water,
animals is wholesome and -abundant.

The society’s veterinary surgeon visits

the shelters regularly. It is worth men-

-tioning that ninety per cent. of the dogs ’
are street outcasts and generally dis-1
eased. A painless death awaits these

poor, homeless wanderers, in the gas

chamber, a much more merciful endthan

by drowning. Each shelter has a room

constructed especially for this purpose.

It is, perfectly airtight. The captives are

led in, the door closes upon them, the

gas is turned on, and in a few minutes.
they are gamboling in the “happy hunt-

ing grounds,” where the wicked cease“
from troubling and the weary are at.
rest.

When the pupils gathered in the class-€

closely to see who would comply With
the request. Prof. Van Denberg smiled.

Dr. Vlyman, principal of the SChool.
Eiad invited a. newspaper reporter to bet:

berg had obtained a. eat.

It was chloroformed, and soon theg
knife was laying, the carcass open whilst:
the girls looked on in horror and thee
young men in disgust. The lecturer pro-
seeded to discourse on the anatomy ot‘:

MA PET 0N KILLED.

Sauter Admitted that He Was the Mur-

derer and Gives a Reason.
‘ George Sauter, a young printer, who lives ,
at No. 125 George street, shot and killed a
pet cat belonging to the family of Joseph
Stalf, in. an adjoining house early yesterday
morning, and to-day he was a prisoner 1n the
Lee Avenue Police Court, charged by the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals with having tortured the cat. The
feline, according to the Stall family, Was the
pride of the neighborhood. It had a. musical
voice, and lately was delighted in sunning
itself just under the window oistoauter's
room. Sauter undertook to get l‘lCl ot .the
cat and obtained the loan of a Flobcrt riﬂe.
“’llen all was quiet in the neighborhood at
2 o’clock yesterday morning Sauter lay in
wait for the cat. \Vhen it appeared on the
fence Sauter riddled it with bullets. Then
he threw the carcass into the street. It just
happened, that Stalf heard the shooting, and
on looking out of the window saw Sauter in
his yard. He complained to the society, and
a V's-rant against Sauter was issued. \Vhen
he was arraigned in court to-day he admitted
killing the cat, and said he did it because it
was-evident to him that the cat was coo-
stantly annoying him, and besides it had ﬁts
frequently and was better dead than alive.
The case was adjourned. .

ﬁnds the Residents of thirtield Place
' indignant.

Zecplc who reside on (Ilarlleld pla cc, on
the block between Sixth and. Eleventh are
rules. are very indignant over an exhibition
of cruelty to animals. which. it, is alleged,
tool; Milt-‘0 there yesterday. The driver of c.
three horse ssh wagon, it is said, subjected
the poor animals in his charge to the. most
brutal abuse because they were unable to
pull the en«.n:mous load of ashes that was
heaped upon the wagon. A. lady living :11.
No. 1533 (Ti-.ll'ﬁeld place witnessed the whole
affair. Her version of it is:

“I was attracted to my window by the
loud shouts and tramping of Horses which
I heard in the street, and I saw the driver
of an ash wagon lashing his horses dilmer-
cifuily while they were seemingly unable
to pull the heavy load. They did not balk,
but made every effort possible to get away
from the whip, which was being used with
terrible effect upon, them. Finding that his
brutality had not the desired "effect the
driver stood on the curb and with his closed
list beat the near horse about the ears,
while“ the poor animal fairly trembled with
ft-‘vdl‘. He then tried the lush .guin on all
three horses with the former result. At
this time almost every window in the street
was occupied by the indignant occupants of
the neighboring houses; many of them called
to- him to desist his inhuman treatment. and
he turned to a lady who lives in a ﬂat a, few
doors from us and said: ‘What do I care for
you, or what you do? I am no more afraid
of you than of the horses.’ Two little chil-
dren Were standing ncur him, as he spoke
and he made a. rush {it then), wielding his,
wt in as if to strike them. Ho returned to
the bewildered animals, and, standing to
one side, near their head, he cruellv lashed
them across the face with :his whip. Sev-
eral pople made protests against his treat-
ment of the dumb beasts, but not until a
gentleman ’who was passing interfered did
he desist. It was the most llorrifvino' dis.
play of brutality I have ever wlitnzqgelg]
Surely something can be done to colnjei
those ﬁends to respect the feelings of hilllll'ln
beings if they have no 'CQllll'lﬂSSlOD on the
poor animals placed in their charge. I have
no desire to be brought into court, but would

cheerfully make a complaint elsewhere did
i know of any to interfere in behalf bf
‘man’s best friend.’ By giving publicity to

this I trust that someone- in authority Will;

take it up and save us from Witnessing such
brutal displays in our. thoroughfares 5

FOR OUR ANIMAL FRIENDS.

The thirtieth annual report of the Amer-
ican Society for the I’rcvcnzion of Cruelty
to Animals shows a year's good Wol‘li by

charge and their
everywhere, and
paper reports that have boon made of the

a trustworthy Character. ‘
!

who have its affairs in

agents and colalmrcrs

supplements the now:—

In the view of the society’s president,
John P. Haincs, the most not-able (H'l‘lll"'
rcnce of the your past was the cstablish—
ment of the Shelter for Animals in Brook-
lyn at the corner of Malbone strcct and
Nostrand avenue, to which lost, strayed
and homeless animals have been taken
since Aug. 15 last.

The report says that during the
months cn-d‘ii g Dec. 31 the number of dogs
taken care of was ‘50 per cont. greater than
, the number captured under the old system
i duning the whole year of 1804; and, as
many observers know, the capzure is made
in a much easier way without any of the

li V r:

brutality shown so freely by the old-time
dog catcher.

In the two Shelters, the one in New York
and that here, 21,711 dogs were received,
3,192 were returned to owners, and homes
found for 397, while 24,000 cars Wore taken

posed of, thus also preventing the spread
of disease germs carried about by them.

In addition to other work the society is
congratulated upon the inﬂuence exerted for
good by the circulation of “Our Animal
l Friends” and other humane publication-s
issued from its ofﬁce. The report is a
modest exposition of the really noble and
disinterested task which the secicty has
setitself, but it is not necessary to resort to
self-praise in order to secure the apprecia—
tion of the people who see its good work
from day to day.

LOST CATS AND DOGS.

A FEW HINTS FROM A LOVER 0F
ANIMALS.
To the, Editor of the lfirooklyii Eagle;

Why is it most every day one sees, by
lf‘MJklllg‘ over “Lost. and Found” in your val-
liable paper, that so many dogs and cats are mis.
slug? 1, being one very fond of aniii'ials, would
like to give a few hints as to the care of them,

, for m ll‘lc there is no sadder sight (excepting, of
;’ cars“, a little child). than to see a little or big
' gs; 3:; the streets of a big city like Brooklyn.
l 35....v- -u".~::i watched them. How they will go to
, .. ,, wagging their tails, hoping for a
iiillvl wrl, time out of ten persons will
I pass them by unnoticed. I fell, as all other lovers
9 of animals must feel, so thankful that the Society
:for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has
1 taken this responsibility on its shoulders and ll
jdoing such a noble Work, and I hope that our
beautiful will have on its streets not one
pom“, starving. homeless dog or cat, and that
everyone owning animals will conform to rules
and get thr-ir licenses. If persons seeing a poor,
hungry, lust dug on the street near their homes
would take it ii; and notify the society, they would
call for it. I have done this myself, and had
‘ them call within twenty-four hours, and know of
, three cases where parties have asked them to call
x for Cats. and in every case have they responded.
and always the ofﬁcers have been kind andgentle.
Then, again, people owning pets should take belt-
ter care of them, Ind have springs put on their,
basement doors, so that when the butcher, grocer '
boy, iceman, comes in. the doors would not stand
open. That is the way many pet animals get out.
They wander off, gct frightened, bewildered and
wander the streets for weeks. People losing them
advertise for them once or twice. Sometimes they
are found and returned, but very often they are
still on the streets. Cats differ from dogs.” They
are much better able to care for themselves, and
can get out of harm’s way by Climbing fences.
hiding, etc, but a, little dog is much more help-
less. I hope every kind hearted person who sees
a dog lost will take it in, and of they cannot ﬁnd
the owner, then notify the society. Those who
have lost their pets should not give them up too
easily, but keep up the search, and when. lost, if
they give the name, as well as a good descrip-
tion of the dog, their chances of having them re-
turned are better. No dog should be on the street
alone. A LOVER OF NIMALS.

S. P. C. A. Officers Find Feather
Weights but No
Feathers.

Michael Kearny’s Sporting resort on:
Grecnpoint' avenue. just over the Queens
County line, was the scene :Of a liVEIY‘ com-
motion shortly before 5 'O’CIOCk yesterday
afternoon, when General Superintendent ,
,‘Ch-arles H. Hankinson, of the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, ac-
companied by twelve uniformed ii-o-ﬁicers,
made a descent “upon-the place, in’anticipaeé
tion of breaking up a ﬂicking, ‘ﬁl‘din and-5"
effecting wholesale arrests. " ,

Oﬁicers Evans, Grace, Denyiseandi Sea-
man, from the W'illougihzby street oﬂi-c‘ergi-of
the society, accompanied the superintendent-
to Blissville; where they were joined by
seven New Y-Ork men, and one from Long
Island City. For a number of years
Kearny’s establishment has been under
surveillance, but. according to In'Spector
Clark, although cocking mains and dog
ﬁghts are of frequent occurrence, the so-
ciety only once succeeded in effecting his
arrest for a violation of the law,

Superintendent Hankinson, from-7 What
he believed to be an entirely reliable-source,
received word early, in the week that a
main between New Jersey and Long Island

at 3 o‘clock in the afternoon and continuing
until an early hour this morning. “When he
entered the place, however, a boxing match

were distinguished by their absence. .
The sight of the blue uniform and brass
buttons created a panic for a few minutes
among the crowd of sports assembled in the
hall, and several scrambled out of the
windows and took to their heels. 'W‘hen
told what the purpose of the superinten-
dent's visit was, Kearny graciously handed
over the keys of his establishment and gave
the officers “carte blanche” to inspect his
premises. Every hole and corner was ex—
amined, but if the birds were about the
placo they had been so cleverly concealed
that not a tl‘lvlCG of them could be found.
A detachment of the ofﬁcers remained on

and then Kcarny was informed that it; was
the intention of the society to prosecute
him to the full extent of the law if a cock—
ing 'iniain or dog light was ever discovered
in progress in his establishment. The pro-
pricier smiled assent, and bid the ofﬁcers
a cheerful good nightL

AS TO DOG LICENSES. l

 

President of A. S. .P. C‘. A. Calls
Attention to Bad Methods in
Other Cities.

To the Editor of the Brooklyn Times:

gSIR: The article in the Times last
gfaturday headed “S. P. C. A. Must De~
end ’lax Levied on Dogs,” contains sev-
eral quotations of statistics which do
not agree W1th any in the records of this
office. and I am too well assured of the
fairness of the Times to doubt that Space
W111 be given in order that the society
, play put Itself right before the public.
1 Through the medium of the press the
some“; is glad to take the people into its
Cpnﬁd nce at all times, for this organiza—
tlon Is a. creation of. the-sovereign 13801319
through the1r_Legisla.ture, deputized to
act for them in protecting animals, and-
therefore, a public corporation

 

 

. 1 .may begin by saying frankly that the
somety has nothing against any of the

persons who have widely advertised their
intention of attacking the constitutionali-
ty of the License'law. but so long as that
law remalns on the statute books, it is
mandatory on the society to live u to its
prowslons. Official ﬁgures s'hOW't at the
number of dog owners Who secure a
license each year has been steadily in-
creasmg since these fees have been pay-

able'to the A S; P. C_ A.

5““T1mes have changed.” indeed, and
l dog catchers (of the city") have had
their day." but, instead, decently“ paid,
decently clad and well-disciplined em-

ployees of the society have taken their
places, and since the work hasgrown,
more men are employed than under the
city regime. . "

In some places “deg catchers" are still -
employed by the municipality. Thus in
Paris, according to a. Sun cable of Feb-
ruary 17, “the revenue authorities, with
a VleW of outwitting dog owners who
persistently evade the (10;; tax by deny-
ing possession of the animals, have em
gaged a number of men who are accom-
plished in imitating the voice of a clog.
These artists promenade the streets at
night-and bark outside suspected; houses.
If a dog is Within it invariably replies,
thus betraying its owner. The next day
a. collector visits the owner and gathers
in the tax. The human barkers receive
$39 a month pay.”

In Los Angeles, Cal, according to the
Herald of that city. May 3. not only
“are dogs taken up off the street. but. a.
deliberate plan ls followed forenticing
dogs onto the street, by trailing behind
the dog catchers wagon a poor, wretch.
of a female dog as a. decoy to draw Clogs
off their owners’ lawns and premises.”

As to the statement that “under pres-
ent circumstances it is hard to tell what
(logs are licensed and what are not.” I
can give you the. means of so determin—
ing as prescribed by the License law—
look at the dog’s collar, and if it is
licensed. the collar will bear a numbered
brass tag. .

As for the methods by which the dog
catchers Operated in old Brooklyn, turn
to you own files for abundant proof of
the improvement wrought by this so-
ciety.

A. S. P. C. A.
mals are now

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shelters for small ani-
maintained at Malbono
street: and Nostrand avenue, Brooklyn;
1,02d street and East River, Manhattan,
land \Vave street, Stapleton, Richmond.

The equipment of these three establish-
ments cost. more than 5820.000. and includes
horses, vehicles, motor ambulances, etc.
The work has so increased that these,
quarters are barely sufficient for the
society’s needs, and alterations and ad~
:ditions have been required from time to
Itime. More than 400.000 clOgs and more
than 800,000 cats have been cared for.
land at present the society employs 35
men directly engaged in shelter work.
The total cost of this work In 1907 was
$6656.52. . .

Besides the shelters the society maln-
tains an ambulance station in, Brooklyn.
and another in'Manhattan, and, for the
next four months will provide four ad—
ditional sub-shelters for the receptioui
of small animals. These will be located
in the more densely populated portions of
the city.

Finally. no license law for cats has
ever been urged or even ’contemplated by
this society.

This society exists for no other pur—
pose than the protection of animals, andl
in the execution of the law its ﬁrst duty!
is to protect strayed animals from all
cruelty, and, as far as possible, to avoid

In October he opened the front door
of Richards’s jewelry store with a. skele-
ton- key and carried out $300 worth of
silverware with which to adorn his own
dining table. He wanted silver candle-
sticks, but could ﬁnd none in the stock

A few weeks afterward he saw that
Jeweller Richards had put in his window
'a stock of handsome silver candelabra.
l‘ha‘t very evening he entered the store
again and carried home candelabra to
match the stolen silverware.

Davis would often rob two or three
stores in one night. On July 16 he en-
tered a shoe store and took $70 and
shoes of the best quality for his wife
and children. Next he went into an
optical goods store and took three
cameras.

Since July he has never paid a cent
for photographic materials. Whenever
he needed ﬁlms or plates he would make
another journey at night to the same
store. K

irrather Rushed Out With a. Chisel
and Ripped the Animal Open—It
' Was Then Shot—The Man Prose-
outed for Cruelty to Animals in
.‘ﬂGates Avenue Court To-D‘ay. '

A valuable, thoroughbred St.
1pup, from the famous Hellgate kennels,
was slaughtere ed with a chisel on Jerome
. street 011 the morning of May 28th, and as
a result Adolph Rose, of No. 110 Jerome
street, was prosecuted in Gates Avenue
Court to- daV before \Iagistrate Worth on a
charge of cruelty to animals. The prosecu-
:tion was undertaken by the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

. M15. Annie \ illiamson, wife of the owner
Iof the dog. who lives at No. 112 Jerome
street, said that the St. Bernard was ﬁve
weeks old, and that she had had it for two
”weeks. On the morning in question it was
playing on the sidewalk with several chil-
a dren, and then, she said, as the pup passed
her gate Rose rushed out and chiseled it.

Witness said that after Rose had 11 ringed
L the sharp edge of the chisel into the dog
1' several times he carried the pup to the curb
:and left it there e. Shortly afterward a man
ﬁttiame along and shot it. ‘

‘ “Have vou anything ag "ainst this man
Rose?” witness was asked.

“Nothing at all except for the brutal way
in which he killed the pup before the chil-
,dren.”

Considerable other evidence was given
corroborative of the chiseling of the. St.
‘ Bernard by Rose. He himself did not deny
ithe killinn. He said:

’ “I was going out to put in a screen in a
’ cellar window when I saw a mad dog take
hold of my little girl by the calf of the
. leg. I threw myself down in front of the
‘girl and tried to get the dog away. It
i would not let go its hold, I had a chisel
, in my hands. and I struck him three times
{and then Mr. West came along and shot

HE-LD FOR POISONING DOG.

Wealthy Thomas H. Howard, of
Kensington, Must Answer in a.

Higher Court.

 

 

 

he plunged 'tiw'ice into the dog's back.

The trial of Thomas H. Howard, a
wealthy retired merchant of Kensington,
for cruelty to animals. as alleged. was he—
gun this morning in the Grant Street Po-
lice Court before )IagiStrate Lemon. Mr.
Howard lives at the corner of Ocean Bou-
levard and Avenue E. The complainant
was Mrs. McIntyre. the wife of Stockbrok-
er Syrenus McIntyre, who lives next door
to Howard.

The neighbors have not been friends for
some time owing to a dispute about harn-
vard stock. Mr. Howard is accused of kill-
ing a $500 collie dog named Laddie, of
which Mrs. Howard and bet- little child
were passionately fond.

The testimony revealed the fact that on
the 4th inst the dog jumped the fence and
ran after the carriage of Mr. and Mrs,
Howard for several hundred feet on the
Boulevard. barking furiously at the couple.
Later. when the dog came hack. and Mr.
Howard got home. the dog was seen to eat
some meat and later died. The veterinar-
ian of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals analyzed the dog’s
stomach, and some of the meat which the
do}.r had left and found stryclilline in both.

Mr. Howard was rel‘lrcsented this morn-
ing by Lawyer Luke D. Stapleton while
Lawyer George F. Elliott. appeared for the
prosecution as representing the S. P. C. A.
Upon the testimony Magistrate Lemon held
Mr. Howard for the Court of Special Ses-
sions.

VALUABLE DOG INJURED.

Thomas Nolan, Charged with Kniﬁng
It, Remanded to Jail.

The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals has taken charge of the com-

1

'plaint made against Thomas McKee in the

Lee Avenue Court to-d-ay, of having cruelly
treated a St. Bernard dog ltlelonging to Mrs.
Brenner, who lives ill Hopkins street, near
Nostrand avenue. The dog, which is a Valu-
able one, is dying from two knife wounds,
inﬂicted, so it is said, by McKee. Policeman
Nolan, of the Vernon Avenue Station, who
says that he witnessed the assault, appeared
in court today with a large knife, which,
he said, lhe rtook from the prisoner after the
cutting. McKee entered a plea of not guilty
to the charge when it was read to him by
Magistrate Kramer, and was remanded to
jail tin default of bail. During the, past month
the dog has been stolen half a dozen times,
and Mrs. Brenner never got it back 'without
offering a reward.

Last night Mrs. Brenner was walking
along Hopkins street with the dog. She

inoticed that McKee was endeav-oring to en—

tice [the animal into a saloon at the corner of
Marcy avenue and Hopkins street. Mrs.
Brenner told McKee that he was the one
who had stolen the dog on former occasions.
This enraged McKee, land running,r into the
saloon secured a knife. This, it is alleged,
The
dog will probably die.

Attacked by two of the scores of home-
less and in many cases. mangy curs. that.
infest the shore between Coney Island and,
Brighton Beach, menacing every one W110
walks along the ocean front, Rita Clark, '8
years old, whose home is in West Thirty-
second street, Coney Island, was mangled
terribly yesterday on the Balmer section
of the beach. The maddened animals also
leaped at Patrolman Brennan when he
went’to the rescue of the child and at-
tempted to drive them away with his
club. The curs ripped his uniform before
he shot them to death. The little girl was
taken to the ReceptionHospital in Coney
Island. The dead dogs were taken to the
policellstation. Their heads, out off, were
sent. to" the city laboratoily' to learn
whetherthe animals had?
rabies.

Rita was playing on the ,,

against the terrible odds. Her struggles.
only made the dogs more furious, and
they hit her repeatedly.

Patrolman Brennan, running up, began
to beat the animals on the head with his
club. Snarling, they Sprang at his throat.
He. beat them dOWn, but they snapped
viciously a: his legs. Their teeth ripped
his trousers int-o shreds from the knees
down, but did not fasten in the ﬂesh.
Shifting the club to his left hand and
S‘tilhpounding the animals with it, Bren-
nan drew his pistol and sent a bullet, into
the head of the nearest. dog. Another
shot ended the life of, its companion.
Little Rita was on the verge of collapse?
from shock and ‘ loss _ of blood. Dr.
Michaelis came from the Reception Hos-
pital and hurried her to‘that place, where
her wounds were cauterized. The surgeons
said her condition was serious. w '

Will Kill All Stray Dogs.
Beginning .to-morrow, all stray dogs
found in the streets and in public places
of the city Will be taken to the pound and
killed, Commissioner of Health Darling-
ton announced yesterday. The order does
not {pcluxde dogs that ,are muzzled or tied
to a leash. “It makes no difference
whether the dog is worth 5 cents or $5,900,"
said the Commissioner. “If it. is found
loose or unmuzzled, off to be killed it goes,
and there will be no redeeming these ani-
mals at the pound, as before."

Society’s Veterinary Examined Am-i
‘mal Six Hours After Arrest, and f
Recommended Dismissal of Case.

 

i

Policeman Albert H. Owens of the
Parkville station was the complainant
against Ray Hulse, a driver, of 158 Clas-g
son avenue, in the Flatbush court to-day,
where he charged him with cruelty to
animals. Despite the presentation of a
statement declaring the animal ﬁt for
duty and recommending the suspension;
of sentence on the defendant by Dr. Her- .
bert J. Btotheridge, a veternarian, of. 193
Carlton avenue, Owens demanded "the
right to place ﬁve witnesses on the stand,
who testiﬁed to the condition of the,:
horse. Magistrate Steers, on the request'
of Inspector Grace, who was in court to.
represent the [Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals, adjourned the
hearing until April 14, when the case will
be continued and disposed of.

There was a slight hitch in the differ—
ent reports furnished to the court by
Owens and Dr. Brotheridge. The police-
man claimed that he made the arrest at
10:30 A.M; Sunday, on Ocean parkway,
near Caton avenue, while the animal, one
of a team drawing a van loaded with fur-
niture, was suffering from “scratches” on
an his fetlocks. The chief wound, and
which evidently gave the horse more pain
than the others, Owens said, was on the
right hind leg, which was bleeding freely.

THE PROJECTED BUILDING FOR THE E’s

frontage of 100 feet in Madison~ave., facing the Madi-
son Square Garden, and a frontage of. 30 feet in
Twenty-sixth—st.

Plans on ﬁle in the Department of Buildings indi-
cate that the structure will be six stories in height,
with basement and sub—cellar and a mansard roof 9.
with highly decorated cornice. The main entrance, in
Madison—ave, will be ornamented by a cluster of
columns supporting a balcony. A steel framework
will sustain the ﬂoors, and the front walls will be of .
Indiana limestone.~ The building will be fireproof
and have all the modern improvements for safety
and comfort. It will be devoted to the exclusive, use
of the society. OfHCers of the organization have said
that there may be a modiﬁcation of the plans, so as
to dispense with the ornamental cornice and mansard
roof and lessen the cost of the building. The task of
digging the excavation is nearly completed and the
work of laying the foundation has been begun, It is
expected that the structure will be ready for use in
November, 1897.

The lot is one of the choicest sites for building pur...
poses in the city. It has been held at such a high
ﬁgure that it was regarded as too expensive a, site

by the erection of the Madison Square Garden. Its
frontage on Madison Square prevents any building
on it from being overshadowed by any building .15

in the city. It is assessedfor $90,000 for taxation, and

Garden, in which the Horse Show, Dog Show and.
)ther annual shows are held. When we are. hidden
tway in the middle of a block few people know
where to ﬁnd us. The value of our work depends
largely on the complaints which we receive from
citizens. If the citizens do not know where to
send complaints without consulting a directory,
they will often fail to send the complaints. The
somety is supported by public contributions and
bequests, and its work depends on them. When
the s001ety’s home is in the public gaze more people
will know about the society’s work and be ready
to support it.”

Some of the contributors to the funds of the soci-
ety have said that if it was necessary to have prom-
inent headquarters, the managers might have been
content with buying the site and making use of the
large house which stood on the corner instead of
tearing it down to make room for the imposing
structure which the society is to build. It would
have been cheaper, they say, to have built an addi-
tion to the house, which was spacious and well built,
and the yearly expense of maintaining the head-
quarters would not have been so great in the future.

measure for the decision of the Board ,~

elty to Animals. Comptroller Metz and
l . v
the Law Department Will do the “keel-
iliaiiling," to use the Mayor’s term. Not
ionly will the accounts of the society he
iexamined. but also its right to issue
Edog licenses and collect money for
3 them. I
L The Mayor, Bird S. Coler and other
‘mcn'iheiis of the board contend that tile
lact of the Legislature under which the
isociety operates is unconstitutional, and
1a Still is contemplated to recover for.
.the city all the dog license money it
ihas collected since 1891. This amounts
lt'O nearly three-quarters of a million.-
last year the city received $61,654 lrom
{licenses and redemptions, and in 1906 the
ImanniOLiiit was $36,372. ‘ i
‘5 The troulile began when Health Corn-l
‘milssloner Dnrlington asked the board
‘for an (illili'alprléli'll’lll of $15,000 for the
.-purpose of impounding stray dogs and

Dr. Darlington, Commissioner of thei

W'illard Parker Hospital at the foot of’
' East Sixteenth street,” he said. “The 5
epidemic is worse on Staten Island than i
elsewhere. We have taken from State-n 5

Island 178 dogs during the last year, ‘
Iand it is not all stamped out yet."‘

Twenty—eight persons died of rabies in ‘
. ,New York City last: year.

The Health Department of this city

, has taken up some of the work of the

A New Danger.

At the Vital Statistics Bureau of the
{Department of Health it was said that
there was no doubt that within a year
'o'r tWO there had been more cases of
rabies than usual for forty years back.
Thirteen of the twenty-eight deaths last 1

year were in .Manhattan, eleven In’
-Brooklyn, three in 'Qu'een'sand one in
the Bronx. .

Mr.’ Horton, at th«e_0ﬂ‘lce of the So-
“eiety for the Prevention O'f‘CI‘uelty to
Animals, yesterday: explained that the,
'movement to suppress informatiO-n about i
rabies in dog-S “ aénd hydrophobia in .9

“Incidentally I might add that .the
power of licensing 'dogs has not been
taken from the somety yet, and went

DIDN’T P'AY'OlVER THE $3.

 

 

But His Son Brought Home Re- i
ceipt for Fee. l

 

Because of trouble that he has had
with the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals Borough President
Coler declared to-day that he is under~
taking a personal fight against the so— i
ciety for the collection of licenses. He
claims that the society has no legal
right to collect license money and ap—
propriate it to its own use.

Mr, Coler is very wrathy against .
what he calls the “stealing" of an f
Irish terrier belonging to him by the ‘
employes of the society. Incidentally
L he says that a statement made by W.
K. Horton, general manager of the S.
P. C. A., in connection with the case
> is "absolutely untrue.”

Evidently there is a lot of trouble in " ‘“'
store for the S. P. C. A., inasmuch as '
the Board of Estimate voted unani-
mously to investigate the society after ..
the Mayor and Mr. Coler had told of

instances in which they had had trou-
ble with that organization. '
Coler’s deg was taken from his prem—
ises on Jan. 4. He went personally to
the "pound” and demanded the return
of. the animal. His son, «Eugene,
finally. secured the terrier and return-
ed home with it and a receipt for $3,
the license fee. Mr. Colerstates it
wasunderstood he should not pay the
money, and he has not paid it. -When
the dog was taken, away he Wrote a let-
. to the society, in which he said:
“Your man. without warrant of law,
forcibly took an imported Irish ter-
rier belonging to inferﬁp'rnpr‘ivafe prem-
ise-s at 738 St. Marks avenue. 'This dog
was brought from Queenstown, Ire-
land, .in March of last year by James ‘
Dunne. This is to noti y you that your
society will be held f0 damage to the

 

as the trouble and expense caused by
such unlawful act. I have personally
caused a tag to be placed upon the
animal in your shelter house, so that
no mistake will be made by your man.
Demand is hereby made that this ani—
mal be immediately returned to the
premises from which he *Was taken
yesterday afternoon.” ”I,
“This collection of licenses for dogs
is unwarranted,” said Mr. Coler to—
day, “and any person who has had a
dog taken by this Society can easily
recover not only the dog but damages
for the trouble that has been given.
“When we first made inquiries for
the dog it was denied that any such
dog had been taken. The police who
had been appealed to were unable to
find any Irish terrier in the Society’s . T
collection, and the Society’s agents .L
said that they made a search and were .
unable to discover any. I then went
myself with my son to the Seeiety’s
pound and we found the dog.” .

The Borough Presidentcalled in his
counsel this morning and 'instructed
him to begin a; fight against the S. P.g
C. A.

the new home of the
American Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals. to be erected on
the northwest corner of
Twenty—siXth street and
Madison avenue, as previ~
ously told in the IiﬁlR.iLl.'l.:
' t is to be a six story building, one ilUlldl‘ELli
feet by thirty, with the larger frontage and
entrance in Madison avenue. It is designed
‘ expressly for the purposes of the. society and
i is to be devoted e:-:clusively to its use.
The building will be constructed of Indiana.
limestone on it steel framework. and will be

 

and the president's room will occupy the.

rooms. The museum and dormitories for the

‘ ofﬁcers will be on the ﬁfth floor. while. the

printing plant of the society will take up'tha

rooms of the ofﬁcers will be. located.

The president of the society, John 1)..

been ﬁnally estimated. It is to be. ready for‘

l . . 'HOfse Beating; “~37; -.

It would bé‘ well if’the poWers and
duties of the Society for the' Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals were accurately
deﬁned and‘if men inits employ were
willing to do all that: was required of

them. On a recent evening a dying
horse-was savagely beaten by a. two--

legged brute on one of our streets. He
had been overdriven and at last fellin
his tracks. Finding. that whipping and
kicking would not put him on his feet
again, the driver tied a rope around his;

horse’s neck and began to pull at its.
People gathered around and tried to
shame him or persuade him from this

course, but 1he answered that he would
blow them to a bad place’if they didn’t
let him alone. Two residents of the
vicinity, it physician and a lawyer, at
last went to the rescue or the animal
and in spite of the fellow’s threats, cut

away the rope. Anofﬁcer of the 'so-'

ciety above named was called, but he.

-made no arrest and would not do any-

thing wibh the animal until the owner
had been seen. An ofﬁcer of the regu-
larpollce force was ﬁnally discovered,
andrfhe put the driver under arrest. The
horse died in a few minutes. _
It would seem as if the matter niig-ht
have been simpliﬁed by giving authority
to the society’s ofﬁcer to arrest a man
Who needed arresting the worst kind of
a way. It would also seem as if he
might put an end to the sufferings of
the tortured animal that was groaning
on the pavement. The society exists for
the express punpose of preventing need-
less pain and of curbing just such im-

bruted people as this driver. There are‘

hundreds of such employed in our cities
and it is one of the happiest factors in
the slow disappearance of the, horse be-
fore the more adequate‘trolley and ele—
vated cars and bicycles that such peo—
ple Will have less and less power to

hurt and cripple him. They are men of,
the harshest material, frequently drunk,

always prufﬁanly, delighting in sudden
dash-es against walkers and bicyclers,
noisy, profane and unintelligent. A Spec-
ial police is maintained to hold them in
check, and the moral and material effect

of such policing is lost unless duty is;

done promptly and fearlessly.
