ADDRESS OF THE PRESIDENT.

Nearly twenty-three years have elapsed since the ﬁrst meeting
was held in this city for the purpose of considering a question
which till then had never attracted public attention in America,
but which affected the welfare of many thousands of dumb
creatures.

Probably those present at that meeting did not foresee the
beneﬁcent results the movement inaugurated on that occasion
was destined to achieve. , '

The reform then instituted bore a striking analogy, in its moral
principles, to that great popular edict which rescued millions of
human beings from the oppressor’s lash, and conferred upon
them the blessings of American citizenship. It took the part of
the helpless against the strong ; it taught men to be kind to those
dependent upon them.

At that time comparatively few realized the fact that animals
possess prerogatives, which they were under moral obligations to
respect, and of which, not even by the rights of ownership, could
they be deprived. The statutes of thirty-seven States and Terri-
tories in our Union have since given legal recognition to this
doctrine, and have constituted its violation a crime.

It is my painful duty to ofﬁcially announce to you the death,
on the 12th day of March last, of Henry Bergh, the ﬁrst President
and founder of your Society.

In doing so I shall not attempt to eulogize the life of one
whose devotion to the cause won for him the respect and com-
mendation of all right-thinking people.

There are probably few but those who enjoyed his most
intimate acquaintance, that appreciate the difﬁculties and dis-
couragements with which he was confronted in the early stages
'of this work. Undaunted by the opposition he so often met
with, and having in View only the one object to which he had

5

 




  

 

 

 

 

6

consecrated his life, he devoted his best energies to its advance-
ment, and lived to see the principles he so fearlessly and zealously
advocated generally recognized and adopted throughout his
native land.

Though he has passed away, the legacy he has bequeathed to
mankind remains and will continue to exert its civilizing in--
ﬂuence on all future generations. It will lead them to be better
in their relations to each other ; for he who is aCtuated by feel-
ings of sympathy for-a suffering animal will surely be governed
byrnobler im‘pulses‘in-his dealings with his fellow-men.

In the death of the late Hon. John T. Hoffman, our cause
has alsoplost a true and devoted friend. His interest in our
organization was arouSed at the outset, and his name enjoys the
distinction ofbeing the ﬁrst to appear upon its roll of founders.

, On, the 22d of April, 1866, at that time .Mayor of this city, he
presided over the ﬁrst meeting called for the purpose of organiz-
ing your Society, and from that time forward, through his inﬂu-
ence and assistance,pcontributed in no small degree to its pros-
perity and success. . _ ,

Our late President and" Mr. Hoffman may be said to have
begun this work together; through all the succeeding years they
were associated in its interests, and at the close of their useful
careers they passed away almost hand in hand from among us.

‘ The year 1888 formsan epoch in the history of your Society
which will long be remembered by its friends with sorrow and
afﬂiction. , j '

I . ,It is also with deepregret that I refer to the resignation of the

Hon; Elbridge'T. Gerry as counsel of your Society. The im-
portant services rendered by him during the many years he so
honorably ﬁlled that position are so well known as to require no
further words of praise or comment. Without reward of, any
kind he was ever ready to lend his brilliant attainments in behalf
of the suffering and helpless, no matter to what order of life they
belonged. ' _ _
Though his retirement as our legal adviser became necessary,
on account of the growing demands of other charitable objects
upon his time, it will be gratifying to our friends to 'know that

had previously been concealed, in order that he might tread upon
it and amuse an audience by his contortions.

It has been stated that rabbit-baiting tends to improve the
breed of dogs. The same argument can be advanced in favor of
dOg-ﬁghting and rat-baiting.

Those who engage in such practices cannot be called sports-
men in any sense of that word ; for the true sportsman is animated
by a spirit ofjustice which prevents him from taking an unfair
advantage of even ahelpless animal. . He ﬁres at birds only while
upon the wing ; he seeks game in its native haunts, where it is
afforded a reasonable chance of escape; and he often boldly en-
counters animals under circumstances where personal danger is
incurred.

That cruel exhibitions of all kinds develop the basest passions
of the human mind, is a well established matter of history. The
women of Rome regarded without a shudder the shedding of hu-
man blood, and directed the ruthless slaughter of the vanquished.
The fair maids of Spain visit the bull ring and applaud the scenes
of carnage there unfolded.

That, without some restraining inﬂuence, an approach to such
inhumanities might be possible among a certain class in America,
Iwas led to believe by an incident which occurred in a Long
Island court recently, and which gave me an additional illustra—
tion of how the human sensibilities may become blunted by
familiarity with acts of cruelty. An ofﬁcer of your Society was
describing, on the witness stand, an incident which took place at
a rabbit-baiting match, in which a helpless animal was torn to
pieces by two dogs, when I was horriﬁed to notice that one of
the ladies present seemed much amused at the most distressing
part of his narrative.

Once, while in the performance of my duty, I was approached
by a man, who came to express his thanks and approbation of my
interference in behalf of a maltreated animal. His face was
black with coal dust ; his hands were hard from honest toil.

The fair face and costly apparel of that woman concealed a con-
science devoid of pity—a heart as cold as marble. Beneath the
rough exterior of that friendless man there was a heart as tender
as a woman’s—a soul as gentle as a child’s.

RABBIT COURSING.

One of the noblest missions of woman is to reﬁne and elevate
the human mind, and through her example to inspire in man
a spirit of emulation for all that is good and true. That, with
rare exceptions, she most worthily performs this duty, is univer-
sally conceded.

There has been no result, in connection with our efforts to secure
the establishment of kindred societies in foreign lands, that has
given greater cause for congratulation than the news lately
received from Mexico, informing us that in several instances
bull-ﬁghting had been suppressed in that Republic.

At the time the Mexican Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals was organized, with Seﬁor Najera as its chief execu-
tive ofﬁcer, and supported by prominent ofﬁcials of that Govern-
ment, we felt assured that these barbarous scenes of bloodshed
were in time destined to succumb to its civilizing inﬂuences.
But that the end we desired would be so soon attained, we did
not venture to predict. When we consider that the Mexicans

may be said to have inherited their predilection for this so-called
amusement from their ancestors, and that bull-ﬁghting is still re-
garded by Spaniards as a national pastime, we may well congratu-
late our colleagues in Mexico on the good work they have
achieved. .

We are pained to observe how generally that patient servant of
the human race—the horse—is subjected to mutilation and
suffering merely to comply with the dictates of a wicked, senseless
custom. When their owners authorize the removal of the only
protection against insects with which nature has provided them,
do they realize the amount of pain their act occasions ? Do they
know that—unlike the house-ﬂy—the insect that persecutes the
horse is provided with fangs which penetrate the skin and occa-
sion untold suffering? That this is the case, the blood which
frequently ﬂows from the wound, as well as the efforts of the ani-
mal to dislodge them, plainly indicate. The inﬂiction is almost
interminable, and the animal has been rendered powerless to

prevent it. _

At the time I accepted the ofﬁce of President of your Society I
fully appreciated the great responsibilities which would devolve

 

 

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

10

upon me. I realized that the welfare of an institution which had
attained an important position among the benevolent organiza-
tions of the world depended in no small degree upon the judg-
ment I might exercise in the performance of my ofﬁcial functions.
I also fully appreciated the difﬁculties I would encounter in con-
ducting a work involving many issues, in regard to some of which
such a diversity of opinion exists.

Long and careful consideration of such questions has convinced
me that the interests of your Society can be best promoted
through the adoption of a conservative policy, combining prompt
and vigorous action on the one hand, with moderation on the
other.

The Legislature having invested us with great powers for the
reformation of abuses, in the performance of Our humane
mission we should endeavor to accomplish the greatest possible
good, while at the same time exercising a scrupulous regard for
the rights of individuals.

The more positive forms of cruelty are sufﬁciently numerous to
fully occupy our attention, and in this direction our best energies
have been exerted. That a measure of success has attended our
efforts, the statistics which appear elsewhere in this report will
encourage us to believe.

President.

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COM-
MITTEE.

In submitting their report for the year 1888, the Executive
Committee have not attempted to give an extended review of the
questions which have occupied the attention of the Society dur-
ing that time ; because the abuses which twenty-three years ago
called it into existence, as well as the reforms Which it has been
the means of effecting during the intervening period, are familiar
to almost every one in this community.

It affords satisfaction to know that the cause has made much
progress both at home and abroad during the year which has just
drawn to a close. Many new societies have been formed, and
most of those already in existence are prospering, and are better
able than formerly to carry out the humane objects for which they
were created.

SUMMARY.

The following table shows, in a condensed form, the work ac-
complished during the past twenty-three years :

Cases prosecuted in the Courts ............................... 14,841
Disabled Animals temporarily suspended from work... . . . . .. . . . 36,857
Horses, disabled past recovery, humanely destroyed... . . . . .. . . '. 26,554
Disabled Horses removed from the Streets in the Ambulances.. . 4,939
1888.
The aggregate result for the year 1888 is as follows :
Cases prosecuted in the Courts .............................. 991
Disabled Animals temporarily suspended from work ........... 1,749.
Horses, disabled past recovery, humanely destroyed ............ 2,455
Small Animals, disabled past recovery, humanely destroyed... . . 1,28I
Disabled Horses removed from the Sheets 111 the Ambulances. . 495
Complaints received and investigated ........................ 3,052.

property, after the payment of debts, legacies, and cost of litiga-
tion, was $65,063 60; but this does not include 341 shares of
the capital stock of the Holmes, Booth, & Haydens C0,, turned
over to the Society by the administrator, and which it was not
deemed advisable to sell at present prices.

The total proceeds were much less than had been anticipated,
owing to the impossibility of obtaining a satisfactory price for the
real estate, which was located at Waterbury, Conn., and which did
not produce sufﬁcient revenue to pay taxes and other expenses.

AMBULANCES.

The Ambulances for the removal of disabled animals, as usual,
have been instrumental in saving the lives of many valuable ani~
mals and restoring them to usefulness. The number of horses
removed from the streets in these vehicles during the year 1888,
was 495 ; and we regard this as the best possible evidence of
the important part they play in the alleviation of animal suffering.

The Society has heretofore labored under great disadvantages
in this branch of the work, in consequence of being obliged to
hire teams for this purpose ; but the early completion of the pro-
posed Hospital for Animals will enable us to avail ourselves of
the rapid system of harnessing in use by the Fire Department,
and thus aid us to expedite the relief of disabled animals.

THE LIFE-SAVING DERRICKS.

These derricks have also been called into requisition on a
number of occasions, and have performed important services

in rescuing animals from the rivers or excavations into which
they had fallen.

AGENTS.

The reports from the numerous agents of the Society through-
out the State, detailing their operations during the past year, are
most satisfactory; their presence has a restraining inﬂuence on
those cruelly inclined, and much suffering to animals is thus
pfevented without resorting to criminal prosecution.

 

 

 

 

 

 




    
 

 

 

 

 

I4
DOG- AND COCK-FIGHTING.

These disgraceful and demoralizing exhibitions still continue in
the suburbs, but being conducted with the greatest caution and
secrecy, it is difﬁcult to detect the offenders. Several places,
however, have been raided, and the pits and other paraphernalia
pertaining to these brutal orgies have been destroyed.

STREET RAILROADS.

During the past year much attention has been given to the con-
dition of the horses employed on the several street railroads, and
it is fair to assume that owing to the Society’s surveillance a much
better class of animals are now in service. During the winter
months double teams were provided, while in the summer season
water and shelter stations were plentifully distributed along the
routes, whereby relief was at once supplied to the over-heated and
tired animals.

It is to be hoped that the coming year will ﬁnd in the electric
motor, or cable, an effectual substitute for horses as a propelling

power.
STABLES.

The ofﬁcers of the Society have inspected several hundred
stables during the past year, including those of the street rail-
road companies, and of many large contractors. Stables as a rule
are built in very unsuitable places, and upon upper or cellar ﬂOOrs
of buildings, where the chances for animals to escape are almost
hopeless, in case of ﬁre ; for this reason, hundreds of horses are
annually roasted alive.

This great loss of life by ﬁre, and the attendant awful suffering,
might be greatly diminished by constructing buildings, in which
horses are stabled on the upper ﬂoors, of ﬁre-proof materials. In
addition to this, railway stables, in which many hundreds of horses
are conﬁned, should further have partition walls of brick, provided
with iron doors, for the purpose of dividing the interiors into a
number of separate compartments. .

By closing the doors the ﬁre could then be conﬁned to a limited

space for a sufﬁcient time to admit of the release of most of the
animals.

In considering this question, it should be borne in mind that
horses are unable to escape on account of being tied fast in the
stalls, and, even when released, it consumes considerable time to
get them out of a burning building.

GLANDERS AND FARCY.

These contagious and incurable diseases are on the decrease,
owing to the improved sanitary condition of stables, and better
food and attention provided for animals. Several glandered
horses, however, have been found abandoned in the streets by
their unfeeling owners, after discovering the legal risk they
assumed by having them in'their possession ; the poor creatures
were at once humanely destroyed.

THE BROOKLYN AGENCY.

The efﬁciency of the Brooklyn Agency has been materially
increased through the appointment of several additional ofﬁcers
to operate in that vicinity.

A telephone has also lately been placed in that ofﬁce, and direct
communication with these Headquarters established. By this
means, also, the ofﬁcers, while out on patrol duty, receive their
instructions, and. all messages from the police department are
more promptly transmitted.

The following record of work performed by the ofﬁcers attached
to that Agency, under the direction of Superintendent Clark, indi-
cates that the increased expenditure of money in that direction
has been productive of adequate results :—

BRANCHES, ETC.

There are now I4 Branches of this Society in active opera‘
tion, and the total number of its Special Agents throughout the
State is 265.

The terrible sufferings of cattle in the “far West” have for many
years attracted the attention of the executive ofﬁcers of your
Society; but no means have yet been discovered of remedying
this evil. The methods adopted by those engaged in this indus-
try certainly seem open to severe criticism, when it is considered
that domestic animals are placed out upon the western plains with
little or no provision of food or shelter during the winter months,
and thousands consequently die of cold and starvation.

While a comparison of the past with the present condition and
treatment of animals affords satisfaction that so much has been
achieved, we are still frequently reminded that much remains to
be done, not only in the actual prosecution of the work, but also
in shaping public opinion to a higher conception of what we owe
to the brute creation.

W» REPORT OF THE BOARD or MAN-
l. AGERs

At a special meeting of the Board of Managers of this
Society, held at its Headquarters in the city of New York,
Thursday, March 15, 1888, Hon. Thomas C. Acton in the
Chair, Vice-President Gerry announced the decease, on the
12th inst., of the President and Founder of the Society,
HENRY BERGH.

The Board thereupon unanimously directed the follow-
ing record to be made in their minutes of their sorrow for
his loss and respect for his memory :

“ Henry Bergh, the Founder of this Society, was the son
of a well-known citizen of this city. Noted as a boy for his
kindness to the dumb creation, the gentleness of his dis-
position through his entire life exhibited that peculiar vein
of sympathy for the suffering and the helpless which ap-
peared to have been born in him. Educated at Columbia
College, when quite young he married an estimable lady
of this city, and was soon appointed by the President of
the United States to an important diplomatic position as
the representative of this nation at the Russian court.
After traveling over Europe, and thus enlarging his knowl—
edge of mankind by intimate acquaintance with the various
nations of the civilized world, their habits, customs, and
manners, he returned to this country with a resolution to
devote the residue of his life to the amelioration of the
condition of the helpless creation of the Almighty. How,
year after year, with a perseverance which was inexhausti-
ble, a courage which was undaunted, and a conviction of

a

 

right which no temporary obstacle could destroy, he com—
bated with the prejudice, ignorance, and error which he met
with on every side, even in this most civilized community,
has become a matter of history. Firm in his natural sense
of justice, the sufferings to which the brute creation were
hourly subjected under his very eye in this great city seemed
to arouse every vein of sympathy in his nature, and to
stimulate him, notwithstanding occasional defeat, to new
efforts for the protection of those who were unable to pro—
tect themselves. Whether risking his life by invading at the
head of his men a den of assembled dog-ﬁghters ; or whether
standing for hours exposed to the pitiless storm in the mid-
dle of winter, compelling the drivers of vehicles in this
great city to attach sufﬁcient horses in order to relieve the
suffering brutes who were already overloaded; or whether ff
toiling for hours up and down the bleak hill of the capital
of this State, in his tireless efforts to secure, at the hands of r
the Legislature, the passage of those laws which he well
knew would give the desired relief to the dumb creatures u
for whom he so eloquently pleaded ; or whether, day after ‘
day, in wearisome attendance in the courts of justice, sub-
jected too often to the malignant vituperation of the lower
class of lawyers employed by cruelists to enable them to
escape the iron hand of the law ; or whether, in the hours
of long and patient toil, he composed letters to various
institutions throughout the world, urging them to unite
with him in the repression of acts which civilized coun-
tries, to their shame, insisted as regarding as recreations ;
or whether inditing pungent and logical demonstrations of
the fallacies of ‘learned but misguided men,’ as he not
inaptly styled those who, under pretence of advancing
medical science, subjected helpless creatures to needless
pain, suffering, and death——in these and in all these cases
this great philanthropist shone resplendent as a man above
his peers, whom nothing could dismay, whom no pernicious

inﬂuence could corrupt, and whose motives were always so
pure and holy that even the most Vicious and malignant of
his enemies were unable to ﬁnd a ﬂaw or a pretence for
legitimate complaint. Tall and commanding in his ﬁgure,
easy and polished in his conversation, which his long inti-
macy with the diplomats of Europe had enlarged beyond
the ordinary limit of intelligence, shining with a like advan-
tage in the upper circles of society which he adorned, or
in the cultivated audiences which he addressed in behalf
of the speechless objects of his care, or in his pleas in
courts for justice against their determined enemies, he was
in every sense a representative man, one of whom his race
might justly be proud, and standing alone in this nineteenth
century as an illustration of the best type of the American
citizen, an honor to his country, to his name and to his race.

“Now that his earthly life has closed, what a retrospect
does that life present! At the outset of the history of
this great cause of which he was the life-long advocate, only
a handful of men twenty-two years ago uniting to aid him
in his work, and to-day forty-four societies, thirty-three of
which are in the United States, and all in North and South
America, each bearing the emblem of the parent Institution,
which alone has ﬁfteen branches and two hundred and
thirty-one special agents distributed throughout the State
of New York. And when the summary of the work done
in this twenty-two years of over thirteen thousand cases
prosecuted in the courts, of over thirty-ﬁve thousand cases
of disabled animals temporarily suspended from work, and
over twenty-four thousand horses disabled past recovery
humanely destroyed presents in this brief epitome the results
of the labor of love of this one man for the most helpless
of his God’s creation, well may his fellow-men in shedding
their tears for his loss revere with wonder and admira-
tion the efforts of this one individual, which have been
productive of such great and lasting results.

 

 

 




“But mankind owes another debt of gratitude to Henry
Bergh which it never can repay. Deeply recognizing the
claims of the brute creation to his assistance, he never
closed his ear to the cry of the helpless of the children
of men. When an estimable woman in this city had ex—
hausted in vain her appeals to the law, to the local authori-
ties, and to the benevolent for the rescue of a helpless little
child from the merciless cruelty of its custodian, she turned
a last and despairing glance and made a pitiful appeal to
the great friend of the animal creation for aid. His large
and generous heart responded as promptly to the pitiful
prayer for help. ‘I regard,’ said he, ‘ a helpless child in
the same light as the dumb animal. Both are God’s crea—
tures. Neither can protect themselves. My duty is imper-
ative to aid them.’ And then again this extraordinary man
raised his hand in court, aroused the community to the
long-neglected sufferings of helpless childhood, and started
into life an institution for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children, which has been duplicated in every State and
Territory of the Union, forming to-day an enormous net-
work of legal bands for the protection and the assistance
of helpless childhood. This last and crowning act of his
life was all that was needed (if indeed such a life required
any such demonstration) to satisfy those who were disposed
to regard his work as sensational and limited in its charac-
ter, that he was in every sense a protector of the helpless
and a lover of his own race, however much he may have
cared for the lower order of creation.

“And now that he has passed away in the fulness of
years, his memory unimpaired, his intellect clear till the last,
and his name untarnished and lustrous through the course
of a long and busy life consecrated to the noblest work of
charity—the care of the helpless,—-where shall his equal be ,
found who will leave so great a name? When will his like
appear again ?

“ In sorrow and afﬂiction at the loss which not only
this Society, but the civilized world to-day sustains in the
death of Henry Bergh, his friends and colleagues whom he
selected to aid him in his work shed their tears of grief, and
record this imperfect tribute of their affection for his name
and memory.”

The Board of Managers are further pained to record in
their report the death at Wiesbaden, on the 24th day of
March, 1888, of Hon. John T. Hoffman, one of the original
incorporators of your Society, and for many years one of
its Vice-Presidents. Suitable resolutions were adopted, ex—
pressing the afﬂiction of the Board at the loss sustained by
the death of their illustrious colleague, and in recognition
of the important services rendered by him to the cause and
the Society.

 

On the 23d of March last past a meeting of the Board was
convened by Acting-President Gerry, for the purpose of choosing
a successor to the late President.

By unanimous vote of the members present, Mr. Henry Bergh,
a nephew of the deceased, was elected President of the Society ;
and a Committee of three was thereupon appointed by the Chair-
man to request his presence at the meeting.

Mr. Gerry then conveyed to Mr. Bergh the ofﬁcial announce-
ment of his election, and presented him with the badge of ofﬁce.

In the installation address, Mr. Gerry, in substance, referred
to the commendable example set by the late Mr. Bergh, of whose
brilliancy, he said, the jeweled badge he wore was emblematic,
and trusted that his successor would discharge his duties in such
a manner as to reﬂect credit upon himself and the Institution he
represented.

The President brieﬂy replied as follows :

TREASURER’S REPORT.

NEW YORK, January 1, 1889.
To “ T/ze American Society for Me Prevention of Crneszy to

Animals ” :

The Treasurer begs leave to report that, from December 31,
1887, to December 31, 1888, the total amount of cash received,
exclusive of the balance brought forward from the previous year,
was $105,516.62.

The sum expended during that time was $78,880.08, leaving
a cash balance on deposit in the Union Trust Company of
$50,497.42, and in the Petty Cash Drawer of $241.31 ; or a total
of $50,738-73.

This large increase is mainly due to the ﬁnal closing up of the
Estate of the late Carrie J. Welton by the Administrator, who paid
over to the Society the sum of $65,063.60 in cash, and 341 shares
of the capital stock of the Holmes, Booth, & Haydens C0,, as
the Society’s residuary interest in that Estate. Estimating the
value of the aforesaid stock at $25 per share, the total amount
received by the Society from the above-mentioned Estate would
aggregate $73,588.60.

The amount of$12,000 was also received on account of the dis-
tributive share of the Society in the Estate of the late William D.
Fuller.

[n the management of the Society’s ﬁnances the policy of in-
curring no obligations in excess of the income still prevails, and
in its constantly increasing efﬁciency the advantages of such a
course are apparent.

Respectfully submitted,
CHARLES LANIER,
Treasurer

“ Mr. C/zaz’rman amII Gentlemen of 1/36 Boara’ of Managers .-

“ Had I the eloquence of my gifted friend, Mr. Gerry, it would
be difﬁcult for me to describe my feelings on this occasion.

“ The great calamity which has so recently befallen us has tinged
our thoughts with sadness, and we turn our eyes in sorrow to that
vacant chair. My desire to see it occupied by some one who more
ably and satisfactorily than myself would carry on this great work
and push it forward with that ability, zeal, and discretion which
have always characterized its management, to me have been argu~
ments which, I assure you, gentlemen, have received my most
serious and thoughtful consideration.

“I feel it a solemn duty, however, I owe to my beloved uncle’s
memory to respect his dying wishes, and, if called upon, to accept
the great honor you have now conferred upon me.

“ Actuated by such considerations, and recognizing the fact that
I have been chosen through no merit of my own, you can realize
how much more deeply I feel the sacredness of the trust you have
conﬁded to my keeping—the highest that it was in your power to
bestow.

“ In thanking you for your kindness and conﬁdence in me, I beg
to express the hope that aided by your good counsel and judg-
ment and many years of practical experience in the work, I may
be enabled to perform the duties of my ofﬁce in such a manner
as to maintain for our beloved Institution the respect and appro—
bation which it has always commanded in the past.

“ I realize that there is an ample ﬁeld for the exercise of all our
energies in restraining the more positive forms of cruelty ; and
in regard to those questions, involving animal suffering, which
admit of argument, I beg to assure you a conservative policy will
always be pursued by me, till such time as they shall have been
passed upon by the Executive Committee.

“ By such a course, let us hope that the best interests of the
Society will be subserved, and through it may the parting hopes
of its beloved President be fully realized, when he exclaimed,
‘ May God continue to prosper the sacred and civilizing work.’ ”

January 4, 1888.—~—The vacancy in the Executive Committee,

THE DOG-POUND.

The Society’s intercession in behalf of those unfortunate ani—
mals that are condemned to death at the dog-pound in this city
has resulted in an important reform in the means employed for
depriving them of life.

It was considered that drowning—especially during the winter
season—occasioned needless suffering, in view of the fact that
other less painful methods were available.

His Honor Mayor Hewitt is entitled to the thanks of the So—
ciety for the consideration he has given to this subject, and the
disposition he has manifested to adopt some more humane agent
of destruction.

Extensive investigations and experiments have been conducted
during the past year, and it was ﬁnally decided that a lethal
chamber, into which chloroform or gas is introduced, is best cal-
culated to effect that object.

A suitable apparatus has been constructed, and under the an-
aesthetic inﬂuence of chloroform, the unfortunate creatures pass
painlessly away into “ the sleep that knows no waking.”

HOSPITAL FOR ANIMALS.

At a meeting of this Committee held on the 7th of last May,
the amount of thirty-ﬁve thousand dollars was appropriated for
the purpose of establishing a Hospital for Animals in this city.
The difﬁculties encountered in securingasuitable site occasioned
much delay in carrying out that project. Your Society has, how-
ever, lately acquired possession of the premises No. III E. 22d
Street, and the work of erecting the proposed building thereon
will be pushed rapidly to completion.

THE WELTON ESTATE.

The estate of the late Carrie J. Welton has ﬁnally been settled
up by the administrator, and the proceeds of the residuary estate

turned over to your Society.
The total amount realized by the sale of both real and personal

he will continue to lend to the Society the beneﬁt of his assist-
ance and advice as a Vice-President and member of the Executive
Committee.

An attempt was recently made by a number of wealthy people
to introduce into this country the so-called “sport” of rabbit—
baiting, under the impression that through their inﬂuence such
cruel and demoralizing exhibitions could be made popular and
respectable. Though acquitted by a local jury, they have not
been so successful before the bar of public opinion, and. perhaps
they begin to realize that, here in America, such acts are re-
garded with contempt and abhorrence by respectable and law-
abiding people.

The ofﬁcers of your Society had a well-established precedent
for their action on this question in the case of the People 715.
Edward Burt, convicted for a similar offence, known as “rat-
baiting,” and sentenced, at the Court of Special Sessions of this
city, to serve a term of three months’ imprisonment in the
penitentiary. ' 7

The three learned Judges who pronounced that decision and
sentence did not regard his act as the legitimate destruction of
noxious animals; but saw in it. only a low and cruel exhibition,
created merely for the entertainment of the spectators.

It seems hardly necessary for me to deny the silly statements
which have lately been made, that we desire to interfere with
any proper or manly sport, or to prevent the capture of game,
or the extermination of noxious or destructive animals by means
of guns, dogs, traps, or other paraphernalia of the hunter’s
outﬁt.

We should, however, regard it as a monstrous wrong to utilize
some of those methods for the killing of animals when in
captivity; for, under such conditions, justice and humanity de-
mand that the creature shall be destroyed in the most merciful
manner available.

The hunter places a trap, armed with powerful springs and
sharp steel fangs, near the haunts of the bear he wishes to
secure. Surely this would be no justiﬁcation for placing a
captive animal in an arena, where such an instrument of torture
