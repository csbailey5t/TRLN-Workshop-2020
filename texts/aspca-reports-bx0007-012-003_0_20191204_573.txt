1876.

HEADQUARTERS OF THE SOCIETY,
Con. FOURTH AVENUE AND TWENTY-SECOND STREET,
NEW YORK, February 21st, 1876.

The Annual General Meeting of the Society'tvas held
this day at its Headquarters, Henry Bergh, Esq., occu—
pying the chair. Having called the meeting to order,
the President remarked : I

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,——-

The ﬁrst decade of your Institution, devoted to the
protection of those speechless servants of mankind,
which minister in so many ways to their happiness and
proﬁt, has been attained. Ten years of patient and
unremitting labor, have produced the inevitable results,
associated with purity of motive and ﬁdelity of execu-
tion. The bronze emblem afﬁxed to the external
walls of your ofﬁcial residence, and which typiﬁes so

feelingly the merciful and civilizing cause in which you
are engaged, has been accepted and adopted by thirty-
seven Societies in your country and in Canada, and by
the Tuiin Society 1n Ita.ly

But far better than this, the spirit, the example, and
the purpose which it illust1ates, are in practical accord
within them. If the sentiment of pride is ever pardon-
able, it would seem to be so, on this occasion, while we ‘
are r.viewing the record of our ﬁrst decennial. From
a feeble and contemned moral stripling, our Society has
grown into athletic manhood, under the patronage of
the public, and the fostering legislation of the State.

Where now are the scenes and the actors therein,
that once shocked the tender-hearted of both sexes
in the streets, and alarmed the thoughtful student of
national piogress. 9

They are faded out of sight, and their authors have
retired in shame and dismay at the triumphant
approach of that banner, upon which you have inscribed
“Justice, Humanity, Compassion.”

It is the favorite argument of our opponents as well
as of others who reach conclusions without consider-
ation, that we manifest “ too much zeal!” As well
may the men who promptly extinguish the ﬂames of a
burning ediﬁce be thus rebuked; for without much
exaggeration of the ideal, the vice which corrodes the
moral structure of society, while it is far more imminent
and fatal, requires sometimes the exercise of a zealous
daring, which seems to chide the rigid formalities of
statutory allowance. In time of peace as well as war,
the element of enthusiasm is material to success; and -
while the letter of the law should be always paramount,
its spirit ought also to be taken into account.

Perhaps no public service admits of so great latitude,
as that of preventing cruelty in every form. There are

 




 

7

persons who absurdly claim, that no one should be
arrested until a warrant be ﬁrst procured. In other
words, a person is seen beating the brains out of a horse
in the street—if this requirement be followed out—you
approach the offender and politely request him to desist,
and to remain where he is until you can ﬁnd a magis-
trate, and procure the necessary document. As those
ofﬁcials sit at brief and irregular intervals, you might
consume from three to twenty—four hours in obtaining it,
so that when you return, the obliging malefactor, sup-
posing, perhaps, that you did not intend coming back
for him, discreetly retires, and when you do come to look
for him, the only evidence of the transaction is the
carcass of the dead animal! Now, if such a policy be
applicable in the case supposed, there is no reason
why it should not be employed in burglaries and all
other crimes; and how long, through its operation, it
would require to restore human society to its primitive
elements, is not difﬁcult of solution. It is sufﬁcient to
say that legislation repudiates such an absurdity.

The accompanying Report of the Secretary simpliﬁes
the cemmunication of the President; but there are a
few points which he deems it proper to make Special
reference to.

The Executive Committee, believing in the impor-
tance of having the moral, as well as material progress
of the nation, represented at the approaching Centen-
nial ; have referred the entire matter of our represen-
tation there, to the President with power. I have
accordingly taken the initiatory steps to that end. It is
very generally conceded, that the history of our country,
furnishes no parallel, to the extent and rapidity- of the
, acceptance, and development, of this great and civilizing
idea of mercy and protection to the lower animals, the
consequences of which, leave the mind in doubt, whether

 




 

 

 

 

 

8

mankind are not the greatest gainers by its adoption.
Certain is it, that no State can be considered safe, where
the sentiment of mercy towards the humblest living
creature is wanting.

The leading position which your Society occupies in
the estimation of kindred institutions abroad is noticable
in their correspondence with it, as well as by other
evidences of a more pronounced character, such, for
example, as the adoption by the societies of Italy of the
emblem, which we and other American societies employ.

Among the many beneﬁcial results anticipated by
the creation of this institution, it was certainly not
foreseen, that it would become the instrument of calling
into being yet another, to be known as the “ Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.” And yet,
through the occult destiny thereof, it has been an agent
in that sublime work. As it to, rebuke the charge
made against your Society, that it ignored the sufferings
of the human family, in its protection of the inferior
animals, the well known, and providential case of
“Little Mary Ellen” may be cited. It is undeniable
that her case, which so exercised the public sympathies
at the time, by reason of its atrocity, was the nucleus of
the admirable organization, which now exists for the
protection of young children, from the cruelty of their
parents and custodians. And in connection with this
subject, I regard it as my duty, however distasteful it
may be to Mr. Elbridge T. Gerry, to declare, that to his
professional ability, zeal and feeling, more than to all
others associated. therewith, is that great and good work
indebted, for its present ofﬁcial and permanent being.

The chairman then called on the Acting Secretary
to read the reports of the Secretary, Treasurer, and
Executive Committee.

 




 

13

but the Grand Jury,. after hearing only 25200, closed
the case, and failed to indict. The President addressed
a communication to the foreman, expressing his regret
that all the evidence on behalf of the People had not
been heard. Taking offense at this, the Jury made a
presentment before Recorder Hackett, charging the
President with contempt of Court. Our counsel, Mr.
Gerry, with his usual ability, defended the case, and his
Honor decided that Mr. Bergh was not in contempt.
The same witnesses having been heard before a subse-
quent Grand Jury, Carpenter was promptly indicted!
He was ﬁnally put on his defense in the Court of Gen—
eral Sessions, and pleading guilty was ﬁned $250.
Subsequently one of his confederates was also tried for
participating in the same ﬁght, and. was convicted and
ﬁned. '

The Courts also ruled in favor of the Society in the
Cider Press case; and also that of the Hog Slaughterers.

REI’EAL OF THE DOG LAW.

During the past summer there was no Dog law, and
the citizens were spared the frightful scenes of blood
shed and cruelty enacted during the previous summer.
It is worthy of note that, although the dogs were free
and unmuzzled, hydrophobia no longer disturbed the
minds or persons of our citizens.

PROSECUTIONS AND WORK.

During the year 1875 the Society prosecuted 863 cases
of cruelty as follows:

ed by the harness ............................ 228

inary surgeons, 1,272 horses and mules, for the follow-
ing causes; the drivers were not arrested, but cautioned 2

The agents were also called upon to destroy 2,164
animals, as follows:

Suffering from lockjaw' ......................... 28

Dogs, goats, cats, cows, sheep and other animals, 1,000

Total .......... .. 2,164

The most efﬁcient and merciful means for the des
truction of animals unﬁt for further use, are found in
the explosive bullets, and hydrocyanic acid, now em-
ployed by the Society’s ofﬁcers.

The ambulances of the Society removed from the
streets 176 disabled horses. The ofﬁcers investigated
more than 1,200 complaints made by citizens, and the
evils complained of were remedied without arrests.
Twenty-three old horses were rescued from starvation,
having been abandoned in their stables or sheds by their
owners. Several valuable horses were rescued from
sewers, excavations, etc., into Which they had fallen.
Many contemplated dog and cock ﬁghts were interrupt-
ed,.and a number of birds and bull-dogs seized.

Several turkey and chicken shoots were broken up.
The cow stables and slaughter houses in this city and
Brooklyn also received attention, and the proprietors
compelled to keep them in cleaner condition. Agents
were sent from New York to Saratoga during the sea-

son, and along the canals and other places with excel-
lent results.

BRANCHES OF THE PARENT SOCIETY.

The Society has now 13 Branches in the State of New
York in active working order, viz: Albany, Brooklyn,
Buffalo (2), Fishkill, Flushing (2), Delhi, Nyack, Pough—
keepsie, Rochester, Riverhead, and Sing Sing. Some
of these auxiliary societies are managed and supported
almost exclusively by benevolent lady residents. The
Parent Society has also 141 special agents located in
various parts of the State, in addition to the regular
force attached to its Headquarters.

LECTURES.

The President has visited" the following places and
delivered lectures or assisted at public meetings and
anniversaries: Hart-ford, Conn“ Philadelphia, Newark,
Morristown, N. J., Delhi, Nyack, Newport, &c. Invita-
tionsfrom Georgia, Canada, Pittsburgh, Rochester, and
elsewhere, have necessarily been declined by him on
account of distance and ofﬁcial engagements.

KENDRED SOCIETIES OF AMERICA.

The societies of the United States and of Canada, now
numbering thirty~seven, are generally in a ﬂourishing
condition, under the guidance of the humane and intelli-
gent ladies and gentlemen who respectfully direct them.
Many of them have Branches, Auxiliary Societies, and
Agents in different parts of their respective States.

Believing that it will prove an interesting feature of
this Report to indicate them, they are herewith sub—

RESCUE 0F DISABLED ANIMALS.

The necessity of providing some effective means for
rescuing horses and other animals from drowning, and
from sewers, excavations. etc., has for some time been
under the consideration of the Society. Frequently the
ofﬁcers are called upon to save some valuable horse
whose life, by accident, or the neglect of those in charge,
has become jeopardized. During the past six. months
the lives of seven horses have been saved; but owing
to the lack of more effective means, several other ﬁne
animals were destroyed. Our illustration represents a
tripod derrick, harness, slings, etc., Which the President
has had constructed for use in such emergencies. It has
been found to admirably answer the purpose for Which
it was designed.

Persons needing its use should apply at the Head:
quarters of the Society.

INJURY T0 ANIMALS.

The pernicious practice of salting the streets, and
throwing nails, glass, and other dangerous substances upon

the public highways, resulted last year, alone, in fatally I

injuring 205 animals. The Society consequently deter—
mined to renew its effort to obtain legislative means to
remedy the evil, and during the present session our Couns-
sel, Mr. Gerry, proceeded to Albany with a Bill for that
purpose. He met with much opposition, and strenuous
efforts were made at every step to defeat the measure ; but
thanks to the numerous friends of the Society in both
Houses, the Bill was eventually passed in the Senate by
a vote of 21 to 3, and in the House of 84 to 18. It is
needless to add that it was approved by Governor
Tilden. As enacted it reads as follows : '

LAWS on 1876, CHAPTER 16.,

. AN ACT

TO PREVENT INJURY T0 ANIMALS IN THE CITY on NEW YORK,
Passed, February 8, 1876, tit/recvﬁfths being present.

The People of the State of New York, represented in Senate and
Assembly, do enact as follows: »

SECTION 1. EVery person who shall willfully throw, expose, or
place, or who shall willfully cause, or procure to be thrown, exposed
or plaCed, in or upon any street, highway, or public place in the City
of New York, open for the passage of animals, any nails, pieces of
metal, glass,or other substance, or thing which might maim, wound,
lame, cut or otherwise injure any animal shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor.

§ ‘3. Every person who shall throw, expose or place, or Who shall
cause or procure to be thrown, exposed or placed in or upon any
such street, highway or public place, except upon the curves,
crossings or switches of railroad tracks, any salt, saltpetre or other
substance for the purpose of dissolving any snow or ice which may
have fallen or been deposited thereon, shall be guilty of a mis-
demeanor.

§8. This act shall take effect at the expiration of ten days after
its passage.

TRANSPORTATION 0P CATTLE.

The Act “To Prevent Cruelty to Animals'while in
Transit by Railroad or other means of Transportation
within the United States,” passed by Congress, March 3,
1878, being found unsatisfactory; a meeting was con-
vened at the residence of Mr. Thomas T. Kinney, Presi-
dent of the New Jersey Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals, at Newark, on the 22d November
last, to consider this important subject, with the Hon.
F. T. Frelinghuysen, United States Senator. Several
gentlemen, delegates from kindred societies in different
States attended. Our President and Mr. E. T. Gerry
responded to the call, and the latter gentleman prepared
a new Bill which was approved by the meeting, andSen-
ator Frelinghuysen promised his hearty support of the
same in the Senate.

This Bill was presented by the Senator on the 13th
Dec, and passed the Senate by a vote of 30 ayes to 24:
noes, Feb. 11, 1876.

 

 

 

 




 

 

TREASURER’S REPOR ‘.

The Treasurer reports the income of the Society, from all sources, from the 1st January, to the 31st
December, 1875, including the balances brought forward from the previous year, as $22,535.?) , and the
expenditure during the same period as $20,649.93, leaving a balance of $1,818.80 in the Union Trust

The Executive Committee of the American Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in presenting
their report for the past year, have again to congratu-
late the friends of the cause on the steady progress
which has been made, and on the important and
inﬂuential position the Society has attaii'ied. As the
Secretary’s report gives a comprehensive account of the
real work of the Society and its ofﬁcers, the Cormnittee
conﬁne themselves to the matters which have come
more immediately under their jurisdiction.

The Committee report the adoption by the Society,
at a meeting held at its Headquarters on the 5th May,
1875, of a new Code of By-laws.

Also, the lamented death of Mr. \Villiam H. Aspinwall,
a Vice-president and warm friend of the Society.

Also, the election of Hon. Elbridge T. Gerry to the
vacant Vice-presidency. ,

Also, the resignation of Mr. Alfred Schermerhorn
and Mr. Alex. Van Rensselaer, members of the Execu=
tive Committee, and the election of Mr. Frederick
Gallatin as a member of that body.

Also, the resignation of Mr. Henry Clews, and the
election of Mr. Charles Lanier, as Treasurer of the
Society.

Ordered and adopted a design of a new badge for the
ofﬁcers of the Society to be prepared by Messrs.
Tiffany & Co.

Voted a Gold Badge of the Society, to be presented
to the Hon. Elbridge T. Gerry, in appreciation of his
valuable professional and humane services in the cause.
The following acknowledgment was received from him
and ordered on ﬁle:

LAKE DELAWARE, N. Y.,
_ July 2, 1875.
DEAR Ma. BERGH:

I am in receipt of the superb badge which you so
kindly forwarded me. As a work of art it is simply exquisite. As
emblematic of the cause it so beautifully typiﬁes, it is to me a
decoration of priceless value. The pains you have taken in its
design and execution render its possession doubly dear to me. None
equal yourself in taste and none surpass you in originality of design
or elegance in execution. Should our Executive Committee meet
during my absence, I trust you will convey to them my sincere
appreciation of the gift and that you will assure them how I appre-
ciate most deeply a decoration and badge which, like the Cross of
the Legion of Honor of the Great Emperor, no money could buy, and
the privilege of wearing which was in itself the patent of nobility.

But I pray earnestly that the time may be far—yes, wry far dis-
tant when any one other than yourself will be called to preside over
our beloved Institution as its chief executive ofﬁcer. None who
belong to it and love sincerely and unselﬁshly the cause which it
embodies——the ceaseless plea for mercy to the helpless brute——can
look to any but yourself as the embodiment of that cause and the
advocate of that plea in human form. And if there be more than
one' who is glad to assist in the work with the talents which
AlmightyGod in His wisdom and as His instrument in the protec-
tion of the humbler works of His creation, has bestowed upon him,
believe me, the consecration of those talents to the truly grand and
noble work of helping the helpless is in no small degree owing to
the inspiration derived from the example set by yourself as the
originator of the system for protecting, in this country, the animal
creation from the cruelty of thoughtless and brutal men. Noble
and unﬂinching as you have ever been, my dear friend, in your
advocacy of this great cause, it is only when those whose privilege
it is to work under your direction and to do what little you leave to
supplement your efforts, are brought in contact with you personally,
that they can best learn how light their labors are when compared
with your own, and how small and insignificant their efforts are,
hoWever well intended when compared with the life-long devotion

you have shown to a cause insigniﬁcant to the unthinking, but pro-
ductive ot' unnumbered beneﬁts to the community in which you live,
and to the nation to which you belong, and to society which you
adorn. ‘

I have long desired to say this without rendering myself open
to an imputation of ﬂattery, and hence I have availed myself of this
present. occasion,when I am made the recipient of a high and un-
usual mark of confidence from the Society which it has been, and I
trust ever will be, my privilege to labor in with the little ability I
possess.

Sincerely yours,
ELBRIDGE ’I‘. GERRY.

The thanks of the Society were voted to Mr. Frank
Leslie for his generous and valuable assistance rendered
to it, through the medium. of his Illustrated Newspapers
and the presentation of Electros.

Voted the sum of $2,500 to the St.Vincent Hospital,
accompanied by the following Resolution, forwarded to
Mr. J. E. Devlin, the counsel to that Institution:

“ lV/zm'ms, the late Louis Bonard, during his last illness in St.
Vincent‘s IIoSpital, (lid request that some suitable pecuniary donation
should be giVen after his decease, to that Institution, in acknowledg-
ment of the kindness which had been extended to him,

A 21(lli’7mrcr/s, this Society is desirous of complying with the Wishes
of its deceased benefactor, therefore,

Resolved, that the sum of two thousand ﬁve hundred dollars be
donated to the St.Vincent’s Hospital in accordance therewith.”

The thanks of the Society were also voted to the Rev.
Edwin l3. Russell, for the admirable discourse delivered
by him, on “Protection to Ai’iimz-ils,” in St. John’s
Church, Delhi, New York, 15th August, 1875. The
reverend gentleman took for his text: “For all the
beasts of the forest are Mine, and so are the cattle upon
a thousand hills. I know all the 'i‘owls upon the moun-
tains, and the wild beasts of the ﬁeld are in My sight.”
—-—PSALM 50 : 11.

gerrrtary’s géspurt.

 

The Secretary presents the following Report of the
general work of the Society, its Branches, and Agents
for the past year:

LEGISLATION.

The Society presented before the Legislature of
1875, the following Bills :

1. An Act for the better enforcement of certain
Penal Laws.

2. An Act for the Prevention of Disease among
Animals.

3. An Act to prevent Injury to Animals in New
York.

4. An Act providing for the Forfeiture of Property
in certain cases.

Sufﬁcient opposition was brought to bear against
these much-needed reforms, to defeat their passage,
with exception of the last mentioned, which became a
law.

PIGEON SLAUGHTER.

“ An Act in relation to the Treatment of Animals”
was presented, in the interest of Pigeon shooting, and
was passed. The Society and its friends opposed it,
but‘without avail. While this cruel pastime is gradually

falling into disfavor in many parts of Europe, and is
condemned by all high-minded people, including
honorable sportsmen here at home; it is a deplorable
faCt, that the Legislature of this State, should’have
legalized it. While the practice is cruel and unmanly
in itself, it openly sets at deﬁance, the laws made. against
betting and gambling, and which latter, it is believed
forms its principal attraction. The following is an
extract from a London Newspaper:

“Our pigeon shooters pursue a sport no longer patronized by
English Royalty. The Prince of Wales and all the Princes of the
royal family have withdrawn from the Hurlingham Club, and pigeon
shooting is to be henceforth tabooed in the British Army. Some
Aldershot ofﬁcers who lately engaged in pigeon shooting matches
are severely rebuked. A leading ofﬁcer Writes to a London paper:
‘ Ofﬁcers in the army, of all people in the world, ought not to patron-
ize so debased an amusement—if amusement it can be called——
especially after the very praiseworthy conduct of the heir to the
throne.”

Learning that the proprietor of the New Yoﬂc
flerald was about to promote a Pigeon Shooting Match,
the President addressed the following letter to Mr.
Bennett:

THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR THE PREVENTION ? ‘
OF CRUELTY TO ANIMALS, FOURTH AVENUE, Con. 221) STREET, -
_NEW YORK, September 30, 1875. S

James Gordon Bennett, Esq:

Sir: The relation you bear to the public, as proprietor of a
widely circulating journal, is the excuse I have for intruding
myself on your notice. As such, I am sure that you will agree with
me that your moral responsibility surpasses that of ordinary men.
Through the columns of your paper, as well as by the personal
example which you exhibit to the world as its representative, you
largely inﬂuence public sentiment and shape the action, for good or
evil, of old and young. Whether you do this in the interest of your
country’s moral and material progress, when you sanction and
promote by your pesition, wealth and active participation, the

 




 

11

" useless slaughter and mutilation of innocent animals, is the purpose
of this communication. I assume that you will not deny the postu-
late, that all living creatures are endowed with the right to live, so
long as they do not, by reason of their acts or hurtful presence,
forfeit that right. To do otherwise would be to question Divine
wisdom and authority. Now let us suppose a case. It is that ofa
bird, which has already been captured by your artiﬁce or skill. It
is not only harmless, but by reason of its beauty, innocence and
helplessness, appeals most touchingly to your pity, justice and
humanity. You are a practical marksman, and you require, perhaps,
recreation, or demand relief from wasting ennui. The arms which
minister to your passion for the chase, are of the richest and most
approved quality; the day is ﬁne, and the ﬁelds and groves are
melodious with the songs of happy feathered creatures. Suddenly,
you experience the strange desire to kill; to (destroy the hapless
being in your power, and disﬁgure the scene which lieslike a dream
of Paradise before you.

You are not alone—friends and admirers of your accuracy of
aim are with you, and among them—horribly out of place—fair
women are also seen! Your servants place the unresisting animal in
a trap, and the life which God gave for the proﬁt and support of our
race, awaits its unrequired sacriﬁce.

Now let us imagine for a moment, that this unoﬁ'ending little
being is suddenly endowed with speech. Might not its language be
somewhat like the following?

“ I am wholly in your power; you will not pretend that I have
ever harmed you, or that there exists any natural or legitimate reason
for my destruction. The sphere in which I moved was assigned to
me by the same Allwise Being who made you, and so bountifully
endowed you with wealth, reason, and all the material possessions of
this world. I was betrayed into captivity While seeking to provide
nourishment for my little family, now dead of starvation.

“ You are about to immolate me upon the blood-stained altar of
inglorious rivalry, and what will you gain by the crashing of my
delicate limbs, and ruptured arteries, that a senseless target would
not afford you? If, however this little body, so cunningly and so
mysteriously contrived by its Creator, be necessary to your reason-
able beneﬁt—if the brief existence which it inherits, be required for
any purpose which religion and human policy condemn not—take it,
it is yours; but offend not its author, nor insult the cultivated spirit
of your generation, by a deed which your own conscience on reﬂec-
tion, will characterize, but which I refrain from doing.”

Thus,.l say, might the unoﬂ‘ending little creature address you,
and what answer could you make? None, absolutely none ; nor could '
the combined intellect and learning of the world, controvert the
argument of the tiny pleader awaiting your irresistable ﬁat.

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

12

If you have favored me with your attention thus far, permit me
to claim your indulgence for a moment longer. Believing, perhaps,
in the harmlessness of your views touching the subject, to which I
have ventured to invite your consideration; I learn that you have
drawn from your abundant resources, the tempting offer of $10,000,
to him who will kill or disable the greatest number of pigeons on a
certain day. To me there is always something indiscribably sorrow-
ful in the word “kill.” I lay claim to no exceptional delicacy or
humanity, but thatlittle word seems to me, to embrace within its
single syllable, a more startling and portentous meaning, than all the
rest in our language. That the taking of life is an acquired neces-
sity of our civilization, I regretfully admit ; all I urge is, that it be
rendered asjust and merciful as it is necessary. In a recent narra-
tive of a pigeon match, which appeared in the [larch], the word “kill”
I-found was repeated one hundred times! I beg that you will not
regard me as either disrespectful or censorious, for I mean neither.
I believe that patriotism, and morality, require of every citizen, the
exercise of his powers to advance the general prosperity of his
country; and to no other, in my opinion has been confided in so great
a degree, the elements of so doing as to yourself. To the famous
journal founded by the wisdom and sagacity of your late father
millions of people look annually for precept, example and advice,
and when they read in your fair columns, your sanction of betting,
and unnecessary mutilation and killing of unoﬁ'ending animals, can
you consistently rebuke the demorilization of’ the age in which you
live, and exercise so commanding an inﬂuence?

I am your obedient servant,

HENRY BERGH, PRESIDENT.

Mr. Bennett replied to the foregoing communication,
stating that although he entirely dissented from the
views therein expressed, he would have been pleased to
have published the letter in the Herald had it not been
for its personality to himself. 0

LE GAL DECISIONS.

During the February term of the Grand Jury,
among the cases presented by the Society, was that of
Jeff Carpenter, for permitting dog ﬁghting on his
premises. There were nine witnesses 'for the People;

SPREAD OF THE WORK.

Since the publication of the last Report, laws for the
prevention of cruelty to animals have been entered upon
the Statute Books of Nebraska, Georgia and Wisconsin.
The Legislature of South Carolina has similar enact—
ments now under consideration. City ordinances have
been passed, by the authorities of Richmond,Virginia,
and communications asking for information and docu—
ments have also been received from New Mexico, Iowa,
Florida, Tennessee, Kansas, Rome and Tuiin, Italy,
Singapore, Lisbon, the Hague, and South America.

The following interesting letter was received from the
Turin Society. At the head of the communication ap-
pears a beautifully engraved copy of the Emblem of the
American Societies for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals. Around the emblem is engraved “Societé
Torinese Protettrice Degli Animali.”

. CORINA, 7th April, 1875.

Resolved, That this Society, in accepting the elegant
and costly banner which the taste and generosity of Mrs.
John P. Haines, and her associate ladies, have this day
made it the recipient of, is honored and encouraged by
this delicate appreciation of its labors in the defense of
the brute creation ; and that it hereby tenders to her and
to them individually its most profound and grateful
acknowledgments. ,

Society, held May 5, 1875, be read through at this
meeting, for the informatiOn of the Members of the
Society and their approval.
