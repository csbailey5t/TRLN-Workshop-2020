According to the law, the Society collects the
dog license fee to pay for these services.
However, the license fees collected last year
totalled $792,419—$253,061 short of pay-
ing the shelter expenses.

Memberships, contributions and bequests
must pay for this deﬁcit plus our other ser-
vices not required of us by law. These ser-
vices include humane education, inspections,
legislative activities, investigations of reported
cruelty, prosecutions, rescues, literature,
horse watering, adoptions'and care of char-
ity cases in the hospital.

The net deﬁcit last year was $137,269.

BEQUESTS AND TRUST FUNDS

Money or property may be bequeathed to
the Society in a will. Such funds are used
for the general purposes of our work. Or
trust funds may be set up specifying how the
principal or income may be used.

MEMORIAL ENDOWMENTS

Many friends endow cages in our hospital
or shelters in memory of relatives or pets.
The income is used to pay for the mainte-
nance of the cage, and a plaque bearing the
name of the donor is placed on the cage. Dog
cages are $250, cat cages are $150. Memorial
plaques are also placed on endowed pieces of
equipment in the hospital.

CONTRIBUTIONS
AND MEMBERSHIPS

Contributors who prefer to support one of
our services may give to our Horse Care
Fund, Hospital Fund, Adoption Fund or Gen-
eral Fund (which pays for inspections, in-
vestigations, humane education, rescues).
Memberships are used for the general pur-
poses of the Society. Contributions are tax
deductible. Gifts of securities and property
are welcome.

maining horses include police horses, riding
academy horses, a half hundred which still
haul junk and vegetable wagons, and the
hansom cab horses which drive sightseers
around Central Park.

ASPCA men know every horse in the City
by name and inspect them weekly. We oper-
ate two horse ambulances to transport in-
jured or inﬁrm horses to our hospital, where
there is a special horse stall. If an owner
requests, we will destroy his horse humanely.
During the summer two trucks dispense cool
water to hot, thirsty horses throughout the
City.

But today we also regularly inspect poul-
try markets, kennels, zoos, pet shops, slaughter
houses, stockyards, and laboratories requisi-
tioning animals from the Society.

Our staff of eleven special agents, who
wear uniforms like those of the New York
Police force, also watch for cruelty at all spe-
cial events involving animals. They attend
every performance and rehearsal of circuses
and rodeos in New York City, and every
recognized horse show in New York State
within a 65-mile radius of Manhattan. We
also check race tracks in and around New

York City.

On one patrol of Brooklyn bridle paths
our Special Agents found four horses with
open saddle sores. The, stable owner, given
four summonses, pleaded guilty in court and
was ﬁned $10 on each charge. Of course the
horses were suspended from labor and
checked regularly until the sores healed.

Daily inspections were made at Freedom-
land amusement park where special checks
were kept on a new side show consisting of
stunt riding with horses. -

Last year we made 8,340 inspections, in

which 2,390,441 animals were checked.

Since the ASPCA is empowered to enforce
anti-cruelty laws within the whole State of
New York, we maintain sixteen special agents

to save a. life...

Brandy was a happy dog — frisky, playful,
full of love and life.

He’s dead now—dead of cancer at the
age of ﬁve. His owners still feel the loss, but
they’re happy in the knowledge that Brandy
—— even in death — is helping to save future
generations of pets.

For the family allowed the ASPCA Hospi-
tal to perform a necropsy (post mortem ex-
amination). This helped to conﬁrm the clin-
ical diagnosis and to analyze what went
wrong in Brandy’s cancer-riddled body.

The results of the necropsy were correlated
with other studies. In this way the ASPCA
Hospital joins with the medical profession in
a joint search for the cause and eventually
the cure for cancer —— a disease which strikes
animals and humans alike.

Brandy’s story is being repeated many
times at the ASPCA Hospital, where a
$50,000 expansion program will include an
enlarged Pathology Laboratory for extensive
analysis, including tissue pathology.

Precision instruments are needed for this
work. You can help by contributing funds
for one of these vital machines. A plaque
commemorating your pet or a relative will
be placed on the instrument.

“-\._

A FEW OF THE NEEDED INSTRUMENTS
Autotechnicon $1,325
This machine takes the water out of a

piece of tissue so it can be imbedded in wax
for easy analysis.

Paraﬁi n Oven $210

Keeps the wax at a constant temperature
to prevent melting or burning.

Precision Rotary Microtome $740

Slices tissue so ﬁne it is transparent
enough for miscroscopic examination. It is
so accurate tissue can be sliced as thin as
ﬁve thousandths of an inch.

Tissuemat-Water Bath $65

If you have ever made thin slices of wax
you know it curls and wrinkles as you cut
it. The water bath removes these wrinkles
and distortions.

Laboratory Counter $88.50

In examination of a blood smear, the pro-
portion of red and white blood cells is ex-
tremely important. This instrument helps
count the cells and gives the total as well
as differential count.

Other equipment ranging in price from
$65 to $2500 is also needed. A complete list

will be sent on request.

 

 




 

 

months old, but there is no maximum age.
All dogs must be licensed.

In the beginners class the dog learns to
walk at the owner’s side, lie down, come on
call, stay, stand on command and jump over
a stick. In the advanced class the dog learns
to do all this off leash, plus carrying, re-
trieving and jumping over hurdles. Speciﬁc
problems are not dealt with individually, but
obedience training helps give an owner better
over-all control of his dog.

The eight-week courses begin in winter,
spring and fall. The fee is $18 for owner
and dog. Visitors may attend for $3 a course,
single ticket $1. Children are welcome as Vis-
itors, but they are seldom qualiﬁed to take
the course, except with the instructor’s spe-
cial permission.

The
Metcalf—Hatch Law

On July 1, 1952, the Metcalf—Hatch Law

went into effect in New York State, permit-

ting laboratories and hospitals approved by
the State Commissioner of Health, or if in

New York City by the City Commissioner of

Health, to requisition animals for experi-

mental purposes from public pounds and

private humane organizations to which pub-
lic authority has been delegated by statute
or contract.

The ASPCA falls under the provisions of
the law because:

1. Its authority to operate is granted by the
New York State Legislature.

2. It is empowered by the New York State
Legislature to issue dog licenses and carry
out the obligations imposed in the dog li-
cense law in New York City.

Challenged in the courts, the constitution-
ality of the law was upheld by the Court of

Appeals on July 14, 1954.

40

ANIMALS SUBJECT
TO REQUISITION

Animals subject to requisition must be un-
licensed, unwanted or unclaimed, unless the
owner of a licensed dog or other animal offers
it in writing for experimentation.

Under a previous law public pounds and
humane organizations were required to hold
any unlicensed, unwanted or unclaimed ani-
mal for 48 hours. Under the Metcalf—Hatch
Law, each animal must be held for an addi-
tional three days, during which the animal
may be reclaimed by its owner or adopted.

If the animal is then allocated to a labor-
atory or hospital, the humane organization or
pound is reimbursed a reasonable amount
for the animal’s maintenance during the
extra three-day waiting period. In the case
of the ASPCA, the New York City Commis-
sioner of Health has established as a reason-
able amount 66%¢ a day for a cat and $1.50
a day for a dog. Both amounts are consid-
erably lower than the average kennel board-
ing rates.

Last year 16 hospitals and laboratories
requisitioned 1,973 animals from the ASPCA.
This is less than one percent of all the ani-
mals we handled.

RESEARCH PROTECTED
SINCE 1867

There is a misconception that the Metcalf-
Hatch Law authorizes experimentation. The
fact is scientiﬁc research has been protected
in New York State since 1866, when the
ﬁrst anti-cruelty law was passed. The en-
forcement of that law, and every anti-cruelty
law passed in New York State since, has
been limited by the following paragraph:

Nothing herein contained shall be construed to

prohibit or interfere with any properly con-

ducted scientiﬁc tests, experiments or investiga-
tions, involving the use of living animals, per-
formed or conducted in laboratories or institu-
tions, which are approved for these purposes by

the State Commissioner of Health. (Sec. 185,

New York State Penal Law)

But the Metcalf—Hatch Law does include
this provision:

All animals shall be kindly and humanely

 

 




 

 

Painless cooking of crabs

A painless method of cooking crabs and
lobsters in lukewarm water instead of by
scalding is described in an article in a recent
issue of Science magazine.

Written by Gordon Gunter of the Texas
Game and Fish Commission, the article
maintains that crustaceans do feel pain and
that the accepted method of scalding is un-
necessary torture.

Because a live crustacean is the only ac-
cepted guarantee of an unspoiled one, these
animals are killed at the time of cooking.
The prevalent custom at home is to scald
them to death in boiling water.

Mr. Gunter’s painless method is based on
his claim that most aquatic organisms can
withstand very little heat and that only luke-
warm fresh water is needed to kill them.

He suggests this procedure: Place a low
ﬂame under the pot which slowly raises the
temperature to about 40 degrees C. The crab
will die quickly and easily at this tempera-

ture without showing distress. As soon as the
crustacean is dead, the heat can be turned
up and the water boiled quickly.

by our Volunteer Committees in Manhattan,
Westchester and Long Island.

In Manhattan the events include the Ani-
mal Kingdom Ball and the Ark, a shop in
which we sell quality items like silver, glass
and jewelry donated by members and friends.
The shop operates for one week early in
December in a store donated for the pur-
pose. Donated merchandise is tax deductible.

The Westchester Committee raises funds
at a tea-dance known as Hi~Jinx for Animals.
In Long Island funds come from a tea-dance
called Carnival for Animals and an annual
Advertisers Almanac. The Almanac, paid for
by advertisements from Nassau and Suffolk
merchants, contains a section on practical
facts about the Island, plus household hints,
ﬁshing and gardening guides, postal rates,
and other helpful information.

The Society’s Horse Care Fund reaps pro-
ceeds from the sale of as many tickets as we
can dispose of for one night of the National
Horse Show at Madison Square Garden.

Public
relations

The basic objective behind ASPCA’s public
relations program is to interpret our policies
for members, contributors and the general
public, and to help revise these policies to
fit new and constantly changing needs.
Public relations is not a mask to cover up
weakness, but a loudspeaker to broadcast our
strength and our belief in what we are doing

and how we are doing it. For unless people,

understand how we operate we cannot ex-
pect their goodwill and support.

The media which help bring our message
to the public include the press, radio, tele-

46

vision, speaking engagements, booths, exhi-
bits, the annual meeting, special events, the
ASPCA NEWS BULLETIN and our magazine
ANIMAL PROTECTION, which tell our story
to 15,000 members and contributors. An em-
ployee newsletter keeps the staff abreast of
current events in the humane ﬁeld.

Booths are conducted at the National
Horse, Show and the Westminster Dog Show
at Madison Square Garden.

During the past year the Society’s activi-
ties were publicized in over 793 newspaper
and magazine articles all over the United
States and in many foreign countries. The
articles included 316 pictures. Our message
reached an audience of many millions through
radio and television.

Perhaps the most important piece of pub-
licity last year was an article on the Animal-
port—“Noah’s Ark in New York,” by Robert
Christie—which appeared in the Saturday
Evening Post.

This publicity, unusual for a local organ-
ization, stems from dozens of interviews given
to reporters and free-lance writers, as well as
press releases and articles distributed to
news media.

While newspapers, magazines, radio and
television disseminate important information
about the ASPCA, they also frequently mis-
interpret our functions, and it is the job of
public relations to correct wrong impressions.
For instance, many people think the ASPCA
is a national organization and believe we
ought to crack down on cruelty to animals
any place in the United States. Actually,
there is no national humane organization
which works directly with animals. There
are hundreds of independent SPCA’s through-
out the country. The ASPCA, the oldest and
largest, has authority only in New York State.
In practice, our program is conducted pri-
marily in New York City and environs.

Behind all of these public relations activi-
ties is the ASPCA’s strong belief that we
exist to serve the public interest and the pub-
lic is entitled to understand the means by
which we reach this objective.

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

hawks, java temple birds, mynahs, owls, par-
rots, pheasants and a vireo. Some of the
animals were turned over to zoos; others
were released to freedom in their natural
habitats.

Dog
Hcenses

Where does the money come from to pay
for shelter services? In most communities the
state or local government collects dog license
fees, maintains dog pounds or shelters, and
enforces the license law. In New York City
the ASPCA is unique in being entrusted with
these duties under a law passed in 1894.

USE OF THE LICENSE MONEY

This law stipulates that fees be used for
the following purposes:

1. Issuing licenses and renewals.

2. Carrying out all other provisions of the
Dog License Law (supplying tags, notify-
ing dog owners when to renew licenses,
returning lost dogs to owners, inspectors’
salaries, clerical work, etc.).

OJ

. Collecting unlicensed dogs (and stray cats
which do not wear a collar with the name
and address of the owner).

4. Maintaining shelters in New York City for
lost, strayed or homeless animals. All ani-
mals must be kept for a minimum of 48
hours before destruction, or if they have
been requisitioned by laboratories for ex-
perimental purposes under the provisions
of the Metcalf—Hatch law, they must be
held for an additional three days.

5. Providing a painless death for animals not
redeemed by their owners or adopted by
new owners.

24

Last year the cost of these services was
$1,045,480, exceeding fees by $253,061.

DOG POPULATION DECREASING
While license fees are the ASPCA’s great-

est source of income, they are diminishing
year by year as the city’s dog population
decreases. There are about 44,000 fewer dogs
in New York City today than there were
ﬁfteen years ago. Last year 261,798 licenses
were issued -——— 2,000 fewer than the previous
year.
Two primary reasons for the decreasing
New York City dog population are:
1. Many families with children and pets are
moving to the suburbs.
2. Many publicly financed and private hous-
ing developments do not permit dogs.

WHO NEEDS A LICENSE

Under the law every dog housed in New
York City must be licensed, regardless of
age. From the moment a puppy. is born until
it dies it requires a license, which is renew-
able each year before April 30.

Licenses are $3 and can be obtained in
person or by mail from the ASPCA ofﬁce
in the borough where the owner lives. Appli-
cations by mail should contain the name,
address and telephone number of the owner,
plus the name, age, breed, sex, color and
markings of the dog, and should be accom-
panied by a check or money order for $3
payable to the ASPCA.

The ASPCA does not collect license fees
outside New York City.

KENNELS AND PET SHOPS

Dogs kept for sale in kennels and pet shops
do not need a license. However, we do advise
it as a protection to the dealer in case a dog
is lost or escapes. The license can be trans-
ferred to the purchaser, who will need a
license anyway if the pet is to be kept in
New York City. The license fee can be added
to the sale price.

Dogs kept for breeding purposes must be
licensed.




throughout the state, in addition to the eleven
in the city.

If a local humane organization can handle
complaints in its area, the ASPCA does not
interfere. Often, when an expensive trial is
contemplated, or where additional agents are
needed, or the local group doesn’t have the
necessary ﬁnancial backing, we are asked to
help.

The ASPCA has no jurisdiction outside
New York State. In New York City our
agents are on duty from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m.,
including weekends. Normally, a complaint
received one day is investigated the next.
However, emergencies such as an animal be-
ing tortured are investigated immediately
regardless of the hour. Agents on duty tele-
phone their ofﬁce hourly at quarter-hour in-
tervals, and the agent nearest the scene is
sent to investigate. All agents carry revolvers
for humanely dispatching a suffering animal.

Last year we tracked down 5,379 cases of
alleged cruelty, an average of 15 a day. We
welcome all complaints, even though anony-
mous callers make our job difﬁcult. Often
insufficient information is reported and we
have no way of pursuing the case further.
Many people are quick to accuse a neighbor
of cruelty, but later refuse to sign a com-
plaint or appear in court as a witness.

The majority of cases we investigate are
corrected after a warning. But if that fails,
we will prosecute. F ifty-nine cases ended in
court action last year—about one percent
of all those investigated. Convictions in which
offenders were ﬁned or given jail sentences
were secured in 47 cases.

In one case a Coney Island animal zoo
owner was charged with neglecting a sick

calf and was ﬁned $25.
OUR JURISDICTION lIMITED

The laws in New York State determine
what constitutes cruelty and what does not.
If a case does not come under the laws, we
are powerless to interfere. We cannot indis-
criminately take an animal away from an
owner accused of cruelty. Depriving an

owner of his animal can only be done by a
judge, if he ﬁnds the defendant guilty after
a fair trial.

Incessant barking is outside our jurisdic-
tion, unless the barking is caused by prov-
able cruelty. If it is prolonged it can be
classiﬁed a nuisance and becomes a matter
for the police.

While the ASPCA does not round up
pigeons, we will furnish a humane pigeon
trap plan to anyone who requests it and
we’ll pick up trapped birds for a $1 fee, or
accept them at the shelters at no charge. A
permit from the Department of ' Health is
needed to trap pigeons in New York City.
Littering the streets with food for pigeons is
a matter for the New York Sanitation De-
partment. (

A commercial ﬁrm, Twin City Pigeon
Eliminating Co., is now trapping pigeons on
a contractual basis for several large New
York buildings. The trapped pigeons are
brought to the ASPCA for humane de-

struction.

BULLFIGHTS

There has been a growing tendency during
the past few years to soften up the Amer-
ican public on the subject of bullﬁghting.
Actors, writers and other public ﬁgures have
openly supported the gruesome spectacle.
Advertising, paintings, posters, books, mo-
tion pictures and television have publicized
the ceremony. 7

We have successfully opposed all attempts
to stage a bullﬁght in New York. Bullﬁght
publicity is another matter. We have no
means of preventing newspaper and maga-
zine articles. Freedom of the press allows a
publisher to report or pictorialize any pub-
lic event.

Protests from us are not very effective.
Editors expect a humane society to protest.
But letters from readers can and often do
affect policy. Publications are printed to sell,
and if an article has displeased a large seg-
ment of the readership, a publisher is un-
likely to print a similar one again.

For nearly a century The American
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals has protected and cared for the
lost, the unwanted; the sick and the mis-
treated. Last year more than two and a
half million animals came under our
protective mantle. They included the
elephant performing in a circus, the steer
being transported for food, the horse on
the bridle path, the puppy for sale in a
pet shop and the cat used for research in
a laboratory.

The abandoned were cared for in our
eight shelters. The sick were treated in
our hospital. The homeless were placed
in new homes. The mistreated were pro-
tected from abuse.

As we approach our second century
of guarding the welfare of New York’s
animals, I invite you to review the work
of the past year———a year of vigorous
expansion and renewed dedication to the
principles that in 1866 prompted Henry
Bergh to found the ASPCA, the ﬁrst

humane society in the United States.

In July 1952, immediately after the Met-
calf-Hatch Law went into effect, the ASPCA
sent its membership a bulletin called The
ASPCA Story, in which we expressed the
following hope:

In the Metcalf—Hatch law the Board of Managers

of the ASPCA sees for the ﬁrst time in the his-

tory of its long ﬁght for animal welfare, an
opportunity for unlimited and unscheduled in-
spection of experimental laboratories. This opens
up to its jurisdiction an entirely new and wider
area in which to operate for the protection of
animals. And, since the law carries'a misde-
meanor clause, the Society will be in a position
to report any offense which is discovered to the

Commissioner of Health for proper action.

Not long after, that hope became a reality.
As laboratories began to requisition animals,
the ASPCA requested inspection privileges.
Our requests were granted without hesitancy.
The result is that ever since the Metcalf-
Hatch Law went into effect the ASPCA has
periodically (and without appointment) in-
spected all laboratories requisitioning animals
from us. Last year We made a total of 105
unannounced inspections, giving us an op-
portunity to examine 261,234 animals, 132
times the number of animals requisitioned
from us.

No experiment is performed without a
complete step-by-step record to which the
ASPCA always has access. After each in-
spection the investigating oﬂicer ﬁles a report
on each laboratory, answering such questions
as these:

0 Is the food given to the animals whole-
some and in sufﬁcient quantity for the
type of animal and scientiﬁc test?

0 Are the quarters well ventilated?

0 Are the quarters or cages large enough so
that each animal can stand, sit and lie in
a normal position, and turn around with
ease?

0 Does the laboratory or institution main-
tain records on allocated dogs and cats?
0 Was anesthesia used, if applicable?

0 Was post-operative care given animals
equivalent to that rendered human beings
following an operation?

For the most part, we ﬁnd that animals
used in medical research are housed in
bright, clean wards, eat a balanced ration
and receive expert care and consideration.
Many even enjoy luxuries like air-conditioned
quarters and post-operative convalescence in
the country.

At the other extreme, inspectors have also
uncovered some distressing conditions rang-
ing from poorly ventilated wards to cages
encrusted with old excrement. Last year the
ASPCA withheld all animals from one insti-
tution until conditions were improved. Sev-
eral others were given a deadline for cor-
recting sub-standard conditions and our

Highway accidents

A dog once darted onto a busy freeway,
and here’s what happened: 40 cars were in-
volved in a chain-reaction collision that ex-
tended over three miles, eleven people were
injured, $10,000 damage was done to the
cars, and the dog was killed.

We deplore the heartless hit-and-run
driver who injures a pet on the highway and
speeds on, leaving the dog to die. But owners
who don’t keep tabs on their pets are as
much to blame.

Animals that stray onto the highway not
only imperil their own lives, but people’s
too. During 1960 there were 786 motor ve-
hicle accidents in New York State involving
animals. One person was killed and 263 in-
jured. Although there’s no record of the num-
ber of animals killed, the ﬁgure is undoubt-
edly high.

We therefore urge pet owners to keep as
close tabs on their pets as on their children.

Not all animals involved in accidents are
pets, of course. Deer caused 81 percent of
all the animal-caused accidents on the New
York State Thruway last year.

What should you do when a big brown
buck leaps in front of your car?

“It depends,” says the National Safety
Council, “on your speed, number of trafﬁc
lanes and shoulder widths.” When an acci-
dent is inevitable, it recommends that brakes
be applied. Generally, it is better to go
straight ahead rather than swerve. At slower
speeds, good visibility, wide shoulder and
with the vehicle under control, you might
try to avoid hitting the animal by turning
toward. the right shoulder. Turning onto op-
posite trafﬁc lanes would be hazardous, the
Council cautions.

The New York State Vehicle and Trafﬁc
law requires motorists to stop and report any
accident involving a horse, dog or other do-
mesticated animal. Violation is punishable by
a ﬁne up to $10 for the ﬁrst offense, not less
than $10 for the second offense and $10
to $25 for the third and subsequent offenses.

QUESTIONS FREQUENTLY ASKED
ABOUT LICENSES

Q. I have two homes, one of which is in
New York City. Must my dog have a
New York City license?

A. Yes. But visitors do not need tags if
they are in the City only a few days.

0. Can I get another tag if mine is lost,

or if I want several for different collars?

. Yes, additional tags are $1 each.

. If my dog dies, may I transfer his tag

to a new dog?

A. No. Licenses are not transferable to a
new dog because the description on the
license certificate would not fit the
new dog.

Q. Suppose I give my dog away. Can the
new owner use the same tag?

A. .Yes. But ask the new owner to notify
us.

D>

 

 

 

LOST DOGS

Last year 6,206 lost dogs were returned
to their owners, mainly because they were
found wearing license tags. The license num-
ber is quickly checked in our cross-ﬁle. We
have two ﬁles: one numerical and one alpha-
betical according to the owner’s name.

Our lost and found departments also do
their best to trace owners of unlicensed dogs.
They read lost and found columns, check
newspaper ads and telephone calls. But no
system is as sure as the tag. We have re-
turned lost dogs to owners are far away as
Florida, Massachusetts and South America
by tracing the tag number.

PENALTIES

Owners who have not— licensed their dogs
may be summoned before a magistrate and
ﬁned up to $10. If the ﬁne is not paid,
owners can be imprisoned up to ten days. If
an unlicensed dog is picked up on the street,
the owner must pay a $3 redemption fee,
plus the $3 license.

The Society has 23 uniformed license ofﬁ-
cers who enforce the law. Each ofﬁcer is
assigned to one area in the City. He visits
residential buildings in his area to make
certain every dog living there has a license.
In addition, we remind owners by mail early

in March that licenses must be renewed by
April 30. Reminders also appear in news-
papers and on radio and television.

Shelters
outside
New York City

The ASPCA operates three shelters outside
New York City. Two are in Nassau County,
Long Island—one in Glen Cove, the other
in Long Beach. The third is in Westchester
County at Elmsford.

We were invited into these neighboring
communities several years ago. In Long Island
local government authorities requested us to
take over their shelter work and provided
the shelters.

In Westchester the Western Westchester
Humane Society, which was no longer strong
enough to fulﬁll its obligations in the area,
appealed to us to take over its shelter. This
attractive suburban shelter located among
wooded hills, was completely refurbished.
We added landscaping, a year-round aviary,
a new heating system and an apartment for
a caretaker.

In all three communities we are under
contract to local governments.

0 In Long Beach we serve only that city.

0 In Glen Cove, besides our contract with
that city, we also have contracts to service

nearby Sea Cliff, East Hills and Bayville.

0 In Elmsford, while we do not service this
town itself, we have contracts with Irving-
ton, Mount Pleasant, Tarrytown, North
Tarrytown, Hastings-on-Hudson, and Dobbs
Ferry.

STAFF

This year an experienced night nurse has
been added to the staff. He will be on duty
from 11 pm. to 7 am. to minister to hos-
pitalized patients. The staff includes a direc-
tor, ofﬁce manager, ten veterinarians, nine
attendants, a tissue technician, a clinical
laboratory and X-ray technician, night super-
visor, night nurse, and six ofﬁce workers.

An innovation this year is an internship
program consisting of a formal course in
post-graduate training. Our ﬁrst intern grad-
uated in June.

The Pathology Department is making great
progress under our pathologist, who has in-
troduced a number of new laboratory tests.
He has also developed liaisons with human
hospitals for correlated studies of pathological
conditions in animals and man.

The Department of Surgery is under the
direction of a veterinarian recently returned
from the armed services where he spent two
years in team efforts to develop newer surgi-
cal techniques. He is now applying much of
this new knowledge to our surgical patients.

NEW SURGERY TECHNIQUES

During the year our ﬁrst open-heart sur-
gery was performed on a dog afﬂicted with
heartworm disease. Large round worms in-
fected the right side of the heart, extending
to the pulmonary blood vessels leading to
the lungs. The patient had difﬁculty breath-
ing and death was expected in days unless
heroic methods were undertaken. Heart sur-
' gery, a pioneer operation in animal as well
as human medicine, was the answer. During
the operation six large worms were removed
from the heart. The patient made a stormy
but successful recovery. ‘

We expect to introduce other new surgical
methods during the coming year.

NEW DRUGS

We are continuing to test new drugs in
cooperation with pharmaceutical houses. A
current project involves study of a new dis-

 

 




 

 

inspectors checked back frequently to see

that the improvements were made perma-

nent. All institutions cooperated fully.
Poor conditions were usually traced to one
of these causes:

0 Shortage of attendants.

0 Overcrowding of animals.

0 Several hospitals claimed facilities were
temporary while new quarters were being
constructed.

0 Lack of awareness of the needs of animals
on the part of the director, doctors or
attendants.

During the past year the Society adopted

a stronger, more effective program of labor-
atory inspection, using ASPCA staff veterin-
arians instead of special agents as inspectors.
Experience has led us to conclude that vet-
erinarians are better trained to recognize
sub-standard conditions in laboratories. And
they can deal on a professional basis with
medical personnel in charge of laboratory
research, making it easier to move swiftly to
bring about necessary corrections.

Animal
welfare
legislation

The ASPCA, the humane organization re-
sponsible for the country’s ﬁrst anti-cruelty
law passed in 1866, is still fighting for ani-
mal protective legislation. During the past
few years we have concentrated on compul-
sory humane slaughter laws for food animals.

Such legislation was dreamed of as far
back as the 1880’s when awards were origi-
nally offered for the perfection of humane
slaughtering methods which would be ac-

42

ceptable to meat packers. In Europe and
elsewhere certain systems Were in use as
early as 1873, but the American Meat Insti-
tute frowned on them.

Then in the early 1950’s meat packer
George A. Hormel adopted a process for
anesthetizing hogs before slaughter. The hogs
were carried through a tunnel ﬁlled with
carbon dioxide which rendered them un-
conscious in seconds. This was the first active
step in introducing humane slaughter to this
country.

THE JAMES HOPKINS AWARD

Recognizing the beginning of a trend, the
ASPCA in 1953 presented Hormel with the
James Hopkins Award, consisting of a sterl-
ing silver plaque and a cash award. This
honor was made possible by a trust fund left
to the Society by the late James Hopkins,
who designated that it be used speciﬁcally
to recognize outstanding improvements in
humane slaughter methods.

The beneﬁts of the new carbon dioxide
method, as attested to by Hormel, and others
who later adopted the “sleep tunnel,” proved
to be an inspiration to manufacturers and
inventors who began to develop other means
for humanely killing animals for food.

Some of these methods are:

0 The Thor Stunner, an air-powered tool
which knocks cattle and sheep unconscious
instantly, prior to slaughter, with a single
tap on the back of the head.

0 Captive bolt pistols, which emit a bolt
that penetrates the animal’s brain.

0 The Remington Humane Stunner, which
renders cattle unconscious instantly with
a mushroom-shaped bolt that does not
penetrate the skull.

' An electric knife for poultry inserted into
the throat. _

Five manufacturers of these instruments
and the packing companies which experi-
mented with and converted to the use of these
humane devices have been presented with
our Hopkins Award.

This year the award went to John Engel-

In all these areas we are responsible for
picking up any unleashed dog, whether li-
censed or unlicensed, if it is off its owner’s
premises. There is a boarding fee for animals
not called for within 24 hours.

Penalties for allowing a dog to run loose
vary because of differing local laws. Some
communities exact ﬁnes as well as redemp-
tion fees. In some instances ﬁnes are col-
lected by the police; in others we collect the
penalties and turn them over to the local
government. We never retain either a ﬁne
or a redemption fee.

OTHER SERVICES

The three shelters also offer other humane
activities:

0 We call for unwanted animals on request
from homes in the areas where we have
contracts for a $1 fee.

0 We call for dead animals for a $5 fee.

' We accept unwanted animals at the shel-
ters for adoption or to be put to sleep,
regardless of where the animal comes from.
We ﬁnd homes for the homeless through
our intensive and extensive adoption ser-
vice.

' We rescue pets in distress and wild ani-
mals in the contract areas.

There is no charge for the last three ser-
vices, but contributions are always welcome.

Finding homes
for the
homeless

Finding homes for the homeless is a major 7
responsibility of any animal welfare organi-
zation worthy of its name. With ASPCA it’s
a mission well rewarded when thousands of
insecure, frightened cats and dogs are trans-
formed into proud, conﬁdent pets.

We have more than tripled the number of
animals placed in new homes over the past
ten years by placing added emphasis on this
phase of our program. Last year homes were
found for a record 20,186 animals.

To encourage adoptions we have installed
adoption wards in our shelters which show
the animals to better advantage than small
individual cages. From behind plate glass
windows the public can watch them frisking
and playing in community cages equipped
with trees, shelves, tunnels and toys. Animals
may be adopted free of charge from any of
our eight shelters. There is only the license
fee for a dog to be kept in New York City.

CONTRIBUTIONS WELCOME

There’s no charge because the adoption
service is one of several ASPCA activities
paid for by contributions. We are always
grateful to anyone giving a home to one of
our orphans who makes a contribution to-
ward the care of others still unchosen. Other-
wise, we could not afford the extra effort we
make to ﬁnd the right home for the right
animal.

HOW TO ADOPT AN ANIMAL

Animals for adoption are available at all
ASPCA shelters. Adoption wards are open

How to Bring Up Your Dog

( Continued from page 9 )

the hottest time of the day. An older dog
should have his exercise curtailed, but not
eliminated altogether.

Feeding. Give your dog fresh water three
times a day, and keep the pan in the same,
convenient place. Keep water and feed pans
or dishes clean. Don’t give him water within
an hour before or after meals, or immedi-
ately after vigorous exercise.

A puppy should be fed small portions four
times a day, and should be left somewhat
hungry. When he reaches six months, reduce
the feedings to twice a day, increasing the
portions somewhat. A full-grown dog, if he
is big, should have one large meal, prefer-
ably in the evening. A smaller dog should
have two feedings: one in the morning and
one in the evening.

Dogs love variety in their food, and it’s
good for them, so vary the menu. Nowadays,
dogs, like humans, tend to be overweight.
Try to avoid over-feeding your dog —— err on
the side of leanness. But the general rule is:
try to keep your dog at a uniform weight.

Grooming. Brush your dog for ﬁve or
ten minutes every day. This stimulates his
skin, increases the thickness and sheen of
his coat, and keeps him comfortable. Usually
no puppy should be bathed before six months.
However, if very dirty, it’s prudent to bathe
using a neutral-type soap. Be particularly
careful that you don’t frighten a dog when
you bathe him the ﬁrst time. Use lukewarm
water. Place a ring of soap around the dog’s
neck and ears to prevent ﬂeas from congre-
gating there. Rinse and dry the dog thor-
oughly, and let him exercise to help evapor-
ate the moisture.

Breaking bad habits

It’s great fun to train a dog to beg, roll
over, and retrieve— but don’t overlook the
essential training. Here is some assorted
advice:

Barking. Close your dog’s muzzle quickly
and command (don’t shout) “Quiet.” Or
make a noise to surprise him into silence—

10

like dropping a tin plate.

Chewing. The best way to protect your
newspaper and slippers is to provide your
dog with the proper toy. If you catch him
doing mischief, scold him and give him
the toy.

Jumping. A dog that jumps on people
will be discouraged if he meets an upraised
knee en route. Another way is catching his
front paws, and gently stepping on his rear
paws.

Chasing cars. Drive by in your car, wait
until the dog lunges, and then spray him in
the face with a water pistol. Quickly get
out and scold the dog.

Develop a general method to discipline
your dog—scolding; spanking him with a
loose newspaper to frighten him; or, if he
is really bad, conﬁning him. Don’t call your
dog to punish him and don’t rush over to
punish him — he may expect a reward, and
the conflict may confuse him.

If there are obedience training courses in
your area, by all means register with your
dog. In New York the ASPCA conducts such
classes. Call TRafalgar 6-7700 for informa-
tion.

There are, as we said, many new and life-
saving medicines for canine veterinary use,
and luxuries such as diamond collars to
lavish on your pet. But only kindness and
understanding can make a dog love you.

horn 8: Sons, Inc., a pork packer of Newark,
N. 1., for developing and using a humane
means of stunning hogs prior to slaughter.
The company perfected a holding pen that
controls a hog while it is stunned electrically
prior to slaughter.

Some of the beneﬁts gained by the packers .

who adopted humane slaughter methods are:

0 Lower operating costs following expense of
initial conversion.

0 Facility of operation.

0 Comparative safety for the worker, leading
to higher employee morale in a job with
one of the highest accident rates of any
industry.

0 Reduction of wasteful bruises in animals,
estimated to have previously cost the pack-
ing industry $50 million yearly.

0 Faster production.

A FEDERAL lAW

By 1955 a sufﬁcient number of humane
slaughter methods was available so that legis-
lation could no longer be fought off with the
argument that it could not be enforced for
lack of means.

At this point the humane movement rallied
forces to enlist legislation to introduce bills
before the United States Congress. The Amer-
ican Humane Association, a federation of
over 500 animal welfare organizations in the
United States, led the way in having such
legislation introduced.

An active member of the American Hu-
mane Association, the ASPCA distributed a
series of pamphlets urging individuals to let
Congress know that the American public
wanted a humane slaughter law. We sent out
nationwide publicity releases, which resulted
in a number of favorable editorials. Our rep-
resentatives went to Washington to testify at
hearings before the Senate Agriculture Com-
mittee.

Three years after the ﬁrst bill was intro-
duced, Congress passed a humane slaughter
law, and on August 27, 1958, former Presi-
dent Dwight D. Eisenhower signed it. This
law making it mandatory for all meat pur-

chased by the United States Government to be
humanely slaughtered became fully effective
August 31, 1960.

While this federal legislation affects 90
percent of the meat purchased in the country,
almost 2,800 packers do not sell to the United
States Government and thus are not forced

.to install humane slaughter methods unless

state laws are passed. Several states, includ-
ing California, New Hampshire, Wisconsin,
Connecticut, Florida, Kansas, Maine, Ore-
gon, Rhode Island, Minnesota, Washington
and Massachusetts have passed such a law.

lEGISLATION FOR
NEW YORK STATE
For the past three years the ASPCA has

backed humane slaughter legislation in New
York State and has been represented in
Albany to get these measures passed.

Each year bills were introduced, but failed
to pass because of pressure from Orthodox
Jewish groups who objected on the grounds
that such legislation would interfere with
traditional methods of ritual slaughter.

The fact is the proposed legislation con-
siders Kosher slaughter itself to be humane.
It would merely outlaw the pre-slaughter,
non-ritual shackling and hoisting.

A new method of'controlling animals be-
fore slaughter not only eliminates cruelty,
but operates as fast as hoisting and shackling
and still complies with religious doctrine. A
restraining device called Can Pac Koshering
Pen is being used succesSfully by kosher
packers in Canada and has received orthodox
rabbinical approval in the United States.
Prior to slaughter the animal is restrained in
a pen, its head lifted to a position that per-
mits the instantaneous severance of the
arteries in the neck, as demanded in kosher
slaughtering.

The humane movement is already at work
on humane slaughter legislation for 1962.
The objective meantime is to convince ortho-
dox Jews as well as legislators that a humane
slaughter law would not interfere with reli-
gious freedom.

SCHOOL CHILDREN

Saturday is the day set aside in the class-
room for Junior Members. But weekdays are
booked up with classes of school children
and their teachers. Last year 15,065 children
visited the shelter, saw ﬁlms, took the grand
tour of the hospital and learned animal care.

Disturbed and handicapped children come
to our classroom too, and enjoy the program
perhaps even more than normal children.
Blind children squeal with delight when they
touch the rabbit’s furry ears. Deaf children

glow with pride when they bravely drape the
boa constrictor around their necks after the
instructor has shown them how.

Last year we received children from the
New York School for the Deaf, the New
York Institute for the Education of the Blind,
emotionally disturbed children from Creed-
more State Hospital and Public School 105,
brain injured children from Public School
59, and mentally retarded youngsters from
St. Rose of Lena.

PET SHOWS

More and more New York youth organiza-
tions are realizing the social value of encour-
aging a child’s interest in a pet. The result
is that pet shows are becoming a popular
youth organization activity. Last year the
ASPCA sponsored or assisted 60 shows, often
acting as judges and presenting awards for
the best-cared-for pets.

LITERATURE AND FILMS

Fifty-seven thousand pieces of educational
literature were distributed last year — free to
public schools and at cost to the general pub-
lic. Many of the booklets, ranging in price
from 5¢ to 50¢, were written by the Humane
Education Department staff. A list is avail-
able on request.

Among the most frequently requested book-
lets are That New Puppy, The Dog as a City
Pet, The Cat as a City Pet, Your Dog and
Its Care. The last two are given free to peo-
ple who adopt animals from the ASPCA.

A series of bookmarks with information
on care of the dog, turtle, cat, hamster,
guinea pig, horse, mice, rat, rabbit, ﬁsh and
parakeet is available.

Last year more than 300 schools, pet clubs,
civic groups and other humane societies
showed our ﬁlms and asked for our recom-
mendations on motion pictures and ﬁlmstrips
on animals. During the year our list of 100
recommended animal ﬁlms, “A Catalog of
Films about Animals and Animal Care,” was
completely revised.

 

 

 




 

 

temper vaccine developed in test tubes on
tissue culture. The method produces a live
virus capable of immunizing an animal with-
out causing the disease itself. It shows prom-
ise of greater immunity to this dread disease
than vaccines now in use.

The manufacturer supplies the test vaccine
free and we inoculate pets without charge.
Thus many of our adopted dogs whose
owners might not be able to afford the usual
fee are now protected. This is an important
aspect of a team effort to provide newer and
better therapy for all animal patients.

HOSPITAL HOURS

Clinic hours are from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
Monday through Saturday, except holidays.
There is emergency service evenings from
4:30 to 7, and on Sundays and holidays from
9 a.m. to 7 p.m. There is no veterinarian on
duty from 7 p.m. to 9 a.m.

Animals are examined in the order of
their arrival in the reception room. Of course
emergencies are taken ﬁrst. To avoid wait-
ing, appointments may be made in advance
for an added fee, and a client may see a
particular doctor at a speciﬁed time.

NIGHT EMERGENCY SERVICE

The hospital participates in the night emer-
gency service sponsored by the Veterinary
Medical Association of New York City. We
rotate turns of night duty with other veter-
inary hospitals to provide emergency service
for pet owners in Manhattan, Bronx, Brook-
lyn and Queens from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. every
day. Owners who dial SU 7-1400 will be
given the name and telephone number of a
veterinarian on duty in their borough that
night.

AMBULANCE SERVICE

If an owner can’t bring his animal to the
hospital, we will send an ambulance equipped
with oxygen tank, stretcher, emergency lights
and ﬁrst aid kit. Ambulance service is avail-
able 24 hours a day. The fee depends on the
distance from the hospital.

Our hospital fees are comparable to those
charged at other veterinary hOSpitals. How-
ever, where an owner proves he can’t afford
our regular fees, he pays what he can. In
cases where an owner can pay nothing, fees
are waived entirely. Forty percent of our
patients are charity cases.

IF A PET MUST BE HOSPITALIZED

Most patients are examined in the out-
patient clinic and home treatment is pre-
scribed. But many must be hospitalized. In
these cases:

0 We urge owners to protect pets by author-
izing temporary immunizations against
contagious diseases, regardless of previous
vaccinations, unless the examining veter-
inarian recommends otherwise.

0 Each hospitalized animal has a tempera-
ture-controlled individual cage, sterilized
after each patient.

0 Fresh water in individual containers is
changed three times a day.

0 Animals are fed a well-balanced basic ra-
tion, with speciﬁc diets when prescribed
by the doctor.

0 Dogs are exercised when possible in out-
door runs on the roof at least twice a day
——morning and afternoon.

0 Each of the ten veterinarians makes his
ward rounds for 45 minutes every day.

0 A record card is posted on the kennel
identifying the animal, the nature of the
ailment and the treatment prescribed.

0 Sanitary and aseptic conditions are con-
trolled to the best of human ability. Ex-
amining and operating tables are sterilized
after each patient. Kennels and outdoor
runs are disinfected daily. As in human
hospitals, surgeons “scrub up” with anti-
septics before an operation and wear caps,
face masks and gloves.

FOR OWNER’S INFORMATION

We realize owners are anxious when their
pets are hospitalized. To make it easier to
ﬁnd out a pet’s progress, we set aside two

PUBLIC APPEARANCES

Our Supervisor of Education gives lectures
and demonstrations on animal care on radio,
television and in schools and the New York
Public Library. Last year she made 38 such
appearances.

CONSULTATION SERVICE

Our Humane Education Department serves
as consultant on animal problems to a num-
ber of organizations. The Supervisor is a
member of the Committee on Animal Care
of the Board of Education of New York City
and has been named to the Advisory Council
of the Dog Care Division of Ralston Purina
C0,, manufacturer of dog food.

OBEDIENCE TRAINING FOR DOGS

With the City’s dog population pegged at
around 260,000, obedience training is a real
necessity for all dogs. Bad-mannered dogs
are a hazard in trafﬁc, an annoyance to
neighbors and a nuisance to landlords. A
well-behaved pet is welcome almost any-
where.

Since 1944 the ASPCA has trained 17,000

dogs and their owners at our obedience
training classes in Manhattan and Glen Cove.
Dogs and owners are always trained together
——the theory being that we teach you to
train your dog. Dogs should be about six

The nature of the dog

By Charles Leedham

A. dog sees, hears and smells
a world different from ours

Your dog operates in a world so different
from yours that it is difﬁcult to imagine it.
He sees differently, and smells differently.

Eyes

In gross construction, the dog’s eye is al-
most identical With the human’s —— lids, lens,
iris, cornea, pupil, retina and optic nerve
leading to the brain. One of the major phy-
sical differences is the presence of a half-op-
erative nictitating membrane ~— a sort of
“third eyelid” — which you may notice slid-
ing back from the eye, towards the inner
corner, when your dog just wakes up. This
membrane is fully operative in such aquatic
animals as frogs, serving to protect the eye
while open underwater (it is transparent or
translucent), but it is vestigial in dogs.

The major operating differences in a dog’s
eyes are that the retina totally lacks the cells
which allow color perception, and the vovea
which brings objects into sharp focus. De-
spite numerous letters from indignant owners
which appear in the dog magazines as regu-
larly as the seasons, dogs are color blind.

So far as it is possible to tell, the dog goes
through life seeing one long black-and-white
movie. He does not miss color because he
never has seen it. He can and does use his
eyes to quite good effect, just as you could
if you saw everything through some curious
permanent glasses which took all the color

out of the world and made it seem like a
black—and-white picture. In a non-color snap-
shot or movie, you can easily tell the differ-
ence between a black and a white coat, and
can distinguish a thousand shades of gray.
So can a dog, and is no more handicapped
by color-blindness than you are in watching
a normal movie versus a Technicolor one.

Dogs are also as a rule considerably near-
sighted, this being the best term available
to describe the lack of ﬁne-detail focus.

If you are myopic yourself, you will have
little trouble visualizing what the world then
looks like to a dog. If not, you can best
visualize it by looking at an object across
the room, then without shifting your eyes,
try to make out the ﬁne detail of another
object near the ﬁrst one.

This may give rise to the question of how
a dog can recognize a familiar person at a
distance. The simple answer is that he can’t,
really. What happens is that he has learned
to recognize either a general outline, or cer-
tain special characteristics —— a way of walk-
ing, for example. It is much the same process
by which you will come to recognize a
friend’s footsteps.‘Your hearing isn’t any
better, it’s just that you’ve unconsciously
learned a pattern of noises.

The dog’s greater night-vision is at least
partially due to a curious structure called

Mr. Leedham, instructor of the ASPCA’S obedience training course for dogs, has written
two books on dogs. His Dog Obedience Training, co-authored with Milo Pearsall, became
a Book-of-the-Month Club selection. This article is condensed with the permission of
Charles Scribner’s Sons from Mr. Leedham’s new book, Care of the, [Dog (Copyright ©

Director of Hospital and Clinic, contains a complete guide to care, feeding and basic

welfare of dogs.

 

 

 




 

 

 

Awards

In recognition of outstanding achievements
where animals are concerned, we present the
following awards:

MEDAL OF HONOR

The medal, accompanied by a Certiﬁcate
of Merit, goes to a person who has performed
an heroic service for animals, or to an animal
that has rescued a person. Recipients this
year included a dog that warned a family
of ﬁre during the night and a pet that pro-
tected its owner from attack by a burglar.
Among the human recipients were two boys
who saved a drowning dog.

ALFRED B. MACLAY TROPHY

The purpose is to emphasize to young
riders the importance of kindness and gentle-
ness in handling their mounts. It is open to
children under 18 who compete in the ASPCA
Horsemanship Event at recognized horse
shows throughout the country. The charge
for conducting this class is $10. Winners of
the individual shows compete in the National
Championship Event at the National Horse
Show each year. The winner receives a rep-
lica of the original challenge trophy donated
by the late Alfred B. Maclay in 1933.

HENRY BERGH TROPHY

This horsemanship trophy is open to young
riders at non-recognized horse shows through-
out the country. Shows may hold this class
free of charge. The trophy is awarded yearly
to the junior who accumulates the most points
in competition in the Henry Bergh Class in
various shows. At the end of the year an
extra ﬁve points is given any entrant who
can prove he has cared for and groomed his
own horse. The trophy itself is donated to
the Society. This year’s silver revere bowl

was donated by Mr. and Mrs. John H. Borrie.

VETERINARY SCHOLARSHIP

Since 1956 we have offered a $300 veter-
inary scholarship at Cornell University. The

44

scholarship goes to a fourth year veterinary
student chosen by the faculty on the basis of

' need, scholarship and general competence. It

is made possible by Secor Farms Riding
Academy, which contributes to us the pro-
ceeds of its annual horse show, and will con-
tinue through 1964.

JAMES HOPKINS AWARD

This sterling silver plaque is presented for
the best improvement in the humane slaugh-
ter of food animals. The late James Hopkins
left the Society a trust fund to be Used spe-
ciﬁcally for this purpose. The award has
been made ﬁve times. This year it went to
John Engelhorn & Sons, Inc., a pork packer
of Newark, N. J ., for developing and using
a humane means of stunning hogs prior to
slaughter. Edgar E. Moss, the company’s
plant manager, who invented the method,
was also cited.

JUNIOR ACHIEVEMENT AWARD

The annual award goes to Junior Members
who put in 50 hours of work in the Humane
Education Department, caring for the ani-
mals, performing clerical duties, etc.

Where
our money
comes from

The Society’s total budget for the ﬁscal
year 1960-1961 was $1,597,085. Two thirds
of the total —— $1,045,480 —— went for the
shelter services required of us by law. These
services include issuing dog licenses, enforc-
ing the dog license law, maintaining shelters
for the care of lost, stray and abandoned ani-

 

 

 




Race track strike

When an attempt to unionize exercise
boys, grooms and drivers caused a strike
at race tracks in New York State in late July
and August, the ASPCA was right on the
spot to protect the horses.

In addition to checks at Belmont and
Aqueduct in New York City, our vigilance
extended as far as Saratoga Race Track, a
distance of 185 miles from the City, and be-
yond our usual inspection area.

Special Agent William Ryan was sent to
Saratoga on July 28. Brought up around race
tracks—his father was a trainer—Mr.
Ryan has become the ASPCA’s “horse ex-
pert” during his 49 years with the Society.

Mr. Ryan found six pickets set up around
the track—four at the main gate and two
at the hack gate. The alert, well-organized
Saratoga police were escorting horse vans
in and out of the track past the picket lines.
Outside the city limits the vans, traveling in

 

Special Agent Ryan at Saratoga.

convoy, were protected by State Police.

Inside the track Pinkerton Detective
Agency had hired 200 special patrolmen.

During the 5 a.m. to 10 a.m. training and
exercising period Ryan patrolled the exercise
area. During the actual racing from 1 pm.
to 6 pm. he stationed himself at the starter’s
gate. After the races he patrolled the barn
area until dark.

The Nature of the Dog
(Continued from page 3)

“tapetum lucidum,” a layer of reﬂective cells
of the retina. This is a very strongly fun-
tioning structure in cats, and is fully present
in many dogs, partially present in some
others, and apparently totally or nearly ab-
sent in a few. Among other things, this
layer causes the eyeshine of animals, by re-
ﬂecting light back out of the eye. In assisting
with night Vision, it acts somewhat like the
mirror of a reﬂecting "telescope, bouncing
back light from the rear to the retina, thus
intensifying a dim image. This tapetum luci-
dum, incidentally, is totally absent in hu-
mans, which scotches any speculation on
whether people’s eyes would shine in the
dark if you could just manage to get the
light to hit them right. They don’t.

Ears

The ear is almost identical in structure to
the human ear. The major differences are
the size of the outer structure, considerably
greater muscular control, and an angled turn
in the outer ear canal which protects the
eardrum from damage. The long outer ear
structure is of considerable value in one way
or another to the dog. If the ear is erect, it
acts as an excellent sound antenna, an ear-
trumpet of sorts, which can be turned to
catch faint sound. If the ear is ﬂopped it is a
minor hindrance to good hearing, although
the flopped section provides a curtain-like
protection against dirt and injury.

It is largely in range of hearing that a
dog’s ears differ. The extended range is al-
most universally known—it can be prag-
matically demonstrated by using one of the
widely advertised “silent” dog whistles.
Tootle on one of these, and you will hear
nothing, or only a faint high peeping. But
to the dog it is a shrill blast, audible as much
as half mile away. The whistles are con-
structed to sound only in the region above
15,000 cycles per second, beyond the normal
range of human hearing, but well within the
dog’s extended range.

4*.

Laboratory experiments have shown the
top range of a dog’s hearing to be about
25,000 cycles—by comparison, the highest
note of a piano is 4,186 cycles per second,
and very, very few humans can hear sounds
above 15,000 cycles. Russian experimenters
at one time or another have claimed dis-
covery of canine perception as far up as

100,000 cycles.

Nose

It is when we get into the subject of the
dog’s nose and his powers of smell that we
approach the incomprehensible. The struc-
ture of the nose is similar enough to that of
a human, from nostrils right on back. The
major difference here is in the much greater
length, particularly in the length and area
of the turbinates, inner bones covered with
erectile tissue which accomplishes the smell-
ing function.

What it would be like to smell things as a
dog does is almost beyond human compre-
hension. There are certain humans who have
been able to develop highly acute noses——
many organic chemists can identify a star-
tling number of compounds and their con-
stituents simply by smelling them, and the
famous “noses” of the French perfume indus-
try can perform wonders with a bit of per-
fume essence. There have been reports of
humans with remarkable scent abilities, to
the point of being able to tell which coat in
a rack belonged to which person at a party,
but these are very rare.

The best explanation is by analogy. 1m-
agine a very potent smell; limburger cheese
is a good one. If you were to take several
objects and have a friend rub limburger
thoroughly on one, even several days later
you would be able to tell which of the objects
had been so treated. A dog can tell, days
later, which of several objects you have
merely touched with your hand, and in fact
with luck he can tell which of several widely
separated objects you simply stood near.
Every person and every object in the world
has its own distinctive smell, easily identiﬁ-
able, to a dog.

ion, the most humane, swift and painless
available when dealing with numbers of
animals.

Many residents of other large cities, both
here and abroad, have commented favorably
on the few stray animals on New York
streets compared to those in other cosmo-
politan areas.

This is because the Society is constantly
rounding up abandoned and homeless ani-
mals on the streets. We are alert when new
demolition projects are announced. We post
signs in the area requesting old tenants not
to abandon animals when they move. Dur-
ing the past year, for instance, we have been
rounding up strays in the upper West Side
Columbus Avenue area, where there has
been extensive demolition.

We will also lend a humane trap to any-
one who wishes to catch strays. We ask a
$510 deposit for the trap, returnable when
the trap is returned. If any animals are
trapped, we will call for the animals and
the trap at our regular 31 charge per call.

The Society participates actively on the
Citizens Committee to Keep New York City
Clean, with special emphasis on picking up
stray animals in spotlighted problem areas.

Last year 33,666 stray and abandoned
animals were rescued from streets and build-

ings. We answer emergency calls any time
of day or night.

Several times a day, somewhere in the city
a cat gets stuck up a tree, or a dog is
marooned down a manhole. A litter of kit-
tens is heard meowing behind a foot-thick
wall, or a dog is caught in a subway turn-
stile.

Armed with ladders, poles, axes and
Chisels, our men race to the rescue. Some-
times they break a wall, sometimes they risk
their lives climbing a 40-foot tree. With the

22

gratuitous advice of the crowds that gather
to watch, the frightened animal is freed and
handed to a grateful owner or taken to the
shelter.

What happens to an animal whose owner
goes to prison or a hospital, or dies, and
leaves no one to care for his pet?

ASPCA’s Medical Stray Ward, which last
year cared for 2,808 animals, is the answer.
One such case last year involved a curious
private menagerie found in the one-room
apartment of a dead man on New York’s
West Side. Police called the ASPCA and we
rounded up two cats, ﬁve parakeets, four
turtles, tropical ﬁsh, a 22-foot boa constrictor,
an 18-foot boa, a 17-foot python and a 14-
foot king snake. No relatives could be found,
and the animals were cared for at our Man-
hattan Shelter until the court gave us per-
mission to place them in homes or zoos.

To the outsider New York is a city of
concrete and steel, far from the jungles and
woods inhabited by wild animals. In truth,
there are many woods and marshes in out-
lying areas in Queens, Staten Island and the
Bronx. And every so often a creature ven-
tures out of its forest home to become a
bewildered city visitor.

This year, for instance, we rescued a full-
grown deer trapped in ﬁshermen’s nets in
the Hudson River near Hastings. When a
IOU-pound harbor seal was washed ashore
on Staten Island, our men fashioned a
stretcher and carried it to our Richmond

Shelter.

Other unusual animals included a sea
turtle rescued from under a Brooklyn pier,
an escaped pet seal found cavorting in the
middle of a Long Beach boulevard, a goat
discovered wandering on a crowded Brook-
lyn street, plus a coatimundi, kinkajou, mar-
gay, alligators, bears, chinchillas, monkeys
and ocelots. There were birds too, including
a crane, eagle, heron, albatross, cockatiel,

“ N
0 animal in need of care is ever turned

away,” is a slogan our hospital is proud to
live up to. A puppy weakened by dread dis-
temper . . . a kitten with a needle lodged in
her throat . . . a dog near death because of
worms in his heart—these are some of the
animals treated in our Hospital and Clinic
last year.

These patients are getting a higher level
of care than ever before, thanks to an ex-
pansion and reorganization program started

in 1961.

During 1951, the hospital’s ﬁrst year at
441 East 92nd Street, we cared for 19,000
patients. Last year we treated 29,921, an
increase of 58 percent in ten years. To ren-
der better care and take advantage of newer
and more efﬁcient methods, the hospital is
undergoing a $50,000 expansion program
to augment our two surgery suites, ﬁve ex-
amining rooms, treatment room, pharmacy,
X-ray and ﬂuoroscope room. The pathology
department is being relocated and enlarged
to include tissue pathology as well as clinical
pathology. This will enable our staff to per-
form important necropsy (post mortem ex-
amination) work to determine the cause of
death in many puzzling cases.

Diagnostic instruments will be needed for
the new pathology laboratory, and we hope
members and friends will contribute funds
for their purchase. Needed equipment ranges

in price from $65 to $2500. (See page 5.)

The same is true of radio, television or
motion pictures. This year WPIX and WNTA
presented programs showing bullﬁghts. The
pictures were made in Spain and Mexico.

Our protests brought indifferent replies.
The National Association of Broadcasters has
a code of ethics which states that bullﬁghting
“is not in conformity with accepted stand-
ards of humane treatment.” The catch is
that these stations are not members of the
Association.

Dead animals

he ASPCA provides three services for pets
which have died:

1. Pick-up of a pet which has passed on. The
fee is $5.

2. Arrange for cremation. Through an ar-
rangement with Marble Hill Crematory for
Pet Animals, the ASPCA will have the ani-
mal picked up and cremated. The charge
is $45 to $60 for a dog, depending on size;
$35 for a cat. Ashes will be delivered to
the owner if desired.

3. If burial is preferred, we refer the owner
to one of several cemeteries on Long Island
or in Westchester.

Bite cases

hile a New York Ci y law requires that
all animals accused of biting must be exam-
ined by a veterinarian, the ASPCA has no
jurisdiction in these cases. They are handled
by the Department of Health.

But the ASPCA does provide the Depart-
ment of Health W1th free space in our ﬁve
borough shelters for examining animals ac-

the clock with a resident manager in at-
tendance.

Since it opened in 1958 this two-story
shelter has cared for 125,000 walking, ﬂying
and slithering animals. Included were more
than 100 different types of fauna from
skunks, polar bears, foxes, leopards, chin-
chillas and monkeys, to anteaters, lions, tigers,
elephants, cattle, sheep and lizards.

Most of the exotic animals are imported
from Asia, Africa and Europe by zoos and
dealers. Many animals are exported by cattle
breeders to needy peoples abroad. Race
horses traveling between tracks in the U. S.
and Europe are frequent stop-over guests.

Ninety percent of the dogs belong to CI’s
in Europe. When they get transferred to the
U. S. they send their pets home by air ex-
press. Sometimes they arrive days after their
pets and the dogs have to wait.

Dogs, cats and other small animals are
housed in individual kennels with adjoining
outdoor runs. There are 12 box stalls for
horses which can be converted into a large
indoor corral for farm animals. Horses are
exercised in a spacious outdoor paddock.

There is a temperature-controlled section
for tropical birds and animals, isolation cages
for the sick and injured, a fully-equipped
veterinary clinic, indoor and outdoor load-
ing areas and a dietary kitchen with a
freezer and electric stove. Diets prepared in
this kitchen range from live meal worms for
foxes to bamboo roots for pandas, raw meat
for lions and alfalfa for elephants. We pro-
cure health certiﬁcates and supply traveling
crates.

Rates vary according to the size and type
of animal. For further information about the

ecause we believe that teaching children
kindness to animals can have far-reaching
effects, we place great emphasis on our edu-
cation program. Children who have developed
an understanding of animals grow into more
responsible, compassionate adults.

One way in which we encourage children
to become interested in animals is our Junior
Membership program, open to individual
children under 18 and organized groups of
children such as Scouts, Campﬁre Girls, Y’s,
and other community groups. Dues are $1 a
year for an individual or for the entire
group.

All Juniors and Junior Groups receive:

1. Subscriptions to the ASPCA magazine
ANIMAL PROTECTION and ASPCA NEWS
BULLETIN.

2. A visit by appointment on Saturday to our
Manhattan Shelter and Hospital at 441
East 92nd Street, consisting of:

AFRICA 9s
i f   _  WILDERNESS
BABIES

one of the'worlld’s biggest “nurs-
cries.” ---— as large as New Jersey
“is ﬁlled with animal babies whose
antics and peccadillos would surprise
and bafﬂe even the most. knowledgeable
humanijmother. This king-size play pen
for the wilderness younger set is South
Africa’s famed Kruger Park, where
fascinated visitors from all over the
world observe four-legged youngsters
romping, dining and being trained by
their parents. ' ' ‘

,Playful as pups, young elephants
have to learn the digniﬁed bearing that
characterizes theirelders. They’re real
“cry babies,” especially if separated
from mother. The elephants outgrow
this stage fairly quickly however. At
the age of 12 or 13, they’re ready to
have families of their own.

It’s been said that giraffes can’t utter
sounds-é—can’t “talk.” ‘Vell, a baby
giraffe does i “cry for mama” with a
bleating sound like a Sheep’s. The baby
giraffe’s bleat islapt to be heard loud
and clear and often, eSpecially when
one comes face to face with; an ele-
phant. Then mama comes to the res-
cue, shielding her offspring between
her long forelegs. Even mama’s vocal
chords can function when necessary.
But her- powers 0f "discernment were
questioned' when one female giraffe
was seen feeding a zebra foal that had
lost its mother.» , ‘ ,

Little hippOs (40 pounds at birth)
are the submarines of the animal king-
dom. Before weaning, they feed under-
water, surfacing every few seconds for
air. After feeding time, mama hippo
settles her massive frame on the muddy
bottom of her lake or pond home and
her offspring climbs aboard, riding
hippo-back until he’s old enough to
travel on his own and defend himself
against the more aggressive water in-
habitants «- the crocodiles.

To the uninitiated observer, it would

seem that the crocodile cats with great
compassion for the unfortunate crea-
ture he has selected for his dinner.
All through his meal, crocodile tears
ﬂow. But Mr. Crock isn’t sobbing from
pangs of conscience. Swallowing is so
great an effort that his eyes bulge out
and he sheds copious tears.

At birth, crocOdiles are no more
than, a few inches long. They have a
constant struggle“ to keep themselves
out of the gaping'maws of adult creeks
and hawks who feed: on them and keep
their numbers within limits.

When lion cubs are born —--- three to
four in a litter -- they’re cOV'ered with
leopard-like dark. spots. Mother is very
strict about the hours her young keep;
as a matter of fact, she doesn’t permit
them to leave the cave until they’re
over two months old.

Then, stepping along in the tracks
of their mother and usually an older
sister, the little lions get a liberal two-
year education in the life of the jungle.
In order to groOm each. litter properly
for adulthood, a female lion doesn’t
have cubs more often than every two
years.

While lion babies are on the prowl,
the other mothers are not idle, especi-
ally the zebras and wildebeests. Their
offspring must learn to protect them-
selves from the king of beasts and his
royal family. This is accomplished by
an alliance between zebras, most alert
during the day, and wildebeests, whose
eyes are open widest at night.

The smallest of all little ones at
Kruger is the pigmy shrew. Mother
weighs in at one-seventh of an ounce.
Her offspring barely tips the scales.

These animal babies roam unre-
strained in the wildlife reserve. They
can be seen through almost every
clump of bushes, on every open plain
—— their almost human antics often
heartwarming, sometimes hilarious.

 




 

Your pet can live longer and be healthier, if you know

othing, it seems, is too good for man’s
best friend, the dog. Every year hun-
dreds of millions of dollars are spent on pre-
pared dog foods, not to mention unusual ac-
coutrements for the dog who has everything.

There’s a company that prints greeting
cards for dogs. You can buy pajamas and
raincoats, diamond-studded collars, silver
clips, and even mutt-ernity clothes. Or maybe
you need a mustache bowl to keep the dog’s
whiskers out of his water.

In the health ﬁeld there are canine blood
banks, X-rays for dogs, expert surgery and
all sorts of medicines.

But big business and modern science can’t
do everything. There’s no injection that will
keep your dog from racing after cars, and
no pill to make your pooch fond of you. You
must do your share.

Meet your veterinarian

To prevent trouble, it’s a good idea to take
a puppy to a veterinarian every two or three
months. A grown dog should make a visit
every six months to a year.

A puppy should receive at least two inocu-
lations from a veterinarian—one against
rabies, another against distemper, which
kills more pets than any other illness. Other
inoculations include infectious hepatitis and
leptospirosis, both potential killers.

Puppies should be examined for worms at
two months of age and dewormed if neces-
sary. This should be done by a veterinarian,
as promiscuous deworming may be very dan-
gerous.

Today’s veterinarian has access to an
amazing array of potential drugs. Many,
including tranquilizers, antibiotics and ster-
oid hormone compounds, were adapted from
drugs that have worked wonders in human

medicine. Others were developed exclusively
for veterinary practice and have no compar-
able application in humans.

In the latter category is a new compound
called Prodox, which, given either as pills or
drops, delays heat in female dogs for as long
as the owner chooses to give a daily dose.
The effect is “planned puppyhood.” That is,
the owner can schedule the arrival of new
litters only when he wants them. While she’s
taking the drug, the female doesn’t attract
male dogs and is not interested in mating.
Stop giving it and she goes back to her nor~
mal ways and can bear normal pups.

Another recent product on the market is
an oral insecticide—a sugar coated tablet
fed to the dog in his food. Thereafter, when
fleas and ticks feel inclined to bite man’s best
friend, the parasites die. Called Ectoral, the
pill is available only from a veterinarian.

What you can do

When working with a veterinarian, tell
him the facts about your dog’s condition.
Don’t say your dog is the same—~keep a
record of his temperature, how much he eats,
etc. And follow his advice to the letter. A
true dog lover should know almost as much
about caring for his dog as a mother knows
about raising an infant. And yet many dog
owners make the same mistakes year in and
year out. Here are some essential rules:

Exercise. The key word is regularity.
Two or three walks daily are better than
a wild romp over the Weekend. And walk
your dog as far as you can without getting
tired. Your guide should be the length of
your dog’s legs: the longer they are, the
more he can walk. But don’t exercise your
dog right after or before meals, or during

hours a day, between 2 pm. and 4 p.m.,
when an owner can call and inquire about
the patient. Each veterinarian has a tele-
phone hour daily when owners can talk
directly with him. Staff members are not
permitted to prescribe over the telephone.

We can seldom schedule the exact hour of
an operation because accident cases, recent
fractures and other emergencies have priority.

Animals suffering from contagious diseases
such as canine hepatitis, canine distemper
and feline enteritis, are isolated in a special
ward to prevent the spread of these diseases
to other hospitalized patients. Separated from
the rest of the hospital, the Daynemouth
Ward was made possible by a donor whose
particular interest is the control of commun-
icable diseases.

Because cases treated in this area are
highly contagious, preventing the spread of
disease is of utmost importance. Therefore,
owners are not permitted to visit animals in
this ward. But they can see their pets through
a plate glass window and communicate with
them over a two-way radio.

We have ﬁve shelters in New York City,
one in each borough. The four-ﬂoor Manhat-
tan Shelter houses our hospital and admin-
istrative ofﬁces. The newest New York City
shelter is our modern red-brick Bronx
Shelter, erected in 1956 to replace an old,
outmoded building.

By contrast, the Queens Shelter, in a pic-
turesque, rustic setting, includes a 100-year-
old farm house which serves as an adoption
ward. Three other buildings house the ken-
nels, license ofﬁce and garage. The 29-year-
old Brooklyn Shelter, which cared for nearly
52,000 animals last year, handles more ani-
mals than any other shelter in the country.
The vine-covered shelter in Richmond, built
in 1935, is a landmark known to almost
every resident on Staten Island.

These are the services performed in these

shelters. (For services in Nassau and West-
chester see “Shelters Outside New York
City,” page 25.)

A cherished pet becomes too old or hope-
lessly ill. A family is moving and can’t take
the pet along to the new home. An unwanted
litter of kittens becomes a burden. In all
these cases the ASPCA stands ready to help.
All our shelters accept any animal brought
in any time of day or night at no charge.
Our ﬂeet of 34 ambulances will also call at
homes for unwanted animals. The animals
are then put up for adoption, or painlessly
put to sleep, according to the owner’s re-
quest. So many owners have a change of
heart after offering a pet for a new home
that we hold all such animals for 24 hours
before putting them up for adoption. This
gives the original owner a chance to reclaim
his pet.

For many years the ASPCA didn’t charge
for home pick-ups. But we often had to make
two or three calls for one animal—some
owners changed their minds, others weren’t
home, or gave pets to neighbors, and still

others brought animals to the shelters before
we got to their homes.

And so in 1954, because of the increasing
cost of duplicate calls, it became a question
of eliminating home pick-ups entirely, or
making a nominal charge. (Many animal
welfare organizations do not call at homes
for animals.) We decided to charge a $1 fee
for each call for unlicensed dogs, cats, birds
or any other animal. Licensed dogs in the
ﬁve boroughs are called for at no charge.
The fee now pays for about one quarter the
cost of the pick-up service.

Last year our ambulances answered
85,323 calls for unwanted animals, an aver-
age of about 233 a day. Over 45,000 animals
were brought to the shelters by owners.

Of the 160,222 animals handled in our
shelters last year 80 percent were put to
sleep. While this may seem like a high per-
centage, the fact is many of these unfortu-
nate animals were in ill health or were too
old to be accepted into new homes. The prin-
cipal reason for the high percentage, how-
ever, is that the majority—95,066—were
put to sleep at their owners’ request. The
decompression method used is, in our opin-

9 am. to 4 p.m. daily, except Sundays and

holidays.

There are many animals to choose from.
But since our population is constantly chang-
ing, you may not ﬁnd just the right animal
on your first visit. If not, come back as often
as you like, or try one of the other shelters.

When you’ve made your selection, we’ll
ask you a few questions, such as:

' Does the whole family want the pet? A
house divided does not make a satisfactory
adoption.

0 Is your house large enough? A two-room
apartment with a large family leaves no
room for a big dog.

0 Are you healthy enough and do you have
the time to give a dog enough exercise?

0 Will the pet have companionship, or will
it be left alone to how] or meow all day?
If we both agree that the adoption is suit-

able, you will be asked to sign a form which
stipulates, among other things, that if for
some reason you can’t keep the pet, you will
return it to us.

Although we take every reasonable precau-
tion to guard the health of the animal you
adopt, we can’t guarantee that it does not
harbor a disease. So each adopted animal is
entitled to a free examination and one serum
inoculation against communicable diseases.
We urge you to take advantage of this ser-
vice at the ASPCA Hospital on the day of
adoption. But if that’s impossible, you may
bring your pet in within two weeks after
adoption, any day, except Saturday, Sunday
or holiday. Regular hospital hours are from
9 am. to 4:30 p.m. We also offer free advice
and a booklet on the care of your new pet.

 

To prevent the birth of unwanted puppies
and kittens, we recommend that adopted male
and female cats and female dogs be altered.
If the surgery is done in our hospital, the
Society will bear all hospital costs (except
the surgical charge) up to the time the doc-
tor recommends that the animal be dis-
charged. The costs which are included free
cover hospitalization, examination, entrance,
drug and inoculation fees.

Application for the alteration surgery must
be made within two weeks after adoption.
However, since some animals are too young
for this surgery at the time of adoption, we
give owners four months after application in
which to take advantage of the service.

s our name implies preventing cruelty is
one of our most important jobs. The Society
was founded originally to curb the cruelty to
work horses so prevalent in the 19th century.
We are still protecting horses with regular
inspections of stables, bridle paths, riding
academies and dray horses, watching for
saddle sores, overriding and other abuses.

Around the turn of the century, there were
about 115,000 horses in New York City.
Today there are fewer than 2,000. The re-
