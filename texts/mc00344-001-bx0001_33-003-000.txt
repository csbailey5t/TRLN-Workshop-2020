Door Hrs. Pfleegor,

Mrs. Stevens is in Washington and has asked me to answer
your kind letter of last month. Let me first apologize
for taking so long to reply. we have boon terribly buoy
at this office with roquests for information on the recent
introduction of the laboratory animals bill and my oorres~
pondenoe has fallen.very far behind.

The report written by Dr. Carding on the animals in Greece
has attracted attention from our members, some of whom have
written to ask how they could help the Greek Animal Welfare
Fund, the organization headed by Mrs. Eleanor Close. We
have been suggesting that they send oontrhbutions directly
to ﬁre. Close, whose address is Amalias 34, Athens, 119,
Greece. I am sure ﬁre. Close, who is a tireless worker
for the cause of animal welfare, would be delighted to
receive any amount you felt able to send. As you know,
animal welfare work has a long way to go in Greece.

are known to have an interest in our work, may I suggest that

they are alwqys more apt to pay attention to a listener, a

private indidduel who writes them, than to a society with

vested interests, as it were. Thoroforo, I am sending you

In connection with Miss Juno Havoc, I don't know whether you
receive her television show (which is seen Saturday nights
from ten to eleven hero in New Ybrk), but this eeoing March
27th show will feature interviews with Senator Joseph Clark
and Mrs. Stevens, along with oovoral others.

we do now hove a bill in the House, identical to the Clark bill

Dear Mrs. Stevens -

I know you are very busy, and hate to bother you with correspondene
which requires any answer, but another woman and I were so

upset about the article in your last Report regarding treatment of
animals generally, as well as in labs, in Greece. I wrote asking
if we could donate something toward this work, and if so, to whom
should it be forwarded. Thought maybe my letter may have
gotten mislaid, and still would like to help some in this situation

if possible. I realize we have much work to do in our own

country, and especially as you will note from recent news releases
about a case in Boyertown, Pa. (man charged with gross cruelty

to hundreds of animals which he was selling to labs, case investigated
by the H. S. U. S. , Washington) - in Pennsylvania, where we are

in the process of attempting to assure passage of new laws regarding
animal cruelty. So, while there is much to do here, I still think
of those animals so much worse/\in a place such as Greece. If there
is anything we can do, or a donation we might send to help, would
you please let me know.

Very best wishes to you in your good work.

Sincerely,

/_,
. Pfleegor

Dear Mrs. Stevens: {14’ M4% ”41/4

I feel sometimes like the ostrich - want to stick my head in the sand
so I won't hear or see any more unpleasantness. As I know you

are aware, one is at times overwhelmed with a sense of near-
defeatism as regards these needy and mistreated animals everywhere.
It seems the small percentage of us who care have been working,
writing, spending our time and money over a period of years,

and we make slow progress, but always there mumore unbelievably
cruel and needy situations.

I just finished reading your latest bulletin, and am heartsick at
the treatment and attitude towards animals in Greece. I wish
very much there were something I could personally do to help,
and in this regard am wondering if you have any plans for for-
warding money to Mrs. Eleanor Close. If so, I would like to add
a little. I give to so many different animal welfare groups,
including some overseas in Japan, Alaska, and Africa along

with my special local projects that, regretably I could not add

a great deal but would like to send something to help in this
terrible situation.

It is a crying shame when one thinks of all the money in the world,
especially in this country, that more people cannot feel inclined
to help relieve such wholesale suffering. Have you sent this
write-up to such people as Jack Paar, Arthur Godfrey, Gypsy Rose
Lee, June Havoc, Peggy Lee, Elizabeth Taylor, Peggy Kast,
Hermonie Gingold, to name a few of means, who are well-known
to be kindly inclined towards animals. They probably have acquaintances
who would contribute.

If you will let me know how to do this, I want to send a small check
on to you or directly to Mrs. Close towards this great work which
she has most admirably undertaken. Hope you will keep us informed
too of any progress in Greece.

Am continuing also with the letters to our Congressmen to fight for
decent treatment to lab animals in our country.

Best regards.
Sincerely,

\_/

Dear Mrs . Stevens: -

Sometimes I think I should not pick up a newspaper and read

it; the re is invariably a distressing story about animals some-
whe re , and it is so disheartening. I don't know if I should
further disturb you with these clippings, but on the possibility
that you may know someone - or some organization which could
be of help in these pitiful matters, I feel compelled to send
these on to you. I don't know what possibly could be done here ,
but needless to say, I hope the plan to eliminate all dogs is a
wholesale flop. They are so wrong in their contention about
dogs spreading disease. It is more likely there that the humans
are the ones distributing the disease germs.

Best regards.

P. S. The thought occurred to me that perhaps Mr. Adlai Stevenson
might be prevailed upon to speak a word to the prOper person
against the above program. Do you think he would consider this ?

 




Mrs . Stevens - —

For your interest. This brought to my mind the legislation
introduced regarding the importation of wild animals into this
country (H. R. 1839), and perhaps this item might be used to
further strenghthen the argument to discourage the importing
of such creatures by unfeeling Americans for profit.

Dear Mrs. Ste vens:

I really am embarrassed to be bothering you again. It seems every time I pick
up a magazine or newspaper, there is another account or picture of an animal

-- wild or domestic - in some distress. It is a constant source of sadness to
those of us who feel so deeply for the helpless creatures involved. You feel
compelled to do whatever possible in each case; however, the situations become
mountainous, as there is never an end to it. No matter how discouraged I
become though, I am always willing to stay in pitching if there is anything
possible to do to help. Too bad there are so many peOple who are not moved
whatsoever by an animal‘s plight; there would not be so much for the few

of us to do.

You will be interested in the attached. I hope it is okay that I took the liberty
of mentioning your name. Frankly, I am sure nothing will come of my
letter to NEWSWEEK other than the usual ”thank you” letter. However, I
wish they would at least publish it in the ”Letters to the Editor" column,

if for no other reason than perhaps certain peOple in other States may be
interested in our local game—feeding program. Of course, in such a
winter as this, it cannot be more than a help to just some; all cannot be
reached. But one feels somewhat better for helping even a few in their
time of need. This section of Pennsylvania is very mountainous and
abounds with game. Personally, I detest hunting, but it is considered among
the best in hunting country. Each Sunday several friends, my husband and
I go far back into the woods to stock three feeders with food, which feeders
we have maintained for several years now during winter. You would be
astounded at the many, many tracks in the snow of animals which come
regularly to these feeders for food during the bad months; all kinds of
animals and birds. The Wild Game Feeders Association, which I
mention in my letter to NEWSWEEK, is conducted similarly to our own
little ”private” feeding project. It is a most commendable idea, and could
be adopted by other groups elsewhere with the necessary persons to set up
the program, which actually involves little work. I am employed at AVCO
Corporation (our main office is in N. Y. C. at 750 Third Ave. ), and a great
many of the workers in the Association are employed here.

I sent a letter on this picture also to Mr. Owen B. Hunt, Pres. , AV, Phila.
I am on their mailing list (although not an antiavivisectionist), and as you
may know, last Dec. Mr. Hunt instituted a program (in their periodical) for
raising money to help the Alaskan sled dogs over the extreme winter months.
In their last booklet I read that $ 1, 700 had been raised for the purpose. So
thought perhaps Mr. Hunt might want to help the deer, if possible.

Sometimes it is just a matter of bringing before the public .. that part of it

which is humane - these situations, and many people are willing to help.
Would be glad to hear from you. Best wishes. 7w, , ', 7

Dead of Winter: Europe’s grimmest cold wave in living memory
continues in spite of an occasional thaw; after weeks of sub-
zero temperatures, deer still ﬂoundered neck-high in Bavarian snow-
drifts searching for food. The deer died by the hundreds. The cold
spell’s toll of human lives stood at 1,500. In some areas, melting snow
and ice swelled streams and rivers, threatening fresh disaster.

Dear Sir:

'I justnoted, with a great deal of sadness, the'extremely touching picture of
the deer up to their necks in snow in the Bavarian section of Germany - your
Feb. 25th issue.

I am indeed aware of the suffering caused to both humans and animals by this
miserable "worst in a century" winter. However, I am hastening to suggest

to you that some campaign be initiated to aid these poor creatures. If I may
briefly describe to you our local program for helping the wildulife thru the
winter -- A group of several hundred members (sportsmen and humane-
minded peeple) several years ago formed the "Wild Game Feeders Association".
Money is solicited, and a contribution of $ 1. 00 makes one a member of the
Association. All money collected is used to purchase feed for the wild

animals during the severe winter months, and the work of building the feeders
as well as stocking them with food each week-end is done by volunteers.

This program has been in successful Operation for several years, and all
involved are most happy about its results. The fact that many people join
together in a good'cause makes for enthusiasm, which is always necessary

in such an undertaking. The program has been responsible for much wild—-

life having been saved from starvation in this section of Pennsylvania. Once
the program is in Operation. it should, of course. always be continued thru all
the bad winter months. '

I realize the foregoing may not be a feasible plan for the part of Germany

where the animals are pictured. However, may I suggest that you follow

up this picture with a request to your readers for financial help to buy food

for these distressed animals. There are humane organizations in other
countries similar to those in the U.S. , which are hon est and reliable and

which could be counted upon to use the money for the purpose it was contributed.
The names of such overseas groups can be obtained from the New York 5. P. C. A.
or more personally from Mrs. Christine Stevens, Society for Animal Protective
Legislation, 745 Fifth Ave. , New York City.

 




nun-2‘

I feel firmly convinced that if you will publish a follow-sup to this picture,
naming the organization to which contributions may be made to aid these
animals, many people would be glad to know of it. Incidentally, I am not
speaking only of the ”crackpots" about animals. These people just happen to
be the ones who have ample sympathy and feeling for all suffering, human and
that also of God's "lesser creatures". They are the same people who
contribute most heavily to all worthwhile human causes.

As a final request. if the foregoing suggestion does not meet with your approval,
would you kindly either publish or send to me personally the name of an
individual or organization where a contribution might be sent. This, I assume,
could be obtained from the newspaper or person responsible for the picture.
That organization or person might also have suggestions of means to help

these animals.

Please let me hear from you at your earliest convenience as it is such an
urgent matter to get help to these animals at the soonest possible time.
Thank you.

Sincerely ,

I"

Honorable Kenneth Roberts

Dear Congressman Roberts:

I am writing you to express not only my personal grateful thanks, but
that of a large number of other Williamsport, Pennsylvania, citizens
for your handling of the recent hearings regarding H. R. Bill #1937,
providing for .the humane treatment of laboratory animals. We are
not .radicalf'peOple in this issue; not anti-vivisectionists. We
realize, perhaps reluctantly, that experimental surgery must, of
necessity, be performed on animals. However, it is an indisputable
fact also that such ani mals must be entitled to and receive every
possible decent care and treatment. It is unthinkable that such

is not so in any institution permitted to use live animals.

Pets are a vital and necessary part of the American way of life.
Anyone who has known the loyal and unquestioning love and deVotion

of one, particularly a dog, is saddened immensely at the thought of
other less fortunate animals being subjected to indecent treatment at
the hands of peeple who have become calloused and indifferent to
suffering because the sufferers are ”only animals". I truly believe
our Creator himself, as well as the multitude of conscientious pe0ple,
frowns upon such phi1080phy.

The humane peOple in our country, however, are much encouraged by
the recent developments on behalf of such defenseless animals, and it

is our sincere and fervent hope that during the next session of Congress
an effective Bill to insure proper care and treatment of these animals
will become a reality speedily.

Thank you very much for your good efforts in this cause, and may we
ask and hope for your continued and extended support in the future to
insure early enactment of this legislation.

Sincerely,

Dear Mrs . Stevens:

With reference to copy of letter I forwarded you protesting the program on
the tiger hunt in India, enclosed is the reply I received from Phillips Petro-
leum Co. I have a c0py of this, so no need to return.

In your letter you mentioned the bullfighting program on Feb. 2.. I did not
have the TV on that particular day, but if you have a minute to let me know
whether or not the TV program actually took place, I will be very glad to
write a letter of protest. I think it is terribly discouraging that the TV
producers Will continue to push bullfighting when they are very well
aware of the general feeling among Americans towards this "spectacle".
On another program I recall that mention was made of the terrific traffic
across the Mexican border on Sunday afternoons, caused by Americans
going there for the bullfights. This astounded me, however, I never cease
to be amazed at the heartlessness of humans in such matters.

One other thought I wanted to convey to you along dis-similar lines -

and this is heartening even though it involves just one personality -

I watched the "TONIGHT'l (Johnny Carson) show last night, and Jayne
Mansfield, the movie star, was a guest. She mentioned that she is
extremely fond of animals - owns 28 of them herself, including dogs, cats,
mynah bird, and an ocelot. Her ambition prior to becoming an actress
was to be a veterinarian, and she worked for one as a young girl. She
mentioned that she "loves animals and likes to help them". I felt you
would want to add her name to your mailing list - unless she is already on.

With best wishes .

I have your letter of January 22 written about

Lancaster, which we sponsor.

‘we certainly can appreciate your feeling
regarding this show; even though I personally have not seen
it. 'We appreciate your taking the time to write us about it.

As you may know we buy programs on the various
stations many times before the complete cycle of shows is
completed and consequently do not have the opportunity of
seeing all of the shows before they are on the air. 'We find
it hard to control the contents of each individual show and
occasionally one of the caliber you describe is on the air
without our approval.

we will take this up with the station and we
want to thank you again for your friendly interest and for
writing us. ‘we sincerely hope you will continue to watch
our show and patronize Phillips 66 stations.

Dear Mrs . Stevens:

Attached is article which will interest you. What a pity that women of
good financial status and ”fashion houses" in the cities mentioned are so
vainly and selfishly concerned with imitating others as to be completely
insensitive to the pain and suffering caused to unfortunate creatures on
their account. Such a show of inhumanity indicates a decadent and most
regretful attitude on their part - and worse yet, on the part of the
mercenary and heartless "hunters" so greedy that they too feel nothing
for the lives of the beautiful creatures whose lives they take.

The three famous ladies mentioned are, I believe, all fond of animals,
and perhaps were this situation called to each one‘s personal attention,
she would in some way aid in remedying the situation. I have written
the Humane Society in Washington (H. S. U. S.) asking that they bring this
matter to the personal attention of Mrs. Kennedy. I hope she will be
willing to help in some way.

Have you any contact with the Royal S. P. C. A. in London, and if so,
would you bring this matter to their attention (if it has not already been
done). Perhaps they can request the help of Princess Margaret. Also,
possibly they can locate Miss Taylor, who seems to be romping about
somewhere in Europe.

Maybe too you might be able to prevail upon some of the more compassionate
peOple in the fashion industry in New York to help alleviate this sad

situation (if indeed there are any such peOple in this business).

With very best wishes.

Sincerely, 'i

African Leopards Now in Jeopardy

From column written by Hy Gardner

‘ Bill Holden, who filmed "The Lion" near Nairobi, Africa,
insists this story is true, that local authorities are grappling
with a puzzling situation placed squarely at the doorstep of
Jackie Kennedy, Elizabeth Taylor, and Princiss Margaret.
Ever since this threesome of fetching females was photo-o
graphed wearing leopard coats, flyabyanight hunters have
stampeded the jungle trying to cash in on the tremendous
demand for such skins by fashion houses in Paris, London,
Rome, and New York. The result has been the trapping
and slaughtering of thousands of the animals which never

change their spots" .

Attention: Advertising Mgr.
Gentlemen:

I am writing with reference to a television program entitled ”The Story of

a Tiger Hunter", shown last Monday evening, January 21, and sponsored

by the Phillips Company (Phillips 66 Gasoline). I sincerely trust you will

not consider the thinking expressed in my letter presumptuous or belligerent.

I felt. on the other hand, you would be interested in the reaction to programs on
which your company spends large sums of money for advertising purposes.

We did not find the subject program at all entertaining. As you might assume,
our family is very fond of animals, and whether justified or not (in the

story, the killing of the tiger was warranted as he was molesting a village

of natives in India), the step by step progression of the hunting and final
shooting of the tiger, including the picture of the poor creature lying in the
throes of death £1125 killed instantly or quickly because too many bullet holes
would no doubt spoil the trophy) was not pleasant to witness. Such
presentations are distasteful to many peeple of any age, and especially to
youngsters, and leave the viewing audience in a very morose frame of mind.

 

This story. which was based on the exploits of Mr. William Holmes, big-game
hunter. was not conducive to the teaching of humanity to all living creatures.
To kill for food is one thing - a necessity; to kill for the sole purpose of
taking the life of a creature to obtain a "trephy" is another - and not at all
admirable or commendable. The choice remark of the entire show came

at the end when Mr. Holmes said he did not feel at all elated at having ,
killed this "magnificent creature; his grievous comment implied that he

felt some remorse at having taken its life. However, the final scene,

‘ displaying his room-full of huge, stuffed animals would hardly indicate he

felt any reverence for the lives of these once beautiful. wild creatures.

In any case. the program was not enjoyable.

May I respectfully suggest that your good organization not spend its

money to pay for programs such as this one. Most everyone finds stories
dealing with animals most delightful. but not shows which involve callousness
towards them, whether the killing is of necessity or not. Most "big kids"

do not like this any better than the "little kids'iike it. L ‘




0n the subject on wild animal storieo, I realize that life in Africa cud
other such countries can be distinctly cruel and secmimgly heartless
according to our standards; however, there are many good programs
depicting the work currently being conducted in Africa, etc. , having

to do with the conservation of these animals which afford much welcome
viewing. More such programs wOuld be appreciated.

I earnestly hope you will find the foregoing of interest.

Very sincerely,

I am personally acquainted with the Manager of this

which you sent to me. I suggested that he pass this literature
on to the proper persons in the ”Science Fair” set-up at the
"kick-off dinner" on October 16, and said that additional

c opies are available upon request. I thought, however, I would
advise your organization of the forthcoming annual "Science
Fair", and if you follow the procedure of providing any
pamphlets to such gatherings, you may want to do so in this
case. I believe if such literature would be mailed to Mr.

or little wild creature. My only recourse is to bother a veterinarian
friend for the answers. So I would very much appreciate having

a copy of your booklet.

Dear Mrs . Stevens:

I look forward with much interest to your periodic bulletins, and the last one
is outstanding. Truly, however, I so love animals (and do all I personally can
to help them), that I am much distressed and heartsick about the write-ups of
actual, authenticated reports of base cruelty and neglect in the various schools
and institutions you described. It makes one not only intensely angry but
somewhat discouraged when you think of the vast effort throughout the country
on the part of the humane societies and individuals to better the lives of these
poor creatures, that such unspeakable treatment should be accorded them

by unfeeling scientists and doctors for whom we are supposed to hold the
greatest respect. ‘

May I make the suggestion that a c0py of this bulletin, citing the actual
conditions observed by your personnel, be sent to every member of Congress
with the plea that he take the time to read it unbiasedly. Perhaps also Mr.
Adlai Stevenson, with his tremendous influence, might be prevailed upon

to personally help distribute the copies to various Congressmen - if this

idea might be more practical. It just seems more urgent than ever that

any possible move in the direction of helping these pitiful creatures should
be made. I hope this suggestion is not out- of-line. I am today forwarding
my copy of the bulletin to Congressman Herman Schneebeli in Washington,
whose home, incidentally, is in Williamsport. I have contacted him pre-
viously, and he has stated he is sympathetic to our cause. It is my feeling
that even though many of the Congressmen may lean toward passage of

either the Griffith or Moulder Bill, they are reluctant to openly oppose the
American Medical Association and all its power. Do you think this is so?
For this reason, I believe that if the actual case facts, such as you presented
in the last bulletin, along with much more of the same, can be brought to
their personal attention, this will be the only hope for any possibility of
success. I wish a number of them could be persuaded to visit some of the
laboratories you described, without any prior knowledge of the laboratories

Also regarding the available copies of ”statement of Dr. W. W. Armistead,
Dean of the College of Veterinary Medicine of Michigan State University" , to
be used as a guide by all teachers of high school biology, may I suggest that
you forward several c0pies to: "Official in charge of the Susquehanna Science
Fair, c/o Bucknell University, Lewisburg, Pennsylvania". There is held
annually at Bucknell University a so- called ”outstanding" science fair, and I
do not know how th,eﬁthing is conduct ed, but there are apparently displays and
exhibits from many“ c 0013 in the general area. Perhaps the person in charge
of the arrangements for the fair at the university would be willing to pass

on to the proper peOple at the schools participating the copies of your write-up
as it is very commendable.

With best regards .
Sincerely,

Dear Mis s Stevens:

Enclosed is c0py of letter I received from Congress H. T.
Schneebeli of Pennsylvania, in which I thought you would
be interested. It is regretable that neither the Moulder
Bill or Representative Griffiths' bill appears to be
scheduled for hearings in the foreseeable future. I
sincerely hOpe for some action soon to protect the animals
in question.

I was, however, glad to see that Congressman Schneebeli 's
sympathy appears to tend toward support of any legislation
to protect lab animals.

I want to take this opportunity to thank you for sending to me
the reports of the Japan Animal Welfare Society, which were
most interesting - although depressing. I have sent them
another small contribution towards their very great work.

With very best regards.

Sincerely,

Mrs. Christine Stevens

Dear Mrs . Stevens:

Enclosed is copy of my letter to James Stewart regarding
his wild-game hunting expedition. I first wrote a quite
critical, and I must admit rather nasty letter as I was so
thoroughly disgusted with the newspaper account of his
and his wife's remarks. However, I assumed that his
secretary would only dispOSe of it without his even
reading it (which is what will possibly happen anyhow)

so re-wrote the letter in somewhat more restrained
language to perhaps at least assure their seeing it.

Thank you for writing these peOple from the society.

Am enclosing copy of the subject article, as READER'S

DIGEST sent several copies. Also, for your interest,

copies of some of the correspondence involved. Believe

I previously mentioned to you that I had forwarded a copy of the article
to Mr. William Hendrix who writes the column ”You and

Your Animals" for the NEW YORK DAILY MIRROR.

Sincerely.

encls .

P. S. This ”foreign problem" brought to mind the Japanese laboratory animals on
which you published a pictorial report several years ago and about which we had
some correspondence. Have wondered if there is any recent news regarding this
pitiful situation. I and another woman in Williamsport have sent contributions -
about six times - of $ 5 and $ 10 each time over the last years to the Japan
organization. Know this is not much, but trust it has been of some help. They have
always written appreciative replies. Is Mrs. Parrott still actiVe?

 




1245 Louisa St.
W illiamsport, Pennsylvania

Mr. James Stewart
Box 550 ..
Beverly Hills, Calif.

Dear Mr. Stewart:

Several weeks ago I read an article in the newspaper describing your and
your wife's wild-game hunting expedition in Africa, which disappointed me
greatly. I had always admired you both as a star and as a person, but to
learn that you and Mrs. Stewart are part of that relatively small group of
Americans who hunt animals for the sole pleasure of taking their lives
comes as an extreme and most unpleasant surprise.

I have been interested in animal welfare, as well as human welfare, for

many years and have read several most authentic articles on the subject

of the very real danger of many of the wild and beautiful creatures of Africa
being completely extinct in the near future. As you may be aware, this is
due, in the greater part, to the natives who kill indiscriminately and illegally.
They are offered small sums of money for certain parts of the animals, such
as skins or ivory, and in their limited state of intelligence and knowledge,

do not realize the overall tragic result which occurs when vast numbers of
animals are needlessly killed. Added to thi s is, of course, their need for
food. So all considered, their part in this great slaughter is somewhat
excusable, at least until such time as their education and environmental
circumstances are improved. However, for Americans to add to this pitiful
situation of the eventual extinction of these animals for the sole pleasure of
having something novel or different to do with their time and money is
extremely offensive.

I took the time to write the READER'S DIGEST for a re-print of the article
entitled ”Last Chance for Africa's Wild Animals", enclosed. I do hope both
you and Mrs. Stewart will take the time to read the impressive information'
contained therein. As stated, ”legalized" killing is controlled and apparently
not the larger problem; however, after you are familiar with all the facts
concerning the plight of the African animals, you may re-consider your plans
for a future trip to Africa to unnecessarily kill more creatures which are
have an exceedingly difficult time to even survive under the ordinary, adverse
conditions to be found there.

 




I think it regretable that you and Mrs. Stewart let it be publicly known that
you not only find great pleasure in killing such animals, but that you no longer
even know what to do with your trOphies - to the point of giving them away to
others. One who is truly compassionate is aware that anything ~ human or
animal - cherishes life to the utmost. I feel sure you possess such compassion
for humans; I hope very much you will extend the same consideration to
animals. I trust too that you will be sufficiently impressed by the article
enclosed to put aside any future plans for hunting these magnificent creatures
found only in Africa. and join, instead, with those of us who are putting forth
sincere and best efforts to help save and preserve these beautiful animals

for future generations to behold and to enjoy. In this direction, may I
suggest a contribution to the ”Water for Wild Animals" fund, referred to

at the conclusion of the article. I sent a check, as have several other
sympathetic people in Williamsport here. It may interest you to know that

the READER'S DIGEST article has met with surprising reader interest

and response from many Americans as well as from benevolent peOple

in other countries. May I suggest that you also add your support by

passing on this article enclosed to others interested.

I earnestly h0pe this letter has acquainted you with noteworthy facts of
which you may not have been aware.

With best wishes .

Sincerely yours ,

(Mrs.) C.A. Pfleegor, Jr.

Dear Era. Pfleegcr,

,Thanks for sending thc clippings. Enclosad is a letter
I have written to the Stewarts. Because it is from the
Institute it must be dignified and restrained in tone. I
would suggest that you write Mr. Stewart 3 letter giving
your personal feelings about him as an ax-fan. This is
likely to have more affect on him and his agents than our
more stately approach. If you can encourage others to write
to him as individuals, too, do 50. Actually, it is much
worse for the Stewarts to be taking part in the extinction
of rare Species than it is for the Africans, because the
Africans are both hungry and poor and intend to eat the meat?
cell the skins and ivory, but the Stewarta think it is funny
they’ve got so many heads they don't know what t0 do with
them. This is the heighth of decadenca, and Mrs. Stewart's
assertion that she feels ”delicious" after killing One of
the most wise and wonderful animals in the warld, an elephant,
is so damning that‘ene alacst wenders if she really said it.

Best wishes,

Sincerely,

Attention: Miss Christine Stevens

Dear Miss Stevens: .

it
On the possibility that you may have missed, am enclosing an article
from Sept. 5th NEW YORK TIMES on poaching and killing of game
in Africa. Thought you would be interested in this news, although I
guess it is not really news that animals in Africa are being slaughtered
in such vast numbers . On the same subject, am enclosing pictures
from an old issue of NEWSWEEK.

Also, I picked up an old copy of READER's DIGEST which contained an
extremely interesting article on this problem and stating, among other
significant facts, that a British group in Kenya are attempting to

build more and better reserves. Their main problem was to get the
necessary water for such reserves, and to this end, money was being
solicited to establish water wells . This is all pretty detailed and
complicated, and no doubt you are more familiar with the entire

situation than I am. However, I sent a contribution of $20. 00 to the
organization in Kenya, and then sent the article from READER's DIGEST
to Mr. William Hendrix who writes an interesting animal column for

th e NEW YORK DAILY NEWS. Mr. Hendrix replied that he was very
glad to know of this and planned to publish an article in his column on the
situation in Africa (Possibly he may have done this by now, as I miss

his column here in Williamsport on many occasions). The name of the
organization, incidentally, in case anyone may be interested in correspond-
ing with or contributing to it: Colonel Mervyn Cowie, Director, Kenya
Royal National Park, P. O. Box 2076, Nairobi, Kenya, British East Africa.

I also enclose an article clipped from the Harrisburg, Pa. PATRIOT. Up
until this I was a fan of Jimmy Stewart; no more. I had the thought to write
him, but felt this rather futile ,, so am forwarding to you, with the sugges-
tion that perhaps your organization would consider dropping him a line on
the useless slaughter of wild African animals, or possibly you have some
literature on the subject which you could forward to him. I think this article
is anything but amusing, and puts him and his wife in the same class as the
natives who kill for no real good reason. They don't even know what to do
with their "trophies", but evidently they are going back for more.

Best wishes in your good work .

Sincerely,

Dear Miss Stevens:

Enclosed is COpy of report of latest minutes of JAWS. Thank you
for forwarding this for me to read as I found it most interesting
indeed. It would appear that some progress is being made in
Japan in animal welfare activity; however, I can well imagine
there is a tremendous amount of further work in the future.

The good peeple doing such a terrific job there cannot receive
enough praise - or help, apparently.

I am glad to be able to send small contributions periodically

to Japan; only sincerely wish the amounts could be larger, but
of course, there are so many needy groups in this country also.
As far as contributions are concerned, however, the largest part
of mine go to humane organizations, etc. working for the better-
ment of conditions for neglected and mistreated animals. I

give less to the organizations representing human needs, as my
thinking is that the peeple giving to animal welfare causes

are rather small in number by comparison with those donating

to the human agencies. The unhappy conclusion, I am afraid,
is that, whatever the good work being attempted, there is always
more need, financially, than is forthcoming.

I am glad at any time to receive news of the progress and work
of JAWS and should any group decide to attempt something larger
in the way of help for this worthy organization, I will be glad
to be included. In the meaitime, will continue to send contri-
butions, as I am able, directly to Japan.

Incidentally, I was wondering if Mrs. Lindesay Parrott in 'New.
York had taken ill. Sometime ago I had a letter of thanks from
her in which she Spoke of not feeling at all well of late. I
hepe she is in good health.

Sincerely,

on, W a..-»

New York 22, N.Y.

Attention: Editor

Gentlemen:“

I have just returned from vacation and have been glancing thru several
recent issues of EEWSWEEK. ~May I refer to July 27th issue, A Special
Sports Report, entitled "Spain’s Bravest Bullfighters, & Their New Deadly
Duel“. Your write-up of the competition between bullfighters, Dominguin
and Ordonez, may be of great interest to some few people in the U.S., but
to the majority of Americans bullfighting is a sordid, gory, and gruesome
display of rivalry which is repulsive. Frankly, most Americans do not
"have the stomach” for this so-called “sport” of fighting bulls. Watching
a man taunt, tantalize, and eventually kill an animal (even though it

be an animal raised to be fierce) is not most peeple's idea of pastime.
In my own Opinion, what happens to the man involved in this unpleasant
Spectacle is merely invited by him.

Most humane societies and organizations in our country are working
constantly and arduously to de-glamorize the uncivilized ”art“ of
bullfighting; they are, of course, extremely anxious and desirious of
preventing certain mercenary groups from introducing bullfighting as
a recognized sport in the U.S. I feel safe in saying that the largest
percentage of Americans are in accord with this thinking and with the
aims of humane organizations. However, magazine articles and TV pre-
sentations which play up the allure of the bullfighting ring certainly
tend to disrupt and discourage their efforts in this direction.

Regardless of Mr. Hemingway's overwhelming sanction of it, may I suggest
you let bullfighting to the Spaniards (who haven't seemed to progress much

with the centuries when it comes to entertainment) and stick to reporting
sports Which are strictly American; these make far more appealing reading.

Sincerely,

(mac) (3vo Pfleegor, Jr.

Dear Hrs. Pfloogor,

Thankzyou for sending no oooioo of your letters to the Rational Science
Foundation and to Senator Nouborgor and tho reply you received from the former.
~Othors have sent us this identical letter, which is apparently being mood as a
form lottor in response ﬁo the protests tho National Science Foundation hao
received. It oeomo to me an oxtromoly unoatisfactory reply ao there is no
indication of any kind as to what the high school students have boon doing
under those grants. I hope that some definite standards can be set up so that
children will not ho introduced to roooardh in a way that will encourago
callousness and cruelty;

we are anxious to see the humane trapping bill become law. Unfortunately,
the Victor-Coniboor trap, which kills animals quickly instead of leaving them
in agony as the loguhold trap d085, is still be manufacturoo in only two sizes.
I do not know if it would be possible to enact legislation outlawing the cruel

traps without being able ﬁo show that for every opocies of animals, large and
small, alternative practical trapping mothoés are available.

The problom of large-sized traps being capable of killing éogo has been
strongly emphhsiood by oppononta of humane trapping. I cannot boliovo that
it is a serious problem. As you point out, dogs caught in tho leg~hold traps
ofton have to be killed bocouoo they are so badly injured. Tho sets for wild
animals can bo ouch as practically to eliminate the possibility of dogs being
caught in them. For example, the traps for hoover ano ottor'would be sot in
water so that dogs would not be endangered. Tho oioo of trap for foxes would
bo too small for any but an extremely omoll doga and such small dogs would not
be likoly to be out in very wild country whore foxes could'bo ﬂound. In othor
wordo, I do not think that the chancoo of accidonto woulé be increased by
changing from cruel to humane traps, and tho vast amount of suffering saved is
of paramount importance. Your personal oxoorionooS'with the bad results of
negligent trapping would be holpful to no if’you would care to send no an account
Of that? a

With all good wishes for a hopoy noW'yoar,

Sincorolyh

Gentlemen:

It has come to my attention that your organization is currently Sponsoring,
under a $14,000 grant, a science program for high school students which involves
painful experiments on living animals.

While I am well aware that our young people must progress scientifically, it
certainly appears irrational and unowise to encourage youngsters of high school
age to become involved in and to undertake extensive animal experimentation
without the background, experience, judgment or the wisdom necessary in
handling animals proPerly, humanely, and spprOpristely for complicated
biological experimentation. I on in part here rc-phrasing the words of

Dr. Chauncey D. Leaks, Dean of the College of Medicine at Ohio State university
and President~elect of the American Association for the Advancement of

Science with whom I sheleheartedly agree. Furthermore, your encouragement

of immature youngsters undertaking painful experiments on animals, of any kind,
, is not only surprising but certainly deserving of ridicule and complete
opposition not only from hurnsnitsrisns and humane organizations, who are
violently opposedto Federal taxes being used to support such pregrsms, but
from parents as well, who earnestly do not want instilled in their children

s callous and indifferent attitude to the suffering of any living creature.
Certainly most thinking pcOple are in agreement with the obvious fact that
those young peeple Who elect such courses as will require witnessing and
participating in animal experimentation will receive adequate instruction

-in this at the higher education levels. There is no need, in any scientific
program, for high school students to inflict suffering on animals.

I suggest and urge, therefore, that you make such stipulation in the awarding
of grants to schools and students working under your sponsorship.

Sincerely, ﬁf~v>\

Having liveﬁ all my life so far in thﬁ State of Pennsylvania, whatt wilﬁlife thoundt,
I hava bath exposeé first-hand to the horribﬁe reenlts of trapping, especially
negligent trappiﬂg. Added to actual tantact with this inhmmana farm of

being mangitd as a result of getting aangﬁt it traps, etc.g etc. ttwra are

laws, of course, that traps must be chackaﬁ after a certain tiapﬁtﬁ yariod.

You can readily balieve that there art net naarlz enough game warﬂtasg forasters’

their mammary, unfealing grayed for the small amount of mamy whim. trapping,

as a hobby particularly, brings.

I am enclosing a clipping ftom our local newspaper. You wiil awtt theta is not
even a limit set for the trapping of certain small animals. You will note also
that "the poor fur market in recent yaara has reduced the numbtt a§ ggpgrianced

Dear Miss Draper

Thank you very much for forwarding to me the extra copies of your last
Information Report and the second cepy of ”First Aid & Care of Small
Animals”; the latter I turned over to a Boy Scout leader, who very
much appreciates having it.

As I mentioned to you previously, I never was more heartsickened by
pictures of inhumanly treated dogs than those in the Japanese laboratories.
However, I realize very well that there is plenty of abuse in such places
right here in our country. Nevertheless, I wrote to several peOple and
organizations regarding this matter of the horrible conditions in Japan,
enclosing a c0py of your Information Report. As I expected, I had no
reply from some; the replies I did receive I am enclosing as believe

you will be interested. I am simply delighted with the reply from
”Papular Dogs” magazine. Possibly by now you have received their

request for the pictures. I know you will be as pleased as I that they
plan on doing an article in a forthcoming issue of their magazine on

this subject. I will be watching for it.

The reply from Miss Jones of the Humane Society of the U.S. is very
sympathetic. From reading of her work in their bulletins I know she
does a tremendous work for animals. However, in this case possibly
they can do nothing more than your good organization has already
initiated.

I had also written the manufacturers of Friskies Dogfoods and Ken—L-Ration
in the hOpe that they may consider sending canned dogfood to at least

help feed these animals in Japan (as a deductible income tax item). I

was disappointed with the letter from Friskies; have not yet heard

from Ken-L-Ration. Intend writing Gaines and Rival also.

Would be glad to have any news from you on this or any other issue.

With best wishes.

Sincerely,

Dear Mrs. Pfleegor:

I wish that we could help the animals in Japan. In View of the fact
that the Animal Welfare Institute has called attention to the laboratory
conditions in Japan, we would be duplicating their effort if we also
published a report and I can think of nothing we could do that the
Animal Welfare Institute hasn't already done by publishing its report
of the conditions in Japan.

I completely agree with you that humanitarians are interested in
trying to aid abused animals no matter where they may be located. Com—
passion should know no boundaries. But there is a staggering amount of
work to be done in this country; more than can easily be imagined. And
I must say that I believe one could find, in our own country, conditions
as bad as those in Japan. When one considers that America is known
throughout the world as being basically compassionate and humane~minded,
it is all the more shocking that our nation generally is unaware of the
widespread and constantly increasing abuses of animals right in its midst,
in laboratories and elsewhere.

I do wish we could help the animals in Japan. I think the Animal
Welfare Institute’s report was a splendid one and I fervently hope that
it will bring some help to the suffering creatures there.

Sincerely yours,

Dear mrs. Pfleegor:

Mr. Fred W. Hoover, President, Albers Milling Compani, has asked me to tell
you that he was especially appreciative of the considerable trouble you took
in writing him.concerning the animal welfare situation in Japan.

Certainly we are as touched as you to learn of the grievous situation in
Japan and earnestly wish it were possible for us to be instrumental in
alleviating the conditions.

The Albers Milling Company and Carnation have been identified in support of
animal welfare movements in the United States. The shipment of Friskies
or other prepared dog foods to Japan would be difficult and might not be
the best practical solution for the problem.described.

We are sharing the information report of the Animal Welfare Institute which
you forwarded with some of our people and will try to discover if there is
some way in which we can help with constructive action in this prdblem,
Please accept our appreciation for the interest you have shown.

Sincerely yours,

Dear Miss Draper

I regret troubling you again, but in your letter to me of June
25th you mentioned that you had sent 10 additional cepies of
your latest Information Report (containing pictures of dogs in
Japanese labs). I have never received these and am wondering
if, for some reason, they may have gone astray. If so, would
appreciate even a few additional copies.

Thank you very much for your booklet entitled ”First Aid &
Care of Small Animals". This will be very helpful to me, I
am sure, as anytime there is a lost or injured animal or bird
within a radius of several miles, I seem to be called upon.

I know very little about wild animals, and this will be good
to have on hand. If someone else would like a cepy, will most
assuredly refer him to you.

‘Might mention here too - have you seen the jMay, 1958

issue of "ARGOSY" magazine (referred to as a "man's" magaZine).
containing the article entitled "Must These Dogs Die?", the

true story of the treatment to greyhound racing dogs. I was
sickened and can hardly believe this. Although I realize this

is now an older issue of this magazine, hope you can pick up a
c0py if you have not already read this article. It is shocking,
and surely hepe some organization or group will undertake to try

to do something about sud1 a situation. It is disgusting indeed
what some people will do for money. I plan to send this magazine
to the Humane Society of the U.S., 1111 E St., N.W., washington, DC,
on the possibility they have not had it brought to their attention.

Am very unhappy about the outcome of the Senate Agriculture Committee
vote on humane slaughter lesiglation. However, I - and many others
here - are still doing all possible in the way of letter-writing,

and sincerely hape this legislation will yet become a reality this

session.




-2-

Would be very glad to hear from you at any time; I am especially
anxious about the unbelievably mistreated and neglected dogs in
the Jap laboratories. It seems we have enough problems here in
our own country to look into; howlever, humanitarians cannot
shut their eyes to gross cruelty anywhere, and I cannot remember
ever having seen pictures of animals in more uncivilized and
deplorable conditions. I am glad you have had some offers of
contributions. Over the past weekend I forwarded another $5.00
to Mrs. Parrott; simply left something else go and sent this

as feel these animals are really in worse need even than some

of our very bad cases, with few to help them.

Sincerely, . ,

(Mrs.) C. A. P eegor, Jr.

Since writing this letter, I was talking with one of

the gentlemen in the same office where I am employed.

He is a scout leader and his two boys are very active

in scouts, having undertaken such p:ojects as building

bird houses, etc. I believe he would appreciate having

a c0py of the booklet on "First Aid & Care of Small Animals"
for possible reference. If you would forward to me, will see
that he gets it. Thank you.

Miss Estella Draper
Animal Welfare Institute

New York, N.Y.

Dear Miss Draper:

I would appreciate receiving about 8 or 10 additional capies

of your last "Information Report" showing pictures of the dogs

in Japanese laboratories. I have sent the other capies you

were kind enough to mail to me out to other individuals who I thought
would be interested and who - I hOpe - may come up with some

concrete ideas on how to help these poor creatures.

I can truthfully say I have never been more revolted by any sight
than these photographs, and I believe you did well to bring them
to the attention of the people on your mailing list. I have

been wondering if you evoked any sizeable amount of correspondence,
or offers of aid, or any contributions of money after this Report
was received by your membership. I sincerely hOpe so.

I received a very interesting thank-you letter from Mrs. Lindesay
Parrott, which further pointed out the desperate need in Japan.

I made 8 copies of it, and plan to send it along with your Infor-
mation Report to several others I have in mind. For your interest,
have written letters (referring to and attaching the Information
Report) to Mr. William Hendrix, "DAILY NEWS“, N.Y.; the Humane
Society of U.S., Washington, DC.; President of Albers Milling
Company-Div. of Carnation Company, Los Angeles, Cal. (mfgrs. of
Friskies Dogfood) with the suggestion that perhaps they could
forward canned dogfood periodically to the Japan Animal Welfare
Society to help, at least, feed these animals. Am going to

send a similar letter to the Ken-L-Ration peOple.

Want to send copies also to: "POpular Dogs" magazine; The Angell
Memorial Hospital, Boston, Mass (very famous animal hOSpital); the
Philadelphia Anti-Vivisection Society, and anyone else I can

think of who may be in some position to help.

Would be interested in hearing from you at any time convenient
on this subject.

Sincerely,

m MI-

Mr. Lewis 9. Gillenson
Editor

CORONET

Coronet Bldg.

Chicago, Ill.

Dear Mr. Gillenson:

Please accept my hesrtiest congratulations for your courage in publishing
"The Case for Humans Vivisection" by Paul w. Kearney in November CORONET.

I can appreciate that you undoubtedly will be the recipient of many lsttsrs,
both from outraged animal-lovers, such as myself, and from the "practical“
defenders of vivisection.

I am simply delighted that a magazine of the calibre of CORQNET finally put
before the layman the real facts, AS THEY EXIST. I have boon engaged in
animal welfare and S.P.C. A. (Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals)
work for many years, and in this capacity have been well sworn of the fact
that cruelty and neglect beyond imagination exists with regard to dogs and
other animals used for exocrimental purposes. however, in spits of muchw
publicized information on this subject by such organizations as the S.P.C.A.
and the American Anti~Vivisection, many people simply refuse to helisve that
such facts are true and choose to look upon the writings of such groups as
the prattlings of extremists. However, since they can read these same
confirmed facts in a non-biased magazine, perhaps it will awaken them to

the realization that such things really do go on.

Let me state that, while a humanitarian, I do not advocate holding back the
progress of’medicsl science and that I feel there must be caperxmentstion

on animals. However, I, along with all other hsmane workers for the cause

of anbmsls, mm of the immovable contention and belief that animals used ﬁor
experimentation, be they dogs or whatever, should be given the most ultimate
in humans treatment and care. They should, in fact, be accorded the some
treatment in.regard to the relief of suffering act the elimination of it,ss
much as possible.os human beings. There should he no unnecessary cutting,
probing, etc. unless absolutely necessary, and then only under the best
supervised and controlled conditions. These are the goals which humanitarisns
uphold, and certainly whether one is fond of dogs and cats or not it is cruel
sadistic, and inhuman to believe otherwisc.

Again let me extend my heartfelt personal thanks to your magazins one to Mr.
Kearney for bringing to light conditions all pet owners and lovers as wall as
just peeple with a sense of mercy and decency will be intensely interssted
