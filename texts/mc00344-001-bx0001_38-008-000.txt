PEOPLE IN
MEDICINE
wo questions most anx-
iously asked by women
since time immemorial are
now being answered by brand
new means.

The questions are “Am I
pregnant?” and “Will it be
a girl or a boy?” .

The most startling innova-
tion is an attempt to predict
the sex of unborn babies
through chemistry. Its basis
is a saliva test, available by
mail. The ﬁrst deﬁnite re-
sults of its application in the
United States are expected
this month.

Here’s how it works: In
her fourth or ﬁfth month of
pregnancy, the woman puts a
chemically treated wafer on
her tongue—before eating
breakfast or applying lip-
stick. Then she mails the
wafer back to the laboratory
where another chemical is
added. If the wafer remains
colorless the word is: a girl.
If it turns purple, male hor-
mones are indicated and the
prediction is for a boy.

The test’s originator,
Frenchman Jean Reisman
(72), claims 135,000 applica-
tions so far in France, “more

than 98% accurate.” Errors,
he insists, occurred only if the
wafer was moistened at the
wrong time, if there had been
an abortion or if twins of
different sexes were due.
Associates of Reisman set
up shop in Chicago in Febru—
ary, told PEOPLE TODAY they
have sold “thousands” of
tests by now. They report
that further research is

 




 

Frenchman Reisman’s method of determining a‘ba-
by’s sex before birth by testing the mother’s saliva
rouses skepticism among a number of doctors in U.S.
If he has discovered something useful, they feel, he
should publish it to the medical profession, as is cus-
tomary. Reisman won’t talk, charges $5 per test.

proceeding in Chicago hos-
pitals “with the knowledge
of the Chicago Board of
Health.” The board, they add,
is skeptical, “like all medical
people are toward anything
new,” but it is not objecting.

man-predicted” babies will be
born in August. Should the
results bear out the claims,
demand for the tests may rise
fantastically. (Mention on a
recent Garry Moore network
TV show brought 500 letters
the next day, 1,100 in all.)
With less ballyhoo, a new
advance has been scored in
answering the basic Am-I-
pregnant poser. This was ﬁrst
successfully tackled nearly
30 years ago with the aid of
rabbits. Doctors injected ur-
ine of women known to be
pregnant into rabbit does
(l.). Ordinarily, rabbits ovu-
late only after mating but the
injected rabbits ovulated
without mating, while similar
injections of urine from non-
pregnant women brought no
reaction. Subsequent experi-
ments brought equally good
results with female mice,
South American clawed toads,
male grass frogs and common
toads (if the tests are posi-
tive, the males release sperm) .

DOCTORS SAKAL & MANGUN: Now, CERTAINTY WITHOUT RABBITS?

Now a new procedure dis—
penses with laboratory ani—
mals altogether. A drug called
Stigmonene Bromide is injec-
ted into the woman. If she is
not pregnant, the drug will
promptly start delayed men-
struation. If nothing hap-
pens, she’s pregnant. The
test, developed by Drs. G.
Mangun and E. H. Sakal,
yielded perfect results with
77 patients at Manhattan’s St.
Vincent’s Hospital. The drug
failed to induce menstruation
in 69 of the women,~indicat—
ing pregnancy. This diagnosis
was conﬁrmed later in all
cases. As a control, “rabbit
tests” were given these same
women and proved inaccurate

in 14.5% of the cases. In no
instance did Stigmonene Bro-—
mide interfere with normai
gestation, nor were any other
harmful side effects reported
by the women tested.

However, not all women
will be able to beneﬁt from
Stigmonene Bromide tests.
Organic pelvic disease, men-
strual irregularity, glandular
disorders or the menopause
can make the tests inconclu—
sive. And in some cases—bron-
chial asthma, for instance~
it must not be used at all.
Thus thousands of rabbits
and other laboratory animals
will continue as oracles to
women who wonder, “Will I
have a baby?”

of 1940 thru 1954 boomeranged upon
the Dog World Staff because the idea
has taken on tremendously among
the many breeders and has appealed
to all as a worthwhile project; there-

well. considered.

All nominations are now in and
all will be published in the columns

A committee of three will be chosen
for each breed by Dog World and
this committee will consider the
nominations and make the ﬁnal de-

Decisions will be based on pro-

upon the show records of the dogs
themselves. Producing fame will
weigh approximately 65 points and
show wins approximately 35% in a
total weight of 100.

PRESENTATION OF THE ROEBLING MEDAL OF THE
MINERALOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA TO
EDWARD H. KRAUS

WALTER F. HUNT,
University of M iclzigan, Arm Arbor, Michigan.

A special meeting of the Mineralogical Society of America at this par-
ticular time has a two-fold purpose: to commemorate the ﬁrst quarter
century of the founding of the Society and to carry out the instructions
of the Council passed in December 1943 that this meeting should also be
the occasion for the presentation of the Roebling medal. The two pur-
poses mentioned are very intimately related as it will he noted that the
recipient of the Roebling award this year, Dean Edward H. Kraus, was
a member of the organization committee and as chairman was largely
responsible for the founding of the Society twenty—ﬁve years ago. While
it is not my intention to dwell at great length on the historical events
that led to the establishment of the Society, a few remarks seem pertinent
in connection with this presentatiorr—the ﬁfth award made by the
Society.

While the question of the desirability of organizing a separate society
composed of members interested mainly in mineralogy, crystallography
and the allied sciences had been under consideration for a number of
years, it was not until the Albany meeting of the Geological Society in
1916 that a small group of six decided to take some formal action. It was
felt that the formation of a mineralogical society would stimulate greater
interest in the subject and at the same time offer a ready outlet for the
ever-increasing number of papers in this ﬁeld through the establishment
of a society journal. It was pointed out that with respect to organization
and means of publication the mineralogists of America were not keeping
pace with their colleagues in Europe and the time had arrived for the
founding of a society whose standards, insofar as fellowship was con—
cerned, should be equal to those of the Geological Society of America.

This small group of six consisted of Edward H. Kraus (Michigan),
Alexander H. Phillips (Princeton), Frank R. van Ilorn ((‘ase School of
Applied Science), Thomas L. Walker (Toronto), .Cdgar T. Wherry
(U. S. Bureau of Chemistry), and Herbert P. Whitlock (American
Museum of Natural History). Dean Kraus was selected as the one “to
conduct the correspondence lookingitoward the organization of the
Society.”

A circular letter was sent to a selected list of mineralogists in the
United States and Canada to determine the consensus of opinion with
regard to the formation of a new society. It was then planned to com-

plete the organization as quickly as possible if the returns showed a
sufﬁcient number of favorable replies. On February 5, 1917, such a letter
was addressed to ﬁfty—one mineralogists, inviting them to unite as charter
members in this new organization to be known as the Mineralogical
Society of America. By October 12, 1917, the replies indicated that
thirty-ﬁve were in favor of such an organization. But on account of the
very unsettled conditions then existing, due to the war, it was thought
wise to take no immediate action at that time. However, by December,
1919 it was believed that the time had arrived for taking the ﬁnal steps.
An organization meeting was called for December 30, 1919, and an in-
vitational letter to attend was sent to all who might be interested. It
thus came to pass that at a meeting in connection with the thirty—second
annual gathering of the Geological Society of America a group of twenty-
eight mineralogists from all parts of the United States, including repre-
sentatives from Canada, met in the Mineralogical Museum of Harvard
University and organized a new society. At this meeting a provisional
constitution and by-laws were adopted and negotiations started for
afﬁliation with the Geological Society of America which were successfully
concluded the following year.

It is very signiﬁcant to note that the ﬁrst President of the newly formed
society was Dean Kraus, a signal honor to the leader of this small group
of siX and formal recognition by the Society that the immediate goal of
the organization committee had been achieved. The hopes and expecta-
tions of the founders have I am sure been fully justiﬁed by actual ac—
complishments during the ﬁrst twenty-ﬁve years, both as regards total
membership in the Society and the number and type of papers published
in the Society’s journal T he American Mineralogist.

In the life and activities of some men it may be observed that after
having attained a desired objective their ardor decreases and interest
wanes. Dean Kraus’ interest in and activity for the welfare of the
Society has continued unabated throughout the years. It was his sug-
gestion made at the tenth annual meeting that it would be very helpful
if the Society had the means to establish awards for research and note-
worthy achievements in the ﬁeld of mineralogy that led to the establish-
ment of the Roebling medal in 1930. As chairman of the Roebling Medal
Committee he materially assisted the designer in the selection and ar-
rangement of the proper symbolic emblems engraved on the medal. In
recognition of this service he was asked by Dr. Bowen, then President of
the Society, to deliver the presentation address when the Council voted
the ﬁrst award to Professor Charles Palache in December 1937.

Edward H. Kraus was born in Syracuse, New York, in 1875 and re—

ceived his early education in the schools and University of that city
—B.S. in 1896 and M.S. in 1897. His alma mater on two occasions has
paid tribute to his leadership in the ﬁelds of science and education
through the granting of two honorary degrees, Doctor of Science in 1920
and Doctor of Laws in 1934. Shortly after completing his studies at
Syracuse University he spent two years in Professor Paul Groth’s labora—
tory at the University of Munich, Germany. Here he pursued more ad-
vanced work in crystallography, optics, geology and chemistry, and re—
ceived the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in 1901.

In 1904 he was called to the University of Michigan as assistant pro-
fessor of mineralogy. His advancement from the start was exceedingly
rapid for in four years his title read Professor of Mineralogy and Petrog—
raphy and Director of the Mineralogical Laboratory. Under his leader-
ship the department grew rapidly because of his energy, enthusiasm and
foresight. .

In addition to being a stimulating teacher, Dean Kraus possesses rare
executive and administrative abilities. He has, therefore, been called
upon frequently to serve the University in various additional capacities:
as secretary of the Graduate School from 1908 to 1912; from 1911 to 1915
he served as Acting Dean of the Summer Session and from 1915 to 1933
as Dean; in the College of Pharmacy he was Acting Dean from 1920 to
1923, and Dean from 1923 until 1933. In 1933 he was appointed Dean of
the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, the largest single ad-
ministrative unit of the University with an enrollment of approximately
5000 students. Because of his manifold duties in this new position he was
relieved of all formal teaching although he continued to keep in close
touch with the advances in mineralogy and frequently returned to his
private ofﬁce in the Department where undisturbed he continued some
of his investigations.

Shortly he will retire from all administrative duties and I understand
he is looking forward with keen delight to the time when he againcan
devote his entire attention to writing and research.

Dean Kraus is a fellow of the Mineralogical Society of America (Presi-
dent in 1920), the Geological Society of America since 1902, and the
American Association for the Advancement of Science. He also holds
membership in the American Chemical Society, Optical Society of
America, American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers,
Michigan Academy of Science, Arts and Letters (PreSident 1920),
American Pharmaceutical Association, American Association of Colleges
of Pharmacy (President 1926), and for ten years (1930—1940) served on
the committee on the revision of the U. S. Pharmacopea. He is an

114 WALTER F. HUNT

honorary fellow of the American College of Dentists and honorary mem_
ber of the German Mineralogical Society, the Gemmological Association
of Great Britain, and the Gemmological Institute of America.

Although burdened for a long period by many time—consuming adminis—
trative duties, he still found opportunity to contribute liberally to min—
eralogical literature. His list of scientiﬁc publications approximates 75
papers covering a wide range of subjects relating to the occurrence and
origin of minerals, crystallographic forms observed on crystals, and new
apparatus to determine speciﬁc properties of minerals and rocks. In more
recent years his attention has been concentrated on the variation of
hardness of the diamond and its industrial applications. Also fourteen
papers have appeared by Dean Kraus dealing with educational trends
and policies.

In addition to this long list of papers, he is the sole author of two and
co-author with his colleagues of three texts on Crystallography, Descrip-
tive and General Mineralogy, Gems and Gem Materials and Tables for
the Determination of Minerals. As text books on the college level they
have unquestionably stimulated interest in minerals and gems, and
judged by their sales through the years have demonstrated great
vitality.

One of the highest honors that can be conferred by the University of
Michigan on a member of its faculty came to Dean Kraus very recently
when he was awarded the Henry Russel Lectureship for 1945, in recogni-
tion of his outstanding work in the ﬁelds of crystallography and mineral—
ogy. The selection of the recipient of this Lectureship is made each year
by the University Research Club.

Dean Kraus, the Society on this commemorative occasion expresses
its gratitude for the innumerable services you have rendered. The Society
also wishes to pay tribute to you as an inspiring teacher, an able organizer
and administrator, a painstaking investigator and successful author.
Your labors in behalf of our science have extended over a period of
forty—ﬁve years. The Mineralogical Society desires to express its high
regard in which you are held by your associates and to formally recognize
your accomplishments by bestowing on you the highest award that the
Society has at its disposal. For in the truest sense and in the broadest
meaning of the phrase you have earned it by “meritorious achievement.”

It is indeed both a privilege and pleasure for me, who has been so
closely associated with you for so long a time, to have been asked by the
Council to carry out their wish of presenting to you the Roebling Medal.

 




 

ACCEPTANCE OF THE ROEBLING MEDAL OF THE
MINERALOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA

EDWARD H. KRAUS,
University of Michigan, Arm Arbor, Michigan.

Today we celebrate the 25th anniversary of the founding of the
Mineralogical Society of America. To be the recipient of the Roebling
Medal on this occasion is indeed a signal honor. It is with sincere ap-
preciation and with deep humility that I accept this medal presented to
me on behalf of the Society by Professor Walter F. Hunt, my colleague
and friend and immediate associate in the development of mineralogy at
the University of Michigan during the past forty years.

At anniversay celebrations such as this, it is considered appropriate
to review the accomplishments of the organization. The events that led
to the founding of the Society were brieﬂy referred to by Professor Hunt.
They were, moreover, given in considerable detail in the ﬁrst presidential
address of the Society entitled “The Future of Mineralogy in America”
which I delivered in Chicago in 1920, and at the annual meeting in 1929
the progress made by the Society during its ﬁrst decade was reviewed.
In 1937 at the Washington meeting, I had the honor of presenting on
behalf of the Society the ﬁrst Roebling Medal to Professor Charles
Palache of Harvard University, the Dean of American mineralogists.
Later, it was my privilege to contribute to the anniversary volume of the
Geological Society of America the chapter on mineralogy in which the
advances made in our science in the 50 years, 1888 to 1938, were discussed.
Thus, the literature now extant covers rather adequately the general
developments in mineralogy and the progress of the Mineralogical
Society of America up to six years ago.

These siX years have been most momentous. During this period there
has been waged the greatest global struggle the world has ever experi-
enced. Since modern warfare utilizes to the utmost the achievements of
science and technology, the personnel of the country in these ﬁelds has
been marshalled as never before. In fact, the urgency of war requirements
compelled the crowding of a stupendous effort into this relatively brief
period. This effort has wrought most signiﬁcant results, which under ordi-
nary peacetime conditions would have taken two or three times as long
to accomplish. In this great effort the members of the Mineralogical
Society of America have been called upon to solve in the laboratory and
in the ﬁeld many difﬁcult problems which involved a comprehensive
knowledge of our science. The contributions of our members have been
most praise-worthy. On this occasion. I shall refer brieﬂy to some of the
services rendered.

One of the most important contributions to the winning of the war, in
which our mineralogists played a very important role, was made in the
ﬁeld of radio communication. The developments in this important ﬁeld
in the United States, since Pearl Harbor, are remarkable. The results
which have been achieved are indeed thrilling.

As is now well known, piezoelectric oscillating crystal plates are very
important for effective radio communication. As early as 1880, Jacques
and Pierre Curie discovered that the crystals of those minerals and
chemical substances which possess polar axes of symmetry will under
favorable conditions exhibit piezoelectric properties. However, it was not
until toward the close of World War I that attempts were made to apply
this interesting property in developing devices for the detection of
submarines.

The observation that quartz crystals, which possess this remarkable
property, could be made to expand and contract rapidly when placed in
an electric ﬁeld, was an important discovery and led to most interesting
and startling uses. In 1922, Professor W. C. Cady of Wesleyan University
found that this piezoelectric property could be used to control the fre-
quencies of oscillation of radio circuits. In due time, this led. to the de-
velopment of crystal-controlled radio equipment. For this purpose ap—
propriately cut thin sections of quartz crystals proved most effective in
keeping sending and receiving apparatus tuned to designated frequencies.

The preparation of piezoelectric oscillating quartz plates was at ﬁrst
on a rather limited and more or less custom basis. The annual output was
expressed in thousands. With our entrance into the war there was im-
mediately an urgent demand for tens of millions of such oscillating quartz
plates for use in the great number of airplanes to be built, and in ships,
motor vehicles, and ratio sets of all kinds. As Brazil was the principal
source of suitable material and the means of shipment by sea extremely
hazardous because of the submarine menace, and air transportation very
limited, frantic efforts were made by mineralogists and geologists to
locate other occurrences of usable quartz crystals. At the same time, it
became necessary not only to accelerate the speed of production but also
to make use of new crystal cuts to meet the new requirements due to the
greatly varying conditions encountered in operations on the ground in
widely different geographic locations and in the air at altitudes up to
30,000 feet or more.

Rapid precision methods of production had to be developed. This re-
quired the services of crystallographers and mineralogists well versed in
the properties of quartz, and in applying modern optical and x-ray
methods. No tribute is too high to be paid to our mineralogists and to the
various technologists and industrial managers who quickly made possible

the production of the many millions of oscillating quartz plates so ur-
gently needed by our armed forces. This accomplishment must be included
among the many miracles of science and technology this war has wrought.
The various scientiﬁc aspects of oscillating quartz plates will be discussed
in a series of papers by men who contributed so signally in making this
miracle possible. These papers will constitute a symposium which it is
hoped may be published in an early issue of The American Mineralogist.

We all sincerely regret that through the exigencies of the war, Dr.
Harry Berman, one of our eminent and most promising younger mineralo-
gists, made the supreme sacriﬁce. While on a trip to Great Britain on
behalf of the furtherance of the use of piezoelectric oscillating quartz
plates Dr. Berman met his tragic death in a plane crash at Prestwick,
Scotland, on August 27, 1944.

Prior to the outbreak of the war, much of the industry of the United
States was devoted to the production of heavy equipment such as loco—
motives, automobiles, trucks, agricultural equipment, refrigerators, and
so forth, all of which are so essential to our modern mechanized civiliza-
tion. Our industrial achievements in these areas have been remarkable.
In fact, they have received great acclaim the world over.

Many of these industrial advances were, however, dependent upon the
use of small items which had to be imported, for they were either not
produced at all in this country, or only in very limited quantities. I refer
especially to the use of diamonds and synthetic sapphires and rubies in
industry. The United States was also largely dependent upon industries
in the low countries, France, and Germany, for cut gem material.

The use of diamonds in industry has increased enormously in recent
years. Large quantities of diamonds are now processed and used for wire
drawing dies, for diamond—set tools, in the precision machining of metal
and non-metal parts, and for diamond bonded Wheels for sawing and
abrasive purposes. When Germany overran Holland, Belgium, and
France, the only supply of ﬁne diamond wire drawing dies was cut off.
These dies are necessary in the manufacture of precision wires, especially
for those of smaller diameters. As these ﬁne wires and ﬁlaments are abso-
lutely essential in the manufacture of electrical and radio apparatus and
in electric light bulbs, as well as in many other ways, a very critical
situation developed. Accordingly, frantic efforts were at once made to
produce these dies in this country. Unfortunately, there were very few
persons in the United States with technical experience in this ﬁeld, and
those to whom the development of methods for the production of these
dies was entrusted were not well trained in mineralogy and, hence, not
familiar with the complex properties of the diamond. In addition, it

 




 

ACCEPTANCE OF ROEBLING MEDAL 119

was only after the lapse of a considerable period that counsel and advice
was slought of those familiar with the marked variation in hardness with
direction and the structural properties of the diamond. However, the
progress which has been made in this ﬁeld is gratifying. Industry has been
supplied with sufﬁcient quantities of domestically produced diamond
dies which have given adequate service.

Another remarkable achievement during this period was the develop-
ment at the Bureau of Standards in Washington of an electric drilling
method for the production of super-ﬁne dies which has recently been put
into commercial use. These dies are commonly designated as triple
nought dies, namely with diameters as small as 0.0003 of an inch, or
3-tenths of a mil.

With regard to diamond set tools, the United States was in a very
favorable condition when hostilities broke out. Highly efﬁcient diamond-
set tools had been developed by our manufacturers. The increased de-
mands for these tools made by the war effort were readily met by the
expansion of existing plants and the development of new ones. Then too,
great progress was made by manufacturers of abrasives in the production
of diamond bonded wheels by using crushing boart, principally from the
Belgian Congo. These wheels now play a very important role in industry
and their use will undoubtedly increase materially.

The use of industrial diamonds is now very widespread. In fact, they
are employed, directly or indirectly, in the manufacture of many articles
in common use today. Extensive research is conducted in leading indus—
trial countries to improve the methods of using and increasing their ef-
ﬁciency. To disseminate information in this important ﬁeld, four years
ago, the Goldsmiths Journal of London added a section entitled “Indus-
trial Diamond Review.” The success of this new section was immediate
and the interest in its articles so great that the Review was enlarged and
is now issued as an independent monthly.

As already indicated, prior to the outbreak of the war, Belgium, Hol—
land, and Germany furnished approximately 95 per cent of the world’s
supply of polished diamonds. In those countries there were about 40,000
diamond cutters, as compared with only about 250 in the United States,
who were mainly employed in the production of quality stones. When
Germany overran the low countries, our main sources of these diamonds
were cut off. Efforts were then made to increase the output of polished
diamonds in this country, and quantity production methods were intro-
duced, especially for the cutting of stones of smaller sizes. As a result,
the number of cutters and apprentices in this country increased rapidly
for many new shops were opened.

The question is often asked whether the cutters of the United States
will be able to compete successfully with those Of the European countries
after hostilities cease. According to current opinion, it is ﬁrmly believed
that quality cutting of stones of the larger sizes in this country will con-
tinue to be proﬁtable so long as rough material can be imported duty free
and polished diamonds are subject to a 10 per cent duty. Because of the
great difference in labor costs, quantity cutting of the smaller sizes,
especially those known as melee, will undoubtedly encounter very strong
competition from the European countries. Thus, the future of this phase
of the diamond cutting industry is quite problematical.

In the manufacture of watches, chronometers, precision scientiﬁc in-
struments, electrical meters, and so forth, small hard bearing parts,
commonly known as jewels, are extremely essential. Experience over
many years has shown that jewels made of the varieties of corundum,
aluminum oxide, known as sapphire and ruby, are extremely efﬁcient. At
ﬁrst, natural sapphires and rubies were used in the manufacture of these
jewels and bearing parts, but as their supply is limited, most of the
jewels are now made from synthetic material.

The method of producing synthetic sapphires and rubies, which is now
in use, was ﬁrst introduced about 1902. It has since been greatly im-
proved and at present synthetic material of high quality is available
which is used to manufacture large quantities of jewels. Prior to the war
all of these jewels were imported from abroad, principally from Switzer-
land, France, and Germany, for there were no plants in this country. As
soon as hostilities broke out, we were threatened with a very critical
shortage. This was due not only to the supply from abroad being greatly
reduced but also because the war effort entailed the production of enor—
mous quantities of materiel in which these jewels are most essential. Im—
mediately, efforts were made to have synthetic sapphires and rubies pro-
duced in this country so that an adequate supply of rough material
might be available for the fabrication of these greatly needed jewels.

But very few of our mineralogists had paid any attention whatever
to the production of synthetic gem materials, and hence the source of
information was very limited. Fortunately, at the University of Michi—
gan, this phase of the gem industry had long been stressed. On several
occasions I had the opportunity of visiting plants in Switzerland and
Germany where synthetic rubies and sapphires were produced and
fabricated into jewels. We were, therefore, able to furnish reliable in—
formation to the representatives of the Linde Air Products Company,
Incorporated, which contemplated entering this ﬁeld and is now the
largest producer in this country of boules of this greatly needed synthetic
product. As it was impossible to locate any refugee, who had had practi-

cal experience in one of the European plants, it was necessary for the
ﬁrm to start from the beginning. Here, too, the contributions made by
the various mineralogists, chemists, and physicists, who were called into
consultation, have been noteworthy. Aided by these contributions, the
very able research and technological staffs of the Company have wrought
another miracle of production. Not only have the requirements for rough
material been adequately met, but new methods of production have been
developed which should prove very helpful in meeting foreign competi-
tion when the trade routes of the world are again open. It should also be
noted that there are now several companies in this country fabricating
the domestically produced material into jewels and bearing parts of high
quality. At the present time the boules of synthetic sapphire and ruby
are used primarily to meet the demands of industry, but it is expected
that in due time this product will also be used for cutting and polishing
stones into gems.

One of the great imperatives of the war effort has been the need to
greatly expand our supplies of various strategic minerals. In the search
for new occurrences of these minerals, which might prove of economic
importance, the members of our Society cooperated enthusiastically. The
list of those who have been or still are participating in these projects is a
long one.

One of the most helpful developments in recent years, which has
been greatly augmented by the war, is the pooling of information and
thought by scientists in border—line fields. This has been notably true
in the application of x-ray methods in the study of crystal structure.
Crystallographers, mineralogists, physicists, chemists, and mathemati-
cians are all involved in problems in this area of science. Several years
ago it was deemed desirable that workers in these sciences, who are inter-
ested in crystal structure, should have the opportunity of meeting to-
gether and discussing their mutual problems. For this purpose, the Amer-
ican Society for X—ray and Electron Diffraction was organized in 1941.
It is indeed gratifying that many fellows and members of the Mineralogi—
cal Society of America have been very active in this new organization
and that one of our fellows was elected as its first President and served
two consecutive terms. Members of this new society have already made
many important contributions by solving some very complex problems
through the concerted action of experts in several cognate fields.

From the very beginning, through its annual meetings and The Ameri-
can Mineralogist, our Society has been very successful in the furtherance
of the several sciences represented by its membership. This is most
gratifying. It should also be noted that during the last two decades the
general public has shown greatly increased interest in things mineralogi—

 




 

 

 

 

122 EDWARD H. KRA US

cal. This has resulted in the organization throughout the country of
many local and regional mineralogical clubs and societies composed
largely of persons who are lovers of minerals and who desire authorita-
tive information concerning their properties, identiﬁcation, uses, and
methods of occurrence and display. To aid in disseminating such informa—
tion some of these organizations have established their own journals.
These organizations have also stimulated interest in the art of cutting
and polishing minerals for gem purposes. There are now many amateur
lapidaries as well as an increased number of professional shops well
equipped with modern apparatus. These shops have done much to relieve
the shortage in the supply of semiprecious cut material caused by the
war.

Another advance of recent years, which should be more widely recog-
nized by professional mineralogists and geologists, is that made by pro-
gressive retailers of gems and gem materials. It was not so long ago that
members of the most reliable ﬁrms of jewelers in our larger communities
were not well informed concerning the properties and characteristics of
the gem materials they sold, and therefore were often unable to answer
intelligently many pertinent questions asked by inquiring prospective
purchasers. But today, the situation is greatly changed largely due to
the activities of the Gemological Society of America and the Gemological
Institute, in which some of the members of our Society have been active.
At present, there are retail stores in many communities with personnel
well informed on the scientiﬁc aspects of gems and well supplied with
instruments, such as,——~refractometers, dichroscopes, speciﬁc gravity
balances, diamondscopes, and sometimes even with polarizing micro-
scopes,——-which are essential for theaccurate determination of physical
and optical properties. It is now possible to ask questions relating to
speciﬁc gravity, hardness, index of refraction, dichroism, optical charac-
ter——as to whether the stone is isotropic or anisotropic, uniaXial or bi—
axial, positive or negative,~—and receive intelligent answers. This is eX—
tremely gratifying to those of us who for many years have labored con-
sistently to disseminate authoritative information in this important
branch of mineralogy.

Twenty—ﬁve years ago the future of the Mineralogical. Society of Amer—
ica was considered by many as being highly problematical. This opinion
was held largely by those who were not closely identiﬁed with our sub-
ject. But soon a more favorable opinion developed, due in the main to
the rapid increase in the number of fellows and members and the develop-
ment of The American Mineralogist, as a leading scientiﬁc journal. In
addition, the Roebling gift of $45,000 in 1926, and the excellent coopera-

tion of the Geological. Society of America from the beginning as well. as
its ﬁnancial support in recent years, have aided the Society greatly in
attaining its high position among similar organizations in this ﬁeld.

The concluding paragraph of my review of the progress made by the
Society during its ﬁrst ten years may well be repeated now, with only
two slight changes. “While today we rejoice that the achievements of the
Society have been so signiﬁcant during the ﬁrst twenty-ﬁve years, we are
at the same time conﬁdent that the next quarter of a century will show
equal or even greater accomplishments. This will be readily possible if
we maintain the same enthusiastic interest in the science and the splendid
loyalty and spirit of co-operation that have been so marked since our
organization.”

Resistance of the alcoholic hydroxyl group Of
ephedrine and epinephrine toward acetylation
under the experimental conditions appears note~
worthy. In the presence of as much as 15 to 30
molecular proportions Of anhydride, this functional
group remains virtually, if not literally, intact
while the amino and phenolic functions are quanti-
tatiVely acetylated.

Experimental

Finely powdered (—)—epinephrine5 (2.00 g., 0.0109 mole)
was added to a mixture of 60 g. of sodium bicarbonate and
200 cc. of water in a 1-1. erlenmeyer ﬂask. While the system
was vigOrously stirred by a motor-driven wire stirrer, 30
cc. (0.32 mole) of reagent grade acetic anhydride was added
cautiously in 4 equal portions. Violent foaming was con-
trolled by the addition Of a few drops of ether. When the
evolution of carbon dioxide had ceased after the last addition
of anhydride, the mixture was allowed to stand about ﬁve
minutes then extracted with six 100-cc. portions of chloro-
form. The ﬁltered extracts were concentrated on the steam—
bath to an Oil which was induced to crystallize by adding
ether and triturating. The yield of almost white prodﬁct
was quantitative (3.35 g.); m.p. 91—93° (c0r.). It was re-
crystallized with 90% recovery by dissolving it in acetone
(1.3 cc. /g_.) and adding 7 volumes of ether. Thrice-re—

The Use of Acetylation in the Quantitative
Separation of Ephedrine from Procaine*

December, 1947.]

By LLEWELLYN H. WELSH

Aqueous solutions of ephedrine give practically quantitative yields of the N-acetyl
derivative by the action of acetic anhydride in the presence of excess bicarbonate.
Under the same conditions procaine'appears to acetylate at its primary amino group
to yield a product which is basic by virtue of its tertiary nitrogen. The wide differ-
ence in properties of the acetyl derivatives of the two drugs permits their separation
by simple extraction procedures, and the gravimetric determination of ephedrine .as

its acetyl derivative.

The presence of small amounts of bisulﬁte greatly hinders the

acetylation of ephedrine. The presence of ephedrine does not interfere in the de-
termination of procaine by bromination.

RECENT WORK in this laboratory (1) es-

tablished that the reaction of ephe—
drine with acetic anhydride at 70° yields the
neutral N—acetyl derivative (hydroxyamide,
I), m. p. 86-870, and that‘the corresponding
O-acetyl compound (aminoester, II) is cap-
able of only a transitory existence before
quantitatively rearranging into the hy-
droxyamide. '

These facts suggest the possibility of using
acetylation in the analysis of drug mixtures
containing certain aminoalcohols. If acet-
ylation occurs quantitatively under condi-
tions similar to those employed for the con—
version of phenetedin to acetophenetedin
(2), it should be pOSsible to separate ephed-
rine and, perhaps, other aminoalcohols

having an ArCHOHCNH grouping from
.|

compounds containing unacetylatable basic

(e.g., tertiary amino) groups.

It was found that acetylation of ephedrine
at room temperature occurs rapidly in aque—
ous solution containing excess bicarbonate,
and yields 98.0—99.4 per cent of the theo—
retical amount of acetyl derivative. The
acetylation was then carried out on samples
containing 15-0 mg. of ephedrine hydrochlo-
ride and 30 mg. of procaine hydrochloride.

*Receizad June 27, 1947, from the Chemical Section,

Medical Division, Food and Drug Administration, Federal
Security Agency, Washington, D. C.

After acidiﬁcation of the reaction mixture,
the acetylephedrine was separated from the
acetylated procaine salt by extraction with
chloroform, and was determined gravimetri-
cally after removal of the solvent. Rec'ov-
eries of 97.6—99.2 per cent were obtained.
When the procedure was applied to a com-
mercial product purporting to contain in
each CC. 50 mg. of ephedrine hydrochloride,
10 mg. of procaine hydrochloride, and “not
more than” 1.5 mg. of sodium bisulﬁte, the
results indicated a shortage of 10—14 per cent
of ephedrine salt. Total solids and chloride
determinations, however, supported the
label declaration. Accordingly, a solution
was prepared which contained ca. 3 mg. of
sodium metabisulﬁte per 100 mg. of ephed~
rine hydrochloride. When aliquots of the
solution were subjected to the acetylation
procedure, recoveries of approximately 53%
resulted. The unacetylated ephedrine could
be extracted with chloroform after rendering
the aqueous phase alkaline with sodium hy-
droxide. If, however, before acetylating
the bisulﬁte was destroyed by the addition
of iodine-potassium iodide solution, normal
recovery percentages of . acetyl derivative
were obtained. The reason for the interfer-
ence of bisulﬁte in the acetylation of ephed—
rine is not apparent to the writer. The
molecular proportions of bisulﬁte, ephedrine,
acetic anhydride, and bicarbonate present
in the acetylation of the prepared solution
are approximately 1 :32:450:1500, respec-
tively. Whatever the interference mecha-
nism, one molecule of bisulﬁte effectively

373

blocks the acetylation of approximately
ﬁfteen molecules of ephedrine under the con—
ditions employed.

Although procaine appears to acetylate at
its primary amino group under the condi-
tions used in the acetylation of ephedrine,
the derivative obtained could not be in-
duced to crystallize. Procaine was deter-
mined in the presence of ephedrine by ex-
tracting the two compounds from alkaline
solution into chloroform, transferring them
from this solvent into aqueous solution by
shakeouts with dilute acid, adding a slight
excess of standard bromide-bromate solu-
tion to the acid extract, and back-titrating
with thiosulfate after adding potassium io-
- dide. Under these conditions ephedrine did
'not interfere with the bromination even
when present in amounts ﬁve times that of
the procaine, and the bromination results
were slightly better than 99 per cent of the
theoretical. The determination of procaine
by this method is considered to be expedient
rather than ideal, since it gives no informa-
tion concerning the nature of the material
brominated.

EXPERIMENTAL

(Melting points are corrected.)

Acetylation Procedure.—Sodium bicarbonate (3.0
Gm.) was added to a separatory funnel containing
ca. 150 mg. of ephedrine hydrochloride dissolved in
10 cc. of water. The funnel was swirled until the
liquid was practically saturated with bicarbonate,
and a total of 1 cc. of acetic anhydride was then
added in three approximately equal portions. After
each addition of anhydride the funnel was securely
stoppered and shaken vigorously. From time to
time the shaking was interrupted and the stopcock
was opened to release internal pressure. A fresh
portion of anhydride was not added until carbon
dioxide evolution resulting from the previous addi-
tion had practically ceased, and after each reaction
small amounts of ﬂuid in the stem and on the stop-
per and mouth of the funnel were rinsed back into
the main body of liquid with a few drops of water.
The reaction mixture was allowed to stand ﬁfteen
minutes after effervescence resulting from the last
addition of anhydride apparently had ceased. It
was then made acid to Congo red with 10% (w/v)
sulfuric acid (about 20 cc. was required), an addi-
tional 5 cc. was added, and the acetylephedrine was
extracted immediately with ﬁve 15—cc. portions of
chloroform. Each extract was shaken in another
funnel with a solution of 0.5 Gm. of sodium bicar-

bonate in 6 cc. of water to remove acetic acid before
ﬁltering through a pledget of cotton into a beaker.
The ﬁltered extracts were concentrated to a small
volume, transferred with chloroform to a tared 50-
cc. beaker (previously dried at 105° and cooled in a
desiccator), and the remainder of the solvent re-
moved on the steam bath in a current of air. The
residual resin of acetylephedrine was heated thirty
minutes in an oven at 105°, cooled in a desiccator,
and weighed rapidly. Although crystalline anhy-
drous acetylephedrine does not tend to gain weight
in the air under ordinary conditions, the super-
cooled substance does appear to gain slightly possibly
because of a tendency to form the mom ohydrate (3).
The weight of anhydrous residue multiplied by
0.9731 represents the equivalent of ephedrine hy-
drochloride. Residues of acetylephedrine crystal-
lized slowly when seeded and triturated. The sub-
stance is not appreciably volatile at 105°, since a
500-mg. sample suffered an apparent loss of only
0.5 mg. when left thirty minutes in an oven at this
temperature.

When bisulﬁte was present it was removed prior
to the introduction of bicarbonate by swirling the
funnel and adding, dropwise, a solution of 0.5 Gm.
of iodine and 1.5 Gm. of potassium iodide in 25 cc.
of water. After a slight excess of iodine had been
added, a few drops of starch solution were intro-

duced, and the blue color was discharged by addi-

tion of the necessary amount of 0.1 N sodium thio-
sulfate.

Table I lists recoveries obtained when the acetyla-
tion was carried out on solutions containing ephed-
rine hydrochloride (150 mg.) only, and solutions
containing, in addition, procaine hydrochloride
(30 mg.) and sodium metabisulﬁte (ca. 4.5 mg.)

217—218°, equivalent to 97.2% of the ephedrine
which had escaped acetylation.

When the procedure (modiﬁed in that extraction
was made from alkaline solution) was applied to a
150-mg. sample of procaine hydrochloride, a 100.3%
recovery of acetylprocaine was obtained. The color—
less, resinous material showed a neutralization
equivalent of 285 (calcd. 278.3 for C15H22N203).
Hazard and Corteggiani (4) have reported a melting
point of 74° for acetylprocaine, but material pre-
pared in this laboratory could not be obtained in a
crystalline condition. After the extraction of acet—
ylephedrine from acidiﬁed reaction mixtures also
containing acetylprocaine, the latter substance was
extracted into chloroform after basifying the aqueous
phase with sodium hydroxide. The approximately
30‘mg. residues of acetylprocaine obtained after
solvent removal amounted to 90—103% of the cal-
culated quantity.

Determination of Procaine.——-One cubic centi-
meter of 20% sodium hydroxide was added to 10
cc. of a solution containing 100 mg. of procaine
hydrochloride, 500 mg. of the corresponding ephed-
rine salt, and 15 mg. of sodium metabisulﬁte.
The alkaline solution was extracted with six 10-cc.
portions of chloroform. The combined chloroform
extracts were shaken with two 10—cc. portions of 5%
sulfuric acid, then with four 10-cc. portions of water.
The acid solution of ephedrine and procaine sulfates
was washed with 5 cc. of petroleum ether and drained
into a'ﬂask. The petroleum ether was then washed
three times With 10—cc. portions of water which were
added to the contents of the ﬂask. The acid solu-
tion was allowed to stand, with occasional shaking,
until the odor of petroleum ether had practically
disappeared and no ﬁne droplets of the solvent
could be observed. The volume was then adjusted
to about 150 cc. by the addition of water and 9 cc.
of conc. hydrochloric acid, and two drops of 0.1%
methyl red indicator were added. The solution
was brominated essentially as described by Wells
(5). Tenth—normal bromide-bromate solution was
added from a burette at a rate of approximately
two drops per second while the contents of the ﬂask
were constantly agitated. The indicator added
originally faded gradually during the bromination,
and an additional one or two drops were necessary
before the end of the titration. As the anticipated
end point was approached the speed of addition of

375

brominating reagent was reduced and the effect of
one-drop additions was observed. The approximate
end point was reached when the indicator suddenly
became decolorized, and a faint odor of bromine was
noticeable. About 1 Gm. of potassium iodide was
then dissolved in the solution, and back-titration
with 0.1 N sodium thiosulfate was effected in the
presence of starch. The required thiosulfate varied
between 0.1 and 0.2 cc. Results of determinations
ranged from 99.2% to 99.4% of the theoretical. A
blank determination carried through the several
stages described above, but in the absence of pro—
caine, resulted in the consumption of only 0.03 cc.
of bromide—bromate solution.

SUMMARY

Aqueous solutions of ephedrine give prac-
tically quantitative yields of the N-acetyl
derivative by the .action of acetic anhydride
in the presence of excess bicarbonate. Under
the same conditions procaine appears to
acetylate‘ at its primary amino group to
yield a product which is basic by virtue of its
tertiary nitrogen. The wide difference in
properties of the acetyl derivatives of the
two drugs permits their separation by simple
extraction procedures, and the gravimetric
determination of ephedrine as‘ its acetyl
derivative. The presence of small amounts
of bisulﬁte greatly hinders the acetylation
of ephedrine.

The presence of ephedrine does not inter-
fere in the determination of procaine by bro—
mination.

The Acetylation of Ephedrine in Dilute Aqueous
Solution*

By LLEWELLYN H. WELSH

The acetylation of ephedrine in about a one percent aqueous solution by means of
acetic anhydride in the presence of sodium bicarbonate has been studied. Yields of
96 to 97 per cent of N-acetylephedrine may be obtained by using approximately 3.6
moles of anhydride per mole of ephedrine, but for the reaction to proceed in a literally
quantitative manner, four times that amount of anhydride is required, and the reagent

must be added portionwise.
by a large excess of bicarbonate.

PREVIOUS WORK in this laboratory showed that

N -acety1ephedrine may be obtained in 98
to 99 per cent yield by the action of acetic anhy-
dride on a dilute (ca. 1%) aqueous solution of
ephedrine in the presence of sodium bicarbonate

( 1). The procedure was applied to the analytical
separation of ephedrine from procaine, and it was
suggested that acetylation under such conditions
might prove generally useful in the quantitative
separation of ephedrine and related drugs from
tertiary amines with which they might be com—
pounded.

A shortage of 1 to 2 per cent below a theoretical
recovery ﬁgure is of little practical importance
if, as in the previous work, one is concerned only
with the isolation of the ephedrine derivative
from the reaction mixture. However, that short-

age might be of signiﬁcance if it represents un-
acetylated ephedrine and if one is interested also
in quantitatively obtaining the pure tertiary
amino component of the mixture. Thus, if a
product were to contain ephedrine and a tertiary
amine in a 5:1 ratio, 2 per cent of unacetylated
(basic) ephedrine would eventually manifest itself
as 10 per cent of impurity in the basic fraction
containing the tertiary amine.

It was desirable, therefore, in order to improve
the eﬂiciency of the acetylation process, to study
modiﬁcations of the somewhat arbitrarily selected
conditions previously employed (1). Informa-
tion obtained from such a study also might per-
mit a better understanding of the fundamental
factors involved in acetylating substances in di—
lute aqueous solution. Therefore the following
theoretical considerations should be taken into
account.

546

In a system containing water, acetic anhydride,
and an acylable organic substance, 6. g., an amine,
two reactions occur simultaneously: acetylation
of the substance (Eq. 1) and hydrolysis of the
anhydride (Eq. 2).

HOH + Ac20 ———————> 2AcOH (2)

The velocities of the acetylation and hydrolysis
reactions at any instant may be symbolized by
m, and mg, respectively. According to principles
of mass action, each of these should have a maxi-
mum value initially when the concentration of
reactants is highest, and each should continuously
decrease as the reactions proceed and the con-
centration of reactants becomes progressively
smaller. Factors which increase the ratio vA/vH
should increase the yield of acetylation product
obtainable from a given quantity of anhydride.
In order that a quantitative yield of product be
obtained, the quantity of anhydride used must
obviously be in excess of that stoichiometrically
equivalent to the amount of acylable substance.

It is desirable to have present in the system a
base which will neutralize the acetic acid formed,
and thus allow the amine to retain its most easily
acylable (free) form, shown in Eq. 1. Sodium
bicarbonate is particularly useful for this purpose
in pharmaceutical analysis, since by maintaining
the pH of the system near the neutral point, it
does not effectively promote, as does strong alkali,
the decomposition of sensitive substances1 by
atmospheric oxygen.

EXPERIMENTAL

Reagents._Sodium bicarbonate and acetic an—
hydride (A. C. S., reagent grades) were employed.
The anhydride was Merck & Company material
(“suitable for microanalysis”) the purity of which was
established as being 95% at the time of this work.

The strength of the anhydride was found to be
important, particularly in those reactions in which
the smaller quantities of anhydride were employed.
Thus, under the conditions of experiment 4, Table
I, anhydride having an assay value of 85% afforded
an average yield of 92.8% instead of the average
yield of 96.8% obtained by the use of a 95% reagent.

Procedure.—~Samples of ephedrine hydrochloride
(150.0 mg., 0.744 millimole) were dissolved in 10.0

1 By application of the technique described herein, quanv
titative yields of acetylation products having a high degree
of purity have been obtained from the following substances:
o- and p-aminophenol, catechol, pyrogallol, hydroquinone,
morphine, epinephrine, and phenylephrine. In each case,
phenolic hydroxyl groups and primary and secondary amino
groups were acylated, whereas the secondary alcoholic func—
tions of the latter three compounds were unaffected.

On a preparative scale, where the concentration of reagents
is high and reaction is almost instantaneous, sodium hydrox—
ide has been used with excellent results by Chattaway (2) in
acetylating such substances.

cc. (556 millimoles) of distilled water contained in a
125—cc. separatory funnel. Sodium bicarbonate
was added and the funnel was swirled until the bicar—
bonate had dissolved, or, in the experiments involv—
ing larger amounts of the reagent, until the solution
had become saturated. Acetic anhydride was rap-
idly injected into the funnel by means of a calibrated
1-cc. hypodermic syringe; the funnel was immedi—
ately stoppered and vigorously shaken until the evo-
lution of carbon dioxide had ceased (four to ﬁve
minutes; shaking was interrupted momentarily
several times to release pressure in the system).
After the reaction mixture had been allowed to
stand ﬁve minutes, it was acidiﬁed with 10% (w/v)
sulfuric acid (10 cc., experiments 1—14; 15 cc., ex-
periment 15; 20 cc., experiments 16, 17) and ex—
tracted with six 20— to 25—cc. portions of chloroform.
Each extract was shaken in a second funnel with a
solution of 0.6 Gm. of bicarbonate in 6 cc. of water,
and then was ﬁltered through a pledget of cotton.
Removal of solvent, heating of residues, etc., was
carried out as previously described (1).

Residues of acetylephedrine obtained melted at
84.5 to 855° (corr.) after being induced to crystal—
lize. The pure recrystallized substance melts at
85.5 to 865° (3).

RESULTS

In the experiments which were conducted, the
quantities of water and ephedrine were kept con—
stant while the amounts of anhydride and bicar-
bonate were varied as indicated in Table I.

In the presence of an amount of bicarbonate about
10% in excess of that required to neutralize the ace-
tic acid formed (experiments 1—4), yields of acetyl—
ephedrine did not approach a virtually quantitative
ﬁgure (96.8% av.) until the quantity of anhydride
was approximately three and six-tenths times the
equivalent of the ephedrine present (experiment 4).
Doubling this quantity of acylating agent (experi—
ment 14) increased the average yield about 0.5%,
while quadrupling it (experiment 16) raised the yield
an additional 1%. A literally quantitative yield
(99.9% av.) Was obtained under the conditions of
experiment 17 which differed from those of experi—
ment 16 only in that the anhydride was added in
three approximately equal portions instead of being
added in one lot.

The results of experiments 4—14 show that, within
wide limits, excess of bicarbonate does not exercise
an appreciably adverse effect on yields. Thus in
experiments 7—9, the yield is constant within experi—
mental reproducibility when the excess is within
the range of 10—35%. Even when the excess is
raised to 56%, an increment of 21%, the yield is not
materially affected (experiment 10). However,
two additional 2l%—increments of excess (experi—
ments 11, 12) are associated with a decrease in yield
of ca. 3 % per increment.

DISCUSSION

From the experimental results, it is evident that as
the quantity of acetylating combination (anhydride
and a proportionate amount of bicarbonate) is in-
creased, the percentage of anhydride utilized by the
acetylation reaction is decreased. In experiment 1,
for example, 53% of the 0.1-0 cc. of anhydride is

ment 2, 42% of the 0.15 cc. is utilized. From these
ﬁgures it may be calculated that only 20% of the
increment of anhydride is involved in acetylation.
The data indicate that under the experimental con-
ditions the ratio of the velocity of acetylation, m,
to the velocity of hydrolysis, 723, is not a relatively
constant one, but changes in such a way that vA/vH
diminishes in value progressively from an initial
maximum as the reactions proceed in the system
and the concentration of reactants (with the excep-
tion of water) become progressively lower. Such a
phenomenon may be related in part to a difference
in the kinetic orders of the two reactions.2

Evidence that it is at least partly related to a salt
effect of sodium acetate, the concentration of which
builds up as the reactions proceed, is provided by the
results Of experiments 14 and 15 which show that
the yield, and therefore the average vA/vH, is lowered
by the presence of the salt.3

Excess bicarbonate may diminish the average
value of vA/vH by virtue of exercising a salt effect
similar to that shown by sodium acetate. HOW—
ever, altering the ratio may be related at least
partly to the fact that a large excess of bicarbonate
signiﬁcantly affects the pH of the system. This

2 Change of the value of the expression vA/lfH in the ob-
served direction could result from a situation in which the
acetylation reaction is a second order process, With a veloc1ty
dependent on the concentration of both ephedrine and an-
hydride, and the hydrolysis reaction is a ﬁrst order process,
the velocity of which (because of the large excess .of water)
IS dependent only on the concentration of anhydride. _ Hy-
drolysis of the anhydride, however, probably occurs Simul-
taneously by two mechanisms, one involving water mole-
cules, the other involving hydroxyl ions. _ . _ ~ ‘ .

3 One way in which this ratio may be diminished is by in-
creasing L'H. In this connection, it is pertinent to note that
Szabo (4) has observed that the velocity of hydrolySis of
acetic anhydride is increased by acetate ion. In this labo—
ratory, evidence has been obtained that the powerfully adverse
eﬂect of sulﬁte (bisulﬁte) ion on the acetylation of 8131165111116
in aqueous bicarbonate solution (1) is largely, if not entirely,

due to the ability of the ion to increase catalytically the
hYdrolysis rate of acetic anhydride.

possibility is suggested by the observation that,
under the conditions of experiment 7 (10% excess
bicarbonate), the pH of the system ranged from 8.17
before the addition of anhydride to 6.34 after com-
pletion of the reaction, whereas under the conditions
of experiment 12 in which the quantity of bicarbon-
ate was about twice the calculated amount, the pH
range was 8.11 to 7.75.4

The fact that the anhydride is less efﬁciently
utilized in experiment 16 than in experiment 17
may be related to the following circumstance. In
the former reaction, the volume of anhydride added
at one time is relatively large; the reagent therefore
may not dissolve practically instantaneously in the
saturated bicarbonate solution, but may instead
form a second (anhydride—water) liquid phase, hav—
ing an appreciable life, in which the value of 21A / '03 is
relatively small compared with that of the average
ratio prevailing in the principal aqueous phase.

SUMMARY

A study has been made to determine conditions
necessary for the quantitative conversion of
ephedrine, in dilute aqueous solution, to its N-
monoacetyl derivative.

Factors affecting acetylation in an aqueous
medium have been discussed.

4 The possibility that the eﬂect of sodium acetate like-
wise may be due in part to an ability of the salt to change the
pH of the system appears to be ruled out by the observation
that in experiments 14 and 15, the pH ranges were 8.09 to
6.85 and 8.12 to 6.92, respectively. The measureddiﬁerence
in ranges is not regarded as being experimentally Signiﬁcant.

Both eradication campaigns were successful . . . very great knowledge

about biology with the knowledge of many other sciences . . . use of cobalt

on the screw worm fly and release of billions . . . so that ultimately the

screw worm fly was eliminated.

I doubt that people generally realize the tremendous knowledge that

must be gained by these people. Such a tremendous to our country

it was when both of the eradication campaigns took place . . .

I probably have talked too long—~I know they always say that Southern

(Senators do) . . . but I am not here to filibuster, I am here to give some

awards.

Before I present them, may I present to you Mrs. Mulhern and.Mrs. Jones,
if they will please stand. I thought it was highly important for them to
be here tonight because, in addition to the medals, there is a check . . . so
I think we have something here to be rejoicing about tonight.

Now, charged with the important responsibility of enforcement of this
new law, which is the main purpose of this award tonight . . . have behind
them years of service . . . helped to accomplish at least three of the most

important eradication campaigns in our nation.

Medals, presented t-i: year when there are two of them.
these medals of the Animal Welfare Institute have been awarded beginning
with the original medal to Dr. Schweitzer himself in l95h, which was pre-

you should wish to give my name to the medal. I give you this righ

ethically incorporates our compassionat« uﬁzitude towards all reatures,
would be noticed and recognized during my lifetime. I knew that this

interest in them," So spoke Dr; Albert Schweitzer in receiving the first
medal in l95h.
I wish I had the time and Opportunity to comment on each of the

i great former recipients of this medal but I cannot do that. I just want

to say that last year and this year, in particular, the award has been keyed
to the passage and the beginning of enforcement of the Laboratory Animal

~ welfare Act, mentioned by Mrs. Stevens, which was approved by the President
last August, 1966, and immediately put into Operation, as the result of

a Supplemental ApproPriations Act, and which is now getting in full-fledged
Operation under the direction of two outstanding officials of the U. S.
Department of Agriculture who are to receive as Medallists this award, which
is of great pride to them and to others in the Department of Agriculture,
which is charged with primary responsibilities.

I might say that I am particularly happy, too, that this year, in
addition to keying thesc awards to this Act and its implementation, each
f the medallists is cited for their great services to animals in connection
with their work over the years in the Department of Agriculture in preventing
vast amounts of animal suffering through their skillful and scientific eraii-
cation of major animal diseases and pCSLS and particularly in connection with
two important eradication campaigns of which I know a little and which 1
i am going to mention later. Shose of us who are interested so deeply in

humane objectives toward animals for their own sake realize how frequently

these objectives are coupled witl economic reasons for their legal enforce~

the two campaigns which I shall mention ~ one the eradication of a terrible
disease or animals, and the other, eradication of a pest scourge of the great~

est destructive importance, I am glad that we are coupling out’interest in

ment. As to our two men - men that have performed outstanding services in

I speak to all of you tonight with a deep and honest gratitude.
It is a deep and honest gratitude for who you are, what you are, and what
you have done. For the Secretary, the Department at large, and for myself?
I thank you for the help you have given us in a difficult but most important
task. And for all of us, I thank you for the honor which you have given to
my friends and colleagues.

I also speak with a deep and honest pride in what these two friends
and colleagues who receive this honor are, and for what they have done. I
have pride in the help they have had from so many people in the Department.

It is especially gratifying that this honor comes to our friends
in the ume of a great and good man -- Albert Schweitzer. He was a man of
medicine -- but he was also a man of arts and letters, a man
with joy. He was a man of gentility and wisdom.and kindness, with deeply-
seated respect for mankind and for life at large. He was a scholar,

a scientist, an; eclectic, and universalist of a kind rarely seen in
this twentieth century.

It is not alone respect for animal life that is involved in
assuring decent and dignified treatment of animal life. To do so
is of itself a good thing to do. It has been and is now a difficult thing to
do. It is still an uncompleted task. There is much ahead of us.

Yet we do more than serve animal life in respecting the dignity
of such life. What our predecessors have done and what we have done and
are doing has been done and is being done in service to ourselves as human
beings. We do this in simple deference to,and with simple reSpect for,

in the standards of human dignity that are becoming to those of us

fortunate enough to be borng as human beings.

(more)

 




This respect for decency and dignity and theédeference to humanity
in the treatment of animal life will also improve the quality of science ~-
and thus further serve the needs and the values of mankind.

I have Special pride in, and special gratitude to, both
Dr. Jones and Dr. Mulhearn —- I have said they are friends as well as
colleagues.

post

Yet tonight I think I know, even in the/ﬁadt in which I work,
that there is as much to do in this next year, next decade, next century as has
been done in the last year, decade and century.

I think I know your values and your purposes, and they are
our purposes. In the work that you are doing, we are with you without
reservation, without equivocation, without qualification. The work that you
are doing must be done. Science will be the better for it. More important, the
quality of human life will also be the better.

We will be with you in the years ahead as we have been with

you in the past.

“we
~£he the Animal Welfare Institute we are grateful. Of both

my friends —- Dr. Jones and Dr. Mulhearn, we are proud, deeply proud.
