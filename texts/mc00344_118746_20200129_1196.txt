OST Washington observers inter-

pret the November election re-
sults as indicating that nothing of
importance Will be accomplished by
the new congress in agriculture. This
is based on the idea of an irresistable
force (Democratic-dominated con-
gress) hitting an immovable object
(White House veto). This may well
turn out to be the case, but at this
point it is not safe to assume this
course of events.

The key to farm legislation lies
beneath the surface—the degree of
determination and unity of. Demo-
crats and like-thinking Republicans
to get new legislation. If a strong
desire develops, the chances for new
laws are much better than they have
been during the past six years. This
is because the Democrats are in
reach of over-riding the veto (if they
want to) on farm and other matters.

In the senate, they are shy only
four votes for a 2/3 majority, needed
to over-ride, and in the house they
are eight short. A united anti—
Benson front could put almost any
farm legislation through.

ECRETARY BENSON recently ap- '

pointed a new committee to advise
him on developing new and improved
methods of humane slaughter of food
animals. A notable omission from
the committee is Mrs. Christine
Stevens, secretary—treasurer of the
Society for Animal Protective Legis-
isms, ' b , i ' ’
“Mi?” Stevens has been a strong
and outspoken advocate of humane
slaughter legislation, and gets the
lion’sshare of the credit for putting

1W0 Waste Permitted

In Meat-Packing Plant:

By ANN. onnsrnng 2’?

Food Editor

When you buy a steak, pork
chops, lamb shoulder, do you
ever think of what happens to
the rest of the animal?

One of the more fascinating
pursuits involved in food-writing,
is the opportunity it affords to
see, the preparation of products
from their source. A trip through
one ,of Wilson and Company’s
packing plants and stock yards,
reemphasized the progress and
the protection provided us by our
national food firms. It also pro-
vided impressive information on
lack of waste.

 

Use for Everything '

The five-year average" annual
slaughter of animals is over 20
million cattle, 12 million calves,
84 million hogs, 25 million sheep.

 

Nothing is wasted, and well
equipped research laboratories
consthafpw in new uses fdr‘Ti-ts
and ,grpar s.

The natural casings are used
for both edible and inedible pur-
poses. Their principal value is as
containers of sausage. They are
less subject to ﬂavor loss than
some substitute casings, but the
latter are coming into increasing
use because there are‘just not
enough casings for all the frank-
furters, sausages, bolognas and
other prepared meats that Amer-
icans are eating. Non-food uses
Of animal intestines include sur-

 

gical sutures, sporting equip-
ment, musical in s t r u m e n t
strings. We were told, at Wil-

son’s, that it takes 11 lambs to

  
 
 

produce a sufficient quantity of
String for a single tennis racket.

Hide Removal Difﬁcult

Our Wilson guide stated the
best paid worker in the six-story
plant was he who removed the
hides from cattle. This is'a deli-
cate business requiring great
skill in order that no nicks ap-
pear. Of the inedible by-products,
cattle hides, and sheep pelts are
the most important. Hides repre-
sent 50 per cent of the total by-
product value of cattle and sheep
pelts, 80 per cent of the. by-prod-
not. value of sheep.

Leather goods an d sports
equipment absorb most of the
hides.

Expanding rapidly is u s e of
cattle and hog hair. Curled cattle
hair goes into mattresses, furni-
ture, automobile upholstery." Cat-
tle body hair is used in felt’ and
rug pads. The fine hair from the
ear makes the artist’s “camel
hair” brush. The next refriger-
ated truck passing you on the

Winter hog hair.

Bones Have a Place

From the animal bones come
materials for piano keys, knife
handles,~ buttons, and cosmetics,
no less.

Non-food fats go into soap.
Glycerine is a by-product of the
soap industry and this was one
of the reasons we were put to
a grease-saving program during
the war.

The medicinal uses of many
animal products are legion, of
course.

 

As Humane as Possible

Killing animals, is of course,
never a pleasing procedure. De-
spite our many new approaches
in all areas of human endavor,
killing of beef cattle is still done
in the old-fashioned way. As the
cattle come from the chute, each
animal is struck over the head
with a mallet. Unconscious, it is
strung up by the hind legs, the
throat is cut, the blood drained,
and the processing begins. Plant
procedures are highly immacu-
late.

West had between 10 and 15 per
cent women employes, engaged
in‘the same work as the men ex-

 

 

cept for the actual slaughtering.
Huge aprons and hip boots pro-
tect them. The bacon-wrapping
room sounded like a girls’ prep

school. The only male was the '

foreman, and women’s voice
and hands filled the air as the

sliced, weighed, wrapped and
packaged ,the fragrant bacon.
And bacon in -.the mid-West is
now selling for only 39 cents a
pound, girls.

LET’S MAKE SLOW
HASTE ON HUMANE
SLAUGHTER BILL

No one denies that the moti-
vations behind A-133, Assem-
blyman Werner’s H .iie
Slaughter Bill, are of e best.

The Bill’s intent is ‘to rein-
zforce Federal legislation on the
subject and to make sure that
all meat animals slaughtered in
New Jersey shall be slaughter-
ed by humane methods—not
ms; ly those slaughtered in
plants which sell meat to the
Federal Government. Only the
latter plants are covered by the
Federal law, and many New
Jersey plants are n at so
,covered.

r Since the object of the Wer-
ner bill is to prevent cruelty to
animals, it naturally has en-
listed strong support from many
groups and individuals. But it
!is opposed by Jewish organiza-
tions, even thou h it recognizes
ithe act of J ewis ritual slaugh-
ter (Schechita). as humane and

 

 

specifies it as one method of'

slaughter authorized by the .bill
if it becomes law. . 4 ‘
, Jewish opposition .to the bill
is in no way based on hostility
to its objectives. The Jewish
religious and community or-
ganizations present at the re-
cent Assembly committee hear-
ing on the bill made this fact
emphatically clear. Indeed, they
pointed out, Jewish tradition

and practice has required hu-

mane treatment of animals for

thousands-of years, and Jevvish
ritual slaughter has been recog-

' nized worldwide as entirely hu-
mane—the first recorded ex-
ample of hum "ne slaughter
being required by religious or
secular law. . _

Opposition to the bill is based
on the fact v'dthatmdata» on the
most humane methods , of
slaughter are still incomplete,
and that enactment of the bill
should be deferred until they
are complete. .

The Federal law enacted last
year directed the Department
of Agriculture to establish a
I National Advisory Committee
l to undertake research in hu-
. mane slaughter techniques. This
, committee of 12 men includes

representatives of p a-cking
houses, unions, livestock grow-
ers, humane groups, etc, and
has already begun the research
directed by Congress.

But its studies are far from
eimplete, It expects, to carry
them on through the Federal
fiscal year of 1960, and to make
findings at that time. These
findings would be available to
the 1961 Legislature. But any
legislation based on data avail-
able now might fall far short
of the objectives sought. Op-
ponents of A-133 argue that it
should await the Federal com-

. mittee findings. -
An independent two-year
1 study sponsored by 56 ‘J-eWish
2 organizations is also under wav
intothe most humane practical
method-s of’preparing animals
for Jewish religious slaughter.
When completed, its reports
will be available to the New
1 Jersey Legislature, to the meat
3 industry and the nation at
large, But they also are not
available as yet. " .

Opponents of A-133 also pomt
cut that uniformity throughout
the United States onliumane

slaughter laws. is desirable.
States that go ahead and'legis-
late now on the subject, in .the
absence of full information,
take upon themselves the risk
.of setting up a crazy auilt,
patchwork pattern of legisla-
tion that could cause complete

chaos. A slaughter method de-
clared humane by law on one
side of a state border could be
declared inhumane 50 feet away
on the other side of the border.
It was precisely to avaid this
kind of, chaos, and to obtain uni-
formity, that the Federal Gov.
ernment intervened in the field
of humane slaughter legislation.

Humane slaughter bills were
introduced in 1 0 other state
legislatures this year, but in
each of them passage was de-
cided to be premature. and ac-
tion was deferred until future
sessions f0r the reasons given
here. _

While we are strongly in
favor of humane slaughter
legislation and have repeatedly
said so, we believe it would be
unwise if A-133 were enacted
now. We agree that a New Jer-
sey law should ' await the re-
search and studies now under

wa . _ . .

When their findings are.
available, a definitive and au-
thoritative law can be enacted

that will be sure to attain the.
" objectives sought. Until then

way hinder the religiouswf‘ifeedom
of any person or group. Notwith-
standing any other provision of this
act, in order to protect freedom of
religion, ritual slaughter and the
handling or other preparation of
livestock for ritual slaughter are ex—
empted from the terms of this act.”
The New Hampshire measure car—
ries a penalty of a maximum $1,000
fine, or imprisonment for not more
than one year, or both.

-Meanwhile, testimony for and
against the proposed New Jersey
humane slaughter law (A—133),
which would subject Violators to a
$500 ﬁne, was heard in Trenton this
week by the Assembly committee
on agriculture, conservation and
economic development. A Michi-
gan humane slaughter bill (HR-196)
was killed by a 7-to-4 vote in the
House agriculture committee, but
Rep. Charline White (D-Detroit),
who was one of the sponsors of the
measure, said efforts will be renewed
in the 1960 legislature. A Missouri
measure (8-292) also died as the
General Assembly of that state ad-
journed several weeks ago.

Humane slaughter statutes have
been enacted in Washington, Minne—
sota and California, in addition to
Wisconsin. Only California followed
the lead of the federal government
in its enforcement provision. Penalty
for failure to employ humane meth—
ods in California, effective July 1,
1960, will be loss of any business
with the state. The Washington act,
effective the same date, will subject
slaughterers who use a manually—
operated hammer or sledge to im—
prisonment in the county jail for not
more than 90 days, or a fine of not
more than $500, or both. The Min—
nesota law, effective January 1,
1961, declares that any slaughterer
who does not use humane methods
“is guilty of a gross misdemeanor
and shall be punished accordingly.”

To the Editor:

The federal humane slaughter law re-
cently enacted should be supplemented
by a similar law in each state because the
federal law affects only packers selling
meat directly to the federal government.

Each year 20,000,000 animals may be
subjected to such treatment as the chain
hoist, by which a struggling, screaming
hog, and even a ton-weight bull, is hOisted
by a chain slipped over the hind leg or
by being knocked to the floor- With a
sledge hammer, used repeatedly, and
causing agonizing head injuries.

When animals are slaughtered by
methods now in use, the flesh is bruised,
and the meat is unfit for consumption.
The cost of the damage is borne by the
farmer, who receives lower prices for
livestock, and by the housewife, who pays
higher prices for meat. The economic .
effect of state laws will be reflected in
more money for the farmer and lower
prices to the c0nsumer.

Many legislators are in doubt as to the
wishes of the voters and would appreci-

Wisconsin IS the fourth state to enact humanewslaughter legisla—
tion, and the New Hampshire legislature, which passed a bill
and then, upon threat of veto, recalled the measure for amend-
ment, is expected to be not far behind.

The Wisconsin statute, to be administered by the State De—
partment of Agriculture, is an amended version of 8-331,
the text of which appeared in the NP of May 9, 1959. In ad-
dition to the usual deﬁnition of humane method, requiring
animals to be “rendered insensible to pain by a single blow
or shot of a mechanical instrument or by electrical, chemical
or other means that is rapid and effective,” the original bill
declared the Jewish ritual slaughtering method to be humane.
This was broadened to include “the method of slaughtering,
including handling and other preparation for slaughter, re-
quired by or used in connection with the ritual of any reli—
gous faith, whereby the animal suffers loss of consciousness by
anemia of the brain caused by the simultaneous and instan—
taneous severance of the carotid arteries with a sharp instru-
ment.” The prohibition clause originally read: “No slaughtei‘er
may slaughter livestock or handle livestock in connection
with slaughter except by a humane method.” The phrase “or
handle livestock in connection with slaughter” has been de-
leted. Effective July 1, 1960, licensed slaughterers who Violate
the act will be subject to a fine of not more than $100.

Jewish groups protesting the absence of a religious freedom
clause in the New Hampshire legislation (HR—364), though
it declares ritual slaughtering to be humane, prompted the
threat of veto by Gov. Wesley Powell. The bill was recalled
and referred to the Senate public health committee for
amendment in line with the federal act, which reads: “Nothing

in this act shall be construed to prohibit, abridge, or in any

Assembly Report

 

caring ls Reported '

By Assemblyman John W. Davis

Fort ’Mott —-— As the Legisla-
ture has been enjoying its sum-
mer recess, there/has been rel-
atively little activity in Trenr
ton. Of course, every few days
some candidate for something
makes a supposedly startling
revelation relative to a future
course of action. But .I suspect
most people recognize these
things for what they are.

On July 13, in the Assembly
Chamber in Trenton, a public
hearing was held on Assembly
,Bill 133, generally referred to as
the Humane Slaughter Act. As
many people have expressed an

interest in .just what transpired, _

, and what the future of that par-
ticular legislation appears to be,
I will try to give something of
a general synopsis. ,

As Chairman of the Commit-
~ tee, I attempted to, conduct this
hearing in an orderly, democra-
tic manner. I can assure you
that a combination of religion
and great emotion makes this
difficult to do.

_IA-s an indication of the pub-
11c interest, ‘I was informed by
observers that this hearing was
one of the largest in years. Of
the some 300 persons who at-
: tendedanid ' participated, I am

iegﬁill

is that the advocates of A-‘133
say, in effect, We recognize your
right to your own; religions prac-
tices, and even-{rec‘ognize your
slaughter methods are humane,
but there should be regulations
regarding thosev’who are now
inadequately regulated, and not,
handling and Killing humane-
l . . , L
yThese are the. g‘eneral-fin-gre-b
dients that made for quite a'
verbal battle. . . ‘

Some people gotaditt’le out
of hand as they yielded to their
emotions, but, generally it was
an. orderly session... ‘ .

It may be r ffalled that the
measure under aiscussion, A1133,
had been releaséd ,‘by our Com-
mittee for vote hy the Assembly
membership e2§1y last Spring;
This was d-onefﬁgfter. presenta-
tions were mad ,«to‘ the Commit-
tee by private ggcups, represent-
ing the variousg- points of View
during our regplar- committee
meetings. ‘g’if : .

We of the Cor, f'ittee felt that
an issue that j‘7ea'ntjso much
to so many peot 5e. should not be
bottled up in ommittee, but
should be put o'n,-'if§he‘7.£t10‘0r for a
vote so that th

 

tmembers rep-
resenting peopl‘ ‘ all parts

 

é:';.h~aippy3'to Say there Were several
3.,Salem Countiapns with us,

‘P'u rpose Reviewed

,To review just a little, this Bill
was des1g‘ned to abOlish alleg-v
ed. inhumane practices preSently
ex1st1ng-O in many slaughter
houses 1n New Jersey today. It
Is patterned in general after the
Federal Act which will take ef-
feet in July of 1960. ‘

The suggested need for a State
Act is that the Federal Act will
cover only slaughter houses

 

dealing with or supplying the
Federal Government or some of
its agencies.

The developed opposition has
come from the Jewish Commun-
ity, who feel that this Bill has
implications which could even-
tually interfere with their relig-
ious ritual regarding the proper
slaughter and preparation
me-atf .,

They cite some countries in
Europe that instituted humane
slaughter legislation which
eventually became so stringentT
as to virtually outlaw their re-l
ligious practices regarding ko—l
Sher meat. ' '2'

I might add there is general;
agreement that the Jewish:
methodof slaughter is humane!

Other Side of Issue ‘

The other side of the issue,

 

 

of __.._.

d register their
l ,
Regardless of what your think-

.ing On this subject may he,

think you would have to agree
that-for a committee to kill leg-
lslatloin in such 'a manner would
be undemocratic. ‘ ‘

The. Assembly. leadership sent
the Bill back to’ our Committee
and asked that ,we hold a pub-
lic hearing 59 that certain
pomts could be publicly clarified.
Whether I agree with the pro"
cedure '18 another matter, but
tins was the reasoning behind
1 . ,

Points to Be: Clarified

.As to the fears relative to
their religious hiberties, express-
ed by religious ;grOUps, I think
there are somé’ points that
should be clarif'fed‘f and empha-
51zed. Section 81F (‘6) ,of A-133

' this Session,

is identical to the correspond-‘
ing section in the Federal Act,
which definitely spells out that
NOTHING in the whole act shall
in any way be applicable or in-
terfere with recognized relig-
ious practices.

iI know it has been suggest-
ed that similar inoffensive
starts were made in other coun-
tries, and that abolition of re-
ligious rights will eventually re-
sult here, but I honestly do not
feel the situations are' a true
parallel.

Our Constitution made many
guarantees when it was drawn,
and it stillnst-ands as a monu-
ment to the Wisdom and vision
of those who drew it. The guar-
antee, regarding religious prac-
tices is just as definite as the

 

. guarantee regarding freedom of?

press and the (pursuit of harprpi-i.
ne‘ss. The Constitution is just ask
good and valid today as it was.
180 years, ago, and will continue
to be as Ion-g as this nation ex-
ists as we» know it today. '

‘As population increases, and;
we, of necessity, live in .cloSer,
proximity, we naturally have tot
sacrifice certain privileges and:
live more regulated lives, but“
I feel we will never be deprived:
of the basic liberties guaranteed.
in the Constitution. ’

No Action This Year

Well, enough of the “soap
box” philosophy, but 51 felt it"
was necessary to explain my

 

position and feelings on the sub!
ject. I' have had a few requests
for copies of A-133, and Will'be
happy to send them'to interested
parties so they maymore thorg
“Oughly “familiarize ‘ themselves
with the provisions, guarantees
and prohibitions.

=1 have been frequently asked,
particularly of late, what ap-

pears to ”be the fate of A-‘133. ‘I '

would have to say that due to
the limited number ofsessmns
planned for the remainder of

it would appear
somewhat unlikely that this Bill
will have time to pass the House
and Senate this year. .

I 'personally believe 1n the
Bill. It regulates in an area
where regulation is needed, and
yet guarantees once again. .to
protect the rights of minorities.
This to me seems reasonable.

:Next week I will go into the
matter of the Governor’s plan to
solve the transit problem in New
Jersey, as the special sesswn of
the Legislature to act on th .-
proposal will have been held/Z
that time. ' '

i tribute to the good people who are
endeavoring to put through a bill

concerning humane treatment of

To Mrs. Betty Bill, chairman of

Wishes for the success of their cam-i '~

It is indeed distressing that in
our country there is even .a need

for such legislation. My sister, who ‘
was president of many charitable 1‘

of her favorites was the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Ani- f,

Plant Divinely Nursed.”
Therefore, being divinely nursed,

the plant of charity would contain

true religion. Because of this, then,

how is it possible that any human 1‘1
aspect, such as financial gain orf:1

loss, should be considered?

If Grace Dunn were with me now,
I know that she would like to say
these things. So, in the wonder of gt
remembering her, may I say again,
and God :

for her, “Best wishes
bless you for your true charity.”

SLAUGHTER V LAW
Editor, Soap Box:

The federal. humamm

law recently enacted should be
~ supplemented by a similar law
in each state, because the federal
law affects only packers selling
meat directly to the federal
government.

Each year 20,000,000 animals

may be subjected to such treat- ‘

ment as“ the chain hoist, by which

a struggling, screaming hog, and 9
even a ton-weight bull, is hoisted

by a chain slipped over the bin

leg or by being knocked to the 7

ﬂoor with a sledge hammer, used
repeatedly, and causing agonizing
head injuries. .

When animals are slaughtered .1

by methods now in use, the flesh
is bruised and the meat is unfit
for consumption. The cost of the
dainage is borne by the farmer,
who receives lower prices for live-
stock, and by the housewife who
pays higher prices for meat. The
economic effect of state laws will
be reflected in more money for
the farmer, and lotver prices to
the consumer.

Many legislators are in doubt
as to the wishes of voters, and
would appreciate an expression
by residents of their states.

1959

FTER experimenting with the air-powered stun—

ner for ﬁve months at its Ottumwa plant, John

Morrell & Co. has adopted the tool for beef stun-
ning at its three cattle slaughtering plants at Ottumwa,
Estherville and Sioux Falls. Although the tool was se—
lected to bring the stunning operation into compliance
with hu'maneﬂsﬂlaughter regulations, its performance
has beenmhd tol'wbﬂewefﬁcient and economical, reports
John Blankenship, vice president of operations.

Tests conducted by Ross Kluckhohn, mechanical di—
vision superintendent, established that the power cost
to operate the stunner is 10¢ per eight-hour day. For
trouble-free operation the tool requires the use of a
high air pressure—190 psi—says Blankenship, and to
provide this pressure a separate compressor, has been
installed in the beef dressing department. A two—fold
economy is realized through this installation. First, the
compressor is sized to meet the beef killing load, which
is the only department requiring high pressure air.
Second, piping installation costs and air pressure losses
are minimized.

The tool possesses automatic repeater type action
permitting the stunner to immobilize cattle within sec-
onds. At the Ottumwa plant, one operator stuns six cat-
tle in about 15 seconds. The stunner, which was devel-
oped by the Thor Power Tool Co. of Aurora, 111., is a
cylindrical instrument 2.5 in. in diameter, 30 in. long
and weighs less than 8 lbs.

A safety lever that must be depressed before the tool
will ﬁre is located at the back of the instrument where it
connects with the air hose. The operator holds the
tool with both hands, one on the safety lever and the
other just above its barrel. The length of the stunner
and its light weight permit him to bring the activating
tip quickly into contact with the back of the animal’s
skull where it makes junction with the spinal cord.
There is a natural depression at this point which is easy
to locate. Upon making contact, the stunner ﬁres a 0.5-in.

Morrell Employs

Air Stunner for
Cattle at Three
Maior Plants

diameter metal penetrating bolt into the base of the
poll. The stunner has repeat action so that the bolt im-
mediately retracts to the ﬁring position.

The same level of air pressure is used on all cattle.

Stunning the cattle at the base of the poll results in
minimum damage to hide and generally causes no dam—
age to the brain, reports Blankenship.

At SiouxFalls, where the Morrell organization is ob-
serving its ﬁftieth anniversary in the city, the company
has increased its slaughtering capacity about 50 per
cent in the same space by installing a rail dressing
system for beef.

0. F. Matthews, general manager of all rail stock pur—
chases and sales and coordinator of beef departments,
says that the Sioux Falls plant now can kill 140 cattle
per hour compared with 95 head per hour prior to the
installation of the beef rail dressing system equipped
with a Globe Can—Pak hide pu11er. The animals for this
expanded slaughter operation are stunned with a Thor
tool. The beef coolers also have been enlarged.

At each of its beef slaughtering operations, Morrell
has two spare stunners which are immediately avail-
able if the one in use becomes inoperative.

C. C. Emberton, superintendent, and Paul Bissel, di—
vision superintendent, worked closely with Kluckhohn
in the study and installation of the Thor stunning sys-
tem at Ottumwa.

SERVING THE MEAT & BY-PRODUCT MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES SINCE 1891

15 WEST HURON ST. 0 CHICAGO 10, ILLINOIS - WH 4-3380

November 29, 1961

hiss Christine Stevens
Animal Welfare Institute

Dear.ﬁiss Stevens:

I would like to make a somewhat belated comment on one of the paragraphs
in your letter of September 21.

I think you should recognize that a good many small meat packing plants,
which are not federally inspected, find the cost of installing humane
slaughter equipment a great deterrent to its use. In /many cases, Iihese
packers who may slaughter only a few hundred hogs and/or cattle a week,

find.it very difficult to justify an expenditure of several thousand
dollars on which they can see no possibility of a return. In a good many
cases, these firms do not have capital to invest in this kind of equip-
ment and it might take them several years to accumulate it. In the mean-
time, of course, there might be other needs which they might consider

more pressing, either because of their competitive position or for some
other reason.

Setting aside al.l other considerations, I think you should realize that
the meat packing industry is not a rich one, that its margins are usually
small and that many firms Operate precariously on the edge of a sharp
incline. Many these firms, I am sure, would like to do what the
public considers desirable, but when a choice lies between meeting public
approval and continuance in business I'm afraid they would chose to try
and preserve their businesses.

Very truly yours,
THE NATIONAL PROVISIONER

What's the State of State Inspection?

By EDWARD R. SWEM and BETTY STEVENS

HEN the legislatures of 47 states convene in
W regular session next year, nearly all beginning

in January, at least a dozen of them will be
asked to enact new laws establishing state-paid manda-
tory meat inspection programs covering plants not op-
erating under federal inspection. In many more states,
even though substantive changes in existing inspection
programs may not be contemplated, lawmakers will be
urged to take a big step forward and appropriate ade-
quate funds to finance this essential service for the
protection of the consuming public.

When the inspection proposals are presented, budget—
conscious legislators will ask: “How much would it
cost?” “Why shouldn’t packers pay for the service?” “Is
inspection really needed?” “What state agency is best
fitted to administer the program?” “What do other
states do?”

THE NATIONAL PROVISIONER, which has reported those
questions from state capitals throughout the nation with
increasing frequency in the past several years, decided
in the twilight of the 1959 legislative sessions to go after
the big picture—what all the states do—so readers
would have a central source for comparison before the
next concerted drive. In a comprehensive 50-state sur—
vey undertaken last summer, the NP asked state ad-
ministrators not only for details on ante and post
mortem meat inspection programs but also about plant
licensing and sanitation programs, often the forerunners
of meat inspection. Then, throwing wide open the lid on
Pandora’s box, the magazine also asked some questions
about state label control programs and went fishing for
some Views on pre—emption.

In addition to officials responsible for administering
the various state meat laws, several—score intrastate
meat packers and sausage manufacturers were con—
sulted for their views on the state programs, and state
associations of packers, which have been leading advo—
cates of state—paid mandatory inspection, were asked
about their plans. The NP also interviewed authorities
in the fields of veterinary and human medicine, the
legal counsel of a national packing company and several
officials of the U. S. Department of Agriculture.

This first in a series of articles based on the survey

will be devoted to the most-often asked question:
What’s the state of state inspection?

INSPECTION IN 31 STATES: As shown in the table
on the following two pages, 31 states have meat inspec-
tion programs at the slaughter level (which may or
may not extend to processing or other activities). In 15
of the states, including the newest state of Hawaii, in-
spection is mandatory. The other 16 state programs are
voluntary, including one in the 49th state of Alaska and
the most recently authorized program now being or-
ganized in Mississippi under a law enacted this year.

The oldest reported state inspection law in. existence
is the 1915 Pennsylvania statute providing for a volun-
tary program; this program covered 58 plants in 1959,
with inspected packers paying the entire costs. The
next oldest, and apparently the most extensive pro-
gram, is that in California, which started out on a vol-
untary basis with one plant in 1917 and became manda—
tory in 1931. The California service has grown with
great strides, notes Dr. R. W. McFarland, chief of the
bureau of meat inspection in the State Department of
Agriculture. At the end of the 1959 calendar year, in-
spections were being conducted in 361 establishments
in 37 counties extending from the Oregon border to the
Mexican border. Of this number, 41 were solely slaugh-
tering establishments, 16 conducted both slaughtering
and processing, and 304 establishments engaged in meat
processing only. In addition, the bureau of meat inspec-
tion maintained supervision over 50 processing estab-
lishments operating under the state-approved munici-
pal program in San Francisco, the only California city
now conducting its own meat inspection service.

California’s program also is the most costly, with an
annual expenditure of nearly $900,000 for the state—paid
service, against a reported low budget (among states
paying anything) of $12,000 in Alaska. The first appro-
priation by the California legislature providing money
from the general fund for meat inspection was made in
1945; packers pay overtime costs for work in excess of
eight hours per day and on Saturdays, Sundays and
legal holidays (utilized to the extent of $68,987 in the
1957—58 fiscal year). ' 4

California is one of only six states in which the entire

1. Inspection is mandatory in California counties having population
of 28,000 or more. Only two small slaughterhouses were exempt last
year. The 50 processing plants operating under the state-approved
municipal program are in San Francisco, which is the only Califor-
nia city now conducting its own meat inspection service.

2. State of Colorado serves to coordinate and certify local inspection
systems. State has no inspection budget but local governments
may share costs with packers.

3. New Connecticut State Department of Consumer Protection, set up
according to statute enacted by 1959 legislature, has taken over
meat inspection program formerly under State Department of
Agriculture and other inspection and regulatory functions. Agency
is first of its kind in U. 5. Local governments supposedly pay
costs of meat inspection but may require reimbursement from
packers.

4. Florida inspection is mandatory except for firms slaughtering or
processing not more than 20 head of cattle nor 35 head of hogs
per week. Florida Livestock Board, now an independent state
agency, will become the division of animal industry, State De-
partment of Agriculture, on January 1, 1961, pursuant to 1959
legislation.

5. Georgia Department of Agriculture estimated that about 200 plants
would come under new meat inspection law but was making study
to determine actual number of plants, number of inspectors
needed and annual cost.

6. New mandatory meat inspection law went into effect in Illinois on
July 1, 1960. Legislature appropriated $750,000 to cover expense of
setting up new program and full inspection costs during first
year of operation. Program covers about 400 red meat plants and
250 poultry plants, including some operating under state-approved
municipal systems. Details about inspection force were not availa-
ble at time of NP survey.

7. While the state of Massachusetts pays only 15 per cent of inspection

costs, the division of food and drugs, Department of Public
Health, reported that towns pay the remaining 85 per cent.

8. The 1959 Montana legislature appropriated $70,000 to pay the full
costs of the program beginning in July, 1960.

9. Some inspections in Nevada are by local governments With state
supervision; inspectors usually are private veterinarians working
under state supervision.

10. Meat inspection became mandatory in New Jersey on July 0, 1959.
State will pay administrative costs only; $50,000 was appropriated
for 1959-60. Packers will pay costs of inspection.

11. State of New York pays 50 per cent of the inspection costs in
counties that have ioined the state program but nothing where
cities or towns have ioined without county-wide participation.
Balance of the costs, depending upon local agreement, is paid
by the county, the packer or shared by both. Local health dis-
tricts conduct the inspections.

12. North Dakota has limited inspection program carried out by in-
spectors approved by Livestock Sanitary Board.

13. Oklahoma inspection staff includes 27 lay inspectors who spend
full time on inspection and two veterinarians who spend part-
time on meat inspection.

14. South Carolina has a meat inspection law on the books but funds
have never been appropriated to put it into effect.

15. Tennessee pays administrative costs totaling $50,000, or about 25
per cent of overall costs; inspected plants pay balance.

16. Per head fee charged Utah slaughterers is: cattle, 50¢; veal, 40¢,
hogs, 30¢, and sheep, 20¢.

17. New comprehensive meat inspection law passed by 1959 Washington
legislature went into effect June 11, 1959.

18. New law passed by 1959 West Virginia legislature as step towaiu
meat inspection is concerned mainly with licensing and sanita-
tion; law permits commissioner of agriculture or agent to inspect
meat but does not require it.

 

cost of the program, except for overtime, is paid for by
the taxpayers as a whole; the others are Georgia, Illi—
nois, Montana, Rhode Island and Wyoming. The Geor-
gia and Illinois programs are among new ones author-
ized by the state legislatures in 1959. The Montana
legislature also for the first time last year, in recogni-
tion of the public health nature of meat inspection,
provided for 100 per cent state financing beginning in
mid-1960, largely due to efforts of the Montana Inde—
pendent Meat Packers Association. The Georgia Inde-
pendent Meat Packers Association also actively sup-
ported that state’s new law.

In 10 of the states—Connecticut, Indiana, Iowa, Kan-
sas, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas,
Washington and Mississippi—the state defrays none of
the expense of inspection. In those states, the packer
may pay the entire cost or the program may be financed
in whole or in part by the local government participat-
ing in a state-supervised program.

WASHINGTON HAS HOPE: The Washington State
Meat Packers Association and the State Department of
Agriculture, which jointly sponsored a new compre-
hensive meat inspection program passed by the legis-
lature last year, held out for 100 per cent state financing
during most of the 1959 session. When it became evi-

dent, however, that the legislature would not go along
with the plan, the sponsors, in order to save the inspec-
tion features of the bill, rewrote it to provide that
packers must pay any costs not covered by a state ap-
propriation. Since the legislature granted no appropri-
ation, packers now must pay the full cost, although they
hope that the lawmakers will come through with funds
in the 1961 session.

The Washington program is an indication of the way
a state agency and the industry can work hand-in-hand
for the improvement of the industry and the protection
of the public health. In addition to requiring meat in-
spection at slaughtering and processing plants, the 1959
law provided for the establishment of an advisory
board to make recommendations to assure wholesome-
ness of products and their preparation under sanitary
conditions. Doyle DeJong of DeJong Packing Co., Lin-
den, Wash., and Martin Rind of Milwaukee Sausage
Co., Seattle, were appointed to the new meat inspection
advisory board last August, DeJong representing the
Washington State Meat Packers Association and Rind
representing meat food product manufacturers.

In seven states—Alaska, Arizona, Florida, Hawaii,
Idaho, Oregon and Utah—the state pays 50 per cent or
more, but less than 100 per cent, of the cost of inspec-

 




 

 

tion. New York pays 50 per cent of the cost in counties
that have joined the voluntary state program but noth-
ing where cities and towns have joined without like
participation by the counties in which they are located.
Generally, states with voluntary systems pay little or
no part of the inspection cost. However, in not a few of
the states where inspection is mandatory, the packers
are required to pay various percentages of the expense.

THE “BABY SISTERS”: While Hawaii’s inspection
setup has been changed substantially in recent years,
the youngest state has one of the oldest programs.
George Akau, chief of the Bureau of Pure Food and
Drugs, Department of Health of Hawaii, points out:

“Hawaii has a long, progressive history in the field of
food regulations and health, going back to the creation
of the Board of Health on November 6, 1859, by King
Kamehameha of the Kingdom of Hawaii. As early as
1899, the Department of Health employed veterinary
surgeons and meat inspectors who carried on inspec-
tions at slaughterhouses of bullocks, calves, sheep and
hogs. Today this work is conducted by the Department
of Agriculture and Forestry of the state of Hawaii.”

Hawaii’s mandatory meat inspection program covers
52 slaughtering plants. The state pays approximately
70 per cent of the $150,000 annual cost of the program.

A unique inspected establishment in the next—to-
youngest sister state is a reindeer slaughtering plant on
Nunivak Island, operated by the Alaska Native Service,
Bureau of Indian Affairs, U. S. Department of Interior.
The plant is one of five covered by the voluntary in—
spection program administered by the Alaska Depart—
ment of Agriculture.

In the NP survey, the appropriate agency in each
state was asked the number of inspectors employed and
the number of establishments covered by inspection.
The reported inspector—to-plant ratio varied widely.
In several cases it was 1 inspector to 1 plant; in another,
1 to 3; and in others, 1 to 2.25, 1 to 1.4 and even 1.5 to
1. While these data should not be leaned on too heavily
for conclusions, it might be inferred that where one in-
spector is expected to cover more than one plant, ade-
quacy of inspection could be below desirable level.

However, the type of geographical unit covered by
the inspection program, the kind of operations (simple
slaughterer, integrated packer or sausage manufactur—
er), volume of products being handled and the require-
ments of the laws and regulations being enforced all
play a part in determining the need for inspection staff.

MONEY PROBLEMS: Some of the state and local
systems are so limited in funds that they are unable to
pay attractive salaries for full—time veterinarians. Un—
der such circumstances, local veterinarians with private
practices may be employed to work part time to cover
the full slaughtering operation and to supervise proc-
essing and sanitary measures throughout the plant.
Such inspection may not be continuous, but it may in
some instances be adequate. 'The reported inspection
expenditures per plant per year varied widely, from
some low figures in the neighborhood of $1,000 to some
highs of about $7,000.

Under inspection systems where the packer and/or
processor pays the entire cost, there may be some ques-
tion about the exact relationship of packer-inspector—
state agency. Some Pennsylvania companies, for exam-
ple, appear to like the state’s system, and particularly
its high standards for sausage products, but the NP also
was informed that the problem of “dual allegiance”
arises under the packer—paid program. One responsible
slaughterer and sausage processor operating under
Pennsylvania-approved city inspection reported that
examination of his plant and operations is highly oc-

casional and that analysis of the products of his Penn-
sylvania and out-of—state competitors consistently
shows that they do not comply with the state’s require-
ments. He also commented on the frustrating circum-
stance that his plant cannot sell products to Penrisy‘lea-
nia institutions because they do not carry federal
certification. -

In the survey of packers operating under state meat
inspection, figures were obtained from a nunilnsr of
firms on their weekly tonnage and the number of hours
of inspection. While there were extremes in the .i'tzyzxord
of pounds turned out per inspection hour, there .. a
number of instances where cattle and hogs were ng
slaughtered, and sausage and cured meats pi'odutswréf, in
which pounds per inspection hour fell in ﬁle ram-52:2 of
4,500 to 6,000.

In some states that have the legal basis for ésggast
some measure of meat inspection (other than ‘éteir
general food laws) but lack the money and licz‘aery
to carry out a program, authority may be deiega to
cities and counties to carry on inspection. Thra- state
may “approve” such programs, in some cases winking
at least nominal compliance with plant sanirtzeafiicm and

other standards. Theoretically, the products of? ap-
proved city- or county—inspected plants are acceptable
throughout the state. Practically, however, ggiaclazeasz of
Colorado, New York, Texas and other areas 3":.::ve
found varying degrees of difficulty in expmting .11
products to other localities in their states. 1.311 at? lea-a'éort

NEW ENGLAND’S “DEFICIENCY”: The la of
meat inspection in one important section of the C‘ev
was summarized by Gilman K. Crowell, chief of time: 3.1»-
reau of food and chemistry, New Hampshire State tinge-m

partment of Health, at the 1959 conference of e
Association of Food and Drug Officials of the. l.§.s"2§3§.:;;x:l
States. He told the group:

“A meat inspection program such as is carried. 3 at

the federal level, i.e., involving ante and post n::.s'srts:s‘n
inspection, does not exist at the state level in New {23"
land. It is felt that this deficiency may be the 16m.i cf
the expense of such a program, as well as an attituiiis‘x sf
complacency on the part of many who feel that the asst.-
ume of meat moving in intrastate commerce is net of
sufficient size to warrant a full-fledged inspection sys—
tem. In our rural areas, much of the slaughtering is of
the custom type performed for individual families.
However, since the shortages of federally inspected
meat that developed during the war, and the increase in
prices, the intrastate movement has grown steadily.
“There is a trend at the state level toward a more
complete inspection program. This is being demanded
by low-income consumers as well as the legitimate in-
trastate processors. Such a program, the state regula—
tory official realizes, is expensive and demands trained
personnel. In many of the smaller states, such trained
Personnel is not available. Perhaps the answer lies in
the present Massachusetts law under which each city
and town submits annually to the State Department of
Public Health the names of qualified inspectors; in
most instances these inspectors are lay workers and not
veterinarians. The qualifications of each are reviewed.
All local slaughterhouses are licensed by the city 91'
town health departments. There are qualified veterl-
nary inspectors who are employed by the Massachu—
setts health department to review periodically and




supervise the work of the local inspectors, as well as
review the sanitary conditions in the slaughterhouses.

“Many of our New England cities have their meat
inspectors, and cities so staffed refuse the entrance of
uninspected meat. While such a program appears effec—
tive to the consumer, it is limited and possesses many
of the pitfalls of which regulatory officials are well
aware.”

BLURRY, INDEED: Any readers who are getting
the impression that the state meat inspection picture is
a very confused one are 100 per cent correct.

The. Agricultural Marketing Service of the U. S. De—
partment of Agriculture has the responsibility in the
extension of federal meat grading to non-federally in—
spected plants of determining whether the meat it
grades is slaughtered and processed under an adequate
meat inspection system. Here’s what David M. Pettus,
director of the AMS Livestock Division, told the NP
in this connection:

“A number of the states have no state meat inspec-

tion programs of any kind, but that does not mean that
there. are no good meat inspection systems available to
meat establishments within the state. Many smaller
political units, such as cities, counties and municipali—
ties, have inspection systems that are available to their
local packers and processors. Some of these are good
inspection systems, backed up by good laws and regu-
lations, with adequate funds and personnel to carry out
a successful program. I believe that the state of Ohio,
for example, is one that has no state meat inspection
program, but its cities, such as Cincinnati, Toledo,
Cleveland, Akron and Columbus, have satisfactory in—
spection systems.”
, ASomewhat different analysis is offered by an Ohio
meat-packer: “The Ohio situation,” says he, “is highly
complicated. Our Ohio Association of Meat Packers is
in favor of a uniform state meat inspection law, for the
present system is not only unfair but the type of in—
spection ranges from practically nothing to very strict
regulation, depending upon the locality.

“The responsibility for administering the Ohio law is
split between the Health Department and the Depart-
ment of Agriculture. The Health Department is respon—
sible for post mortem and sanitation inspection, and the
Department of Agriculture has set up regulations con-
trolling the manufacture and composition of various
sausage and manufactured items. Naturally, under a
system of this type, there is little cooperation between
the two departments. Furthermore, the fact that the
Health Department will recognize local inspection re-
sults in wide differences in the type of inspection re-
quired in the state.”

The differences in views about quality of an inspec-
tion service are sometimes dramatic.

In Illinois, the legislature last year passed the first
state meat inspection law, which looks pretty good and
will be supported with public funds, but past local pro-
grams for safeguarding the wholesomeness of the meat
supply in the state have been spotty and often weak.
The city of Chicago has had for many years a tax-
supported program which, according to one packer who
operates under it, is equivalent to the USDA Meat In-
spection Division system in the quality of on-the-spot
inspection and the consistency with which the city’s
MID-borrowed regulations are enforced with respect
to sanitation, ingredients, labeling, etc.

An authority in the field of veterinary medicine, who
has worked on the packer level for many years, con-
siders the Chicago program almost a vacuum and de-
signed to foster the operations of local operators who
clean up the yards.

The new mandatory Illinois program provides for
state recognition of municipal inspection systems “at
least equal to state inspection,” and approved municipal
ordinances are to “prevail in lieu of the state” system.

In the NP survey of state-inspected houses, a num—
ber of differences were reported between the state and
federal inspection programs, even where some of the
former are supposed to follow MID requirements. The
magazine asked whether federal requirements were
being met in the following areas: Plant design, am.
and p.m. inspection, handling of inedible material, la-
beling, ingredients and standards of identity. Apparent-
ly, according to the packer informants, only in connec-
tion with am. and p.m. inspection is there any
consistency in enforcement of standards similar to those
observed in federally inspected establishments.

FOUNDATION STONES NEEDED: What kind of
inspection should there be at the state level? The NP
study points conclusively to the fact that from the
standpoint of realism, a state can’t have a “leetle bit of
inspection” any more than a woman can be a “leetle bit
pregnant.” Meat inspection must be complete and con-
tinuous. It should start at the ante mortem and post
mortem level. Having heard the argument that some
animal diseases transmissible to humans have been al-
most eliminated, and that watchfulness might be re-
laxed in this area, the magazine put this question up to
two authorities in human and veterinary medicine.

Dr. Thomas G. Hull, secretary of the council on sci-
entific assembly of the American Medical Association
and author of the text, “Diseases Transmitted from
Animals to Man,” reacted with considerable heat.

“Let’s not forget,” said he, “that we have succeeded
in bringing some of these problems under control be-
cause we have had meat inspection and other programs,
but that. diseases transmissible through consumption
and contact still exist and could again become important
if we relax our controls.”

Dr. J. W. Cunkelman, chief veterinarian of Swift &
Company, a leader in Livestock Conservation, Inc., and
an active participant in the work of the American Vet-
erinary Medical Association, was equally emphatic in
rejecting the idea of relaxing slaughter level controls.

As other foundation stones of a good state meat in-
spection system: The program must be mandatory. If
authority to carry it out is passed along to cities and
counties, the standards of application must be definite
and equivalent to those of the state, and there must be
machinery to insure compliance by the lesser political
units. The program should be paid for by all the citi-
zens, and not by the packers and processors involved,
in recognition that it is designed for the protection of
the public and that objective and equitable administra—
tion cannot otherwise be expected.

The state’s meat inspection law should be specific,
and the area of its coverage should be clearly defined.
Insofar as possible, it should be modeled after the fed-
eral meat inspection law. Likewise, regulations issued
under the act should be detailed and definite, and inso-
far as possible, uniform with those of the MID. Detailed
regulations may be exasperating when they are admin-
istered by the over—officious, but in that they represent
“government by law” rather than by man, the processor
should be able to expect consistency in their application
to himself and his competitors.

Appropriations by the state legislature for meat in-
spection should be adequate for maintenance of the
program from the slaughter level onward and for its
administration by competent officials. A dedicated bu-
reaucracy (using the word in its very best sense) is
needed to do the job.

 

 




 

 

 

Where State Meat Inspection Is .

like a second home to leaders

of the Kansas Independent
Meat Packers Association. Since
KIMPA was organized in May, 1956,
the association has been dedicated
to the goal of mandatory state-paid
meat inspection to replace the in—
effectual voluntary packer—financed
program that now passes for meat
inspection in the state.

The neophytes who began the pil-
grimage to the state capital four
years ago to enlist the support of
legislators and officials of the State
Board of Health will return to Tope-
ka next year seasoned in the trials
and tribulations of lawmaking but
more resolute than ever that Kansas
consumers shall be protected from
unwholesome meat.

While the Board of Health, which
administers the present voluntary
program, has approved KIMPA-
sponsored mandatory proposals in
the past and endorsed them before
various legislative committees, the
state association this year for the
first time has the agency’s assur-
ance that it not only will seek en—
actment of a mandatory law in 1961
but also will present to the 1961
legislature a $225,000 budget re—
quest for state—wide, state-paid
meat inspection.

“This would mean that the one-
third of all meat now consumed by
Kansas families with no inspection
would be inspected,” KIMPA presi-
dent Carl L. Fanestil of Fanestil
Packing Co., Emporia, points out.

Adds Emporia attorney James W.
Putnam, who has served as counsel-
secretary of KIMPA since its in-
ception: “Each time any state takes
a step forward toward mandatory,
state-paid meat inspection, it helps
everyone else working for the same
cause.”

The NP’s survey of packer lead—
ers and administrative agencies in
the 50 states indicates that the legis—
latures of at least a dozen states
will be asked to enact new manda—
tory meat inspection laws in 1961,
while in many other states law-
makers will be asked to appropriate
adequate funds to finance existing
programs.

INSPECTION BILLS LIKELY:
In addition to Kansas, states in
which mandatory legislation is
likely to be introduced include New
York, Michigan, Oklahoma, North
Carolina, South Carolina, Texas,
Colorado, Ohio, Maine, West Virgi-
nia and Minnesota.

Any action in New Jersey next
year may hinge on the fate of a

T OPEKA is beginning to feel

bill (A—55) now pending in the
Assembly, which is in recess until
September 12. The bill, referred to
the Assembly’s health and welfare
committee headed by Mrs. Made—
line A. Williams of East Orange,
would broaden the State Depart-
ment of Health’s inspection authori-
ty and support New Jersey’s year-
old mandatory meat and poultry
inspection program with state funds.
Packers now pay the full costs of
inspection. A—55 would provide
$350,000 for the first year of the
state-paid program.

In Oklahoma, a subcommittee of
the State Legislative Council’s agri-
culture committee has just agreed
after several months of study to
recommend a compulsory meat in-
spection program phased over a two-
or three-year period. The present
voluntary program administered by
the State Department of Agriculture
covers only 27 of the 111 slaughter—
ing plants in Oklahoma. Under the
compulsory plan, the state would
finance the entire program at a cost
of $285,000 to $500,000 a year. The
state now pays $100,000 annually, or
about 80 per cent of the cost, with
packers paying the balance.

The subcommittee study was un-
dertaken at the request of the Okla-
homa Independent Meat Packers As-
sociation. State Senator Byron
Dacus of Gotebo, chairman of the
subcommittee, said that the group
is making its recommendation “sole-
ly in the interest of public health.”
The state association also notes that
the present system places state-in-
spected packers at a disadvantage
since out—of—state packers shipping
into Oklahoma are inspected by the
U. S. Department of Agriculture at
no expense to them other than the
few cents per year the federal pro-
gram costs every taxpayer.

The North Carolina Meat Packers
Association voted unanimously at
that group’s last annual meeting to
continue its efforts to gain a uniform
state meat inspection law supported
by public finances. The board of
directors was authorized to arrange
for legal counsel and to make an ad—
ditional assessment on the members
to cover the expenses of the cam—
paign for state-paid inspection.
Charles McEnally of New Bern Pro-
vision Co., New Bern, N. C., is pres—
ident of the association.

Under the present voluntary law
enacted by the North Carolina legis-
lature in 1957, the 18 state—inspected
plants must pay the full cost of about
$82,500 a year.

Strong support for a compul—

 

sory program has come frets; the
North Carolina State Board of Agri-
culture. The board several ivzz-siiths
ago approved a budget recite—vast of
nearly $300,000 for each year the
1961—63 biennium to carry eat trian-
datory meat and poultry inept-e tion,
announcing that it will seek a;2':3;»2>li.11g
legislation in the 1961 sesame. .

submitted to the state Adtissory
Budget Commission. Etpi'rta'timgég out
that only three North Carelina lileat
packing plants are federally in—
spected, Commissioner Bally-aiine
explained: “This means "that a ge

volume of the meats and meat {hiﬁi'fd-
ucts sold in the state is net in-

He emphasized: “The censizzzzters

would afford.” The brief else >25;—

serted that many small pig-mite; in

In announcing plans to intrresﬁ2.5%:
legislation that would set up a sl~
wide meat inspection system in
South Carolina, J. Bate Harvey, state
representative from York Ceumy,
declared that the state does not even
have a law to prevent the sale ef
meat from an animal that has died
of disease. Other sources indicate
that the state has a meat inspection
law on the books but funds have
never been appropriated for it.

Officials of the New York State
Meat Packers Association have
spent about as much time in Albany
as KIMPA leaders have in Topeka
in their efforts to bring order out of
the chaos created by the entangled
New York regulatory setup.

Licensing jurisdiction over physi-
cal structure and equipment of
plants in New York is vested in the
State Department of Agriculture and
Markets. A permissive meat inspec—
tion program in effect since Decem-
ber, 1957, is administered by the
State Health Department, but local
health districts conduct the inspec-
tions. The state pays 50 per cent of
the inspection costs in counties that
have joined the state program, and
the other 50 per cent is paid, de-
pending upon local agreement, by

 




the packer or the county or shared
by both. Cities or towns in counties
that have not joined the state pro-
gram may apply to come under the
program but in that case the in-
spected. packer must pay 100 per
cent of. the cost.

rI’hat overlapping jurisdictional
maze spurred the birth of the New
Yark State Meat Packers Associa-
tétm at the end of 1957, with the goal
of compulsory, uniform, state-wide
inspection under a single agency and
tinamrr—éd wholly by the state.

legal entanglement was
irened in this year’s legislative
session by humane slaughter and
meat tagging bills, the latter being a
scare measure aimed at livestock fed
{:I'nemieal additives, (neither bill

peaied directly to Gov. Nelson

"those paying nothing at present

lTYSMPA president Jerome B.
Harrison of C. A. Durr Packing Co.,
Imu, Utica, counsel J. L. Deutsch
and executive secretary Abe Kra-
mer, both of Woodstock, and other
association leaders point out that the
consolidation of inspection functions
under a single agency and uni-
formity of procedures would reduce
inspection costs greatly and that to-
tal cost payment by the state would
result in far greater protection for
both public and packer. In confer-
ences with the governor’s committee
and with legislators, it has been es-
timated that the entire cost of in-
spection would total about $2,000,-
000, according to Harrison, who de—
scribes this figure as “quite a low
public price to pay for so important
a public health measure as meat
inspection.”

WHICH AGENCY? The question
of which state agency should ad-
minister a meat inspection program
poses a real problem in many states.
In at least three states that now
have no meat inspection systems—
Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin—the
health and agricultural agencies have
sponsored separate bills in the past
with health officials urging packer-

paid voluntary programs under their
jurisdictions and agriculture officials
seeking state-financed mandatory
inspection to tie in with their animal
disease control work. The inter-
agency conflict over regulatory au-
thority clouded the arguments for
meat inspection in these states, and
the public health issue got lost.

Something similar may happen in
Minnesota, where the State Commis-
sion on Agricultural Problems has
been considering a meat inspection
bill for recommendation to the 1961
state legislature.

Explains Thomas Johnson, execu—
tive secretary of the commission:
“Members of the commission are
generally convinced of the need for
a meat inspection law, as indeed they
have been for some time. However,
there remains to be solved the prob—
lem of whether the law should be
administered by the Department of
Agriculture, Dairy and Food or the
Livestock Sanitary Board. Until this
question is resolved, we will probab-
ly not have a meat inspection law
in Minnesota.”

In the 31 states that now have
meat inspection systems, THE NA-
TIONAL PROVISIONER learned, 17
(soon to be 18) of the inspection
programs are administered by the
state agriculture department, nine by
the health agency, four (dropping to
three) by a livestock sanitary board
and one by an entirely new breed
of administrative agency—a depart-
ment of consumer protection. The
supervisory setup will change in
Florida on January 1, 1961, when
the Florida Livestock Board, now
an independent state agency in
charge of the mandatory inspection
program, will become the division of

. animal industry within the State De-

partment of Agriculture.

The trend, which has packer sup-
port, is for the agricultural agency
to be designated as the meat inspec-
tion body in the state, as it is on
the federal level. Not only does this
enable the farm agency to detect
diseases at the point of slaughter
and trace the animals back to the
source for more effective disease
control, but state agricultural offi-
cials also have better lines of com—
munication with the USDA to keep
them abreast of developments at the
federal level, the Virginia Meat
Packers Association pointed out in
1958 when it was instrumental in
getting that state’s voluntary meat
inspection program shifted from the
health agency to the Department of
Agriculture.

State agricultural officials also
seem to see more readily that it is
both unwise and unfair for packers
to have to pay inspection costs.

NEW BREED: Whether the new
State Department of Consumer Pro-
tection in Connecticut will “catch
on” elsewhere remains to be seen. A
proposal to establish a consumers’
department at the federal level this
year was opposed at Congressional
hearings by spokesmen from various
federal agencies who emphasized the
wide variety of existing regulatory
programs now carried out to protect
the consumer.

The new Connecticut department
was established under legislation
passed in 1959 to consolidate the in-
spection and regulatory duties of
several state agencies, including the
Department of Agriculture, Food and
Drug Commission, Pharmacy Com—
mission and Athletic Commission.
Harold Clark, formerly with the in—
dependent Connecticut Food and
Drug Commission, heads the food
division of new State Department of
Consumer Protection.

Procedurewise, this could be a step
in the right direction for Connecti-
cut. Under the former setup, the
State Department of Agriculture was
in charge of the meat inspection
program, which is voluntary at the
state level. The Food and Drug
Commission had authority over meat
processing plants. Inspection of
kosher meat was conducted by the
State Police Department since the
kosher meat statute was a general
law not assigned to any agency and
only the State Police Department
can enforce general laws.

However, the new legislation set-
ting up the State Department of Con-
sumer Protection made no change in
the substantive laws, which fall short
of standards recommended for real
protection. Ante and post mortem
inspection at slaughtering plants will
continue to be carried out by in-
spectors recommended by local
health districts and licensed by the
state. Presumably, the local govern—
ment pays the costs of inspection,
but some require reimbursement
from the inspected packers. Con-
necticut has about 50 red meat
slaughterhouses and 60 meat proc—
essing plants. Supervision of meat
processing apparently will continue
to be intermittent.

In a less sweeping realignment, the
Massachusetts division of food and
drugs in the State Department of
Public Health, which administers
mandatory meat inspection carried
out by local authorities, was trans-
ferred last August to a new bureau
of consumer product protection
within the same department. State
Health Commissioner Alfred L. Fre-
chette said the shift was made “to
provide greater health protection for
Massachusetts consumers.”

 

 




MORE PLANS: Jealousy in the
administration of meat inspection
isn’t confined to the state level. A
Texas packer now operating under
local inspection informed the NP
that he would like to go under the
state program. The city inspector
who supervises his plant in a per-
functory fashion, however, “froze”
at the suggestion of state inspection
so the packer feels it will be health-
ier for him to stay under the local
program unless state inspection be—
comes mandatory. A recent crack-
down on substandard packers sell—
ing uninspected and falsely repre-
sented meat in several Colorado
counties, as well as legitimate pack-
er discontent over county trade bar-
riers, point to compulsory state in-
spection proposals in Colorado.

State packers organizations work-
ing for mandatory state—paid inspec—
tion also include the young Michigan
Meat Packers Association, headed
by Charles Watson of Vogt Packing
Co., Flint; the West Virginia Meat
Packers Association, which succeed-
ed in getting a new plant licensing
program passed in 1959 as a step to—
ward inspection; the Ohio Associa—
tion of Meat Packers, and the Maine
Independent Meat Packers Associa-
tion. The Washington State Meat
Packers Association, which got the
[mandatory inspection program it
wanted passed in 1959, but no appro—
priation, now is among groups work-
ing industriously to get favorable
action on adequate state financing.

Most of the packer groups have
made considerable progress in get-

ting across the need for meat in"
spection in their states. The KIMPA
proposal, for example, now has the
support of about two dozen ether
Kansas organizations, including use..—
jor health, veterinary, civic end
women’s groups. Latest to 8111731.).11‘59

How One State ls Organizing Inspect

W HILE it takes only a simple majority in both

houses of the legislature to enact a state meat

inspection law, getting that vote is far from
simple, as proponents across the nation will attest. Nor
can an effective state meat inspection program be
launched in a day. .

Stillman J. Stanard, who has served as director of the
Illinois Department of Agriculture since 1953 and also
held that post from 1925 to 1929, sponsored the first
state meat inspection bill introduced in Springfield in
1927. Leader of the successful campaign to eradicate
tuberculosis among cattle in the state, Stanard was
convinced of the need to protect Illinois citizens from all
unwholesome meat. Although the 1927 legislature didn’t
see things his way, and the bill failed to pass, Stanard
remained convinced during nearly a quarter of a cen—
tury in the attorney general’s office that the state was
falling down in a Vital public health duty.

Back on the job as state agriculture chief in 1953, he
tried again without success to get the legislature to pass
a mandatory meat inspection bill. In 1957, he supported
a poultry inspection bill passed by the House but killed
in the Senate.

In 1959—32 years after Stanard’s first try—a manda—
tory meat and poultry inspection bill written by the
agriculture director was passed overwhelmingly by
both houses, with an effective date of July 1, 1960. The
measure, providing an appropriation of $750,000 to set
up the state inspection program and pay the full costs
during. the first year of operation, also had the support
of Gov. William G. Stratton and the Illinois Veterinary
Medical Association. (While state associations of meat
packers have been leaders elsewhere in campaigns for
mandatory, state-paid inspection in recent years, Illinois
has no such state organization.)

In urging passage of the bill at legislative hearings,
Stanard reported that his department had received a
number of complaints about animals dying of disease
and then being processed for sale to the public. He
pointed out that meat inspection is a protective health
service and should be financed with public funds, not-
ing that the per capita cost of assuring Illinois residents
good meat and poultry on their tables would be only
about 10¢ a year. Stanard estimated at that time that
more than 650 meat and poultry plants in the state were
operating without benefit of inspection. '

 

“Why did the 1959 bill pass and not the others?” the
NP asked Stanard recently in an attempt to get a mr
formula to pass along to other states.

In an answer telling the fruits of persistence rather
than occult powers, the farm chief replied: “There was
no opposition.” ‘

ORGANIZATION: With the inspection law on
books, Stanard’s first job was to find an experiena‘tna
veterinarian to head his department’s new divisitm
meat and poultry inspection, get regulations written
amplify the new law and obtain a record of all slaugéan
tering and processing plants under his jurisdiction
licensing provision of the inspection act.

Under “Rules and Regulations,” the Illinois sta’tzsiux
provides: “The director shall make such rules
regulations, including suspension of licenses, as may ier:
necessary for the effective administration of this <
Such rules and regulations shall conform as noes:
possible but need not be limited by rules and TEEUQEE‘:
tions established by the United States Department
Agriculture governing meat and poultry inspection.”

Stanard also found his man at the USDA.

Dr. Fred C. Mau, retiring from the USDA after nearly
42 years in meat inspection and animal disease eradica-
tion work, was recommended by the Illinois Veterinary
Medical Association and agreed toiaccept the post of
superintendent of the division of meat and poultry
inspection in his native state.

A meat inspection career was a “natural” for Fred
Mau. Both his grandfathers were pioneer packers in
Chicago and his father, Gustave Charles Mau, was
associated with the old Western Packing and Provision
Co. in that city. Upon graduation from McKillip Veteri—
nary College in 1918 at the age of 19, he entered the
federal meat inspection service under the former Bu—
reau of Animal Industry of the USDA. Dr. Mau acquired
a wide and varied experience in the regulatory veter—
inary field in the ensuing years. For 14 years, he did
supervisory meat inspection work in Chicago. During
World War II, he served in St. Joseph, Mo. At the out—
break of foot—and—mouth disease in Mexico in 1946, he
was one of the first five veterinarians sent down there
to set up controls so the disease wouldn’t enter the
United States. When the serious swine disease vesicular
exanthema broke out in this country in 1952, Dr. Mau
formulated regulations that finally brought VE under

about 80 per cent of which are red meat establishments.

In the 'meantime, the meat inspection superintendent
has been recruiting a force of veterinary and lay
inspectors, arranging for their training and surveying
the existing local meat inspection picture in Illinois. The
state law provides for recognition of municipal inspec-
tion systems provided the inspection ordinances estab-
lish systems “at least equal to state inspection” and the
municipal programs are operated in accordance with
the approved ordinances (as determined by investiga—
tions to be made by the state inspection division “not
less than twice each year”).

Starting salaries offered by the state for the inspec-
tion force are $535 a month for veterinarians and $335
a month for lay inspectors. Three civil service examin—
ations, consisting of an aptitude test plus some practical
questions, have been given by the state so far in
Chicago, Springfield and Herrin, Ill. Of the 154 men
Who took the lay inspectors’ exam, 123 passed. Dr. Mau
has been screening this group further through oral
interviews. He also has applications on file from about
25 veterinarians, including some USDA Meat Inspection
Division retirees.

The superintendent wants to have a ratio, in general,

of about one veterinarian to every five lay inspectors.
Where the slaughtering operation is part-time or sea—
sonal, he expects to have to employ private veterinari—
ans during the designated operating periods because of
the nationwide shortage of vets. “When we operate,
each inspected plant will be fully-manned with inspec—
tion staff,” Dr. Mau told the PROVISIONER.

TRAINING MADE EASIER: The problem of training
lay inspectors has been simplified with the offer of the
federal force to train the state men in official MID
establishments. Dr. Mau says he also needs permission
of the federally inspected plant owners for the entry of
his trainees, but he has received a “warm welcome” in
Chicago and anticipates no difficulty. The Illinois in-
spection chief also has received an open house invitation
to attend any MID conference. “We can help the MID
people, and they can help us,” he said.

The state survey of local meat inspection systems
turned up very few although some have been instituted
so local packers could get federal grading. Vermilion
County (Danville) has the only county inspection ordi-
nance. Two or three cities, including Peoria and East
St. Louis, have ordinances on paper, Dr. Mau said.
Rockford and Chicago have pretty good inspection sys—
tems, he observed. He expects Chicago and possibly
Rockford to continue municipal inspection. Peoria al—
ready has asked the state to come in.

“We will do our utmost to get inspection throughout
the state as quickly as possible, but we are not going to
be haphazard,” Dr. Mau emphasized. “It took seven
years for federal inspection to get on the road.”

The state inspection program will be instituted in
October in larger Illinois plants, probably about 20
establishments to start. It may take four or five years
for the state program to get fully underway, Dr. Mau
estimated. Timing depends a lot on the response from
veterinarians.

MID PATTERN: The initial Illinois regulations, re—
cently off the press, follow federal regulations closely
in regard to plant facilities, ante and post mortem
inspection, and preparation, handling and branding of
products.

“We’re going to be copycats, follow MID rules and
work carefully with the federal folks,” the state super-
intendent explained.

State label control regulations covering meat products
have not yet been spelled out. In an eight—paragraph
definition, however, the statute says, in part, that a
product is “unwholesome” . . . “If any substance has

been substituted wholly or in part therefor.” . . . “If
damage or inferior quality has been concealed in any
manner.” . . . “If any poisonous or deleterious sub-

stance is contained, unless such substance is permitted
in production or unavoidable under processing practices
as may be determined by rules and regulations here-
under prescribed by the Department of Agriculture or
other provisions of law limiting or tolerating the quan-
tity of such added substance on or in such product:
provided, however, that any quantity of such [added
substance which exceeds the limit so established shall
be considered as adulteration and as unwholesome.”

Dr. Mau indicated that the state will be “a little
tighter” than the MID on the domestic meat label
attached to shipping containers. The state inspection
stamp will require the inspector’s initials and the date
of labeling. “We’re going to clamp down on a lot of
illicit meat now sneaked into Chicago after dark from
outlying areas that have no inspection,” the state in-
spection chief commented.

While the Department of Agriculture will have to go
back to the legislature for another biennial appropria-
tion in 1961, Dr. Mau believes adequate funds again

 

 

 

 




 

 

will be forthcoming. “The state should pay the costs of
meat and poultry inspection in fairness to everyone
concerned,” he pointed out.

“Illinois is the greatest agricultural state,” the meat

Licensing, Sanitary

HEN Richard W. Shaw of John Wenzel Co.,

Wheeling, W. Va., appeared before the agricul-

ture committee of the state Senate in Charles—
ton early last year, representing the West Virginia
Meat Packers Association, he urged the lawmakers to
concur in a House—passed bill and impose another set
of controls on slaughtering and meat processing plants
in the state.

Shaw was speaking in behalf of mandatory plant
licensing, Step 2 in the carefully-laid plans of the packer
association and the State Department of Agriculture to
get mandatory meat inspection in West Virginia. Step
1—the promulgation of minimum sanitary standards,
backed up by plant inspections—was authorized by the
1957 legislature and became effective in January, 1958.
Shaw also asked the senators to approve the new bill’s
provisions expanding the plant sanitation inspection
program to cover such items as processing and handling
facilities, wrapping, transportation and refrigeration.

The House—passed measure had struck a snag on the
Senate floor, sending it back to the agriculture com-
mittee, when some members of the upper body pro-
tested that it was not strong enough and should be
amended to provide for immediate establishment of
mandatory ante and post mortem inspection.

After Shaw and Department of Agriculture spokes-
men explained that they are all for mandatory inspec—
tion, but that an adequate inspection program might cost
$500,000 to $600,000 a year, the lawmakers “saw the
light” and agreed that the most practical way to advance
the protective health program was a step at a time.

The new West Virginia law requires slaughterhouses
killing more than 100 head of livestock a year to obtain
a $25 license for each fiscal year, beginning July 1, 1959.
A $25 license also must be obtained by each “packing
plant,” defined as an establishment, with or without
slaughtering facilities, Where livestock carcasses or
edible products derived therefrom are cured, salted,
processed, packaged or otherwise prepared for sale as
food intended for human consumption. Integrated
packinghouses must obtain both licenses. More than 150
plants were expected to come under the law.

“We realize that our basic law fails to provide all
that is to be desired,” T. C. Green, D.V.M., director of
the animal disease control division, State Department of
Agriculture, wrote THE NATIONAL PROVISIONER in re—
turning a questionnaire sent out as part of the maga-
zine’s 50-state survey on state meat laws. “However,”
Dr. Green explained, “it is a start in the right direction
and we are confident that its practical application will
elevate the West Virginia meat industry and restore
the confidence of the consumers.”

LICENSING PICTURE: As listed in the table on
pages 16 and 17, the NP survey shows that 36 of the
states definitely have laws calling for the registration
and/or licensing of firms in the slaughtering and/or
meat processing business. Eleven of the states do not
have such requirements although one of these, Florida,
requires the plant to sign a memorandum of agreement.
Information was not forthcoming from the remaining
three states.

Newest of the plant licensing statutes is that enacted
by the Mississippi legislature last April. The new Missis-

and poultry division superintendent asserted, in viewing
the job ahead. “If it’s the last thing I do as a veterinari-
an, I want to see a state inspection syn??? in Illinois
comparable to none.”

1. The Arizona slaughter plant license fee is $5 for a 45-head maximum
annual kill, $15 for a 150-head limit and $80 for unlimited kill.

2. California licenses cattle slaughtering plants only. The annual fee is
$20 for a kill of less than 51 head per month, $50 for 51-100 head
and $100 for 101 head and over.

3. While the Delaware State Board of Health is in charge of sanitation
inspection, the inspections are made by county sanitarians as part
of their general program.

4. Florida does not license slaughtering and processing plants, but they
must sign a memorandum of agreement. The Florida Livestock
Board will become part of the Department of Agriculture on
January 1, 1961.

5. Georgia’s mandatory meat inspection program was not underway
when frequency of sanitation inspection was given.

6. Plant licensing and sanitation inspection will be part of new man-
datory Illinois meat and poultry inspection program now being
organized (see last week’s NP). About 800 meat and poultry plants
are expected to come under program.

7. The Iowa figure includes slaughterers and processors.

8. The Kansas license fee is $5 for slaughterers and $10 for integrated
packing plants.

9. The 75 Maryland sanitarians do all types of environmental sanitation
work.

10. Massachusetts requires registration of meat food product manufac-
turers but does not licenze them.

Licensing is required of establishments under the Michigan Com-
minuted Meat Law. Manufacturers selling through usual trade
channels or through five of their own outlets, to the ultimate
consumer, must obtain the $100 license.

12. A new Mississippi law enacted this year provides for mandatory ti-
censing and sanitation inspection programs covering slaughterers
and processors. The State Department of Agriculture is the act-
ministrative agency. Sanitation inspections formerly were. con—
ducted by county health departments under the supervision m”- the
State Board of Health.

13. The Nebraska sanitation inspection staff does other work also.

14. The Nevada staff is made up of general sanitarians who incidentally
inspect meat plants.

15. The New Hampshire staff does all types of sanitary work.

16. North Dakota licensing is limited to slaughtering plants doing Enter-
city shipment. -

17. The Pennsylvania figure includes slaughtering and processing wants.

18. The Tennessee figure includes slaughtering and processing giants.

19. While some states do not license federally inspected plants, the. Utah
figure includes seven MID plants. The license fee is $5 for siaugh-
terers killing fewer than 10 head a month, $20 for 10-49 heat: and
$75 for 50 or more head.

20. The five Vermont district sanitarians who inspect meat plants also
inspect about 3,000 other food processing, lodging and eating es-
tablishments.

21. The Wisconsin license fee for meat food product manufacturers is
ba'ed on gross sales and ranges from $1 to $25 a year. The State
Board of Health is in charge of sanitation inspections in slaughter
plants while processing plants are under the State Department of
Agriculture. The 15 state sanitation inspectors also have other food
assignments.

22. The 37 licensed Wyoming slaughtering plants include rabbit and
poultry, as well as red meat, establishments.

 

who continue violations.

A number of states, like Mississippi, do not require
a license of federally inspected plants. Others do not
make this distinction. The Utah Department of Agricul-
ture noted that the 41 slaughtering plants licensed in
that state include seven MID-inspected establishments.

A 1959 amendment to the Tennessee meat inspection
law-requires all plants slaughtering or processing meat
to have a plant number and show the number and
Tennessee Department of Agriculture symbol on the
meat or on the label. “This requirement applies to proc-
essing plants using USDA inspected meats, as well as
those using Tennessee inspected meat,” emphasized
Eugene H. Holeman, director and state chemist,
division of foods, drugs and dairies, Tennessee Depart-
ment of Agriculture.

The annual license fees reported by the various states
run anywhere from zero to $100. A few are based on
the slaughter rate. Louisiana charges nothing for slaugh-
tering plant licenses, but the fee for a processing plant
license is $2.50 per product up to a maximum of $10.
The Wisconsin slaughtering plant license costs a flat
$20, while the processing plant license, ranging from $1
to $25,,.is based on gross sales. Michigan, which does not
license slaughtering plants, requires a $25, $50 or $100
license of manufacturers under the state’s Comminuted
Meat Law. The smallest Michigan fee is for plants
manufacturing and selling at retail at only one place in
the state. A manufacturer making distribution through
more than one but not exceeding five of his own estab-
lishments, for sale to the ultimate consumer, must ob-
tain the $50 license. The $100 license is required of a

manufacturer making distribution through the usual
trade channels for resale or making distribution through
more than five of his own establishments for sale to the
ultimate consumer.

SANITARY CONTROLS: Of the states reporting in
the NP survey, only North Dakota said that it does not
set any physical standards for slaughtering or process—
ing plants. In Wisconsin, where the sanitation program
for slaughtering plants is administered by the State
Board of Health while the program for processing plants
is under the Department of Agriculture, officials in~
dicated that minimum physical standards have been
established for slaughtering facilities but not for
processing plants.

The standards of New Jersey, for example, as sum-
marized by Milton Ruth, chief of food and drug pro-
grams, division of environmental health, State Depart-
ment of Health, “require that there must be adequate
light throughout the establishment; that sufficient ven-
tilation is provided; that potable water is supplied; that
plumbing has been provided in a manner to protect
public health; that adequate toilet facilities are pro-
vided; that plant and toilet wastes are properly dis—
posed of; that equipment is adequate and properly
placed for good working conditions and ease in cleaning;
that proper cleaning is practiced, and adequate refriger—
ation is provided.”

The standards set by some states, however, are pretty
sketchy and could cover almost anything from a laun-
dry to a hamburger stand.

Every state indicated that it conducts sanitation in-
spections of slaughtering and processing plants, but this




area appears to be the weakest section of the state reg-

ulatory pieture.

State agencies reported that plant facilities are in-
periodically,” “twice a year,” “de-
as often as possible,” etc., with

1 HE 3::c-ii-1stry’s problem in Lou—
isia‘rzr'. says Lawrence S. Frey
of ‘37-.» A. Frey & Sons, Inc.,

New Orleans, is “cheap, cheap, cheap
sausage.” y is president of the
newly-act} .2.th Louisiana Meat
Packers A>s..-':<’>ciation, which hopes to
do sometiii» 22.; about it.

Althougn she problem affects Lou-

isiana cog-.5211mers, too, they might
feel that ﬁssiy’re just lucky to find
such “bar-32.x..urins” if they have both-
ered to wad—and rely on—the
state’s law» and regulations dealing
with adu'ﬁ-aration and misbranding

of food. 3 other states, Louisiana
protects citizens “on the books”
against -£f.'an"f?’;'”10mlC cheats. Its basic
food lat-v is patterned after the
Federal Trad, Drug and Cosmetic
Act of 13-232, and specific label con—

trol regua-iétions of the State Board
of Health governing meat product
ingrediesf. almost copy those of the
Meat Ins;- «z:tion Division, U. S. De-
partment Agriculture.

There, She similarity too often
ends, acmrding to Frey, who ex-
plains thzz‘i the problem is two—fold:
1) Enforiimment of the state stand—
ards comes from the parish level.
Most parish health departments are
not active in this regard and, be—
sides, they don’t have facilities to
analyze product. 2) The State Pur—
chasing Department has, in effect,
“invited” cheap meat products up to
now by failing to adopt any specifi-
cations for packinghouse items
bought by the state.

Although the Purchasing Depart—
ment has written ironclad specifica-
tlons on» canned fruit, vegetables
and about every other food item,
Frey continues, the agency allows
every state institution to write its
OWn specifications on meat. As a re-
sult, bidders for the substantial state
business find themselves faced with
inch contradictory specifications as
Wieners, all-meat, not to exceed 3
per cent cereal” or with loose guides
like “Bacon, slab.”

Bids on a single offer to buy wie—
ners may range anywhere from 25¢
t9 45¢ a pound. Since state institu-
tlons usually accept the lowest bid,
a lot of sausage manufacturers have
resorted to cheap sausage, using
lungs, udders, melts, etc., that they

normally would tank.

Frey, whose firm makes only top
grade product, sags one packer is
selling smoked sausage at wholesale
for 19¢ a pound.

Things are looking up in Louisi-
ana, however. Purchasing Depart-
ment officials contacted by the state
association said they would welcome

packers to come in and write spec-

ifications on packinghouse products.
Frey is appointing a committee to
Work on specifications and hopes to
get some guides from other state
associations that may have faced
similar problems. Leaders of the Lou—
isiana association also plan to en—
courage all members to adhere to
state regulations and make quality
sausage, enforcement or no.

LOTS OF COMPANY: While de-
tails may differ, the Creole State
has a lot of company elsewhere in
its less-than-successful attempts to

control the characteristics and in- ‘

gredients of meat and meat prod-
ucts, packaging, labeling, etc., under
specific meat and sausage laws or
general food laws.

Nowhere is the boa constrictor
type of approach to regulation more
apparent than here, and nowhere is
it more exasperating from the proc-—_
essor’s standpoint, THE NATIONAL
PROVISIONER was told time and time
again in the past year during the
magazine’s 50-state survey on state
meat laws. Here, also, is found the
opportunity for a many-way con-
flict of ideas and interests involving
such factors as a traditional art (sau-
sage making), economics, science
and various concepts of public health
and product quality and identity.

It goes without saying that if all
meat and edible by-products were
sold and eaten in a fresh and rela-
tively unmodified form, the task of
regulation would be simpler and
would involve fewer headaches for
state inspectors and heartaches for
packers and processors. This Is not
true, however, and is getting to be
less so as science and technology ad-
vance and housewives demand that
more and more of their traditional
kitchen duties be performed at the
processor level. .

In the segment of the busmess
where the original form of meat IS

is perfunctory and very infrequent or is not carried
Where effective sanitary controls are lacking, plant

licensing serves little purpose except to enable the state
to collect a fee.

‘Philadelphia Lawyer' Went Thataway

changed by curing, grinding, smok-
ing, cooking, canning and other proc-
esses, the NP has found the greatest
zealousness in regulation, the greatest
concern over adulteration, misbrand-
ing, additives, packaging, weights
and standards of identity, as well as,
unfortunately, some of the most
doubtful practices in the industry.

LEGAL MAZE AT BEST: Since
this article is going to venture into
the area of enforcement and the “le—
gality” of some of the state laws and
regulations, the legal maze involved
in a comparison of what appears on
“the books” of the 50 states will be
oversimplified.

In the great majority of the states,
general food laws (modeled after the
Federal Food and Drugs Act of 1906
and the Federal Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act of 1938, rather than
the U. S. Meat Inspection Act) pro-
vide for automatic or administrative
adoption of federal standards except
where other standards are prescribed
by state law. Such specific laws have
been enacted by several states in
connection with the manufacture of
sausage.

Federal requirements for correct
branding or labeling of products
have not been applied quite so gen-
erally at the state level since adop-
tion is not automatically provided. In
some instances full labeling is re-
quired under the misbranding pro-
visions of the general food laws, but
there is variation in the extent of
interpretation and enforcement.

(As the first legal problem, wheth-
er it is legally permissible for a state
to provide for automatic adoption of
prospective federal regulations is
seriously questioned by some ex-
perts in constitutional law. Thomas
W. Christopher, associate dean and
professor of law at Emory Univer-
sity, Atlanta, Ga., discussed this
problem of incorporating future laws
by reference at the 1960 annual
meeting of the New York State Bar
Association’s section on food, drug
and cosmetic law.

(In his talk, reported in the June
issue of Food Drug Cosmetic Law
Journal, Christopher argues that a
statute flatly turning over food stan-
dards to a separate jurisdiction is an
invalid delegation of legislative pow-

 

 




 

er. Since many states are expected
to follow the lead of the federal gov—
ernment in the field of food addi-
tives regulation, and the urge for
uniformity is great, he suggests that
the safe thing for a legislature to do
is to lodge discretion in a state offi-
cial and set out a guide in the stat-
ute, providing for administrative
promulgation of state definitions and
standards conforming “so far as prac—
ticable” to those of the US.)

GLANCE AT SOME RULES:
Some of the more unusual provisions
of the laws and regulations of some of
the states will be mentioned brieﬂy.
These are mainly concerned with:

1) Defining what specific sausage
and meat products are and what
they must and must not contain.

2) Defining what meat and other
ingredients may and may not be
used, and the limits of usage, in
sausage and meat products.

3) Establishing minimum or maxi-
mum limits on product constituents
such as fat, protein and moisture.

In Michigan, for example, no prod—
uct may be sold as sausage, except
liver sausage, potato sausage, blood
sausage, bockwurst, kishka, and New
England pressed luncheon, which is
not graded and which does not meet
Grade I specification. Grade I sau-
sage must consist of skeletal meat,
may contain dry milk solids but no
cereal or soya flour, and may not
contain by—products, heart, tongue,
liver, cracklings, tripe, lungs, melts,
eyes, stomachs, weasand meats, ud-
der, lips, ears or snouts. Protein con-
tent must be at least 12 per cent.
Grade I sausage may consist of
striated muscle of chicken or tur-
key. Pork sausage is limited to 45
per cent trimmable fat—50 per cent
by chemical analysis—and hambur-
ger, chili con carne, meat loaf, liver
sausage, head cheese and blood
sausage are specifically defined.

The record of actions brought by
Michigan authorities against both
intrastate and interstate processors
indicates that sausage makers must
have considerable difficulty in meet—
ing some of the requirements.

One national packer has for many
years included a small percentage
of heart meat in one of his sausage
products. However, since he cannot
sell such sausage in Michigan, about
2 per cent of this product made in
one of his plants must be “heartless.”
Occasionally, of course, there is a
“snafu” in the shipping department
and Michigan gets a few pieces of
the regular product, which are al—
most sure to end up in the hands
of a state inspector since the state-
ment of ingredients on the label sig-
nals the violation.

In the Pennsylvania regulations,

sausage and meat product standards
are covered in 50 different sections
including one devoted to “Cannibal,
cannibal sandwich or cannibal sand-
wich meat.” The latter, according to
the regulation, “shall be composed
of meat derived solely from beef.”

Scrapple isn’t just scrapple either,
under Pennsylvania law. The regu—
lations define both “Ponhaus scrap-
ple” and “Philadelphia scrapple” as
“The product consisting of meat, fat
and/ or meat by-products, mixed
with one or more of the following:
Meal, vegetable flour, soya flour,
flour of grain, water or milk prod-
uct and cooked with seasoning,” but
the definition of Philadelphia scrap-
ple adds: “It must contain not less
than 40 per cent meat and/ or meat
by-products by total weight of fin-
ished product.”

Pennsylvania prides itself on its
high sausage standards. Yet, one re—
sponsible processor in the state told
the NP that analysis of the products
of his Pennsylvania and out-of-state
competitors consistently shows that
they do not comply with the state’s
requirements.

Ohio is another state in which
various types of sausage and ingre-
dients are defined in great detail.

MORE REGULATIONS: Tinting
of casings, permitted by the MID, is
prohibited in eight of the states—-
California, Colorado, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsyl—
vania and Utah—and is restricted in.
Wisconsin. Most of the states follow
the MID restriction on the use of ce-
real, vegetable starch and/ or dried
milk solids, permitting 3.5 per cent
individually or collectively, but some
have different rules, e.g.: Arkansas,
5 per cent milk only; Florida, 5 per
cent total, including not more than
31/2 per cent of cereal or soya flour;
Maine, 6 per cent in Type 1 franks
and bologna; Massachusetts, 2 per.
cent; Michigan, 4 per cent milk only;
Pennsylvania, none, and South Da-
kota, 2 per cent. In Georgia, “all
meat” wieners and bologna may
contain a maximum of 3 per cent dry
milk. Regular product may contain
up to 6 per cent extenders, but no:
more than half of this may be cereal
or soya flour.

State requirements with respect to
added moisture in sausage generally
follow those of the MID, allowing 3
per cent in fresh and 10 per cent in
cooked sausage, but Alaska permits
3 per cent in fresh and “as needed”
in smoked and cooked products;
Florida, not more than 3 per cent in
fresh and 12 per cent in cooked;
Kansas, 2 per cent in fresh and 10
in cooked; Maine, quantity to make
product palatable in franks, bologna
and loaves; Massachusetts, sufficient

only to make product palatable and
facilitate grinding, chopping and mix—
ing; Michigan, fresh, none and total
moisture in Grade I may not exceed
65 per cent; Minnesota, 3 per cent in
fresh and as needed for palatability
in smoked and cooked, and Wiscon—
sin, not more than 10 per cent of fin-
ished product weight in smoked and
cooked, and not more than 3 per cent
of finished weight in fresh.

A few of the states have inter-
esting requirements with regard to
packaging. Minnesota, for example,
says that transparent wrappers, col-
ored or printed in orange, red, yel-
low, amber or any combination, so
as to mislead with respect to color,
quantity or kind, may not be used
on any meat product. Colorado pro-
hibits colored picture reproductions
on packages of luncheon meat,
boiled ham and sausage where such
reproductions give a false impression
as to the product contained, or its
leanness, or make it appear better
or of greater value than it is.

Enactment of pending New Jersey
legislation (A-504) to protect con-
sumers from inferior food and drugs
was urged by Milton Ruth, chief of
the bureau of food and drugs, New
Jersey State Department of Health,
last week as the legislature ended
its summer recess. Ruth said the bill
would give the Department of Health
power to establish standards of iden—
tity for meat products, limiting cer-
tain ingredients and regulating the
use of color in or on meat products.
If the measure is enacted, he de—
clared, the best way to make it ef-
fective would be to license all man-
ufacturers and legislation to provide
for such licensing is being drafted.
(New Jersey now licenses slaughter-
houses but not meat processing
establishments.)

ENFORCEMENT: In a question—
naire sent to the appropriate agency
in each of the 50 states, the NP asked
how the state enforces regulations
covering product ingredients. A few
states where meat inspection is man-
datory indicated that label control is
part of the meat inspectors’ duties
and surveillance is continuous. Most
agencies, however, said that their
men make periodic inspections at
manufacturing plants to check com-
pliance and/ or their field forces
check samples from retail stores.

A question as to how often checks
are made at manufacturing plants
drew the following replies: “Month-
ly or as often as needed depending
on conditions,” “Once to twice a
year,” “No set pattern,” “At least
once a year or oftener if consumer
complaints are received,” “Weekly
or more often when deemed neces-
sary,” “At least one each year,”




“Frequentiy,” “As often as pos—
sible,” “(rut check,” “Several times
a year. Iii-wagular and. unannounced.”

The frequency of sample checks

at retail Stall-Hes was described as fol-
lows: “I—Ewwtinely,” “Occasionally,”
“At least -s1ce each year,” “No set
pattern,” 3‘"eriodically by state, fre_

quently by, iiocal authorities,” “When

adulteratiwe. or misbranding is sus—
pected,” "fifeeklyj’ “Once every
four or months,” “Twice a
month,” A-vice annually with re-

check if xiv :,,sded,” “At irregular in-
tervals.” 3 “no states reported that

COMPET’.¥.>"§.NCE: How successful
is state regulation of the sausage
and promssed meat business? A
fragment (Ff information from anoth—
er important area of the country
may be indicative.

In an address at the 1959 annual
conference of the Association of
Food and Drug Officials of the
United States, Gilman K. Crowell,
chief of the bureau of food and
Chemistry, New Hampshire Depart-
ment of Health, cited the results of
analysis by New England food and
drug officials of 600 samples of
ground and processed meats to de—
termine compliance with established
standards of identity. These meats
had been processed in state and fed-
erally inSpected plants and in local
markets. Reported Crowell:

“A complete survey of the frank—
fllrts offered for sale in New Eng—
land revealed that 24 per cent con-
tﬁlined moisture in excess of the 10
per cent permitted in the standard;
60 per cent contained excessive dry
milk solids when this material was
deClared as an ingredient, and 17
per cent contained milk when its
presence was illegal, i. e., in ‘311-

meat’ and ‘all-beef’ products.

“In order to set a realistic con-
sumer acceptance standard for pork
sausage, many states have adopted
a 50 per cent maximum fat content
(total ether extractive) rather than
the federal standard which is based
on per cent trimmable fat. Based
on the fat standard of 50 per cent,
the survey indicated 40 per cent of
the samples contained fat in excess
of the standard.”

In California, which probably has
the most MID-like system of any
state, the bureau of meat inspection,
State Department of Agriculture,
increased its laboratory activities in
1959. The bureau reported last June:

“During 1959, the meat inspection
laboratory examined 2,671 samples
of various products and materials
for adulterations, contamination,
preservatives, artificial coloring, net
weights, and excessive amounts of
added water or fillers to sausage
and other meat products. The tab-
ulated results of these examinations
are as follows:

TABLE 'I

Miscellaneous 13 5 0 18
Totals 2291 357 23 2671
*Samples not in suitable condition for proper

“This total reflects an increase of
633 samples or 31 per cent over
1958. The increase in chemical labo-
ratory control is necessary to keep
pace with the increasing, amount of
meat products produced in state es-
tablishments.”

WHY TIGHTER? Why some of
the states have found it necessary
to adopt regulations different from
those of the USDA Meat Inspection
Division is a question that brings
forth argument. It is claimed that
some of the more restrictive stand—
ards are better, although this seems
to be debatable. In spite of the pos-
sibilities for adulteration, deception
and even danger to public health
which may exist in this field, the
NP is convinced that efforts to en-
force rigid and unreasonable stand—
ards actually protect only a minute
and insignificant portion of the pub—
lic interest and may cause much
economic harm to the industry. _

Standards cannot be enforced by
simply promulgating them, Wthh 1S
about the situation in some places.
They probably can be enforced ef-
fectively and consistently only .at the
processingvplant level. Sampling 1n
the market, unless it is done on a
massive scale, is certainly a hit—and—
miss Sort of control and one agalnst
which the angle operators are W111-

ing to bet for the sake of competi-
tive advantage and an extra profit.
Under this kind of control, more-
over, the accidental violator may be
penalized much more severely than
he deserves.

Qualitative and quantitative
standards should not be established
for meat products unless there is a
pretty general voluntary acceptance
of these standards, and there is
some trade custom and tradition be-
hind them, and there is a reason-
able hope that they can be en—
forced consistently for the industry
as a whole.

Without challenging the rights of
the states, and of the industry mem—
bers within the states, to cooperate
in setting up their own peculiar
standards, the NP feels that they
should have reason behind them
rather than prejudice and a desire
to keep out the products of the
“furriners.”

PRE-EMPTION Q U E S T I O N:
Whether the states could success—
fully defend their right to enforce
more stringent regulations over
meat and meat products turned out
by out—of—state processors than
those imposed by the federal gov—
ernment is somewhat questionable,
in fact, in the light of several court
decisions. In Kansas City Packing
Co., Inc., Respondent v. City of
New York et a1., Appellants, 309
N. Y. 696, decided on July 8, 1955,
by the New York Court of Appeals,
it was held that a 10 per cent limit
on added water in beef brisket im-
posed by the New York City board
of health (Sanitary Code, Section
140a) was void as to the sale of the
plaintiff’s products in interstate
commerce but valid as to the sale
of products purchased by the plain—
tiff in the state of New York and
sold in New York City.

The high court ruling confirmed
without opinion the Appellate Divi—
sion decision, which said: “The trial
court properly found that Section
140a of the Sanitary Code . . . con-
flicts with the federal law permit-
ting 20 per cent of water and in—
fringes on federal policy so far as
interstate commerce is concerned.”
The Appellate Division further
stated, however, that “Congress did
not intend completely to occupy the
field involved” so Section 140a was
valid as it applied to briskets pro-
curred within the state and sold in
the city.

Since the Sanitary Code provision,
thus interpreted, would discriminate
against local firms and benefit the
“furriners,” New York processors
persuaded the city council to repeal
the controversial section following
the high court’s decision.

 




(Pennsylvania regulations dealing
with cured and corned beef prohibit
more than 10 per cent total added
substance over green weight.)

In the 1959 case of Walter Straus
and Son v. Florida Livestock Board,
the Circuit Court of Leon County
(Tallahassee), Florida, held that a
Florida statute requiring state in—
spection of MID-approved foreign
cold storage meat before it could
be sold in that state was invalid be-
cause it conﬂicted with the “ple-
nary power” of Congress to regulate
interstate and foreign commerce.

The Florida Livestock Board,
which insisted that 100 per cent
state inspection of foreign cold stor—
age meat was necessary because the
USDA’s 10 per cent sample check
was not enough to detect all con—
taminated and insect-infested prod-
uct, ceased such inspections follow-
ing the Circuit Court ruling but
asked the Florida Supreme Court
to reverse the decision. The Su-
preme Court sent the case back to
the District Court of Appeals, which
affirmed the decision without elab—
orating on the opinion, and the F10-
rida Livestock Board told the NP
it plans no further appeals.

(California also has a statute re-
quiring state inspection of foreign
cold storage meat.)

In the case of the City of Newark
v. Libby et al., decided April 11,
1958, Municipal Magistrate A. Mil-
ton Jacobs dismissed complaints
brought by the city division of
health against six meat canning
companies charged with failing to
list ingredients of corned beef hash
on their can labels. The defense

pointed out that a standard of iden-
tity for corned beef hash had been
established by the MID, and the
city’s counsel agreed that where the
federal government has pre—empted
authority, neither state nor munici-
pal governments can interfere.
Thereupon, Magistrate Jacobs dis-
missed the complaints.

Until 1942, the generally-accepted
rule (Davenport rule) seems to
have been that states under their
police power could impose more
stringent regulations in fields over
which they exercise concurrent ju-
risdiction with the federal govern-
ment unless there was a direct and
irreconcilable conflict between them.
Savage v. Jones, 225 U.S. 501, for ex-
ample, allowed Indiana to seize as
“misbranded” certain foods comply-
ing with the federal Pure Food and
Drugs Act.

In the case of Cloverleaf Butter
Co. v. Patterson (315 U.S. 148), de-
cided in 1942, however, the U. S.
Supreme Court ruled that Alabama
had no right to seize contaminated
packing stock butter because the
federal law dealing with renovated
butter, of which packing stock is an
ingredient, pre—empted the field by
implication.

Congress tried to deal with this
question of pre-emption by implica-
tion last year because of the Su—
preme Court’s expansion on the
doctrine in a sedition case. HR-3,
which would have spelled out rules
of construction for federal courts to
determine whether Congress in-
tended fully to occupy fields in
which it legislates, soon became pop—
ularly known as “The Lawyers Full

Employmeht Act of 1959.”

Confusion over What the federal
v. state rule now is, and what HR-
3 would do, was apparent during
days of House debate before the
Congressmen decided to stick to
lawmaking and let the courts con-
tinue to determine their “intent”
where it isn’t made clear.

As one Congressman put it: “The
poor nonlawyer members of Con-
gress are inclined to blame their
confusion on the fact that they nev—
er went to law school. The lawyers
among us get the feeling either that
we have been out of law school too
long or went to the wrong law
school in the first place.”

As a practical matter, of course,
interstate operators should realize
that it is not likely that the federal
government will challenge the states
in this field, and that they must do
their own fighting against state laws
or regulations if they believe such a
course is desirable.

In some cases, interstate packers
have concluded, after weighing the
possible gains against the difficulties
they might suffer as the result of
challenging the government of a
state in which they must do busi-
ness, that it is better to “go along”
with the inconvenience of compli-
ance. In the same way, state and
locally inspected packers have indi-
cated that they do not contest short-
comings and inequities in the pro-
grams under which they operate be-
cause they know that authorities
could “throw the book” of other .
business laws and ordinances at
them if they made trouble.

(continued) Roaostoca TO PROGRESS

Bereavements in some phases of slaughtering are under catchy and progreSo is being
made; it is not true that these haprovements can be applied. practically by all or
even a majoriey of inchxstry planter in the near future. Some of the improvements
still require evaluation; one method favored by some hmmne spokesmen was rejected
long ago because it endangers effective inspection.

It is a great pity that exaggeration and emotional appeal are being used in behalf
of a bill to force “progress“ on the meat industry. Any legislation they might evoke
can only endanger the real mthecessarily slow progress that is being made on the
problem by the meat industry and humane and sanitary authorities.

NOT A BOLT Mir- A VACUUM

We sat in a. meeting recently and we were stunned ... not by a knocking homer ; not by
a captive bolt pistol, but by a vacuum.

Yes, stunned, by the apparent la ck of lmowledge on the part of a group of literate
beef packers about a device and methods which have been descreibed editorially and
advertised in The ﬁctional Provisioner and other publications for a decade.

During the diam-scion of the humane slaughter problem faced by packers, it would not
have been surprising, had there been differences of opinion between members of the
group as to the practicability of using the conventional bolt pistol, and inqurcvements
now on the "way, for cattle storming; It was disconcerting to learn that few particiu
pants in the meeting knew what the captive bolt pistol is, what it does, where it comes
from, under what conditions it can he used most effectively and its advantages and
limitations. ' '

We are not suggesting that the pistol be used for cattle stunning; we do suggest that
lack of familiarity with the device and its characteristics indicates that many packers
do net assimilate the information which is conscientiously relayed to them by the Pro-
visicner, other publications and their trade associations.

The Provisioner does not claim to he omniscient, or to cover every development in the
field of meat packing; we are certain, however, that Weekwinweek-out reading; of its
news, advertisements, feature articles and market reports will keep every executive

' and supervisor informed on the major and minor ideas and trends which may mean dollars
of profit (or avoidance of loss) to their companies.

We suggest that before the company president, or any other packer executive, "initials"
his Provision-er dorm the line to other officials or supervisory employee, he extract
from its articles and advertisements the maximm in facts and ideae for his own
amidance in magement. Then he should make certain that other mariners of his staff
do the same.

EXPRESSIONS OF VIEWS on'mandatory'slaughter legislatian'hy a large numberof amall
and large meat packers thuld help Congress toward more deliberate and reasonable
handling of the problem, accoraing to'hhshington ohaervers. Following public
hearings on S~1636, at which.a.numher of meat industry‘and'USDA representatives
opposed the bill, the Senate agriculture committee has agreed t0 leave its record
»open for rebuttal statements. A statement of oyposition tn the comhulsory apgreach
has been filed by the.hmerican Meat Institute, along with a repart an inﬁustry‘efftrtt
to perfect humane and economical slaughter'mhthodt. Meanwhile, hgwaver, proponents
of the legislation have been active, and membera of the Sanate agricultura subu
cammittee handling S~1636, a committee headed by Senator Humphr'y'ofjhinnesota, are
in need of representative-expressians 0f apinien fram packers fram.all parts of the
United States. haMbers of Senator Humphrey‘s subcommittee include Senator Scott of
Nerth Carolina and Senater'hhndt of Earth.Dakota. In additian.to these senatora,
packers might wish to makt their Views human to the varicus congressmen frat their
own statas.

July 21, 1956

THE ”HUMANE SMUGHTER” bill (3-1636) has been reported out by the Senate agriculture
committee in drastically revised farm, providing only for establiahmtnt of an ad»
viscry and research committee. PrOViSiQnS‘WhiCh wanld.have campelled.pachhrs ta
change slaughtering mehtods hava been eliminated, in accordance with racommandatiens
of industry organizations. The reviaed bill would set up a tanﬁmamber cammittee t0
study'slanghter methods and handling of livestock and pulﬁtry'primr to slaughtar.
The committee is directed to make specific recommendations Within twn yeart an ”the
adoption by the industry of humane methods of slaughtering.” ho opposition t0 the
hill in its present form.is expected. Even though the measure passes the Sanata,
however, it may'not‘be adopted at this seasiOn of Congress since there is no companion
jhill in the Henge and little time remains for hearings before adjournment.

' A UNIVERSAL PROBLEM

Whatever mmy‘be the fate of the Senate version of the "humane slaughter" bill (841636)
during the present session at Congress, we believe that the mhat induatry's policy'
should be about as follaws: - «

l. Recognize that all slaughterers must, SUODGT or later and valuntarlly'or
involuntarily, satisfy the damand for imprcvement in their slaughtering mhthods.

2. Carry'out the intent 0f the Senate bill (whatevar 1th status) hy‘intensifying
study and eXperimhntatian in the field of slaughtering techniques during the next twu
years, or for as 10mg as may be necessary.

we consider tha problem of developing satisfactory methods to be immﬁdiate, grave and
difficult. It merits an allucut ”crash priority“ research pragram.by'the most able
agency or aganciea available. 'we believe that intereﬁt in the problem.tran3cends

the baundarieﬁ 0f the groupengs into which industry companies sometimes classify'themn
selves ~~»nati®nal, indeyendent, amall, large, ragional, etc. ~~ and that all concerns
in the field should.be willing to support research aimad at its sdlution with their
dollars and their facilities. It :3 the type 0f andeaver in which all ghouad.coqperate
for mutual benefit, since all.must pay the panalty for failure to achieve satisfactory
improvement.

Such a reaearch prhgram.might coat hundreds of thaasands of &ollars, 0r even mare,

but the expenSe would undoubteéky be small in compariaon with the capital investment
and increased aperating coats which might be impssed on the industry if it were forced,
thraugh default, to adapt impractical and ineffic ient ”humane" methods of slaughter.

'we can see no reason why all elaments in the in&ustry'should not put aeide their
$ametime differenceﬁ and work tegathaﬁ toward a ﬁolution of this universal problem.

FACTS ABOUT
' HUMANE

SLAUGHTER

What is the cost of humane slaughter?

A captive bolt pistol costs $100. Ammunition
costs 21/295 per animal. The cost of the new Reming-
ton stunning instrument, going into production short.
1y, will be in the same general range. The American
manufacturers of the carbon dioxide tunnel have no
set price, but the cost of a Danish model which
anesthetizes 240 pigs per hour is $4500 in Denmark.
Cost of carbon dioxide per pig is less than 1¢.

How does humane slaughter affect labor?

Men working on the killing ﬂoor show an over-
whelming preference for humane methods of slaugh-
ter. Humane methods enormously reduce noise, ac-
cident hazards, nervous strain, physical effort and
dirtiness of work in this area. Slight increases and
decreases in employment, depending on species of
animals and different methods used, could be ex-
pected to balance each other so there would be no
change in the overall employment picture.

Are humane methods of slaughter
practical and economical?

Yes. The two largest packing companies using a
humane method—the Oscar Mayer Company and the
George A. Hormel Company—adopted these methods
primarily for economic reasons.

Following is a partial listing of packers who volun-
tarily adopted a humane method of slaughter which
they have used over a period of years in successful
competition with packers who use inhumane methods:

Using the captive bolt pistol to stun cattle prior
to slaughter are:

 




 

Oscar Mayer Co., Madison, Wisconsin; Seitz
Packing Co., St. Joseph, Missouri; Great Falls
Meat Co., Great Falls, Montana; Cudahy Broth-
ers C0., Cudahy, Wisconsin; Peters Packing Co.,
McKeesport, Pennsylvania; L. A. Frey & Sons,
New Orleans, Louisiana; Elsheimers Meat Prod-
ucts, West Union, Iowa; C. E. Richards & Sons,
Muscatine, Iowa; American Stores Co., Pueblo,
Colorado; Fresno Meat Packing Co., Fresno,
California; Chicago Dressed Beef, Worcester,
Massachusetts; Salter Packing Company, Vernon,
California; Triangle Meat Co., Chicago, Illinois.

Using carbon dioxide anesthetization of hogs
prior to slaughter is George A. Hormel Co., in
its Austin, Minnesota plant where the method
was invented and in its Fremont, Nebraska
plant where a subsequent installation was made
and a 90% reduction in internal ham bruises
effected by eliminating shackling, and sticking
the sleeping hogs in a prone position.

(An impartial survey by the well known journal
of business and ﬁnance, Forbes Magazine, Jan-
uary, 1956, ranks the Hormel Company ahead
of all other major packers for sound business
management.)

Is it practical to make the use of humane
methods of slaughter compulsory?

Yes. Compulsory humane slaughter legislation is
in effect in the following countries: (The dates in-
dicate the year when humane slaughter legislation
was enacted in each country)

Switzerland 1874 England 1933

Netherlands 1920 Finland 1934
Norway 1924 Sweden 1937
Scotland 1928 Fiji 1948
Ireland 1932 New Zealand 1951

Parts of France, Germany, Austria and Australia
have also enacted humane slaughter legislation.

Would livestock producers or consumers be
penalized ﬁnancially by enactment of humane
slaughter legislation?

No. The cost of humane slaughter is very small
and is more than made up by savings through reduc-
tion of bruised meat.

3-53,
m
'31 .3

Is electrical stunning a necessary part of
humane slaughter?

No. The passage of humane slaughter legislation
would not affect the Department of Agriculture’s
ban on electrical stunning. Carbon dioxide anestheti-
zation, the Remington stunning instrument and the
captive bolt pistol are entirely sufﬁcient for the stun-
ning of all types of animals in all types of packing
plants. The results of recent scientiﬁc research in
the United States, Great Britain and Denmark (where
difficulties with electrical stunning led to lifting of
the humane slaughter regulations temporarily), will
undoubtedly be useful to the Department in con-
ﬁrming or modifying its present ruling. But the
desirability and practicability of humane slaughter
legislation is in no way dependent upon the one
method of stunning which is both complicated and
controversial: electrical stunning.

Why should the United States enact

compulsory humane slaughter legislation?

1. The inﬂiction of unnecessary suffering on ani-
mals is abhorrent to the majority of American citizens.

2. The United States is a world leader; its set
standards of humaneness should not be inferior to
those of the western European democracies, most
of which already have such legislation.

3. More than $50,000,000 worth of meat is wasted
annually in the United States through bruising.
Humane slaughter is an important factor in bruise
reduction.

What is the difference between humane
slaughter and the methods now used in
most American packing plants?

Routine slaughter of hogs: 1) The hogs are driven
into a pen and shackled with a heavy chain around
one hind leg. Common abuses are beating recalci-
trant hogs with the shackle (causing bruises), piling
up of hogs on the one being dragged aloft by a
mechanical pulley, breaking of leg or pelvis of
heavy hogs, hog’s foot slipping out of the shackle
so that the animal falls from a height on top of
the others. 2) Hogs are carried aloft over a 14-foot
wheel to the sticking area, where a man with a knife
cuts the jugular veins of the screaming animals,
which then are left to bleed to death. Improperly
stuck hogs have been known to go into the scalding
tank while still alive and conscious.

 




Routine slaughter of sheep, lambs and most calves:
This is similar to hog slaughter, except that these
docile animals create less disturbance and in their
death struggles cause fewer injuries to the men.

Routine slaughter of cattle and some calves: 1)
The animals are driven into stunning pens, usually
2-4 at a time. 2) A knocker (a man with a long-
handled hammer) stands on a platform and tries to
hit the animal’s forehead in a manner to cause it to
fall unconscious without doing too much damage to
pate and brains. A recent report on routine slaughter
at one of the biggest plants in the United States
states: "On the ﬁrst blow with the hammer, the
knocker felled the ﬁrst steer, whereupon the other
two terriﬁed animals climbed all over the prone
body. With all this stumbling and lunging, it took
two blows to fell the others. By the time this was
done, the ﬁrst one was coming to and trying to get
to his feet. I counted nine additional blows with the
hammer before that one went out!” Ten to thirteen
blows are not uncommon.

* at: a: :2:

Humane slaughter requires that animals be in-
stantaneously stunned with one shot (as with the
captive bolt pistol or Remington stunning instru-
ment) or that they be rapidly anesthetized (as with
carbon dioxide) prior to shackling and bleeding.
(Hogs fall asleep in 5-8 seconds in 65% carbon
dioxide. If not slaughtered, they awaken within
three minutes and are willing to repeat the trip
through the carbon dioxide tunnel with no objection,
thus demonstrating the humaneness of this method.)

A quarter of a century ago, the maior
packers led the public to believe that they
would adopt humane slaughter voluntarily.
They are trying again in 1956 to convince
us that they will do so. But the maiority of
animals have never received a merciful
death in any country until compulsory hu-
mane slaughter legislation was enacted. If
the packers are willing to adopt humane
slaughter, they should have no obiection to
hills which give them two full years to do
so and allow them to choose the method
they prefer.

January 3, 1956

The H norable Ezra T. Benson
Secretary of Agriculture
~Washington 25, 13.0 .

Dear Secretary Benson,

I have beenaidvised that legislation to require humane
treatmentofanimals in meat-slaughtering operations is being revised
for Xxxnnduz reintroduction into Uongrees, and am writing to urge
that your Department give a favorable recommendation to tHOSQ measures.

Your Department's previous report indicated sympathy
with the intent, but considered the private industries involved
should have the reaponsibility for correcting the situation. I
do not believe this position was entirely sound, because if left to
their owncievices, there is little incentive to the industries to
chanbe current regerttable procedures. it seems to me a preper
function of the Federal Government to take apprOpriate regulatory
action where an ethical consideration is involved, an action which
will in no way injure the more reputable ccmcerns.

I have had opportunity to see packing plants in
Operation. In some instances, every effort appears to be made to
undertake the killing in a humane and efficient fashion; but in
others, this certainly is not the case. It does not seem equipable
that the latter should be able to disregard their responsiblity, as
they will continue to do if not required to correct their practices.

I nets the present legislation allows a delay of
five years before being applied. Such.a period serves no apparent
purpose, except to defer dorrection of the situation..Any grace
period should be as brief as can reasonably be required, certainly
not longer than two years.

Yours sincerely,

Fred E, Packard
Executive Secretary

CC Senator Humphrey

Dear Miss Stevens: O

I am glad my little effort about the humane slaughter
bills has served a useful purpose, and that you approve it.
I had a pleasant reply from.3enator Humphrey,eaxpressing his
appreciation. A reply from the Department of Agriculture
acknowledges my letter, but says nothing more except that the
office actually handling the matter is the Agricultural Research
Service, U.S.D.A., of which Mr. C. D. Van Houweling is the
Director of the Livestock Regulatory Program.

0

I have no objection whatever to my letter being published,
if that will help the cause. However, I believe it would be more
graceful to have it submitted to editors by you rather than by me.
I have to write editors quite a lot on matters directly relating to
national parks, which is the responsibility of the National Parks
Association, and do not believe it entirely appropriate that I also
address them directly on matters in other fields. So, if you wish
to do so, you are entirely at liberty to have my letter copied, and
submit it to such editors as might wish to use it. You are also
welcome to quote from it in anything you write, if’you wish.

It might be well to indicate in such publications that I am a
Director of Defenders of Furbearers, as well as E;ecutive Secretary
of the National Parks Association, since the subject falls more
directly in the province of Defenders.

I am impressed with the common sense of your approach to.
the problem, as shown in your pamphlet. It is entirely sound to
attempt to correct an undersirable practice, as you are doing, and
I believe it would reduce your effectiveness were you to fulminate
against the meat-packing industry or to attempt to stop the use of
livestock for meat, as some of the more emotional groups would do.
Let me know when I can be of further service.

Yours sincerely, MM

IN THE PAST few months a record
amount of federal moneym—nearly $30
millionmhas been earmarked for new
medical research buildings throughout
the country. Alabama alone is to get
more than a million and a quarter, dol~
lars in this huge program pushed through
Congress earlier this year under the lead»
ership of Sen. Lister Hill. ‘

But dollars and doctors alone do not
guarantee the success of these research
programs. whether on cancer. heart dis
ease or other killers and cripplers of
man. The contribution-«made. by labora-
tory animals-“dog, monkey or mouse—«is
almost. immeasurable. And little noted.

With this new stress on improving
man’s future health, man now has an
opportunity to assure as humane treats

mals in their gallant and often final days.

Albert'SChweitzer' medal every year to
the person doing the most for animals.

Dr. SChweitzerm—physician'.‘ musician,

philosopher-4s well known for his “rev--

The big meat-packing industry offers
an example of how such a public move
fora lanocompel more humane treat»
ment of animals can be invited. For years
packers have been saying that, if left‘
alone, they will adopt. voluntarily less
cruel ways of slaughtering livestock. But
the untold suffering has continued and
in last session of Congress three bills
were-introduced aimed at stopping it.-

plants the more efficient and humane
substitute for the poleaxe—«the captive
bolt pistol. Perhaps they realized why
a dozen other countries alreadybave
adopted humane slaughter legislation.

There Will be, strong backing in the .

85th Congress for passage of a humane
slaughter law. Mail to Capitol Hill has
run heavy on this subject and a number
of letters are from Alabamians.

Increased interest inthe handling of ‘

animals—«whether in the lab or at the
abattoirwreflects a growing sensitivny on
the part of many Americans. Also it
should be noted that this support of a
more merciful attitude toward animals
has been manifested in calm though real-
istic tones instead of in an atmosphere}
of self-defeating emotion. ‘

Dr. Schweitzer, now in. his 80’s, has
noticed this growing interest. He wrote
recently: “I should never have thought
that my philosophy, which embodies our
compassionate attitude toWard all crea-
tures. would. be noticed and recognized

during my lifetime.”

FOR HUMANE SLAUGHTERING
(From the Christian Sciencc~ Monitor)

'A current information report from the ~
\lmwgtéépékw recounts some begin- '
mugs of progress m improvmg the methods by
which meat animals are slaughtered in the United
States.

In Minnesota the Hormel Packing Company pass-
es hogs through a carbon dioxide gas chamber, mak-
ing them unconscious before the “sticking” proc-
ess. The Oscar Mayer Company in Wisconsin has
adopted the cative-bolt pistol which is in common
use m Europe. especially for cattle. The Seitz Pack-
mg Company in Missouri uses this instrument. in
combination with floodlights which cause the cattle
to stand still. and reports that it would not, if it
could. go back to the former sledge-hammer meth-
od of stunning the animals.
pThe National llurriane Society (Washington. D.
C.) has recently voted a grant to two large veteri-
nary schools to study the use of electric stunning
which is employed abroad. and to seek to make it
acceptable to the Department or Agriculture meat
inspection service.

More humane methods of slaughtering ccrtainlv
are to be desired. Bills now in Congress—81636
and HR BOW—would require conformation to stand-
ards already established in manv other rountries.

rutal Treatment

Of Animals Opposed

Man’s inhumanity to animals, as well as his
in umanity to man, is stirring the public-con-
science. Bestial treatment of dumb beasts is come
~ ing to be regarded as beastly.

Proof of this is to be found in the growth of
humane societies and 1ncreasing support for legis-
! lation designed to reduce cruelty to animals

, The California legislature has just passed SB

1 279, which prohibits any state agency from using

5 inhumane methods of slaughter or buying animals
killed by other than humane methods.

This extends to state agencies the mandate im-
: posed on federal agencies last year. “Humane
~ methods” are those established by the U. S. De-
partment of Agriculture under the federal law.
They render an animal insensitive to pain before

, it is shackled, hoisted, and stuck.

In its passage through the legislature, the bill
. had the support of many meat packers as well
i as that of humane societies. Packers that do not
have government contracts can be expected to
swing into line as the advantages of humane
sla aughter are demonstrated.

. CongreSs is now considering a bill to protect
wild mustangs from extinction by mechanized
hunts that 1un them to exhaustion, and by the pois-
:oning of water hol..es

Little by little, civilized man is rejecting the
gcruelties of medieval madhouses, child labor,
islavery, lynchings. sweat shops, bull fights, and
slaughter housesm-to name only a few. He 1s find-
ways to do without them. Is it too much to
lOpe he will find a way to do without the greatest
.::.ioeast1al1ty of all—war?

from the Society For the Preven-

ter Law in 19538" "M” 1......“ “.11..-.

“The law resulted in about $5
million being spent by the U. S.

 

 

slaughter methods which would
comply with the law.

 

{proved _ They are: chemical, the:
'use of carbon dioxide gas for

Three methods have been ap-

sheep and swine; mechanical, the
use 'of captive bolt stunners or
gunshot on sheep, swine, goats,
calves, cattle, - horses and mules;
“and electrical, the stunning of
swine, sheep, calves and cattle
with electric current.

Designated methods require that
the carbon dioxide gas , or electric
current be administered so as to
produce surgical anesthesia in the
animals quickly and calmly. The
.captive bolt stunners and firearms
must produce immediate and com-7
,plete unconsciousness with a min-
imum of excitement and disc-om;
fort. -In addition, the '1 animals
must also be driven to slaughter-
preparation areas with. little ex-
citement or discomfort. Areas
through which the animals are
driven must be free from hazards
that might accidentally produce
pain.

These provisions might raise the
eyebrows among old-time slaugh-
termenwand the law has caused
considerable controversy, as well
as expense. Nevertheless, the de-
signations were made after advice
and consultation with the Hu-
mane Slaughter Advisory Com-
mittee established in accordance
with the law.

If your local paper has not yet published an editorial in favor of humane

The sub-committee of the Senate Committee on Agriculture and Forestry

has just reported favorably upon the humane slaughter bill (5. 3.636) which was
sponsored by Senator Humphrey of Minnesota and upon which public hearings
were held on May 9 and 10. Favorable action by the full Senate committee is
expected soon. Humane slaughter bills are also pending in the House of Repre»
sentatives. where they were introduced by Representatives Hiestand (R) of
California and Griffiths (D) of Michigan.

Humanitarians throughout the nation are united in demanding that this

proposed legislation. which would require food animals to be humanely stunned

or anesthetized before slaughter, should be passed before Congress adjourns in
July. It must be enacted if the United States is to have standards as a humane
nation and world leader which are equal to the standards of England, Scotland.
Ireland, Holland» Switzerland. Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark. New
Zealand, Fiji, as well as parts of Austria, Germany, France and Australia.
Veteran observers in Washington state that members of Congress have
received more mail from constituents on these bills than on any other legislation
under consideration at this session. This mail is overwhelmingly in favor of
the bills. Another indication of the widespread interest in all parts of the
country is the number of newspaper editorials , feature articles and letters to
the editor which have appeared since January of this year. (A few of the editor»

SOCKETY FGR ANIE‘UEL PROTECTIVE
LEGI SLATION

13%5 Fifth Avenue

New York 22, New York

For the first time it: its history, Congress has recognized the
right: of meat animals to a! painless death. The Senate pesseo a
bill calling for a Department of Agriculture study to obtain the
use of hmne methods, and the Chairman of the House Agriculture
Committee, Harold D. Cooley (9., North Carolina) announced that
a sub-oomittse will investigate slaughter houses during the
recess and report back. so that prompt action can be taken by the
House of Representatives in the 1957 session of Congress.

Senator Hubert H. Humphrey (1)., Minnesota) and Representatives
Martha Griffiths (1)., Michigan) and Edgar Hiestand (R., California)
introduced similar messures to make humane slaughtering methods
compulsory. Hearings were conducted May 9 and 10 on the Senate
bill by Senator Humphrey, Chairman of a three men subcommittee
Composed of Senator Kat]. Mitndt (R., South Dakota), Senator W”.

Kerr Scott (1)., North Carolina) and himself. The SQb“C0§2’£7Tai.ttB£3
gave a unanimously favorable report on the measure, but the full
Agriculture Committee removed the compulsory feature to which

the packers objeoted.

Proponents of the measure demand compulsory humane slaughter
because the packing industry has been promising to adopt: himoe
methods voluntarily for over 25 years, but, to date, only two
major packers have done so. Congress has heen flooded with mail
from housewives asking that the use of painless methods of killing
calves, lambs, hogs, sheep and cattle be made compuEsory.

Most calves, sheep, lambs and
pigs are hauled up by a chain
round one hind leg and sent
struggling to the sticker who
thrusts a knife into the con-
scious animal’s throat and
leaves it to bleed to death.

THIS FEAR AND PAIN CAN BE ELIMINATED

Pigs below have been anesthetized with carbon dioxide. Animals can also be instant-

aneously stunned with mechanical instruments to avoid cruelty.

To All Humane Societies:

Humane slaughter of food animals is long overdue. The most urgent
task facing the humane movement is to obtain legislation (such as is already
in effect in.most European countries on our side of the Iron Curtain) requir-
ing that animals be made unconscious before shackling and bleeding.

With this end in view, the Humane Society of Washtenaw County has
prepared the enclosed leaflet, copies of which it is offering free on request
to individuals and organizations. The coupon below may be used to order the
number of copies which you can distribute effectively.

Humanitarians can bring an end to slaughter house cruelty by demand—
ing passage of the humane slaughter bills in this session of Congress. Let's
work together to spare millions of animals the terror and pain now being
unnecessarily inflicted on thema

Because the need for legislation to require humane methods of slaughter
for food animals is common to both Canada and the United States, we felt
that you would be interested in exchanging information. Accordingly, we
are enclosing a copy of a leaflet recently published by the Humane Society
of Washtenaw County and a letter sent to animal protective organizations

throughout the United States.

Dear Miss Draper:

mr. Harvey is out of the city and your letter of
June 19 was just called to my attention and I hasten
to reply in his behalf.

mr. Harvey's column is syndicated by General Features
Corporation, 250 Park Avenue, New York.

I think this is all the mention you would need to
make rather than listing the.many individual subscrib-
ers to the column.
Thank you for your expressed interest.
Every good wish.
Sincerely,

Dear Miss Stevens:

Thank you very much for your letter, together with various pertinent

lovers at this time.

I have taken the liberty of forwarding your letter, together with

all the contents, to my very good friend, Raymond Schroth, editorial
writer fer the Trenton Times newspapers.

Mr. Schroth is a Director of the Mercer County SPCA (honorary director,

Sincerely,

3740 Manito
Fort Wayne, Indiana
June 22, 1956

Mrs. Christine Stevens
270 Park Avenue
New York 17, New York

Dear Mrs. Stevens:

Enclosed is one copy of each of the editorials which appeared
in the two Fort Wayne papers. You may keep them. Senator
Humphrey also has one copy of each one. We still have at least
four of each of the editorials, and we purposely have them for
whatever purposes they are needed by you or the NHS.

I have written to the NHS, but still have not heard from them. I know
they are very busy, and no doubt are operating with a small staff.

I asked them if they had any suggestions for a good newspaper ad,

or a copy of a good newspaper ad. Although our treasury holds

only a little over $100, we had the thought in mind that at a critical
time in the slaughter negotiations, we would like to run an ad, having
our sights set on a full ~page ad, and see if we could get it sponsored
by business firms and private individuals. The ad would urge letters
to Washington, and tell in short to~the~point summary the need for
this legislation. So if you can help us with suggestions, we shall
appreciate them. Also, if you can keep us informed as to when would
be the best time to run the ad, we would appreciate that too. ~

I cannot promise that we would be successful in getting enough money
for the ad, but we would try. Also, we would run it in both Fort Wayne
papers.

There is one other person that I would like you to send information to,
and that is:
Mrs. Wayne Shalley
Lincoln National Life Insurance Company
(Wayne Office) i,
Fort Wayne, Indiana

/

Betty Shalley is doing humane work in Huntington, Indiana. She and Dr.
Haffner, a veterinarian, are staging a drive to form a private organization.
For several years Betty has been the only person in Huntington who has
been doing humane work. A few months ago she received an appointment
from Huntington ’s mayor to help oversee their new shelter. Betty can
later give you her home address.

 




Do you have any information on the new executive director of the
American Humane Association. Is he a good man, or is he part of
the team of indifference?

If you are ever in this area, please feel free to look up me or Sara
Hurley. You will perhaps remember Sara as the one who got up in
the convention in Grand Rapids and asked the question as to why the
AHA permitted the bull fight in Denver. (And of course got no answer,
as ”the executive director happened to be out of the room" during the
question period.)

My home phone number is Harrison 3671, and during the day I work

at the Phelps Dodge Copper Products Corp. , in Fort Wayne. Sara Hurley
(Mrs. C. H. Hurley) lives at 327 W. Taber, Fort Wayne, and her

phone number is Harrison 0697.

I just called the Fort Wayne Newspapers. The combined circulation of

the Journal Gazette and News -Sentinel is 150, 000. They estimate they
have 1/2 million readers covering northeastern Indiana, parts of son tihern
Michigan, and northwestern Ohio -- a radius of approximately 50

mil es.

When I wrote to Senator Humphrey, I gave him the circulation number
and the miles of coverage, but did not give him the number of readers.
I b;elieve this amount of 1/2 million would be of importance to him in
his promotion of the slaughter legislation (when using our editorials).

Also, in regard to the ad. We know that so few people will write in com-
parison to the number of people who will sign a petition, or sighz a form

and mail it. However, it has been impressed on us by Congressman Adair (Ind. )
that letters are very important to the Washington people. Do you believe

that if we were to have a form in our ad which people could sign and send

in that it would be absolutely overlooked, or do you think that enough of these
forms received by the Senators and Congressmen in our area would have
significance ?

We are very dissatisfied with the vague answers we are receiving from
Senator William Jenner of Indiana . He is telling nobody anything, says he
will give the bill consideration. I wrote to him again, sending literature,

and telling him that we were not satisfied with his evasive answers. Would

he definitely tell us whether or not he would be in favor of humane slaughtering
legislation.

 




-3-

His answer was that when bills are in committee, they are in one form;
and when they come out of committee they often are not recognized as
the same bill, and that he would not commit himself to any bill until it
actually was on t e ﬂoor 0 the Sena e. He did not say one word about
how he would fee a out a umane-s aughtering bill.

I still feel, however, that personal contact should be made with Senator
Jenner. It would be unthinkable to me that since he is such a fearless
fighter for what is right in America that he would vote against a good
slaughter bill. However, we believe he lives in the vicinity of Indiana
that is near Chicago. So we wonder if the packers have been talking with
him.

Senator Homer Capehart definitely states that he will vote for humane-
slaughtering legislation. We have personally talked with Congressman

E. Ross Adair, and in personal conversation with Mrs. Hurley, he
definitely states he is for it. He also comes out withthis statement in
letters to the people he knows. Senator Capehart said he has a farm and
raises arm animals and that he will vote for humane slaughtering. So far
as we now, he is tel ling this to everyone who writes to him.

I hope Miss Draper is still working with you. I enjoyed talking with her

in Grand Rapids.

Sincerely,

i /:/¢r/

RECTORY OF THE AQUARIAN NEWSLETTER
THE ROSE-CROSS AND STAR 1307 Washington Avenue
Esoteric Congregation Alexandria, Virginia
of Washington

31 May 1956

Christine Stevens
270 Park Avenue
New York 17, N.Y.

Dear friend:

Thank you for your interesting letter of may 88.
The leaflets on humane slaughter have all been distributed,
and I have been advised that members are responding with
letters to Congress. We consider it both a pleasure and an
obligation to give assistance to all humane activities on
behalf of animals.

I wish it were possible for me to advise you as
to whom you could contact by way of bringing your humane
work to the attention of the clergy. my own sphere of
influence is limited to our own ministers and congregation,
and I am afraid that it would not carry to the clergy of
the orthodox denominations. However, you may be able to
contact someone in the Council of Churches who would intro-
duce the subject to the ministers. Each city in the country
has such a Council, I believe, composed chiefly of the
representatives of the major Protestant denominations.
Perhaps the one in your vicinity would furnish you with
lists of the others affiliated with the National Council of
Churches of Christ in America. Due to preoccupation in my
own work as a minister and editor, I have not been active
in the Washington Ministerial Union for several years. The
ministers of our Church (Order) are widely scattered, and
contact is maintained largely by means of the AQUARIAN NEWS-
LETTER of which I am the editor. Our ministers are already
committed to support any humane legislation,_gppose vivi—
section, etc.

Herewith enclosed is a copy of the current issue
of our Newsletter. Our endorsement of your work appears on
page 9. In your case, I have omitted enclosing the leaflet,
but all others sent out around May 15 included the humane
slaughter leaflet. I sincerely wish that we could do much
more, but for the present this is as far as our influence
can reach. Official letters from our Church have been sent
to Congress, and others will be sent in the future.

Please believe that you have our prayers and full
cooperation in this Crusade for the merciful treatment of
“our younger brothers!" GOD BLESS YOU.

Yours in His Service,

1* .

The letter published in the
June 7 issue of The \l'oshmgtma

Post and Times Herald, signed,

by Mrs. Paul A. Chadwell, to
gether with an editorial in a
recent issue, prompts us to pre-
sent amiably, and without being
contentions, a few facts with
which Mrs. Chadwell and the
writtcr of your editorial may
not be iamiliar.

Both the letter and the edi—
torial seem to make it appear
that cruelty is general practice
in the meat packing industry
and that this industry is devoid
of what is termed a humani-
tarian attitude. Neither of these
implications is justiﬁed or true.
Both simply represent state-
ments—~some quite ﬁctional—-
made by people who have
drawn heavily on their imagina-
tions. It is quite easy for this
to happen. since an emotional
aspect is involved. Let us em-
phasize that this is not said
critically. _

Both the letter and the ed1-
torial make it appear that meat
packers are opposed to humane
slaughter legislation. The fact
is that the industry is not op-
posed to humane slaughter
methods. We heartily approve
'of them and we have spent
much effort and much money in
trying to ﬁnd ways to improve
methods, which basically have
come down through the cen-
turies.

But we do not believe that
legislation of a compulsory and
dictatorial nature, which can-
not be complied with by every-
body, offers an answer to a
problem which is the cause of
great concern within our own
industry. And this has been
true for some years. However,
we are dealing with the ending
of life: and the ending of life
of anything never is pleasant.
It cannot be made so.

The meat packing industry is

Animal Slaughter

using the most humane meth-
nds it knows of. For some years
it has been harmoniously work-
ing, along with the long—estab-
lished American Humane Asso-
ciation and the Massachusetts
Society for the Prevention hf
Cruelty to Animals, in trying
to ﬁnd ways of improving
methods and at the same time
having regard for religious rit~
uals in the case of cattle and
sheep.

Some methods tried have
proved to be quite impracti-
cable—for example, the render-
ing insensible of cattle or hogs
by electrical shock. This either
spoils the meat or prevents
inspectors from determining
whether or not the animals will
produce wholesome meat suit—
able for human consumption.

Inspection in Europe, fre-
quently referred to, does not
approach the thoroughness of-
inspection in the United States.
For example, we do not know
of any country in Eumpe where
lung inspection is in vogue as
it is in meat packing plants in
this country. It is this lung
inspection which develops dif-
ﬁculties in connection with dis-
patching of hogs by electrical
shock. In cattle. electrical shock
damages the meat and is not
as humane as some people may
think. That‘s why we do not
use it.

The meat packing industry

'firmly believes that the dis-

patching of meat animals
should be just as humane and
painless as possible. We, of
course, have a selfish interest
in this because valuable prop
erty is involved. This value is
depreciated, in the meat, if the
animals from which it is de-
rived have not been humanely
handled all along the line.
Also, meat packers and the
many thousands of workers in
the industry happen to be hu-
man beings who are quite as

<th WASHINGTON POST, June 19 , 19§6

much interested as other peo-
ple in the humane treatment of
animals of all kinds. As a mat-
ter of fact. they probably are
more interested than most peo-
ple because they come into con-
tact with these “animals every
day. It might ‘be conceded, too,
that meat packers, and the
thousands of workers in the in-
dustry, are not sadists or
monsters.

Our feeling is that when we
find practical methods which
actually by scientific and tech-
nical research are known to be
more humane and which can
be used by all it will be a very
easy matter to have these gen-
erally adopted. But we do not
believe that compulsory, dicta-
torial legislation, requ i rin g
meat packers to do something
which they cannot do or which
may be impracticable, or which
may not be the thing to do at
all, can ever take the place of
results which may be expected
from scientific and technical re-
search. This we are working on.
And we shall find the answers,
if answers can be found.

In fact. the industry right
now is testing a new device—-
to take the place of the ham-
mer—for use in connection with
the dispatching of cattle. This
was developed from a sugges-
tion by the American Humane
Association and the Massachu-
setts Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals. It has
promise and we hope that it
may lead to improved opera-
tions in cattle-dressing depart-
ments. But this is not the result
of compulsory and dictatorial
legislation. It is easy to say--
but highly technical problems
cannot be solved by the simple
saying of “there ought to be a.
law.”

THE NEW AGE REVIVAL OF TEMPLE DANCING

In the coming Aquarian Age, many of the teachings and
practices of the Ancient Wisdom will again become popular.
An important aspect of religious training, long forgotten
or neglected in the Western World, is the sacred art of
temple dancing. Traces of this ancient art have been re-
tained in modern religious ceremonials, and these may
still be observed in the choir processions and altar rites
of some of the present churches. But the original rhythmic
and vibrational quality of these rituals has virtually
been lost. As the New.Age dawns, and a new interpretation
0f Christianity restores the basic truths of the Ancient
Wisdom, the present crystalized ceremonials will be re-
Vitalized to meet the demands of a spiritually re-awakened
humanity.

A portent of the future may be seen among those pro—
gressive groups and churches which are even now inaugura—
ting a revival of temple dancing. The Lord's Prayer, and
certain of the Psalms, already set to music, are now being
performed in public by religious dancers.

From the Occult viewpoint, religious dancing has a far
reaching effect upon both the participants and observers.
For the observer, it is a symbolic portrayal of Divine
Realities transcending sectarian interpretation, which
Stimulates and elevates his thoughts and emotions. For .
the Performer, it is a powerful means of attaining certain
Spiritual results along lines of esoteric development-

Every particle of matter in the universe, from.atoms to
star galaxies, is in constant motion. This motion is sys-
tematic and rhythmicalo It is the rhythmic motion of the
Earth which keeps it in its proper balance with the other
planets of our solar system» It is rhythmic motion which
produces the ocean tides, the changes of the seasons and
the alternation between day and night» NOTHING IN THE
UNIVERSE IS STATIC - ALL IS MOTION - AND RHYTHM! It is
not an over—statement to say that HARMONIOUS MOTION is the
Law of Life. -

Behind the visible phenomena of the universe, and its
rhythmic motions, are innumerable spiritual Beings, among
which are the Solar and Planetary Spiritso Long ago,
religious dancing was instituted by the Hierarchies in
charge of human evolution, as a means of helping man to
retain consciousness of the spiritual side of the universe
and, thereby, to understand the workings of Divine Lawo
By attuning himself to the Cosmic rhythms, he could keep
in conSCious touch with the Invisible Worlds from which
he had come. But as this art was gradually abandoned, he
lost contact with the spiritual universe, and with the
great Beings who guide our world through time and space.

The time has now come for man to regain his lost Spiri‘
tual Perception. As the New Age dawns, the sacred arts of

THE DEEPER PURPOSE OF CEREMON IAL FORM .

When a person becomes interested in the teachings of
Occultism, he usually renounces the dogmas and ritualistic
forms of orthodox religion. Those doctrines which he had
previously accepted without question, are now challenged
by his awakened intellect. The ceremonial form of worship
becomes ameaningless pageantry -- an archaic superstition,
to be abandoned by the truth seeker as he throws off the
Yoke of creed and denomination. His books now become his
altar, and knowledge -— his high priest.

This is all well and good, so long as the aspirant is
attuned to the Lesser Mysteries. For him, at this stage,
KNOWLEDGE and WORKS are enough. But in the course of time
he discovers the need for another type of experience --
an.lllmnination of the heart! He now finds that the ac-
quu’lng of knowledge (even though demonstrated by works)
1:? no longer satisfy his growing hunger for love and
itauty. The heart now asserts its rightful claim to equal—
"elll’lpzlth the mind. Religious ritual, once abandoned as an
expo y form," now becomes a meaningful and satisfying
thatrlence to the soul. Indeed, the aspirant now discovers
lie tceremonial form 13, in reality, the veil behind which

he GREATER MYSTERIES - the "Unspeakables" - which can

38"” be comprehended by the intellect unless united with
he heart.

The aspirant will now complete the first cycle of his
development, the first half of which was predominantly in—
tellectual, while the second half is devotional. Through
the blending of reason and devotion, he will at last begin
the second cycle of attainment, by passing through the
portal formed by the equilibrium of the mind and heart.
Astrologically, when a pioneering individual has experienc-
ed both the AQUARIUS (mind) and the LEO (heart) phases of
the coming Age of Enlightenment, he is then ready for
INNER PLANE INITIATION. The first cycle — the Preparatory
Work, has then been completed, and the second cycle ~ the
Initiatory Work, now begins.

Thus it will be seen that both TEACHINGS AND CEREMDNIALS
play an important part in the preparatory work of the as—
pirant who seeks to unite the mind and the heart, and,
thereby, to attain spiritual illumination.

 

THE ORDER OF SAINT JOHN

Each of the four Schools of Initiation, represented by
the four Gospels, is attuned to one of the four Sacred
Seasons. The Order of Saint John is especially attuned to
the Season of the Ascension ~ the Summer Solstice. Saint
John’s Order is the WATER SCHOOL of the GREATER MWSTERIES.
Its keynote is found in the Eagle Aspect of Scorpio, and
its celestial Patron is the Archangel Uriel, who presides
over the Summer Solstice. The Work of this Order is pri—
marily concerned with the transmutation of human desire
into pure Love. The devotional forms of the Churches are
the veil behind which this Mystical Order initiates Illur
mdned souls into the Communion of Saints.

In the September issue of this Newsletter, we will in-
terpret the Work of the Hermetic Order as attuned to the
Autumn Equinox. At each of the four Sacred Seasons, the
'Work of a corresponding Mystery School will be explained
in this Newsletter. For a complete tabulation of the

A TRUE EXPERIENCE
by L. So

On Marchﬁlhth, I was in San Francisco on a visit. For
a week I had been enjoying the balmy air and sunshine, so
different from our eastern climate. After spending the
day on Catalina Island,_I returned to my hotel toffind
letters from home awaiting me. “All in the family were
well,“ but they were not enthusiastic over the heavy fall
of snow that was blanketing'washington. They were glad I
was out of it, and that Spring would have come before my
return.

As it had been a rather exhausting day, I retired early.
I decided to revisit the Huntington Art Gallery the follow-
ing day, not only because it contained world renowned
originals, including the “Blue Boy", but I wished to walk 3
again between the gigantic Live Oaks surrounding the Gallery.
They made a scene worthy of Carot. Thinking of them, I
drifted off to sleep.

Out of a void, I suddenly found myself in a hospital
room in Washington. My dear daughter—in—law, Betty, was
on the bed, semi~conscious. As I stood beside her wonder—
ing if she would live, her eyes opened wide; "Oh mother,"
she cried, “don't look so sad, I am aliveX"

Then I found myself sitting up in bed in my room.in San
Francisco. My face was drenched with tears. Hurriedly I
began to pack, not stopping to wire home for confirmation
Of my vision — for I simply KNEW it was true. I caught an
early train for the East. " -

'When I made my unexpected appearance at home,uny'daugh—
ter was busily plying two babies with bottles, her little
son and Betty‘s baby girls. Upstairs, Betty's two year
01d boy was roaring for attention. Betty was in the hos-
Pital and an emergency operation had been performed. I
went immediately to the hospital. As I entered her room
Betty exclaimed, "0h mother, I knew you would comet You
‘were with me when I came out of the anesthetic. 'You stood
right beside me, and your eyes were as large as saucers.

I told you not to cry, that I would get well."

The date and hour were the same!

A. PLEA FOR MERCY 7”

Enclosed with this issue of The Aquarian Newsletter is
a pamphlet which is self-explanatory. 'We wish that it was
not necessary to bring this unpleasant subject to the at-
tention of our readers, but conscience will not allow us
to do otherwise. It is a plea for mercy! The unnecessary
brutality employed in the slaughter of animals in meat
packing houses can be eliminated through humane legislation.
If each one of us will sit down and write a letter to our
Senators and Congressmen, urging that such legislation be
enacted without delay, we can help to bring an end to the
suffering of animals caused by the perverted appetites of
men. Perhaps we cannot ALL become vegetarians during this
earthlife, but we can at least demonstrate some of the
finer qualities of compasSion and mercy.

Won't you please write to your Senators and Congressmen
today, asking their support of Bills now pending in the
United States Senate and House of Representatives to re-
quire humane methods of slaughter? Let’s do it now, before
we forget! The Senate Bill is So 1636, and the Heuse Bill
is H.R. 8540. This is an opportunity for SERVICE which is
shared by each of our subscribers. Let us be'WORTHY to

THE DIVINE WISDOM TEACHINGS
-—-—EJH--

HOW Good Overcomes Evil Lesson Number Eight

It is a truism, that the brighter the light — the dark-
er the shadow. The increase of good inevitably brings the
opposing evil into sharper contrast. ‘Whenever an aspirant
endeavors tO'walk the Path of the Higher Life, he experi-
ences an increased opposition from.negative forces both
visible and invisible. Therefore, as Saint Paul advises,
he must learn to "pray without ceasing," and to “put on the

»full armor of Light." Thus protected, he can walk unafraid

among both Angels and Lucifers, for the Hand of the Al»
mighty is upon him.

The following scientific method of protective prayer
(or concentration) is from.an old Rosicrucian books It is
called THE PROTECTIVE AURA.

“Rosicrucian teachers instruct their pupils in regard to
maintaining the 9Protective Aura', which is a shelter of
soul, mind and body against evil influences directed toward
them consciously or unconsciously. This Protective Aura
affords a simple but very powerful and efficient means of
protection against all adverse psychic influences, 9mali-
cious mental magnetism,’ black magic, etc., and is also
an effective armor against psychic vampirism, or the drain—
ing of magnetic strength.

“Forming the Protective Aura is very simple. It con-
sists merely of the formation of a mental image (accompan—
ied by a demand of the will) of yourself being surrounded
by an aura of pure, clear white Light -- the symbol and
indication of SPIRIT. A little practice will enable you
actually to feel the presence and power of this Protective
Aura. The White LIGHT is the radiation of SPIRIT, and
SPIRIT is master of all things.

"A teacher has said: iThe highest and deepest occult
teaching is that the white LIGHT must never be used for
attack, or for personal gain —— but that it may properly
be employed by anyone, at any time, to protect himself or
herself against adverse psychic influences, no matter by
whom.exertedo‘ It is the armor of the SPIRIT, and may be

employed in such manner whenever or wherever the need
arises."

In the Legend of the Manichean Order, the method by
which good overcomes evil is shown in symbolic form. The
following is quoted from.pages h18 and 419 of The Rosi-
crucian Cosmo—Conception, by Max Heindel: "In the legend
of the Manichees there are two kingdoms — that of the‘
Light Elves and that of the Night Elves. The latter ate
tack the former, are defeated and must be punished. But,
as the Light Elves are as thoroughly good as the Night
Elves are bad, they cannot inflict evil upon their foes, ;;‘
so they must be punished with good. Therefore, a part of
the kingdom.of the Light Elves is incorporated with that
of the Night Elves and in this way the evil is in time
overcome. Hate which will not submit to hate, must suc-
cumb to Love."

From the Office of
Senator Hubert H. Humphrey For Release: Sunday
Mo Senate Office Building April 15, 1956
Washington 25, D.C.
NAtional 8-3l20, Ext. 881
HUMANE SLAUGHTEB HEARINGS CALLEDVDURING 'BE KIND_TO ANIMALS WEEK:

Hearings on humane slaughter legislation will be held by a Senate subcommittex
May 9 and 10, during ”Be Kind to Animals Week", Senator Hubert H. Humphrey announ-
ced yesterday.

Senator Humphrey is Chairman of the subcommittee, of the Senate Committee on
Agriculture and Forestry, to which the humane slaughter bill has been referred, and
is the author and sponsor of the legislation.

The bill is backed by the American Humane Association, the National Humane
Society and other humane groups throughout the country.

It would require slaughter houses to render animals and poultry unconscious
and insensible to pain before slaughter, with provisions protecting any religious
practices in connection with slaughtering.

”Unfortunate cruelty exists in our slaughter houses that should be eliminated,

Senator Humphrey declared. ”The slaughter industry of Britain, the Scandinavian

countries, and in fact all the nations of Europe have for some time immoblized

and made insensible to pain all animals before slaughter. There is no reasonfor
Europe to be so far advanced over the United States in humane methods of slaughter.

“When I introduced this legislation a year ago, it was my hope that it would
stimulate voluntary acceptance of humane methods by more of the nation's packing
'"industry. However, it now appears some form of compulsion is necessary to obtain
the reforms needed.”

Senator Humphrey said he was ”going ahead” with action despite the opposition
of the Eisenhower administration.

"Great progress has been made in development of practical methods of humane
slaughter, and now seems the opportune time to bring the slaughter industry of this
country up to the European standards of humanity," he declared.

Senator Humphrey said he thought it was ”appropriate” to hold hearings on the
“measure, S. 1636, during the nation's observance of ”Be Kind to Animals Week”.

Senator Humphrey said thousands of people throughout the country had written

"members of Congress uring action on the humane slaughter legislation.

June 19, 1956

Dear Mrs. Stevens:

Thank you for your note and the
material on humane methods of slaughter. I shall
champion your cause at our next editorial staff
meeting.

lnformatively, it is our custom to go
into the pros and cons of various issues, usually
with a self-appointed devil’s advocate, and out of
such discussions come decisions.

Since this meeting will occur next
Tuesday morning at 10 o’clock it might be well for
you to place in my hands additional information, as
you suggested. I am particularly concerned with
the arguments of the opposition and how to refute
them.

Mrs. Mc Cabe and I both very much
enjoyed meeting you and Mr. Stevens.

Sincerely yours,

ﬂm. 255%

Mrs. Christine Stevens

AN OPEN LETTER TO EDITORS OF MAJOR NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES, .
AND TO TELEVISION AND RADIO NEWS COMMENTATORS.

Dear Sirs:

A month ago (April 1956), a horse stranded in snows in Colorado, received
national publicity, and the public voluntarily contributed sums sufficient
for two expeditions to rescue him.from death by starvation.

That the American public could worry about one helpless animal to this ex—
tent, seemed merely another heartening evidence of the basic principles of
Americanism at work-- help for and defense of any living creature whether
it be man or animal.

It is therefore horrifying to learn that hundreds of thousands of Americans
are employed (or employ others) in the unnecessary, incredible torture of
animals in our slaughter houses yearly. As more facts were uncovered,
shock in the writer turned to actual physical illness -- a physical illness
which has been eXperienced by men as well as women merely on learning of
these facts.

I grant you, sir, that you will not endear your readers (or listeners) by
making them sick, and this must‘be one of the reasons why every major maga-
zine, newspaper and commentator has not brought to the people the facts
concerning conditions in our slaughterhouses-- Conditions which have exist-
ed unchanged since 1910!

Many know, of course, that there is pending bill 8-1636 for a Federal humane
slaughter law. But the American people will not act fast enough nor in
large enough numbers by writing‘washington unless they are informed of the
facts behind this proposed law.

Senator Hubert H. Humphrey stated at the humane slaughter hearing‘May 9,

1956: "Whenever we shut our eyes to cruelty and suffering whether among
people or among animals, we are shutting out part of the spirit that has

made America great and MAKES US STAED APART IN THE‘WORLD AS A.NATION THAT
PUTS MORAL VALUES AND DECENCY ABOVE SHEER MATERIAL VALUE." And yet, sir,

WE DO NOT STAND APART BUT LAG BEHIND for humane slaughter laws have been ~

in effect in other countries since the following dates: Switzerland 187D;
Netherlands 1920; Norway l92h; Scotland 1928; Ireland 1932; England 1933;
Finland l93h; Sweden 1937; Fiji 1 he; New Zealand 1951; and parts of France,
Germany, Austria and Australia have also enacted humane slaughter legislation.

 

It is understood that Secretary of Agriculture Ezra Benson and others oppose
this bill on the grounds that there should be no compulsion in free enter-
prise, and also that (here follows the emote from amimeographed release sent
out by the Department of Agr131lture in answer to letters on bill 5-1636):
"Continued progress in this field consistent with practical objectives can
best be accomplished by private initiative and individual ingenuity'in the
traditional American manner."

In answer to the above:

(1) That.. "there should be no compulsion in free enterprise" is a basic prin-
ciple.. BUT, when free enterprise has interpreted and used that freedom to
torture helpless, living creatures for decades, then indeed it has lost the
right to that freedom and must be forced by law to do the decent thing.

   
    
    
      
   
 
      

(2) "....continued progress in this field...." is simply a falsity of state-
ment as there has been no progress in conditions in the slaughter houses
since 1910, and furthermore, promises made in the 20's to better these con-
ditions have not been kept.

 
 

(3)"....consistent with practical objectives" ....hwmane slaughter has been
i} proven PRACTICAL in its application in all the countries and for all the many
* years already outlined in paragraph 6.




WWW-v P3362

(h) "unmask“ can best be accomplished by private initiative and in-
dividual ingenuity in the traditional Merican manner.“ I object first
that objectives can best and most effectively be accomplished by the men
put in positions of trust in our government for the very purpose of enact-
in : laws to maintain our basic principles of decency. But when they fail
to do so, then I agree that “in the traditional American manner", "private
initiative and individual ingenuity“ will take up the work.

Therefore, since Secretary Benson has dropped this issue directly into 1w
lap, I state that I AM NOT IN THE MID! OF AN! INDIVIDUAL OR ORGANIZATION
TEVER BU ABANDONED HIS mm: to fight in defense of
rbears on both sides of my family
country, in the making of its laws,
and in the fighting of every major war since the Revolution. THIS LETTER
IS MY FIRST STEP IN THIS FIGHT.

LASTLY, THIS ISSUE GOES BEYOND THAT OF THE PROTECTION OF MPLFSS LIVINQ
CREATURES and goes straight to the heart of the threat of a viciousness is!
thinking and a callousness of spirit (so recently admitted even by the Com--
munists themselves in the liquidation of Stalinism) which will torture hu-
man beings for political gain. FOR IT IS A SHORT STEP FROM ONE BHJTALITY
TO ANOTHER-— a short step from the callous mind and spirit which will tor.-
ture animals for monetary gain-- to that state of mind which tortures human
beings for" political ends. ‘

Sincerely yours,

19 East 76 Street, Eleanor Beeson.

A an: FACTS SUCH as:
How CATTLE cm KILLED

A man who is called a "knocker" stands alongside the pen on a slightly rais-
ed platform. He uses a long-handled hammer to knock the animal to the floor.
If the knocker is expert, and lands his blow squarely at the proper spot on
the head, he knocks the animal down with one blow. Knockers however, are
by no means always expert. THE Hm}! SOMTIMES KNOCKS OUT AN EYE, 0R .
SMASHES THE NOSE TO BLOODY PULP, OR SPLINTEES A HORN. There is more, but
suffice it to say this is ORDINARY ROUTINE and 20 million cattle went through
this process in American slaughterhouses.

A U. S. Department of Agriculture inspector who has worked in many packing
plants in the last 25 years wrote about the plant where he is now stationed:
"When calves are slaughtered they are stunned with a hammer; sometimes not
completely stunned. They are shackled and pulled up to an overhead rail and
bled. Sometimes the hind feet are skinned out and cut off while the animal
g still alive and tﬁey come out He floor By a mom'g chain still E5492-

THIS WAS NOT AN IMMIONAL LAYMAN SPEAKING. IT WAS A MAN WHO HAS WORKED IN
SLAIBIHERHOUSES FOR A QUARTER OF A CENTURY.

This same man wrote: "I have seen cattle which were knocked with the ham-
mer and rolled out onto the floor and hung up for bleeding after sticking,
and the header startedto skin out the head while the animal was still aligg
and was rying o e 931.

This same man also wrote: "I have seen hogs that have been scalded and Lug
through the de-hairing machine sti'II show signs of I118.
There is a motion picture with soundtrack of the slaughter of pigs which
you may see. There are many additional facts if you wish them.

ANSWER

Excerpts.rvom &;an5wers to Norman Draper's (Public Re-
lations Director, American Meat Institute) letter to the
-New York Times, June 5, 1956.

"A pig will squeal if you pick him up even to pet him. To
make it appear that these sounds (from slaughterhouses)
are evidence of “agony" or "cruelty" is intemperate to
say the least." .

Mr. Editor, look.at a film available to you or your
reporter, or visit a slaughterhouse, and answer yourself
whether these sounds are from mere handling or are cries
of "agony" from "cruelty".

"The meat industry is not opposed to humans slaughter.“
Then why do they not use it since humane slaughter has
been used and PROVFN PRACTICAL in 8 other countries for
decades! (ﬁlease see enclosed OPVN LTTTER TO EDITORS
for details)

concerning .."religious rituals.."

The Jewish ritual demands are respected and taken care

of in bill S«1636. To say this is not enough.but that

.ALL meat should come to us slaughtered in a way which is
abhorrent to millions, is to IMPOSE THE RELIGIOUS PRACTICES
OF ONE GROUP ON ALL...a totally un~American concept..and
one to which the Jews certainly would not concur.

"Electrical shock impractical for cattle or hogs.”
This can be argued. But why argue? Let them use instead
carbon dioxide tunnels and/or the captive bolt pistol.

"The position of the meat industry is that everything
pessible should be done (and we are doing everything we
know of."

Is it possible the industry is so ignorant as to not know
of humane slaughter methods in use in 14 other countries?

"Packers and their workers are notsadists or monsters."
For this answer, I should like any reliable psychiatrist
to state what scientific term he would use to describe
any man or group of men who would torture animals for
decades with the stove? THAT TWVY COULD NOT USE PRESENT
HUMAN? MVTVODS BVGAUS? MAYBE SOME DAY THEY WOULD FIND
BFTTER ONES”!

Mr. Lee Hills

Detroit 26, Michigan

Dear Lee:

gor some time I have been actively interested in Humane
ociety'work, particularly in a project sponsored by
the wife of my partner, Mrs. Roger L. Stevens, of the
Animal Welfare Institute. The Institute interests itself
primarily with the humane treatment of animals in research
centers and, for the past year or so, the Institute has
been particularly active in promoting federal legislation
covering the humane slaughtering of animals.

It is astounding that in this day and age in.America a
most cruel and inhuman practice of allowing animals to
suffer needlessly while they are being slaughtered is
permitted. '

There is pending in the Senate Bill 8.1636, which has been
designed to make mandatory in the United States basic
humane treatment of such animals. I am.writing you with
the hope that your Editorial Staff will interest itself

in this matter, and give it publicity in the form of an
editorial such as was run in the'HASHINGTON POST and

THE ANN ARBOR NEWS, capies of which I am attaching.

Sincerely,

ed R. Glen , Jr.

Austin, Minnesota. Stunning of poul-
try with an electric knife has been ap-
proved by the Department ongriculture
and aiready is being extensively used.
The old captive bolt pistol in place of
the poleaxe is acceptable to many pack-
are.

Now a new stunning weapon which
does not penetrate the skull has been

developed by Remington Arms Company
in cooperation with Mr. John Macfarlam
of the Massachusetts SPCA, TheAmeri-
can Humane Association and the Ameri- ;

can Meat Institute. This cooperative
effort has resulted in general approval

of the new weapon by many large pack- ;,

are affiliated with the American Meat

Institute (whose members process near-
ly 90 per centof the commercial meat
in this country), and assurance that they
will put the new weapon into use as soon i

as it is available. Remington says the

weapon will be in production this year. 5

Work Needed Now
With Local Packers

The proposed federal legislation
will not cover meat packers and poul-
try processors who do not sell outside
their own states. Therefore, a con-
tinuing educational program for hu~
mane slaughtering is necessary. The
American Humane Association will
work with its affiliated local and state

societies to demonstrate to local pack—-
are that the improved methods of
slaughter now available are more ef»
ficient as well as more humane. It
eventually it is found that state legis-
lation for humane slaughter is neces-
sary, The American Humane Associa
ation will assist itsaffiliated societies
in promoting such legislation.

Do This Now!

Write to your Senator and Congress.»-
m an and ask them to support Bill
81636 for humane slaughter. Write
to the Secretary of Agriculture and
urge his approvaltoo. Then work with
your local humane society to get hu-
mane slaughtering adopted by local
packers not covered by the federal
legislation.

The AHA

Takes A Firm Stand
on

Humane Slaughtering

Points in The American Humane As-
s ocia ti on ' 5 Program on Humane
Slaughter:

l. A sufficient number of satisfac-
tory devices now are available to make
humane slaughtering practical.

2. Through COOperation with the
Meat Industry, a large number of lead-n
ing packers now are ready to put these
devices into use without waiting for
compulsory legislation.

 




3. Le g i 5 la ti on nevertheless is
necessary to take care of recalcitrant
packers, and that every effort should
he made to get such legislation passed
by the United States Congress this
year.

4. Continued cooperation with pack-
ers and a nationwide educationalpro—
gram on humane slaughter are need-
ed - even after the passage of federal
legislation.

AHA Has Always Sought

Humane Slaughtering

For a great many years, The Amer-
ican Humane Association has been
concerned with the cruelslaughtering
methods used by most meat packers
and poultry processors.

» . The bawling of frightened cattle
severely injured by a missed aim of
the axeman; screaming hogs shackled
by one leg often breaking the hipjoint,
stuck while thus hanging alive and
slowly bleeding to death; poultry jerk-
ed from crates, stuck through the
mouth, also dying by slow bleeding
--- these are a few of the horrors of
the slaughter house.

These inhumanities demand correc-
tion. Every humane person wants to
see them corrected.

AHA Introduced Legislation

For Humane Slaughtering

Last year, through efforts of The
American Humane As sociation, Senator
Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota met the
issue by introducing Senate Bill 1636,
"to require the use of humane methods
in the slaughter of livestock and poultry
in interstate or foreign commerce, and
for other purposes. " '

Unhappily this Bill was held up after
it received an adverse report from the
Secretary of Agriculture. But the Bill
did not die. It was kept alive in Com-
mittee. There is great hope that it can
be passed this year.

Subsequently, s o m e w ha t similar
Bills have been introduced in the House
ofRepresentatives. They all have good
intent.

There has been agreementto amend
the original Senate Bill 1636 so that it
will become effective in two years
(rather than five years) and allowing
the Secretary of Agriculture to grant
9.9.? more than one additional year of
leeway for good cause. This will make
Senate Bill 1636 definitely the strong-
est of all the proposed Bills. The
American Humane Association favors
Senate Bill 1636. The American Hu-
mane Association has sent letters to
every member of Congress in behalf
of a humane slaughtering law. '

Humane Methods
Are Now Available

In the past, many sincere slaught-
erers said, "Show us a better method
and we will use it." That was the
stumbling block for a long time. For
general acceptance, \ im pr oven methods
of slaughter had to be not only humans
but also efficient, practical and econ-
omically sound.

Electrical stunning of. livestock gave
promise for a time, until it was dis-
covered that the electrical shock ire-
sulted in the bursting of blood. vessels
in cattle and lesions in the lungs at.
hogs which were indistinguishable {rem
lesions due to early sta gee of disease.
The Meat Inspection Branch otthe ii.
S. Department of Agriculture turned
thumbs down.

On thebasis of early research, some
European countries adopted legi sla tion
for electrical slaughtering. An inch»
cation that this legislation may have
been premature is seen in the factthat
D en m a r k already has rescinded its
law. .

But now the United States is ready
for legislation because several practi-
cal humane methods of slaughter have
been developed. Immobilising ofhogs
by exposing them to carbon dioxide gas
has been used successfully for three
year s by the Hormel Company of

Meat packing is an 11 billion dollar industry.

To an outsider with enen a cursory familiarity with continuing methods of imrpwement
in 1331 otherinduetriea, it is inconceivable that the neat packer 8 still taker-ate
ah archaic system which jeopardizes its workers, hnparie its product and penalizes
its stookholdere. ' A x
me

On the killing floor of one of the largestof the big Five packers, I recently saw
four frantic hogs admitted into ,the shackling pen at one time. While they trampled
each other 1113 mad effort to escape, the shackler fastened the chain on the hind leg of
one animal which mammarily yanked ups ide down out of the melee by the inexorable convey
or chain. I’naomo h as some 600 pounds of struggling hogs werehodling the

 




anizrql down Mail; the chain hauled it aloft. I can t understand why 1&3 leg
didn 13 come out of its socket. But, having seen that repeated time and again,
I can understand why they have so many hm. bruises. ‘

In the is; .s A: plant of one of the three largest packer I saw three cattle admﬁtted

for keeps. Yonm can imagine the market. value of the skull after that brutal performance.

4500 QUE LANE, N. \X/.
WASHINGTON 7, D. C..

August 2, 1956
Dear Christine:

The attached story on Chris tine Stevens in the Congressional Record
may be of interest 1 ’

I called Martha Griffiths' attention to the story and she very kindly
put it into the Record. It is good for Congress to know about you and
your work ..

Good to see the bﬁloetes' letter in the Times. Enclosing similar
letter fume the Post. Glad to see you take the tact that Senate now
on record that slaughter treatment is not humane.

I hope there will be lots of grass roots educational work on the
need for humane slaughter during the interval between sessions. I am
lining up peopleto writes stories and columns when the bill comes
up again. Sent 1iﬁalvina Lindsay of the Post some of your leaflets as
she is much interested.

I have no idea whether Walt Disney would show any interest or? not,
but do you think it would be worthwhile to get in touch with him. A
letter from him to the packers, or a public statement, would do worlds
of good.

But first, Christine, you would have to point out to him that his
own TV sponsor for the Wednesday night Disneyland show is Swifts Meats!
(A letter or a word from a group like yours might make him feel most
uncomfortable.) Honestly, it is hard to believe that a man who has
made animals so appealing could have such a blind spot about what
happens to real animals.

But it may be exactly that -- blind spot, lack of knowledge that
eorditions can be improved etc. Once acquainted with the horribh
conditions and the efforts that are being made to improve the situation,
you might end up with him as an ally. Eaaybe, of course, you and Ears.
Bemelmans have already tried him, but thougit I'd mention him anyhow.

When his House A riculture Committee sends a committee out to
visit slaughter houses do you think it will?) I hope that some
photographs of actual slaughter can be taken. . It might be a good idea
to send a photographer along to a few of tha houses. A few pictures
in humane literature should have a galvanizing effect on people who
see them. Just that one shot you have with your "Hormel" pigs ( of the
calf) is very effective.

The packet of materials arrived today. Thank you so much for
sending them. They look so well done and I look forward to reading

1956‘-

agreement that, as the report states:
Attempts to restriCt watch imports ‘ * ‘

‘ are likely to have undesirable side effects on

our worldwide trade relations and hence on
national security far beyond any narrow gain
in domestic watch production. ,

As a good example of the newspaper

reports on this well-reasoned subcom-
‘mittee report, I ask that the text of a
column which appeared in the New York
World-Telegram and Sun, on July 23,
1956, be reprinted in the RECORD. It was
.any written by Scripps-Howard staff
'writer Douglas Smith:
CONGRESS UNIT WOULD EASE WATCH TARIFFS
(By ‘Douglas Smith)
WASHINGTON, July 23.———There should be no
more barriers against the importation of
watches, a congressional committee has de-
clared. " ,
The Joint Economic Committee, of which
Senator PAUL DOUGLAS (Democrat, Illinois)
~ is chairman,
watches 2 years ago did not improve the
relative position of American watchmakers.
The committee’s report is based on an
investigation conducted by a subcommittee

headed by Representative RICHARD BOLLING.

(Democrat, Missouri). .

But this: is only one more round in the
perennial battle over watch tariffs. ,

The President can restrict watch imports
without the approval of Congress if he con-
siders it necessary to advance the national
defense. The Ofﬁce of Defense Mobilization
now has a committee studying whether to'
recommend such action to the White House.

An ODM committee recommendation
cansed the President to increase the tariff

on jeweled watches by 50 percent in 1954. '

The new congressional committee report sug-
gests that recommendation was “dominated
by domestic commercial considerations
rather than either defense needs or foreign
policy effects.”
American jeweled watch manufacturers
would prefer import quotas on their foreign
(Swiss) competition, because even a sub-
stantial tariff increase might not do them
much good.» The one of 2 years ago helped
them little, because the Swiss are able to
make‘ﬂne watches much more cheaply than
American ﬁrms.) ,
' The American companies also are engaged
in high-precision defense work for which
they claim their watchmakers are a unique
and highly essential pool of skills.

' The congressional committee considered
the plant-conversion idea old-fashioned,
however. It said “it is safest to assume that
never again will we have time to convert our
industry over a period of years from a peace.-
ful orientation-to a military one."

Mrs. ROGERS of Massachusetts. Mr.

Miss Cranberries had a natural straw.

’ladies’ hand basket ornamented with a bunch

of cranberries for both Mrs. ROGERS and Mrs.
Donald Nicholson,“ wife of the Congressman
from Wareham, Mass, where the biggest
cranberry producers come from. EDITH
ROGERS was so delighted with her basket, she
promised to wave it on the ﬂoor of the House,
but I couldn’t wait to see what interesting
effect this gesture might have on her col-
leagues.

Inside the dining room cranberry sauce re—
posed on every table, together with a ditty
intended to overcome that American con-
viction that cranberry sauce was meant for
Thanksgivingturkey and nothing else.

The ditty read:

“It’s the berries, and there’s a reason.
For cranberry sauce knows no season,” etc.

“It’s yours in winter, yours in spring;
It’s sauce for a goose or sauce for a king."

That last line was so ﬂattering House
Members got into the spirit of things and
helped reduce the cranberry sauce surplus
for 1956. Besides, it was free.

EXTENSION OF REMARKS

HGN. MARTHA W. GRIFFHTHS

OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 26, 1956

Mrs. GRIFFITHS. Mr. Speaker, under
leave to extend my remarks in the REC-
0RD, I want to insert an article by Ann
Cottrell Free of the North American
Newspaper Alliance on. Mrs. Christine
Stevens: --

(By Ann C‘ottrell Free)

WASHINGTON.—A most extraordinary wom-
an, whose pursuits could be those of the idle
rich, is here—pursuing, instead, passage of
a law to banish pain and terror from the last
moments of millions of animals annually.

Christine Stevens is that woman. , '

She is tall, slender, and young—only 38

, years Old. An artist herself, she has the deli-

cate features of a renaissance madonna. So
profound is her reverence for life that famed
philosopher Dr. Albert Schweitzer calls her
“my companion in battle.”

These attributes of fact and heart prompt
some Congressmen to stop and listen. All
she asks is legislation compelling meat pack-
ers to make animals insensible to pain—as
most are not—before death. .

Other Congressmen listen for another
reason. They know she is the wife of one
of the Nation’s most powerful ﬁnancial ,wiz-
ards—Roger Stevens. He headed the group
that bought the Empire State Building a few
years ago.for a. record $51.5 million. Rea1~
estate interests of this Michigan-born ty—
coon are tremendous in such cities as Seattle,
Cleveland, Boston, and Washington, D. C.
The 45-year-old Etevens also is backer and
producer of dozens of Broadway hits, includ-
ing Tea and Sympathy and Cat on the Hot
TinRoof. In addition, he may be a rising
political ﬁgure. He is campaign ﬁnance
chairman for presidential aspirant Adlai
Stevenson.

Mr. Stevens also is treasurer of the Animal
Welfare Institute, 270 Park Avenue, New
YOrk City, headed by his 'wife.

Christine Stevens controls well the ﬂame
of indignation under a cool exterior. She

. ..

has a clear, factual, and persistent, ap-'

proach to the problem of humane slaughter.

Though she heads the Animal Welfare In-
stitute, dedicated' to various phases of
animal care, she established last year the
Society for Animal Protective Legislation.
Its primary purpose is to support—along
with. the larger humane organizations—the

,proposed humane Slaughter legislation.- It

is a registered lobby. Mrs. Ludwig Bemel—
mans, wife of the author-illustrator; is presi-
dent.

How does one go about arousing interest

in .a subject that is not only indelicate but.

so unspeakable that few speak of it?
Christine Stevens believes that the answer
is in facts, not tears and sympathy. To this
end she has visited slaughterhouses here
and abroad to familiarize herself with condi-

tions. She has written and distributed
thousands of leaﬂets, Facts on Humane
Slaughter. She testiﬁed in May before a

Senate subcommittee in favor of the bill
sponsored by Senator HUBERT HUMPHREY,
Democrat, Minnesota. And she and her as—
sociates have asked every Member of Con-
gress to support the legislation. _

“What we must remember,” Mrs. Stevens
says, “is that 12 other countries have passed
humane slaughter laws. Why do we stall
While this debasing brutality ‘i’continues?"

She then told about seeing beef cattle
bludgeoned repeatedly before falling as she
gaVe her answer to that question.

“Special stunning weapons to avoid this
barbaric and terrifying practice are available,
but there is no law requiring their use.”

She told Of seeing smaller animals—hogs,
calves, and lambs—being strung up by a
hind leg and their throats out while aliVe
and terriﬁed. , ‘

“This is needless torture,” she said. “when
carbon dioxide gas chambers can be used
safely and economically. The Hormel CO.
has installed one and ﬁnds its hams less
bruised,”=she added.

What will happen tothe proposed legisla-
tion (there are three bills) to outlaw these
age—old killing methods during the last days
of this Congress is anybody’s guess. Repre-
sentative MARTHA GRIFFITHS, Democrat,
Michigan, author of a House version, repOrts
that support mail continues to pour in.
Much of it comes from housewives.

If the bills don’t come to a vote this session, ‘

Christine Stevens will not rest until a law is
passed. She puts in more than 40 hours
weekly on this nonpaying job. Yet she is able
to live a full family life, too. The Stevens,
unlike many who deal in the millions of dol—

lars, live in a modest New York apartment '

and she does the cooking. She helps her hus~
band read manuscripts and, of course, goes to
all the ﬁrst nights.

They were in Europe three times last year;
Their 17-year-old daughter, Christabel
(called Kittybel), has been studying at the
Sorbonne in Paris. This fall she enrolls at
Cambridge in England.

Mrs. Stevens meets with European humane
groups frequently and this fall will attend
a meeting of the World Federation of
Animal Protection in Orleans, France. She
keeps up, however, with her hometown hu-
mane society in Ann Arbor, Mich—even
Writes a weekly radio program for it.

Her concern for animals, especially those
used for experimental laboratories, was
created by her father the late Dr. Robert
Gesell. He was chief of the Department of
Physiology at the University of Michigan.

She is the niece, incidentally, of the famed
child psychologist, Dr. Arnold Gesell, found-
er of the Gesell Institute for Child Develop—
ment at Yale UniVersity.

Whether the efforts of Mrs. Stevens, and
others equally dedicated, will succeed this
year nobody knows.
convinced many Congressmen that a nation
so advanced as this also needs: ‘

“A boundless ethics which will include the
animals also.” . .

But they may" have.

Haiti Celebrates .153d Anniversary of
Independence

EXTENSION OF REMARKS

OF

HON. ADAM C. POWELL, JR.

OF NEW YORK ,
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 26, 1956

Mr. POWELL. Mr. Speaker, inasmuch
as the Congress will not be in session
at the time of the event, I wish to take
this opportunity to send sincere greet-
ings and best wishes to the Haitian peo-
ple, President Paul E. Magloire, and His
Excellency, Mauclair Zepherin, Ambas-
sador of Haiti, on the occasion of the
celebration of the 153d anniversary of
the independence of Haiti, January 1,
1957.

Haiti, ﬁrst of the Latin American na-
tions to proclaim its freedom from co-
lonial rule is the only Negro republic in
the New, World. Dissatisfaction with
colonialism grew apace in America dur-
ing the last years of the 18th and early
years of the 19th centuries. St. Dom-
ingue was no exception, and on July 1,
1801, the-great Haitian patriot Toussaint
L’Ouverture declared the independence
of the island from France. ‘This inde-

pendence was reaffirmed by Jean Jacques
Dessalines on January 1, 1804, when the .
new republic was given the island’s abo-

riginal name——Haiti——meaning land of
mountains.

For a long time after separation from
France, Haiti, like other countries of
Latin America, suffered from political
chaos.
credit that, having so; many obstacles to
overcome, it has gone far on the road
'of self-development. Fundamentally,
that road has been one of agricultural
progress.

Agriculture is the basis of the Nation’s
economy. There has been no lack Of
awareness of the problems of Haitian age
2 riculture or of devotion to the cause of
‘ ”improving it. President Paul E. Ma-
‘ gloire upon the assumption of office em—

barked upon a plan of economic develop-
ment for Haiti the scope of which has
never before been undertaken in the
history of the country. The aim of the
Magliore program is to ameliorate all
economic life, but in Haiti this means
basically agricultural develOpment.
Haiti envisages a series of economic
measures of which the most'important,
actually in executiOn, is the development
Of irrigation and hydroelectric power in
the Artibonite Valley. In addition, the
program of economic development em-
braces measures for the promotion‘of
increased production of the chief expor-
tat-ion crops, intensiﬁed productionand
‘cultivation of ‘ foodstuffs, irrigation,
drainage and river control, conservation
and reforestation, development of ani-
mal husbandry, and the establishment
of demonstration and experiment farms.

It is to the country’s everlasting .

The government of President Magloire
has seriously adapted itself to the ful-
ﬁllment and implementation of this pro-
gram, which if' successful will accrue
many beneﬁts for Haiti.

The government has dedicated itself
to resort to all available means to im-
prove the health, security, and standard
of living among the people at large with-
out undue delay. The entire education
system of the Republic reﬂects this ob—
jective.

There exists a close rapprochement
between our country and Haiti. The
Haitian Government has repeatedly de—
clared its solidarity with the United
States and the other republics of the
Western Hemisphere. Haiti is no new-
comer to the practice of genuine inter-
American cooperation. Haitian soldiers
fought at the battle of Savannah in the
American Revolution. Haiti sent help‘
to Simon Bolivar in his struggle for in-
dependence in South America. Haiti’s
valuable contributions to World War II
and western hemispheric defense efforts
are well known. Hence, in contributing
her efforts to the common cause of de-
mocracy, Haiti is carrying out a well-
established historical tradition for which
other American nations are deeply grate-
ful.

Haiti is made up of a great and proud
people; it is an important democracy
toward which we feel friendly and we
believe its people feel friendly toward us.
I trust that throughout the years this
good feeling, this friendship, and this

cooperation may abide.

 

Refugee Act Amendments

EXTENSION OF REMARKS

HON. LAURENCE CURTIS

OF MASSACHUSETTS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Thursday, July 26, 1956

Mr. CURTIS of Massachusetts. Mr.
Speaker, in extension of my remarks, I
include an editorial from the Washing-
ton Post of Thursday, July 26, 1956, urg—
ing amendment of the Refugee Relief
Act.

In this connection I call the Members’
attention to the President’s letter re-
ferred tom the editorial which appears
in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD of July 18,
19516, at page 12119.

I certainly hope that even at this late
date, the Congress can take much-needed
action on this subject-

The editorial follows:

UNUSED VISAS

The President, in a strong letter to Senator
WATKINS that has been virtually overlooked
in Congress’ rush to adjourn, has urged once
again the prompt amendment of the immi-
gration laws to permit reallocation of un-
used refugee relief visas. “Unless action is
taken in this session,” Mr. Eisenhower de-
clared, “immigration from a number of
friendly nations such as Greece and Italy will
be drastically reduced when the visas which
have been available to those countries under
the Refugee Relief Act are exhausted this
summer.” "

/

Thousands of visas available toiescapees.

from Communist countries now living in Ger-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD APPENDIX

many and Austria have not been applied for,
but under present law these quotas cannot
be shifted to other countries where many
refugees are stranded. Senator WATKINS
hopes to tack the necessary amendments on
the so-called sheepherders’ bill—the only
House—passed immigration bill on the Senate
calendar, if and when it is called up by the
Senate leadership. Full hearings have been
held on the Watkins proposals, and Congress
ought to heed without fail the President’s
renewed plea for this humanitarian and long
overdue legislation.

HON. TOE L. EVINS

OF TENNESSEE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Thursday, July 26, 1956

Mr. EVINS. Mr. Speaker,-as the 84th
Congress approaches adjournment and
we reﬂect upon our work and service and
accomplishments, I wish to take advan-
tage of this opportunity to pay my own
special tribute of regard and apprecia-
tion for the three chairmen and sub-
committee chairmen of committees
on which I am privileged to serve in the
Congress. , '

It has been my good fortune and pleas-
ure and certainly distinct privilege to
be able to work with the members of
the Committee on Appropriations and
especially my colleagues of the two ap-
propriation subcommittees on which I
serve—namely, the Subcommittee on
Public Works Appropriations and the
Subcommittee on Independent Ofﬁces
Appropriations. My other committee
assignment is represented by member-
ship on the Select Committee on Small
Business of the House. My three com-
mittee chairmen are the .Honorable
CLARENCE CANNON, the gentleman from
Missouri, the distinguished chairman of
the House Appropriations Committee,
who also serves as chairman of the Sub-
committee on Public Works Appropria—
tions; the Honorable ALBERT THOMAS,
chairman of the Subcommittee on In-
dependent Oi‘ﬁces Appropriations, and
the Honorable WRIGHT PATMAN, chair-
man of the Select Committee on Small
Business of the House. All of these
gentlemen, my chairmen, are outstand-
ing chairmen.

The gentleman from Missouri [Mr.
CANNON], as we all know and recognize,
is one of the most distinguished Mem-
bers of this body. He is an able and
skilled parliamentarian. He is equally
outstanding as chairman of the great
Committee on Appropriations. This
year the appropriation bills have reached
the floor of the House in advance of an
earlier announced schedule. As chair-
man of the Subcommittee on Public
Works Appropriations, Mr. CANNON has
Worked diligently and devotedly on great
