Dear Christine:

Last week I got down to NY for an inter—
view with Paul Brooks, of Houghton Mifflin,
regarding the book, "Animal Machines," about
which you called me. The final declsloﬁwas
that I'd better not attempt the job because it
is not just a revision-—-it would involve com-
pletely rewriting the book from scratch, includ—
ing numerous American examples, references and
personal visits to typical plants. And this
is something I couldn't possibly undertake now
or in the mmmediate future. Strangely enough,
I had marked my calendar last Tuesday to phone
Fred Myers to get some idea of where these
various plants might be———and that was the day
I read his obituary in the paper!

Although I had my doubts from thé beginning,
I did give your suggestion thorough considera-
tion. But the situation was further complicated
by the fact that Thos. Y. Crowell Co., publishers
of one of my driving books, suddenly decided to
go ahead with a book on the various aspects of the
highway safety problem with which I am more or
less familiar. Even this will require quite a
lot of legwork. Whether or not the public is
panting for this I can't say, but it is something
I’ve been close to for a long time.

I'm terribly sorry I couldn't have done bet-
ter in the clutch. Bu}, any thanks for think—

ing of me, anyhow.

Cordial ,

the
case
for

humane

VIVIS‘ECTION

by Paul W. Kearney

FEW SUBJECTS generate more heat
and less light than “vivisection,” or
animal experimentation. Because the
sad fact is that the advocates of un-
restricted scientiﬁc research can
grow as hysterical as the most ardent
anti-vivisectionists.

This is deplorable to a neutral ob-
server who can calmly consider: 1)
The great beneﬁts derived from in-
telligent animal experimentation.
2) The distressing abuses committed
in the name of scientiﬁc research.

Unfortunately, it is too easy for
those who applaud the ﬁrst to dis-
miss, as crackpots, those who abhor
the second.

It is undeniable that if “the price

NOVEMBER, 1957

of the iron lung was 24 cats, or the
cost of Insulin was 33 dogs,” we got
a rare bargain. On the other hand,
one is entitled to question the neces-
sity for a Boston laboratory, while
studying the causes of human deaths
by ﬁre—to burn live pigs to death in
gasoline ﬂames. And to wonder if
the researchers would have learned
any less if the animals had been an-
esthetized. It was in criticism of four
other equally inexplicable examples
of cruel animal research that the
late Professor Robert Gesell, chair-
man of the Department of Physi-
ology at the University of Michigan,
who had performed animal experi-
ments and taught the techniques for

107

 




years, said: “These ominous experi-
ments make us search our souls and
wonder what the future has in store
for us.”

One is entitled to question, too,
the needless suffering caused living
creatures in haphazard and unsuper-
vised experiments by students in
high and even grade schools, espe-
cially when those experiments prove
nothing which has not already been
proved.

The British medical journal, the
Lancet, takes a dim view of such un-
inhibited experimentation, stating
that in Great Britain laboratory ex-
periments on animals are regarded
as an unpleasant necessity. The prac-
tice is accepted because so much
good has come of it; but for a cen-
tury legislation has insured that it
be used as sparingly as possible, kept
in the hands of those believed to be
humane and reponsible, and safe-
guarded by legal restrictions from
abuse.

FROM THE HUMANE standpoint

alone, you realize the enormity of
this problem when you consider the
huge volume of experimental ani-
mals now in use. There is no na-
tional census available, but a typical
large research laboratory will use
annually around 80,000 chickens,
1,000 dogs, 1,000 rabbits, 500 cats,
40,000 rats, 500 pigs, 5,000 guinea
pigs, 280,000 mice.

I have personally visited quite a
few such laboratories in various
parts of the country. And in many of
them conditions were abominable,
as these notes made on the spot will
testify: ‘

At a Boston hospital: stench over-

108

powering; sick and. well dogs
crowded together; mange and dis-
temper evident; dogs too sick to
move lying on wet concrete ﬂoors.

At a New England medical
school: no exercise, although out-
door runways are available. Dis-
temper a serious problem. Bad odor;
quarters not good. As many as nine
experimental operations performed
per dog.

At a New York medical school:
dead dogs left lying in cages where
they died; live dogs in cages soaking
wet from ﬂoor cleaned with hose;
metal mesh floors in cages with no
resting boards; small animals in
cramped quarters with barely
enough room to turn around.

In another hospital, where an ef-
fort is being made to rectify matters,
dogs recently subjected to drastic
surgical experiments, and too sick
to stand up, sprawled on wet cement
ﬂoors which were encrusted with ex-
crement and dirt. On the door was
tacked a copy of the American Med-
ical Association’s Code governing
the handling of animals in labora-
tories.

I can give a dozen more ex-
amples, but these cases should be
sufﬁcient to raise two rather perti-
nent questions:

1. Can scientists who tolerate
such shameful conditions in their
laboratory-animals’ quarters be
truly called humane?

2. If they are unaware of such
conditions, are they really ﬁt for re-
search work?

Dr. Gesell put it this way in a
heated exchange with the National
Society for Medical Research, the
public relations arm of the AMA

CORONET

 




charged with combatting anti-vivi-
sectionists :

“The National Society for Med-
ical Research would have us believe
that there is an important issue in
vivisection versus anti-vivisection.
To a physiologist there can be no is-
sue on vivisection per se. The real
and urgent issue is Humanity versus
Inhumanity in the use of experi-
mental animals. . . .”

This might be put down as the
personal bias of one man were it not
for the fact that I have had a dozen
reputable physicians conﬁrm it pri-
vately. And among them there is a
very lively conviction that far too
many animal experiments are con-
ducted for the prestige of the re-
searcher rather than the benefits
to society.

Unquestionably, too, some are un-
dertaken for baser motives. A classic
example was the notorious series of
experiments carried on for six years
by research institutions to prove——
and disprove—the theory that to-
bacco containing glycol caused less
damage to tissue than that contain-
ing glycerin. Scores of technicians
under the direction of 12 eminent
Doctors of Medicine were involved
in the experiment.

One of the many tests employed
was to blow, continuous streams of
tobacco smoke against rabbits’ eye-
balls to ascertain how much, or how
little, damage results. In another
experiment, smoke was pumped
through the nostrils of dogs until a
more diligent researcher came up
with the idea of cutting incisions in
rabbits’ tracheas so that smoke
could be pumped directly into the
lungs. Yet only one physician admits

NOVEMBER, 1957

to having anesthetized the animals
he used. (All of this came out during
exhaustive hearings held in Wash-
ington by the Federal Trade Com-
mission.)

Such questionable behavior for
purely commercial purposes is dis-
turbing enough. But now we are
faced with the rapid spread of an-
other distressing development: the
encouragement of unrestrained ani-
mal experimentation by high school
students; and the ofﬁcial (both med-
ical and pedagogical) approval of
fatal feeding tests on living animals
for the ediﬁcation of children in
primary grades.

Today, from coast to coast, class-
rooms from the third grade up are
displaying cages of white rats, ham-
sters or guinea pigs—which are be-
ing slowly starved to death on a
vitamin-deﬁcient diet while control
subjects are fed a balanced ration to
dramatize the distinction.

The National Cancer Institute
provides detailed instructions for a
variety of demonstration-experi-
ments for school use in which can-
cers are implanted in healthy mice
so the children can watch them die
over a period of three weeks. One of
the experiments involved skin graft-
ing—by amateurs! At Port Washing-
ton, New York, high school students
are performing these cancer trans-
plants on living animals.

This wholesale employment of
animals for classroom work is a gross
violation of the accepted principle
that a minimum number of animals
(in painful experiments) be used to
accomplish the purpose.

As a result of all this we now see,
with increasing regularity, such

newspaper headings as this from the
New York World-Telegram 69’ Sun
of February 1, 1956:

GIRL CUTS ANIMALS

INTO TALENT MELON

Beneath is the story of a 15-year-
old girl who won an award for scien-
tiﬁc talent. The true scientiﬁc sig-
niﬁcance of her efforts is summed up
in the sentence: “She found the
study ‘very interesting,’ but said she
did not care to delve further into it.
She wants to study engineering
physiCs. . . .”

In Atlanta, Georgia, a 17-year-
old student won an entry to the Na-
tional Science Fair by putting black
widow spiders in the deep-freezer,
then injecting the venom from the
spiders’ fangs into mice. “I watched
the mice closely,” the Atlanta jour-
nal and Constitution of June 24,
1956, quotes him, “and I observed
all the symptoms of black widow poi-
soning as the mice died.”

In Utica, New York, a 19-year-
old student won a science prize for
radiation experiments on nearly 300
animals in his cellar laboratory “at-
tracting many neighborhood chil-
dren who came to watch.” With
tons of literature on the subject in
the Atomic Energy Commission ﬁles,
it seems inane to have a boy stum-
bling over the same ground when
the needless suffering of living crea-
tures is at stake.

The basic point is that none of
these amateur experiments has the
least scientiﬁc value beyond the sat-
isfaction of a morbid curiosity. Fur-
thermore, competent psychologists
might be able to tell us quite a bit
about the effect of this incipient
sadism on the minds of juveniles.

110

There is no valid scientiﬁc justi-
ﬁcation for such haphazard experi-
ments on living animals—especially
by amateurs—which cannot pos-
sibly provide knowledge we do not
already have. And if the lessons of
the nutrition tests are considered
signiﬁcant enough to warrant Visual
presentation, which is debatable, this
can be done by photographs, slides
or motion pictures. Thus the demon-
stration could be made once and for
all on a few animals, and not need-
lessly repeated over and over again
on thousands.

SUCH OUTLANDISH practices sim-
ply emphasize the extent to which
we Americans have blindly turned
“scientiﬁc research” into a fetish,
with the result that there is today
virtually no limitation on what any
Tom, Dick or Harry with a kitchen
knife can do to an animal so long as
he wraps it in the protective cloak of
“scientiﬁc research.”

Such practices, amateur or pro-
fessional, would not be tolerated in
Great Britain, unquestionably the
most enlightened spot on the world
map of animal experimentation.
And it has been since the passage in
1876 of its famous Cruelty to Ani-
mals Act, which has provided British
medical science with its enviable
record of both humaneness and
achievement.

Brieﬂy, the Act gives the Home
Secretary power to grant or with-
hold license for the employment of
animals in experimental research.
Thus, if a scientist wishes to conduct
an experiment on a living animal he
states the purpose and nature of the
experiment, and his qualiﬁcations.

CORONET

 




The application is checked by a
medical board appointed by the
Crown.

Furthermore, inspectors from the
Home Ofﬁce have the authority to
visit, unannounced, any research
establishment at any time—and to
bring any violator into court, where
conviction may result in a stiff ﬁne.
Jail sentences, plus loss of license to
practice, face repeaters.

The guiding light in the British
approach to animal experimentation
is the factor called “the pain con-
ditions.” The ﬁrst principle is that
pain must never be needless: if for
any reason pain is unavoidable, it
must be minimized to the absolute
limit.

For example, one clause of the
Act speciﬁes that in no case may an
experimenter permit suffering which
is both severe and likely to endure,
whether or not the main object of
the experiment has been attained.
And when the main object has been
attained, neither brief severe suffer-
ing nor prolonged mild suffering
may be permitted.

Thus in any operation—which
means not only surgery, but such
things as bruising, crushing, burn-
ing, explosion, electric shock, cor-
rosive poisons, or stress, the animal
must be completely anesthetized by
someone who is responsible for see-
ing that the subject does not pre-
maturely regain consciousness. If

any serious injury is caused by the ,

operation, the animal must be pain-
lessly destroyed before recovery from
the anesthetic.

In contrast to practice in this
country, no painful experiment may
be made in England to demonstrate

NOVEMBER, I 957

something already proven; no ex-
periments may be made on living
animals merely to perfect manual
skill or to satisfy pure curiosity. And,
regardless of his technical standing,
no researcher with a reputation for
callousness, indifference or careless-
ness can obtain a permit to experi-
ment on any vertebrate animal.

It will be contended that all of
these criteria apply in this country
without beneﬁt of mandatory legis-
lation. But this is far from the truth.

Last winter, for instance, I visited
a southern medical school which has
earned a commendable reputation
for keeping its experimental work
humane. Yet, even here, a visiting
surgeon was working on an anesthe-
tized dog which he had opened up
from throat to pelvis. Suddenly an
unexpected development transpired
in the test, which was of major im-
portance to the experiment but
which required library checking. So,
hastily and haphazardly sewing up
the dog, the researcher rushed to his
books. Some time later a volunteer
humane worker came in to ﬁnd the
animal fully conscious and in agony,
still strapped to the operating table.

It is not to be implied that prog-
ress is not being made in this coun-
try, through the voluntary efforts
of our more enlightened medical
men, and through the missionary
work of the Animal Welfare Insti-
tute of New York. Yet it is signiﬁ-
cant that this organization—num-
bering among its charter members
such eminent scientists as Dr. Gesell;
Dr. Lee R. Dice, Director of the In-
stitute of Human Biology; and Dr.
Peter Okkelberg, zoologist and as-
sistant dean of the Horace Rankin

111

 




School of Graduate Studies—is reg-
ularly attacked by the extremists
on both sides.

The more progressive researchers
are also making great strides in the
development of materials which
supplant living animals for an in-
creasing number of investigations.
Lederle Laboratories’ pioneering in
the use of chick embryos in the
manufacture of their rabies vaccine
is a notable case in point. So also is
the use of embryonated eggs for the
control of cancer growth which was
reported last year by two Univer-
sity of Texas scientists.

The substitution of lower forms of
animal life is also an encouraging
trend; the satisfactory use of beetles
(in lieu of rats) at Rutgers; the em-
ployment of frogs (instead of rab-
bits) in US. Navy research work.

Generally speaking, however,
such voluntary policing as is repre-
sented by the AMA Code for experi-
mental laboratories doesn’t work.
Nor do such gestures as inviting “in-
spections” by local Board of Health
doctors.

I know of one case in New York

City where a humane worker re-
ceived permission to accompany one
of these inspectors on his rounds
through the laboratories of a large
institution. While pointing out how
ideal conditions were, the inspector
walked right past a dog whose in-
cision had come open and whose
entrails were hanging out.

Not until the humane worker
protested vigorously did the inspec-
tor report the condition and only
then was something ﬁnally done
aboutit

My purpose here is not to present
a ready-made solution, but to draw
the attention of open-minded peo-
ple, both lay and professional, to the
very real and urgent issue of Hu-
manity versus Inhumanity in the
use of animals for experimental pur—
poses. Such recognition must come
before any rational corrective mea-
sures can be considered. And in
the absence of that recognition, no
such measures have been proposed
by either the numerous Anti-Vivi-
section Societies, or by their oppo-
site number, the National Society

for Medical Research.

IT’S THE
ONLY WORLD

BY C. R. SMITH

President, American Airlines

€wo OLD-TIME Western cowhands, so the story goes, were discussing
the local poker game, in which one of them was a consistent loser.

“Why, that game is ri g,"ged his friend said. ‘You can’t possibly win.”

“I know it,” was the reply. But its the only game in town!”

I suppose most of us occasionally feel that the cards are stacked
against us—the world we li\e in can appear uncertain at times. But
its the only world we have and we must make the best of it while
trying to impro\e the things about it that we don t like.

The world 13 not going to change just because we hope it will; some
basic faith and much diligent effort are required. he usually found
that faith and hard work are more easily stimulated it we know that
others are working with us for a better future and that their efforts are
meeting with success. This is one reason I consider The Readers
Digest a friend.

Many of the stories in the Digest are about people who are moving
forward, getting things done. Digest articles on science tell us of the
search for new drugs and new methods to control disease and pestilence.
Without ignoring the problem of juvenile delinquency, the Digest brings
us news of heartening accomplishments by young people. It tells of
people in all parts of the world who are working to create a better
future for us all—and succeeding.

This skillful and human reporting of tangible progress by people
of good faith helps to maintain a climate of accomplishment that will
surely encourage the hopes and the work of others.

Modern methods of humahe slaughter are abailable and in partial Suse. Simple

PAUL W. KEARNEY AND RICHARD DEMPEWOLFF

'1‘ECENTLY, on the killing ﬂoor

. of a Midwestern slaughter—
7 ; house, we saw—and heard—
a knocker swing his primitive sledge
hammer a dozen times before he
succeeded in stunning three fright-
ened, bellowing steers. We’ve had
the unenviable experience, in an
antiquated pork abattoir, of observ-
ing a poorly stuck pig shoved into
the scalding tank while still fully
conscious. We’ve seen lambs and
calves, shackled and hanging head
down, bleed to death in the same
unstunned state.

This medieval brutality is strange—
ly out of place in the 20th century
in a nation which professes the high—
est ideals of humane treatment for

animals. Yet, in many of the 3000 or
more small slaughterhouses scat'
tered from Johnson Street in Brook—
lyn to Townsend Street in San
Francisco, such grisly practices are
far from uncommon.

What makes the situation even
more deplorable is that since Au—
gust 30, 1960, we have had in opera—
tion the Humane Slaughter Act, a
federal law which prescribes that
livestock must be made insensible
“by a single blow, gunshot, electric,
chemical or other rapid means be-
fore they are shackled, hoisted, cast,
thrown or cut.”

This law came 84 years after
Switzerland enacted similar legisla—
tion, and long after a dozen other

countries—and the Fiji Islands-—
abolished needless slaughterhouse
cruelty. Yet it is hardly more than a
step in the right direction. It carries
no criminal penalties for violators.
It affects only some 500 packers
who sell meat to the federal govern-
ment. These large hou'ses account
for roughly18o percent of all livestock
killed commercially each year for
meat ~1- more than 100 million head.
But this leaves some 25 million ani-
mals a year that can still be clubbed,
or shackled head down, alive and.
kicking until bled to death, in 2501.1
smaller packing plants.

In any plant, good or bad. the
meat animal 13 dispatched by cutting
its throat or otherwise severing its

carotid arteries-«because it must be
bled as well as killed. But the man-
ner in which the creature is brought
to this point is the c‘rux of the prob-
lem.

Because of their size and strength,
cattle must be rendered unconscious
ﬁrst. In many abattoirs this is ac-
complished with a sledge hammet
or maul in the hands of a powerful
man who stands on a “platform and
belts each animal on the forehead as
it enters the knocking pen. If the
aim is true, the stunned beast rolls
out on the killing floor for the re-
mainder of the procedure. But if the
steer shies and the sledge misses its
mark, a jaw may be broken, an eye
gouged, or some other painful in—
jury inflicted. In this case, the ani—
mal lS thrown into complete panic.
The task of stunning it tlzen needs
no elaboration.

The ﬁrst step in handling sheep
hogs and sometimes calves 1s shack—
ling. A shackler slips a chain noose
around one of the animal’s hind
legs, and the beast is hoisted aloft
head down--smoothly and quietly
if all goes well, or with a bone—
cracking yank if the animal turns
the wrong way or catches a leg
under the door of the shackling
box. Then, fighting frantically, the
unfortunate creature is carried by
one leg on an endless chain to the
sticker, whose job is to slip a stiletto
into the strUggling animal’s throat
without amputating his own hand.
This preposterous manhandling
causes a bedlam of hysterical animal
screams and squeals, which utterly
panics incoming victims.

Such cruelty should not have
required legislation to remedy. Expe—
rience in Europe with electric stun—
ning, as well as the exemplary work
of. a few big U.S. packers, should
have provided ample evidence of
the advantages of more . modern
methods. At the George A. Hormel
8: Co. plant in Austin, Min11.. for
example, 1200 hogs pe1 hour are
handled without animal agony 01
human risk. This is accomplished
by means of two ingenious carbon-
dioxide imlnobilizers (a compam
inve11ti1:1n),installe’d 111 1950.

The animals are led single ﬁle
along a rubber— lined passage into a
chamber where they whiff C02. The
gas anesthetizes them for 25 seconds.
They roll onto a convey er that cara
ries them, silent and still, to the
stickers. Gone are the furor and

 




19(31

panic which formerly made them so
unmanageable. Proof of the system’s
economic advantage is the fact that
Hormel has now installed it in all
the company’s plants.

Another simple but effective de—
vice has been in use for I4 years at
the Oscar Mayer Co., of Madison,
Wis. Here it is a “captive-bolt stun—
ner” that renders animals insensible.
Long used in European slaughter-
houses to replace the sledge hammer,
this tool is a sort of hand—gun actu-
ated by either a powder charge or
compressed air. Instead of a free—ﬂy-
ing bullet, its projectile is a bolt fas-
tened to the frame. After each shot
the bolt is returned to the barrel,
much as is the cork in a popgun.

Like so many progressive ideas,
the captive—bolt stunner ran into a
barrage of objections from many
slaughterers. One major criticism
was that the device didn’t prevent
animals from arriving at the knock-
ing pen in an excited, head—tossing
state. How could you hold cattle still
enough to use the instrument?

Then, a few years ago, foreman
Harold Watson, at the Seitz Pack—
ing C0,, in St. Joseph, Mo., had an
idea. He had often noticed how
deer and other wild animals stand
transﬁxed by the beam of an auto-
mobile’s headlights. Why wouldn’t
cattle in a slaughterhouse react to
light in the same way?

Floodlights installed at bull’s—eye
level at the end of the Seitz pens
quickly proved that they would.
Even excited steers led into the
knocking box suddenly stood stock—

LET US HAVE MERCY ON THESE DUMB ANIMALS 47

still, staring into the beam. Where—
upon the knocker could perform his
job humanely, and therefore swiftly
and economically.

Despite the advantages of the cap-
tive-bolt stunner demonstrated by
Mayer, Seitz and a progressive
group of small packers who have
used the technique voluntarily for
years, the device has been remark—
ably slow in catching on. A sizable
number of small packers have pro-
claimed unwillingness to invest in
any new methods until they are
forced to do so by local legislation.

Complicating the picture from the
outset has been the fact that kosher
slaughterers have opposed reform
on religious grounds. The ritual of
kosher killing prescribes that an ani-
mal must arrive clean, whole and
unblemished at the point where the
rabbi makes the ﬁnal thrust. Ortho— ”
dox rabbis and kosher packers have
interpreted this to mean that the ani-
mal must be conscious, and they
have insisted that the rugged shack-
ling and hoisting alive, even of
full—grown cattle, is the only prac—
tical means to comply with Hebrew
law.

Hence the new federal legislation
provides exceptions for ritual pack-
ers. And many small nonkosher
packers have lined up behind the
religious groups, arguing, “If they
don’t have to, why should we?”

But a few months ago Canada
Packers, Ltd., of Toronto, came up
with a device that will enable kosher
packers to abandon shackling and
hoisting of living cattle and still

‘ comply with religious doctrine. It
is a plain steel box into which the
animal is led or prodded. As a
padded gate shuts behind him, it
nudges him forward so that his head
and neck protrude through a win-
dow at the Other end. Here the cut
is made quickly and cleanly.

This simple,,inexpensive holding
pen is the ﬁrstknown humane han—
dling device to get orthodox rabbini-
cal approval in the United States.

chairman of the Presidium of Ortho—
dox Rabbis, and Joseph Soloveit-
chik, of Boston, have both endorsed
it. However, few kosher packers in
the United States had shown any
interest in the device at the time this
article went to press. .

The US. Senate passed the Hu-
mane Slaughter Act, by a vote of 72
to 9, after seven hours of bitter de-
bate. Unquestionably inﬂuential in
this action was the ﬂood of mail the
Senate had received -— tens of thou-
sands of letters from members of
humane societies, packing-house
labor unions, veterans’ organiza-
tions, church groups and women’s
clubs. Now the law needs to be
strengthened. Canada has recently

‘
pointed the way with strict legisla-
tion covering all meat for interpro—
vincial and export trade. The new
Canadian law, which prescribes the
use of mechanical stunning devices,
carbon-dioxide gas or electric cur—
rent to render slaughter animals
unconscious, carries criminal penal‘
ties for violations.

Meanwhile, one sure way to bring
into line the thousands of small
plants presently untouched by the
federal regulation is to get action out
of the state legislatures. Bills have
been defeated recently in New York,
Michigan, Connecticut, Ohio,
Rhode Island and Tennessee. But
in California, Washington, Wiscon-
sin, New Hampshire, Minnesota
and Massachusetts, humane-slaugh-
ter laws were enacted last year. And
bills are now on the dockets of, or
being prepared in, the legislatures of
all the remaining states.

In the name of decency, don’t
these. bills deserve cvcryone’s sup-

port?»

are running it as the lead article, but
that remains to be seen. Farming it out

THE READER'S DIGEST

PLEASANTVILLE - NEW YORK

October 25, 1960

Dear Paul:

As you know, weinvolved Richard
Dempewolff in further work on the piece on the
humane handling of animals. In the Opinion of
all of us concerned, he did a good job, largely,
I suSpect, because he brought to the task a
certain freshness in point of View and was able
therefore to make good use of the accumulation
of material and the drafts you had written.

We feel that it ought to have a joint
signature and I hope you will agree.

Enclosed with this note is a copy of
the final cut and if there are points that seem
to you in sore need of correction or change,
please let me know at once. The article is
scheduled for the January issue, closing this
week. It will be used in TOGETHER, the
Methodist magazine edited by Leland Case.

All the best.

Sincerely,

Simple decency demands humane

slaughter lawg in every atate of

the union

Let's Have Meat without Brutality:

Paul N. Kearney and Richard Dempewolff

 




Recently, on the killing floor of a Midwestern slaughterhouse, we
saw (and heard) a knocker swing hie primitive sledge hammer a dozen
times to stun three frightened cattle. We've had the unenvlable experi-
ence, in an antiquated pork abattoir, of observing a poorly stuck pig
hit the scalding tank in a conscious state. 'We’ve seen lambs and calves,
shackled and hanging head down, bleed to death while conscious. In an

Omaha packing plant, we watched a ehackler wrestle four hysterical hogs

in order to clap a chain around the hind leg of one. The chain, circling
a 12~foot overhead wheel, snapped taut as the hoiet began to turn. But
the hog was pinned beneath two other panic~etricken porkere totaling

450 pounds. The wheel ground on until the victim, hauled by one leg,

eXploded from the equirmlng mass, kicking eed screaming. ehy the leg

 




 

 

wasn’t torn from its socket is hard to understand.

This medievalbrutality is strangely out of place in the 20th
century, in a nation which professes the highest ideals of humane
treatment for animals and which has at hand the most advanced technological
equipment for handling the practical taeke of a civilized society. Yet
in many of the 3000 or more email elaughterhouees scattered from Johneen
Street in Brooklyn to Townsend Street in San Francisco, such grisly
practices are not uncemmon.

what makes this etate of affairs the more deplorable is that since
August 31, 1960, we have had in Operetien the Humane Slaughter Act,

a federal law which prescribes that livestock must be made ineeneible
"by a single blow, gunehet, electric current or other rapid meane
before they are shackled, hoisted, east, thrown or out."

The law came 84 years after Switzerland enacted similar legislation
and long after a dozen other countries «~ and the Fiji Islands —~
abolished needless abetteir eeuelty. Yet it ie herély more than a
step in the right direction. It carries no criminal penalties for
violators. It affects only the 2&0 packers Wht e811 meat to the federal

government. These large heueee account for roughly 80 percent of all




 

 

livestock killed each year for meat ~~ 99,&14,897 heed in.1959. Thie
leaves some 20 million animals a year that can still be clubbed, or
shackled head down, alive and kicking until bled to aesth, in
thousands of smaller packing plants.

In any plant, good or bed, the meet animal is dispatched by
cutting its throat or otherwise severing its carotid arteries, because
it must be bled as well as killed. But the manner in which the creature
is brought to this point is the crux of the whole business. Methods
practiced by all but a few U.S. sleughterhouses prior to last August,
and still in effect at many local abattoirs, date back nearly a century.

Because of their size and strength, cattle are knocked unconscious
first. This is accomplished with a sledge hammer or maul in the hands
of a powerful men who stands on a platform and belts eech animal on the
forehead as it enters the knocking pen. If the aim is perfect, the
stunned beast rolls out on the killing floor for the remainder of the
procedure. But if the steer shies and the sledge misses its mark, it
may break a jaw, gouge out an eye, or otherwise painfully injure the
beast. If so, it is thrown into complete panic. The task of stunning

it then needs no elaboration.

 




“a...

Sheep, hogs, and ccmetimee calves are handled differently. They
are shackled anﬁ stuck. A ehackler clips a chain noose around the
animal’s hind leg and it is hoisted aloft, head down -~ emoothly and
quietly if all goes well, or with a bone~cnacking yank if the animal
turns the wrong way, falls or catchee a leg under the door of the
enackling box. Then the unfortunate creature, fighting frantically,
is carried by one leg on an endless chain to the sticker, whose Job is
to slip a stiletto blade into the struggling animal‘s throat without
amputating his own hand.

Such preposteroue manhondling ceueee a hedlam of hysterical animal
screams and squeals, a turmoil which panics the incoming victims with
a terror we would not dream of inflicting on ruthless criminale, whom

we execute with great delicacy.

Such cruelty should not have required legislation to remedy. Ex»
perience in Europe with electric etunning, 3e well as the exemplary
work of a few big U.S. packers, ehould.heve provided ample eviécnce of

the ecvantagee of more moéern.methode. At the Hormel plant in Austin,

Minn., 1200 hoge per hour are hanéled without animal agony or human risk

in a single ingenious carbon dioxiéeimmobilizer (a company invention)

 




 

installed in 1952. The animals are led tingle file along a rubber«
lined passage into a 602 chamber. Here a few whiffs of gee aneethetizee
them for 25 seconds. In come, they roll onto a conveyor that carries
them, silent and still, to the stickers in ten seconds.

Gone is the furor and panic which formerly.made the terrified
animals so unmanageable. They arrive at the end of the line sound
asleep and in the correct position, and the stickere' job is enormously
simplified. Proof of the system’s economic advantage 13 the fact that
Harmel has now installed it in §§}_their plants.

Nine years ago the Oscar ﬁayer Co., at Madison, Wis., adepted a
simple but effective device known as the captive bolt stunner to render
animals ineeneible. Long used in European slaughterhoueee to replace
the sledge hammer, this tool is a sort of hend~gun actuated by either
a powder charge or compressed air. Instead of a free~fly1ng bullet, its
projectile is a bolt fastened to the frame. After each shot the bolt
is returned to the barrel much as is the cork in a popgun.

Like so many progressive ideas, the eaptive bolt stunner ran into

a barrage of objections from.eoet slaughterere. One major criticiem.ees

that the device didn‘t prevent animals from.erriving at the knocking pen

 




 

 

-6.-

in a highly excited, head~tosaing stata. wa did yau hold cattle
still enough to use the inatrument? thay ask3d.

Than, a few years ago, a foreman namad Harold watson at the Seitz
Packing Co., in St. Joseph, Mo., had an iéea. Ha had often pondered
the way deer and ether wild animals stand transfixed by the beam of an
automobile's headlights. ﬁhy wouldn‘t cattle in a slaughterhouse react
to light in the same way?

Floodlights installed at bull's~eye lavel at the and of the Seitz
pens quickly proved they weuld. Even excited steers led to the frightening
dead and of the knocking box guddenly steed stock still, staring into
the beam. Thus the knocker could perform his Jab humanely, and there~
fore swiftly and economically.

Bagpite tbs advantages 9f the captive bolt stunner demonstrated by

Mayer, Seitz ané a progressive group ef small packers who have also used

 

the technique voluntarily far-years, the device still is remarkably slow
in catching an. Accerding ta Gardiner winkle, of the Rational Provisioner
~» a publication that has led the fight far humane slaughter within the
packing industry, “A significant group of small packars have preelaimed

unwillingness to invest in any new methads until they are farced to do

 




 

a

so by local legislaticn."

Complicating the whclc picture from the outset has been the
fact that kosher slaughtercrc have opposed reform on religious grounds.
The ritual of Rather killing prcacribes that an animal must arrive
clean, whols and unblemished at the point where the rabbi maknc the
final thrust. Orthodcx rabbis and kosher packers have interpreted this
to mean that the animal must be conacious, and have insisted that the
rugged shackling and hoisting alive is the only practical means to
ccmply with the Biblical law.

Rance the new federal legislation providea exceptions for ritual
packers. Many small non~kosher packers have lined up behind the re~
ligicuc groups, arguing: ”If thcy don’t have to, why should we?"

But a few months ago, Canada Packers, Ltd. (Toronto), came up with

a device that will caablc kcahar packers to abandon shackling and

hoisting of living cattle and still comply with religious dcctrine.

It is a plain steel box into which the animal is led or prodded. As a

padded gate shuts behiné him, it nudges him forward as his head and 4
neck protrude through a windcw at the other end, where the cut is made

qyickly and painlessly. In ascends the creaturc fallc unccnsciouc, thc

 




eiﬁe of the pen drape, and the ehackler dcee hie Jeb on an inert carcass.

This simple, inexpensive holding pen is the first known humane
handling device to get crthodcx rabbinical approval in the United
States. Rabbis Aliezer Silver, national chairmen of the Presidium of
Orthodox Rabbis, and Joseph Soloveitchik, of Boston, have both endorsed
it. Hewever, no koeher packer in the United states had shown any
interest in the device at the time this article went to press.

The public first learned of the brutal horrors in the nation's
abattoire about six years ago, when the humane societies began their
latest drive for legislation, and, frustrated by 27 years of public
ignorance and meat industry apathy, went all out to educate everyone.

Local societies, equipped.mainly with bell~peint pens, shoe leather and

vocal cards, preeeed the battle free coaet to coast. They wen adherents

in veterans“ organizaticne, pecking~hcuee labor unions, natienally
influential church groups and nemen’s clubs.

Their war cry was simple: ”write your Congressman.“ And peeple
wrote. ene Seneter received nearly £5,000 letters.

A subcemmittee of the Hence Cemmittee on Agriculture visited the

largest and meet respectable plants, saw the daily atrocities, and

 




 
 

 

spread on public records roams of'teatimony retooling horrors of which

  
 

most people had known nothing: tho squealing of terrified hogs, tho

 

sickening bouts between men and bellowing stooro in panic, the con-
vuloive thrashings of creatures in their death throes, sometimes
opattering blood over man and animals, walls and flooro where it mixed
with fright-induced oxcretiono.

Arouoed women began to carry names of humane slaughterhouoes in
thoir shopping bags. Possibly it occurred to Congressmen that the
houoowivos would also carry a.list of those who voted against reform.
For suddenly a landslide began for decency in our olaughterhousos.

Tho Senate, after seven hours of bitter debate, paoood the Emmano
Slaughter Act by a vote of 72 to 9.

But now that law needs to be strengthened. Canada has recently
pointed the way with strict legislation covering all meat for inter»

provincial and export trade. The new Canadian law ohich prescribes the
use of mechanical Stunning devices, carbon dioxide gas or electrical
current to render slaughter animals unocnsoiouo, carries criminal

penaltioo for violations.

Senator Allan G. Ellender of Louisiana, who as chairman of the

   




- 10.-

Senate Committee on Agriculture was once unenthueieetie about e humane
slaughter bill, now wants a law applicable to all packers engaged in
interstate commerce, with offenders punisheé under the criminal code.
“There can be no effective slaughter pregram,” he has said, ”until 23331?
Rg§z_ie forced to comply with these standards.”

One sure way to bring into line the thousands of small plants new
untouched by the federal regulation is to aeeail the state legislatures.
Bills have been defeated recently in New York,.ﬁichigan, Connecticut,
Ohio, Rhode Island and Tennessee. But in California, washingten,
Wisconsin, New Hampshire and Minneeote humane slaughter laws were
enacted last year; Bills are new on the deckete ef 11 other state
legislatures, and are being prepared for the remaining states in 1961.

In due time determined housewives will force the issue in every

state capital. In the name of decency they deserve everyone’e support.

Dear Paul:

I hate to tell you that there is no chance what-
ever for the latest draft on humane slaughter. Four
or five of us have considered it carefully but we
think you simply end up preaching and that you don‘t
realize how little most folks know about what you
know in overwhelming detail.

I suggested to Ken that we call in another writer
who can tackle the job fresh. his will probably in—
volve a joint signature. I don't know yet how the thing
will work out but I do promise to keep you posted and to
do everything possible to get the article in, one way or
another.

It would be helpful if you found it possible to
send me the names and addresses of two or three people
another writer might find it wise to see in doing
further work on the article.

Sincerely,

Dear Paul,

One of our correspondents recently wrote to Readers Digest
offering tozrite an article for them about 8. 3570. She received
a reply very promptly stating that they appreciated her writing
but they already were working on articles on humane slaughter
and on S. 3570. I surely hope it is you who is doing the latter
and not some one who's against it. Have you heard anything on
this?

The newspapers are reallyching wonders. More than 27 different
ones have given editorial support, and so far we haven't heard of
any opposed, though there were two which didn't give absolute en—
dorsement of the bill as written-~still, this is remarkable.

The National Society for Medical Research and the National
AntiAVivisection Society storm on. You may be interested in reading
some of their comments in the new Information Report.

Best wishes,

Sincerely,

Dear Christine: Yes, I have revised the humane slaughter thing

- on the state level - for the 3rd time, mailing the Mss., on

July 7 just before I left for Detroit. I got back Saturday, but
there is no word yet. As for S 3570, no mention was made of it
at RD and I do not know what they are doing or who is doing it.
I’ll try to find out, but will doubtless get a brush off. _There
is a lot of opposition down there to running the slaughter piece.
Ken Payne, the executive editor, is the only one in favor of it
and he eems to be trying to push it through regardless of the
others. This makes a rather delicate situation for me and I

hate to do anything that would rock the boat when we're this close
to the brink of the falls.

Dear Mr. Kearney:

A number of the editors here were interested in your article,
"What Kind of Vivisection Do You PreferT', which was brought to our
attention by Mrs. Roger Stevens. We felt, however, that the effec-
tiveness of such a piece depends to an unusual degree upon its
credibility-~both because any discussion of cruelty to animals makes
a blatant appeal to the reader's sympathy and because the subject
has attracted a great many fanatics. And naturally it is important
that an article about science should stand up to scrutiny by scien-
tists.

Before we consider further whether it will be a good possibility
for 3 mm; article, we want to clear up some doubts which it
raises. If you would care to give us some data about these points--
either in writing or by coming to the office to discuss then-«I should
be glad to go over them and take them up more fully with Mr. Fischer
and other members of the staff.

It would be helpful to know the following, I or example:

What is your source for the data on the experimnts smurised
on the first page? Where was Dr. Gesell‘s comnt printed, when?

, . When was the E13391 conﬂuent made?

How do you know that the I'essential criterion“ was not applied
by the American scientist who span the cats (page 2 of your weript).
What is the source of this report? And of the next report on the dogs
which were debsrked?

On page 3, you summarise experiments with cigarette smoke and
consent on what the tests did not prove. But what did the scientists
claim that they proved? Where were the studies made? What tobacco
comany made then? what I"unfair and misleading“ data in cigarette
advertising did the no prohibit? What is your source for this apnea?

Which of the Wt! you cite were performed at Harvard,
Coluﬁvis, mom, Illinois, Virginia, Sew Ice-k Polyclinic, 8.1.0.
Medical, Chicago. and Sinai Hospital, Baltinore? These institutions
would have a valid objection to being included in such a broad statement
as you sake, without specific charges.

May 24, 1960

Dear Stell:

The mere fact, "taken out of context," that it
is over three weeks since your post card came would
not be accepted in any court of law as evidence that
I was not very much interested in your message. For
one thing, I have been up in Rochester and Southbridge
researching an optical story. For another, the on
again, off again Digest suddenly came to life again
on the humane slaughter piece slanted on the state
level. At least there was a faint heart beat and
shallow respiration!

Two months ago Fersugon wrote me that my revision
didn't get to first base and was dead. He sent me
$250 as heart balm. But Just before I left for
Rochester another note came from him saying that Ken
Payne was back; was very much interested in the re—
vise; was going ahead with it; wanted more work on
it; would call me shortly-~—and here is another $500!
(This is better than Social Securityll

I immediately wrote and said I would be home on
last Thursday night and could see them at daybreak
Friday, or whenever. No response yet. But if I
don't hear from them by the end of this week, I shall
ask for another $500.

In view of all this I am not stirring up anything
with Andrew Jones---whose name, incidentally, I can t
find on the masthead. Since Ken Payne is second in
command only to Wallace (who's practically never there),
and since he appears to be over—ruling Dashiel and all
the others on this, he's our 0 hope. Light another
candle!

Dear Christine:
If you haven't already heard from her, get

in touch with miss Virginia C. Purdy, 49 - 71st

 

Street, Bklyn 9. She wrote Dr. Ralph Sockman
about the possibility of getting the Church in-
terested in animal welfare, and he referred her
to a Rev. Paul W. Rishell, who seems quite
anxious to do something constructive but needs
guidance.

I've written Miss Purdy to get in contact
with you before making any false moves, and sug—
gested that the experimental work in schools
would be a virgin field for them to explore.
She has already written to the HSUS, so this

might develop into something/gdtent.

THE READER’S DIGEST

PLEASANTVILLE- NEW YORK
August l3, 1958
Dear Paul:
Thank you for your letter of August 2 sug~
gesting that we develop an article on the subject of

”What Is Humane Slaughter?”

It is a tempting suggestion, but I don‘t
think we will ask you to do it for us now. Let'

s
wait a while and see how well the slaughter houses
proceed with the installation of the new system.

If there is a true reformation, it is
entirely possible that we would like to have a prog—
ress report when the new system has been in operation
for a year or so.

With warm regards,

Sincerely yours,

Here is an advance tear sheet of the article
"How To Broaden Ybur Pet's Mind,“ which will appear in
the February issue of Coronet magazine. This issue will
be released January 16.

If you recall, this is the story I Spoke to you
about a few weeks ago. It's a cute piece and perhaps
you'll find it interesting. Incidentally; as of today,
Coronet has still vetoed the prOSpects of reprints for
the Humane feature...I'll keep you posted.

Please give my best regards to Hrs. Stevens.

Cordially,

%M

Friday

Deer Christine:
Here are a couple of more letters if you
can use them. I'm telling M”. Mosn---
that's the best I can make out of his
signatureI—-—that you will send him the
exact title of the FTC hearings. Will
you?
After several futile triee, ;
Lewis on the phone. He said he would go
into a huddle with Ken Payne and call me
back Monday with a verdict on the humane
slaughter piece.

Cordiaiﬁy,

Dear Estella:

By special Act of the Legislature, we have extended
the "Summer Season" for Watson Hollow Inn through

Christmas, so we will be here until then. This was due
to the good officies of our bossom pal, Senator Wicks.

I am very much surprised at Coronet's attitude about
the reprints and am at a loss to understand it. I am

writing Greenberg to see if I can get any dope and will
let you know.

Enclosed are a few more letters which I thought you

should see, plus a list of names from other letters which
I am sending to Pegeen Fitzgerald's group at the specific

request of Mr. Freshel. These are from the A—V type.

And although they might be worth sendin some literature
to - nice construction, eh? - the ones 'm enclosing are

more your meat. Or shall we say vegetable protein?

I think the prize is the one from Marian Lydecker who
offers that rare commodity, free secretarial service.

Grab her. By strange coincidence, I used to call on
her sister before I was married (naturally) some 35

years ago. How in hell she remembered me over all

these years is be ond me. Thisis your cue to say some—
thing goddamned n ce!

Did you, byhany chance, hear any of the Long John

broadcast? e damned thing went on and.on from 12
midnight until 5:30 AM - and Clare wouldn t let me

pull out and go home so long as Dr. Como was there. I
think we perforated the lit 1e bastid because some

people called in around 5 AM and said that, thanks to

his efforts they were sending some money to the anti-
vivisectionists! {a

MEMO TO: Lew Gillensen
FROM: Paul Kearney

SUBJECT: References on animal experimentation piece.

Here is the material I had put aside to bring in with me yestérday
~~~and forgot in the rush. It adds nothing to what has already been
said, but it give9some support to the premise that this stuff is not
confined to a few progressive schools. Otherwise a laboratory supply
house like Turtox would hardly include materials in its catalog; the
Science Teachers would not bother to make reprints for wide distribution.

Note A merely indicates that the Red Cross was quite active in the
nutritional experiments when the piece was originally written. But
Christine Stevens says that they have since disavowed any connection
when she's talked to them on the phone.

The few newspaper clippings show a fair spread, geographically.

I think it is interesting to note how often the items are handled with

a facetious twist by the reporters. This approach seems to prevail
when they are not utterly awed by the wonderful, wonderful things

these precocious little bastids are doing. Between you and me and

the lamp post, I think children are inherently cruel enough, and the
tendency should be curbed rather than glorified. After all, it doesn't
take much of this to form callouses on a normal person's sensibilities,
purely as a defensive mechanism. Thus it is considered a great joke

in medical school to cut off a cadaver's penis and stick it some other

student's pocket: this is just the instinctive process of hardening

one's self to grim realties.
However, it does seem premature to start this kindof thing in the

fourth and fifth grades.

Will you please return this material when you've scanned it?

Dear Christine:

Here is the letter from Catherine Meyer--—
and, to my surprise, a copy of the Mss., which
must have accompanied her letter. This will
simplify matters considerably for you; it is of
no great help to me because of my complete file
being in Brooklyn. (Of all the tons of stuff I
bring up, there is invariably something missing
which I need before the summer is over.)

In my letter of July 3 I gave her, from memory,
the salient points of the cigarette experiment,
but you may have more specific dates and names.

This has been a hectic summer. As soon as I
am clear of the turnpike book, I've got to start
on a short refresher course on business letter

writing for another publisher who's been on my

neck for two months. L

ta'aﬁand.baak and give tham raam. Far wa-can still find ample apperﬁunity far criticism
in réalms where WE are fully as campetant t9 evaluate as are the yhyaicians.

F9? example, in a typically'inspired article in Coroncet for January, 1955;
under the hitle ﬁAnitivivisection: ﬁ Threat t0»Ybu,“ there is the following stock state»
ment which yvu have aften heard: x N

"A visit tﬁ any such laboratony «w and, contrary to the declrations of

the antiaviviaactimnista, all of them are open'to visitars-will give
convincing proof that ﬁhese animals are wetter fed, better-careﬁ far
and mare affectionately~traated than are many paﬁs in private homea.”
Firstly, the parenthetical clause is less than a halfhtruth. But more impertant,
if the sentence had bean'wordeﬁ, ”A visit to §g§§_§and~picked laboratogies.3 it woulé
not be $0 prepoéﬁerous. As a free lance'writer cf lang tenure, it has bean my let to'
visit quite a ﬂaw such laboratoriwa in'various garts 0f the country; And while 3 have

I can give you a domeu mars examples, but these shoulé be aufficiant t0 gravoke twa

rather pertinent questions:

1. Are the scientists who tolerate such shameful conditians in their laboraoiny
animais' quarfers likely'to ﬁe afar-imbued'with the Lancat’s critgsigﬁ of
necessity? T

2..If they are unaware of such conditions are they really'fib fer research

work?

Far too often, to thwir naive dismay, they see the tedious work of manthS wiped out
whan some epidemic sweeps through the unkempt animal quarters becauge oz€ the negL L.gence
which prevails in so many of them. Going.well beycné this Loinﬁ, Dr. Clive ﬁccay, Frofw
as or of Nutritﬁén of the Departmeni of Animal Hquadxy, Lernell UniVQLLLLy
"my own belief is that much of the dog research of Lhe past is questjexabla because cf
the poor quality of ﬁogs and the poar-hovsing of the expérimental animals.“l

A neutral absarvor Mifht also tend to tahe the pretestation 30f the WS“§ Uiuh less
sal t if its own people came into court with clean hands. In one vitrielic exchange with
this propaganda organlLatLLn, the aforerzzentionad Dr. Gee all (hroaheL oi iale s renowned
Dr. Arnold.Gesell) had this to say:

The Natiﬁnal Society fbr Medical Researﬁh would have ua belieVG that thsre is

Tthere can be no if Laue an‘viViﬁevtion per se. The real and urgent iLsue is

Dear Paul, _ ’ ,
Happy Saint Patrick‘s Day!

I tried to telephone you before I flew to ingland

but learned that you were out of town for the week, so I‘m
writin; you now to express the fervent hope that you are willing
and able to go to Washington on April second to testify in

favor of thguhgagﬁgvslaughter bills before the Sub-Committee

on Livestock of the House Committee on Agriculture.

WM
'}W EEapaﬂe’the bad plccement on the progr m that your

testimony got last yearﬁit Stood gﬁiﬁinﬁﬁggﬁively and has been
widely quoted. It would be tremeniously valuable if you could
give testimony along the same lines or with any new additions which

may occur to you to the House of Representatives. If a good bill

wEfﬁchance of going right through both houses this year.
In order to get that favorable report, we must have first-rate
' testimony. You can give it. We need you badly, ~e éi'it is humanly
possible, I beg you to go. Estella can fill you in with any

' ‘iniormation you may need. How 1 hope that you can be in Washington

on April second and really tehl the committee the things they V

need to knew in the absolutely clear and forceful way that you alaays  

‘present the facts. ’
Best wishes to you and Claire,-

Sincerely,-

,Christine Stevens .

Which Type of Vivisection Do 333 Prefer?

By

 




in a laboratory in New York City in l9h7, 30 dogs were fastened securely to
boards and, after a light anesthesia (“enon h to reduce resistance") were struck from
700 to 1000 blows on each hind leg with a raw-hide mallet. The purpose of the experiment
was to study the effect of shock. One effect was that 2% of the dons died from shock
in from 50 minutes to nine hours. Of the five survivors who were brought into the labora-
tory for a continuation of the test on the following day, three died as soon as they
were strapped on the boards. (The other two died somewhat later.)

This experiment has been defended at length and with varying degrees of
conviction: without engaging in the debate, one point should he made; it is in£ensiblc
that the injured animals were allowed to recover from their “linht anesthesia“ merely
to die from shock.

In another experiment, to does, with all the body hair shaved off, were exposed
to high concentrations of sulfur mustard vapor, or else given subcutaneous injections
of mustards in varying doses. lhe purpose was to see how long the dogs would live after
such treatment, result: the dons survived in agony for from three to five days.

At another laboratory unaesthetized piss (whose skin most resembles man's)vero
burned to death in gasoline fires; other pics and goats were subjected to live steal.or

to dry air temperatures of from 212°to 7s2°to determine just why they died.

"These ominous eXperiment52 says Dr. Robert Gesell, Professor of Physiology, CF?

University of Michivan, "make us search our souls and wonder what the future has in
store for us."

Commenting on these and similar American eXperiments, the renowned British
medical journal, the Langgt, said editorially:

"Most people in Great Britain regard laboratory experiments on animals as an
unpleasant necessity. They accept the practice because so much good has some of it;
but they have ensured by legislation that it shall be used as sparingly as possible,

kept in the hands of those believed to be humane and responsible and safeguarded by

legal restrictions from abuse. There is now a well-grown opinion along scientists one:

 




animals should not be used in large numbers for painful experiments if the facts can be
established equally well by the use of a few. Within this frame of regulations and
customs it is possible to limit painful experiments to a very small proportion of experif
ments as a whole, and to ensure that the sufferinc experienced is not severe or prolonged.

"In other Western European countries, and in America, though most scientists
doubtless impose on themselves the same humane scale of values, there are not the can.
strincent legal safeguards. It will always happen that the tough-minded and the tender-
minded will differ over what constitutes sufferinc for others, whether humans or animal].
Charles Uarwin held that to inflict any pain which is not absolutely necessary deserves
'detestation and abhorrence,‘ and all research~workers of integrity subscribe to this
judgment. They know that to apply the criterion of necessity calls for unremitting care
and attention; but they also knew that it can and must be done. Since the pursuit of
a new fact can sometimes engross the mini alnbst completely, they recogniseizhat they
xmzst always be on ‘uard; and that wherever their keenness may have impaired their sense
of proportion trey should seek the help and criticism of colleaaues. In the cases cited
by our correspondents (of the docs who were beaten to death) and others the essential
criterion was not applied."

The "essential criterion" was not applied by the American scientists who devised

such ingenious projects as spinninv cats incessantly in a revolving cylinder for hB to

72 hours until death intervened; as administerino subcutaneous injections of turpentine

to dogs and studying their sufferine for seven to ll days before destructiono

In one scientific investigation, seven does which had been surgically "debarkod,'

L,

were kept in a chronic state of fear for six months by means of electric shocks trans— l‘“

 

mitted throurh their metal cages (six per hour for each 12-hour day, plus "intermittent
stinulations" at nieht) to determine the effect of chronic fear on the gastric secretion.
In still another study, groups of conscious laboratory rats, paws bound together, were
dropped for varying distances in a speciallybdevised drum.h0 times per minute until dead.
One group was subjected to 700 falls in 17 minutes; the other to 800 falls in 20 minutes. 'J

All died in less than an hour.

 




Perhaps the classic case of all was the recent study Ln which continuous streams
‘ of cigarette smoke were blown against rabbits' eyeballs to ascertain -- for advertising
purposes -~ whether tobacco containin” glycol caused more damace to tissue than that
containing glycerin. (The tests did not prove that either type of tobacco is beneficial
to the eyes.)

Neither did further experiments by the same tobacco company, prove that smoke
is good for the lunes. In one experiment tobacco smoke was pumped throngh dogs' nostril!
until a more dilieent researcher contrived the idea 0? cutting holes in rabbits' tracheal
to smoke could be pumped directly into the lungs. Most of the animals died during the
experiment.

Engaged in this scientific travesty were 12 topwflieht H.D.'8, (only'cne of
whom anesthetized the animals he used). More than 230 animals were involved; in Iain
cases 1%“ different tests were made for a sincle determination. The end results?

After six vears of this “scientific resetrch" the inquiry proved so abortivo
that, on January 23, lQGE, the Federal Trade Commission filed an order prohibiting the
further use of this "unfair and misleading" iata in cigarette advertising!

These and the other ”ominous experiments" were performed in some of the forenost
Anmmican instituticns of learning includinz: Columbia, Harvard and McGill Universities)

the Universities of Illinois and of Virginia; New York Polyclinic medical School; NC!

York University Medical School; the University of Chicago; and Sinai Hospital, Htltﬂlmntg

The question raised by these expefiments is not an easy one. Where is the line
to be drawn between "necessary" experiments on living animals and those which involve too
nmch suffering for too little purpose? To raise the question is not to bring up the old
bug—a—boo of anti-viviaection.

The case for nocessagz and - so far as possible - hunang vivisection III settled
lone ago. As a result of the successful and intelligent experiments on living anilnls
American medical science has made much of itsnoteworthy'advance.

But there is no possible doubt that far too much cruelty is being inflicted an

helpless animals under the guise of "scientific investivation.”

 




Where is the line to be drawn?

To guide then.Anerican scientists have the example of their British colleagues.

In Ehgland no scientist would dream of inflicting the kind or wanton cruelty described in thusq
experiments. If he did dream of it he would not be permitted to carry it out. If, by
accident, he were to carry it out no reputable medical society or journal would publish

a paper based on such a scientific travesty.

, England, unquestionably, is the most enlightened spot on the world map of aninal
experimentation. It has been so for nearly a century. This did not happen sudl-nlys
it was a gradual development which reached a clinax back in 1863 when British papers
reported accounts of brutal experiments which French veterinary students were requirtd
to perform on horses. Five hundred British veterinarians signed a protest which,
conveyed to France, ended.the practice.

As a result of this incident the British began to discuss Buys and leans of
avoiding such cruelty in their own midst. One of the pioneer anti—vivisectionists,
Miss Frances Power Cobbe, took up the cudgels for outright abolition. The leading
scientists flatly opposed abolition but, under her prodding, they dreW'up a standard
procedure for animal experimentation. Their goal was a formula which would protect
the integrity'of science and yet provide the maxinwn of safeguards for the anilals.
Prominent among those iho drew up the original code were Charles Darwin, Tho-as Earls,

andAJanner. The petition they and their colleagues presented won the enthusiastic

I

support of such personages as Queen Victoria, Cardinal Manning, Alfrad Tennyson and

Thomas Carlyle. In 1876 this petition became lav. The now famous Cruelty totlnilals
Act, under which British science has operated.to this day, has provided British
aedical science with its enviable record of both huncneness and achieve-ant.
What can our can scientists learn from this example?
Briefly, the Act vests in.the Heme Scretary the power to grant or withhill.licunsa
for the exploynent of anilnls in experimental research. Thus if a scientist‘lants to
7.5""? conduct an experiment on a living animal he states the purpose of the experiment,

In all the rest of the civilised world only two other countries have comparable
regulations, backed by police power: Switzerland and Sweden. Denmark has a regulatory’
las,'but no inspectors; Belgium has an ordinance which approaches but does not equal
Sweden's; Holland has a voluntary arrangement in which the Netherlands Society for
the Protection of.Lninals has an inportant voice. Israel is contesplating such a
law and has recently asked Britain for counsel.

In the United States and Canada, science is at present high on the pedestal
of public adulation. Crowned with a hale of lay faith, it can do no wrong} it is
free from all interference. Yet, as we have seen, some strange and hideous experi-onts
are conducted on the vague and sometimes false notion that they are furthering the
cause of science.

In contrast to his British colleagues the American scientist is answerable to no
laws, federal, state or local. He is accountable only to his own conscience, and,
as we have seen his conscience and his humane instincts are all too often suppressed
in favor of scientific zeal.

But it was the overworked conscience of the British scientists which produced
the Cruelty'to.Animals Act, and there are signs that the conscience of the Alerican
scientist is open to appeal.

Thirty years ago a nilitantly compassionate woman, Carolyn Verhoeff, found
deplorable conditions in animal experimentatisn in her city of Louisville, Ky. Single»
handed, she went to war. Her first move was to gain the appointsont as director of the
Innicipal pound from which condemned animals were required to be delivered to accredited
laboratories upon demand. Her second move was to descend upon the officials of the
University at Louisville Medical School to protest against the inhunane treat-lat of
experimental animals. In her soft southern accent, she tried to reasan'vith'hhl esjele
the faculty members; when this failed to pay off, she ranted and badgered.until‘they
began to dread the sight of her. She flatly refused to deliver aninals from the pound,
lav or no law; unless they'allewed her to accolpany thes.to the laboratory to see thst
there was as needless, preventable suffering in the experinents; that anesthesia Ins

properly used; that domed ani-als were painlessly killed before recovering tree the anesthesia

   




-7-

Gradually Carolyn Verhoeff‘s crusade began to make sense to the doctors. They

found that their can work benefited as they adopted her humane point of View and their
animosity gradually gave way to respect. Today, in Louisville, with infinitely more
experimental work going on, there is far less needless suffering. The criterion of
the pain factor has gained acceptance.

Now, before any experimenter, student or graduate, embarks upon an animal project,
qualified colleagues are consulted. Thanks to Miss Verhoeff scientists at the University
of Louisville have their own "curelty to animals code." It has worked so well that
when the new Veteran‘s Hospital was recently opened there, its far-sighted director
asked her to set up a similar program for his institution! Today Carolyn Vsrhoeff
is one of the most admired women in Kentucky; She still refuses to surrender any
claimed animals (doomed to death by law) unless the scientists indicate their full
acceptance of the restrictions implied by humane treatment. And she, and.her co-
workers, still retain and use the privilege of staying with any animal through any
experiment —- or to visit the 13boratories unannounced at any hour of the day or night.
(In contrast, New York‘s new Hatch-hetcalf Law authorizes inspectinns only by the State
Health Department --- whose medical tieuin vitiates the mole purpose of outside
supervision.)

What Miss Vsrhoeff has achieved in Louisville has been accomplished on a broads!
basis in British Columbia by a former Canadian army officer and noted horseman, Dnvid
Ricardo. Upon his return from World War II Ricerdo‘was persuaded to take over the VancouVIr
branch of the provincial S.P.C.A. Being a rational humanitarian, Ricardo not the
problem of animal experimentation in a rational any.

Through repeated personal interviews and correspondence, he sold the medical
then on the common sense doctrine of Bunanity in their work with annuals. Although
he had no legal restrictions to back him, he instilled in the scientists a respect for
the British attitude. He also convinced then of the value of he BritiSh belief that
the vtlue of scientific work can be inpaired.if the pain factor is not eliminated. B. ‘

s-phnsised the taunting public resentment to recurrunt accounts of what seen.to b0

 




frivolous, needless experiments, pointing out that in sheer self~defense of their essential
studies the scientists would do well to police themselves beyond reproach. He offered
scientists the cooperation of his S.P.CuA., as a sympathetically informed'but impartial
body. The result has been a formal agreement under which the principles and spirit
of the English law are voluntarily aooepted.
lb most intelligent observers, the humanitarians seem to be on the right track ~-
moving along a middle road between the antimvivisectionists, who want no animal
experimentation, and the extremists among the scientists, who want no interference
or supervision. Mejor Charles N. Hume, director of the Universities Federation for
Animal Welfare, London, has summed up the position of those who find themselves
between the two extremes. In his valuable treatise, "How to Befriend Laboratory'lninnll,'
Major Hume writes: "Sentient creatures are something more than mere experimental
material, like test tubes. They deserve all the techniques of anesthesia and euthanasia;
operative skill and post-operative care." In the United States Major Hume's attitude
is echoed by Dr. Dwight J. Ingle, of the Upjohn Company, Kalamazoo, Mich., which does
an enormous amount of experimental work: "I am.in sympathy with any organisation,”
writes Dr. Ingle, "which seeks to promote the humane tr atment of animals while at the
same time recognizing the essentials of animal experimentation in biology and medicine.
"I believe that laboratories engaged in animal experimentation should be required
by law to meet intelligent requirements of humane care.“
The time is long past due for American scientists to follow the lead set by
their illustrious predecessors in Britain. The exercised consciences of Charles Dariil

and Julian Huxley blazed the trail to an enlightened combination of hunsnity and 8010300.

For 90 years this course has been clearly mapped. .All we need to do is follov'it.

the issues were roughly similar to those of
the steel case. The panel’s Curtiss-Wright
decision recommended an average 14.4¢
pay boost for the workers, 2.4¢ more than
the C.I.~O. had offered to settle for during
a strike. But if steelmen get a similar
ﬁnding, they will insist that the DPS
grant a corresponding boost in prices. So
it looked as if Mrs. Celinsky and the
whole U.S., willy-nilly, were bound to have
just one more drink in the corner saloon.

ADVERTISING
In a Rabbit's Eye

The Federal Trade Commission has de-
veloped a slow burn over the claims of
U.S. cigarette manufacturers. In two years,
it has forbidden Old Golds to claim that
they contain less nicotine, Camels that
they aid digestion or relieve fatigue,
Luckies that they are preferred by men
who know tobacco best. Last week FTC
turned its beady eye on Philip Morris,
which advertises “no cigarette hangover”
because its cigarettes are “deﬁnitely less
irritating.”

At stake was Philip Morris’ chief stock
in trade. In 18 years, its sales have shot
from $2.6 million to $305 million, largely
on the strength of the fact that Philip
Morris uses diethylene glycol (instead of
glycerin) as a moistening agent. It has
persuaded thousands of smokers, in its
famous “nose test,” that consequently
Philip Morris cigarettes are less irritating.
As evidence, Philip Morris presented the
FTC with testimony from doctors, re-
searchers and others who reported on
“scientiﬁc” tests as far back as 1934. For
every expert brought in by Philip Morris,
competitors and U.S. glycerin manufac-
turers popped up their own counter-experts.

The stars of the tests were rabbits, the
cigarette makers’ favorite subjects for ir-
ritation experiments. Philip Morris, for
example, bubbled smoke of different brands
of cigarettes through water, then dripped
the solution on to a rabbit’s eyelids. It
claimed Philip Morris smoke produced less
irritation. Rivals made more direct tests.
They developed smoking machines and
eyecups to blow smoke smack against the
rabbit’s eyelid, claimed they found no
measurable differences in brands. To meas-
ure the amount of swelling caused by pro-
tective ﬂuids rushing into the smoke-
ﬁlled eyes,* testers even trimmed off the
upper lids, weighed the membranous lin-
ings, then dried them in an oven, and
weighed them again. FTC ruled this test
out. Philip Morris cut holes in rabbits’
tracheas to pump smoke into their lungs
(ﬁve of the rabbits died, but Philip Mor-
ris says they were smoking rival brands).
Competitors pumped smoke through the
noses of dogs to see if nasal passages were
irritated enough to cause obstruction.

But none of the tests impressed FTC. ‘

=z= Nonsmokers, whose eyes usually catch most of
the smoke from burning cigarettes in the gestur-
ing hands of companions, learned something else
from the tests: the smarting sensation is caused
by gaseous ammonia rising from the burning tip.
The smoker usually doesn’t get it because the
ammonia passes through the cigarette in a non-
irritating salt form.

STATE OF BUSINESS

, Mrs. CeIinsky & ’rhe Saloon

In Manhattan last week, Jones & Laugh-
lin Steel Corp.’s Chairman Ben Moreell
stood up before a special Wage Stabiliza-
tion Board panel which is trying to de-
cide if 650,000 of the nation’s steelwork-
ers are entitled to another wage boost.
Said Admiral Moreell (ret.): the union’s
demand for an 18% raise plus fringe bene-
ﬁts which are estimated to bring the total
raise up to 50¢ an hour would set off
such a wave of rising prices that it would
probably cost Jones & Laughlin $95 mil-
lion a year, $10 million more than all of
its 1951 earnings. Then C.I.O. President
- Philip Murray’s sharp Scottish tongue
out in.

In mock alarm at the inﬂationary con-
sequences of wage boosts, Murray pointed
out that Jones & Laughlin Vice President
Charles L. Austin, who was made Presi-
dent two weeks ago, recently was raised
from $55,000 to $70,000. How did Moreell
justify this raise under the circumstances?
“Phil,” cried Moreell, who is personally
fond of Murray, “that is one of the best
things I have done!” Snapped Murray: “If
it’s good for Mr. Austin, why isn’t it good
for Joe Doakes? . . . Now Admiral, do
you think that Mrs. Celinsky, over on the
South Side, gets any more groceries in her
market basket as a result of Mr. Austin’s
wage increases?” Moreell stoutly insisted
that all of his employees, including the
husband of the hypothetical Mrs. Celin-
sky, had beneﬁted from Austin’s executive
ability. “Mrs. Celinsky,” he added, “will
continue to proﬁt as a result.”

Does Anybody Win? Mrs. Celinsky’s
market basket was indeed the center of
the long verbal war before the WSB’s
fact-ﬁnding panel. Was the basket, as
Murray claimed, too scant for the growing
output of her steelworker husband? Or
would it, as' Moreell and the industry
argued, actually shrink—in spite of high-
er wages—because of higher prices that
would result from them?

Over the weeks, Murray had argued the
union’s case. Not wages but “proﬁteering,
speculation, hoarding” had driven up
prices, he insisted. Wages rose only 7.6%
nine months after Korea, said Murray,

while the wholesale prices of semi-ﬁnished-

goods rose 26.3%. Since 1945, Big Steel’s
proﬁts after taxes had risen 209%, while

JONES & LAUGHLIN’s MO‘REELL

wages rose 58%. Moreover, the industry,
which has already raised its prices 80% in
the same period, did not need another
price boost to meet the wage demands. It
could pay them from proﬁts.

The union also wanted the union shop,
eight paid holidays a year, paid vacations
ranging up to four weeks after 15 years,
and a guaranteed annual wage, i.e., 30
hours’ work a week for 52 weeks for work-
ers with three or more, years of service.
The 650,000 steelworkers were not de-
manding “a larger share of the economic
pie,” but only what they considered a fair

U.S. STEEL’S FAIRLESS & C.I.O.’s MURRAY
Why not sweor off?

share. Where 47¢ of each $1 of steel sales
went for wages ﬁve years ago, labor’s
share is now but 39¢. Said Murray: “It
has been whittled down crumb by crumb
like the food at a third-rate boarding
house.”

The Economic Jag. President Ben
Fairless of U.S. Steel, whose policies usu-
ally set the pace for the whole industry,
had an earthy simile of his own to match
Murray’s boarding house. The U.S., said
F airless, has “been acting like the man in
the corner saloon. We’ve been telling our-
selves that we’ll have just one more little
shot of inﬂation and that tomorrow we’ll
swear off . . . All of us know in our hearts
. . . that somehow, some time, we’ve got
to stop this economic jag.”

Fairless dismissed the annual wage
guarantee as a “demand that we shall pay
large sums for no work at all.” He chal-
lenged Murray’s charts of lagging wages.
“The pay, the beneﬁts and the living
standards-of our employees,” said Fairless,
“have gone up . . . vastly in excess of any
increase in productivity . . . far beyond
any increase in the cost of living . . . Our
steelworkers’ wages are far above the av-
erage pay of American industrial workers
generally.” (The industry’s ﬁgures: steel
wages have risen an average of 60% since
1945—t0 $75 a week—while the cost of
living was rising 45%.)

All of the union’s demands, if granted,
would exceed $1,000 per year per em-

ployee, and would cut deepest, not into

proﬁts but into the taxes now paid to the
U.S. Government. If a policy of pay raises
without price rises spreads to all U.S. in-
dustry, Fairless estimated that the federal
Treasury would lose $11 billion in cor-
porate taxes that could only be made up
by raising other kinds of taxes. Warning
that nobody gets something for nothing,
Fairless asked: “Should we rob Peter to
pay Phil?”

Against the argument that the industry
can “absorb” the wage boosts without

. higher prices, Fairless cited U.S. Steel’s

15% drop in dividends in 1951, the bite
of taxes which left 17% 0 less proﬁts to
plow into the huge expansion needed for
U.S. security. “The real issue at stake,”
said Fairless, “is whether the economic
stabilization program . . . is to be main-
tained . . . We are all in this boat to-
gether, and we cannot afford to scuttle
any part of it.”

It will be another two weeks or more
before the panel makes its ﬁndings. Ac-
tually, the question is not whether there
will be a wage raise, but how much. Under
the WSB’s own formula, the union is en-
titled to perhaps 99* an hour as a cost-of-
living rise alone, plus an0ther 5¢ that
could be allowed for increased productiv-
ity. Last week Yale’s Law Professor Har-
ry IShulman, chairman of the steel wage
panel, gave a likely preview of things to
come. He had also been chairman of a
similar panel in the dispute between the

LARGE LOSS FIRES OF 1951

tion accounted for two other large loss
ﬁres. In both cases the ﬁres originated in
unsprinklered areas and the losses must be
attributed to the failure of the owners to
provide the full protection required. One
ancient dry pipe valve failed to operate
properly in a Chicago tenant manufactur—
ing building which sustained a $733, 000
loss as sprinklers were denied water.

Four large loss ﬁres occurred in prop—
erties protected by automatic detection
equipment. All systems functioned to
summon ﬁre departments, but for one rea-
son or another, effective manual ﬁre ﬁght—
ing could not be accomplished in time to
prevent these heavy losses, aggregating
$1,499,500. In at least two cases evidence
is quite conclusive that smoldering ﬁres
did not generate heat at a sufﬁcient rate to
activate promptly the installed rate-of-rise
protectlon systems.

Other private protection weaknesses
showed up, particularly the lack of well
organized ﬁre brigades suitable special ex—
tinguishing systems for special hazards and
the lack of portable ﬁre extinguishers. In
35 cases, it is judged that the ﬁres were too
advanced when discovered for effective use
of portable extinguishers.

Character of Contents Influencing Spread

In 58 ﬁres ﬂammable liquids were in-
volved to intensify the rate and spread of
ﬁre in these “large loss” disasters. Flam-
mable liquids were released during these
ﬁres from drums, cans, etc. (32 cases),
from industrial devices (13 cases), from
above ground tanks (8 cases) and from
pipe lines (6 cases). In 42 cases the ﬂash
point of these liquids was below 80°F.

Heavy concentrations of combustible
stocks in single ﬁre areas, poor stock sub—
division and high piling were notable fac—
tors in a large number of cases. Poor
housekeeping conditions, including heavy
accumulations of dusts on beams, girders,
etc c., inﬂuenced ﬁre spread markedly in a
total of 23 cases.

279

Structural Characteristics Influencing Spread

In 60 per cent of the "large loss” build-
ing ﬁres failure to subdivide areas to rea—
sonable dimensions permitted the ﬁre to
reach “large loss” proportions. In 68 per
cent of the building ﬁres, unenclosed stair
or elevator shafts were responsible for
multi-story ﬁres. Among other structural
weaknesses noted were: large undivided
attics (14 ﬁres), combustible ﬁbreboard
interior ﬁnish (8 ﬁres), nonﬁrestopped
concealed ceiling spaces (5 ﬁres), large
undivided basements (4 ﬁres), and lack of
dampers in air conditioning ducts (4

ﬁres).

Windowless buildings and blank walls
restricted freedom of ﬁre department access
to burning interiors in 12 ﬁres. Lack of
basement entry denied access in two in-
stances. Lack of venting facilities handi-
capped ﬁremen in six cases. Property own-
ers, particularly those who do not provide
adequate private ﬁre protection, should be
made to appreciate, before it is too late,
the access requirements of ﬁre departments
answering their calls for help.

Fire Department Activities

There may be a tendency on the part of
the uninformed to place major respon—
sibility for large loss” ﬁres on the ﬁre de-
partment. However, when it is remem—
bered that a large percentage of these ﬁres
were beyond control when discovered, that
many of the properties were located in
areas where water supplies from hydrants
were weak or nonexistent, and that in
other instances ﬁre departments estab-
lished for small town or rural protection
were all that were available, there is little
justiﬁcation for blaming public ﬁre depart-
ments for these ﬁres.

In 43 per cent of the ﬁres extent of ﬁre
on arrival forced the ﬁre department to
concentrate on protecting exposures. Forty
explosions preceding, at the start and dur-
ing the ﬁre complicated ﬁre department
operations, as did heavy smoke conditions
in 17 cases.

 




Fire Gas Research Report
Introductory Sfaiemem‘ by Commi’n‘ee

The large number of ﬁre casualties from the inhalation of noxious products of
combustion, as distinguished from burns sustained in ﬁres, has long been of most
serious concern to the ﬁre protection fraternity. While the danger from ﬂame is
obvious and instinctively avoided, the dangers from breathing smoke, gases pro-
duced in ﬁres, and oxygen deﬁcient atmospheres are often not apparent.

Some phases of this general subject have been a matter of common knowledge
in the ﬁre service, but there has been a long—felt need for more exact technical in-
formation on ﬁre gases, the conditions of their formation in ﬁres, their effects
singly and in combination, and the most effective means for minimizing their
hazard to the lives of occupants of buildings and ﬁre service personnel. In recogni-
tion of this need, the National Fire Protection Association in 1940 initiated a
project for research on ﬁre gases and subsequently received contributions to form
this project. The war period delayed the initiation of the research, but also
yielded additional experience records in wartime ﬁres and incendiary warfare.

The Committee on Fire Gas Research, which was charged by the NFPA Board
of Directors with the responsibility for administering this project, in 1947 con-
cluded arrangements with Arthur D. Little, Inc., consulting chemists and en-
gineers of Cambridge, Mass, to conduct the research. This organization was
selected because members of the staff had participated in wartime research projects
of the Federal government concerned with ﬁres and ﬁre gases. It was originally
hoped that clearance might be obtained to make publication of the resulting data
possible. When it was apparent that such clearance could not be obtained, the
objective of the project was altered to cover a survey and evaluation of informa-
tion obtainable from other sources. This, it was planned, could form the basis for
experimental research at such future time as sufficient funds become available for
the purpose.

A report was submitted to the Committee on Fire Gas Research by Arthur D.
Little, Inc. in 1949. The material in this report has been edited to conform to the
NFPA policy for publications sponsored by them and to make the material more
useful to the ﬁre protection fraternity. The report is presented herewith by the
Committee on Fire Gas Research. Some controversial material contained in the
report submitted by Arthur D. Little, Inc. has been omitted by direction of the
Committee and the editorial changes are those intended to make the terminology
and method of presentation consistent with ﬁre protection practice.

The Committee fully appreciates the need for further research in this ﬁeld and
hopes that a more complete body of technical information on ﬁre gases may even-
tually be developed in the interest of reducing loss of life and personal injury

by ﬁre.

 




NFPA QUARTERLY —— jANUARY 1952

The Effect of Exposure to Hea’r

The systematic disturbances caused by
the impact of heat energy on the surface of
the body was an important cause of dis-
ability and death in World War II. This
led to a recognition of the importance of
knowing the thermal tolerance of living
tissues and the natureof somatic and cellu—
lar changes induced by hyperthermia.
(This latter term is used to indicate an in-
crease of general body temperature above
the normal level of 98.6°F or 37°C.)
Hyperthermia, if sufficiently elevated,
leads to irreversible cellular injury. There
is a reciprocal relationship of time and
temperature in the production of either
systemic or cutaneous injury by heat. An
additional relationship exists between the
environmental or ambient heat, surface
temperature, the thermal gradient through
the skin, the pathogenesis of cutaneous
burns and the physiological mechanisms
by which external heat may be responsible
for acute disability or death.

Thermal injury may be due to ﬂame, to
hot air, to superheated combustion prod—
ucts, or to live steam (above 212°F).
When actual burning is limited or absent,
hyperthermia may cause damage to the
cardioregulatory centers of the brain and
produce such rapid organization of ventri-
cular ﬁbrillation that death is immediate.
This is probably what happens in ﬂash
ﬁres where excessively high ambient tem—
peratures are produced for extremely short
periods (i.e., 0.1-1.0 second). Approxi-
mately 3 cal. /sq.cm. /mi~nute can be ab-
sorbed by unprotected human skin. How-
ever, heat can be lost by the vaporization of
surface moisture at the rate of 1 cal. /-
sq.cm./minute. Man’s threshold to cuta—

neous injury may be between 1 and 2 cal. / —
sq.cm./minute.

The experimental investigation of the
causes of injury and death resulting from
ﬁres meets such complex phenomena that
absolute answers are not possible. Certain
factual observations can be recorded but
the understanding of the physiological me-
chanisms and structures involved is, in
many cases, a matter only of conjecture.
The understanding of causes and relation-
ships is of utmost importance in relation to
protection from injury, prevention of
death, or treatment of persons who suffer
injury and disabilities.

The variables which are common to all
conﬂagrations are few; it is only by expe—
rimental and controlled studies (which
eventually lose their academic features)
that discreet bits of information can be
ﬁtted into a pattern. Some of the variables
are chemical, others are physical and as in
all investigations involving living persons
or animals the factors of individual resist-
ance and susceptibility complicate the pic-
ture to an inﬁnite degree.

The chief physical variable which is re—
lated to the production of injury is intens-
ity of heat. This may exist in a wet or dry
atmosphere and the damage done will be
modiﬁed accordingly. The proximity of
the source of heat to exposed subjects, the
maximum temperature attained, the venti—
lation and oxygen supply, the accumula—
tion of carbon dioxide, the presence of car-
bon monoxide and other toxic gases. will
similarly affect the extent of injury which
may be sustained. Protection against these
factors can be afforded in a variety of ways

 




FIRE GAS RESEARCH REPORT

but not any is completely adequate. Pro-
tective clothing masks and general psycho-
logical, physiological and constitutional re-
sistance including ability to sweat and
range of tolerance of the cardio-vaseular
system are prominent among the factors
which may limit injury or prevent death.

The studies of Dr. Alan R. Moritz and
his associates of Harvard Medical School
which have been published since 1945 are
the best source of information at our com-
mand in reviewing this problem. The
work of Moritz et al arose from the need
for such information by the Armed Forces
during World War II and their experi-
mental work utilized animals of various
species.

In general, exposure was to various
types and intensities of heat under con-
trolled conditions. The routes of exposure
were either by inhalation of superheated
air (either dry or moist) or by exposure of
the body surface (cutaneous). In some
cases, exposure was of both types. The
effects noted were either local or super-
ficial injuries or those affecting the entire
body and developing only when the gen-
eral temperature of the body was raised.
As a result of mathematical analysis of
some of Moritz’ data, it is possible to pre-
dict the probability and extent of injury to
the body surface for various temperature
ranges.

The physical laws which relate to heat.

transfer are of great importance in relation
to the passage of heat through the skin at
different skin temperatures. The effect of
different rates of heat transfer on the sub-
surface temperature gradient of the skin
are not greatly different than through
other materials of the same density, con-
sistency and general type. There is a modi—

283

fying factor which operates as a cooling
and therefore a limiting mechanism, i.e.,
the blood vessels of several diameters with
which the skin is well supplied and which
serve to carry away from the area a surpris-
ingly large quantum of heat. In fact, this
is a function of blood which is too little
appreciated in the light of its importance
in the maintenance of temperature con-
stancy of the entire body.

One disadvantage inherent in all expe—
rimental physiology related to heat transfer
lies in the fact that no readily available ex-
perimental animal has sweat glands which
resemble those of man and which facilitate
heat loss by vaporization. For example,
man can lose approximately one liter of
ﬂuid per hour via the skin under extreme
conditions and this results in dissipation of
0.5—1.0 calories per square centimeter per
minute. The animal whose skin resembles
that of man most closely in reaction to heat
is the young domestic pig yet the maxi-
mum heat loss by vaporization at the body
surface is of the order of 0.1 calories per
square centimeter per minute or approxi-
mately one-fifth to one-tenth that of man.
The thickness, cellular structure and blood
supply of the young pig’s skin is compar-
able to that of man and for that reason, the
species has often been used as a test animal
in experimental work related to heat.

The heat capacity of porcine skin (the
amount of heat needed to raise the tem—
perature of 1 gram by 1°C) is about 0.7
calory. For comparison, the heat capacity
of water is 1.0 calory / gram /degree centi-
grade and that of metallic silver is .06
calory/gram/degree. This ﬁgure is the
average of the heat capacities of the com-
ponents of skin, z'.e., epidermis, dermis, fat
and muscle. (See Appendix for detailed
description of skin structure.)

 




284

The conductivity of skin or the rate of
heat transfer determines the degree to
which the skin will be burned by the appli-
cation of heat. If the heat can be rapidly
carried from a given site, burning will be
less than if insulating factors hold it there.
This shows the essential relationship be-
tween duration of exposure and intensity
of heat. Such a factor is not easy to deter-
mine except under artificial conditions but
in who determinations show the general
relationship.

Immediately after exposure to heat the
body surface becomes ”heat—saturated” fol-
lowing which the rise in local temperature
is slower. The secondary response to heat
by the body surface is the accumulation of
body ﬂuids between dermis and epidermis,
z'.e., ”blistering.” The ﬂuids tend to slow
down heat absorption.

Heat from burning material can be con-
veyed to the body surface by air conduc—
tion, air convection or by infra-red radia-
tion. The rate of transfer through air is
much more rapid than through the skin
itself. It has been maintained that the re—
lease of toxic breakdown products after
burns which terminate fatally may be the
cause of death. The evidence to support
this is of a contradictory nature and the
concept does not seem to be well substan-
tiated.

Systemic Effects of Hyperthermia

The exposure of the body surface to ex—
cessive heat may cause rapid circulatory
failure and death. This is brought about
by two mechanisms. In one, the systemic
hyperthermia caused by conduction of heat
to the interior of the body via the blood
stream leads to a rapid and progressive de-
dine in blood pressure and failure of cir-
culation due principally to peripheral vas—

NFPA *QUARTERLY— jANUARY 1952

cular collapse. In the other, circulatory
failure is chieﬂy caused by changes in the
central nervous system and may be due to
the effect of an excessively high blood
plasma—potassium concentration on the
heart. Circulatory failure originating in
the central nervous system is likely to occur
when overheating of skin and subcuta-
neous tissues is so intense, prolonged and
generalized that potassium is released from
the red blood cells rapidly and in such
large amounts as to result in maintained
plasma levels in excess of 11 milliequival-
ents of potassium per liter of blood.

In cases of thermal exposures of low in-
tensity, peripheral circulatory failure may
occur without sufficient rise in tissue and
blood temperature to cause a dangerous
rise in plasma potassium. When the ther-
mal exposure has been sufficiently severe to
cause fatal hyperpotassemia, the central cir—
culatory effects are likely to be complicated
by peripheral vascular collapse. Before
potassium poisoning following exposure to
heat can occur, the red blood cells must
have a high original concentration of this
element. Thus, fatal hyperpotassemia can
not occur in the dog which normally has a
low basal potassium level. Man and pig
have a similar blood potassium level and
so are similarly susceptible to the develop—
ment of fatal levels in the blood. Although
thermal exposure may alter respiration,
death may occur in spite of artiﬁcial respi—
ration and this treatment does not prolong
the survival period after exposure to heat.

Thus, failure of the heart induced by an
accumulation of potassium from over-
heated red blood cells may produce death;
the secondary mechanism is a systemic
effect caused by conduction of heat to the
interior of the body producing initially
peripheral vascular collapse which eventu—

ally affects the heart after loss of ﬂuid in
the capillary beds. This does not occur

unless the peripheral vessels are greatly
dilated.

In summary, the systemic disturbances
noted in experimental hyperthermia in-
clude:

(1) An increase in rectal and blood tem.
peratures although these are not as persist-
ent as during sunstroke in human subjects.

(2) Intravascular hemolysis but this is not
the determining factor in survival since it
is not seen in death from hyperthermia fol—
lowing low intensity exposures.

(3) The blood, following high intensity
exposure, shows microcytosis and break—
down of red blood cells.

(4) An increase in clotting time and
fragility of red cells in badly burned sub-
jects.

(5) An increase in plasma turbidity to-
gether with formation of agglomerates of
protein and enmeshed cells in wet blood
smears (seen in fatally burned animals).

(6) A rise in blood pressure and respira—
tory rates within a few seconds of ex-
posure. The blood pressure then falls to
subnormal levels but the respiration re-
mains rapid until after the exposure ceases.

(7) There are abnormalities of the elec-
trocardiogram some appearing soon after
the beginning of the exposure and some
developing after the onset of circulatory
failure. These include increased rate, de—
creased voltage of the QRS complex, in-
verted T wave and ventricular extrasys-
toles. Ventricular tachycardia, ﬁbrillation
and death occur after long exposure.

(8) The blood potassium concentration is
increased and may be 4-6 times the normal
level. This suggests the possibility of

acute potassium poisoning as a cause of
death.

(9) Pathological ﬁndings include skin
burns, subendocardial hemorrhage and de-
generative changes in the liver and adrenal
cortex.

Two animal experiments of Dutra and
Moritz may be cited to demonstrate the re-

285

lative effects of heat and carbon monoxide
and their relative, lethality. In the ﬁrst ex—
periment, a young pig was exposed to
burning gasoline in a sealed chamber. The
ﬁre was smothered in 30 seconds, but the
pig was exposed for ﬁve additional min-
utes. The maximum temperature attained
was 320°C or 608°F. Immediately after
the ﬁre burned out the atmosphere
breathed by the animal contained 15.5 per-
cent oxygen, 3.9 percent carbon dioxide,
0.8 percent carbon monoxide.

In contrast, the expired air contained
16.3 percent oxygen, 4.0 percent carbon
dioxide; the alveolar air contained 14.2 .
percent oxygen, 5.5 percent carbon mon- '
oxide. Normal expired air contains 19.7
percent oxygen, 0.8 percent carbon di-
oxide. The pig’s blood was 33 percent
saturated with carbon monoxide. When
sacriﬁced 6 hours later, no pathological
changes were found in the respiratory sys-
tem.

In the second experiment, a pig of ap-
proximately the same size and age was ex- ,
posed 40 seconds to the combustion of
gasoline which raised the temperature to
300°C. Death occurred in 2 minutes. The
blood was only 8 percent saturated with
carbon monoxide, benimngmapparently so
limited because of the rapidity of death.

The gas in the chamber was analyzed
and found to contain 16.2 percent oxygen,
4.0 percent carbon dioxide, 0.8 percent
carbon monoxide. At autopsy, the out-
standing ﬁndings were pharyngeal edema
cOnsistent with systemic hyperthermia. The
mouth and pharynx were badly burned,
leading to an obstructive edema. The
trachea contained much mucus and carbon
particles and the lungs were engorged with
blood. The steam at 210°F caused more
damage in the latter experiment than did
ﬂame at 900°F in the ﬁrst experiment due

 




286

I to the greater liberation of heat by the
steam. In other experiments, hot air at
347°F and 563°F caused similar swelling,
. edema and death from asphyxiation. The
mechanism in all the animals in this series

was an acute obstructive edema.

Classiﬁcation of Burns

Burns of the skin are said to be of either
ﬁrst, second or third degree intensity. In
ﬁrst degree burns, there is no destruction
of tissue or irreversible damage. Redness
(hyperemia) or accumulation of blood in
the subcutaneous tissues is the most promi-
nent sign. In second degree burns, there is
complete destruction of the epidermis or
superﬁcial layers with separation from the
dermis and accumulation of tissue ﬂuid be-
tween the layers ("blistering”). In burns
of the third degree, there is complete de—
struction of both important layers of skin
(dermis and epidermis), which is not re-
versible. The ﬂesh is raw and an open
wound, highly susceptible to infection, is
produced. If third degree burns involve
more than one-third of the body surface
they are generally fatal but survival from
second degree burns covering more than
80 percent of the body are reported.

When skin is burned with hot water, the
severity of burning depends largely on the
extent of skin temperature rise and dura—
tion of the elevated skin temperature. The
microscopic pathological picture may vary
from no visible cell changes to complete
destruction. If repeated ﬁrst degree burns
occur in the same site, microscopic changes
may occur. The time required for healing
varies directly with the time and tempera—
ture needed to injure.

In early, mild burns, the ﬁrst visible
change involves swelling of the cell nuclei
with redistribution of the chromatin mate-

N F PA QUARTERLY —— JANUARY 1 95 2

rial. Further injury involves pyknosis (cell
shrinkage), swelling of the cytoplasm and
fragmentation of cells. The detachment of
epidermis from dermis (blistering) in-
volves changes in the basal epidermal cell
layer or in the cement substance. When
the temperature producing burns exceeds
131°F, coagulation of tissue ﬂuids occurs.
If the temperature change is rapid, it
masks nuclear swelling and disintegration
of cytoplasm. Desiccation and carboniza-
tion (charring) is the ﬁnal step in the dis-
integration of the superﬁcial skin layers.

When deeper (dermal) layers of skin
are involved, the blood vessels constrict
and then dilate immediately. If the heat
rise is rapid, the blood vessels remain con-
stricted and dilation is seen only in the
deepest and best protected layers of skin.
Other changes involve the accumulation of
tissue ﬂuid (edema) due to dilation of the
small blood vessels and increased perme-
ability which permits leakage of blood
plasma into the tissues.

If, in a reasonably intense exposure to
heat in man, blistering or vesication does
not occur, it may indicate that (a) the heat
was not sufﬁcient to increase the perme-
ability of local blood vessels or (b) there
was insufﬁcient exposure time to allow the
ﬂuid to collect, or (c) the blood ﬂow
ceased in the area possibly due to overheat-
ing, or (d) no dilation of the local blood
vessels occurred, due to their insensitivity.

Even very low skin temperatures, if ele—
vated above normal will cause burns (eg,
111°F for 6 hours) if the temperature is
sustained long enough. The severity of
skin burns is not an index of the severity of
systemic disturbances. Deaths from ele—
vated body temperatures may occur after
long exposure to low intensity heat
sources, but short exposure to high tem-
peratures does not necessarily elevate the

 




288

portant contributory factor in death from
ﬂame, it is probably not the most impor—
tant one. If burning of the skin is exten-
sive, in non-fatal cases there is a loss of
protection ordinarily afforded by the skin
against ﬂuid loss and infection.

In experiments in which anesthetized
animals were made to inhale ﬂame, hot air
and live steam from a blast burner by in-
serting a tube directly into the windpipe, it
was found that dry heat was rapidly dissi—
pated in transit to the lungs. There was
drop in temperature from 719°F to 181°F
in the lower trachea while steam cooled
only to 167°F from 212°F (or 80% drop
with dry heat and 20% drop with steam).
Post mortem examination showed that
ﬂame and hot air lost too much of their
heat while traversing the trachea to burn
the lung tissue and the lower trachea was
only mildly burned if at all.

Steam, even though at a much lower
temperature than hot, dry air, caused
severe injury along the entire length of the
trachea and in the lungs. The type of in-
jury was a hemorrhagic edema with or
without dilation of the large and small
bronchi. All types of injury seemed to pre—
dispose to the development of broncho-
pneumonia. When hot air was not led by
cannula beyond the glottis, edema devel—
oped here and death followed from ob-
structive asphyxiation.

The Effect of Oxygen Lack

The absorption of oxygen into the blood
from the lungs is subject to the same phys-
ical laws which govern the passage of gases
through semi-permeable membranes wher-
ever found. In atmospheres in which the
oxygen is reduced to 12-15 percent, mus-
cular coordination for skilled movements
is disturbed; between 10 and 14 percent,
consciousness continues but judgment is
faulty and muscular eﬂ'ort leads to rapid

NF PA QUARTERLY — jANUARY 1952

fatigue. Below 6 percent, breathing ceases.
When only 6 to 10 percent oxygen is pres-
ent, collapse occurs quickly but rapid treat-
ment will prevent fatal outcome. Oxygen
concentrations below 6 percent will cause
death to occur in 6 to 8 minutes.

A signiﬁcant fact related to oxygen defi—
cient atmospheres is that before the oxygen
content has become so low as to be irrespir-
able, it may have taken up other toxic
gases which would cause injury even in the
presence of an adequate oxygen supply and
be more harmful than oxygen deﬁciency
alone.

During the exertion of ﬁre ﬁghting,
unconsciousness from oxygen lack may be
instantaneous. A concentration of 4.2 per-
cent oxygen results in a loss of coordina-
tion in 2 minutes but consciousness lasts
for 7 minutes or more. Recovery is prompt
if the victim is removed to fresh air and
caused to breathe air containing at least 14
percent oxygen, but it must be remembered
that exposure to heat increases the oxygen
requirement in the same way that fever
does.

Much of our knowledge of respiratory
oxygen exchange in ﬁres has been obtained
from experimental work, especially on
goats. This animal is suitable because the
afﬁnity of its hemoglobin for carbon mon-
oxide is almost the same as that of man.
When animals breathe 100 percent nitro-
gen, the oxygen saturation of arterial blood
falls in 1 minute to 10 percent; regular
respiration ceases in 11/2 minutes and
death occurs in 4 minutes.

A high body temperature of 108-111°F
(42.5°-43.5°C) increases susceptibility to
high carbon monoxi‘dedow oxygen atmos-
pheres. The oxygen depletion of the blood
in fatal cases may be due to continued use
of oxygen by the tissues after breathing
ceases.

body temperature. It has been shown that
exposures as brief as 75 seconds to a gaso—
line ﬁre were able to cause immediate
death solely by overheating the skin and
thereby elevating the body temperature.

The time required to produce second
degree burns of equal intensity can be seen
from the following table:

, Inhalation of air at the above tempera~
tures produces burns of the respiratory

tract with slightly longer exposure.

Tolerance of Living Tissues for Heat

Exposure of living animals to an air
temperature of 752°F (400°C) for 1 min-
ute is fatal, independent of asphyxial in-
ﬂuences or thermal injury of the respira—
tory tract, either of which may lower the
tolerance. Anesthetized animals are slight—
ly less susceptible to heat since their body
temperature is lower than that of conscious
animals and more heat is needed to bring
the internal body temperature to injurious
levels.

To produce cutaneous burning, it is nec—
essary to bring the temperature of the
deeper layers of the epidermis to at least
117°F (47°C). The higher the body tem-
perature, the lower need be the skin tem-
perature of the superﬁcial dermis to cause
cellular death. Exposure to an ambient air
temperature of about 752°F (400°C) for
90 seconds leads to a fatal hyperthermia in
pigs, although 15 minutes’ exposure is re-
quired at 212°F (100°C). Man requires
almost twice the exposure of pigs to cause
fatal hyperthermia and the sequence of
eventsleading to death includes inhibition
of respiratorycenters and of the conduct-
ing mechanism of the heart, peripheral

287

vascular collapse, with possibly an increase
in plasma potassium and concurrent injury
to the nervous system.

The Effect of lnhaling Heated Air

When hot air is passed into the trachea,
the temperature (in the trachea) rises dur-
ing inspiration and falls during exhalation.
If the air is hot and dry, the temperature
reaches a sharp peak and declines rapidly.
If the air is moist, it reaches a peak tem—
perature more slowly and drops much
more slowly than with dry air, that is,
there is a plateau effect.

There is a sharp drop in temperature be-
tween the source and the trachea, however
short the distance. Moritz found that moist
air at 662°F (350°C) at its source dropped
to 520°_360°F (159°-182°C) inside the
larynx. There was a drop from 932°F
(500°C) at the source to 122°F (50°C)
within the trachea under the inﬂuence of
active and deep breathing.

If the air is hot enough to damage the
lower air passages, it is likely to cause
death by producing obstructive edema of
the larynx before enough time elapses to
cause marked changes deep in the respira-
tory tract. Thus, the lotwer the temperature
of the air entering the respiratory tract
(within certain limits) the deeper will be
the site of injury. Other pathological ﬁnd-
ings seen in the respiratory tract after ex-
posure to smoke and ﬂame, include a de—
position of carbon, reddening of the
tracheal mucous membrane, and a slight
accumulation of frothy edema ﬂuid in the
lungs. Hyperemia is prominent in the in-
teralveolar septal capillaries with conges-
tion of the smaller vessels. The local vas-
cular damage with edema may contribute
to the development of shock.

Respiratory failure occurs before the
heart fails and although it may be an im-

 




Causes of Deaths in Fires

Damage to the brain is probably signif-
icant in causing sudden death in ﬁres. Pa-
tients who seem to be recovering from
toxemia and with liver damage subsiding
often die suddenly of respiratory failure
without structural changes in the lungs.
This sequence is comparable in many re-
spects to death seen after brain injury.

Deaths occurring in persons not exposed
to excess heat is probably due to oxygen
deﬁciency and high concentration of car-
bon monoxide. Irritants cause great dis—

tress and pain but are secondary in causing
sudden death.

In delayed deaths, that is, in individuals
surviving more than 3 hours, there is a
probability of sepsis, bronchopneumonia,
and /or formation of pulmonary scar tissue
with loss of vital function and secondary
shock as a cause of death.

If the subject is severely burned, death
may be due to (1) central circulatory fail-
ure (dilation by heat, capillary damage and
plasma loss) because of excessive destruc—
tion of blood in superﬁcial peripheral ves—
sels, (2) from release of potassium from
circulating cells, or (3) from loss of

plasma through damaged capillaries until .

blood volume is greatly reduced. If the
subject is not severely burned, death may
be due to systemic hyperthermia leading to
heart stoppage even though the tempera-
ture is not high enough to cause burning.
Death (in man) from hyperthermia occurs
when the body temperature reaches 108°F.

Animals exposed to ﬂame in a series of
experiments with adequate ventilation
showed acute respiratory depression but
blood carboxyhemoglobin of O to 21 per-
cent. Five of seven animals died in 45 min-

utes of some form of shock, possibly due
only to hyperthermia but with evidence of
attendant increase in capillary permeability.
Goats exposed to ﬂame for 8 to 20 seconds
usually died in 1 hour. None had sufﬁcient
carboxyhemoglobin in the blood to kill.
The arterial oxygen saturation was low,
although all breathed outdoor air. All ani—
mals were severely burned and each had a
high serum potassium level. The blood
showed hemoconcentration. In three ani-
mals, the potassium concentration was
raised above lethal levels and one showed
evidence of ventricular ﬁbrillation. They
stopped breathing before the heart symp—
toms ceased. There was no pulmonary
edema; lung hemorrhages were scarce and
focal. Pulmonary hyperemia was present
in some animals.

Death from heat is due more particular-
ly to the effect on the skin rather than from
a general increase in body temperature.
This includes ( 1) liberation of potassium
into the blood stream so that fatal levels
are reached, (2) local damage to blood
vessels with edema which probably con-
tributes to the development of shock, (3)
massive stimulation of the sensory nerve
endings, and (4) loss of protection nor-
mally afforded by the skin against water
loss.

In practical situations, anoxia may
hasten the development of ventricular
ﬁbrillation. Anoxia alone might cause it
although the mechanism is uncertain.
Gases and vapors may cause slowing of the
heart accompanied by a fall in diastolic
and systolic blood pressures. Adrenalin
administered at this point might result in
disordered rhythms and ﬁbrillation.

 




290

During ventricular ﬁbrillation, the ven—
tricles of the heart beat very rapidly and
out of rhythm with the auricles. The con-
dition is rapidly fatal and may be caused by
exposure to hydrocarbons and the simulta-
neous hypersecretion of adrenalin from
fear or fright. When intense emotion is
experienced, adrenalin is secreted by the
adrenal glands and poured into the blood
stream. In the presence of gasoline vapors,
the effect of adrenalin is said to be syner—
gistic, that is, the effect of the two sub—
stances is greater than the sum of the effect
of the two separately.

Moritz has listed the principal causes of
ﬁre deaths as follows (but not necessarily
in their order of frequency for more than
one cause may operate in a single case) :

. 1. Carbon monoxide.
2. Insufﬁcient oxygen (anoxemia).

3. Carbon dioxide and combined effect of
carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide causing
prolonged hyperphea.

4. Effect of heat alone.
5. Surgical shock.

6. Bronchial and pulmonary edema with
hyperemia (related to irritants, such as acid
anhydridcs, aldehydes and acids).

7. Other toxic gases as hydrocyanic acid,
nitrogen oxides, ﬂuorides and chlorides.

8. Ventricular ﬁbrillation produced by in-
haling vapors of hydrocarbons.

Moritz believes that heat dilates the
blood vessels causing capillary damage and
loss of plasma into tissue spaces, resulting
in local edema. In second degree burns,
there is a loss of tissue ﬂuid which is sec-
ondary to a loss of plasma (especially a
loss of plasma proteins which are needed
to maintain osmotic relationships). Con-
centration of the blood results and red
blood cells plug the small vessels. Potas—
sium is liberated from the cells and exerts
a toxic effect on muscle ﬁbres of the heart.
This toxic effect is relative, for when red

NFPA QUARTERLY ———- jANUARY 1952

blood cells are destroyed intracellular
potassium is liberated and the ionic bal-
ance of the blood favors the accumulation
of potassium over the normal level of ex-
tracellular sodium. This is associated with
a decrease in blood volume, a fall in blood
pressure and shock which, in turn, leads to
destruction or inhibition of the cardio-
regulatory centers in the medulla, loss of
vagus control of the heart and even to ven-
tricular ﬁbrillation, resulting in rapid, ir-
regular and incoordinated contraction of
the heart muscle. The coronary circulation
may then fail. Ventricular ﬁbrillation is
essentially a disorder of excitation and con-
duction of the cardiac impulse. After ex-
posure to heat during ﬁres, ventricular
ﬁbrillation may be due to anoxemia or
emotional stress as well as inhalation of
hydrocarbon combustion products.

In a number of unburned experimental
animals dying of strangulation, the blood
potassium did not exceed 12 milliequiv-
alents per liter. A blood temperature of
127.4°F (53°C) in capillary blood is nec-
essary to produce toxic effects in pigs and
it must be maintained for 15-20 minutes
(or a skin temperature of 131°F (55°C)
for 15-20 minutes). Two—thirds of the
body surface must be exposed. Therefore,
potassium is probably not responsible
where the body is unburned as reported by
Rubinstein and Persky.

In the tragic Cocoanut Grove disaster in
1942, where almost 500 lives were lost, it
was apparent from the condition of the
bodies that they had been exposed to
ﬂames of great intensity from burning ma-
terial for a short time and for a much
longer period to toxic combustion products
and poisonous vapors. The exact nature of
the gases and vapors was not established
beyond some doubt, but it is deﬁnitely
known that carbon monoxide and certain

without occluding the air passages. If oc—
clusion occurs, it may be due to partial
plugging with cellular debris, mucus,
ﬁbrin and leucocytes from higher levels in
the respiratory tree. The swelling may oc—
clude the air passages mechanically or
there may be a reﬂex closing of the glottis
which prevents inhalation of oxygen unless
the condition is relieved by surgical means.
A secondary infection may occur later,
either in the form of a chemically induced
bronchitis or pneumonia which is usually
refractory to treatment.

The essential procedure in the treatment
of edema of the respiratory organs is to
supply oxygen by inserting a tube in the
occluded air passages. Rest is vitally im-
portant to enable the body to conserve
oxygen and escape suffocation. When
edema is present, it is important to guard
against the development of secondary lung
infection by antibiotics and supportive
treatment.

NFPA QUARTERLY —— jANUARY 1952

The respiratory injuries seen in victims
of the Cocoanut Grove disaster varied
from obstructive edema of the upper air
passages, in persons with severe skin
burns, to delayed broncho-pulmonary dam-
age in persons showing little or no burning
of the body surface. In others, pulmonary
edema was caused by the inhalation of irri-
tants. Mallory and Brickley stated that
”anoxemia plus an irritant vapor may
synergistically act to produce pulmonary
edema in a very short time.”

Acrolein and other irritants (eg, from
burning paint and oil) may cause exten-
sive alveolar edema deep in the lungs. In
the absence of irritants, edema can be
caused by high carbon dioxide, high car-
bon monoxide and low oxygen concentra-
tions plus an unknown factor. High car-
bon dioxide concentrations can cause rapid
and deep respiratory damage due to stimu-
lation of the respiratory center in which
there is an effort to compensate for low
oxygen concentrations.

Carbon Monoxide and Carbon Dioxide

As pointed out above, the principal
cause of sudden death in fires may be a
high concentration of carbon monoxide
and a low oxygen concentration in the in-
spired air. Equilibrium between blood and
air with respect to these gases is never
reached in fatal cases or in short exposures,
but it is probably reached in prolonged ex-
posure to low carbon monoxide tensions.
The lethality of oxygen—carbon monoxide
mixtures depends on the ultimate equili—
brium in the blood between hemoglobin
and carboxyhemoglobin, z'.e., 5%

cated deaths from carbon monoxide may
occur in an atmosphere containing a high
concentration of carbon dioxide. This does
not happen when irritating combustion
products are also present (such as alde—
hydes and acids), for persons are driven
from the area by the irritant gases. How-
ever, in the vicinity of a slow burning coke
ﬁre, with inadequate ventilation, large vol-
umes of carbon monoxide are produced
and the death of an exposed person may
be almost instantaneous.

The amount of carbon monoxide needed
to produce death depends on the rate at
which the gas is inhaled and the physical
exertion at the time of exposure. General-

nitrogen oxides were present. Burning
about the head indicated that ﬂames were
concentrated above four feet; this ﬁnding
makes it understandable that ﬂame inhala—
tion was frequent. The depth to which
ﬂame penetrated into the respiratory
organs was difﬁcult to determine, but char-
acteristic tissue destruction was seen in the
nostrils, larynx and trachea. Pulmonary
edema in the Cocoanut Grove cases devel-
oped in a very short time. The very deep
parts of the lungs were affected. Even ex—
tremely poisonous and irritant war gases
do not cause pulmonary edema until some
time has elapsed after exposure. A deﬁ—
ciency of oxygen in the blood (anoxemia)
may cause pulmonary edema and when
oxygen deﬁciency and irritant or toxic
vapors are working together the time re-
quired may be shortened.

In only a few of the fatal Cocoanut
Grove cases which came to autopsy was
surface burning sufficiently extensive to
cause death. In cases which were ”dead on
arrival” at various hospitals, the appear-
ance of the body organs indicated inhala—
tion of irritants and survival long enough
to develop a serous but not a leucocytic
type of reaction.

The principal cause of death was ad—
judged to be anoxemia, due to carbon
monoxide and other gases.

Pathological Findings in the Respiratory
Tract After Heat Exposure

One of the commonest forms of injury
seen in ﬁre victims is the accumulation of
ﬂuid in one or more parts of the respira—
tory tract, so-called edema. It is called
bronchial, laryngeal, or pulmonary edema
according to the location. Edema is not
exclusively due to inhalation of ﬂame,
superheated air, irritant smoke or noxious
gases. It has been observed in experimental

291

animals exposed to ﬂame and heat who
had been breathing pure air through a res—
pirator. In subjects dying immediately
after exposure in a ﬁre, edema is seldom
seen and suggests that some time must
elapse before the pathological process can
organize. Apparently, pulmonary edema
can be caused by hyperthermia alone and
is also seen after exposure to carbon mon—
oxide alone, although the latter gas is not
considered to be an irritant. There is no
correlation between the severity and extent
of pulmonary or bronchial edema and the
percent of carboxyhemoglobin in the

blood.

The association of edema and expo-
sure to excessive heat has been noted by
several investigators. It may or may not
terminate in death but when it does, it is
due to closure of the air passages by the
accumulated ﬂuid which prevents air from
reaching the lungs, actually a form of ob—
structive asphyxia. It may also be triggered
by shock (accompanied by increased capil-
lary permeability, not necessarily conﬁned
to the site of trauma). Psychic factors are
probably of minor importance for the con-
dition can be produced by exposing anes—
thetized animals to high temperatures.
Pulmonary edema reduces the vital capa—
city of the lungs and is not dissimilar to
pneumonia in this respect. In sudden
death, pulmonary hemorrhage is a promi-
nent ﬁnding at autopsy. The hemorrhage
may occur very rapidly and has been seen
in animals dying 11/2 to 31/2 minutes after
exposure to heat, even those protected by
respirators so that the normal carbon di-
oxide-oxygen relationships of the blood
are maintained.

Pulmonary edema may develop rapidly
following exposure to irritant gases. It
may kill in a short time or the outcome
may be delayed. Edema may occur with or

MEMO TO: Hobart Lewis
FROM: Paul Kearney

SUBJECT: Documentation and sundry data on vivisection piece.

Replying to your marginal queries on the original Mss., in their
consecutive order:

PAGE ONE - 1: Fainer, Clement & Ivy; University of Illinois College
of Medicine. Reported September 21, 1950. Purpose: "Attempt to
evaluate resuscitation of submerged animals." The paper cites seven
previous drowning experiments on animals by other researchers, none of
which were "adequately controlled," hence this new series. A dumb
layman might wonder why the others weren't adequately controlled---and
what was gained by these when the final sentence of the report says:
"It is unknown whether these results can be applied to man since ven—
tricular fibrillation may not occur in all species drowned in fresh
water." See Exhibit A.

2: Dr. Alan R. Moritz and associates, Harvard Medical
School. At intervals since 1945.
Further similar experiments reported by the laboratories of Arthur
D. Little, Inc., Cambridge, Mass., in the January, 1952, QUARTERLY of
the National Fire Protection Association. Exhibit B.

3.' Gregerson & Root, Columbia University, Department of

Physiology. Reported in American Jnl of Physiology, January, 1947.
This case has attracted universal criticism and voluminous rebuttal.

Dr. Gessel feels that, to avoid involvment in the controversy, the

one assertion which brooks no argument is that it was inexcusable to 3
allow the tortured dogs to survive the experiment. Exhibit C, P 178.”

PAGE 1A - 1: I do not know the particulars. This was taken from
correspondence reprinted from the Lancet. Exhibit D.

2: I believe this was proposed by Dr. A. C. Ivy, University
of Illinois, who conducted the aforementioned drowning experiment,
and was reported in Time in 1950 or 1951. Mrs. Stevens thinks this
project fell through for lack of funds.

3. I do not know the details. This reference is from a
copy of some informal notes Dr. Gessel made for a talk at some,
scientific meeting. He can certainly provide the data if you want it.
I did not quote him in this connection because this material was con-
fidential. Exhibit E.

PAGE 2 - 1: They are debarked to keep them quiet and avoid annoyance
to laboratory workers and the neighborhood.
This experiment is also quoted from the Lancet — See EXhibit D.

2: McGill University. This is also from the Lancet. LIt in-
volves the infamous Noble-Collip drum devised for this type of test.

University of Illinois; Harvard Medical School; Columbia
University; University of Virginia; McGill University;
Sinﬂg Hospital, Baltimore.

Letter included in full on Page 5, Exhibit D; you can de-
cide whether or not to quote further.

Translations of the Swedish and Swiss laws were included
in supplementary material submitted with original Mss.

I doubt if quoting further from them will any anything.
Exhibit C. Sis

PAGE 8 1: This page has been rewritten to cover this query.
PAGE 9 1, 2, 3: Ditto.
PAGE 10 — Ditto.

PAGES 12-13: I am sort of on the spot on this one. The AWI has
several folders of reports on visits to various hospitals and labora-
tories in several states. These are strictly confidential, but they
let me read them on the understanding that they were not to leave the
office or be copied. I read about 25 of them, some of which would
turn your stomach, but I do not feel free to give you specific quotes.
However, if you want to send one of your research gals over there for
verification (Empire State Building, 5th floor), Miss Draper will be
glad to show her the reports on the same terms. Any permission to
quote names will have to come from Miss Draper or Mrs. Stevens; but I
doubt if they will grant it because they do not want to kill their
chances of inspecting other institutions and thus finding where there
is opportunity for educational work.

When I see you I will tell you some of the details I jotted down,
but I promised not to put anything in writing.

In the revised text I have added specific references to institutions
in Chicago, Boston and New York, without naming them. Is this OK?

PAGE 13: Inasmuch as these three are no better than they should be,
I am including mention of two pharmaceutical laboratories that I have
seen personally: Lederle and Merck. I visited them, incidentally,
on another RD piece I was working on some two years ago (which was
finally turned down); but I've checked on them with AMI and they agree
that they are exemplaryr--both much better, for instance, than Parke-
Davis or Squibb. If you want models, these are far better than any
hospital.

GENERAL QUERIES: There are NO enlightened laws, local or state. The
only laws are recently adopted procurement or pound seizure acts in a
half—dozen states, patterned closely after the NSMR "model law."

These have nothing to do with the treatment of the animals in or after
experiments, and the sole supervision is by the State Department of
Health. This is akin to seledting l2 pickpockets as jurors in a
pickpocket trial.

The only state showing any signs of progress is California, but this
has not yet become startling.

The AV's have never proposed any regulatory laws: they are unalter-

 




5.

ably opposed to vivisection of any kind, period. Indeed, the only
point on which the AV's and the NSMR are in complete agreement is this
aversion to control.

There has never been any attempt to introduce the English system
here. The AWI is the first middle-of-the—road group to appear on the
scene with such a suggestion.

With regardcto the relative merits of the Louisville and the Van-
couver programs: Mrs. Stevens and Miss Draper are both of the opinion
that the British Columbia one is the more significant because it is a
formal working agreement between the local SPCA and the medical men,
whereas Miss Verhoef's arrangement is more personal and depends largely
upon her influence. Therefore, I wouldn't advise playing down the
BC program.

PS: Further details on the English system are given in the AWI Infor—
mation Report No. 4 - Exhibit H. I hardly know how much of this you
want to include.

Regarding quotations from the Lancet: if you need specific names

and dates on these, your London office can get them from Major C. W.
Hume, Universities Federation for Animal Welfare, 284 Regent's Park

Road, Finchley, London, N.3.

In regard to the revision on Page 8, referring to the NY ASPCA:
there is ample proof of this. My own wife and her sister both had
their renewal checks returned to them because they had written letters
to the organization expressing disapproval of the organization's stand.
The legality of such a procedure is now being tried in court, but this
has no bearing on the article.

established eorally well b? the use of a few. Within this lﬁane of regulatiaus ans
customs it is possible to limit pa‘nFul experiments to a verv small proportion of experi-
Ments as a whole, an4 to ensure that the sufferin“ experienced is not severe or prolonged.
”In other western Phrcpean countries, snﬂ ﬁn America, thoueh most scientists

Chrrles "arwin hols toot to inflict any pain which is not absolutely necessary deserves

inﬁement. They knew that to a ply the criterion of oecessjtv calls for unremittinc care

l'T-V our correspondents (of ihe dors Who were heaten to seeth) and others the essential

in one scientific investigation, seven docs which had been surgically ”debarked,”

were kept in a chronic state of fear for E22 Eonghs by means of electric shocks trans-
rntted throc‘h their metal cages (six e-r hovr for each 12-hour day, plus "intermittent
stimulatﬁens" at nicht) to determﬁne the effect of chronic fear on the eastric secretion.
In still another study, groups of conscious laboratory rats, paws bound toeether, were

dropped for varyin: distances in a specially-devised drum to times per minute until dead.
One group Wes subjected to 700 falls in 17 minutes; the other to 800 falls in 20 minutes.

All died in less than an hour.

frivolous, needless experiments, pointing out that in sheer self-defense of their essential
studies the scientists would do well to police themselves beyond reproach. He offered
scientists the cooperation of his 8.P.C.A., as a sympatheticslly infer-ed but inpurtinl
body. The result has been a formal agreement under which the principles and spirit

of the English law are voluntarily accepted.

Tb most intelligent observers, the humanitarians seem to be on the right track -
moving along a middle road between the antiavivisectionists, who want no animal
experimentation, and the extremists among the scientists, who want no interference
or supervision. Major Charles d. Hume, director of the Universities Federation far

Animal welfare, London, has summed up the position of those who find themselves

between the two extremes. In his valuable treatise, "How to Befriend Laboratory Lninnla,‘

Major Hume writes: "Sentient creatures are something more than more experimental
material, like test tubes. They deserve all the techniques of anesthesia and authaDAIia;
operative skill and post—operative care." In the United States Major Hume's attitude
is echoed by Dr. Dwight J. Ingle, of the Upjohn Company, Kalamazoo, Mich., which does
an enormous amount of experimental work: "I an in sympathy with any'organisntion,'
writes Dr. Ingle, Iwhich seeks to promote the humane tr>atment of animals while ut the
same time recognizing the essentials of animal experimentation in biology and Indicinn.
"I believe that laboratories engaged in animal experimentation should b0 required
by law to meet intelligent requirements of’humano care.”
The time is long past due for.American scientists to follow the lead out by
their illustrious predecessors in Britain. The exercised consciences of Charles Births
and Julian Huxlnu'blaned.the trail to an enlightened combination of hulanity and acianco.

For 90 years this course has been clearly rapped. All we need to do is roll-I’it.

Dear Christine:

After much thought, I have written the attached
memo to Ken Payne, sending copies to Dashiell and
Wallace. What bothers me most is the danger of
offending Payne by going over his head and thus
jeopradizing his good will, which is virtually my
livelihood right now. However, they have me
strictly on the hook unless I can get to Wallace
-—-and I'm hoping that sending the memo to all
three, while addressing it to Ken, will take the
curse off it. I know you will squirm at my use
of the comments from your confidential reports, but
this is not for publication and can do no harm.

Will you please return the memo after you've
read it?

Enclosed is a copy of an English publication
which Hobart Lewis gave me at RE recently, somewhat
in the nature of the final knock out blow to our
article. I called his attention to the fact that
(thanks to you!) the only criticism of that experi-
ment we made was that they allowed the dogs to live
over night. Please send this back, too. I trust
they have returned your material to you, which Lewis
promised to do last week.

They had to postpone my operation a week because
of a sinus flare—up, which is why I'm still in there
swinging.

Dear Chris:

We might as well drop the Mister and iqissus stuff, because
this Digest project is obviously going to be a life work!

All the weasels down there have lost their nerve and won't
make a decision, one way or the other: they flatly pass the
buck to Wallace This is OK by me, except for the fact that
Wa.llace is in Colorado at the mmment - what's more, he won‘t
be back before I leave (Oct 15) on a six week's trip to the
west coast on some other Digest stuff.

Their final suggestion is that you and Wallace and I get
together and thrash it out. And while I don't anticipate
any trouble on this score at all, it irks me no end to have
it drag on into December. Hence this suggestion:

Attached is a copy of the "cut" of my Mss., which was sub-
mitted to the AMA. (I think they've done a pretty good job,
but it's a mistake to leave out the stuff about the way the
animals are housed in many institutions.) They said last
week that they would maid me a copy of the AMA letter, but
it hasn't shown up yet: I'll foward it if it ever does.

NOW, what would you think of calling Hobart Lewis, at RD,
around the middle of October with the idea of fixing up a
date for you and Jack to see Wally? I'd love to be in on
it, but it's a pity to waste a whole month just for thatT—-
and I would tell Lewis that when you talk to him. The whole
point is that they are all scared to take the responsibility
for putting RD out on a limb in this controversy. Yet this
article is precisely what Wallace hoped for when we first
discussed it ten months ago_——only more so. And this is
why the others are afraid to reject it, even though they
haven't the nerve to accept it.

This is the goddamndest thing/I hver got mixed up in,
but I'm not going to stop swinging until the end of the 9th!

to shatter the boredom of my hospital cell with
your glowing presence, the more convinced of
this I become.

But at the same time I also realize what a louse's
louse I am for not having sent you even a thank
you note for your kindness. In my own defense I
will say that I had a lovely Valentine picked out
for you, but I don't know what happened to it.
Probably my wife hid it. Despite which I want you
to know that your visit was the nicest thing that
has happened to me in a long time.

At this writing I am the Bklyn Eye & Bar's No. 1
Problem Child. Not only did I have to go back
there for three days to have the sutures removed
———but the doctor still can't find a lens in his
whole arsenal which enables me to see a goddamned
thing out of that eye. He's puzzled and disgust-
ed. I ditto.

Because of this, I cannot accompany you on your
forthcoming jaunt to Europe. But I can--—and
do~-—wish you

Dear Christine:
I'm very depressed to hear that we won't

have a Visit from you this summer, and I
shall go back into the hills and sulk.

By all means write RD for the material

        
       
       
     
   
   

they still have: Hobart Lewis is the guilty

 

one. Incidentally, the carbon copy you sent
me is their "out" of the original, not my

Mss., which contained considerably more stuff.
Perhaps you know that — but I thought I should

mention it anyhow.

Dear Christine:

I guess the jig is up. I finally trapped
the elusive Mr. Wallace in his lair, on the
pretext of discussing another article; but
when I finally got around to pinning him down
on a luncheon date, he just threw in the towel.

It was all very puzzling, for he gave every
evidence of being reluctant to do it; in fact,
he seemed disgusted with the fact that he felt
he should pass up the subject. Normally, he
is the most mild mannered man I know---but he
slammed his desk and threw papers around and
was so vehement that it was a bit startling.

I can act that way over a misplaced fountain
pen, but not Wallace!

However, whether he regrets it or not, the
matter is closed. It's a Goddamned shame that
the breaks went against us the way they did——-
but that's one of the joys of this free lance
business. I’m moving up to the country on
Tuesday for the rest of the summer, and when we
get settled, I'll put on my cogitating uniform

“and see what else might be done with whom. I
wish youﬁcould spend a wee nd with us and
help me think!

“A visit to any such laoorr cry -~- ani, contrarv to
the declarations of the ant1V1VIsect1on1sto, all of
them are ooen to visitors —-- will : ve co 1vinoing
proof that these animals are be t .er fed, better cared-
for and more alloc+1onatoly tieated than are many
pets in private homes.”

 

The parenthetical phra ass is pu re eye w sh, but nn1m~or‘ int. What is
important was touched on ori eily in my Orlwlﬂal Lss., (bet deleted
from the out, I think): i.e., the low grade of ca e accorded laboratory
animals in many of our leading institutions.

I read 22, out or about 50, detailed reports or A 'Jl IOTkEFS who
visited leading hospitals and medical schools in four states, checkine
on one thing only: the housing and care of laboratory animals, What
they found is indicated by a few of the pencil notes I made from
those reports:

NORTH IAST'MIWI AL CENTER, voston (Pra tt Diaenostic Lab):
Stench overaowertnu, sick and well dogs togethe r5 mange
and distemper evident; dogs too sick to move lying on wet
concrete floors.

LBJ YOlKIIMQIIAL LOLTIGr Elower & fifth Avenue Hospitals:

ating rdom.dar1c,_smelly and primitive. Condition of many
'animals deplorable.~

   

UNIVIRSITI OF ILLINOIS Medical School: Over 100 dogs jammed
in one small room. .All seem.sick and dejected; some ex~
tremely emaciated.

  
   
        

HAJ‘ VARI MEDICAL SCHOOL; No exercise although outdoor run~
ways are available. Distemper a serious problem. Bad
odor; quarters not good. .As man? as 9 operations per dog.

1 wish you and Fritz and daily would ponder that situation well.’
What it boils down to is this: ,

l. Pecp1e are scared to turn over their "nznrl to the
ASPCA because they knOW'that laboratories can requisition
then under the new law. ‘

2. lheyc are scared of this because the medical profes sion
answers the rantings of the AV's with nothine more than rantlncc
of their own. Consequently, the puzzled pub1ic feels that
where there’s so muchs smoke, there must he some fire.

3. There IS some iire because we cootiwwe to have unre-
stricted and uncontrolled animal engeriments such as the
ones Cited in my article which purported to prove that

one bra nd of cigarette is less harmful than another —-« and
even failed in that.

h. 'Until we arrive at some qualified supervision of animal
experimentation -~- perhaps such as they have in Vancouver —--
the public will continue to be afraid, and the scarcity of
laboratory animals will become more acute as the need in-
creases. (I say Vancouver rather than England because 1

don‘t think the English system.would be workable here.) —
altho its goal is ideal.

On the wa3 home from mV recent trip, I went out of my way to 2>to through
Louisville so 1 coulri. talk to both 1i: s Verioeii (rentrozod in my articles)
and to Dr. Lawson, dean of the medical school there. 1he whole tenor of
Dr. Lawson's comments was: this arrangement worKS'out very successfull 3 we
are ”led to havel iss V’erhoei f‘ around beca*se she is a stabiliz 1; influelices
but the whole thing is quite unnecessary b cause doctors are just as humane and
considerate as anybody else.

This is doubtless true as reparos Dr. LaVJson and his colzcaeues NOW
But it Ma 8 far from.the cas se'when hiss Verhoeff began he work under his predecessor.
3 And from two recent and rather revolting cases which she told me -—~ both ‘
involving visiting doctors from. other cities who came there to work -—-
the current Louisville standars are not universal.~ '

As hr. Lawson talked ~-— he is an extremely'fine man --- he finally
got around to the uSual spiel about the ethics of his profession and the?
exceptional quality oi his students. I couldn’t help but wonder if he had
ever tried to get on the BLT subwa3 at 23rd Street with a mob of medical
students from NYU-Bellevue, or the dental students from.CCNY. I wondered if
he’d ever seen the pictures the Dad ly'heVV V‘s used to run, showing 0 to 10 cars
parked in the no iarkino zones outside the Stork or 21 Clubs, immunise d from .
tickets by their MD plates. I wondered if he had ever talked at length with any of the
Internal Revenue field agents who so often rent an apartment across the street from
some highly respected.physician's office and, from.the count during office hours,
calculate that he‘s paying about one-tenth of his normal income tail”

Don't misunderstand.me. l'mvnot gunnlnr for the Inedical men. And
I am not an anti~viviseCtionist. 1 am simply a realist who feels that when

Readers Digest suffers in silence this Coronet trash from the National Society

SUBJECT: Documentation and andry data on vivisection piece.

Replying to your marginal queries on the original Mss., in their
consecutive order:

PAGE ONE ~ 1: Fainer, Clement &.Ivy; University of Illinois College
of Medicine. Reported September 21, 1950. Purpose: "Attempt to
evaluate resuscitatiOn of Submerged animals."' The paper cites seven
previous drowning experiments on animals by other researchers, none of
which.were ”adequately controlled," hence this new series. A dumb
laymen might wonder Why the others weren't adequately controlledm-and
whet was gained by these when the final sentence of the report says:
”It is unknown whether these results can be applied to men since ven~
tricular fibrillation may not occur in all Species drowned in fresh
water." See Exhibit A. v -

2: Dr. Alan R. Morita and associates, Harvard Medical
School. At intervals since l9h5.
Further similar experiments reported by tho laboretor1es of Arthur_
D. Little, lnc., Cameridg;:e, Mass., in the January, 1952, utnilhﬂl of
the National tire Protection :suocistaon. ' Ixhibit B.

3. Gregerson e Root, Columbia University, Department of‘
Physiology. Reyorted in American Jnl of Physiology, January, 19h7.
This case has attracted universal criticism and voluminous rebuttal.
Dr. Gessel feels that, to avoid involvment in the controversy, the
one assertion which brooks no argument is that it was inexcusable to
allow the tortured dogs to survive the experiment. Exhibit C, P 178.

PAGE 1A.~ l: I do not know the particulars. This was taken from
correspondence reprinted from the Lancet. .Exhibit D.

2: I believe this was proposed by Dr. A.. G. Ivy, University
of Illinois, who conducted the aforementioned drowning experiment,
and was reported in Time in 1950 or 1951. Mrs. Stevens thinks this
project fell through for lack of funds.

3: I do not know the details. This reference is from a
copy of some informal notes Dr. Gessel made for a talk at some
scientific meeting. He can certainly provide the data if you want it.
I did not quote him in this connection because this material'was con»

doubt if they will grant it because they do not 11ant to kil 1 their ‘ ‘

In the revised text I 2'1ave added specific reforences to institutions

in Chicago3 Boston and New York, without naming them. Is this OK?

with regard to the relative merits of the Lauisville and the Van~

that the British Columbia one is the more significant because it is a

upon her influance. Therefore, I wouldn’t advise playing down the
