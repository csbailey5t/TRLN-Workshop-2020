Fireman L. Campbell, N.F.S.
101, Clifton Road, Prestwich, Manchester.
Certificate of Merit.

These awards were for the rescue of a drowning horse from a
pond on the Manchester Corporation Electricity Department
Tip at Cheetham. Company Officer Bethel swam to the horse’s
rescue and was joined in the water by Mr. Blomeley. Mr. Casson
and Fireman Campbell rendered great assistance and the horse ,
was eventually brought safely out of the water. We congratulate
each one of them upon his humane act.

FINANCE.

The Committee desires to express appreciation of the work
of the Collectors and Box Holders during the past year. Further
Collectors are needed and offers of assistance will be welcomed,
particularly in Cadishead, Davyhulme, Eccles, Irlam, Prestwich,
Urmston, VValkden and VVorsley.

A Flag Day, organized by Mrs. E. L. Gillett, Hon. Secretary
of the Stretford Auxiliary, was held in Stretford on the 9th June,
1945. We regret to say that despite many promises of assistance
the number of Flag Sellers who actually attended was very
disappointing. The fact that, with only a few Sellers, £22 95. 11d.
was collected, proves that a far more satisfactory result could
have been achieved with greater assistance. To those who did
assist as Sellers the Committee has to express its grateful thanks.

In December a Sale—principally of Toys—was held at the
Branch Office. The Sale was organized by the Ladies of the Cats’
Shelters Sub-Committee and realized the very satisfactory amount
of £92 25. 6d. '

THE COMMITTEE.

It is with the deepest regret that we have to record the death
of Mrs. Roberts which took place shortly after the end of the
year under review. Mrs. Roberts had been a valuable member
of the Committee since 1915 and was seldom absent from




5

Committee Meetings until her removal to Silverdale a few years
ago. She was a most generous supporter of the Society and her
loss will be‘keenly felt.

Mr. Joseph Turner 'who had been Honorary Treasurer of
the Branch for many years relinquished the position during the
year upon his leaving Manchester. We are pleased to say that
he still remains a member of the Committee and that the benefit
of his wise counsel and experience is therefOre not entirely lost.
In Mr. Turner’s place the Committee welcomes his partner, Mr.
Harold Bowers, as Honorary Treasurer. Mr. S. Bowkett also
joined the Committee during the year and to him also the Com—
mittee extends a welcome.

BEYOND THE BRANCH AREA.

Whilst this Report is concerned primarily with the affairs
of the Branch it is, perhaps, not out of place to refer briefly to
the work of the Society outside the boundaries of our Branch.
The records of the Inspectors’ work'ifor 1945 were as follows :—
Complaints, 17,201 ; Convictions, 638; Cautions, 10,552. In
considering these figures it should be borne in mind that,
notwithstanding the termination of hostilities, the number of
Inspectors was still considerably below the pre—war number.
As a result of this it is unfortunately necessary for many Inspectors
to have to cover the area of two Branches. The Society’s activities
are many-sided and in none is progress more desirable than in
its parliamentary work. Many reforms which were part of its
1939 programme are held in abeyance. Amongst them is the
question of rabbit-trapping. The Society is striving for the
abolition of that instrument of torture the steel—toothed trap.
Other reforms which the Society seeks to bring about include the
prohibition of docking of horses’ tails and the amendment of
the existing and quite inadequate law with regard to performing
animals.

INSPECTOR’S ANNUAL REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1945.
T 0 the Secretary and M embers of the Committee.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

I beg to report that during the year ending 3lst December,
1945, 9 cases of cruelty were reported to Headquarters, with
the result that 5 convictions were obtained and 9 Monitions were
sent from Headquarters, and 2 cases were dismissed. 188 com—
plaints were received and investigated, resulting in 88 verbal
cautions being given, also advice as to the better treatment of
the animals concerned.

86 animals were destroyed to prevent them suffering. The
majority of these were destroyed at the owner’s request, all of
them being ill, old, or in a suffering state, having been injured
on the roads.

I have patrolled the roads in my district regularly, and
loading ways at City warehouses and departmental stores have
been visited during the loading and unloading of horse drawn
vehicles. I have visited railway sidings and goods depots in my
area, and have inspected horses carting from these places,
observation having been kept for any cases of overloading.

Frequent visits have been paid to the canal towing paths,
and the horses have been inspected. Smithfield Market and
Shudehill Market have been regularly visited and observation
kept at the latter for any offences under the Conveyance of Live
Poultry Order..

The Abattoirs have been visited on several occasions during
the slaughter of animals, and observations kept during droving,
and conveyance of stock to the place. I have visited Pet shops
and Bird shops regularly and have inspected stock being offered
for sale, also their living accommodation.

I have attended Circuses, Menageries and Theatres where
performing animals have been employed, and I have inspected
the animals, also their accommodation.

. The outlying parts of my district were visited during the
. w1nter months and animals turned out to grass were inspected.

In conclusion, my thanks are due to the Police and the Press,
also those members of the public who have rendered assistance
to me in the performance of my duties.

I am, Ladies and Gentlemen,

Your obedient servant,
LAWRENCE HILLYER.

were performing animals were also visited. N o serious complaints
were found. My area of the Branch District has been patrolled
and careful watch has been kept on horse drawn traffic on the
canals whenever possible.

On 5th November I received instructions from Headquarters
to hand over the Stockport Branch District to Inspector Merchant
upon his return to duty from the Army, which I did. Up to that
date, in the Stockport Branch, 2 cases were reported. 1 Conviction
was obtained and l Monition was sent from Headquarters.

In conclusion, my thanks are due to the Police and the many
