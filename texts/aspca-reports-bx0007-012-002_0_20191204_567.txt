HEADQUARTERS OF THE SOCIETY,-
00R. FOURTH AVENUE AND TWENTY-SECOND STREET,
' NEW YORK, February 14th, 1877.

, The Annual General Meeting of the Society was held
this day at its Headquarters; Henry Bergh, Esq., occu-
pying the chair. Having called the meeting to order,
the President remarked :

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:

Your Society is getting along in years, but I conﬁ-
dently believe that age will never be suffered to im-
pair its usefulness. The time must come, however,
when we shall be compelled to surrender this ap-
proved work into the hands of others, and I feel as
certain as it is possible to be of anything, that our suc-
cessors will not allow its utility and efﬁciency to recede

from the elevated degree to which we in our time
have raised it. Eleven years are now laid upon the
shelf of time, the record of which cannot fail to be as
acceptable to posterity as ‘0 our contemporaries.

Among the glorious achievements of our people, as
manifested by the late Centennial, not one of them, nor
all together, bore stronger testimony to the nation’s
progress in civilization, than the exhibition made by
your Society in the wonderful development of the hu-
manities of life, as applicable to that vast portion of
animated creation, which, while they can suffer and
die, cannot orally make known to us their countless
wrongs. Suspended from the rafters of the main
building, was seen an immense banner, upon which
was inscribed the names of thirty-two States of this
Union, which have done themselves the justice to adopt
the laws and policy initiated by the Parent Society of
New York, for the protection of the inferior animals.
Hundreds of thousands of people were thus brought
into personal contact with this novel humanity, and
bore away with them to their distant homes the seeds
of a more gentle and merciful human intercourse-for
it is one of the chief beauties of this work, that, while
dumb creatures are the more immediate recipients of _
its beneﬁcent operations, the moral consequences
springing from the practice of mercy to the defenceless
brute, are a more ample and diffused tenderness, and
compassion among mankind.

Twenty thousand pamphlets, placed in the hands of
visitors to the Exhibition, also—assisted in spreading
over our own country and abroad, a knowledge of the
purposes and magnitude of the labors of this Institu-

tion.

It is a reproach to the States of Florida, Mississippi,
Arkansas and Nevada, that they have failed, as yet, to
follow the example of their sister States, in the enact-
ment of similar laws for the protection of animals ; and
it is to be hoped that such legislation, so eminently
just and politic, will not be much longer delayed.

The remarkable success of this Institution may well
inspire its friends with wonder, until the means by
which it has attained to popular favor, are accurately
considered. Ignoring politics and sectarianism in
every form, and practicing equal justice, tempered
with forbearance to all alike, it challenges the admira-
tion and approval, even of those with whom it is
brought into legal opposition. It is not alone, how—
ever, to these qualities that its prosperity is indebted;
but by the favorable decisions of the higher courts,
its moral power is consolidated.

To the conduct of these cases, by our learned and
indefatigable Counsel, Mr. Gerry, is our enviable suc-
cess largely attributable.

Without intending it as a censure on the excellent
magistrates who now compose the Board of Police
Justices, I may be pardoned for expressing my regret,
that they do not share my convictions, of the propriety
of more nearly equalizing the penalties imposed for
crimes, perpetrated respectively against the lower and
superior animals. The time will yet come, however,
when the man who deliberately inﬂicts cruelty on a
defenceless dumb animal, will receive as. great a
punishment as he who steals a ham or a pair of shoes.

So continually open to the observation of the public
are, necessarily, the proceedings of this Society, that it
seems almost superﬂuous for me to do more than as—

sure its members of its ever extending Usefulness.
With each departing year, the gratifying evidence
remains, that we have pushed our way still further into
the dark wilderness of ignorance and inhumanity.

With these brief prefatory remarks, I will cursorily
allude to some of the more conspicuous incidents of
the past year. é“

The bill relating to the transportation of cattle
from a distance, which was introduced in the United
States Senate last year, and passed by that body, has
.not yet received the sanction of the lower House,
owing perhaps to the anomalous state of affairs touch-
ing the Presidential uncertainty and confusion.

The deplorable evils attending the treatment of
canal horses still exist, under, it is true, a somewhat
mitigated form, owing to our ceaseless watchfulness.
A satisfactory reform of these abominable abuses can
never be effected, until juries, before whom the miscre-
ants are‘ brought, shall realize the solemnity of an oath,
and their responsibility to law and to the require-
ments of civilization.

It is believed that “pigeon matches” are happily
falling. into desuetude.

The slaughter-houses of our city and State are far
from being satisfactorily conducted, for their proprie-
tors still continue to disregard the promptings of
humanity, in their ﬁnal treatment of the helpless
animals subjected to their despotic will. It is almost
incredible that human beings should continue insensi-
ble to the tortures of these humble creatures, and deny
them swift and merciful death, while surrendering
their lives for their masters’ proﬁt ! But so it is, and
torments, as cruel as they are unchristian-like, re-

 




 

9

morselessly characterize their transactions ! Reason-
ing animals are slaughtered in the presence of, and
close contact with one another, and otherwise handled
with far less tenderness and consideration, than bales
of senseless goods. Even the sacred name of religion
is invoked in extenuation of some of these atrocities !

Vivisection, or, mOre properly speaking, scientiﬁc
torment, has of late received a severe rebuke. The
commission appointed under the authority of the
English government, coupled with a personal desire
on the part of the Queen that this practice should be
thoroughly investigated, has made its report during
the past year, and the result is adverse to the preten—
sions of those parties, who favor the continuance of
such brutal and demoralizing tragedies. Although the
triumph of the friends of humanity to the brute, is not
as ample as could be desired, nevertheless the savage
system, which is a stain on the civilization ‘of our age,
has received a blow, which, if followed up, will doubt-
less end in its suppression. In our own land, there are
men who, possessing more brains, perhaps, than heart,
still adhere to these barbarities, though, I believe,
under modiﬁed forms, since the establishment of this
Society. ‘ ‘

The bill forbidding the salting of the streets, which
was introduced .to the Legislature last year, by Mr.
Gerry, despite the opposition which it gave rise to,
has been vigorously enforced this season, to the mani-
fest “discomfort of oﬁenders.

Veterinary surgery, as at present practiced, is pro-
liﬁc of the most diversiﬁed and cruel barbarities, which,
like those of vivisection, are performed in the name of
outraged science.

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10

Owing to the non-existence of any incorporated col-
lege, or school, authorized by the State to examine the
pretensions of practitioners, and issue diplomas or cer-
tiﬁcates as to their Qualiﬁcations, every hostler, whose
experience has never extended beyond the conﬁnes of
a stable or a blacksmith’s shop, is permitted to ma-
triculate himself, and thenceforth practice on horses
and other animals a series of the most diabolical tor-
tures. Private interest, as well as humane policy, de-
mand without delay, suitable legislation with this re-
gard.

The care and removal from the streets of vagrant
and suﬁ‘ering animals might be efﬁciently performed
by this Society, if our city authorities would appropriate
a modest sum for the carrying out of its projects in
that particular.

There but remains, ere concluding these brief remarks,
for me to ofﬁcially announce the decease of three of the
Society’s earliest friends, namely, A. T. Stewart, John
M. Bixby, and the Rev. Dr. J. O. Lord, of Buffalo.

The cordial support which the former of these gen-
tlemen extended to the cause, when it was in its in-
fancy, deserves the lasting gratitude of this Society.
I shall ever remember the ﬁrst meeting of the few gen-
tlemen, who, at my invitation, assembled at Clinton
Hall, one tempestuous winter’s night, more than eleven
years ago, to initiate this Institution, which has since
spread its blessed inﬂuence over three-quarters of this
vast country. , ﬂ

Despite the unsurpassed inclemency of the weather,
the distinguished merchant whose loss we deplore,
was present, aiding by his counsel and his wealth
the purposes of the meeting. He lived long

 




 

 

 

11

enough to behold the work, which his heart and hand
had assisted in the preparation of, prosper and become
a moral power in the land. '

To Mr. Bibe’s memory we also owe a debt of grati-
tude, for his prolonged services as a member of the
. Executive Committee of this Society, as well as for
his strongly deﬁned sympathy and practical liberality,

By the decease of the Rev. Dr. Lord, the cause we
serve has sustained another great loss. To the many
virtues which distinguished him as a clergyman, were
added a most generous, appreciative and active
participation in the defence of brute creatures from
the oppression. and cruelty of thoughtless and malicious
persons.- In every manner, whereby the tender in-
stincts of his heart, and the culture of his mind, could
promote the practice of mercy and compassion to the
humble and defenseless beings which contribute so
vastly to the proﬁt and happiness of mankind, he ren-
dered himself conspicuous. May the memory of this
good and learned man be ever held in esteem by the
friends of humanity everywhere.

I am sure you will ever hold each of these gentlemen
in grateful recollection.

The Chairman then called on the Acting Secretary
to read the reports of the Secretary, Treasurer and
Executive Committee. A

Although we look in vain throughout the whole
animal creation for a creature that can be compared
with the horse, in the beneﬁts he affords to mankind,
yet of all domestic animals he suffers most. His life
is one of incessant toil, and, in a large majority of
cases, one of continual suffering. He also, of all crea-
tures, contributes most to his owner’s vanity and pride
—as is exhibited in the use of the cruel check-rein
and the unnatural fashion of clipping off his hair as
winter approaches.

It is impossible to estimate the number of cases
which the ofﬁcers of the several branches and agents of
the Society throughout the State have attended to.
But some idea may be gained by the fact that the re-
cord of two branches alone, viz., Buffalo and Roches-
ter, show that 683 cases of cruelty of various degrees

were suppressed.

ANIMALS DESTROYED.

The agents in New York City were also required to
terminate the sufferings of 2041 animals rendered un—
ﬁt for further use by reason of disease, old age, neg-
lect and accidents, to wit:

Condemned by veterinary surgeons as past recovery ............ 207
Suffering from glanders and farcy ....................... ‘. . . . 103
Suffering from diseased feet, resulting from picking up nails, or
permanently injured by railroad tracks ............. ' ..... 160

Dogs, goats, cats, cows, sheep, and other animals ............... 1,019

 

‘Total ...................................... 2,041

The foregoing, it must be admitted, is a terrible cata-
logue of the waste of valuable animal life, against
which it is difﬁcult to predict any very material re-
forms, until, by age, increased population, and conse-
quent diminution of national resources, our people
more seriously consider than they do now, the neces-
sity of economy in other affairs of life.

AMBULANCE AND DERRICK WORK.

The ambulances of the Society were called out on
258 occasions, to remove disabled horses from the
streets, a large proportion of which were saved by the
prompt assistance thus rendered.

The Derrick, for raising animals from excavations,
etc., was also the means of saving the lives of several
valuable animals.

AUXILIARY SOCIETIES AND AGENTS.

The Society has greatly extended its operations
throughout the State of New York, by the organization
cf Branches, and the appointment of additional agents.
We have now 14 branches in active working order, and
150 agents outside New York City.

KINDRED SOCIETIES.

The Societies in the United States, Canada, and
Nova Scotia, organized on the plan of the parent so-
ciety in New York, and employing its emblem as their
ofﬁcial seal, are, as'will be seen by the following list,

The Executive Committee of the American Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, have to con-
gratulate the members, supporters, and friends of the
cause, on the steady and successful advancement
which the Society continues to make in public favor.

Inasmuch as the Reports of the Secretary and Trea-
surer give in detail the work of the Society, and its
ﬁnancial position, the Committee will conﬁne them-
selves brieﬂy to some of the most important matters
coming under their jurisdiction.

During the year the Society has lost by death seve—
ral warm and earnest friends of the cause, among
them Mr. A. T. Stewart and Mr. John M. Bixby. The
latter gentleman was a member of the Executive Com-
mittee, and took an active part in the management of
its aﬁairs.

The Committee report the resignation of Mr. Charles
B. Marshall, member of their body, and the election
of Mr. John P. Haines in his stead.

Also the election of Mr. Frederic W. Stevens as a
member of the Executive Committee, in the place of
Mr. John M. Bixby, deceased.

The thanks of the Society were voted to Mrs.

lution, which was seconded and carried unanimously :

“Resolved, That the address of the President of the
Societyy and the reports of the Secretary, Treasurer,
and Executive Committee, be and are hereby ap-
proved, and‘ that the same be adopted, printed and
circulated.”

Several members of the Society having addressed
the meeting, the proceedings terminated, and, on
motion being made, the meeting adjourned.

DRINKING HYDRANTS FOR MAN AND BEAST.

There is great need for additional hydrants in differ-
ent parts of our city. The Society has ﬁfteen already,
and continues to increase the number as often as its
funds allow. A most appropriate form of donation
could be made on the part of the friends of animals,
by the erection of fountains, under the direction of the
Society, bearing the names of the donors.

“ THE ANIMAL KINGDOM.”

This Journal, published under the auspices of the
Society, is now in the ﬁfth year of its existence, and
its increasing subscription list is the best guarantee of
its success. During its publication it has steadily
kept in view the cause it advocates, and in its columns
the more important proceedings of the Society have
been given to the public. Short stories, sketches and
other interesting miscellany, appropriate to the char-
acter of the paper, have tended largely to increase its
circulation, and make it valuable as a household

journal.

“ OUR ANIMAL FRIENDS.”

This new addition to the literature of the Society
has now nearly completed its Second volume, and as
the paper is intended especially for the youth of our
country, it should ﬁnd a welcome in every family. It
is beautifully illustrated, and in its columns may be
found anecdotes, sketches and truthful stories about
animals, all tending to reﬁne and elevate the minds of

children.

Annual Subscription for either paper, ONE DOLLAR.
Ofﬁce of Publication, 100 Nassau Street, New York
City.

\CRUELTY T0 ANIMALS .PREVENTED.

During the same period, and in the cities of New
York and Brooklyn alone, the agents of the Society
prevented the perpetration of cruelty and abuse of
animals on the streets upon two thousand and ten oc:
casions. The animals were suffering from various
causes; but in these cases there was no evidence of
intentional cruelty on the part of the drivers, and the
evils were remedied by the horses being relieved from
labor. No arrests being made, the drivers and owners
were only cautioned.

The animals were employed as follows :

Horses attached to street cars ........ - ......................... 275
“ “ stages. . .- .................................. 116
“ “ licensed vendor wagons ..................... 490
“ “ ‘ express wagons. . . . . ........................ 310

Matilda Bergh, for kindly defraying the cost of the
new drinking hydrant for man and beast, placed in
front of the new Post Ofﬁce.

Also to the New York Safe Deposit Company, for
the free use of a safe in their building.
- Also to the Western Union Telegraph Company, for
affording the Society great telegraphic facilities.

Also to Mr. Frank Leslie, for kindly printing, gra-

A REWARD 0F MERIT.

At their meeting on the 4th December, 1876, the
following Resolutions were unanimously passed:

“Resolved, That this Committee has heard, with pro-
found satisfaction, that an ofﬁcer of the Ninth Pre-
cinct Police of this City, named Philip C. Bliel, did, at
imminent peril to his own life, rescue from the river,
at the foot of West Tenth Street, a drowning horse.

“This Society, whose peculiar province itis to protect
dumb animals, gladly avails itself of this occasion, to
thus ofﬁcially bear testimony to the heroic benevolence
of Ofﬁcer Bliel, and further takes this method of testi-
fying its high appreciation of his generous conduct.

“ Resolved, That the foregoing be suitably engrossed
and presented to the gallant ofﬁcer in question.”
