TYPICAL

COMMENTS

. . . . about the Animal Welfare Institute

 

 

PROMINENT leaders in the ﬁelds of scientiﬁc research
and animal protection have commented most favorably
on the establishment of the Animal Welfare Institute.

Some typical observations:

CONFIRMING THE NEED FOR THE INSTITUTE

”I bare been greatly interested in tbe prospectus of tbe
Animal Welfare Institute. Your plans seem to me to be
sound and well worked out. Tbere is need for sucb an
institute. In particular, I like your constructive approacb
to tbe problem of tbe bumane bundling of laboratory
animals.” Lee R. Dice, Director,
Institute of Human Biology,

University of Michigan,
Ann Arbor, Michigan.

”I have great hopes that the Animal Welfare Institute
will be able to obtain some constructive suggestions for
solving our research problems and wish you all success
with this project.”

Rutherford T. Phillips, Secretary,

Pennsylvania Society for the Prevention

of Cruelty to Animals,
Philadelphia, Pa.

"I was mucb interested in your outline for a prospectus for
tbe betterment of tbe status of small animals in tbe role
tbey play in tbe ﬁeld of human and veterinary bealtb work.
It is certainly time tbat tbe opposing factions are united
in an eﬂort to bring about bumane but continued use of

small animals in tbis ﬁeld.”
D. B. Meyer, D.V.M.,
Division of Laboratories,
Michigan Department of Health,
Lansing, Michigan.

"You are to be congratulated for setting forth so clearly
your aims and plans and when the program is brought
to fruition, it will be a real contribution to all con-
cerned.”

Gerald R. Dalmadge, Superintendent,

The Palo Alto Humane Society
Palo Alto, California.

”Tbe outline indicates tbat you bane given the subject
tbougbt and tbat tbose responsible for its preparation bat/e
made a good approacb.”

mentation. -

An educational organization with a unique approach
to the question has been established. The release will
explain its purpose briefly. You are free to publish it
in its entirety or in part, as space permits.

ANIMAL WELFARE INSTITUTE

JUDSON 6-3180 ‘

FOR RELEASE: September 24th

The Animal Welfare Institute is a new, non-profit, member-
ship organization whose primary function will be factfinding
and information—dispersing regarding the controversial question
of the use of animals for research in laboratories. The Institute
will seek to prevent_suffering to animals in the laboratory phase
of medical research, and will endeavor to promote the welfare of.
all animals. Its President is Christine Stevens, of Ann Arbor,
Michigan.

Mrs. Stevens has been active in humane programs in her home
state, and currently is Chairman of the Shelter Committee of
the Humane Society of Washtenaw County at Ann Arbor, which oper—
ates a new $100,000 Animal Shelter there. According to Mrs.
Stevens, the Animal welfare Institute will "seek to function
with a solid background of fact as a clearing house for informa-
tion on animal welfare, especially the use of animals in labora-
tories," and that while the Institute is interested in £3231
phase of animal welfare, it will at present concern itself
primarily with humane safeguards in the use of animals for
research and medicine."

Executive and Information offices of the Institute have been

established at 730 Fifth Avenue, New York 19, N. Y.

XECUTIVE and information of-

ﬁces of the Animal Welfare
Institute have been established at
730 Fifth Avenue, New York 19,
N.Y. The new non-proﬁt organiza-
tion is headed by Mrs. Christine
Stevens, of Ann Arbor, Michigan,
and its function, although concerned
with every phase of animal welfare,
will be chieﬂy faCt ﬁnding and dis-
persing information on the contro-
versial question of the use of ani-

mals for research in laboratories.

Mrs. Stevens is currently chair-
man of the Shelter Committee of
the Humane Society of Washtenaw
County at Ann Arbor, where the
society’s $100,000 Animal Shelter
opened its doors only a year or so
ago.

According to Mrs. Stevens, the
Animal Welfare Institute will, “seek
to function with a solid background
of fact as a clearing house for infor-
mation on animal welfare, especially
the use of animals in laboratories.”

Dangerous For Everybody

HE HUNTING SEASON again un-

der way, the State Division of
Fish and Game has announced the
cost in life and limb (to the hunt-
ers, not the hunted) during last
year’s sport. Nineteen California
nimrods lost their lives in 1930 and
non-fatal firearms accidents account-
ed for 54 injuries. If this seems de-
plorable, compare with 1948 when
we topped the nation with 38 hunt-
ers dead.

The Division reports that the
most unusual accident last year
caused the death of 15-year—old Ken-
neth Brown of Napa. With a com-
panion, Kenneth came upon a ﬂock
of feeding wild geese. In a vain
attempt to make the birds fly, he
swung his shotgun like a club and

accidentally discharged it into his
chest. More than half of the year’s
fatal gunshot wounds were inﬂicted
by persons under the age of 21.

Hunters are also warned by the
Division that the recent California
State Legislature added a number of
new restrictions to the Fish and
Game Code, making it unlawful,
among Other things, to:

Hunt when intoxicated;

Carry a loaded rifle or shotgun in
any vehicle traveling — or even
standing—on any highway or pub-
lic way;

Spotlight any game animal while
carrying a firearm or weapon;

Kill or wound any human, while

hunting.

OPPONENTS 70F VIVISECTION, as well as all other '

animal lov-

ers Who constantly denounce wholesale surrender of stray and impound-
ed pets to laboratories, are to have a strong new helping hand in the

recently formed Anim .

This group, including 1n its mem-
bership and directorate some of the
most prominent persons in animal
welfare work in the United States,
13 dedicated to the idea that so
1011;; as vivisection is tolerated for
scientiﬁc purposes there should be
a watch kept upon it, the effort

_.being to reduce as much as possible

the useless experimentation now
:said to be done 1n certain unethical
institutions, and to work toward

r'reducing actual pain inflicted on

_ animals subjected to these lab-
Oratory tests.

The institute seeks Some area of
cooperation among three groups:
ithose medical men who want free,
unrestricted use of any number of
“animals for experimentation; the
”anti-:vivisectionists, who insist that
'fno'ne be so used, and those humane

Societies and animal groups who
"do not Want to surrender pound
g animals, but who recognize that a

certain number of animals are'

needed for theSe expeiiments.
, The institute is strongly against
the surrender, anywhere, of stray

d'ogs impounded to await rescue by

‘owners or to be placed again in

7 . hpmes. .

The executive secretary, at the
address given above, is Miss Es-
tella Draper. The group welcomes
the cooperation of humane workers

isleverywhere who wish to assist in

the surveys which will be con-

ducted constantly as efforts gather

momentum in the drive against
cruelty and ruthlessness.
Associate and contributing mem-
berships are accepted
THANK YOU VERY MU

how much I appreciate your weekly
column. It has alWays seemed to
me that since animals have always

SEVERAL READERS have
Written in to comment on the in-

cats from stalking birds in the
back yard. A majority of the writ-

pﬁerience of using a tiny bell
aWtached to kitty’ s collar when the
pet is allowed outside for an air-

Conversation ? ‘

Don’t Be 91W
Start Talkmg

By DORIS BLAKE

Still they arrive in the 17.1ail,
qu ‘ after query, from girls com.-
ing that they don’t know how
talk when out in company. They
are embarrassed, tongue tied, com-=-
pletely' at a loss to think of some
topic of conversation.

What can they do about it? The
original trouble often lies in shy-
ness the individual has not learned
to Overcome. It is natural when
one is shy to keep 'in the back-
ground and let others do the talk-
ing. So, the ﬁrst thing to do is to
gain conﬁdence in yourself, yo on
who are afflicted
with this social drawback.

Unless it’s an advanced case of
bashfulness, which could need out-
side aid, this timidity can be con-
quered by giving yourself a good
talking to, telling yourself that you
are as intelligent and personable as
the next person and that you have
no reason. to retire into a shell. ‘

Once having established this
point with yourself there comes
the matter of how to talk with

.others. One of the most important

requirements of an easy conversa-
tionalist is to be informed on world
topics, the arts and sciences, the
latest books, plays and sports.

By doing as much reading as you

‘can ﬁnd time for, you will have

ready in your mind subjects to dis-
cuss with people interestetd 1n mat-
ters along various lines. The thing
to do is to feel out the person to
Whom you must talk and ﬁnd his
or her interests.

Then you can draw upon what
you have learned about the subject
and enter into an intelligent discus-
And remember, don’t think
you have to do all the talking. "It
takes two to make a conversation.

“WE KNEW that puppies were
always falling out of cages.
Well we just decided they wouldn’t
fall out.

These words, spoken by M1s.Chris-
tine Stevens, secretary of the Ann
Arbor Humane Society, very well sum
up the principles that dominated the
plans for the recently-completed new
shelter of the Humane Society of
Washtenaw County, located between
the two major centers of Washtenaw
County, Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti,
Michigan.

The puppies don’t “fall out” in the
new shelter because they can’t. They
are not kept in the usual tiered cages.
They have a special nursery where
the enclosures are built on the prin-
ciples of baby play pens with open
tops.

There were also very ﬁrm opinions
on the sizes of cages, for better com-
fort, health and efﬁciency. Being
“very anti—small cages,” according to
Mrs. Stevens, the two tiers of cages
in the observation wards, for incom-
ing dogs and cats, are spacious and

of varied sizes, to accommodate either
small or large dogs, or individual lit-
ters of kittens. All incoming animals
are kept in the observation wards for

at least 24 hours, or longer if there
“is argy indication of illness. For sick
.-;-__;an1ma?lsg there are special isolation

q "'frs, built expressly for such con-
tingencies

TPSéSe quart-ers, like all the rest of
the kennel are kept light and airy by
the carefully thought—out arrange-
ment and size of the many windows.
There is radiant heati. g and aven-
tilating system. There are germicidal
lamps, spaced just as directed by the
manufacturer for the best efﬁciency
and there are built-in, self-operating
water fountains in each individual
kennel stall. All of these labor-saving
features, the construction, and archi-
tectural beauty of the building itself
can be well adapted to a small animal
hospital or a breeder’s. or a boarding
kennel, with the same practical ad-
vantages.

With always “the ideal” in mind,
nearly a year was spent in study and
planning of the shelter before it was
erected. The president of the Society,

 

Edward H Eran“??? embers 0f the
Board.I of jirectors and of the arbhi-tq
tectural and engineeIing ﬁrms, GiHels

and Vallet, Inc., and L. Rossetti car-
ried on an extensive correspondence
and visited shelters throughout the
United States in order to acquaint
themselves with the best features of
each. The new shelter was made pos—
sible through the gift of the Matthaei
Foundaﬁon.

A unique feature of the shelter is
the use of Plexiglas in the swinging,
self-operating doors between the in-
side kennels and outdoor runs. The
Plexiglas was the inspiration of one
of the architects based on his experi-

doors has worked wonders. Even dogs
that have had no previous experi-
ence with the operation .of swinging
doors use them readily when they can
see through them. Moreover, the dogs
are more quiet and contented when
they can sit and look out through their
window—doors. The walls of the quar-
ters are glazed brick and tile, with
ﬂooring of Gibraltar concrete.

There are individual enclosures for
ninety-one animals in the shelter. A
garage is attached to the shelter build-
ing and a second building includes
additional garage space along with a
barn for the accommodation of large
animals. There is also a residence for
the shelter manager on the three and
a half country acres. A campaign was
carried on by the Society in order to
qualify for the Matthaei Foundation’s
gift which included land, fencing and
landscaping, in addition to the build-
ings. The ofﬁcer’s residence was ﬁ-

A complete record of each dog is
maintained in a day ledger and by
card system. Reference cards identi-
fying each dog, even to personality
and habits, are kept on a bulletin
board, with duplicate cards on the
dog’s kennel enclosure.

When dogs are given for adoption,
the recipient is required to give refer-
ences, gets a little talk on the respon-
sibility of pet ownership, and is
presented with a leaﬂet on proper
care. Adoptions are followed up by
personal visits, or by mail. Females
are given for adoption only upon
agreement that the new owners will
have them spayed.

The Ann Arbor Humane Society is
not content with the new shelter, ﬁne
as it is, but is already engaged in an-
other campaign for certain additional
clinical equipment which the heads of
the 01””31‘112 zation feel is needed if their
“ideal of ideals” in an animal shelter
is to be fully realized.

One extreme viewpo int talks about
the Institute. . . . . .

 

ONE HUNDRED FORTY—EIGHT

 

Loniofgrelaxing its
efforts to procure additiﬂ *5'5ijdogs and cats for
laboratory experimental"‘Efﬁfﬁﬁposes. They have
been beaten badly on halfll‘i‘v‘lgiudozen legislative

fronts this year, espec1allymleadmg states such,

as MassachuSetts, New Yorkfé-‘i‘and Pennsyl—
vania. Now that their efforts to break thru
legally in these States have failed, they are re—
sorting to backdoor methods to break down the
united effort 0f humanitarian workers. The

latest trick employed is the Animal Welf. r6,

Institute. This is a high—soun mg organization

“founded by a_ group of people proclaiming

themselves as interested in the welfare and
promotion of humane treatment of animals
with ofﬁces at 730 5th Avenue, New York 19,
New York. Four of the ﬁve members of the
Board of Directors are medical doctors. The

aims and principles of the Institute are well and

clearly stated in a pamphlet recently distributed
by this group. In the opening pamphlet they
contend that——

l—Anti—Vivisectionists demand the abolition
of animal experimentation.

2——Experimental biologists demand unlimited

supplies of animals for research.

3————Sincere humanitarians believe both ex—
tremes wrong and want a middle course.
. The Institute sets out three suggestions as
a remedy to the existing conﬂict between the
ViviSectors and those completely opposed to
laboratory experimentation. In their ﬁrst sug—
gestion they propose the establishment of a
code for the handling and use of laboratory
animals. This technique is an old one devised
to divide the Anti—Vivisectionists. To establish
such a code is to condone the cruelty of vivi—
section and endorse the evil contained therein.
We can rest assured from long experience
if we were foolish enough to agree to such a
code, it Would be operated by the vivisectors
and not by humanitarians. Here we are re—

minded of the basic principle of our work “We

,cannot do evil that good may accrue.” Any

adherence or endorsement to suchaa suggestion
would mean complete abandonment of all our
ideals. Under the foregoing,Circumstances, it is
scarcely worthwhile discussing the other two
recommendations. We are now in the position
of the French King who visited one of his
Cities in the South offrance. Failingto receive
the customary gun "salute he summoned the
Mayor and demanded an explanation. The
Mayor offered 100 good reasons fOr his failure
to extend the customary royal welcome. The
King asked for the ﬁrst one and ,the Mayor
replied—I have no guns. Don’t mind the other .
99 reasons answered the King.

The Institute proposes to lessen the suffering
of animals undergoing laboratory experiment
without the slightest suggestion of. how to
reduce the pain suffered by animals in experi-
ments where they are kept days and weeks
without food and water, not a- word of course
about abolishing such worthless experiments
completely. The entire Warp and woof of the
structure of the Institute is false. It is a red
herring drawn across the trail of honest
humane workers in an effort to break up our
united front exempliﬁed in our hard won
victories in the recent legislative battles.

It is interesting to note that the Institute
has the endorsement of several alleged humane
leaders. We are of course not surprised to see
among the endorsers the names of Sydney H.
Coleman, Executive Vice—President of the
American Society for Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals of New York City, and also the
name of Albert H. MacCarthy, President of the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Ani—
mals, Anne Arundel County, Annapolis, Marya
land. This is the same MacCarthy that suggested
a model bill to be enacted in the 48 states of our
Union to legalize the vivisection of all animals.

NEW GROUP STATES POSITION
ON ANIMAL STUDIES

Recently announced is the formation of
a group known as the Animal Welfare

111inimizing of animal experlmentatlon

the Universities Federation for Animal
Welfare. British medical scientists have ex-

respect and inﬂuence by giving assurance
of belief in animal experimentation. How-
ever, the British scientists say When a prac—
tical question affecting the conduct of re-
search or teaching involving animals comes
up, the U.F.A.W. frequently talggs a stand
to obstruct investigation along51d "tithe anti-
vivisectionists.

Leading ﬁgures in the: .
Institute are Mr. and Mars
vens. i .
ofﬁcial and daughter of ph' siologist Robert
Gesell of the University of Michigan. Mr.
Stevens heads a real estate syndicate which
this year acquired the Empire State Build-
ing in New York.

Prospectus Gives Program

In an initial prospectus, Mrs. Stevens
states that the leaders of the Animal Wel-
fare Institute recognize the need for animal
experimentation but that they believe that
scientists have gone to an extreme in ask—
ing that some of the unwanted animals usu-
ally killed in public pounds be saved for
experimental use. This, she contends, inter—
feres with the normal operations of humane
organizations which frequently collect and
kill stray dogs and cats under contract with
municipalities or counties.

Mr. and Mrs. Stevens and several of their
associates Were concerned in the defeat of
an animal research bill in New York this
year and in the crippling of another in Illi-
nois. The group is now considering the
presentation of alternative legislation simi-
lar to the British vivisection act.

The program of the Animal Welfare In-
stitute, as outlined in its prospectus, has
three elements:

1) Care: The establishment of a code for
the handling and use of laboratory ani-
mals'ﬂof all species. This will include
the establishment of criteria for pain-

inﬂiction in scientiﬁc experiments, and
standards for its justiﬁcation.

Research: The encouragement of medi-
cal research of the highest possible
quality as opposed to mere quantity.
This will include a survey and study of
research needs, with estimates of the
numbers, types of animals used, and
supply sources. Also, investigation into
present methods whereby animal suf-
fering may be minimized and numerical
requirements reduced.

Procurement: The survey of existing and
proposed programs for the procurement
of laboratory animals in an effort to dis-
cover the best methods without jeop-
ardizing practical animal welfare work,
or the general advancement of humani—
ty. This will include the survey and
study of state and local legislation, ef—
fective or pending, involving treatment
of animals and their procurement.

Officers and Advisory Board

Ofﬁcers of the Animal Welfare Institute
are: Christine Stevens, President; Alfred
R. Glancy, Jr., Vice President; Robert A.
Hendrickson, Jr., Secretary; Roger L. Ste-
vens, Treasurer; Helen Hanzlick, Assistant
Treasurer, Estella Draper, ExeCutive Sec-

retary.

Members of an Advisory Committee are:
Dr. Lee R. Dice, Director, Institute of Hu-
man Biology, University of Michigan; Dr.
Robert Gesell, Professor of. Physiology,
University of Michigan; Dr. Eric H. Han-
sen, President, Massachusetts Society for

In his work, .“T he Tyranny of W ord‘s”
Stewart Chase points out at length the damag—
ing effect that certain words have on the human
mind. Words when used. often enough can
come to have an entirely different meaning to
the original intention. Words can be made to
convey to the listener a complete distortion of
fact. Through the agency of clever and wily
propaganda the A. M. A. are now fast at work
using words to befog ardent and. earnest
animal humane workers. The word involved is
R E G U lg A T l O N. We are led to believe
that the cruelty in vivisection will. disappear
with the advent of the magic word regulation.
If we can only have Regulation the millennium
is at hand and this will be especially true. when
the demand for regulation comes from alleged
leaders of Humane Associations. Few people
stop to analyze the motive behind some of the.
suggestions we are treated to or examine the
character of. the person suggesting changes and

i new ideas. Last month we devoted our entire

Column to a discussion of the Anim N" "

.. 30 5th. Avenue. New Y o rk 19,
T Y. We pointed out that the promoters of
this organization are medical doctors. vivim
sectors, and the. powerful drug companies. All
through their promotion propaganda runs the
word Regulation. Here are some additional
facts on the Institute submitted to us by Michael
Moukhanoff, President of the linternational
Conference against Vivisection.

First of all Mrs. Stevens who is PICSlClCHt of
this Institute is a daughter of a vivisector, Dr.
Gesell, Professor of Physiology. I think this
explains a lot.

The organization. is located in luxurious
surroundings, occupying the entire ﬂoor of the
24—story of 750 Fifth Avenue, corner of 57th
Street. The expense of this location would
certainly indicate considerable funds behind
this endeavor.

We ﬁnd that they are movimg along fast.
receiving support not only from scientiﬁc
organizations, but from prominent humane

leaders as well.

The following persons here enthusiastically
endorsed the Institute: 4
Carlton E. Buttrick, Pres, The Animal Rescue

League of Boston.

B. F. Sook, Gen. Man, Mohawk and Hudson

River Humane Society, Albany.

Sydney H. Coleman, Ex, V—P., The American

S P. C. A.

Albert H. hilacCarthy. Pres. of the Annapolis

S P. C. A., Maryland.

Dr. \V’. A. Young. \I an. Din. The Anti-Cruelty
Society, Chicago.

in addition to this list of “Humane" leader's,
we have a number of scientiﬁc organizations
and scientists of more or less vivisectiona-l
tendencies, as the case may be. These includf,

So the principal. and all—sufﬁcient ol‘1jection
to regulation, legal or voluntary, is that it will
not work, and if it did. itwould be a 111iserable
compromise. A. compromise may be, in political
matters, a forward. step toward the desired
end, but a compromise witha * moral wrong is
a bacl {ward step ft is an exhibition of weakness
in the face oi: the enemy, a despairing admission
that the wrong is tot.) 1.11:)werful. to be done away
with.

As for its being an entering wedge opening
the: u ay to 120111} >lete abolition later on, it seems .
to this wrlterv at least 1easonably certain that
the effect gld be just the opposite of that.
If a regtil,_. 711g act 11 me once passed 11. 1th the

approxal of vivisectionists and antinvivisection~-

  
 

'ists, it would be received. by legislators and
people as a compromise sz‘ttisfactmjy to both

sides, settling the controversy for all time.

Thereafter, it would l)( doubly lifﬁcult to
stir up interest in the Subjict or regain laithful
workers discouraged by the surrender. if at

3313’ S‘UbSCquent time an effort were made to

obtain anti—vivisection legislation, it would
probably meet with a refusal. “You got the
compromise you wanted. You. ought to be con‘
tented with that. il)on’t ask us to interfere
again."

a Reign of Cruelty such as ' world has

in other words, trying to take the cruelty
out of yivisection is like trying to take the
wetness out of water. So the Victoria Street

being an Act for the protection of animals, is‘fm

THE STORY OF THE ANIMAL WELFARE INSTITUTE

The bitter controversy between anti~vivisectionists and
research scientists, and the urgent need for greater protection
of laboratory animals, were chiefly responsible for the recent
establishment of the Animal Welfare Institute, a nation-wide
organization with headquarters at 730 Fifth Avenue, New York.

Recognizing the need for bridging the wide gap now exist-
ing between the two groups, with regard to the use of animals
for experimentation, Christine Stevens of Ann Arbor, Michigan
made a comprehensive study of the subject, and soon realiZed
that some middle ground must be established on which sincere
humanitarians might meet and work for the welfare of both men
and animals. Being the daughter of a physiologist who uses
laboratory animals and also being a humane society worker, Mrs.
Stevens was convinced this middle ground was possible, and that
there need be no actual conflict between humanitarianism and

science.

Mrs. Stevens is the wife of Roger L. Stevens, who is well

known in both real estate and theatrical fields (he heads the
syndicate that recently purchased the Empire State Building

and is a member of the Playwrights Company). Mrs. Stevens first
became interested in organised humane work during World War II
when her husband was in the Navy and they were living in Miami.
Becoming outraged when their landlady dumped unwanted kittens

along a roadside to starve, Mrs. Stevens communicated with

 




officials of the Miami humane organization and began working
with them during her stay in Florida. Upon her return to Ann

Arbor, she took an active part in the local Humane Society of

Nashtenaw County, and was appointed to fill a vacancy on its

board.

A model shelter for the Society was built last April by
the Matthaei Foundation whose gift is estimated at $100,000.
Mrs. Stevens was active in the designing of the shelter and the
raising of funds for its equipment. This shelter serves the
Washtenaw County communities of Ann Arbor, Ypsilanti and Willow;
Run. The result of a year and a half of research in shelter
design efficiency, it has radiant heated floors, germicidal,
lamps. A special plumbing system keeps fresh, cool water run-
ning to the drinking fountain in each kennel, and plexiglass
swinging doors allow each animal to see for himself if conditions
are favorable for a romp in his own individual outside run.

Toward the end of 1950 Mrs. Stevens came to realize that
humane societies were fighting for their very existence because
of increasing demands made upon them by organized medical re-
search for animals for experimental use. It is contrary to the
ethical principles and the purposes for which humane societies
were founded to release animals for painful experimentation.
Humane societies have operated as a public trust, financed
largely by charitable contributions, since the civil War era.
In the few states and cities where forced surrender legislation
has been passed, some humane work had come to a standstill, and

some top officials had resigned their posts in protest. The

 




burden to taxpayers for maintenance of animal shelters under
civil operatibn has increased as much as 70% over its former
cost.

The whole subject of animal experimentation ~~ methods of
procurement, regulation of practices, etc. -- therefore became
of immediate concern to Mrs. Stevens. Her research indicated

that Great Britain was the leader in legislation for the pro-

tection of animals. The British law of 1876 called "The Cruelty

to Animals Law" was sponsored by the leading scientists of the
day -~ Darwin, Huxley and Jenner. Its main provisions were 1)
the limiting of experimentation on living animals to bona fide
scientific purposes; 2) the licensing of research workers and
the places where they work; 3) the inspection by Home-Office
inspectors; M) the laying down of the "pain condition."

Before it was passed it was amended after considerable
discussion to take full account of research methods. In 1912
a Royal Commission was appointed to examine the results of the
law. It sat for six years, and recommended that the number of
inspectors should be increased; that research should be centra—
lized as far as possible; that curare (a paralysant) should
not be used at all unless an inspector is present; etc. But
its most radical recommendation related to the pain condition
attached to licenses. It stated that inspectors should be
empowered to order the killing of an animal, and that the Home
Secretary should require "that in all cases in which in the
opinion of the experimenter, the animal is suffering severe

pain which is likely to endure, it shall be his duty to cause

 




-h-

its painless death, even though the object of the experiment
has not been obtained."

The laboratory animal in Great Britain also has behind
him a remarkable organization called the Universities Federation
for Animal Welfare. Founded in 1926 by Major Charles W. Hume
as the "University of London Animal Welfare Society," it began
with a membership of two. By 1938 it had branches in ten colleges
of the University of London and in that year also membership.was
extended to other universities and its name was changed to the
present one. Its activities are guided, in assessing the rela-
tive importance of cruel practice, by l) the intensity of the
suffering involved; 2) its usual duration; 3) the number of
animals affected; and A) the feasibility of practical reform.

Its constructive policies with regard to relations between animal
protectionists and research workers was confirmed in 1947 with

the publication of the U.F.A.W. Handbook on the Care and Management
of Laboratory Animals.

Although the use of experimental animals is worldwide, effec-
tive legal control exists in only a few countries. The British
Act of 1876 still applies in Ireland -— Switzerland, Denmark and
Sweden have some regulation, and several countries have laws but
little or no machinery for enforcing them.

By summer of 1951 Mrs. Stevens had a clear picture of what
the organization should accomplish. She named it the Animal

Welfare Institute and it was incorporated as a non-profit organi-

zation on July ll, 1951. To be doubly certain that there was a

place in our society for an Animal Welfare Institute, a trial

mailing went out to a selected list of 7% prominent leaders in
the fields of scientific research and animal protection. It
stated clearly the Institute's aims, purposes, and objectives.
The replies she received removed any doubt of its need° Follow—
ing are two typical comments:

Dr. Dwight J. Ingle, of the Upjohn Company in Kalamazoo,
Michigan:

"I am in sympathy with any organization which
seeks to promote the humane treatment of animals
while at the same time recognizing the essentials
of animal experimentation in biology and medicine.

"I believe that laboratories engaged in animal ex-
perimentation should be required by law to meet
intelligent requirements as to housing the animals
and as to humane care. I believe that all indivi-
duals who are trained to do animal experimentation
should be taught to give the animals the best
possible care and to avoid pain where possible."

From Carlton E. Buttrick, President of The Animal Rescue
League of Boston:

"It seems to me very well organized and certainly
contains the basis for the Animal Welfare Institute
to begin sound operation. Its purpose and scope
should be of extreme interest to everyone in the
humane field as well as those using animals for
experimentation. The whole field of animal ex~

perimentation and control -- including the source
of supply -- needs a study that will be based on
facts." -

Others in the same vein came from educators, editors,
veterinarians and government officials and are now on file at
Animal Welfare Institute headquarters.

An Advisory Committee was subsequently formed, and it

consists of these outstanding scientists and professional

humanitarians:

 




Dr. Lee R. Dice, Director, Institute of Human
Biology, University of Michigan;

Dr. Robert Gesell, Professor of Physiology,
University of Michigan;

Dr. Eric H. Hansen, President, Massachusetts
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals;

Dr. Peter Okkelberg, Emeritus Professor of Zoology
and Emeritus_Associate Dean of the Graduate School,
University of Michigan;
David Ricardo, Secretary, British Columbia Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. .
The Prospectus of the Institute outlines the proposed
Operations of the Animal Welfare Institute, which includes
surveys and studies of such matters as:
l) The codes and practices currently in effect governing

the use and handling of laboratory animals.

Estimates on numbers, sources, and types of animals

State and local legislation, effective or pending,
involving treatment of animals or their procurement.

A) And most important, it will function ~~ with a solid

background of fact —- as a clearing houSe of information and

ideas on animal welfare, especially on the use of laboratory
animals. Results of the Institute's research surveys will be
made public through bulletins, news releases, and such other
media as befits the information to be projected.

"The Institute," its prospectus goes on to say, "will
support the good_work done by other organizations, and enlist
their aid in its own endeavors. It will recognize the legitimate

claims of scientists and humanitarians alike."

 




The Animal Welfare Institute offers two active membership

classifications: The Associate Membership, open (for ten dollars)

to organizations or individuals; and the Contributing Membership,

open (for two dollars) to individuals only.

The ethical principles which will guide the work of the
Institute have been well expressed by Dr. Albert Schweitzer, world~
renowned physician, and are quoted in the prospectus as follows:

"Ethics in our western world has hitherto been
largely limited to the relation of man to man.
But that is a limited ethics. We need a bound—
less ethics which will include the animals also.

"What does reverence for life say about the re-
lations between men and the animal world? When-
ever I injure any kind of life I must be quite
certain that it is necessary. I must never go
beyond the unavoidable.....

"Those who experiment upon animals by surgery and
drugs, or inoculate them with diseases in order

to be able to help mankind by the results obtained,
should never quiet their consciences with the con-
viction that their cruel action may in general have
a worthy purpose. In every single instance they
must consider whether it is really necessary to
demand of an animal this sacrifice for man, and
they must take anxious care that the pain be
mitigated as far as possible....

"By the very fact that animals through these
painful experiences have contributed so much of
value to suffering mankind, a new and special
bond of solidarity has been established between
them and us. From this arises the obligation
for each of us to do every possible good to
all animals everywhere."

The Animal Welfare Institute

AN ORGANIZATION founded by a

group of persons interested in the pro-

morion of humane treatment of animals.

The Institute was incorporated as a
non-proﬁt organization under the laws

of Delaware.

Its interests and membership will be

nationwide.

Headquarters are located at
730 Fifth Avenue, New York 19, N. Y.

 

PURPOSE AND SCOPE
The aim of the Institute will be:
0 To promote the welfare of all animals.

0 To reduce the total of pain and fear

inﬂicted on animals by man.

 




W HILE THE INSTITUTE is interested in every phase of animal
welfare, it will, at present, concern itself particularly with humane
safeguards in the use of animals for research and medicine.

This is one aspect of humane work that has received very little
practical attention in the United States. As a result, standards for
the use of laboratory animals vary from individual to individual,
from institution to institution.

 

‘ At present, animal experimentation is a subject on which opin-
ion differs importantly:

 

1. Anti-vivisectionists demand the abolition of animal ex-
perimentation.

2. Some experimental biologists, deeming themselves ham-
pered by unsatisfactory supplies of animals needed for
research and by anti-vivisectionist activity, counter by de-
manding the forced surrender of unlimited numbers of
animals from public and semi-public sources.

3. Sincere humanitarians who have not opposed animal ex-
perimentation are having their constructive work made
diﬂicult, and in some instances impossible, by those scien-
tists who react to anti-vivisecrionist extremes by them-
selves going to opposite lengths.

On the urgent problem of laboratory animals, therefore, the
Institute will have the following immediate aims:

1. Care: The establishment of a code for the handling and
use of laboratoryanimals.

The Institute will interest itself in all species of experi-
mental animals.

2. Research: The encouragement of medical research of the
highest possible quality as opposed to mere quantity.

The development of techniques that will reduce to a mini-

mum both the pain suffered by animals and the number of
animals required.

 




3. Procurement Programs: The survey of existing and
proposed programs for the procurement of laboratory
animals in an effort to discover the best method of satis-
fying the needs of humanity in the advancement of medi-
cine, public health, agriculture, etc., without jeopardizing
practical animal welfare work or the general advance-
ment of humanity through increasing consideration for
all living creatures. '

SOME BASIC PRINCIPLES
FOR THE INSTITUTE

In its efforts to promote animal welfare, the Institute will be
guided by certain basic considerations:

1. Animals feel pain (distress, anxiety, discomfort).

There is every scientiﬁc reason for concluding that verte-
brates are capable of suffering. With the lower animals,
the evidence may be less direct, nevertheless observation
even of the invertebrates strongly suggests their sensi-
tivity to pain and discomfort; hence they cannot be safely
overlooked.

2. Criteria for pain-inﬂiction in scientiﬁc experimenta-
tion and standards for its justiﬁcation must be estab-
lisbed as clearly as possible.

No units exist for the measurement of pain. Neverthe-
less, criteria for judging pain-inﬂiction quantitatively
should be deﬁned. These would include such factors as:

a) Intensity of suffering.
b) Duration of suffering.

c) The number of animals affected.

 




 

 

Justiﬁcation for pain-inﬂiction in every instance should
take into account the above factors as they relate to:

a) The ultimate value of the experiment.
b) The feasibility of using other less painful methods.

c) The extent and degree of mental suffering (fear,
anxiety, worry, loneliness, etc.) involved in the
procedures.

Study of all these factors should provide a means for de-
ciding upon the proper limitation of pain-inﬂiction.
These means should be based on the proposition that the
end justiﬁed the means only if these means fall within
reasonable limits.

. A broader ethics is imperative.

The ethical principles that will guide the work of the
Institute have been well expressed by Dr. Albert Schweit-
zer, world-renowned physician, clergyman and philoso-
pher:

"Ethics in our western world has hitherto been largely
limited to the relation of man to man. Bat that is a
limited ethics. We need a boundless ethics which will
include the animals also.”

And again: "What does reverence for life say 450%;
the relations between men and the animal world?
Whenever I injnre any hind of life I mast be qaite
certain that it is necessary. I mast never go beyond the
unavoidable . . .”

"Those who experiment apon animals by sargery Md
drags, or inocalate them with diseases in order to be
able to help mankind by the resnlts obtained, shoald
never qniet their consciences with the conviction that
their crnel action may in general have a worthy par-
pose. In every single instance they must consider




M

whether it is really necessary to demand of an animal
this sacriﬁce for man, and they must take anxious care
that the pain he mitigated as far as possihle . . .”

”By the very fact that animals through these painful
experiences have contrihuted so much of value to suf-
fering manhind, a new and special hond of solidarity
has heen estahlished hetween them and us. From this
arises the ohligation‘ for each of us to do every possihle
good to all animals everywhere.”

4. New developments may mitigate animal suﬁering.

The Institute’s emphasis throughout will be on the needs
of animals and human beings.

While recognizing the importance of animal experimen-
tation in medical and other scientiﬁc research, the Insti-
tute will investigate and seek to foster developments in
experimentation whereby animal suffering may be mini-
mized.

Fields of investigation might include:

a)

b)

Practical replacement of the higher mammals by
much lower forms of life or life in lower stages of
embryonic development (such as chick embryos)
with a view to reducing the suffering undergone by
animals with highly developed nervous systems.

Practical replacement of chronic experiments in-
volving protracted physical or mental suffering by
properly conducted sacriﬁce experiments with a
view to reducing the number of painful experi-
ments.

c) The efficient statistical design of experiments so as

to effect a systematic economy in sampling. For ex-
ample, methods whereby limitation of the number
of variables introduced in an experiment makes
possible the reduction of the number of animals
necessary.

.5.

 




d) The substitution of chemical and physical methods,
whenever possible, for biological methods in ex-
periments or tests.

e) The means of avoiding unnecessary repetition of
experiments.

5. The middle course must prevail.

The Institute believes that humanitarianism and science,
far from being antagonistic, should complement each
other if civilization is to progress.

It opposes, at one extreme, the fraCtion of opinion which
would abolish all animal experimentation. It also op-
poses, at the other extreme, that fraction of opinion which
dismisses the problem raised by animal suffering as trivial
and which is willing to accept, as an unqualiﬁed justiﬁca-
tion for this suffering, the general aim of increased human
comfort and knowledge.

 

The Institute will proceed on the assumption that all hu-
man beings, whatever their speciﬁc beliefs or training,
have a common goal of humanity.

It believes that by informing the public and arbitrating
between extremes, the Institute can foster a climate favor-
able to scientiﬁc progress and animal welfare.

As Dr. E. C. Stakman stated last year in an address as

retiring president of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science:

”There is a need for more understanding and tolerance
between scientists and bamanists: properly motivated,
all are bnmanists, and t/aeir joint contribution can at-
celerate man’s eoolntion toward intellectnal enlig/aten-
ment and spiritnal reﬁnement.”

 




 

 

OPERATION

To achieve the purpose and spread the viewpoint outlined
above, even beyond the narrower scope of its direct operation, the
Institute will make surveys and studies of such matters as these:

1 . Practice:

Codes and practices currently in effect governing the
handling and use of laboratory animals.

2. Research needs:

Estimates on numbers, types of animals, sources.

3. Legislation:

State and local legislation, effective or pending, involv-
ing treatment of animals or their procurement.

 

4. Techniques:

Investigation into methods whereby animal suffering may
be minimized and numerical requirements reduced.

The Institute will seek to function with a solid back-
ground of fact as a clearing house of information on
animal welfare, especially on the use of laboratory ani-
mals.

Results of the Institute’s research surveys will be made
available to the public through bulletins, factual re-
leases and other media.

In its operation, the Institute will support the good work done
by Other organizations and enlist their aid in its own endeavors.
Such organizations would include:

a) Departments of the Federal and State governments.

b) Humane societies.

070.

 




 

 

c) Scientiﬁc and technical associations.
d) Conservation groups.
e) Livestock protection groups.
f) All other bodies interested in animal welfare.
Throughout the Institute will strive for professional and public
acceptance of the besr in animal welfare, by providing a forum

and clearing house for the legitimate claims of scientists and
humanitarians alike. '

The Institute believes that only by thus taking account of all
available related facts can valid and equitable solutions to com-
plex problems be attained.

December, 1951

The Animal Welfare Institute has been established by a group of persons interested
in the humane treatment of all animals. It is particularly interested at present in the
welfare of animals used in laboratories. This is one aspect of humane work that has
received little practical attention in the United States. Present standards for the use
of these animals vary among individuals and institutions.

. Believing that science and humanitarianism should complement one another, the Li—
stitute Will act as a clearing house for information on the welfare of laboratory

~an1mals. It welcomes comment and suggestions from everyone interested in these animals.

‘ _ Vlsns TO =I.ABORATORIES

Care and housing of laboratory animals, as distinct from experimental procedures, is
one of the fields in which facts are being gathered by the Animal Welfare Institute.
Some salient points based on our recent visits to a cross-section of laboratories are
discussed here:

Commendation for good standards of sanitation, ventilation, temperature control,
availability of water, adequacy of diet, reasonable freedom of movement, and interest of
personnel responsible for animal care is deserved in reference to quarters for all
experimental animals at Massachusetts General Hospital; for experimental dogs and cats at
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Research Center; and for dogs used in hypertensive studies at

Cornell Medical School.

In the effort to prevent spread of disease or parasites among laboratory animals,
comfort of these animals may be reduced. However, it is desirable to maintain the highest
possible standards in both disease prevention and comfort. In the case of dogs, outdoor
exercise and wooden resting boards in cages add to their comfort. Improperly used or
maintained, both have been conducive to the spread of disease and parasites, but at
Sloan-Kettering, thorough sanitary scrubbing of wooden bunks has been found to prevent
this problem. Because of an adequate isolation period, immunization, and treatment of
incoming animals, it is possible for the dogs used in hypertensive studies at Cornell to
exercise outside in groups. Careful supervision there prevents fighting.

Small animals at Massachusetts General Hospital are provided with clean bedding,
water bottles, and fresh supplements to the dry diet. Rabbits particularly benefit from
the water bottles. Well-designed drainage in built-in tile kennels makes dog quarters
there easy to clean.

Following is a list of undesirable conditions most commonly encountered in labora-
tories. In some cases, improvements are already being planned:

1. Small cages. Some institutions keep dogs, cats, or rabbits in cages barely large
enough to permit the animal to turn around. Sometimes animals are kept routinely in such
cages for many years. Dogs in small cages, even when debarked, are noisier than dogs in
reasonably large enclosures.

2. Lack of sanitation. The poor effects resulting from incompetent design of equip-
ment and drainage are increased by the employment of inadequate, disinterested personnel
in many institutions. The overpowering odor which is one of the results unfortunately
creates a desire to leave the animal room as soon as possible.

 




3. Infectious disease and parasites. Numerous cases of illness are common 1n some
laboratories, causing unnecessary suffering to animals and adversely affecting the
accuracy of scientific findings.

4. Wire-bottom cages without resting boards or bedding. Animals of all kinds are
confined, in some institutions, to cages of this type regardless of whether or not they
are being used in metabolism studies.

5. Lack of exercise. Exercise wheels -- recommended by authorities on the care and
breeding of laboratory rodents -- are conspicuous by their absence, as are 1nd1V1dual
runways for larger animals.

MEDICAL RESEARCH AND THE HUMANE MOVEMENT

 

Although much unnecessary suffering is inflicted on animals in the United States, it
is rare to see an animal publicly abused by an ordinary citizen. This is the most con-
spicuous accomplishment of the humane movement, for, less than one hundred years ago,
most people argued that ownership of an animal conferred the right to do with it what the
owner would.'The same attitude held true regarding children until Henry Bergh, founder of
the ASPCA, was called to rescue a child from her cruel guardian. Because there was
no law protecting children from cruelty, he broughtler'to court as an animal under the
law which he had recently Sponsored. The child was saved and this was the beginning of
the child protective movement in the United States.

The humane movement, founded in New York City, has continued to grow. For the first
time in its history it is under serious organized attack. Ironically, the attack comes
from a profession whose goals are humanitarian and whose recognition of the importance of
ethical principles is well known.

Insofar as both groups are concerned with the relief of suffering, the work of
medical research and humane societies is in accord, but because one group is specifically
trained to deal with human beings and the other to deal with animals, there is a radical
difference in their evaluation of suffering and death. In the\practice of human medicine,
death is almost invariably considered to be worse than even the most terrible suffering.
In the practice of animal protective work, animal suffering is considered to be worse
than animal death.

The practicing physician morally and conscientiously opposes the infliction of death
on patients in his custody; the professional humanitarian opposes the infliction of
suffering on animals in his custody. Yet there are persons who claim that there are cases
in which it would be to the best interest of a human patient to be spared his last
agonies and that there are cases, too, in which it would be to the best interest of an
animal to be spared a premature death if, by going through an experimental procedure, he
might gain several years of contented life after his laboratory stint. If human ethics
and judgment had reached the level attained byrhuman analytical ability, many a tradition
might be abandoned without concern for the consequences. But a sound tradition cannot be
abolished unless 21 better substitute has been found for it, one in which neither
practical nor ethical considerations are substandard.

CONVENTIONS AND MEETINGS

 

The Animal Welfare Institute was represented at the 75th Annual Convention of the
American Humane Association in Cleveland 1n October. The American Humane Association is a
federation of humane societies and SPCA’S throughout the nation. The Institute exhibit
illustrated the ways in which animals work for us: 1) in laboratories, 2) as friends and
companions, and 3) in business. It also portrayed the aims of the Animal Welfare Insti-
tute’s work for animals: to reduce pain and fear inflicted on them and to promote tlnair
welfare. A diagram showed the floor plan of the Gaines Dog Research kennels at Kankakee,
Illinois, which provides an efficient method of housing experimental dogs and includes
individual outside runways. Its designers and builders are to be congratulated.

 




The center portion of our exhibit consisted

  'mEgE‘n-ucs or EXPERIMENTS oN ANIMALS

 

Major C.VM.Hume, Director of the Universities Federation for Animal Welfare of
London, England, has written an interesting article on this topic which was published in
the British NATURE, February 10, 1951. We quote the opening paragraph which expresses
very well the attitude of the Animal Welfare Institute towards the problem:

“In considering this difficult subject, two principles may be taken for granted.
First, the relief of suffering in medical and veterinary practice depends on the sciences
of physiology, pathology and pharmacology, which in turn depend upon eXperiments on
animals; experimentation is, therefore, in this respect, desirable. Secondly, although
many experiments involve little or no suffering, others do involve various degrees of it,
and the infliction of suffering is per se undesirable. There is thus a partial conflict
between the two principles, and the problem of reconciling them when it is possible to do
so and of deciding what compromise ought to be made when reconciliation is not possible,
is a difficult one which deserves dispassionate study.”

‘1 .EDUCATION

 

"To prepare us for complete living is the function which education has to dis—
charge.” Herbert Spencer.

Conditions under which laboratory animals are currently harbored i9 some Of the
nation’s leading institutions of high learning contradict such an ideal. Animals are used
in universities for the acquisition and demonstration of facts. Their care, hQUS1ng and

and Management of Laboratory Animals. Leading biologists have contributed IE $th 0

DEVELOPMENT OF RESEARCH METHODS WHEREBY

SUFFERING OF LABORATORY ANIMALS MAY BE MITIGATED

The Animal Welfare Institute invites correspondence with scientific research
workers who are in a position to suggest possible methods whereby practical replace-
ments might be made of higher mammals by lower forms of life or life in lower stages of
embryonic development, or whereby properly conducted sacrifice experiments Inight Ine—
place some types of chronic experiments. Also of interest to the Institute are methods
whereby greater economy of sampling may be effected, chenﬁcal_and physical testing
methods, and means whereby unnecessary repetition of painful experiments may be avoided.
Please address such correspondence to Christine Stevens, President, .Animal Welfare
Institute, 730 Fifth Avenue, New York City.

you and mm. ANIMAlS

by WILLIAM H HENDRIX

SENTIMENTALITY AND PRACTICALITY. Through the past
year it has been the privilege of this column to get acquainted with
thousands of persons who love animals and are interested in their pro-

tection and their welfare This
column, begun as a hobby by its
Writer, has blossomed intoua col-
umn that has caught the interest
of great numbers of persons. Truly,

the love for animals is a charm--

teristic shared by most of us.
Happily, it has been possible here

‘ to be of real service in a lot of"

ways. “Pet sitters” have been di-
rected to hundreds of persons wish-
ing pet sitters. In the past few
weeks another undertaking of the
column, that of connecting persons
with animals they could no longer
keep with persons who wished to

“get such pets, has been enormously

successful. We have been able to
thus provide homes for many ani-
mals.

Through all of this activity, the
idea uppermost in the mind of the
Writer has been to contribute
something real in3 behalf of ani-
mals that need help. And the con-
stantly increasing mail shows that
those who read this column share
that longing.

SO LET US DO SOMETHING
'ABOUT IT. This thought is best
expressed by this letter from 'Mrs.
Dorothy Mix, of Biddeford, Maine,
who Writes:

“Dear Mr. Hendrix. I read your
column and I see that you a"

that I am not situated so that I,

can adopt a waif—I live. in a tiny

thing to help, so I am inclosing a
contribution which I hope you will
place where it will do a roal service
for needy animals. And I would
like to urge others, situated as I
am, to do the same. Bless all the
little darlings, and bless you for
your work in their behalf.”

[ Thank you, Mrs. Mix. Your con-
t11'butio11 has “been turned over to
the Ammal Relief League of New
Je1sey, just one of the Many grand
groups serving animal, welfare.
The league will send you a receipt
for it (which of course is deduct-
able in 1nco1ne tax. )

Christine even ,

founder, explains .her‘ “middle
0'rouri‘d’” stand on the eternal con-
ﬂict between the anti-vivisection-
ists, which includes the majority
of real animal lovers, and research
scientists using animals in their
experiments. Recognizing that vivi-
section is being practiced and that
abuses of animals exist, Mrs.
Stevens’ organization seeks to act
as a clearing house of information
and ideas on animal welfare and
the protection of laboratory ani-
mals. Mitigation of suffering she
stresses as the institute’s worthy
goal.

that she and her husband are Wor-
ried about how to provide with cer-
tainty that their beloved dog will
be cared for all his life, if they
should pass away. She says their
lawyer explained that this would
require a trust fund established
and a lot of trouble. He s right, of
course. But why not just select a
good and trusted friend, provide
the funds required.

I DON’T BELIEVE THIS. Al-

me about her extr e1nely lovely
boxer-shepherd dog. Alvera is 14
and, after telling me how lovely her
big dog is, asks if she should send
her to an Anny dog- training camp
for twining. She explains her be-
loved pet is so big, strong and
de1no11st1at1've she and her family
cannot keep her under control.

Now, Alvera, you wouldn’t send
this pal away even if I told you to.
Never mind the Army camp—keep
the dog, which adores you, at home.
She’ll outgrow her outlandish an-
tics as she ages.

”Chang-ti,” a gentleman residing with the Ralph H. Tinkers of Stockbridge, Mass.

0nr-Kitso........ .

OR a long time now I have wanted

to write the story of “Kitso.” How
Kitso came by that peculiar name is
somewhat accidental. Someone began
to call him that for want of something
better, but it was our intention to think
up a truly splendid name for him. Ten
years later he is still known as Kitso.

At ﬁrst glance you might wonder what
we see in Kitso to induce so much af-
fection. Very true, he claims no pedi-
gree. His fur is medium length; the
colors are brown, gray and white. Just
an ordinary tom cat, you say with dis-
dain. But wait! I’ll match Kitso’s per-
sonality and temperament with even
the most glamourous and colorful of
Hollywood stars. He is. as individual
as Mickey Mouse or Tarzan.

When Kitso ﬁrst came to us he was
very young, full of ginger, deviltry and
kitten—fun. At home with us he knew
no fear. When any of the three humans
in his life displeased him, he was more
than willing to rise up onto his strong
back legs and do battle like any experi-
enced boxer. But outdoors he ran into
difficulty. He found himself to be the

relieve ourselves of some responsibility,
we cut a small swinging door in the
basement for Kitso. This he learned
to use after one easy lesson from us.
Many a time he has slithered through,
panting and wriggling an indignant
back. Although we failed to anticipate
Kitso’s enormous adult proportions, he
still manages to squeeze through this
private entrance of his without even
pinching his tail.

Kitso has habits that are as ﬁrmly
ﬁxed in his furry head as are any human’s
habits. For example, it is our custom to
have an evening snack close to the hour
of ten. It matters not whether Kitso
is asleep on his cushion or out prowling
almost on the stroke of the clock he
appears. He is Johnny-on—the-spot and
eager for his half slice of bread that I
always place on the tray. Were I to
break bits of dry bread into his feeding
dish, he would spurn them; he eats with
us at snack time. Who can deny that
our Kitso is a very sociable soul?

When my husband was away during
the last war, Kitso missed spending only
one evening at home with me. Nightly
he slept 0n the foot of my bed (a special
wartime privilege). Yet never once has
he come to the bed since my husband’s
return.

the interest of promoting humane treat-

A booklet published by the Institute
declares its purposes as follows: “While
the Institute is interested in every phase
of animal welfare, it will, at present,
concern itself particularly with humane
safeguards in the use of animals for
research and medicine.”

The booklet, sent out from its head-
quarters at 780 Fifth Avenue, New York
19, N. Y., further states: “Throughout,
the Institute will strive for professional
and public acceptance of the best in
animal welfare, by providing a forum
and clearing house for the legitimate
claims of scientists and humanitarians,
alike.”

Humane Society circles, is most active

we return to ﬁnd Kitso walking sleepily
into the entrance hall. He appears to
be coming from the study where his

If, when I open the door for him, he

that is likely to endure, must do away
with the animals painlessly.

The British Act comes armed with
a full set of sharp teeth. Should a
researcher violate one of the provisions,
he can lose the license he must have
to experiment with animals. Or, if he
is lucky, he will draw a suspension.
Most British scientists are heartily in
favor of the Cruelty to. Animals Act.
It protects the animals from ruthless
researchers whose methods are slipshod.
And it protects the dedicated scientist
from unjust and damaging accusations.

Today more than ever the whole
problem of vivisection cries out for a
sensible, workable solution in the
United States. Nobody knows how
many live animals are today being used
in scientiﬁc experimcnts but just since
1941 funds for research have increased
four times. By anybody’s rule of thumb,
that means animals experiments run
high into the millions every year.

First off, what is needed is at least a

moderate amount of common sense by.
the leaders of the battle which has see-'

sawed back and forth for the last sev-
eral decades with never the faintest
hope of a real decision. Somebody has
got to give and until both sides give at
least a little nobody is going to get
anything done.

What the vivisectionists have to ac-
knowledge is that at least for the pres-
ent animals are important to the scien-
tist and the scientist is important to the
world.

And those scientists who have been
the anti-vivisectionistsbitterest oppo-
nents ought to do a little soul-searching
of their own. They should be ready to
concede that here and there an animal
suffers needlessly at the hands of. a
charlatan. They should concede, too,
that some of the experiments which
have employed hundreds of animals
could have reached the '55» me. oal by
using only dozens. And th scientists
who demand that an unlimr‘l_-_‘;d number
of animals be turned over toﬁhﬁm with
no questions asked should at" least de-
ﬁne what kind of projects they have
in mind. '

tion is nearer to solution than most
suspect. The real answer may come from
an organization founded recently whose
prime concern is the welfare of animals
used for experimentation in laboratories.

The Animal Welfare Institute, as the
group is called, ﬁlls a real need. Its
founding head is Christine Stevens,
whose devotion to dogs and other pets
is widely known. In her home state
of Michigan, Mrs. Stevens is Chairman
of the Shelter Committee of the Hu-
mane Society of Washtenaw County,
which last year completed a $100,000
shelter, one of the ﬁnest in the country.
On its advisory committee are both
practical humanitarians and top experi-
mental biologists, men of the stature of
Dr. Lee R. Dice, Director of the In-
stitute of Human Biology at the Uni-
versity of Michigan.

The Institute has taken its stand
squarely in fhe middle of the no man’s
land which separates the vivisectionists
and the anti-vivisectionists. It will seek
to reduce the amount of pain which

man inflicts on animals, yet not impede

scientiﬁc progress in the slightest.

The task is treacherously complicated
and the Institute is proceeding with the
sensible caution of a man driving an
automobile down an icy road. Right
now, it is busy collecting all the facts
concerning the present laboratory use of
animals. Its surveys will dig on and
will pass along to all concerned the
newer facts that help lessen the suffer-
ing of experimental animals. It will
encourage the development of new
knowledge along the same lines. And it
will tell a confused public why animals
are necessary to today’s researcher. But
in the meantime it will be encouraging
science to ﬁnd ways to use fewer
animals.

At the moment, also, the Institute is
examining the codes that goVern the use

 

Ofﬁcial medicine long ago took a

, humane and practical view on the sub-
ject of vivisection. The American Med-
ical Association, the American Psycho-

logical Association and a number of
other professional groups adopted vol-

of laboratory animals. It is looking into
the question of how they are procured
and how they live as the subject of
experimentation.

Like any group of highly-practical
people who have set out to‘untangle an
enormous problem, the Animal W’elfare

Institute will welcome opinions from

anyone in any ﬁeld at the New York
City headquarters, 730 Fifth Avenue.

  
 
 
 
 
  
   
  
    
   

Someday perhaps science may develop
a mechanical substitute which would
make the live animal about as obsolete
in the scientiﬁc experiment as a horse
would be out of plae at an auto show.

In the meantime, however, neither
the vivisectionists or the anti-vivisec-
tionists have solved anything. Just pos-
sibly the Animal Welfare Institute will
solve the problem.

ANIMAL WELFARE INSTITUTE

730 FIFTH AVENUE, NEW YORK I9, N. Y.
JUdson 6-3I80

December, 1951

The Animal Welfare Institute has been established by a group of persons interested
in the humane treatment of all animals. It is particularly interested at present in the
welfare of animals used in laboratories. This is one aspect of humane work that has
received little practical attention in the United States. Present standards for the use
of these animals vary among individuals and institutions.

. Believing that science and humanitarianism should complement one another, the 1h—
stitute Wlll act as a clearing house for information on the welfare of laboratory

animals. It welcomes comment and suggestions from everyone interested in these animals.

vusns TO LABORATORIES _

Care and housing of laboratory animals, as distinct from experimental procedures, is
one of the fields in which facts are being gathered by the Animal Welfare Institute.
Some salient points based on our recent visits to a cross-section of laboratories are
discussed here:

Cbnmendation for good standards of sanitation, ventilation, temperature control,
availability of water, adequacy of diet, reasonable freedom of movement, and interest of
personnel responsible for animal care is deserved in reference to quarters'for all
experimental animals at Massachusetts General Hospital; for experimental dogs and cats at
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Research Center; and for dogs used in hypertensive studies at

Cornell Medical School.

In the effort to prevent spread of disease or parasites among laboratory animals,
comfort of these animals may be reduced. However, it is desirable to maintain the highest
possible standards in both disease prevention and comfort. In the case of dogs, outdoor
exercise and wooden resting boards in cages add to their comfort. Improperly used or
maintained, both have been conducive to the spread of disease and parasites, but at
Sloan-Kettering, thorough sanitary scrubbing of wooden bunks has been found to prevent
this problem. BeCause of an adequate isolation period, immunization, and treatment of
incoming animals, it is possible for the dogs used in hypertensive studies at Cornell to
exercise outside in groups. Careful supervision there prevents fighting.

Small animals at Massachusetts General Hospital are provided with clean bedding,
water bottles, and fresh supplements to the dry diet. Rabbits particularly benefit from
the water bottles. Well-designed drainage in built-in tile kennels makes dog quarters
there easy to clean.

Following is a list of undesirable conditions most commonly encountered in labora-
tories. In some cases, improvements are already being planned:

1. Small cages. Some institutions keep dogs, cats, or rabbits in cages barely large
enough to permit the animal to turn around. Sometimes animals are kept routinely in such
cages for many years. Dogs in small cages, even when debarked, are noisier than dogs in
reasonably large enclosures.

2. Lack of sanitation. The poor effects resulting from incompetent design of equip-
ment and drainage are increased by the employment of inadequate, disinterested personnel
in many institutions. The overpoWering odor which is one of the results unfortunately
creates a desire to leave the animal room as soon as possible.

County Society Opens a Model
| New Headquarters and Shelter

NATIONAL HUMANE

THE accompanying photographs show a new animal shel-

ter, recently opened by the Washtenaw County Human?
Society in Ann Arbor, Mich., that several experts have”

described as ”near the ultimate ideal” in its provision for the
comfort of animals and its efﬁciency and economy in operation.

A gift of $100,000 from the Matthaei Foundation, headed
by Frederick C. Matthaei, made the new shelter and, its beau-
tifully landscaped three acres of grounds possible. The
Foundation funds provided both the small animal shelter, a
separate barn for a limited number of larger animals, and a
garage. The Washtenaw County Society conducted a suc-

cessful drive for funds with which to construct a harmonizing

residence for the shelter manager.

With ”the ideal” in mind, Society President Edward H.
Kraus, who is Dean-Emeritus of the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts of the University of Michigan, Mrs.
Roger L. Stevens, the society secretary, and the architects,
Giffels and Vallet, Inc., and L. Rossetti, spent nearly a year
in study of animal shelters throughout the country.

The Ann Arbor shelter has radiant heating equipment, a
ventilating system, and germicidal lamps spaced to cover all
of the animal quarters. Every detail of construction, down to
carefully planned round corners and curved curbs in cages, is
designed to achieve the maximum in sanitation and in con-
servation of staff time. The clinic lies conveniently adjacent

to an observation ward in which all incoming animals are

Both dogs and cats hav' . , inside cages, and outside
runs, at their own will.
There is a special nursery room for puppies, with enclo-
sures built on the principle of playpens, with open tops.
The small-animal building also includes a clinic, a kitchen,
a reception room, and an ofﬁce.
Animal quarters are of glazed brick and tile, with Gibraltar

' concrete ﬂooring. Every one of ninety-one individual cages

and pens has a built-in drinking fountain.

The whole building is light and airy.

A garage is attached to the shelter building and a second
garage and barn for accommodation of large animals is nearby.
The site is in a country area about midway between Ann
Arbor and the city of Ypsilanti, which the society serves,
along with all the rest of populous Washtenaw county.

Most animals received at the shelter are brought in as strays
or unwanted animals or are picked up by a society ofﬁcer on
request. The shelter also is used to house animals picked up
by the county dog warden.

In recent months the shelter has been host to horses, rab—
bits, raccoons, a muskrat, skunks, and pigeons, as well as a
great number of dogs and cats. .

The former shelter of the Society had wooden cages of
inadequate size. Animals had to be carried to outside exer-
cise yards, a procedure always hard on shelter staff and often
objected to by the animals. It was originally built as a barn.
Pressure of a constant population growth in Washtenaw
county dictated either an uneconomical enlargement of the
old barn or a new building. The “T” shape of the new
shelter, its designers say, will permit future enlargement
without important architectural problems.

The Society makes a vigorous and constant effort to ﬁnd
homes for all suitable animals. A weekly radio program
includes a listing of all animals currently held at the shelter
for adoption or reclamation by their owners. An unusually
elaborate record is maintained of all animals received. A
card ﬁle even has space for ”personality” traits—an item
helpful in adoption decisions. Persons who adopt animals
receive a leaﬂet on their care. Adoptions are followed up by
the society to make sure that the animals are in a happy home.

Besides operating its shelter and investigating reports of
cruelty in all parts of its territory, the Society conducts one
of the country’s outstanding education programs. It works
constantly in schools and supplies books, magazines, pictures,
and pamphlets to teachers as teaching aids.

Not content with what it already has accomplished, the
Washtenaw County Society now is campaigning for funds for
a new ambulance and additional clinic equipment.

Should animals be used for scien-
tific research?

That question, crux of a battle
between research scientists " and
anti-vivisectionists for, years, pe-
riodically bursts into hot debate.

Christine Stevens of Ann Arbor,

Mich, has stepped into the middle
of it by founding the Animal Wel-

fare Institute created to take .a-

middle-’of-the—road course “to pro-
mote the welfare of all animals and
to reduce the pain and fear in-
flicted on animals by man.”

Mrs. Stevens, a gentle, gray-eyed
young woman is the Wife of Roger
L. Stevens, Detroit real estate op-
erator and head of the syndicate

Empire State building.

She is the daughter of Dr. Rob-
ert Gessell, professor of psychology,
University of Michigan, and the-
niece of Dr. Arnold Gessell, fa-
mous child psychologist and pro-
fessor emeritus of Yale university.

During World war II, while her

Daughter of Scientist

As the daughter of a scientist
and as a worker to prevent cruelty
to animals, she sees both sides of
the controversial question.

. “The institute opposes abolishing
all animal experimentation,” she
says. “It also opposes dismissing
the problem of animal suffering
on the ground that the human race
benefits by scientific research. It
believes that, by informing the
public and arbitrating between ex-
tremes, it is possible to foster a

climate favorable to scientific

progress and animal welfare.”

 

public opinion to an active interest
in the welfare of animals used for
experimental purposes. It' plans to

survey the way animals are {11,st

cured for laboratory reseagefi?" and
hopes‘to establish a codeiforitheir‘
handling and use with specialre-
gard to housing .and suffering. It
will encourage making experiments
without using animals Wherever
possible. - '

Would Use Bacteria

, ‘Instead of using mice and guinea
pigs for vitamin experiments, we
favor the use of micro-organisms
(bacteria) wherever possible,” says
Mrs. Stevens. “Also we favor using
life as low in the animal scale as
possible—such as using. chick em-
bryos in the production of various
kinds of serum.

Mrs. Stevens is president of the
institute and her husband is. treas-
urer. The advisory committee in-
cludes Dr. Robert. Gesell; Dr. Lee
R. Dice, director,”Institute of ‘Hu-
man Biology, University of Michi-
gan; and Dr. Eric H. Hansen, pres-
ident, Massachusetts Society for
the "Prevention of Cruelty tdAni-
mals. ,

New developments in the con-
troversy between experimental 'sci-
entists and anti - vivisectionists
spurred Mrs. Stevens to found the
institute. Some scientists proposed
that animals from pounds and ani-
[mal shelters be, released at them
for experimentation and in some
states“, this Was legalized. Humane
societies, 'which often operate the
lgcal pounds or shelters, fought the
1 ea.

 

Contrary to Ethics
‘It iscontrary to the ethical prin-

Humane societies were founded to
release animals for painful experi-
mentatiori‘,f‘-’" says Mrs. Stevens. '
.v-‘L‘In the-f ; few states. and cities

gwaesei‘fmced surrender legislation
“has been passed, some humane

work has come to a standstill. The
burden to- taxpayers for mainte-
nance ofvanimal shelters under mu-
nicipal operation has increased as
much as 7.0,per cent over its for-
mer cost.” ,

Good housing and care of
laboratory animals are among the
institute’s primary concerns. Mrs.
Stevens, who visited a number,
commends the way dogs, cats,
guinea pigs, and mice are housed
in some. . .

“But in some. others,” she, says,
“animals had scarcely enough room
to turn in their cages.» They lay
on wire cage floors without a
board underneath them, they are
not kept- very clean. and they did

not get enough exercise. Some .‘
"showed signs of emotional distress.”
.Mitigation of suffering is another .

aim.

“Attendants in some medical
schools have told me that the same
dog is used nine times for practice,
operations by students who are

studying surgery,” Mrs. Stevens

said.. .
“We do not object to taking ani-
mal life in the interest of science

if the animal does not suffer. But)
it seems very unlikely that suffer-:
ing could be avoided in- a case like“
this. We would rather see a dog,

painlessly destroyed after the first

ple'a great deal of pain. We should

Novelty Hats
Durlng Year

By MILTON AMSEL

NEW YORK, Jan! 17 .—
(WNNS)—-It looks as if it will
be a big year for behatted boys.

Just as everyone gets used to
seeing lads running around
bareheaded,
recent Boys’ Apparel Buyers’
ASSOCiation convention h e r e,
predicted about face With the
1952 crop of boys clamoring for
their toppieces '

And a gaudy lot there are.

5 In addition to the Dan’l Boone
‘ type of Coonskin hats, boys will
be tempted with “Indian hair-
cut” hats, made to imulate the
shaven heads of redskin braves,

in whiCh only a strip of short-

hair remains down the middle
of the skull. A raccoon tail

represents the remaining hair, .

mounted as it is on a skull-
tight, skin-colored cap. From a
distance it really fools you

7WAR APPEAL

Union and Confederate hats
—-—identical in shape but in dif-
ferent colors—~are reckoned to
appeal to yOungsters of all ages.

Wit/1 M0voble Complications

NEW ROCHELLE, N. Y., Jan.~ 17.-,-(WNNS)-—He1en Rooney

has probably cooked more meals aboard ship in her 20 years of‘

married life than she has in her

own kitchen.

Mrs. Rooney, her husband and their three daughters are sailors.
Up until this yeai they had two boats—a 45- foot cabin cruiser and

a seven— foot dinghy With an
outboard motor.

“I guess I like to sailandﬁsh
more than anything,” she? said
“I . would 5, rather
,keep house on a boat..- It’s a lot
less work. Butit is a lot of
cooking. It seems as though all
you do is eat one boatﬂ". 5

She gave sOme tips to Women
‘who suddenly ﬁnd that their
husbands have decided, to be-‘

come vacation sailors. “If your
husband decides to buy a boat
for long cruises, be sure you go
with him and see that there is
a good stove. ”

By a good stove, she means a
.two- burner model 7and one with

guaid rails to keep the pots and‘

pans from ﬂying all over the
kitchen—sorry, galley.

The stove should be securely

7 anchored, to the ﬂoor, and a top ,
7 0f the, stove oven to ﬁt over one

of the burners is a good idea.

“Once it was so rough,” she
recalled, “that the children were
sitting on the ﬂoor of the galley,
and 'I‘ had- to slide the plates of
food to them across the room.
My husband had to search for a
spot between the waves so I
could even do that.”

As water on a boat is limited,
Mrs. Rooney suggests that the.
sailor’s spouse buy a two-quart
thermos jug and ﬁll it with hot
coffee before the trip. It is also
a good idea to wash all fruits

_ and vegetables bef01e the Voyage
~~ and take along a supply of boiled

potatoes.
Use liners in frying pans, and,
keep a lot of little snacks on

handin Water-tight cans for in- 7

between- meal eating All fruit

juices, fruits. vegetables, meats
Inna-(e flame-la n+n\ ‘xrln'Ir-h

.( nau‘nﬁl‘

 

ing chores aboard, precook7
. stews, casserole dishes {and fried
chicken and just warmthem up
for meals. “These things always
taste better the second day,”
she said. ,
Good potholders, rustproof

kitchen equipment and a pres-
sure cooker are almost “musts”
for the sailing cooking '

And children Who mind imme-
diately are also a must. “If a
child doesn’t do what he is told
immediately on board Ship, it

may mean his life, ” she warned. -

To keep y0ungsters busy, she

recommended coloring books,.
sewing, cards, clay and story 55..

books Blocks, beads, building
sets, checkers, chess and other

are not feasible aboard ship.

And Whatever you do, take,

enough to eat. _“I would be
ashamed to eat as much on
shore as I do .rraboard ship, but
5 it seems as though on board

 

 

games with many small pieces.

ship life is just one big meal.”

"ciety, which represents humane
societies throughout the entire
State, has for over 60 years co-
operated with all law-enforcement
agencies in, matters pertaining to
the care and treatment of animals.
“When the amendments are be— '1
fore the Senate. for final passage 5
early this week,” Mrs. Stevens 1‘
kadded, “it is to be hoped that the
debate will be confined to the issue
involved and not to extraneous ar-
iguments, such as medical research-
‘:vs. anti-vivisection, etc. The ques-
‘tion of anti-vivisection is not in-
volved”

Action Delayed "it
On Dog Research

Times-Union’s Owr. Bureau

Action on amendments to the
Hatch-Metcalf dogs-for-rese‘arch law
was deferred last night by the Senate.
At the same time, the Animal Wel-
fare Institutein New York City an-
nounced its~ support for the amend-
ments proposed by Senator MacNeill
Mitchell, New YorkCity Republican.
. .The amendments would require
quarterly instead of annual inspec-i
tions of the medical laboratories con-5
ducting experiments 0 n a n i m a l sf

 

 

secured by the state from pounds. 3
Another Mitchell amendment would;
require the" state health commissioner?
to appoint a representative from the
State Humane Association to assist in
the inspections.’ « ,

Earlier, the ”State Medical Research;
Society filed a protest to the ”amend-g
ments, declaring they delegated police}

 

power to a private individual by re—.
quiring the appointment of a Humane
Society representative as an inspector.

National Society for Medical Research
Governor Dewey signed the
Hatch-Metcalf animal research
bill, making possible the requisi-
tion of doomed dogs and cats for
use in medical research and teach-
ing. ~
As was expected, antivivisec-
tionists fought “the. bill with every
means at their Command. Opposi-
tion was ,alv’vays bitter; -and by
turns vicious, subtle, illogical, and
'eventually,, downright hysterical.
Both Senator Metc'alf and Assem-
blyman Hatch received several
anonymous threats of death. One
threat promised thatthe legislators
would not be killed, but reduced
to “gibbering suffering idiots, ﬁt
only for more. medicalyexperimen-
tation.” ~ : ’

The bin Was. caued I“,unconsti—'

tutional,” "‘socialistic,”3 “an in-
vasion of private'rights” and “sub-
versive”. One witness against the
bill shouted "deﬁance from the
stand, saying, “,Get your own dogs!
You can’t have ours.” .. -

Another typical move by the van-
tivivisectionists was the threat to
close municipal pounds, which
they operate? with. public funds, if
the bill wasepasse‘d. The sentiment
was expressed by humane societies
in Rochester, ”Westchester County
and elsewhere, . that, ’if they
couldn’t dispose ‘of dog-s as they
saw ﬁt, they would not carry out
any humane work. _ I

The Animal Welfare? Institute

had .reiSEESentativ sat hearings on

the bill. This group, Which ap-,
, parently" is for the use of animals

in medical research as: long as no
pound animals are used, .sat with-
opponents of the bill. However,
their position remains hazy in the
current battle. , ‘

THE NATIONAL AN TI-VIVISECTION SOCIETY

37 SOUTH WABASH AVENUE, CHICAGO 3, ILLINOIS

JanaFeb"
I952

Wationa/ Society 3 lee/00M On

77...,

By WARD CAILLE
Vice-President of the National Anti-Vivisection Society . .

Several months ago—as most members of this Society
are aware—a group Was formed in New, York under the
title, Animal Welfare Institute. The institute began its
public existence with the issuance of a prospectus setting
forth its purposes and its scope. ‘

The institute intended, it said

—to promote the welfare of all animals, and
. ——to reduce the total of pain and fear inflicted on
animals by man.

Further. the institute declared that while it is inter-
ested in all animals. it will at present "concern itself

particularly with . . . animals for research and medi-
clne." ‘

Thus, the institute appeared to our board of directors
at first glance as a new organization generally opposed to
vivisection. But at the same time, the institute's prospectus
made it clear that the institute is not opposed to all ani-
mal research and that it hopes to be able to follow what
it calls a "middle course."

* ~ * *

ON TOP OF THIS. the prospectus disclosed that the
institute numbers on its advisory committee three doctors
who might loosely be described as "vivisectors."

This latter data was enough for several anti-vivisec-
tionist groups. They immediately condemned the insti-
tute as meaningless at best or a bald effort purposely
‘ to mislead humanitarians at worst.

On the other hand, dyed-in-the-wool medical research
men were quick to condemn the institute because of its
stated "humane" objectives—while a number of humane
societies decided to support the institute.

The Board of Directors of the National Anti-Vivisection
Society felt that, as the representatives of the largest
group of its kind in the world, they must obtain thorough
and accurate information on the Animal Welfare Institute.

They asked me to check on the institute rather fully in

the course of a trip to New York. The following data are
the result of my investigation.

HISTORY

The Animal Welfare Institute was founded, single-
handedly, by Mrs. Christine Gesell Stevens of Ann Arbor,
Michigan, and New York City.

Mrs. Stevens is the daughter of Dr. Robert Gesell.
professor of physiology at the University of Michigan
and therefore a "vivisector" by deﬁnition.

Mrs. Stevens is the wife of Roger L. Stevens, a New
York real estate operator commonly described in the
New York papers as "wealthy." He is a member of the
syndicate which recently purchased the Empire State
Building.

Mrs. Stevens became interested in humane work during
World War II while her husband was in the Navy and
she found herself living in Miami. Becoming concerned
over some abandoned kittens, she began to work with the
humane society in Miami and, upon her return to Ann
Arbor, she became active in the Humane Society of Wash-
tenaw County, finally becoming a member of its board.
She helped design a new shelter for that society and was
instrumental in raising funds for its equipment.

* * *

MRS. STEVENS declares that toward the end of 1950
she came to realize that "humane societies were fighting
for their very existence because of increasing demands
made upon them by organized medical research.”

She points out that in some areas where researchers
had managed to pass pound seizure bills. humane work
had come to a halt. She notes that. as a result of the
passage of pound seizure Isills. the taxpayers in some
areas had been forced to assume increases ranging up
to 70 percent in the cost of animal shelter operation.

Mrs. Stevens says she came to the opinion that some
sort of control over vivisection should be set. up. She

‘ points out, incidentally, that the British vivisection regu-

lation act of 1876, while possibly not perfect, probably is
the best law of its kind in force anywhere in the world.
This, she says, is an indication merely of her general
thinking and is not an indication that she intends an im-
mediate campaign along any particular legislative line.
At any rate, Mrs. Stevens decided to found the Animal
Welfare Institute in order to give point to her own convic-
tions on humane work. The institute was incorporated,
not for profit, on July 11, 1951. I

ORGANIZATION

For all practical purposes, the Animal Welfare Institute
consists of Mrs. Stevens herself. No other person acts as
its spokesman—not even its public relations counsel—and
no other person directs its activities.

At the some time. Mrs. Stevens has been aided in her

venture by her husband. her father. and several friends. .

Dear Governor Dewey:

Your valuable time is at a premium, I
know, since -~ as a public figure -~ you are
very likely deluged with mail more pressing
than the enclosed. .

This, however, will acquaint you with the
Animal Welfare Institute, a national organiza-
tionswhich was incepted last Fall and Which is
concerned with the improvement of conditions
under Which laboratory animals must live. The
~Institute's program of trying to correct these
elements where the need eXists has made consider-
able progress.

Enclosed is a copy of the Animal Welfare
Institute's prospectus, some quotes from pro-
minent people in scientific and humane work
commending the organization, and the latest
Information Report of the Institute.

Your thoughts on this project will be
appreciated, and we are very grateful for what-
ever time you spend looking it over.

ANIMAL WELFARE ON THE UNITED STATES

WE have been exceptionally fortunate in the way our
; the ant1v1v13eetienists, because it adoes not condemn
animal experf ts, and by the research scientists,
_ Ebecause it doesmot approve their pthy towards animal

legislation for the protection of laboratory animals has
matuied; for it arose directly from the Opinion of the
scientists engaged in experiments requiring the use Of
animals. The British Association for the Advancement
of Science resolved, as early as 1871, that no experiment
which can be done with the animal unde'sian anaesthetic
should be done without it; that no painful experiment
is justiﬁable for the mere purpose of illuStrating a law
or fact already demonstrated (i. e., such experiments
should not be us ed in teaching); and that when, in
order to Obtain a new fact, it is necessary to (Muse pain,
every effort should be made to ensure succ":1_;so that
pain is not inﬂicted uselessly. TheSe Oplnlle which
provided the basis for the relevant Sections in thO Cruelty
to Animals Act of 1876, are now reinforced by a growing
conviction among research -Workers that animals Should
not be used in large numbers for par,

when the facts can be establishedfequ " 3' ’

use Of a few. This reasonable and} , W ,3:

to a difﬁcult matter has put our scientiSts 1'9'a v“, a, Strong
position to meet the arguments of antivwiseetionists
Moreover it has not hampered their "ilk in any. way

indeed they regard the legal requirements as a valuabl

safeguard of their interests.

In the United States the situation has developed along
different lines. Angered by the attacks Of antivnri-I’

sectionists, members of. the NatiO' '

of restrictions on animal expe,
farther and launching an attack

legislation compelling animal welfare Organisations"
hand over, for experiment, stray animals brought to t 1:, .-
animal- pounds for humane care or destruction, .1. and’ii
some States such legislation has already been passed

and is now in force. This has hd the effeOt Of ’

shaking the conﬁdence Of ordinary peO'Q the purpose
and integrity of such organisations, and r giroluntary
bodies have thought it better to close down Tather than
become procurers Of animals for experiment. Such a
Bill is now pending in the New York State Assembly, and

 

, make it a misdemeanoui to haibour a stray
anmial WithOut reporting to a designated authority Within
24 hours.

In an attempt to Offer a more temperate and con-
structive programme, a group Of interested peOple——-
including Dr. Lee R. Dice, director of the institute of
human biology, and Dr. Robert Gesell, professor of
physiology, in the University of Michigan—have formed
a new Animal Welfare Institute (A.W-.I.) to promote
the welfare of all animals and to reducathe total of fear
and pain inﬂicted 011 animals by many? as, Like our own

comfort, or loneliness. They .. anxipus to wOrk, as
UFAW does, in coOperation with research-workers, but
they have been hampered at the outset by a demand
of the New York State Society ipr '
that they should “ unreservedly back ” an animal-pound
Bill of the type described. ThisaOf course, the A. W. I. -
are not able to do, for while it is 011e,;thing to accept“
that stray animals brought to a public pound may
reasonably be used for research, it is quite another to ﬂ
agree that a welfare society, formed to Satisfy a different .
purpose, a111,; supported for that end by voluntary subscrip-
tions, she ,, be diverted to uses which its sponsors

Hatch-Metcalf Bill Signed By

ey—Becomes

Governor Dew

the Hatch- Metcalf animal research
making possible the requisition of doo‘”
dogs and cats for use in medical research
and teaching.

In his signatory message, the Governor
declared the measure had been “widely mis-
understood.” He noted that the bill affected
“only unlicensed, unwanted or unclaimed

animals which have been seized and im-.

pounded and would normally be destroyed.”

“Without this legislation,” Governor
Dewey declared, “medical work of vital im-

portance to the well- being of our people;
would be seriously impeded. The ﬁght

against cancer, knowledge of atomic radi-
ation effects and many aspects of the strug-
gle against disease and sickness were being
strangled. They 'can now proceed.”

The Governor signed the bill in a special

ceremony in his ofﬁce, in the presence of

the two sponsors, Senator George R. Met
calf and Assemblyman A. Gould Hatch. A
week before the bill had been passed, 103
to 40 by the Assembly, Dewey had said he

favored passage of the bill. SIX days af. ‘r‘

the Assembly vote, the Senate VOted to pas
the measure, 34 to 18.

As was eXl"~ cted antiviVisectionists
fought the bill girth every means at their
command. Opposition was always bitter;
and by turns vicious, subtle, illogical, and
eventually, downright hysterlcal Both Sen-

ator Metcalf and Assemblyman Hatch re-gsg
ceived several anonymous threats Of death.

One threat promised that‘l‘the legislators
would not be killed, but reduced to “gibber—
ing, suffering idiots, ﬁt only for more medi-
cal experimentation.” L

The bill was called “unconstitutional,”
“socialistic,” “an invasion of private rights”
and “subversive.” One witness against the
bill shouted deﬁance from the stand, saying
“Get your own dogs! You can’t have ours.”

March-April. 1952

Another typical move by the antivivi-

sectionists was the threat to close municipal

pounds, which they operate with public
funds, if the bill was passed. The sentiment
was expressed by humane societies in
Rochester, Westchester County and else—
where, that, if they couldn’t dispose of dogs

as they saw ﬁt, they would not carry out
”any humane work. In connection with this

. This group, which apparently
is for the use of animals 1n medical research
as“ long as no pound animals are used, sat
with opponents of the bill. However, their
position remains hazy 1n the current battle.

The most dangerous aftermath of the

h would provide for quarterly inspec-
3 p of research laboratories by representa-
' es of the New York State Humane So—

c1ety, chief opponents of the Hatch-Met—

calf Bill. In effect, this bill would have
given police powers to the group most
violently opposed to animal experimenta—
tion; a group which has proved itself to be
not only antivivisectionist, but also anti-

Seats Facing Tail Advised for
Greater Airliner Safety

Dr. John F. Fulton, Yale School of Medicine says that
airplanes should have stronger safety belts and that
passenger seats should face the tail end of the plane to
lessen the possibility of injury.

Laboratory experiments have proved the value of
these improvements. Held by a stronger belt, the pas-
senger is less likely to strike his head on the seat in
front of him or be thrown about within the plane. If the
seat faces the rear he will not be thrown forward in a
crash landing.

Dr. Fulton cited the case of a heavy bomber crashing'

into a hillside.» It was not uncommon to ﬁnd that although
everyone in the plane was killed instantly, the rear gun-
ner was not. The reasons he was not killed Dr. Fulton

explained, were (1) because his head and body were sup-sq
ported by solid structure at the time of the impact an?

(2) because the gunner was riding backwards.
Dr Fulton suggested that airliner seats be anchore

to the fuselage so they could resist up to four times the

strain they are now subjected to an’d'that padding be placed
at the back of the seats to protect the passenger who may
be thrown violently forward against a front seat in a crash.

 
   
 

Animal Welfare Institute Established

The bitter controversy between antl—VIVISectIOIIlS‘ES»,

research scientists, and the urgent need for greater Apr?»

tection of laboratory animals, were chleﬂy. respons1ble
for the recent establishment of the Animal ”Welfare In-
stitute, a nation-wide organization with headquarters in
New York City.

Recognizing the need for bridging the wide gap now
existing between the two groups, with regard to the use
of animals for experimentation, Christine Stevens, Ann
Arbor, Mich, ﬁrst made a comprehensive study of the
subject, and then organized the Institute to “establish
some middle ground on which sincere humanitarians might
meet and work for the welfare of both men and animals.”

The stated aim of the institute is: “To promote the
welfare of all animals. To reduce the total of pain and
fear inﬂicted on animals by man.”

8 Rules for Survival in a Disaster

Eight rules followed in time of disaster may save an
individual’s life, according to Dr. Walter H. Roehll, Mid-
dletown, 0. Dr. Roehll was the only physician aboard the
streamliner, “City of San Francisco,” when it became snow-
bound in the Sierra Nevada mountains last January.

“In any disaster——potential or real—the key work is
conservation; conservation of energy, of food, of water,
of worry and of all physical, mental and spiritual stock,”
said Dr. Roehll. .

The rules, which appear in a story in the April issue
of Today’s Health (published by the A.M.A.) are:

1. Keep calm and conserve your energy.

2. Though you may feel the world has abandoned you,
actually you can be certain that every effort is being made
to effect your rescue.

Dental Diet to Prevent Decay Seen in Future

Two Harvard University dental professors believe that
because teeth never reach a point of maturity, your dentist
may some day be able to place you on a diet that will build

Drs. Reidar F. Sognnaes and James H. Shaw of Boston,
‘ "e conducted experiments to prove that food, saliva and

Drs. Sognnaes and Shaw seek to establish the use of
radioactive phosphorus as a method of measuring changes
in tooth structure. They believe their study is the ﬁrst
step in allowing dentists to determine what factors cause
tooth decay and why some teeth are resistant to decay.
In the future, they believe, there may be developed a
dental dietary 'care that will be designed to prevent decay.

They received the $500 award for their study at the
Chicago Dental Society’s meeting in Chicago.

Color TV Used in Kansas Medical School

The ﬁrst regular schedule of color-TV demonstrations for
undergraduate and graduate medical students is underway
at the University of Kansas Medical Center. It marks the
biggest advance in technics of medical education in many
years. '
The medical school has used black and white TV for
two years, but the switch to color makes it easier for
students to tell a nerve from a tendon.
The TV camera’s lens turret is mounted in the overhead
light, directly above the table. To cut reﬂected glare some
of the instruments have been given a dull, gun-metal
ﬁnish.
The surgeon wears a throat microphone in order to ex-
plain every cut and stitch. Another professor listens in
with students; if something is unclear he can use half of
his two-way circuit to ask the operating surgeon to spell
it out. On another circuit unheard by students, a senior
surgeon can give advice to the operating surgeon.
The setup will cost at least $8,000 a year to operate,
but head surgeon Paul W. Schafer says they think it’s
worth ten times that much.
