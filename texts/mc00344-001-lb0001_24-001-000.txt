though she had obtained through someone else some of the
recent leaflets with the sheep slaughter pix and had sent
them out to a number of peoyle. I gave her your name and

. «as. She may be in touch with you. If not, I suggest

u put her on your list. She is a reel worker andmis doing

she can for the humane slaughter bill, but isﬂespecially

upwtoudaté on ﬁongressional inner workings. I got her in
touch with Fred Myers. She phoned me the other night on
suggestion of a mutual friend. I have not met her in person.
Her husband is with the Orgamﬁﬂv. f DuPont. I hope you
two can get together.

I suppose you have heard of werner Von Baaun‘s recent
remark that a monkey will be sent aloft in the next Jupiter 0
launched satellite, scheduled for “pril. ”Could not a request
be made that such space arunels be put to death by some pre~

Dear Estella Draper:

I would like a copy of "The Status of
Animals in the Christian Religion. Check
attached.

Thanks for calling my attention (through
your Info. Report) to Kearney’s piece in the
"Coronet." I wrote "Coronet a congratulatory note.

I hope to write more humane slaughter and
other humane stories in the coming months. Not
long ago, I wrote one for my syndicate -- North
American Newspaper Alliance -- on the fact that
Mrs. Eisenﬁhower had been begged for months by
the Defenders of Fur bearers not to accept the
beaver coat. I mentioned, of course, in the story 5
the humane trapping bill.

1‘he dog in Sputnik should Show editors
that there is a tremendous interest in animals in a
this country. Did AWI issue any protests or
take part in thds=-— and, more important, what
are you doing in re: animals to be used in our
rockets etc? I am writing, just for the record,
notes to a few key people asking that if animals
are used, please to provide a merciful death for
them at the end.of their experimental usefulnessﬁv
such as a powerful poison in the last meal or an
electric shock.

Would love to hear from you on some of
the se ti“- ings .

Yours,

sf

Dear Christine:

Please send me soonesta a copy of your new booklet on
use of animals in experiments in the schools -~ with introduction
by Rachel Carson. Shirley Briggs happened to mention it to
me.

Now that the school sessions are starting up I would
like to write on this general subject. The Carson introduction
was a brilliant idea.

I talked to Leo Miller yesterday. He says that the
H.E.W. people ( as differentiated free the F.D.A. people)
would prefer to put in for the full amount on the regular
appropriation for next year, rather than on the supplementd.
anpropriation request made soon after the new Congress
convenes. This would delay construction by five months or
so. Ridiculous. I am inclined to belie“e on good assurance

.___—__
that Senator Hill is thinking in terms of the supplemental
to get this thing moving.

Also we must Show a united front in% pushing for the
most humane and largest ( yet holding it down pricewise)
inside, on side pens, two dogs to a pen, lowest barriers
between dogs etc. I would like to discuss this with you.

Do you think a on stionnaire to the groans that have worked
with this night he the best way to handle it rather than
trying to get a group together? Or do you think aniﬁx of

some other way? Let me know your thoughts.

Dear Bhristine:

I am glad that the Kefauver-Richards mix-up
was cleared up. Lee White probably told you I checked with
himy yesterday. He called today with the full info.

The H.E.W. appropriations bill is at the White
House and may be signed at any time ( if not already tate this
afternoon.)

The F.D.A. planning money was trihned to
$100,000 was which is certainly sufficient. I have been
pushing for F.D.A. to get some interim quarters -- if such
could he found by G.S.A. without too much cost for renovation
etc -- pending completion of the special facility. Even
if a successful supplemental approprihticn request is made
early in the next Congress, it will be nearly 18 months befona
those miserable dogs get out of their cages.

F.D.A. asked Secretary Flemming's office in
early July ( I have been told) to ask G.S.A. for such interim
space. But to date ﬁxix Flemming‘s office has not moved
on this. Perhaps if you care to, you might drop a note to
Flemming asking that at least the H.E.W. forward such a recuest
to G.S.A. -— just to see if something could be found.

When I wrote Senator Hill yesterday thanking
him for his splendid efforts in getting the planning money
for the F.D.A. dogs through the Congress, I mentioned the
interim space problem again. Also I have called Flemming's
attention to it through Jack Tait, the chief Public Affairs better.
officer for H-E-W- The more backstopping from humane groups, the

I think that F.D.A. will consult with some
of us on the plans for the new facility. I would like to
discuss this with you either in person or in another letter
later. is We do want to be sure that the largest pens are
provided, as well as other humane and comfortable aspects.

I know you have been extremely busy with
Kittybel’s wedding and all thategoes with the preparations etc.
Jim and I were Very happy to receive the announcement and hang
wish them great joy in the years ahead.

These are a few hurried lines as the mail collection
is upon me. I have been very busy, too. Have had guests, part
of the inside of the house painted etc, gotten Elissa through
a slight accident of a cut chin ( six stitches) a short siege
of a and virus etc. etc.

Yours,

Dear Stell:

Wonderful of you all to get off the letters to the
constituents of the House HEVrFDA subcommittee members.

I talked to Ben. Fogarty yesterday. He's very much
in our corner. The conferees have just been anpointei

for the House side.

They are Cannon (ch. of full App. Co n) Taber ( ranking GOP)
Fogarty, Laird and Benton.

We have to win three out of those five votes. I don‘t
count on support from Taber. Danton, being a Dem. will
probably be for it and go along with Fogarty. Lairdxi
or Cannon can swing it our way.

So as you can see it can hang on a thread. Cannon is

usually against items thet sudienly pop up gseqsso we have

to keep our fingers crossed about him.
a 3
Mg,

And as for Laird of Wisconsin, it is hard to tell ——that is,
he amn't tellingk

  

I noted from your note that you didn't have the name of
Danton down. Maybe that was my oversight when I gave
LJhriustine the list.

Winfiékd K. Denton, Democrat of the 8th District of
Indiana. He lives in Evansville. I note that he has _
a daughter, Mrs. Dabid Ong of Ann Arbor, Nich,;ﬂuf f/aagnva:

Some of the towns besides Evansville i elude New
Albany, Tell City Boonville, Jasper. The Cong. Directory
has his countiee listed of course, in case you need to

“=search hard for a constitutent from this area!

I think the “onference will be held Tuesday, June 28.

No, there is no chance that the amonnt will be upped in
conference or on the floor. But if we can get this planning
money, FDA can come back in January for a supplemental approp.
and maybe get the rest. Apparently the Senate subcomrittee felt
the FDA estimate too high for the entire btdg. and were afraid
to risk losing all by pushing for that amount.

the Armyucould contract for meat on July 2 and it onldn't

the packers actually until expiration of contract to tool
up. But Army says that it contracts for enly about a two
week or months period in advance.

Poage apparently was for it -- legitimate reason for
extension.

I hate to see t‘is thing get off to this kind of
start, but aprarently its in the works now. Dept.
of Ag. didn' t even k ow it ma s brewing. Neither did
the American Meat Institute.

Dear Christine:

Sorry to have missed you yesterday. Thanks for sending
copy of excellent letter you sent to key neonle in the
Anprop. Comm. states. It should produce thd.erful response
which will focus attention at the exact psychological momren

 

The full committee meets on the HEW hil_l, I have ju9t
heard, at P P .N. Tuesday, June 14.

If we get through this all right, do you suppose all the
Sena tors on the Floor will know enough about it to come along
with it?

I think that Sen. Stennis is favorable and Nargaret
Chase Smith.

Helen Jones, Mrs. West, HS? S also got in touch With
lots of neonle and I he ve been talking to Virginians for hillis
Robertson.

Leo Miller called the other day. he was worried because
of the blackout on news. '

The letter to the Ed. in Post this morning will be
of interest.

Mrs. West has written Hogben a snappy answer and sending
a c0py to the Post.

Hogben may be right on the Edward Jenner. He was
the discoverer of vaccination nrocess etc. and lived lﬁiixk
1794 -1823. Sir illiam Jenner, a natheloa19t, lived 1815-1898 --
was a contemporary of Darwin et al. You have Edward Jenner
in your printed folder.

You can see how closely "they" are looking for flaws.

I will get in touch with you the roment anything is
released after the Approp. Comm. Tuesday.

 

Wonderful of you to rush out those letters on the
FDA dogs.

Hurriedly,

Dear Stell:

Since Christine is going on to Ann Arbor, I am writing
this to you as you may be in touch with her before I see
her here this Thursday or Friday.

We talked about so many other things Saturday night that
I failed to remind her about being sure to notify Hill or ’
Herman Downey of the Senate Approp. Comm. that she n§§§§%
wants to appear on the subject of the FDA beagles or has a
statement. fa" AW» 0’ fu’ My.)

Also I hope that she includes in her statement the
recommendation that the runs be 4 by 6 inside and 4 by 12
outside. If there is strong urging in the testimony of
those speaking in behalf of the dogs, there is a better chance
that Senrtor Hill's subcommittee in its report on the FDA
facility will recommend thatgthe runs be enlarged over the
current specifications included by F.D.A. I am fairly certain
that larger pens than 3 by 6gﬂand 3 by 10 out, can be done
within the framework of the money FDA is asking for.

sea—e n
I had mentioned to her that I was going to as. ha 'tﬁ§wm’

committee report take this View, but obviously some ﬁﬂii'reference

to larger space should be found in the testimony// of those

most concerned about the welfare of the dogs.

Thanks very much.

Yours,

P.S. I would apnrecsiage
having a ew extra
the last Info. Report.

As March marks the end of our fisca1.year, it is a good time to evaluate the
progress of this Society and of the humane movement. -Dai1y contacts with
cruelty frequently make it appear that man's inhumanity to animals is on the
increase, and that past efforts to reduce cruelty have been pretty much in
vain. The Humane Creed adapted by'your'Society'reads: "WE BELIEVE: That the
goal of the Society, stated in itS‘simplest terms, is to work toward halting
and preventing all UNNECESSARY SUFFERING of animals in every way possible,
and to work toward and encourage the discovery of ways and means or renderu
ing cruelty now considered necessary, UNNECESSARY."

'WHAT‘CAN HUMANE SOCIETIES DO TO ATTAIN THIS GOAL? PREVENTIEE_measures
follow several routes such asIDISCOVERY of where cruelty exists through
inspections and investigations; CORRECTION of immediate cruelties through
instruction and if necessary, prosecution; TRAINING~in.Kindness to Animals
to reduce inhumanities in the future; LEGISLATION to’supplement training.
ALLEVIATION of suffering: The provision of a SHELTER to care for the many
animals whose distress is a byeproduct of cruelty, ignorance or unfortunate
circumstances.

 

Let's look backward and see if our Society has contributed to the attain-
ment of these goals.

.Available records go back to 1903 although the Society was founded in 1889.
It was called the SPCA. Records show that draft and farm animals were the
chief concern of that early group. Richard.Daniel, whose father, Col. J. J.
Daniel founded the Society, states that when he was a small boy, he saw a
dead mule lying between the car tracks on Monroe St. It was a common eight,
he relates, to see horses and mules whipped and goaded by unmerciful drivers.
Reports show that horses, mules and cows were "humanely put to sleep" after
being brutally treated by their owners or drivers. Prosecutions averaged
one a week. .A few years later, the president reported that prosecutions
were reduced to only 35 that year. -

InSpections were made, but they were mainly of excavations, railroad sidings
and places where draft animals were used.

Gradually the picture changed. Horses gave way to machinery. Today investi~
gations include places where small animals are kept as well as large animals -
not only circuses, rodeos, slaughter houses, auction stables, but kennels,

pet shops, roadside zoos, pounds, etc. etc.

Besides the routine inspections, where corrections can usually be made by
conferences with the proprietors, with the backing of the law, Humane Officers
follow up on the many complaints of neglect and cruelty turned in by the
public. 'While some concern large animals, such as riding horses with sores,
overcrowded cattle trucks etc., the majority concern pet animals. They may
be temporarily or permanently abandoned, tied with wire or heavy rope or

too short chains; they may be puppies or kittens being roughly handled by
children or adults.or any of the things thoughtless or ignorant peeple are
apt to do.

The infrequent cases of downright intentional brutality or neglect are taken
to court. There jail sentences and fines have been meted out to several
people.

Prosecutions are avoided in favor of instruction and have dwindled to not
more than 10 or twelve a year.

The minutes of past meetings show a continuous effort to discover causes of
cruelty and to do something about it. During Mrs. Henry Richmond's terms of
service the minutes give considerable detail and show that at practically

revery meeting, action was taken to improve either a local or a distance
situation. The Society successfully protested a planned bull-fight in m _
Jacksonville. This action was repeated in l9h8 with equal subcess. 'Theﬁ.
Society protested effectively the mutilation and use of cats for training
racing dogs, in BroWard County.’ Similar action was taken more recently re the
use of rabbits for such training. Several members of the Board apparently did
an enormous amount of work although Mr. Bowden plaintively wrote to Mrs.
Richmond "You know how it is when a faithful few attend to all."

Within the memory of more recent workers is the action to provide a veterinarian
to euthanize dogs at the City Pound. The layman's methods were not approved at
all. The Society also waged a ten year battle to get the miserable city pound
abandoned and a new one built. The new Pound was-opened last year. The Board
established policy to reduce the great cruelties caused by the enormous number
of births of unwanted.dogs and cats, by making SPAYING of female animals an
adoption requirement. -The Society conducted a campaign over a long period of
years to eliminate the cruelties connected with the use of baby animals and fowl
at.Easter time. .A city ordinance and the cooperation of merchants in the county

. have almost stopped this cruel traffic._ Steps have been.taken to offset the
pressures on teachers to use live animals for painful experiments in lower
schools. With local and State.school administrators supporting this policy and
pointing out the bad psychological effects on children, the experimental work
has been directed to humane observation and the use of simpler form of life.

Ever since the Society was organized, the importance of training in attitudes of
kindness and appreciation of animals has been recognized. In 1903, the president
stated that “the Society should embrace the opportunity to impress on the minds
of the boys (the Boy’s Club) lessons in kindness. It would doubtless prevent a
great deal of cruelty ithhe future." Max Myerson, when president (l908el920)
gave much time to the he Bands of Mercy he organized in the schools.

The following years have seen much time and energy spent by volunteers on the

' Training-ineKindness program. Mrs. Irene Kirbo’s work is recorded over several
years. She organized Junior Humane Clubs, ran contests and used her imagination
and enthusiasm to stimulate interest, appreciation and proper care of animals.
Mrs. Sue Hall also gays much time and thought to the program. Your Editor was
Education Chairman for Several years and devoted as much time as possible to
the work. There has always been one great fault with the program. It lacked
continuity and was_1imited to the time volunteers could give to it.

The American Humane Association has been urging Societies to get down to business
with educational programs to counteract the cruelties that cQuld not be cured
with alleviation. PreventiOn must be increased. The increasing population
brings increasing animals, but at a much greater rate than people. This Society
recognized the importance of this type of prevention.and four years ago decided
it would be necessary to employ a qualified person to give full time to the
educational program. “ ' . u". I 7 '""

Last year after much searching, an unusually well qualified local person was
found. She is a Florida State College graduate with a major in Biology, has
been a teacher in the lecal schools and is experienced in summer camps where
her dedication to the ideal, appreciation of all animals and her influence on
young people was ably demonstrated. This plus her experience as YJTeen Director
for the YWCA with its organization and supervisory responsibilities made Marque
.Zoe Rentz a "natural" for the job of Education Director.

The program started in the Fall of 1958, with the active cooperation of local
schOOl administrators, and-with Dean Helen Merrill of Jacksonville University as
Board Chairman of the Education Committee and Mrs. Margaret NbGill, Supervisor of

Elementary Curriculum as adviser. To date approximately 10,000 children in

300 classroom groups have talked about and watched animal care with Miss Rentz.
This does not-include pet show groups or talks with people at the Fair etc.
Teachers remark on the continuing interest in amimals stimulated by the sessions.
Parents tell how their children are teaching them to take care of the family pets
Children write Miss Rents. Sample excerpts: ”I.told my mother she trained Susie .
the wrong way, that she should not have hit Susie so much and that compared to
what you talked about we had not trained Susie hardly at all."%%;Another small
boy wrote that he "saw a small bqy pulling his dog.by the ears, because the dog
d1d_not come willingly he hit him." So he demonstrated to the little boy how to

be patient and the dog would come to him .A

Education of.Adults: Our regular sessions for the Police Recruits started
in l95h and are now an integral part of their training program. They are
led by the Humane Officer and have proved very effective. No longer do we
hear of police shooting injured animals. In emergencies, small animals are
taken to the nearest vetrinarian in harmony with a cooperative arrangement
between.om1'Society and their‘Association. This privilege is available to
other Good Samaritans.

Informative talks have been given all through the years to Civic groups, by
Society officers and staff members when qualified, to inform people of the
functions of the Society and to ask cooperation for humane endeavors.

That all this local and widespread effort pays is evidenced by the improved
attitudes toward animals, the many people taking action when they see cruel-
ties, and is especially apparent when comparing cities with and without
Humane Societies. .

LEGISLATION: The legislation that‘gave humane work official status was the
State law, passed in 1901 which-allowed Societies for the prevention of
cruelty to children and animals to appoint agents who could arrest without
warrant. A case brought to court in 1903 was an "inhuman father who beat
his 12 year old child with a slat with nails in it." The offender was
jailed. ‘

The old minutes record much legislative activity by the Board, resulting in
a better than average code of anti-cruelty laws which are in daily use by
all Florida Societies. Not all desirable bills passed. In 1906 the Society
urged the passage of a law "to prohibit the shooting of tame pigeons released
from traps." The bill did not pass. A bill to control the use of firearms
by juveniles passed in 1951. They supported actively the national Humane
Slaughter'Bill and will no doubt work for the passage of a supplemental State

bill in 1961.

The various bills which.your'Socieuy has promoted or supported are too numer-
one to mention. Since 1955, they have been publicized in the News Letter.

-ALLEVIATION OF DISTRESS:

In spite-of all the preventive efforts, there is still cruelty and distress.
, That is where the Shelter.oomes in. To care for the innocent victims.

Originally the Society rented land for the comfort of large animals. Then
Mr. R. F. Bowden made his farm available and when he died, willed it to the
Humane Society "for as long as it is used for humane purposes." Small
animals created few problems. Then corrals were needed. 'With.the years,
the needs are reversed. The terrific increase in the number of dogs and
'cats_being born has necessitated continually increasing accommodations for
them. As they reproduce twenty times the rate of human beings, pie in
arithmetic shows they cannot be.absorbed into homes as pets. Some people
unwilling to fact facts, urge that the animals which are not adOpted be
turned loose to fend for themselves! Others urge the Society to give them
to anyone who will take them! Humanitarians who have struggled with this
problem for years know that unwanted animals on the loose suffer terribly
as do pets given to people who are not truly appreciative of animals. Until
the public stops this senseless overbreeding, Euthanasia, meaning painless
.death, prevents future suffering for these unfortunate "surplus" animals.

A glance at comparative figures tells a discouraging story. In l9h0 about
»6000 animals were cared for. In 1950 this figure was 7000. In 1959 ~ 12,500.
The population of the county increased about h3% in the years between l9h0
‘and 1950, and the Shelter load increased 16%. Between 1950 and 1959 the
cOuntypopulation increased h6% and the Shelter load increased 71%i This
terrific pressure is felt by all Humane Societies which were established to
prevent the cruelties and neglect that bring many of the animals to the
Shelter.

The Preventive program in l958~1959 (including one half year education
and all legislative expense was $ 3,000.00

THE ALLEVIATION expense covering the Shelter and the Humane.Agent was $26,000.00

The conservative budget for 1960~l961 is set at $35,000.00
Our fixed income is 9,000.00

STORMY'WEATHER:

Your‘Ssmioty-has just gone through some very stormy weather due to the separation
from the Organization of the recent Shelter-Managers.

In looking over the records, it was found that these storms occur periodically.
In fact, within the last ten years there have been other periods of bad weather.
Commit tees who were responsible for the operation of the Shelter felt that the
best interests of the animals would be served, by a change in managers. In each
case, some Board members and a number of citizens, who did not have this reapon~
sibility and were not cognizant of the details, questioned the action.

In each case emotions ran high and the records shOW'that the program had a hard
time finding its way through all the thunderheads. In one case, the petitions and
letters circulated created so much confusion that everyone on the Board resigned
and the Society's program was set back for many months.

Tribulation may be good for the humane soul, but it surely only serves to set
back the program of a welfare organization and obstructs the services which try
to attain the goal set forth in the Society‘s Creed. Pray that the new year
may bring harmony and progress toward this goal»

The Board, at a special meeting March 29th appointed.Dr. Edwin Safer as Acting
Managing Director. LDr. Safer will direct the operations of the Society tempo“
rarily and employ such staff as is authorized by the Board.

At the same meeting the Board voted Miss Zoe Rents, its grateful appreciation for
her dedicated services at the Shelter in the interim, which services allowed the
continued operation of the Shelter on a high level of efficiency;

The conscientious services of the Sparkmans, our caretakers who worked far beyond
the call of duty was also commended.

EASTER TOYS:

BE HUMANE; Apply the Humane Creed to your Easter shopping for the children. Protect
:your little ones from getting a lack of REVERENCE FOR LIFE. Commend the merchants
who without force of law (out of the County) comply with the spirit of the City
Ordinance which prohibits these promotions of baby animals which get such rough
treatment from innocent baby hands.

their young relatives and friends to inanimate toys.

Public buildings over $100,000 have to be authorized by
the Publichmildings subcommittees and the Public Works
60mmittees of both Houses. Then the money has to be obtained
from the Independent Office subcommittees and Apprprriaﬁons '

Committees.

Also, G.S.A. enters the picture this way, acting as "agent"
in effect for the tenant. G.S.A. would have to carry the
ball at the hearings.

If this kennel could qualify as a "special pnppx purpose"
building -— i.e. not fit the definitions under the public
buildings law -- it might become a part of the HEW*FDA

appropriation.

The new public buildings law, (Gghich Jones is the father)

was designed to keep snxgxx so many buildings from being
tacked on to departmental appropriations bills. But since

xii
this is not rsally a building in the use: usual sense, I
should think the chance of relinquishment to the Appropriations

subcommitteess for HEW*FDA would be good.

But all of this is something that FDA wilJ.tave to work out
with these committees,Iﬁgqgﬁﬁggagnd«.etc.

It would indeed seem simpler ( less committees to have to

go through) if Hill gould include it in the FDA appropriation

and get Fogarty in conference to go a1

one with it. ’370/

 




Senator Hill would have to ask Larrick in hearings if he wouldn't
like to have such a building. In that way, Larrick wouldn't

be in the position of going counter to what the Bu of Budget
has already approved.

But who knows, Hones and Chavez may come up with a neatzm
way of handling it through their committees. ﬁnn In a few

Dear Christine:

Fleming and Larrick are sending out letters almost
exactly alike. The attached one to Congressman O'Hara
is typical. Dated March 3.

March 16

Fleming wrote Sen. Moss of Usahjthe almost identical
letter except for two paragraphs. I was much amused by
the one I shall quote first. He traps himself by recognizing
the fineness of the Beltsville facilities.

"In order to provide dogs for these tests, we maintain
a breeding colony at the Agricultural ResearchCenter at
Beltsville, Md. The dogs that are kept there are provided
with suitable and adequate space, and so far as I know no
questions have been raised as to the suitableness of those
quarters."

Also in the E;ss letter, there is the condluding
paragraph not found in the O'Hara letter.

"Our plans for the new building did notprévide for
either indoor or dutdoor runs for the dogs. The plans axnx as
drafted contemplated the use of cages which is in accord
with recognized scientific procedures. However, in view
of the widespread interest and objections voiced, our scientists
are thoroughly restudying the matter to determine what revision
in plans may be feasible to satisfy the criticismsﬁaut at the
same time maintain the necessary validity and scientific
soudness of our eXperiments. This poses a very difficult
problem to which we are giving intensive consideretbon. "

Note the sentence about the recognized scientific
procedures. Shall we ask them to produce the evidence?

FDA*HEW is brainwashing the members of Congresson this
phony scientific line. It will be therefore more and more
difficult to get Gongress to persuade FDA to provide better
quarters. FDA then am can say to us "Congress wouldn't give
us the quarters and of course we didn'd dare ask."

I Would like to talk to you at the earliest on this and
one or two other angles which I consider quite impartant.

Yours,

lFDA Defends
taping of Dogs

Objections Raised
On 100 Test Beagles

By ANN COTTRELL FREE

WASHINGTON, (NA N A) --
Amerrca’s- most popular dog-
the beagle —- has entered the
food additive controversy.

Congress is being ,asked to
settle a running debate between
theAFood and Drug Administra-
tion and humanitafians over
the lifetime caging of FDA’s
test beagles.

They are used for testing the
effect of colors and other ad-

of other animals—such as ro-
dents and rabbits—are also used
for testing foods, drugs and
cosmetics.

Humane leaders maintain that
keeping more than 100 beagles
in small cages in a sub-basement
year after year is not only 'in-
humane but can detract from
the accuracy of the tests. ‘

FDA Commissioner George
P. Larrick claims there are “dif-
ferences of opinion” among an-
imal care experts on the sub-
Ject, and that the space-short
FDA prefers the view that con-
stant caging is more desirable.

Still holding to their view,
the humanitarians are asking
Congress to give FDA more

that the agency use it. .

They ask, in particular, that
Congress either change the lo-
cation or change the building
plans for FDA’s proposed $25,-
000,000 midtown building. It
contains no plans for exercise
pens for dogs. ’

a good one,” says Mrs. Christine
Stevens of the Animal Welfare
Institute.

“Most other federal agencies
using animals,” she says, “are
in outlying areas.”

(Mrs. Stevens is the wife of
Roger Stevens, treasurer of the
Democratic National Committee
Campaign Fund, real estate
dealer and theatrical producer.)

She and other veterans of}
such successful battles as the
“humane slaughter”. and “Wild
horse” bills may testify before
the public buildings subcom-
mittees of both houses when the
FDA building comes up‘for ap-
proval.

“FDA must not make a mock-
ery of the Senate Appropria-
tions Committee’s recent policy
statement that comfortable
quarters for research animals
is a ‘proper expense,’ ” says
Fred Myers of the Humane So-
ciety of the United States.

The chairman of the capital’s
only free animal clinic, Mrs.
Frank A. West, maintains that
“stress from caging can cause
physical ills that detract from
the accuracy of tests.”

BY ANN COTTRELL FREE
News Washington bureau

WASHINGTON, Feb. 19 —— The
plight of 100 hound dogs in the
heart of the nation’s capital is
developing into _a first-class furor.
And two Alabama members of
Congress may have a major hand
in settling it. They are Sen. Lister

Scottsboro.

THE BEAGLES—America’s
most popular dog—are used for
testing the effect of colors and
other additives to foodstuffs.
Humanitarians protest to FDA
and Congress that eaging year

animals is not only inhumane, but
also can detract from the ac-
curacy of the tests.

Larrick adds that even if FDA

still be caged. No provisions are

He heads the. House public build-

propriations. A similar Senate
subcommittee must do likewise.

Veterans of successful battles
at humane slaughter and wild

FDA that medical and vet-
erinary societies recognize that
animals are healthier if they
exercise regularly.

None of the dozen of large hu-
mane groups in there pitching for
the beagles is an anti-vivisection—

Though FDA has not given an
inch to the beagles or anyone else,
its position will be under‘ in-

The battle is joined with

is an antivivisectionist society.)

PRESS égLLERY

May 26, 1950

Dear Christine:

Here are the excellent British letters at last. Since
you had sent them registered, I wanted to return them the
same way and I have delayed getting to the Post Office. VThanks
so much for letting me see them.

I have a few items of interest to report in regard to
the FDA "beagle" situation. I had the opportunity to speak
with Rep. Fogarty ( as perhaps you have, too) and he seems
Very kindly disposed toward helping to get the facility.

I don‘t imagine the H.E.W. approprM tions bill —-embodying
the FDA extra appropriation -- will get to him for about

10 days. The Senate subcommittee may meet next week and
then, of course, it has to go through the full committee and
then to the Senate floor before it goes to conference.

Helen Jones ha.s put out a letter to her membership
suggesting that letters he sent to other members of Fogarty' s
subcommittee . Mere than likely those gentlemen are not
up to date, or know anything much, about the FDA beagles1as
most of the letters from humanitarians have been going to
other committees.

Incidently, I went up to Chavez Public Works Commitue
c2ne day recently and took a wuick look at the several th011.sand
let ers that have been sent to him. It was a wonderful
eXperience, reading such good, nicely handled letters. ﬂ1ey
came from just about everywhere.

Last week Senator Hill's subcommittee heard a report
from a special xmmmix group of consultants on medical research.
This group recommended a larger NIH appropriation. Included
in the suggestions for enlarged opeaations were primate centers
and other animal facilities. Hill ~- and also Sen. Monroney —-
stressed "good Care" of laboratory animals when they questioned
the witness on tlis sub1ect, Dr. lichael DeBakey of Baylor
University. When you see the printed hearings —- ready next
week —~ you will see precisely what was said.

I have read with much interest your letter and folder on
the proposed iaboratory animal law and I look forward to talking
to you about it when we next meet.

 




Certainly, the members of Congress are becoming more alert
to this entire subject. For example, when Hill was speaking
the other day on good care etc., Senator Chavez spoke up and
said, in effect, -—Xynnx If you don‘t treat them right, you'll
get into the same kind of trouble as Food and Drug.

We expect to be out of town this coming week, but should
beﬂback by June 6. I hope to be here to listen to the Senate
- H.s.w- appropriation bill debate.

.We'll have to get together soon and discuss some of the
subgectm, which, I am sure, are uppermost in our minds.

Sincerely,

Do you know Rep. Elford A. Cederberg
of Bay City, Michf He's a Republican
member of Fogarty's HEW subcommittee
and may be in on the conference on
the FDA beagle facility.

Forggenerals background, not only for the specific FDA
problem, but for details on FDA's toxicity testing on
animals, I recommend the "Food and Drug Cosmetic Jounnal,
October, 1955." Published by the Commerce Clearing House,
214 N. Michigan Avenue, Chicago. It is a $1.00 a copy.

In this issue, there is a very long article of ”Procedures
for the Appraisal of the Toxicity of Chemicals in Foods,
Drugs and Cosmetics. It is a symposium type of article —-
different sections by different FDA experts ( Dr. Curtis,
not represented!) and there is a fair amount of detail

on dogs. I took some time the other day to check on
bio-assays and pharmacology at the National Medical Library

and discovered this.

I am hopeful that the Senate subcommittee report will suggest
to FDA that the inside and outside pens be larger than FDA

put in its estimates.

Dear Christine:

Do you have a new manual
on school experiments? Billie Twyne
mentioned something along this line. If
so, I'd like very much to see one.

Hill is due here from Ala.
tomorrow. I expect to talk to him soon
thereafter. Apparently, Larrick and Day
have not seen fit to reply to his inquiry,
though I can't imagine they would be so
foolish.

wow that Congress is back,
probably Billie 3 letter should go out
to key people. The covering letter duel
pointing out that Dr.Day had not acknowled
ged it. It was dated December 8. Hill
may need support from all Quarters, but
on that we will know in a day or so.

Are you writing to Mr.
Baack (Chock Full 0( Nuts) who is giving
Columbiaathat big Med. Research ( $5 mil)
bdlg. Since he is going to take such
an active interest in the construction
etc, it shouldb be pointed out to him that
dog, cat, monkey etc, runs should be
included. '

I will write him being a
an old grad. myself ( Barnard '38) How
about getting Madeline, too, and anyother
Columbia people?

Dear Christine:

Your information report w”ich arrived
yesterday is filled with excellent material. I
was delighted, of course, to see the coon-on—the-log
story. If you can spare me about 1/? doz. extra
cories I can dispatch several of them to persons in
Alabama who helped on that problem. Also I would
like for Hazell Harris to have one as she is so
involved with the wtole pesticide situation. She
wants to become a member of AWI, too.

., She called me yesterday to tell me of
'Aa meeting that you pay know about already. I have
\none of the details, but it seems that interested
persons and some govt. peOple are meeting at the
”'Natinnal Researdh Council Friday, January 15 at 10
A.V. on this subject.- I ama planning to go if I can
arranee it. I am working on a story for the Washington

Star on the need for more research, development and
2 actual operation of more biologic control. You plan
”_to be here that day -— is it for that meeting?

I have written Hill a letter on the
background of the ”scientific" review being undertaken
at F.J.A. on the beagles and Billie will follow up
with a copy of her letter to Day. I will see him

before long.

Whenever I can get the material together

and find the time, I want to try ny tand on a story
abtut the school-exreriment animal problem, noting
especially what has happened in Florida. Billie and
Fred seem to be off to a good start in Virginia on this.

I hove to see or talk to you Friday.

Yours,

oper Care for Science's Animals

By ANN COTTRELL FREE
Contributing Writer
/ The increase in the use gfwawni-
in medical, military and"

national industry and has brought
with it problems now attracting
congressional concern. '

Few persons outside the test
laboratories know that more than
51 million animals will be used
this year for research. Mass pro-
duction and consumption brings
headaches. But recent events here
make clear that if dividends are
to be realized in dollars, discov-
eries and goodwill, top priority
must be given to the care, breed-
ing and handling of these servants
of humanity.

“Good care is good business”
emerged as the synthesis of a re-

; cent three-day session here of 700

experts in the test—animal world.

. They were scientists, veterinarians,
‘ humanitarians,
1 makers of cage equipment and

animal breeders,

dog, mouse and monkey food.
Each had an important connec-
tion with this mushrooming $232-

may have a far-reaching effect on
the destiny of the American peo-
ple.

These experts at the 10th Ani-

 

mal Care Panel Were still feeling
their way in this new complex
ﬁeld, even to the point of seeking
clearer deﬁnitions of good care.
They found a valuable guidepost
in the ﬁrst congressional policy

 

statement on this subject. The
Senate Appropriations Committee
.recently declared that providing
“suitable and comfortable” quar-
‘ters for animals used in Federal
research is a “proper expense.”

British Authorities Here

Two visiting high authorities on
Great Britain’s laboratory animal
law reminded the panel, indirectly,
of what could lie ahead.

The holding of the panel here
pointed up the fact that Wash-
ington occupies a unique position
in the test-animal kingdom. What
happens here, both from the
standpoint of policy and research,
can inﬂuence the Nation. Few
places use so many animals to
ﬁght so many different battles for
man. The enemies they are pitted
against range from deadly cancer
to colors and chemicals added to
food, medicines and cosmetics.
Also their care and quarters vary
from the ideal to the niedievally
inadequate.

December 4, 1959

Dear Christine:

Your description of the dogs at Sloan-Kettering is
the kind of information that everyone should have. When people
know about these things, they want to correct them. That is, every-
body but the people who do have the power to correct them, it seems.

That certainly seems to be the case here with the
FDA animals. I understand that FDA is beginning to hear from. .
people. And I must say I am curious to know if Larrick has replied egg.
to your note. Yesterday the man from the Washington Humane Society ” \
inspected. He called and asked Billie Twyne to go with him. She
is now writing a letter to the authorities -— in this case Dr. Paul
Day, who is the Scientific Director for FDA and is on the board of
Institute of Animal Laboratory Resources and has a cnnnection, too,
with the Animal Care Panel -- stating that even the dogs allocated
to the labs from the pound are supposed to get exercise daily. Tess
getnn none at all and they do not even have a resting board.

-The problem,it seems to me,seems as much mix a
matter of persuading FDA to ask Congress for whatever extra money
needed as it is of persuading Congress to give it. Sen. Hill --
and I have been in touch with him on this -- stands by the policy
statement his committee made this last session. He is concerned
by such conditions and I made it quite clear that FDA is t
isolated incident. There may be more on this later when g talk to
you. (/45 mtécu 14a,- :facunu face/073,10, puny/(5 R511? {guy a: W//

The reason I am sending this special delivery is

that I am afraid otherwise you wouldn't get it éﬂﬂngonday. And
I want to be sure you saw Thursday's N.Y. Times' letter on the (: 99”!)
test beagles. You were propably surprised tosses that khnax the
Times carried such a detailed letter. ( I'll give you the background
on all this later.) .Hary H. Harris is Hazell harris. She is the

Helena, Billie and Hazell and I get together from
time to time to exchange ideas. Perhaps when you come down ( to see
the beagles, I hope) we can-533x arrange such a meeting. We fini
theee get-togethers very useful and pleasant. We meet at night.

I would like to hear your viewﬁand plans on the
for the next session of Congress. Anything doing on the lab. law .
introduction? Or do you expect to wait for another double session , new
administration etc? During these next months public attention must be
focused on the growing research animal field and the inadequate

facilities for care.

Again thank you for your good letter. You knew that

I Will do all I can to helkama __,,._.

LETTERS To THE STAR '

 

 

 

Man Backslides

The November 27 Evening
Star quotedSir Julian Hux-
ley’s speech at the Univer-
sity of Chicago in which he
predicts all religions are des-
tined to disappear to make

way for a new order of think-
ing because in the evolu-
‘ tionary pattern of thought
there is no longer either need
3 or room for supernatural be-
‘ ings capable of affecting the
, cOurse of events.

, One cannot help but feel
pity for Mr. Huxley and the
, scientists whom he addressed,
“ whose brilliant, God-given
, minds have become possessed
by the devil’s two favorite
‘ toolsz' pride and naivete.
a There is no “forbidden fruit”
for. the scientist or for those
who beneﬁt by his researches.
Nothing hinders us from
studying or from learning
how better to use material
things. They are ours, but
the grave- fault of medern
man lies in his imagining that
“because nature has delivered
over to him certain of her
secrets, she will one day un-
veil all mysteries to him. He
is mistaken in' thinking that»
because he is now able to
r destroy some microbes and
. to make new machines, he
5 will soon be able to eliminate-
:’ all evil and secure all good;
; that he will end by knowing
. all and by being able to do
; all, thus himself becoming
. “like God.”

, ‘ Adam and Eve at least left
i to the Creator a modest role,
. for they hoped to become no
more than His' rivals. Their
20th-century descendants
have gone far beyond them
in pride and naivete. They
' have concluded that God is
r superﬂuous, have cast doubt
: upon His existence and rel-
egate Him to a state so re-
j mote from the world that
i there is no longer any reason
for thinking of Him at all.
They have become enslaved
to material things and, in-
stead of going forward, they
sl1de back to the state of the
beasts, for after “all it is the
sense of the divine which
more than anything else
marks the distinction between

. names and addresses.

Man’s Best Friend _

Congratulations to . The

.Star on Ann Cottrell 'Free’s

November 15 article on the
care of laboratory animals.
It is a very timely piece of
reporting in View of the
stepped-up use of animals in
every ﬁeld of research from
space travel to lipstick dyes.

Ninety years ago Charles
Darwin said that the thought

of painful experiments on.

laboratory animals kept him
awake at night. The great
scientist’s sleeplessness led
to the passage of Britain’s
excellent law controlling live-
animal experimentation.
Perhaps some of your
readers have been made
sleepless by the plight of the

hundred beagles described by

Mrs. Free, which are con-
ﬁned in tiny cages in the
basement of the Agriculture
Building with no exercise
space. ' '

It is well known that dogs
so tightly conﬁned end by
becoming virtually stir crazy,
revolving like automatons
within the cage”. Some even
develop cage paralysis. In a
word they lose all normal
canine reactions if conﬁned
long enough. It is only' the
younger dogs which will still
try“ to lick the hand of a
visitor through the bars of
the cage.

It is now believed by many
authorities on the care of
laboratory animals ~that,

apart from humane consider-

ations, normal animals make
the best experimental sub-
jects.

Food and Drug Administra-
tion obtains its new test-
animal quarters by pact of
Congress adequate runways
for the dogs will be provided.

Let us hope that when the

Drinking and Drivina

Each year our appalling 1
traffic statistics tell us the ?
sad, true story of the many ‘
Washington area families
whose Christmas season was
destroyed by a holiday traﬁ‘ic
accident.

Isn’t it ironic that the, 2
Christmas season should have *
become such a time of
tragedy” and death on our
streets and highways? And
often it is the ﬂowing bowl
at the ofﬁce party which has

been responsible for getting

the Christmas trafﬁc toll off
to a dizzy start.‘

I am,'therefore, once again
calling on the District’s busi-
ness executives and profes-
sional leaders to “dry up”
the Christmas ofﬁce party.

Many employers ban alco-
hol from the ofﬁce party,
it a nonalcoholic
family affair aimed at the
employes’ “children. Others
take money that would ordi-
narily. be spent' on these
parties and “make ;a donation
to a charitable “institution.
Perhaps there are other pre-
cautions against sending a
drinking driver out into the .
holiday trafﬁc after an ofﬁce
party.

Please believe that we are
not trying to dampen the
traditional Christmas spirit.
Just the opposite. We are try-
ing to eliminate a deﬁnite

source of trafﬁc accidents—— .

accidents which can com- ,
pletely ruin Christmas for .v
any they touch. ‘ ,
Drinking and driving are a T
lethal combination—not only i
at Christmas parties, but any ,
time, anywhere. The most ?
dangerous drink ever con»,
cocted is the “one for the ‘
roadf’ , _
In true Christmas spirit, I
extend to all the joys of a
safe and happy holiday sea-
son. ,

November 22, 1959
' Dear Christine:

After our long phone conversation, I called Richard
Westwood, V. Russell at Nat'l Wildlife Fed., Ernest Walker, Billie
Twyne for her own Va. Humane Fed. and for Defenders. She, I believe,
senmrtelegrams for both organizations. Westwood and Nat'l Wildlife
man attended the conference. Ernest Walker is in poor health, recurring
heart attacks, so couldn'+ do anything, but authorized me to quote
him whenever I choose as to his sentiments!

Drewé Pearson, as you know, has had three cols. oaka
the entire pesticide, additive mess. Bill Blair in N.Y. Times 7
has a good round-up on the whole biz. too. Also note general story
on mail coming in. Irston Barnes of D.C. Audbbon and columnist
for Post had a good column today on all these toxic pesticides.
The Washington Siar, also, carried an editorial. I have copies of
all these plus a good many tore items if you want to see them.

1080
The big break through on this whole problem§xﬁnxigii
and all the rest, may come in this gongress.

And as the emphasis moves to the testing, setting
of standards, the seardhlight“ﬂﬁst be beamed on the test animals.
Don't you think so? ‘\

I sent North American Newspaper Alliance a piece somewhat
along that line. My focal point was the rat —- the test animal used
for the cranberry weedkiller, but before I was through I had brought
out the deplorable conditions of animal quarters in many places --
especially those for the beagles at the Food and Drug Administration.

Do not mistake me, Christine. I am not "at war" with
F.D.A. —- which is one of the best, but one of the mostli/ understaffed,
poorly housed, under-budgeted agency in town. My feeling is that
Dr. Day, Dr. Larrick et al must be encouraged to ask for better quarters
for the animals. I think they will get them, if they ask.

I cannot erase those beagles from my mind. Some were
withdrawn, circling in their cages "stir crazy," but many were
young enough to still respond with great affection as I put my hand
against the mesh.

This note is a bit~hurried, hitting high spots only.
I expect to be in touch with.Wpstwood and some of the others
in a few days. 'Nill let you know anything I heédiye of interest.
Thanks so much for calling. I Would like to share that phone call
with you as I talked so much about the beagles. Let me know.

rats by me, I would appreciate a copy . Nhe NEW York office of NANA

This letter has kicked
off some lively discussion
in the Star. Most of it
on the conditions of the
confinement of animals. The
move—the -Zr+~o idea didn' t
have much appeal. Actually
the land there can be used
to better advantage even
if guiiies have to be filled.

He called me about a mont:

ago to talk about Zoo
conditions. Ernest Walker
told him of my concern.
I wish we could get him in
the Friends of the Zoo, but
he says he is too involved
in things already.

You know him, I guess.
He is former ed. of Net. Park'

May 30, 1959
4500 Que Lane N.W.
washington 7, D.C.

Dear Christine:

Yesterday I went to Baring's office to study
the file, talk to him and to Seward. Baring mentioned‘that‘
a humane delegation from New York was coming to D.C. Monday.
He didn't know if it was your group or not.

I am sending this to you special delivery in
any case -— whether you are coming down or not.’ The info.
on the wild horse bill may be a bit later than what you have.
Also I Want to mention an opportunity to be a tremendous
force in influencing new intelligent and humane thinking
in respect to zoos -- not only here in‘Washington but eventually
world—wide. If you are to be here Monday we might have a
minute to talk about that on the basis of what I will outlie
later in this letter.

Seward was under the impression that he had
not passed on to you a copy of what may be the propbsed
amendment from the Bureau of Land Management. It arrived dnly
a few days ago from George Hardman, assistant director of the
Department of Conservation and Natural Resources of Nevada.
Hardran didn't say ELM had drawn it up but it most probably
did. There is some anXietE‘that Sen. cannOn might adopt this
idea for his bill. About ible I don't know.

The proposed’anendment is unacceptable to Baring
He has written VelmaJohnson to that effect. Hardman, too.

"Nothing in this act Shall be construed to Conflict ‘
with.the provisions of any Federal law or regulation
which permits the Land Management Agency reSponsible
for administration of public lands to hunt, drive,
round up and dispose of horses, mares, colts or
burros by means of airborne or motor driven vehicles
but humane measures will be used and all opeaations
will be under strict Government supervision."

As I will point nut in my newspaper story any amendmnt
of this type would find the govt. letting the contracts to the
same old wild horse hunters who have been doing it all the time
for the cattle interestss/

 




As you know, Thos. J. Lane ( D. Mass.) indicates that he
will go ahead With subcommittee hearings soon after receiving
the Interior Report.’ Seward says Lane has shown interest in
geing out to see a round-up. But what a Sunday School picnic
they'd put on for him.

Do you know whether Helen Jones' new Catholic Humane
Society has talked to Lane?

I am xzndkngxxmn ahvery interesting memorandum on the
Zoo Master Plan idea. This is my only copy. Only a few were
made and the person with the stencil is out of town. So, may
I have it back?

I recognize the fact that there are great many problems 11
the humane field that are more urgentthan a 200' but the xmmnx sum
total of poor conditions, dreadful boredom from’ solated indoor
cages, unnatural living conditions all add up to something pretty
5a.

And if there is a chance to do something about it and to
haveNa wideSpread influence going much further evgntually than“
the 'ati nal Zoo, I feel it is an opportunity not°be by-passed.

But the problem is one cf finding the people with the
tin: aid intelligence and humane approach to help undertake sud1
as as .

Now fer specifics: the Master Plan idea has been brewing
in a vague sort of way. ‘anx The idea is to have one drawn up to‘
give as a gift to the Zoo for presentation to the proper Congressional '
committees showing that a program of building, landscaping coulibe
worked out budget-wise etc.

Apparently no Zoo site planners or architects in this part of
the country. The site planners contacted were very expensive.
The firm of Palmer and Trotter of Warrenton has shown an interest and
will Work up somethingwith.models -- but no architectural plansfor
buildings -- for $5,000.

AtMZ the April meeting when this came up, I took the view that
we should take our time before letting a contract; that we should
not be a "rubber stamp" in giving all the authority to the*
site planners and oo directors but we should have some say-so too;
but first, we should educate ourselves on Zoos, which Mni' wouii

A new law prohibits the dis"

shore and in some areas up to
100 miles.

BEFRIEND DOGS—They were
successful recently in persuading
the Congress to appropriate
funds for the Food and Drug
Administration to build proper
quarters for its hundreds of test
dogs. For years they have been
confined in small cages in a sub-
basement.

_A few years ago, thousands of
letters—and not all written by
members of humane societies—-
flooded Congress demanding a
law to provide humane methods
of slaughter of meat animals.
Fifteen other countries, includ-
ing the .Fiji Islands, have such
laws. Federal legislation, how-
ever, does not cover all animals,
therefore legislation is or will be
sought in 38 states that to date
have not- passed state humane
slaughter bills.

Then there was the passage
of the “wild horse” bill, which
forbids therounding up by air-
planes of wild horses still left
on the plains and rimrock. This
success prompted the last Clark
Gable film, “The Misfits.”

And at the end of the last
session of Congress. President
Kennedy signed a law making
surplus grain available to pre-
vent starvation of game birds
and other wildlife during bliz-
zards.

General Federation of Women’s

islation. Pope John recently gave

his blessing to the three-year-old
National Catholic Society for Ani-
mal Welfare.

Many humane campaigns still
lie ahead. For example, humane
groups take a dim View of the
Department of Interior’s recom-
mendation that sea lions in Alas-
kan waters be slaughtered for
mink food. Experimental slaugh-
ter action left many animals
maimed. Legislation will prob-
ably be introduced again to out-
law—as at is in several coun-
triesm the steel leg-grip trap,
asking that the more humane
instant-inning traps be substitu-
ed. In Western states such as
Wyomin'I, there is a move afoot
to outlaw “steer busting” ex-
hibitions that cripple and kill
steers. '

Two bills are now pending in
Congress to regulate the care and
use of animals Used for research.
Proponents claim that medical
science will not be set back, but
furthered by better prOvisions for
care and for control of fear and
pain.

The record to date of humani-
tarians in obtaining animal proa-
tectiye laws is leading main
Congressmen to the same con
‘clusion. It is, they realize, bot'

Dear Christine:

I am not sending another copy of the W380 memo with
this because there have been some developments in the
hast few days that make me think it best to wait and
check a fact I had in it with Bill Allen. “e has been
out on sick leave all week.

Ray Wright, his assistant tells me that ESSC and FDA-GSA
had not agreed that the latter's sanitary sewer connection
of 6,000 feet wouid be large enough to carry off maximum
flood waters. If this iss so, I can see W33C‘s point of
View. ( I understood Allen to say that it would be large
enough.) To do this, plus all the extra equihment etc.
would he Very expensive.

So, now FDA may exrlore the feasibility of constructing
a septic tank. I? the land can handle this ( percolation
tests are needed) to determine this, it might be cheaper
than the extra large sum sewer connection.

When Bill gets back to work some of this confusion can
be cleared up. While Bill was in Boston, Ray Wright met
with WSSC and GSA and apparently wssc sounded mo e reasonable.
But unfortunately Wright hadn't been in on the other
discussions.

Some of this confusion should be cleared up shortly.

had been in the office and talkdd with her a while. She

Dear Christine:
When, oh when will the problems cease on the FDA building?

FDA and GSA have come tn the end of their reps in trying to
persuade the engineers of the Washington Suburban Sanitary
Commission to permit rain water to fall on the pens and wash
into the sanitary sewer.

So FDA ( Mr. Allen at Mr. Millerhs suggestion) called me
last week and asked us for help.‘ I have a copy of the ”SA
letter to Chairman Smith of the “830. I am enclosing it for
your information only , as, of course, it would not do for
us to circulate that around even to our helpers. He had to
go through considerable red tape to get it.

 

Mrs. Shaffer, who heads the little society in Prince Georges
County, is doing what she can. But whether Mr. Smith -- who
told her that he was unaware hexnaxxn of the case ~~ will be
helpful, I frankly don't know.

I wrote up the attached memo setting forth the facts. Mrs.
West through an influential Montgomery Co. friend is sending
it to the Montgomery Co. member of the WSdC. (The WSSC is
made up of Prince Georges and Montgomery County people but
the feeling is that Prince Georges is rather dominant The
WSSC has the reputation of being very difficult. It is, we
understand, answerable only to the Governor or the Legislature.

Frankly, I don’t know what you can do unless you and Roger
have a Democratic political or a real estate connection right to
the xenunnxihihex responsible people of the WSSC. but there is
certainly no reason why a n effective letter from you as Mrs.
Roger dtevens of the Animal Welfare institute as to the need of
this preper facility for these poor animals wouldn't be effective.
(Mrs. Sheffer seems to think they would be helpful.)

 

Before FDA falls back on the alternative of putthg up roofs,
months more will be spent seeking other ways and means, various
meetings etc.

If you want to call me —~ Or if you are coming to 3.0. ~-
I can probably supply additional information as to the political
ins and outs of the thing. Other names in Prince Georges etc...

NEW LAW HAILED

 

By ANN COTTRELL FREE
Contributing Writer ~
1’ Last Friday brought into near
reality the beneﬁts of the ﬁrst
of a number of Federal laws de-
signed to protect animals from
needless pain and fear. ’

This is the humane slaughter

1 law.
1 As it goes into effect—nearly

two years after its passage—this, .

country joins 15 others (including
the Fiji Islands) in granting
merciful dispatch, to millions of
l our meat animals.

The hard-fought campaign to

lpass this law has acted as a spur
for even greater concern for
animal welfare. The humane
movement has been growing in
1recent years.
1 When thousands of little Davids
1tackled one of the Goliaths of
American industry—the meat-
packers—and won, they showed
that in the face of cruelty, the
phrase “there ought to be a law”
is no longer an empty one.

And Congress has learned on
several occasions that when hu-
man beings give voice to the suf-
fering of voteless dumb creatures,
hey do so with articulate forceful-

ess.

The Element of Mercy

It seems, then, that humani-
arians—driven by their unquiet
consciences—have added' 'some-
thing new to both the qUality and
ua‘ntity of mercy.

They’ve put animal welfare into
politics if seeking congressional
help can be called politics.

. .And the ﬁrst political party—or
candidate—to adOpt the aims of
the active humanitarians may get
exceptional results.

So, as greater compassion comes
to many slaughter houses, the
stage is being set for other humane
campaigns. Among them is better
care and treatment of millions of
laboratory animals that serve man.
Legislation to this effect has al-
ready been introduced in both
Houses of Congress.

Supporters of this type of legis-
lation may be cheered (and op-
ponents forewarned) to know that
most of the groups that fought
humane slaughter the hardest
have stayed to welcome it—even
enthusiastically.

When the law went, into effect
Friday, most of the Nation’s big
packers were in near compliance.
At the last minute, due to some
small plants being unable to ob-
tain equipment in time, a bill was
introduced to extend the deadline
for them until September 1.

 

Provisions of the Bill

, But by and large after July 1,
the United States Government
must contract for meat that comes
from a packing ﬁrm which
slaughters all its meat in all its
plants by humane methods. The
packers doing business with the
Government slaughter a large
amount of. the Nation’s" meat.
"Meatpackers that do-not sell

Hog slaughter is a principal industry affected by new low.

to the Government—sand thus are-
exempt from the Federal law--
are being reached by-State laws.
To date~ California,- Minnesota,
New Hampshire, Washington and
Wisconsin have such laws. Legis-
lation is pending in New Jersey
and Louisiana. ,

Kosher ritual slaughter is per-
mitted under the law as humane.
But many humane societies insist
that non-ritual
hoisting of animals prior to
slaughter, be outlawed both on
Federal and State levels.

Functional tools do the job of
painlessly rendering an animal
unconscious before the thrust of
the knife.
months have been spent perfect-
ing these tools, such as the cap-
tive bolt pistol, the carbOn dioxide
tunnel and the electric stunner.

This retooling—~the, ﬁrst in the
history of this industry—~has cost
more than $5 million, according
to‘ the American Meat Institute.
This includes, as well, extensive
remodeling of old buildings.

Methods for Sayings

* Instead of pushing meat prices
up or lowering those to livestock
producers (as was once threatened

shackling. and '

Therefore, the last 18 '

opponents) new
to eﬁectuate

by the law’s
methods promise
savings to packers.

Administration of the law is
under the Department of Agri-
culture. It compiles lists of plants
using humane methods for fre-

quent publication in the Federal

Register. In addition each seller
must furnish to a Government
purchaser a statement of eligi-
bility. Falsiﬁcation courts crim-
inal penalty. An advisory board,
including humanitarians, packers,
labor and public members, such
as a representative of the Gen—
eral Federation of Women’s
Clubs, has helped to designate the
approved new methods.

Following in the wake of the
humane slaughter law may be
attempts to regulate the care of
livestock moving by truck in in-
terstate commerce. They are not
protected by the 28-hour law for
feeding and watering that is re-
quired of the railroads.

Since the slaughter law was
passed in August, 1958, congres-
sional help has been sought—and
won—to outlaw the rounding up
of wild h01ses on public lands by
aircraft or automobiles.

As this session recessed, legisla-
tion was pending to put a brake

on the wanton use of deadly
chemicals that not only kill pests,
but song birds and valuable, in-
nocent wildlife.

Encouraged by wide-spread pub-
lic support, the Senate recently
approved funds for plans and
speciﬁcations for a pharmacolog-
ical- animal laboratory building
for the Food and Diug Adminis-
tration. It would include proper
quarters for hundreds of FDA re-
search dogs, now conﬁned in tiny
cages for life in a sub-basement
of a Government building.

Wild Life Traps

A Federal law is being sought
to replace the old steel leg-grip
trap for wildlife trapped on public
lands with humane instant-killer
traps. The late Senator Richard
L. Neuberger was one of its chief
supporters.

The long arm of the humani-
tarians has reached as far as Mid-
way Island to help rescue the
‘gooney birds” from further
:lubbing to death by the United
States Navy. The storied Alba-
tross use Midway as a nesting
place, but unfortunately it has
become a hazard to aircraft. Out-
cries over the Navy’s method of
elimination resulted in a new ap-
proach. Dunes that may create
favorable air currents for the birds
are being leveled. And everyone
:5 hoping that the birds will go
somewhere else to nest.

A congressional eye also is being
turned to the direction of the
horseshow ring. Particular con-
cern is being expressed and ar-
rests being made—over the “sore-
ing” with acids and nails the feet
of the flashy Tennessee walking
horses. Often blood is left on the
tanbark or turf from the feet of
these lightly stepping horses.

On nearly all these recent hu-
mane issues, the humane societies
ha’ve shown a ' united front in
which lies their strength. Where-
as until about 10 years ago, there
was only one major national so-
ciety—the 83-year-old American
Humane Association ——- there are
now at least ﬁve.

Many Groups Active

Among those located in the cap-
ital are the vigorous Humane So- .
ciety of the United States, the
young but growing National
Catholic Society for Animal Wel-
fare, the Defenders of Wild-
life, and WARDS (Welfare for
Animals used in Research and
Drug Surgery), are among the
specialized groups.

Also here in Washington are a
number of strong conservation
societies that concern themselves
also with humane treatment of
wildlife as well as soil and water
measures. 7

From New York the inﬂuence
of the Animal Welfare" Institute
and Society for Animal Protective
Legislation also is felt here. These
two groups, currently, are the
chief backers of recently intro-
duced laboratory animal care
legislation patterned after the
British law.

August 3, 19614

Dear Christine:
This is a good letter to write.

The Senate last evening ~~ at 6.55 p.m. -- approved the
HEW appropriation bill, containing funds for the FDA lab»
dog facility.

Though we eXpected approval, having it a fact is a
relief.

No mention was made of it during the three days of
debate on the general bill. This, I think, reflects the
power of letters for the past two years to so many members
of Congress.

When I write about the new facility for general newspaper
distribution, I think I shall always be vague about the
amount of money or just refer to the $750,000 part for the
animals. You mentioned that a reporterﬂ was waiting for
some info. on it. Of course, in writing for animal publications
I think reportage on the full amount and how it is allocated
is of interest.

Leo Miller will call me tomorrow about the terminal
toxicity, our dates etc. I thought either August 17 or
about August 29. ne is to be out of town a good bit this
month.

I'll be in touch with you again tomorrow on the above.

I feel greatly relieved -~ and a little numb.

Sincerely,

EVENING AND SUNDAY

JAMES FREE
WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT

Dear Christine:

The Washington 5uburban Sanitary
Commission is still adamant. FDA now plans
to let GSA battle it out with the engineers
of the Commission this week. If no success
then, the next step would be lining up
influence on the political level, or possibly
getting a ruling from the Maryland Attorney
General to make an exception in this case.

I now understand the problem much better.
than I did the day of our meeting. Talked
at length with Bill Allen, FDA'S technical
man. It does seem so ridiculous not to
classify the water; rain or snow) that would
fall on those runways as polluted water and
let it drain in the sanitary sewer. FDA-GSA
are using this argument, pointing out that
the commission has no ojbjection t3 the number
of gallons of hose water goes down the drain
so why not rain water than would ﬂﬁll on an
area used by the animals?

The alternative of the roofs would be
expensive -p possibly $250,000. This would
mean cutting out one of those X wings. ( I'd
like to see them cut down on the number of
the dogs, of course.) They are afraid of
Uongress if they do not make facilities for
all 600 as stated. I do hope this thing
wmml not delay us too long. Do you have
any "pull" with the Commission? I have phoned
someone who knows a few politicos in Prince
Georges, but told her not to say anything until
GSA—FDA give up on current negotiations.

 




, QJPﬂN?&aﬂr1/
The Commission is quite &ogmatic/{; Montgomery

and Prince Georges Counties. Very, very powerful
and usually ﬁiﬁﬁﬁ-has its own way.

g.

I will keep you posted on this. Perhaps you
will be able to get some heigxmnxthixxiixthsvtimev
gxnxxxnmexx further background on the Comission
from other sources.

I am enclosing my note to Leo Miller and
a copy of the Senate HEW statement last year
in reg quartering of the dogs.

Dear Christine:

The meeting of the full appropriations committee has
been put off until this Tuesday, July 25. I understand
that Sen. Mansfield hopes to get it on the floor this
week, too.

Let's do what we can about this terminal toxicity
caging and handling. I talked to Lee Miller about it
this week after receiving your letter. I don't thin:
he had any idea of how dreadful this period is for the
animals. Perhaps we can persuade them to use something
to ease the dreadful pain.

I think I told you once about seeing one of these
terminal dogs just agter it died, how emaciated it was,
swollen tongue. On his body a tag was attached saying -
"DO NOt Feed.”

I think they become almost completely dehydrated by
loss of liquid from their systems.

Miller said he would look into it more thoroughy,
but in the meantime I think it would be well if you
got in touch with him, too. I told him of your interest.
I think it would be a good idea to go and see them.
I know you like to go places by yourself, but I wouli
be glad to go with you. Then, of course, we can make
the best recommendations as to the bottoms of the cages
or whether cages Egallz are not necessary.

 

As soon as anything develops on the FDA dogs, l'll
let you know. The meeting is Tuesday nxnx afternoon.

Hurriedly,

 

P.S. Did I tell you that I asked Miss Butler of
the Genderal Federation of Women's Clubs
to help on the FDA dogsA? See statement.

The letter from Russell really helps
the lab control bills more than all the
letters from the middle-readers.

We have nothing to worry about so.far as the
Subcommittee is concerned. uthmanmnnunnmmmuui
can be made until after the full committee acts.
It meets in.mid-week. I will notify you when
the bill is reported» Hold off until then in writing Hill
or any of the FDA people, or anybody.
When we talked on the phone the other day,
it slipped my mind completely to discuss with you
the problem of the cages for the terminal toxicity
dogs in the new bldg.

2 k ,mw

Stella told me she forwarded my 1etter(iiﬂl§ﬁ)
written while you were abroad. In that I explained
that grid bottom was to be used.

In the meantime, I hays supplied FDA ( Ra ond
Wright, the principal FDA architect on the job and

have notified Mr. Milleri Mr. Caldwell and Mr. Ellen
t

of my concern on this ma er. I suggested that fiber
glass cages with animperceptible tilt ( if possible)
be used. I sent some catalogs along that I obtained.

I will not prolong this discussion with you now,

run into even more bad luck. Margaret, his wife, has to

I talked to him today. His political problem will not

Dear Christine:

Leo Miller has probably called you by now, telling
you of the patch of bad luck we ran into with Senator
Allott yesterday.

Mr. Larrick did a fine job of justification of the
facility on great need and on the cost. But Allott is
determined to make an unjustified expense of any structure
for dogg; Even after Larrick told him that the dog quarters
amounted to only $750,000o of the needed $1,750,000, he
C Allott) said that would make it cost $1,250 per dog,
figuring on 500 dogs. Larrick explained that the value
to the government of ene test dog under testing for

2 1/2 years was $20,000. He explained that the land

 

was being obtained free from Agric. at Beltsville after

Allott ehallenged them on spending money for land in
Washington for the facility. It was clear to all that
Allott had not read any of the supportive testimony from
the humane groups last year. 39 went on to say that the
cost was "outrageous" and that money shouldn't be spent
on housing dogs when peOple didn't have good housing
throughout all the U.S. etc. etc. ,

I talked with Senator Hill after the session and he felt
we should get things going again so that Appropriations subc.

members would know their constituents are for this facility.

Incidently Senator Roman Hruska (Rep. Nebr.) is no longer on:»

Senator Andrew F. Schoeppel of Vichita, Kan. took his place.
Even if it gets through the subcommittee, we still will have
to worry.about full committee and the floor vete. Unless Allott
can be persuaded of the need and the “rock-bettom" price on the
facility, I am sure he will make a to—do about it on the floor
'when the bill comes up for a vote. Last year, he said nothing
thank goodness, but he did lead the floor fight against the N.I.H.
appropriation. He is GOP Minx whip this year and will probably
about cutting
be even more vociferous mexmx down on expenditures
Do you have a n Information Report going out soon, so you could
include a story on the need to get behind this? Or could you
send out a special bulletin? In a few days I will send you
more information as to the subcommittee members that need the
most attention. Apparently last year when the subcommittee marked
up the bill, Senator Hill met with many objections. And.I am not
sure just who made all of them. Also I will type up my notes
of the Larrick-Allott exchange and send to you.
Peyton Dunn had asked Forgarty's committeee to let her know
when the outside witnesses would be heard. 3he phoned me today

saying it would be April 19. I understand that when Larrick

testified before this subcommittee there were no questions from gﬂi»

the House subcommittee. lhose hearings for gov' t witnesses are closedﬂﬂ
I don't know the date that the Senate outside witnesses will

be heard -— it hasn't been set yet. She wants to testify then, too,

Just one organization on the record supporting the facility would
all
seem rather small, so I suppose that we should make a good vigorous

showing.
Please call me when you are here next and we can discuss this

further. Anything on the Cooper bill yet?

Dear Christine:

I imagine Leo Miller sent you one of the attached.
I suppose it was prepared to help justify the appropr-
iation for the building.

He wrote me that George E. Ewing Co. of Philadelphia
and Washington, D.C. has been selected as architects.
It might be well for us to check closely into the
plans and specifications quite soon so that no dreadful
mistakes get down on blueprints and we would have have
to fight bohﬁ/ have them rectified. Why don't you
call me about this on one of your trips down. In the
meantime, I'll do some preliminary work on it.

The following quotation is from the Federal Appropriations
manual put out by the General Accounting Office. Sen.
Hill's office sent it to me several weeks ago. It seems
to speel out the need for specific authorization to get

renovation money.

"Although appropriations made available to agencies
may be used for necessary eXpenses, the term "necessary
expenses" refers to current or running expenses of
a miscellaneous character incident to and directly
related to the agency's particular functions and does
not includes expenses for the construction and imppove-
ment of public buildings for which specific statutory
authority is required under 41 U.S.C. 12 38 Comp. Gen.

758.

"Renovations to aux make a building suitable for
occupancy by a Federal agency constitute "improvements"
within the meaning of 41 U.S.@. 12 and in the absence
of Specific authority in the agency appropriations,
general appropriations for necessary eXpenses may not
be used to reimburse the Gen. Serv. Administratirn for the
renovation work 38 Comp. Gen. 758.

The attached story from the Star points up two thmngs: One,
probably Amer. Vet. Ass'N official attitude. Two: all-too-
common error of reporters to think of any lab. animal bill
as anti-vivisection. I doubt if Riser called it a.v., hn

basic investment of approximately $15;000 to $2060Q0 ﬁor each 24:51
dog group. The scientific value, like the good-will in business,
is extremely difficult to evaluate, but it is obvious that this is
beginning to become very substantial by the end of the first year.

As the eXperiment develops and these dogs become older, new
and even more valuable scientific data are acquired from their
study. The basic cost runs about the same for each year, but the
scientific value obviously increases beyond the geometric proportions
of the time and funds represented in the experiment. It is quite
certain that, at the end of three years, the experiment could be
many times more valuable than at the end of the first year; and at
its completion--possibly five years later-vthe value of this par-
ticular test undoubtedly has grown beyond five times the first-
year value, for the simple reason that scientists have reached
the point where conclusions can be reached as to the effect of the
chemical upon the organs of the dogs.

It is necessary that the animals used for these tests be
housed in a fashion permitting precise and accurate records to be
kept on their day-tauday feeding, as well as providing a minimum

number of variables allowing clear 1nd1cations of reactions resulting
from the quantity of test substances they are consuming in relation
to their total dietary intake. Such high grade housing and care

are important for still another reason, however, and that is to
provide conditions promoting longevity. Since each dog becomes more
and more valuable to the experiment as times goes on, the death of
these an1mals prior to completion of the project means substantial
losses in terms of investments already committed to the eXperrment. _
A project of this type can suffer seriously from the loss of animals,
especially if the dogs d1e two or more years after initiation of the
project.‘ Proper environmental conditions reducing the mortality
rate to a nimimwm, therefore, is a most significant requirement for
such tests, producing better scientific results and penmitting,
greater returns from investments made in the project.

, In summary, the value of an experﬂment breaks in to two partsv-
funds for support and the intangible factor of scientific results.
It is safe to assume that a 5 year  experiment would be worth $100, 000
in cost alone, and many times that in scientific value.. An eXperi~
mental investigation which results in data affording a safe tolerance
level of a pest1cide or food additive- may affect an industry worth
millions of dollars. 0n the other hand, studies which reveal a
hazard in the Chronic consumption of a dye for instance, might
obviate serious diseaSes in a large portion of the population.v.
Assuming only a five fold increase in the value of the experiment
over thQ actual cost (then) each surViVing dog would be Worth

$25, 000 to $30 000 at the end of five years, taking into account

Dear Christine:

Hold on a minute longer and I think I’ll have
something definite for the Information Report, outlining
the precise status of the interim space problem and
which agency should be highlighted so far as the responsibility
is concerned.

Leo Miller has been out of the office quite a lot ( just
found that his wife had been hospitalized) so am dealing

' with his deputy, who has been on this right &_ong. Bruce

Cahdwell.

Cahdwell hoped to have the answer Friday, but didn't
get anything until today, but that wasn‘t definite enough
so now he has gotten Dale Thompson, director of General
Service for H.E.W., to get a specific report from G.S.A.

Cardwell says that Thompson should he e something
by tomorrow.

In the meantime, Will £1llen, F.D.A.‘s spice procurement
man, is going out to look at the place at Beltsville we
hOpe can be adapted for interim space for some of the dogs.

F.D.A.'s Dr. Durban told me weeks ago that he, Will
Allen and Dr. Curtis would look into the Beltsville place;
but apparently he didn’t follow through.

e.s.i. has old F.D.A. —— as I think I EFﬁe told you
earlier -— that is looking for space, has made some overtures
to Agriculture about getting 9,000 sq. ft. of extra
space in the subebasement of Agric. South Bldg But apparently
there hasn't been enough push on this.

It looks as if G.S.a. -— Franklin Floete -~ should have
some letters. I have thought this all along, but 3.3.A.
people have consistently said to me that so far as Beltsville
is concerned it should be a matter between Agric. and F.D.A.
Horrible muddle of passing the buck ( to mix a metaphor.)

But anyway, the . 1 ose of this note is to say that at
last I think we on the verge of getting the thing quite
clear so that all interested groups will know where to
concentrate attention. I do not think that working for
interim space will endanger getting the permanent facility in
View of the $100,000 appropriated for the permanent place.

 




And there is no reason to think that Hill and Fogarty will let
us down in pushing for the full amount when it is presented.

My hope is that we could get the building at Beltsvile, plus
the extra space down town. It would mean splitting up the dogs
and some connuting back and forth of F.D.A. scientific personnel,
plus spa sferring ( or hiring extra help) some caretakers to
the Beltf>ville place.

Your letter to Birmingham was excellent and I hope it will
have its effect. We are checking into the "white beeﬁle" angle
and hope to have some answers at this end from.Agriculture. Jim
may do a column on it for tVis Sunday. ”

I happened to lunch.with Surgeon General Burney, Senator Kerr
and some water pollution experts today and I mentioned the need
for H.E.W. doing more about the various hydﬂocarbons --1DT, dam
dieldrin etc :- There is to be a big Water Pollution Conference
here next weeks —- Dec. 12—14. And, the problem of pesticides
getting into Water, is one phase of that rater pollution problem.

If you want to call me tomorrow afternoon, I may have something.
If I don't hear from you, I'll drop you a note.

Yours,

ﬁzz/-

Dear Christine:

I mailed a memo on this on December 10 and unfortunately
it was returned. I reversed the numbers on the addressl

This has held up the anolmation Report and I am very
soory, but this latest pin—pointing of information at higher echelons
than I dealt with last week is fresher material.

My suggestion would be a reportage of the problem and
the suggestion that the humane people write to both agencies, asking
them to pool(/ their brains, ( perhaps resources) and go ahead with
this job/’

A cheering note: F.D.A. now is asking for the new
bldg. pengs of 4'x?‘ inside and 4' x 16' outside. his is a foot
wider in each case than mt specified earlier.

Stella‘sngge ted that I furnishé my Florida address -—
gon e from Dec. 16 to Unau.l. It is Pink Shell Cottages, 220 Estero
Blvd. Fort Myers Beach, Fla.

If you want to check further with any of the men
in the memo of course you know how to reach.Miller, Ualdwell et a1.
Althaus is ﬁx. 3-4900 ext. 4414. I gave him your name, address
and phone number, too.

Bne things to point out in the Enfo. Report is the
fact that Senator Hill in the hearings back last winter urged Larrick
to hurry and get interim space. It was not until this Sept. that
F.D.A. made its request of G.S.A. -- very slow on that. Also F.D.A.
has been rather cloudy as to just who's responsibility it is money-wise.

So aetters to both agencies would probably be best.
Floete and Flemming ( then Ribicoff.)

Wouldn't it be wonderful if our friend W.R. Poage of
Texas were named Secy of Agriculturef If nobody named by the
time you get this, land in case you hadn't heard the rumors out there
in Wise.) may be you can put in a plug.

Anxious to hear outcome of Chicago meeting.

SUEEECT: Interim space for F.D.A. dogs

From: Ann Cottrell Free

This problem boils down to the question of finding money ~—
an estimated $112,000 -- to renovate, install runways, air-conditioning
etc. of a possible 9,000 sq. ft. in the sub-basement of S. Bldg. of
Agriculture.

Though this space, fairly close to where the dogs are kept now and
used by Agriculture for storing crates for exhibits etc, has not been
obtained from Agriculture, my conversations with G.S.A. indicate that
if the money could be found for the job described above, that probably
Agriculture coumd be persuadedto release it. (It would mean that
G.S.A. would have to find another spot for all that paraphnalia for Ag.)

G.S.A. maintains stoutly that it has no money for the job. I
spoke at some length with Richard D. Althaua, Director of Space
Management Division of G.S.a., today. He says that all of G.S.A.'s
money is programmed already for other renovation projects fur other
agencies of govt. He and others at G.S.A. maintain that finding the
money is F.D.A. and H.E.W.'s responsibility.

HZJ's Rufush Miles, Direc‘tor of Administration, and Caldwell
and Miller of F.D.A., say that they have no money. They have also
maintained that it is G.S.A.'s responsibility.

I have gone back and forth from agency to agency seVeral times,
speaking to a number of peOple. My question sometimes brings forth
a few rays of hope. For example, Melvin Hemmer, also of G.S.A. space
acquisition, spoke of the fact that this is a "special purpose"
facility and that their work is only for "general purpose“ space when
it comes to picking up the check. But Mr. Althaus discounted this
somewhat when I asked if this couldn‘t be put into the "general purpose"
category.

Whether letters from humane-minded people to both H.B.w. and
G.S.A. simultaneously would prompt these gentbemen to go into a serious
huddle and figure out where they could get the money -- without going
to Congress -- will work or not, I don't know. But we could try.

I rather think it would be a mistake to get Congress back
in on this as we are still seeking the full amount for the permanent
facility. Thus, the situation could become confused. I don't know
whether the interim money from Congress could be obtained before
next summer or whether it could be handled by the Approp. committees
or would have to go to the two Public'ﬂorks Committees.

G.S.A. is getting letters all the time and is conversant wiﬁi

the public demand. Personally, these G.S.A. people -- just as many
we know in F.D.A. ~— are sympathetic. Althaus says "if the money were

there, I would give this a high priority to move along fast."

a .3 Q

 




G.S.A., on the other hand, has taken from Sept. 16 to now answering
F.B.A.‘s request for finding the interim space. ( This 9,000 sq. ft.,
incidently, is the sane area I have discussed with F.D.A. and G.S.A.
since last winter.)

I am of the opinion that the old kennel found at B ltsville is
not a very practical answer, in View of the fact that‘ ill accommodate
only about 50 dogs, needs a lot of work on it meaning money, and
Agriculture is not ready to give it up.

So it seems best -~ I would say in summary -~ to concentrate our
attention on the 9,000 sq. feet in Agriculture sub-basement. Perhaps,
by the dint of persuasion, miracles etc., the money could be found.
Perhaps Secretary Ribicoff might wave a magic want and say to H.E.W.-F.D.A.,
"scrape the bottom of the barrel, but come up with it." 0r maybe

Floete or his successor might do the same.

All agree that it will be at least two years before those miserable
animals will be in the new bldg. Two years is the entire lifetime of
manyl .

Dear Christine:

I talked with Shadduck one of the officials of
‘Judiciary Committee today.

There is a possibility that the Wild horse bill
might get out of Judiciary tonorrow. Civil Rights bill comes
first, however. .

g If it comes up on the Consent Calender, that would
bee August‘ 7. ( There are, as you know9 only two consent days

1‘

a month.jhi

It could be brought up under a rule or suspension
of the rule, but no serious thought of that at present.

I talked with Seward before calling Shadduck, whom
I got to krow when I was working on my Wild horse story for Star.
Seward8s info. not as detailed as Shaﬁduck's. Billie Twyne called
me this a.m., disturbed by the slowness in *enorting the bill.
Neither she nor Seward had seen your latest bulletin to your
members. -

Frankly I would be a bit surnrised if the bill
gets out of Judiciary tomorrow. But as long as it gets out
before August 17, that is the important thing.

Shadduck says that since the tearings letters of
Opposition from grazing interests etc have been increasing.
Especially from sheep people.

I ’ooe that it can get through the Senate
machinery after passage in House without any tinewtaking
blah blah.

Hurriedly -- and all the test.

4500 Que Lane, N.W. 7. 9.0.
September 18, 1960

Dear Christine:

M. This past Friday both Senator Hill's office and
Leo killer called to report that at last H.E.W. was maktng the
request to G.S.A. about the need for interim space. '

Miller also said that the H.E. . people insist
on putting in the request for the permanent building money on
the annual budget, rather than on the supplemental. That would
mean that it would be late next summer before the money would
be available to go ahead with a building. 80, it will be at
least two years before the dogs have better space than they
have today unless some interim arrangement is made.

Reasons for this was two—foléd: 1. Doubt that
there is time for G.S.A. to line up the architects to work out
the plans and specifications for cost purposes in time for
incorp ration in the supplemental budget request. 2. Thefact that
the supplemental requests for departments are not acted upon
by the H.E.W. subcommittees 6f the House and Senate ApprOpriations
Committees, but by the full committeesaKXXngxxxxxnxnxxxxxiX This
excuse, however, seems rather weak, as in the Renate, Lister Hill
would.be there to look out for the item and in the House-gogarty
would be there to push for it. I want to look into this a bit
more before I am convinced.

G.S.A. should have the request in hand by now —- as
the formal applioation was drawn up last week —— for the job of
lining hp the architects, deciding on site etc. for the permanent
structure.

When it comes to size of pens and runs ( my great
concern) Leo Miller says that nothing will be decided on this
until the architects etc. are lined up. HEW—GSA anﬂx should be
well aware of the size and type that all of us prefer as it is
in the testimony before the committee.

One purpose of this letter is to tell you that Leo
Filler inadvertently thought that the Animal Welfare Institute
and the Animal Care Panel were pretty much the same thing. As
a result, he thought he would be doing the humane side a great
service by sending one of his tOp men ( Will Allen) to the Ani al
Care Panel meeting in St. Louisl Allen would gather ideas there
on types and size of pens and runs,gd£.

When he told me this, I quickly straightened him
out on the difference and cautioned him about the ACP attitude on
many matters, such as its connection with the N.S.F.R. Told him
of N.S.h£B.'s reception ( the Nazi-stuff etc) to the Cooper bill.
He was glad to be informed of all this. But just what he will
do about sending Allen, I don't know. When you are in town or
if you cauld talk to him, I think it might be helpful.

 




You are familiar, of course, with the life~Sian study
(MMW’ on dogs being conducted at the University of California.
“5:; I sent for some material, thinking it might be helpful on
“01’” minimum space for ccnfined animals.
Dr. Anderson sent me a reprint of his recent article
July 15, 1960 in the American Veterinary Medicine Association
Journal.

He emphasizes that no dog should be quartered alone, but
needs one companion.

On space he says this: "Previous studies gave evidence
that rectangular pens ( l pen: 2 dogs) providing at least
10 sq. ft. per inch of body height are satisfactory when
dogs are kept in pairs.”

I do not have a beagle handy to measure height, but I
imagine they run about 16 inches, more or less, in height.
That would mean 160 square feet.

( I Vote, however, from his blueprint diagram in the article
that his pens -- including the two raised barrels for the dogs
to sleep in —— are about 32? square feet. This makes me wonder

if he has very tall dogs or if he meant the square footage for
each dog. But even so, if the measure xix of the pen is based
on only one dog of the pair, think of how large his specifications
are compared to F.D.A.'s proposed total of 48 sq. feet in and outL)

Our specifications, suggested in the committee testimony,
would be a good compromise C about 84 sq. feet).qu

I told Mr. Miller about this study and he was delighted
to hear about it. I am sending the reprint to him.

I awareciate your view about the possibility of minor
differences of opinion between humane groups being 591733
upn to delay and mess up thing. We Will just 50 along as we
have. And compared to a year ago, I would say that we had
made progress with this flexible cooperation between us all.

Thanks so much for sending the copy of "Humane Biology
Projects." I am very anxious to see it as I want to get along
with that story. Unfortunately the copy has n93 arrived.
will let you know in a day or so if it doesw't come.

That is all for ngﬁ. My best.

6M0!

Dedember 12, 1963

Dear Christine and Stall:
I am dumfounded!

The Washington papers have been more than
kind. ( Now let 3 get behind them to go all
out on the ultimate kindness for all lab.

animals!)

As you will notice, the Washington Post
jumped the gun on the release. But I imagine
this was inadvertent.

Betty Beale, as a matter of fact, almost
did the same thing. She called the other night,
Tuesday, a0 nhn check on something about the
announcement. She had planned to run it Wed.
I pointed out the Thurs. release date and left
it at that. You can imagine how astonished I
was when the next morning I saw the Post had

done it.

I feel so unworthy of all this.

Yours,

/9

Mrs. Christine Stevens

lhe Aﬂinal Welfare Institute
22 East 17th Street

New York, N.Y.

Dear Christine:

This to thank you more formally than on the
telephone for your invitation to receive the Schweitzer
medal. I would be greatly honored and would be glad
to be at your home at 3 P.M., Monday, December 1 .

When we talked on the phone I said that I would
write, but that was primarily to pass on whether I
would be staying with you. That in very kind of you,
but Jim doesn't yet know whether he can come. So
I'll just plan to stay at a hotel. While in New'York,
I will probably check in with my editors at NANA and
Dodd,Mead so will "hole in" for a couple of days at
some convenient hostelry.

I look forward to reading your AWI bulletin 509%
material and am sure I'll have no suggestions. But ”
this will give me a clearer idea of your concept of
the award. I suppose you are handling this also, as
in the past, with the usual press statement, too. I
would be happy to cooperate in any way.

Again my thhmeks. You have inspired and encouraged
me in my aniral welfare work and writing. Because
you have no qualms about what some would consider the
impossible. And you have great tenacity and spirit.
That medal symbolizes too your qualities in this regard
as well as Dr. Schweitzer's. With such recognition
as the medal gives, it helps to giver greater recognition,
too, to the plight of so many helpless animals -- who
depend so greatly on so few.

Sincerely,

ﬂax-”r

Rare Horse [3 Star of Book

By M eryle Secrest

ON THE FACE OF IT, a
'name like equus przewalski
doesn’t -sound particularly
romantic.

But five minutes after
Ann Cottiell Free had set
her eyes on the stubby,

fieice rare little horse in its
iprosaic paddock at the Na-

tional Zoo, she knew she
wouldn’t rest until she had
written a book about it.

Five years later, the result
is an excellent children’s
book, “Forever the Wild
Mare,” (Dodd, Mead and
Co.) which has already won
a fiction award (the Dodd
Mead-Boy’s Life Writing
Award) before its Monday
publishing date. Audiences
to the Washington Post
Book Fair will hear Mrs.
Free speak on Nov. 25.

The book has brought its
author to the end of a fas-
cinating trail that has in-
cluded letters from such ex-
otic sources as a distin-
guished Russian professor
and a Tibetan Lhama.

Its hero, 14- -year- old Jebby
(James
diews) is the one whose
first look at the rare Mongo-
lian mare inspires a passion
to ride her and starts him

.—~.. WWW

Ewell Brown An--

off on a series of adventures
with Major MacFee, Doris

Lama and a teen-age ‘gang

all over Washington—in the
Zoo, Rock Creek Park, and
of course, Capitol Hill.

IT’S A ROUSING GOOD
STORY for the youth of

9 to 90, as Mrs. Free puts it.
It also illustrates some of
her deep feelings about the
importance of a fundamen-
tal respect for nature. As
she says in her preface:

“Shakespeare reminds us
of ‘tongues in trees, books
in running brooks, sermons
in stones.’ One of the les-
sons the trees, brooks and
stones would teach us is
that mam-regarded as the
highest form of nature—can'
not put himself forever
above nature, nor inflict his
will on all of nature, just be-
cause he chooses to do so.
If he doesn’t use a little
self control, nature will
strike back and eventually
destroy him.”

As the wife of James Free
and mother of 8-year-old
Elissa says, the book is a
great converging of her in-
terests.

To begin with, her imagi-
nation has always been
stirred by the remote sec-

tion of Central Asia where
the przewalski horse, au-
thoritatively believed to be

the ancestor of the modern
horse, was discovered
around the turn of the cen-
tury.

“The reason the horse sur-
vived is because it was in an
area in the far reaches of
outer Mongolia that are far
more interesting, challeng-

ing and entrancing to me
than the moon ”

THEN THERE was her
own early love . for the
horses --she started riding
(in Virginia) at the age of
seven, and her life long in?
terest in writing—she’s a
well-known Washington cor-
respondent whose byline has
been seen all over the
country.

Finally, there is her'par-
ticular interest in the many
aspects of conservation (in-
cluding the political ones);
animal welfare, youth prob-
lems and environmental
health, or, as she puts it, na-
ture, animals and politics.
Like Rachel Carson, she
finds mankind’s indiscrimi-
nate use of the air, land and
seas around him deplorable.
She is one of the founders
of the Friends of the Nation-
al Zoo.
