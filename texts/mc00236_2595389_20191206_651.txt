ACCOMPANYING READERS AND CREATE OUT OF
THEM A LARGE ANTHOLOGY (ALONG THE LINES

OF, SAY, FEINBERG'S REASON AND
RESPONSIBILITY). BUT THESE TWO JOINT-
VENTURES REPRESENT DECISIONS TO MADE DOWN
THE ROAD, SO TO SPEAK. THE IMMEDIATE ORDER
OF BUSINESS INVOLVES (I) THE SINGLE-AUTHORED
TEXT AND (2) THE COMPANION READER. LET ME
SAY SOMETHING ABOUT EACH.

 

' 1. THE SINGLE-AUTHORED TEXT: IN YOUR CASE
THIS WOULD BE A BOOK IN WHICH JERRY
DWORKIN WRITES FOR STUDENTS TAKING THEIR
FIRST
COURSE IN POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY. THE OBJECT,
THEN, IS TO GIVE YOUNG MINDS A SENSE OF WHAT
POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY IS, IN BOTH ITS
THEORETICAL AND ITS PRACTICAL EXPRESSIONS.
RACHELS, FOR EXAMPLE, DOES THIS BY TAKING
STUDENTS ON A TOUR OF SUCH TOPICS AS "ETHICS
AND RELIGION," "ETHICAL EGOISM,"
"UTILITARIANISM," AND "KANT'S THEORY," BUT
TAKING PAINS ALONG THE WAY TO ILLUSTRATE
WHAT THESE DIVERGENT THEORETICAL
PERSPECTIVES ARGUABLY IMPLY WHEN IT COMES
TO SUCH PRESSING MORAL ISSUES AS ABORTION,
FAMINE, PUNISHMENT AND EUTHANASIA. I
ASSUME THE BOOK IN SOCIAL/ POLITICAL
PHILOSOPHY WOULD (ROUGHLY SPEAKING)
CHART A THEORETICAL/ PRACTICAL COURSE
APPROPRIATE TO THE DISCIPLINE. BUT HOW THIS
MIGHT BE, AND EVEN WHETHER IT SHOULD BE

' DONE, ARE QUESTIONS THAT ARE VERY MUCH
OPEN FOR DISCUSSION.

AS FOR BOOK LENGTH: RACHE LS'S FIRST EDITION
RAN APPROXIMATELY 65,000 WORDS, THE SECOND
EDITION APPROXIMATELY 72,000, EXCLUDING
FOOTNOTES. THAT WORKS OUT RESPECTIVELY TO
APPROXIMATELY 260 PAGES AND 288 PAGES IN
STANDARD (250 WORDS PER PAGE) MANUSCRIPT.

THE ROYALTY DEAL I BELIEVE I CAN ARRANGE IS
BETTER THAN ANY I KNOW OF. IT'S TEN PER CENT
OF SALES. MOREOVER, I WOULD PRESS MCGRAW-
HILL TO GIVE YOU A GRANT UPON SIGNING A
CONTRACT THAT ALSO WOULD BE THE BEST. (I
BELIEVE I COULD DEMAND $2,000, NOT
ASSIGNABLE AGAINST YOUR ROYALTIES. THAT'S
WHAT I WOULD TRY FOR, IN ANY EVENT). GIVEN
THE LIKELY PROSPECTS OF MULTIPLE EDITIONS,
THIS BOOK HAS THE REA LISTIC POTENTIAL OF
EARNING A TIDY SUM. “0% OF 25,000 COPIES AT
$18.00 A COPY EQUALS $45,000. THIS IS HARDLY AN

. UNREALISTIC FIGURE. IF ANYTHING, IT COULD BE
UNDERESTIMATED].

2. THE ANTHOLOGY: IN THE CASE OF THIS BOOK, I
ARGUE FOR A MONETARY COMMITMENT FROM
THE PUBLISHER THAT SHOULD COVER ALL
PERMISSION FEES. I BELIEVE THE PUBISHLER'S
COMMITMENT IN THIS CASE IS THE MOST
GENEROUS IN THE INDUSTRY. IN OTHER WORDS, I
TRY TO NEGOTIATE A CONTRACT THAT IN SURES,
AS FAR AS THIS IS POSSIBLE, THAT YOU (AS THE
EDITOR) WILL NOT LOSE ANY EARNINGS FROM
THE BOOK BY BEING OBLIGATED TO PAY FOR
PERMISSION TO REPRINT THE WORKS YOU
ANTHOLOGIZE.

RACHELS PUT TOGETHER SUCH A BOOK IN ETHICS,
DIVIDED INTO THREE PARTS: (1) TWO SHORT
CHAPTERS ON "MORALITY AND MORAL
PHILOSOPHY" AND "SOME BASIC POINTS ABOUT

‘ ARGUMENTS"; (2) REPRESENTATIVE SELECTIONS IN
MORAL THEORY (MILL, KANT AND OTHER
PREDICTABLES, BUT ALSO A FEW SURPRIZES [FOR
EXAMPLE, A NICE SELECTION BY AYN RAND]; AND
(3) A COLLECTION OF "FOR-AND-AGAINST"
READINGS THAT ADDRESS CONTEMPORARY
MORAL PROBLEMS. IN RACHELS'S CASE, THE FIRST
EDITION OF THIS BOOK TOTALS 270 PAGES,
EXCLUDING FOOTNOTES. A SECOND EDITION IS
UNDER DISCUSSION.

I SHOULD BE ABLE TO SECURE A 1000 ROYALTY ON
THIS BOOK FOR YOU AND, GIVEN THE WELL-
FOUNDED ASSUMPTION THAT THIS ANTHOLOGY
ALSO WILL ENJOY MULTIPLE EDITIONS, ONE CAN
REASONABLY ANTICIPATE SOLID ROYALTIES.

IN SHORT, IT IS NOT UNREASONABLE TO LOOK
FORWARD TO SIGNIFICANT TOTAL EARNINGS
FROM THESE TWO BOOKS-—ASSUMING, AS I HAVE
EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE, THAT YOU CRAFT
TWO BOOKS THAT ANSWER/ CREATE THE SORT OF
"CONSUMER DEMAND" THAT OTHER BOOKS IN THE
- SERIES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO.

AS FOR A TIME FRAME: I LIKE TO HAVE A FULL
FIRST DRAFT OF THE SI N GLE-AUTHORED TEXT ONE
YEAR AFTER THE DATE OF SIGNING THE
CONTRACT. BUT THIS IS NOT A DEADLINE SET IN
CONCRETE; THERE'S ROOM FOR NEGOTIATION. IN
THE BEST OF ALL POSSIBLE WORLDS (ESPECIALLY
FROM THE INDIVIDUAL A UTHOR/ EDITOR'S
FINANCIAL POINT OF VIEW) IT'S BEST TO HAVE THE
READER PUBLISHED SIMALTANEOUSLY WITH THE
SINGLE-AUTHORED TEXT. BUT THIS IS NOT
ESSENTIAL, AND THE DEADLINE IN THIS CASE
ALSO IS NEGOTIABLE.

THE ABOVE SETS FORTH THE BASIC IDEAS AND
TERMS THAT DEFINE THE HERITAGE SERIES. I

Dear Jerry:

Please accept my apology for not writing to you sooner. I have been innudated by all manner of
weighty responsibilities, with the result that some important matters, including this letter to you,
have had to be delayed.

Concerning the "real money" someone might earn from a college level text of the type we're
discussing, the standard royalty, as I understand it, is 10% of net sales. From my experience, a
solidly successful book, selling for, say, $15, can enjoy sales between 20,000 and 25,000 per edition,
with the expectation that a book with this sort of market success will go through mulltiple
editions.

So let us assume that such a book goes through three editions and sells 60,000 copies. Total royalties
would be $90,000 -— no small change by my lights but, of course, that's spread out over a number of
years.

On the other hand, I know of some texts, even those that have gone through several editions, that
only sold between 2-3 thousand per edition, and others that sold more than a hundred thousand
copies!

The upshot is, one can make a lo_t of money, or a little, or -- more likely, I think —- something in the
range of the "real money" described above.

I should also add that authors receive cash money up front (not against future royalties) when they
sign a contract for the Heritage Series, that they receive other such payments when subsequest
editions are prepared, and that (minimally) they also receive royalties for the companion reader
they prepare. (On this, see the enclosed copy of Rachels's The Right Thing to D0. which he
assembled to be used in conjunction with The Elements of Moral Philosophy but which can be, and
has been used, independently of that book).

I hope this short dissertation on "the market" goes some way towards answering your question. I'll
be happy to discuss this and any other related matter with you, should you wish to do so. As I've
tried to indicate, I would be enormously gratified if you saw your way clear to contributing to the
Series.

Wishing you well, and looking forward to your reply, I am,

Yours sincerely,

P.S. Perhaps the best way to reach me is via fax (919-782-6464).

Dear Karen:

Quite a long time has elapsed since last we spoke about the possibility of
your contributing a book on aesthetics to my McGraw-Hill "Heritage
Series." I am writing to inquire whether you are still interested in this
project and, if so, when you think you might have the time to begin work
on it.

Of course, I continue to hope that your interest remains alive and well,
but I would appreciate knowing, in the next few weeks, one way or the
other.

Thanks for your time and attention.

Yours sincerely,

Dear Bill:

A few years back we discussed the possibility of your contributing a
book on the philosophy of religion to the Heritage Series I edit for
McGraw—Hill. You indicated your interest in mulling this over but
explained that you would not be able to take this on for several years,
if at all.

I'm writing to ask whether (a) you still are interested in considering
this project and, if so, (b) when your existing commitments would
permit you to commence work.

Obviously, because I have foregone inviting anyone else to write this
book, you remain my first choice. Just as obviously, I hope you'll be
able to do it.

If you don't mind, could you let me know, in the next week or so, how
things stand.

Thanking you for your time and attention, and wishing you well, I am,

Yours sincerely,

I am pleased to report that Bill Mann has verbally agreed to do the
philosophy of religion component of the Heritage Series, and that Karen
Hanson has made a similar commitment for the aesthetics component. Both
Karen and Bill understand that they will need to send along rough outlines
of what they propose to do and how they propose to do it, and both
understand that we would all be helped if this could be done in a timely
fashion. Perhaps you might wish to discuss this matter with them directly,- if
you prefer that I do this, just let me know. Their respective addresses:

Dear Cynthia:

Ever since Larry Thomas wrote and said he had decided not to do the
political philosophy component in the Heritage Series, I have been
exploring other options. Jerry Dworkin was lu_st on the edge of agreeing
only finally to decide against it. In any event, I am still exploring other
possibilities. The really good news, of course, is that Hanson and Mann
have agreed.

One other matter. All of my most recent royalties were forwarded to my
daughter Karen's trust. Heretofore only the royalties for Matters of Life
and Death were sent to her trust. I am entirely satisﬁed with having all the
royalties go to her, as they have on this occasion, and I am not writing to
complain at all. The one thing my accountant, David ]. Worthington, has
instructed me to make sure of, is that my danger, not me, is the one who
receives the 1099 form when tax time rolls around. If you would be so kind
as to convey this information to the appropriate person / s at McGraw-
Hill, I would be most grateful.

 

Thanking you for your prompt attention, and looking forward to seeing
you in Atlanta, I am,

Yours sincerely,

Thank you for your letters. I am glad to hear that Bill Mann and

will call them this week to discuss schedule. I was sorry to
hear from you that Larry Thomas had dropped out; he didn’t write

Standard procedure is as follows. If you are interested, both Cynthia
Ward, the McGraw Hill philosophy editor, and I would need to review a
propsectus (about 6—8 pages, say),- then, if we are satisfied (and I cannot
imagine that we would not be), a due date would be agreed upon and a
contract awarded. Obviously, the sooner the prospectus can be produced,
the sooner the project can get under way. Assuming that you are still
interested in participating in the series, when do you think you might be
able to submit the prospectus? And assuming a contract is forthcoming,
when do you think you would be able to submit the completed manuscript?
A response at your earliest convenience would be most welcome.

It was good seeing you again. It was especially kind of you to take the time
to attend my presidential address. I'm sure you had better things to do.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon, hoping to work with you in the
coming months, and wishing you well, I am,

Yours sincerely,

Dear Tom:

I regret not being able to respond more promptly to your letter of
8 January. George Washington University has been closed for a week
due to the "great freeze" and power shortages, leaving us with no
mail service since Friday the 14th.

In) any case, it really was good to see you in Atlanta, even if
briefly. I am very pleased, indeed honored, to be invited to submit
a prospectus for alxxﬂ<irlpolitical/social philosophy for McGraw's
Heritage Series which you edit. I hope earnestly that you might

allow me another two weeks (until about 4 February) to make a final
decision.

While I emu strongly attracted to the project (and have already
spent a day or so ruminating about topics, a table of contents,
etc.) my final decision will depend on two major concerns.

First, I need to develop a coherent conception of the book as a
whole. Covering political a_nd social philosophy is a very tall
order, and while I have already made good strides in conceiving how
the most compelling issues and topics might be covered, I need yet
to conceiveahow'to work in illustrative and instructive "real world
problems." In addition, I may have trouble with the minus-200 pages
boundary as represented by Jim Rachels's and W.R. Carter's books.
(My tentative concept suggests.10 chapters at about 30 pages each.)

My second concern relates to the way this project might fit into
other research/publication commitments. Aside from final revisions
of a few articles, I have two upcoming book projects. Cynthia
Miller at the University Press of Kansas has expressed strong
interest in bringing out a collection of papers from the August
1994 conference I am organizing on "philosophy and Cultural
Diversity." In addition, I have submitted a grant proposal to
support my writing of a book long simmering on back burners. The
latter work, tentatively titled The Evil That Good Men Do, would
offer a philosophical critique of explanations in the behavior
sciences of the complicity in atrocities of presumably ordinary
folks. If the grant goes through, I will be obligated to give the

801 ZZND STREET. NW. . SUITE T 525 . WASHINGTON. DC 20052 . (202)9946265

 




lion's share of my time to that project. Even if there is no grant,
I might want to go ahead with the latter book as it dovetails so
well with my most recent research papers (on altruism, intolerance,
genocide, and the moral psychology of the 'desk.murderers'). At the
same time, however, I might be able to get a good head start on a
book for your Heritage Series (with several chapters in first
draft) if I make it my major project between this winter and June
when the grant might be received.

So as you can see, I need to complete some sorting out: not just
to re-think priorities, but also to collect scattered notes, etc.
thereby getting a firmer sense of the time/ energy commitments doing
a book for your series might likely require. It would be most
helpful to me to know whether I might have until February 4 before
deciding, and also what sort of_time frame you and Cynthia Ward

0'. o o ’ .4 : o_.
might have in mind for a-comnleted manuscript.

In closing I am happy to report that I'm enjoying my ruminations
about a prospeCtive book for your series. I would enjoy working
with you and I hope that I'll find a way to fit this project into
my schedule. Finally, I would love to have something by you
relating to moral concern for animals for the prospective (and very
probable, I believe) Kansas anthology.

Ran dy-

I've read over your introduction and made a handful of suggestions
and corrections. The only substantive comment that comes to mind is
whether more might be done to integrate what you say with the
classifcation of topics discussed in the readings themselves. But
perhaps you plan to write separate introductions to the several parts,
in which case the idea of greater integration between your lead—
introduction and the rest of the book would lose much, and possibly
all, of its force.

I'll call Random House and ask where things stand regarding review
of the manuscript. If the revi ew is in process, the best thing to do, it
seems, would be to wait and see what's said and how RH responds.
After these matters are settled, we can discuss the next step. To the
extent that I can be of help, as the project approaches its final stage, I
will be pleased to be so.

Yours —

Dear Larry:

Just a few lines to catch you before you leave town again. People are
saying you are going to Temple after Texas, just to do Bill Cosby one
better. Me, I don't believe it.

Anyhow, the occasion for my writing is to ask you for a progress report on
the political philosophy book you're writing for the Heritage Series. We try
to have a lot of lead time for the production of these books, and we also
like to release them in such a way that they don't compete against one
another for attention.

It would be extremely useful, therefore, if you could drop me a few lines
and let me know how things stand. No hassle, Larry, just a friendly inquiry
from an interested party.

Trust all goes well. By the way, I think the move to Texas is a good one.

Professor Bill Mann
Department of Philosophy

Dear Bill:

It was good seeing you again, albeit briefly. Already the weight of
administrative burdens is being visibly lifted from your shoulders!

With your new freedom now in sight, I hope you will consider anew the
possibility of contributing a book on the philosophy of religion to our
distinguished, successful Heritage Series.

The two introductory books we have in place -— Jim Rachels's m
Elements of Moral Philosophy and Randy Carter's The Elements of
Metaphysics -— are unquestionably the best books of their kind currently
available. We do not expect anything less of Larry Thomas's book on
political theory. Myself, I think the same would be true of a book authored
by you.

My sense is, you would like to be part of the series and, further, that you
now think you should be able to accelerate your writing plans. If you could
confirm both these matters, in writing I could approach McGraw- Hill and
discuss the possibility of having them issue a contract. For obvious

reasons, the sooner you can do this, the better.

Thanks for your time and attention. I sincerely hope we can work together
on this project.

With all good wishes,

Dear Tom:

Please ﬁnd enclosed three more chapters. It seems to me they should give
the referees enough insight into the nature of the book I have in mind so as
to make a ﬁnal jugdment. Perhapsml should add that for each chapter 2
and chapter 3 I have planned an additional section. In chapter 2, I'd like to
add a section that explains a few more technical terms, and in chapter 3, a
section on some objections to analyzing knowledge in terms of necessary
and sufﬁcient conditions. How much space should be allocated for these
sections would be a function of the overall design of the book, which is why I
would prefer to postpone writing them until a later stage in the project.

I am also enclosing a new version of the introductory chapter. I have
removed the sections on the problem of the criterion, which will be relocated
elsewhere. This chapter isn't quite complete either. Again, what I shall
add will depend on the rest of the book. Finally, I'm enclosing an updated

copy of my vita. I thought it might be helpful if McGraw-Hill is aware of my
scholarly track record.

I hope the chapters I'm submitting will meet with a favorable response,
and I look forward to receiving further news from you.

Sincerely,

Concerning Steup: Ihave read over the sample chapters again. I m to
like them. It would make our life so much easier if they were up to the
standards set by Rachels and Carter. Alas, I don't think they are. All
considered, therefore, I recommend that we cut him loose. If possible, a
gentle letter from you seems preferable.

Hope all goes well.

Dear Professor Carter:

I am writing to inquire about the status of your proposed book,
CLASSIC AND CONTEMPORARY READINGS IN METAPHYSICS, which was due
in final manuscript on June 15, 1988, according to our contract.

When can I expect to receive a table of contents (listing all

proposed selections, including specific information regarding

editions, translations, and pages to be reprinted) and three

sample chapters for preliminary review?

I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.

Thank you.

Sincerely,

Dear Tom,

I think it is time to evaluate the future of the Heritage Series,
which (except for the revision of MORAL PHILOSOPHY) seems to have
stalled with the publication of the ELEMENTS 0F METAPHYSICS.
Unless you have plans to actively pursue new authors for the

series this spring, I would like to propose that we terminate our
contract of July 15, 1985.

Please let me know your thoughts on this at your earliest

convenience.

Sincerely

Dear Cynthia:

I have been away giving lectures during our Spring break and so have only now had
a chance to read your letter of 27 February. I must say, it came as quite a surprise. I
readily admit that the anticipated pace of the series has been slow, owing largely to
potential authors (Jameson and Aiken for certain, and Thomas possibly) reneging
on their contracts, while Carter has moved at a snail's pace with his reader, and
Mann has idled along with his decision. However, I have every intention of
continuing to produce a quality series of books, and had in fact decided to spend a
large part of this summer to that end. Certainly there is nothing in the contract that
speciﬁes when new books will be added to the series, so that, by my lights, there is
no legal basis to dissolve it. So, as I say, I am not inclined to do so.

By the way, my records indicate that you were going to speak with Mann about
issuing him a contract to do the book in the philosophy of religion, but I don't find
any correspondence that speaks to this matter. Am I missing something?

The first few copy-edited chapters of MLD 3 /e have arrived. I plan to look them over
in the next few days. I must say that your letter of 27 February has taken the wind
out of my enthusiasm for this project.

Yours sincerely,

Tom Regan

Dear Karen:

It was a pleasure to meet you during my recent visit. I regret that we did not have
more time to explore our common interests, which seemed to me to be consider—
able. As the future unflolds, I hope we'll have a chance to chew the tofu (so to
speak)

My reason for writing on this occasion is to invite you to participate in what is
becoming a truly distinguished, successful series of books. Called "The Heritage
Series," Jim Rachels's The Elements of Moral Philosophy and W. R. Carter's 1116.3.
Elements of Metaphysics are the first two of what eventually will be a total of six
such texts. I enclose a copy of each for your perusal. My hops is that you will agree to
contribute a similar volume in aesthetics. (A second volume, an anthology along
the lines of Rachels's The Right Thing to Do, would accompany your The Elements
of Aesthetics).

 

The financial arrangements are reasonably good, I think: $1,000 upon signing 10%
of sales. Not enough to make you wealthy overnight, but enough to supplement a
professor's meager pay.

As for deadlines, I think we can be fairly liberal here and try, after discussing the
matter, to pick a realistic date that is satisfactory to everyone.

I should mention that Ed Martin recommended that I write to you about this
project. Knowing Ed as we both do, we also know that a recommendation from him
means something. It would mean a great deal to me if you would agree to join with
us in this excellent series of books, especially if you were to do so enthusiastically.

Wishing you well, and looking for a reply at your earliest convenience, I am,

Yours sincerely,

Tom Regan
Professor of Philosophy

Dear Cynthia:

Enclosed please find Karen Hanson's curriculum vitae. Karen is a well
known and well respected philosopher whose interests range over a
variety of topics, including aesthetics. She has indicated a strong interest
in contributing to the Heritage Series in this area, and I would welcome
her participation. Before I ask her to take the next step (which I assume

would be to develop a working "outline" of her book) I want to be
reassured that I am not misleading her. I am assuming in other words,
that the Heritage Series remains alive. I would not want to ask anyone to
do any work at this time if your view differs from mine.

Kindly let me know what your view is, at your earliest convenience.

Yours sincerely,

Tom Regan

Dear Karen:

Cythia Ward, the philosophy editor at McGraw—Hill, was very excited to
learn of your interest in contributing to the Heritage Series. What Cynthia
has asked me to ask you to do is the following. Could you (1) work—up a
tentative Table of Contents and (2) draft a sample chapter? Cynthia in turn
would send these materials out for review and, assuming a favorable
response, she would then be in a position to issue a contract. For obvious
reasons, the sooner you could do this, the better. A note from you,
indicating when we might expect these materials, would be very helpful.

One last thing. Kindly look over the Rachels and Carter books I sent you.
Your book should follow the same structure as these two (for example, the
system of numbering internal to each chapter). The actual contents are up
to you, though I would be happy to discuss various possibilities with you, if
you are so inclined.

With hopes that your children (and their mother!) are all now fully
recovered, and with keen expectations of a ﬁrst—rate book, I am,

Yours sincerely,

Dear Larry:

Well, first, welcome home! Second, congratulations on the completion of your
latest book! And third, hear the audible sighs of relief at my end upon receipt of
word that you remain committed to writing the book on political theory for the -
Heritage Series! Truly, I am very pleased to learn of your continued interest——your
eagerness, even-—for the project. I think I know something of how you feel, when
once a spiritual work (in the best sense) is behind one. I experienced a kind of clarity
and enthusiasm both during the writing and after the completion of The Case for
Animal Rights. There is no question in my mind but that your book on political

theory will be a much better book for your having worked on (and survived!) a book
on the Holcaust and American Slavery.

 

If we could receive a draft of the political theory book by 1. January 1993, this would
fit in well with the pace at which books in the Series will be appearing. So I urge you
to try your best to meet the deadline you have proposed. Just so our mutual labors
might be minimized, would you kindly look over Rachels's The Elements of Ethics
and Carter's The Elements of Metaphysics to refresh your memory about how your
book should be structured. The actual contents, of course, are up to you, but I would
be happy to discuss various possibilities with you, should you be so inclined.

Appropos this latter point, I think Cynthia Ward is very likely to want to see (1) a
proposed Table of Contents and (2) a sample chapter as soon as you can make them

available. So in terms of priorities, these are the top two.

Ending as I began-~Welcome home! Congratulations! Sigh of relief!——and wishing
you all of life's blessings in abundance, I am,

Yours sincerely,

Dear Tom:

This is to confirm in no uncertain terms my commitment to
finishing the project on political theory for McGraw-Hill. I am
deeply sorry not to have completed the project sooner. When you
initially approached me, I already had book commitment of major
importance. What made me think that I could do both is something
of a mystery to me. I am turning in the manuscript on American
Slavery and the Holocaust (listed in temporal order of occurrence)
on 16 July 1992, perhaps a day or so sooner.

I could have a draft of the manuscript on politics by 1
January 1993, probably even sooner. Indeed, writing the book
would fit in very well with my overall aims at present. I should
like to complete the project with McGraw-Hill. I should like to do
so not simply because I gave my word, though that is often a
good enough reason for doing so, but because I am presently ripe
to do so. Perhaps that is the point. I knew I would eventually
be ripe to do the book on political theory. I did not anticipate
that the ripeness would be so long in coming, given my previous
commitment. That was shortsightedness on my part, if not sheer
stupidity. One does not write a book about either the Holocaust
and American Slavery over night, let alone both.

I do hope that this renewal of commitment is acceptable to
both you and McGraw—Hill. I do sincerely apologize for any
credibility problems that I might have caused.

With all best wishes, I am

Yours truly,

Dear T011}:

I fear that this letter must come as an extreme disappointment to
you. There were my intentions, and then there has been the reality. I
truly wanted to write an introductory political theory work for you;
and I made various starts on several occasions. But these starts
inevitably sputtered. After I finished writing Vessels of Evil: American
Slavery and the Holocaust, I thought that would certainly be able to
take up the task of writing the book. But I was terribly mistaken. My
moral and philosophical interests have taken a most unexpected turn: I
now find myself terribly engrossed in issues of character development
with respect to individuals who act evil. This is perhaps
understandable given that I had just finished writing on two evil
institutions. But I am moving quite directly now to victims of abuse
and moral character.

To my surprise, issues of political theory simply do not hold an
interest for me at this juncture.

I have learnt one thing from all of this, namely never to accept,
and formalize, an invitation to write a book unless I was already
disposed to write such a book independent of the invitation. I shall
never do that again. For I never want to find myself in the very
uncomfortable position of not being able to keep my word—~-—to say
nothing of letting down someone whom I hold in high regard. I wish
that I had something more hopeful to say; but I fear that I do not. I
am truly sorry.

27 JULY 1993
TO: JERRY DWORKIN
FROM: TOM REGAN

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR FAXING YOUR
COMMUNICATION. AS YOU CORRECTLY SURMIZED,

- I NEVER RECEIVED YOUR E-MAIL MESSAGE, AND I
CAN ONLY HOPE THAT MY ATTEMPT TO REACH
YOU VIA THIS SAME MEANS PROVES TO BE MORE
SUCCESSFUL.

I AM LOOKING FOR AN INTRODUCTOY LEVEL

BOOK IN SOCIAL/ POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND AN
ACCOMPANYING ANTHOLOGY TO HELP COMPLETE
A SERIES I UNDERTOOK, FIRST WITH RANDOM
HOUSE AND THEN, WHEN RH ABANDONED ITS
COLLEGE DIVISION IN PHILOSOPHY, WITH
MCGRAW-HILL.

THE SERIES IS IN SOME WAYS PATTERNED AFTER
FAMILIAR PREDCESSORS (FOR EXAMPLE,
PRENTICE-HALL'S 'FOUNDATIONS OF PHILOSOPHY
SERIES'), BUT THERE ARE DIFFERENCES.

FIRST, I HAVE NO PLANS TO HAVE TWENTY-PLUS
SINGLE AUTHORED BOOKS; INSTEAD, I WOULD
LIKE TO HAVE JUST SIX (ON ETHICS, POLITICAL
PHILOSOPHY, PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION, THEORY

. OF KNOWLEDGE, AESTHETICS, AND
METAPHYSICS). SECOND, EACH OF THE AUTHORS
OF THESE BOOKS ALSO IS BEING ASKED TO
COMPILE A COMPANION READER, AN ANTHOLOGY
THAT CAN BE USED EITHER IN CONCERT WITH OR
INDEPENDENTLY OF THE SINGLE-AUTHORED
INTRODUCTION.

BY WAY OF EXAMPLE: JIM RACHELS HAS WRITTEN
THE ELEMENTS OF MORAL PHILOSOPHY AND
EDITED THE ANTHOLOGY THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
MANY INSTRUCTORS USE BOTH BOOKS IN THEIR
COURSES. SOME USE ONE BUT NOT THE OTHER.
THE SALES OF BOTH (HAPPILY) ARE BRISK.

WHEN THIS PART OF THE SERIES IS COMPLETED, I
WOULD LIKE TO DO TWO FURTHER THINGS: FIRST,
CREATE AN ANTHOLOGY BASED ON THE SIX
SINGLE—AUTHORED TEXTS, TO SERVE AS A KIND OF
JOINT-VENTURE GENERAL INTRODUCTION TO
PHILOSOPHY; AND SECOND, TO TAKE THE BEST OF
THE WORKS ANTHOLOGIZED IN THE SIX

Professor Paul Churchill

George Washington University
801 22nd Street NW.
Washington, DC. 20052

Dear Paul:

I was delighted to learn that you would be interested in considering being a
part of McGraw Hill's Heritage Series, for which I serve as the series
editor. So far Jim Rachels and W.R. Carter have produced The Elements of
Ethics and The Elements of Metaphysics respectively. And Bill Mann
(Vermont) and Karen Hanson (Indiana) have agreed to submit proposals
for (again, respectively) texts in the philosophy of religion and aesthetics.

In your case, what we would like is a book in political / social philosophy. In
terms of length and struture, it should be modelled after the books by
Rachels and Carter (copies enclosed), and, like these two, it should be
pitched to an undergraduate readership. But as for topics, that really is up
to authors to decide. I would only say that Jim, I think, had a good way of
thinking about topics for his book. He asked himself, "What is it, minimally,
that every student should know about moral theory, and what real world
problems help bring the stuff of theory alive?” By my lights, this seems a
good way to think about a book of the sort you would be writing.

We also ask contributors to do a second book —- a companion reader (along
the lines of Rachels's The Right Thing to Do, copy enclosed). This should
mainly parallel the single—author text, but there is room for divergence;
the two books, our experience tells us, often are used together, but just as
often not. Royalties from sales of both books can be significant (authors
receive 10% of net sales, if my memory serves me well). And there is also a
nice piece of change (I think it's $1,000) authors would get just for writing
their books.
