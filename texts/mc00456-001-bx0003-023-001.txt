TO FIGHT CRUELTY

Some of the cruelties the Animal Defence Society
ﬁghts:

Killing animals by knife alone.

Sheep killed by old method of knife
alone.*

 

Horrors of the Bull-Fight.

Creatures tormented for amusement
—the final fate of- a horse, maybe once a favourite.

 

 

* The Slaughter of Animals Act (England), 1955, does not satisfy the reasonable demand of supporters of slaughter reform for a
law enforcing humane methods of slaughtering all animals killed for food. It makes obligatory the use of a mechanically-operated
Humane Killer for the purpose of stunning cattle prior to slaughter. Even this limited protective measure is not uniformly applicable,
but exempts the considerable number of animals killed by the Jewish method dating from the primitive age in which Moses laid down
regulations for the conduct of his people. Sheep are also left out of the Act, and (with the exception of the areas under the jurisdiction
of the Local Councils which have adopted the Resolution enforcing the humane method of slaughter), these animals are still
killed by the old-fashioned method, i.e., by the knife alone. The sticking method, whether of sheep or pigs, has been generally
condemned by all experts, except those who have a direct interest in maintaining or defending the old methods of slaughter. Pigs
are equally left out of the Act, except in places where a supply of electrical energy is available, when the Act makes obligatory the
application of an electric current for purposes of inducing unconsciousness prior to the use of the knife.

Sold for slaughter, or to work in the mines,
etc.

A mule sold by the British Army in 1919.
Bought by the Duchess de Croy out of pity in
1927. It was just a living skeleton and suffered
from anchylosis in all four legs. In order to
move, it had to jump like a kangaroo. In this
state it worked all day long in the ﬁelds. As it
was unable to get up once it laid down, its cruel
owner, to prevent this, put it into very short
harness. It was in such intense pain that the
ﬁrst thing it did on arriving was to throw itself
down on the ground.

 

 

 

Brutality of the steel-toothed
trap.
A Rabbit’s Agony.

It is estimated by competent authorities
that about 40,000,000 rabbits are sent to
the market each year. Large numbers of
these meet their death by the torture of the
steel/toothed trap . . . a rabbit is caught by
a leg in the teeth of a trap and held fast
in agony, for anything from 12 to 24 hours,
unless it manages to escape through the
leg being severed.

The Animal Defence and Anti-Vivisection Society

was founded in London in 1906 and works strenuously to suppress cruelty in every form and to create a spirit of
mercy and justice in the treatment of animals. It carries on a vigorous campaign to reform the methods of slaughter
and transport, to end the horrors of the steel trap and the fur trafﬁc, to abolish vivisection, and generally to awaken
feeling and understanding in regard to the treatment of animals. The inﬂuence of the Society is worldwide. It
stands for the principle that the cause of humanity to animals is not a side/issue but a vital part of Civilisation and
Social Development. The Society, therefore, seeks to introduce humane education in every school. The Society’s
active campaigns for legislative reform are carried out by means of meetings, lectures, extensive distribution of

publications, Press publicity, international Congresses, exhibitions, demonstrations, etc.

The Society: Organised a Deputation, supported by over 1,400 Animal Protection Societies, to the President ofthe
Conference for the Reduction and Limitation of Armaments in Geneva, emphasising the importance of humane education
and animal protection as civilising inﬂuences in the furtherance of international peace. Built a Model Humane Abattoir
at Letchworth. Organised demonstration of Humane Slaughter in London, Letchworth, Paris, Geneva, and other towns.
Maintains permanent Humane Exhibitions in London and Geneva. Organised the Sections relating to the protection
of animals in the Lord Mayor’s Processions through London in 1929 and 1930. Maintains two motor caravans for
purposes of education and agitation. Organised, during the European War, veterinary hospitals for sick and wounded
horses of the French Army under the authority of the French War Office. Maintained for some years a shop in
Piccadilly, London, for making known the facts about Vivisection. Has published numerous articles by medical men and
women against Vivisection. Has organised great International Congresses and initiated vigorous Parliamentary Campaigns.
Through its International Humanitarian Bureau in Geneva the Society maintains friendly relations with animal protection
societies throughout the world, provides information and promotes international cooperation.
