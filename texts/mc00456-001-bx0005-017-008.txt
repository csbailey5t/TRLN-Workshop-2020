IMPORTANT NOTICE

DEEDS OF COVENANT

In the accompanying Report will be found
a reference to Deeds of Covenant. We should
like to correct the impression which appears
to be in the minds of so many people that the
Budget of 1946 put an end to this method of
subscribing to charities. This is not so. The
position of charities under these Deeds or

Seven Year Agreements was not affected.

 




P.D.S.A.

l4, Clifford Street, London, W.1.

During the past six years the Nation’s energies have
been devoted to conditions arising out of the War; and a
great demand has been made on the charitable Public for
the support of the many War~time Charities, which now,
having in many instances fulﬁlled their object, no longer
eXIst.

The Voluntary Hospitals too, will no doubt before
long, be absorbed into the new National Health Scheme
and therefore no longer be dependent upon voluntary
support.

When considering your charitable bequests in the
light of the above facts, will you remember The People’s
Dispensary for Sick Animals of the Poor Y—for this work
is supported entirely by Voluntary Contributions, and a
vast ﬁeld of labour awaits us in the future.

It is unnecessary to stress the enormous amount of
Animal Suffering we relieve, or the far~reaching effects of
our educational methods for the P.D.S.A.

Should you wish to grant a Legacy for the P.D.S.A.
for its work in the future, the following'objects are greatly
in need of support: —-

GENERAL PURPOSES.
FOUNDING OR MAINTAINING A DISPENSARY.
PURCHASING OR MAINTAINING A CARAVAN DISPENSARY.
