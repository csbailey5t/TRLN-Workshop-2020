ASPCA employees continue to enjoy other
beneﬁts such as group life insurance, a pen-
sion plan and health insurance. Our far-
sighted employee program is an investment
for animals, our primary concern as a humane
organization. For only by attracting and
keeping the highest caliber staff can we offer
animals the best possible care.

Of our 250 employees, 65 have been with
us ten years or more. Seventeen have reached
the quarter century mark, and one, Inspector
William Ryan, celebrated 51 years of con-
tinuous ASPCA service on July 8. His color-
ful experiences during a lifetime of service
to animals will be the subject of a book called
“Fifty Years in the Doghouse.” McCall’s
magazine has purchased ﬁrst serial rights

for a 10,000-word article next January. The
book itself, to be published by G. P. Put-
nam’s Sons, will reach the stands about the
same time.

In recognition of outstanding achievements

where animals are concerned, we present the
following awards:

Our Medal of Honor, accompanied by a
Certiﬁcate of Merit, goes to a person who
has performed an heroic service for animals
or to an animal that has rescued a person.
Recipients this year included a tugboat cap-
tain who rescued a deer on an ice ﬂoe in the
Hudson River, and ﬁve men who saved 32
horses trapped in a two-alarm stable ﬁre in
the Bronx.

parrot squawk, “Hello, baby.”

The program is especially popular with
disturbed and handicapped children, who
enjoy the program perhaps even more than
normal youngsters. Blind and deaf children,

In addition, they receive ASPCA periodicals

refreshments and entertainment, with parti-

CﬁNYRmBYEQNS

Several contributions were received during
the year to help alleviate pain and suffering
and to help cure the ills of animals. The
gifts, from members and contributors basic-
ally interested in the study of animal dis-
eases, include a new X-ray machine costing
$10,850; an anesthesia room table at $185;
an operating room lamp costing $1,285; and
an entire X-ray developing room costing
$1,300.

Dog cages were endowed for $250 and cat
cages for $150. Appropriate plaques were
placed on or near the gift to identify the
donor. We enthusiastically welcome addi-
tional support from members and friends.

81%? F

On the hospital staff are a director, 13
veterinarians, 10 attendants, a tissue techni-
cian, a clinical laboratory technician, an
X-ray technician, a surgical nurse, a night
supervisor, night nurse, kennel foreman and
10 ofﬁce workers. A hospital administrator,
with more than two decades of experience in
the ﬁeld, was appointed this year.

Our veterinary staff is active in the pro-
fession, contributing their ﬁndings to others
and keeping abreast of new information in
the ﬁeld. They attend professional meetings,
present technical papers at local, state and
national meetings and publish papers in vet-
erinary journals and other professional pub-
lications.

Weekly seminars are held for the regular
staff, visiting veterinarians and allied scien-

28

tists, who hear talks by physicians, private
veterinarians, research workers and members
of our staff. This exchange contributes to
better patient care.

The internship program inaugurated in
1960 continues to give young veterinarians
a formal course in post-graduate training.
This year we have two interns.

FAQMHES

The hospital’s facilities include two sur-
gery suites, six examining rooms, a treatment
room, a dispensary, a radiology department,
a contagious disease ward, and a pathology
department. The pathology section supplies
valuable information, through blood counts,
blood chemistries, urinalyses, fecal examina-
tions and bacteriological tests, to our doctors
to help them diagnose an animal patient’s
ailments and prescribe proper treatment. In
tissue pathology tissues are removed from
surgical patients or from diseased animals,
and the specimens are examined by the path-
ologist to determine the nature and cause
of disease.

Animals suffering from contagious diseases
such as canine hepatitis, canine distemper
and feline enteritis, are isolated in a special
ward to prevent the spread of these diseases
to other hospitalized patients. Separated from
the rest of the hospital, the Daynemouth
Ward was made possible by a donor whose
particular interest is the control of commu-
nicable disease. We prevent the spread of
infection in this ward with ultra-violet light-
ing, exhaust fans, steam cleaning, anti-bac-
teria and anti-virus sprays, sterilized feeding
dishes, etc.

HGSPETAL HOURS

Clinic hours are from 9 a.m. to 12 noon,
and 1 p.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Satur-
day, except holidays. There is emergency
service evenings from 4 to 7, and Sundays
and holidays from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. There is
no outpatient service from 7 p.m. to 9 a.m.

Volunteer Activities

In 1950 the ASPCA began a volunteer
division which, under the direction of Mrs.
George Hayman, has steadily expanded into
an integral part of the Society. It now com-
prises 60 or 70 dedicated volunteers who
have raised' many thousands of dollars
through various special activities for the

ASPCA’s Adoption Service Clinic.

The committee includes an active Men’s
Division under the chairmanship of Walter
S. Mack. Assistant Co-Chairmen are Gilbert
H. Wehmann and Victor A. Lambert.

The Adoption Service Clinic, supported
wholly by funds raised by the volunteers,
entitles owners of animals adopted from the
ASPCA to the chance to secure a healthy
and companionable pet. These animals are
entitled to a free examination in the ASPCA
Hospital and Clinic and a free inoculation
against communicable diseases.

Shelters
Outside
New York City

The ASPCA operates three shelters out-
side New York City. Two are in Nassau
County, Long Island—one in Glen Cove,
the other in Long Beach. The third is in
Westchester County in Elmsford.

We were invited into these neighboring
communities several years ago. In all three
communities we are under contract to local
governments.

0 In Long Beach we serve only that city.

0 In Glen Cove, besides our contract with
that city, we also have contracts to service

nearby Sea Cliff, East Hills and Bayville.

0 In Elmsford, while we do not service
this town itself, we have contracts with Irv-
ington, Mount Pleasant, Tarrytown, North
Tarrytown, Hastings-on-Hudson and Dobbs
Ferry.

In all these areas we are responsible for
picking up any unleashed dog, whether li-
censed or unlicensed, if it is off its owner’s
premises. There is a boarding fee for animals
not called for within 24 hours.

Penalties for allowing a dog to run loose
vary because of differing laws. Some com-
munities exact ﬁnes as well as redemption
fees. In some instances ﬁnes are collected by
the police; in others we Collect the penalties
and turn them over to the local government.
The money never goes to the ASPCA.

ﬁﬂﬂiﬁﬁ SERWCﬁg
The three shelters also offer other humane
activities:

0 We call for unwanted animals on re-
quest from homes in the areas where we
have contracts for a $1 fee. '

22

0 We call for dead animals for a $5 fee.

0 We accept unwanted animals at the
shelters for adoption or to be put to sleep,
regardless of where the animal comes from.

0 We ﬁnd homes for the homeless through
our adoption service.

0 We rescue pets in distress as well as
wild animals. Our Glen Cove staff, for exam-
ple, helped pull a three-year-old polo pony
out of a well, while one of our men in Elms-
ford was called on to handle three swarms
of bees, one swarm estimated to consist of
3,500 bees, on tree branches in Tarrytown.

Preventing
Cruelty

Preventing cruelty is, of course, a basic
function of a humane society, and we are
proud of our stepped-up activities in this
area. Initial steps were taken last year to
expand the Humane Work Division, which
investigates cases of cruelty and inspects
poultry markets, bridle paths, stables, cir-
cuses, pet shops, horse shows and other places
where animals are kept in numbers.

When our expansion started in 1962 we
had one supervisor to run an office, take
telephone calls, write up complaints and cover
all New York City and three adjacent coun-
ties with six uniformed agents. Today our
Humane Work Division is comprised of a

director, a deputy, an assistant, a clerk, two "

inspectors and 15 uniformed agents.

iNSFECTiQNS

With this increased staff we were able to
make 13,564 inspections of animal establish-
ments during the year. This was 4,755 more
than the previous year. More than a million
animals were observed or checked during
the inspections.

 

 




 

Animals are examined in order of their
arrival in the reception room. Of course,
emergencies are taken ﬁrst. To avoid wait-
ing, appointments may be made in advance
for an added fee.

We realize owners are anxious when their
pets are hospitalized. To make it easier to
ﬁnd out a pet’s progress, we set aside two
hours a day, between 2 p.m. and 4.4. p.m.,
when an owner can call and inquire about
the patient. Each veterinarian has a tele-
phone hour daily when owners can talk di-
rectly with him. Staﬁ members are not per-
mitted to prescribe over the telephone.

Bacteriological test is made in the Pathology Laboratory.

 

MGH? EMERGENCY SSRWCE

Our veterinarians participate in the night
emergency service sponsored by the Veter-
inary Medical Association of New York City.
We rotate turns of night duty with other
veterinary hospitals to provide emergency
service for pet owners in Manhattan, Bronx,
Brooklyn and Queens from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m.
every day. Owners who dial OR 9-1964 will
be given the name and telephone number of
a veterinarian on duty in the city that night.
The number should be called only in an
emergency.

Individual children under 18 may join the
Society as Junior Members for $1. These
children are encouraged to try for a Junior
Achievement Award, which is made after 50
hours of service in one year helping conduct
the tours, walking the classroom dog, feeding
the animals, etc. Six children received the

 

award this year. Several youngsters planning
to become veterinarians have been getting
an'early start on their future by participating
in this program after school.

Seventy-ﬁve thousand pieces of educational
literature were distributed during the year
—-— free to public schools and at cost to the
general public. The booklets, ranging in
price from 5¢ to 35¢, include the very pop-
ular That New Puppy, Your Dog and His
Care and Cats and Their Care. The last two
are given free to people who adopt animals
from the ASPCA. Bookmarks on the care of
the dog, turtle, cat, hamster, guinea pig,
horse, mice, rat, rabbit, ﬁsh and parakeet
are available for 5¢ each.

Last year 560 schools, pet clubs, civic
groups and other humane societies borrowed
our educational ﬁlms and showed them to
nearly 20,000 Viewers.

@ET snows

The Society sponsored or assisted with 64
pet shows, an increasingly popular activity
of civic and youth organizations. Our staff
acted as judges for many of these shows and
presented awards for the best-cared-for pets.

Our staff gave 52 lectures and demonstra-

representatives from all over the world at
the International Conference on Humane Edu-

An obedient, well-trained dog is welcome
almost everywhere. Dogs, like children, can
be trained to obey, as our obedience classes
have proved. Since 1944 we have taught good
manners to well over 19,000 dogs in our
Manhattan and Bronx classes. Dogs and
owners are always trained together—the
theory being that we teach you to train your
dog. The fee is $18 for dog and owner for
eight weekly lessons, and there is always a
long waiting list. In addition to helping
owners gain control over unruly dogs, and
thereby increasing the family’s enjoyment of
their pet, our classes are performing a public
service by preventing bad-mannered dogs
from becoming a hazard in trafﬁc, a nuisance
to landlords and an annoyance to neighbors.

Laboratory
Inspecﬁons

The ASPCA recognizes that animals are
needed for medical research. The knowledge
gained from research beneﬁts animals as
well as man. But we are also extremely con-
cerned with the proper care of these lab-
oratory animals.

Since the Metcalf-Hatch Law was passed
in 1952, and the ASPCA became subject to
requisition of animals by licensed laborato-
ries in New York City, we have inspected
all laboratories that take animals from us.

Last year Mrs. Maclay set up a fund in
memory of her husband. The fund’s income

This horsemanship trophy is open to young
riders at non-recognized shows throughout
the country. Shows may hold this class free

the junior who accumulates the most points
in competition in the Henry Bergh Class in
various shows. The trophy itself is donated
to the Society. This year’s silver tray was
donated by Mr. and Mrs. T. F. Gussenhoven.
The winner was eleven-year-old Geri Mag-
giolo, one of the youngest to win the award.

Since 1956 we have offered a $300 veter-
inary scholarship at Cornell University. The
scholarship goes to a fourth-year veterinary
student chosen by the faculty on the basis of
need, scholarship and general competence.
It has been made possible by Secor Farms
Riding Academy, which has contributed to
us the proceeds of its annual horse show, to
continue the scholarships through 1964. This
year’s recipient is Harvey Rhein.

This sterling silver plaque and cash award

The
ASPCA

Dollar

To provide the varied and extensive ser-
vices outlined in this report the ASPCA
spent $1,882,823.97 during the ﬁscal year
1962-1963. This was $224,193.60 more than
our income.

Fifty-ﬁve cents out of every dollar spent
went toward the shelter operation required
of us by the dog license law.

Fortunately, just as the ASPCA dollar had
stretched almost to the snapping point, the
New York State Legislature increased the
dog license fee from $3 to $5, effective May
1, 1963. This was too late to affect our in-
come for the year covered in this report, but
we believe the increase will put our shelter
work on a self-supporting basis next year.

Hfﬁﬁg‘éﬁifﬁﬁ {Eff $H§§§T§§§E

 

No part of the dog license fee is used to
pay for our hospital, humane education, in-
spections, investigations of cruelty, prosecu-

 

tions, animal rescues, horse watering or
adoptions. These services depend on ﬁnancial
support from our members and friends. If
we hope to continue the dynamic progress
made during the last year, we will need even
more support. New members are especially
welcome. Contributors who prefer to support

one of our services may give to our Horse
Care Fund, Hospital Fund, Adoption Fund,
Humane Work Fund, Humane Education
Fund, Motor Vehicle Fund or General Fund.
Gifts of securities and property are welcome.
All are tax deductible.

A Boy’s Friend

Dogs have a deﬁnite therapeutic value in
making good citizens from underprivileged
youngsters at a Catholic school for boys in
upper Westchester County. In an article in
a recent issue of the New York Times a
representative of IOO-year-old Lincoln Hall
describes the integral part dogs play in re-
habilitating boys assigned to the school by
New York State courts.

Every one of the eleven brick cottages has
two grown dogs. “When a boy comes here
a dog is likely to be his ﬁrst friend,” said
Brother Gregory, prefect of one of the
cottages. The dog is useful as a stepping-
stone to group living and remains a constant
interest all the time the boy remains. Each
cottage is proud of its two dogs and I guess
they are the best fed and best groomed dogs
in the county.”

In addition to the dogs there are two
saddle horses, one of them a former hunter.
They are part of the recreation program, al-
though never used in competition. Like the
dogs, the horses have been donated.

“They have good homes and good veterin-
ary care ever after they are donated,”
Brother Gregory is quoted as saying.

The Times says the dogs include pure-
breds of several breeds, but purebred or not,
the boys and their dogs are loyal to each
other.

Friendly George,
The Fun-Loving Lion

George, billed as a “friendly, fun-loving”
lion from Lancaster, Pa., got a less than
friendly reception in New York City. He
wound up at the ASPCA’s Manhattan Shelter
after police spotted him in his cage on the
back of a pick up truck on 30th Street and
Fifth Avenue.

Police arrested the owner, Lawrence Bene-
dict, for violating the law requiring proper
safeguards to protect the public from Wild
animals.

“He’s not a wild animal,” Benedict said.
“He’s Friendly George.” To prove his point,
he pointed to a sign on the cage that said,
“George the Friendly, Fun-loving Lion.”
Benedict added that he kept George in front
of his Lancaster car wash to boost business.

Benedict was sent to Night Court and the
lion to the ASPCA. The judge dismissed the
case and the next morning Benedict and his
friendly 400-pound lion were reunited at the
shelter. The owner said he was taking George
right back to Lancaster, presumably friend-
lier to lions than New York.

For nearly a century The American Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has
cared for lost, unwanted, sick and mistreated
animals. Last year more than a million and
a half animals came under our scrutiny . . .
the puppy abandoned on the street, the horse
performing at a horse show, the guinea pig
used for research in a laboratory . . . the cat
with a broken leg . . . and the lion behind
circus bars.

The sick were treated in our hospital. The
homeless were placed. The abandoned were
cared for in our eight shelters. The mistreated
were protected from abuse. Animals traveling
into or out of New York by plane were tended
at our Animalport.

As we approach our second century of
guarding the welfare of New York’s animals,
I invite you to review the work of the last
year— a year of Vigorous expansion and
renewed dedication to the principles that in
1866 prompted Henry Bergh to found the
ASPCA, the ﬁrst humane society in the
Western Hemisphere.

While the law does not give any humane
organization the right to inspect laboratories,
every laboratory requisitioning animals from
us has readily agreed to the inspections.

By agreement with the New York State
Society for Medical Research, the ASPCA
may withhold animals from any institution
failing to live up to our strict standards for
a balanced diet, well-lighted, well-ventilated
and clean wards, adequate quarters, consid-
erate attention, sufﬁcient exercise and proper
anesthesia and post-operative care for sur-
gical patients.

During the year we inspected 32 labora-
tories certiﬁed by the Department of Health
as eligible to requisition animals from the

ASPCA.

This year there was a giant forward step
in our inspection program. Because of the
quality and character of our inspections, 31
laboratories that have never applied for per-
mission to receive our animals have invited
us to inspect their facilities and help them
in the proper care and treatment of animals.
By fall 1963, when these laboratories have
been added to our inspection list, we will be
inspecting all the institutions approved by
the New York City Department of Health
for animal research. The ASPCA is the only
humane organization in the world perform-
ing such a well-organized service.

Our active and dedicated Volunteer Com-
mittee conducted a calendar of events that
netted a total of $18,685. Of this amount
$13,709 helped sustain the Hospital’s Adop-
tion Service Clinic, which offers a free exam-
ination to animals adopted from the ASPCA.
Almost $5,000 was earmarked for our in-
spection and investigation work.

F und-raising events included the Animal
Kingdom Ball and the Ark, a shop selling
quality items like silver, glass and jewelry,
donated by members and friends. The shop
operates for one week early in December in
a store donated for the purpose. Donated
merchandise is tax deductible.

In Long Island funds were raised at a
tea-dance called Carnival for Animals. In
Westchester committee members put on a
fund-raising mail campaign among their

friends and neighbors. The Society’s Horse

Care Fund reaped proceeds from our sale of
tickets for a performance at the National

Horse Show.

The ASPCA has embarked on a campaign
for better care of caged birds in chain store
pet departments and in pet shops throughout
New York City. Untrained personnel in
chain and variety stores make them a par-
ticular target for our educational program.

One feature of the campaign is a nine-point
recommendation on bird care passed out to
about 500 pet shops and pet departments by
our Special Agents. The directive lists do’s

4. Birds need adequate ventilation, but
should not be placed in drafts, in direct
strong sunlight, nor close to direct artiﬁcial
light.

5. For one or two small birds such as
parakeets or canaries, a rectangular cage 14”
long by 10" wide by 12” high, provides an

adequate minimum amount of space.

6. The number of parakeets in a ﬂight

we can reveal that two and
a half times more dogs than
cats were adopted from
ASPCA shelters last year.
Of the 23,077 animals
placed, there were 6,000

walk. The agent immediately drove the ani-
mal to our Staten Island shelter, Where he
hoped to feed it. When he put the dog on
the floor, it just lay down and died. In court
the judge sentenced the owner to 90 days in
jail or a $50 ﬁne. He warned her never to
own a pet again. In another case a man
accused of stomping a cat to death was sent
to jail for ﬁve days.

A total of 5,641 cases of alleged cruelty
were investigated. Most were corrected with
a warning. Fifty-ﬁve were brought into court
and 47 convictions were secured.

We know that many cases of cruelty are
not intentional, but stem from lack of knowl-
edge of animal needs. Therefore, we are now
coupling our investigation and inspection
program with an educational one, concen-
trating mainly on pet shops in department
and novelty stores, where there is a huge
turnover in personnel.

As part of this program we prepared a
mimeographed list of recommendations for
the care of caged birds and ﬁsh. The city’s
more than 500 pet shops were visited in per-
son and asked to post the list for the use of
employees.

Before Easter our agents visited every pet
shop to remind owners of the law prohibit-
ing the sale of less than six chicks to a cus-
tomer. When the law was passed, it was
assumed that anyone purchasing more than
six chicks would use them for breeding and
not as toys for children. Despite the warning,
six shop owners were issued summonses for
violating the law. Fines imposed by the
courts ranged from $10 to $20.

Among the major accomplishments this
year is a clariﬁcation of schooling procedures
at horse shows. Following a conference with
ofﬁcials of the American Horse Shows Asso-
ciation, schooling of horse-s is concentrated
in a single area, making it easier for our
agents to supervise the activity. The show

24

managements must now supply any school-
ing poles used. The poles must be bamboo,
not rattan, and must not exceed two inches
in diameter.

Some years ago the ASPCA compiled a
booklet containing all laws in New York
State and New York City relating to animals.
Since laws are constantly changing and new
ones are added every year, the booklet must
be revised frequently. This year the Humane
Work Division brought out the ﬁfth edition
—— a 76-page edition of up-to-the-minute legal
information on animals.

 

While most ASPCA activities are conﬁned
to New York City and vicinity, our anti-
cruelty work encompasses the entire state. In
addition to the 15 full-time agents who de-
vote most of their time to work in the city,
we also have 13 volunteer agents throughout
the state. Last winter with the help of one of

these agents we prosecuted a man and woman ,

in Saugerties, New York, for neglecting 24
horses stabled in their care. Six of the horses
had starved to death. In court the judge re-
leased the couple with a suspended sentence,
but the owner of the horses was ﬁned $100.

This summer we also checked on a number
of horses that went out of New York City to
summer camps and ranches.

 

Egg ﬁﬁﬁg

The shocking abuse of horses in the mid-
nineteenth century led Henry Bergh to found
the ASPCA in 1866, when New York’s horse
population numbered several hundred thou-
sand. Although only about 1500 horses (in-
cluding police, saddle, work and hansom-cab
horses) remain in the city today, we have
not relaxed our vigilance in their behalf.

This year our 50-year-old red horse ambu-
lance was completely reconditioned and re-
ﬁtted with a new cab-over-engine tilt-top
tractor.

It rolls out of its garage to transport sick
and injured horses about once a month. One

 

 




 

 

 

Our men are constantly alert for the health
and welfare of animals. For example, our
agents are present at every rehearsal and
performance of a circus appearing in and
around New York City. This Vigilance was
even extended to the animals’ food when an
agent noticed maggots on the meat about to
be fed to the lions and tigers in one circus.
He immediately reported the tainted food to
the circus veterinarian, and the meat was

discarded at once. All meat from then on
was refrigerated.

We always welcome calls from anyone who
suspects a cruel act is being perpetrated, and
we investigate every report. Most cases re-
ported to us involve animals kept outdoors
inbad weather without food or water. Some
of these reports are unfounded, but in one
instance, on a tip from a neighbor, we found

backyard. The dog was so weak it couldn’t

The ASPCA has handled the dog license
work in New York City since 1894, when
the New York State Legislature empowered
the Society to collect the fees. In return, the
law stipulated that the fees be used for pick-
ing up lost, strayed or abandoned animals
and maintaining shelters for their care.

Early in 1963 the New York State Legis-
lature increased the New York City dog
license fee from $3 to $5. This ﬁrst increase
since 1950 went into effect on May 1, 1963,
after the close of our ﬁscal year. The ASPCA
requested the increase because we had been
steadily losing money on the license opera-
tion since 1956. To make up the deﬁcit each
year we were forced to drain the funds con-
tributed speciﬁcally for our other humani-
tarian and charitable work, such as the hos-
pital, investigation of cruelty and humane
education. The aggregate deﬁcit in the li-
cense operation since 1956 reached nearly
one million dollars.

While the ﬁscal year covered in this report
does not reﬂect the increase, we expect the
new fee to eliminate for at least the present

a continuation of the deﬁcit in this phase of
our work.

use rs s: se

 

The law stipulates that license fees be used
for:

1. Issuing licenses and renewals.

2. Carrying out all other provisions of the
dog license law (supplying tags, notifying
dog owners when to renew licenses, returning
lost dogs to owners, paying inspectors’ sal-
aries, and for clerical work, etc.).

3. Collecting unlicensed dogs (and stray
cats which do not wear a collar with the
name and address of the owner).

4. Maintaining shelters in New York City
for lost, strayed or homeless animals. All ani-
mals must be kept for a minimum of 48
hours before destruction, but if they have

16

been requisitioned by laboratories for exper-
imental purposes under the provisions of the
Metcalf-Hatch Law, they must be held for
an additional three days.

5. Providing a painless death for animals
not redeemed by their owners or adopted by
new owners.

Under the law every dog in New York
City must be licensed, regardless of age.
From the moment a puppy is born until it
dies it requires a license, which is renew-
able each year before April 30.

Licenses are $5 and can be obtained in
person or by mail from the ASPCA ofﬁce
in the borough where the owner lives. Appli-
cations by mail should contain the name,
address and telephone number of the owner,
plus the name, age, breed, sex, color and
markings of the dog, and should be accom-
panied by a check or money order for $5
payable to the ASPCA. An ASPCA fund
helps pay for licenses for indigents who can-
not afford the fee.

The ASPCA does not collect license fees
outside New York City.

Owners who have not licensed their dogs
may be summoned before a magistrate and
ﬁned up to $10. If an unlicensed dog is
picked up on the street, the owner must pay
a $3 redemption fee, plus the $5 license.

The Society has 25 uniformed license ofﬁ-
cers who enforce the law. Each ofﬁcer is as-
signed to one area in the city. He Visits
residential buildings in his area to make cer-
tain every dog living there has a license. In
addition, owners are reminded by mail early
in March that licenses must be renewed by

April 30.

found a new home through our Adoption
Service.

 




 

 

 

 

One day last spring police converged on a
small dog wandering forlornly on Manhat-
tan’s West Side. A dog answering the little
fellow’s description had been the object of a
week-long search for biting a policeman and
a boy. Police captured the terrier after a
chase in which the dog fell into an excava-
tion, broke his leg and cut his tongue. He
was brought to the ASPCA, where our doc-
tors immediately set the fracture and treated
the tongue.

Despite this sad beginning, the story had
a happy ending—thanks to a license tag
the dog wore on his collar when captured.
The ASPCA traced the owner through the
tag and telephoned her at once to say her
dog had been found. The 72-year-old widow
declared her dog had scooted out of the
house and disappeared that morning. Ac-
cording to the evidence, it was impossible
for Lucky to have bitten anyone the week
before.

It was a case of mistaken identity and
Lucky was exonerated of all blame in the
bite cases. After recuperating for several
weeks in our hospital, he went home to his
overjoyed owner.

This heart-warming happy reunion was
one of more than 5,000 at ASPCA shelters
last year—accomplished because most of
the lost dogs were found wearing license tags.

Preventing Cruelty

On August 13 the ASPCA learned that a
New York fair had scheduled a 100-mile
endurance race for August 26. We moved
immediately to stop the event and on August
20 fair officials called off the attempt to
break a 110-year-old record of under nine
hours.

The event was cancelled after the Society
had served a Supreme Court order in Nassau
County court to show cause why the event
should not be forbidden. Two days before a
scheduled court hearing Long Island Fair
officials requested a meeting with the Society.
At the meeting Alvin Wei], a director of the
fair, said the event would be cancelled in
deference to the ASPCA’s conviction that
harm might be done to the animal.

This was swift action obtained by a ﬁrm
and resolute stand. The case is another ex-
ample of the ASPCA’s continuing emphasis
on preventing cruelty to animals before it
starts and indicates the tremendous force the

Society wields for the good of animals.

For instance, when a cat got stuck in a
concrete ﬂoor under a restaurant, our man
balanced precariously on a ladder amid pipe-
work in the basement and hacked a hole in
the ceiling. When three puppies chasing a
kitten got caught between two buildings, it
took an ASPCA man three hours to pound a
hole in a brick wall to free them. On a 90-
degree day last summer two dogs got trapped
in soft tar dumped in a lot. Three ASPCA
rescue experts worked gently for hours to
pry them loose. Cats up trees are old hat by
now, and it’s routine to haul them down with
a special pole resembling a grocer’s grab

stick invented by an ASPCA agent years ago.

What happens to an animal whose owner
goes to prison or a hospital, or dies, and
leaves no one to care for his pet? ASPCA’s
Medical Stray Ward, which last year cared
for 2,334 animals, is the answer. This year,
for instance, when police raided a bookie
hangout and hauled several men off to jail,
the ASPCA was called in to take away three
Dobermann pinschers guarding the place.
Often we must care for an animal for months,
or even years, until the owner recovers, gets

One day last spring we answered a call
from a Staten Island woman who reported
that a big strange bird was clinging to her
screen door and refused to ﬂy away. The
bird turned out to be a stuffed peacock nailed
there by a prankster. But other wild animals
turn out to be all too real.

One was a three-foot-long blacksnake
wrapped around a ﬁfth-ﬂoor ﬁre escape in
the Bronx. Another was an 18-inch alligator
that slithered under a car in Queens. We
chased a snarling, snapping raccoon on the
lower East Side and ﬁnally cornered it when
it took refuge in a tree. Our men brought in
two sleek, black seals that tied up rush-hour

20

trafﬁc on a Bronx expressway by standing at
attention in the middle of the road.

We also handled chinchillas, foxes, ham-
sters, ocelots, marmosets, monkeys and an
iguana. Birds, too, including a heron, macaw,
robins, bluejays, cranes and parrots.

Some exotic animals stowaway on banana
boats. Others escape from zoos, and still
others come into New York City with owners
who are unaware that wild animals are not
permitted. Many, like opossum in Staten
Island, venture out of their forest homes in
New York’s outlying areas and become be-
wildered city visitors. Rescued from the haz-
ards of civilization, they are turned over to
zoos or released to freedom in their natural
habitat.

While a New York City law requires that
all animals accused of biting must be exam-
ined by a veterinarian, the ASPCA has no
jurisdiction in these cases. They are handled
by the New York City Department of Health.

But the ASPCA does provide the Depart-
ment of Health with free space in our ﬁve
borough shelters for examining animals ac-
cused of biting. We also provide facilities for
housing animals the Department decides to
hold for observation. Last year 36,551 ani-
mals were examined by Health Department
veterinarians in ASPCA shelters, and 5,458

animals were held for observation.

BEAVERS—nature’s flood control experts

(Continued from Page 9)

to the beaver pond or lodge.

The beaver not only works and plays in
the water, he lives in it. Out in the middle
of his pond he builds himself a ﬁve-by 20-
foot one-room apartment out of thick sticks
plastered with mud. There’s a small chimney
on top for ventilation and an entrance tunnel
under the surface.

The beaver diet consists of tree bark, but
during severe winter frosts not even the
beaver’s chisel teeth can saw through trees
frozen in their own sap. With the foresight
of a housewife who puts up blueberry jam
in July for delicious feasting at Christmas,
the beaver works overtime in the fall cach-
ing green branches in the mud at the bottom
of the pool below the frost line. When the
surface freezes he takes a quick swim from
his lodge to his stockpile and floats home
the family-lunch.

Although beavers keep actors’ hours—
you rarely see one working after 7 a.m.—
they are a model family. They mate for life
and are among nature’s best parents. Firm,
but not harsh, discipline is the rule in teach-
ing the youngsters the family business of
cutting trees, gathering food, learning to
swim and building dams. Beavers live ten or
twelve years in the wild, up to 19 years in
the less demanding life of captivity.

Largest rodent in North America

The beaver is a rodent, so classiﬁed be-
cause of his gnawing teeth. He’s the largest
rodent in the Northern Hemisphere. The
only larger rodent is the capybara of South
America. A full-grown beaver weighs a good
30 to 50 pounds, and an extra large one
may tip the scales at a hundred pounds.
From the tip of his nose to the end of his
powerful dragging tail he measures three or
four feet and never stops growing. Fossilized
remains of his Ice Age cousin indicate a
creature nine feet tall, weighing 500 pounds,
and with teeth four inches long.

10

Not even a duck is better made for life in
the water. His immense lung capacity en-
ables him to swim a quarter of a mile under
water in 15 minutes without coming up for
air. His webbed feet propel him along at
remarkable speeds. His small ears and nose
have valves that close under water. Even his
mouth is specially designed so water doesn’t
rush in when he’s carrying branches under
the surface. His loose lips can be drawn in
tight behind his front teeth to seal his mouth.

The notion that he carries freight on his
broad, scaly tail or uses it as a trowel is a
pretty myth. Actually it serves as a rudder,
helping him steer a straight course even
when weighed down with a heavy load.

A beaver emerging from the water is a
spectacle of dripping mess and exaggerated
waddle that rivals anything on the beach at
Coney Island. But the fastidious swimmer
soon combs out the knots with the split nail
nature has provided on one toe of each hind-
foot.

The beaver has learned to adjust to the
changing face of the land. If his dam is
chopped down, he’ll build it again. Divert
his brook and he’ll set up shop somewhere
else.

In 1960 authorities in a Maine town
waged a Two Months’ War with a family of
beavers that built a dam on a creek near the
town road, The dam ﬂooded 100 feet of
road. Crews tore the dam apart ten times.
The game warden dropped oil soaked rags
over the dam. The beavers used the rags for
ﬁller. The warden set traps. The beavers
used them in extending the dam. Local police
dynamited the dam. The beavers rebuilt it.
But after two months they fell for box traps
and the townspeople rejoiced when they were
carted off to a distant wilderness. But their
joy was short lived. Three months later
another family showed up and started the
whole thing again. I




 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

him. Through our adoption service a family
with a four-acre home in Mahopac, New
York, opened its heart and welcomed the
horse as a family pet.

 

The Special Adoption Service helps those
looking for a speciﬁc animal. But many
people prefer a mixed breed—just a ﬂuffy
ball of fur to round out their family. For
them the adoption procedure is even simpler.
A wide variety of animals for adoption is
available at all. ASPCA shelters from 9 a.m.
to 4:30 pm. daily, except Sundays and
holidays.

 

Although we take every reasonable precau-
tion to guard the health of an adopted animal,
we can’t guarantee that it does not harbor a
disease. So each adopted animal is entitled
to a free examination and one serum inocu-
lation against communicable diseases. We
urge owners to take advantage of this service
at the ASPCA Hospital on the day of adop-
tion. But if that’s impossible, owners may
bring a pet in within one week after adop-
tion, any day, except Saturday, Sunday, or
a holiday. We also offer free advice and a
booklet on the care of the new pet.

We are distressed that many people, par-
ticularly those who adopt animals in bor-
oughs other than Manhattan, are not taking
advantage of our free examination. About
three percent of our adopted animals are
being returned because of sickness. If it is
inconvenient for owners in other boroughs
to bring animals to our hospital in Manhat-
tan, we strongly urge them to seek the advice
of a local veterinarian at their own expense.

 

MEEMN§ SF AE§§§E§
ANNALS

To prevent the birth of unwanted puppies
and kittens, we recommend that adopted
male and female cats and female dogs be
altered. If the surgery is done in our hos-

32

pital, the Society will bear all hospital costs
(except the surgical charge) up to the time
the doctor recommends that the animal be
discharged. The costs which are included
free cover hospitalization, examination, en-
trance, drug and inoculation fees.
Application for the alteration surgery must
be made within two weeks after adoption.
However, since some animals are too young
for this surgery at the time of adoption, we
give owners four months after application
in which to take advantage of this service.

SQNi‘mUWGNS WELCOME

Free adoptions, free examinations and the
spaying service are possible because the adop-
tion service is one of several ASPCA activi-
ties paid for by contributions. We are always
grateful to anyone giving a home to one of
our orphans who makes a contribution to-
ward the care of others still unchosen. Other-
wise we couldn’t afford the extra effort we
make to ﬁnd the right home for the right

animal.

Although we welcome this expansion of
our inspection program, we must ﬁnd a way
to ﬁnance it. We are now seeking means to
underwrite the program privately.

National attention has been directed to
our laboratory inspections and to our eﬁorts
to help train or furnish training materials
to laboratory animal attendants. During the
year one of our ofﬁcers was invited to discuss
our program with the Board of Directors of
the National Society for Medical Research.
We were also invited to send a representative
to a conference at the University of Michigan
on the housing and care of animals in re-
search laboratories.

FEEERM. LEGESLAHQN

We pioneered with our program for the
humane care and treatment of laboratory
animals eleven years ago. Now it has become
a national concern. This year seven bills on
the subject were introduced in the United
States Congress. We were asked to review
the texts of these bills, and our hope is that
before too long a uniﬁed effort can be made
to support a single bill containing the best
features of each.

THE MEYCALFwﬁAiﬁﬁ LAW

The Metcalf—Hatch Law, passed by the
New York State Legislature in 1952, permits
laboratories and hospitals approved by the
State Commissioner of Health, or if in New
York City by the City Commissioner of
Health to requisition animals for experimen-
tal purposes from public pounds and private
humane organizations to which public au-
thority has been delegated by statute or
contract.

The ASPCA falls under the provisions of

the law because:

1. Its authority to operate is granted by
the New York State Legislature.

2. It is empowered by the New York State

Legislature to issue dog licenses and carry

38

itmiiigii"

out the obligations imposed in the dog license

law in New York City.

Challenged in the courts, the constitution-
ality of the law was upheld by the Court of
Appeals on July 14, 1954.

 

 

Animals subject to requisition must be un-
licensed, unwanted or unclaimed, unless the
owner of a licensed dog or other animal
offers it in writing for experimentation.

Under a previous law public pounds and
humane organizations were required to hold
any unlicensed, unwanted or unclaimed ani-
mal for 48 hours. Under the Metcalf-Hatch
Law each animal must be held for an addi-
tional three days, during which the animal
may be reclaimed by its owner or adopted.

If the animal is then allocated to a labora-
tory or hospital, the humane organization or

pound is reimbursed a reasonable amount

ASPCA Prevents 'lOO-Mile Trot

The ASPCA’s ﬁrm stand against cruelty
caused cancellation of an attempt to break
a IlO-year-old world record for trotting a
horse 100 miles. The Long Island Fair,
which had scheduled the event for August
26, called off the race against time in defer-
ence to the ﬁrm conviction of ASPCA ex-
perts that harm might be done to the animal.

A ﬁve-year-old stallion, Hempt Hanover,
had been scheduled to try to break the record
of 8 hours 58 minutes and 53 seconds set

in 1853.

On August 13 the Society received a
phone tip that the endurance race would be
held as a feature of the Fair at Roosevelt
Raceway. The following day an announce-
ment to that effect appeared in the news-
papers. We immediately checked with horse-
men and veterinarians to establish whether
the exhibition would be cruel to the horse.
Opinion was unanimous and conﬁrmed our
own belief: it would.

We resolved to move quickly to stop it.
On August I6 we explained our concern to
Long Island Fair ofﬁcials and asked them to
cancel the event. We felt it only right to
give the Fair time to announce cancellation.
Told the event would go on, we gathered
afﬁdavits and proceeded through the Supreme
Court in Nassau County and a date for a
hearing was set for August 22.

Director of Humane Work Edmond M.
Rowan stated the Society’s position: “This
Society believes the proposed exhibition of
trying to trot a horse one hundred miles in
something less than nine hours would con-
stitute an act of cruelty to the animal. Our
belief in this matter is fortiﬁed by that of
veterinarians and other persons in the horse
world.

“We have moved now on this problem
through the civil courts because this so-
called exhibition has been advertised and we
want ample time given for notiﬁcation that

it is to be called off. More important, how-
ever, is the fact that we place major em-
phasis on being a society for the prevention
of cruetly to animals rather than just a so-

c1ety for stopping such cruelty once it gets
under way.”

The ASPCA’s position received wide press

ccverage.

Fair ofﬁcials then requested a meeting
which was set for August 20. Alvin Weil,
President of Roosevelt Raceway and a direc-
tor of the Long Island Fair, represented the
Fair. Mr. Weil said the record attempt was
originally planned after consultation with
experts in the ﬁeld and in the belief that no
harm might be done the animal. However,
he said the Fair ofﬁcials fully understood
the ASPCA’s position and agreed to cancel
the event. This was after the Society had
served a Supreme Court order to show cause
why the event should not be forbidden. In
light of the agreement to cancel the event the

ASPCA dropped its legal proceedings.

istration ofﬁces. Our red-brick Bronx Shelter
was erected in 1956 to replace an old out-
moded building. The Queens Shelter, in a
picturesque, rustic setting, includes a 100-
year-old farmhouse that serves as an adoption
ward. Three other buildings house the ken-
nels, license ofﬁce and garage. Our Brooklyn
Shelter, which cared for more than 47,000
animals last year, handles more animals than
any other single shelter in the country. The
vine-covered Richmond Shelter is known to
every resident on Staten Island.

 

A cherished pet becomes too old or hope-
lessly ill. A family is moving and can’t take
the pet along to the new home. An unwanted
litter of kittens becomes a burden. In all
these cases the ASPCA stands ready to help.
All our shelters accept any animal brought
in any time of day or night at no charge.
Our fleet of ambulances also calls at homes
for unwanted animals. A $1 fee is charged
for each call for unlicensed dogs, cats, birds
or any other animal. Licensed dogs in the
ﬁve boroughs are called for at no charge.
The animals are then put up for adoption or
painlessly put to sleep, according to the
owner’s request.

Our ambulances answered 80,613 calls for
unwanted animals during the year, an aver-
age of about 220 a day. Almost 44,000 ani-
mals were brought to the shelters by owners.

We also call for a pet that has died. The
fee is $5.

géﬁﬁéﬁtﬁtfﬁiﬁ

Last year we put to sleep 119,386 animals.
Many of these unfortunate animals were in
ill health or were too old to be accepted into
new homes. The majority —— 87,057 were put
to sleep at the request of their owners.

Putting animals to sleep is an unpleasant
but necessary duty of any humane organiza-
tion. In the performance of this duty the
ASPCA has tried all methods and in 1950

came to the conclusion that the high altitude

18

chamber was the quickest, safest, most hu-
mane and most efﬁcient method yet developed
for taking the lives of large numbers of ani-
mals. Many humane societies throughout the
country agree, and similar installations are
used by them.

In an unremittant effort better to discharge
our most unwelcome responsibility the Society
beneﬁts from studies by scientists and by re-
search done by those who manufacture or
market equipment or devices for the taking
of life. Each new method or improvement as
it appears on the market is studied and eval-
ulated carefully and professionally for the
ASPCA to make certain the most modern,
acceptable euthanasia equipment obtainable
— regardless of cost —— is used.

We constantly round up abandoned and
homeless animals on the streets. We are alert
when new demolition projects are announced.
We post signs in the area requesting old
tenants not to abandon unwanted animals
when they move, but to bring them to our
shelter or ask us to call for them. The Society
participates actively on the Citizens Com-
mittee to Keep New York City Clean, with
special emphasis on picking up stray animals
in spotlighted problem areas.

Last year 32,962 stray and abandoned
animals were rescued from streets and build-
ings. We answer emergency calls any time
of day or night.

Animals have a knack for getting into
tight places . . . and ASPCA men have the
know-how to get them out. Armed with lad-
ders, poles, axes and chisels, at least once a
day they rescue an animal trapped some-
where in the city.

Kittens born under ﬂoorboards in a hard-
ware store are rescued.

Humane
Slaughter of

Food Animals

During the last several years the ASPCA
has been working with the New York State
Humane Association to get a law passed mak-
ing it compulsory to slaughter food animals
humanely in New York State.

Since the New York State Humane Asso-
ciation represents most of the state’s humane
groups, we felt we would have a far better
chance of achieving our goal if we presented
a strong front and showed unity within the
humane movement. Thus far this campaign
has been unsuccessful. But next year we
expect to increase our efforts to insure a
humane death for the millions of animals
slaughtered in New York State for food pur-
poses annually.

We must outlaw such cruel practices as
that in which a fully conscious animal is
shackled, thrown and hoisted by a chain
biting cruelly into one hind leg, and then
left to dangle in agony, suffering unbeliev-
able pain while waiting for a knife to end
its misery.

«g g g g: g: g g g? E... Lﬁiigégﬁﬁ

 

A federal humane slaughter law in effect
since 1960 applies only to meat packers sell-
ing meat either directly or indirectly to the
federal government, about ten percent of the
nation’s packers. While this law has accom-
plished much and covers 90 percent of the
meat purchased in the country, several thou-
sand small packers do not sell to the United
States government and thus are not forced
to install humane slaughter methods unless
covered by state laws.

Fifteen states now have humane slaughter
laws. They are California, Connecticut, Flor-
ida, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachu-
setts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire,
Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washing-
ton and Wisconsin. New York State must try
again next year. For until there is a law in
every state making humane slaughter man-
datory, millions of animals will endure need-
less suffering.

The ASPCA is attacking the problem of
humane slaughter on two fronts. In one as-
sault, we are campaigning for compulsory
leaislation. At the same time we are offering
an award for development and use of new
means for humanely killing food animals.
The award is the James Hopkins Award,
made possible by a trust fund left to the
Society by the late James Hopkins, who des-
ignated that it be used speciﬁcally to recog-
nize outstanding improvements in humane
slaughter methods. The sterling silver plaque
and cash award have been presented ﬁve
times.

BEAVERS

 

reported to headquarterS4—x“B’eavers are aw-
ful. They built dams by switch here. Every
morning we spend hours breaking beaver
dams before we can get to work. If we don’t
they ﬂood the tracks. We made a waterwheel
and tied tin cans to it to scare them away.
They shoved a pole into the wheel and stopped
it. We left a lantern burning all night and
they covered it. We built a culvert under
their dam and they plugged it. I built a wire
fence to keep them away. They cut down my
poles and used the wire on their dams. What
do you suggest?”

Nature’s ﬂood control expert, the beaver,
is indeed stubborn, ingenious and frequently
a nuisance. But conservationists say he more
than pays his debt to mankind by irrigating
crops and controlling ﬂoods. Historians also
credit him with helping colonize the Ameri-
can continent. Canada put him on her ﬁrst
postage stamp.

The amazing creature combines the skills
of a woodsman, engineer, carpenter, store-
keeper and underwater swimmer. Indians
called him “little man of the woods.”

Beaver dams store water during rain for
drought periods. Out west many farmers

a riﬂe. Hudson Bay blankets are still
marked with four short stripes, the
price in beaver skins, a reminder of
the days when beaver was king.

By 1800 white trappers had wiped
them out in New England, and trad-
ing ﬁrms like Hudson’s Bay and
John Jacob Astor penetrated deeper
into the wilderness to ﬁnd more
plentiful supplies. The remote trad-
ing posts later became ﬂourishing
cities.

Beaver pelts wound up in men’s
hats, known as castors or beavers.
The tall, fuzzy monstrosity lasted
until the 19th century when an
Italian invented the silk hat an
French stylists adopted it.

The demand for beaver pelts hit the skids,
but was later revived with the beaver coat
vogue.

By the turn of the twentieth century the
beaver population had thinned almost to the
vanishing point. One story credits an Indian
trapper named Grey Owl with spurring the
government to protect the fast-disappearing
species. The tale has it that for years Grey
Owl indiscriminately trapped beavers him-
self. But one day in 1927 he killed a mother
and father beaver and adopted their two
orphans which he named McGuinnis and
McGinty. The pair captured his heart and
he devoted the rest of his life to lecturing
and writing books on preserving beavers. On
one lecture tour he was summoned to a com-
mand performance at Buckingham Palace
for George VI, the then Princess Elizabeth
and Princess Margaret.

The United States and Canada eventually
passed protective laws, and the beaver was
reintroduced into many of his old haunts.

Dams irrigate crops

Beaver colonies have been planted from
Florida to Alaska and from Newfoundland to
Northern Mexico. In remote areas of the
West the US. Fish and Wildlife Service has
parachuted beavers to the headwaters of
creeks and rivers about to overﬂow their
banks. In California where they were intro-
duced into an intermittent stream they built
their dams and prevented spring runoff water
from rushing downstream all at once and
being lost. Now the stream runs all year and
the adjacent meadows are green with lush
grass for cattle.

In 1954 a drought in farmland turned the
area around New York’s Bear Mountain
State Park into a miniture Dust Bowl. But
the park itself remained a green oasis be-
cause of water supplies backed up by 20
beaver colonies.

A dramatic story of water conservation
occurred in Colorado. During a drought year
some resourceful residents thought of using
water impounded by beavers some distance
away. They built irrigation ditches along

dry stream beds and opened upstream beaver
dams. The water rushed into the ditches and
on one stream alone crops valued at more
than $15,000 were saved.

The original aquanaut, the burly beaver
loves the water, and if there’s no pond handy
for his swimming pool, he builds his own

with the skill of an M.I.T. graduate.

Family cooperates on proiects

Building a dam is a highly organized
family enterprise: the parents out the trees
with an assist from the “teenagers.” They
work in turns while one stands guard. When
the tree starts to crack, someone gives the
“timber” warning and everybody scampers
out of the way.

With his powerful, yellow chisel-teeth, a
beaver can fell a four-inch thick tree in 15
minutes. Some have cut through trees ﬁve
feet across and over a hundred feet tall.

The tree bark is peeled off for food and
the rest is chopped into convenient lengths
for use in the family home or the dam. The
chisel teeth then rest while the webbed feet
take over, and the woodchopper becomes the
swimmer. Propelling himself in the water at
the rate of two miles an hour, the beaver
hauls his load of timber to the selected con-
struction site. He carefully lays the branches
side by side facing the current and weights
them with mud and rocks. He heaps layer
on layer and tops the whole off with a coat
of mud.

Beaver dams last for years. Some are 300
feet long and contain a hundred tons of
material. The average is four or ﬁve feet
high and may hold back thousands of tons
of water. The record dam is believed to be
one in Montana—2,140 feet long.

Ingenious canals for freight

Even more remarkable than the dams are
beaver canals, which are often forked or
branched and have locks made by building
up a low dam to raise the water level. The
canals, sometimes as long as 1,000 feet,
serve the same purpose as our canals—to
transport freight too heavy to drag overland

ASPCA

BY GEORGE BJOTVEDT, V.M.D.

Since 1952 the ASPCA has been inspect-
ing New York laboratories which use live
animals for experimentation. These inspec-
tions are unannounced and unlimited. We
were the ﬁrst—and are still—the only
humane organization in the United States
carrying on such a program.

No law gives the Society this authority.
A voluntary arrangement with the institu-
tions inspected, it is an outgrowth of the
Metcalf-Hatch Law, a New York State law,
which permits laboratories, authorized by
the Department of Health, to requisition
animals from the ASPCA or any humane
society accepting public funds. For some time
inspections included only laboratories which
secured animals from the Society—never
more than 32. This program, conducted by
ASPCA veterinarians, met with such success
that our advice and counsel on the care of
animals and the physical construction of
animal quarters was requested by other
laboratories that had never requisitioned an
animal from us. The result is that now we
have been invited to inspect 31 such labo-
ratories, bringing the total number welcom-
ing our inspectors to 63.

Financial problem

Doubling the number of research facilities
to be inspected—to say nothing of almost
certain further expansion—— presents more
than a problem of increased deﬁcit ﬁnancing
to the ASPCA and its hospital administra-
tion. Good veterinarians are hard to come by,
but veterinarians qualiﬁed and willing to
specialize in the new ﬁeld of laboratory ani-
mal care are almost non-existent. Despite the
fact that space is at a premium, we must
have quarters for twice as many professionals,
at least one secretary, and more ﬁles and

About The Author

Dr. Bjotvedt is a Veterinary Inspector
of Laboratories for the ASPCA. Graduated
as a Bachelor of Science from Pennsyl-
vania Military College, 1951, and Doctor
of Veterinary Medicine from the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania, 1958, he remained
at the university until 1962 as Research
Fellow and Assistant Curator of the Ani-
mal Colony of Wistar Institute. He later
became Director of the Division of Labor-
atory Animal Medicine and eventually an
Instructor at the School of Veterinary
Medicine.

Dr. Bjotvedt has written many scientiﬁc
papers for medical publications and be-
longs to a half-dozen professional organi-
zations, including the National Society for
Medical Research, of which he is a Coun-
cil Member. At 34 he is particularly dedi-
cated to the care of laboratory animals,
specializing in Laboratory Animal Path-
ology.

 

 

 

library space. We have long foreseen sure
but steady expansion of the inspection pro-
gram, but the explosive demands of the last
month and a half had not been expected.
The ASPCA nevertheless must ﬁnd a way to
meet the new responsibilities, which present
strong indorsement of service rendered. It is
gratifying to note how attractive the Society’s
program is to a scientiﬁc community not
known to welcome restraints imposed or even

sought by humane societies. Perhaps our

program has been well received because the
ASPCA is proving that our concern is neither
for nor against animal experimentation, but
rather with the environment and care of
animals subject to such experimentation.
There is no set time for a visit nor is every
laboratory inspected the same number of
times. If something occurs that doesn’t meas-
ure up to our standards, for instance, we
may go back three times in as many weeks,
to see that the situation has been remedied.
Inspections are never routine. When our

 

 

 

 




 

of its passengers was a truck horse injured
in a collision with a car on the Harlem River
Bridge. The MOO-pound dapple gray was
taken to the ASPCA Hospital, where sutures
were taken in a laceration in its side.

During the summer our two horse water-
ing trucks provided free refreshing drinks
for the city’s hot thirsty horses. Our other
horse services include weekly checks of work

    

horses in their stables (77,746 checks last
year), inspection of bridle paths and riding
academies to prevent abuse to saddle horses,
coverage of every recognized horse show in
New York State within 65 miles of New York
City and spot checks of New York City race
tracks. When the Yonkers Raceway racing

\season ran into a cold, snowy spell this win-

ter, our agents were on hand to keep close
tabs on the horses.

President William Rockefeller and Inspector William Ryan recommission 50-year-old
horse ambulance, which is back in service after thorough reconditioning.

In 1958 we opened the Animalport at
New York International Airport to feed,
clean, water and exercise animals entering
or leaving the country by air with a stopover
in New York. During the past few years
airlines have been ﬂying more and more live
cargo. Frequently there are layovers between
flights. Ordinary baggage can wait until it’s
called for, but living creatures have to be
fed and cared for.

The wisdom of our decision to build the
ﬁrst shelter in the. Western Hemisphere cat-
ering exclusively to animal air travelers is
demonstrated by the fact that this facility, at
one of the world’s busiest airports, handled
nearly 115,000 animals during the year. This
was more than double the number cared for
the previous year, and brought the grand
total since the opening to almost a third of
a million animals.

1 13 NFFERENT $§Em§$§

Our two—story beige brick" shelter cared
for four new species this year, bringing our
total of different walking, ﬂying and slither-
ing species to 118. There was a three-quar-
ter-ton hippopotamus bound for a midwest-
ern zoo; an aardvark, an animal resembling
a pig; a ranagoliath, a rare type of frog
weighing 15 pounds and measuring six feet
in length; and a pair of rare mountain goril-
las valued at $24,000 and weighing 150
pounds each. The pair were on their way
from Nairobi, Africa, to a zoo in Oklahoma
City.

The exotic animals imported from Asia,
Africa and Europe by zoos and dealers re-
quire specialized attention. But sometimes
ordinary species like pigs can tax the in-
genuity of our experienced handlers even
more. For example, last spring 135 pigs
from Illinois bound for Brazil arrived with-
out notice while the indoor paddocks were
full of horses. Accustomed to handling emer-
gencies, our staff put the pigs in an outdoor
paddock where they were particularly proud
of the nice ﬁeld of grass they had cultivated.

Within an hour the pigs had uprooted the
whole lawn.

FACiUTiES

Dogs, cats and other small animals are
housed in individual kennels with adjoining
outdoor runs. There are 12 box stalls for
horses that can be converted into a large
indoor corral for farm animals. Horses are
exercised in a spacious outdoor paddock.

There is a temperature-controlled section
for tropical birds and animals, isolation
cages for the sick and injured, a fully-
equipped veterinary clinic, indoor and out-
door loading areas and a dietary kitchen
with a freezer and an electric stove. Diets
prepared in this kitchen range from live
meal worms for foxes to bamboo roots for
pandas, raw meat for lions and alfalfa for
elephants. Rates vary according to the type
of animal.

Humane
Educaﬂon

Children who have developed an under-
standing of animals grow into more compas-
sionate, responsible adults. We place great
emphasis on teaching children kindness to
animals because we believe it can have far-
reaching effects.

QWLSREN

City children, who otherwise have no
chance to cuddle a kitten or make friends
with a puppy, are invited to our menagerie-
classroom where they discover the wonderful
world of animals.

Last year about 18,000 youngsters in school
classes, with more than 1,000 teachers, Vis-
ited the ASPCA hospital and shelter free of
charge. They saw a ﬁlm in the classroom and
participated in a discussion on animal care,
including demonstrations with a live dog
showing how to brush and comb a pet. Best

Our Bread and Butter

Most families depend on a steady income
to pay for basic living expenses. Rent, elec-
tricity bills, food and insurance are budgeted
out of regular income like salaries, annuities
and interest.

Extra income, like a birthday check, an
extra stock dividend, or a once-in-a-lifetime,
unexpected legacy, helps pay for the extras
of life, the unforeseen emergencies and little
luxuries.

The ASPCA, too, lives on two sources of
income. Contributions are our “extras.” They
help pay for a campaign for humane slaugh-
ter legislation, new ambulances or an X-ray
room for the hospital.

But memberships are our source of steady
income. Members’ dues are used for the
everyday expenses involved in running a
humane society with nine shelters, a hospital,
a ﬂeet of 50-some ambulances and a staff of
250. Members are our bread and butter.

If you are a contributor and wish to be-
come an ASPCA member, please use the
enclosed envelope. If you are already a mem-
ber, an extra contribution now will help pay
for an extra service for animals.

Do you know of a friend who would
like to support the ASPCA as a member?
Please send us his name and address.
We’ll be happy to mail him a copy of

this report and a membership application.

CHRISTMAS CARD PROJECT
TO BENEFIT ASPCA

Before you order your cards for
Christmas 1963, we want you to know
about a special collection of greeting
cards and informals now being planned
to beneﬁt the ASPCA.

A choice of at least a dozen appeal-
ing subjects, featuring dogs, cats and
horses, will be offered. We plan to mail
a small illustrated catalog showing the
various subjects to our members and
friends by early October. A convenient
order form will be enclosed.

A grant toward developing this proj-
ect has been pledged by a friend of the
ASPCA. The cards will be offered at a
popular price in units of 25 of any one
subject. All proﬁt received from the
project will go to the Society.

After Christmas we hope to offer
some or all of the same subjects in
informal notepaper.

If you haven’t ordered your Christ-
mas cards for 1963, wait for our bro-
chure. You’ll be glad you did.

veterinarian goes into a laboratory he meets
the scientist using the animals for research
-— not just the caretaker. Because of similar
training they meet on 'a common professional
basis, sharing a Wide area of specialized
knowledge on animal care, treatment and
optimum environmental conditions. This
leads to a cooperative effort, rather than a
disciplinary approach. For example, several
research institutions have requested and re-
ceived ASPCA’S professional assistance in
constructing laboratory care facilities—fa-
cilitities designed to provide maximum com-
fort for the animals. Professional guidance
has also been given to laboratories in animal
nutrition, specialized care of operated ani-
mals, disease diagnosis, vermin control, pr0per
cage washing and other animal needs.

Teaching program

In addition, the laboratory animal inspec-
tion program actively supports teaching pro-
grams for personnel employed in the routine
care of experimental animals. It is the So-
ciety’s deep conviction — born of experience
——- that enlightened animal handlers are the
best safeguard in providing humane care.

For more than a decade the ASPCA has
been accumulating a body of knowledge on
humane care and treatment of laboratory
animals. Our inspection program stands
alone, but it covers only the New York
metropolitan area.

The obvious potential of ASPCA’s inspec-
tion program as a training source has not
yet been adequately utilized. It is not far
fetched to visualize the ASPCA as a focal
point for widespread training of those who
function in laboratory animal centers. The
knowledge and experience of the Society’s
specialists are always available for this pur-
pose.

While ASPCA takes pride in our laboratory
animal inspection program. We do not see
its scope conﬁned solely to our speciﬁc area
of concern. ASPCA’s pioneering work has
shown the way. Where the prevention of
cruelty to animals is concerned, there should
be no geographic limits.

 

 

Edward I. Metcalf, ASPCA’s new Director of Public
Relations.

Edward I. Metcalf Named
Director of Public Relations

Edward I. Metcalf has been appointed
ASPCA’s Director of Public Relations. Mr.
Metcalf joined the ASPCA family July 10
as an Administrative Assistant and for the
last two months has been accelerated through
the Society’s Management Training Pro-
gram. He brought 10 years of executive
public relations experience to the ASPCA.
His last position was in the Public Relations
Department of Ethyl Corporation.

Mr. Metcalf was born and raised in Ober-
lin, Ohio. He served in the Army Air Force
in World War II and subsequently was grad-
uated from Amherst College, Amherst,
Massachusetts, in 1948. A resident of Brook-
lyn Heights, he lives with his Wife and two
small children.

Mr. Metcalf takes over duties formerly
performed by June Eliot, who is now Direc-
tor of Publications and Programs. She will
be in charge of all the Society’s special
events, as well as its publications.

 




 

 

 

 

 

A WA QE 3%: WQE

If an owner can’t bring his animal to the
hospital, we will send an ambulance. Ambu-
lance service is available 24 hours a day.
The fee ranges from $5 to $12 dependin!Dr on
the distance from the Hospital.

Although our veterinarians do not make
house calls, we did fracture that rule this
year to make one house call—or rather a
circus call. The patient was an ailing ele-
phant appearing with a’ circus at the Colis-
seum. The 11-year-old pachyderm seemed to
be having difficulty breathino. She was
pushed over on her side so our veterinarian
could climb on her stomach and reach into
her nose. Circus boys had to grab her trunk
to keep it from swinging while the doctor
made his diagnosis. He found a growth the
size of a prune blocking her breathing pas-
sage, and he decided to operate. He gave
the two-ton elephant a local anesthetic, cut
out the growth and cauterized the wound.
Twenty minutes later the animal drank water,
and that evening went back in the lineup
without missing a performance. The growth
was examined in our pathology laboratory
and found to be malignant.

CANSER RESEARQH

Since cancer strikes animals as well as
humans, we are cooperating in cancer stud-
ies with Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer
Research, St. Luke’s Hospital, New York
Hospital at Cornell University and other al-
lied institutions. Many animals have been
made more comfortable and have had their
lives prolonged with several investigational
drugs now being used on clinical cases termed
incurable.

Homes for
the Homeless

Finding homes for homeless animals is
one of our most exciting and rewarding re-
sponsibilities. Each year for the past ten
years we have set a new high in animals
adopted from ASPCA shelters. And this year
is no exception. A record 23,077 dogs, cats
and other animals were placed. in new homes.
Animals may be adopted free of charge from
any of our eight shelters.

SWECEM, A WEN ﬁg WSE

Our Special Adoption Service, inaugurated
in 1961, continues its highly successful efforts
to encourage adoptions. The service is de-
signed to ﬁll requests from people who have
their hearts set on adopting a specific breed
of dog or cat. The Special Adoption Clerk,
on duty at the Manhattan Shelter weekdays
from 1 pm. to 5 p.m., accepts requests for
anything from a Siamese cat to a Great Dane.
She checks incoming animals at each shelter
every day and notiﬁes the family if and
when their heart’s desire comes in. Some-
times it takes a while to ‘ﬁnd the choice,
because, of course, we can ﬁll requests only
from the animals turned over to us for
adoption.

Dogs and cats aren’t the only homeless
animals crossing our threshhold. This year,
for instance, we found a home for a ten-year-
old chestnut horse with soulful brown eyes.
When the horse’s owner died, his family

Personnel

To serve the people and animals in a city
as big as New York, where some 275,000
animals cross our doorstep each year, ’re-
quires a large-scale operation. Our nine shel-
ters must be equipped to care for a varied
and transient population. We must keep some
60 cars and ambulances rolling. But most
important — we must have a competent staff,
not only to care for animals, but to supervise

our activities, administer our funds and solve
daily problems.

 

Last year because of our expansion pro-
gram, retirements and several prolonged ill-
nesses, we suddenly found ourselves short of
personnel, particularly in supervisory and
executive spots. We immediately set out to
remedy the situation with a four-point pro-
gram: a Personnel Department, a manage-
ment training program, educational aid for
employees, and a thorough study of the
Society’s salary and wage structure. On May
1, 1963, we increased wages to provide more
realistic starting salaries, a more logical sal-
ary progression and better consideration for
long-time employees.

During the year we established a Personnel
Department to help our staff advance to their
maximum capabilities. A modern, business-
like system for keeping employee records—
including commendations, awards and other
qualiﬁcations—will prove valuable when
considering a person’s advancement. This
department is busy laying plans for our peo-
ple, always in terms of helping them to
improve their situations.

 

Our policy is to promote from within. But
because of our broad expansion, we found it
impossible in some cases to ﬁll from our
ranks all the new positions in the second and

40

   
   
    
 

third tiers of management. So last year we
established a management training program
to provide a reservoir of broadly-trained em-
ployees to ﬁll future supervisory and execu-
tive vacancies.

Known as Administrative Assistants, the
men, who may come from the present staff
or from outside the organization, take an
on-the-spot, six-month course in the Society’s
operations. In the ﬁrst four months they go
from division to division, as well as to all
the shelters and the Animalport. The last two
months are spent in the department where
they have shown the most aptitude and where
ASPCA’s needs are greatest. Nine Adminis-
trative Assistants have already gone through
the training program.

Because we were faced with the problem
of quickly ﬁlling a number of important jobs,
we couldn’t rely exclusively (as do most
training programs) on taking young men
fresh out of college. We had to recruit some
mature and experienced men to ﬁll current
vacancies. Some are former Army officers
whose schooling in discipline and handling
of personnel is coupled with other unusual
attributes.

Employees without college degrees or even
high school diplomas are by no means pre-
vented from moving up the ladder. Many
supervisory jobs will continue to be ﬁlled by
people whose skills depend little on formal
education. But top management in all organ-
izations as big and complex as ours requires
broad and sometimes technical or profes-
sional training. Therefore, in the fourth step
in our new personnel program, we are offer-
ing every employee a chance to get such
training and a chance for advancement.

If an employee wishes to enroll in a course
at school or college in his free time, and if
the Society feels the course will help him in
his ASPCA work or in rounding out his for-
mal education, we will reimburse all the
tuition if he gets an A, or one half for a B.

    
   

 




 

 

 

 

 

When a dog plunges from a fourth-ﬂoor
window . . . or a curious kitten swallows rat
poison . . . or a parakeet suddenly stops
eating . . . his owner thinks ﬁrst of the
ASPCA Hospital. And this is as it should be.
For our hospital’s slogan is “No animal in
need of care is ever turned away” even
though an owner can’t afford to pay.

Last year we treated 29,189 clinic pa-
tients. We admitted an additional 4,433 for
care in the hospital, bringing our total to
33,622 patients. This was about 300 more
than the previous year.

”Wig: alarm“?

While we do not expect our hospital—
any more than the usual hospital for humans
——to provide needed services on a break-
even basis, we are distressed to report a
$170,550 deﬁcit in this activity for the year,

roughly $15,000 more than it was the year
before.

The volume of free work, because the hos-
pital is becoming so renowned, is increasing
daily and contributed $73,000 to the deﬁcit.
Nevertheless, our policy will always be to
treat the patient ﬁrst and worry about pay-
ment later.

We spent $11,000 to treat 2,176 animals
whose owners were institutionalized or died,
leaving no family to care for their animals.

THE OLD RED AMBULANCE ISN’T WHAT IT USED TO BE

 

The ASPCA’s big red horse ambulance has been a familiar sight on the
streets of New York and at circuses, rodeos and horse shows at Madison
Square Garden since the days of World War I. The 26-foot vehicle was
completely reconditioned this year and ﬁtted with a new cab-over-engine
tilt-top tractor and an electrically-operated stretcher for hauling in an
animal t00 injured to walk up the ramp.

The old ambulance has undergone many changes since it went into
service in 1914. Some of them are shown on these pages.

It once took two full days to drive this electrically powered vehicle from Philadelphia- to New York.
The batteries had to be recharged every few hours. “
