THE Loss.
The damage, according to the estimate of
Insurance Loss Adjuster E. T. McDonald, who

1 Was at the ﬁre from the time of the ﬁrst alarm,
will amount to more than $1,000,000. Of this

amount the Belt Line Company loses about
$700, 000. The rest of the loss is scatter (1

eighty—two companies.”

advised the Park Commissioners to import hug“Sn

from- England in the fall of 1866 and set ireein
Fairmount Paris, Philadelphia. They did so W611
that in the following year another batch was let

Like many foreigners, they acted as if the coun-
try was made for them, and they set to work driv-
ing out the other birds whose ancestors lived here
before the Pilgrims landed on Plymouth Rock.
They bossed the wrens, teased the blue-jays and
took possession of all the nice houses which the
Park Commissioners had built in the shade trees.
They bred fast and in a few years their army was
strong enough to right all the other'tribes of birds
together. One by one they drove out the orioles
and made it so uncomfortable for the robins that
they moved into the country, and soon they had
the ﬁeld all to themselves. In the meantime the
caterpillars held high carnival. :

Then the cry went up that. the sparrow was it

at the head of. the scientiﬁc branch of the Departp .

the farmers all over the country asking them to

two thousand replies, and not a single one of
them had a good Word for the sparrow.

Ornithologist Assemblyman Erwin was muchﬂ
interested in the matter, and through his eiforts

the last Legislature passed a bill making it a mis—

sparrows or -u‘bor them.

to rent them without checking. No doubt per-
sons who have not considered the subject and
have noticed that many horses are driven with
high checks, take it for granted that it is the
proper way to have them harnessed. But men
who own and have the care of horses ought to
know that to deprive them .of the free use of

endurance, and to waste their strength by
checking, overdriving, or any species of ill

VABUSE OF HORSES.~—DUTY on THE HUMANE SOCIETY.

Any one who has his eyes about him on our

[streets and avenues can see hundreds of noble

3,.hiorses tossing their heads about, with bloody nos~

Tt-rils and mouths and strained eyes, and suffering

f agexpruciating pain from that instrument of torture,

= e: medern overhead check. For the use of it there
no excuse but the vanity of the owner,who thinks

15.1} it imparts style to his animal, which is no

itex‘cuse at all. What amount of suffering it entails

j=fupon his horse he would understand if he were

{hitched the. load himself. and then had his head

‘Zmercilcssly drawn back, his face turned upwards,

_j his eyes blinded by the sun, and some brutal, igno-

ﬁrant fool to lash him along the street. -

_ ‘_ .Howany person possessing ordinary intelligence,

.' kindness or humanity can adopt this barium-cue

;i§ashion canonly be explained byvthe impression

‘. they have that the horse thus drawn back with the
straight strap over his neck shows more “style.”

The cruelty of this practice has been expesed over

. ;,,_;a_:_nd over again, but the abuse still centinues. It

, gno‘w remains for the Humane Society to do its work

,1 thoroughly and at once. If it cannot be stopped in

, Early other way, let their agents take a knife with

‘ . -' them and cut the che ck rein, and. then let the own—

“ers sue them if they dare. Mr. Bergh has had the

‘ courage) to stop the infamous practice in New York,
I? though it earned him the dislike of some of the

The fox hunt took place last Fast Day. It was tes-

prisoner for some time and then wantonlir loosed

it, only to be killed after trying in vain to escape.

Mr. Jesse Keith appeared for Turner. He argued
that it was no crime to kill foxes, as they are noxious
animals, and to exterminate them is a beneﬁt to the
community. He denied that to kill them by hounds

was a'cruel death.

be to wish to abolish the whole police iorce’
because one policeman Shot Captain Jack
Hussey. More so, indeed; for that shooting
w an Wanton murder, While probably the
Mayor’s child provoked the dog to bite by.
teasing it. Sometimes the Mayor’s Spasms’
work in a right direction;_sometimes in a
wrong one. ' ' ,

“I know no better test of a man’s general
disposition,” says Colonel Robert G. Inger-
3011, “than his relations with dogs—whether
he likes them, and they like him.” ' N

Charles Dickens, once wishing to praise a
friend of his to One ofours, said that he was
“almost good enough to live with a dog.”

Lamartine, in his memoirs, says, “When-
ever a person is unhappy, God sends him a.
dog; I have proved it twenty times, though‘
man does not always perceive it.”

“The Spirit of God is with animals, as it
is with us,” says the Rev. 131'. Frederick H.
Hedge, the venerable Professor of Ecclesias-
tical History in Harvard College; “con-
sciously with us, unconsciously With them.
We are not divided, but are one in his care
and love. '1 hey have their mansions in the.

Master and Keeper is one for us and for .
them." '

“A righteous man regardeth the life of his
beast,” said King Solomon.

"Of every kind of sin which I have com-
mitted against any of the creatures of God,”
said Thales, the Grecian philosopher, men-
tioning dogs particularly; “if I have Sinned
against any of these, I repent. Forgive me,
O Lord!" .

We hope that Mayor Hewitt, too. may ob-
tain God’s forgiveness. He needs it, after
his letter to incite an indiscriminate dog-
killing, which was published yesterday.
Even regarding licensed dogs merely as
chattels, without any of those sentiments
which our quotations show that a large and
very intelligent part of mankind entertains
toward them, the Mayor’s letter as directly
encourages malicious mischief as if the
captain of the police precinct in which the
Mayor’s house is Situated should advertise '
that he would "feel no personal gricl” if he
should hear that it had been pillaged and
razed to the ground

Five Hundred Veterinarians Sign a Paper Condema
ing Check-reins.-Pennsylvanians Endeavor to
Have the Use of the Check Abolished by Legisla-
tion—The Terrible Results of Tight Checking.—
N o Diseases Caused by N ot Using the Checks! 1 3——
'1‘welve Reasons Against the Bearing-rein.-—Gen-
eral verdict of Science and Humanity that Checks
are Useless and Injurious. 7
The usual argument in favor of checking

horses is that it gives them “style.” Now

there may be a grain of truth, even in an idea
which as a whole is false. It is true that a spir-
ited horse who raises his head proudly as he
dashes along is a magniﬁcent object, butit is
also true that the grace of his movements is ab-
solutely lost as soon as he is forced to remain in

. . aposition which he only assumed temporarily
through a natural impulse of strength and vital-

. ity. It is the alertness of expression, the intel-

. . ligent glance, the sensitive ear, the swaying
. neck, the changing pose . of ~ the head,
. the free motion of all the vigor~
ous, celestic muscles, that constitutes the
beauty of the horse; not the fastening of his
head to his tail, the pulling down of his jaw
and the linding of his eyes, with their conse-
quent result—a general air either of rebellious
initiation or of hopeless endurance. We feel
conﬁdent that as soon as the injurious effect of

, tight checking is understood by the public the

ractice will be abandoned and beauty and com-

fort will be preferred to “style.” Many men
who use the over-draw will, when any comment
IS made in regard to it, undo the check for about
a second and say, “There! You see he holds his
head Just as high without it.” Probably he
does when he expects every moment to have
the check replaced, for the horse is more
a creature of habit than any other animal.
But allowing that he does carry his head
high naturally, that simply pro ves that the
check serves no end except to prevent him from
ever putting his head down, and no horse un-
less forced to it keeps his head raiSed long at a
time. He lowers it to give relief to the spine,
,1 to the muscles of the neck and to the lungs. If
;1 this relief is not permitted, the horse suffers
gl Just in proportion to the tightness of the check-
1ng and the length of time that he is compelled
to remain in this constrained position.

Another remark constantly made by users of
3 the over- draw is that “the check is loose as soon
(2. as the horse starts.” Of course it is. The
, horse hates the over-draw and will raise his
2 . head to avoid it when he can. But
l' he 1s making a choice between havingP
;_ hIS neck cramped, or his brain thumped
fl and his mouth stretched by resting the weight
of his head and neck on the check; and as soon
as he is tired his doom is upon him, he can rebel
no longer, his ears are laid «back, his eye-lids
droop, and he looks-go on the street at any
hour of the day and you can see how he looks
bull; you ought to think how he feels l ’

, n argument w ich is fre uentl br on
? forward is that the check “precirents Stile alibi}:
[ from taking the bit in his teeth.” Mr. Thrall
; the efﬁcient agent of the Connecticut Humand
Society gives it as his opinion . that about one
3 horse in a thousand will set his teeth on the bit
‘1 either through ugliness or fright: but even if
the average is considerably larger, this does not
form an important exception to the no check

l rule in point of numbers. Mr. Thrall also

‘ stated that even_ If a horse should

1 take the bit 1n his teeth and run

1 he ought not to be set down as vicious until his:

1 mOuth had been examined. A sudden pull on

‘ an ulcerated tooth or an inﬂamed jaw will make

gusually gentle animal frantic for the time

The following article f pm “Our Anim i1 ‘
Friends” of June 25, 1885, indicates the state of

subject:
The 0dious Check-Rein.

F The followmg we quote from a letter received
oy Pres1dent Bergh, asking his cooperation in
pi rparing a b1ll for the abolition of the check-
reiii 1n the state of Pennsylvania:

‘ There are a few members of the House of
Representatives of this state who are favorable
to a bill abolishing the check-rein on horses, and
who would act in the furtherance of a measure,
, ent1re' or in part, to ’aid in that direction.
: Knowmg your well wishes to aid in ameliora-
ting the condition of our dumb animals, could
you suggest the nucleus of a bill which will
meet the views of its advocates?” ‘

In compliance with, and in answer to the
foregomg letter, President Bergh prepared and
has forwarded the following memorial, an '1
draft of_a b1ll to be presented to the Legislature
at Harrisburgh: »

MEMORIAL.
9 To the Honorable, the Legislative Assembly of the
State of Pennsylvania. \

The cruel treatment to which horses are subjected
by the use of the check, or bearing rein, is the sub-
Ject matter of this memorial.

The instrument referred to is entirely superfluous,
and, while serving no useful purpose, tends to iniiic
great physical pain and suffering on the horse. It
is worthy of note that the advocates of this instri -
ment of torture offer in support of its use the illogi-
cal argument that “the check-rein holds, and pro—
v: his the horse from falling.” How the support,

. which falls along with the animal. can be said to
! hold it up 1S not clear. And, whereas, eminent vet-
? crinary writers, surgeons and others, at horn-e and
, abroad, have declared that the use of the check or
1 bearing rein tends to strain and distort the m :iscies
of the neck, thereby seriously interrupting the cir-
culation of the blood, and rendering the animal
1 nervous and restive, until at length, maddened, with
pain and conﬁnement, the suffering creature, in
many cases, runs away.

And, whereas, said instrument is a mere fashion-
able innovation, adding nothing either to the

‘ beauty, usefulness or security of the animal ~your'

' petitioner earnestly prays that a statute may be

enacted prohibiting its use in this state.

AN ACT TO PREVENT THE USE or CHECK on BEARING-
REINS. . .

Any person using, or causing, or procuring, or
permitting the use of any check, or bearing rein, or

PHILADELPHIA, June 7‘, 1837.

Dear Sir: We have no law in Pennsylvania
such as you refer to, but we have managed, by
forcing'public opinion, to largely do away with
the check rein in this city. In one or two cases,
where we were able to prove actual suffering,
we have prosecuted, but have never been able
to secure any legislation on the subject.

The public are gradually becoming educated
to the fact that the check rein is a cruel contri-
vance, and are to a great extent desistlng from
N ow and then I see a horse reined up
so that he seems to suffer, and in such cases I
invariably see the owner, reason with him, and
nearly always succeed in convincing him of the
abuse. Yours, very truly,

M V. B. DAVIS, Secretary.

Henry W. Taylor, Sec’y Conn. Humane Society.

In a city like Hartford where the average in—
telligence of the citizens is or such a high grade,

l we feel that public sentiment in favor of the
g kind treatment of horses ought to be strong
l enough to regulate this matter without recourse
; to legislation, and we have no doubt that this
, will/be the case as soon as the subject has met
‘ with general consideration. -

A DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCESS—AN 1M;
PORTANT EXPERIMENT. ‘

The following is clipped from the Brook-
. lyn (Iowa) C/zrmzz'de .'

We accepted an invitation from Dis-
horner Frazier Monday morning to visit
john R.‘Duffus’s farm, six miles south-
west of town, and witness the sawing off
of horns. * * * A stanchion was erected
in the cattle shed. For this kind of busi- l
ness Mr. Frazier carries with him an iron l
frame which is securely pinned to a strong i
post. This can be adjusted to ﬁt any l
neck. Business ceinmenced. The cattle, l
with some difﬁculty, were all driven intol
the stable. A yearling was the ﬁrst taken '

1 into the frame, because it was the easiest
handled and Would give those present an
Opportunity of learning how to handle

i them. Here comes a handsome young
heifer with horns six inches long. She
comes up gently'and the wicked men get ‘

her ready. A rope is thrust around her
neck and over the nose. Then her head
goes into the frame and the frame is keyed,
the rope goes around a post a few feet to
one side to hold her head in shape, a man
is stationed at the rear to keep her hind
quarters in place and she is ready. The
critter lowers a left car as if anticipating
something of the kind and 1f free would
vanish. But she is not free. She can’t
move a peg. , The horn is examined, the
A proper ring is found and down, comes the
saw. The ﬁrst cut brings her to her front
feet and she would tear up the whole earth
if she could. Finding that she can’t do
anything desperate she calms herself and
perhaps throws herself and quietly submits
to the torture. It only takes a few min»
utes and ‘ the horns fall to the ground.

She is turned loose and another victim is
brought to the sacriﬁce. Does it hurt?
Well, yes, we should think so. So does

, pulling teeth. It is on the same principle.

' Here comes an old cow. She goes into
the frame much the same as some women

'go into a dentist’s chair. She is fully de-

‘ termined that she won't submit to such
torture. She makes more fuss looking at

‘tlle instruments than she does during the
time the operation is being performed. It
is a noticeable fact, however, that as soon
as the sawing is over the cattle do not
1mind it. They go into the ﬁeld and Soon :
commence to feed. As the later victims
are let loose the ﬁrst ones come up to in»
quire after their health and perhaps to seek
a ﬁght. The 'old boss cows which have
been used to hooking anything that oime
near, find very soon that they are depriv- I
cd of their power and go off somewhat de- l
spondent, something like a disappointed:
ofﬁce seeker after election. The young l
calves catch on very quickly to this, and
are ready to tackle all the cross steers and

could survey. Iobn leads him with a hal-
ter and carries a pitchfork as a weapon of
defense in case the bull feels inclined to
work him up into bologna sausage. As
he approaches we beat a. retreat. Donald
crawled into a manger and the others
found it convenient to look at the hogs in
another ﬁeld. The bull IS securely tied
to the stanchion and the visitors come
ﬂocking from their hiding places. How
is he to be got into the frame P His neck
is too large for it. He smells blood and
it’s not safe to loosen him. The time has
. arrived for some of Donald’s ingenuity.

used in making the stanchion substantial.
It is propped and roped and is at last strong
enough. The ﬁrst victory ﬁlls the bull
with conﬁdence and when the saw comes
down again he is ready to tear up the
earth. But he does not. He can’t get a
foothold. By the time he gets ready to
lift the pillars and kill the naughty Pliilis-
tines at his head and tail, his horns are off
and lie as trophies at our feet. His power
is gone and he seems as meek as a lamb.
A yearling can frighten him out of his
l wits.

‘ For some little time after the horns are
off the blood issues forth, but not in any
great quantity. We saw 20 dishorned and
we do not believe that a pint of blood came
from any one. We have been asked by
many for our Opinion of dishorning. We
«are not prepared to give it at this time.
As yet dishorning here is but an experi-
ment. Several hundred head in this vi-
cinity have been dishorned. We would
not advise any one to try it. Wait and
see how the others do. It may prove a
bad venture. If these cattle that have ‘
been dishorned come out all right in a
year or so, it will be time then for any one
to make up their minds. If the experi-
ment proves a success we ifavor the dis?
homing of all the cattle in the county. .An
animal, be it cow, steer, or bull, is better
without horns. Horns and barb wire kill '
more stock every year than any cattle, ‘
plague that ever visited the county: Butt
, our farmers have stood horns many years
and they can stand it one year more at
, least.

elephant lied been deemed far too dangerous:
to exhibit in public performances, and had'
been sent hither to be kept in a large iron
cage, in the menagerie building. He was of l
. a revengeful disposition, and would treasure.
up an injury for months seeking the ﬁrst;
. favorable opportunity to wreak his spite. At ;
1’ one time he seized a keeper named Herman l
- with his trunk and threw him,“ as a boy might l
~ toss a ball, through a window of the building,
inﬂicting severe injuries. Many efforts were
“ made to tame him, but none succeeded.
“ Finally he was sold to a showman at that time ,
F traveling through the South.
, Then came the difﬁculty of removing him
from the cage where he had been conﬁned for
- . overs-year. There was only one attendant
‘ courageous enough to enter the cage and un-
fasten the shackles from his legs. This man .
‘ was Thomas, Donohue, who had been the
night watchman at the menagerie since 1876.
; He possesses a wonderful power over wild
. animals, and stands upon such familiar foot-
ing with lions, tigers and other ferocious
beasts that he fearlessly caresses them. The
secret of his power is kindness. Donohue.
had always treated Emperor with gentleness,
at the same time giving him to understand 2
that he was the master, so that when the time
came for the elephant’s removal he entered -
. the cage without the slightest trepidation, set ,
4 free his shackled feet, passed a rope over his
, . neck and led him triumphantly out of the
building. It was deemed by every one pres-
' eat a remarkably courageous act. Emperor '
. afterward became so unmanageable that an-
~ other attempt was made to subdue him. An _‘
elephant gives evidence of subjection in loud ’
sereamings, but although red-hot irons were
applied to his feet until they were ruined for- .
f ever, Emperor did not even groan. He was
rendered worthless by the experiment and
= was consequently killed. ;

THE CRIPPLED BELT LINE. _

The unfortunate Belt line since the burning of Its
car stables has had its facilities sadly crippled. It 18
one of the hard roads for horses. At the oﬂice of
the company, at Fifty-second street and Tenth ave-
nue, it was said that although the company now
owned nine hundred horses, against about twelve
hundred before the ﬁre, yet only twenty-
ﬁve cars were run per day as compared with the old
average of .125. The new horses were tender
footed and green. On the east side route, to the
Battery via Fifty-ninth street, the trip would be,
made by the old horses in less than two hours. The
new horses have to be laid off so many times 01} the
way that it takes them ﬁve hours to make the Jour-
hey. The horses are watered on the route at Forty-
ﬁrst street, at Fourteenth, at Grand and at the
Battery.

RETIGEXT SIXTH AVENUE PEOPLE.

Information concerning the horses of the Sixth
avenue road was refused at the company’s stables
on Forty-third street. It was learned, however. that
the horses are “doing quite well,” and the runs
are cut up into short distances. In winter the horses
make two successive round trips of ten miles on that
road. It is not considered a hard road on horses.

MR. BERGH’s wonn.

To see how the horses were faring from 3. Henry
Bernh standpoint, the headquarters of the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was Vie--
ited. Mr. Charles H. Hankinson, the superinten-
dent of the society, said;-——

"The hot weather keeps us on the jump. What
we are doing for horses and all other animals is
almosr. impossible to describe. I and my force 01
assistants have been on the go ever since four o’clock
this morning. We are worked night and day.
patrol wagon has never stopped since morninv.

We have to cover every horse car line in the city.
Over tWenty teams of horses have been sent back to
the stables overheated. Twenty—live horses have ‘
been relived with our medicine chest. Sunstroke.
staggers and the colic have knocked out a. great
many horses to-chy.

“What is done for horses suffering from those ail-
ments ‘3” was asked. »

“There are several remedies- We generally take a

' large piece of ice and lay it over the horse’s eyes.

 

Then we get a large sponge full of ammonia and

apply it to his nostrils. The ammonia sets the blood

circulating and relieves the pressure on the brain.
AWNINGS NEEDED FOR RELAY HORSES.

“More shade is what the street car horses should
have. I want permission to erect awnings at all the
places where relay horses have to stand. At every
mile and a half of horse our road in this city there
is a. relay station. Row onysome of the lines, no.

tably the Second Avenue and the Tenth
Avenue Belt line, the sun strikes them in
such a. way that there is scarcely any

shade the entire day. The elevated raierad tracks
furnish a few cool spots to some of the lines, but on
the two I mention the poor relay horses have to
stand all day long with the sun's rays beating full
upon them. .

“The property owners make no objection to the
putting up of awnings, but the city authorities won’t
permit it."

“Why is it that the society’s ofﬁcers are" seen
around Madison and Union squares, but not along
the docks ‘3”

“They are not seen,

ing his human patients, but I was not pleased
with the result. Then I had to learn the

definition of. the word “torture ” in the Penal
(lode is construed as “ any act or neglect
whereby uniustiﬁable physical pain, suffering,

society, 100 East Twenty-second street, in the
absence oer. Berzh. .

Dr. Leo Sommer, of the Medical University of
Buda-Pesth, Hungary, was not permitted yesterday
to experiment on the dogs in the pound, to demon-

strate the eliicacy of his preventive of hydrophobia.
Yesterday morning he received a. letter from Mr.
Henry Bernh, Jr., in which Mr. Bergh, Sr., says he
“does not consider the results achieved in this
direction warrant any such wholesale aﬁliction of

: suffering. The process might be almost painless, ‘

'LIi'rLE’ GIRL AND BIG BE—AR, 1

 

i. WEE BERRY mouse ATTACKED, AND SAvED
BY A BRAVE DOG. ,

[er TELEGRAPH TO THE RERALDJ
PHCENICIA. N. Y., August 3, 1887.—-—Little Maggie
Curren is ﬁve years old and is as brave as she is f
pretty. Maggie lives with her father in Mink Hol-
low, in the Catskill Mountains. When William Cur-

ren left his home this morning to work at haying he
told his daughter she mic ht try and pick some black
berries close by.

By nine o’clock Maggie had a large dinner pail
half full Of tempting looking fruit, when she was
suddenly startled by seeing a. big bear come out

' from a. dense thicket and come toward her. Maggie
said “sho !” a. number of times, but the bear merely

, growled. Then she picked up a thick stick and hit

the intruder a. crack over the head. At this point'

the bear caught hold of her dress and began drag- .

ging her into the woods. " ,

The little girl screamed lustlly for help, and it
came speedily in the shape of her father’s watch— ‘
dog Carlo. The intelligent animal seemed to grasp
the situation at a. glance, and it attacked the bear in
the rear so as to make it drop the child. Carlo bit
the brute so eﬁectively that it was forced to let
Maggie go, and then the courageous dog kept ﬁght-
ing Bruin for all he was worth, so that the child.
could have a chance to run home. and she improved 1
it. After she got there the whole neighborhood ‘
turned out, and the mountain side was thoroughly
scoured. Carlo was found with the blood running;
down his sides, and as he wagged his tail he seemedﬁ
to say :-——"I saved Maggie, anyway.”

The pursuit of Bruin is still being kept up, though
it is believed by old hunters that it is hiding in a]
cave. There isn’t money enough in all the Catskills ‘
to buy Carlo to-night. .

The thrilling adventure is the theme of the coun- .
trysido, and little Maggie is asked to tell her story ,
over and over again. ,

Hema'n Clark’s Superintendent Will Have"
to Appear in Three Courts.

Patrick Grecney, the superintendent of Contractor
chian Clark‘s stables on Schenck street, is becom«
ing a modern Job in the estimation of himself and
friends. Mr. Greeney came from New York to work
for Mr. Clark on the 23d day of July last, and he tO'
day declared that he had seen more judges and
courts since then than in his whole previous life. He

3 was arrested by Superintendent Clark, of the Society
1 for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, shortly after

he come to Brooklyn. This case was adjourned, but as
the mules used by the contractor to do his work con-
tinned to have sores and be dillapidated looking. Mr,
Greeney was again arrested. This did not seem to
cure matters; and Superintendent Clark, of the soci-
cty, found a disabled animal being driven by Richard
J uckson. For the third time Greeney was arrested, on
a warrant issued by Justice Naeher this morning. As
with the other cases, an adjournment was given, and
now the poor man will be in court as follows: On
the 17th of August before Justice Kenna, on the 19th
before Justice Naeher. and on the 28d before Justice
Walsh. The charge in each case is cruelty to ani-
mals, and the society for the prevention of the same
will prosecute. It is probable that George F. Swift
will also be in court as a defendant, and perhaps
Hemen Clark.

Dr. Eommer 2%“ ct Allowed to Experiment
at the Dog Pound.

Dr. Lee Sommcr, a chemist, believes that he
has discovered a. means of vaccinating dogs
against hydrophobia. He claims that. after the
hydrophobic Virus is introduced in. their veins,
the :mimals are sick for ten minutes, recover,
drink water and ever after are proof against
the hydrophobic. He says he spent. three
years in experimenting.

At 10 o’clock yesterday morning Dr. Sons-
mer arrived at. the dog pound to begin a. series
of experiments there. He had previously
asked the permission of llinyor Hewett and
the Board of Health, who interposed no ob-

' jection. He then addressed a. letter to Mr.
Iicrc‘h’s society, asking what its attitude would
be, and received a. reply calculated to (ﬂee
courage him from the undertaking. .

At the pound he was informed that the Son
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
had interdicted the experiments es in Violation
of the Penal Code, which provxded that some»
tillc experiments on animals should be made
with the inilorscment of the faculty of some

ATTACKING THE HEALTH BOARD.

: “’hat Commissioner Ottoman Says of
Dr. McLean’s Charges.

L. McLean has written a letter to the
Health Department, drawing. the Commissioner's-
attention to what he considers 'a heinbus crime in
the lax manner in which the laws pertaining to the
inspection of what people eat and drink are en-
forced. The writer says that in company with Sur-

_ perintendent Clark, 0f the Society for the Preven-

. tion of Cruelty to Animals, he visited the» premises
of Heller Herman, 38 Flushing avenue, and there
found nine milch cows, four of' which were aﬂiicted
with a loathsome contagious. disease. Mr. McLean
says: “One of these cows was so far gone that it
was then and there shot by Superintendent Clark.
to end its misery. All these animals were milked
up to the morning of the visit and their milk was

- allowed to be vended within the city limits. Said
milk,” added the doctor, “might well be labeled, ?
‘ Death at 8 cents a quart.’ I made, a post mortem
examination of the carcass of the animal shot, and
the diseased specimens can be seen at my hospital.
These cows have been in this diseased condition for -
from one to three months, and during all this time ’
no restriction or prohibition has been issued from
the Health Department to stop this ﬁendish trafﬁc.” .

Commissioner Otterson. when asked regarding
these statements, said: “It is nothing but pure
maliciousuess that could attempt to saddle such
charges upon this department. The statements of
this man are partly true, but mostly false. There
"were some sick cows at 838 Flushing avenue, and as
~ soon as we learned the fact we sent inspectors and
veterinarians there and made a. thorough investi-
gation. It is untrue that any of the milk from
these diseased animals was sold or offered for sale.
The cows were. in fact, too sick to give milk. The
United States inspector also visited the premises,
and he assured me yesterday that all the cows in
those stables would be killed. Herman’s permit to
sell milk was revoked as soon as we learned the 2
condition of the cows, and he will not be allowed to

secure another.”

Care of Animals in Summer.

.7—
The Amerimm Humane Association
lll'esei'its the followil’lg‘l~ “Agile-Slim“ 1'31"
atjvp to the care of animals during the
heated term. '

Provide \vaterm-fresh. pure water.
Think. reader. how you are refreshed by
a. drink of cool water on a hot. day. The
lower animals are equally in need of the
means of quenching thirst.

5 The active dog rc-rquires drink frequent—
ly during the hot days. as does. also the cat;
and a dish, of fresh water should stand
where they can have access to it. Un—

' (’lmilitedly many a (big is driven to mad—
ness throi‘igh lack of \ ’ater; and the testi-
mony is that hydroplmbia is almost un-
kno'. .1», in those localities where dogs can
drink when they wish.

Every city. village and country town
should he liberally supplied with‘drink—
ing‘ fountains for animals, and they should
be so constructed that even the smallest
dog can drink from them. No gift to a
people confers urgrreziter plez’zsuie than a
fountain. an'l'l that person who turns aside
a stream from the tield and gives a water—
ing trough to the rtiiedsii‘le. or provides a
f'oi'intain at which man and beast can
drink pure water, is truly a public bene—
factor.

5 Give the horse frequent omiiortunitv to
quench thirst zit times when not too niuch
over—heated. and before eating. To drink

freely immediately after eating. prevents

5 a t;;.\'<n-a.l.>le digestion of food. '

Provide shade. How instindively we
seek the shadow when the sun is pouring

its hot rays on the dry and parchinu' earth. -

i If the pasture i5 not provided with shade
.' trees. in u convenientlocality set four. six
,or eigl‘it supports. across tWhich place
i s raw or grass. and thus in a. brief time
t and with little labor make a shade in which

animals can rest from the heat of the sun,

to the great comfort of themselves and ,

i benefit. to their owners.

3 Remove the harness from the horses in
i the hot day whenever you desire to give
5 them af'ull. free. rest. and once (llfll'll'légllle
[l day, preferably at night. a thorouglicur-
1 rying and grooming: will not only give rest,

l
f but Will do about" as much towards improv— '
r .

ing' the animal’s condition as will the oats.
‘j Examine. the harness on your working
, team. and you will discover that blinds,
; check—reins and cruppers are simplv tor—
i luring con trivances. serving no useful pur—
-;',' pose. Take. them all. off for tl e conven—
54 ience of yourselves and the comfort of the
'5‘; horses. Keep the stable well ventilated
and free from the strong ammonia. 'wl ich
- is injurious to the eyes. Assist the ani—
~ mals to protect themselves against flies,
feed regularly. hitch in the shade. and re-
. member that the care which will give
-_ qunfort tothe lower animals will,| make
.iem doubly proﬁtable to their owners,
. aside from the humane bearing upon the
* . subject.

admitted that an attempt) to enlighten the f

diminish the'amount of such cruelty, and in _.e
directly lead to other equally satisfactory re- 9:
cults. While we writ-e ‘morc especially for;
the farmer, who 18 from circumstances obliged
to slaughter his own annuals, and for those
who are called upon relucvancly to rid them- ‘
selves of some fond but; disabled pet, we also ‘

PRECAUTIONS. .

Thus, the animal to be slaughtered should
be conducted to the spot selected as quietly ’

and everything calculated to alarm him should

witness the death of aucther. Tl'lﬂll’lg as

butcher, they are in reality of vast import:

of meat; for food, and the market: value of the
animal slaughtered ; there being no question
as to the effects of torture, cruelty and fear
upon the secretions, and it upon the score-
tions, necessarily upon the ﬂesh.

l METHODS.

The slaughtering? of animals fur food at the
present; day may be classiﬁed under three
methods:~—-l. Rendering, the animals insen- .
sible‘ by a. blow on the head, followed by 7
bleeding. 2. Cutting: through or injuring the
spinal cord (pithing), so as to destroy the
powers of motion and sensation, w1th subse-
quent bleeding. 3. Cutting the throat, deep-
ly dividing all the blood-vessels, with or
without thrusting the knife into the heart,
and without previously stunning the animal.
This last method is practised by the Jews.

From certain experiments Conducted for
the purpose a few years since In the abattoirs
of Paris, it. would seem that the ﬁrst: of these
methods, namely, that. of producmg insensiv
bility by some sudden shock to the brain,
such as that of .a. direct and concentrated
blow, especially if. followed by immediate E
blood-letting, is attended (by less suffering
than when death is effected by decapitation,

A’Germaﬁl observer (Dr. Sondermann, of
Munichl'remarks upon this subject: “All
methods of slaughtering have for their object
the death of the animal in a. more or less
speedy, but; always in the least painful man- ,
nor possible. But what is death? and when
does actual death occur? Simple as these
two questions may appear, they are neverthe»

in which insensi y is produced by a. severe .
shock to the brign, followed by bleeding.

“VOLUNTARY AND lNVOLUNTARY MOTION. ‘
There are two kinds Of motiOn. The one ‘
is voluntary, and dependent: upon the brain.

to be relied upon as evrdences of pain.
YITHING. ,

The term ‘i pithing ” is applied to two meth-
ods of inﬂicting injury to the nervous system,
and thereby producing death. By one meth.
ad, that most commonly in vogue, the. spinal
cord is severed or punctured between the ﬁrst;
i and second bones of the neck, where the_pe.
culiurity of the articulation leaves an opening.
This is done by a variety of instruments.
‘ Although the animal drops immediately, life
" continues for some seconds and even minutes,
T the heart; continues to beat and the brain to '

live and act. By the other method, a small
. spot situated in the lower and posterior por-
‘ tion of the brain is reached and broken up by 5
the introduction of a-narrow, sharp instru-
' menu. Death is almost instantaneous. .“No
, attemptis made at inspiration, there IS no
4‘ struggle, and no appearance 0: suffering. The
animal dies simply by a. want of aeration of
the blood, which leads in a few moments to
an arrest of the circulation.” (Dalton’s Phy
siology.) Both of these modes of slaughter
ing, cepecially the last, require .an anatomical
knowledge as well as a. practical dexterity
that; but; few would attain, and, if they are. l
. not'properly and quickly executed, are un?
l doubtedly attended by more suffering than
‘ other methods. '

SHOULD BE DEPRIVED OF SENSIBILITY.

\Vithoub entering further into the cen-
sideration of physiological questions of so
much importance, we may with safety lay
do wn the futowing proposition :——-

All animals, when slaughtered, should be
deprived of sensibility by inﬂicting sutﬁment
injury to the brain, either by a sudden and
gvmtent blow of the an or mallet, by the
' bullet, or by some other equally efﬁcient
means, and should then be immediately bled
during the state of insemi‘cilny. w.

the suffocation and consequent struggling,
which at ﬁrst attend the administration. or
of anmsthetics are very great, theapplication
of the chloroform may, be gradual, the animal
being aliowed to respire the outward air for
a moment, until these effects pass off. As it
is by the exclusion of common air, however, .
that death is produced. the more persistently :
the administration of the, chloroform is kept .
up, the more speedy will be the decired,

The dose requisite varies very much accord~
«, ins; to circumstances. At least Sixteen
miners of. Cl?l=J':"il-f<‘}f1n should be procured,
and it Should be freshly applied through a

The difﬁculties attending the administra-
tion of Cbl-‘I‘OfOfln to so large and powerful
an animal as the horse, particularlvat the
hands of the inexperienced, render its use ~
less applicable than either of the other,
methods. In cases where sickness and con-

ALVES.
In the slaughtering of calves it is not a
i common practice with us, as it is with France
‘5 and other countries, to render them insensible
a before bleeding. for fear that the brain may
3 be niade‘less inviting as an article of food by

_.‘...‘._ it.—

3 being t‘drn and stained with blood. By using

a broad mallet this maydn a great measure be
, avoided, and even if these results do follow
they do not in realty alter the quality of the
brain for edible purposes. Objections to the
humane destrucﬁon or” an animal on such

3 grounds are. as unreasonable as those which
are made to Juicy and wholesome red veal ‘

L

' by people who prefer that which has been .

rendered white, dry and innutritious by

repeated bleedings, which’have reduced the
. calf, before death to a lingering condition of
> faintness and debility.

The calf should be ﬁrst stunned by a blow
upon the head by a broad mallet or hammer,
‘ aimed at a spot relatively the same as in the
4 full-grown animal. This is to be followed by

immediate bleeding, by severing the throat
at a point corresponding to the upper portion
‘ of the windpipe, using a sharp knife and do-

ing the work thoroughly and at once so as to .

' open all the arteries and veins of the neck.

issuer sun LAMBS.

. Sheep and lambs should be rendered in-
sensible by blow upon the head to be Iollowed
subsequently by severing the throat, as Just
advised in the cases of calves, or by plunging

: a sharp-pointed knife through the blood-

3 vessels at either side of the neck between the .

' bones and the wind-pipe.

The i'place to be selected for a blow is the
. centre of a line drawn across the head about ~

two inches above the eyes, the brain in the
3, sheep occupying a situation posterior to

natural one.

SWINE.

There is an idea prevalent among farmers,
:and even among many of those who practice
‘ the slaughtering of swine as an avocaiion,

that, tit" these animals are ﬁrst rendered in»

. sensible by blows on the head, it is impossible ‘

to empty the blood-vesssels. _

There is no foundation. however, tor any
such opinion. Any obstacles to bleeding are
due, not to material differences in the
anatomical arrangement of the blood-.vessels,
but solely to the difﬁculties attending the
cutting through of the. great mass of fat and
flesh which characterizesthe necks of swme
in order to reach these vessels._ This very
difficulty is a reason why the animal should
be: rendered insenSible before bleeding, not
only on the score of humanity, but also on
the score of {glavoiding the barbarous SlQ‘hl‘aS
and sounds which so frequently disgrace our
t was and villages. .

In Euiope generally, the swuie are always
ﬁrst rendered insensible by being stunned.
They should be made insenaible by a blow
'upon the head, directr d, not between the,
eyes, but‘upon a spot in the middle of'a line
drawn across ,the head three or four inches
above the eyes. A. long sharp Knife should

The remarks which we have already made 3
as regards producing insensibility by a blow f
upon the brain may equally apply to poultry.
The almost universal method of killingby ,
chopping off the head of a fowl, and alldwi-ng 3
the body to flutter about on the ground, is J,
not an agreeable sight and has certainly a
demo lizing eﬁect upon those who witness it_
especi ly upon the young and those who are”
not yet callous to such sights. The same
may be said also of the practice of opening \
the blood~vessels in the necks of poultry, and ':
allowing them to bleed to death moreor'leds ,
slowly. Therefore to produce insenxnbﬂrtnwl .
make use of either the following modes- r ".

1. Grasp ‘he bird by the legs, placenta T , i3

; On the southeast corner of Fourth avenue {

land Twenty—second street stands a stately g
. brownstone building with a massive porch of i

the'same material. This building was once 5

.the residence of a wealthy down-town mer— .l

chant. But across the entableture of the
porch is now lettered the following sign:

..................................................... a.-..~.

EAMERICAN SOCIETY FOR THE PREVENTION OF:
; CRUELTY TO ANIMALS. I

i ............................................................ : .
On the ﬁrst floor is the general ofﬁce of the .

society. When THE EVENING SUN reporter ,

entered this ofﬁce recently he found Superin— ,
tendent Charles H. Hankinson at his official 5
desk within a railed enclosure. The desk was
white with a deep drift of legal documents. .
The walls of the oﬂice are covered with por—
traits and instruments of torture. The ﬁrst of
these to ' attract attention is the picture of a "
little girl about 10 years old. She is barefooted, "

‘ has a half-starved look, and her face and legs

bear long deep cuts. In the frame also is a ?
pair of tailor shears and a card With the follow-

ing scroll:
5 LITTLE MARY ELLEN CONNELLY, 5

. Rescued from the . ruelty of her aunt, Margaret .
: Connolly, who thus cut her With these shears. : .

“. The barbarity of that Connolly woman,” ;.
said Superintendent hankinson, “prompted ,
the formation of our society, Weorganized v'
snortiy after that brutal affair. It was away ."

' back in 1866. Beside that picture you see ana- ,3

other representing the little girl a year after
We took her.” ~
The reporter looked and saw a plump, g
pretty little miss. with a happy face. ‘But she ~
still bore a faint scar on one check. _
NeXt to these pictures hangs a frame with ;
many steel gafl‘s ranged in two rows. lna ,
glass case Just below the galls are two stuffed ;
gamecocks represented as they were when
taken by the officers. Both wear steel gaffe.
One is lying on its Side. Patches of its body
are bare of feathers and red With blood. The
other is‘standing, all gashed and feebly at-

corner of the case reads thus:

The above gaffe and these gainecocks were 5
captured in Mullholland’s cockpit Feb. 9, ’74—32
men arrested and fined $670.

“ Cock ﬁghting.” remarked the Superintend-
ent, “is now very Infrequent in New York.

New Jersey or to Flarrity’s on Laurel Hill,
behind Calvary Cemetery. This fellow Flaritty
also has a pit in a played out brewery at Wood-
side. The brewery is miles back in the bush,
and we ﬁnd it almost imposs1ble to catch him
at his brutal sport.” .

Near the gaffe is a frame containing an open
razor, and labelled:

 

S. P. Burden, 5 Hall place, N. Y.,
Aug. 1. ’84.

Burden was asailor. He had a sweetheart l

‘ whose father owned a vigilant dog. On Aug. 1, ;

18nd, Burden called to see his girl, and the dog ‘
seized him by the trousers. ihe sailor
whipped out a razor and cut off the dog’s nOse. ‘
The girl informed the society. and burden got .
three months in the penitentiary. When his 3
imprisonmentended lie renewed his attentions
to the girl, and she is now lllrs. Burden. ;
Close by the razor is the photograph of a
horse’s leg With the hoof hanging by a more ’
shred of skin. The horse belonged to Cabman .
Thomas Brady. It was afflicted with quittor. ’
arotting of the leg Just above the hoof. and I
was driven till the hoof turned completely out ’
”from under the leg. leaving a bloody stump. l
I

This occurred in front of the Hoffman House :

on the night of Feb. 25. 1885. Bob lngersoll

': was in the cab at the time. He was returning :

ito an uptown hotel after delivering his lecture ,
ion the “Mistakes of Moses” in the brookl n
Academy of Music. The horse was shot y
one of {jerghfs men. Brady got three months.

The Superintendent here showed a horse’s
skull Wllll a bullet hole through the frontal
bone. ‘_‘ Than”. said be, pointing to the bullet
hole. “ is the Vital spot in ahorse’s forehead.
We locate it exactly every time by putting our
thumbs to the on: or corners of the animal’s eyes
and ihen retretching our index ﬁngers up as .
far as we can on the forehead. The highest ’
Eggngwhere the two fingers meet is the vital .

“ The street car horses have caused us much
trouble, but the car companies are more par— .
ticular now. We once threatened to have some
of the lines abated as a brutal nuisance. All
the companies quickly .put up printed notices '
in their stables forbidding the drivers harness- 1
ing up lame or diseased horses. But the sta- .i
ble foreman forced the drivers to disobey the l
notice. if a driver refused to hitch up a lame
horse. he was discharged right off. We knew
how it was. We couldn’t blame the drivers.
and after arresting many of them we went for
the loremen. This works better. Last week
We arrested Foreman lilodgett of a Third ave-
nue stable for sending out awornout horse.
ﬁnd we feel sure of his conviction.”

.Ihe writer next noticed on the ofﬁce walla
pitchfork With clotted blood on its tines. De-
witt Powers stabbed his horse with this fork
Sept. 26, I884. He also dug an eye clean out of
the horse 3 head. The eye fell to the pavement
and one of Bergh’s ofﬁcers picked it up. it is
now preserved at the ofﬁce in a bottle of alco-
hol. Powers was tried in the Special sessions ,
andth thirty days. in the city prison.

~In a glass case is the stuffed skin of a bull-
dog taken Jan. 31, 1876, from a pit in Kane‘s
Park. Mott Haven. The peor brute is red with
blood, his ton _ ue hangs in shreds, and a fore- .
\. aw .lsnchewe, to pulp. Michael Feth,,W. H.

number is along brick building crowded with
coops. A city ordinance forbids the keeping of
fowl within the city limit except on a permit,
from the Board of Health. No.10 (ioverneur
slip has no such permit. and the owners
‘make a heap of money by renting the coops to
Hebrews for their poultry. When a Hebrew
wants a fowl killed he calls' on a rabbi.
The Mosaic law prescribes that the
killing shall be done by none but a rabbi.
The time allotted forthe business is between
moonrise Thursday night and sunset .t'ridav,
In that time the rabbi kills hundreds of food.
He is paid acent a head. After killing each 1
goose or chicken lie scrupulously cleans his
knife. This, too. is required by the Mosaic
law. Some of these rabbis have more religion
than heart. They often slit the necks of geese.
and leave them hanging alive for hours after
on iron hooks with the blood trickling down to
the floor. We intend to make them kill more .
quickly ”

Mr. nergh’s society also keeps a sharp look-

‘out for bull ﬁghters. In 1880 a Spanish grandee '

named Corteza came across the water to i ' - -
duce bull ﬁghting into New York. He brogggt ‘
With him six stalwart. sharp—horned bulls. bAt ;
a great expense he converted a big buildiner on 1'
new street and f-‘iftll avenue into an ahﬁ’lhi- l
theatre. When all this was done tli bpanish '
Consul called. on_Mr. Bergh and sought per- i
miss10n for his friend to have a series of bull i
lights. Mr. Bergh firmly refused and threat-
ened legal action. The lights didn’t take place "

“011. good morning Mr. --—--——,” said Superin<
lendent Hankinson greeting a. HERALD reporter as
he entered the headquarters of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals at Fourth avenue
and Twenty-second street.

"You’re on time,” continued the executive head
Of this humane association.

Turning to one of the officers he asked, “Jim, is
the team ready?” ' ‘

“All ready,” was the reply.

"Have you got your disguisas?" inquired the su-

 

perintendrcnt.
“Yes, h:_.’re in the wagon,” responded the of.
z ; ﬁcer. .

E ‘ The red patrol wagon of the society stood at thd

door. ' . '
“Get in," said» Superintendent Hankinson. Th1
. reporter climbed over the wheel into the rear seat
and was followed by this oiiicer.
Two other uniformed ofﬁcers occupied the front
2 ‘ seat. -
‘ Under the rear seat was the ever ready medicine
chest, containing various bottles, sponges, oakum,
_' l .. nippers and other articles and implements used in
i E treating sore and lame horses. The disguises which
the Superintendent spoke of consisted of two coats
and hats. They come in handy when the eagle
eyed uniformed ofﬁcers, looking ahead, see a. case
in which brass buttons might, unless concealed, pro
Vent a. capture. '
“Five o’clock,” exclaimed the superintendent
looking at his watch. “This is about the hour we

start on our tour. Ugh! it's chilly, isn‘t it?” he con:
tinned, drawing his overcoat closer and buttoning 1..

higher. . _
I Yes it was. It usually, is at that hour or a und-
1 October morning. Streaks of approaching dayhghl

were just beginning to glimmer in the eastern sky

as the ofﬁcer holding the reins told the horse to "gel

, . up.” Oh" the wagon rattled, joining the noisy

' chorusof milk wagons that were seen and heard in

15 . ' every direction.

INCIDENTs or THE TOUR.

While going through a street on the west side, en
route to the stock yards atthe foot of West Sixty-
ﬁfth street, a. man leading his dog out for the benc-
ﬁt of its health was seen on the sidewalk some
yards ahead of the patrol wagon. A stray cat was
mousing in the middle of the street. The man let
the terrier loose and cried, “Sic ’em!" The dog
jumped after the cat and one of the officers ran

1 after the man. The chase was short and sharp. The
l i . eat escaped. but the man didn’t.

‘3' "Look here,” said the ofﬁcer to the owner of the
- : dog, “you musn’t do that again or you may be ar-
f‘g rested. Its lucky for you that your dog failed to

i~ l catch that poor cat, for if it had there would have,

. .=' probably, been a case of cruelty to animals. Here-

’ after he more careful or you may get caught.” i

l . ,
l “I didn’t know there was any harm in letting my »
. dog go for that cat,” replied the astonished man, :

HL‘ DIDN’T KNOW IT.

In Eighth avenue a man was sweeping out his
store. Among the débris were some broken bottles,
which he pushed into the street.

“See that!" exclaimed the superintendent. “Now.
if that broken glass remains on the pavement some
. ,. ‘ horse may step on it and cut his feet. Drive up
, there and tell that grocer to pick up that glass and
'3 not sweep any more into the street. _

E “but. I’ll remember your \\ arning.”

(rt “If you’re caught (icing that asain,” said Suneiin.
E: tendent Hankinson, “you’ll be locked up.” - The
, thunderstruck Storekeeper began to gather up the
E”. fragmentary bottles as last as he knew how, While
E the fatal wagon drove on.

“G0 down to the stock yards now,” said the re.

orter’s companion
Approaching this place the tourists were greeted
b lowing kine hunting for their oil'spring and cry-
int: calves that had become separated in the crowd.
The motherloss calves, whicn were numerous, made
ore racket than a croWd of street arabs. ' ”E '

”We come here regularly.” said the superintend.
out “Our object is to see that no cruelty is done
these animals. Among other things our oihcers care.
fully inspect the stock. and if any cows are found
16ft, unmilked. the owners are required to relieve
them- The oﬂicers also see that the calves without
motherg and the sheep are properly cared for." ‘

“What are all those boy’s and girls with pails doin

“Oh. they are. utter the milk that would otherwise
be wasted- £315 is one ot the regular scenes in the

"We have to look out for every kind of cruelty ‘
3'011 860.” remarked the chief ofﬁcer. “The goats ‘
need protection sometimes as much as other ani-'1'
male." . .

Coming down and across town, the patrol wagon :
encountered a milkman who was driving a. sore
horse. The man tried to make excuses, which'did'
not relieve him from arrest. ‘ He was arraigned ina
police court the next day and held in $300 bail. ‘

KITTENS, Too. . . E

On the return trip and while driving through East .
Thirty-second street, a woman was seen coming out
of her house with four little kittens in her apron.
She dumped the baby eats into an ash barrel and .
covered them up.

"you mustn’t do that,” exclaimed Superintendent
Hanklnson to the woman, n he turned pale when she I
caught sight of him. “ItlS cruel and you are liable
to arrest.”

Then, at the superintendent's instructions, one
of the ofﬁcers dug up the. little pussies, took a bottle
from the wagon’s drug store, and, although they
were nearly smothered, he glnished their career by

     

     
  
  

   

. administering chloroform.

OTHEi‘. wonk on THE SOCIETY.

“You have seen. a part of the work this society and
its oiiicers are doing,” said Superintendent Blankin—
son on. returning :0 headquarters. “The patrol
wagon does not go out every day but four or ﬁve
times a week, and the ofﬁcers always ﬁnd cases on
every tour they make. Our work extends from the

' Battery out to Kingsbridge and into the annexed dis-

trict. We have only one wagon, but that one
serves in doings. great deal of good. Drivers for
market gardeners, coal dealers and other teamsters
are frequently arrested and lined for using sore and
disabled horses. On one of the recent tours eigh<
teen such cases were found and the drivers were
compelled to unhitch and take back their horses,

. and a few of them were arrested and punished.

“The chicken slaughter house down in Grouver—
ncur street is one of the places we watch. The pro-
prietor of it was arrested and ﬁned $10, recently,
for hanging llve chickens up by the legs and leaving
them so {or several hours.” - ‘

BRAKES FOR STAGES.

A complaint, signed “An Englishman,” was re-
cently received by the HERALD saying that the
drivers on the Fifth avenue stages in coming down
the hill from Thirty-sixth street “invariably jerk at
their lines, almost lifting the poor brutes off their
front feet,” and that it was “a wonder the poor
horses had any months left.” The writer of the
complaint recommended brakes.

“The stage company,” said Superintendent Hank-
insozi, who investigated the matter, has already
“commenced to put brakes on their stages at the
suggestion of this society, made some time since.”

Manager Brown, of the stage company, said that
brakes were now in use on some of the vehicles and
that all of them would be supplied with them. ,But
he expressed a doubt as to the effect of the use of.
brakes which, unless thoroughly handled in stop- '
ping and starting, would be worse on the horses
than no brakes at all. .

Still the brakes will be thoroughly tried.

MR. BBBGH IS HBLPLESS.
He Would Stop Vivisection If He Gould,
But the Courts are Against Him.
The embryonic: doctors at the College of
Physicians and Surgeons have been looking

forward for some time to a vivisection, which

is soon to be held in the operating rooms. A
calf is to be the subject. Vivisecti'ons are not
indulged in very often. chieﬂy on accounts of
what the surgeons describe as the stupid
prejudice which some people entertain against
the practice of dissecting living brutes in the
interest of science.

President Henry Bergh, of the Society for the
Prevention of EGruelt-y to Animals, was asked
to-day if he had any power to interfere with
such cases. He said: “ It seems impos-
sible for me to stem the torrent of devilish .
cruelty that runs in the minds of these heart.

less men who roast living animals, tear
them limb from limb and cut them into
pieces, losing all interest in the operation as
soon as the heart of their victim ceases to
throb,because forsooth mankind Will be bene-
ﬁted by the knowledge which they thus gain. ,
of course, they say that the poor beasts are "
under the inﬂuence of anaesthetics, Which.
prevent their feeling pain. I cannot
understand such demonaical brutality. I
have done What I could to arrest it but it
seems impossible. I have sent my agents dis-
guised as students to get ev1dence against the
perpetrators of these crimes against nature,
But?“ has been in vein. The courts invari-
. bly decide in favor of thecoileges; 3

tilting of beasts. Surely vivieection comes
to:thin that prohibition. The college £39111-

a few days: » ago. - The. “driver oi
the horse, a- ‘Washington market ~huckster,
with the common recklessness of New York
teamsters, had tried to drive his horse through
a car on Greenwich street, but had succeeded

glass cutting chishorse so severely that he
was slowly bleeding to death. The main
arteries had been out, and the horse was me-
mentarily growing weaker. Every effort to
, stop the flow of blood failed. A policeman at

was scouted by the bystanders. The
huckster, however, acted on the policem-an’s
suggestion and a call was forthwith sent to
the hospital. House-Surgeon Wedekind an:
swered the call and at once sent an attendant
to procure the necessary instruments. The

were brought, the doctor, with dif—
ﬁculty, secured the main arteries with
two pairs of pincers. ’A silk cord was then

and the work practically completed. Only a
few drops of blood fell to the pavement after
this and the horse was‘pronounced safe.

The hucketer was jubilant and oﬁered Dr.
Wedekind a bank note for his trouble, but
the doctor started toward the hospital at a
rapid gait, waving the grateful man
away. The operation did not consume
ten minutes. A reporter asked the doctor
if it was not unusual for him to treat horses.

“We are actually not expected to do it;

ever, it has happened several times,
and it is a pleasure indeed to
relieve the poor brutee from pain. The driv-
ing in this part of the town is reckless in the
extreme. You cannot walk a half dozen
blocks without seeing a horse ‘on its side

So serious has this casuality among horses

keeping a regular patrol-of veterinary sur-
geons throughout the lower " part of the city

BERGH causes a anesTION.

He Writes a Letter Refusing to Draw Money
' that is Owing 11in].

WASHINGToN', Dec. 1 (Special).——A letter caus-
ing much astonishment was received at the
Treasury Department to-day from New York. It
was signed by Henry Bergh, and it contained a
protest from that celebrated friend of dumb ani-
mals against a statement recently published by
the Register of the ’l‘reaSury, Which showed that
the government was indebted ‘to Mr. Burgh in
the sum of $131.. This account is on record on the
books of the department, and it is the result of
a settlement of Henry Bergh’s accounts as Secre-
tary ofLegat‘lon to Russia in 1865. Mr Bergh (le- ‘
clares that he has no knowledge or recollection ;
of any money due him from the United States '
while he was in the diplomatic service, and he,
therefore, declines to receiwo or draw the
amount. He has been informed that it is now
placed to his credit. The refusal of any one to
take money from the government when it had
expressed willingness to pay was of such rare
occurrence in Treasury experience that the let-
ter of Mr. Bergh created a sensation.
It was passed around as one of the
greatest curiosities of the day. After it 3
had been inspected closely to see if the signature
was genuine, the general Verdict, after numer-
ous expressions of astonishment had been made,
was that a declination to take money on a balance
declared by government bookkeepers was an
evident of extraordinary eccentricity, if not of

 

 

 

mental unsoundness, as the United States Would
have sued and recovered from Mr. Bergh were

the balance declared the other way without re-

‘ ‘gard to Mr. Bergh’s recollection or statements .5:

the matter. The repudiated $131 Will be belt
subject to honest Mr. Berghfiﬂrder. _

one’s refusal to accept $131. , . 5
To a HERALD reporter last evening Mr. Bergh3.
saidz—“I did refuse to take this money because—15:

was audited and settled upon my ‘resignadon, Wthh ,3

A horse is by no means a comical animal to look
at. On the contrary, he is melancholy, With a

at rest as it he were ruminating on something of

* ' I see you are surprised at the condition of
Eclipse, ’-' said Mr. Uncles, the horse-dealer, ‘ ‘ but
heaven bless you, that’s nothing. An animal gave
up the ghost on the ground from sheer starvation
last Monday, and a horse this day week fell down
before he reached the Franklin street car stables

shoot the animal. sell, you may purctlase a coed
horse now and then, but only by chance, just as a.
black-letter man may ﬁnd a rare book in a second-
hand store.” .

5 -‘ May I ask what they do with the animals and
where they come irom ?” _

‘ ‘ Some of the horses you see here really have
pedigrees and are descended from the same grand-
sires as Maud S. 'and J ay—Eye-See. Look at that
beast yonder with two of its legs in the grave. He
is an aristocrat on both sides or the heuse, as you
can see by what is left or his once symmetrical
form. He hurt his chest by a fall ten years ago
and was put in the traces as a carriage horse. He
next descended to a iishman, was then sold to a
fruit peddler, and in a month or two his bones
will be sending malodorous perfumes from New
town Creek. His name was once Fly—by-Night and,
if I remember arlght, he was in the stables of Mr.
Bonner in 1877.” A

On taking a further survey of the ﬁeld the re-
porter saw horses afﬂicted with every conceivable
disease except adiposity. Some of them had no
teeth,» many were devoid of an eye, and one at least
was as blind as Belisarius "when he begged pen-
nies on the streets of Rome, though its owner swore
it was only sleepy.

Trouble arose between two peddlers near the
stables about 3 o'clock. A gypsy had bought a horse
from a German for $3, but found it would not go,
and wanted his money back. This the vendor re-
fused, and a light was the result, with consider-
able loss of blood.

‘ ‘ Well, look here, Pete,” said another seeing
his horse was about to die, “ before I give Ihim for
$2 I’ll shoot him,“ and making a virtue of necessary
he suited the action to the word, and put a bullet
through the horse’s head, thus relievmg the poor
beast from heat and cold, fatigue and hunger, and
sending it to a sweet. eternal sleep. ‘

f‘ The market is a great nuisance to the locality, ”
said John G. Porter, the builder, of No. 405 Macon
street, “ and actually depreciates real estate.
Some of us have tried now and again to put an end
to it or have it removed further out, but to no use.
The ﬁghting and swearing carried on there are aw-
ful, especially towards the close.”

ri‘he market is popular with the saloons in front
of it, Which derive a roaring trade irom the dealers
on Tuesdays and Fridays. The feed stores also
favor it, but to the bulk of the residents of the lo-
cality it is an eyesore. The men employed in the
Franklin avenue ear stables also long for its com-
ing, as they can see the inn from their gates.

“ The wonder to me is,” said Mr. Phelps, at real-
estate agent, “ that the Society for the Prevention
oi Cruelty to Animals does not send its agents to
visit the market. They would ﬁnd plenty of work

 

5 ﬁning their owners. ”

some one would take it away from her by lOI‘Qe.

Her eyelids were red and swollen from recent
weeping and her checks were tear-stained. Every,
few minutes she would glance at the pluslrcoverea

rears would course down her face. _ 1

one was Mrs. Funny Sickels, of No. 52 Great

g-iaiued were the lifeless bodies or lwo pet canary

birds, who were ruthlessly murdered on Sunday

When Lllo case was called Mrs. Sickels told her ’

evident distress. He asked in his sler’nest tenes it

SUPEKINTENDENT HANKINSON INDIGNANT.
“in all the ﬁlteen years of my experience in the
business,” said Superintendent. Hanklnson, ol’ the
Society formic Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, to
a TELEGRAM reporter, “I never saw a woman so
aﬂ‘ected by the loss of pets‘as Mrs. Slc’kl’es was When
she came to the ollloe this morning, to give. me the
facts in regard to the mutilation and ‘de’at‘l’r of her
two canary birds. She cried as though her heart
would break, and said they were we 1 only friends
she had in the world. 1 _ . 1
“We shall certainly do all we can to punish the
miscreant, whoever he or 1. she maybe, but ‘1 am
afraid it will be difﬁcult to gel; the necessary proof,
as even the carving knife Lhatwas stained with the
blood of one of the birds is now said to be missing.
She seems certain that the "Van Zandt woman did it,
and she may yet, be able to prove ; 1t. 1L1was a

Mrs. Pearson’s boarding-house at No. 52 (lreal;i
Jones street, came into the Court of Special Seah-
ions yesterday to prosecute Inez Van Zandt for
the killing of her two pet oauarles, Katydld and
Billy. Mrs. Slolrles was clad in deep mourning,
and tears coursed down her face as she clasped to
her bosom the tiny plush~covered, silver-bound
casket she had brought into court a week ago when
" she made her original complaint. The plush—and-
silver could contained the remains of Katydld,
While in her pocket Mrs. elc'lzles had a crystal bortle "
in. which the twin singer Billy was preserved in
alcohol. Ellie mourned for her canaries as a mother 3
would it the loudest or her children were when
Irom her by death. °

While waiting for the case to be called she sobbed
quietly. and ever and anon her handkerchief was
pressed to her face to wipe away the tears that
had been falling steadily. for nearly a week since
she made the original complaint. Sue had made

with all his vigor. When Presiding Justice Solon ‘

with having cruelly slaughtered and quartered the i
? oauaries, is a dark-haired damsel with a decidedly
handsome face. There was a sort of a sneer on 1161'
features all through the proceedings and she was
not moved in the slightest manner until she heard
that she Was doomed to the penitentiary.

there are many which relate that when the-

, the world. One of these stateS, ,

ELord had created Adam and Eve, he stationed

‘ beast, giving it strict orders not to give a
‘ E mittance to the Evil .One. But the Ev11 One came
1 E E to the gates of Paradise, and threw the dog a piece
, ’of bread, and the dog then let the EVII One mtO
E Paradise. Then the Evil One set to work and spat
‘ 1- over Adam and Eve, and covered them all over

7 I with spittle from the head to the little toe of the E

1- E left foot. 80 Adam and Eve were turned out of
3‘ Paradise, and the Lord said unto the dog: Listen,

5 E 0! Dog, thou wer’t a dog (Sobaka), a cleap beast; ‘
Ethrough all Paradise the most holy did st thou}

E Essay on the Russian Popular Epos.” .
, Another tradition states that the dog was orig-
7 inally naked, t'. 6., without hair, but the Dem],

in order to seduce it from. its loyalty, gave it a _

E 3 coat of hair. Now, taking it for granted that this
’ “ legend and tradition is true, it seems that our an-

'” That the Lord must have had great conﬁdence
E in the dog when he placed him in such a respon-
" sible position as guarding the gates of Paradise:

E “Es a at that time this was probably the only dog, and ‘

E’E‘j, when the Devil gave him the bread he fell.
’ Now it is evident that from this dog our pres-

se the dog, then a clean -

 

.f ent race of dogs are all descended, and that like

Ea“:- f‘E the race of man they have one common ancestor.
‘ Again, this legend settles forever the long-dis-x
. "L. puted question as to the origin of the dog; forE

E E we ﬁnd at the gates of Paradise a dog, and that dog E

a hound ; so hereafter let it be the verdict of all i
{ doggy men that in the beginning there was a dog, Q
;and that that dog was a hound; and it is, I aml
r. .3 E scrry to say, an open question as to the kind of a i
E % hound, but the hound men can claim the ﬁrst E
“=1 1 dog, and I leave to the different hound clubs the E
P Esprivilege of settling this question among them-E
E selves. I E
a? Now, if the dog had only let the bread alone E

“ Issa’s more full of sport and wanton play
Than that pet sparrow by Catullus sung.
Issa’s more pure and cleanly in her way
Than kisses from the amorous turtle’s tongue.

“ Issa more Winsome is than any girl
That ever yet entranced a lover’s sight.
Issa’s more precious than the Indian pearl ;
Issa’s my Publius, favorite and delight.

“ Her plaintive voice falls sad as one that weeps;
Her master’s cares and woes alike she shares.
Softly inclined upon his neck she sleeps,
And scarce to sigh or draw her breath she dares.

“ When Nature calls she modestly obeys,
Nor on the counterpane one drop will shed.
But warns her lord, with gentle foot, and prays
That he will raise and lift her from the bed.

“ So chaste is she, of contact so afraid,
She knows not Venus rites, nor do we ﬁnd
A husband worthy of such dainty maid.
’Mong all the clamorous suitors of her kind.

“ Her, lest the day of fate should nothing leave
In pictured form my Publius hath portrayed.
Where, you so lifelike Issa might perceive
That not herself a better likeness made.

“‘ Issa, together with her portrait lay,
Both real, or both depicted, you would say.”

3 sheep and calves from the stock yards to the

death for creatures awaiting slaughter. Over half a

What nonsense to trammel genius by ironclad rules, or
ure its accomplishments by its years.

Schiller wrote “The Robbers” when he was fourteen, and in ,
consequence was disciplined in the military school that he at--‘
tended. The Duke of Suabia branded his budding genius as a“
creation of hell, the incarnation of indecency, and locked the boy
up for a few days as penance. The duke meanwhile ruined his ‘.
treasury, and sold his people” to the English in order to provide
funds for the fascinating Mme. Von Hohenheim.

If there had been a Mr. Gerry in former days, would (30le
have written for us at twelve ; would Byron, Shelley, Burns, 3.
‘ Raphael,have accomplished so muchin the thirty-seven years they ,i
lived? Would Schiller have been as great at forty as Goethe
‘12. was at eighty, _ or would they have been throWn into a “ reform- ,i

‘ atory,” where it would have been a sin to think, and and where fig
.1 '« they would have been forced to devote their talents to beating it,
' the unconscious walls or making companions of their trained
rats ? , 3,;
Can I call Mr. Gerry’s attention to lesser lights in precocious- 23:1
ness? Did not William Wotton, the boy bachelor, enter Cam- 2
', bridge at ten, and secure his B. A. degree at twelve. , He died at {
3 sixty. - Robert Hall when but seven preached such sermons that
V crowds were held spellbound, and he pursued the indiscretion
until his death at sixty-seven.

In the name of St. Nicholas, the boy bishop, and in the name If.
of outraged common sense, I protest against the continuance of 7g
f such concrete imbecility as the Hofmann case has brought to the 2'
_ surface, against the perpetration of such malignant insults to i

manhood and sobriety. As Schiller’s Duke of Suabia ruined his
' country for his hobby, a mistress, so Mr. Gerry would debauch
_ talent for a worse hobby, and it seems to be his ambition to give
some future Longfellow the subject for another Golden Legend 3

hold did he take of the public sense of
right that it is impossible that his work
shall not be continued. He has made
too many converts to render it at all likely
that this commonwealth will ever relapse
into a condition to Witness cruelty to ani-
mals Without resentment He had the
courage to put a noble sentiment into act-
ive fume, and the man Who loved his fel—
low animal is mourned by his fellow men.

The Eminent Philanthropist’s Career—The ‘
Son of an American Shipbuilderu-His- j
tory of the s. P. C. A.

Henry Bergh. the president and founder of
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Ani- ‘1
male, died at his home, 429 Fifth avenue, New Y ork,
yesterday morning. He had entered several years .
from chronic dyspep—ia. Mr. Barge was born in >
New York in 1823. His {other was Christian Borgh,
a. man or German ancestry, and one of the most '
“prominent American shipbuilders or his era. Chris-
tian was a native of the Empire State and dwell. for
many years in New York City, and here, at the age ‘

, of 83, he died, leaving to his three. children

the comfortable fortune which he had accumu-'
Jared. During the later years of his life his sons ',
Henry and Edwin became partners in his business. .
A large piece of land bordering on the East River ;
in that portion of the city which is now known as .
the Seventh Ward was formerly his property, and '
more in 1810, at the foot of Gouverneur street, he

started his shipyard. Among the famous vessels I;
built under his direction Was the President—41111 '

ﬁxes the time and manner for slaughtering ani-
male for food. :30 thorough is its work that cases of

cruelty 1’10 animals wherever it exiends are rare in-

deed, for its punishment to such offenders is swift '

and sure. From the inception of the society Mr. -
Bergh received no salary and devoted his time to ,
its interests without accepting monetary return of

any kind.

In 1871 Louis Bonard, a. Parisian who lived quietly
for some years in New York, died and in his will
left $150,000 to the society, which enabled the di-

d....-.4_‘

restore to purchase the present headquarters at the

corner of Twenty-second at not ﬁnd , Fourth avenue.

in the meantime the humanizing inﬂuence of the
Son iety for the Prevention of Crueliy to Animals .
had been steadily spreading; Stare after State
adopted the laws drafted by 111'. Bergu for the New '

York Legislature, until now nearly all held themw

upon their statute books. The Argentine Republic -,
and Brazil have also enacted similar laws. During ~'
1873. Mr. Bergh made a lecturing tour in the .

West, which resulted in theiormation of a num-
ber of socreties similar to the original one in New
York. He addressed the EVangelical Alliance and

the Episcopal Convention and was the means of '
having anew canon conﬁrmed to the effect‘that .

Protestant Episcopal clergymen should at least

once a year devote a. sermon to the sin of cruelty to .

animals. Several appliances to aid injured or dis-

eased animals were invented by Mr. Bergh. The ‘

ambulance wagon for the removal of disabled
horses andaderrick for their rescue irom street
encavauons are among them. Having had his at.-

reunion drawn‘to the brutal sport of live pigeon '
shooting. one of the means that be employed to .-

suppress it, in addition to the forces of the law, was
the invention of an i xgeniously constructed artiﬁcial
bird, which answers every requisite as a mark for

“1-... .._.

the sportsman’sgun. Another association to whose :

credit thousandsof good works stand—the Society

for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children—owes its -

origin to Henry Burgh. In 1874 he arrested is. man

foiiznnumanely treating a. little girl, and that inci-' .
dent led :to the inundation of the Society for the '-

Prevention of Cruelty to Children. By the courtesy
of the Diet-riot Attorney of New York Mr. Burgh was
altnorized by the Attorney General to represent
nim'iu all cases appertaining to the laws for the
protection of animals. .80 he held thoomceof as-

sistant district attorney till his dear-h. Although

his life was a.» most active one he managed to ﬁnd
time in whichto indulge his literary inclinations.
He wrote several plays, one of which was produced
in Philadelphia, and in addition to this he published
a. volume of tales and sketches, entitled “The

Streets of New York.” It owes the friend of the
dumb brat-ether. ' Mr. Bergn was been known to the -*
public. When he started his society he wasim- ‘

polled to take the stop, he said, by witnessing the
cruelty practiced on animals in Russia. Up on his
return to this country he went to Albany and asked
for the necessary legislation, which was readily
granted, a tact which caused Mr. ‘Bergh to regret
that he had not asked for more, for when he needed
more it was not so easily obtained.

Through all his career Mr. Bergh was the per-
sistent opponent of vaccination and inoculation,
and he never missed an Opportunity to denounce
such men as Jenner and Pasteur. He Opposed v15,
isection, too and was coasts. .tly in a wrangle with
the doctors 01 or it. He broke up dog ﬁghting and
cook ﬁghting in the City of New York and waged re-
leutless warfare against pigeon shooting, fox hunt-
ing and kindred sports. He had a poor opinion of
the disciples of 1311111: Walton and often declared
that ﬁshermen were natural liars. It was largely
through his exerts that clay pigeons came into use,

and the drivers throughout the city soon came to
know and rho-specs him. “ I: is not the poor,” he

~—

Henry Bergh, the well—known philan thro-
phist, died yesterday at his home, 429 Fifth ave- ;
nue, New York. For some time past he has been
suffering from a complication of diseases and his
death was not unexpected. His end was calm and
peaceful.

Mr. Bergh was born in New York in the year 1823.
His father was Christian Bcrgh, a man of German
ancestry, and one ofthe most prominent American
ship builders of his era. Christian was a native of
the Empire State and dwelt for many years in New
York City, and here, at the age of 83, he
died, leaving to his three children the comfortable
fortune which he had accumulated. During the
later years of his life his sons Henry and Edwin
became partners in his business.

A large piece of land bordering on the East River
in that portion of the city which is now known as
the Seventh Ward was formerly his property. and
there in 1810, at the foot of Gouverneur street, he
Started his shipyard. Among the famous vessels
built under his direction was the President—rthc
American frigate which in the war of 1812 sun
passed all previous records for great speed, besides
doing splendid work as a man-o’-war. After win-
ning a number of engagements the President was

 

ﬁnally outmatched and captured by the English,
Who took her over to the other side and for many
years used her as a model from which to build their
line~of4battle ships. In 1842 Henry and Edwin
Bergh dissolved partnership, and their shipyard
was broken up.
. His family being possessed of means, Henry
Bergh got an excellent education, which be com-
pleted at. Columbia. College. Before reaching the
end of his course be made a visit to Europe,
remaining there about five years. Before depart-
ing he married Miss Taylor. daughter of a wealthy
Englishman residing in New York. While in
,Europe, in 1862, he was appointed Secretary of
‘, Legation at St. Petersburg and Acting Vice-Consul.
2 Being possessed of I a delicate constitution, he was
_ obliged. by reason 0f the great severity of the cli-
4 mate, to resign this ofﬁce in 1864, after which he
; made a tour of Europe and traveled extensively
f in the East. He became interested in the subject
of prevention of cruelty to animals while livingiu
1‘ St. Petersburg, and, later on, this interest was
, greatly increased through an acquaintance with
3 the Earl of Harrowby, President of the Royal So-
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in

London. When Mr. Bergh founded his society he

modeled it almost entirely after the English one.
1 On his return to New York he determined to do
vote the remainder of his life to the interests of
dumb animals, and at once began the formation of
plans to organize an American Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

This society was instituted in 1865, with Mr.
Bergh as President, and in 1866 statutes were
passed by which the society was invested with
those powers of prosecution and arrest which it
still holds. Its founder met with tremendous op-
; pOSition in his work, and both he and his society
’._ were made the marks of unceasing ridicule and
l abuse, but by untiring personal labors and liberal
., use of his own resources Mr. Bergh at last carried
T his point and won the support and respect of the
3‘ community. From that time the society has
. steadily advanced, gaininga large and inﬂuential
i membership, making friends everywhere and re-
ceiving many gifts, until today it stands a recog-
nized power for well~doing throughout the country.
. The workof the society covers all cases of cruelty
.- tooall sorts of animals. It employs every moral
. agency, social, personal and legislative; it deals
.1 with the health of the community as well as with

 

...._ .. u. 4...... .2. .

, I humane practices ; it looks after the transporta-

gﬂtion of cattle intended {or market; it examines
into the purity of milk and ﬁxes the time and
;manncr of slaughtering animals for food. So
thorough is its work that. cases of cruelty to ani-
" mals wherever it extends _ are rare indeed. for its
punishment to such olfcnclxjrs is swift and sure.
‘ From the inception of the society Mr. Burgh re-
lceived no salary and devoted his time to its
interests without accepting monetary return of
‘ any kind.

on the day of his death, when agents of his '3
society stopped street cars and ordered men

equipment for his work. It is not likely

VENTION OF CRUELTY T0: ANIMALS.
The death of Henry Bergh. who has been
so long and universally known as the defender
of abused animals, occurred yesterday morning
at about 5 o’clock at his residence, 429 Fifth.-
avenue. For several months, in, fact Since the
death of his wife in June last, ‘Mr. Bench has
been gradually failing. He suffered from chronic j
bronchitis and enlargement of - the heart. and E
although he was 1 out last Tuesday for a f
short time he was then very feeble and ﬁnally ‘
succumbed to his disease yesterday morinng.
There were present at his bedside his three
nephews, Edwin Bergh, Henry Bergh, Jr., and
Willie C. Bergh, sens of his brother, Edwin -
Bergh. and his physician, Dr. Henry F. Walker. 3
His nephews had relieved each other in watch-
ing during the night, but at about 3:30 o’clock '
his condition changed decidedly for the worse

and Dr. Walker was summoned. I'Owing to the '-
storm he was unable to get to the house until 15 ,
minutes before Mr. Bereh’s death. Mr. Bergh i
had then become unconscious, although three. l
quarters of an hour before he had said distinctly l,
and Without any yielble excitement, “I am f2
dying.” . ~ 5

No arrangements have as yet been madefor
the funeral, which will, however, take place
enher Thursday or Friday. Mr. Bomb, though
not a member of any church, was an Episcopal-
ian. The burial will be at Greenwood. Only a few
relatives are llvmg, his sister-1n-law. Mrs. Ed-
win Bergh, his three nephews already men-
tioned. andhis nieces, Miss Emily H. Berlin and
Miss Mathilda Brown,-daughter of his sister.
Mrs. Jane Brown. '

Henry Bergh was born in the city of New-
York in 1823. lilo father, Christlan Bergh, was
a shipbuilder, at the foot of Market-street, who
built many vessels for the United States Gov~
eminent. Henry entered Columbia, but failed
to ﬁnish his course. - Instead, he made a. visit to
Europe, where he remained for ﬁve years. He
married, wnlle young, 9. Miss Taylor. daughter of
English parents. In 1862 Mr. Bench was ap-
pomted Secretary of Legatlon at St. Petersburg.
and began there that acclveinterference in be-
half of the right of animals to kind treatment
which has earned for him a worldwide
reputation. In 1864 he resigned his ofﬁce on
account or ill health owmg to the severity of
the climate. On his way home he traveled ex- _
tenslvely through Eurbpe. and in England made
the acquaintance of the Earl or Harrowby, then
President of the Royal Society for the Preven-
tion of Cruelty to Animals. He then determined
to devote the remainder-of his life to the .inter— r.
ests of dumb animals, and On his return to the
United States, alone, in the face of indiﬁ‘crence,
opposition, and ridicule, he began a reform that
is now recognized as one of the greatest boned.
cent movements of the age.

. It was in 1864 that Mr. Bergh returned to
New-York, and he spent a. year in maturing his
plans for the establishment of means to check
and prevent cruelty to animals. In 1865 he 3
founded the American Society for the Preven-
tion of Cruelty to Animals and became its Presi~
dent, an ofﬁce which he has held continuously ._
until his death. In 1866 the society was given

by the Legislature the powers of prosecution

and arrest which it now possesses and by the

aid of which so many dumb animals have been

protected. It is not to be supposed, how”

ever, that Mr. Bergh obtained these powers with. f
ease. People failed to realize the importance, '
to say nothing of the humanity, of the cause he
espoused; but through his exertions as a speaker
and lecturer, and as a. bold worker in the street,
in the court room, and before the Legislature of
the State, he gained many friends and. rapidly
The Legislature passed
the laws prepared by him, and, April 10, 1866,
the society Was legally organized, although it ‘
had practically been in existence for ayc‘ar ‘
previously. The association moved on steadily, ,
and, aided by valuable gifts from Mr. and Mrs. '
Bergn, was, by August of that year. on a sound V
ﬁnancial basis. .

Mr. Bergh was not slow tolnake the inﬂuence
of his socxety felt in New-rork, and there are
many people who can recall the ﬁrst _lnstance
when he set its machinery in motion. One :
blustery Winter's night about 6 o’clock, when
the slush in the streets was ankle deep and sleet
and hail ﬁlled theair, he. with a. number of his 3
men, concentrated their forces at what was .
then Ch‘atham—street. but is now known as Park- S
row. Here, as is well known, half a dozen ;
horse car lines meet. and Henry Bergh gave
orders toteke from the tracks every horse that
had an ailment or a sore. The condition of the
wretched animals attached to the cars at that
time was notoriously bad. and the consequence 3
was that the society’s men found plenty of ;
work. which virtually resulted in 3. blockade of L
the lines for several hours. There were no 3
elevated roads, and thousands of people had to j
foot 11: up town In the rain and the slush, :
growling, cursing. hunErY. W63. and mad. “Who .
did this?” was the a-nzry question asked on all ‘
sides, and to this came but one reply. “ Bergh,’.’
and the public at last discovered that he and his '
society had ﬁdevclopod into a. mighty power.
The famous “ turtle” case was another instance
of the society's labors for the prevention of our ‘

1t .

o 85o the society. under Mr. Bergh’s until-ins:
management and ceaseless vigilance, went on
with the good work in which it was engaged. In
1871 a 3 Parlexan, Louis Bonard, who had ac— ‘
cumulatcd afortune trading with the Indians,
and who lived With extreme simplicity in New—
York. died and left the society a. bequest of
$150000. This valuable gift enabled the society -
to remove from Broadway and. Fourth-street to
quarters larger and better adapted to the work.
and the‘prcscnt commodious building at the
corner or Fourth—avwne and Twenty-second-

blue eyes. He was generally classed as an odd».

work” rather than overestimate it.» The up—
parent tendency is, while giving him credit for
; great achievements, to lay undue stress upon

observation of a'similar work in England. it

its origin. It is due to his labors, his en-

Your article on the late Henry Bergh, the philan-

much pleasure to-day, and I heartily agree with
you that he should have an enduring monument in

that good man, Mr. Henry Bergh. W110 30 Well de-

POOT‘. defenseless ’animals, but a friend to every-

enemies were those who maltreated the poor, de-
ienseless animals, and hisearnestness in bringing
them to Justice was untiring. THE WORLD is the

[his last resting place the man whose
long life had been devoted to caring for and
;protecting their kind. It was the body of
’Henry Bergh that was thus conveyed

: through the snow drifts from his home on ’
3 Fifth avenue to the churchyard from which

; the bones of A. T. Stewart were stolen years
gago. The funeral was not so remarkable
,for the size of the throng that attended

_ assisted by a staff of ofﬁcers of the society in
' full uniform and with badges draped. In-
‘ specter Byrnes, with Detective Sergeants
._‘. Hickey and Lauthier, directed the police.

, Just before the hearse arrived a young girl :
l leading a small Spitz dog came up to the gate ,
:leading into the churchyard, and asked if,
\she could enter the church With the dog. .

f She was allowed to do so.

There were no services at the house.

11*‘riends called and looked upon the wasted

lface of the dead philanthropist, but there;

i were no further ceremonies.

‘ The hearse reached the church at 10.30,

promptly and the dark covered casket was
, borne into the ediﬁce on the shoulders of SIX
‘ ofﬁcers of: the S. P. C. A. in full uniform. As
' it moved up the aisle the solemn tones oi:
"The Dead March in Saul” weroheard.

Directly behind the casket iollowed the
. pallbearers. They were:

however. They represented all conditions of life.
including the soldier, clergyman, journalist, phy-
sician, laWyer, merchant, politician, judge, police.
man, actor, manager, showman, railroad man,
banker, club man, horseman, the man who dees
nothing and the man who does everything.

A great pooling of hearts.

A “trust" of human sympathies bendiugin sorrow
before the grave of the philanthropist. '

The body was carried up the aisle, preceded by
the Rev. Dr. Dix and the Rev. Brockhoist Morgan,

best, his relatives and the society which he founded.
The uniformed ofﬁcers of the society were repre-
sented by a “broken shaft” of white roses. A pillow
ot‘ violets and white roses, bearing the word “Hu-

reuse and carriages Were driven with difﬁculty:

up to the hubs. Inthc streets about St. Mark’s 1 t
the snow was piled in monumental heaps. which" ‘
almost hid the procession from View. .,

The rosewood and black broadcloth covered
cofﬁn was carried into the central vestibule by
SIX ofﬁcers of the American Society for the Pre-
vention of Cruelty to Animals—Alonzo S. Evans,
W. G. Smart, G. H. Lambert, D. Seymour;
George Drew, and John Cowcy. They were in ' .
uniform and were craps. The tap of . the
coﬁin was hidden by fresh ﬂowers, oﬁ‘srings
brincipally from nephews and nieces. There
was no elaborate display, owing: toarcquest' "
made by Mr. Bergh during his illness. Prominent; ‘ /
was a wreath, composed largely of tuberoses
and Easter lilies, to which was attached the
photograph of a noble—looking St. Bernard dog, 2
on the back of which was written “ Sampson’s ‘
bestiriend—ll’? Clinton-strect.Brooklyn.” There
was also a wreath from P. T. Barnum.

The pail bearers were Mayor Hewitt, Elbridge ;

A LIFE WELL SPENT-

vaheMESSENGER does not intend to

the death of Henry Bergh, the
philanthropist, go unnoticed. Our
'legraphlc dispatches have given a
{{very unsatisfactory sketch of his life
, and labors, but this was due to causes
" ich are readily understood. Even
the material for a just notice
his good man’s ca1 eer are not
table, but Stlll we can pay him, 1n
perfect measure only, the tribute
' "ﬁsh 1s his due.

AABergh was secretary of the

 

An behalf of animals. His indignation ;
,' was excited on Witnessmg the cruelty ;
Russian peasants

He was a man of

as strong to say “as tender as a true

“gentle”—man’s. He seems to have been
‘ inspired at this time to undertake the

noble work to which he subsequently
and his warfare

against human brutality, and his de- ’4

' 1 fense of “our dumb animals,” entitle

3111111 to a dist1nguished place among '3
g'genulne philanthropists.
" cule,-despite insult, despite opposition ,

Desp1terid1- ,
from the brutal and depraved, and'
the discouragement of those who re-
garded him foolishly as a sort of

‘f harmless imbecile, he devoted himself "
:14) his life- work, and lived to see the ‘-

day when his virtues and his zeal were ;
recognized 1n generous measure. A"
The MESSENGER has always been a '-
annch friend of our dumb ammals, 1
1;? A- 1h often put humanity to shame

by them ﬁdelity, their affection and g
It has never failed to ‘
take up the cudgel in their behalf

  

, whenever the occasion demanded that

they should be championed. It re- .
Jelces, therefOre, that Mr. Bergh lived
toffeee the day when the sympathies of '

allhumane men were enlisted with him i
1 and his co-adjutors in their

war
"upon that besotted and contemptible

, sentiment whlch regards dumb brutes
' asworth‘y of no protection, but rather

as the legitimate objects of cruelty.

It was assuredlya life worth living
'qwhich could impress humanity with

the conviction that the nobler princi-

 

 

l
l
l
l

bias of the law demand the protection ,
of- the brute and stand in his defense
‘against the ignorance and viciousness
.of , depraved men. And it is also .

g'jhleasant to think that Mr. Bergh’s
igjteachings will'live after him; that he .
iwon public sentiment completely, and ,1
lthathis work will go on effectually un-
1‘11“ 'very State 1n the Union will have

statutes, and enforce them, prevent-f

Gerry was not born on that plane. He was born
where daily bread is something to be tossed into the
swill barrel.

What he wants is cake!

The organization for the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals meant much. .

The potencies in its hand are something tre-
mendous, and very few people thoroughly understand
their extreme scope. It is not too much to say, nay-e

‘ is it not a tribute to the good man whose body has but

this moment been laid among the dead?—that the ner‘

, sonah'ty of Henry Bergh himself aided legislators to
. come to a. conclusion that unusual and tremendous
; powers could be safely, and without fear of abuse, be
' entrusted to that organization. On my table I ﬁnd a

. manual
. and I was struck with
' bination
1 this

of the corporation published in 1869,
the tremendous com-
appearing as ' officers of
the society is

of names

matters of arrest; that it can appear by its President as
a. prosecuting olﬁcer, representing the dignity, the
County and the State precisely as the District Attorney;
that it can say to you, to me or any other man “ tak i
that horse out of the shafts, take him to your stable; ‘
that it can take your horse, and therefore your prop.
erty, from you, and destroy it absolutely; that it can
halt the ongoing procession upon our surface roads,
and can compel, if confronted by a power too great
for its own inherent strength to overcome, the aid and
comfort of the entire police of the city, it becomes of
interest to know in whose hands the society, with its
prerogatives and its privileges and its dignities, shall
fall.

They were safe in the hands of Henry Bergh.

Would they be safe in the hands of a man whose
vanity might lead him into zeal, not tempered with
discretion .9

Look with me for a moment at the names associated
with that of. Henry Bergh. The Vice-Presidents were

I John T. Hoffman, Horace B. Claflin, Benjamin D.

, Hicks, Henry W. Bellows, Peter Cooper,

James

. Brown, George T. Trimball, William H. Aspinwall,

Moses Taylor, Marshall 0. Roberts. ‘

Who were they ?

Well, I can quite understand how men, to whom the
mysteries and miseries of New York are a sealed book,

I could ask that question, but men here don’t need to be

told that that list of names represents a mountain of
humanity, aworld of commercial enterprise, a gold

mine of wealth, and an all-embracing social inﬂuence,

which for more than half a century dominated the
city, and therefOre the country. It is not that Claiiin,
Cooper, Brown, Taylor, Roberts were worth in the
aggregate more than $100,000,000 ; representing
in trace and commerce adventures of tremendous

The Work
' . Lives After Him.

“4...; m?

 

Superintendent Charles H. Hankinson, of the So-
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, was

the society at Fourth avenue and Twenty-second
street recently when a lady entered leading a. child
by the hand. .

“I called in to notify you,” said the lady address-
ing Mr. Hankinson, "that there is a little dog lying
in the areaway of a. house in Twenty-fourth street,
near Fourth avenue. The dog is apparently halt
tarnished, and if not looked after will certainly die.
There is nobody living in the house, and the dog
doubtless strayed there from some other neighbor-
hood.” ‘

the lady; “we shall attend to the matter at once."

Then heturned to an” oﬁiccr of the society and
calm—"Go to that house in Twenty-fourth street,
please, get that dog and bring him down here.”

THE PROGRESS or REFORM.

A HERALD reporter happened to be in the oiﬁce at
the time this occurred, and to him the Superin-
tendent said :~- -

the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
has accomplished in the treatment of dumb , brutes.
There was a time when the society couldn’t attend
to such matters. It had greater evils to contend
against and conquer. And as it succeeded in these
it gradually turned its attention to other matters,
that some people might call lesser, and is now meet-
ing with success in that direction, too."

Then the Superintendent fell into a. reﬂective
mood. '

THINGS THAT WERE. . ,

“Have you ever remarked,” he said, “the superior
condition generally of the horses in this city nowa-
days? We have not in these days the disgusting ex-
hibitions of cruelty and brutality that disgraced
civilization a quarter of a century ago.
see lame horses dragging heavily loaded trucks or
cars new. You seldom hear of men brutally beat-
ing their horses. People are no longer sickened by
the spectacle of horses covered with bleeding, fes-
tering sores. The cattle yards are better and cleaner
and healthier than they ever were. The swill milk
stables are gone. Dog ﬁghts and cook ﬁghts are not

as numerous as they were, and there is even an ole
merit of humanity in the brutal sport of pigeon
shooting. ' ‘

“I have no hesitation in affirming that this changed
condition of affairs is wholly due to the labors of
- the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Ania
mals.
a reform. and I am sure the public will bear me out
in the statement that its efforts have been crowned
with success.

CASES IN POINT.

“Just let me instance some phases of cruelty that
were very common 11]. this city in the early days ot
the society, but which are very rarely heard of.
now»—

“What an ordinary spectacle it once was to see a
horse dragging a heavily laden ‘cart or truck fall
from sheer'exhaustion in the street! And the brutal
driver would take a. rung from his cart and beat the .
pour animal in the most horrible manner about the
head and body. That spectacle is very rare in these
days. Drivers of horses are particular now not to
overload their trucks. and they think a good deal, if
the horse happens to fall, before using a cart rung
on him. ,

“You remember, too, how certain dealers in poul-
trv used to go through the streets carrying fowl by
the legs and letting their heads draz along the side.

city in crates. '
“Bit burrs are not quite as numerous now as they ‘-

were some years ago. They were quite a ‘fad’ in

society once. They were made of leather about

studded with long, sharp tacks. These burrs were
fastened to the bit and placed on each side of the

agony to the horse. but they Ipleased society be-

I give and bequeath to my friend, Elbridge,

“Henry Bergh, the late President of the Soci— ,
ety for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, was
sometimes accused,” said District Attorney Fellows, .,
in his eulogy of him at the Court of General Ses-
3 sions, “of going to extremes, but extreme measures 7
' are necessary to accomplish extreme results. Let
3 any one compare the present with the past. of i.
4, twenty-ﬁve years ago in regard to the treatment of g

dumb beasts and he can appreciate the work that
5, Henry Bergh has done. A nobler, more humane

5 mission, save one—the Society for the Prevention
, of Cruelty to Children—was never organized in

i§from the time of its inception. A man of inde-
pendent means who gives his time, his talents,‘h18
3 money, to the praiseworthy objects to which Mr.

; Bergh devoted himself deserves the warmest eulogy '
There is hardly marble ‘

3" White enough on which to write his name and ‘

hair, combed puritanically straight and smooth.
and his Yankee-cut, cadaverous face harmonized
well with the whole physique. He was always very

 

ministerial style, with high standing collar—a dig-
niﬁed, cavalier-looking gentleman, and so tall and ’
emphatic in personal bearing he seemed a. ﬁtting 5

. target for all eyes on the street and just the ﬁgure I,

to call forth the question, "" Who is he ‘2 ” When ,
he spoke his eyes would light up and the whole face

 

assume an expression of kindliness.

Bequest, to the Society—A Mistak‘eﬁndnngens
(.ertalu Legacies to Relatives.

The will of Henry Bergh, founder Of the ,4
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Ani-
mals, was ﬁled yesterday. It was made in 1874.
when Mr. Bergh’s wife was living. The will is
regular in form. but two codicils, made ten and
twelve years later, strangely enough for so
methodical a man. were not witnessed bY tWO
persons; as required by law. It is not unlikely. 1
however, that the obvious wishes of the testator -
will be observed by the other legatees. !

.Mr. Born]; in his will leaves to the society his 2

l

interest in 92 Warren street, valued at $26,000. ’
He gives to his nephew. Henry Bergh, son of

his brother Edwin, all his, personal. apparel and
his watch and jewelry. The residue of his
estate_(h‘e had a. good deal of city real estate. 3
part or 11: tenement house property) he leaves 1
1n equal shares to Edwin Bergh’s surviving
children. subiect to the dower Of the testator’s
wife. Catherine Matilda. He leaves " to my
friend. Elbridge T. Gerry, my Russian painting
in 91!. 'A Nymph on the Sea. Shore,’ as a slight
testimonialol my sincere regard for him, and
of my high appreciation of his great profes-
sional services to the cause of brute protec-
tion.” He makes his wife his executrix,_and
h1g5 nephews, Edwin and Henry, his executors.

l‘he codlcil of J an. 30, 1884. witnessed by
Superintendent Hankinson of the society, is as
follows: “' .

To Henry Bergh, my nephew and namesake. before
mentioned, I give all and singular my furniture. Works
of art. jewelry, clothing. and all other persOnnl effects.

While so doing, I affectionately and earnestly request
him to devote the remainder of his life to the humane
work in which the society founded by me in this our be-
loved country is engaged.

Recognizing his pas. fidelity to the cause of protect—

ing the inferior animals from cruelty and abuse. I pray '

him in the discharge of his ofﬁcial duties—should he be
appointed to succeed inc—ever to exercise zeal tem-
pered with discretion and justice mingled with forbear-
ance: and may God continue to prosper the sacred and
civilizing work. ' ‘

The second cod1cil. dated Feb. 8. 1886, and
Similarly w1tnessed. 13:

To the three daughters of my late nephew, Edwin B.
Brown. namel . Jennie P. Brown, Agnes M. Brown, and
Florence Berg Brown, I give the sum of ten thousand
dollars. proportioned as follows. to wit: to Jennie P,
ﬁve thousand; to Agnes M” three thousand. and to
Florence 3., two thousand dollars.

These codicils wereboth executed at the ofﬁce
of the society. Citations were issued for April
2 to Edwin Bergh. Henry Burgh. Jr.. Matilda.

M. Brown, and Florence Bergh Brown, grand-

strained to pause for a moment and

JUDICIAL AND EXECUTIVE CAREER.

 

Ex~Governor John '1‘. Hoffman is dead.
A .cablogram from Wiesbaden. Germany, which

Hoffman was the senior counsel, announced his
death there yesterday of heart disease. '
i A NOBLE MAN.

EX-Senator William Cauldwell, who was a member
of the Legislature when J 0th T. Huffman was Gov-
ei‘nor,rsaid:—-\-“A nobler man or afiner democrat
than Mr. Hoﬁman never lived. He was genial,
suave, straightforward and courteous. Had there
been no Tweed Ring in existence at that time Mr.
Hoffman would have been nominated as aPresi—
dential candidate in 1872. As it is, his name has
beenalready mentioned as a probable successor to
the late Chief Justice Waite.”

Edward Kearney, who knew the ex-Governor inti-
mately, remarkedz—“Mr. Hoﬁ‘man was a persistent
democrat. He was plain and impretentious. I knew

him when he occupied a ﬂoor in an apartment house
on , Fourth avenue. He was plain. and democratic
then. as he was in subsequent years when fortune
smiled on him. But he was always a democrat.”

Eli-GOVERNOR JOHN T. HOFFMAN,
Err-Governor John Thompson Hoffman was born
in the village of Sing Sing, on the Hudson, on the
10th of January, 1828. His. father was Dr. Adrian
Kershaw Hoﬂman, his mother a daughter of Dr.
. Thompson, of Saratoga county. ,
John T. Hartman, inherited an illustrious name—-
aname associated with the traditions and identiﬁed
with the history, the growth of the Empire State and
the strugglesof the democratic party in the State.
Like so many of his ancestors, he was a democrat
from his earliest boyhood, and after he grew to.
men’s estate he became one of the most earnest
workers in his party, which party in turn rewarded
him by twice electing him Recorder of this city,
then as Mayor,- and ﬁnally to the Governorship.

FROM COLLEGE ’10 THE BAR.
His earlier education was obtained in Sing Sing,
after which he was sent to Union College. from
which he was graduated in 1846. After leaving
college he studiedlaw in the’Oiﬁce of General Aaron

‘ Wa‘rd'in Sing Sing, and in January, 1849, was ad—,
mitted to the Bar and entered almost immediately
upon the practice of law in this, city.

While yet at college he won considerable renown
as a. public speaker, and it was not a great while
after being admitted to practice , that public atten-
tioir was directed toward his addresses in the courts
and his speechesat political meetings. Even before

 

in the politics of his native town and was always a
welcome speaker at the mee tings of the party with
Which he had aﬂiliated. ln1fact, when he was but
twenty years of age he had become so prominent
that he was placed on the State Central Committee
of one of the democratic factions of the State, _ then
called the Hard Shell Democracy. Hisname 1s ap-
pended to the address or that committee to the

‘. the memorable July, riots of 1863 took place, and

known in the history of the Bench of this city.

Elf-ELECTED RECORDER.
At the conclusion of his term as Recorder, the peo
ple without distinction of party, united in asking him

to keep his seat and he was unanimously re-elected .

for a second term.

1

Although he was a stanch adherent of Tammany ‘

Hall, the Republican Committee, in notifying Mr.

Hoffman that theJudiciary Convention of their party 3

had placed him in nomination, used the following
language 2—— .

“The Committee were instructed further to declare
that the nomination was made for the reasons that
your judicial judgments have been impartial and un-
inﬂuenced by partisan considerations; that the manner
in which you have performed your ofﬁcial duty de-
mands your rc-election, and that you have been.
neither doubting nor cold in the support of the
national cause.” '

When the votes were counted it was found that Mr.
Iloii‘man had received 60,000 out of 64,000 votes polled
for that ofﬁce—a tribute of respect and conﬁdence up

1 to that time without parallel in the history of this

as Newton or Laplace. The world would have

Mr, Marsh said the portraits came by simply hold- -
ing the canvas in a perfectly light room over the
head in front or a mirror. As he was saying this
. Mme. De Bar came in to impress the same fact upon ,
the HERALD reporter.

s‘rmrr COMMUNICATIONS.

Mr- Marsh displayed a number of spirit communi-
cations on pads. He said he bought the pads, which
were of Chinese paper, at Macy’s. He held one end
of the closed pad, he said. and the Madame held the
other. There was a sound like that made by a quill
pen. and. then, when a number of pages had been
written-sometimes thirty or forty in a few min-
utes—«some raps were heard after the signature had
been made.

Among the spirits was one in a cramped hand like a
poor imitation of that of Queen Elizabeth. This lady
said, she was responsible for the writing. of "The
Merry Wives of Windsor.” ‘

J cphtha’s daughter wrote to say that she was not
sacrificed, but‘that on an angel’s advice her father
had killed a kid instead while she retired to a re-
ligious house. EliZabeth dated from the planet
Mars and closed with the compliment to Mr. Marsh,
“Xe are right pleasant to behold, kind sir."

Alluding to a communication of Pius XI. Mr.
Marsh said, "You had better not say anything
about that or we shall all go to Bloomingdale.” St.
Anthony of Padua also wrote to say that he would
put pictures on some old pieces of stained glass
from the cathedral of that city, which Mr. Charles
Edwards Lester, formerly United States Consul at
Genoa, brought from there manyyears ago. And he
did; he painted in oil with quite a thick impasto.
unlike the others, portraits on one fragment of the ,
infant Jesus and himself and on another of the Vir-
gin Mary. . .'

His ancns'ron’s PORTRAIT.-

A small portrait, to which Mr. Marsh called par-
ticular attention, was of App. Claudius Caecus, the
censor, who built the Appian aqueduct and began g
the Appian road. . ‘ l

' “Who is it by ?” queried the 'HERALD man. .

“By Apolles,” answered Mr. Marsh. r

“Who does that refer to?" was asked. .
“It refers to me.” replied the owner. "You can l
see that it does. An artist told me that it must be

2,400 years between us!”

A large canvas bore a representation of a statue of
the Emperor Claudius. Curiously a. photograph of 1
the statue was tacked to the wall near by, which was
somewhat of a give away. But a gentleman was
. at hand who had seen the picture appear by
'spirit agency. This was Mr. ()‘Sullivan, formerly
American Minister to Lisbon. He saw it painted
when Mme. De Bar was holding forth in the classic
precincts of Washington square. Mr. O’Sullivan pot-

' Taking advantage of a temporary absence of Mr. __

@usinesn Man’s Strange Hallucination.

 

Lawyer Luther R. Marsh, 01' this city, has com.
i into possession of some rare pictures lately. He is
prepared to depose and say that within the past
twelve months Messrs. Raphael, Rembrandt,
Michael Angelo, Polygnotus, Apelles, et al, have
' visited his home, No. 166 Madison avenue, and
then and there—working through the mediumship
‘orMme. Diss Debar—painled portraits of the said
Luther R. Marsh, Sr; Paul, Robert Burns, Claudius
: Caesar and other well-known people.‘ Mr. Marsh
. has never caught a glimpse of the painters, but he
is convinced that they produced the pictures cred-
ited to their ghostly hands, because ihemedluin
‘ has given him their compliments and the assurance
i that they painted the portraits. It is a good thing
that he has these assurances, for without them no
' one would ever suspect the old masters of having
i turned out such remarkable work.

Henry Bergh was one of our most attentive
and regular ﬁrst—nighters. He possessed taste
and skill as a critic. and his judgment was
usually accurate. I know a number of people
in the profession that largely owe their success
to his advice and aid in time of need. He
cherished. the delusion that he had a talent for
dramatic composition. Such of his plays as
were represented by amateurs were dramatic
ally worthless. and I presume that his several
unacted pieces were likewise valueless.

it is strange that a man who. in the prose-
cution of his self-imposed public duty was
absolutely fearless, should be hyper-sensitive
to criticism where his plays were concerned. i
remember sitting once in his private oﬁice
lover at the S. P. C. A. building on Fourth
avenue. and hearing him descant on the subject
of newspaper criticism in terms of unmeasured
contempt. He showed me his scrap—book,
which contained a number of adverse notices
of his productions. Beneath each he had writ.
'ten his opinion of its faults in indignant terms.

He turned to one unfavorable criticism that
appeared several years ago in THE MIRROR,
and. forgetful or ignorant of the fact that it
was penned by myself, called my attention to
his note upon it. This set gravely forth that.
‘the article was inspired by personal enmity
which had blinded the writer to the marvelous ‘
merits of the play! But apart from his triﬂing ‘
fOibles- Henry Bergh was a great and good
man whose death is to be sincerely regretted
by all classes of peeple.

BRAVO. MR. GERRY! '

Mr. Elbridge T. Gerry has jumped man- .
fully into the breach and has made a ring-
ing defense of New York women. The abuse l
to which our sisters have been subjected
has been carried altogether too far. They
were not in need of champions, but every
‘ new one is so much clear gain. and they
" have found a perfect knight errant in the l
,‘m-esident of the s. P. e. G. Mr. (terry 331

. deserving of all praise for the masterly way
, in which he has vindicated womankind in

:Bravo, Mr. Gerry! May the hell on your .

‘ day for a. hundred years, and may you be i

The Diss De Barr racket was played last night at
i Chickering Hall.
Only a socialistic meeting could have got together

t such a queer lot of people. Wild eyes and sad
ieyes, .male and female, were in attendance. and
lot. long hair (male) there were miles. 'l'here were
l scores of persons present who thought they had a
l mission and envied people whom fortune or mls~
l fertune had given a chance to show they had one.
, il‘here were scores and scores in the hall whose pe.
.cnli‘ar‘faces told plainly they could swallow any-
.4f,thingl7”any “whopper,” so long as there was a
ugood deal of ceremony and ﬁummery about the
‘31ng of-it. . Men and women who hanker after.-~
{-.~»-fltsayances” were there in great numbers. Gray
;,_‘beards and gray hair, it is safe to say, formed one-
thirdof the audience. Cranks, cranks. crank!
.‘Tilllersftherer in full force. '
must be allowed, however, that to all intents and .
_ . .V'rposesthere was a very large contingent or com-
g‘ggnonsense and a pretty good sprinkling of those who"
- Eyigqganywhere and everywhere for fun. It was an ex-
:iégeeedih'gly well dressed crowd, especially the ladies.
inurldﬂthere was no lack of pretty faces.
x: The hall was about two-thirds full. The performv
slice was advertised as a lecture by the “Hon."
Luther R. Marsh, illustrated with stereopticon view
101’ the pictures he had had materialize at home.
. In front of the stage a sheet for the views was,a,nd
. on easels at each side rested specimen spirit daubs.

. - MR. MAnsn’s FAITH.

‘Mr. Marsh came on the platform about twenty
minutesElia past eight - in evening dress, marched
in front of the canvas, smiled at the audience and
then glared at the reporters in front of him. There
was slight applause.

He Gives Stereopticon Views of the “ Spirit .

-Slie is Clapped by theAudience and Be-
comes Deﬁant—“margin. Marsh Said.

The exploit of Luther r. Marsh last night at
, Chickering Hall was attended by an audience that
ﬁlled that place to about two-thirds of its capacill’o
As is usual with all assemblages that are drawn by ,
any attempt to deal with Spirituailsm, it was pretty ‘
fairly divided between sceptics and sympathizerﬁ-
Mr. Marsh, who delivered a rambling colloquial
, discourse with no attempt at literary or oratorical
skill, mainly succeeded in establishing to the satis-
faction of his listeners his own honesty andcredu- ‘
lity. He avoided all attempts to explain the phe-
‘ nomena of spirit pictures, conﬁning himself
; entirely to disjointed descriptions of the process, .
Mid giving up a greater portion of the evening to ‘-
an exhibition of stereopticon reproductions of the
canvases. He was treated with good-humored re-
: sheet by his audience,

 

2 laughed at his easy conclusions and
; applauded his exhibitions of trustiuiness
-‘ ironically. He preserved his equanimity

 

,throughout, endeavored to answer all relevant
,3 questions, and meandered along quite at his case i
»«; until 10 o’clock, when, the succession, of stere-
‘opticon pictures, thrown en a small screen on

the platform ina dimly lighted hall, appearing to

-a W”:

- be endless, and the audience beginning to drop off, ;

the interruptions grew more frequent and the lmpa~ :
One young man Wished to know '
if Mr. Marsh could produce any manifestations to-
night, to which Mr. Marsh said. “ No. " To I;
another he replied that the condition of mind of the
sitter had nothing whatever to do with the result. l

This colloquy was brought to an end by cells for .,
Mme. Diss Debar, and Mr. Marsh ﬁnally said he
would see if the lady would appear and answer
some of the questions herself. He then retired and a;
presently returned leading out a stout lady plainly
attired in a black dress and bonnet, who came to
the edge of the stage, and, after bowing deferen-
tlally, glared deﬁantly at the audience, with her
head thrown back. Her remarks were spiteful in
tone and clumsy in expression. She Was

—y—wa .4— r...... ...,.

ready to answer them all. Her attitude
said: “Let them come up; 1’11 serve
, them up. ” Her pudgy fat face, somewhat close

to her shoulders, indicated a general exasperation,
, and in reply to some one who wanted to know how
she did it she said: ‘ ‘ i will tell him if he will tell
me how the rose gets its bloom. 7’ This planting of
her picture process squarely among tha phenomena
of nature seemed to awe part of the audience and
convulse the other portion. There was a strong ten- -
- dency on the part of the audience to laugh at the
wrong place, and when she broke out in a tirade r
against the newspapers the whole house responded .
With a about of mirthful disdain, . 5

Mr. Marsh was cool and good-natured, but She l
. was exasperated. Her language betrayed in its 3
coarseness no lessthan in its vehemence the un. ’
trained mind. What she said was shrewishly de- ;
r, receive, Without being eXplanatory. She assumed {-
the'air of the woman in the police court, andshowed >
a disposition to out-billingsgate her assailants it I
they would give her the chance. Fortunately Mr. 5'
. Marsha who let her run for a few moments, Shut l
her off- with a “ There, that will do, n and she ,
ﬁnally retired. Her appearance and Speech did not ,
add weight, respectability or coineliness to the i.
entertainment. .

DEFENDING MME. mss DEBAR.
After further defending the right to believe in
Spiritigm, and the logical character of such belief
from a Christian and Scriptural standpoint, Mr.

, Marsh passed to a subject evidently nearer the .

minds of most of the audience—the defense of
.Mme.'Diss Debar. She must be a marvellous

that she was born of eleven dilferent mothers
besides the mother she really had,

over 100 of them were seriously wou_nr..lo=i.,
Eighteen lives were lost.
“ The sides of the plaza being lined with mat
ting as dry as tinder, and there beluga slight,
wind blowing. the amphitheatre was in a biz-loo
in a few seconds. Nine dead bodies, in 8(,)illi}.-’;

" The bulls, maddened by the roaring of “the

Wildly through the surging muse ol' bun.la‘r;ity,;

in~their way. .

so “ Among the 18 dead were two women, who
were ﬁrst gored to death. by the bulls and their
bodies afterward burned.

“ The scenes in the lle'ig'hborbcod of the lull}:
ring were sickening beyond description. Worn:
on and children, divested of their clothing and
crazed with suffering from their burue, ran;
aimlessly through the streets. and could scarce.»

It was Easter Sunday, the return of the arson

not desert their oil‘feprlngs, were the victims oi;
this most appalling catastrophe.

"Zelaya is mourning today. On every side is
heard the sound of wailing: for the loved nus-s,
mourning for those doomed todio, and of sulfur-

THE DYING HORSE.

A SOLILOQUY.

Yes, I’m down, doWn at last,
And I never can ruse: '

And the dark ﬁlms of death
Are now veiling my eyes.

But a word I would speak,
Dear friend B‘ergh, if I could,

Just awarm word of thanks,
For your friendship, so good.

I was once a young horse,
Full as frisky and gay

As was ever hitched up
To a carriage or sleigh-

Then my owner Was rich,
Yes, the bells of the town.
I was petted by day.
And at night bedded down.

All my blood gvas then hot,
For I had 11' ‘t grown old;

And my stable was warm,
So I never took'cold.

With good cats I was fed ‘
Just three times in a day,

‘ And my blankets and nets

Kept the ﬂies all away.

I would dash through. the streets
W 1th my young mistress then,
And we both were admired
By the city’s young men.

 

O, I never once dreamed
That my speed would so fail,
I’d be Whipped, and be called
“A poor, lazy old snail l”

 

But my mistress at last
Stood in much need of gold;
So we two had to part,

And alas I I was sold. ;

I was soon made a drudge
For a cartm an in town,

And was fed on poor hay,
And was NOT bedded down.

‘ From the day’s early dawn,
, To the sun’s dying ray,
1 was made to pull hard
At that heavy old dray.
i But at length came a change...

And it seems like a dream;
Once again I was sold, _
And made part of a team.

O’er a cobble paved street;
‘ - But; my mate wouldn’t pull——
Like his owner he’d cheat. ‘

And he left me to drag .

' All the load by myself; I

- So I soon got- so weak _
I. was “laid on the shelf.”

 

But at length after rest, '
In the meadow and grass,

It was thought I- again

3 For a worker might pass.

So once more I was sold—..
0, alas! what a doom!

I was hitchedto a car . ‘
Where there always was room -,

v 1. ~37 -

For another fat man . . +
‘ With a satchel or bag,

A‘Or women with bundles;

' ‘ And whose weight I must drag

Up the steep. heavy grade,
’Til my bones would so ache,
That it seemed one step more
And my poor legs would break:

But if once I stood still,
Just to catch half a breath,
~Then my driver would swear,
And nigh pound me to death.

He would thtch and would jerk

My poor head left and right;
So I often stood still ' ~ .
' ’Tlll he’d spent all his spite. ,

For I could not tell what

Concerning the new hospital for domestic
animals which the Society for the Prevention of

Cruelty to Animals proposes to build at once. ,

Mr. Henry Bergh, Jr.‘, President of 4 the society. f

said yesterday: “ For a number of years I have I

been impressed with the importance of having

a. hospital for the care and treatment, cepecially ‘

the surgical treatment, of animals, and to pro-

tention as is now elven to human beings.
“ When we get our hospital we shall have our
ambulances ready, with trained horses, like f

i x . ‘

those of the Fire Department, ready to rush :
out at the sound Of a bell, and go to therelief

of suffering animals in the streets. This will
avoid: the delays which at present are not only
vexatious but demoralizing to those whowitness
the suffering of animals dying iii-the streets.
At present, when animals are past saving, it‘
becomes necessary often to destroy them in the
street. This is, a horrid sight at best, and a
Very dangerous example to unthinking youths,
as some boys are apt to imitate the process
with dogs or cats in the back yard. The sensi-
bilities of people are shocked by the present
method. as we may be compelled to kill animals
in front of schools or near private dwellings.
where the tender feelings of ladies are shock-
ed. When we get our new hoseital we will
take the poor animals expeditiously out of the
streets to the stables, and if it becomes neces-

tricity. which is far less painful.

“We expect to have some novel appliancesin
our new hospital. One of these will be a truck '

torescue animals from excavations. At pres-
ent when a horse: tumbles down. a sewer or a
collar .itlis verydifﬁcult to lift him up. We have
a derrick new. but it is cumbersome and difﬁ-

 

' an to take their lives we will do it by elec- ;

cult to move and slow of operation. Our new ‘

life—saving truck will be nick of movement,

(:1 adaptable.

'n a ’iff . If we have to lsill him it will be
33):; lout 3f SSitht of the .publlc and expeditious-
l I have already received a letter from Mr,
}l’dison, who Says the idea of killing by electric-
ity is practical, and I have also a letter from
Mayor Hewitt. in which he promises to glve
what aid he can to expedite tne substitution of
some more prompt and less torturing method
of killing dogs in the dog pound.

“ It is a. common thing now for degs caught
late in the season to be almost frozen to death
11 he droWning process at .the dog pound.
bhzn our new hospital is ﬁnished we can.kill
the dogs quickly, and keep them out of Sight
and put them to no unnecessary pam, It has
been proposed to kill dogs by an apparatus
which asphyxiates them With carbonic 0x1d
gas I am satisﬁed that that would be an ex-
peditious and destructive agent. .

“ The main workpf our society has. hltherto
done in the direction of punishingthose
who have inﬂicted pain upon dumb animals, ,
This will be somewhat of .a new departure in
l the Way of doing something for the animais

FIVE s'rouv HOUSE. ' '
Albert E. Wright, a wealthy old gentleman. eighty
years of age, who owns the houses Nos. 207 and 20!
WestVThirty-second street, was brought to the Jet.“ .

. ferson Market Police Court yesterday on a. charge at .

murdering one cat and breaking two legs of another.
Mrs. Minnie Tosh, of N0. V212 West Thirty~third
street, was the person who accused Mr. Wright of.
cat murder. ~ .

Mr. Wright looks very much like “Ben" Butler.
He has lost one eye, and the sight of the other is
aided by a gold rimmed eyeglass. When speaking 0!
cats Mr. Wright uses language which history states
“Hickory" Jackson indulged in when his “dander
was up.” ' , .

Mr. William . Dunning. who lives on the top ﬂoor
of one of Mr. Wright’s houses, appeared» chi-{the
stand as the owner of the cat which had its legs '
broken. Theowner of the, dead cat, Mrs. Scott. was
not present. '

Mr. Dunning said that Annie Rowe, who was visit-
ing his wife on Thursday last, saw Mr. Wright coax .
the two eats up stairs with a. piece of meat. When
his wife went into the back yard the next morning;
She heard a plaintive end distressing “m’yow” issue‘ j
from the ash barrel. ' ' - ~ {57.};

Covered with refuse and dirt lay her poor tabby;
with a. hind and fore leg broken. Beside nor rested ?
all that was mortal of Mrs. Scott's black boy cat. *

She took "Maria" from out the ashes. bathed hei 1
and had the broken legs set by a. doctor. i

Mrs. Tosh, whose beck windows look out on to the, u
rear of Mr. Wright’s houses. said she saw Mr. Wright :
on the roof with the cats. He looked ﬁendish andmurs; .
mured' coaxingly, “Here puss, puss, pretty pus’s."‘;
Conﬂdingly came the tire felines. A sudden plungp '1
and "Tom“ and “Maria." were making screechinﬂ .
cart-wheels through the air, their tails in the hands
01’ the enemy, One mighty hurl and 011' they shot 71

Mr.. Wright acknowledged he threw the cats effing}?

that through training and inheritance the trot—i

:BANBURG NOT IN FORMS
Terra Coiia Shows Suburban Quality on;
the St. Louis Track. ’5

FINAL DASHES AT LATONIA.

9—.—

The fourth race. of one mile and a quarter, just ; I

‘ the Suburban distance, on the card at Jerome Park "-
, yesterday possessed unusual attractions for the ;
thousands of racing men there, as Mr. James Gal—
way’s Linden, for some time past one of the hotf
Lfavorites for the Suburban, was in it, and had as 5,
opponents Le Logos, Brown Duke, Richmond, ;
\Banner Bearer and Boccaccio. Linden carried 1.28
lbs” and it was thought that he must win hands
_ down. considering his recent performances. He did ;
prove the v1ctor. but only by a head. and he was ’
' punished the last hundred yards or so.
Brown Duke, who made Linden extend himself to i
. the utmost, carried 104 lbs. Twenty-four pounds less
iweight, it is true, but the whole character of the '
raCe shows that the Suburban is not altogether at
Linden’s mercy, as has been considered for some
time past. One extenuating circumstance, however, ,
-must be admitted, and that is, Shauer, who had the
mount on Linden, rode him in a. very careless if not ’
‘ incompetent manner, particularly in the last
eighth of a mile. Linden’s weight in the Suburban
is now 124 lbs" and after all it may be that he 4’
needed this ﬁght to give him the ﬁnishing touch for 1
the great handicap. Richmond, the in and out crack .
‘ot the Acorn Stable, was last in the race,and Le Logos ,
did no better than ﬁfth. As this is the season of },
mystery among some owners of fairly good horses .
it isn't always safe to bet on public form, but all the
3 real clinkers will surely be seen within two or three :
‘ weeks. .
. The Belmont Stakes had only two starters of the j
- ninety-four entries—the Dwyers’ Sir Dixon and Mr. ;
, August Belmont’s Prince Royal. The Dwyers’ rep— 1
l'resentativo won in a walk by a dozen lengths. What
a pity the Emperor of Norfolk was not in the stakes! :-
A SUBURBAN CANDIDATE AMISS.
There were three surprises during the day. The '
ﬁrst was Longlight’s victory in the opening race of i
one mile and a sixteenth. Banburg, belonging to
Mr. J. D. Morrissey, was the tip. Nothing but him,
all other tips were the dreams of Thompson street 2
touts. "or words to‘that effect," but he wasn’t in the
hunt. and carried consternation to his legion of1
backers. "Sumthin’s the matter with him.” "He“
Will soon begin to cough" and lots of other excuses it
were made for Banburg, but that didn’t bring back 9
the thousands of dollars lost on him. Not much.
The truth is, it isn’t the best of judgment to always ;
look for your money where you lose it, and '2
the men who cling to Banburg at this time, at least, i
are likely to be throwing their surplus funds away. 5
His race on Wednesday last over the Titan course
was another terrible disappointment to his many '.
admirers. It was deemed a "cinch,” something
like taking money not belonging to you. the upshot
being that he couldn‘t run a little bit. “Banburg

ﬂayed us alive,” was the cry of his backers on that ,
occasion. Now Banburg is or was a very promi ,
nent Suburban’candidate, but he must do much :
better—yes, a whole lot better—1f he gets Within 1
hailing distance of the winner at Sheepshead as he 1
passes the judges on Thursday next. ;

 

r sur rise was the victory of Nettle in the
‘ seﬁihoélrielce. ligaia was the favorite, but did no bet- .

ler. Withers’ Cyclone Colt Again Lowers the
Titan Coarse Record.

 

A FAR WESTERN DERBY.

u—n—W

It is the last race on the closing day’s card of the
Jerome Park spring meeting, and seven horses
have been summoned to the starting post
to do battle for an eight-hundred dollar purse over
the full steeplechase course. Jockeys and horses
have been over the ﬁeld time and again, and the
several thousand people who are intently watching
, the impatient steeds inwardly hope and pray that
there will be no repetition of the terrible
Y accidents of Saturday and Monday. The
? knowledge that Jockey Cross "sleeps the sleep that
z'knows no waking," and that poor Pope lies in the .
Manhattan Hospital with his face crushed out of all
1 human semblance, causes some tender hearted souls
‘ to leave the grounds before the ﬂag ialls, but the
majerity'hunger for the excitement of the cross
country competition and join in the cry “Their oﬁ‘.”

.“Monkey” Charley. who is on Willie Palmer,
rushes his horse over the ﬁrst obstacle, and the
others fellow at breakneck speed. Up Picnic Hill
they race like quarter horses, and the stone wall in
the north ﬁeld is sately negotiated. The fatal jump
at the foot of the club house bluff, where Pepe was
unhorsed, is before them. but they do not check the
speed of their horses. Willie Palmer, with his feather
Weight rider, skims it like a bird, but Harry Mann‘s '
150 pounds is too much to lift high, and, striking the
timber with his fore legs, he turns a somer-
s‘ault and breaks his neck. Daly is under him,
and, amid the cries of horror from the spectators, i
willing hands rush from every portion 'ef the inﬁeld :
“to look after the unfortunate jockey. When the l

l
l

 

.r.vv'r.‘r‘

‘ 'cloud of dust rolls away Daly has been extricated
5' from his perilous position more frightened than
7 hurt, but poor Harry Mann lies where he fell. His .
‘ last race is run, and more than one tear is dropped
i, tohis memory. He has emptied some pocketbooks, ‘
it is true, but he has often ﬁlled others, and the for-

. tunate‘are not forgetful as he lays in the agonies of
5 death at the feet of the hurdle he had so often no-

gotiated in safety. .
STILL FLYING AT THE JUMPS,

On go the others at the jump in the south ﬁeld,
where Referee stumbles and Repeater, falling over
him, unseats his rider. Again stable hands rush to
the assistance of the boys, but. fortunately, all es-
cape with a shaking up except Jones, who has lost a
thumb. Willie Palmer is a long way in front of his
competitors, but they are racing all. Over the
stone wall in the north ﬁeld King Troubler
comes to grief, and then the ﬁght is nar-
rbwed down to three. Willie Palmer is too

far in front to be caught, and he ﬁnishes a winner

by two lengths from Glenbar, with the favorite,

JohnHenry, third. It was a most exciting close to

a very successful meeting, which was only marred
, by the unfortunate accidents at the timber.

The ﬂat racing yesterday was of an interesting
character. Ransom, an outsider, won the ﬁrst race,
with Hayward, the favorite, second. Brown Duke
fairly romped home in the second race, as did Bel-
videre in the third, the Westchester Handicap. Ben All .

1 again showed a diapesition to sulk, and though he

 

 

 

may start in the Suburban it is doubtful if he will
have many post supporters. Mr. Withers' unnamed
King Ernest—Cyclone colt further reduced the
Titan course record in the fourth race, beating the
favorites, Laredo and Climax, in clever style. This
was a spirited struggle, and the ﬁnish was watched

1 with breathless interest by the crowd. The Brobk- ‘

1, dale representative was a Cyclone in Ernest. The
3 ﬁelder Fireﬂy was ﬁrst home in the selling event
. and fortunate holders of $5 mutual tickets cashed

them in for $73 05.

' Though the attendance was only moderate 23, 268

tickets were sold on the six races. These repre-
§ sented $116,340. the club’s commission amounting to
‘ $5,817. Details of the racing follow:-——

1 One Instance Where the Society for the

The Brooklyn branch of the American Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. of which
:‘Mr. F. 0. Clark is Superintendent. has been kept
‘ very busy since the hot weather began in the dis-

Yesterday the society, having sustained the

from the great attachment we had for him. He
was in the habit of going into the doctor’s yard,
and this aﬂorded the vile wretch an opportunity to
carry out what Isupnose he intended for a prac-
tical joke.
andthen turned him loose. The poor little thing
came home and shortly afterwards died in great
‘ agony. He was especially prized, being a genuine
Japanese pug, and if you will look into this cruelty
case, Which I think could hardly be excelled short
of vivlsection, you will succeed in adding much
gratitude to my already high. opinion of your
‘ society.” . .
The above, the Superintendent states, wrll_ re-

A. S. P. C. A. on Fulton Street.

On the second ﬂoor of No. 415 Fulton street.
the ofﬁces of the Brooklyn ‘ Agency of the
American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals, there are two rooms, the inner and
smaller being the private ofﬁce of superin-
tendent F. 0. Clark, and in the outer and gen-
eral business oﬁce is a large collection of
articles that graphically illustrate the work of
the society and the means employed to perpe-
trate the crimes its agents endeavor to prevent.

Among the adornments of the room an Ameri-
can ﬂag, a large portrait of the late Henry
Bergh. founder of the society, and a smaller
one of H. B. Claﬂin, will attract attention. The
largest and most conspicuous of the trophies of

_ the society’s work is a section of a. cockpit. It

might be used as a rocker for a mammoth hobby
horse, and 1s a portion of the bit that was found.
on the premises of Michael Karney on J ackdon
avenue, Long Island City. In a. glass case
collection
of steel gaffe, muffs and guards used
at cock ﬁghts. The gaffe are from one and one-
half to three inches in length, with points as
sharp as needles and edges as keen as razors,
and provided with slender straps to fasten
them to the legs oi: birds. The muffs look like
very small boxing gloves or stuﬁ'ed ear muf-
ﬂers. They are strapped on the claws of the
birds during a journey or whenever it is neces-
sary to prevent them from ﬁghting. The
guards are curious little contrivances that are
slipped on the galls whenever it is desired
that the birds shall merely scratch,
and not slash and stab each other.
In the same case are, also several
packages of poisoned chicken and goat feed. '
'What at aﬁrst glance might be taken for a
number of leather medals Will, on a closer in-
spection, be found to be very ingenious appli-
ances to make a horse appear to be full of ﬁre
and spirit, while in reality it is being cunningly
tortured. The leather disks are, full of tacks,
and are slipped on the ends of the bitts with .

g the points inside, so that when the reins are

of the tacks pierce.
causing it to toss its

Then there are numerous clubs

animals have been mercilessly beaten or had
their brains dashed out, and the names of the
persons who used them for that purpose are all
neatly written on cards attached to the society’s
trophies.

The youth who has charge of the muse um. ,
and keeps it nicely dusted, kindly called the
CITIZEN reporter’s attention to a. cat’s tail. It
had been cut oil ofa black cat and appeared
to be moth eaten. Another choice exhibit was
an old tin can. A ﬂy speckled card at—
tachment contained the information that Mar-
garet Nash had fastened the canto a. calf’s nose so
that the animal could neither eat norédrink. In.
other words Margaret had muzzled her calf .
with a tomato can, and was arrested and ﬁned.

The collection, though not a verylarge one, is
suﬁlcently so to give a very fair idea. of the
variety ct cases the agents of the society have
to deal with. ‘

“Yes,” said the curator of the museum, “we '
are kept busy all the time. James Clanccy, .a
driver of the Grand 3 Street and Newtown Rail-
road has just gone to jail for ﬁfty days rather
than pay a ﬁne of $50 for beating a horse in tTne
most brutal manner, and Philip Fraz, of 1‘.“
386 Johnson avenue, has been ﬁned $5 to!
driving a horse that was unﬁt to work”

“Does young Mr. Burgh often v1s1t Brook«
lynl” asked the reporter.

. “Oh yes,” was the cheerful and ready
response, “he comes over every once in a while.
He has no stated time for coming, but he gets

here. ”

stopped at London and investigated the work of the Royal

, Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and, on.
his arrival in this country, he organized a society having the
same object.

The project at the outset met with great opposition. One
can form no idea of the obstacles that were thrown in the
way of the new enterprise. Every body ridiculed the idea
that animals had any rights that human beings were bound to

’v 2 respect. The very people from whom Mr. Bergh expected
" i, to receive help and encouragement took no interest in the
i scheme; they pooh-poohed and ridiculed the idea and lent
'\ t' * no assistance, and it was some time before they became, so to
speak, educated up to the work and recognized it as a move-
ment worthy of support. Since the formation of the Society
similar organizations have been started in all parts of this
State, in nearly every State and territory in the Union, in
British America, South America, the West Indies, and in
Mexico.
i The law under which the Society is formed is very compre-
\ hensive, and embraces all forms of cruelty. It provides that

any body who tortures, cruelly beats or unjustiﬁably injures
any living animal is guilty of a misdemeanor, and deﬁnes the
word “ cruelty ” to include every “ act, omission or neglect”
in by which unjustiﬁable physical pain, suffering or death is
. «t v i caused. The word “ animal” is deﬁned as any living creat-
. ure and, at the outset, included the human race, but since the
v E v" incorporation of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
' ; to Children, this latter provision has been omitted.

i. The organization of the Society last named, was suggested
‘2. ‘ i: by an 1nc1dent that came to Mr. Bergh’s notice. A lady re-

i

 

 

_ ported to him the case of the cruel treatment of a little girl
i by her stepmother. The statement was substantiated by an
' . i; i ofﬁcer of the Society who made an investigation, and the wo-
' ' ‘ man was arrested and sent to prison for a year. This little
incident created considerable comment at the time, public in-
' ’ i terest was aroused on the subject of cruelty to children, and
i Shortly after, the “ Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
' ‘?_ S Children,” was organized.
vi'i In the early days of our work the cruel beating of horses,
t i and the overloading 0f carts attracted our attention. In
v l those days horses were beaten and Clubbed most unmercifully
I t there being no one to restrain the brutal conduct of their own- .
erg. It was a common occurrence to see horses beaten over E
.. v the head and OtherWise Shamefhlly abused. Horses were
i . ‘ driven that were totally unﬁt for work by reason of lameness
i and emaciation. At that time there were certain car lines on
~ * which Passengers were conveyed for a three cent fare, in con-
‘t’i sideration of not being transported very rapidly; the horses
t that were used on the cars, lame and crippled animals, were
in SUCh a, condition that they Were nOt able to move mLICh
faster than a walk.

Society dog-ﬁghtlng .and Cock‘ﬁghting have been pretty

found in some obscure place that has escaped the notic l

Of late years there has been an improvement in the ge

 

People, in New York city especially, take a pride in havi
nice-looking work-horses. I think that horse fairs, dog an,
poultry shows have, to a considerable extent, done much t _
foster an interest in the better breeding and care of animals.“
The large brewery ﬁrms and merchants generally take pride
in having as ﬁne-looking horses before their carts as before ;
their carriages. You will see magniﬁcent animals used as i
work-horses now that you would have looked in vain fer i
‘ twenty years ago. i
I regard the docking of horses’ tails as one of the worst

forms of cruelty, not so much on account of the pain inﬂicted i

5
v
v

the tail being a continuation of the vertebral column—but

of protecting himself against insects. How would it be if a '/ .
man’s arms were cut off short at the shoulder and he had no ,t I
means of brushing the ﬂies from off his head, or his nose?
Would not the torture be great? A person suffering from i
such a deprivation would realize the cruelty of cutting off :a ,
horse’s tail. . , . 5
The people who resort to this practice are simply apingv‘a
fashion that has come from England. They sometimes use ‘t
as an argument that the horse’s tail gets over the lines and j
that is annoying. But if a horse has a ﬂy or an insect on his i
back, biting and worrying him, he naturally swings the tail i
around to rid» himself of the aggravation, and, in so doing, he t
will sometimes get the tail over the lines, but I do not think i
a little annoyance of that kind is a sufﬁcient excuse to inﬂict i
such a suffering on the animal. i
This cutting of the horses’ tails is one of those dictates of if
fashion that, to my mind, is simply hideous, and I am sorry iv
to say that it is done as much now as formerly. The Society i
is doing all it can to prevent it. If we found any man engaged ‘
in docking horses’ tails, we would cause his arrest, for we ;
could proceed-against him for such an offense as that. A i t
veterinary surgeon, however, who will perform operations of '
that kind will go to a stable and, without any previous notice, i
will dock a horse’s tail and, of course we have no means lot i.
catching him in the act of doing so; the work is done in the t "
seclusion of the stable. I believe the operation itself hurts
as badly as the cutting off of a person’s ﬁnger; perhaps it
hurts more, as the spinal marrow extends to that portion of i
the vertebral column. i
As to improved and more humane methods in the trans;
portation of cattle there has dot been any great ambunt of
progress made. Some years ago at a meeting of the Ameri-
can Humane Association (an aggregation of Societies having
humane objects) the sum of $5,000 was voted for the best and .’
most. hhproved car for the transportation of cattle, providing it ‘
facrlltles for watering and feeding in transitu. A number of 1'
deSIgnS were submitted, but none of them seemed to meet
the requirements of the Association and the sum has-not been
awarded to anybody as yet. ,‘

Epistr‘ong upon them that they attracted all the small
A siand idiots in the neighborhood, and were fol-
owed bythem to Witty’s stables, at No. 215 wu-
ouighby street. where, it ‘;was announced in the
l‘fﬁﬁmm, fifty: horses were to be sold at
induction by George : Lewis. of Brooklyn. Auc-
ijltioneer Lewis sold 'the ﬁfty "horses and
Elihu-lest" in short order to persons from
igf’diiif‘ie'i'Vent places in Brooklyn at prices ranging be-
tsetse; second $125. Over $4,000 was realized by the
. V liner; Mr. J. J. McOafferty, who won a strong hold

The youngsters crowded the great open lot near
the stables, and when they saw the horses in the
"corral, wild eyed and shy, they spread the news
abroad that “dey was bucking mustangs an’ dat

These helassoed by hand, casting the noose over

place after {our P. .\I., and was witnessed by fully

ground men stood ready to pounce upon them. One

man always contrived to set the brute's tail between
his hind legs and pull it like a ship's hawser with all
his might over his ﬂank. While in this position the
terriﬁed horses cried and moaned and Francisco
adjusted the halior upon their heads. Having done
so he gave alie other and 0! it to the owner and the

DIED FOR SCIENCE’S SAKE

A DOG KILLED WITH THE
ELEOZRIO CURRENT:
PRACTICAL ILLUSTRATION OF AN ELEC—

TRICAL THEORY STOPPED BY AN
OFFICER OF THE HUMANE SOCIETY.
The comparative death-dealing qualities
of high tension electric currents, continuous
i and alternating, interested quite a company of.
l gentlemen who gathered 'to hear the subject

room at the School of Mines. An interruption
to the proceedings prevented such a presenta-
tion of views and illustrations as had been
planned, for when a doe: which had been but
intoa cage to show how electric currents work
on life, had been tortured and ﬁnally put to
death, Agent Hankinson of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, showed his
badae and forbade further experiments.

The gathering comprised representatives of
all the electric light companies (and many elec-
trical experts. Harold P. Brown sent out the
invitations. He is the engineer who has borne

all electric lighting is done. After a cross-ﬁre
between Mr. Brown and his opponents had gone
on for several months, the Board of Electrical
Control appointed a meeting at which it was
proposed to hear both sides. Mr. Brown was
then away from the city. As the other side
made some very strong points at the meeting,

Mr. Brown decided to undo them by alecture
with experiments yesterday. In opening his
talk, he said he had been drawn into contrOVer-
sy only by his sense of right. He represented
no company and no ﬁnancial or commercial
interest: When he read of the death-dealing
electric light wire, and saw that the owners of
the wires took no blame on thcmSelves, but
tried to biacken the memory or the unfortunate
man by statements that were both 1111.].1185 and
cruel, he wrote a. public letter suggesting that
the companies be required to tit their Wires with
some appliance that would aﬁord reasonable
protection to life.

He said he had proved by repeated experi.
ments that a living creature could stand shocks
from a continuous current much better than
from an alternating current. He had applied a
current of 1.410 volts to a dog Without tatal re-
sult, and had repeatedly killed dogs with from
500 to 800 volts of an alternating current,

the alternating. advocates said that it was not
fair to draw conclusionsirom the experiments
just ﬁnished, because thedog was worn out.
before the alternating current was applied. He,-
was one of those who believed that an alternat-
ion current of 1,000 volts was harmless, and
offered to put T. Carpenter Smith forward to
take such a shock if Mr. Brown would take a -
1,000—volt shock from a continuous current.
This willingness on the debater’s part to soon-
ﬁce- both his friend and his opponenton the
altar of science did not meet with the approval
of either of those gentlemen, and, it lapsed, to
the manifest disappointment of the rest of the
compaDY- . ‘
EXpert Wheeler next called attention to the
fact that no relay was used in the experiment
with the alternating current. Mr. Brown re-
lied that if it had been, 70,0 volts might have
con required to kill. The electricians about
the room shook their heads, and Expert Wheeler
said that while Mr. Brown might be right, yet
as he' had undertaken the experiments under .
different conditions, he could hardly claim to *
have proved his case. Mr. Brown wished that
his experiments hadnot been interrupted. He
said he had enoth dogs to satisfy the most
skeptical. The only. places, he insisted, where .

’an alternating current ought to be used were

the dog pound, the slaughter house, and the
State prison.

In yesterday’s experiments the current ap-
plied was hardly to be compared with that used
in arc street lights, where it has a force of
from 2,000 to 3,000 volts. '

at Columbia College, Fourth avenue and Forty~
ninth Street, and were attended by the Board of
Electrical Control,

dimers and experts, and the representatives of

the press. ,
Harold P. Brown, an expert electrical engineer.
conducted the experiments, which consisted of
exhibitions of the comparative death-dealing
qualities or high-tension continuous and high.
tension alternating electric currents. The plat-
form was furnished with a number of dynamic
appliances, volt-metres. con verters. relays and
galvanometers. ‘

In the centre- of the platform, upon a 111in
table, was placed a cage, mostly composed 01
stout wire-work, four feet long and about three
feet in width and. height. A large mongrel dog,
of the Newfoundland type, occupied it as the
Subject for the primary tests. . .

Mr. Brown opened the exhibition by reading a
lengthy. paper on the subject of electrical cur~
‘ u I appear before you,” he began, “ in be-

Dr. J. J. Mills Causes an Arrest for the.’

 

Misuse of :1 Horse—A Dog Shot in;
Greenville--Tlm Offender Found Guilty. ?
Fined Ton Dollars. P

Our local agent of the society for Pre-f
vention of Cruelty to Animals, Dr. J. J. .
Mills, has been stirring up offenders against
the law in a lively manner for the past'
few days. The latest arrest was that of
Halsey Brown Tuesday for misusing a _,
horse. The trial is set down for Saturday '
before Justice J. M. Allerton. 3

On Wednesday before Judge Geo. Au
Durland and a jury in the Town Of Green- t
ville, an interesting case was tried, the '1
title being the People against James }
Fiesler. t

The case was under the section of the

“Penal Code,” Wthh makes cruelty to,
dumb beasts a misdemeanor. It appeared "
from the facts that Fiesler without any l
just cause shot and wounded a dog, 6'!
months old belonging to a gentleman by‘
the name of Crowell, and the only reason
for it that he gave was because the dog
had chased a cat in play belonging to him.
Dr. Mills looked after the case in the in-
terest of “ The American Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.”

The jury after a great deal of delibera-
tion rendered a verdict of guilty. The
court ﬁned the defendant ten dollars, and
the entire costs of the suit, in default of
which he goes to jail. The ﬁne will prob- f
ably be paid. Henry B. Fullerton prose- .
outed the case in the interest of the So-
ciety. These cases are becoming more
numerous every day and it’s time some of
the human brutes who run at large are
taught a lesson, with reference to whole-
sale abuse of dumb beasts.

The doctor is to be commended for his
activity and we trust he will continue his
good work and make some people under-
stand that there is a law which protects
animals as well as themselves. ‘ ,

DROWNING IS A SLOW WAY TO KILL DOGS.

The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
is inclined to think favorably of the ofl‘er made by Harold
P. Brown. to provide apparatus for the killing of dogs at
the Deund by electricity, and will forward his letter to
the Mayor. Superintendent Ilanlrinsou recently put a.
stop to some of Mr. Brown’s experiments on dogs at
Colnlnbla College, but Mr. Brown announces himself as a
well-wisher to the moiety. and declares himself anxious
to forward its work by substituting almost instantaneous
(1893311 for the dogs. instead of the comparatively 810“'
process of drowning. The ordinance under which the
pound is maintained gives to the Mayor the power 0f

that a man by the n ' mt

guilty of a violation of the law. en
rant was issued by George A, D
of Greenville, and the prisoner
‘ ‘not guilty,” and a trial by jury
It appeared from the evidence
Crowell, the complainant in t
that he lived in the same house with the
defendant, and that he owns a New-
foundland pup about 6 months old, and
that on the evening of July 31st he in
company with his Wife were on the
wood-pile and the dog 'was playing
around when, according to the com--
plainant’s story, Fiesler the defendant,
shot the pup in the fore-leg, woundino
him. The defendant swore that at th;
time he shot the dog it was chasing his
cat in play. The jury after being out
some time rendered a verdict of “guilty”-
as charged. ' . ' . ’
The Justice imposed a ﬁne of tendol-
lars and costs which will make the en- I
tire expense to the defendant. about;
twenty dollars, and in default of pay- ‘
ment, the defendant will have to serve
that number of days at Goshen. \I'
This abuse of dumb animals by their
inhumane brothers is becoming alto-
gether too frequent, and it is time that
some of them were dealt with according
to the strict letter of the law. The this

interrupted last'Monday at Columbia College by the ,

interference of theisuperintendent of the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, were resumed
yesterday at the request of Harold P. Brown, elec-

trical engineer. The scene of the experiments was
a. class room in the School of Mines, and they were
conducted by Dr. Cyrus Edson and Dr. Charles F.

Roberts, of the Board of Health. There were pres- r

entl agspectators Commissioners Gibbons and Moss
and r.

sor L. H. Landy, of Columbia College, and Captain .

' An ofﬁcial report of the experiments was after—
wards issued, signed by all the scientists who were
present. The following is the greater part of it:—
"Thc first dog operated upon was a. mongrel

weighing 61 pounds, strong and in good condition. '

His height was 24. inches, length from tip of nose to
base of tail 42 inches and resistance from the right
front leg to the left hind leg 14,000 ohms.

tion was made by binding a. piece of cotton
waste, saturated with water, round the leg with
No. 20 bare copper wire. The dog was placed
in the cage, and the alternating current applied by
Dr. Roberts at 272.16 volts for ﬁve seconds, number
of alternations 288 per second.
and motionless during the continuance of the cur-
rent. He gave a few spasmodic gasps thirty-one sec-

- onds after the current was first applied, and his heart

ceased beating ninety seconds after the current was

. applied. The dog was immediately dissected'by Dr.

Roberts and" Dr. Peterson, and sections of;the sciatic
and pneumogastric nerves and muscular ﬁbres of

the diaphragm and the lungs placed under a micro- ’

scope and no changes in structure were observed.

“The second dog was a full blooded Newfoundland,

electro-motive force for ﬁve seconds. The dog was

silent and motionless during continuance of cur- '

rent; howled and gasped for eight seconds after
circuit was opened. but in the opinion of physicians
present this was purely mechanical action, as the
dog was unconscious from the instant the current
ﬁrst reached him. Heart stopped beating in two
minutes and ﬁfty seconds after current was ﬁrst
applied. ' ‘
A MAN COULDN'T HAVE YELLED.

"The third dog was a half breed setter and New-
foundland, weighing 53 pounds, 42 inches long from
tip of nose to base of tail and 24 inches high. Re:
sistanoe, 30,000 ohms. Connections were made in
the same way as before. Dr. Roberts applied the
alternating current at 220 volts for rive sec~
ends. The result was not fatal at four
minutes afterward. Mr. Porter,
of Machinery at Columbia. College, suggested
that as the dog was rigid and motionless during the

I continuance of the shock, it would be impossible for

a man in the same condition to utter a sound or to
break the contact in ﬁve seconds. Dr. Edson then
determined to administer the current at the same
number of volts for thirty seconds on this account,
and on account of the high resistance of this sub

jecn
died instantly, without sound or struggle. The re-

sistance after death was found to be 2, 800 ohms.
. DEATH was PAINLESS.

“All of the physicians present expressed the opin- ’

ion that a dog had a. higher vitality than a man,
and that therefore a. current that killed a dog would be

fatal to a. man under the same conditions. It was their ,

opinion that all of these deaths were painless, as the
nerves were probably destroyed in less_timo than
that required to transmit the impressmn to the
brain of the subject,

“Dr. Edson invited Professor Elihu Thomson. of
Boston, and Dr. Otto A. Moses. to be present with
measuring instruments to check the voltage, &c.,
but neither of those gentlemen put in an appearance
or responded.” _ ,

Last Thursday forenoon a petite yOung': pl

He quite agreed with her, and summoned a". _
policeman, who made the driver stop his horse.
Agreat crowd gathered, and'when some one

ventured to ask who the. lady was he was in-

After she had left the driver of the truck sent

place where the second horse was endeavoring
to pull the load. The beast had pulled the .;
load as far as Fiftieth street and there the-
trouble ended. for the two ofﬁcers made the
truckman take off part of his load. When Miss '

cents,” he said, darting down the street, evident-
ly fearing that Iintended to hand him over to
the police. . _ .

The poor children in the streets always evince
a desire to make some money by opening a cab
door, 'aSSIStlllg in gathering fallen parcels, or
carrying a bag or valise; and it is interesting: to
observe the speculative, covetous eyes of the
idle and vagrant while watching the newsboys
or bootblacks pitch pennies, especially when the
“not” amounts to several cents. A bootblack
once proudly exhibited a handful of pennies,
anda little girl whispered to her companion:
“Oh, how much money he’s got; I won—
der if his father or mother will take it
away from him I” Puerile hunchbacks always
seem to hold positions of authority ever the
other children, while the lame, or the sickly in-
variably receive sympathy, even if ill-natured,
except possibly from the embryo brute who will
develop into a Bill Sykes. It is observable that
the waits of the street, notwithstanding their
deprivations, their scanty clothing, and hunger,
always thoroughly enjoy themselves at play,
from the youngest toddler. who is put in the
centre of the “ round and round we go.”

The mongrel our, the pet and pride of
some small boy, is always a feature of
a group of the waits of the street. and
I have noticed that the children are

always willing to share their crust with him. I
do not believe there is any happiness in after—
lii’e equal to that experienced by the small boy
in the possession of a dog whom he can drag
about with a rope and who will frolic and romp
with him. The blooded canine pets of the chil=
dren of the rich, to be seen in Bryant Park,
Gramercy Park, and Stuyvesant-square, seem to
be above the playful exuberance of the less fa-
vored ones of the waifs of the street. andthe
same sympathy between the owner and the
brute does not seem to exist. As among
‘the adolescent chanticleers of the barnyard,
there is a continual belligerency among the boys
of the street, and encounters between them are’
common, especially as often encouraged by the
loiterers about the low saloons, ever alert for a
“scrap.” The pernicious habit‘of smoking the
discarded butts of cigars and cigarettes is the
common vice of the small boy ofthc street”, and
as a consequence many of them are delicate and
puny who should be burly and robust. The
newsboys and the bootblacks, who early
learn to take care of themselves, and
who are generally either waits or_ runaways
from home, are not to be conSidered in the cat-
egory of the children of the street, nor the -
juvenile Italian who thumbs the harp, as these
are all regularly employed by a boss and all i
hail from the Italian quarters. The Juvenile .
‘vendor of lozenges on the street cars is gen- .
erally a meek, good little boy W110 hopes in time
to be a newsboy or bootblack when he shall
have learn ed the ways of the WOFId- It may be
stated that the children of the street belonging
to the neighborhood of Thompson-street, below
Washington-square, or West Third-street, West
of Sixth-avenue, are generally better clothed
and healthier than those of our Irish popula-
tion; nor are the colored children as belligerent
or brutal in their plays.

HAVE

PENALTY secluded”

.‘

The Commissioners of the HealthDepart.‘ '
m9“. 011 the recommendation of Mayor Hewitt, 1
have for some time in conjunctionwith the f

800ml}? fer the Prevention of Cruelty to Ani-
mals, been investigating new methods of ad-
ministering the death penalty to Vagrant (logs.
The Mayor’s attention was ﬁrst attracted to the
dog question by complaints from the managers
of the Willard Parker Hospital, atthe foot of
Sixteenth-street, East River, thatthe dog pound

‘ contiguous to that institution was asource of

great annoyance and injury to the patients.
The Mayor appreciated the justice of the com-
plaint and applied his powers and inﬂuence at
once to the removal of the pound to a less ob-
jectionable locality, with the result that it. was
in due course of time removed to the foot of

* East One Hundred and Second-street.

Then the manner of disposing of the dogs
came up for consideration, and considerable cer—
respondence Was had by the Mayor with the

Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Ani—
mals relative to the various modes employed
in the diﬁ'erent cities of the Union. The society
recommended electricity or suileeatiou by car-
bonous oxide gas. The prevailing method of
drowning the dose in a cage, sometimes in
water of ireezing temperature, was felt to be
needlessly cruel and painful. The dogs were
ﬁrst terriﬁed by being crowded by wholesale
into the cage and then subjected to the tedious
methou of drowning, that often did not pro-

recommendatien President Bayles of the Board.
of Health took the experimental investigation
of various other methods in charge. The alter-
nating electric-current method was early elven
up as involving too much expense, although the
results .from a sanitary and humane aspect
were eminently satisfactory.

The carbonous oxide method of sutd‘ocation re-
quired the establishment of an elaborate plant
and apparatus and was also found expensive.
In the search for a sudden and painless method
experiments were also made with suﬂ’ocaticn
by chloroform, and the results thus far apparent
have proved so satisfactory that this method is
likely to be determined upon. It was found
that one—half ounce of a cheap quality or the
poison effected death without pain in two min-
utes. The plant and apparatus necessary for
killing by the use of chloroform will be com-
paratively inexpensive. Further experiments
will be made before ﬁnal decision, in the hope

 

 

of still further reducing.r the expense.

A Peculiar case in Justice Kenna’s Court
Yesterday-The Girl Denied Her ,Guilt,

but the Court Decided Otherwise.

 

The Gates avenue police court was crowded
yesterday afternoon with a‘ motley assemblage
eager to hear the trial of Josephine 'Anrlerson. the
young Swedish servant girl, who was accused by
her employer, Benjamin F. Sutton, of 53 New

York avenue, of deliberately poisoning one of his
' pet dogs. Josephine, who is a rather pretty. fair-
complexioned ,woman of ‘25, was plainly but neatly

dressed and was accompanied by a score of Swed. ‘

Counselor Anderson. 'while Counselor George F.
Elliott conducted the prosecution. _ ’

”Mr. Sutton told, under oath, how his brood of
four dogs had been afﬂicted with a peculiar ail-
ment nearly two weeks ago, for which he
was unable to account. On Friday; the 28.51)
ult., he was attacked himself with a sick
stomach, continual retching. and a burn.

thirst. which he was unable to quench. His suspi-

The arrest- f

in the case. Everybody except the of-

Ths chair that was terminated in such un-

‘ common fashion was the second meeting of the
. second season of the Hempstead Coursiug Club.

The ﬁrst event of the meeting was a. match
course between L. and W. Rutherford’s don“,
the Warren Spider, and R. D. Winthrop’s doe.
Meadowm-ook Jack. Fortunately for Jack’s
CWHGY the match was disposed of soon after 11
o’clock, for had it been run according to pro—
gramme it would hardly have been ﬁnished. A
more beautifulday for the not very exciting
sport could not have been selected. The air
was keen, but the sun. was bright. The ground
was so level that the smallest rabbit‘on Loni;P
Island couldn’t have hidden himself from view
at a distance of a quarter of a mile. The
square was outlined with red, white, and blue

liars, and the scales and other paraphernalia =

were housed in a startlingly—ploturesque
marquee. Fifteen or twenty small wooden boxes
formed a straight line on a. sward that had evi-
dently been somewhat shrivcleu by Winter’s

breath. From each box came shrill and inccs- w

numerous and the fair sex was cheeringly rep-

It was announced that the meeting would be
opened at 11 o’clock with a parade before the
breed judge. The latter was nowhere visible
and the parade was dispensed with. It was

evident that the pace w as to be forced, for the "1

match course was started ahead of time, maybe

on account of a rumor that the sport might be }
interrupted before the day was OVer. The count ‘

seemed clear when Meadow Brook Jack and‘the
Warren Spider and a rabbit became actors in a

decided not to engage counsel immediately, but
to ask for an adjournment. They were advised
. that they could waive exclamation and allow
the case to go before the Grand Jury, or elect

l to be tried at the Special Sessions
Court. The accused pleaded not guilty
! and chose a trial before the General

itersionsCourt. It was agreed that the trial
should beheld to-morrow at 3 o’clock at Hemp-
stead. Then the question of ball was discussed.
The Justice thought it would be unneccessary
to put the accused under bail. He would parole
them, as they were men of honor. This was
Satisfactory to everybody, but there was one
point upon which the clubmen were in doubt.
Could they return to Garden City and ﬁnish the
meeting without further trouble? The . oﬁicers
shook their heads and said they would be com-
pelled to make more arrests. The Justice said
the meeting“ could not be finished except at the
risk of the accused, and so the second most of
the season of the Hcmpstead Coureing Club
came to an end that was satisfactory to no one
except Mr. Bergh’s oiiicers and Justice Clouds.

T he clubmsu intend to make a. still light for
the right to kill rabbits in this particular way.
They nlsinlain that it is much more humane
than the shoot-lug of rabbits. Mr. Belmont
told the Justice that a rabbit that had lost his
head in 16 seconds after he was liberated could
hardly complain of having been subjected to a
lingering death. The Justice refused to com-
mit himself. The trial is likely to attract an
interested as well as a fashionable throng.
the decision should be unfavorable to the club
there will be a sudden slut in the fox-terrier
market.

WELL KNOWN SPORTSMEN ARRESTED.

M

A Black Eye 'for the Pastime of Rabbit
Killing by Fox Terriers.

 

The gentleman sportsmen who are admirers of
fox terriers assembled at Garden City, L. I., yester-
day as guests of the Hempstead Coursing Club, the
occasion being the second meeting of the season in
the sport of killing rabbits, but the enjoyment Was
brought to a sudden termination by the arrest or
several of the participants.

There were about a hundred spectators, and as
the day was ﬁne, the game plentiful and the entries
numerous some very interesting sport was prom.
lead. The course is near the village, and no secrecy
was made of the event. It was noticed by the gen-
tlemen interested that there were a number of sus-
picious looking men standing about. but little
thought was given to any possible interrUption.

THE sron'r BEGINS.

The ﬁrst dogs were in the slips promptly at half.

past eleven o’clock, and it was decided to ﬁrst run
' oﬁ‘the match between Messrs. L. and W. Rutherford’s
dog Warren Spider, and R. D. Winthrop’s nomina-
tion of H. B. Richardson’s dog Meadow Brook J not;
for‘$100 a. side, best in ﬁve courses. Both of these
nominations were good. strong dogs, but had been ‘i
beaten in the ﬁnals at the ﬁrst meeting this season, 3
.held at Cedarhurst. The Richardson dog was in ‘
ﬁnch better form than at the early November meet- ;

denly threw open their overcoats and displayed the
shining silver badges of the American Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. ' . .
Had an earthquake swallowed up the Hempstead’i

- Coursin‘g Club, with all the ﬁne kennels of Queen‘s 3
'county, the gentlemen sportsmen could not have i
l

 

 

been more completely surprised. , l
Superintendent Frank 0. Clark, of the Brooklyn ”
branch of the society, stepped briskly up to August l
Belmont, Jr., and placed him under arrest, while i.
his assistants, W. H. Denyse and F. Bernhardt, were i
“capturing” W. Rutherford and Frederick 0. Beach. ,
Diiicers John A. Gay and George H. Lambert, of Mr, ,
Bergh’s New York oﬂice, gathered in John Doty, who ‘.
Was at the traps, and William Reardon, who is ,
Mr. Belmont’s man. Mr. Rutherford was mounted _:
on a pony, but he did not attempt to escape. i.
_ There was still another ofﬁcer, A. F. Glover, of '
the Brooklyn S. P. C. A. “force,” and he looked _~
around to ﬁnd somebody upon whom to lay his l
ofﬁcial hands. He ﬁnally rushed over the course i
and “arrested” the dead rabbit which bore the
marks of naughty Flora Tatters’ teeth. 5
THE MEETING BROKEN UP.
It was an awful swoop in its suddenncss and the i
spectators began to look anxiously about them to i
ﬁnd a route by which to escape either to the woods 1
or to Austin Corbin’s railroad and so on home. They !
were mentally calculating how many h eats it would 9
require to beat the society’s ofﬁcers when the eagle ;
eye of Superintendent Clark, in command of the}
raiding force, chanced to alight upon a. small. party 3;
of gentlemen whom he supposed to be Wall street 3'
bankers. He displayed his silver shield again and ’2
was proceeding to scoop in the party when some- 1‘
body whispered that they were reporters, and he ‘.
halted in his victorious onslaught. i
The meeting was broken up. * 1 l
‘ Not afew ol’ the participants in the sport felt};
broken up too, and to say that the circumambiencs
atmosphere of beautiful Garden City was laden‘Wltlr-gr
.. the ccrulean tint of a. cyclone of cuss words would-;;_
be stating it mildly. Mad? Why, the gentlemen '
sportsmen were angry enough to make poor, dear ;
old Henry Bergh turn over in his grave. . i
_ ' rnisounns ARRAIGNED. l
Mr. Belmont was upset. Mr. Beach’s beautiful ‘
' white teeth came together with a. snap as if Oﬁicer
Clark’s head would certainly be bitten off quite.
while Mr. Rutherford's highly indignant gaze pierced I
the “force" through and through. It was awful. _ .
The “prisoners” were marched oil to Hcmpstoad: '1 ,
village, a. mile or two away, but not to a. dungeon
cell. Justice Valentine Clowes received the excited, -‘
party in his ofﬁce, and the most wonderful rumdrd-H
spread among the village folk. Many believedthfaiﬁi-
a. murder had been committed, but when they
learned that only a. dozen little rabbits‘had been}:
killed they smiled in derision at the “cruel” oiﬁcers of
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. ‘
Superintendent Clark charged his prisoners with '
a. violation of seclion No. 655 of the Penal Code in
"wilfully, unlawfully, wickedly and unjustiﬁably
mutilating and killing an animal—to wit, a rabbit,"
and the complainant claimed to act under sectionv
No. 668 of the Penal Code as amended bythelast
Legislature. - »
The act to which he referred is chapter 490 of the .
Law: of 18238.- which confers upon the agents of Mr.
Bergh’s society the authority to actindependently
as peace ofﬁcers. Heretofore they were compelled
to not outside the boundaries of their county only‘ .
when deputized by the local Sheriff. Thoaoﬁ'cnce is
a misdemeanor under the law, and is punishable as ‘
such by imprisonment not to exceed one year in the
Penitentiary and a. ﬁne not over $250. Horrible! ‘
RELEASED ON PAROLE. , - _
The magistrate concluded that the “accused” we. .65
entitled to the beneﬁt of counsel. and as th i.“
claimed that they were “not guilty" he set the '
amination for Friday next, at three o’clock, in" 131%
Town Hall of Hempstead. because that is the on ‘ l:
building in the village which can possibly hold‘t '5:
great crowd expected to be present. The priloners, l
were released on their own recognizances. ,
The sport of the day was eﬁ'ectually stopped, and .
the delectable lunch which was spread for the guests "
at the Stewart Arms went untested, because appetttos
were gone—and the ladies, bless them, how fright-
ened they did look when their husbands and sweet- . -
hearts were hustled oil“ to the court! They gathered;

7 chasing and killing of rabbits by fox-terriers, is .

. cruelty to animals or not. The cause of this con-
troversy was the arrest. of prominent gentlemen
at the meeting this season or the Ilempslead
Coursing Club. The ﬁrst meeting was held at
Ccdarnurst on the ﬁrst Saturday in November,
since which the Hempstead Club have leased
grounds about nalf a mile to the west of St. John’s
College, at Garden City.

The grounds were made picluresque With a tent
and ﬂags, and rabbits were plentiful. The entries
for the Challenge Stakes were at 15 lb. eacn and
under, and those for the Garden City Clip at 18 lb.
and under. The former had 11 entries and the lat-
ter 14. There was also: Consolation Sweepstakes
for dogs beaten for the Challenge Stakes and Gar-
1- den City Cup on the cards, and a match for $100 a
side. best in five courses, on the “cards.”

The match had been decided and three courses
in the ﬁrst round for the Challenge Stakes run.
when Supt. F. 0. Clark, of the Brooklyn branch of
the Society lor the Prevention of Cruelty to Ani-
mals, appeared on the ileld backed by four otllcers,
two-or which were irom New York. The dislilay
. of authority caused some little excitement and
surprise. The omccrs arrested Mr. W. G. Ruther—

slipper. and W. Reardon and J. Doly, who were act-

_ ._ FOR. OUTC-ASTS. . .

' i151 Trlbu‘n reporter recently called upon that
energetic philantluopist Elbridge '1‘; Gerry, Whose
Work as the" head of the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children has made him as widely known,
perhaps, in that ﬁeld of pi actical benevolence as was
his friend and co worker IIenry B01 gh, in connection
With the prevention of cruelty to animals. The
reporter’s cm and to Mr. Geriy‘ was to ascertain the
truth of a rumor that his society had lately instituted
a. general raid upon the buotblaeks and had placed a
large number of them in vaiious institutions. This action
Was said to be only the beginning of a general crusade
against the newsboys, matchboys, and ether miniature
merchants of the city who were reported to have
fallen under the ban of the society. It tu1ned out that

the only foundation for these rumors was the fact that '

two Italian bootblacks were to be brought up in court

the next day on habeas corpus proceedings to be '

taken by their guardians.

Taking this story as his text, Mr. Gerry explained
at length the policy of the society in this and other
matteis, and gave many interesting details regarding
the general features of their wmk. “ This report,”
said he, “ is only one of the many efforts at scnSational

misrepresentation to which the society is continually '

subjected by those who, from self—interest or malice

P008, DEAR CHAPPIES!

m-———__—_.

They Were Coursing Rabbits
and the Law Stopped Them.

 

Seventy of the Little Animals Await the
Decision of the Court as to Whether
the Sport Is Legal.

There are seventy little snow-white rabbits in
“big box down at Hempstmid. L. L, who are
anxiously awaiting the decision of the Court of
Special Sessions today as to the legality Of
rabbit coursing.

Messrs. August Belmont, Jr., Winthrop Ruther-
furd, William Roardon and I". 0. Bunch. of the
Hempstead Cour-sing Club, were arrested on
Wednesday afternoon by Superintendent I“. C.
Clark, of the Society {or the Prevention 0f
Cruelty to Animals. who also arrested John
DOW. 811 employs of the club, for chasing rabbits
with dogs in Garden City.

There were a number of society people present

 

when the sports were thus interruntcd by the
law. The list of spectators comprised such well-
known people as Mr. and Mrs. S. S. Sands, Mr.
and Mrs. S. Dillon Ripley. Miss Edith Morgan

Mrs. August Belmont, Jr., Mr. and Mrs. Arthur

, Kennedy, Miss May Bird, Mr. T. '1‘. linslnuore,

Mr. James Kernochan. Mrs. Dodge. Mr. Huey.
Mr. Charles Carroll, Dr. C. G. J. Finn and Mr.
Stanley Mortimer. .

' eCI‘sd With violating section 0.3.3 of the Criminal
‘0 e.
Justice Clowes asked the young Sport‘-
men what they had to say, dwelling upon llH‘
fact that the penalty for such a misdemeanor Is a
tine of $50 or six months in jail. .‘dr. Belmont
and his friends waived examination. and said
that they desired to be tried in the Hoinpstead
Town Hall. Mr. (Ilark paroled the prisoners. al-
thp‘mh they had plenty of friends present who
oﬂered to bail them if necessary. .
Mr. Belmont was very indignant at the action
or the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty 10
Animals.
_, "Why.” said he, “this arrest is an unwar‘
l;:¥ant_ed imposition and an outrage. “e in‘Ol’OS“
alowake a test case or this. and I am conﬁdent

five ofﬁcers to the ‘Hempstead Coursing

arrested for violating the law. Their of-

OH‘Trial for Cruelty to Animals—Fash-
ionable Society Folk Thrall: the Court
Room—ﬂotsam for the Coursers.

, Hempstead, L. 1., was in a high state of ex-
citement yesterday, of a degree to which the
staid old town has long been a stranger, and
from noon to nearlvmidnight the Town Hall was
crowded by eager spectators. August Belmont,

Jr., William Rutherford. F. 0. Beach, William
Beardon, all prominent society and club '
men, and John 'Doty, one of Mr. Belmont’s .
cmployees,were on trial for a misdemeanor :

and violation of the statute for the prevention
of cruelty to animals.» The charge was made
by Superintendent Frank '0. Clark of. the
Brooklyn branch of the 8.1). C. A., acting
“under the instructions of President Henry
Bergh. ‘ ,
The complaint recited. that the defendants
éwere guilty of procuring dogs to torture rab-
bits to death at the second meeting of the
Bempstead Coursing 'Club, held at Garden
City oi. Wednesday last. On that day the
prisoners were arrested by Clark and ﬁve other

Ofﬁcers in citizens’ clothes. They were taken C.
before Justice B. V. Clowns and paroled for .'
examination yesterday. The penalty for the ‘

offense is $50 ﬁne or three months’ imprison-
ment, or both. '

The court room was ﬁlled with a motley
crowd. The farmer’s wife, in plain calico,
ajostled elbows with richly dressedssociety

ﬂames, and the hostler, in gray corduroy, stood
patiently during all the hours shoulder to
shoulder with his faultlessly attired employer.
.As the trial went on the crowd increased, until

rat 8 o’clock even the steps of the hall were .

i"iammed.

Among the prominent people from thisclty :
and elsewhere present were Mrs. Sidney Dillon ~

Ripley, Miss May Bird, Mrs. August Belmont, '

Jr.. Mrs. H. A. S. Haddon, Mrs. Elliott Roose-

.Velt, Mrs. S. S. Sands, Mrs. Charles Carroll,
. Mrs. Whitney Applebv, Mrs. Rutherford, Mrs.

Dodge, Mrs. F. ‘0. Bird, Dr. Finn, Stanley
Mortimer and T. T. Rushmore.

Henry Bergh, alert and attentive, whispered
instructions to his men. Surrogate A. H.

Weller looked after the defense, while George ‘

'1‘. Elliott appeared for the prosecution.

Justice Clowes, who presided at the‘trial, is t

,3. tall, slim gentleman, withahigh forehead

and aquiline nose. A pair of glasses do not
hide the glint. of-a pair of keen eyes. His face
do covered with a long patriarchal beard.

He is a painstaking magistrate, and when at
times opposing; counsel grew wrathy over

some disputed piece of evidence, he always ,

succeeded in calming the belligerents. Beside
him was Justice Bernardus Hendrickson,
smooth-shaven, and with a crown of white
hair. Circulating around the room Was
Justice De Mott of Rockville Centre. The
:gidence was taken down by Stenographer
7 all.

The ﬁrst difﬁculty arose over the selection of
in jury. A panel of twelve had been called and
i'wcre put through a severe course of sprouts.
Especially were the men questioned upon
“their relations with the defendants. FiVe
challenges were allowed, and the panel Was

. exhausted With only three men in the box.

Their opinion as to the propriety and
cruelty of coursing as a sport was rigidly in-
quired into, and this led tosome legal spar.
ring between counsel, while exception alter

ness donned his mostiashionable clothing
and turned his steps toward the Town Hall
before 3 o’clock in the afternoon.
Valentine Clouds appeared on the street ina
broadcloth suit and a sills hat that must have
brought tears to the eyes of the oldest inhabit—
ant. The Justice also wore a. thoughtful
air. He was to have the unusual pleasure
of hearing a case in which the defendants
were well—known New-Yorkers who were
accused of cruelty to animals in coursing

rabbits at Garden City on Wednesday. In THE
TIMES of Thursday appeared an account of the
meeting of the Hempstead Coursing Club and
the arrest of August Belmont, J r., W. Ruther-
ford, Frederick Hoev, and F. 0. Beach, and two
men who attender to the rabbits, William
Reardon and John Doty by name. The accused
were paroled Wednesday until yesterday after-

the hour had it been in condition.

Hempstead’s Town Hall is not large, and in
ﬁve minutes after the doors were opened it. was
packed so densely that the air in it was thick
enough to bite. The centre and rear of the hall

,Was occupied by rustios, nearly all of whom

Was a strong contingent of apparently prosper-

easily identiﬁed by their foot gear. In 3 corner
by themselves were the four ofﬁcers who made
the arrests, and seated among them was Henry
Bergh, like enough to his father to be easily
icked out of a. crowd.

A bevy of‘fasbionable women sat on the left
of the hall,:soeminaly interested in all that oc-
curred. Among them were Mrs. August Bei-

on a. black horse, riding after two dogs “which ’-
was a chasing oione rabbit.” The dogs caught
the rabbit and killed it. He saw J. W. Rutherford pg]
riding a horse and following two dogs that were f-
following a. rabbit. Reardon was follow-i
ing the dogs. Doty‘ let the rabbit
go and Beach slipped the dogs. an
can also acted as judge of aoourse. He heard
' r. Belmont call out. when the dogs killed a“:
rabbit, “two points.” The witness identiﬁed a;
rabbit that lacked a. head and a bit of its back. _
as one that had been killed. at Garden City on; :
Wednesday. The missing head had been torus
off. A rabbit’s root was also identiﬁed. 2' .

Thefox-hunting dudes on Long Island »
are sore pressed as to what to do with .
themselves lately. There are no foxes to .
. chase. . The dogs show their contempt for ’
, the anise seed bags The dudes are too '
high-toned to vent any of their surplus
energies in measuring out lard and
[ molasses. or engaging in any other of the

tradeSmen’s occupations wherein all their '
“ fathers made their money, and, at any
f rate, out in Hempstead, the dudes are en-
._* : gaged in'rabbit coursing, i. e., chasing "

g and killing rabbits by means of their fox 3
3' . terriers. They have got an organization -

" called the Hempstead Coursing Club. j
‘1 ; which has grounds leased about half at
, , gutle west of St. John’s College, Garden

. 1 y. » .
a g The, 'ennuied dudes were having a E
_ i “meet” Wednesday. when Supt. F. O.
' _, Clark. of the Brooklyn branch of the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to '.
_ Animals. appeared on the ﬁeld backed by '
} four ofﬁcers. The display of authority“

caused some little. excitement and-sur- '
- prise. The ofﬁcers -arrested;¢_.Mr. W. G. .
, , Rutherford. the acting-judge; Mr. F O. I
- ‘1 Beach, the slipper,.and W. Reardon and f

. J. Doty, who were acting as rabbit hand. -

j had acted asJudge; in the match. was :'
‘ added to the number. The prisoners were
, Informed thatthey must appear immedi- 9
‘ ately before Justice Olowes. The sport ?
. was at once stopped, the dogs were re. .
l jturned to their boxes, and the ladies. of 7

AN UNMANLY SPORT. 1
The verdict of “ not guilty” rendered yes-
terday at Hempstead in the case of the mem-
bers of the Hempstead Coursing Club arrested ,
for cruelty to animals, does not make the 80’-
called ‘ ' sport” of rabbitcoursing anything
else than a senseless and brutal amusement. '
There is nothing manly, nothing elevating,
nothing useful about it. If our young men
possessed enough American independence
and self-respect not to lianker after everyl
thing that is “ English you know.” they i
would no more think of being found at a;
coursing-match than at a prize—ﬁght or a dog- '
pit.

The American people admire manly sports.
They are better turfmen than the English.
As yachtsmen they beat the world. They
can hold their own in all athletic sports. run-

THE brutal outrage committed by the Brooklyn agents of the So-
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals upon members of. the
. Hempstead Coursing Club last Wednesday has been, and is Still» the
theme of indignant gOSSiP in this city. 3

WM“

I AM glad to know that Messrs. Belmont, Rutherford, Beach, Rear- L,
den and Hoey were subsequently acquitted of the gross charge brought l

der- hearted women Who attended the coursing march in question, and l , /
who were witnesses of the humane and ennobling sport which it i '
afforded, were not dragged into unenviable notoriety by having been ‘ ‘
made parlz‘ceps crz’mz‘m’s in these disgracefuliy illegal proceedings. .
" Seeiery must have amusement. T he pastimes of society must be dis:
tinct in letter and in spirit from the amusements oi the groveling’ lower
classes. When the butcher, the baker or the candlestick-maker de-
sires to amuse himself and his struggling family he seeks out the dime
_ museum, the broad and wellsvcnrilated park, the cheap theatre, Or an
' exciting but distinctly-colored View of the peripatectic circus. His re-
_ creations are purely conventional. What amuses him amuses the ten
thousand and one of his companions in poverty and ignorance. It, ;-
would never do for the aristocrat, the men and women of many mil— "
lions and. heirs, to follow these humble votaries of pleasure in the di— '3.
versions of their choice. ‘2

I AM pained and surprised that a society so modern and so instinct ,L

‘ with the spirit of the nineteenth century as the Society for the Preven- i
, tion of Cruelty to Animals, should presume to dictate to our noble 4:00 1*
and their several dependencies, the methods, ways,‘and means of their , -
enjoyment. , What is a rabbit in its gasping struggle for life in a well-
fenccd enclosure ﬁlled with ﬁerce and ﬂeet—footed hounds, thatthish
.si rescuershesld,_,.,,dsteie assassin cesss,,-?...hehsiss-a£9.rslzldtsf‘il
They have long ears, long legs and a natural ‘ aptitude for running and l
in elusion, and when placed in front of a well-trained bevy of, lordly 1:

rapidity which command the admiration of the tender beholders. It ;
is true that their furred lives are just as precious to them as are theirs ,
to the silken-clad and jeweled occupants of the boxes, reserved bythe ,'
. managers of this select feast for their friends and patrons ; but, after
. all, the rule of the survival of the ﬁttest still governs society; and, if
;. rabbits are fools enough to allow themselves to be captured by society, -

they must take the hounds and the consequences. .

 

To silence all cavil and render innocuous any slanderous report ‘
against the humanity of the Hempstead Coursing Club,.ir is. only neces- ,
" sary for me to mention the names of the ladies who graced this last auspi-
cious occasion with their honorable presence. There were Mrs. August 3
Belmont, J12, Mrs. S. S. Sands, Mrs. Kennedy, Miss Edith Morgan, MISS 7
Dodge, Mrs. M. Bird and Miss Bird among the most conspicuous. ._
Would these gentle maids and matrons have lent their smiles and rap- 7
turous applause to a case of malignant cruelty to a helpless, dumb
brute, incapable of defending himself? No, no. The very fact that ,
these ladies were present, argues that the noble game of bare and z,
hounds as conducted by the Hempstcad Coursmg Club was as labso-
' lutely devoid of even the appearance of cruelty as it is'possmle to imag- a
‘ ice. I cannot conceive that a loving wife, a romantic maiden, a ten- .
. der-hearted mother, could sit calmly by beholding an utterly defence-
less rabbit in a fenced enclosure, pursued and mangled unto death by a
pack of rivaling hounds in the name of sport and pleasure. It is the 5 .
lrule of every sportsman that every animal sacriﬁced in the name of .,
' sport, shall have a reasonable chance for its life. It is a rule among a
‘ votaries of pleasure that no pleasure shall be taken which causes pain ,’
' Under these rules, which are invariably observedby the i
enlightened 400, it is impossible that the Hempstead Coursmg Club
, should have carried out its entertainment as reported in the newspa- :‘

pers.

 

I WROTEVthe above under misapprehension. I did not believe What .
' I heard.- It seemed to me equally monstrous and impossible that any .
woman save the squaw of an Apache Indian could esteem 1t apleasure ;
, to gaze upon the suffering and toe death of a fr1endless animal, not:
given the chance in the struggle for its liberty or its life. I know Murs.
Belmont, I know Mrs. Sands, I know Mrs. Rennedy, I have gazedwith _‘
admiration upon Miss Edith Morgan, upon MISS Dodge and Miss f
Bird, and it struck me as a thunderbolt of revelation that these vclvet—
. handed, soft-voiced and gentle-spirited woman should have gilded this 1
saturnine occasion of cruelty with their presence and smiles. True If ,
is that the sport is English, and whatever is English 18 in the fashion . .
but equally true that it was a bloody, barbaric, unwholesome, degré; ; .4
in and wantonly cruel spectacle, for which the rational thllgth :6 :
pleasure could Offer no rational excuse. _How these ladies wolf“ bit-
enjoyed the grand old days of ensangumed Romel How, 1 1d have .
Chery of Christian martyrs in the arena of the Coliseumwou h rein ,
commanded their delighted applause! How the Inquisitionng’ t: the l
thousands of Jews and apostates were racked, scourged, burne a .0

MRS. SCHMIDT AGQUI’lltD.

 

A JURY says .3319 DIDN’T POISON
HER NEIGIIBORS’ CHICKFJVS-J

 

A Serious Phase ofa. Chronic Wrangle—u-
Paris Green Found Scattered About
and a Whole Family Sickencdw'l‘hings
Looked Blue for Mrs. Schmidt but She
Got 01? Luckily and Now Talks of a.
Suit for Heavy Damages-«An Interest»
ing Trial.

Four neat frame dwellings on Moli’att

of continual cenflicts between their respective
occupants for months past. It has been a con»
ventional case of feminine differences and never
assumed a more serious aspect than a trivial ex-
hibition of maliciousness or an animated ex-
change of’ uncomplimentary epithets until quite
recently. Then the gravity,Y of the difﬁculty was
attested by the narrow escape of the residents
thercabouts from death by poisoning.

These unneighborly neighbors are Mrs. Sophia
Hopkins, of 267 Moti‘attstreet; Mrs. Helena Haas,269
Moil‘agt street; Mrs. Amelia Schmidt, ‘27l liot‘l‘att
street, and Mrs. Charlotte Miller, 277 Mol’futt street.
Between the last two houses is a large open lot in
which the chickens belonging to each of the
.women except Mrs. Schmidtlhave been wont to
while awvay the hours in Characteristic Sportive-
ness. The tribulations of this lively quartet have
invariably been ventilated in court and reciprOn
cal binding over to keep the peace was the result. '

Allah's ﬁnally reached that stage when each had
the other under bonds. Then they resumed their
original antics. Threats are said to have been
liberallyexchanged. but none were apparently put
into execution until‘the chickens belonging to all
except Mrs. Schmidt began to show evidences of a
peculiar ailment and drop off rapidly. Mrs. Miller
lostthirtyﬁvc in one day and the others nearly
as many. In each instance the symptoms were
the same. The bird’s legs seemed to" be suddenly
and uncxplicably paralyzed, after which it laid

' down and gracefully gave up the gh )St. Early in
November Mrs. Hopkins slaughtered a pair of,

birds and utilized their carcasses for a Sunday
dinner. The meal was heartily partaken ofby the
family and nothing unusual occurred until about
10 o‘clock the same night, when each of the diners
was attacked ‘with violent cramps in the stomach
and continual retching. The conclusion was their
arrivcd'at that‘the chickens had been poisoned,
and a survey of their erstwhile stamping ground
on the open lot near by was taken the succeeding
day. The result * fully justiﬁed the suspicions.

corn were found covered with a green substance,
The analysis to which it was subjected proved
that the green substanCe was no other than arson»
ide of copper, probably known better as Paris
green. Mrs. Hopkins made known her discovery
to Mrs. Miller and Mrs. Haas, and after carefully

-- putting their heads together they determined that

Mrs. Schmidt was alone responsible. Antagonism

“had been rampant among the four, but as the

three had formed a pronounced combination
against Mrs. Schmidt, they concluded that 3113
adopted that means of offsetting the advantage
given them by numerical superiority:

prosecution, while Counselor kramer looked after
the defense. Mrs. Schmidt had demanded a trial

Dr. Max liardwickson, of :29 Kiossnth place, dc-

gave it as his opinion that the birds were killed by
nothing else than Paris green. That was also, he '

bought, the cause of sickness in the Hopkins
family. . -
in her own behalfllirs. Schmidt climbed nimbly
to the witness stand and rattled ofi'a tale that had
some semblance of plausibility. Subsequently, in
summing up, Lstwycr Elliott ventured the asscra
tion that most of it owed its orgin to Lawyer
Kramer’s fertile genius. Lawyer Kramer offered a
mild denial of the soft impeachment. Mrs.
Schmidt went on to explain that she kept Paris
green constantly on hand for vermin, that she
willingly gave some to De Nyseand that she signed .
the paper he handed her in blissful ignorance of
its contents. The. paper purports to be a full com
l'cssion. I

“ lie said his wife was German and asked me to
go to see him,” she added. .

Mrs. Henrietta Gage, of Eighty-ninth street and
First avenue, New York, Mrs. Schmidt’s mother,
swore that she had overheard Mrs. Hopkins and
her two followers vowing to put Mrs. Schmidt out
of the way. Each of the three was recalled to
deny the allegation. . .

The opposing counsel summed up at length and '
Justice Kenna delivered one of his typical forcible ‘
charges to the jury. Then the jurors retired, re
mained out less than half an hour and came back
with a verdict of acquittal. The result was a.
bombshell to most. of those interested. and to none
more so than to Justice Kenna and Lawyer Elliott.
Lawyer Kramer cvcn admitted. that he was more
fortunate than he anticipated.

Mrs. Schmidt was discharged, and a suit: for big
damages against the society is now on the tapis.

FRIDAY EVENING, DECEMBER 7, 1888.

 

f‘!’ 7 ______.___“‘ A ”7‘, V M

A Hempstead jury has acquitted Mr. Au—
gust Belmont, Jr., oft-he charge of criminal
cruelty to animals, preferred by the; ofﬁcers of

,Mr. Bergli’s society. The offense of the

young man was that he gave encouragement
to an alleged sport known as rabbit coursing,
which is highly, popular in England, but
'WlllCl’l has been only recently introduced in
this country.

Hempstead Club gave its exhibition. A num—

ber of ladies, including Mrs. Roosevelt, Mrs. '

Sidnev Dillon Ripley, Miss Edit-h Morgan
and Mrs. Dodge, were there, and Mr. Belmont
black
like a knight ready for the
of coursing is to make a race between two
dogs, which, having been excited by the
sight of: a rabbit in a cage, start after him the
moment- hc is let loose. It is no doubt axmus~
ing, particularly to the ladies, to see the dogs
chase, overtake and then bite poor bunny,
Whose remains are quietly removed in order
to make way for another victim. But What
are the feelings of the rabbit as he makes a
desperate effort to save himself, the dogs
speeding on behind ? Is it a. cheering expe-
rience to have to run for life with the
knowledge. that at any moment the fangs. of
the pursue): may be buried in the ﬂesh? F01.
it is to be assumed that bunny is well aware
of (the fate that awaits him in case he is caught.
He may not be able to reason it out, but he
knows that all those ﬁne ladies and gentlemen
are not there for nothing. and that much is
expected of him. \Vhat are his prospects of

‘ Y WV ‘1: -. r ‘ ,
escape? The ans“ er dcpenu. much 0.1 the

running 0 . . .
with that of the dogs, but it is Sure to say that

the former has even less of a- chance than a
pigeon sprung from a trap covered by the
gunslof a dozen expert shots. It is not our in-
tention to condemn the sport, if such it may
be called, for we realize that it allords keen
, delight to such highly sensitive souls as those
of Mr. Belmont and Mr. Frederick Hoey,
and, moreover, there are directions in which
it may be -made‘ to serve a. really excellent

their attention to the Club members and took more interest 3

of the members and throwing b ick their coats so that the

were charmed as if by the gaze of a basilisk. A. thunder

THE Meadowbrook Hounds will meet Tuesdays, Thurs
days and Saturdays at "the kennels at 1 P. M. during De-
cember. These hunts are very fashionable and equally
delightful. Iconoclasts may sneer at them as Anglo-
maniaisms, but they lose sight of one very important fact,
and that is that. these chases after the ﬂying fox over
country are the ﬁnest school for horsemen that has been
deVised. It is estimated that the English spend fonr.
millions annually in this sport, but it is money well spent, ,

, It makes them strong and enduring;- it keeps men of ,

leisure out of the mischief which idleness invites; it ren»
ders them daring, intrepid horsemen; and it is to this

‘ sport. that England owes much of its prestige in the

cavalryarm of the military service, to which Tennyson

has paid tribute in his “ Charge, of the Light Brigade.”
. Fox hunting was (me of the favorite Sports of the South

prior to the war, and during the civil conﬂict the effect was

shown in the superiority of the Confederate over the

Federal cavalry.
A great many and some very worthy people argue that
fox-hunting is a brutal; unnecessarily cruel sport. This

.‘ conclusion proceeds upon a maudlin, sentimental process
. of reasoning... It‘by no means follows that the fox is always,

caught. for a clever fox can llaﬂle a pretty good pack. But

,, admitting that the fox is always caught, the fox is a sort
, of vermin. He is a terror to every hen-roost within a mile

of his “ earth." The farmer is always looking for a chance

‘ to shoot him. All farmers are not good shots, and a charge ‘
p of shot from a fowling-piece gives a fox inﬁnitely: more

1, pain and suffering than being hunted. The hunt is con-

\ ducted upon a fair and sportsmanlike principle. The fox‘
, is allowed a chance. He gets the start of the pack and is
followed for miles, always with a fair chance of escaping. ,
. He furnishes amusement for the hunters, as well as con-

tributing to a sport that is inv1gorating and useful in a
practical sense, as it makes more good riders than do the
riding schools.

Why ShariklNot a. Monpment Be Exec
- to Henry Ber‘gf‘l'i? , ' ,
To the Editor of The Press: Several days since—'1

I read an article in your paper (Sunday edition) '

from the pen of my old time friend, Joseph 2

Howard, J in, on the subject of monuments, and ,

urging that certain men who have died should,

have such recognition of. their good deedawhileg
living as monuments give. Greeley, Beecher,

Peter Cooper and others were mentioned, but

not one word of that best of all good men, Henry

B-ergh. Why? Are his good works not worthy

of commemoration? He. the friend and defender

with which his name seemed to die out of the

(and resentment, too, for that matter) the omis.
sion of it in an article written in the interests qf
such men and their memory, and by a. large
minded man at thatv-one whose assignment Of
merits is proverbial for being just.

And yet how unjust it was to name so many
and not him. In fact, not to name him ﬁrst, at
the head of the list, for if any man over de-
served honor from his kind. such as monuments ,
imply, that man was and is Henry Bergh, =

The lCiiglish aristocracy is probably
the most eruel class of human beings in
the world. They have starved Ireland
and tlirottled and robbed liidia: they
swiiidled and bullied the thirteen Ameri —
lean (,‘olonies; they kept subsidized l‘Iu-
irope at war for centuries; and they de-
iliberately adopted the policy of brutal-
liZiiig their own common people. by eruel

'tianity have discouraged its needless lil-

lhave kept up the prize ring. the dog, rat:

iﬁfty different forms of “sport" by whieh
l the mortal pangs of man or beast can he
enjoyed and gloated over. More than
,this, they have uiihappily been able in
iexport this depraved taste to the New
‘World, where it is carefully l'ostered and
;nursed byweekly and daily newspapers.
‘ The man who works for honest wages,
' striving to support an honest family and
ito fulﬁll his duties as an Amerieau eiti-
.jzen, has no sympathy with thesr- high—

But there is of course a raee ot' erop-
eared and broken-nosed lat-keys ready
to take part in them. The existent-e of
so Vile a class is the price we pay tor the.
blessing of a would-be aristoeraey in this
country. The verdict of acquittal last

'with cruelty to animals, shows that

COURSING DESPITE COPS.

 

A Crowd of Hempstead Villagers Sympathizel

Willi the Sportsmen.

 

FIVE MORE} ARRESTS.

 

No small amount of fun and some exciting scenes
were furnished yesterday by the Society for the Pre-

Coursing Club, ﬁve men being placed under arrest
for killing rabbits at the meet. ‘
Mr. Henry Bergh has renewed his war against rab-

termined to suppress the sport, or at least make it
unpopular, and appearances indicate that he will
succeed, much to the regret of several score of fash-
ionable New Yorkers who frequentthe pretty village
of Hempstead. And the gentlemen sportsmen of

the coursing club are just as persistent, too. in -

maintaining their rights to have their dogs chase
the little bunnies over the plainsr
The ground was staked oﬁ‘ early in the morning. ‘

about a mile north of the village, on an open field “

belonging to the A. T. Stewart estate, and a pretty
marquee erected to the west of the course for the ac-
commodation of the judges and stewards. A crowd
of villagers and a dozen societypeople from the city
gathered about eleven o’clock and found everything
in readiness for the sport. There were the scales
for ' weighing the dogs, several ' kennels of
nervous fox terriers and a box of rabbits—-
those tender little animals which have furnished so
much sport and been the cause of no end of trouble.
Among those present were Miss May Bird on a
spirited sea] brown hunter; Mr. Egerton Winthrop,

Mr. Frederick Hoey, Mr. and Mrs. Van Rensselaer “

Kennedy, Mr. R.,W. Stewart, Mr. and Mrs. S. S.

 

= Sands, Mr. H. L. Herbert, Mr. R. D. Winthrop, Miss r.

Harriman. Mr. and Mrs. Mo "ewood. Mr. Percy Hoyt,
Mrs. Earl Dodge, Miss Sands and Miss Dodge in carts
and smart traps. ‘ .

OONFRONTED BY OFFICERS.

The gentlemen sportsmen who participated in the
fun were very few indeed, for it was said that most
of them had been frightened away by the last raid
of the “Cruelty” ofﬁcers and the rumor of trouble
expected. Mr. August Belmont, Jr., and Mr. Fred
Hoey were apparently the only gentlemen who were
.in charge, and when they arrived they were con.
fronted by no less, than thirteen ofﬁcers of Mr.
Bergh’s society in all the dignity of blue
coats, brass buttons and silver badges. They

looked for all the world like real city “oops,” but -

were not as ticlv. Young Mr. Belmont was not a.
whit surprised, because he had gone out on the same
train with the ofﬁcers and knew their errand. He
exhibited undaunted courage in Pl‘Oceeding with
his sport in the very face of_ the society’s men. and
if there is any gentleman in these parts who can l
give dignity and character to rabbit coursing it is he.
When the ofﬁcers and the sportsmen met there

 

nick word or two, the crowd gathered about

The handlers were permitted, however, to carry it;
out to the centre. of the course, where Mr. BelmOnt-g ,
groom, William Thompson, under instructions, at-
tempted to release a rabbit. In an instant two big .-
Olﬁcers pounced upon him and hustled" him off to ‘
the village. Was there any mild cuss words and

Then there was fun. Edward Kelly’s dog Reso—

Tiara tore around after that little bunny in the
liveliest fashion, and the crowd became exultantly
excited. Unfortunate Tiara ran against a small boy
and tripped him, while her competitor scored a go-
}35'. a turn, a trip and a wrench. The rabbit rushed

time, forty seconds.

That was without doubt one of the most exciting
scenes ever witnessed in Hempstead. While the
people were hopping like crazy folk and the ofﬁcers
were charging hither and thither, the kennelled dogs
set up a bowl, the horses pranced about, the ladies
oh’d a wee ibit, :and the old island farmers just
rolled on the ground and held their sides. The
transformation scene followed instantly, however,

; when the oﬁicers arrested Charles Bartel, Herbert

Gilligan and Germon Hopkins. ‘These prisoners.

’ with six oﬁicers and a large number of spectators,

l

formed a procession, which moved toward the
village. The Hempstead Coursing Club had made a'

' case, and the sport was broken up for the day.

l

The run for the Justice Cup, the other event on
the card, was necessarily omitted and everybody ad-
Journed to Justice B. Valentine Clowes’ ofﬁce. The
attempt to get two hundred excited people, two dogs
and-a dead rabbit into this little box was a failure,
and after Thompson’s examination had been set
for Monday, at haltspast four P. M., upon the charge

. of interfering With an oﬂicer inthe discharge of his

" with creditable distinction.

duty, a "recess" was taken, and almost everybody
went across to the hotel to get a “smile."
THE Pirsounns ARRAIGNED.

The afternoon sun had begun to wane when Jus-
tice Clowes opened court in the Town Hall. before
an immense audience. Superintendent Hankinson
sprung a surprise by having a complaint read against
Mr. Belmont for cruelty to animals. This gentleman
had not been arrested, but he pleaded “Not Guilty.”
Soon afterward he decided that he preferred to be
served with a warrant so that he might avail himself
of the privilege of suing for malicious prosecution.

His counsel was becoming rattled, and just at this

uncture _ ex-District Attorney “Ben” Downing

~-~ushed in'and shook hands with everybody. He had _

come in response to a telegram, and he joined the
counsel for the prisoners. '
The two captured dogs chawed each other in one
.orner, a village idiot shrieked in ' the rear and the
crowd laughed and ah’d until the Justice was com-
pelled to enforce silence with his silvery voice. Mr.
Belmont seemed to know a good deal of law himself,
and his neatly turned addresses to the Court showed
that he could have no doubt conducted his own case
After an hour or more
of legal expounding an examination was positively
refused to the prisoners, and they were held
for trial before the Court of Special Ses-
sions and a jury. Bartel and Hopkins will
be tried on Wednesday, at half-past three P. M.;
Gilligan on Friday, at four P. M., and Mr. Belmont
on December 19, at three o’clock. In the mean time
the ﬁrst complaint 'against the latter gentleman had
been withdrawn and an oﬁicer went through the
form of arresting him in genuine “cop" style. It;
was sport for the boys. Then everybody went to
supper.
continue to raid the rabbit courses, and Mr. Bel-

mont, unterrified, declared that he would have a
meet at Mineola on Monday, at two o’clock. Nobody

Mr. “Fred”:Hoey, and he is dreadfully put out be-
cause the oﬁicers did not arrest him.

MR. BELMONT’S VIEWS. .
COURSING IS A SPORT IN EVERY SENSE OF THE
WORD, HE SAYS.

I called upon Mr. Belmont last night to get his
views upon the action of Mr. Bergh’s society and he

expressed himself very frankly.
“Rabbit coursing,” he said, "comes under the
general head of coursing and is conducted under

terrier is the same as between the English bare

and the greyhound. The animal, theretore.
has every opportunity to escape, although

Just

getting his game—if he missed three times out of
four—~shooting would not be followed.

“Coursing is conducted on an open plain, without
any restrictions to the escape of the
animal. A portion of the plain is ﬂagged
three hundred yards by two hun-
dred yards—with ﬂags about thirty feet
apart, merely to prevent spectators coming in-
sideand possibly impeding the chancesof the rabo
bit’s escape or interfering with the coursing.

“The object of the coursing is .to test the Speed
and hunting powers of the fox terrier. The contest
is entirely between the dogs, the rabbit only
serving as a means of _ producing a race

Rabbit Batters. L

The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals is fulﬁlling its mission on Loni: .
Island, as elsewhere, and deserves credit
tier the way in which it is pursuing the
Linen who take unmanly pleasure in rabbi:
coursing. the professed object of which is
the improvement of the breed of little
dogs, while it is its real pur-
pose to afford excitement to the gild-
ed youth of the community upon whose
lily hands time hangs all too heavy. On
Saturday the society made further arrests
[of the so-called‘ sportsmen and their ser-
Livants,and_the issue between the society
ﬁnd the rabbit killers is likely soon to be
ttled. If the society can show to the
ction of a jury that rabbit «ours-
Tia-is a cruel sport, it will have
'7": way, and it the jury shall

MR. Rumours Burners NOT GUILTY.

THE TRIAL 0]!" WILLIAM THOMPSON AT HEMP-
STEAD. n. I., YESTERDAY. ;

The auditorIUm of the Hempsteed Town Hall was
the place selected by Justice Clowes yesterday to
continue the trial of William Thompson, on employs of
August Belmont, jr. Justice Clowes called the case at
3 o’clock yesterday. Counsellors B. W. Downing and
A: N. Weller sat to the left of Judge Clowes, looking
after the interests of Mr. Belmont, who set between
them. The prisoner set directly in the roar of. Mr.
Belmont.‘ Counsellor Elliott, who appeared for the

societY,, eat opposite Judge Clowes, and beside him

was sented Superintendent Hankinson. The society
agents who arrested Mr. Belmont. German Hopkins and
William Thompson were also in court as witnesses.
Counsellor Elliott, read the cmplsint charging the
prisoner with unlawfully interfering with an ofﬁcer
in the dischsrge of his duty, a. misdemeanor under

section 668 of the Penal Code.

‘ Superintendent Charles H. Hsnklnson. of the
American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, was the ﬁrst witness. He testiﬁed to being.r
present on Hempstoed Plains, on Saturday last. Mr.
Belmont came up to him and oﬁered- him a. card con-
tainifng the event of the day. A box was carried out

, in the ﬁeld with rabbits. “I then j asked Mr.. Bel-

mont,” continued the witness, “ if he proposed to have
the dogs chase the rabbit. He said he did so propose.”
The witness then gave the defendant. Thompson.
orderﬁ" to release a rabbit. Ofﬁcer ‘snowaon was in
charge of the box; Thompson pushed him away.
Surrogate A. N.‘ Weller asked if Mr. Belmont did

, not tell him that he was goingio course rabbits. The

witness admitted that Mr. Belmont gave him, a, pro-

. gramme of the coursing, but he did not read it. . Mr.

Weller read the bottom of theprogremmc, upon
which. was printed among the instructions . that any
ofﬁcer or agent must immediately kill a. rabbit, if not
dead after coursing, by striking it, on the back.
Counsellor Weller endeavored to ﬁnd out- from Mr.
Henln'nson if he would arrest a. party of men with
guns on their shoulders and dogs with them, if he
saw them on the street. Counsellor Elliott objected.
Mr. Downing said that it was nonsense to assume
that rabbit coursing Was cruelty, while gunners in
woods shoot them, wound them, and allow them in
their sufferings to escape.

Smowden, the {ofﬁcer twhom lthc defendant is
charged with interfering with, next. testiﬁed that he
was instructed by Superintendent Henkinson not to
let any rabbits be taken out of a. box that was car-

ried out in the ﬁeld. “I put? my foot on the box.” he '

said; “Thompson got 'hold of my leg and. tried to
upset me,” On cross-examination the witness said
he heard Mr. Belmont say that he would violate the
low, but didn’t see Mr. Belmont hand Superintendent
HenkinsOn a programme, nor did he see Mr. Belmont
read or point to any portion of a card.
Thompson, under-direction of_Mr. Belmont. undertook
to. remove his foot. ' He then placed Thompson under
arrest. He knew that One * rabbit was killed; and
saw the deed rabbit. ‘ ‘

Agent J. H. Gay, who was the next witness.
testiﬁed that he was present at the coursing meeting
on December 8, and heard Superintendent Hankinson
ask Mr. Belmont-if he was going to course and violate
the law. Mr. Belmont replied in the eﬁirmative.
A. crate .01 rabbits was ”then carried out in the ﬁeld
and again Superintendent Henkinsonv cautioned Mr.
Bellth as to violating the law... Agent George A.
Drew testiﬁed that he saw a rabbit chased and lulled
by the dogs. He secured the dead rabbit. and arrested
Charles Burtene, one of the men who hold' one” of the
dogs. F_ c. Clark, superintendent. of the Brooklyn
society, testiﬁed' that he heard Mr. Belmont ask
Superintendent Hankinson if the matterzcculd not be
“ ﬁxed.” Superintendent Hankinson , replied that it
could by being taken to court. where 9. fair test
“dilute made. Q
. ODunsellor Elliott here rested for the prosecution.
Mr. Weller opened for the defence, and said that they
would show that it was a case of trespaSs and not
ViOIetion Of the law. The ﬁrst Witness was German

he did not know a quicker method of killing a. rabbit

Some times, when the Judge was giving an
important decision, V be was interrupted by
friendly advice from a spectator. When Court
adjourned for tea, one of the jury and a bel-
ligerent spectator came near having a ﬁght. in
the court room. The spectator declared in a
positive manner that he could “knock the
light” out of the juryman, who replied with
courteous resentment that the spectator had
the "wrong pig by the ear.”

While the trial was going on, in the even-
ing, a personal quarrel between two spectators
about some trivial matter gave rise to a spir-
ited ﬁght in the rear of the court room. The
combatants were brushed out into the street.
But the court pursued the even tenor of its

way while the ﬁght was in progress. No one
was ﬁned for contempt and no arrests were

made.

“reinforced bis learned colleague with a. spirited '
argument that it was nonsense to assume that
rabbit coursing was (cruel. The rabbit either
died a sudden and painless death in one mln~
ute or else escaped. A gunner might
hunt a rabbit all day and subject
the animal to any amount of mental torture
and physical over-exertion. The S. P. C. A.
might. as well arrest amateur hunters and dogs
in the street, as to arrest those interested in
dogs who found diverson in rabbit coursing.
A-rabbit might be wounded by a hunter and.

bush. . -~ i

Captain Snowden testiﬁed that he had been *
instructed by Superintendent Hankinson not
to let the rabbits be taken out of the box. .

Oliicer J. H. Gay of the S. P. C. A.. said that;
he saw live boxes of dogs on the ground . and,
two dogs held by two men. I ,3

Ofﬁcer F. 0. Clark testiﬁed that one rabbit was" f,
killed on the course and one on the road“ " He
said he had one of the rabbits preserved. on,

three 'oﬂieers corroborated Superintendentf
Henkinson’s testimony. and agreed to the bowl
of their memory that Mr. Belmont had now.

At the night session of the court Counselbr:
Downing opened the case for the Belmontl
side, saying that the defense claimed theta
Captain Snowden was discharging no duties:-
but was simply a trespasser. If Mr. Belmont,”
Jr., had been intending to have a. chicken
ﬁght or a dog light, and had so announcemhe‘ .
might have been legally arrested, because»
coursing could only be a cruelty when the -
animal was cruelly slaughtered. It was nuts. ‘.

which makes it revolting to loversof fair play and manly

« ﬁeld sports. The Hempstead style of hare killing is most

certainly opposed to public sentiment, and ﬁnds no ap~

1 proval even among those who thoroughly believe in ﬁeld ‘
sports. This is because it violates the ﬁrst pr1nc1ple of

sport, inasmuch as it gives no “law” to the game. There
is absolutely no chance for the game to get away. its

time, but the killing itSelf is a thing of certainty. This is

. that part of it all which is out of harmony with the ac-

cepted ethics of ﬁeld sport. . ‘ .

If the victim had any chance for its life, if there were
even the remotest' possibility‘of its gettingaway, the
“sport” (save the mark) would lose much of its brutahty.
What decent man would go gunning after rabbits, if
attendants had been hired to go out in advance to tie
the bunnies to stakes so that they could not elude the

shoot pigeons from a trap, if the birds were tied
with a ' string so that they could not get away if

repeatedly missed? Any mode of killing game, Which
i ﬁrst puts that game into a condition of utter helplessness

and makes its destruction “adead sure things, Violates
the ﬁrst principles of legitimate sport, and no one with
any manliness or the least spark of instinct for fair play

' would demean himself by taking part in it.

The participants in this Long Island rabbit~killing _,
engage in it because they think it to be English, and .

‘ they feel they must ape English customs. It is yet to be

shown that such proceedings are countenanoed by any
decent classes of British sportsmen. Ratnbaiting and
cock-ﬁghtin g are also practiced in England, but they are

Rabbits.

There can be ' no reason for any further
, visi ts t o Hempstead by ofﬁcers of the cruelty
preventing society, for the purpose of arrest-
, ing gentlemen engaged in coursing rabbits.

Two juries have already considered. the
question whether such sport is cruel to the
point Of making those engaged in it liable
to punishment, and each time they have
decided that it is not. Further action by p
the society would be Slmple persecution.

If Mr- BELMONT should bring his dogs
int W estchester county, Where there are no
rabbits to speak of, and then import rabbit‘s
. to be coursed, the 3.111495 there might take
another view than is held in Queens. But .-
down on Long Island rabbits are thick and .

rniciousv and any means that assists in, ‘
, their destruction is apt to be looked on kind.

:i’ THE HEMPSTEAD RABBIT BUSINESS-

Editor Forest and Stream: _ _
There is something so farcical in the proceedings conneCted 5
with the prosecution of August Belmont, J r., his man Wil-
liam and others, on the charge of rabbit coursing, that the“
real merits of the question supposed to be at issue—the legiti- ‘
macy of coursing—is apt to be lost sight of in the ridicule}
with which both prosecutors and accused have covered them- ‘1:-
selves. Coursing is a sport of. vast antiquity, dating from i
as remote a period as the early settlement of the Aryan i
38013188 in Persia. The term is not generally applied to fox '
hunting, or to pursuing a hare on scent with barriers, the
pursuit by scent, whether of the stag, the fox or_ the hare,i
being spoken of as hunting, while the term coursmg is con-g
ﬁned to running with greyhounds or gaze hounds on sight.
The pastime of coursing deer and antelope is very popular L
among the Persian nobles to this day, and very considerable:

5 care is taken in maintaining their breed of greyhounds, the

best dogs of which are valued at a very high price. The-

, sport is scarcely less popular in England, where it is con-

ﬁned to hares. Small dogs are sometimes taken out with
the greyhounds to ﬁnd and start the hare, and sometimes

: the animals are turned out by men who have located their ;
‘ forms; in either case the greyhounds are held in leash until .

the hare has secured such a start that the powers of the dogs 1

-’ are taxed to their utmost efforts, and the results undecided
j until the hare be thrown into the. air or the dogs be called

off. The pleasure of the pursuit is found in the keenness

j and uncertainty of the contest; its legitimacy rests on the
. fact that it is an unobjectionable and natural method of
J securing possession of farce naturce.

In the ardor of the chase neither pursuer nor pursued

. pauses to think of consequences. In the pursued there is
, perhaps an undercurrent of trepidation when the pursuer is

close at hand, but until an animal begins to get exhausted
the mind is conbentrated on the exercise of the physical

5‘ powers, Or in contemplating a double to ,which it trusts its '
3 salvation, and when at length, doubling upon one pursuer, it-
1 runs straight into the jaws of another, is ﬂung up, is caught

and its back broke with a single shake, the catastrophe is so

. sudden, and the end achieved with so little sudering to the

pursued, that it may be fairly doubted if any other method

, of killing the hare is as merciful.

But what relation does coursing properly so called bear to

the rabbit baiting of August Belmont, Jr., and his confreres?

Coursing has been introduced into this country and prom-
ises to become very popular in California, where there are

; plenty of jack rabbits that will tax aggreyhound’s powers
‘ to the utmost, and an open country ﬁt for coursing; but
‘ catching cotton tails in traps/turning them loose in strange
" country so benumbed with fright that they sometimes refuse

to run, and then setting fox—terriers on them to worry them,

' is certainly a very reprehensible pursuit and may possibly

constitute an offense against the law; but in Heaven’s name
let FOREST AND STREAM and all true sportsmen repudiate

f all connection between legitimate coursing and the con-

 

 

pursuit? To come to a nearer parallel, who would,

temptible parody of it indulged in by the members of the .
so-called Hempstead Coursing Club, whose assum tion of
the style of sportsmen is only calculated to reﬂect iscredit

 

under the ban of the law and public sentiment; and it 3
1' would be a very poor excuse for the arrested participants
in a, Long Island rat-pit "meet”to plead that theﬁh‘nport” .

upon a pursuit worthy of kings and true men.

By the way, the coursmg club at Hemp— I

conﬂict with a pretty strong public opinion.

Mr. Peshall, of the Jersey City Athletic
Club, in a letter printed elsewhere, gives us
a very interesting anecdote, by Sir Walter ‘
Scott, on-the subject, and adds a word from
Mr. Vouatt, who tells of a famous race be-
tween a hare and a brace of greyhounds.
The run covered several miles, and when it
was over “both the dogs and the bare lay
dead within a. few yards of each other.”

Well, that shows the Hempstead club a
way out of their diﬁculty. We have in the
Far Wests. quadruped known as the jack rab-
bit, and if the object is to speed the dogs
and put them on their mettle, this jack rab-
bit can teach them a wrinkle they never
dreamed of.

He is an eccentric little rogue, but he can
get over the ground ahead of a telegraph
message. He is small, but, oh my, how he
can run l When chased by the ordinary cur
be fully appreciates the fun of the situation,
makes a mile or two in a minute or two, then
sits dewn on his haunches, fans himself with
his big ears and waits for the poor, panting
dog to come up. Then he goes along at a
jog trot, leisurely looking over his shoulder;
if he scents danger he hustles along like a.
cannon ball and is soon so far away that the
dog couldn’t see him with the Lick telescope._

Yes, the jack rabbit could teach those for
terriers how to stretch their legs and not
feel that he had taken any exercise. BY all

Rabbits and Jack Rabbits.

President PESHALL of the J ersev City Ken-
nel Club moralizes at some length Upon the
constructive cruelty of the Hempstead
Coursing Club.

He says that fox-terriers should not be
used to follow the small and diﬂ‘ldent rabbit
of Long Island. He contends that here
bunny has no chance whatever to go away
alive cut of the jaws of the dogs. In the
West, where the lordly and astute jack rab-
bit is used as quarry, the huntsmcn follow
the dogs on horses and sometimes have a
ten or ﬁfteen mile run before the game is
caught, while here the poor little creatures
are run down in less than a minute. . '

Let us consider this idea for a. moment. It
will be observed that the object is identical
both West and East. The game is to be
hunted down. But the jack rabbit being
ﬂeetcr and stronger can run further before
he is ﬁnally overtaken than the weaker puss
of Long Island. -

Assuming Brother l’ESHALL to be a good
sportsman, is it not likely that his strictures
have their unconscious root in the contem-
plation oi the poor sport afforded by a two-
mlnute chase as compared with the longer
hunting of the stronger animal? In short,
does he object to the cruelty of the Hemp-
stead Coursing Club, or to the unsatisfying
nature of its sport ? ‘

The rabbit seems to have the butt end of
the amusement in any event; but could he
be heard in the matter, would he prefer to be
run down quickly and be done with it, or to
run ﬁfteen miles and then be torn limb from
limb ?

If coursing is unjustiﬁable on Long Island,
is it altogether worthy as practised, accord- ,
in: to Mr. Pram in the West? '

personal spite than in the interest at true sport. .
At half-past eight o’clock the last juryman was ob-'
gained and Lawyer Elliott opened for the prosecn- ‘
ion. . l . ‘
The ﬁrst witness was Ofﬁcer E. F. Bernhardt. of, ;
He and Ofﬁcer William Gran-Hess;
titled to facts which have already been published.-

A "DA‘Isr" nxrnnr. . , 2 '

An, expert was next called. He was *Samuel'K.‘
Johnson, M. D., a veterinary surgeon of New York:
acting for the Board of Health and Bergh‘s society.
He said that he considered rabbit coursing cruelty. -
The rabbit had no chance for life. » It Was not sport. .

On cross-examination. Johnson said that he 'had'
never attended either rabbit or hare coursing. All ‘.
that "he knows about it he gained from reading
Goldsmith’s "Animated Nature,” "Stonehendge’s
Manual" and - ten other books. He had read up
especially for the trial. ,

,After‘the recess the witness said that in England
the here had a chance for his life. It frequentl .
happened that the bare and the hound were farm _.

E lying exhausted near each other, unable to move.

In the majority of cases the hares escaped. , .

Surrogate Weller opened the case for the defence;
He said that the witness Johnsonvknew positively
nothing about sports. The object of coursing was

to demonstrate the power and speed of the dogs. '

i Killing rabbits had nothing to do with it whatever. '

At half-past ten o'clock the case was adjourned
until next Thursday afternoon. , ‘

HOW RABBITS, ARE COURSED.
TWENTY-SEVEN corroNTAILs KILLED

’ ‘ T__________.._.—
Has Henry Bergh Given UP the Fight with ‘
. .August Belmont, JrJ—No Blue-coated
omcers ofhis Society Present Yesterday.
The Hempstead Coursing 011170 threw the
gauntlet to Mr. Bergh and the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals again YeSter‘ ,
clay. and the challenge was not acc‘epted- Mr.
iBergh’s ofﬁcers had just- left Hempstead on
Friday night after the trial of Hubert Gilligan!
an employee of the Hempstcad Coursins Club. ,
when August Belmont, J r.. decided" to have a .
course yesterday morning. Two juries have
decided that coursing is not cruel. and the
third case is still undecided in the .Hempstead
Court of Special Sessions. Havins fought the
"battle thus far on the defensive, Mr. Belmont
thought it would be politic and likewise good
sport to carry the campaign into the ‘
enemy’s country. It begins to look like a ‘
ﬁnish ﬁght. It was therefore a point scored bY
the Hempstead Coursins Club that they were ‘
permitted to course twenty-seven rabbits with
the wicked fox? terriers yesterday without in—
terference onlthe part of Mr. Be‘rgh and his
blue-coated ofﬁcers. The news that there
would be rabbit coursing was published in yes-
terday morning’s SUN. The groundsof the 3
Co‘ursingClub. between Hempstead andiGarden
City. presented a bright bit of color yesterday,
in contrast to the gray meadows that sur-
rounded them. A plot of 200 by 300 yards was
marked out by red. white, and blue flags. The
club’s brightly stripedlmarquee was erected at
one side with a deﬁant ﬂag ﬂying from its pole.
Within the tent were the scales and two crates
of rabbits. ,
The gamey fox terriers yelped anxiously in
their kennels outside the tent. The news of
the meet had been circulatedas thoroughly as
the limited time wouldfpermit, and among those
who were present were Mrs. S. S. Sands, Miss
May Bird. Mr. and Mrs. Palmer Moorwood. L.
Rutherford. August Belmont. Sn, 0. W. Bird.
Elliott Roosevelt. W. O. Inglis. A. M. Onder-
donk. and T. T. Buckmore The day was a
perfect one for Sport. There was very little
wind to puzzle the dogs, and the sky was
bright. The ofﬁcers yesterday were: J udge,’

amphitheatre an ancient custom. was revived.
After displaying remarkable horsemanship he
approached the shady side of the plaza, where
thejndge was sitting“, and, taking oil" his. hat,
respectfully asked him for the key to the torre,

where the bulls were conﬁned. The judge tossed
it to him, and after unlocking the door he re- .

iii-ed from the ring.

The bdgle then sounded the call for the bull
fighters, and as they riled into the arena with

judge, saying in effect. that the bulls that he
was to kill today were for him and his family.

Next he tackled the picador, Francisco Las-

breast-and throwing the steed and his rider to
the ground. The animal gored fatally three

Following him came Bonarillo,

est applause. He was then given ovcr‘to Man-
cho, who made two false strokes. In the third
he save the es-tocado, which caused the ani-
mal’sdeath. ‘

The second bull came into the ring with a
rush. He was a magniﬁcent animal. with open
horns and long neck. He charged Federico
Gochieoa’s horse. but the ‘ agile picador
poised his spine so as to throw the animal off.
He then encountered the plea-ad Garcia With
better luck, throwing the picador and his horse
against the fence. The crowd howled. expect-
ing every moment that the man would be fatally
gored. as he was underneath the horse. A man
on the sunny side shied his broadvbrimmcd hat
into the ring, and the bull’s attention.- was at-
tracted, savmg the picador’s life. The capes, in
their play, were most excellent. When the ball
was turned over to the matador he was still in
fair shape enough to make it lively. He made

18 basses at the III-lint“. and was killed by?

Mariano. ,.

The third bull came into the plaza verytamely;
Banderillas were applied. the bull bellowed
with rose as the ﬁre struck his skin, and he,

chased everybody in sight into the alleyway.‘.

Not satisﬁed, he went over the barrier into the

hustle to save a coring.
into the ring again he killed four horses. and

to be killed by dogs for sport. than to be shot for

food, and they have quoted again Maeaulay’s say-

ing that the Puritans suppressed bear-baiting, not
because it gave pain to the bear, but because it
yielded pleasure to the spectators.

The trial of "Slipper” Hubert Gilligan, an em-
ploye of August Belmont, Jr., was resumed in the
desolate looking court room at Hempstead,
In 1., late yesterday afternoon. Judge Valen—
tine Clowes presided and looked as sol«

cam and grave as on the previous trial,
that of Thompson, another emplové of Belmont,
who was acquitted. Counsellors B. W. Downing and
A. N. Weller appeared for the defendant, while
Counsellor Elliott was present for the prosecution.

’l‘he specific charge against Gilligan is made
by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals, who charged the defendant with
t-ruel'y in assisting at a meeting of the Hemp
stead (‘oursing Club on December 8, at
“hie-h rabbits were coursed and killed by for
terriors. Un December 14 it took over ﬁve hours to
secure a jury. after which the prosecution put in
their evidence. A. N. Weller in a brief address
opened the case. for the defence and was talking to
thej .ry until midnight on that date, when Judga
Liloxves adjourned further hearing until yesterday.

The trial was resumed with the defendant on the
stand. lle testiﬁed that he was the a~sistant of the
slipper a: the meeting held on the Hempstead plains

German Hopkins, who was arrested with the de-
fendant and Mr. Belmont on December 8, was put
on the stand as an expert. He tesriﬁed that a dog
will M11 a rabbit much quicker than a man can
and that the killing occupied about three seconds.
Wimess explained the mode of rabbit coursing and
said that the actual killing of the rabbit had little
to do with the decision of the course.

In resnmise to questions asked be Counsellor
wen”. “ﬁtness said the rabbit had a start of about
for“. yards before the ”slipper" let the dogs loose.
Never heard of a rabbit being mutilated beforelt

tion that if the rabbit gets away he is not injured.

during the course on Decemberb‘and killed it by
strilrlnu il behind the back of the neck. Mr. Lel-
inont tbld him to do if. 35 the rabbit was 110t dead.

’ ’Tis sad to use our tongue and pen
To censure now. our rich young men,
Who on Long Island do resort
To rabbits kill Ior'their own sport.

 

They let them out, dogs jump and run,
That to young gents seems real fun. .
The dogs in fury do them tear,

Their parts are scattered here and there.

They even bring their ladies, too.
With them this cruel sport .to view.
To sit and see these scenes of blood
May do them harm instead 01‘ good.

For proof go back to ancient Rome

Th’ Colosseum shows what on it come: .
To please th’ nobles men did slaughter,
Blood ﬂowing almost like water.

Read of. the bloodthirsty Nero-
His cruelty brought on them woe;
From one excess went to‘ another,
Even to killing his own mother.

80, ladies dear, beware! beware!

These trials yet you, too. may share.
' If you train children in that way,

They in return may mothers slay.

My old grandfather thus charged me:
“Don’t hurt a thing that does not thee.”
From some old writer, too, we learn

Not stamp our feet upon a worm.

That was good doctrine, then, to teach,

And appropriate now to preach,

To inﬂuence our rich young men

To not repeat the like again,

But for more nooler pleasures seek,

T 0 make them better, just and meek.

good purpose, which it does not. The

it. but the moment the law ofﬁcers lay

Resistance and deﬁance of law begets

R. BELMON'I"S arguments ought to be sufﬁcient to

convince any intelligent jury that the (rumor l‘..-.ti

the fox-terrier and the llempstt-ad Coursirzg Club i" -‘
when he created the rabbit. As Mr. Belmont says:

“The object of the coursing: i- to test the speed and lit-.52.;

powers of the fox-terrier. 'l‘he route-U. is entirely between thv .: g~,

' the rabbit only serving as a ll‘H‘Ill‘m’ of lift-(I'li‘li‘g a rare i». .1-

performances of the dogs have been during the chase.

If that does not satisfy the Society for the l’rcwi-rxtion «it
Cruelty to Animals, it is obvious that that organization is

{shallow enough to consider that it hurts a r:-..i.rit fusz as

much to be killed incidentally as otherwise.

NOTHER argument of Mr. lielmont's is unansweralﬂe.
V He shows that it is absolutely necessary, in (ifdt't' to

ascertain the qualities of the fox-terrier, to course him after

rabbits. He says—and who can deny it?——that owners r i
these dogs “should have the same right to find out wlpat
qualities their fox-terriers have as the owners of pointers (.r
‘ setters or collies.” Yes, indeed, or the sanze rigi: that (11;;-
ﬁghters have to ascertain the qualities of the hull-terrier;

that our ancestors had to prove the qualities of the bear by
i baiting him with dogs; or that our Spanish brethren have

,»

u-dV"

u

i to test the quality of the hull, with the odds agzizrst him.
lThe same divine right that the cat has to play with the
i mouse before dining upon it, or the small boy to pull (xii the
i“ legs of the grasshopper. The cat has no soul, you say. and

the boy is too young to know that the grasshOpper does not
enjoy mutilation? What has that to do with the question "

W

* * a:

R. BELMONT’S ﬁnal crusher is found in his argu-
ment that coursing is, in reality, a thoughtful pro-
" Vision for translating rabbits from a world of pain and
ﬁgsorrow in the easiest manner possible. \\'hat form of en-
,;.thanasia could be more delightful than this ? I’ll/u ltelmont :
a “If the rabbit outpaces the dogs he gets away from them wrv
if, Soon, and when he does get away he is entirely unhurt—not a scratrh
l 0n him .and perfectly free. If he is caught, the dog either kills him
very.qu1ck1y—as his back is very tender—or the attendants are im—
mediately at hand to kill him instantly by striking him on the bar 1;

THE PIGEONS WERE MANGLED.

Very Few Birds Killed Outright at. the
Babylon Shoot.

About seventy-ﬁve of the members of the West-
minster Kennel Club and their guests went down
to Babylom L. 1., yesterday morning to kill
pigeons or to applaud the shooting of them.
Over ﬁve hundred tame birds had been sent to
the club-house a few days previous for the
Slaughter, and a special train from Long Island

 

to the Babylon station. where they were met
by covered wagons which carried them to the

depot. _ _
, he shooting-ground was designated by col-
ored pennants, and four traps were'on the lawn
inrreadiness for the reception of birds. It was
11 o'clock when guns, cartridges and shooters
appeared to begin the slaughter. In the gun-room
were the prizes tobe contested for.‘ One was a
beautiful silver and gold meat-dish in the design
of an immense acorn. Another was a silver and
crystal Eng, anal gomelr a magnificent porce-

Next came Mr. .Gr. De Forest Grant, with
his gun and a smile. He had on an English
‘trayelling cap. and he wore a yellow and black.
striped jacket, With a monogram W. K. C. em-
brmdered in different colored silk. When the
trap was pulled the bird darted up and fell a
second later maimed in front of its trap. There
were hardly any birds killed outright. Most oi
them were maimed badly and were gasping for
breath when put into the hands of the employee,
who wrun their necks. 'Sometimes the birds
' ﬂew direct y towards their executioner as if for
rotection but a dose of ‘shot quickl laid them

The letters printed to-day bearing on the right and ' 1““
wrong of the killing hares by fox
stead Coursing Club fashion are i
aﬁord a very fair index to the feelings on the subject held
by the great body of American Sportsmen. As
said before, the question is not one of cruelty, but of
sportsmanship. The one fact that the victim has
chance for its life is what stamps
as unbecoming and unsportsmanlike. This fox
‘ ling of hares dropped to the ground is not coursing nor
can the advocates of legitimate coursing well permit their

sport to be injured by having it confounded with the
Hempstead way.

CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 2, 1889.-——Greyhound racing is

- one of the recognized sports in some parts of the.
West now, and a contest never fails to attract an ad- '
_ miring crowd. _While our suburban towns, have in-

dulged in the sport on many occasions the rst
coursing race ever held ‘in Chicago took place yester-
day. The smooth roadway forming the north limit
of Washington Park was lined with people to witness

the contest. They were not disappointed. The dogs
Were ranged in line 225 feet east of Smith's road
house. They were beauties, and a shout of admira-
tion went up from the people when at the word “Go”

the pack broke away and with heads down darted .

toward the goal. ,

Tom Broderick's Harry took the lead at once, with
Boot Jack a couple of yards in the rear. A, :02:
hound challenged the leaders for a. moment, but
quickly dropped behind and was soon 10515 in the
swift. moving pack. Harry‘still led. and the sports
were betting that he would prove the winner, when
trom the centre of the ﬂeet footed bunch a. clean
limbed hound fairly flew to the front. It was

SATURDAY, JANUARY 5,1889.

Henry Bergh Will Not Interfere.
. To-day the Westminster Kennel Club will hold ‘
its second pigeon shoot at Babylon, L. I. Many
of the resudents of the place are incensed at what .
they term the slaughter of the birds. They say l
the birds are not killed outright. but in mrmy 1

cases are only maimed. In numerous instalu't-s
at the last shoot 11?. was necessary to twistlllc
necks of birds which lay quiverim,y on the
ﬁeld. Their sufferings were not ended until the
dogs which were kept for that purposepickal
them up an broug t them to the atlendmt.
whose duty 1 was o_ﬁnish them. These ren-
. dents look to_ the Seeiety for the Pre'ventioxmf
Cruelty to Animals to stop the-practice. l'luvy
deem 1t more druel than rabblt-COHI'SIDL}, as a v

rabbit is killed much qmcker. . ,

would stop the shoot to-day. He said: “.\«i: I .

large ones. But I had some sport nevertheless and quite as
much exercise as I wanted. My own little gun caused the
death of only 102 in all of them,vand it required almost 175
shots to do it. That was far better than any of my compan-

, ions did. On two of the occasions my competitors killed

two or three birds more than I, but they burnt more powder.

’ The fact is I cannot walk as fast nor as long as some persons.

I am obliged to get over ground slowly and keep a sharp

j of life. Still he does his best and holds out as long as he
can. Poor old Argo! Well, he and I have had “lots of fun.”

Considered in the abstract, there can be no defense to the

killing of any wild animal without some useful purpose in
view, is simple cruelty, and a strict application of abstract
principles might properly class such “sporting” as brutal

' cruelty. Now we all know that this cannot be true in actual

practice, for we know many men of the kindest of hearts

. and the noblest of impulses who are devoted to such

cruel or brutal, yet they am, and always have been pre—

rest entirely With the rabbits. On the Western prairies it .
must be grand sport coursing hares in the 0 en, and it cer- .
tainly is excellent amusement in the East, s ooting rabbits ’

in the swamps and thickets but aperson who takes leas l

steadily diminishing in numbers, there is no such excuse ; ‘
for want on destruction. As for the cruelty of such a way i

‘ My attention having been called to the Hempstead mode

of killing rabbits, I wish simply to state, without any un— "

' due warmth in the matter, that while I have always advo-

cated the necessity of outdoor, manly sports, I must confess j-‘

1 that I never could see the sport in anything bordering on
, brutality. I should as soon advocate cockpits, bull ﬁghts.

Measured by the low standard of the Yankee fox hunter’s
ethics, the Hempstead method of coursing hares is murder- .r

ous and beneath the contempt of any on’e‘who calls himself ‘
a sportsman or even a decent man. But asait insures the '
3 certain death of the bare and pleases the dog‘sand, except-~ ,

ing the hare, the other participants, who no doubt are, true

sportsmen, it must probably be conceded that it i813}. very .

noble sport. Bull baiting and badger drawing were oncgso 5

considered, but we have fallen on better times, when such -
"‘ brutality is not tolerated.

Editor Forest and Stream:

 

The life of an animal is as clear to that animal as the life

of man is to man, and consequently man should not deprive

an animal of its life except in case of necessity, and when we
do take from an animal its life, surely we should not out of f
the pain, torture and death of the animal extort ‘or everr ,
attempt to extort pleasure. The act of taking the life of an ‘
animal for food is justiﬁed. The act of taking the life of air '
- animal for pleasure is simply concentrated cruelty. The
butcher, when he takes life, performs what he cons1de_rs an, _'
act of duty. The rabbit—baiter, when he takes the life of a
rabbits for the purpose of extracting pleasure for his morbid. ;
appetite, performs simply an act of cruelty. You pay your

money and take your choice. I prefer the butcher.

In the annual report of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, President Henry
Bergh dwells upon what he terms . the ,. " cruel and de-. ,
moralizing”sport of rabbit coursing. lately introduced
on Long Island. Though the patrons of the sport have
been acquitted by a local-jury. he says. they have not
been so successful before the bar of public opinion. and
he thinks they have begun to realize that “such acts
are regarded with contempt and abhoprence byrespect‘

The third 1s a pathetic representation of two sad-eyed,
rabbits trying to’get in somewhere out of the snow. It

was probably meant to‘touch the heart of Mr. Belmont.
' Mr. Bergh also makes an appeal against the practice
of clipping horses’tails, and tell: how it leaves the ani-

THE COURSING CLUB MATTER.

 

(From Our Eastern Correspondent.)

As the AMERICAN FIELD has iven a full account of the c -
testIof the Society for the Prevgention of Cruelty to Animals
against August Belmont, J 15., it may be as well to state the
outcome of the last of the legal battles between the parties
named. It took place, as did all the others, at the Town Hall
1n Hempstead, and before Judge Valentine Clowes. The
Society was represented by Colonel Elliot, while the cause
of the Coursing Club was championed by (ax-District Attor-
ney Ben Downing and Judge Weller. This was the third in
order of the legal battles; the two others having been decided
in favor of the Coursing Club.

_ Hubert Gilligan, one of the slippers of the fox terriers,
was the one whose case was this time before the Justice. It
will be remembered this was the second trial of those who
were arrested by the olﬁcers of the long named Society, on

December 8,1 Gilligan was sworn as the ﬁrst witness and , tice the queer fact. Seeing the D68,

stated the history of his arrest, as has been given in the
AMERICAN FIELD.

German Hopkins was then put on the stand and gave his
opinions as an expert. He contended that there was no
cruelty In coursmg hares with fox terriers—“How could
there be when many of the runs were over in less than ﬁve
seconds?” . —

This evidence was supplemented by that of ,Fred Hoe
William Akley and W. C. Bryant. By the evidence give};
to the jury, it was fully established that, while ihemajority
of the hares were run into and killed, there was absolutely 1
no cruelty—there was no tearing, no mangling, no smashing ’
of bones. It was a. snap and. a death immediately. After
four hours of evidence, cross—examinations and pleading,
the counsel summed up for either side, and the case was ,
given to the Jury at ﬁve minutes past ten. In less than an
hour they came in and rendered a. verdict of not guilty. A
very large number of persons remained in the court room
throughout the proceedings and until the verdict was
brought in. The decision was received with cheers which
the ofﬁcers could not check for some moments. The in- ,
terest taken in these cases has been great, and the whole
drift of public sentiment outside of a few, who know
nothing of, and are opposed to ﬁeld sports of all kinds, has
been in favor of the Cour-sing Club. The action of the
Society in making arrest after arrest, smacked so much
of persecution, so much of interference with the
liberty of the individual, that the feeling of many ,
who at ﬁrst were inclined to be against coursing, i
has veered to the other side. The writer has heard
but little against Mr. Belmont, but a great deal as to
his plucky action in ﬁghting the affair through the courts,
when it has been the cause of loss of time and an expendi-
ture of money to all engaged in the defense.

Mr. Belmont’s own case, as well as that of Charles Bar-
tello and German Hopkins, has been removed from the
Special Sessions to the Court of Sessions. This was done
on application of the Coursing Club’s counsel, B. Down-
ing, Esq., who, for Mr. Belmont, wished a ﬁnal settlement
of the question as to whether it is cruel to kill hares by
running with fox terriers. This necessitates, on the part of
the S. P. C. to A., a. bringing of its evidence before the
Grand Jury of Queen’s County. It being understood that if
again beaten, the Society will allow the meetings of the
Coursing Club to go on without interference.

What the P. C. A. Society Did in Brooklyn‘
Last Year. -

The twenty-third annual report of the Ameri—
can Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals has just been issued, embracing the 1
your 1858. According to the facts and ﬁgures"

as presented, the organization is in admirable l
condition and doing effective work in thirty-
gcven States and Territories of the
Union, which have given legal recog-
nition to the doctrines of the society,
and have constituted gheir violation a.
crime. It has certainly taught men to avoid the
lash, to pursue the line of kindness toward the
brute creation and Where conscience has not
been reached a healthy tear of the law has in.—*

former hardships. That excesses of jurisdic-
tion have taken place on the past
of the officers of the association in‘
carrying out the governing principles
and that thero'is a. stretch ofgpower occasionally
canpot be denied, and it has sometimes created
ridicule which casts a reﬂection upon the more
noble and honorable purposes for which the origi_
nal body was organized, and the course it pur-
sued in its earlier years. An instance of their
over zealousness occurs in the attempt to
cstop rabbit coursing on Hempstead Plains,
under the auspices of a legal society,
and which has been editorially neticed in THE
CITIZEN. In general, however, the main ob-
jects of the society have the hearty and earnest
sympathy of the communities where the society
exists and have ofﬁcials, and th0 latter always .
iind ready and helping hand; _“rom regular l
otﬁcers and citizens whenever (called upon for .
assistance in emergent oases. ' _ ' :

The Brooklyn Agency receives a special notice 5
in the broad renew which covers the whole a
United States and is subioined:

"The eiiicicncy of the Brooklyn Agency has
been materially increased through the appoint—
ment of several additional ofﬁcers to operate in
that vicinity. ,

“A telephone has also lately been placed in
that otiice, and direct communication with their .
headquarters established; By this means, also, .
the otlicers. while out on patrol duty, receive
their instructions, and all messages from the
Police Department are more promptly trans- .
mittcd. . ,

“l‘hc followmg record of work performed by
the oiiicers attached to that agency, under the ~
direction of Superintendent Clark, indicates
that the increased expenditure oi money in that .
direction has been productive of adequate re~
cults. '

The Brooklyn Branch of the American 8ociety
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals is about, ‘
to issue its annual report. In the report will be!
found many facts of interest in connection with“,
the society's history for the past year. “Babbitfrgﬁ;
Coursing in America” forms one-of the important-é
subjects discussed by President Bergh in hisad?‘
dress to the society. It is as follows: '. ' _

: Others worked for men alone—a. single purpose—

cause, the treasurer’s report is an excellent ex-
cellent exhibit. He reports; that, exclusive of
the cash on deposit at. the Union Trust Com-

amount of $78.880.08, leaving a. cash balance at
the Opening of the present year of $50,738.73. -
Mr. Charles Laurer. the treasurer, states that
this handsome surplus is principally due to the
receipt cf the monies donated from estates,

mont extending over some time. It is greatly
to the honor of the society that the treasurer
states “In the management of the society’s
nuances the policy of incurring no obligations
in excess of the incomes still prevails. and in
Its constantly increasing: eﬂiciency the advan-
tages of such a course are apparent.” ‘ .

W Now; we think few people will apply the
1 epithet of “ delicate-nerved noodle” to ourself.
We rather fancy we have proved, 111 more
instances than one, that we are made of vastly
different stuff. We have, oft and oft, in the
pursuit of sport, carried our life in our
hand, so to speak, for, no one will deny that
a “ delicate—nerved noodle” would hardly
be the sort of person to trust his tender self in
a thin—planked punt, on the deep sea, in the
dead of the night, with not a soul for many
miles to render help were help ever needed.

Mind you, we think nothing of it, so do not
fear, we are not going to “crow.” We merely
state well-known facts in order to enable us the
better to carry conviction into the souls of our
readers.

W e will, therefore, take it for granted that
we are not a “ delicate-nerved noodle.” This
being so, we are entitled, to refute “ N omad’s ”
arguments all the more authoritatively, and we
confess that (l) we can see no sport in coursing
bagged rabbits, and (2) that it is cruel to course
rabbits which have been caught, hept imprisoned
in baskets and then released on ground of which
they do not know a single yard.

It is not cruel to course bolted rabbits,
because they are on their ground and know per
fectly well what to do to escape if it can be
done. They are thenferce naturre, and on their
own habitat, two absolute conditions for sport.

We read last week a strange argument in a
sporting paper wherein it was alleged that it
was wrong in sportsmen to attach any hind of
sport, because all sports were linked to-
gether. At ﬁrst sight this seems reasonable
enough: Attacking a sport would be decidedly
wrong in any sportsman, but in this case the
argument does not hold water. Heaven forbid
that we should attack sport, but coursing bagged
rabbits is not, never has been, and never will be
sport. It is a heartless pastime, ﬁt Only, for shop
boys who know no better, and whose idea of fun.
is to see rabbits killed by terriers. That is all.

As to “Nomad” thinking that the “noblest
and best of men ” in England patronise that
kind of thing he is wofully mistaken. No true-
minded sportsnmn catches animals to worry them,
either here or in any other country, and we
shall lend all the help in our power to put
down such a cruel, bastard kind of entertain-
ment.

Mr. Belmont, doubtless, meant well, but now
his eyes ought to be opened, and he should
cease to countenance rabbit worrying. There
are far nobler ﬁelds of action open to him,
wherein to spend his energies, and to which he
can lend the prestige of his name and of his

 

 

HE LATEST ABOUT THE TERRIER
COURSING CASE IN AMERICA.

The following gives the latest" news :—

Hubert Gilligan, one of the slippers of the fox-
terriers, was the one whose case was this time before
the justices. This was the second trial of those who
were arrested by the ofﬁcers of the society on Decem-
ber 8th. Gilligan was sworn as the ﬁrst witness, and
stated the history of his arrest. ‘ '

German Hopkins was then put on the stand and
gave his opinion as an expert. He contended that,
there was no cruelty 1n coursing rabbits with fox-
terriers—“ How could there be when many of the runs
were over in less than ﬁve seconds .9 ”

This. evidence was supplemented by that of Fred
Hoey, William Akley_ and W. C. Bryant. By the
evidence given to the'Jury, It was fully establiShed
that, while the majorlty oi the rabbits were run into
and killed, there was absolutely no cruelty—‘thére‘
was no tearing, no iiiangllllg, no smashing of bones.
It was a snap and a death immediately. After four
hours of evidence, cross-examinations, and pleading.
the counsel summed up for either side, and the cal;
was given, to the jury at ﬁve minutes past 10. I In
less than an hour they came 1n and rendered a verdict
of not guilty. . ‘

“We regret to note that a cruel sport, so-called, i

chickens, with shot, the winner being the man who
ﬁnally knocks over the wretched bird, is barbarous,
indecent, nmanly, unSportsmanlike and utterly :
indefensible. “ If the ﬁrst shot either killed the bird
or left it unscathed there might be little verge for
stricthres, but in practice, shot after shot is had, each
one mutilating the chicken more or less, until
perhaps a half dozen or more cartridges have been
emptied, when the bird falls, cut and bleeding. The
shameful butchery lacks all elements which make
sport, and should be stamped out at once, even if
sportsmen have to enlist the services of the ofﬁcers of

Some Doubt Expressed as to Its Real Value
' When Alive.

"HE HAD A FINE, OPEN COUNTENANCE."

A Witness Testiﬁes that It W’as a. Pretty
Good Five-Dollar Horse—An
Shoots the Animal and Places Its Owner
in Jail—Damages Asked from the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

When Judge Cullen adjourned Part I. of the
Supreme Court at 5 o’clock yesterday afternoon
he left a jury of twelve men deliberating over a
verdict in a suit tried before them during the
day wherein Thomas Verlein had sued the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Ani-
mals for $10, 000 damages for malicious prose-
cution and shooting a Sick horse. The result of
the deliberations of the jury will be deﬁnitely

 

.made known when the court convenes at 10
? o’clock this morning.

Had the testimony in the
case been less conﬂicting they might not have
had so much difficulty in arriving at a conclu-
sion. The witnesses for the plaintiff contra-
dicted those for the defendant on, almost every
essential point in controversy, and the witnesses
for the defendant followed suit regarding the
testimony of the witnesses for the plaintiff.
According to the story told by the plaintiff

for Herman Clark. the contractor, and wanted
a. horse to work in a dirt-cart.

knowledged expert in horseﬂesh, to buy him a
horse in the market. He had $30 to invest in
such an animal as he thought would answer his
purpose, and he gave that money to Rooney.

 

: and ha

 

Together they went to a market for cheap

; horses, but Mr. Rooney could not ﬁnd an ani-
. mal to suit for the price, and they went to a

number of other places. Finally Rooney bought
a horse and Verlein took it home and began to
work it. The animal was young and large and
had rubbed the skin off its hip bones in the
stable. There was also a small swelling on one
(if its knees. After four days'work. the horse
was taken sick and Verlein put him in the care
of Alonzo Stillwell, a skilful repairer of dam-
aged horseﬂesh, to be doctored. Stillwell placed
the horse in a vacant lot, where there was a shed,
and Verlein said he not only fed and watered the
animal three times a day himself, but got medi‘.
cine andl‘liniment from Stillwell to doctor him
with, and that he took the best of care of him.
The ﬁrst thing Verlein knew, some person

‘ made a complaint to the ofﬁcers of the Society 1
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals that a

sick and disabled horse had been abandoned to

die in a vacant lot on Bolivar street. between .

Raymond and Navy streets, and Ofﬁcer Glover
was sent there to make an investigation. He
found the horse there. and, in spite of the ex-
pOStulatiOns of Mr. Stillwell, he shot him.
When Verlein heard of this he was angry, and

’Went to the ofﬁce of the Society and demanded

an explanation. Instead of getting any satig-

faction for the destruction of his property, he
was threatened with arrest and told to go about
his business. He then began an action a must
the Society to recover the value of the orse,
whereu on Ofﬁcer Glover swore out a warrant

ing, in a vacant lot, a livmg. maimed, inﬁrm

fered from Mr. Verlein on a .great many essen-

The de 'ense claimed that they acted in good
faith, and that they had reason to believe the
horse was sick and that he had been abandoned.

the animal in, and denied that Stillwell made
any protest against his action in shooting the
animal.
there had been a ‘ ‘ h . .

This statement Mr. Stillwell denied in rebut-

Of 1884-5, but as nothing practical,E

could be accomplished without a law, .
the societ)’; lapsed into desuetude until

bosoms. 3

We have not at hand suitable sta-
tistics of what the humane societies in.
this country have accomplished, but,
the work has been very great. Men
who owned horses which they were
forced to entrust to rough drivers
speedily found it very gratifying tliati
their stock could not be abused when
out of sight. Angry drivers soon
learned that tliey'could not vent them-l
selves upon the teams they drove and!

 

the really enormous number of arrests;

made of drivers testiﬁed to the neces-i
sity that existed of teaching them a
lesson in their business.

The buyers of meat were placed ung
der obligation. The writer in years
past, has seen sights in the cattle cars

 

kept for days without food or water,
tramping over fallen and dying com-
panions, to be taken from the car at

. last and butchered for men’s and child-
iren’s food, were incidents of every-
ZClay occurrence tillHenry Bergh broke};

in upon the evil and put a stop to it.

Cattle, whose owners supposed tobe
cropping the new grass and drinking

MR. BERGH’S soornrr WILL rnosncnrn
nnwm n. MORQAN.

Henry Bergh, President of the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, said last
evening that measures are to be taken at once
to secure evidence in regard to the alleged dock-
ing of the tails of horses belonging to Edwin D.
Morgan, the banker. A meeting of the Executive
A Committee of Mr. Bergh’s society was held
yesterday afternoon, at which the cruelty said
to have been practiced on Mr. Morgan’s 30
horses at Hempetead, Long Island, was con«
sidered. The matter was finally referred to Mr.
Bergh and the counsel or the society to inves-
tigate, to take such action as the occasion might
require, and to report to the next regular meet-
ing or the committee on March 13. .1 '

When asised it he had already procured any
evidence in regard to the alleged deed Mr.
Bergh said: “Edy Knowledge was at ﬁrst gained
through. the press, but a gentleman has since
teld me that Mr. Morgan admitted tohiin that
the docking had taken place. it" this is so I
think there is” no doubt but that we can hold
him accountable, for ,the law provides
that any person .WllO directs or orders
the needless . mutilation or humming of animals
shall be sumect to a penalty of one year’s im-
prisoment and a tine of $250, in the discretion ‘ ‘
or the court. Three conVictions have been ob-
tained under the law in Massachusetts in a like
ease and the penalties imposed.

“ Some people have said that the wound oc-
casioued by docking is very slight, and that
very little pain is caused to the animal. This is
not at all true. The operation in the ﬁrst

sion of the vertebral column and gives ,
a severe shock or pain to the animal. i

I am told by Dr. Johnson, our Veterinary
eurgeon.that this shock is so great as in some
instances to have actually caused the death or
the horse. Then, as if the pain were not
enough in itself, there is the added cruelty or

the attacks or the horse ﬂy. whose bite’is in-

Edwin D. Morgan, thegoung millionaire

him to task for docking 'the tails of thirty
horses, which he has on his stock farm near ,

Each horse in turn {lien had his tail chopped
short off, and a. red-hot iron applied as a
cautery (o the bleeding stump. Their
wounds have not yet healed, and meanwhile
all visitors are excluded from the grounds.

Mr. Henry Bergh has signiﬁed his intention
of taking action against Mr. Morgan on the

ground that the mutilation of the horses was
unwarranted and in Violation of theﬂaw.
“Horses With docked tails are very com-
mon on the streets, ” Said an EVENING WORLD
reporter to Mr. Bergh this morning. “ but
no instance is on record of owners having
been prosecuted. Why, then, should Mr.
Morﬁan be liable any more than others ?”

 

for to obtain any eVidence against the perpe-
trators, ” answered Mr. Bergh.

“ The veterinary surgeons are well aware
that such an act is a misdemeanor, and there-
fore the docking is done under the strictest
secrecy, behind closed and barred doors.

' I know that docked-tailed horses are be-
coming more and more numerous, but that
does not Justify Mr. Morgan’s action any
more than a repetition of robberies would

excuse a burglar who happened to- be caught
in the act.

 

 

“ There are laws to protect beasts as well
men, and the amputation of horses’ tails is
Just as much of an offense as if it were their

V PERHAPS THAT WAS BANKER MORGAN’S REASON
FOR “DOCKING” THEIR TAILS.

‘ A case to interest the drivers of tandems and
4 other vehicles in which-it is the fashion to have
bobteiled horsés is that of Edwin D. Morgan,
the young banker, who, it is claimed, caused the
tails of several of his horses to be docked recently

at Hempstead, L. I. The matter was brought to
Henry Bergh’s attention, and yesterday he laid the
case before the following gentlemen of his society :—
Ex-Judgc Horace Russell, Elbridge 1‘. Gerry, James
M. Brown, John P. Heinee, James Grant Wilson,
’ Alfred Wagstaff and \. M. Beekwith. As most of the
gentlemen had probably been behind a short tailed
‘ horse at one time or another and were rather non-

Mr. Bergh is determined to make the young
: hunting set of Hcmpstead realize that the blood
of ” his pa” is warm and flowing in his veins.
Only a month ago he had Mr. August Belmont, .
. in, Mr. F. 0. Bcach and others of the Hemp-_
‘ stead contingent arrested for cruelty to rabbits,
and now he is making it unpleasant for Mr. Ed-
win D. Morgan, the grandson of the late Gov,
Morgan. Mr. Morgan is the possessor of horses,
and each and every one of these horses is the pos.
sensor of an abbrev1ated tail haying been subsect-
ed to the treatment called, ‘ docking. " Mr. Bergh
says that 1t is cruel to ‘ ‘ dock” a horse’s tall.
' It cannot be questioned for a moment that a,
horse m haying his tail cut short 1s subjected to
pain: non, the . question 18. 1s 1t cruel to make a,
horse sulfa-r 53am 7 I think I am correct In stat-

horse. 1t- has been found by repeated experiences,
soon recovers and is 1n no way impaired. and, as
every one knows who has lived in the country.
certain operations are ert’ormed upon other .
animals which are equal y painful. but no queas-
tion of cruelty has ever arisen. r. Morgan’s
horses are exceedingly valuable. and it is not
likely that he woul‘l d9 anything calculated t0
. injure them in health, in temper or in value.

* i ‘3!

. The hunting set of Hemnstead declare that-
, Mr. Bergh is actuated by two motives—one to '
‘. annoy them and the other to make for his Society ‘
an advertisement. This seems hardly possible;

‘ but as the fashion or practice of “ docking ” is

7, not new—indeed, as it has been in vogue for sev- '
oral years, I do not understand why Mr, Berg-'13 .
has picked out Mr. Morgan’s stable at this time.
Now that Mr. Bert/.11 has interfered horsemen ~
. declare they would like to see him push the mat- ~

E inhumane to “‘ dock ” a. horse’s tail. .

AN ABSURD AND CRUEL FASHION.
The president of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Mr.
Henry Bergh, nephew of the founder of
that noble association, says, in his an-
nual report anent the fashion of dock--
ing : , . ,5
“We are pained to observe how general- .
‘ly that patient servant of the human race
——the horscwis subjected to mutilation
and suffering merely to comply with the f
dictates of a wicked and senseless custom.
When their owners authorize the removal
’of the only protection against insects f,
With which nature has proyided them, .
do they realize the amount of pain their é’
act occasions ? Do they know theta—1m—
like the houseﬂy—«the insect that'perse
_ cutes the horse is provided with fangs
1 which penetrate the skin and occasion
untold suffering? That this is the case,
the blood which drequen‘tly ﬂows from
‘ the wound, as Well as the efforts of the
animal to dislodge them, plainly indi-
cates. The inﬂiction is almost inte'
'yminable, and the animal. is" almost po
56rless to prevent it.” , -
. In the lastjbentence, Mr. Bergh m

HARE CHASING.

d

English Grayhounds to Course
on Long Island. °

..———-

Brooklyn Sportsmen Who Want Something
More Exciting Than the Pursuit of the
Insigniﬁcant Jack Rabbit.

The English sport of bare coursing is to be in-
troduced on Long Island. A number of Brooklyn
young men of means have formed themselves in-
to the Eastern Coursing Club. Hare coursing is
not like the rabbit baiting indulged in by Mr.
Belmont and the Hempstead Coursmg Club. It is
not so cruel a sport. The rabbit has no chance of
escape, whereas a hare often outruns the swiftest
greyhound and saves its life. Among those who
are in the Eastern Coursing Club are Lawyer J.
Herbert Watson, of 16 Court street. and W. B.
Growthage, son of the architect. A constitution
is being drawn up on the basis of that of the
American Coursing Club, of Great Bend, REAL,
the only other club of the kind in this country.
The organization will be perfected at a meeting
to be held to-morrow. Extensive grounds are to
be inclosed on Long Island. but whether on the
North Side, the South Side or in the middle‘coun-
try has not yet been determined. The ground
selected will be as nearly ﬂat as possible. The
Brooklyn sportsmen propose to course German
haresbr Western American jack rabbits, just as
do the English bloods of the National Coursing
Club on the plains of Altcar, on Lord Seften’s
estate, outside of Liverpool. The best- gray-
hounds only will be used. Mr. Belmont’s folks
use little fox hounds and cotton tail rabbits that
can’t run for a little bit. A hare or a. jack rabbit
can jump twenty-one feet at a time and run like a
streak of lightning, and turn and twist and. play
all sorts of tricks on a greyhound, which has no
instinct for scent and depends altogether
on its powers of vision. Hare coursing 18
described as being not so cruel as rabbit
baiting for two reasons—ﬁrst, because 20
per cent. of the hares escape altogether.
and, second, because the greyhound kills
the hare instantly by biting through its back
bone. The young gentlemen who compose the
Eastern Coursing Club are friendly to the Hemp-
stead Club and do not look upon rabbit baiting as
cruel. The former club will enclose a large area in
wnich the hares or jack rabbits are to be turned
loose, and not let out} ‘ of a box as in. the
case of rabbits. It is, usual to give the hare
100 to 150 yards start on the dog. Two
gTeYhounds are slipped, after each bare, the
WOW“ Object of hare ,epursers being not to kill
the hares but to train the greyhounds. Thus, the
0.115133 aJflﬁel‘ the hares is called merely a. compe-
tition between the hounds, and the latter are

"J’Henfy Bergh has been ”forced, to resign“ the)
l presidency of the Society for the‘ Prevention, of '
Cruelty to Animals, which was founded by his
uncle twenty-three years ago. His successor in:
l the ofﬁCe is James M. Brown, of Brown Brothers
#85 Co., bankers. The change was made on Mon-i
; day at an executive session of the Board of Man-4

 

 

 

 

lingers, thirteen members being present—Elbridge'T-i

4, Lanier, James M. Brown. Parke GOd‘Vlnv George
r G: Haven, Horace Russell, Edward A. Hammond.
James Grant Wilson and George G. De \Vitt, jr.
"Mr. Bergh’s resignation was accepted unanimously”.
Mr. "Brown was elected without a dissenting vote
and the lucky or unlucky thirteen, after P3581115
a cw resolutions and adepting a new bY-MWB
Zelioek~handsiand~went their several ways, agre eing
. One with another to keep perfectly quiet about?
‘ the whole business. 7 -
i. , [L’Thep’ new by—law was the lever with whichl
Mr. ‘Bergh was ousted; and the fulcrum under
, this lever was Superintendent Charles H. Hankin-r
son. » Physically, Mr. Bergh is a small man, a)
cabinet-size photograph of his uncle, as it were}
and, moreover, he is young: having, as a member
of the Board of Managers remarked, much tel
rilearn. But the same by-laws which made the
.Lf'oun’der of the society an autocrat made his
v'nephew a dictator, and the latter used his power
in a, way that caused the Board of Managers
‘ “to” believe that he abused it. This Board is com-2
posed of twenty—three men in the prime of life—i
the ten vice-presidents of the society and the
5‘, "thirteen members of the executive committee—4
and it has been galling to them to be dominated!
by so young a man as Henry Bergh. ' i
. ~ Trouble jwas brewing for several months. The
youthful president, weak in himself, but strong
under the constitution and by—laws": seldom did!
the members of the. Board the honor to consult
them in regard to the ‘management of affairs,
‘ and this seeming neglect, ,which began by breeds
l;§.§§i&g:+1is$atisfacrinn-andﬂisgontent; ended by giving
f“i“vo;ﬁence. “ This young man is too domineering,”I
' agreed the Board. “He must be taken down a
peg or. two; his power must be lessened. We
shall change the by-laws so that they will give

. , us some control. ,We should like to be consulted.
~ ,We are Willing to be ruled by the founder of the
’IS. . A., but as for being run over by the
cw, that is a different matter.” a

_. 1e this discontent was being well digested"ﬂ

. esrdent Bergh, oblivious of the impending},

; .urrlcane, discharged Superintendent Hankinson,
a-s'hel thought, for cause. The Board of Managers
was not consulted; it was informed, however, in
the course of ordinary business that Ilankinson‘

had gone. This action was taken about three”

_ weeks ago, and 1t settled affairs as quickly as ani

-,e g settles colfee. Such pressure was put on Mfr:
, \rgh that be reinstated Hankinson, and the

‘ superintendent is again in his accustomed placed.

HORSES AND iiULEs AT ROLL CALI:

 

OFFICERS OF THE S P. C. A. INSPECT AND BE-
. LIEVE SUFFERING HARLEM TOILEBS.

An oﬁicial inspection of the condition of the
horses and mules used by the Italian colonies in the
employ of the contractors now engaged in build-
ing and sinking the tracks of the Harlem Railroad
between the river and ll'illiamsbridge was made
yesterday by the ofﬁcers of the Society for the Pre-
vention of Cruelty to Animals.

The descent of the ofﬁcers upon the sons of sunny
Italy created some consternation. Many of them,
no doubt, feared they were wanted for having sti-
lettoed or kidnapped, for ransom some American
nobleman while “doing" the mountains and ruins
of the land of song and romance. Many of the ani~
mals at work were in much better physical con-
dition than were the drivers. One horse, however.

was found having a bad wound on the right fore 4

leg from which the blood was streaming. The cut
.was stitched up and. bandaged, for which the poor
creature appeared quite grateful.

Several other horses and mules were suspended
from labor by reason of inﬁrmity and other debili-
fies. Before leaving the neighborhood the ofﬁcers
were importuned to give surgical assistance to sev-
eral men who had been injured while at work, and-
at one time the scene reminded an old soldier who
was looking on of a ﬁeld hospital.

During the past week the society’s ofﬁcers have
arrested ﬁve men for abusing their ainmals, eighteen
horses have been suspended from labor for lame-
ness and other inﬁrmities, twenty-two horses,
mules and other large animals have been humanely
destroyed, being diseased or injured past recovery;
ﬁfteen domestic animals have been properly dis-
posed. of at the request of their owners, twenty com» 1

plaints‘frOm citizens have been investigated and
four disabled horses have been removed from the
streets in the society‘s ambulances. ”

The Dogs Knew What to Bite. l

BRIDGEPORT, March 26.——A dog ﬁght in Strat-
ford Sunday night opened vigorously and the sports ‘
present anticipated a. successful affair, when suddenly
one of the dogs, handled by Dennis Kelley of West Strat-
ford, turned and fastened his teeth in Kelley’s leg, tear-
ing the ﬂesh in a. frightful manner. The other dog, as if

‘ in s m athy, turned and attacked his handler. but be.
foreyit Bould do any injury 11) was grasped by the neck
and choked off. Both handlers refused to go on With the _
ﬁght and the battle was declared a. draw. Kelley was
badly frightened and cried like a child. He was taken
to the West Strutford horse car stables, and while there
he bade his cousin, an employee, a good-by, saying that,
he expected to die of hydrophobia. Dr. rapping was
summoned, and Kelley resisted any attempt to cauterize
his wounds. At last e was thrown on to thenﬂoor, his

IS rlnrm 'oAsn AND PARTLY AFB AN EXEC-
~ ' ’ UTOIR—LE‘GATEMS DISCRETION.

Jane E. Kelemen, who died on the 19th inst, had
executed a will and two codicils. The documents ,
Were ﬁled for probate in the ofﬁce of the Surrogate .
yesterday. The will was executed on February 18., .
whengthe testatrix was sick. . l

By it she leaves her jewelry and diamonds to rela- l
tives and friends. and also -makes bequests of 3 ~
:money to these persons.“ She then gives to the New
York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Chil—

 

" drenkftﬁﬁoo; to the American Society for the Pre- V
: vention of Cruelty to Animals. $5,000, and a Slmﬂar 3
amount to the Methodist Episcopal Church Home,

institution, and Townsend Wandell is made ex-
ecutor. ' ‘ ' ‘

One codicil was executed on February ‘22 and the
other two days later. The ﬁrst codicil states that,
as doubts were expressed regarding the validity of
the bequests for charitable purposes. the will is
modiﬁed so as to make her friend Townsend Wan-
dell residuary legatee, and requests, him to carry
into effect her wishes. This is not an absolute di-
rection,but merely a desire. The second codicﬂ
makes a few bequests to relatives-

The Larchmont Yacht Club have found
out that their powers and capabilities are
‘ not to be limited to navigating the raging
and trackless Sound, and they have re-
cently enlarged the scope of their useful-
ness by investing in an extensive pigeon-
Shooting “plant.” Like the high-toned
and intellectual Poll vaeedlepipes (who
always kept on hand a supply of birds for
shooting matches) they think “that birds
are made expressly for such purposes”
and go earnestly to work to kill and
mutilate harmless pigeons. This manly

“sport” attracts to Larchmont some of the ,
worst elements of the community, whom l
imitation of the Club men, carry guns,‘
have curs trotting at their heels, and
otherwise emulate the airs and swagger
of the pigeongkillers of the Club, not to
Speak of the great consumptlon or whisk-
ey and the resulting drunkenness and
brawling that ensues. Now this may be
very gratifying to them, but to the law-
abiding residents of Larchmont. the ad
vent of this new “enterprise” has been
received with a burst of indignation. and
steps are being taken to have a stop put
to it. They naturally object to have the
poor wounded birds falling on then'rbolfs
and door steps, or having the blood of t is
birds mingled with them elstel'n watel,
and the inhumanity of the whole busm’elslsl

A DOG—FIGHTENG CPOLICEMAN.

 

 

NO. 1, 94.0 FOUND BUSY AT A BATTLE RAIDED Br
OFFICERS OF THE S. P. C. A.

Policeman 1,940 was the most prominent person
in sight when oiiicers of the Society for the Pre-
vention of Cruelty to Animals raided a dog ﬁght at
nine o’clock last night. Policeman 1,940, in full
uniform, with his helmet on and his club dangling
from his belt, was taking care of the losing dog.
The latter was a most thoroughly Whipped animal,
andlthe bluecoat was sponging the blood oil him.

 

whom he was giving instructions about where to
take the defeated ﬁghter.

Superintendent Hankinson, of the Society for the“
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, received a tip at
three o’clock yesterday afternoon that the ﬁght
was to take place in Bloomingdale Brothers’ stables,
on Sixty-fourth street, between Second and Third
avenues. It had been gotten up very quietly and

 

 

every precaution had been taken to prevent any:

 

word reaching the Bloomingdales of the purpose for-5‘
which their premises were to be used. The ﬁght;
was billed to take place‘between halfepast nine P. MJ;
and midnight. , ~ _ .

At nine o’clock Oﬁlcers Lambert, Snowden and
Gray, acting on instructions from Mr. Hankinson, a
arrived at the place. They had not been invited,_§'
but they meant; to get in. The big doors of the,
stable were closed and they were at ﬁrst in a quan-sj

 

‘1 dary, until presently one of the ﬁrm’s' dry goods;

wagons drove up and the doors opened to admit it.g
Then the oﬂicers slipped in. 3
Half a dozen diodes and a party of sports were:
standing around“~ on the wagon or ground ﬂoor. _
Policeman 1,940 was there, nursing his dog in that
way that has been already described.
When he saw the \oﬁicers he turned as pale as a;
ghost and dropped the dog. He was so ﬂabbergasted‘
that he looked as if he didn’t know whether to club;
himself with his own nightstick or run. , .
f nnrnoscnuas FOR THE BLUECOATL
“This is a ﬁne business for a policeman to be in,”,
said Ofﬁcer Lambert sneeringly. Then he seized
the dog and the policeman disappeared. So did the
dudes and the sports, and the ofﬁcers had the
stable to themselves. They went out of every avail.
able window and,’door. . 3
“We couldn’t arrest any one,” said Lambert after-'
ward, “for it was; all over, and there was no evidence
that those there had participated in the ﬁght.” ,
The dog that Policeman 1,9le had been nursing
was a brindled bull terrier named Jack, _ weighing
about 24 lbs. 5He was believed to belong to
Mr. 1,940. Round his neck was a collar with a.
tag on it, showing that the terrier had been rcgiSs
tered in the Brooklyn license books of 1888. The
license number was 3,498. 1
Poor “Jack” was in a terrible plight. His two fore.
legs were chewed right through and his right hind

; M I
I’THE MISSISSIPPI SOCIETY FOR.
THE PREVENTION OF CRUEL-

TY TO ANIMALS.

 

 

The Report of the President, Submitted at
,the Fourth Annual Meeting of the
Mississippi Society For the
Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals.

There is nothmg that so encourage!
one in his effort to advance a good '
cause, as the sympathy and good-
will of those among whom his work car- ‘
ries him. It is as difficult to successful; ‘
1y forward a worthy effort, for the gen-
eral public good, where the people are
cold and indifferent concerning the re-
sult, as it is when public opinion direct-
fly opposes you. Especially is this so in .
,. reference to the humane work. And i
hundredfoltl more good can be done by ,
our society when we have the full sup-
port and encouragement of our oiti-P
zens. C I
When the work was instituted in
March 1886, many of our good people
withheld from us their approbation and
aid, but I am pleased to report that we
number more friends now than at ﬁrst,
and that the “Humane Society,” is an
organization that the majority of the
community respect, and we believe a
great many admire. We deeply appre- A
ciate allencouragemeut.
It will be seen from the Secretary’s
report that we have not made as many i
arrests during the past year, as the rc- ‘
ports have shown for the previous years.
The reasoii of this is: There is a de-
Lcrease in cases of open cruelty; then we I
do not make arrests now, except in cases
where there is no opportunity of remedy I
or prevention otherwise.

The complaints of cruelty to children
were more numerous during the past
year than heretofore. And I wish to
say. that in several cases, which we have
investigated, we Were unable to furnish
proper relief. They being for mistreat—
ment or neglect of infants by cruel par-
ents; the only way the cases could have
been remideed waste take the children '
away from their brutal parents.

But our society is composed of a very
few men, and has no funds whatever to
employ assistance, and strange to say,
has not the support to the extent of an
organized effort of the ladies of Natchez,
consequently had no place or means to
care for the helpless little ones. This
leads me to suggest that our two great-
est needs are, the ﬁnancial aid from
those of our people who want to see the i
work progress, and the co-operatibn and l
assistance of the noble women . who
have heretofore been so active and de-
voted in mi works for the beneﬁt of
mankind and the prevention of suffering g
and distress”

.We are pleased to report that the wa-
tering trough has been kept up the en-
tire year by the city, and that under the
agreement for the construction of water
works, now being rapidly carried on,
there will be four drinking fountains

citizens will aid us in this matter. ‘ We
owe several bills now that we have no
means of payinz-

Our society was represented at the last'
annual meeting of the American Hu-
mane Association. held at'l‘oronto, Can-
ada,in October 1888, by a written re-
.report,|and it is considered a branch of
that society. And we are also consider-

society.)
It is with deep sadness, that I refer to

Mt Joseph B. Stratton, Jr. In the full
strength and vigor of manhood, and in
the midst of a useful and active life, he
was taken from us. And we mourn the
loss of so sincere a friend to the cause of
mercy.

Before closing the report let me call
attention to what I consider the most
prevalent, useless and deliberate cruelty,
which Is practised in our city and that
is the “check-rein,” and gask owners of
horses to look at this needless cruelty in '
its own true light and take proper steps
to prevent it.

The local press have been kind to us
through the past year, and we desire to
express our appreciation of their assist-
ance.

And now let me ask you to help us in

 

 

. the work. To give the weight of your

 

erectedne in each ward of the city,
at convenient locations, and every foun-
tain will have three drinking places, re-
..spectively; for mankind, for larger ani-
nals, as horses and mules, and for small-
er animals as cats and dog.

MARRIN nsconns ANGRY.

His Caustic Criticism of ext-Justice
Frederick 59. Massey.

To the Editor or the Brooklyn. anze :

Your article in last night‘s issue headed “A
Mastiff‘s Ear ’ does myself and the Central Dem-
ocratic Association a gross injustice. First, Mr.
John Ennis is not a member of the Central Dem-
ocratic Association, nor is he a member of any
other organization to which I belong. If Massey
said I made an afﬁdavit in the case the main
points of which are untrue, Mr. Massey is a liar.
I think Justice Pratt is competent to attend to his
own business without any suggestion from
Massey. I merely made an afﬁdavit of what ac-
tually took place on the trial of the case before
Massey and I assert now that Ennis did not get a
fair trial such as is contemplated by the law
and, further, that Massey was not com-
petent to give such a trial ' by reason '
of bias and prejudice against the defendant
Massey stated just- before the trial that nothing
but the intervention of a divine providence would
prevent him from trying the case that day.» He
then ordered a jury to be found inside of an hour.
Ennis is not a political follower of mine; in fact
Ennis dial not even vote for me on Election day
—but even if he did I don’t suppose Massey or the
EAGLE will attempt to hold me responsible for the
acts of every man who voted for me. What I
have done has been perfectly honorable, and the.
same as any other lawyer is called upon to do
almost every day. My friend Massey exhibits his
prejudice too plainly for a man who should do
exact justice. I might- add that some men who
are far worse than Ennis remain outside of prison
walls—snot because they deserve imprisonment '
less. butbecause they'have‘been smart encugh to
* ‘ remain _r outside [the pale of the criminal law,

‘who unjustiﬁably administers any poi-
sonous 0r noxious drug or substance to
any animal, or unjustiﬁably exposes any
such drug or substance, with the intent;!
‘ that the same shall be taken by any ani- l:
' mal, whether such animal be the property 1
of himself or another, is guilty of a

' misdemeanor.”

I do not believe you wish to sanction,

cruelty in any way. It is not your na-El

, tureswyou simply forgot yourself. Don’t ;
kill the dogs, for their susceptibility of ,1
pain is the same as our own. 5

To whom shall the Ofﬁcers of the
humane society appeal in. their endeavors
to prevent cruelty and inhuman treat-
ment, if not to the pulpit and press.

Oh, do .not withhold this needed sup- ‘
port for we are in want of it. Your;
journal can help us. The object is 'gen- 5'
ercus, kind, Godlike. Champion ouri
cause as bestiyou can.

Eyery‘wetd of this is written in kind-
ness, in the hope that it may in some
way lessen suffering, cruelty and pain,

Years ago that great and good Henry
Bergh founded the society known as the
American Society for the Prevention of.
Cruelty to Ahimals. N early every act of g
the present code which lessens pain and!
cruelty, emanated from his ready pen,’

Policemen With Dark Lanterns Descent!
' " ' 'Into'the Bowels of the Earth.

A dog ﬁght in a cellar underneath a black-
smith shon adjoining James Crowley’s saloon
in Railroad street and Vernon avenue, Long
Island City. was raided by Police Sergeant
Carroll and seven policemen about 12 o’clock
Oil-Saturday night. The only way of reaching
the cellar was through a trap door in the back
room of the saloon. The cellar in which the
ﬁght took place was about thirty by forty feet.
In the centre was a rough-made dog pit
stained with the blood of: former battles. The
police had had guards posted in the neighbor-
hood early in the evening. About 11%;: o’clock
7 a numberof men were seen to enter the saloon.

. walk into the back room. and disamvear through
the trap door. Soon after this, Sergeant Car-
1 roll and his men walked into the saloon. Not a
sound was to be heard. Bartender-ﬁniith was
the only one to be seen. and he was behind the
bar busily engaged in cleaning up. Only three
.ijof the policemen were in uniform. The bar-
;j7j7tender was commanded not to stir from where
he was. The ofﬁcers then walked quietly into
{the back room. lifted the trap door, and disap-
'peared one after the other. the Sergeant leading
the way. There is a dark passage of about ﬁve
test between the saloon cellar and the other
3 , cellar. .With the aid of a dark lantern the ofﬁ-
7} 3 cars found their way through this passage and
into the cellar. Two smoking kerosene lamps
7‘7glighted the place. In the pit. rolling over and
7-,7‘j'over and covered with blood, were two dogs.
. Aboat thirty Spectators. seated en empty beer
; : begs, boxes. and boards surrounded the pit.
“Then some one in the crowd shouted
7 f ‘7‘ Police.” Instantly the spectators made a
. 7‘ dash for the only exit. Here they were met by
the police. who drove them back with drawn
j7 clubs. ‘ The lamps were knocked down and ex-
_ gtinguished. This left the place for an instant
in total darkness. Then. with the aid of their
{7, darklanterns, the police could see the men
.3,___crawling into empty boxes and barrels. An-
got‘her lamp and a lantern were obtained. The
- 77'3iamates or theeellar were then taken four at a

SPEAKS HIS llllNl).
Justice Patterson’s Opinion of the Society
for Prevention of Cruelty to Annuals.

Civil Justice John Petterson, sitting on the 7
bench in the First District Police Court, from
which Justice Andrew Walsh has for over
twenty years administered justice satisfactorily
and impartially, treated the court attaches
and attendants to another variation to-day.
Variations in the Adams street police court
since Justice Walsh has started on his vacation
have occurred with such regularity that they
have come to be regarded in the light, of what the
terse newspaper man calls a chestnut, but
some of them are rich and rare and the manner
in which the law is juggled ’with sometimes
makes the sleek hair of some of the learned
counsel in the law stand on end.

'l‘o-day Edward Gerlach, who keeps a riding
academy at 472 Paciﬁc street, was defendant
in a case. He was Ecbarged .with cruelty to
animals, and Counselor :George F. Elliott ap-
peared for the prosecution on behalf of the
Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

The complaining witness, Edward P. b‘im-
mons, of 12'). Park place, testiﬁed that he saw
the. defendant a few days ago driving a horse
through Sixth avenue. 'lhat he was using-
spurs and a strong bit, and that the animal
was bleeding at the sides and mouth from the
manner in which he was tortured by the
rider. .

Dr. Plageman, a veterinary surgeon. also
testiﬁed that he saw the horse in the condition
described by the complaining witness, and that
such treatment to an animal was cruel in the
extreme.

Gcrlach took the stand in his own behalf
and testiﬁed that the horse was so vicious that
it was necessary to use spurs and a strong bit
to manage him.

Dr. Burns, another veterinary surgeon, testi-
ﬁed for Gerlacu and stated that he had exam—
ined the hose four days after the occur—
rence, and saw no marks about
his side or mouth that would
indicate that be had been cruelly treated.
Veterinary Surgeon Plagerman was recalled
and stated that it was a very easy thing." to
obliterate all the evidences of the cruel treat—v
meut With bit and spurs in twenty-four hours.

. Justice Patterson, in rendering his decision.
gave the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals quite a lecture. He said he had
seen Mr. Gcrlach himsslf riding the
horse in question, and he knew
him to be a vicious animal. lie spoke highly

.‘f the defendant as an equestrian, and su':~

 

 

 

gestcd that if the Society tor the Prevention
oi Cruelty to Animals would take cognizance
of the cruelty to horses practiced at
tie race tracks instead of arresting such men
as Mr. Gerlach they would do. much better.
Nevertheless he round the abused defen lent
guilty and imposed the minimum line of $1.

”W

WAS MR. GERLACH CRUEL‘?

A. RIDING MASTER PROSECUTED
BY BERGH’S SOCIETY.

 

 

 

 

 

It is Alleged That He Unnecessarily Spurred
a Horse Which He was Riding—Gerlach
Says He Used no More Severity Than
Necessary.

The trial of Alexander Gerlach, the pro-
prietor of a riding academy, on Paciﬁc street, for
cruelty to animals, in the Adams street police
court this morning, afforded Justice Petterson
another opportunity to show his extreme friends
liness for Mr. Gerlach by an eulogistic speech from
the bench in that gentleman’s behalf. Mr. Edward
P. Simmons, of 122 Park place, was the complain-
ing witness and was aided by the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
through Mr. George Elliott, their counsel.
Mr. Simmons testiﬁed that on June 30
he saw Mr. Gerlach“ riding a dark bay horse on
Sixth avenue and then turn down Sterling place
and enter the Fleetwood stables, where the horse’s
mouth was sponaed out and blood removed. The
sides of thehorse were also bleeding from too free
use of the spurs. Mr. Gerlach then mounted the
horse again and proceeded to his stable on Paciﬁc
street, using the spurs and pulling at the horse’s
mouth so severely as to cause the blood to drip
along the street as the horse progressed. The wit~
ness was cross-examined by Counselor O’Brien
and the court and said that he was acquainted
with saddle horses, as he had owned one for some
years. The horse Mr. Gerlach rode was going
quietly along the street at the time.

Dr. Plageman, a veterinary surgeon who lives on
Sterling place. testiﬁed that he saw Gerlach use
unnecessary cruelty to the animal. He said he
had trained horses in this country and in India
and seldom had occasion to use spurs in doing
so. He said it was not necessary. On cross-
examination he said he was a member of the So—
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

The defense then placed Mr. Gerlach on the.
stand. He began inaloud voice to say that he
had been a horse trainer for forty years and never
treated an animal cruelly in his life. The horse
that ﬁgured in this case, he said, was a vicious
one, and harsh treatment had to be resorted to in
order to keep it from running away. Such treat-
ment was not cruelty.

“ Do you mean to say,” asked Mr. Elliott, “ that
digging the spurs into the horse’s sides and pulling
on the bit as the witnesses say you did, drawing
blood, was not cruelty?”

“No,” replied the witness, “it is not cruelty,
it is horsemanship.”

Dr. Burns, a veterinary surgeon, of 100 Adams
street, employed by Gerlach, next swore that he
examined the horse in question four days after
the alleged spurring and could ﬁnd no traces of
any wounds. He said if any had been made ﬁve
days previously he could have seen them, as the
marks would remain. He knew this horse and
knew it to be a vicious one.

“In your nine years" acquaintance with Mr.
Gerlach,” asked Mr. O'Brien, “ have you ever
known him to (be cruel to an animal?”

Counselor Elliott objected to this question, and
said that if this line of testimony was to be ad-
mitted he could bring 100 citizens to show that Mr.
Gerlach was the cruelest man in Brooklyn as re-
gards horses. It was admitted, however, and the
witness replied in the negative. ‘

Dr. Plageman was recalled and said that an in-
jury such as was described in this case could be
healed over in twenty-four hours. He was asked
if Mr. Gerlach was a member of the society and
replied that he did not know. It came out, though,
that Mr. Gerlach had been a member of the society
for two years, and when Mr. Elliott asked . him if

he (Gerlach) had ever been arrested for cruelty to
animals while a member, Justice Petterson broke

 

members.” Mr. Gerlach said he neverhad.‘
This closed the case and the Court began this
startling and unprecedented address from the

bench :

“I have never spoken to Mr. Gerlach in my life, ‘

but I know him as a great horseman whose repu-
tation stands the highest in the country. I have
seen him ride this identical horse and knowthe
hosre to be a particularly vicious one and could
:not be ridden without spurs. I have a little horse
knowledge myself and know that Mr. Gerlach is a
great horse trainer. I think if 7 the society would
turn their, attention to the race tracks and stop the
cruelty to the horses there it would pay them
much better. However, on the eVidence here I

A HIGH PRICE FOR HIS FULLY.

One Hundred Days and $100 for Hiding a.
(Handed Horse.

John Kearney. a horse dealer living at the
corner of North Eighth and Seventh streets, Was
ﬁned $1 00 and sentenced to 100 days’iinprison-
ment by Judge Goctting yesterday morning on
a charge of allowing a horse suffering from a.
contagious disease to have liberty in places
where the health of man and beast coming
in contact With the animal would be affected.

Some time ago Benjamin Weille, of No. 247
North Seventh street, purchased some horses.
0n arriving home, e noticed one of them acted

I'itllf‘lgptw'llllal'w. as if sick. He called lll'Veter.
inai'ynurgeon Mustoe, who. after a. careful ex-
animation, gave it as his opinion that the horse
was glanderl. He told Weille to quarantine the
horse until the Friday following. Weille 91.1.1
not like to have the horse near the others, and
askedJohnvltearuey if he would put the horse
in his stable until the doctor called. Kearnev
consented, and the horse was taken to his stable.

Dr.,i\f‘lustoe called the next Friday, and after
exammmg the horse. he pronounced the animal
as glanded, a disease contagious to both man
and beast, and incurable. He ordered the
horse to be shot, and telephoned to the ofﬁce of
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Ani-
mals. Oﬁicer W Devyse of that society
called that same afternoon at Kearney’s stable
to shoot the horse. Just as he was nearing the
stable he saw hearncy driving down Seventh
street With the horse tied to the back of
the wagon. _ Devyse wait-ed at Kearney’s
house that night until he came home. When
Kearney returned the ofﬁcer asked him what he
did WlTh the horse and why he took away the
animal when he knew the nature of the disease.
Kearney replied that the horse was not glan-
dQI‘F‘d. and wouldn’t tell where he had taken it to.

’l'he oilicer made searches for three or four
day..- to ﬁnd the horse. but was unsuccessful.
On Friday. July 19, early in the morning, the
ofﬁcer followed Kearney to Woodhaven and saw
him go into the woods. The ofﬁcer followed
him, and after going tome distance he saw the
horse tied to a wagon, with several little cottages
near by. He was told that it was Kearney who
had left the horse there. The ofﬁcer went to
Woodhavcn the n xt day with Mr. Weille and shot
the horse.

Oﬁ‘icer Devvoe arrested Kearney on the follow-
ing 1 uesday. and yesterday the latter had a num.
ber of horsemen pre-~ent who testiﬁed that the
horse was not glandei'ed, but Judge Goetting was
con vincod otherwise and made him pay the pen.-
alty. The farmers in the neighborhood were
thoroughly aroused by Mr. Thompson‘s action
in permitting the horse to remain in the vicin-
ity. '_l here is a pond near Thompmn’s house
where the neighboring horses and cattle water,
and the glaridercd horse was permitted to
drink from this water. The disease is charac-
terized by a constant discharge . of'ﬁmucmis
from the nostrils. This discharge is very con-
taminating, and some of it must have fallen
into the pond. The farmers are alarmed at the
thought of the possibility of infection through
drinking the water. and loudly censure the per-
sons who exposed them to danger.

JUSTICE PETTERSEN arrows ANBi‘EﬁﬁiA’N,
And Does Not Believe He Wren-11d Do
Anything Wrong. ,

 

 

Edward P. Simmons, of 122 Park place, was a.
complainant before Justice Pettersen this morn-
ing against Alexander Gerlach, proprietor of a
riding academy at 472 Paciﬁc street, whom he
charged with cruelty to a horse. Mr. Simmons
made an afﬁdavit that he saw Gerlack riding the
animal in Sehermerhorn street, and that it was
suffering from wounds in the sides. Its injuries,
he continued, were caused by the use of spurs.
Gerlach pleaded not guilty to the charge. He
said that he was training the horse, and that it
was necessary to use spurs on it.

Lawyer Elliott. in behalf of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, requested that
his Honor impress on the defendant the serious
nature of the offence with which was charged.

“Oh,” replied Justice Patterson. “I know Mr.
Gerlach and I am sure he would not do anything
wrong.”

The case was adjourned until Friday, Gerlach
being allowed to go on his own recognizance.

Ht Bit aDog’s Ear and Was Sent to the
Penitentiary for a Year.

 

THAT WAS JUST TWO WEEKS AGO.

————-

 

Now He Is Out and a Reporter of “ The

AWorld,” After Much Trouble, Ascor-
tnined that He Was Released onlan
Appeal by Judge Pratt—District-Attor-
ney Ridgway Will Watch the Case.

Several letters have been received by THE

, WORLD regarding the release,'a few days ago. Of

John Ennis from the penitentiary, where he was
sent by Judge Massey on April 29 for one year
and sentenced to pay a ﬁne of $500 for biting off
the end of a dog’s car. A writer of one of the
"letters says:

‘ ‘ It is outrageous t ‘ justice can be defeated

j by politics, which see s to be the case in this

instance.”

Another correspondent writes: “I, with a
great many other people in ' South Brooklyn,
Would like to know what is the matter with the
Society for theﬁrevention of Cruelty to Ani-
male, as John Ennis, whom the Society prose-
cuted for biting off a dog’s ear two weeks ago
and had the man sent to the penitentiary for
twelve months, is- out and visiting his old
haunts. the case having been settled. ”

Supt. Clark, of the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals, was seen in his ofﬁce

yesterday and asked what he knew about Ennis .

being out of the penitentiary. He replied:

“ All I know is that he is out and we—the
Society—«had nothing whatever to do in getting
him released. I understand that his counsel in-
stituted some legal proceedings so that he is
out on bail. The Society’s counsel, George F.
Elliott, has been apprised of this and is looking
into the matter. As I understand Ennis is
a man with considerable political inﬂu-
and has been in scores of scrapes
and always succeeded in wriggling out of them,
The records at the Butler street station-house
show that Ennis has been arrested more than
thirty times. He is the terror of that section.
In speaking of him they call him ” Big Jack.”
He is a laborer along shore. This dog case was
one of great brutality. Ennis, with two pals.
went into Charles J . Murray’s liquor saloon.No.
129 Butler street, on the afternoon of April 22
and called for beer. Murray’s $1 00 St. Bernard
dog lay on the ﬂoor at the end of the counter. It
was chained to the ﬂoor, not because it was
savage, but to keep it from running into
the street, where it might be picked up.
While Murray had his back turned, drawing the
glasses of beer, Ennis stooped down and bit
about an inch and a half off the end of the dog’s
left ear. The animal howled with pain and there
Was soon a pool of blood. Ennis. with all the
brutal instincts of a cannibal, took the piece
from his mouth and exhibited it to those against
the bar. Murray, who is a'small man, knew that
to expostulate with Bonus would be simply in-
viting a unch oi’ the head. so he kept his mouth
shut; e turned, however, to the dog and re-
marked, ” That takes about $25 off your value.”
The dog’s ear is only now healing.

“When Ennis left the saloon he was noisy
and was arrested at the corner oi Butler and
Bond streets by Officer Dougherty for intoxgca-
tion and locked up that nlght 1n the Euler
street station-house. Early the next morning
I was notiﬁed that Ennis had bitten the dog’s
ear, and we got out a warrant and arrested him
on that charge. He leaded not guilty before
Justice Massey, and t 6 trial was set down for
April 29. The Judge posmvel refused to ad.
m1t Ennis to bail. 18 counsel emanded a jui-
triaJ, On the day named, the case was tried nd
the jury found Enms 5511111337. Whereupon J u ge
Massey sentenced him to one year in the peni-
tentiary and $509 ﬁne. @nd to Stand committed
in $1 per da until the $000 was paid. There is
one thing HE .WonnD may be assured of, and
that is, our’Somety W111 learn Just why this man

Lawyer George .F. Elliott.

LIMING SONG- BIRDS. ‘1 ,
W ITHIN the past few weeks great numbers of son
birds have been destroyed or captured within the E El;
limits of this city. Men provided with bird lime and
decoys have this spring visited the upper sections of New
York Island, Where there are still ﬁelds and woods, and
during the migration have made away with thousands of
the beautiful creatures which were making their journey
from the south toward their ,summer homes.

By Chapter 427 of the Laws of 1886 it is speciﬁcally
provided that no person shall catch with bird lime or any
similar substance any song bird or any wild bird other
than a game bird. The penalty for a violation of this act
is imprisonment in the county jail fora period of not less
than ﬁve or more than thirty days, or a fine of not less
than ten or more than ﬁfty dollars, or both ﬁne and im—
prisonment, at the discretion of the court. .

However difﬁcult it may be in the country districts to
enforce this and similar laws, there should be no trouble
about doing it in the city,where it falls Within the prov-
ince of the police to prevent infractions of the statutes.
The police who patrol the upper end of the island, or
some of them, appear to be ignorant of their duty in this
matter. and it will be well for the captains of the various
precincts to bring this subject to the attention of their

TUESDAY EVENING. HAY ‘21. 1889.

 

Was Bitten Off by Inﬂuential
John Ennis.

How it Happens that a Brute Who 1llutil-
ated a Brute is Out of Jail—Was Judge
Pratt Imposed l'pon ?

6

When that distinguished social ornament, John
Ennis, who had been llDDl‘lb'OllCd and ﬁned $500
by Justice Massey for biting off part of a iiiiistill".~r
ear, reappeared at his customary haunts recently,
those who supposed him to be behind prison bars
were naturally surprised. Inquiry, however.
brought to light the fact that be had
been discharged by Justice Pratt upon the
application of Lawyer James P. Judge. Ex-
Justice Massey who scutcncvd l’lyun was seen
this morning by an EAGLE reporter. He did not
feel inclined to discuss the matter because it is
still at- issuc in court as Judge Moore will in a few
days be called upon to determine whether the
conviction is valid or not. The reporter, how-
ever, was shown the papers in the case including
the afﬁdavits presented by Mr. Judge and upon
which Judge Pratt allowed the appeal. The alli-
davits were made by Denis Sheehan, Frank C.
Marrin and James‘P. Judge. Justice Massey con-
fessed his surprise that any member of the bar
had the hardiliood to impose such affidavits upon
the Supreme Court.

“To illustrate," said the exg’psticc. “One Denis
Sheehau, a layman, makes an afﬁdavit concern-
ing questions of law which are not only absolutely
false but which clearly indicate that the state-
ments were prepared for him by a lawyer, for iii-
stance:

That proof was admitted against defendant’s
objection, that was utterly and clearly irrelevant,
incompetent and prejudicial to defendant. ‘hat
the jury was illegally and improperly impanelcd
and the substantial rights of the defendant. were
thereby greatly prejudiced. That the justice in
his charge to the jury did so charge them, con-
trary to the law and evidence, etc.

“Marrin makes an ali‘iulavit, which is untrue in
the main, and presents a garbled statement of
the facts. By such statements, which Judge
Pratt hadto assume were true, he could not well
have refused the allowance of appeal. He was
imposed upon, and were I in his place I would
hold the parties who imposed upon me to an
accountability. Marrin swears, among other
things, that he asked an adjournment upon the
ground that Ennis’ counsel was not in court,
and someone has induced Sheehan to swear that

1 Mr. James 0. Church was Ennis’ counsel, while

the fact is that Mr. Church was never retained to
defend Ennis. Further, Marrin informed me
that he was obliged to defend Ennis because he
and his friends were his political followers: that
were it otherwise he would not defend him or
have anything to do with the case. The re-
cords of the courts show that Ennis has
been convicted forty-eight times. He is an
idle, good for nothing loafer whom all decent
people shun. His trial was absolutely fair, the
jury being reputable business men. The evidence
was conclusive. He hit oh" the ear of a good na-
tured, harmless mastiff out of pure malice and
spit it out upon the ﬂoor. His discharge was

a great' injustice and; to my mind. re-
ﬂects seriously upon those who were par-
ties to imposing upon Judge Pratt. The

law provides that a party charged with an offense
before aCourt of Special Sessions may have an
adjournment for not less than ﬁve nor more than
ten days. He had six days. He had a right
to a .Jul‘y trial and had one. The jury
were impanelcd exactly in accordance with
the laws and Marriu knows it, if he knows
anything whatever” of law. I am satisﬁed
the convmtion will stand. and that an appeal
would never have been allowed had counsel stated
tl'Utllflllly the facts as they were instead of per-
verting the truth. I have done my duty in the
.matter, and I believe the proper authorities will
see to 11: that this dog eater gets his just desserts,

tnOtWithamnding the fact that he is apolitical

’lhe publication in THE WORLD of Ennis's re.

for the Tlftl‘t they had taken in introducing
Dennis-S icchan.

“ 'llus man Sheehan is a layman,” said the
ex-Jndgc, " and is unknown in Brooklyn. He -
set up a legal argument based Don false state.
ments of thrifaets. Frank C. lilarrln informed
me that he ( inhked very much to act as counsel
for Ennis but was obliged to in view of he
fact that Lnnis was one of his olitical ol-
lowers. His afﬁdavit is false, and) so far as it
treats of the law indicates his ignorance there-
0 . , ,

”It- is an outrage, " went on the Jud e. ”that
an attorney should 1m ose upon the Court "aili-

Bishop Battles, of England, believed that there
was a resurrection for animals, and pointed to
the wonderful care which is shown in the Old and
New Testaments for the animal creation from
. the time of Adam to the “sparrow that falleth

horse for sale. .“I will sell this little horse for
$5,” said Morris, pomting to a dilapidated
specimen, whose forward legs were bent until
T his knees almost reached the ground. “He’s a
‘ sacred horse.” continued the trader. “and he’s
‘ praying all the time. Wasn't great regard paid
for ‘much cattle,’ which the city of Nineveh
contained?” asked Morris. as he proceeded to
argue with Dutch Fred that any praying horse
was well worth $7.51).

“Jack of Diamonds ” Ten dollars was the

2:18 or no sale. And thus the gossip went on.
Horses were sold, wagons were swapped and
.barnesses were loaned for trial Spins on the
road. Suddenly there was a great commotion
in the market, and some one said, “Here comes
‘Frank Clark, the superintendent of the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.”

All the dealers are afraid of Clark, for he
has followed them up pretty closely when
they bought or sold a disabled animal. He
has done some very good work since the es—
tablishment of the horse market, and has
cared for hundreds of poor horses that were
wrecked and broken down with hard work.
Mr. (Hark was appointed an ofﬁcer of Bergh’s
socrety in November, 1874, and served alone
on Long Island until 1381, taking in the coun~
ties of Kings, Queens and Suli'olk. As there
was sufﬁcient work for lialf—a-dozen men in
Brooklyn alone, it was decided by the Ameri-

can Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to

Animals to open an oliice in Brooklyn. This

was done through the eli'orts of H. B. Claﬂiin,

Henry Bergh and George I. Seney. Josiah It.

Pye was appointed superintendent of the

Brooklyn agency, and the oiiice on Fulton
. ' In 1887 Pye was made so~

liCitor and l‘vTI‘. Clark was made superintendent;

The work of the society increased steadily, and

several new ofﬁcers were appointed. An am—

bulance for the removal of disabled horses

was then provided. At the beginning of the

present year Mr. J. P. Haines was elected presi-

dent of the society, and he has promised to in-

crease the good work now being done by

thousands of animals are saved from cruel
deaths annually. ‘
It was owing to Mr. Clark’s good work that
Marks Reubens was ﬁned $50 for cruelty to
his horse. teubens’ horse had the disease
known as lampers, which is somewhat similar
to common gumboil, and would not eat. He
burned the horse’s tongue with a red-hot
poker, and when that failed to improve the
beast’s appetite he cut out one of the animal’s
eyes, put tobaccojuice in the eye socket and
then replaced it, claiming that this was an old
Polish charm. {Still there was no improve-
ment, and after, as a dernier resort, boring a
hole in the horse’s head with a gimlet; and
still finding no disposition to eat, Reubens
turnedthe poor animal out into a lot and set

, about ﬁnding a purchaser for him. Mr. Clark

presented himself as a purchaser, and found
t e horse lying down. Reubens was about to
make him get up With the aid of a bail stick
when Clark captured him.

voice and physical bouyancy are falling;
is still full of energy when the favoritetheme
of his life is touched upon, and every-sen-
tence ofhis talk on that subject cont-ems a
poetic thought peculiarly attractive to the
listener. A reporter for THE COMMERCIAL
found him engaged among his correspond~
enee last evening, and was received with
that marks such recep—
tions by old and experienced journalists
who have “been through the mill” and are
wondrous kind to the young fellows. His
mission to Louisville is a sad one. He, like
the great society of which he is the recog-
nized leader, began his career in Louisville,
and many years ago married the wife here
who a year ago he brought back and buried
in Cave Hill, and over whose grave
he is now superintending the erection of a
handsome monument. The people with
whom he is stopping are Mrs. Matilda Swope
and her daughters, the mother and sisters of
the late Mrs. Pye. When at home his whole

the Suc-

attention is occupied in the
city of Brooklyn, where he -
has about twenty assistants, with

whose assistance he accomplishes great good

among the dumb creatures and children of
. thatanditsgrcatsister city. Much of his work ,
before the death of Mr. Bergh was the 01‘7“

 

ganization of branch societies, and he has bee
instrumental in originatinthhcsc in nea,
every State 01' the Union. The 0st,
in which he is held by the officials of th _
societies is in part testiﬁed by gold and 0th _
medals, of which he has a considerable num~

her, and many of the benevolent societies of
the country have in the past few years

elected him an honorary member. “I wish
I could deliver you a lecture,” he
said to his. caller last night, “and

I think I will come back in about. six months
and lecture to the people of Louisville. I am
willing to pay for my own hall, lights and
fuel,and want no money from the :people,
except what they want to give to help ad-
vance the great good done by these societies
for the prevention of cruelty. I am
not a fanatic, but may be
a ‘crank.’ If I am, however, I believe I
am ‘turning’ in the right direction, the only
thing for cranks to do. I am laboring; for
the protection of the helpless, and will be
satisﬁed with my lit'e’s work it I can impress
on the rising generation that it is
right to do so. I don’t want
to see people cruelly treated, because I labor
for the brutes and children, though in my
experience I have olten seen creatures on
two legs who I thought should be down on
all tours, and four-legged creatures who had
bigger souls than some men, and deserved to

walk erect. I don’t think I
have ever lacked manliness, but
I can’t keep from shedding

indignant tears, and tears for pity’s sake,
when I see a brute or helpless child in pain.
Did you ever look in the eye of a good

how much more do: rving he is or

ginning to sermonize, however, and it is use-

less to go over to you the stereo-
typed but truthful arguments we have
used for years. 1 only want

to say that the good work we, are doing i,-

Superintendent: Clark’s Report for the
Month of August.
Superintendent Clark, of the Society for the
PreVention of Cruelty to Animals, makes the
f(’H‘J‘Wing report for the month of August:

During that time 28 arrests were made and

2 convictions obtained. Fifty-31x complaints
Were received and attended to. The disabled
animals Irelieved from labor numbered 55, and
74, disabled animals were humanely destroyed. 32,

Ours Picked Up.

 

There are on an average 600 dogs con-
stantly in the London dog home, writes a.
correspondent of The .Bostoinﬂeratd. They

; are nearly all brought in by members of
i the police force. If the dogs happen to be
.! clean and healthy they are kept; for three,
| 3 days to await redemption by their Owners.
3 If they are mangy or diseased in any way

they are killed at once. After the three ,

days have expired the valuable ones are3 f
picked out to be sold, and the others g0]

with the nasty ours.

The waits are kept in clean, wellevengliif:
latcd kennels, and are given the best'ot“ .,

care, plenty of clean food and water and
ample exercise grounds. During 1886,
while the muzzling order was inforced', -
45,000 dogs passed through the home. , Only]
a few of this enormous number were claimed 3
by their owners. Since 1886 the number"
taken int-ocustody has beena great deal
less. During 1888, 15,321. were received.
‘Each dog is carefully examined by the
veterinary in charge. Out of this number
but ﬁve showed symptoms of rabies. Four .
of the ﬁve were detected at the entrance oil
the home. The lethal chamber is the in!
vention of Dr. B. EV. Richardson, F. R. 8.,
and has been used with, perfect succeSs fold
over four years. One hundred dogs can be ,
put painlessly to death at one time. (-
’I‘he chamber is made of well-seasoned
lumber, with a double wall. the space be-
tween being ﬁlled with sawdust. There
are but two openings, one in frOnt, the slid,—
ing door, and the other the escape pipe. It
is so constructed that a cage, in Whichitlie
dogs are placed, can be run into it With)"
great rapidity immediately upon raising'éthe:
sliding door, and can be quickly inclosedkih i
it by pulling; down the door. Beforethei‘

dogs which are to he. killed are place in the . ,?

chamber, the chamber itself is fully charged
with narcotic vapor, produced by passing ' _- 33

carbonic oxide over a surface of anaesthetic ; 9’3

mixture, composed of chlorofOrm and bi—

A HOSPITAL FOR ANIMALS.

A new building for the use of the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals has just been ﬁnished. It
is intended for the ambulance service
and the treatment of maimed and
suffering animals. This structure is
at 111 East Twenty-second street,
almost directly Opposite the present
headquarters, and consists of a two-
story building 25 Icet wide by 100 feet
deep. It was designed by John T.
Hayes, now president of the society,
and is admirably arranged for its in-
tended purposes. Accomodations are
provided not only for horses but also
A decided novelty
is the death chamber, which consists
of a heavy wooden box, lined with gal—
vanized iron, and having a glass door
in front. The interior of this box is
connected by means of a small pipe
with the gas main, and when it be-
any of the
animals to death, they are placed with-
in, the door closed, rendering it air

l. tight, and the gas turned on, when, in
A a few moments, they become uncon—
scrous, and soon expire.

AXHIAIA ON THE (IAXALS.

(uncers Snow-den nil-3.62117, of the Society for the
p15,..1njon gs," Cruelty to Animals. have been Sent.
by l‘lCSl(ll.'Ut1iltllll=F alongthc lines of the several
canals of this State to inspect the condition or the,
horses and mules employed on the low path. Their

T llI‘ST cilia-in“. report. rvi‘t'ch rd yesterday, reveals facts

synimihy for the patient
”23351301” burden that toil from morning to night,
too slim-hung "to de
s-rrllus.

'l heir ﬁrst oiliciui :u-t was to suspend from labor

\Vzatcrloni, on the l-‘rie (anal. The animal was so
1.2mm it could hardly put its foot to thcground.
"We only Ra‘anlctl Lo make this trip; then We Were
going in .«r-ll 1hr old nag,” was the util‘eeling excuse
given 05‘ Till: captain oi’ the lmut. 'l‘he horsewas
put lllLL) an adjacent barn in charge of a. veterinary
surgeon by the otl'u-crs, and will be kept there until
in tin condition to work—«if that can everbe—or

, they will end its suffering; on their way home.

At. polices the condition of things was much .
The press-nun: of the. ofﬁcers on thetow-
path had. been telegraphed all along the line, and

3 when they ordered the commander of the Junietta
t to have to they were greeted with shouts of rich»

ant-e and threats of per sonal violence.

The motive power, a team of mules, was stopped
and on examination, a dreadful sore,
the brwast if one of the animals. The. harness was
pressmg into the wound and the poor creature
showed eve—r3: sign of Sllffel‘lllg. Joseph H. Finds,
the driver, was taken before Recorder Mellvain of;
(Echoes, who imposed a line of Souths: man pleads
ing,r guilty. ’lhe wounded animal was stablcd and
cared for, and till not be worked again this season.

The next persons arraigned for cruelty were the
driver and captain of the Kenyon and Newton.
The ‘. ictims in this. case were also a team of mules,
borh of which were sut‘i‘ering from wounded breasts,
thrczt by three and four Ly four inches. 'ihe driver,
John Wilson of Buffalo, was discharged, and the
captain, Eugene Crimmins, of Syracuse, was ﬁned
5-10 for causing and permitting the animals to be.
used in. to condition described.

By this time the excitement on the tow path was
at fever heat. and when the oiiicers appeared again
in company with the society"?- local agent. Mr. H.
"" Bruce, it looked as: if trouble was brewing for
1h.om,'oi:t the determined appearance of the oﬁi~
cials had a Lilliéilllg eii'ocz on the more. belligerent,
of the crowd, and when the boat E. J. Dixon, of Os
“ego, Captain William Matter-3:, was hauled up to the.
bank of the canal no opposition was offered.

Une oz” the mules attached to the tow line of
the Dixon had frightful ulcers on both sides
of the breast four by three and five by two
inches. into which the collar pressed and rubbed.
The driver, George Hunter. and the captain, were
arrested and taken before Recorder Iiclcllvain, who
discharged the former. but lined the captain :35.
The mules were put into a barn and cared for.

V‘v'hile the oillcers were absent at court in the
latter case quite a ﬂeet of boats came through the
canal Licks. the drivers urging their animals along

3 with whip and voice. thinking, no doubt, to get
through unnoticed.

The sudden appearance of the
officers. however. created consternation, and an
exciting scene ensued.

The boars were quickly hauled up to the bank,
and amid the shouting and cursing of drivers the
mules and horses were compelled to jump aboard
and the vessels tied up. A thorough examination
of the stock was made, resulting in many of the
poor creatures being reSpited from labor for the
rest of the season, and no boat was allowed to
proceed until a sufﬁcient number of. sound horses
or mules was provided.

President liainc-s is determined to keep up the
crusade season after season. until scenes of crnei‘tv,

“Progress, Enterprise and Vigor” seems to
be the motto adopted by President John P.
Haines, of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals.
During the short time he has held the hon—
ored position of chief executive of the society’s
aliairs, he has taken advantage of every legit-
nnate Circumstance to promote and encourage
the interests and welfare of the society.
Among the many excellent improvements he
has made perhaps the most noteworthy is the
remodelling and reﬁtting of the interior of the
society’s headquarters, cornerof Fourth avenue
and ’l‘wenty—second street, New York. The re-
pairs and alterations have been in progress for
some time past, and it is expected that every-
thing will be in ship shape by Dec. 10 next.
”the 1mprovements will be quite extensive
and when completed will surprise those whd
have not visited the building lately by reason
of their general excellence and elaborateness.

A great imany truckmen who carry fruit

I discharged by various steamers along the

river front have been in the habit of over-

. loading their trucks to such an extent that, in
many instances, the horses are almost unable
to draw the tremendous burdens which the
unscrupulous drivers allow to be heaped upon
them. Superintendent Clark, of the Socrety
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, has
been watching these men for some time past,
and his ofﬁcers have already forced more than .

- A Revival of Interest in Their Protection
Against Cruelty.

At the meeting of the Society for the

Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. called

i at the rooms of the Business Men’s asso-

tiation, last evening, Vice-President Dan.

iel Bookstaver took the chair, with John

 

 

 

R. Clancy secretary. The treasurer,
H. K. \Vhite, was also pres-
cut, as were over 30 others,

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

among Whom were: E. PJBat-es, Michael
Ryan, Robert Casey, J. n. Clancy. J- L-
Bagg, Rev. Mr. Randolph, P. S. Ryder,
Andrew Boyd, J. P. Bishop, 0. A. llam- ,
mond, C. B. Freeman, Christian Cook, _

Snowdon and J. H. Gay of New leak-C. ‘
.D. B. Mills, E. A. Powell, J. ‘5”. Cream,
0. A. Hamlin andGeorge P. Curran.
In opening the meeting Mr. Bookstavcr
said that the society had been quietior
some time on account of lack of funds,
until now when a couple of men from
New York,who are members of the parent
society, have come to the city and made
the people here to understand that they
I mean business and mean to have the dumb
' animals protected from cruelty. 'l‘he po-
lice here, Mr. Bookstaver said. do not
act as they should in the mat-
ter. but he added that J ustlce
Mulholland could not be too much praised
tor the help he has given to the socrety.
Mr. Bookstaver then asked the further

leasure of the meeting and W. F. Seward
of the Herald arose. He said in brief that
instead of bewaihng past emissions the so-
ciety ought to think of what it .may
do in the future, and after decnling
fwhat to do, todo it. There is plenty of
humane sentiment in the city, he said, to
support such a society as this, which a
little earnest work will bring out. Cruelty
t abounds, even in children, who growing
:up many of them without proper home

“and their ideas corrected by the moral
eﬁ'orts of the society. With such a society
'. the moral effects should be greater even
'_ than the effects of the punishment of the

 

 

‘ offenders. ‘With a membership of 105,‘the

president 0f the Board of Police Commis- "

sioners. . r. Ryder also complimented
the police force and promised the help and
co-Operation of the department, This
promise procured Mr. Ryder Vigorous ap-
plause. ‘

Mr. Clancy said that the police had
helped frequently and would, but that in
many instances an ofﬁcer could not leave
his beat in the outsuirts to take aman
down town for driving a lame horse.
Whereupon Mr. Ryder said that the new
electric alarm would in part obviate such
difﬁculties.

Mr. ’l‘ruesdell said that the old society
had accomplished a good deal of work in
a, few months and that its paid ofﬁcer was
able to report that cruelty had been pmc-
tic-ally done away with in the city, but
after the active work had beenstopped
naturally some of the cruelty had rc-
vived. Still. he said, the city is far better
in that respect than it once was,

The report of H. K. \Vhite, treasurer,
showed that $352 had been received and
$356.93 expended for agents, for printing,
and for legal services, leaving a balance (,f
$5.07, but that other expenses had arisen
and been met.

Mr. Curran wished to complain of the
People's railroad and said that at the
southean part of the city a car containing
about 150 people was drawn by a verv
small team of horses and that at a grade
lhc peOplc ﬁnally had to get out in order
that the horses should not be abused fur-
ther.

A RURAL mgr; *

,l‘lney Acquit a. Man Who Maliciously
Shot a. Dog.

Juries have frequently. convicted men of
crimes when, in many instances, there was
_considerable doubt in the minds of others as
, to the guilt of the accused. But there Is no
excuse whatever for any jury rendering a ver-

 

 

dict in direct opposition to the evidence put
forth, especially when the evidence is corrob- »
‘ orative. notwithstanding, this is exactly 3
what a rural jury did in a case before Justice l
baring at .Coney Island last Wednesday night. l
1 Philip lee, of Woodlawn, G‘ravesend, owns i
the property known as Koemg’sEark, on which ‘
the Coney Island Gun Club hold their pigeon l
shoots. 0 11 Thanksgiving afternoon the mem- :
bers of the club met to compete in pigeon 7
shooting. Among the spectators was Frederick
Eerzing‘er, who came there from Coney Island,
where he resides. He brought with him a val-
uable setter dog and a gun, and when the
birds happened to ﬂy outside the boundaries
before being shot by any of the members of
the club he took a hand in with the rest of the
spectators in bringing the game to grief.
\i’hen Libe discovered young Eerzingel' 011
the grounds, for some reason not explained he
ordered him oil’, and because he did not move
quick enough to suit him Libe called upon 1115
, son Charles, who happened to be lookmg 011,
l and they began a vigorous assaultupon the
1 young man. Young Libe struck him on the
l head with a club while the elder lube held

Much enthusiasm was shown at the~

‘ meeting of the Society fer the Prevention
' of Cruelty to Animals at the rooms of the
Business Men’s association last night. , In
I the absence of the president,-the Rev. Dr.
f George B. Spalding, err-Mayer Daniel J.
I Bookstaver presided. Among those pres—
! out were J. H. Gay and F. S. Snowden of
lthc parent society at New York, E. A.
Powell, Police Commissioner P. S. Ryder,

J. L. Bagg, H. K White, nr. Bates, w. ‘

l

l

lV. Truesdell, C. B. Freeman, Christian
lCook, C. A. Hamlin, G. P. Curran and
7 Edward Owen. ' ‘

Mr. Bookstaver said that the object of
the meeting was to put the: society once-
more on a. good working basis. The po-l
lice are, under the law, friends of “such I
movements,and Police Justice Mulholland
had done much to deserve the praise of
the society. The chairman called upon.
W. F. Seward, who said: “It concerns us
this evening, instead of talking'over what
we have not done and bewailing our short-.
comings, to consider what we will do to
further the Work of the society. There is
plenty of, humane sentiment-in this city to
go ahead with this movement. It has be-
come almost a weekly occurrence to ﬁnd.
cases of children who, though voung in
years, are old in cruelty. N 0 one needs to"
be told that youth growing up in disre-
gard of the rights of animals are also de-
fiant of law and the rights of their fellows,"
and our duty as citizens is to put "this
society on such a basis that it will be an
aid to moral education and a bulwark or
humanity. What we. should ' 'do
Is to create such a moral
sentiment that men will be ashamed to
treat a dumb animal wrongly.” Mr. Sewn
ard suggested that each man do missiOna—
ry work in securing new members, that "a
special agent be appointed to look after
the interests of the society and that a pub-
lic meeting be called soon to arouse public
interest in the work. ‘

Dr. C. F. ”Wright cited an instance of a
herse which fell while drawing a heavy
load out of an excavation which was be-
ing dug in Mulberry street. A rope was
tied about the horse’s neck and the animal
was dragged out. ‘

J. H. Gay of New York was asked to
speak. He said: “There is an element. in
every comnumity that needs the discipline
A. paid ofﬁcer cannot always
Any citizen has a
right to make an arrest when the act falls
under his observation. Much good can
often be done, however, without resorting
to an arrest or dragging the offender into
court, Personal remonstrance is often
all that is needful. We ﬁnd in New
York that while the police will not
take the initiative in the work
when appealed to, they are always
willing to assist. Syracuse ought to have
also a horse ambulance.” Mr. Gay spoke
in high terms of Police Justice Muihol-
land’seﬁ’orts in their behalf during their
stav in this city. H. K. \Vhite reported
that up to January lst, 1889, $159 was re-
ceived in membership fees, :35le in sub»
scriptions and thirty—ﬁye dollars in ﬁnes.
The expenditures were $6346.93. '

G. P. Curran said that last winter he
had called a policeman’s attention to a
horse that had stood for some time in lVar-
ren street and was thoroughly chilled.
The ho rse was taken to a stable and fed and
the owner was compelled to pay the cost
before he could get his animal. At an-
other time a. horse WhICh he found stand-~
ing in East l'v'ashmgton street was trearcd
in the same manner: Mr. Curran said
that the P60131975 Raliway company do
served to be censured for compelling two,
horses to draw a. car contialmng too many

Mrs. Elizabeth T. Hicks, one of the best known
and respected women of Queens County, died at
the residence of her son, Benjamin D. Hicks. at
Westbury, on Sunday evening, in her 87th year.
The deceased, although born in the City of New
York, spent most of her childhood and all of her
later years on Long Island. Her father, White-
head Hicks, was a substantial Quaker merchant
and real estate owner in the old Seventh Ward of
New York City, and was descended from the \
original Hicks stock of Long Island. Mrs. Hicks
had a large circle of relatives and personal friends
by whom she was greatly beloved because of her
genial disposition and many noble traits of char-
acter, butshe was best known to the old residents
of Queens County through her life long connec-.
tion with public and charitable undertakings.
with many of which she was identiﬁed
even during her declining years. maintaining
her interest and activity to the last. She was a.
life member of the Queens County Agricultural
Society, and when it established itself in a. perma.

About a month ago the women‘s branch of
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, of which Mrs. Richard P. White, 01’
this city, is president, received information
that the Radnor Hunt, a club composed of
rich and i‘hshionable Philadelphians and-
wealthy Montgomery county farmers were

guilty of cruelty to a fox which they
had used at a hunt held on the 23d

of last November. The informant went on to
state that the for had been held in conﬁne-
ment for several months before the meet,
and had been partially domesticated, so that
when it was liberated it refused to run, and
was kicked and beaten by the servants of the
club.

The society immediately made an investi-
gation and found that a bagged fox had been
used, and they decided to prosecute the club
on the ground that a tame animal had been
chased by the hounds and killed with unwar-
rantable cruelty.

H. E. Currier, agent for the society, swore
out warrants on the 213th of last December for
the arrest of John Delaney and John Mat-
thews, two men in the employ of the club,
who, he alleged, had been seen with the
bagged fox, and had kicked and beaten it
when they liberated it at the meet.

BEFORE THE ‘sQUIRE.

They were arrested and had a hearing at
half-past 10 yesterday before. ’Squire J. Owen
Yetter, of Ardmore. The interest in the affair
was so great that the ’Squircfs ofﬁce was not
large enough to hold the crowd of people who
came to the hearing), so the proceedings were
held in the Odd Fellows‘ Hall. James B» Hol-
land,County Solicitor of Montgomery county,
appeared for the lladnor Hunt Club, and
Thomas Earle White. of this city, represented
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals. The ﬁrst witness produced by the
society was Mrs. Sarah McGowan, a servant

 

 

in the employ of Andrew Wheeler, whose.
i grounds adjoin the lawn of Charles Wheeler, ’
upon whose lawn the meet was held. She
testiﬁed that she had seen Delaney on the
morning of Novembe 23 with a bag: across
his shoulders.

A CONTRARY FOX.

There seemed to be somethingalive in the 1
bag, although she could not say what it was.
She afterward saw Delaney on Charles
Wheeler’s lawn with the fox beside him. He
7 tried to drive it away. but it would not move.

lie chased it again, but it only went a short
distance. He drove it across the lawn a third

time, then it ran away and she afterward saw
the hounds chasm}: 1T»

Henry McGowan, Andrew Wheeler's gap-
donor, was also examined, but his evidence
was unimportanr- William DeV'cre and John
McClellcn. both residing: in the Vicinity, were
also subptenaed to appear at the hearing, but
thcv were not called.

Mr. Holland. in his defense of the club‘s ac-
tion, said that there was not sufﬁcient evi-
dence to convict the men, as the society could
not prove the killing of the fox. but had only
seen it in the bag and when let loose upon
the lawn.

KILLING NOXIOUS ANIMALS.

"But.” continued Mr. Holland with fervor,
“even assuming that the fox was killed, there
is no case before you. It IS useless for me to
ﬁre off a lot of rcxnarks'or to use arguments
about such an absurd thing all around."

Then Mrnllolland Cited :1 case where a dog-
wag put into a pit of tame ranhxts and was al-
lowed to kin them, and it had been decrded
that this was not cruelty. because the rabbit

tgu'té books it is declared a noxious animal out-
laidé of theprotection of the law and the Com-
Cmission'ers of every county were authorized
to pay a premium of $1 for every one killed.

' “ Some people,” said Lawyer Holland, “ have

a nOtiOh‘lthat they ought, to I’Bf‘orm the world.“

They have dyspepsia in their religion or their
morality or something.”
THE DEFENSE SURPRISED.
Mr. White said that it was not necessary to
"prove the death of the animal, as it was
proved that he had been killed at the hunt.
He went on to say that the“ law authorized a
man to kill any animal which he owned, but
it restricted him to killing; it with as little
torture as possible. The fact that the fox had
been chased by bounds and killed in a cruel
manner was sufﬁcient to convict the men.

He cited a case decided by the Supreme
Court of Massachusetts in 1888, given in the
Fourteenth N. E. Reports, in which it was

; held that the act of putting a tame fox to
lﬂieht and letting; hounds loose to chase it '
{constituted an act of cruelty to an animal
l contrary to law.

l The citation of this case was an unexpected
blow to the opposing side, 'Who took the re-
port of the case and studied it with an air of
surprise. .

After Mr. White’s argument the Justice of
the Peace imposed a ﬁne of $20 on each of'the- '
defendants and costs. '

A formal appeal was taken from the deci-V ;'
sion imposing aﬁne and security was entered
for appearance at the March term of the
Montgomery county Quarter Sessions at
Norristown. ,

SURPRISED AT THE DECISION. "

Charles Mather, the master of the hounds
of the club, expressed great surprise at the
decision. “Why, they are only servants,” he
said; f‘they ought not to be punished as
severely as that.”

Laterin the afternoon Mr. Mather Was at
his business ofﬁce, 281 Walnut street, and
spoke very freely about the affair. “We
shall certainly take the case into the courts,”
he said, “because the whole prosecution is
unwarranted. I can very easily explain the .
whole matter. There are certain residents
of A'rdmore who are always worrying: them-
selves about other people‘s affairs. I have a
letter in my possession in which one of these
persons complains because the bounds ran
across a corner of her lawn.

“Sheis certainly the lady ivho instigated
this attack, because she is a member of the
wonien’s branch of the Society for the Preven-
tion of Cruelty to Animals. There are a few
of these people who are continually giving
, us trouble. The greater part of the residents
in the Vicinity are in favor of our hunts.
Many of the farmers are members of the club
and fox hunting has been one of the great
institutions of the county for the past 200

3 years.

TRAINING YOUNG HOUNDS.

“The Radnor Hunt Club~ does not use the
bagged fox as a usual thing. We had some
young; hounds that can only be trained to the
-. trail by setting them on the trail of a tame
l animal, and we used a bagged fox on this oc-
tcasion to break them in. We have enough
’ foxes in the country we hunt in to make it
, unnecessary to get a tamed animal.:"

Special Agent Casey of the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
went to “fest Monroe, near Parish, Users
20 county, yesterday and straightened
out a case of cruelty.
Benjamin Parks, who lives on a forty-
acre farm at West Monroe, four and a
half miles from Parish, sheared his flock
of forty-eight sheep, including some lambs,
about a week ago, and some of his neigh-
bors thought that mid—winter was
“not just the time to shear sheep when
a man has no warm barn to keep
1 them and talked of swearing out a war-
rant; for the arrest of Mr. Parks on the
charge of cruelty to animals. The case
Ewas reported to the Syracuse society on
PFLiday afternoon and Special Agent
Casey went to the farm yesterday. He
found the sheep in a cellar under the
barn, but their coats were gone; they

cial Agent Casey reports that the
cellar is well under ground and
that the walls are banked with earth on
the outside and that the sheep did not
seem to be suffering from the cold yester-

 

? day, which was a. warm day. The cellar
iris warmer than the barn itself, and there
" “is no really suitable place anywhere in the

day’s TIMES.

‘ F John P. Hollies, President of the American .So-

ciety for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in this
city. was shown THE Tisiss’s dispatch yesterday
afternoon and expressed satisfaction with the de-
claim. It was, he said, a well-known case, This

decision of Judges Yerkes was but the afﬁrma-
tion of the verdict in the lower courts, which
found Lewis and others guilty and imposed a
fine of $20 each. Mr. Haines said he was glad
the decision had been rendered, and expressed
the opinion that it would breakup the practice '
0i" shooting: piseons from traps in Pennsylva-
nia. There was no doubt about the cruelty
of the sport. and he thought DUWO Sentiment
would sustain the prohibition of it. He hoped
the day was not for distant when pigeon shoot-
ing from traps might also be broken up in this
State. At present there. was a clause in the
New-York law which permitted incorporated
clubs to shoot pigeons. It was as follows:

“ None of the provisions of law heretofore enacted
my the prevention of cruelty to animals within
this State shall be construed to prohibit or intern -
fore with shooting by members of sportsmen’s
clubs opincorporated societies oi‘ pigeon shooters; ’
provided. that in each case. as soon as they can be
Captured or taken after being shot, such pigeons,
if living, shall immediately be killed.”

Mr. Haines said he did not believe such a law
could now be passed in the New-York Legis~
lampe, and he hoped for its repeal at no distant
day though at present no efforts were being
made to that end. . The cruelty of the sport had
Cfllllﬂ to be rgcgg‘nlzed, and Plghli-Eﬂll’lklng men.

Annual Meeting of the Women’s Branol I.
0f the Pennsylvania Society.

The twenty-ﬁrst annual meeting or “1‘
Women’s Branch of the Pennsylvania 50*
016W for the Prevention of Cruelty to An!-
mals was held yesterday at 1706 Chestnut
street, the President, Mrs. Richard .P°
White, presiding. . .

According to the report for the year, 683 ‘
complaints were investigated. Of this num-
ber Prosecution was made in 198 cases, and
5231 were remedied without prosecution,
Horses and mules suspended from labor,
1127; warnings given to thoughtless persons,
3197; horses relieved of overchecking, 109!
pads provided to protect sores, 722; fallen
and sick horses and mules assisted, 78; dis-
abled and sick horses and mules killed, 148. .

The report of the City Pound and Dog
Shelter showed that 4722 dogs had been re-
ceived; killed at Found, 3900; killed Within ‘
the city and suburbs, 1495, making atotal 01
5399 dogs killed by the society. Dogs 1‘6—
deemed, 696. Amount paid to the city for
the redemption of dogs was $1412.

Referring to a special fund which is beinq I
raised, the report says: “At the annua
meeting of the American Humane Associa-'
tion, rwhich was held last September in,
Louisville, Kentucky, it was decldedthai ‘
' it was very desirable to have an agent em-
ployed who should travel over the country
in order to see to the condition of the cattle
in transit, and, if possible, to alleviate their
sufferings. There being only sufﬁcient
money in the treasury for the running ex-
penses of the association, it was evident
that it would be necessary to raise a separate
fund for the salary and expenses oi’thii
agent. Your President, Mrs. Richard P.
White, undertook the charge of raising
this fund. So far $425 has" been collected,
which is not sufﬁcient to allow the agent to
accomplish any work of‘ importance. We
hope that others who are interested in thin
endeavor to accomplish some improvement
in the condition of the cattle that are
brought here from the West, and whose suf-
ferings are in many instances terrible, will 5
and us by Contributing somethingtothis
fund. N 0 one who has not looked into the
matter can imagine what tortures these
creatures undergo from crowding into close
cars, from conﬁnement, hunger and thirst.
From these alone they suffer mere, perhaps,
than from any other cause during the hot
summer weather. 7 ’

The fountain which was suggested last
year, to be erected in memory of Henry
Bergh, has been begun, and it is proposed
to place it at the intersection of Lancaster
avenue and Thirty-second street, where
there is large travel, and where it will be oi
beneﬁt to a great number of horses.

The ﬁnancial reports presented were as
follows: Permanent Fund, receipts, $30,-
367 34; expenditures, $800. Copia Fund,
balance from previous year, $250 25, from
which $170 was paid out in rewards.. Gen-
eral Fund, receipts, $4693; expenditures,
$4802. .

, PROTECTING THE ANIMALS.

1
WHAT MR. BEBGH’S SOCIETY HAS Donn-g
IN THE LAST YEAR. ' ~

The American Society for the Prevention-
ot Cruelty to Animals has placed in the hands 2
. of the printer its twenty—fourth annual report.

' President John P. Haines in his statement
dwells with satisfaction upon the perfection in
detail of the society’s work in New—York andI,
Brooklyn; the improvement in its oiiicial resii»
deuce, the perfection of the ambulance system.
and the erection of a hospital and ambulance

house. He regrets, however, that the workiu
the upper art of the State is not as thorough
as it shoul be, and says: .
“ 1 was greatly exer iscd at the condition of the
horses and mules emu oyed on the towpatns 01' the
several canals of the State. Aggressive measures
should be instituted during the entire season. or-
ﬂoors should be stationed along and thoroughly .

police the canal districts."

The report of Superintendent Charles H.
Hanuinson says that the horse-car and other 1
stables have been regularly visited. While 1
many horses were condemned as unfit for serve; ,
ice on railroads, the great majority Were found .
to be in excellent condition. Many stables ,
should be condemned on the ground of public -'
health, however. and the society should at- ,
tempt to do away with the numerous stables
built in the rear of tenements. Much work has
been done in the rural districts to prevent the
: overcrowding of domestic animals in unﬁt
barns and the feeding of them on swili.

Dog ﬁghting and cook ﬁghting. . says the re-
port, have greatly decreased, yet raids have,
been made resulting in tire arrest, conviction,
and punishment of ovcr'one hundred persons
engaged in or assisting in these brutal sports.
Regarding the business of exporting live stock,
the absence of the old-time clubs and steel-
pointcd prods in the hands of the drovcre isIau
evidence of what has been done. The quality
and uantity ol‘ food. and water provided for
the goal: during the voyage is therougllly ex-
amined, and everything is insisted upon which
will add to the comfort of the animals while in ‘

 

 

vessel gets outside of the jurisdiction of the ,
State the poor creatures are subjected to neg-
.lect and abuse. .

‘ hat the report says of Perry Belmont’s rah-I.
bit-baiting matinées on Long island will be in- r
- terestinlz to the people who attended them. It
says in part:

“I, with six of the society’s oﬂicers. went to
Hicksville, Queens County. L. L, on Dec. 7 last,
and there arrested two of the principals en-
gaged in the socalled sport of rabbitbaiting. ’l‘o
enumerate all the cruel details incidental to the
chasing and killing of ‘rabbits by dogs in an in-
closed field would doubtless shock the sensibilities
of all right-thinking people. it will sudlce to state
that the rabbits are captured and brought from
some Western State to a Long Island farm, and
there kept in bondage until it pleases the members
of the club, to Whom the animals are sold, to drive
them out one at a timeinto the ﬁeld described,
Euler; they are chased by dogs until caught and .

er . , .

“This manly (ll pastime was criticised by a farm-

’ er’s daughter who was present at the last baitIIin
the following outspoken language: ‘They (alluding
to the clubmen) call themselves men! Points to
see them all spankedl’ The prisoners were,“-
raigned before the local magistrate and char ed,
with violating certain provisions of Section 65 I of
the Penal Code, via: ‘instigating and furthering
acts oi cruelty to animals.’ The Jury remainedout
sonic time, but ﬁnally rendered averdict olf'not
gui ty. .
» “Elated by the verdict, another belt was in-
dulged in by the same club and at the same place.
The slipper of the dogs was promptly arrested by
the society’s officer. who, to the surprise oi 1311053
present, suddenly put in an appearance on the ﬁeld.
The prisoner likewme demanded atrial by jury,
and was acquitted. Representative citizens of Long
Island, howeVer, condemn the foreign innovation
under the name of coursing, and characterize it as
a brutal pastime.” ,

PROTECTION T0 ANiMALS.

The Report of the Society for the Preven-
tion of Cruelty Shows Some
Good Results.

The past year has been an interesting one in
the history of the American Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The re-
port of President Halnes refers to the necessity
for uiuproved methods rml'taining to the alnbu- -
lance and derrick service. The Society has
erected a suitable building for the accommo-
dation of vehicles. Kennels for the care and

E comiln't of all kinds of small animals have
' been provided in. the building, likewise an
apartllleilt for the humane :tlestruction of those
to an}. sick, injured or otherwise disabled ;

’l‘he patrol wagon service has also been 0X-..

tended and improved. . . 7. '

Snperinten-zlcnt lianklnson’s report, in
speaking of his oilimai inspection of city“
stables, says: .

There are many somalied stables, however, .1
in the city, which ought to be condemned, .
not only from a saniiary point of Mew,
but for the absence of proper and adequate

‘ means of escape in case of fire. it should not be ,
J allowed testable horses in wondeli building‘s,’
built in the rear of tenements, the, entrance to
_ which from the street is through a narrow pas-
sageway. There are many subterranean stables
in the city in which from five to tWeuty horses
, are lodged, and are only kept in proper condi-
' tion by reason of the constant surveillance exer-
cised over them by our oi’iicers. , .

The Superintendent’s account of the raid on
rabbit coursing at Bicksvrlic, L. L, l'eads‘as
follows: ’ . .

To enumerate all the cruel details incidental ‘
to the chasing and killing of rabbits by dogs in
an inclosed ﬁeld would doubtless shock the.
scus:bliitles of all right—thinking people. It will
suiiice to state that the rabbits are captured and
brought from a ii’esteru State in a Long island
‘ farm. and there kept in bondage until it pleases
the. members of the club. to Whom the animals
are sold, to drive them out one at a time into
the ﬁeld described, Where they are chased by
dogs until caught and killed.

This manly If?) pastime was criticised by a.
farmer’s daughter who was present at the last
bait in the following outspoken language: .
"They (alluding to the ciubmcn) call themselves ;
melli Pd. like to see them all spanked!” ,

Elaled by previuus verdicts. another bait was r
indulged in by the same club and at the saline ..
place. The slipper of the dogs was promptiv
arrested by the Society’s ofﬁcer, who. to the sur-
prise of those present, suddenly put in an ap-
pearance on‘ the field. The prisoner likewise
demanded a trial by jury. and was acquitted.
Representative citizens of Long island, how:
eVer, condemn the foreign innovation under the
name of coursing, and characterize it as * a
brutal pastime. .

Superintendent Hankinson compliments the
management of the Brooklyn branch of the
Society. The aggregate result of the year is;

Cases prosecuted in the court‘s ................ 949

Two of the important convictions secured
during the year were: liavid Feiton, for lock
lug the wings. of poultry and throwing the
animals in a. violent manner to the store ﬂoor.
This offense took place in the building des—
troyed by the Board of Health for the purpose
of killing poultry. The other case was that
of John Ennis for biting off the ear of 'a dog.
He was sentenced to the penitentiary for one
yearaud to pay a ﬁne of 35500.

NlNTH ANNUAL MEETING OF THE
S. P. C. A.

 

The Work During the Past Year Has
Been Extended-The Ephere of Action
to be Enlarged-The Cases Handled~

Report of the Executive—Election of

ofﬁcers.

The ninth annual meeting of the Society

for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was
held yesterday afternoon in the 1 . M. (J. A.
lecture hall, the president, Mr. John Soars,
in the chair.
The secretary, Mr. Edwin J. Wetmore,
submitted his report which stated that during
the past year 491 cases had been investigat.
ed. The chief object of the society being the
. prevention of cruelty, the secretary hadnot
thought it advisable to press charges against
parties when they showed willingness to be
more merciful. ,

Out of the cases investigated 140 had been
outside of the city limits. A great improve-
ment had been made in the mode of shippm g
geese to the United States. .

The report returned thanks to the hew
Brunswick, Shore Line, and St. John City :

railways for passes to Dr. Frink, and to the L
police for their valuable assistance. It was 1
suggested that the society frame an act for y
the protection of human beings and have the .
,same put before the legislature, as such an

“act is greatly needed in this province. There

is a similar act in Nova Scotia which has

had a good effect.

Following is a statement of work of the
society for the year ending February 17:—«

many years a resxdent of St.John and always
manifested a lively interest in the societ

regard and respect for his memory. g

The executive committee are most desirous
that, as a provincial institution, incorporated
by the legislature, its usefulness should be
extended by the formation of agencies or
committees in every town and village
throughout the province. In order to do
this we would respectfully ask the sympathy,
and aid of ministers, magistrates, Sunda
and day school teachers, and every one whii
feels the importance of our work, to use their'
endeavor to prevent
the cruel treatment of animals, that
they shall not be overworked
abused or unnecessarily exposed to storms by

otherwiseuncared for.

Through the efforts of bands of mercy the
rising generation is taught that when an
animal is hungry it should have food and
when thirsty, drink, and thereby have this
oversight and duty extended to beastand
bird and fowl,remembering that Our Heaven-
ly Father is the Creator of every living thing,
that every one of them on the earth
in the air and sea came into being
for His allwise purposes, remembering
that prominent scripture text, “Not a. spar.
row falleth to the ground without our
Heavenly Father’s knowledge.”

Public fountains are one of the greatest
blessings that acity can have erected. As

    

an example of this we need only refer .to the I

one erected in the Market Square in 1882‘ by
the late Wm. M. Sears, and presented by

 

him to our society, of which, previous to his
decease, he was an active and earnest mem-
ber and contributor. ’It stands as a menu-
ment of the great love for animals which
was one of his prominent characteristics. It
is hoped that before a great length
of time other fountains or drinking vessels
will be placed in other parts of the city,
where they are so muchzneeded for thirsty
animals. If each individual whose animal
drinks at the fountain in the Market Square

, In the report of the work done by 13110

‘5 New York Society for the Prevention
0f CTUBltY to Animals the aggregate
result for the year 1889 is as follows:
Cit-898 Drosecuted in the courts, 949; (115'
abled animals temporarily suspended
from work, 2357; horses, disabled past

, recovery, humanely destroyed, 2819 3

§ small animals, disabled past recovery,

l humanely destroyed, 705; disabled

, horses removed from the streets in the .

‘ambulances, 407’; complaints received l

’ and investigated, 2793. ‘ ’

Among the numerous cases resulting
in coiiVictions the following may give
an idea of the brutality of which that ‘
noble animal, man, is capable. They ;
also show the necessity for societies not
only to punish cruelty but to prevent
it by teaching kindness and mercy:

Chas. Schyole, cutting a cat’s ears

; with a knife simply because the animal

went into a rear shop where the defend-

ant was engaged cutting up meat, he

j being a butcher. He did not deny the 1

‘ act, saying: “I only done it for fun!” i
Fined $10 by court of special sessions. '

, Theo. Horstmann, throwing poisoned

meat into his next door neighbor’s .

iyard, which was eaten by two dogs,

;causing their death. The reason as-

I signed for poisoning the animals was ,

‘that they were annoying. The dogs

.I were small Skye terriers and never an- .

l noyed any one. Fined $100 by court of

{ special sessions. .. . '

l John Devlin, beating'a horse With an

IlI‘OIl car hook. » The defendant was a

f driver on the belt road, and while on

‘ his up trip the horse got one of his fore-

1 feet outside of the trace chain. Devlin,

iinstead of getting off the car and ad- .
justing the trace. attempted to do so

from the car, which he failed to do.

Finally, becoming angry, he ot down
and struck the animal severa savage
blows with his car hook, cutting the
ﬂesh and laming the horse. Fined $25 .
by court of special sessions. ’

Henry Mulz, Brooklyn, biting off the
heads of two live kittens, simply to
win a wager of a quart of beer, into
which he put the decapitated heads of
the animals and then drank the liquid.
The magistrate, when sentencing the
brutal offender, characterized the crime
as one of the most atrocious cases of

crulelty he hadever known. Sentenced .
1 to one year in the penitentiary by Judge
3 Goctting.

. Philomena Venteer, striking horse on '
the face with an ax. The wound in-
ﬂicted was only slight, but the offense
was entirely unprovoked, seemingly
committed out of pure deviltry. Fined
$5 by court of special sessions.

Alfred \Vood, carrying live poultry by
the legs, with thehead hangiiigldown.
It is a practice indulged in by peddlers,
but owing to the vigilance or our offi-
cers is of very rare occurrence. Fined '
$10 by court of special sessions.

has. H. Freeman, “7111. Ketcham,
John Whalen and \Vini Kocnnecker, for
beating and ovei'driving a horse to
death. This horse was attached to a ,
truck, and the oifenders beat and drove
the animal so hard on the Coney island

‘ road that the horse ﬁnally dropped

‘dead. Fined $10, $620, $30 and $40, re~

spectively, by Judge Waring.

John Ennis, for biting the car off a
dog! The animal, a ﬁne St. Bernard,
the pet and playfellow of the children
and yeneral favorite, was sleeping on
the ioor of his master’s saloon, when
Ennis, in a half-drunkencondition, en-
tered.’ Accustomed to being potted and
stroked by the patrons of the lace, the
dog remained still when nnis ap-
proached and stooped as if to pat; its
read; but instead of dOing so he seized
one of the ears in his teeth and berore
any one could interfere bit Iii-Olf. The ,
dog, instead of springing at his coward-
ly assailant, walked over to where his
master stood. At the sight Of his muti-
lated favorite the ﬁrst impulse was to
take the law into his own hands. W iser
, counsel prevailed, howeVeI‘,_ and the
case was reported to the society. ’lhe
l brutal offender was {omptly arrested.

He demanded trial y Jury, was .0011-

victed and sentenced to the peniten-
tiai‘y for one year and ’90 pay a fine 0f
$500, and to stand committed until the .
this shall be paid, by Judge Massey. l

PIGEGNSHGOTENG.

 

A Supervisor’s Committee Says It
Is Not Cruel.

 

Interesting Discussion Upon a Humane
Question—“ First Aid ” Instructions
to Be Given to the
Police Force.

 

The meeting of the Health and Police Com-

.mittee of tbeBoard of Supervisors was sched-

uled this morning for 10 o’clock, but it was long
after that hour that the members assembled and
got down to business. Ttose present were Super.
visors I’iisrer, Barry, Ellert and Becker. ,
The subject of granting a license for a pigeon.
shooting match at the Height-street Base-ball
Grounds at. live pigeons was taken up. Secre-
tary Hunter of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals, appeared to protest against
the proposed license. He stated that. there was
no doubt that the sport was cruel and demorallz- "
He had seen pigeon-shooting l
matches wherealarge proportion of the birds
were not killed, but managed to get away, ans
ﬁnally died of Starvation, owing to their wounded
condition. Children would see the match and
grow up brutal. If they were cruel to animals
when young they ' would grow up to be
cruel to their Wives and children in
alter years. If they wanted targets
they could use clay targets. The State law would
cover the case, and convictions could be had. He
was certain that Colonel Charles Sonntag would
not favor the match it he were not the agent of
the company Which was sending the Eastern
team out. A case had been tried in Pennsylva-
nia under a lawsimilar to that of California, and
the. persons taking part had been convicted. .
lilaSonntag, Who was present, was asked to
give his. ideas. and stated that he was a member
of the same humane society as Mr.
Hunter. There bad. never been a con‘
VlCllon in California for shooting live
pigeons from, traps. Such shooting took place
eyery year in different no: ions of California. The
Eastern team had desired to shoot at clay discs,
but the California shooters had desired live
birds. As far as the law or Pennsylvania entered

into “the case. he _oesired to say that
shooting at live pigeons was constantly
taking place in Pennsylvania, such

 

a match having been shot less than a week ago ,
in Philadelphia. There was no more cruelty» in 1
killing a pigeon by shooting it than by wringing
its neck. The searchers of both the California,
and Eastern teams were business and profes-
sional men, and represented the best interests g
or the community. More than that, they were ‘
all humane men ‘

Supervisor Ellert and Supervisor Barry dc-'
sired to know wsetner there was any more cru=
city in killing a bird by shooting than by keeping
it scoped up in the market for weeks and then
wringing its neck. Neither of their; thought
there was.

Mr. Hon ter said that there had been but one
trial in California and that was before Judge. Rix,
who, it was afterward round, was the President ,
ot a pigeon-shooting club. Judge Bl}: dismissed
the charge, but his decision was a fearful and .
wonderful one. Mr. Hunter said that no more
such cases would be tried before Judge Rix.
Beside the cruelty to the birds, there was danger
of some of the on-lookers being shot.

Mr. Sonntag denied this, saying all who would
take part were expert shots. «There would be no
danger to the spectators, and if a bird escaped
it would be uninjured. The pigeons shot were
afterward sold for food. ‘ _

Alexander Heyneman stated tnat the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals objected
to thematch also on account of its moral inﬂu-
ence. Such exhibitions only served to brutalize
those who saw them. .

After hearing all that had to be said pro and
con on the subject, the committee deemed to re-
port favorably on the application tor the permit,
Supervisor Becker voting in the negative. ‘

.The‘iHealth and Police Committee:
of the Board of Supervisors met this
morning, Chairman Pilster presiding;
present, also, Barry, Ellert and Becker.

The resolution granting permission
to Charles W. Dimick to hold a
pigeon shooting match at: Height- j
street Park was taken up for consider— ‘
ation. ' ~

Nathaniel Hunter of the Society for ‘ '
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals

half of the pigeons who are likely to
suffer if the resolution is passed. ~ He .
termed pigeon shooting “a brutalizing
and demoralizing sport.” He consid-
ered it: brutal, because many of? the
wounded pigeons escaped and died a
lingering death from starvation. It was 3
demoralizing because it familiarized
Children with brutality. He referred
to Charles Sonntag of the State Prison
Commission, who was present on be-
half of the petitioner. He, said that
Sonntag was a life member of the
Society for the Preve‘htion of Cruelty i
to Animals, and had. always been op— 9
posed to brutality iii any form, but he
Was now acting in his capacity of '
agent for the United States Cartridge."
Company, under whose auspices the.
shooting match was to take place for
advertising purposes. ' ‘
‘Mr. Sonntag blushed, and it was
apparent, even before he announced
the fact, that he did not expect to be
presented in that light by Mr. Hunter. ’
He, however, mustered 'up sufﬁcient.
temerity to argue that the sport was
neither “brutalizi'ng nor demOraliz-
ing.” He said that the very
best men in the country were in favor
of the sport. He did not consider
it any more brutal to shoot a pigeon 5
than to wring its neck. He said that
it was always impossible to secure the
conviction of a person in this State
charged with having shot pigeons. ,

Hunter explained that Judge Rix
dismissed persons charged with that '
offense because he was President of a
pigeon shooting club. Three States in
the Union had passed express laws
against pigeon shooting and, the
British Parliament had passed similar
laws.

Supervisor Barry asked Hunter if
he ever ate fowl. He replied that he
had. "

“Did you inquire as to how the ‘
fowl had been killed?” £

“No, sir.” .

Supervisor Ellert said: “I believe
that the society wants to go to ex-
tremes in this matter, and I therefore
move that the resolution be ﬁnally
passed.” ‘ .
’ Barry seconded the motion and it
was carried, Becker voting in the neg-
'ative.

Supervisor Barry presented a ‘co
munication from George A. Raa‘
requesting that provision be mad
bathing facilities for children a.
ing public schools for the sanit
vantage of the children. ,

Barry moved reference to thgiﬁoard

of Education, with a recomm ' datirn
that the Board request the ti’lﬂtees of
the James Lick trustkmanaging the
Free Public Baths, to devote Satur—
day of each week to the use of the
school children, aﬁ'ording them the
bathing facilities and instructions
necessary to learn to swim.
. It was decided to indorse the peti-
tion of the Democratic County Com-
mittee requesting the passage of an
order for the removal of Chinatown.

such risks. The loss of the Erin. which sailed
away from here four months ago and has never
been heard from since, is doubtless directly at-
tributable to the fact that she was incumbered
with a deck load of cattle, and was therefore
unmanagablc in rougl‘t weather.

LOU’HSG A. CATTLE STE-AMER.

To better illustrate the manner in which this
deck loading is done, a Panes reporter, accom-
panied by the Futures special artist, visited the '
Navarro. a tramp steamer, which was being
loaded in Brooklyn for Liverpool. She was
lying just above Hamilton Ferry, and had
already taken on a load of grain and oil cake, .
which. was stored in the lower hold to serve as ‘
ballast to: the load which she was to carry on
her decks. 3-. heavy snow storm was raging
as an old ferryboat from the Communipaw
stock yartjls steamed alongside of her and hen
gran to discharge its lead of cattle. The deck
ot‘ the ferryboat was a little lower than the
pier, and the poor beasts had to scramble and
struggle up the steep gangpiank to reach it.
Then they were driven down an equally steep
incline, some into the hold and some on to the
deck ol’ the l’avarro.

That part. of the ship known to the mariner
as " 7tween decks” was titted up quite com-
fortably with stalls and pens, each capable of

accominodating from six to ten bollocks. Bar- 1

ring the fact that in rough weather, with the
hate‘u-gs battened down, the place would soon
become worse than the famous “black hole of
Calcutta,” it looked as though the beasts
might be made entire comfortable. But it Was
the deck load that are used the especial interest
of the two l-‘nsss men. The entire deck of the
Navarro resen"-_bled at ﬁrst glance an immense
lumber shed. It was rooted over from stem to
stern and built. up on the sides above the rail

until a complete but rather frail looking struct-
ure had been added to her original lines, alter
ing them completely above the water mark.
Underneath this roof and running with the
ship’s lepgth were three rows of stalls or pens,
similar to those 'in cattle yards, each one hav—
ing a capacity of eicht head. These rows were
built one on each‘sioe and one directly through
the center of the ship. There was anarrow
aisle, not over three feet wide, between each
row.

The pens were all fuller, cath when the
deck load was on. Overhead rye/replied dozens
of bales of bay, adding materially to the height
of the superstructure and its resistance to the
wind. The artist got two or three good snap
shots with his cat'ncra, which show just hOW
the Navarro looked as she was ready for 863,
and the condition be}: deck was in when she did
actually go to sea the next morning.

Imagine, if. you can, the difﬁculties to be
overcome in handling avessel so incumbere
in a gale with the seas breaking over 1161'.
The reporter asked one f the, sailors what the
crew did in such a case. The sailor didn’t
know. He had never been to sea in sucha
ship before, and was only going this time be-
cause he Wanted to get. to his family in Livet‘v
'pool and cot‘llrm‘t {jg-ct passage on any other
ship. He said that ships like the Navarro
never had the same crew twice, the hardships'

Aside from the danger to life and property
and the cruelty to the animals themselves on-
tailed by this system of deck loading, it is said
that the effect upon the ship itself is detri-
mental in the extreme. The hull becomes
p’strainedg thc"'seams open. and after two or
three voyages under deck loads even iron
steamers have to go on the docks to be. over—
hauled. The inducement to carry them leeway
great, however, especially in the case Ol -ne

Were two powers engaged in the task-«the police

. and an agent from the Society for the Prevention

of Cruelty to Animals.
Ex-COroner T. C. Knox was the prime spirit.
The err-Coroner occupies the ground ﬂoor as a drug

store, and lets the upper part of the house. Jane
Duncan has rented the ﬂoor just over the store for
the past ﬁve years. Her husband died two weeks
ago, and since then the poor woman has developed
an extraordinary fondness for cats. She would
deny the visits of strangers who called to console her

in her bereavement, but she never shut the door,

on a stray or tramp cat.

Of late a foul odor emanated from the widow’s
apartments. and the neighbors complained to
the Doctor. Mrs. Duncan was spoken to but did
not seemfto heed the complaint- This ”decided the
ex-Coroner to take immediate action, and yesterday
morning was set down for the attack.

Dr. Knox called in a policeman and together they
entered Mrs. Duncan‘s apartments. There sat the

aged woman contentedly with ' several kittens on
her lap. Cats were lying.r in all postures about the
rooms, on the table, in the wardrobe and on

almost every conceivable soft spot about the place. ‘

The Doctor started countinguntil he tallied oﬁ’

twenty-three 'felines in all ages and stages—ord-iw

nary cats at that picked up from eyery quarter,
There was a. chair suspended against the wall half
way from the ceiling upon which reclined four
cats. A pillow placed on the rungs underneath con-
tained four more cats. A litter of young kittens
were stowed away in one corner of the room.

The woman who watched over all these pets with
a. mother’s care seemed dazed at the intruders. She
put on her hat and shawl and accompanied the
policeman without any protest.
doubt? as to the woman’s insanity, and the Justice
in the Jefferson Market .Police Court, turned her
over tothe Commissioners of Charities and Correc-
tionvfor examination. . _ -.

Meanwhile an oﬂicer from the Seeiety for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals arrived and
tackled the cats. He ﬁrst drowned the kittens and
then turned the-older ones loose into the back yard
in quest of other lodgings. Thacats scurried 011‘ in
different directions and paid visxts to strange yards

‘ that will disturb the quiet precincts of the Eighth

wa 'd for some ni hts to come. , _ '
Mrs. Duncan Wags supported by a. soc1ety to which

her husband belonged. She has no other means.

qualiﬁcations for a good lighten? After a while
the bull terrier. which is a croég between the
bulldog and the White English terrier. came
to be regarded as a. better dog for ﬁghting pur‘
poses. If the bull largely predominates. it is.
It is desirable for the bull blood to predom-
inate over that of the terrier in a dog that is
bred for pit purposes only. and dogs are bred
with this object in view. A good bull terrier
pos$esses all the pluck and pugnacity of the
bulldog. He is quicker and more active on his
, legs. which attributes are advantages of the
utmost importance in the pit. The well-known

 

1680' done so The advance of civilization
has caused the latter to be looked upon as a
most barbarous snort.

.It is an indisputable fact that a greater ‘
element of cruelty existed in bull baiting than
there probably did in almost any other kind of
sport. In olden times the baiting of buns with
dogs was as prominent a sport in England as
horse racing is to-day. ltenjoyed the patron-
age of all classes for many years. but more

recently. if in existence at all as a sport. it has
been conﬁned entirely to the lower classes,

Bulldogs were the kind. of dogs used to bait
bulls. According to the early writers on this
breed of dog. it is owing to his success in this
8p0rt that he owes his name. The early history .
of the bulldog is largely a matter of conjec- !
ture. as he is in most instances confused with
the mastiﬂ’. These breeds of dogs are Clt‘isely
allied to each other. Many traits in their char-
acters. and also a resemblance in‘Iform and
color in the old strains of mastitis. tend to
justify this belief.

The mastiff of the present day differs from I
the bulldog in that he is Consideral‘ilylarger. I
His breadth of muzzle is not so great. and the
head of the bulldog is larger in proportion to
his body than that of the mastif‘t‘. The hull-
dog’s forehead sinks between the eyes. and the
line of the nose rises at a considerable angle.
It is not infrequent that the lower jaw of the
bulldog protrudes beyond the upper so far as
to show the teeth. This, coupled with the
usual redness around the eyelids. gives the
dog a. most ferocious and forbidding aSpect.

two dogs differ materially. A bull terrier dis-
plays more judgment; for instance. if he has
a bad hold he will release it for a better one.
He will fight hard until he can get
a good one. The well-known iron
grip of a bulldog’sjaws seldom or never relaxes
when once his fangs sink into his victim. He
will try to increase that bold. but he invariably
confines his attention to the same spot. A bull
terrier thinks and acts more quickly, and al-
though he is not as indifferent to punish-
ment as a bulldog. he usually wins his ﬁght or
dies in the attempt. Bull terriers. like bull-
dogs. have an irresistible tendency to ﬁght all
dogs that come their way. On this account
they have lost many admirers. It is only fair
to say. however. that the bull terrier. like the .
bulldog. is to a great extent. in point of tem-

In bull baiting the dog‘s aim was to get hold

termed “pinning him.” Quit-k and active as

the enraged beast to shake them off counted

A number of gray—headed men, to whom a cock-

I court-room. _

Lawyer George F. Elliott appeared for the So-
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
The ﬁrst witness was a boy who said he‘liad seen

at Malley’s place. _

fact—«he had seen the cocks lighting.

Four oilicers of the society were placed on the .

i stand, one after another. Ellen told. with dra-

' ninth; fervor. of the raid on Malley‘s pit). The 5
. doors of the place were locked. Stout shoulders '

‘ sent- one door llyiiirr trout its hinges. In the bacK
‘-. room doors backed by half-ﬁlled barrels of coal
1 formed a square pit.

l In the pit one or the cocks—the red one—was
found “ game for a tight.” The other cool: was
perched on. a window. Malley andthe sporting
men llild escaped.

“ How did you catch Malley Cl" asked Mr. Elliott; :

of Otlicer Clark.

“ We caught him two blocks below. He was
running away and was without hat or coat.”

When the birds were brought in at the request
of Lawyer Elliott; the ofﬁcers identified them
without trouble.

On cross-examination. however. Roesch asked
each oiiicer if he had seen the birds fighting.

130th of the cooks scolded and seemed exceed—
ingly angry at these questions.

The otlicers were forced to admit that they had
not seen the birds actually at work.

The defence declined to produce any witnesses.
In summing up. Lawyer Roesoh said that his
client; was accused of fighting cocks. No evi-
dence that; such a. ﬁght had taken place had been
produced.

Here the game birds seemed anxious to get at

. the ex—Aldcrnian.

When Lawyer Elliott began his address to the
jury the birds clucked appealingly and eyed the
foreman of the body curiously.

“ Cock-ﬁzhting is a misdemeanor," said Mr.

I Elliott. Both birds oluckod an indorseluent of

l the statement. " This man Mlillcy is a cock-

I‘ listhter, and by your oaths you must convmr

THE CRUELTY LAW CONSTRUED AGAINST
A LAWYER—MARKSMAN.

 

A Member of the Fashionable Philadel-
Phia Gun Club Found Guilty by the

Bucks County Court.

 

 

In alengthy opinion, exhaustive on the
question of cruelty as it affects the shooting
of pigeons in shooting matches, President
Judge Harman Yerkes, in the Court of Quar-
ler Sessxons of Bucks county, yesterday,
found A. Nelson Lewis, a member of the
Philadelphia Gun Cinnaullny of a “0111““
of the act of Assembly of March 29th, 1839’

. which makes it a misdemeanor for any per-
son to H wantonly or cruelly ill-treat. OVGI‘r
load, beat or of herwise abuse any animal. ”

The prosecution was brought by the W0-.
man’s Branch of the Pennsylvania 3001er
for the Preventionof Cruelty to Animals In
December, 1887, under interesting circum-
ltances. A. midwinter meeting of the club
had been arranged to take place at Andalu-
sia, it is said, and the exercises were to in-
cludea pigeon shooting contest. The club
is an, exclusive organization, whose presz-
dent, at that time, was Mr. Clarence Moore,
son of Mrs. Bloomﬁeld H. Moore, and a
fashionable assemblage of Philadelphians
gathered to see the shooting. .

Agents of the Woman’s Branch also at-'
Itended and announced that they intended
to make arrests if the cruelty act was vio-
lated. “ The presence of these agents delayed
the sport for some time, it is said, where-
upon A. Nelson Lewis, the defendant, who
Is a lawyer by profession, volunteered to do
the shooting and, in the event of an arrest,
to makea test case of it. He shot at two,
birds that were liberated from a trap, and

for this was arrested.

Killed One and Wounded Another.
Subsequently Mr. Lewis was indicted

under the ﬁrst section of the act of 1869, and ,
a special verdict was returned by a jury in

the Court of Quarter Sessmns of Bucks.
county, ﬁnding the facts as follows:- “That

the defendant was a member of an associa-

tion called the Philadelphia Gun Club,

which association is accustomed to hold

pigeon shooting matches upon its grounds

at Andalusia, in Bucks county, State of,
Pennsylvania, for test of skill of mark-i
manship. That on the 4 14th day - of
December, 1887, the defendant attended 1
one of said pigeon shooting matches, and, l
for the purposes aforesaid, ﬁred,with a gun,

upon certain pigeons liberated from a trap, {
killing one and wounding another. The

bird so Wounded alighted upon a tree, and,

as soon as its wounded condition was dis-

cowered, it was killed by a member of said ‘
club for and on behalf of said defdndant,

according to the custom of said club in re-

gard to wounded birds. The birds so killed

were immediately sold for food, according to

the rule and custom of said club.”

The Opinion of the Court.

About two weeks ago the questions of law
involved by these facts were argued before
the Bucks County Court at Doylcstown by
Thomas Earle White, Esq., of this city,

ud District Attorney H. B. Eastburn on

ehalf of the Commonwealth, and by State

enator George Ross and L. L. James,Esq. ,
Ex-Attorney General Cas-
sidy had also been consulted in the case, by
the defendant, before his death. Judge
Yerkes, in his Opinion, seems to agree with
the prosecutors in almost every claim. He

H We are inclined, however, to the opinion
that all animals, whether noxious or not,
Which are in the dominion or custody of

against the rights of the animals that are,
in a sense, protected by it. The offence is
against the public morals, which the com-
mission of cruel and barbarous acts tends to
corrupt. (Com. vs. Turner, Supra).

“To make out the offence the Common-
wealth must show, first, that the pigeon

away, will not doubt that pain, suffering

hﬁn'lq‘he natural instinct either for freedom

which the defendant wounded, to con-

austion from the injury prevented. We
are clear that this result amounted to ill-
treatment and abuse in the meaning of the ‘
statute. We cannot undertake to measure
the degree of this pain and abuse.

or Was the act wanton or cruel? As ,I re-
gard the statute, the meaning of these two
words, as used in it, is substantially the
some. ,

‘ i A licentlous act by one towards another,
Without regard to his rights, or whatever is

Practicing to Make Soldiers.

Taking up the question whether there was
“adequate reason or necessity for submit-
mitting the pigeon to the pain and punish-
ment inﬂicted upon it, " the Judge says:

“According to the ﬁnding of the jury it ,

was, primarily, for test of skill in marks-
manship; secondarily, to prepare the bird
for sale for food.

“in favor of the ﬁrst, it is urged that this
exercise should be encouraged as tending to

promote strength and- courage, and to ,

render the citizens more efficient for those
services which he may be called upon to
render the State in time of war. (SeeState
of Missouri vs. Bogardus,4 Mo. App. , R215.)

“Conseding that those recreations which
serve as manly exercises and do not neces-
Berily lead to protracted pain should be en-
couraged to develop soldiery qualities, is
shooting pigeons from traps the recreation
calculated to best promote those'qualities?
Courage. endurance and steady marksman-
ship are amongst the most necessary. ac-
quirements of the good soldier.

. uIt would, be offensive to any citizen pos-
Bessed of a. spark of manhood to assert that
his courage had fallen to so low an ebb as to
require the exercise of shooting at helpless,
tame pigeons to qualify him to meet nice
in mortal combat, unless, indeed, he is
lacking in that brutlsh instinct which in-
clines men to shed blood, notwithstanding
the nobler impulse which impels mortals to
shrink from the infliction of pain. But we
have progressed too far in civilization to
now wish to develop the brutish instincts
of men that in time of war they may possi-
bly make better soldiers.

Sport Don’t \Varrant the Practice.

"Neither can it be said that shooting at.
birds, as they are liberated from a trap.
calls for such active exertion as would aug-
ment the citizens" capacity for endurance.
The open chase, rowing and gymnastics are
far better Calculated to develop muscular
action and strength. As for marksman-
ship, shooting at the clay pigeon or glass
balls is quite as good a means of testing
quickness of the eye in following moving
objects. The sportsman who would enter
the modern battlefield witlrtne expectation
that his agility in using a shotgun at short
range would be regardedof VNDE‘, WONQQQ
equally disappointed with the small boy.‘
with his popgun. - ' ' '

. l'l‘he army regulations do not provide for
tests oi marksmanship with shot guns, but
with the rifle and ball. All the States use
the riﬂe range and target practice with‘
ﬁxed ammunition, as the best adapted to
train men as soldiers. We are therefore
bound. to conclude, that test of skill at
marksmanship is not such a necessa?y or
Mlequate object as will compensate for the
lnﬂiction of pain, by wounding pigeons at
trap-shooting. _

HWe cannot agree that the demands of
fashionable sport warrant the-practice. 1n
Ford vs. Wiley, HawkinS. J -. said that

- while docking horses might- be justiﬁed, he
held a very strong opinion against allowing

any number of indlviduals, to aﬂ‘ord a justi-
ﬁcation for such. painful mutilation and
disfigurement. '

“\Vas it necessary to shoot or attempt to
Ihoot the birds to prepare them for food ‘2

“The learned counsel for the Common-
Wcalth admitted that the defendant is not
answerable for shooting the bird that. was
instannv killed, because. as the right to kill
existediand as no unnecessary or lingering
suffer-lug was inflicted, there was no cruelty
under the act. -

min the Bogardn‘s '"calsé‘ihfébarge was“
killing, not wounding, pigeons. Hayden,
J., carefully qualified his observations, and
confined his Judgment to a case of killing
outright, saying: iii) the present case there
was no mutilation or anything approach-
ing it. ’ -

4 ‘We presume it will be conceded there are
methods of killing captive fowls or birds,
known to every farmer and poultry raiser, ,
without subjecting them to lingering suffer-
ing or the chances thereof, and which will
make them more yaluable in the market for H

 

food, than by shooting. The mutilation
from the shot seriously affects their value as
00 . i
“We will now consider the question which "
the learned counsel for the Commenwealth
admitted to be the serious one in the case.
Bad Effects of Poor Shooting. h
“The defendant contends that as his de-
sign in ShOOting at the pigeon was undoubt-
edly to kill, and not to mutilate or merely
wound, the wounding, which caused the
pain, was not knowingly or wilfully com-
mitted, and, consequently, there was no
guilty intent.
“It is a maxim of the criminal law that

, one accused of an offence is presumed to in-

tend the natural and probable consequences ..
of his act. But this presumption is one of.
fact, and may be rebutted by the» circum-
stances of the ease. ‘

HA test of marksmanship implies a
probability and belief amongst the contest-
ants that all the birds will not be killed in-
stantaneously; otherWise there would be no
inequality in the contest, a thing hardlyto
be expected.

_HThe records of shooting matches as
published and commonly known establish
that a proportion of birds are not killed.
It is a matter of common notoriety that
some are killed, some wounded and others
escape altogether. ' '

‘ ‘These are the natural and probable con- '
sequences that may be expected fromrshoot-
ing birds as liberated from a trap. One who
tests his skill knows this; he may hope, and,
so far as lies in his ability and skill, he may
intend, that all shall instantly be killed; yet
as he knOWs the probable consequences
ﬂowing from this act, the law holds him
answerable for what becomes a careless or
reckless act. ' .

“An indifferent marksman might muti-
late a large proportion of the birds shot at,
and to say that because he wished or de-—
signed to kill them he should escape the .’
punishment for the cruelty arising from his '
gross want of skill, would» be illogical. ’ ’

The Purpose of the Law. 1‘

After citing very many cases to sustain
the different views of the Court the opinion
concludes as follows: ,

“The object of the statute against cruelty

 

 

.to animals is the suppression of an evil

which is oftener the result of indifference
or‘ carelessness than of wrongful intent.’
As we have said, the offence is against the
public morals, which the commission of
cruel and barbarous. acts tends to corrupt.
The act is in the nature of . a ,po-
lice regulation. And it has been i
said that under .police, health and, rev-
enue regulations, unless otherwise de-
clared in the act, the defendant is bound to
know the facts, and obey the law at his
peril. (Corn. vs. Raymond, 97 Mass, 569).
It was not intqued ,by the law-making
power that a gull y intention should concur
in the act. Otherwise, as was said by C. J.
Paxson, in Carlst-oxi’s case: ‘If such a
defence could be successfully interposed in
such cases, there would be few convictions,
and the law would be practically nulliﬁed
for all practicable purposes. ’ .

¢ ‘The words of the act of 1869 do not make
the design an element of the offence. The
‘word ‘cruelly’ is entirely descriptive of the
character of the offence, and as a thing may ,
be wantonly done, without any motive, the
word negatives the notion of any ﬁxed de-
sign or intention. ‘
HFrom these considerations we are of the
opinion that, upon the facts of the special
verdict, the defendant is guilty in manner
and form as he stands indicted.
“And now, to wit, January 27, 1390. the,
Court ﬁnd and adjudge, upon the special‘
ﬁnding of fact by the jury, that the defend-
ant, A. Nelson Lewis, is guilty in manner
and form as he stands indicted. By the

SHE ENJOYED CAT CALLS.

But Mrs. Duncan Refused Admission to All
Others.

 

 

“ Cats, cats, everywhere, but not a. mouse to
nibble.”

So remarked a philosophic policeman attached
to the Charles Street Station-house on opening
a. door on the second ﬂoor of No. 30 Beaford
street yesterday morning.

There were cats everywhere. They occupied
all the soft spots and corners of the room,
paraded up and down in disconsolate proces-
sions the middle of the ﬂoor, and half a. dozen or
them were conducting a premianightian soiree
on the backs of half a. dozen chairs, arranged in
a straight line on one side or the room.

 

There were yellow cats, gray cats, black cats,
white cats, brown cats. olct tom cats, frisky
kittens and cats of every color, age and variety.

This is the despatch Irom the Charles Street
Station House which caused some excitement at

Police Headquarters yesterday: T -

‘ vast amount of good work done by it dur-
ing the past year, but there are many
my- iz. v:hich:the positions: at its otti

might be inigﬁfiyed and their work render—
: ed easier for them.

‘ present no enviable one, as drivers Of
horses who may be arrested say at once
that the ofﬁcer only arrests them to
gain whatever percentage of the fine is
his due; thus making out that the ofﬁcer
isonly working for his own good and not
for the sake of protecting the animals.
The precentage of the ﬁnes, which is
their only pay, is not enough to keep good
men at the work. The percentage on
‘ tines should go to the society, and a steady
income, which the society could well af-
lord, be paid to its ofﬁcers, who should
also be put into a suitable uniform. Some ‘
iobjectiOns have been raised to unitorming .
the otticers on the ground that they would
be seen and avoided, l)th that objection is
groundless, for “prevention is better than
cure” at all times.

THEY RECOGNlZE THE HnMiLiATiNG BUSINESS
IN WHICH THEY ARE ENGAGED AND Soon
BECOME HARDENED CYNICS.

 

The high moral courage with which a dog
will cling to a master of low degree has been a
favorite theme for poets and philOSOphers from
time immemorial. The poetry and pathos
which surround this trait of a dog’s nature nas
led certain classes of people to trade upon it with
great proﬁt to themselves. This little story has
no reference to those dogs of the variety stage
who are made to go through certain undogly
evolutions to support their masters. These ‘
ki—yis are comparatively free from carking care,
having to play but six nights in the week, ex«
elusive of two matinees. They get plenty to
eat, have all day to themselves to think of
things, and, within the brief limits of their
chains, can occupy themselves just as they
please.

By far the most unhappy specimens of the
dog world are the beggar dogs. The rays of
sunlight in their lives are few and far between,

THE DOG AND HIS MASTER.

 

. and square meals are as uncertain as political

honesty these days. The most unhappy dog in
New York is a little black bow wow owned by
a beggar who haunts Si'xthavenue, between
Fourteenth and. Twentthhird ,- streets. This
particular mendicant seems to have no idea of
Where pathos ends or absurdity begins. He is
possessed of an ancient, croupy accordion, and
all day long he punishes the madding crowd
with the gray ghosts of dead andforgotten
melodies. “White Wings,” “Annie Laurie,”
“Sweet Violets” and . “Little Old Log Cabin in
the Lane” are hisfavorites. With a vague de-
sire to convey the general impression that the
dog is his only friend on earth, he holds the
wretched but heavy little mongrel on his right

ear a hundred asthmatic tunes that were never
before endured by canine kindred.

It is all very well for the dog when the air is
something faint and sad and his master is
playing low downsn the machine, but when
the melody becomes staccato and lively the
dog’s position ”becomes Yboth precarious and
painful, and it requires Some lively 'huStling. to
maintain his equilibrium. So well does the
dog know what is coming next that he can tell
to the fraction of a hair just when the instru—
ment will be‘ stretched- out a yard or more
and the grip that it will require to prevent
himself from taking a tumble or falling from

his owner’s arm to the ground. It is evidently
from a feeling of shame at his situation that
the wretched animal fails to recognize» others
of his species who may be passing. His heart
is broken, and his life is one long apology for

ties in London.

An ofﬁcer of the American Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, who was on
board while the vessel was loading, said:

. “The real trouble with most of the tramp
vessels begins when they get to sea. Usually
a lot of worthless fellows are engaged to look
after the cattle, who are willing to work their
passage in order to get back to England. '
Many of them have never seen a Western steer
before and know absolutely nothing of the care
of cattle. The consequence is that the cattle,
are neglected, for the men are too indolent to
care for them. Of course the captain rarely
interests himself, and the overseer of the at—
tendants has a constant light to .make them
perform their work and usually gives up the
job in disgust before the voyage is half over.
I have heard some shocking tales of cruelty to
these dumb animals. In case of a storm the
loss of life among them is simply terrific. The
only practical way of striking at this evn
5 seems to me to be the enactment of a law re-
quiringaddly authorized inspector on every
cattle vessel, to see that the cattle are properly
cared for.” _ ,. _-

Mayor Grant Asked to Re-
forlh Existing Methods.

OWNERS UP their PETS innit.

 

They Say that the Poundkeeper’s Assist-
ants Are Lawless and Brutal in Pur-

suit of Their Vocation, and Request

 

that the Work Be Placed in the Hands
of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals.

A petition signed by owners of valuable
dogs throughout the city has been presented
to Mayor Grant, asking that the power to
seize stray dogs be taken away from the
poundkeeper and his assistants, the dog-
catchers, and transferred to the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The
petition is the outcome of an alleged sys~
tematic series of abuses practiced by the dog
catchers for years. The chief objection to

, the dogcatchers is that they are not only in
: discriminating, but brutal in the extreme, and

that they will commit the grossest outrages
to make a capture. Stray curs without homes

the dogcatchers, for homeless dogs, with wits
sharpened and apprehensions aroused by
countless cruelties, seem to know a dog-
catcher’s wagon instinctively, and when it is
still blocks away they see it coming and make
their escape.

taken out of the very arms of children, and it

. ,ispo‘mncommon thing to see dogcatchers in-

vade yards and even houses to capture highly
prized family dogs that should be protected,
according to law, by the regularly issued
licenses obtained for them. The authorities
and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals receive numerous complaints,
especially in the Summer months, of the un-
warrantable manner in which valuable
animals are forcibly and illegally seized by
the dogcatchers, and the shameful way in
which the captured dogs are treated. Oper-
ating, as the dogcatchers do, under protection
of the law, it is almost impossible for any one
to rescue an animal from them when they
have once got- hold of. it. I
MANY VALUABLE DOGS STOLEN.

ter say that often they are unable to recover
their dogs at the pound on the payment of
the regular price, particularly if the animal is
more than ordinarily valuable. In such in~
stances the animals rarely ﬁnd their way into
the poundkeeper’s care. What becomes of
them can best be told by the dogcatchers, who
have, it is alleged, a regular out-of-town mar-
ket for ﬁne dogs. If complaint is made about
the matter at headquarters, the men vigorously
deny that they ever captured the animal in
question, and it is usually a. pretty hard mat-

ter to prove that they did. At times when
the snaring of the dog is shown beyond a
doubt, the fellows in charge of the cart band
together and swear that the dog escaped them
before they could land it in the pound.

‘.*It is high time that something was done to
stop this legalized robbery,” said one of the
signers of the petition yesterday. “Few
people have any idea of the outrages that these
men Commit under sanction of the municipal
laws. They steal, yes,absolutely steal,every year
hundreds of dogs, whose value runs up into the
thousands. BeSides, scores of men, women
and children, and particularly the latter, lose
animals to which they are Sincerely attached.
When the time comes I can present dozens of
cases where dogs were. snatched out of the
“arms of women and children who had taken
the animals up to protect them. the fellows
rarely try this sort oi thing on With men, for,
like most brutes, they are generally cowards.”

DRAGGED ruon A WEEPING CHILD’S ARMS.

Only last Week a reporter of THE STAR wit-
nessed an occurrence of this kind on the West
Side. A nurse in charge of two children was
walking along Seventy—second street toward
Central Park. Behind the children trotted
two handsome and well-bred 500ml] terriers.
Just as the little company reached Eighth av-
enue a dogcatclicr’s cart rattled along, and al-
most beim‘e either ' the nurse or the
children had any idea of danger two

burly brutes had jumped off the cart,
dud were running to grab the dogs.

Ere they could I‘L’Lil‘ll thcm,however, the nurse,
snatching up one of the dogs, scouted to the
children to catch the other, and started on a
run toward the house of her employers, near
Ninth avenue. She got inside all right,
and landed her dog in the hallway, but the
little girl who had taken up the other household
pet w as less brisk, and before she had run more
than twenty lent the dogcatchers caught her.
Tue little one begged piteously for her play-
fellow, but the only answer of the deg-
catchers was a rough laugh as they jerked the
struggling animal from its tearful guardian’s
arms and landed it in their wagon. A number
or indignant. Spectators tried the interfere,
but the i'uilianw simply sneered at them and
deluged one particularly zealous rescuer with
such a burst of profanity that other gentle-
men'were glad enough to refrain from saying
anything more.
THE SOCIETY WILLING. TO ACT.

A STAR reporter called at the rooms of the
Society for the Prevention of. Cruelty to
Animals, at Fourth avenue and Twenty-second
street, yesterday, and was informed by Mr. C.
H. Hanliinson, the Superintendent, that they
had as yet heard nothing oiﬁcially from the
petition. “We know that such a request has
been made,” said be, “but nothing more. The
matter rests Wit-ll the Mayor. ’l‘here is un—
doubtedly much evil in the present method of
dogcatcliing, but we are powerless to prevent
it. ill-any complaints are made to us of illegal
seizures of dogs, but we can only touch thém
when charges of cruelty are made. When we
investigate them we usually ﬁnd that the dog-
catcher has a loophole for escape, and,
although we have oiten caused dogs to be re-
turned to their owners, we can secure no con—
victi<.>ns. A case in point occurred a
short time ago, and the complainant was
Mr. Maitland of Filth avenue. He was
walking with his wife, and they had
two valuable dogs—a beautiful setter and a
fox terrier—out for exercise. The dogcatcher
appeared, and although Mr. Maitland managed
to rescue one, the other was caughtand driven
away. It was very cruelly treated. When we
tool; up the case the dogcatcher swore that he
had been bitten, and had to use Vigorous
measures. Under Section ’7 of the law topre-
vent hydrophobia the man was justified. Such
claims are always interposed whether the dog-
catcher is bitten or not. I presume the con-
stant occurrence of such cases has re-
sulted in this movement to give us control
of the dog-catching. Undoubtedly there
are many unjust and cruel seizures. It
has become almost impossible to take a dog
out for the exercise which it needs and should
have. People do not seem to understand that
an unlicensed dog can be captured at any time.
As a matter of fact, the law is in force all. the
year round, and those who value their pets
should always exercise them in leash. This
Society has not made any move itself to effect
the proposed change, but if the busmess is
turned over to us we shall do our best to pro-
tect everybody’s interest, and at the same time
observe the full letter of the law.”

THE PHI LAVTH ROPIC FIELD.

Annual Meeting .of the S. P. C. A.
Yesterday in This City.

The Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals held its seventeenth
annual meeting yesterday at the ollice
of the president, Mr. H. B. King.

Among those present was Commo-
dore Elbridgo T. Gerry. who is allied
with kindred philanthropic work in
New York state.

'1 he secretary and troasurer's report
was read and showed much good work
done during the past year.

President King’s report was exhaust-
ive of the work, scope and aim of the
society. lie dwelt on the instances of

 

'x'. l; I l'irili‘.

soft. and in Hl'tlt'l‘ that lll'j‘.‘ iisigiit haul. 11‘

footetlnvss of the unshod animal. and.

caution, cunning,r and advice constantly
{put forth in the interest of dumb crea-
'tion. and the good done by the mere fact
of the existence of an alert and deter-
mined association. The ﬁxed income
enjoyed by the society, small though it
be, enables the society to handle mat-
ters demanding attention in the imme—
diate neighborhood, but not to enter on
the broad ﬁeld that need and desire
Opens.

He favored, if it were possible. re-
suming the giving of prizss to school
children for essays on the aim of the
society.

Mr. King tmbodics this strong bit of
a soliloquy, which is pertinent and
worthy of careful perusal and retice—
tlon:

It is a strange commentary on the pro-
gressive age we live in, with all the ad-
vances we have been making in knowledge,
in power, in humanity; with all our labor-

saving inventions, all our appliances for
increased comfort and luxury, that the

has not kept pace with that of the higher.
This is true of man as well as of the
lower animals. The gulf that: yawns be-
tween tne very rich and the very poor

more than formerly roll in luxury, 9. con-
stantly increastng proportion of mankind
is lacking the necessaries of life. And as

existence become keener and the survival
of the ﬁttest a stern reality: as human
ingenuity increases the simplicity and
capacity of the loom, so does the poor fac-
tory woman have more of them to look
after; as our highways are improved, so
must our horses haul bigger loads, and
haul them faster!

were passed. The ofﬁcers of the society
re-elected are:

Docking Tails is Cruelty.

SUCH IS Tin-z DECISION REGARDING 'Ttm !
POLO runes or THE ROCKAWAY HUNT ’
CLUB.

The New York Herald of April 10 53%. i
President John P. Haincs. 0f the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
caused the arrest of prosecution or Michael
Shcchun. Martin Ryan and James Smith
for (locking the tails of twenty ponies at:
\t'oodsburg, 1-1. I., on March 18. The horses
so it. is claimed, belong to John I). Chcever,
of the Rockaway Hunt Club, and were u;
be used as polo ponies. Superintendent
Hankinson and Detective Oldenberg, of the
society, made the arrests, and arraigned
the prisoners before Justice chlitt at the
Woodsburg courthouse yesterday morning
for trial. President Haines, Counselor El-
liott and Justice Jim Seaman of Hemp-
stcad appeared as prosecutors. The wit;-
nesses for the peOpIe were quite numerous,
and were most emphatic in declaring the
dockingr to be a. most barbarous cruel-
ty. “It made me sick,” said Adam
Wanser. Captain Blake, Mr. Cheevcr’s
manager, told the magistrate that
he appeared for his employer, the
owner of the ponies, and was prepared to
ilead guilty for all the parties implicated
in the ali'air, Mr. Checver includcd,f0rcaus-
ing and permitting the docking to be done. 3
lie did not attempt to justify the offense,
only on the ground that. it: was roperlyg
done. The prosecution produced t e tail of
a horse and showed by Drs. Johnson and
McLean that the Operation, no matter how
skillfully done, must necessarily cause great;
physical pain and suﬁ'crmg. and when sup-
)lemented by burning the stump With a red
hot iron, the agony must have been excru-
ciating. One. of the spectators was heard
to say'that one of tiieunimaln screamed and
struggled like a human being during the
cutting and burning. Each of thedefcnde
ants claimed ignorance of the, 1:3me with.
gation of their crime. Judge Hewlltt, .111 3
pronouncing sentence, said, owmg to the
fact of it being their ﬁrst offense, he would '
not impose the full penaltyin this 1nstance;_ _;
therefore be sentenced Sh'cehan to pay a :
tins of $50 and be imprisoned'in the. county 3
jail for twenty days, he being the one who
actually performed the operation. ‘In the
case of Ryan and Smith, a 11116 of $0 was
imposed on each of them.

the mummiﬁed appearance of his epi—
dermis, is no nearer guide. But
disappointment in not being able to create
a sensation, has soured his naturally grue-
some disposition, and we have before us a
most undesirable little old person. One
line morning the opportunity of his life
presented itself, however. At length, his
one great chance had come to him. He
learned that by paying a sum of about
$5200 he could be appointed as a special
ofﬁcer of the society for the “prevention
of eorns on animals.” Thoughis little old
heart 'swelied within him, as visions ‘ of
what he would do when clothed with a
little brief authority, floated before his
little mind. Now was a dandy canoe to ’
makefjsome one take notice of him. and he ;
paid the money and got the appointment ‘
Since then the world has seemed infighter
to him. He can now llOld up one little
withered yellow ﬁnger and tell the coun -
try boys who C(lllO to town with the old
mare that has got a corn with running too
long in the pasture without work, that he
is the “ossifer,” and show a nice badge,
and scare the country boy by telling him
his horse is overworked. (sic). He knows
as much about horses as a dog knows
about baking potatoes, but that signiﬁes
nothing. He can step a horse and grin
and look yellow, and talk rot and that is
enought’happiness for this heretofore no
‘ account little person. One day he stopped

a farmer to look under his horses collar
for corns,but the farmerhad a new sticky
.ﬂy paper in his buggy. and the little man ,
came near getting stuck upons “ it, and so.
,losng his life. Anozher time when hold-
,ing up a little wrinkled yellow ﬁnger, and
running out intO'the road to stop a young
fellow in a sulky, who was exercising his
horse, the young man taking him for a
yellow jacket or wasp, gave him a cut
across the eyes with his whip, which de-
cided him to give up the business of stop-
ping anything but little country boys in
future—hr else some poor fellow who
would be afraid of his good clothes. The
counterpart of the miserable minded little i
wretch is to be found in nearly every town. i
the Ofﬁce being often assumed for the
same motive, a little brlef authority, and
1 mostly by unrecognized and insigniﬁcant
persons. The society is well enough in
itself, but it seems to be deplorably unfor»
tunate in the selection of its officers in
small towns A change will doubtless be
made by the society as soon as it rccogni~
zes the kind of a person that is. bringing
its name into discredit for personal grati-
fication of yi‘tnity.

STOPPING ‘21 ‘ BULL 3161-117" ‘

 

Riot in the Circus. Vin -Pa.ris—-—Bill Against
Hardened Criminéls.’

PARIS. MaY'.24 (Special by Ca.b1e).——The police
stopped the picadores who were performing at a
bull ﬁght on account ofhor'sss being disemboweled
in the presence 013' the Spectators. . The prohibition
of the. exhibition led to a riot in the circus. The
audience tore .up the seats and threw them into
the arena. and a free ﬁght ensued between «them
and the police. The result is likely to be a Dﬁrma-l.
nent tearing down of ‘such affairs, if not their per; "
manent prohibition. .

The Senate 1; :3 adopted a bill dealing severely

A LIVELY DOG FIGHT.

[scanner or ILLUSTRATIoNJ

The dog ﬁght between (lormley‘s Spot. of Flatbusb. L. I.. and
Mahon‘a Barney. of New York, {or 8400. gate money and the
”pound chgmpiullblllp oi Ami-rim. which created considerable
interest in sporting C'H’le‘r'. WM brought off at Fort Hamilton,
N. Y., on April 16. The battle was to have been decided on
April 12, at the Washington Hotel. N. J.. and the stakeholder
and the party were on hand and about 250 sporting men were
present. After waiting until ll o‘clock the crowd moved on to
theother place. They had a duo old tramp over rocky roads
and through Jersey mud and dirty streams that were not
always forded with success. Many a man was short in his es-
timate of how far to jump over several of the rlvulets. and
landed ker-splasli with both feet in the odorous water. A sport
of the nameof Delaney was‘at lds't agreed upon. but by this
‘11 Jersey City and lioboken . including several policemen, were
gathered, in and about the desolate Washington Hotel. and that
was too many to allow the picnic to he proceeded with. The
ofﬁcers were especially objectionable spectators to have. and
they made themselves more and more disagreeable by arresting
a couple of sports wholmd only come out to look on.

On April 14. the parties met the stakeholder and he ordered .
both men. with ten men on each side. to meet him on Wednes-
day. April 16, at Dougherty‘s. corner of Atlantic and Franklin
avenue. Brnoklyn. when he would personally meet them and '1
send them to a battle ground. On the date mentioned. the
stakeholder met the parties and ordered them to 20 to a well-
known resort at Fort Hamilton. The party with their ﬁghting
canines, in carriages. at once started for the trysting place
where they arrived at 2 P. M. The dogs were brought into the
building and a wrangle began over the selection of a referee.
Alec Brown, of Brooklyn. well known in sporting circles. had
been agreed upon in Brooklyn. but upon the parties reaching
the battle ground the owner of Barney objected, and consider-
able time was lost in selecting an ofﬁcial. Finally a well-known
amateur athlete agreed to act.

Both dogs were then weighed and were below the stipulated
weight. Then the toss of a coin decided that Spot should be
washed ﬁrst. A tub of water was put into the pit, and Barney’s
handler. who is known as ““Sip‘leVJ’ washed the brute. He took
a long time to do it, as he wanted to chill the dog's blood. “Old
3111” took equally long to wash Barney. and then McDermott ‘
And Winne. who were holding the dogs in theircorners, let
them go.

Barney was the favorite with the crowd before the battle be-
gun, but when ten minutes had elapsed it was seen that Spot
was by far the better wrestler. cutter and biter. That he was
not game all through was, however. apparent, as whenever Bar-
ney got his favorite hold on the leg Spot cried piteously and
looked appealiugly to his owner.

From Barney. however. there never was even a whisper. His
throat was torn and he was shaken like a rat by his antagonist,
but he never gave evidence of suffering. They fought furiously
for one hour and ten minutes without an advantage. during
which time the man who had sold tickets to the ﬁght managed
to bet all the gate receipts on Barney. He bet $25 on Barney
time and again and on each occasion remarked that it was

. other people’s money he was putting up. Thelsigniﬁcance of

the statement was not recognized until a settlement was asked
for, when the winner found there was no gate money. Then
pistols were drawn and murder threatened, but this little brepze

’ noon blew over.

At the end ofoue hour and ﬁfty-four minutes Spot gained a
“turn,” and when. aftera thirty seconds’rest, Barney was not
at the scratch. a row was raised by a sporting policeman who had ‘
bet on Spot. He pulled a billet and struck a bystander on the
head and immediately the row became general. A chair“
wielded by a woman“ desceudﬁd and a man was on the ﬂoor.-
He was promptly kicked in :‘iinsensibility and carried out to
the bar-room. This ﬁght also subsided in order to allow the dogs
towhave their content out. Then. when three minutes had
elepsed, Spot gained another “turn.” and again it was Barney’s

turn to "scratch.” He failed to do so on this occasion, how- 7

ever. and when the required time was up the referee awarded
Spot the battle and stakes. The new crops near the Fort were
badly damaged by gentlemen anxious to escape ﬂying bullets,
and . taken all in all it was the liveliest dog dispute: on record.
Then the row began in earnest, and matters wore’m‘aii‘e lively
tor the referee. A club in the hands of a stalwart chap hit him
on the head and aided him in getting through a window, and
several men followed him. The pit was torn down. men were
on the ﬂoor with others on'top of them, with plaster from the
ceiling, which began to fall. cavering them. Clubs struck heads
and shoulders. and one or two pistols were discharged. In the
midst of it Spot‘s handler picked up his dog to carry him away.
' Then Johnnie Malian jumped upon him. and they had it hot and
heavy. Malian pulled his pistol and a man called Sargey pulled
his, and they blazed away at each other. . ‘ ‘ .
Soon, however. all had escaped to the open air excepting Mr.
1 Sargey, who stood triumphant with his pistol in his hand. Then
the mistress of the house entered. .
“It’s the ﬁrst ﬁght that ever was held here,” said she. "and it
will be the last.” Then seeing the pistol in Sargey’s hand she
took achair, and raising it above her head, said: “You’re a
killer. are you? Well, get out of here.” The chair was mightier
than the revolver and Sargey left.
This stopped the ﬁght, and then it was
of the dogs, was dead. . . '
In the meantime ﬁghting had been resumed and continued
until all hands were tired. No arrests were made. ,

What the report says of Perry Belmont’s rahg ,‘
bit-baiting matinees on Long Island will be ing’w‘
teresting to the people who attended them. 7116;;
says in part: , ' . y;
"I, with six of the society’s ofﬁcers. went tori
Hicksville, Queens County, L. I., on Dec. 7 lusty»;
and there arrested two of the principals ant-f»
gaged in the so-calleu sport of rabbit baiting.” @627
enumerate all the cruel details incidental to the;
chasing andkllllng of rabbits by dogs in an 111-:
closed ﬁeld would doubtless shock the aensibilitié‘s‘t‘
of all right-thinking people. It will suffice to state)
that the rabbits are captured and-brought fro.
some Western State to a Long Island farm, an. "
there kept in bondage until it pleases the memboxid;
‘of the club. to whom the animals are sold, to drive;
them out one at a time into the ﬁeld describd- i
where they are chased by dogs until caught-auxin
killed.
“This manly (‘ll pastime was criticised by alarm-1"
cr’s daughter who was present at the last bait in.
the following outspoken language: “They (alluding
to the clubmen) call themselves men! I’dlikle to
see them all spankedl’ The prisoners were ar-L
raigned before the local magistrate and charged
with violating certain provisions of Section 655 of
the Penal Code, via: ‘lnstigating and furthering. ,
acts of. cruelty to animals.’ The jury’remained out, _}
some time, but ﬁnally rendered averdictot not: '
guilty. ‘ "L
“mated by the verdict, another bait was in-:“_
dulged in by the same club and at the same plac'e.._.;
The slipper of the dogs was promptly arrested byixj
the society’s ofﬁcer, who. to the surprise or those:
present, suddenly put. in an appearan so on the ﬁeld.,'~~; .1
The prisoner likewme demanded atrialby 311.137,:ij 1
and was acquitted. Representative citizens of Long
Island, however, condemn the foreign innovation}
under the name of coursing, and characterize it as I
a brutal pastime.” '

ports as follows: , ,

'rmc PRESIDENT’S REPORT.

The ﬁfth anniversary of the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals is;
ended. I shall not: give a detailed re_a

‘ port of what has been done by this 30.?
1 clety, but give a. general outline of whit;i
1 has been and what should be done toi
carry out the objects of this society. The ‘
frequent arrests, and the existence of this ‘
soc1ety has kept in check extremecccesJ
of cruelty so effectively thatbut few cases
of cruelty have been noticed in the‘last .
year. A word of advice or a written 110- i
tlce is often given to persons that; p'erpc- i
crate cruelties of a mild or unintentional

form, and usually has the desired eﬁect.

It is the policy of this scolety to check

cruelty by moral session it possible, but

suilicient notice and warning has been i
already given during the existence of this.
society, therefore the persons that are
cruelly treating animals have no reason
or excuse to make when the law is en-
forced. There is a wonderful changein
the way that; animals are treated in the
city now, and when the society was ﬁrst

All societies of this kind should have,
agents or detectives to look up and watch
the way our useful animals are used. It _
it were generally known that detectives
were employed expressly for that pur-

from this county will take an interest in
introducing bills that will give this so-
ciety the necessary jurisdiction to carry
out its objects. Almost all other states
have laws passed to prevent brutal
parents and guardians from cruelly treat-
ing children. We cannot carry out the
objects of this society Without such laws .
I am sure that our state will not hesitate
to pass all the laws necessary to carry
out the objects of this society if properly
brought before our leglslators. 'lhese
societies are increasing in popularity

States or Europe that has not a humane
society. During the‘twenty-ﬂve years
that these societies have been in exist~
ence thousands of animals have been pro-
tented from cruelty, and thousands of

dollars saved to the owners of animals '

through the inﬂuence of these societies.
Cruelly using or neglecting to care for
our useful animals is condemned by all
right thinking people, and is becoming
more unpopular every year. The people
are becoming humanely educated. The
popular press of; the country denounces
cruelty and all classes of sport of a de-
grading nature, and some of our public
{ educators too have taken an interest in

 

Our state laws are not as comprehen-

r and there is hardly a city or:
every yea ’ in the United ;

 

]. the work and teach their pupils to respect 1'

Wthe feelings and rights of others, and to
j protect animals from cruel treatment .
Bands of Mercy are-formed in many of
the schools, and the young minds are
i being moulded to abhor cruelty in every
form. The clergy preach sermons on
cruelty, and with the clergy, the press
and the schools on the side of humane
education it will do much towards doing
away with indiﬂerence displayed by the
masses of the people to the sufferings of
the brute creation. People that have
been accustomed to seeing animals
cruelly used; the cruel acts do not at«
tract their attention and are passed by
indifferently . ‘

The checking of horses is too indif-
ferently thought about; it is one of the
most cruel customs and practices. There
is a great need of reform in the way that
horses are checked in this city . Many of
our citizens do not realize that their fine
carriage horses are suffering intensely
from the way that they are checked;
Which I know if they did realize it they
would relieve them at once . I think high~
checking effectually destroys the hand-

some appearance (if a ﬁne horse.
The grandeur of the animal ’s
natural form is destroyed by turn-
ing the eyes and nose upward,

The tossing of that head; the vigorous
pawing of the earth, the champing of the
bit, the throwing of the head , the restless

excruciating pain that the horse is either—
log. As soon as the check is loosened
they will stand in an easy, graceful and
proud position, and look thankful for the
kindness. The‘fai‘r occupants of the car-
riages who ride behind high-checked

noble animals would surely rectify these

abuses if their attention could be drawn
A @000 guide in check-
ing a horse would be to never check a

of those journals are very interesting and
instructive to children. Subscription

dress of the papers can be obtained at our
headquarters and sample copies can also

. be obtained free of charge.

The great drawback to this society is

. We are in cor- :
different societies;

the limited means at its disposal to carry .

out its objects. The most people do not
appreciate the great good these societies
are doing, but most of them will acknow-
ledge that it is a good society and should
be supported. The objects of the
society can not be carried out without
agents, which requires money, and
money is needed many times to prosecute
violations of the law. I am perfectly
willing to give my time and take abuse in
carrying out the objects of this society
and the other ofﬁcers are doing the same.
But our citizens should take the same
interest in the good cause and give pecu-
niary aid to it by becoming members, or
in some other way. In some cities large
donations and bequests are given to these
societies which gives them great ad—
vantages in carrying out the work. They
can have plenty of agents, hospitals, am-
bulsuces, drinking fountains and every-
thing for the comfort and welfare 'of
animals, and also children.

It is very;
important that the suburbs of the city and ’

outside in the county should be watched, ?

A person is not apt to cruelly treat
animals ,where they are . closely
watched. Major Quattlebaum is very
watchful and is giving more time
and attention to the interest of the socie-
ty than Iwouid suppose he could well
spare from his business, which is highly
appreciated by the society. Most per-
sons who report cases of cruelty to the
society object to being known in
the case, making it more
to make out the case. This socie-
ty will take it as a favor if all
persons will report to the ofﬁcers of the
society, or to its headquarters, any

difﬁcult.

cruelty that may come to their knowl»

sponsibility without fear or favor. The
press can do a great deal to carry out
the objects of this society. THE MOBILE

. REGISTER has done more than could be
lexpected in the way of advertising and

advocating our cause, for which our
society is under many obligations, and
we hope that we can rely on its great as-
sistance in the future .

Before closing I feel it is my duty to

. to acknowledge, in behalf of this society ,
some assistance from the 901108. Whlcn.
The police have

we are thankful for.
the power legally to make the arrests in
cases of cruelty , and it is their duty to do

them to give us all the assistance that is
in their power, and it will be highly
appreciated by the society. Some of the
police have become members of this
society, and we hope that more of them
will become members. No dues for mem-
bership are required from the policemen .

The society will take all the re~

 

Also, in behalf of this society, it is my .

duty to acknowledge our obligations to
Hon. F. a, Bromberjg. our counsel and
adviser, for valuable services rendered

Finally, I think the citizens should be
thankful for what has been done, taking
into consideration the small means
We have had to work with.

ﬂ » ‘_ CHARLES M. DA COSTA—OTHER PROVISIONS i
ii on HIS WILL. ' '

The will of Charles M. Da Costa, of the law Vﬁrm {
of Seward, Da Costa & Guthrie, was admitted to
probate yesterday, and ‘ the principal bequest is '
$100,000 for Columbia College. In the clause mak-

hope that such sum may be used for the endowment
of some new professorship, which, in the good. judg-
ment ofxthe Board of Trustees, may be needed in any.
of the schools 0r departments of the college. But
this expression of mine 'is in no way to limit the
absolute right of the said corporation to use“: the said
sum for 3.11ny its corpOrate purpOses.” The testator’s
‘ library, containing both law and miscellaneous hooks,
.' also goes to. the college. "The following charitable
bequests are also made: Three thousand dollars’each
to St. Luke’s -Hospital, the Home for Incurables, the
' New-York Society for the Relief of the Ruptured and
Crippled, the New-York Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children, the, American Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the Children’s
VIAid Society; $1,500 each to the New¢York Free Cir-
: oulating Library, the Colored Home, the Association

ing this [bequest Mr. De Costa said: “I express the ,

1

 

for the Beneﬁt of Colored Orphans and the Society of
St. Johnland; $1,000 each to the Training School, for
Nurses and the Midnight Mission. ‘ ‘

I ‘Mr. Da Costa gives to Noe‘l B. Sanbor’n his share
in the. New-York Law Institute, and to Clarence .A. ,
, Seward two large vases and a Dutch hall clock. To

 

his brother, A. M. Da Costa, of Kansas City, M0,? he
leaves $25,000 and an annuity of $2,000 per annum,
' which his executor is .1 directed. to purchase in Some
ﬁrst-class insurance company. To his brother, Dr. ;
Jacob M. Da Costa, he gives the house andrlot No.
29 East Thirty—eighth-st., with all their contents not
otherwise .bequeatliedg‘ The residue is given to Dr. ‘
J. M. ,Da Costa, in trust, to be held by him until the
, testator’s nephew, Charles, ‘F. Da Costa, is of age,
When the principal and necumulations are to be paid .
over to him. If Charles dies the residue is to be
divided between the testator’is .two brothers. V
‘ The will‘w’as Written by Mr. pa Costa himself on
March 1, 1890, ’ and was witnessed by his part—
ner, William A. Guthrie, and A. Fielding. Clarence A.
Seward, his senior partner, is made executor. The

will has been admitted to probate, both brothers hav-
ing ﬁled waivers, and Mr. Seward has qualiﬁed as
executor. ' ‘ . >

Professor vHenry. Drisler, of the college, was as-
tonished, but nevertheless delighted, on being told" by
a Tribune reporter of Mr. I_)a Costa’s gift. Mr. Da j
Costa, he said, had never given him any intimation"
of his intention to bequeath money to the college,
funds, although he had always taken. the closest and}
"Warmest interest in the welfare of Columbia, and was

 

especially identiﬁed with the Law School and SchoOl
of Political Science. “ It is. obv10usly impossible for,
me now to tell what use Will be made of the money
., until the trustees meet,” said Mr. Drisler. “Of
course Mr. pa Costa?s personal Wishes in the mattel‘l,
.wni be paramount” ' . , - __

Church, Portland, June 22,1890.
by Rabbi J. Bloch.

Protection to

 

The great achievements of modern civili-
zation are calculated to meet and to pro-
mote the cause. of humanity in ameliorating
all conditions of life, (it vising new comfort.
pro 'iding additional luxuries, checking the
evils of pauperlsm, opening new mines of
vcalth, and lengthening and deepening the
bread channels oi commerce. Humanity
employs science and art to trace, to analyze
the secret forces of nature and the germs of
life in nature, in order to ﬁnd the surest
remedies for all human sufferings, and to
prolonglii‘c and make life yield its greatest
blessings of joy and happiness, diminishing
suffering and pain, and the tortures of inevi-
table death to the least. possible minimum.

In aiding the cause of tClC’llCE} we are but
helping the cause of humanity, and in every
triumph of humanity we fortify the strong—
holds of life. It is the bread cast upon the
waters sure to return sooner or later.

Appreciate as we Ill ust the "modern
achievements of the healing art, the great
progress made in the great study of animal
life through the help of the microscope,
making it possible to solve many of the
mysteries of life and to behold the chain of

evidences encircling all livzng, our dcpend- :

ence upon each other for woe mid weal,
good or evil, exposing the dangers 0 animal
force, if left unrestrained,

hearted master, or to the ignorant and brutal
‘pcrsecutor——with all these overwhelming,
happy results we can still afford to take a
loci: backward to those ages when, unaided
by science, religion, in the system of
Mosaism. alone held its shielding hand
over God’s loving creatures, and by her sun-
lime laws directed man to steer life’s canoe
safely into the harbor of social happiness.
Combining, then, both results, the experi-
ence of religion of old and the scien iﬁc
studies of modern times. we are entitled

to look forward to the time when
life shall be better understood,
and and every living being better

appreciated to the time which the prophet
has painted in these heavenly colors: “i‘zizz‘.
the sucking child shall play an the hole of
the asp, and on the i:zi."ilil.3l:i’3 don
shall the weaned child stretch on; l‘zii hand.
They shall not do hurt no.“ desiroy on all
my holy mountain; for the. earth shall be
full of the Knowledge of the Land, as
waters cover the sea.” (lssiaéi xi :8 '3).

gold. and more luminous than the stars, we
read: “Thou Shall? not muzzle the. ox wnen
he thresheth out the corn.—-—Deut. XXV:4.”

The principle of kindness and mercy.
aye of justice, reaches its goal, when w;
consider that the sabbath commandment,
this divine token Ol immortality, commands
not oniy rest to inc-n, but strictly enjoins thy
cattle. too, shall be givona day of rest. The
author of the I’rcvcrbs measures man’s true
character by this standard: “A righteous
man carcth for the life of his beast, but the
mercies of the wicked are cruelty.” 110W
deep this noble sentiment was cultivated
among the Hebrews we can trace even
beyond, throughout the post-Biblical litter-
attire, especially in the Talmudical jaws.
Tilly, for an example, they hold thatthe
feeding of the cattle must precede that of
men. The legendary purl; of this literature
abounds with wholesome teachings, from
wh.ch I may be permitted to quote. These
tell us that Moses and David were chosen as
leaders of Israel by virtue of the kindness '
and mercy shown to their ﬂocks. The
quaint and simple story runs thus; One
day, while Moses was tending his ﬂock on
Ilorcl', he dcscricd a lamb running away
from thchcrd. Pursuing it to agreat dis-
tance, he caught it atthe fountain, Where
he permitted it to quench its thirst, and
then gently picking it up, and pressing it to
his Losom, exclaimed, “I would not have
chased thee had I known your wants,” and
then caressingly he carried it back to its‘
mother. It was a moment chosen by God,
calling Moses to a higher mission. Moses,
thou art worthy, through thy kindness and
mercy, to become the shepherd of my
people.

These brief outlines will sufﬁce to impress
us with respect for these nobler sentiments of ,
the Hebrew people. Still more elaborate, and"
of the greatest moment were the rabbinical
laws founded upon the teaching of the Bible
-—-a code of laws, most carefully expounding
the manner of slaughtering animals, in or-
der to prevent any avoidable torture or cru-
elty and cause theleast pain and the quickest
dispatch to death. Further, it requires a
careful and strictly scientiﬁc examination
of the carcass, permitting only such ﬂesh to
be disposed of which may be found entirely
free from any fatal or contagious disease.
Our ess:iy would necessarily be prolonged
should I dwell upon the principal issues in-
volved ; they are characteristic of the re-
search of the old Pharasees, with all their
inferences from the major to the minor
causes and vice versa—-a most elaborate and
carefully woven network of laws and scien-
tiﬁc definitions, all of which evince a perfect
knowledge of practical physiology, and also
the pathology of the most vicious of dis-
eases. To exhibit the wisdom of these rab-
binical legislations, permit me to give you a
brief outline of this code. still enforced
amongst the children of Israel in every
country. .,

First—Only persons well qualified in
knowledge and piety, of courage and yet of
sympathy, are permitted to perform the
ritualistic slaughtering. The official so au-
thorizod by a rabbi is charged With the re-
sponsibility of the act, never to cause tor:
ture, and to judge consmentiously accord-
ing to prescribed laws. The telling of the
cattle is minutely described to prevent any

bruising. The'knife must be of proper
make and size, keen edged without the
slightest notch perceptible to the .keenest
sense. Before dispatching his victims tins
ofﬁcial had to utter ah shprt 1prayekf, 1nVOK-
in the hi hest a‘ut ori 3’, Y W 088 D53!-
mibsion only he sheds animal blood. VVlt-h
a quick motion the knife must sever the
wind-pipe, the gullet and the great arteries,
and after the elapse of one minutedife is
extinct. According to the latest soientiﬁc
investigation made by European ﬁsavans
under the auspices of the sOCIGtIeS for the
prevention of cruelty (3}) animals, 90 other
method of slaughtering can. claim any
superiority. Shooting, garotting, stabbing,
or stunning by blows upon thefoiehea ,
are cruel methods whicu beu
, long to the" barbarous ages and m
i many of then European states these
are justly prohibited by law, for these make

Irrv‘m‘i'm’. f" .
,‘ Aehiiii‘iﬂ, Cuonmr To ANIMALS .-—A
orres‘E’hnd'ent writes. as that he read our,
precent'Eiiticle in these columns, headed
.‘ ‘ Wllé‘ntm Cruelty to Animals, " with 8
great deal or pleasure. “It strikes the
'nail squarely on the head,’ ' to use his
, own expression. And again: ‘ ‘It all the
great newspapers would give vent to sim-
ilar sentiments wanton cruelty to animals
would soon be regarded as something so
disgraceful that there would not be much
at it practiced in public, at least. ’ ' H6
viully agrees with us in the notion that
there ought to be more societies for the
' prevention of cruelty to animals organ-
ized in country regions . The following
clipping from a back number of the New
Orleans Picayune embodies he says, the,
main features at the organization:

Some persons believe that a society for
the prevention of cruelty to animals has
its birth in the morbid sentimentality oi.
stew, when, in fact, it is based upon
" the recognized rights of an animal, as at
" sentient being, to demand that no un-
necessary suffering be inﬂicted upon it.
To protect the lower animals, that by
reason of their speechlessness need pro-
tection, and to educate the higher ani-
mals. then is the aim of the organization ‘
called a society for the prevention of cru- .
city to animals.

Its ofﬁcers would rather convert than
convict, but where pleadings, cautions .
and warnings fall, it becomes their buSl- ,
uses to prosecute .

The society aims to stop overbeating,
overloading, overdriving and underieed-
ing of animals; to stop the driving of
lamed, galled and sick animals; to im-
prove the method 0! transportation 01
cattle, and to endeavor to educate people
to see no beauty in the use at the check
rein or the mutilation of animals, such as ~
cutting the tails of horses, the ears and
tails of dogs and dehorning of cattle; it
also seeks to protect song and insect-
eating birds , and it would stop forever the
. brutal prize tights.

The ﬁght between men has one advan-
tage over bull-ﬁghting, cock ﬁghts and
dog- ﬂghts, the men go in voluntarily,
and the fat purse for the victor is a helm
for the wounds and bruises, while the
animals, the bulls, cocks and dogs have
only the suffering. The evil effect on the
~ community of all prize ﬁghts is beyond
“calculation—therefore does the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
condemn the barbarous sport.

The society advocates humane litera-
' ture, the erection of drinking iountains,
better drivers, better horseshoeing,
improved cattle cars and more humane
laws.
, It would induceteachers. preachers,
editors and authors to advocate human-
ity . Its object, in a word . is to protect
and to instruct, to teach the children
kindness and to induce all to study the.

Icharge of wanton cruelty and barbarin. home
recent experiments made by Dr. M .' Gi‘lman
Thompson, and reported upon by him in The
New-York Medical Journal,” seem to belong
in the latter category. ‘

These experiments are described as demon-
strating the practicability of brain graiting;
The attempt was made to prove that brain, as
well as skin, bone, muscle, glands, eyes or
nerves, can be transplanted. and adapted to
physiological requirements of incorporation and
growth. Two dogs were trephined, small sec-
tions of brain were cut out of each and then
exchanged. Total blindness resulted in the
eye opposite the lesion in. each dog. On the
J third day the dogs were killed, and the trans-
iplanted brain sections were _found to haye a
I normal appearance with indications of adher-
Eence of tissues. The experiment was repimted
on a cat and a doe. The dog’s fateus not
stated, but the cat was mzde blind 111. one
eye, and when killed on the third day the tissue
transplanted was shown to adhere by .a layer
of ﬁbrin to the brain. A similar pair were
operated upon and corresponding results were
noted this time in the case of the-dog. Then
i a button of bone was cut out of another dog’s
head and left so that it could be raised and
I depressed like a trap-door. A Section of brain
was removed and replaced with a similar weight
I of tissue from a cat’s brain, the trephiiie open—
ing being closed by the button. The dog was
‘- very feeble for several days, but then made a
fair recovery with the exception of loss of Sight.
At the end of seven weeks the dog was killed
I and “the brain microscopically examined. The
transplanted section was found to adhere ﬁrm-
i‘ .ly' to the main tissue, but lines of degeneration
extended down into the dog’s brain. The er—
‘ perimenter professes to have demonstrated that
brain tissue has sufﬁcient vitality to survive
‘ for seven weeks the operation of grafting 'with-
out whOlly losing its identity ; and that while
there may be sympathetic degeneration on the
opposite side of the brain there is a complete
union of the tissues of animals of different
Species.

i These being the experiments and the results,
Iit new remains to be determined whether the
fprocesses of vivisection can be justified with
anv standard of reason and common-sense. Let
it be conceded that it has been proved that a
dog can be kept alive, albeit with loss of
sight, for seven weeks with a section of a cat‘s
”brain buttoned into a hole made in his own
brain, and that degeneration of tissues while
inevitably taking place are remarkably Slow
’ in development. What then? What has been
gained by all. this. trephining, brain-grafting
and animal terture? Is it of any practica]
value to'ascertain that a dog will not die at,
once but can be, kept alive for seven weeks
Vixwith a. trap—door in his head and a bit of cat’s
:brain underneath? Is there the reinotest pas.

can ever be made to surgery ‘9 Can two human

. A COW POISONER LET OFF CHEAPLY OWING ,
TO HER EXTREME AGE.

Mrs. Margaret Peterson, eightyﬁve
years old and residing in West Brighton, .
was arrested last Saturday afternoon by .
Ofﬁcer Simakoﬁ'on the charge of scatter«
ing paris green on pasture land leased by
a Mrs. Margaret Murphy adjoining that on
which Mrs. Peterson resides. '

Mrs. Murphy is the owner of twelve
milch cows which, it is said, at times cross
the boundary line to graze on the land of
Mrs. Peterson. During the absence of
Mrs. Murphy at a funeral on the morning 5
of that day, a neighbor saw Mrs. Peterson I
take a large quantity of the poison and I

sow it like grain over Mrs. Murphy’s graz- ‘
ing land. The witness to the act at once
informed the cattleherd and the cows
were turned ed" the pasture.

The agent of the Society for the Pre-
vention of Cruelty to Animals was
promptly notiﬁed and a warrant for the

a" .V,. 4

trusted to the police-ofﬁcer who took Mrs.
Peterson into custody and conducted her
before the justice. She tottered into the I
court room, with the weight of old age I'
bending her shoulders into a steeping at- I
titude and in a shrill, piping voice told the I

 

magistrate that he could send her to jail ,
if he wanted to do so.
After examination of witnesses a fine of I

$25 was imposed, which her daughter, an "
old woman of about sixty-ﬁve years ofI

age, speedily paid, chiding her mother as I

she did so. ‘ . 7 I

Q My attentionwas ﬁxed upon this long-suf—
fering dispOSition of my fellow citizens vesten
ldhyﬂflnorning 1 when I. was riding downtown
ting, V‘rth avenue car. When we had got a
,llittiebelowﬂonston street on the Bowery our
carcame to a full stop. The passengers were
reading their newspapers, and didn’t mind the
r'-,',:3.y-K‘for a few. minutes; then a torrent of
‘ 'K‘rbfanity caused them to look up. Right in
~ rent of us, and placed so as to obstruct a
. Llehird avenue track, too, was a onehorse
limaiiket wagon. 'It‘ had been too heavily
lladen for the poor beast, and in endeavoring
[to draw it acress the railroad tracks he had

 

 

 
 
  

'given. "out. , I' never saw such pro-
jana’ ' gimpudence as was possessed by
«the, ,‘driver of that market wagon.

,_In lire minutes a dozen cars, northerly and
,jshutherly bound, ﬁlled with passengers, were
i-zgtopped. 7 Would he permit any of the horse-
;szar'fldrivers or conductors to assist him in

Eildrawmg his team from' the tracks? Not

 

   
    

'-'(

{1.2199 [Several of them offered to help him, but
{he forbade them with some of the most
g}_liorrid oaths that human lips ever ut-
l‘itered. When ten minutes had expired and
lithe market wagon still obstructed the tracks,
[and its driver and his assistant were still
. li.i&tearing at the poor horse and every one
hand everything else, people looked about for
l; a policeman. By this time more than twenty
l cars were massed north and south of the ob-
t[-struc’tion. No policeman was to be seen.
{f- This is the same part of the city in which the
'i‘i'policemen paraded who swore before the
Senate Committee that they had never seen
anything wrong inBolossy’s dive. All the
force belonging to that precinct seem to have

\ " At last the car conductors and drivers per-
;‘Vibuaded the market-wagon swearer to take
lifetime of the goods from his vehicle. Even
when he Wouldn’t let them help him. He in-
ifeisted that he and his boy should do the work
i‘;;themselves. And very slowly they ,did it.
{ii-Box after box was removed, and then the
kpoor beast was able to move. The track was
keleared and the cars moved. For ﬁfteen min-
:iutes they were unnecessarily delayed, and the
driver of the market-wagon should have been
;V'arrested for several offenses, but no police-
j""1,3‘,tanappe€t1‘ed. Some patrolxnen will do a1-
:imost anything to escape making an arrest,
l'lﬁi‘mply because an ar "est necessitates a good
”deal of trouble. Where, too, is the Society
3 for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals?
’ he horse in this market-wagon was over-
ﬁworkéd and unﬁt to be harnessed to such a
liloéd. But Henry Bergh is dead and his suc-
v‘lcessors are asleep. They seem to do nothing.

WEDNESDAY-EVENING, JULY '9.

   
 
     

Wonderful. can of a ll‘orse for a
Kind, Humane Friend.

 

Death Tool-r His Benefactor, and the
Beast is inconsolable.

.

One man. recently deceased. left one of
the sincerest mourners that ever bore in
memory past deeds of kindness. To be
mourned is not unusual. but this case is
extraordinary. The mourner is a’horse and
his "grief is [sincere and deep.

It has remained for a poor slaving butch-
er's delivery horse to demonstrate that the
equine race possesses an attribute which
brings it close to the human svecies—senti-
ment. . ’

 

 

 

MOUENING Eon MR. FRAZER.
The poor beast in question isn’t handsome

tolook upon. He is. in truth, a dejected.

lon‘eared looking animal just now, and it is

this very dejected air i’ the old hack which

in part demonstrates the sentimental vein"

in his make-up.
‘ Dobbin is brokenwhearted and disconso-
late. He has lost his friend of years. That
friend is dead.
It is not probable that Dobbin knows this,
but he is aware that the familiar face which
never for a day in several years failed to greet
him with kindly gaze and the wrinkled
hand which used daily to feed him with
juicy apples and sweetest cakes have de-
parted, and, as it is not proven that hope
was ever given to comfort 2, horse, the
‘ kindly face 3. id liberal hand are mourned by
, him as lost, and Dobbin is in despair.

The friend the poor horse grieves for is '

Edward Allen Frazer, the wholesale drug-
‘gist who died suddenly in his ofﬁce at 20
College place, tWO weeks ago. _

Mr. Frazer was sixty-two years old and a
bachelor. To the casual observer Mr. Fra-
zer seemed gruff and unsociable, but by his
intimate friends he. was known to be an un-
usuallyqﬁkind-hearted gentleman.

Without wife and children, he lavished
his affection on his books and his dumb
friends. Dobbin, the butcher’s delivery
horse. was onevoi these iriends. and he got-
. to watch eagerly at'his stand, on the corner
of polleqe place and Barclay street, for the
daily coming of his benefactor. always laden
With toothsome morsels tor-“him.

' “hose Visits ceased With Mr. Frazer’s

death, and the poor animal’s spirits and ears
have been drooping; ever since. .
. So deeply was he anected by‘his loss that
for-days he would not accept the attentions
which had used to come from Mr. Frazer
from the‘nands oi others.

, _An apple. which. would have been mun ched
With greatest oi. satisfaction and a thankful
silence oi theeyoi’ii tendered by Mr. Frazer,
was sadly refused. from other hands.

. But Dobbin’s perioricf mourning is draw-
ing to a close. and he isbeszinning risibly to
brighten. He he nourished his sentiment

quite as long as some oi‘ the sunerior human
land, and should be forgiven if he is so soon
forgetting the existence of a one-time friend
and benefactor.

ANAL BOATM Q,

5711‘: ‘_c.{'-usz~,.de inaugurated by _
3he Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Amv
“3115. against the cruelties of the towpath 810112 3
the Erie and other canals of the State. has been the
means of mitigating much suﬂering to the animals 3
used as a motive power. F. S. Snowden and John
H. Gay, two of the society’s most eﬁicient agents,
were detailed by Superintendent Hankinson for the
duty referred to, and their ﬁrst report to head-
quarters is interesting.

' , - They arrived at Schenectady on Tuesday last, and
-' on Wednesday arrested John Dallas, of Port Byron,
driver of a mule hauling boat '1‘. W. Hackman on
the Erie Canal. The animal was suffering from
ulcerated sores on the breast measuring four by
,: six inches and three by four inches. The captain,
-‘ John Derrick, was also arrested and taken with the
' driver and the mule to the Court House. On the.
plea of guilty Justice Eisenmcnger discharged the
driver, but lined the captain $5 and warned him
not to Work the disabled animal until ﬁt for use.

Just as the olh‘cers got bacl; to the towpath a,
large ﬂotilla of boats appeared. It was evident, by
reason of the commotion among the crews of the
approaching ﬂeet, that the presence of the anti-
fruelty oﬁicers had been telegraphed all along the
ins.

‘ It was impossible, however, to step the headway of
| . ‘ the vessels before reaching the point of danger, and
" 1 John Smith, of Buffalo, "N. Y., and Julius Gross, of
1 ; Warren, Ohio, drivers, and John Jarvis, of
‘ ‘; Rochester, ”N. Y.,' captain oi; the boats Eager, Petti-
5,, 1 bone and Watson, sailed straight intoa: haven of
,; rest, so far as the motive power was’con'cerned.
The latter consisted of four dilapidated mules.

. snownn HIS GRATITUDE. ‘ ’

One, a. bony gray, when rescued from the gelling
harness, rubbed his nose against Agent Gay’s
shoulder, and in seVeral ways appeared as if he
wanted to thank his delivercrs. There were dreazl- .
ful wounds on the animals” breasts, into which the
collars were almost embedded. Each of the drivers
was discharged, but the captain for permitting the
cruelty was ﬁned $10. The suﬁ'ering creatures
were placed in ahospital barn and their wounds
dressed. (

The determined and vigorous action of the agents }
‘ '1 ﬁnally aroused the belligerency of the rougher ele- 3

ment of the canallers, and when Michael Judge, '
' , pilot of the boat Fred and Edw. Easton, of Albany,

' ‘ ' N. Y., was ordered to heave to, cracked his whip, '
l ‘ g ‘ gave the nigh mule a cut and started more power,

, 1 intending to force his way through. Judge isa l

l . _‘ pretty tough rider, and when he undertook to run

‘ the: gantlet was encouraged and cheered on by a

Q , crowd. of his friends who thought to intimidate the

‘ ' ; agents by a display of force. To make matters !
t more interesting the captain, John Kelly, of Albany,

, .' jumped ashore and went to the assistance of his
- mate. The commander of the ﬂeet pushed through
" the crowd with a .“never surrender” attitude,whichl
disappeared, however, at the sight of. reinforc 3- '
. .. ments to the oﬁiclal ranks in the persons of Assist-

' , ant Chief Deforrest and Policeman Gould of the
' Schenectady police force. who charged through the
yelling crowd‘with pistol and club in hand. The
scrimmage was soon over, with victory for the hu-
manitarians. ,
THE sonns WERE FBIGHTFUL.

. The wounds on the bodies of the mules were

something frightful, measuring eight by ﬁve and
four by three inches, into which the collars were
pressing. On the way to court Captain Kelly loudly
threatened to make the agents pay dearly for the
outrage, if it cost him all his two boats were

."l. worth.
- 5} On being arraigned they demanded an examina-
' tion, which was ﬁxed for the next day, but just be-

fore the proceedings incidental to the adjournment
were ﬁnished beth oiienders decided to plead
guilty. Judge Eisenmenger departed from his
usual custom in the case of drivers and imposed a.
, ﬁne of $10 on Judge and $15 on Captain Kelly. Jl‘he
prisoners left the court in a much milder frame of
z _ mind than when they,entered it, and it is not at all

' likely, should the agents of the society have occa-
sion to overhaul them again, that they will make
the-least opposition. '

Several large tows have been inspected since
these, but the "tip” of warning was spread-and
1 the horses and mules were found in pretty; and
condition. ,, ‘, '

One captain jumped his mules aboard his boat
before arriving at the danger point, but he was told
he would be overhauled at Troy, so he concluded-
to stable his live stock and engage a towboat.

President Haines is determined to stop the cruel-
ties on the towpaths if within his power, and to
that end it is his intention to make a personal tour

 

 

the best course to pursue.

furnish it cheaply for our poor cats. Some
men, meaning of course to be insolent. ask
me if we want to give the cats cushions to
loll upon, but I always answer them quietly

i that we do not aim at anything quite so lux-
urious as that. In Dublin they have steam-
pipes for the cats to sit upon in Winter. but
we shall be satisﬁed if we can set them
some kind of shelter. We hope to have trees
and fences for the cats to play on and ﬁe'ht
on it they wish to, as, of course. they will.
For their food myself and Mrs. Wilson will
beg. We will go to the markets and hotels
with our baskets. like Little Sisters of the
Poor. and ask for ﬁsh heads and scraps that
will be acceptable to the feline palate. Then
we will hire some poor women to so around
and gather up cats that are crippled and
that have no homes. '

told me that. They don’t seem to wish‘p

know the Society has received millions of
dollars for the care of animals. and all
dumb hrutes are included in this term. I
do not place much conﬁdence in the cat mv- ;
self. I believe him to be sneakish and de—
ceitful. but when I see hundreds hiding
under barrels and boxes and ﬁnd boys
souging out their eyes for sport and throw-
ing stones at the poor creatures my heart
bleeds andI must do something for them.
Iwant THE WORLD to ask thepublic to
assist us in this work. A little money will
putthe institution on its feet. Iwill head
the list myself with $5; Mrs. Wilson will

Now let us hear from others who are friendly
to the homeless cat. ” _
Mrs. Devidé has been for ﬁfteen Years a
regular Florence Nightingale among the

 

, cats of the neighborhood in which she lives.
Every day she cooks a mess of haslets and at 5
midnight goes forth with her basket to feed

, vagrant cats. Sometimes she goes as far as
gtwelve blocks away from her home. She
finds little broods of kittens often in the
grass in vacant lots. Besides this she has
eight feline pensioners that are always fed
at her home. Her night trips bring her
into contact with about one hundred and
ﬁfty cats. She does her kind work in dark-
ness because the small boy is then in bed
and can only dream of killing cats.

The small boy, too. comes in for some of
her attention. She tries to persuade him
that isa sin to kill cats. She reads to him
and argues with him, and sometimes he
promises to let the tramp mousers alone.

Mrs. Divide is in earnest in this matter.
She listens patiently to all glib talk about
furnishing padded bootiacks and planting
the backyard with a plentiful crop of fences
for her clustering cats. and quietly remarks.
” Well. let us have the Home ﬁrst l”

She promises. too, that the Home shall be

. Horses. ‘

l Oﬁcers F. S. Snowden and John‘ H,-
Gay, of the New York headquarters of

to Animals, brought before Recorder
McElwain this morning, James D,
Kropp, Captain ’of .the canal boats,l
“KrOpp” and “Metie,” charging him,l
- with having caused his. boats to be‘
towed by three mules having great raw:
sores under their collars. The Recor.
der imposed a ﬁne of ten dollars upon
Kropp and, cautioned him against
working his mules again in their pres;
ent condition. ‘

Michael Siege], the driver employed
by Kropp, whowas also placed under
arrest on. the‘same charge, was dis-
charged. I

The ofﬁcers have been detailed by
the president of the society, Mr. John
P. Haines, to, work at different points
along the canal and endeavor to put a
stop to the fearful cruelties practiced
on their horses and mules by the boat-
men. They have been at Schenectady
for the last two weeks and made no
less than thirteen arrests there. Ofﬁcer.
Snowden said this morning that the
stock onthe canal this season is in
worse shape thanhe has seen it for
years. Some of the mules taken off at
Schenectady had raw, supperating
sores under their collars measuring
over ten inches in length and ﬁve inches
in width.- ‘

The oﬁicers are not sent out for the
purpose of collecting large sums of
money in lines, which by law goes to
the society, but to see that the laws are
enforced. The society pays all the ex-
penses of its ofﬁcers and the ﬁnes im-
posed are turned over to some charita.

NEW YORK, JULY 22, 1890.

. A' Child’s, Victory. _ ‘

. A coal cart was delivering an order in

2 Clinton place the other day, and the horse

a made two or three great eﬂforts to back the
' heavily loaded cart to the spot desired and
then bécame obstinate. The driver began

to beat the animal, and this quickly col—

lected a crowd. He was a big,r fellow, with

, : a ﬁerce look in his eye, and the onlookers ,

were chary about interfering, knowing
j l. - What would follow. “I pity the horse, but.
i ‘ I don’t want to get into a row,” remarked
one.
“I am satisﬁed that I could do him up
1 with the gloves on, but he wouldn’t ﬁght
that way,” added a second.

“I’m not in the’ least afraid to tackle
him,” put in a young man with a long
neck, “but about the time I got him down
‘ along would cﬁme a policeman and arrest
" . us both.” ~
The driver was beating the horse and '
1‘ 5 nothing was being done about it when a
‘ little girl about 8 years old approached and
3 said:

“Please, mister.”

l . “Well, what yer want?”

“If you’ll only stop I’ll get all the chil—
dren around here and we’ll carry only bit
of the coal to the manhole and let you rest
while we’re doing it.” .
., The man stood up and looked around in
‘. a deﬁant way, but meeting with only
pleasant looks he began to give in, and af-
ter a moment he smiled and :isaid:

“Mebbe he didn’t deserve it, but I’m out,
i ‘ of sorts today. There goes the whip, and
perhaps a lift on the wheels vriil help him.”

The crowd swarmed around the cart, a
l" hundred hands helped to push, and the.
j ' old horse had the cart to the spot with one
ll effort—New York Sun. -

. The streets of Gotham, never too clean
" at the best, will to-day be at the mercy
of every wind that strews the ground
with dust and lilth from overloaded
and malodorous ash-barrels and other

receptacles for garbage.

“The strike in the Street-Cleaning
vDepartment has reached a culminating
.lpbint, and this morning 1,500 men will
{Quit work, tylng up the entire depart-

‘ment.
They consmt of the hired cartmen, -
mudcart men, machine sweepers, ash-
,cart men and sprinklers and their as-
]Sistants. Their grievances, they say,
have now reached a paint where pa-
‘Ttience ceases to become a virtue, and
‘ they can no longer submit to ofﬁcial im-
‘positions. .
The hired cartmen~that is, the men;
who supply their own horses and carts——
-'rece1ve$:—l.50 a day. For this they have '
, to work fourteen hours a. day, and have
,LJtheir pay docked from $1 to $5 every

they and are on duty eleven and twelve
hours per day. The ground they are re—
; quired to cover they say would require
. eighteen hours’ work a day since Com-
missioner Beatt’e has taken charge.
They now complain that they have
been cut down to three days’ work a,
week, and the water-cart men, who re»
ceive the same wages per day, say they
have been cut down until they average
not-more than two days a week. ‘
The machine men say there are too,
few sprinklers and there is such a dust
, in consequence that they are liable to
‘ be arrested for using them.
The department cart-drivers receive
$2 aday. If they ride nine loads and
| the schedule says ten they are docked
35.0 cents, but if they ride thirteen or
-.; fourteen loads they receive nothing.
‘i‘extra. When they are paid short on
; .paydays there is no redress or ex-
i; planation given.
. , The ashmen say they have to report
,at5 a. m. and are through at 6:30 p. m.
. Their wages are liable to be cut at any
time. There is no system and they
never know what they will get.
The mudcart men report at midnight
and work until 3 o’clock on the follow—
: ing afternoon for $2 a day. They claim
that the department has shut up the
idumps at West Twenty-second street
and Jackson street, and that makes a ‘

Mr. W armgwas notiﬁed by letter from an ofﬁ-

‘vl .
A number of Brooklyn. women have talked

“lsresh-Air Fund for Cats.” The need for Sum.
a fund has been persistently urged by a 31.003:
lyn old maid who has just come back to the city
after having spent a period of eight years in;
rural Pennsylvania town. One of the women
who has been entreated to interest herself in q,
movement for the amelioration of the Condition
of the city cat consented to talk with a Truus's
representative yesterday after she had received
assurance that her name should not be asso-
ciated with the newspaper reproductio 4

she might say. Send this lady: fwhat
"' Our ‘ agitator,’ for that is what we call the
3301“?” who IS doing her best to get some of our
nrooulyn old women into this cat scheme of
hers, has been up in the Allegheny region ever
Since 1882, and I Judge that she has associated
to a very large extent With cats. Her aunt
With whom she lived, never allowed hcrstoclé
of cats to get below six, and of course there
were times when, counting the kittens, she had
man y more than six. ‘
“ But the aunt’s cats were amere ba'atelle
in a

'more or less this Summer about establishing a.

to cats. How many she had Miss Agitator does
not pretend to say,'but she does say that once
when the old woman was asked how many cats
she had she gravely answered, ‘ The last time I
measured ’em they was jest three barrels on

. 'cm.’

“ I have no doubt that these Pennsylvania

cats were all line creatures—large, strong, haunt
comely iurred, and well fed, and it is not at all

strange that, coming direct from the society oi
such annuals as those, Miss Agitator should be
deeply penetrated with a feeling of pity for the
catswhich she saw in Brooklyn.

‘ “ There is certainly a wide diﬁ‘erence between
the typical City cat and the typical country eat.
it on know that Lamb used to say that God made
the country, but man made the towns. Do you
know, i sometimes think, with all reverence,
that while God made the country cat, He should
not be held responsible for the existence of the
horribly-reygmlsive things which perambulatc, in
rusty, almost worn—out catskins, the roofs and
fences which we view from our back windows.

“ It was years ago that I came to N ew-York
to live with my dear husband, but I have not
forgotten how shocked _I was at the ﬁrst view I
had of a city cat. The recollection of that cat
vision came back to me when Miss Agitator ap-
proached me and begged me to interestm sell
in her Fresh Air Fund movement. She dl not
have to say one word to persuade me that the
city cat was a gross caricature upon the cat oi
the rural regions, nor to point out to me that, in
its own ghastly way, it was continually petition-
ing for the sympathetic regard of the tender
hearted. Yes, Sir, I’m a good friend of the cat.
and I told Miss Agitator that I was. But I also
told her that I was not quite prepared to in-
dorse herjudgment that a series of excursions
should be arranged for, having for their object
the provision. of a week’s sojourn in the country
for every Brooklyn cat. It is by no means clear
in my mind that the excursion idea is the correct
one. It may not be the air of Brooklyn which
has caused the decline and fall oil‘ of the cat.

“Brooklyn air does not disagree With me.
You will hardly ﬁnd a more robust woman of

l At the Belleville avenue stables they order~
ed, three horses, that had badly gelled shoul-
ders, back into their stalls. One was a gray
animal. The stablemen were careful in
the known presence of the society’s agents,
and Col. Edwards went around toward
the Bloomﬁeld line. Returning about an -
hour later, he was surprised to see the i
tame gray horse pulling a car about two
hundred feet south of the stables. The car
was stepped, the passengers invited out,
‘ and the horse was sent back to the stables .
a second time. 1.;
Today the agents are still on the look-g
out. They ﬁnd many broken-down, over-5
'worked animals in harness, but the bestf
evidence is galled shoulders that are hidden;
from the general public by the large collar.
Secretary Edwards began an action against;
the company this afternoon under the thir-i

Society is incorporated. It is an action in»:

Mr. Akerman, Superintendent of the;

sent for Secretary E. S. Ed ward-s
at noon to-d av and assured him

that the horses which were unﬁt for use
would be taken elf today. He said that the
company were somewhat in a strait with
regard to horses but no more sore ones
would be used.

 

 

CRUELTY TO CATTLE.

It is a. matter of ediﬁcation to see a
deputation of members of Parliament
giving grave consideration to the subject
of better transportation for cattle on the

transatlantic boats.
It seems from statistics that the Way the

poor beasts are treated on the trip across
the Atlantic results in great suffering and
mortality among the stock. To prevent
this is humane. and the sentiment is a.
healthy and praiseworthy one.

might be of s e use. I will at least ﬁnd

some money t; assist her in her kind work.

\her in her good work. Mrs. J. EDWARDS,

the results were always serious and occasionally

Sticky fly-paper consists of a large sheet of
paper covered with a thin coating of mucilage.
The ﬂy alights on the edge, braids his rear legs
and braids 1113 forward legs, again ignoring his
other pair, rubs the top of his head, glances at
the scenery and buzzes over into the middle of
the paper. He ﬁnds the track heavy, if we- may
borrow a, sporting term. He never rises again.
He may struggle a few minutes before he sinks
down and is smothered by the mucilage; but he
does not rise to vex this world longer—which is
the great beauty of the sticky paper. ' Now the
point which our humane friends make is that the

THE p siddnt of a local society in New
Jersey for the prevention of cruelty stepped
up to a coachman and, ordering him to stop,
lifted from the horses the stylish but torturing
checkreins and warned the coachinan if their
use was continued he would be arrested for

violating the law. The boldness, the cour-
age, we might almost say the recklessness, of
the act will be appreciated when it is known
that the horses belonged to a big man in the
,Standard Oil Company. .

 

 

INSPECTING HORSES. -

It has been the custon of the New York
scolety for the prevention of cruelty to ani-
{male to send out oﬁicers every year to in- ‘
:"fspect the horses and mules on the canals.
Oﬂicers Gay and Snowden. of ,the society.
are in Cohoes for this purpose, and they re-
port the condition of the animals as fright-
llful. The quadrupeds are worked twelve
,‘hours every day, and the dust from the
‘...§0W-Daths, sifting under the collars, irri—
it‘ates the. horses’ breasts until they are
igg’qyered with sores. Only the best care can
Islayert this trouble. and as this is seldom
,‘ given there are few cases in which the
{tgbrea‘stof the horses are not more or less
.called. The ofﬁcers ﬁnd difﬁculty in stOp-
111g, this evil. Two arrests have been
Jade in Cohoes. The captain of a boat was

[oil is conﬁned to the Erie canal. The

Horses, ' Saloons and Drinking

T °.
For m roughs'

, _ any years an empty granite basin
5:212:00? on Mail street, at the northwest
and tho the Post Office. It bears on each
Yet 6 legend, “Drink, Patient Friend.”
Croton 'ver seen it ﬁlled with

Water until recently, when the new
aqueduct was Opened.

The. ﬁlling of this 1) .
the tortures whi asin is a. revelation of

. ch horses must hav uf-
{cred 1n past seasons. Although Cioion
water hastbeen ﬂowing into it only for the
past fortnight, the horses which are accus-
tomed to haul trucks up and down lower
Broadway already know where a drink of
refreshing Water is to be found. During the
workmg hours of the day at least two equine
noses may be seen buried in the granite
basinwhile several other noses around ex-
hibit equine signs of impatience for their
turn.

Truckmen who‘have enough humanity in
them to care for their horses, say that it is
perfectlysafe to allow a horse not unduly

 

natural thirst he does not surfeit himself.
Measures are taken each summer by the
street car Companies to provide sufﬁcient
drinking water along their various routes
for their horses. The judgment of people
so well advised as the Olﬁcers of the great
street car corporations thus agrees with the
natural. appetite of the horse. .
What provision has hitherto been made
to supply horses with water during the hot
weather? Until the trough in Mail street

’ was suppliedso far as we can recollect,
, there was no drinking place for horses on,

Broadway farther down town than Madison 1
square. What \the poor brutes that now

, drink their ﬁll at Mail street must have

Often suffered in. former seasons no one can
Antidiquor fanatics are fond of iuveighlng
against the evils and dangers of the saloon. I
Yet had it not been for saloons many horses
in this city must have perished for want .of
water. The truckman could get no water
for his horse at any of the city fountains.
None of the. temperance palaces made any
effort to relieve the suil’erings of his horse.
But the business-like saloon keeper was
glad to give the truckman a pull of water
for his horse on the implied condition that
the truckman would pay ﬁve. cents for beer
tor himself. This was, no doubt, a most im-
moral action on the part Of the saloon

. keeper, and showed great want of mental

resolution on the part of the truckman.

Even the bores is not entirely free from

blame for accepting water procured on such

terms. But then the horse was thirsty and
new no better.

THE EVENING SUN has several times di—
rected the attention of the Commissioner
of Public Works to the order of precedence
in which the public supply of city water
should be distributed. This order ran:
First, for drinking and cooking purposes.
Second. for household cleansingpurposes. '
Third, fer city purposes. Fourth, for mer-
cantile purposes. Perhaps to the second
use of public water should be added, "and
to relieve the rendering of dumb animals in
hot weather.” Surely the Commissioner of
Public Works, the President of the Society 3
for the l’revention of Cruelty to Animals, ‘
and, say, Dr. HOWARD CROSBY on behalf ot f
the Ann-saloon element. might get to- i
gather and provide more drinking troughs ,3
for horses. '

BRUTAL SciENTIFIo PORT.

' . Vivisection has been claimed by many as one
of the most useful agencies in promoting the
progress of medical science. And so long as
it is conducted within reasonable lines and
practical objects are rigidly kept in view, those
practising it may be regarded as pursuing
useful investigatibns in the true scientiﬁc
spirit. But when its processes are irrational
and animals are tortured withoutpthe justiﬁca—
tion of practical and useful ends, those who
have recourse to it subject themselves to the
charge of wanton cruelty and barbarity. Some .
recent experiments made by Dr. VJ. Gilman
Thompson, and reported upon by him in “The
New-York Medical Journal,” seem to belong
in. the'latter category. , -

TheSe experiments are described as demon-
strating the practicability of brain grafting.
The attempt was made to prove that brain, as
well as skin, bone, muscle, glands, eyes or
nerves, can be transplanted and adapted to
physiological requirements of incorporation and
growth. Two dogs were trephined, small sec-
tions of brain were cut out of each and then

eye'opposite the lesion in each doc; On the
third day the dogs were killed, and the trans-
planted brain sections were found to have a
normal appearance with indications of adher-
' ence of tissues. The experiment was repeated
on a cat and a dog. «The dog’s fate is not
stated, but the cat was made blind in one
eye, and when killed on the third day the tissue
transplanted was shown to adhere by a layer j,
of ﬁbrin to the brain. :A similar pair were
operated upon and corresponding results were.
noted this time in the case of the doc. Then

head and left so that it could be raised and
depressed like a trap—door. A section of brain
was removed and replaced with a similar weight
of tissue from a cat’s brain, the trephine open»
ing being closed by the button. The dog was
very feeble for several days, but then made a
fair recovery with the'exception of loss of sight.
At the end of seven weeks the dog was killed
and the brain microscopically examined. The
transplanted section was found to adhere ﬁrm—
ly to the main tissue, but lines of degeneration
extended down into the dog’s brain.
perimenter professes to have demenstrated that
brain tissue has sufficient vitality to survive
for seven weeks the operation of grafting with-
out wholly losing its identity ;-and that while
there may be Sympathetic degeneration on the
Opposite side of the brain there is a complete
union of the tissues of animals of different
species. - ' ‘

These being the experiments and the results,
it now remains to be determined whether the
processes of vivisection can be justiﬁed with
any standard of reason and common-sense. Let
it be conceded that it has been proved that a
dog can be kept alive, albeit with loss 9f
sight, for seven weeks with a section ofa cat’s
brain buttoned into a hole made in his own
brain, and that degeneration of tissues while
inevitably taking place are remarkably , slow
in development. What then? \Vhat has been

 

gained by all this trephining, brainrgrafting
and animal torture? Is it of any practical
value to ascertain that a dog will not die at;
once but can be kept alive for seven weeks
‘ with a trap-door in his head and a bit of cat’s-
;brain underneath? Is there the remotest DOS--
{Sibility that any application of thistreatment“
. can ever be made to‘surgery ? Can two human -'
beings ever be found outside of an insane asy-g
lum who will consent to exchange brain-grafts
even With the conveniences of the button trap-
door thrown in? Or is it conceivable'that any
mortal will ever be induced to have his brain
tapped and the hole plugged up with stufﬁng
from cat or dog brain for the sake of being
blind ln one eye and the chance of not dying
Within seven weeks ?‘_ Vivisect-ion in. this case
has not been conducted within reasonable lines.
It is brutal and revolting scientific sport. .' Such
experiments cannot. lead to practiCal results.

i that the company Wlll not try to start any

‘ Supt. Bissell’s ofﬁce has been the centre of
activity 111 the Union depot. He has been

busy all day sending out despatches all

' along his d1v1s10n and marshalling his new

employees. Assistant Supt. Harrington

said that one hundred men have to-day

been given places 101' general train service.

but that no more would be put on until

the old men had been given another

chance. He said he did not think‘
that all the men had heard of the

Company’s prior to g1ve the 01d employees

prelerence if they chose to return, andad-

ded that another day's gracewould be given

them. New, hands beseiged the Superin-

tendent’s office for copies of the rules and a

 

 

newspaper men and the. lfinkerton mar-_
shale watching the tracks from the upper

 

list of the signals. “Someor these men know l
nothing about railroading. 'lhere have
been one or two collismns between the

bridge to West Albany, and now Supt.
Bissell has furnished the reporters with
special passes to get them through
the lines. There is a good deal
of feeling here over the importation of the
Pinkerton men, as there has been no trouble
and no threats have been mane by the
strikers here. The police and the Sheriff
are able to take. care of the Lyonipa-ny’s prop—
erty, it is thought, and the presence of the
Pinkertons is regarded as an attempt on the
part of the road to force a quarrel with the
men. Another the ry for the pres-
ence of the men is. fairly well sup-
ported by to-day‘s suspicious quiet along
the road. The fact that the Company
has at its disposal many men not in active
service, coupled with the fact that no move-
ment has been made to start freight, is re- _
garded by those who are watching the strike .
closely as an intimation that the railroad is

preparing’ 101' a vigorous attempt to crush

the strike in the morning.

One of the Pinkerton me'n said to-day that 1
Capt. nines expected that uniforms and 3
arms would be distributed to-moxrow morn-
ing and that the men would be ordered to

 

 

 

1 guard the track between this city and West

- [1’8 police force of the city is guarding the

‘upon the track near the depou. but they;

Albany. it was also intimated that a con-
certed effort would be made. to rush
the freight out of the West Albany yard
under guard andget it started on the Hud—
son l'tiver division. This is What the strikers
are waiting ior and it is likely to result in a
serious collision between the strikers and
the Pinkerton men it the latter take charge
01 the trains. ‘ ,

Master Workman Lee did not return to
the city today, and Supt. Biss‘ell has been:
so conﬁned with his work that he would not
talk about the strike. At a meeting of D. A.

tions were adopted:

money obtained from the New York Cen-

E in the movement of freight trains both the

perienced a surprise. The former had ere-
pected a scene of violence and the latter had
hoped for a revolt of ﬁremen and engineers.
Neither occurred. A long train of loaded
freight cars was despatched up the Hudson
River at about the time announced, Without
the slightest interference from anybody.
and later in the day a second train
was sent out. The difﬁculty of obtaining
trustworthy freight crews was then, how-
ever, made apparent to the Company. and the
outward movement of iurther freights was
abandoned for the day. In the mean time.
however. an interchange oi freights from
the St. John’s Park depot to the upper
west side stations was begun, and a north.
ward bound train, early last evening. was

 

 

assailed by an army of hoodlums and
loafers who succeeded in uncoupling the
cars and creating 3. blockade. until driven
away by the police. It is not, however,
charged that any striker had any part in
these unlawful proceedings.

_ The story told on Wednesday of the starv-
ing of Contractor Bergen’s horses would be
scarcely credible if it were not conﬁrmed
by Bergen himself. Of course there was
no motive for the crime. The owner’s in-
terests were being sacriﬁced by sheer negliw
genes; for alive, well-conditioned horse is
worth verymuch more in the market than
a dead one. But it shows the truth of the
Scriptural statement that “the tender more
cies of the wicked are cruel,” and also the:
fact that a “Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals” is a necessary as Well
as an. illustrative adjunct to the institu-
tions that tell of the Civilization of our
time.

Few people will go as far as the Scotch
woman described by Henry George, who
was a great deal more careful of the com-
fort of her cattle than of her servants, on
the ground that the servants had a future,
and as the cattle had no life but this they
ought to have every means of enjoying it;
but there is no one who has a spark of
humanity in his bosom who does not feel
grateful for the work which that society is
doing wherever it has been established,
and who will not look with a lenient eye
upon the sometimes extravagant fancies ‘
of the friend of animals, such as that of
the Scotch woman above referred to.

Henry Bergh, the founder of the Society
in America, had some strange idiosynw
Gracies, but humanity brightened every
thought and illuminated every act of his,
and he left behind him in the example of
anoble and self-sacriﬁcing career a rich
legacy which we in Brooklyn are glad to
know is being made the most of by those
who are following in the “ footprints on
the sands of time ” made by him; and
this case of which mention was made
in THE CITIZEN’S news columns af-
fords a favorable opportunity to refer in
terms of just commendation to the work
of the Brooklyn Society, and to remind
the benevolent who can afford to help it
forward in that work of the project to
which allusion has been made before, to
provide the soCiety with a home such as is
occupied by its New York name-sake.

It ought to have a headquarters of its
own, and an endowment fund which
would enable it to carry on its good work,
paying its ofﬁcers and servants well, and ‘
covering all necessary disbursements out
of the income from that fund. This is not

[such a vast undertaking that it could not

be promptly accomplished with the pecuni-
ary help of a few of Brooklyn’s wealthy
and humane people, and the project
may well be commended to those
who have the inclination ' to do a
good deed, but do not always feel certain
that their money would be well bestowed.
In this case it would be, and we hope to
see some active steps taken by the society
and by the class here appealed to to put
the former ﬁrmly on its feet, that it may
go on In its chosen path until the spirit of
humanity shall have become so universal

that there will be nothing more for it
to do.

saved immense suffering.
But the human relation to domestic an-

owner without wincing at the fate that
abandons so ﬁne a creature to so ignoble
and cruel a tormentor. The animals will
never know their benefactor. But the

1892; but there is nothing certain about
that. The only thing about it that can
be called certain is that the cars
will not be worked by the overhead system
of electric railway which has proved itself
a. dangerous nuisance on the Jamaica
railway, and on the surface railroads of
Boston, unlessthe company knows some
way in which it can outwit the poo—

, eluded to use the cable system on the Mon— ‘
‘ tague street route.

To that the public will
not object, although the cable system has
not all the advantages of the electric
storage battery system, because no one
could undertake to run cars up and down -
such a hill as that from Hicks street down

'Insnector Frank Clark, of the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Annuals, has
his hands pretty full just _now. He had ,
scarcely succeeded in cleaning out the dis- ;
abled animals of the Coney; Island Railroad
when his attention was called to the local
Bureau of Animal Industry. This is a regu-
larly established branch of _the national ‘
Agricultural Department and is In charge of
Dr. Archibald Robertson. Yesterday Clark
was informed that Dr. Robertson had been
arrested by Policeman Kiely, of . the Four.
teenth Precinct, for cruelly abusmg a. horse.
The abuse, according to Kiely, took the form
of a vigorous and unmermful belabormg
with a heavy bale stich. Clark volunteered
to conduct the prosecution against the doctor
and was on hand at his formal arraignment
in the Gates avenue police court this mom.

and asked for an adjournment of ten days,
Justice Goettins, sitting for Justice Kenna,
granted his request and paroled him in the
interim.

It was useless to interfereffor'the’ girls were
hardened in experience, tough. indeed, by
nature, and more depraved than it is possi-
ble to conceive of. Their conduct on the
wharves, in the ferry houses themselves, and
in all the adjacencies of street and alley and
pier and wharf were a something utterly im—
possible to photograph in decent society,

Did Gerry interfere then?

He did nothing of the sort, until time and

time again the charges were rung upon him

and his ofﬁcers that he preferred to interfere
with the children of the stageuto draw Hof-
mann, for instance, from concert platform; to
take hold of little ones who found noth-
ing but pleasure and jollification in their pas-
time. as it were, upon the mimic boards, where
every ﬁftycents they received went toward
brightening a darkened home, illuminating an ‘

cities of a sick father or a. hard working
mother. Finally public sentiment» compelled
this society, which depends upon public char-
ity for funds with which to pay its well salaried,
ofﬁcers, to take hold of these children, to take
hold of the peddlers of matches, the vendors
of fruit, and the thousand-and one beggaristic
forms which annoyed trade and commerce and
industry in their several homes.

And since then?

Since then there has been a continuity ofan—
noyance with honest industry upon the stage,
and every once in a while some such disclosure
as this last outrage in the, case of Mrs. Hayes
and her twelve—year-old daughter.

A CHRISTIAN CONTRAST.
Now look for a moment at Brace’s record.
"Away back in 1852 a young man of 26, well
born. Well bred. unfair sinned. and men:

 

 

sively traveled, Brace put aside clerical tempta-
tions of no ordinary strength and resolved to
devote himself to the rescue and the careof
the babies and the children and the youths,
believing ﬁrmly in the doctrine that hangs

upon the text that as the twin is bent the tree
will incline. To him was due the origin of that
most useful association known as the Chil-
dren’s Ai : Society, now grown to phenomenal
.‘proportions, a society which the authorities of
this great city recognize as one of their most
useful and forceful helps. There was a time
when Mr. Brace found it uphill work, for he
had to ﬁght both the authorities and a branch
of the sacred Church itself, but ere years had
passed and he became more thoroughly known,
universal indorsement was stamped upon his
efforts, and every church of whatever denom-
ination, and every ofﬁcial whatever might
be his party name, found pleasure in

 

taking hold of him by the right hand and help—
mg him to further effort. You found never
the name of Brace forced before his fellows.
. You found him never sitting in a box acquired
by inherited wealth, criticising his fellow man.
You found him never-parading the deck of a
steamer arrayed in a silly billy uniform, the
laughter provokement of every fellow passen-
ger; you found him never steady in the pres-
ence of the titled and the great; you found him
never an oppressor of the weak, but you found
him forever and a day with a smile beneﬁ-
cent and kindly, beaming upon the lowest and
the meanest and the dirtiest and the most de-
praVed, hoping thereby to win them from their
dirt and degradation to a higher plane of self
respect, leading ultimately to the only path
where integrity is possible, that of self sup.
port.

Contrast these two.

Look at this picture and then at that.

Look at Brace and then at Gerry.

And it seems to me the time is ripe for a
thorough understanding of humanity on th
one Side and hyppcrisy on the other. The
V81}? day that Gerry and his gang were inter-
fel‘mg With the twelve-year-old child of Mrs.
Hales. while her mother sat restfullv taking
her dinner with her eye uponrher daughter,
“483' permitted an exhibition of acrobatism on
bicycles so dangerous as to threaten the life
of child after child in the presence of an audi-
once of SIX thousand people. This exhibition
goes on not day after day, but night after
night. I‘iotbing more terrible can be imagined

in the way of bodily risk. Acrobatism as.

practiced in our concert halls, or in such thea-
ters as that of Tony Pastor, for instance, with
all the appliances of mattresses and watchful
attendants, is dangerous. What. then, must it
be in the presence of an audience varying
from three to ten thousand people, the in-
closure lighted by electricity, the excitement
mtcnsc and made still more acute and con-
taglO‘uS by the playing of music and the
shouts, perfunctory to be sure, but none the
less nmsy, of bands of lockers on, the children
stimulated byreoollection of strap and pun-

, ishment for failure? Why, it is as much more

terfered with by Gerry or any of his silly billy
men is a ﬁrm attitude of deﬁance and a pub-
licity of the outrage. Their backing down may
be as certainly counted on as the rising of the
sun or the moving of the tides.

WE NEED THESE ORGANIZATIONS.
But these societies—-
Oh, these societies are an absolute neces-
sity. There is no doubt about that. Bergh’sl

society has more power, more absolutism than 1
Gerry’s, yet who ever heard a complaint'
against Henry Bergh? Why. every driver on
the Fourth Avenue Railway, every driver of .
an old time omnibus, every driver on the 1
street of whatever nationality, in whatever
employ, regarded him with respect and esteem
and affection. I have seen him stop ﬁfty
cars with all their loads of passengers, in or-
der that a poor lame horse might be relieved,
and I never heard a man,'whethcr he were
passenger or employs, complain. Why? It
was not that Mr. Bergh was beyond mistake,
it was not that he did not now and then err,
it was not that in his enthusiasm he didn’t oc-
casionally overstep the bounds of pru-
dence; not at all, because he was human.
It was because the general tenor of his
thought was kindly and his general purpose
was to do good, and his general method was
common sense. I would be the last man to
blame Gerry if his thoughts were kindly, if
hispurposes were to do good, if his acts were i
on all fours with common sense, but he is not
built that way. We who have lived here sev-
eral years have known Gerry and all about '
him from his early days. He never yet made I
a success of anything. He undertook to man-
age the Centennial, and What a farce it was

 

 

drifting to. He undertook to engineer the re- 'ed
ception to Prince George of Wales, and noth- .
ing but the savoir fairs, the tact, the worldly .th

knowledge of the young man’s tutors, kept
him from making a visit which would have re-
sulted in a display of toadyistic, ﬂatulent,
bombastic, nonsensical Gerryism, which would .
have turned us into universal ridicule, and
made our yachtsmcn the sport of every sailor
on the seas.

Yet indeed we need these societies. .

The record of the Children’s Aid Society is
unmatched by any laid before the ultimate
judge of men and actions,'and the society over
which Mr. Gerry presides is needed also.
Heaven knows that the children of this great
wicked city can have none too much protec-
tion, but unnecessary interferenCe is not the
protection needed, and such absolute tyranny
as was attempted in the case of Mrs. Haycs’s
child is a something which the community Will
not only not support with money, but Will not
permit at all.

Why are these societies necessary? .

The very day in which Judge Reilly’s dec13-
ion was announced, and the little girl was
sent back to her mother’s home with permis-
sion to take care of the stand as often as she
pleased with her mother’s protection, it was .
announced that the Brooklyn Bridge people
had paid a check of $200,000 to a liquor seller,
Who, when asked what he was gomg todo
with his money, said that be had been selling

. A Pnovmnxrmn THOUGHT. ,
COlncidences like this are of frequent oc~

carrcnce.
Like what?
‘ Why the bringing together of names such as

Brace the philanthropist, Gerry the unwise
. prOS-‘qutor and the lucky two hundred thou-
, 1 ‘ sand dollar liquor dealer. One would sup-
pose that clergymen of whatever denomination
' need nBVer be at a loss for a text. Texts are
110% necessarily to be taken from between the
has 01’ the Bible. The peculiar nature, and
more especially human nature, is packed with
SUCzestions, fertile in opportunities, and it
struck me with the force of an alternating cur-
rent that if there is by any strange possibility
, . , 2. Providence which shapes these coincidences,
l l . " SUTCIY the announcement of the death of
Charles Lorine: Brace and the silly billy con-
3. ‘ duct of fur capped Gerry, as everybody
"-‘ knows him, and the payment of this two hun-
dred thousand dollar check to the twenty-eight
, . year vendor of rum must be providential.
Bruce’s acts were redolent of sacred perfume.
f Gerry’s seem to be ineradicably associated with
: mistakes and blunders and unfairnesses.
Brace has gone to his reward.

Whether it be the everlasting: sleep of peace,
or the crown and the palm of which the Chris-
tians sing.

' His society is ﬁrmly established in the regard
of the public. and possibly his death will be a
‘ renewed and refreshing stimulant to the gener—
, osity of New York’s ever ready givers.
' Gerry remains and his societ * also.
His personal conduct and his individual
, bearing lave done much to lower the society «
in the respect and esteem and contidence of the i
4 public, but it is not too late to mend. As the
2 Children’s Aid Society in its particular ﬁeld is
especially needed, so this Society for the Pre-
vention of Cruelty to Children has in a field all
its own an opportunity never excelled. If
a _ Gerry will only take the hint. if Gerry will only
” , learn the lesson, if Gerry will only slide down
'. from the silly eminence to which he climbed
for self notoriety, for self publicity, ex-
' posing himself in all the absurditv of
bombasticisni to the ridicule of his fel-
' lows. and, standing upon the ground of
common sense, strike hands with the authori-
~ ties on the one side and with the public on the
" other and push forward in the true interest of
‘ humanity, he will ﬁnd that it is not too late
for arepentant to be forgiven, and the time
may even come when a grateful public and an
:» observant press will joyfully unite in an obitu-
ary notice of several lines testifying to the
: , Afairness and approximate decency of his man-
a" agement and magnanimously omitting all ref-
. erence to his personally characteristic conduct
‘_ - down to date.

bers of their . tribe, ‘ a. score or

piteous echo, as it seemed, of a dying des-

pair, compelled closer attention. Never: un-
til then had I suspected the literal truth of
the text that tells how ‘iftlie‘ voice of the
turtle was heard in the léud.”

“Are you there yet?” .

“Yes, what little of life is left in me it’s
almost more than I can manage even to

' Long by a Cruel Owner.

A terrible case of cruelty was reported 3

3 few days ago to Superintendent White-
head. of the Society for the Prevention
0f Cruelty to Animals. Samuel J.
Haynes, a Racine County farmer. says
the Milwaukee Sentinel, had a beauti-
ful horse. I
Nine years ago. while hitched to a
mowing machine. the horse ran away
with Haynes. This so enraged him that
he swore he would keep him locked up
‘ from that time on. He was true to his
word. and from May 1. 1881, until last

week the poor animal was not allowed
to leave his stall.

Haynes is about sixty years old, a
bachelor, and has the reputation among
all who Know him of being an unusu-
ally kind-hearted man. but Superintend-
ent Whitehead tells the fearful story of
his brutality as follows:

“ When we reached Haynes’s place we
went to the barn and found the horse.
I never saw such a sight before. The
once beautiful scirel horse was reduced
to a skeleton. the eyes sunk deep in
their sockets, the ribs projecting and
both sides were covered with sores.
'l‘he hoofs of the animal had grown in a
wonderful manner until they had
. formed a perfect half-circle. curi'ing up-
' ward and coming Within an inch of the

shins. They appeared like the rockers
under a chair. As the owner told us af-
terwards. he had once sawed them
1 oil. or else they would have grown
. around the shins.
. “ While I untied the horse. the ﬁrst
. timein nine years. Haynes protested.
but I continued and the horse hobbled
slowly out of the stable. The moment
it touched the grass and saw the blue
sky overhead it rubbed its head against
my arm and gave a low whinny. Slowly
and laboriously propelling itself on the
rocker-like hoofs. the animal began to
nibble the grass where it could reach it.”

The horse was Killed and Haynes ar-
rested. He was fined $30.

ing of necessary humane legislation. both exist-
ing and to be secured in future. and. ﬁfth—-
Many other questions which seem to demand the
careful considerationof those interested in hu-
mane work.

Each society in the state has been requested to
send two delegates, anl the circular states that
the meeting will be strictly one of business and
no time will be wasted. or me Brooklyn organi-

“World’s use is cold, world’s love is vain,

they decided upon the formation of a

l‘half a dozen charter members. Weekly meet-

As matter of fact, the explanation is

he has been in error; for there are within

interviewed him in regard to the paving of
East Main street and because I reported his}
answers verbatim he and I have not since ex-
changed anything more than cool bows ini

“What want?” said he. “Ah,Yang Tse,” said
I, (I thought I would be familiar and call
him by his ﬁrst name, dropping theKi Ang,)
“how do you intend observing the day?”
“Put checkee down, get collah, go out,” was
the inhospitable reply. “Well, but let me
see one of those ‘Moon Cakes’ your people eat
today, will you? I want to see how they
taste.” “Clazy man, go,” was the answer,
and I’was left to my own reﬂections as Y. T.

my Visits convinced me that “the day was

 

 

 
 

numberless instances of action on the part .
of animals that prove their possession‘
of mental machinery different from
that of the human animal only in
degree. In other words, they reason from
cause to effect quite as clearly as does the
man in all matters Within their mental
grasp. Whether they have the same
facility in reasoning backward from effect
to cause, even within their own sphere of
action, is not so clear, though there is
plenty Of proof that in a limited way
they do that, too, One of the

not generally observed in this city.”

 

- One evening last week I had the pleasure
of meetmg ex-Mayor Holdsworth, of Kid-
dermlnster, England, and during our con-
versation Mr. Holdsworth spoke a little about
the modeof government of his native city.
Kidderminster has a population of about 30,-
090, and is in the hands of a mayor, six coun-
cilmen and twelve aldermen. These nineteen
meet. in a body once a month, the session be—
ginnlng at 11 ' a. m. and lasting about an
hour—never longer than two. The business
1s dispatched quickly and there are no unnec-
essary d1scussions. After the meeting it is
customary for the mayor to invite the mem-
bers of the board to lunch, during which ,
many a bottle is cracked. While Mr. Holds- 5
worth was talking, I wondered if it would;
not be a good thing for our council to drop
all the unnecessary talk which is indulged in
at almost every meeting and transact their
busmess in shorter order, but still exercising

the same care and thoughtfulness that they
i do now.

 

1869, according to THE DEMOCRAT, that
East Mam street is in a fair way to be paved
before long. This is a step in the right di-
rection and there is no plan which will in—
sure the work being done more promptly and
maKe the payment easier than that sugg est-
ed by Mr. Sweeny. I understood that if
taken h .-1d of at once, the pavement can be
laid before the snow ﬂies, and next spring,
instead of the usual quantity of mud, a

President Bookstaver, of Syracuse, pre-
sented the report of Special Agent Casey
for the month of September, showing
much progress. It commended managers
of horse railways for trying to save their
horses from abuse and pointed out the
great need for agents along the canal to
stop cruelties practiced there. The report
called attention to the need for watching
hackmen, cartmen and others who, now
that cold weather is approaching, fre.
quently leave their horses exposed; also to
the need for watching quarries where cru-
elties are practiced on horses. The ship-

The Case ' _ .530 Pressed. , i

A shocking Case n , elty to a car~horse
of the Newark ,‘i .-...> way com-
pany has beenvbrr ht to light by the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
—-Animals. Last Tuesday Ofﬁcer Kortcr cf
' the State’society, accompanied by an" ofﬁcer
of the District society of. Hudson county,
called to see Colonel Edwards on business
connected with the society. While cross—
ing the Bridge, street bridge on their way
home they dimoyered a horse with a badly
gelled shouldeifattached to one of the cars
of the NewarkPassenger railway. Ofﬁcer
Korter of the State society took the horse
from the car and arrested the driver,'but
at the corner of Broadan‘d‘ Market streets
the driver slipped away. Ofﬁcer Korter
. took the horse and collar to Justice
Somers’ court, ~

Thelrailway company made a complaint
, against the society. M. T. Barrett, coun-
‘ sel for the railway company, appeared With
Mr. Ackcrman, foreman of the company,
and threatened to have Ofﬁcer Korter ar-
f rested for stealing the horse and collar.
1 Mr. Barrett claimed that the ofﬁcer had no
. jurisdiction in this county. The ofﬁcer
claimed that he being an agent of the
state society, he had a right to make an ar-
f‘%%~withi)ut a warrant anywhere in New
Jersey for an act of cruelty committed in
his sight.

Justice Somers looked at the broad
Patch. of raw ﬂesh on the horse’s shoulder
and examined the collar, Which was cov-
ered with matter from the sore. The case
" was adjourned until next Monday. Ofﬁcer
' Korter appealed the case to the state
society, whose headquarters are in this

STAND AS A‘q‘MATTER OF SAFETY.
The HERALD received a complaint recently from

’a. citizen’relative to the shooting of a. horse in

front of thepolice station in East Fifty—ﬁrst street.
It was statedthat the horse Was killed in the pres-
ence of a crowd of school children, and that such
scones had'a demoralizing effect and should not be
permitted. "

An investigation showed that an old and dis-
eased horse was found by a policeman early in the

morning walking down Madison avenue. The
policeman led the animal to the station,
and it WAS tied to a ring in the side-

walk and notice sent to" the Society for the Pre-
vention. of Cruelty to Animals. The horse was
suffering fromglanders, and when an oﬁicer of the
society appeared at nine o’clock it was decided
necessary to kill it and it Was shot.

At the time one hundred or more children at
tending Grammar School No. 18 were passing, and,
of course they stopped to witness the'unusual oc-
currence. ‘ .

Superintendent ﬂankinsdn. ot,the society, said

ACCUSED or ssrrnve rm}? TO A HORSE
WITH ALCOHOL.

The Son of a ‘W’ell-Known New Yorker
to Answer in Court for Excessive
»Brutality to a Balky Animal—He
Penies that He Is Guilty, but the
Residents Arc Exercised.

Charles F. Bates. son of 0. Francis Bates, I
of Martin Bates & (30.. importers, No. 168‘
Greene street, was arrested yesterday by
Detective ‘ ‘ Tom” Adams on a warrant from
Gov. Hill. The arrest was made at his
Darents’ residence, at‘the Dakota Flats. on
West Seventy-second'street. The charge
against young Bates is that of extreme bru-
tality to a horse at Newport. He denies
the charge. -

It is charged that in Newport. on Sept. 22.

young Bates threw alcohol over a horse that
had incurred his displeasure and thenset,
the animal on ﬁre. The detective brought
his prisoner dovvn to the District-Attorney’s
ofﬁce. where the usual form was gone
through. He admitted his identity. and
Assistant District-Attorney Lindsay turned
him over to Ofﬁcer Edward S. Hammond.
the agent'from Rhode Island.
' "Has anybody else ever been extradited
from this State for’cruelty to animals?”
asked young Bates. ML'Lindsay said he
did not recall any case of the kind. The
ofﬁcer then started for the train with his
prisoner.

The offense with which young Bates is
charged created great excitement in New-
port at the time. The Vanderbilts and
Whitneys are people of high social standing

the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. and
they were specially indignant over the
alfair. Young Bates was quite a favorite in
society there. His father owns a cottage on
Coddineton Pomt. On Sept. “22 young
Bates had occasion to go to I‘lewbort on
business and while there he hadto use one
of his father’s horses. It was balky. and he
is said to have become very much enraged.
The hired man was unable to manage the
stubr ﬁgir animal when Bates. it is alleged.

excla: " s "I’ll Show you how to handle .
him. ’ .

The 3 claim is that he took some alco- 1

to it. h amine: with pain. the horse is said .
to haw ashed down the street. runningr
blindly against an iron lamp-post and '
smashing it. The neighing of the suffering
beast was heard by persons livme: some dis-
tance from the scene. which was witnessed by
others in a passmg train on the Old Colony
Railroad. The skin of the animal. it is
claimed. was destroyed in many places. ex-

. posing the raw and quivering ﬂesh. In this
*condition the horse was returned to the

stable. The residents became aroused when
the story got about and Bates was adv1sed
to leave town. He did so at once. coming to
this City. _ . ' .

. Acomplaint was laid with the police au-
thorltes. and Gov. Davis. of Rhode Island.
made a requisition on Gov. Hill for young
Bates’s extradition. ,

The penalty for a crime of this character
in Rhode Island is punishable by one year’s
imprisonment and $250 ﬁne. It was said
that orders were given to drown the horse.

NEWPORT. Oct. Iii—The news of the
Batesarrest was received here this evening
with evident satisfaction by members of the
Society for the Prevent1on of Cruelty to
Animals. They have made every endeavor
to secure thorough investigation of
the accusation. The matter was ﬁrst
brought to the attention of the
authorities by the story of a woman who
chanced to be walking about Mr. Bates’s
farm. She told Mayor Cogaeshall that dur-
ing her walk With her little boy she came
suddenly upon the spectacle of the
horse friehtfully burned. She said that
she did not recover from the shock
for several days. The Mayor spoke of the
matter to E. B. Wharton. of New York. who
at once began m'oceedmgs. Lawyer Calvin.
counsel of the Somety. compelled Farmer
Briggs under penalty of the lawto tell how
the animal came in that condition. riggs
made an aﬁldavit that C. T. Bates had
done it. _ .

Briggs said the horse’s ones were heard
for long dlﬁtances. More pitiful sounds,
they say. were never heard. The case ap-

‘peared so strong that Detective Richards

and Capt. Hammond received directionsIto
secure from (10v. Davrs a. 'requimtion for

Batea’s arrest. This was delayed because of 1

the Governor‘s absence. ,

Notwithstanding His Protestations of In-
nocence, He Pleaded Guilty When
Arraigned in Court.

Charles Bates, the son : : Charles F. Bates
of the firm of Martin, Bates & Co., importers,
who was arrested on Wednesday on an extra-
dition warrant charging him with cruelty to
a horse in ilewisort. pleaded guilty yesterday
and was fined $150. When young Bates was
interviewed by a reporter a few day‘s ago con-
cerning the charge, he indignantly L enied any
knowledge of it and sought to 1 row the
blame on a hired man. He said as whole
affair, from beginning}. to, .r nd, ”23.5 a con-
spiracy to injure his “good name.”

A few hours after his arrest on VVednesdaj.
a STAR reporter called upon his family, in xthe
Dakota ﬂats. {is father and mother pro-
fessed entire ignorance of the matter. and his
sister said also that it was a conspiracy, and
that her father intended to investigate the
matter fully. ‘

Young I" ates and Detective Hammond
Ircached l‘iewport early yesterday morning.
The young man was very penitent and con-

fessed to the detective that he had been guilty ;
of the act charged against hiin. He said that l
he was enraged because the horse became '
balky, so he got a quantity of alcohol,
gpl‘inkled it over the horse and set it ntire.
The poor animal died from the burns. When
arraigned in court he pleaded forgiveness and
said he was sorry for what he had do as. ' A
ﬁne of $150 was thereupon imposed, which he

 

paid. He was released, and at once reti'rned
to this city. ‘1

Kind, 13m Crn"e'i to Animals.

To m EDITOR or THE EVENING POST:

8111: Will you kindly, in justice to Mr.
Charles F. Bates, publish the following facts:
Th0 Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals admitted in court today that the
horse, that all the newspapers except The Eve-
ning Post has had burned to death, was in ex— 2

oellent condition; also that the farmer, Briggs, 2
admitted in his statement to the Society that 2
what was done to the horse he did. Mr. Bates ‘

was ﬂnl 11 because he was on the place, and
should have prevented his servant from treat-
ing the horse severely.

Mr. Bates’s lawyer complimented the Society
on their management in spending $83 of their
money, when they all knew that the gentle—
man in question would be only too glad to ap-
pear, and his presence could have been obtained
at the expense of a two~cent stamp or a twen-
ty-ﬂve cent telegram. Every one who knows
Mr. Bates knows that he has spent money free-
ly in the cause of suffering animals, and has
been neted from boyhood for his excessive
kindness to them.

  
 
 

The papers'of today are

only too ready to publish scandalous accounts
of Events, but never ready to acknowledge

their falsity. The Evening Post is an excep-.

tion tothis rule, and has the respect of the

community accordingly. M.

The llIules Lamentations.
I am only a poor old mule,
Ugly in color and form I know,
With breast all raw and spirits weak,
Who’ll listen to my tale of woe?

Since Baalim’s ride to Frederick’s time,
The lash has caused our blood to ﬂow,

Yet true and kind I’ve always been,
Please listen to my tale of woe.

Hitched with a horse, as sore as I,

Through summer’s rain and winter’s snow ,
Wave plodded on but ne’er complained,

So listen to my tale of woe.

Thank God there lived 11 Henry Bergh!

And intercede for me,poor mule,
Who cannot tell my tale of woe. ,

 

No rest for me, when men on oath
Declare that I must undergo

All the cruelties of former day;
They will not heed my tale of woe.

But I’m the handiwork of God
And He’ll avenge each cruel blow;
I only ask that death be sent,
And that will end my tale of woe.

ado CARRY AvSICK HORSE. in,

A New Anibulance .to Be Used by the
S. P. C. A.——Its Construction.

An ambulance for horses was onexhibition
for a short time yesterday afternoon in front
of the oiiice of the Society fer the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals, on Lexington street,
near Charles. The cumbersome-looking per—
ambulator attracted ‘much attention. It had
a patient in. The ambulance was that of the
Maryland Veterinary Hospital, and the ﬁrst
complete one in the state. It is to be used in
conjunction with the Society for the Pre—
vention of Cruelty to Animals, as well as for,
Dr. Thomas Wm. Spranklin’s veterinary hos—
pital, on Harford avenue. it is thorou hly
equi ped for conveyance of Sick, disable _ or
invalid animals, whet-her standing up or in a
recumbent position. Whenever a call comes
for the use of the ambulance, the horse—sur—
geon, nurse and driver, in uniform, imme-
diately start away with the ambulaiice,which
is drawn by two heavy horses, hitched up the
same way as in the Fire Department. It does
not take them long to reach the sick or in—
jured animal. The time of loading a horse is
from live to ten minutes, and in that time he
is put in the ambulance and secured safely,
3, great desideratum. As in the old—style
ambulances, animals would prove restive and
fret, excite, and in a great many cases do
themselves more damage than t 6 original
trouble amounted to. For animals which
must not be exposed to inclement weather,
there is a portable top which shields the
patient from excess of heat, cold or mm. A
horse lying on the street, unable to get up or
walk, can be put on the sliding platform in
his stable and pulled into the ambulance,
which may be one—half a block away, by men
‘ turning on a crank handle ﬁxed stationaryin
the ambulance and a rope attached to the
platform. The ambulance will, no doubt,
prove of great value to horse owners in the
city and vicinity. It is all of Maryland work—

of Hillen street, after improvement on the
New York ambulance. The harness and
other appliances were also specially made for 3
it. The wagon weighs 3,400 pounds, and since
its completion about two weeks ago has done
good service. havmg hauled abouta dozen ,
sick and disabled horses. Among those who
were present to inspect the ambulance yes—
terday were: Jesse Tyson, J. B. Christian,
Robert A. Taylor, Secretary J. R. Duval and
Captain Earhardt, all of the society. A pho
tograph 0f the outﬁt was taken by Cu ‘

i
There Are Increasing Reasons Why Congress
Will Not Permit the Present Wrong ‘
to Remain Unrighted. -/.

 

It is more than pro}. able that with the
letter which Mayor Grant will send to
‘Secretnry Noble. of the Interior Depart- ,3.
Lment, t0-day, there will go some of the 7-"?
: great quantity of evidence which the city
'has collected, shoxving that the federal ‘
census which was taken in June was in- 4
correct and perhaps .rnutlulent. "

This seems to the most astute lawyers of
'1 the community the best means to meet the
issue whichChlef Clerk Childs has made
in his insolent letter to Mayor Grant. He :
called {or ofﬁcial evidence, and it looks .,
now as thoagh this, evidence will be sub-
mitted to the Secret try of the Interior.

Tmhus will New \ ork do everything in.
her povrer to secure justice.

The point has been raised by a. correspondent of
the lii‘iuLDthat an application by the municipal
authorities to the Supier‘ne Court of the United
States for a. mandamus compelling the Census
Bureau to make a recount might have the desired
eil‘ect. l'nfortunutely ”his point was considered
by the careful framers ot' the Census bill. There
is one little clause in it ~which prevents any inter-
ference with the Census Bureau's trickery. it
reads:

';\\'henever it shall appear that any portion of the,
enumera.ion and census provrded for in this act
has bee". neg.igently orimproperly taken, and is by
reason ti r or incomplete, the Superintendent
of the t c ; us with the approval of the
:ecrrtnLy .f the Interior inn} cause such
* 1* * an enumeration * * * to be
ninde unexv under such nlethorls as may
in his discretion he practicable.” ‘

IAWMAKERS THOUGHT or rms POINT.

'l‘his luw was put together very carefully and
with a due consideration for the future. The‘
being special legislation and vesting
' certain oﬂlcer“

I

Census not
specific powers in the discretion -
removes the operation of the act from any possi-
bility of revir-w by the Supreme Court. Congress, ‘
the body which created the bureau, is the only‘
body which can compel it to do its duty. l

So say such eminent lawyers as James R. Cum-
ing, George l‘liss, etc-Judge Charles Donohue, ex-i
Judge Llittenhoefer and Richard S. Newcombe.

But they all have confidence in what Congress,
will do. Judge Donobuo was eSpecinlly hopefulﬁ
After he had spoken enthusiastically of the
Ilsmr.n‘s work in securing the attention of the p
whole country to the injustice which had been
done to this city, he said:-——"I cannot believe that
Congress will refuse to right this wrong—in fact I

l am almost certain that it will. An extra. session

Three Complaints Per Day—Wilbert I
the Society Is Doing.

 

The Humane Society which was organ— ‘
ized one week ago last Saturday has re- -
ceived twenty—one complaints since that
time, and a number of additional cases have
been personally attended to by the agent,
' General Cook, which have not been reported.
ltis estimated that fully 75 per cent. of the
complaints are genuine, and that 25 per
cent. are fraudulent.

The reorganization of the Humane So-
ciety seems to have struck terror to the *,
hearts of those who habitually abuse their “?
families and their beasts of burden. No
sooner are they reprimanded in the name of 1‘
the society than they deSist. They seem to .

Two complaints have been entered in re-

THE MAIMED AND HALT.
A number of persons have been reprimand-
‘ed for driving crippled, lame, and found—Lei,
;‘ ered horses. A. horse was taken away from
3 1ts driver yesterday on account of a severe
7, case of what is known as “scratches.” :
1 A man and woman were seen the other day _
-‘ driving two light ponies to a fourteen—inch
4 sulky plow, which should have been drawn,
- «.pby three large horses. Somebody passed
1 the ﬁeld and heard the little ponies panting f
, with agony. General Cook was summoned ,
j and the pretty pair of ponies are abused no
‘~ longer. ;
-_ A woman complained that a man in her
5’, part of town had beaten a span of mules-
‘f'l. '. .. ‘_ ' ,, -

- E released from bondage at the corner of
} Twenty—third and Champs streets. . ’ '

lhistory for the sporting World. The para

, ”DRIVEN no DEATH. .
Two weeks ago a horse was hired by a
young man from Amant’s livery stable and '
-. driven to death. When the horse died the
”I 7; young man immediately left Denver, but 1
the chances are in favor of his arrest and ; _
"‘t punishment. -

The society has received an intimation'
from a well-known Catholic priest to watch .
A a man in Eleventh street who beats his wife. ,

The attention of the society is called to l

the children who are sent out on the streets

2 to beg. It is thought that this nuisance may 3
be entirely done away with if proper action f
1 is taken. , 1

crrr OFFICIALS (IO—OPERATE. .

The Police and the Sheriff have oﬁered '

3 their hearty co-operation to the society, s

‘ which offers have been received with thanks.

. General Cook says he is on the lookout for ’

gamblers who amuse themselves by beating

- their mistresses. '
Had it not been for Secretary McCord a :

thrilling tragedy in the shape of a dog—ﬁght

. would have occurred at the polls on election

, day. Mr. McCord parted the dogs and saw

l to it that each went his separate way.

, The fast driving on Broadway on Sundays
is a proliﬁc source of cruelty to horses. The ,
animals invariably take cold after such rapid
traveling and the results are often disas-

' trons. .
General Cook looks after the animals at
all the parks, being furnished with convey-
ances by the liverymen, one of whom ac-.

~ companies him on all his drives. The agent 3

farm OF MEXICO, April 29, 1887.—The novelty of a
bull ﬁght by electric light drew an immense crowd
etc-“the Colon Plaza. Among the "Spectators were

Bresident Diaz and several members oi? his Cabinet.
The arena' was brilliantly lighted by ten electric

lights and the gaudy uniforms of the matadors

fairly blazed.
‘ . The door of the bull pen was thrown open and the

" ﬁrst bull made a frantic rush at the picadors and in

;a minute was master of the arena, having killed one .
horse and gored two others. One matador and a

i pieador were laid out, though not killed. The ﬁghters
became very timid and plied the sword from the

sidelbeing afraid to face the animal as is usual. Of
. ﬁve bulls every one was desperate in the blazing

the Beardof Health began by measuring the
litank inWhich the salamanders are kept for
the purpOse of ascertaining its capacity.

He was a. little nervous in doing this, and he
dropped a two-foot rule in the water. It was
: ﬁshed out again by Mr. Dietzel, the bookkeeper,
and dried, but Oﬁicer. 475 declined to touch it

any more.
Then he examined the drain in the yard. and
gave orders that the water from the tank

should be taken out in galvanized iron buckets.
He also ordered Mr. Reiehe to sprinkle dism-
iectants all around his place to counteract any
0f the geilamander p01son which might be lying
aroun oose. '

All this sort of thing made Mr. Reiche tired,
and he determined to test once 101‘ all the
deadly qualities of his Japanese pets. For this
purpose he picked out two young rabbits.

1 i posed to let the salamander bite the rab its,
or at any rate meet some saliva upon them.

The rabbits were taken into the salamander
room, and‘the door was lightly shut. The poor
little things seemed to understand , what an
ordeal lay before them, for the shook hke an
Arkansas family w1th the dum . ague.

The largest salamander was lifted out of the
tank in a blanket and put on the ﬂoor. The
ugly batrachian paid not the slightest atten-
tiOn to the plump young rabbits, although one
of the latter was held temptmgl near 1118 nose.
Then the salamander was poke with a. broom-

rabbit in disdain.‘ He meandered around the
room at a: sluggish pace, but couldn’t be in-

rabbits any more than rabbits can eat sala-

It’so'all the salamander can do to get away with

UMB BBUTE.
OUTBAGE PEBPEI‘BATED BY A CRAZY NEGRO AT
BELLEVILLE, N. J.

A case of almost unparalleled cruelty was dis-
cr‘wered in Belleville, N. 3., yesterday. Augustus
Sloan and his, brother Samuel live on a farm at the

corner of Linden avenue and. Holmes street. Belle.
ville. They are the owners of a large number of
horses and cattle. With them lives a burly negro
named Thomas Vanderveer, who is generally known
as “Crazy Tom.” He is over six feet tall, of massive
build and great strength. That he is crazy seems to
be settled in the minds of those who know him, and
he is looked upon as a. dangerous character. .

On Saturday, being asked by one of the Sloan's to
hitch up a valuable'horse, as he wished to drum to
New York, “Tom” became enraged. declaring that
the animal was not in ﬁt condition to be used. As

 

 

 

stable and maltreated the horse in a. herrible man-
, nor. With a sharp pointed iron bar he nearly
severed its tongue, and by jabbing produced several
Wounds on its body, covering it with blood. ‘

Helpless, Dumb Animals on All Sides of Us Suffer-

Who can foresee or prevent the Whimsical de-
mands of fashion? From an aesthetic stand-
point, natural grace is understood to be the ﬁrst
element of beauty; but what has fashion to do
with natural grace? -

Nothing, judging from an illustration which
may be seen continually on our streets. A
horse whOse nose is pulled into a line with his

 

 

spine, or pointed to the sky by means of an '

over-draw; or one whose head is fastened back
by a side—check until his swollen and strained
muscles give him a ewe-neck, is by no means
“a thing of beauty,” nor “a joy forever.” It is

’ simplya disﬁgured and tortured animal, whose ..

pain is far from-being a joy to him or to any
sensitive observer. It seems strange that any
fashion should be adepted Which results in the
suffering and permanent injury of helpless
creatures whose lives it is our duty to protect
and make comfortable in return for the constant
services they perform for us.
be of interest to the public to know the origin
of the over-draw. ”We quote from one of the
publications of the American Humane Associa-
' tion ‘ _

This over-check contrivance was originated a few
years ago by a noted horse jockey, whose horse,

when rapidly driven, with the driver pulling upon
therein, made a whistling 110188. To obvratc‘thls
annoyance, he devised an iron martingale whicn
heldthe nose upward. To amid being laughed at
while his horse wore this ridiculouscontrivance, he
advocated the idea that arapidly driven horse could
breathe more freely with its head held up. He

Summer is plethoric with discomfort for him. 3
What is done for his comfort? ’

Night Superintendent Sol Reilly, of the Third
Avenue Surface Road, was coming out of the horse
hOSpital or that line at the stables on East Sixty-ﬁfth
street, when he was asked by a HERALD reporter to
tell the public the amount of work per diem that i:
expected of his horses these scorching days and
what is done to help the faithful animals to bear thl
burdens and heat of summer.

Mr. Reilly said that the hot weather and the open
air cars brought an increase of travel, and the horn“
were affected measurably by it. Buteverythingpos-
sible was done for their relief. So far the weather
had not affected the animals as much as some of the

The Broadway Railroad horses had a hard time of ‘

it Yesterday.
The track for a distance of about seventy- -ﬁve feet
in front of the Fifth Avenue Hotel was dug out so as

to form a trench about two feet below the surround-
his level. Into this birr ditch the rain fell by the
bucketful until it formed a very pretty miniature of
the “raging canawl,” known and loved of co entry-
men. '.l‘hiough this ditch the car horses “ ere forced
to stumble, with the imminent risk of breaking their
legs. to say nothing of the valuable human bones in-
side the car.

As soon as Superintendent Hankinson, of Mr. .

Bergh’ s society, heard of the condition of things, he
sent two of his men over to protect the horses, and
at the same time despatchcd a message to the road
l master at the car stables advising him to send some
. one to superintend the passage of the cars over this
lpa'rt of the track. The road master answered that
jh‘e would do so, and an assistant track master was
l. sent to the spot.
. 7 A CONFLICT OF AUTHORITY.
3:.Uni’ortunately a dispute arose as to whether the
. Qrses should go through the mire or be led around
{the ditch. The track master wanted them to go
through and wished to "boss" the whole business.
he agents of the society threatened him w" th arrest
if he did not obey their orders, and he concluded to
give in to them.
. Finally a compromise was effected. Those horses
E Which balked at the descent into the “canawl” were
.I'e'd around, but the rest were made to plunge
through, with two men to guide them. Sometimes
the horses became Irightened half way, and, kick-
7,111.2 and stumbling, they tried to get up the bank on
either side. This they were prevented from doing
ElinY by vigorous whipping and shoving from the
drivers and C’track men.

The green car Forty- -second street ferry line sent
dewn chains with which to draw their cars across,
:and thus their horses were spared the toil and
Edanger of crossing. .

MR. BERGH’ s WATCHFUL ‘IIEN.
. Mr. Hankinson kept the agents of the society
watching all the evening, although the road master
and assistant superintendent of the Broadway line
igenied that any of their horses had fallen during the
ay.
“Yoga. see,” said Mr. Hankinson to a HERALD re-
perter' "where ver there is water which is not tr ans‘
parent a horse fears to tread, not being able to
go of its depth. That place on Broadway is a

,n‘g'erous one and will have to be closely watched ,.

Selling is permitted, that is, 11 here the racing is legitimate
iand meant to improve the breed of horses, and no other

“I have the subject under consideration,” said Mr
:Maitine, “but have come to no conclusion yet. I re- 1
‘ eciv'ed One of the Controller’s circulars and shall write to
l the AttOrney-Greneral about it. ”
Acting Supeiinieudent Steers said, “ I Shall do all I can
i with safety to stop any violation or evasion of the pool
law at the newr race course. lt is claimed that the course
is under the control of a regularly incOrporated racing
3 association, and that under the Ives law the police can-
not interfere with 13011 selling on actual races there. It
13 understood, however, that the people who go there to
bet on races will not expect to bet on any horses that are
run on the track, but 011 horses of the same names running
on other tracks. That will be a violation of the law, as
I understand it, and the police will arrest the pool sellers

out or the city, but I have- ins ructed Inspector Cenlin to

watch the races with enough help to arrest the pool sellers

them warning of my intentions. They may get a little

the police to act with caution until evidence to warrant

arrests is obtained, but they will be stopped as quickly as

possible if they evade the law.”

At the cities of the Society for the Prevention of Cru-

Evade the lves Pool Law,

....—__._..__...g...__.._—.-_

The four legged marionettes on the “Turf Club’s ” 1
track in Harlem were set in motion yesterday, but
the HEBALD’S expose of the plans to sell pools on the
Sheepshead Bay races there knocked that covert
scheme higher than Gilderoy’s kite.

IuSpcctor Williams, in whose district the circus
ring lies, is on his summer leave of absence, so
Inspector Conlin marched up to the track. with

' twenty-ﬁve men under acting Captain Shcehan, of
, the Eighty-eighth street station. Inspector Coulin
had consulted with Police Justice Welde, who loaded
him up with the law on pool selling, and sent him

‘ away cooked and primed.

The Inspector summoned Ridge Levien, the chief

promoter of the shady enterprise, into the centre of
. the hold. They stood in the "box” whence- the
Metropolitan Baseball Club’s pitcher. 011cc shot his
curves, and the police ofﬁcial asked the gambler for . ’
the documents incorporating the Racing Association
whose initials, ”T. T. 0.,” ﬂanped on blue baize
ﬂags atop the stands in the cool breeze that
swept over from the Paul entiary not far away. Le-
vien produced the papers, legally drawn which
' gave him the right to run horses over the track for
thirtv days. ’lhen the Inspector. hot the la point
b1? nk at him, and told him, under pain of immedi-E
ate arrest, that he must not permit pools to be sold
on races outside the fence that bounds the ﬁshing
ground for “sucks r’s.’ '

“If they sell pools on races outside,” observed the
inspector oalmb and frigidly to a reporter of the
H.111 'ALD, “1’1 1 end hem al to State’ a l’Irison. l‘hat
:is no longer a misdemeano; the Ives Pool bill makes
it a State’s Prison. oil‘e cc.”

THE constant EKPLODED.
That settled it .
The pool sellers, in their boxes ranged along the
.top of one of the slanlwis promptly thleu ot’f the
mask and posted the odds against such ho: see as
had been gathered to cover their real purpose.
. The policemen scattered here and there. Some
lounged on the benches, others leaned their
elbows on the fence like chromos of

QUARANTINBI) COWS.

Dairyman Heller and Dr. Bell, of the Ilealth
Board, at Odds.

Some time ago Herman Roller, of No. 838 Flushing
avenue, was arrested by an ofﬁcer of the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals on a charge of
selling milk from diseased cows. He carries on a
dairy business at his residence, and had exchanged
a dry cow for one in milk. The exchanged cow
broke her leg after the trade and was destroyed by

1 one of Mr. Bergh’s ofﬁcers on thejorder of Veterinary

Surgeon McLean, of Nevins street. Dr. Bell, of the
Board of Health, subsequently quarantined three of-
Reller’s cows, which he said Ewero suffering from
contagious pleuro-pneumonia. On the ﬁfth

1 of September Dr. Plageman, the veterinary surgeon

of State street, was called in by Rellcr to make an

; examination of the :attle and premises and failed

to discover any symptoms to justify the quaran-
tine. One of the cows quarantined was {differing
from stiff back. the result of a chronic injury, and
Dr ' Plageman told a CITIZEN reporter to—day: “I.
believe all the cows quarantined were healthy and
in a condition to yield wholesome milk. The injured
cow yielded but one pint in the clay. I advised him

3 not to sell her m1 '1: as a matter of 'prudence. The

 

case will come up before Judge Naeher on
Wednesday, and I consider that some one
has been trying to ruin Reller’s business-

At the Board of Health Commissioner Otterson
said that Reller’s stock had been quarantined
and his permit to sell milk revoked. Dr. Plageman
in his ofii cial report says that on the 6th inst. he ex»
amined nine cows, the property. of Herman Roller,
of No. 8‘38 Flushing avenue, six of which were in
one building and three in a separate one, isolated
and quarantined and reported as suffering from
contagious pleuro-pneumonia. "'On examination.’

on the corner of Chambers street and Broadway, and, at
one and the same time, there was a. sick horse, a fat
woman in a state of advanced iuebriety. and a rushing

wagon drove up under the guidance of a. negro With a
moustache of surpassing magnitude. The big dray

into the ambulance, and securely bOund with ropes.
He looked at the negro duver with an eXDressmn
of almost human fondness in his face, as the latter sup.

his comfort. Finally the ambulance drove slowly oﬁ,
carting the big drav horse to the hospital. ' A th‘Ousand

a widespread desire on the part of farmers for ’
some method of ridding their cattle ofborns, ‘
he entered actively into the work of pushing" ‘
his peculiar ideas by precept and example,
visxting many places for the purpose of talking
. to farmers on the subject, and instructing ‘
them in the use of ‘he saw. The Illinois

1 Humane Society, through its otﬁcers in ’
Chicago, instituted proceedings against Mr. .
Haaf on the charge of cruelty to animals. On
l the fourth day of the trial, when the testimony
for the defendant was all in, the prosecution

offered to dismiss the case, but. Mr. Heat in- '
sisted on his right to a verdict, and it was
rendered by the jury in his behalf. A'large
number of farmers gathered in a hall imme—
diately on the announcement of the verdict
and passed resolutions indorsing the ractice
of dishorning and condemning the umane‘
Society ofﬁcers in bringing suit against Mr.
Haaf. In his address, which was listened to
with close attention andintense interest Mr.
Haaf laid down the foilowing propositions,
and addressed himself to the task of proving
them: ‘Dishorning Willyearly save the lives
of 200 human beings in the United States: it
will save the lives of 200 000 cattle and horses;
it will save nearly all i
tion; it will save one fourth the hay and one
tenth of the grain fed ' on cattle that run loose
. it will save one half t c manure; it will save
' one half the shed room; it will save loss in
shipping cattle; it is not cruel, but humane; it
does not compare in point of severity with
either castration or branding.’ He had with
him a number of skulls and horns with which .
‘he illustrated his talk on the nature and
formation of the horn and showed the point
at which to lay the saw in order to remove the
born without the loss of more than a few
tablespoonfuls of blood, and preVent its
further growth. Specimens were presented"
showing that the healing had taken place by

the process of granulation. The s eaker i

There is no doubt about the growing pop-

are steadily winning their way to public favor.

MR. WINTERBOTHAM’S REJOINDER. _
EAU~ CLAIRE, Wis, Mano H 6 1888.-—~<
Edztors News: In your issue of Feb. 21‘);
my friend Mr. F. ,T. Vasey essays to .r‘ ‘
1le 130 my criticisms on the cruel practiced
of dehorning or deforming cattle. Mr
motive 1n first addressing you was to raise,
my voice against so cruel and needless a;
practice. I was well aware that it was ;
practiced to some extent 111 the west, where g
the comforts andlife of man and 10861le are
so little regarded. Ialsolrnew it had been
practiced to some extent in some othez
parts of the country, but that public
opinion was so strong against it that those
who followed it were compelled to aband
on it. ‘ .
Mr. Vasey’ 8 letter forces an answer from
me and instead of. accepting the opmrone‘;
of the gentlemen to Whom he refers me, I
I have asked certain other rrentlemen t, ,.
. give me their opinions on the subject an

Mr. Vasey’ s idea that it is not nec.’ ~<
veary for him to look up the laws as thi,
are only made for evil doers 1s a on ’ 5"-
one and if: every one had the same?” on

  

  

the statutes He wonders'“ if I-‘{ .E
thought of the cruelty practiced up new
Eby forcing a huge iron ring; through, '5 't

 

I would answer Yes, and consider- such

practice worthy of the man who would.
mutilate his cattle. The practice of ring .-
ing only serves to prevent the uni} l
from searching 1n mother earth for that;
which nature has placed there for it, and-5
no swine breeder was ever beneﬁtted b" ‘
it.

  

Again he thinks “ it 18 not strange th at a
man conﬁned behind the counter all dav
should know so little of the advancement
other tradesmen are making 1n their on s
cupations. ” My thirty years experience ,
in stock raising on a farm, has taught melt}
that men rarely succeed when they ail-5'5.
tempt to improve on the handiwork oft,
'JOd. ~ ':

M1‘.Vasey says that twice in the lee ~
twenty years he has narrowly escaped
the horns of ferocious bovrnes, but it seem
as though the bovines had not been so for-
tunate 1n escaping Mr. Vasey.

I would say that if a man becomes so
vicious and bad as to endanger the lives.

 

     
    
  

way. But is that any reason why all men
should wear handcuffs _ . "
I have been the owner of some vicious
animals myself and always found that by
screwing an ornamental brass knob 613,3
the points of the horns they not onlyH
soon learned that they were deprived ell: ‘
the power to do much harm, but looked _'
the better for the decoration. ;. . ; " _
Mr. Vasey’ s idea of philanthrOpy 18 ceré ,f
tainly a curious one. He is very active -
in his efforts to prevent intelligent man ,
from injuring himself by intoxicating .;
drinks, but 18 himself ready and willing '
to cruelly torture and maim helpless and }'
unoﬁ’ending animals, and to encourage
others to do the same. ,
There are many things Whmh. W0 ar
compelled to do that are cruel; but: .
which are unavoidable, but why should'
we practice a cruelty and mutrlatu.‘

but was again a ﬂat failure and was allowed to
sink into oblivion until eight or nine years ago,
When Mr. Bergh revived it for a private reading.
The failure of the poem did not discourage Mr.
Bersh, for he afterwards wrote a play on the same
subject. He also wrote “The Portehtous Tele-

It was as the friend of the dumb brute that Mr.

as impelled to take the stop,
he said, by witnessmg the cruelty practised on ani-

 

mals in Russia. Upon his return to this
country he went to Albany. and asked tor
the necessary legislation, which was readily

a fact which caused Mr. Bergh

granted,
to regret that he had not asked for more,_for when
he needed more it was not so easily obtained. On
the very evening of his return from Albany he sta-
tioned himseli at the corner of Fifth avenue and
Twenty-third street to watch for his ﬁrst case. He
had not long to wait. Atruckman drove up, his
horse balked and the man began to lay on the
whi .
“pMy friend, you can’t do that any more.” po-
litely protested Mr. Bergh, crossing the street to y
where the man and horse were. .
‘ "l‘he devil I can’t, ” was the laconic answer, and
the whip was laid on with renewed vigor. Mr.
Bergh protested and was politely told to go to r

hades.
“I saw that it was necessary to make an impres- ,4

 

 

' sion in order to bring the law before the public.”
i said Mr. Bergh afterwards. in speasing of the in- l;
g evident. The impression came when Mr. Borgh and ;
tseveral of his ofﬁcers went _to Fulton Market and
found, on board a. vessel, 100 tustles on
2 their backs, where they had been for three
l weeks without 100d. He arrested the cap-
! rain and crew of the vessel and toes them to
i the Tombs, where they were tried and acquitted,
and Mr. Berg‘s was told to go home and mind his
‘ own business. This rebuff and the consequent
l ridicule so annoyed Mr. Bergh that he cried With .
l vexation, but he had no idea of giving up, and his
E society soon gained a footing and the ridicule and
3 rebuﬁs were changed to praise. In a year or two
the tide began to turn and money and sympathy
began to ﬂow in.
Through all his career Mr. Bergh was the per-
sistent opponent of vaccination and inoculation, and
l; he never missed an opportunity to denounce such
; men as Jenner and Pasteur. He Opposed vivisec-
1 tion, too, and was constantly in a wrangle with the
1 doctors over it. ‘
l A TERROR T0 BIPED BRUTES.
; He broke up dog-ﬁghting and cock-ﬁghting in the
city of New York and waged relentless warfare
against pl eon-shooting, fox—hunting and kindred
sports. k e had a poor opinion of the disciples of
Isaak Walton, and often declared that ﬁshermen
were natural liars. It was largely through his ei-
forts that clay pigeons came into use.

During the early years of the society Mr. Bergh
used to patrol the streets watching for acts of
cruelty among; the truck and stage drivers. and his
tall, gaunt figure and taclturn face were well
Known on Broadway. Of late years he had relin-
ﬁiishcd such work- almost entirely to his agents.

9 was a. brave man, always excessively polite,
but ﬁrm as a rock, and the drivers throughout the
city soon came to know and respect him. HIt is
not the poor,” he used to say, “ that are the most
cruel or that give us the most trouble; but the rich,
‘ with their fox hunts, their racing and their shoot~
mg matches. ”

About a. dozen years ago a party or Mexrcan bull-
.ﬂghters came to this city and attempted to give
bull lights. but inatead of the usual darts with
rosettes attached, which are stuck into the sides of
the animal, Mr. Bergh compelled the matadores to
use mucilage on the rosettes and plaster them on
the animal’s side. it is unnecessary to say that

bull-lighting in New York was a failure.

The clipping and docking of horses was another
subject to which Mr. Bergh devoted much atten-
; tion. He was also instrumental in breakmg up the
;, swim-milk trafﬁc in this city. His shorts in behalf
‘ or dumb brutes of every description were unremit-
: ting. Some years ago he tried to induce the Board
2 of Aldermen to establish a humane cat pound, but
1; the idea was never carried out. He was a vegeta—
l’rian in theory and frequently advocated the aboli-
; tion of meat food.
3‘ His society was distinctively a on e-man power. The
lSociety tor the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
, gwas Henry Bergh, and Kent ‘Bergh was the So-
~goiet-v for the Prevention 0 Cruelty to Animals.
, Ten years ago he said: “ I hate to think what W111
{become of this society when I am gone. ’7 His
hobby, however. oi’tcn led him to extreme lengths,

. and brought down upon his head much ridicule
:and derision. He stopped the rat shows of Jen-
! hinge, the rat—catcher, and a year or two ago he
:became engaged in an exceedingly lively cont-ro-
;versy with Gleason, the horse-trainer, while the
9 latter was exhibitingr at Cosmopolitan Hail, but did

HENﬁv Business. , ,

The death of Henry Bergh. of New York. ,
removes a. rare‘ and noble personage from
the walks of‘life. He expired at his re’si-l
deuce on Fifth avenue Monday, and his '
obsequies took place from. St. {Mark’s .
Church Friday morning.

Born in New York city in 1823, of Ger.
man parentage, he studied in Columbia
College and left it to travel in Europe. _He
visited all the countries and spent ﬁve years
abroad. During the rebellion he served as _
secretary of the American Legation at the

Court of St. Petersburg; part of the time i"

was Acting Vice Consul. He resigned end i
returned to New York in 1864. Here. he.
began the crusade which has maderhis
name a household word in American'homes
and given him a. world-wide reputation.

animals by brutal masters in his native city

be resolved to do all in his power to check -

the barbarous practice. One of the Spec-
tacles that made a deep impression on his
lovable nature was the custom of the street
gamin sticking straws in the eyes of sick
horses prostrated by the heat of the summer
months. Other cruelties, equally inhuman,
came under his vision and be determined
to do something for the friendless suﬂ’erers .
unable to speak in their defense.

Mr. Bergh was well ﬁtted to inaugurate
measures for the relief of dumb animals.
He possessed. a fortune, was a. gentleman of
scholarly tastes, a superior public speaker,
fearless in his convictions and ready to de-
lend them no matter from what quarter as—
saults came to him.
intentions to friends who shared his benev—
olent nature an association was formed titled
“Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals.” Mr. Bergh was chosen presi-
dent and laws were engrafted on our statute
books inﬂicting severe penalties for any-

body found abusing an animal. This was ‘

accomplished early in 1866 and President
Bergh devoted his entire time to enforce its
provisions. He encountered many obsta-
cles, was roundly abused by the press,
as well as the human brutes when he in-

terceded in behalf of the horses who were \*

needlessly and severely punished. At this
time it was customary for a brawny truck-
man to use a. cart rung on the helpless
animal who proved to be a triﬂe stubborn.
After Mr. Bergh caused the arrest of a
score or more of these unfeeiing drivers the
practice largely ceased and soon disap-

complished withouthard ﬁghting and Mr.

court in the prosecution of offenders
against the law he founded and upheld.
Several humane measures were enacted
among them being the erection of drinking l
fountains for horses in different parts of .
the city, the care of live stock in cars on...
tering and departing from the city and the

aboli'shment of the use of the gag bit, a,
' gelling and painful device for torturing the '
After seeing the enforce- '
ment of the law in New York he enlisted!
the aid of philanthropic gentlemen in other '-
States and about every commonwealth in

, the Union has incorporated it on the statute l

 

books. Today when a horse is taken sick in

in New York he is carried away in an em.
bulance and put under the care of a voter.
inary surgeon until he is better or the case ‘
terminates fatally. .
In 1874 Mr. Berg-7h, witnessing the cruel-
‘ ties practiced on children, organized a So-
ciety for their protection. It has accom_
plished a. vast amount of good, saVed hun-
dreds of innocent children from going to
destruction, to say nothing of the misery

and guardians invoking the law’s interfer—
ence. For his shorts in his philanthroyie
enterprises New Yorkers have frequently
informed Mr. Bergh 0f the pleasure it

Many Animal‘s Die and Hundreds Under‘
Medical Treatment-The. Cause
of the Disorder.

A. big, gentle-faced black horse, With 7.
head badly skinned and hind-quarters"
trembling violently, as though a million
muscles were in agony, was yesterday
under treatment in the New York Veterinarv
Hospital, on West Twenty—ﬁfth street.

The sufferings of, the poor brute were

‘ painful to behold, and near by were half; a-_

dozen other horses, with heavy headscans,
all padded. and supported by slings from-’
falling. All were victims of the same fatal
equine plague which has prevailed in this
city since last Tuesday, and already over a‘
hundred of the animals have shocumbed‘to
the disease. ‘ ' ‘ 3 I, -

Chief Veterinary Surgeon Samuel K.
J olinson. of the Society for the Prevention '
of Cruelty to Animals, said the malady was.
known in veterinary surgery as “ asaturia,”
a peculiar form of blood. poisoning. Since j
the snowstorm there has, however, been an,
almost unprecedented increase of death
Dr. Johnson continued :

“ Horses are dropping all over the city. '
They are nearly all animals that have been .
wont to work every day. When the blizzard
struck here. they were laidup in the stables. \
They were giyen their i'ull quantity otfood.
and not haying properexermse it did not

' assimilate, thus causm‘g a poisoning of the )

blood. The result is that when taken out 7
to do Work the hind part of the animal be. ;
gins to quiver and shake, £aralys18 strikes

in and it falls to the groun .in agony. Then .'

a bullet is the best and only remedy, fer the ; -

horse. in nine cases out of ten. will die in ;
awful agony.” . _ .g

i HENRY BERGH,

The Bumb Creatures’ Friend.

, Henry 'Bergh was known the world
:fev'er..% the friend. the protector and the
.liberator of; dumb animals, and yet the
sorrow for his death has been voiced by
many sorrowing human beings. The

 

fencer that tainted their opinion ﬁfteen or
twenty years ago has given place to
} praise and the
‘ faded before the tears of sorrow.

smile of derision has
Henry

jBergh was the friend of animals; he

was their fearless champion and the

,ﬁrst to declare that a beast had not
only claims upon our pity but a right

‘ to demand our justice.

He fought the
ﬁght alone for many years, but lived to
see his labors crowned with full harvest
and himself honored and loved.

While the snowﬂakes were enshrOud-

.ing the city of New York on March 12,
the spotless soul

of this good man
winged its ﬂight. He lived and worked
for the good of others, and after a busy
life of over sixty years has gone, full of
honors, to hear the “Well done” of his
God. His Was an example that, living
orndying, might “bless the world and
(lead the way to heaven.”

. The above picture fails to give the
gentleness that beamed from the face of
‘ thiemhilanthropist. It has a sad look;
'2ng had‘He-nry Berghwa look as though
{the stem of the suﬁ‘ering creatures
Were his very own.

He" was a tall, spare man, with a face
renewing the . strong determination
which characterized his life. He was
'Latialilltimes a courtly gentleman, ele-
lfgantginmanner and dress, reserved to

‘morbid sentimentality about him; his
judgment'was sound and the sadness

    
  
 

- , f on his face gave way to a sunny smile

K when he said, “Oh, do not be discour-
aged about the work in New Orleans;
work on, work hard, all will come
right.”

* q The illness which terminated the life
of this great man began many months

«ago, but was hastened by the death of

born in New York in 1823; was a child

BOSTON. March 29.—-.\ime. Dies De Bar is known
to to the Boston spiritualism and all unite in saying
she is a wonder.

In the Spiritualists’ colony which gathers every
summer at Onset Bay sue occupied a tent on
Main street last summer. A blind man fal-
lered past her tent one day. She told
him to enter. Seating him in a chair

she put into his hand a stretcher, made of
canvass drawn tightly across 3 sm .ll wooden
frame. Pressing llie stretcher to his, brow me
blind man held it there as directed for about live
minutes, when there began to appear across its
surface the outlines of the herd and Ullﬁi or u fe-
male, until the Whole was scan cmuplelmaud there
was revealed the portrait of a young and beautiful
woman.

“ Take this,” said the madame to the blind man.
“it is a gift from angels in heaven.” The portrait
was in oil, Wthll was so moist as to leave its lul-
print on the ﬁngers 01 the astonished (in-lockers.

Luther Colby, the venerable editor Gillie Harmer
of Light, the spiritualisilc weekly of Boston. is
voucher for the m.raculous perlormauces of the
madame. lhir. Colby has been for thirty-one years a
devotee of spiritualism, and knows the science
“irom A to Z. He said to-nlulit to 'i'm: WORLD cor-
respondent that he had known Mme. lliss llebar
for years. “But bless you,” said he, “its nothing
now. Why, what she does has been done
again and again, and has been written
up many times. A year and a hallago Icalle'l
upon Mr. Marsh. Ihad heard he was converted
by the madame, and I wanted to write him up for
_ my paper. But Mr. Marsh wouldn’t allow it, and
yhe then said that the newspaper reporters must

never be admitted. lie is an honorable gentle-
;man, and, I have no doubt, is perfectly sincere.

The only thing that puzzles me is the writing
on the pads, of which Till-2 WORLD speaks.
I cannot understand the marvellous power which
produces these writings, and tnev form the only
basis tor doubt in my mind. But I would have the
leblic know that time. Dias Ilebar is no fraud. ”
The editor said that at Onset he invited a number
» of ladies to go out on a steamer. the madame being
1 among the number. She toot: up a canvas-covered
frame and, holding it against her forehead. soon
produced on the canvas a beautiful marine paint-
lnit _of a storm at sea. The mad me’s
‘ facility in this line was not confined to
Places. Once, while in the water at Onset,
a stretcher was handed to her, and on it she brought
out a picture similar to that prestvnled to the blind
man. Mr. Colby said he was inclined at first to
believe the madame was a trickster. and depended
for her portraitures upon a chemical process se~
crcted within the canvas. This VIC‘W was soon ills-
Delled from his mind when he saw her produce a
picture on the bare surface of a Cigdf-hOX. From
another source it was learned that Madame luss
Debar has made crayons and oil paintings
for many peo lie in Boston. They were
chiefly the portraits of deceased relatives. For her
' works, she Charged as high as $200, but the price
. varied with the purse of the buyer. it is said the
:madame’s rilzht name is not Dlss Doom, and that
‘ get ancestry is not as she says it is. She is said to
o? ghtiiative of Lew Orleans. and there while a girl
- rteen, ﬁrst gave Signs of her powers.

by her fot'her,tand; that when Mrs. Bergh died last .
year certain of lierrelatives produced a will made
by‘herm July. 1887, in which she left the Warren
street; property to one of her own family.

According to cxrstingState laws, at the time of
Mr. Bergn s marriage her property became the
property of her husband- In order to avoid such an
arrangement a mutual agreement was entered into
byIMr. and-Mrs. Bergn by which a trustee was ap-
pomted for the Warren street property, with the un-
derstandiug between them that at the death of ;
eithel' thenropcrty was to go to the surViving one.
Later ll;- was tacitly agreed that ultimately the
property should be left to the Societyl'or the Pre-
vention of Cruelty to Animals. ‘

Thomas Brown was the ﬁrst trustee, and after his

trustceb’y the Supreme Court in 1874. When‘Mrs.
Bergh idi‘ed Trustee Cochran transferred the property
to Henry Bergli and he willed itto the above society.
Legal documents show that the transfer was made
all rightand no question could be raised were‘it not
for theifact that about twenty years ago Mr. and
. Mrs. Be‘rgli separated on account of some family
trouble.) .. ' {2
Since that time Mrs. Bergh several times spoke of. f
reconsidering the dispos1tlon of the Warren street
property as her . husband desired, but she did
nothing until a few years ago. when, it is claimed
by George A. dc Freitas. of‘Utica, one ol‘her relatives.
tnatsne and her husband mutually agreed that she
should dispose of her property as she deemed lit.
The. paper on which the agreementwas written
wasgplaced in charge of General Butterﬁeld, a
mutual'f'riend, and later was given by him to a Miss
Brown, 1013 Utica, for safe Keeping.

was the founder, is modelled largely alter the Eng-

a year in maturing his plans for the 'estalolishment2

of means to check and prevent cruelty to animals.

THE SOCIETY INSTITUTED.

tion and even arrest, which it still possesses. Mr.

, Bergh has been its president since its inception, and
its invaluable servmes to beast, and man as well, .

are'largely due to his resolution, the moral eleva-
tion oihis character, his tact, unﬂinching courage
and unconquerable perseverance. He receives no
salary ior his work, freely gives his time and ener-
gies to it, and the public know this to be the case
and respect and honor the man who makes the sac-

- riﬁce. Mr. Bergh 1s a member of the bar and effec-
" tive in the court room as well as in interferences in

behalf of animals in the public streets and elsewhere,

. and on the public platform as a lecturer enforcing

the wisdom and duty of humane feeling and action.
The manner in which he ﬁrst attracred earnest

'_ attention to his humane work was peculiar indeed.

At six o’clock one blustery Winter’s night, when
the slush was ankle deep in
and ‘ sleet and hail ﬁlled the air, he
with a number .01 his men, made
Ghatham street, wherein haliadozen'main horse
car lines concentrate, his base of action. He gave
orders to take from the traces every horse that had
an ailment orasore. The lines were all blocked
and remained so for hours. Hundreds of thousands
of people looted it up town through the slush and
the mud, the nail, the snow and the wind, growling,
cursing, wet, hungry and mad. Everyone had
asked what it was all about, and everyone heard
the single word. “Bergh.” Thus in a night his plan
leaped from a dream into a reality, and those who
regarded him as visionary discovered that he had
might as well as right with him.
THE MAN.

Mr. Bergh may well be classed as one of New
York’s oddest; men. ‘Though his attire, from his tall

the gloves on his hands, is faultless, yet it strikes

took occasion to commend the Work: of thei

the, pews were copies of its last annual re-

for the past year fell short of the expenses
by $326.07. The total outlay amounted to
$1,084.96, and it is estimated that 2,000
members are needed who will cheerfully

SFFlCIAL ARTICLE.

BIRD MU RDER.

A short time ago mention was made of the ‘

enormous number of sparrows which had been
destroyed in Cheshire, through the farmers oﬁeriiig
a reward for their destruction, as they had
proved to be injurious to crops. Against the dos-
truction of birds injurious to man there can of
course be no objecti0x1-und if war was waged only
against mischievous birdslike sparrows, the lover

f of bird life would not have much to complain about,
:Unfortunately, a bloody war is at present in-

cessantly carried on against birds “‘hiclx are not
only beautiful and graceful, but are beneﬁcial in
the best sense of the word to mankind.

For some years back it has been the fashion for
ladies to wear feathers or wings, or even whole
birds, in their hats and bonnets; nay, ball dresses
are made of the feathers of humming birds; and it
was stated not long since that in order to provide a
ball dress some hundreds of humming birds had to
be killed. “'0 cannot suppose that the ladies who
wear feathers are really aware of the serious mis-
chief wbich is caused by their persistency in the
fashion of wearing birds and feathers. It means
that many of the most beautiful birds are being ex-

terminated by the bird murderer in order that the

vagaries of fashion may have play. This is no
vague statement; it is. unfortunately, but too true.
From “ Greenland’s icy mountains to India's coral
strand” the slaughter goes on. The terns and
kuas of the Arctic regions; the tropical sun
birds, rollers, and bee eaters; the herons
and egrets of the swamps of Florida;
the birds of paradise of New Guinea as well as the
homely rooks, robins, and sparrows, all perish, in
order that the women of Europe and America. may
imitate the savages in their habit of wearing
feathers. As many as tbirty thousand humming
birds have been sold in an auction room in London
in an afternoon. In the ﬁrst four months of 1885
404,464 skins of Brazilian and \Vest Indian birds
were sold in London; during the same period
356,389 Indian birds, as well as many thousands of
birds of paradise, Indian pheasants, and other
beautiful birds, were put under the hammer. One
American writer states that one man in America
prepares about 30,000 birds in a year; from a small
place on Long Islands 70,000 were ' sent
in four months to New York, 40,000 terns
were sent from Cape God in a. season,
andan enterprising birdkiller states that be pre-
pared 11,000 skins during a three months’ trip to
South Carolina. These are the number of skins
actually sold; but they do not by any means tell
the whole story. To these large numbers must be
added the birds which were killed, but were too

did the lady (we prefer to use this term rather than
woman) for whose adornment hundreds of
humming birds were slain ever thought what
that really meant. \Ve wonder if she would
wear the dress if she saw the hundreds
of bleeding caresses piled up as a huge
blood sacriﬁce to fashion, and if she ever gave a
thought to the hundreds of orphan humming birds
left to perish inch by inch from starvation. That
birds are being actually killed out is too true. At
“Cape God we are told “ that at points where a. few
years since these graceful birds (the torus) ﬁlled the
air with their graceful forms and snowy plumage,
onlya few pairs now remain.” The egrets of

s THE STORY.

MB. BERGH DENIE
3N0 Fee Charged for Removing Lame HorseSi;
3 from the Streetse-The Ambulance Free to All. i

"The report which appears in a morning patron”:
said President Henry Bergh, of the Society for the.
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, “that the so i
ciety would not remove a disabled horse from the

streets without the payment in advance of a fee
of $5, was written with malicious intent. The
only truth in the statement is that a lame horse '
lwas reported at the society’s ofﬁce on Tuesday ‘
night, by two persons who said it was at Twenty“
seventh street and Broadway and belonged to the
Street Cleaning Department. The animal was re- 1%
moved by the society’s ambulance. There is no:
5 fee charged by the society or any of the oﬁicers ber.
i fore removing a disabled animal from the streets. It
*the owner is able to pay for the expense after-4 '
; wards, a bill is sent to him. as the Society should. " .
‘not be called upon to pay out money for the bene-. “’

. ﬁt of others when the owners of animals are able‘)’ '
to do so. But this is a secondary consideration,

" and if the owner should be unable to repay the so.
ciety that ends the matter. The society has no“
' horses of its own, but hires a team to draw the ‘
.ambulance which is furnished free of cost. The .-
‘ ambulance horses are kept at a livery stable at ‘
Eighteenth street and Fourth avenue, so as to be
near the society’s headquarters. It cbsts about 1,
$1,800 a year to payfor the use of these horses, 1
and the contract requires that they shall always. I
be ready at any hour of the day or night, for calls

open. With reference to my lax management, 1' ,
can only say that the same system is being carried
out as when the late Henry Bergh was in chargeg
and I have heard of no complaints, either directly
‘ or indirectly, until the statement appeared in in
Lmorning paper.

OME weeks ago Tue EPOCH tOOk strong ground against
the barbarous practice of docking horse‘s’ tails. Mr.
Henry Bergh who recently succeeded his uncle of the

same name as President of the “American Society for the

Prevention of Cruelty to AnimaIS,” conﬁrms our views, and

furthermore says in to-day,’s EPOCH * 7' * “The animal is

v. thus deprived of the only means he has of protecting himself

against insects. How would it be if a- man’s arms were cut

' off short at the shoulder, and he had no means of brushing
the ﬂies from off his head or his nose? Would not the tor-
,_ ture be great? A person suffering from such a deprivation

would realize the cruelty of cutting off a horse’s tail. * * *1

I believe the operation itself hurts as badly as the cutting 'off
of a person’s ﬁnger.” But all this humane talk and as great
deal more will not prevent fashionable people from con-
tinuing to cut off the poor horse’s tail if they think it will
add to the “swell” appearance of the turn-out.

By this time the big black dog seemed to be

sleeping soundly in his cage. Before violating .

the ancient warning to “ let sleeping dogs lie,”
the Proiessorremarked that the brute was
vicious and dangerous. having already bitten
two men, a statement that may have done

muchto repress sympathy for the beast in the ?

subsequent proceedings.

tive ol 3. Philadelphia electric lighting com-
pany, also went to look on closely. ,

The dog awoke and demonstated his vicious

temper by a savage attempt to seize the ﬁrst

hand that came near him. He seemed to un-
derstand that if he had any hope at all it would .

troubles were over. It was difficult to learn
the exact amount of "resistance” he offered
for his violent panting aﬁected the tests, but it

was eventually determined at 15,800 ohms. Ar- ,

riving at that conclusion only seemed to render
him uneasy and make him breathe hard. not
to hurt him at all.

A pressure of 300 volts in a continuous cur—

rent aﬁorded by an Edison gdynamo was order- ’

ed. and when it was on in. full force. Prof.
1 Brown stood with his hand on the switch lever
ready to turn it into the unconscious dog. who
sat- up on his haunches quit-o unsuspectingly
with hislong pale pink tongue inatlging out and
a look of weariness in h1s eyes. if. was ins last
placid moment. There was a sharp click‘of
the lever and almost instantly the sound of1ts
return, throwing on and cutting off the current,

, but short as the interval was it had been long

enough for the do}: to leap into the air with a
loud yelp of amazement and terror. When he
came down on all fours and found he was not
hurt he stared about him as if bewildered.

2 “ Four hundred volts,” ordered the Professor,
and the tension was increased to that amount. 1
That time. when the lever was thrown over, the
dos ave three loud cries and struggled con~
vuls1vely during the ten seconds that lie was
sublected to the current. The next raise was
to 500 volts, and undenlt his howls of agony
and fright were cont1nuous.vvh11e he made
frantic efforts to get out of the cage, during
the time that one could count thirty. Even
after the current was cut off he fought wrth

desperation to escape from .what doubtless
seemed to him an internal env1ronment. Tear- »

ing his way through the meshes of the strong
‘wire he got his head outhand would have fol-
lowed it with his body had he not been de-
tained by a rcpe around his neck, which was
run through a hole in the end of the box and
made fast. In his struggles he had torn off the
muzzle. and his yells oi" terror and rage were
broken by the vicious snapping of his big
White teeth. The men behind the table. were
. seriously alarmed; but the rope held, and after
a little 3. big wire was but around his neck and
wound around the ridge pole of the gable-
roofed cage so as to secure hlm. ' .
Seven hundred volts weresent into hlm for
full ten seconds. Bis frantic endeavors to es-

- cape were renewed, and again he bade fair to

succeed. when another strong wire (a bare one)
was wound about his neck, which. was further
secured by a stout leathern strap, and asecond
leather strap was fastened about his lans and
to the cage. Two of the assistants, in their
excitement. were going to hold on to the bare
wire as the Professor was about to turn on the

' current again. and he noticed them with hor-

ror. Quickly all was made safe and ready for
another experiment. At thls time it was shown
that the dog’s natural reelstance had fallen to

3,500 ohms. ,
One thousand volts was the tensron of the

next current applied. The wretched brute '

gave ayell of agony that sounded almost like a

1 human shriek. but it was only momentary, for .
his maddened endeavor to wrest himself from .

the torture threw him into such a position that
the wires and straps about his neck strangled
his outcry. He could only claw irenzredly at

the wires of: his cage. clambering up them and 9

twisting himself in strange coniortrons._while
a gaSping, wheezin soon came from his dis-
tended jaws. T 6 current was kept on
for but avery brief space.as _it was not even
yet strong enough to kill Without prolonged
torture. and that was not deemed necessary.
Hurriedly the straps were cut and the Wires
untwisted so that the dog .could breathe. He

CAELED noWN BY THE s. r. o. A. .
A Union Man “rho was Cruel to Ins .
Aged Steed Taken in Hand.
Attorney Robert A. Stone, of the S. -P.
C. A., was recently notiﬁed that E. P.
Smith, of Union, was the owner of an old 1
horse, to which death would be a blessing,
and which was not only worked un_ "
necessarily but‘also unmercifully beaten. '
It was charged that Smith ' was in the
i habit of goading the beast with the tines.
1 of a pitchfork and otherwise cruelly abus--
2 ing the unfortunate animal. .

' Acting upon the suggestion of the at- .-
i torney, Ofﬁcer Whitney A. Moore took 00;. .

E casion yesterday to investigate the affair,

5 and repairing to Smith’s place found ‘
1 things about as they had been represented.
He accordingly" gave Smith the choice of
. two courses, to kill the animal .or stands
.‘ suit for cruelty. Smith agreed to ta'gQE
E the former course, and the ofﬁcer 1°”th
E fore any steps had been taken in the. 2122'

COYOTE “COURSING.” \

UTCHINSON, Kan., Oct. 271—011 Friday. Oct. 34).. 1
meeting, as a coursmg meet. was over, and thereshould
have been public announcement of the failure to run out the ,
stakes, and public explanation of the reasons therefor. In- ;
stead of this the management of the assoc1ation saw fit.
under the name. of the association and ostens1bly under ltS
immediate auspices, to resort to a catch-penny scheme to
which it is to be hoped neither this assomation nor any other i
will ever again resort. Two wild coyotes had been captured 2
and general posting of the town took place to the. effect that l
at 2 P. M. the “Reno-Barton pack of foxhounds’ would en- 2
gage in a “grand wolf hunt at the coursmg grounds." .\0 2
one had a distinct idea of what theatlair would be. but
’ several hundred people paid the adlnlSSlOIl fee to find out.
7 At about 2:45 the “grand wolf hunt” began. _'1h€ spectators ‘
2 ‘were asked to take their places 1ns1de the inclosed three- 2,
. quarter track. In the outside grounds, entirely inclosed by 2
a tight wire fence throu h which a rabbit could not pass. let
I alone a coyote, the poor evil of a captive coyote was turned
down and asked to obligingly run about a while before
he was killed. Dr. Royce kindly consented to "shoo _the
icoyote along the fence a little vay, and at certam points
2.310119: the fence “judges” were stationed. whose onerous dut y
[wasfto see whether the red or white collared dogs were ahead
in? this most truly novel coursin match, whose primary
design was to catch quarters an .whose secondary was to
murder a captive animal which, given a fa1r chance, would
, have shown itself of courage and endurance. (It should be
announced that Mr. Arthur Musse , the regular Judge of the
meet, had ' no idea of the nature 0 the task he was asked to
perform. else he would not have acted on that day.)
" Mr. Allison and Dr.‘ Royce had managed to get the coyote
iscared along the fence as much as half a mile when the
bounds were turned loose. The poor animal was running
With mouth open, panting, scared nearly beyond effort, and
seeking vainl for some loophole of escape from what even
la coyote cou (1 tell was an unsportsmanlike death trap.
iFollowing the cries of the pursuing—or let us rather say the
V‘shoo-ing” horsemen—the dogs ran at full cry down the
track; ﬁfty yards off on the wrong side for wind out across
la corner to Dr. Royce, who was riding after the ”chase,"
iand ran into the coyote at the north fence. Did that end
. the hunt? Not at all. The coyote was taken away from the
'dogs and put down to crawl around his death trap once
[more in this truly “grand” wolf hunt, put on foot by men
' professedly upholders of legitimate sport. Again the hounds
:galloped around the fence, and again ran into the puzzled
fg'and heartbroken creature, which panted slowly on, hunting
, _..a~»way out into the open, where it could have fair play and a
‘Tl'show for its life. This time, fortunately, the hounds killed
lit, and put an end tothe disgraceful exhibition. The repre-
.sgentatwes of FOREST AND STREAM and- another Sportsman’s
‘ .ggfgaper protested against this affair as being simply cruelty
. g;_3fj_‘ animals, and in no wise ﬁt to be called sport. They were
'told by one Muskimmons, an attache of the grounds. that if
{they did not like it they could leave. At this point FOREsT
'yf‘eNp STREAM’S reporter withdrew from the grounds, not
- ,. caring to witness'wr give notice to such an affair, except to
.""‘“2‘*22<‘;gimatize it as apiece of abominable cruelty, and one al-
igether unworthy of real sportsmen’s countenance.
CREST Aifm STﬁEAM has not a word to say against charg—

this proceeding is to make a race between
the terriers; and incidentally to the attain-
ment of. this object the life of the rabbit is
( sacriﬁced, as it is not long before one or the .
_, . other of the dog‘s overtakes the rabbit and j
. 3 kills him with a single bite.

“1% i During the race, however, it is probable
: that the feelings experienced by the rabbit
are by no means pleasurable, and the prose- “
cution of the gentlemen who had collected
. over three score rabbits to be pursued and
slain in this manner on Tuesday afternoon
for the delectation of the company, in-
cluding a number of ladies, who gathered to
witness the sport, is doubtless due to the
idea that it involves an element cf '.
wanton cruelty that is not present in the '
- hunting of wild animals at large in their are.
customed haunts.

same large class of the community his uncle alienated.

et at the same time everyone must acknowledge that he
'could have done much more good had be conﬁned himself
to his legitimate sphere, exercised better judgment and
been less domineering, overbearing and quixotic. In all
these respects the nephew seems determined to emulate the
uncle instead of proﬁting by the mistakes of the uncle.
Humanity is one of the noblest attributes to man; super-
humanity is a morbid sentiment, or the assumption of a
sentiment that does not really exist. and in either instance
the super-humanitarian is as ignoble as the humanitarian is
noble. Mr. Bergh, Jr., will ﬁnd respect and support as a
humanitarian and the contempt for a Charlatan as a super-
humanitarian.
The interference with the meeting of the Hempstead
Coursing Club and the arrest of some of the members, was
made under section 655 of the Penal Code in “willfully, un-
lawfully, wickedly and unjustiﬁably mutilating and hillingr
an animal,” in this instance a hare.
Coursing is recognized as a legitimate and reﬁned sport
_ in so many countries of the most advanced civilization, and
~‘ participated in by so many men of position and quite as re-
ﬁned and humane as Mr. Bergh is, that Mr. Bergh's action
in this instance cannot be viewed in any other light than a
most outrageous and unjustiﬁable interference with the
legitimate right of a club of individuals to enjoy themselves
__ in a manner in no way injurious to the morals or shocking
'thereﬁned sensibilities of the community.
_ 'l‘o suppose that the section of the Penal Code referred to
was enacted to be used in the manner Mr. Bergh employed
‘ it toward the Hempstead Coursing Club is an insult to the
intelligence of the community of which it is a law and the
1 members of the legislature who passed it. That it had be-
.hind it the sinister motive which its interpreter and en-
,‘forcer has exhibited is undoubtedly true, for it was the
ungratiﬁed desire of the uncle, and for which he was ever
struggling, to suppress ﬁeld sports of all kinds. This is not
hearsay, as to us he did denounce in the strongest terms,
. and on more than one occasion, those who participated in
. ﬁeld sports, and his numerous efforts to secure legislation,
,‘ which were rendered abortive only by their discovery in
ftime, are too well known,

miles east of the, last meeting ground. Superin'
. tendent Hankinson arrived early upon the grounds.
A. desperate eﬂort Was made to throw the smears .
off the scent, but it proved unsuccessful. . _

‘ The meeting was to have taken place 32.15 11

ofﬁcers over an hour’s time was lost in, endeavor- ,
ing to send the officers on a, wild-goose chase.
' Superintendent Hankinson did not take kindly to;

, noon, the members of the club ~ and .
; many ' women began to arrive on horseback, in

Before any preliminaries could be arranged, how-

ever, Superintendent Hankinson approached August
Belmont, in, who was apparently the prime mover ‘
in the Sport, and said: “ Mr. Belmont, do you

intend to let the dogs go after the rabbits ?”

“ I do,” replied Mr. Belmont, as he gave orders ‘
' to his groom to open thebox. and- release rabbit. .
‘ Superintendent Hankinson all this while was

i cautioning Mr. Belmont not to volate the law.

Thompson, the groom, proceeded immediately to

obey his master’s orders. Oﬂ‘icer..Snowden had his ‘

foot placed ﬁrmly upon the trap of. the box, and.

I Thompso, in carrying out Mr. Belmont’s orders,‘

was quiolrly arrested for interfering with an ,
oﬁicerin the discharge of his duty.

While. Thompson was on his way to court,

. Ofﬁcers Seymour and Bangs were placed in charge 3
of the rabbit box. At this juncture the members
and guests who were present in anticipation of sce- .
ing_ a ﬁne day’s 'sport denounced the action of the
soc1ety. Mr. Belmont was on his mettle and orders

soon speeding over the plains after the rabbits, '

The ofﬁcers, .who were. scattered about the
grounds, at once took action. The dead rabbit
was seized by an ofﬁcer, while other oiiiccrs ‘
'f at once placed under arrest .August Belmont, jn, .

DOWN ON LONG ISLAND.

Mr. Bergh’s Crusade Against the ..

Coursing Club.

Both Sides Determined to Conquer - Suffolk
County Criminals at the Bar—Teachers Dis-

cuss Educational Problems—Pcrsonal Notes. 1

Bcrgh’s men succeeded yesterday afternoon in
breaking up the sport of coursing at Hempstead.
l‘he main facts of the raid and the arrests were
printed in last night’s EAGLE. The prisoners
were taken before Justice lexvcs, at Hempstead.

William Thompson was charged with resisting .

i an ofﬁcer. When Mr. Belmont ordered him to
’ give a rabbit its freedom, he proceeded to do so

 

and shoved aside an ofﬁcer. who stepped forward
to prevent him opening the cage. That was the
extent of his oifending. -=The rabbit handler and
dog slippers who were arrested are charged with

inﬂicting cruelty. The rabbit killed by Resolute '

and Tiara in thirty seconds’ timewas secured by
one of (the ofﬁcers and taken to court to become
an exhibit in the case. All of the cases went over

until Monday, when the club’s counsel, Judge ‘

Weller. will demand a jury trial and that means.
as it did in the last case, an acquittal.
huntsmen are very popular in Hempstcad. They

The ‘

 

are the life of the place and spend money lavishly. g
The feeling of the people yesterday was expressed
in strong language and by booting at the “
Ofﬁcers. It is a question now as to which side 3
will win. Mr.Bergh seems fully determined to g
break up the sport. If a posse of ofﬁcers attend -

: each meeting and, as they did yesterday. seize

the rabbits, there can be no fun. The club, to a

have coursing at all. will have to outwit the law,
and of this Mr. Belmont and his friends are quite
capable; but if the ladies and gentlemen cannot
meet publicly, the absence of social enjoyment
will be the means of settling the vexed ques-
tion. The hunted rabbits are of the wild
species trapped in the woods at Deer Park

and thereabouts, and only the strongest of;

them are used for the chase. Resolute and
Tiara, the dogs of Mr. Kelly and Mr. Belmont,
are brother and Sister, and so evenly matched
that great interest was taken in yesterday's event.
They are the champion dogs and much disap-
pointment was felt that the question of superi-

ority could not be determined. Resolute made a f

phenomenal performance killing a rabbit in
thirty seconds. Perhaps the little animal does

the grass is tall and wiry. but they do get away.
Sportsmen say that it is either a death or an es-

. cape inside of a minute. Hunt members say that

since Henry Bergh’s death matters with the-so-
ciety have been very dull and interference with
coursing was hit upon to give it prominence.
Young Mr. Bergh can easily distinguish himself

of the Coursing Club, on the other hand, declare
that only forty seconds on the average elapse
before the rabbit is killed, and if the
succeed in killing promptly the men are instructed
to put an end to him with their own 'hands.
Coursing, they say, demonstrates the speed of the

diversion Was more exciting than the other, but
they would not be subject to the same drafts
upon their compassion as“ now. The rabbit may

Opposite them sat Superintendent Hankinson, of the

SOCIE’W for the‘Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

Lawyer Elliott, on behalf of the society, charged
the Prisoner, William Thompson, with violating chap-
ter 688 of the Penal _Code.' Oﬁicer Snowde-n, 0f the

society, Was the "complainant. ‘ Ex-District-Attorney ‘ 9
Downing at. once waived examination and demanded .

the trial by a. jury. He said he was ready to go
on. The rosecution was also ready, but Justice
blowers 100 red solemn and said that he could not try

0f_ the men who could be summoned as jurors were
exempt and the remainder. could not be gathered
together on so short a notice. Neither could any con-
stable, who was sufﬁciently competent to gather
them m, be summoned until half past 7 o’clock. ,

Mn. Downing was ‘.determined . and Judge Clowes
ﬁnally yielded. lie swore in John Cornelius as a
speclal deputy sheriff to secure a jury. The court
was then adjourned until 7 o’clock.

Alt 7 o’clock the court room was again crowded,
and the Judge, lawyers and their clients were on hand.
Deputy Sheriff Cornelius lugged in twelve talesmen‘?
One after another they ~ were peremptorily challenged

‘ jected to on the ground that he was a bookkeeper in

the harness shop of Cooper 6.: Powell, from whom Mr.

‘ while the eﬂieer was in discharge of his duty,
was called here to-day. The case, which grows '
' out or the desire for sport in the way of course
. ing rabbits, has suchastrong bearing on the
coming trial of Mr. Belmont himself on the,
charge of cruelty to animals that great 1m-
'9 portance is attached to it. and it has caused
more excitement than this quiet village has
‘3 known for years. ~ When it was called. at 4:30
this afternoon the array, of legal talent; which.
had come down from New-York and Brooklyn
hada somewhat staggering effect upon Jugmcay
Clowes, before whom the trial was brought. -'
George F. Elliott 01 Brooklyn appeared as
counsel for the prosecution, the Society for the

. Prevention .
, jamin W. Downing. ex-Dletriot_Attoruey of

ueens County, George W. chkersham of
Strong& Cadwallader. New-York, and Surrey
gate Weller appearedfor the defendant.

A hitch occurred In the proceedings at the
' start, when a misunderstanding occurred hes ,
tween the attorneys as to whether this was an

m

examination or a trial of the case before the
magistrate. After some discussion it was cos

olded that the case should be ﬁnally tried. and
a wry was demanded by the defence. Just-ice
Clowes announced that it would. be next to im-
possible to procure ajury on short notice, and.
wanted the case postponed. It required a deal?
of pleading to get the magistrate to alter his
decision, but he ﬁnally did so on the positive,
assurance of counsel for both sides that allé
technicalities would be waived. The Deputy;
Marshal was then specially denutized to pro. ‘
cure ajury or six men. and a veuire of 12 was
issued. returnable at 7 .o clock. and the court
took a recess until that time. .
Long before the appoxnted hour in the even-
ing the court room was crowded. The greatest
difﬁculty was experienced in procuring a. jury“
and it was neary 10 come}: when suitable
men had been selected to ﬁll the box. An ads
Journment was then taken until 3 o’clock .MK
moi-row afternoon. _ The case or the people
against Charles Bartelle and German Hopkins ..
for cruelty to animals, both of which had grown}
out of last Saturdays coursing are also mg.
for to-morrow and will be tried immediately“

Herald, read like a sporting run 2 Two Terriers,
Resolute and Tiara, were slipped on a rabbit :

They tore around after that little bunny in the
liveliest fashion, and the crowd became exultantly ex-
cited. Unfortunate Tiara ran against a small boy and
tripped him, while her competitor scored a go-by, a
turn, a trip, and a wrench. The rabbit rushed into the
thickest of the crowd, scampered under Miss Bird’s
horse’s feet, “ bunted” agamst Town Trustee Rush-

Miss Harriman was snapping her pretty eyes and

Just as we were preparing for press came to
hand Turf, Field, and Fawn, wherein we ﬁnd
' the following report :—

Out the programme of their second meeting, although
they had done their best to propitiate the S. P.C.A.
by advertising the stakes as “ Humane” and
“‘ Justice,” also including a foot-note to their score
cards to the eﬁect that “ the ofﬁcers and attendants
were particularly cautioned to see that the rabbits
were, if not instantly killed by the dogs, immedi-
ately destroyed by striking them on the back of the
. neck, and see that no cruelty or mutilation be per-
mitted.” ' ‘
But all to no purpose, for as soon as the crate con-
taining the rabbits was brought on to the ground
one of Mr. Bergli’s men took possession of it, literally
putting his foot down on the sport by standing on
the crate. [Here we should state that the Mr.
Bergli herein referred to is the secretary of the
S.P.C.A. in the U.S.-—ED. SHOOTING TIMES.] One
of Mr. Belmont’s men, being ordered by that gentle-
man to take out a. rabbit, tried to do so, shewmg 9,0
little respect for the said ofﬁcer’s foot as to push it
away. This heinous offence was quickly followed by
“ his arrest, that Mr. Belmont, who had provide-‘1 for
JllSll such an emergency, had another bunny or
two up his sleeve, or rather German HopkinS,
and these were let go after due notice that they were

The Action 01 the Ne“' Jersey Kennel Club.

A representative of the TURF, FiELD AND FARM met Mr.
J. lb. Shotwell, Treasurer of the New Jersey Kennel Club2
and in reply to a series of questions that gentleman said .
Numerous articles have appeared in the daily papers,
giving the impression that the New Jersey hennel Club
was half inclined to favor the adoption of Mr. C. .J.‘ Pe-w

was not the case. I had received information .as to Mr.

terview with him, proclaiming his intention to introduce
such a resolution,bcsides which there were reporters from .
the various papers on hand to publish the action of the
club. All this looked to me as if there was a private
grievance to be satisﬁed, and I was not Wllllng‘ that the
New Jersey Kennel Club should be used as the handle of ‘
a whip to chastise a private citizen, over Whose actions it
would have been simply impertinence for us as a club to

Conrsing —- Removal of the Railroad

Sheps From Hunter’s Point—~Isle of '

Wight Sold.

The statement- in several newspapers that the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
had withdrawn its opposition to coursing rabbits
at Hempstead Plains was not justiﬁed by the
facts. The society is not disposed to withdraw its
opposition. When it was found impossible to get
aconviction at Hempstead, though the accused

persons did not deny their guilt, Mr. Bergh saw

. that the only way to cope with Mr. Belmont and

ceeded to offer his resolution. 1 at once raised the point §

of order that the Hempstead Coursing Club, not being a
member of the A. K. C., the resolution was a matter en-
tirely foreign to the purpose of our organization and ‘
should not be entertained. On this point there was no
difference of opinion, and after a good deal of ﬂoundering
about the resolution was Withdrawn. It was the first
time I had ever found it necessary to be opposed to Mr.
Peshall, who is a gentleman of such uniform courtesy of .
manner that it is easy to forgive him. for errors of judg- ;

ent. .
mBut Why did he go over to the enemy (F. d:- S,) in order
to ventilate his views and furnish them with another
brick to fire at the President of the A. K C. Evidently
« there was a colored gentleman in the wood pile, ;

his friends was to attend every day and break up

the sport by seizing the rabbits. and he pursued '

that course. Mr. Belmont rid himself of the an-
noyance by agreeing to a test case before a jury
of the county. He put forward one of his serva-
ants to take the odium of arrest, indictment and
trial. If a conviction results Mr. Belmont is to

’ discontinue the killing of rabbits. If an acquittal

is secured Mr. Bergh’ is to keep his hands OE.
These are said to be the terms of the compact.
Nothing is said as to what will follow failure by
the Grand Jury to find an indictment, or the pos-
sible refusal of the district attorney to permit
the Grand Jury to be made a. party to the deal.
Sentiment in the county is not favorable to it.
The .fmnaica Farmer of to—day has this to say on
the subject:

August Belmcnt’s scheme to prove his person-

ality superior to the law by beatingllir. Bergh on

i a question of sentiment instead of fact ought not

to be tolerated for a moment. Hempstead is wel-
come to a monOpoly of the disgrace oi acquitting
men in the face of their own contessmns of guilt.
Cruelty to animals is not an offense spoolally
against the people of Queens County, but gener-

: ally ag inst- the people of the State, and a test

 

case involving a particular act can determine
nothing beyond that act. To say that one def“
cision determines future events would be throw-
ina‘ open the doors to brutality. Mr. Belmont is
not entitled to special privileges before the law.
he mav slaughter rabbits other men may fight
cocks. Therein lies the danger to society.
Gentlemen of Speculative minds, realizing that
there is money in catering to the tastes of the
gentlemen who chase the fox and course the rab- '
bit, are moving in a direction to take advantage
Of the situation. Mr. E. A. Garbutt, of 390
Broadway, New York, has written a letter to Mr.

. Bergh asking to be informed if he will permit the

coursing of jack rabbits, which are big and
and strong and able to give the ”hounds a. good
chase. Mr. Garbutt is anxious to import tlicqack
rabbit and establish a. preserve at Garden (lity if
he can have a. guarantee that the ofﬁcers Wlll not
molest the sport. Another gentlemen has put
himself in communication with Mr. Bergh on the
subject of coursing hares. If he can expect 1m-
munity he is ready to invest in a farm at Hemp-
stead. import hares from England and breed
from them fer the hunt. He would be Willing to
invest $10,000 for the advancement of the Eng.
' - . ' merica. .
llfill‘lhsepgvllidl: 13f Long Island would be up in arms
against the jack rabbits. They are a very destruct-
ive animal and as only three out of ten of them
are ever captured it would not be long before
they would swarm upon the farms and make
havoc among the crops. The little wood rabbit
which Mr. Belmont lets go from a cramped p081-
tion in a box and the dogs kill in half a minute
are so much of a nuisance that it may be dlihcult
to ﬁnd a jury of farmers who will say that their
extermination is not a. good thing. If Jack rab-
bits or hares can be coursed without legal inter-
ference the fox and the times seed bag Will be

no lected.

ginia, where a surgeon has been putting a dog
through inconceivaqu tortures “ in the interest."h
of science. The detailed account given ofljhis ex-
periments says that he put a glass plate into. the
dog’s skull so that the action of the brain could
be seen, and inserted a tube in the same dog’s .
. stomach through which he extracted food when
,the dog had only got half through with it. In ’
the same manner after the animal had. taken a i
drink of water the liquid was taken out of the '
stomach. The experiments were repeated at
differing intervalsqse as to ascertain at various
‘ stages the processes of digeﬁon and assimilation.
The dog Was exhausted time and again, so that ,
,_ it refused either toeat or drink, and was then
artiﬁcially stimulated until it once more craved
food. All this is so brutal that no punishment . .

The controversy between Thomas Verlein and
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to

Animals over thei’dcath of a horse, which engaged .'

the attention of J udgc Cullen and a jury yester-
day afternoon, was concluded this morning, when
the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff for
6 cents damages. The nag was shot by the agent
of the society, on the ground that he was sick,
crippled and had been abandoned in a. vacant lot.
A man named Rooney was placed on the witness
stand in the plaintiff’s behalf. RoOuey had
bought the animal for Verlein and his story was

that the horse cost $8. Verlciu’s tale was that ‘

about $30 was paid. Rooney told the Court that
the horse “had a ﬁne open countenance.” He

snIPPmo CATTLE 'ro EUROPE.

The Difﬁculties bf Handling Texas Steers on
Board Ship.

By Telegraph to the PClSTeIJISPATCH.

NEW‘YORK, March S.--There is a great deal
of live stock being shipped to Europe. Many
of the vessels. nowgengaged in the trade will
haul off as next summer approaches and pre-
pare to Share in the passenger business. It is
surprising how the cattle are, able to live
through the passage, carried as they are on
the upper deck and subject to all the hard-

ships of the North Atlantic in winter time.
The risk is great, and nothing but
the heavy remuneration to be obtained
would tempt vessel—owners to carry on the
trafﬁc. In heavy weather. when the vessel
is rolling and pitching, the bellowing of the
frightened cattle often rises above the roar of
the storm. Many of them become seasick,
fall down and are trampled upon by the re-
maining cattle in the pen. As soon as there is
a dead steerin one of the pens it is absolutely
necessary to get him overboard. Sailors often
have difﬁcult feats to perform, but when it
comes to sending one of their number into a
pen to bind the end of a hoist to
a dead steer’s leg, and to do this in, the midst
ofafrightened bunCh of Texas steers Jack
often makes a bad mess of it. Not infre-
quently the steers break down some of the
pens by their shifting about between the rails
and affect seriously the vessel’s trim. If this
happens in a heavy storm it Will likely place
the ship inlmmlnent danger. There is only
one remedy, and that 18 to get the steers

overboard. A bunch of them are shut
off as closely as possible, the
ports knocked down, and as the
vessel gives a heavy r011 they

are fairly pushed over into the seeming
waters. A big 6~inch hawser throws them off
as if they were so many ﬁles. The ports are

IS IT Lr'cmnln: SPORT? 5- ' ..

Pamphlet by the Hempgtcad Conrslnﬁ Club
In Defense of Rabbit Coursina. '

. The. young gentlemen of the Hempstead Cours»
1rg Club have got up a pamphlet upon the
sport- which brought down upon them the band
of avengers whose initials are S. P. C. A. It is
an argument in behalf of killing rabbits by for
terriers in accordance with certain prescribed
rules. combattmg Mr. Bergh’s charge that “it
is more cruelty to animals,” by description of the
sport and quotations from authorities in sup-
port of it. It 18 also calculated to silence those
‘ ‘ ‘ penny-a-liners ’ on sportinrr subjects ”
u__ . ._, .. ‘,who
in the most abacctly mean and contemptible
“MINUS?" held the H. C. C.’s members up to
the l'lulClllC and contempt of the community ”
It is a. question how convincing the ar ument
may be to those who are of the opinion t 1at the
rabbit is killed in an inhumane way. and that it
is not an unpretentious and innocent pas-

 

tune.” There 18 a spasm of virtue in the opening

sentences. It reads “The Hem st ‘

lu-and vcrynmuch misrepresented in various
or 1ts sport. feels that it is due to

itself to lay before the
w at coursmg of rabbits by fox terriers means,
thelust claims the sport has to recognition,
and. While domg so. protests against the un—
soueht and undeservet notoriety forced upon
what was intended to be an unpretentious and
111110091115 pastime.” To the sporting public,
perhaps. the pan‘lplilet may be ﬁlled with sta-
tlet,108Drov1ng ra )blt coursing to be a sport,
while to the general public, on the other hand,
it mayonly furnish them a loner list of prece-
dents ior cruelty. ‘
Much weight is put upon the fact that Stone-
h‘ellge. the best and most respected authority in
LDg‘llll‘l(l.'llD0n sports, _gives rabbit coursing
plan? in his book. f‘Britlsh Rural Sports.” The
.I. L. (J. lays spec1al emphasis upon the follow~
mg paragraph as combatting the accusation of
crueiyz ’0 may be open to the charge of
cruelty, but 'so is every sport depending upon
the death of its Victim for its existence; and cer-
tainly in this res ect rabbit coursing is not to be
compared w1th s ooting in any of its multifari-
ous forms.” Is it not a dis uted point when
shooting becomes wanton an cruel? In reply
to the statement which has been made that
rabb1t coursmg is not unlike rat baiting, the
pamphletsays: _ “The com arisen of coursing
to rat baiting is most ma'cious and untrue.
Baiting signiﬁes to ‘ revoke or harass’
(Webster), and is used to d)
one animal against another in a contest, the

ﬁght and death, if one ensues, being the idea i

and object of the proceeding. The death of the ;
hare or rabbit in coursing 1s not the object, and -
there 13 no contest other than as between the 3
dogs; the rabbit and bare furnishing the means ‘

for the contest and nothing else.” The contest -

of speed, certainly is between the rabbit and the
(logs; if the rabbitﬂeein ‘ for its life is success-
ful it 18 claimed that t ere is no cruelty. It
would be sentimental to say, perhaps, that the
rabbit in fear of Its pursuers Butlers from being
harassed; but the pamphlet further declares .
that there is very little chance tor 1t to escape.
The death of the rabbit is speedy and ‘_‘every

recaution is taken to pernnt no mutilation ” of
the remains. Now what 1nterest can the rabbit
take in this post mortem_ tenderness? ‘The
death of the hare or rabbit in coursin ' is not the
object.” No; but if the bare or rab it did not
come to its death by the—shall 1t be called—acm-
dental circumstance that the fox terrier most
always caught him, this “unpretentious and
innocent pastime” would come to a speedy

Horses which sufl'er most during the hot
weather are those (unplnyetl on the street rail-
roads, owing to the scarcity of relay Sl‘tlltvll.‘
along the several routes. The ('til'})til'£ill<lll ordi-
nances prohibit the erection of shells on pnlilit-

 

tunities for rendering assistance.

Let us hope that ere long the electric motor.
or cable system. will be substituted as a

motive power for those patient beasts of

weather for the convenience of mankind.

In the language of the statute. the word
“animal.” while it does not include the human
race. includes every other livingr creature.
Hence it will be seen that it is not the horse
alone that comes under the provisions of the
law, but “every living creature."

No animal is too insigniﬁcant for the protec-
tion of the Society, hence it may readily be
inferred its duties are diversified and
numerous.

Permit me to give a few practical details of
our work since the beginning of the year:

Arrests and prosecutions ..................... 131
Disabled animals suspended from labor ...... 579
Horses, mules and other large animals de-
stroyed . .................................. 500
Small animals destroyed ...................... $15

Complaints investigated and evils remedied. 40l

disabled horses ........................... 173

Society. permission has been gix'en in several
instances for the putting up of temporary

property owners was first obtained. We have
insisted. however. on a full supply of fresh
water all along the line of travel. and our ntii—

Yesterday. with Oﬁiccrs Smart. Seymour

In addition. there were yesterday sewera.
picnic parties in the veintry which also had

numerous patrons. all of whom hadto reach

the grounds by this road.

It‘can well be imagined what the peer
beasts drawing the cars would have suﬁeretl
if the ofﬁcers of the SoCicty had not been

The Society’s agents then went on to West
Farms. where there was much work for them
to do.

Dozens of people were compelled to leave
the overloaded cars. many young men hav-
ing betaken themselves to the car roofs.

The next move of the Society lel he to
correct things at the One Hundred and
Seventieth street depot, where the abuses
and cold nengot of public comfort and gross
cruelty to the horses were exposed in THE
EvrsiNG WORLD.

Ofﬁcer Smart said today that on some of
the cars yesterday were as manv as 110 per-

It is also a fact that the owners oi the road
have lots of political inﬂuence. but this will
not make any difference to Supt. Hankenson,
who is oetermined to stOp the abuse of the
horses anyhow.

It is said that the indignant citizens of the

The charge preferred by the Society for Pre-

that they did “ wilfully, unlawfully, wickedly, and
unjustiﬁably mutilate and kill an animal,” in this
instance a rabbit.

his hand with a dramatic gesture.” Among the
arrests we notice the name of Mr. German Hop-
kins, who, we may be sure, was highly amused to
ﬁnd himself in such a novel situation.

Mr. ‘Belmont, jun., according to American
fashion, was afterwards interviewed, and enthusi-
astically defended the pastime, maintaining that
its followers were good sportsmen. He also
upheld the practice on the ground that it served
exhibitors of FOX-terriers as a guide to breeding.

Fox-terriers may be used for rabbit-coursing, but

it is not their legitimate work, and the bench

specimen would be left out of sight in a moderate
course. No Fox—terrier exhibitor would dream of

‘ breeding from the coursing “cracks.”

At the risk of incurring the displeasure of its

1‘, upholders, we must earnestly demur to this

. . amusement being digniﬁed by the term sport.

The pastime is on its trial in America and here.
We are not condemning it, we do not ask for its
suppression, although we know that a strong feel-
ing against .it eX1sts3 all that we wish to do for
the present is to protest against its being described
by a word that was in use before this game was
invented. Rabbit-coursing as at present con-

cannot conceive of anything more silly. To be sure Nature provided
the horse with a tail of greater or less length. Nature also provided
the man— that is, some men—with hirsute adornment far beyond the
limits of what is generally conceded to be the beautiful. If then such
men have their hair cut and their beards trimmed, why, the quhstion
arises, should horses, whose tails drag in the mud and mire, not have
a similar operation performed upon them? The “ banging ” of a
horse’s tail, which means the cutting off of the hair up to the cartilage
might, it is true, overcome this evil ; “but then a banged tail is, accord:
ing to the most aestl'ietic of fashionable authorities, devoid of the
beauty that society just now demands in the quadrupeds that draw it
to and from its entertainments and its shopping excursions, and, there-
fore, something further is required. ,

THIS something further is technically known as “ docking,” and it
is against “ docking” that a hue and cry has been raised. As my al-
ways sympathetic and tender hearted friend, Mr. Henry Bergh, de-
clares, this operation involves the severing of the vertebral column and
the removal of a greater or less number of the joints, according to the
fancy of the operator. Not only does docking, says Mr. Bergh, deprive
the animal of protection from the attacks of insects -some of which
occasion great pain—but the operation itself is one involving a great

KILLED BY THE HEAT.

srrsors or THE WARM WEATHER
ON WORKING Houses.-

 

 

 

The A. S. P. C. A. Busy Removing
Dead Annuals — What the Society
Has Accomplished During the Year.
Pushing a. Dead Letter Law to Pro-
tect Dulnb Creatures.

“This hot weather is having every detrimen-
l tal eﬁect on working horses,” said Superin-
tendent Frank 0. Clark, of the Brooklyn
a Agency of the American Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
to a CITIZEN to-day, “and if to-morrow hap-
pens to be much cooler, the reaction will
prove fatal to a great many animals. Both
yesterday ’and to-day we have been taxed to
our utmost removing dead animals. They are
in nearly every instance laboring horses that
have performed their accustomed work
as usual in spite of the weather. The drivers
cannot very well be blamed for their work is
not lessened during the hot spell, and they
cannot lessen the work of the animals. Three
sick horses that we removed yesterday died
# after bemg taken to. the veterinary stables,
and I have been notiﬁed of several others that
the ambulance have been sent after. While
the hot weather is hard on human beings, it
IS more so on animals.”

A. great many complaints have reached the
l , soc1ety regarding injury done to horses by
i stepping on nailsaglass‘. etc., thrown into the

; street by careless 1ndiv1duals. There is a state

law prohibiting this which. has been virtually a
|. ' dead letter, but the society have decided to
make arrests under 1t and secure convictions,
l if possible, in order to abate the nuisance.
The law reads:

Section 660 of the Penal Code of the State
of New York-

“A person who unjustiﬁably administers
any poisonous or nox1ous_drug or substance
to an animal, or unjustiﬁably exposes any
such drug or substance With intent that the
same shall be taken by an animal, whether
such animal be the property of himself or an.
other, is guilty of a misdemeanor."

Section 661: _ .

“A person who wrlfully throws, draps or
places, or causes to be thrown, dropped or
placed upon any road, highway, street, or
public place, any glass, nails, pieces of metal, '
or other substance whmh .mlght wound, dis.
able or injure any animal, is guilty of a mis-

demeanor.” ‘

' The enalty for such, on conviction, is a
ﬁne of ﬁve hundred dollars, or one year’s im.
prisonment in the penltentiary, or by both
ﬁne and imprisonment.

It is a common practlce for the employees of
the electric light compames in changmg the
carbons onarc lights to throw the Old carbons
into the roadway. It 18 generally supposed
that when a horse steps On one the carbon is
crushed, but several 1nstances have been re.
' corded, especially where the carbon has been
thrown on a soft pavement, where animals
g ' have been injured by the broken carbons be-
' ing wedged in between the frog and the shoe.
‘ “We hold that thls 18 a Violation of the State
law,” Superintendent Clark said, “and I am'
. going to write to the premdents of the com.
panies requesting that instructions be issued-
to the men, proh1b1t1ng them trom‘ throwing,
i the stud in the, roadways. Our pihcers have
l already been instructed, on seelng the men
I throwing the carbons 1n the street, to order
them to pick them up agam, and If they re-
fuse, to place them under arrest. Carbons
come under the head of.‘ ubstance which-_
. might wound, disable or in} re,’ and the law;
I! certainly covers the ‘pomt completely. A},
p ,. horse was wounded on Bedford avenue onlyj

yesterday by stepplng on. an old carbon. It is
only thoughtlessness on the part of the El‘ic‘.

idea may be gained of what we are doing with so
limited a force. and what might be accomplished

‘ if the number of ofﬁcers were increased to ﬁfty.

Then why do you not augment your force, no doubt
some one wi'llsay, If so much more good can be
done? Simply because we have not the funls to
meet the expense of such requirement. We increase
our working force In proportion to the ﬁnancial as-
sistance rendered to us. Two kind hearts 1 friends
01' the cause quite recently donated sufﬁcient funds
for additional drinking fountains for man and beast.
These will be erected as soon as suitable sites can
be secured in localities where they will do the most

good. .
There has been no pronounced epidemic among

horses since 1872, when that dreadful disease, known '

as the “epieootic” preyailed, and which proved fatal
in over 2,510 cases. Since that time, owing to the

, persistent activity of the society, the condition of

 

the horses in this and adjacent cities. has steadily
improved, and l venture to assert that the animals
of tms and surrounding localities are better treated
and cared for than they are elsewhere.

Horses which suffer most durin : the hot weather
are those employed on the street. railroads, owing to
the scarcxty of relay stations along the several
routes. The corporation ordinances prohibit the
erection of sheds on public thoroughfares, but at
the reqvcst of this society permission has been
given in several instances for the putting up of term
porary awnings; but not until the consent of the
property owners was ﬁrst obtained. We have
melsted, however. on a full supply of fresh water all
along the line of travel, and our ofﬁcers never fail
to suspend Irom labor any horse showing signs of
fatigue or of being overheated. In addition, the
society’s patrol wagon, in charge of a competent

1: odicer, is supplied with remedies and other appli-

1 ances for the relief of suffering animals, and is con-
stantly patrolmgthe streets, seeking opportunitiel

4 for rendering assmtance.

ONE VICTORY GAINED.

 

We were greatly interested in an ac—
count given by “ Cur Animal Friends" of a
correspondence relationg to the vivisection

question. Mayor Grant, of NewYork, re-
ceived from John Godfrey, surgeon-in-
command U. S. Marine hospital, a letter
asking a permit to be granted Dr. J. J.
Klnyoun to procure dogs from the city
pound for scientiﬁc purposes. This let-
ter with one of protest from Gideon J.
Tucker, of the New York Press Club, was
forwarded. by Mayor Grant to John P.
Haines, president of the American Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals,
for examination, and a request for the
views of the society in reference to the
advisability of granting this permit.
President H-aines’ reply was brief, but
forcible, and consi;7‘:'.:“

l quite agrée with him when he says:

. “ To devote a helpless living creature

to torture, even in the interest of science,
is the acme of cruelty; but to license the
prolonged sufferings of a sentient being
simply to gratify the curiosity of unau—
thorized perSons, is against the splrlt of
our civilization.

“ I. therefore, in the name of our moral
civilization, the progress of which durmg
the past century your Honor has 1nv1ted

the two walls of a corner of the room. One
battle was fought and the admirers of the

and a squad of police entering. Half a dozen A
tried to get out of the rear window, but they
found the police guarding it from the outside.
One small window that the. police failed to
observe. and the sports did, proved of incal-

away, but the others were corralled. and also
the proprietor of the saloon, John Mattey.

Vicious Animals Cured.

Prof. 0. ll. Gleason, the king of horse-
triiining fume, is giving an exhibition of
horse irninihg at too Fifth Avenue Casino,
corner Union street, every evening tor a short
se:iso;i. Last night the spacious hull, whicii'
has been ﬁtted up sheet nlly tor llh‘ exhilmions,
was well filled in all parts with an appreciative

{ auditinga Our Brooklyn ladies were there in

I force,and appeared deluhted with the masterly

3 manner in which the animals were bandied.

, The STANDARD-Lori}; reporter noticed
several well-known oil/.3115 wno reside on the
Heights. The ﬁrm horse handlesl was a valu-
able saddle here), very excuetl airl afraid of
steam. It took just twenty-ﬁve minutes to
convince him that he had rounl his master and
was no longer afraid of steam whistles or any-

, thing else likely to startle a. horse. The

:secoudon the programme was 3 Cult from
New York, owned by ex-Polico Commissioner
Peter Sutter. The professor lllllnllldtfly
brought this colt under suouiission by udvanc~

i log quickly to the animal. staring it straight

, in the eye, and then he retrnced his steps the
horse following’ him. The evening’s programme

' was brought to a. close with two very
lively kickers, one a mare, owned by a ‘
veterinary surgeon, who only the night hclora .
kicked a. cart all to splinters. She was truly a
high kicker, as she let ﬂy and smushel one or
the chandeliers. The other is well—k mm as a
terror, and usually took four inch to put her
in harness. Their ugly habits were 111 time
(thirty minutes) broken, and both were hitched

3 to a. wagon and went well together, despite the

l crackers let off under their feet, a. jet of

l

 

' steam, and whistles. The vast audience, ,

I which comprised numbers from the Height-S, 1:

, seemed well satisﬁed. 'l‘o-night the lull- 1.
blooded horse Belmont, whose owner says he is
a terror, will be handled. Prof. Gleason is
ably assisted in the ring by Morton Smith.

proved to be one of great interest. There
was a very lame audience present, and the
ladies did not form n small minority by any
menus in the en] of the hull where the re-
served sents Were located, the ladies and gen-
tlemen being: very evt-iily divided.
A horse was brought out which had the
reputation of beini.r :1 bad sliyer and of kick-
, 111:; like blazes when bit with the whip. It
‘ was also it creature which would not be a
good one to drive when goingr for a train, for
it hurl. u disposition to go quite slowly. In a
‘ few minutes from the time Mr. Gleason took
it in llllllll it would neither kick nor shy and
would no nrouurl the ring usif the “ old boy”

A finely bred, nervous and stubborn dis-

Ell-l l’. afoul avenue, was cured of a. desire to

buck .1l.il. was then hitched up with Mr.

Uurlcfs horse and driven around the ring. 3

, Packs of ﬁrecrackers were set off under their
{ feet, nrmi’uls of newsmipers ﬁred in their
E faces and they hardly uppenred frightened.
A kicker was next cured and then a young
. horse from Hoboken was brought in. He
has smashed half a dozen wagons, kicked
several men—one is in the hospital at present
—illlll was altogether a badly spoiled animal.
It was utter twenty minutes as docile in bar-
ness as out and “"119 not afraid of anything.

very vicious horses
plenty of fun is expected.

TAMHG WILD HORSES. ' l
l Professor Glam-son's Extraordinary and
Interesting Show.

Abright bay horse with a white 1103
wlntcliinil foot was walking across the: and a
ring in the Fifth Avenue Casino at 81511311181}
last evening. wondering what all the. peglllglli

ﬂannel shirts who accosted him, and on

whom seized his bridle. The horse Shocke h9f
hen-.1 and started back indignantly. Look'18
swiftly around him be perceived that thelng
roughly dressed men were directed by a. tall lolwo
llall'cil man of dark complexion. arrayed in’nang
blue ﬂannel shirt, buckskin trousers and lofii
bunt... rm. individual held in his hiindalongu
keen looking whip. The bay horse surmised that
he had fallen into the hands of bi'igands and that
this was their chief. Before he could ask for any
explanation of his seizure the tall. long haired
mt”) began to read in a very loud voice what he
$31.1 was the record of the bay horse. This prec-
lous document was anonymous, yet on the
strength of it the tall dark man attacked the
horse's reputation. alleging that he wasa halter
who had distinguished himself by Jumping

 

kicker and was, possessed of sundry other dis-
agreeable qualities. The horse was just about to
challenge his accuser for proof of his assertions
when he found that the roughly dressed young
men had made him a prisoner, fastening his head
to a rcpe that hung down from a. beam in the
middle of the mom. The two men left him for a
moment and when they returned one bore in his
hand an umbrella and the other carried a. drum.
They beat the drum and put the umbrella upon
his head. The bay horse thought his last hour
had come and he determined to make his exit with
eclat. He stood upon his hind legs and snorted
and cavorted and cavorted and snorted. By and
by, when he found that the umbrella. did not bite
and the drum had no kiCk or scratch in it, he l
stood perfectly still and allowed himself to be in-
troduced to various objects which had. always
been a source of dread to him because he had not
understood them. He had discovered that the
place he was in was not a. brigandfs lair, but an
equine college and that the tall, dark, long haired
man was its chief professor, Oscar ll. Gleason,
the great horse tamer.
A lively, nervous looking gray horse with sweep-
ing mane and tail was the next animal to make
his debut. Professor Gleason remarked that
when gray horses had bad habits they were more
dangerous than horses of any other color. The
attendants hitched the gray horse up with a.
queer looking system of lines that gave his driver
,9. leverage not only on his head but also on his
ffore feet. Then the professor started in to drive
him and there was fun. He pulled his driver
around in the sawdust till suddenly his fore feet
were seized by the lines that route them. Pre-
vious calls of "Whoa!” had passedimheeded. but
now that leverage was applied immediately after
the word was uttered the animal could not move
forward. He stood on his hind legs and gave 33
ﬁne on exhibition of fancy sparring as has been
seen in the city lately: He was mad clear through
and frightened. He shivered all over with ner-
vousness and his nostrils twinkledirom his rapid
indignant breathing. In ten minutes $138 pro-
fessor had him so tame that he hitched him to a
pidly around the
ring with an open bridle, discharging ﬁrearms b1?”
hind him. The horse was then assaulted by t 3
attendants with umbrellas. drums.b8118 and 3'

on the second ﬂoor of N0. 203 Montague
street, on Wednesday evening 133?» by one
George A. Anderson, Who is janitor of the
building. On the afternoon of the evening
mentioned a good-sized dog was taken With a
fit on the corner of Court and Joralenion
streets. lE’rettw soon a crowd, amour: whom

was Delaney, collected about the animal. ,
After it recovered from the {It Delaney l

it around the dog he proceeded

to his oriﬁce, reaching there a few

minutes later.

this time thedog had. become ﬁery weak, and
fearing that it was gomg to die he called in
Janitor Anderson and told him that he would

give him 50 cents if he could keep the dog; .
The Janitor *-

' replied that-he “did not think there was So

‘Then said Delaney “l‘hrow it out of the

is-seized the animal and tossed 1t out of the
window to the pavement below. As the dog
was approaching the sidewalk a. gentleman,
who happened to be passmg by, barely es-
caped being struck by it. The dog lanxled on
i its front paws and broke both fore legs. .1t

In the meantime Superintendent Clark, of
the b'ociety for the Prevention of Cruelty to
’ Animals, had been noriiied of the occurrence,
and he had one of the society’s oliicers on the
spot in less than twenty minutes after the an-
imal had been pitched into the street. Several
witnesses who saw Anderson throw the dog

out of the window called to see Mr. Clark that -

evening, and each and every one of them told
him that as soon as the dog had left Auden
son’s hands Delaney stepped up to the window
and looked out.

Bothbelaney and Anderson,when questioned
by the society’s officers regarding the matter,

they denied all knowledge of it. However, the ,

to make a clean breast of it since he saw
Superintendent Clark was determined to cap-
ture and punish the guilty party, called at the
society’s office and said he did order Ander-
son to “throw the dog out of the window," and
stated further that he was w1lling to shoulder
. all the responsibility and blame. Anderson
called at the allies a little later and acknowl-
edged what he had done, saying that he would
not have done so had he not thought the dog
was dead. Delaney also claims that the
animal was dead before it was thrown into the
street. Delaney in his effort to get rid of the
dog seems to have lost at least a part of his
discretion, for his action would have been a
violation of a city Ordinance even 1f the dog
had died before it was hurled from the win—

. periment, which did not result in a convic- ,1.

tion, but it led to the disclosure of such
barbarities perpetrated in the name of
science, as to result in the passage of a law
for the restriction of vivisection. In this
country the scientist and the
charlatau alike claim the I right
to inﬂict torture at their own discretion.

In the absence of any legislation upon
the subject, we shall always feel that we are
justiﬁed in prosecuting those who,.,perform
experiments, accompanied by severe pain,
upon animag, merely for the purpose of
demonstrati n to students, of what they can
equally wellﬁl’gf taught at the clinic “or on
the dissectinh‘table. In this we are sus- ;
tained by the. authority of some of the
greatest surgeons in England and in this
country also. In Trinity College, in Dublin,
nita'sizzgle vialsc’c'tionai experiment ‘01 at?
kind whatever is allowed, yet Lawson Tait,
the celebrated English surgeon, stated that
the students who come to him from there,
to be examined, are as well acquainted with
surgery, and as fully qualiﬁed to become
surgeons, as those _ from the London _and
Edinburgh Colleges where vivisection is so
greatly practiced. Someof the most emi-
ncnt physicians of England when sum-
moned to appear before the Royal Commis- .
mission for the investigation of this subject, ‘
declared that experiments .or class demon-
stration were in their opinion unnecessary,

 

 

 

 

_ cruel and demoralizing.

The argument reported to have been urged
by Dr. Shimwell, that if we object to
vivisectional experiments, we ought to
object to killing animals for our food
and other corporal necessities, seems to me
most illogical. We believe that we have been,
given by God, dominion over the lower orders of
creation, within certain bounds, and that we .
have a perfect right to inﬂict death upon them ‘
when our needs would seem to require it, pro.
vided it is done as quickly and humanely as:
possible. We do not believe, however, that we
have any right to inﬂict lengthened torture. l
There wedraw the line distinctly, and the law ; ,
sustains'us in it. We prosecute the farmer or E
the butcher who bleeds his calves slowly to:
death, instead of giving them at once the “coup f
dc grace," we prosecute the employees atthe;
abattoir, who, strikes a. steer en“ the head a blow l
which does/not kill him, and wait some time;
before giving him the ﬁnal stroke; we prosecute g '

In. a 7’ by " " ” ‘ v1
RIGHTS AND WRON GS OF DOGS.
There is a good deal of feeling just now, onj-

Palisade avenue, because three valuable dogs?

have been recently poisoned. At the request:

of a party who felt aggrieved, on Thursday
wepublished the following section from the

Penal Code : ' I

SECTION 660.—-A person who unjustiﬁably
administers any poisonous or noxious drug
or substance to an animal, or unjustiﬁably'
exposes any such drug or substance with in-
tent that the same shall be taken by an ani—
mal, whether such animal be the property
of himself or another, is guilty of a misde-
manner.

The question arises, however, Whether the
owner of a dOg is not bound to keep it from
trespassing on a neighbor’s grounds to the
annoyance of that neighbor, and even to the
injury of his property ? V ‘

For example, a. certain gentleman delighted
in the ownership of two graceful greyhounds.
They seemed handsome and harmless enough
upon the street—but at the sight of a cat,
even though it might be a family pet and on a
private premises, the bounds would bound
over any fence, and if they caught the cat
they would kill it.

Again, a gentleman who experienced the
keenest delight in beautifying his grounds
with“ charming ﬂower beds, discovered one
spring morning that during the night playful
dogs belonging to neighbors had scratched
up his ﬂower beds, and left the plants scat-
tered about the grounds in a damaged if not
in a worthless condition.

Now, we never heard of a case of a man who
had caught a thief trespassing on his property
in a steel-trap being punished as an offender
against the law; and we presume no one will
pretend that a. man has a. right to trespass on
his neighbor’s property, and especially to his
injury. Is a dog lawfully permitted to do
what its owner has no right to do? If a man,
ﬁnding dogs constantly roaming over his I
grounds, and injuring his property, shall
place “any poisonous or noxious drug” about!
his ﬂower-beds to protect himself from the
ravages of a neighbor’s dogs, the question is _
whether he “unjustiﬁably exposes” such drug.

If a horse or a cow shall invade private
grounds and injure property the owner of
such horse or cow is liable for the damage -
and we suppose the same rule will apply to a
1 . But it is easy to prove damage by a
ho 39 or cow, while this cannot be said of a
deg-l Dogs may gambol over a man’s grounds
at night: howling and scratching and doing
most provoking damage to ﬂowers and gar-

den; and if the injured party should feel dis—
osed to claim C'Ompensation by a suit there
would be great diﬁculty in producing the ne- ,

cessary proof. ,
While a man may harm a. moral and legal

 

right to keep and love a (103. it would seem
but equitable that he should so keep it that it
will not offensively trespass upon a neigh-

bor’s 81'0“

nds or damage his property.

dissipation was the occupation of a chair
during the evening in Benedict’s undertak-
ing rooms on the Opposite corner. Every
night. while his wife was feeding her
twenty-seven cats, he walked across the!
way to smoke his cigar. Just one weeltbe-
tore he died he left the shop at 9 o’clock
and never came back. Inquiry for him re-
vealed the fact that he was very sick, up in :

his rooms with his wife and the cats. The i

seriousness of his illness was not discov-i

ered, however, until the last day, when

Mrs. Duncan knocked at Dr. Knox’s back
; door. -

”Duncan’s dead. ” was all she said, in
sepulchral niatter-of-fact tones. and then
she vanished upstairs.

The Doctor went up and found a curious
state of affairs. The body lay upon a bed in
the front room. which was separated by ai
wire screen irom the middle room. There
the cats were asleep on the ﬂoor, on the

chairs. on the window-sill. One old miss.
with her progeny of nine. was ensconced in a

which appeared in the TIMES exclusively yes- .

l terday, Superintendent HankinsOn, of the

; Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Ani-

1 nals, accompanied by two of his ofﬁcers, A.

‘ S. Evans and William Denyse, made a raid
on a Vlle cow stable in the town of Jamaica
yesterday, and had the proprietor arrested ‘

" and punished in short order. The stable, lo-
cated in Woodnaven south, was complained)

" of ‘ as a foul place, the worst of it
being that the cows conﬁned there were'
milch cows, fed on the vilest swill, and that
their milk was sold to consumers. The
ofﬁcerofound the place fully as bad as rep- ,\
resented. The proprietor, Luke Horstmanﬁ
who owns a big farm, of which the offensive
stables form a part, was highly indignant
when he learned the mission of the strangers
who seemed to take so deep an interest in his ,
' affairs, and he said he would get the better
of them though he had to spend $1,000. An
investigation by the ofﬁcers showed that 7
Horstman kept twenty-two cows conﬁned
in a dark and unventilated stable laden .
with mephitic odors emitted from a mass of ‘5
ﬁlth several inches deep on the ﬂoor, which
were reinforced by a noisome stench wafted :
from a number of barrels ﬁlled With swill. p .
This stuff, festering in the torrid tempera .
ture, was chieﬂy refuse from hotel hitchens, '

and was inexpressibly rank, so much so that ‘_
one of the ofﬁcers was twice made, such while 3
‘ making an examination of it. _ It contained '1 '
a spuing of cigar stumps, With here and
there bits of‘old leather, ﬁshes’ heads and
decayed hen fruit. The oﬁicers liberated
the cows and permitted them to go out on
the grass in “the open air. Superinten—
i‘dent Hankinson siad the moment the
poor animals found themselves outside and ,
.free they frisked about like young lambs,
fairly kicking up their heels for JOY. Horst-
man was then put under arrest and taken to
J amaica,where, before Justice Hendrickson,
he was proceeded against under section 14 ‘
of the Penal Code, which prov1des that any :
one who keeps milch cows in an unclean _
I. place or feeds them on swﬂl shall be guilty of q

l a misdemeanor. The prisoner was deﬁant at '

‘ ﬁrst-but cooled dOWn and pleaded guilty.

? The Judge ﬁnedhim $50,. 7 for which he gave .

a check at once. The alien: created a decided _1 .

l sensation. Paul and'Luke having been pun-l \

cished, the ofﬁcers are looking. after Matthew

canine property has no parallel in London.
There the owner of a dog, provided he acts up to

 

the law and muzzles his dog, has but little chance

of permanently losing him unless the dog deliber-
ately runs his head into a. noose. In the ﬁrst place
it is the duty of the police and their emissaries to
“arrest” any obviously lost dog seen in the streets
of London.

The dog is than taken to the station house and

thence is conveyed in a wagon, with other unfor— ~

'tunates, to the Home for Lost‘ Dogs at Battersea.

l This institution has been in existence 8. number of i
7 years and is supported entirely by voluntary con— '

tributions and by proceeds of the sale of unclaimed
dogs and fees charged for those that are claimed.

A visit to the Dog’s Home is one of the sights of
London. The best way is to ride from. Victoria and
get out at Battersea Bark Road. Close to the sta-
tion, indeed under the archway of the railway is
the home. The buildings are not pretentious, but
scientiﬁcally built and no
space has been lost. The ﬁrst entrance leads
to the ofﬁce. There the visitor is met by an
inquiry as to whether he is in search of a lost dog
or wishes to buy an unclaimed one. A ticket is
then made out granting permission to enter, which

the visitor hands to a dog keeper in attendance

3 and the visit is begun.

THE KENNELF. .

The kennels are so divided that not only are the 3

sexes separated, but dogs of different breeds as
well are kept apart. Here can be seen in one ken-
nel half a hundred mastiﬁ‘s, retrieversg and dogs of
that ilk, while near by are twice that number of
agile fox terriers making their lamentable com.
plaints for lost masters and home comforts. Here

again is a ﬁghting bulldog accorded a. place to him- ;

self by reason of his combatative propensities,
All are snug and comfortable. andthe kennels a,“

' wonderfully Clean andrdry. Each’set‘of’drogs has a?
covered kennel and also a yard in which to run, 3
and as there is a plentiful supply of water the '

place is washed down several times a day. ,The
food is cooked in an outhouse, andconsists chieﬂy
of dog biscuits with meal and in some cases even

i better f°°d'. At 0315 01nd is a, dog hospital, where

 

 

k.

cases of mange are treated. Each dog when
brought to the home is entered in a book and is
kept fora, week. At the end of that time he be-

comersthe property 0f the home. and if he is valu- l

J

able 3. price is ﬁxed on him and, he is marked for ;

sale. Owners have lost their vested rights in .‘
the dogs if they are left unclaimed for more;

than seven days, and have to purchase their‘
late property 13.1 the Same way as strangers. With ;
this knowledge the owner of the lost dog communi- 5
cates with-the'ituthoritles at. Battersea immedi- ?

were restored to their owners. Most of the e . '
being homeless vagrants were destroyed. The,
amount of money receivetfduring the past year was?
about $25,000, and of this about $8,001.) came from,

1 the sale of and less from dogs brought to thof
i llome. The rest came Lrom legacies, donations and

subscriptions. ,
How vacnaxrs ARE DE'sTnorEo. ‘
it is not only in the housing and feeding of dogs,
that the Home excels. At least 20,000 dogs are de- ,'
stroyed each year, and it is done in the most _

, humane way possible-—one that the managers of "

the New York dog pound could take a. lesson from.
This part of the Home Was built from plans made by
professor Benjamin Ward, Richardson in 1883, and
has been regularly used since that date.

The lethal chamber has a double wall, the inner
one of white glazed brick and, the outer of ordi-
nary bricks, coated with cement, and the inter-
spacc is lined with silicate cotton. The chamber is
closed at all parts except at the front, where there
are sliding doors; and at the escape pipe or ﬂue.

The chamber is so constructed that a cage, in
which the doomed vagrants have been placed, can
be rapidly run into it on wheels and can be as
quickly enclosed by pulling down the doors.

Before the animals to be destroyed are placed in
the chamber the chamber itseli is fully charged
with narcotic vapor, produced by passing carbonic
oxide over'a. surface of anaesthetic mixture, com-
posed of chloroform and bi-sulphide of carbon.
The carbonic oxide is obtained by the combustion
of the carbon in the two condensing stoves at one
side of the chamber, as seen in the illustration.

To make the action of the carbonic oxide more
certain and to keep the chamber at all times lethal
there is an extra provision. At the two points where
the tubes from the stoves enter thechambertwo of
Doallon’s glazed cylinders are interposed. which
are three feet long and eight inches broad and are
tilled loosely with Verity’s patent gas that. This
substance is so porous it takes up the narcotic
tluid most readily, holds it in its pores and gives it
up in volumes of vapor when the warm gas is
passed over it. Into the cylinders supplying this
porous fuel there is an opening at the top for sup-
plying the ﬂuid, which is closed with a stopper, and
at the end )f the box standing out at a right angle
from it is a continuous section, in which there is a
large tap for regulating the currents of, gas from
the stoves. _ ‘

When the stoves are in action the tap is turned
on and the gases from the stoves pass through the
cylinders over the porous fuel into the chamber.
Nothing more is done until just before the time
when the animals in the cage are to be introduced.
Then ten ounces of the anaesthetic mixture are

. _ ._* ~-..._..__...——

 

poured upon the fuel through the openings in this
top of the cylinders, the openings being named -
ately closed. After the dogs are in “the chamber
ten ounces more of the same mixture is added, and
if, after one or two minutes, any of the narcotized
animals are found to be still breathing ten ounces“
more may be given, but this is never found neces-
sar . , .. ..

Ay natural question suggests itself, How can 1t
1 be determined that the animals are breathing .or
not? To get at this fact the test of hearing is dile-
eovered to be the best. There is inserted into t _e
chamber a stethoscope the mouth of whliclh is
trumpet shaped and closed When not use y a
slide. On listening through the tube theb‘ (“du-
tlnued breathing of even a Sin dog can e e;
. tected and the operatorscan 311 go whether or no
i more of the ﬂuid is required.

The New ark Passenger Railway Com patty
to Be Prosecutetl.

The Superintendent of the Newark Passenger
Railway Company of Newark, N. 5., appeared
yesterday before the Executive Committee of
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, and explained how it came to pass
that the Society’s officers lately had. cause to
make complaint in the courts against the
Company. 3

W hen the Newark Passenger ﬂailway Com-
pally bought the lines and stable last year, he
said, Eighty of the worst of the horses were
sold. The stable foreman was instructed not
to work any sick or sore horses, but; he had
sometimes neglected these orders, the Super-
intendent said, and had been discharged in
consequence. in spite of this e’kcuse, the Corn.-
nilttee decried to press the two suits they have
brought against the Company for cruel treat-
ment oi their horses. ; '

_‘ uses of cruel persons and to prosecute oi!-

E3!end'ers oi the "cruelty to animals ” law, ar-

lrived' 1n Lockport last Friday and registered

Eat the Commercial Hotel. They will remain

Enearly all this week and investigate all
'E‘ cruelty cases which come before their obser-
ration. 1
‘ E Ofﬁcer Snowden made the JOURNAL of—
3 ‘ files a pleasant call this morning,

Mr. John P. Hames, president of the
IE‘A'merican Society for the Prevention of
; Cruelty to Animals, while in Utica last June,
made a personal investigation of the condi- '

tion of the horses and mules employed in
{towing the canal boats through that place.

What he saw convinced him that something
must be done to alleviate the sufferings of
“ these poor animals, and to that end detailed
E two experienced oﬂicers from the New York
)5 . headquarters, Messrs. F. S. Snowden and
‘John H. Gray, to work at various points

along the Erie and Champlain canals.
; The oﬂicers have been out since July lst
«f and have made arrests for causmg badly
lIgI'Ialled mules to be worked at Cohoes,
l

 

Schenectady, Little Falls and Utica on the
Erie, and at Mechanicville and Stillwater on
. the Champlain canal. In all cases the
‘g‘captains were ﬁned iromten to twentyiivs
;, dollars and their stock not allowed to be put
" on the tow-path again until their wounds
were healed. Under the vigorous prosecu-
E! tiou of these ofﬁcers boatmen are beginning
to understand that they must take better
care of their animals and the stock is now
3 reported in much better shape than at the
beginning of the season.

While in Lockport the officers will co- -
Operate with the local society. ComplaintsE
relating to any phase or cruelty to animals
-‘ent to them at the Commercial Hotel, or E

eceived through the local society will be
promptly investigated.

He Is Fined, $15 for Using a. 'Balo
‘ Stick on a. Horse.

Dr. Archibald K. Robertson, chief inspector
of the local Bureau of Animal Industry, was

cruelly beating his horse with a. bale stick and
ﬁned $15. ,

Robertson was arrested ’for the oifense on
Aug: 21 by Ofﬁcer Kiley, of the Fourteenth
precinct. lie was taken to the station house
and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals was notiﬁed. Inspector Clark im-
mediately began an investigation. He sought
out several witnesses who informed him that
Robertson’s treatment of. the animal was both
brutal and unwarranted.

It appears that the accused was riding be-

tloned.I The animal became frightened, lost
its footing and fell to the ground. According.
to the story of a witness the horse’s head was
in the gutter and its feet on the sidewalk.
Robertson, becoming enraged, hastened to the
stable 3. short distance away and procured a.

 

, the animal over the head instead of trying to
, aid. it in regaining its feet.
As soon as Robertson saw Oﬁcer Kiley a1)-
‘ proachlng he tried to sneak the stick back to
the stableI.‘but he was foiled in his attempt.
. It is now 111 possession of the society, and will
, be kept as a memento of the occasion.

In June, 1884, relics of the Jeannette
were found at a point on the coast of
Greenland to which they had been carried
on a piece of ice. How could this ice have
accomplished its weird and mysterious
journey from Behring Straits to the
eastern seas? It is argued by those well
acquainted with the geography and cur-
rents of the region that the relics of the
unfortunate explorers could only have
reached Greenland by a comparatively short
and direct route across the Arctic Ocean,
by way of the North Pole. In conﬁrma-
tion of this theory we have facts which
seem like a reminiscence of the evidence
which induced Columbus to sail west.
There have been “bows found on the coast
of Greenland which are identical with
those used by the Eskimo in the vicinity
'ot Behring Straits, at Port Clarence, Nor-
»ton Sound, and the mouth of the Jukon
river, and which could only have drifted
thither on some such current as that which
'M. Nansen supposes the existence of.”
Now that the Nile has revealed its sources
,only' one great geographical mystery
remains to be cleared up. and' M. Nansen
promises an early solution of the problem,
a promise which we hope this generation
will live to see fulﬁlled.

All honor to Mr. G—eo. T. Angell for his
services in the cause of kindness to the
dumb creation. The brutes must be treated
with kindness if the heart is to be kept
soft and susceptible to moral and religious
inﬂuences. Men must be kind to the lower

creation or they will learn to be cruel to ;

their fellowmen. The ﬁrst meaning of
humanity implies a kindly fellow-feeling
with men. A bloodthirsty and unfeeling
Roman emperor commenced his horrible
career of savagery towards men by a habit
of dismembering ﬂies. Men must be treated
with loving kindness, as well as horses.
No one will accuse Mr. Angell of treating
horses badly. He has lately, he says,
printed 60, 000 copies of “Black Beauty’ ’—
the Uncle Tom’s Cabin of the horse, as he
enthusiastically calls it.
I This book is written by an English
lwoman, Anna Sewell by name.
Q It is the autobiography of an English
horse. “The book contains 260 pages, and
over 100,000 copies have been already sold
in England.”

“Through the gifts of friends of ‘The
American Humane Education Society,’
Mr. Angell tells us that he has been able to
have the book electrotyped, and to print it
to be sold at the marvellously low price

of twelve cents a copy, though to people .

sending by mail fer them eight cents addi—
tional for postage must be charged.”

Mr. Angell generously wishes to give
away thousands of copies of this book.
He would like to put it into every home,
every workshop, and every school in this
country, and he would like to make a free
gift of it to every man and boy in the
universe.

This is certainly very generous of Mr.
Angell. The cause of the horse will doubt-
less be served by giving away “thousands
of copies of this book.” We have however
looked in vain through Mr. Angell’s glow-
ing prospectus to see whether he has con—
salted “the English woman, Anna Sewell
b? name,” before he so prodigally presents
to other people property which is hers and
hers only. This property is valuable;
103,000 copies of “Black Beauty” have
been sold in London alone, and Mr.
Angell is issuing a big edition, which he
is Offering at a nominal price. It may be

quite possible that Mr. Angell has made
arrangements with the author so that he can
make presents of her goods to other people
without any moral dishonesty. We wish
he had stated so in the announcement
which we have before us. If he has not
made any such arrangement, we can only
say that in caring for horses he is doing a
wrong to authors and injuring the cause
0f morality in this country. A horse is
not so noble an animal as a man, and we
see nothing but moral obliquity in making
a fuss over one department of the ethical
code and at the same time publicly and
ﬂagrantly violating the commandment
which says “Thou shalt not steal.”

An old-time annual contributor to the
work of Nashotah having passed away, his
heirs have united in making a gift of
$6,000'to the Permanent Fund in his
memory. By this peculiarly happy and
graceful benefaction the work which he
loved is helped in yet larger measure than
in his lifetime, and a most reasonable
relief is given at Nashotah from the
anxiety which is so keenly felt by those
who are carrying on one of the older ven-
tures of faith for the Church whenever
and old and tried friend enters into the
rest of Paradise. We must respect the
reserve which, as in his lifetime, still
withholds the names of these true friends
from the world; but at Nashotah, doubt-
less, their work for His Church will go
on as long as He has work for His
Church on earth to do.

An'Ill-Narnred Truck Driver Knocked
Out by Flying Heels. '

Joseph O’Neil. twenty-ﬁve years old. of
No. 51 Rutgers street. was driving a truck
through White street yesterday when the
horse fell in front of No. 68. O’Neil and
another truckn’ian lashed the prostrate ani.
mal with their whips until he struggled to
his feet. He could not stand and fell again.
This was repeated several times and it was
apparent to the crowd that had collected
that the animal was too sick to keep on his
feet. The crowd protested against the man.
nerin which the horse was being treated.
but 1t had _no_ eﬂect on the drivers.

3 in one of his attempts to rise the horse
struckpout h1s heels and hit O‘Neil in the
abdomen and on the wrist. O’Neil was
kn ocke‘d down and was taken by friends to
the Chambers Street Hospital. He was
.badly inJured. The horse was subsequently
taken away in an ambulance belonging to
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals. No tears were shed for O’Neil.
