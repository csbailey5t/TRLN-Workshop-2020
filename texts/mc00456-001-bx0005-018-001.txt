for Treatment. Assists in the Education of the

Painlessly destroys Animals, Young on the proper care of
when necessary. Animals.

A Great Preacher who had travelled much was once asked
the name of his parish. “The World is my Parish,” was his
reply. A glance at the picture on the corner of this Booklet
will show that the P.D.S.A. is not content to work within a limited
locality, but would reach any country needing its help. From
a humble beginning in the East End of London the work has
increased throughout England, to France, Roumania, North Africa,
East Indies and Cairo, and it is our aim to go into every quarter
of the globe until we can say, “The World is our Workshop.”

Through our remedial and educational activities, we would
take our place in that mighty effort which through countless
agencies is ever seeking to plead the cause of the oppressed and
to support the weak and downtrodden—without which, civilisa-
tion would soon return to barbarism. We thus take our stand
in that vast army of reformers and pioneers, who believing that
all Life is one, can never rest until every member in the great family
of Life receives just and proper treatment—for in that family the
animal is our lesser brother.

How far up to the present time we have succeeded in our
great undertaking, both at home and abroad, the following pages
wi I tell :—

THE P.D.S.A. AT HOME HAS:—

An Animals Sanatorium on the outskirts of East London.

4 Hospitals: at the Sanatorium, Nottingham, Bootle
and Eallng, with rarely any vacancies.

4 Ambulances to convey Accident and Emergency Cases to
the Sanatorium and Hospitals.

7| well-equipped Dispensaries, often so over-crowded
that many people have to wait their turn in the streets.

8 Caravan Dispensaries travelling throughout England.

Temporary Dispensaries work at times in old Sheds,
Garages, Stables and disused Public Houses, and Caravans

take their stand in Blind Alleys, Market Places, Gypsy En-
campments, Disused Yards, on Village Greens and under-
neath Railway Arches.

THE P.D.S.A. ABROAD has :—-

l Hospital and Dispensary at Tangier. At work for
10 years.

2 Dispensaries in Paris. At work for 4 years.

1 Hospital and 2 Dispensaries and 1 Caravan in Roumania.
At work for 2 years.

1 Caravan in Bali, East Indies. At work for 2.years.
1 Hospital and Dispensary in Cairo. The gift of an animal
lover. Staff recently left to take up their duties.

All Kinds of Animals are Treated.

OVER ONE MILLION CASES TREATED DURING THE
YEAR.

 

We should again like to emphasise—~that in addition to the
enormous number of animals treated and the number of owners
who receive help and instruction on the needs of their animals,
the great importance of our work among the children in each
nation where we are established. By their readiness to listen
to what we have to say and their eagerness to bring lost and
injured animals and birds to the P.D.S.A. we feel that we are not
only laying the foundation for a better world for the animals in
the days to come, but at the same time, are taking our share in
the education of the children themselves.

We will leave it to the pictures and details of cases in this
Book to tell further about the P.D.S.A.

 

 

 

By kind permission of the Dean of Canterbury, the P.D.S.A.
Annual Church Service will be held at Canterbury Cathedral
on Sunday, August 16th, 1936.

 

The Sanatorium.

The P.D.S.A. Sanatorium is the Headquarters of all P.D.S.A.
Technical activity, the pivot around which the whole organisation

A Visit to the Stables.

Extracts from a visitor’s account of a visit to the Stables:-—-—

“ The Stables at the P.D.S.A. Sanatorium see many strange
inmates. Horses naturally predominate, but Goats and Donkeys
have been lodged there. Every conceivable kind of poor man’s
Horse appears at one time or another to have stayed there. To
most of them, the spacious stables with clean straw underfoot and
a well-filled manger, must have come as a revelation and foretaste

of Paradise.

“ The first patients I saw there were two Ponies, one with a
large tumour on its neck, and the other with a badly torn heel
as the result of a collision which detached the shafts of the cart
it was pulling, causing the pony to be knocked down. In its fright
it bolted until Stopped by a policeman. The P.D.S.A. Ambulance
was sent for and conveyed the injured animal to the Sanatorium.

“The owners of both these Ponies were hawkers and their
animals their only support.

“ The next patient was a Horse belonging to a rag and bone
man ; the Horse had fallen and injured its leg and had been fetched
by the P.D.S.A. Ambulance to the Sanatorium. In the next
Stable was a Gipsy’s Horse, with a horrible abscess on one foot,
whose suffering had been greatly aggravated by its owner’s
ignorant treatment. '

“A very sad case was that of 3 Pony whose owner, a woman,
had been working it in an unfit condition. This poor woman,
mother of four children, had been deserted by her husband and
was now eking out an existence by hawking fruit and vegetables.
She had recently bought the Pony, having been told it was six
years old ; but in a few weeks’ time it became obvious that its
age was nearer sixteen than six. In fact it turned out to be twenty
years old. It was being tested and treated at the Sanatorium,
but it will never be fit for much further service! I under-

stand.

”I noticed the gratitude of some of the Horses’ owners.
Often they only express it in a handshake, but it was sincere and
heartfelt.

“As I left the Stables late in the evening, it was a sight to
warm the heart to see the Horses so content. Here was one
quietly munching away at his food ; here another settling down
to sleep, while a third was already couched in its warm soft bed.
Peace and contentment had settled upon them. They had for-
gotten the sorrows of yesterday, and to-morrow was yet to
come.”

There is accommodation for 20 cases and very rarely is there
a vacancy.

Some Cases :

A. Gipsy from a local encampment put his Horse out to grass.
Taking a walk in that direction one Sunday afternoon, he called
to see his Horse and found it standing in a field with a large wound
on the off hind-leg, filled with maggots and surrounded by thou-
sands offlies. He appealed to us for help. We took the ambulance
and after crossing two ploughed fields we reached the animal
and conveyed him to the Sanatorium. On arrival, it was found
that the whole leg was gangrenous and, treatment being hope-
less, It was put out of its misery.

A Pony belonging to a coal hawker was down in his stable in
the East End of London. We found the Pony lying in a filth)’
stable so small that it could not possibly get up. It was in great
pain, suffering from a stoppage. To get the Pony out we were
obliged to knock away one side of the Stable and practically carry
the animal 25 yards to get it into the ambulance. It was 25 years

old and absolutely worn out. Recovery was hopeless. It was
put out of Its misery.

*6 A small greengrocer hired a Pony to do his round. One evening,

 

3“ he was run into by a motor car and the shaft of the cart ran into

-TY- the buttocks, causing a wound six inches deep. The greengrocer

NY was taken by ambulance to the Hospital—our ambulance fetched
the Pony to the Sanatorium, where it made a good recovery.

One Day’s Work with an Ambulance.

This is a P.D.S.A. Assistant’s Report of one day’s work
on an Ambulance. It is an average day.

6.30 a.m. Visit to a Dog about three miles away. Found Dog
was suffering from distemper, teething trouble and fits. Gave a
sedative and made a jacket. Gave a warm drink—the first for
three days. Left him asleep and snuggling between two hot water
bottles. Gave instruction until my visit the next day.

7.45 a.m. Arrived at Sanatorium. Went' immediately to an
accident case one mile away. Found Dog lying in the road, having
been run over and crushed by a lorry loaded with sand. It was
vomiting blood and writhing in agony. Covered him with my
coat and chloroformed him.

9a.m. Returned to Sanatorium and again went immediately
to another accident case. This time a Dog who had jumped through
a glass door. lts injuries were so terrible that it looked as if it had
been through a mincing machine. Lifted him into the Ambulance
and attended to his wounds and injuries, made an Elizabethan
Collar to prevent him licking the wounds and gave final instructions
to owner.

11.30 a.m. Returned to Sanatorium. Did not get out of Ambu-
lance but departed to a Dog 7 miles away, injured on a railway line.
He had crawled under the wooden steps ofa railway bridge,only
his tail being visible. It was impossible to move him. My assistant
crawled beneath the bridge with a sponge soaked in chloroform
at the end of a stick, and soon the Dog was asleep—as also was
nearly my assistant! Both recovered from the effects of the
chloroform and fortunately the Dog was not badly injured. We
gave a nerve sedative and found the owner.

1.30 p.m. Returned to Sanatorium, and was informed that a
Dog was bleeding to death some two miles away. I found him
screaming and bleeding profusely,—the result of asplintered bone
in the rectum. I removed the splinter and gave treatment and

advice. Afterwards I visited other patients who were progressing
favourably.

5 p.m. Returned to Sanatorium and received a sheaf of calls
for Ambulance cases, including a Cat who had given birth to two
kittens and was in great pain owing to being unable to deliver the

remainder of her litter. I helped the poor animal and soon all
was well. ‘

Visited 14 other cases too ill or injured to be brought for treat-
ment.

12 midnight. Returned to Sanatorium having finally com-
pleted my rounds, had my supper and prepared for bed. But
it is the night of 5th November and there was a night of nerve
and accident cases.

FREQUENT CALLS ARE RECEIVED TO RESCUE HORSES INJURED OR SICK
ON MARSH LAND OR GYPSY ENCAMPMENTS. IN THE ABOVE PICTURE
THREE P.D.S.A. MEN ARE ATTENDING A HORSE WITH A BROKEN LEG.

At 10 o’clock one evening an urgent call from the Police informing us that a
Horse was in a hopeless position in a bog nearby. We went post-haste to the
scene. The Horse was slowly sinking in the water and soft mud and the tide
was coming in. Another hour and it would have been too late as, when we arrived
the head and part of the neck were all that could be seen.

A rather precarious sling was forced round one fore-leg and over the shoulder.
Carrying out this operation was no easy matter as one Assistant was working
up to his waist in the mud and had to be held from the bank. Slowly the animal
was pulled out until it was possible to get a sling round its chest and it was then
soon hauled on to the bank. It was there cleaned of the mud and well rubbed
down and stimulants were given. After three days’ treatment at the Sana-
torium it was fit to go home.

A call was received from a travelling Gipsy encampment. A Horse was down
in a field. We found the Horse lying on the ground and unable to rise. We
administered first-aid treatment and with great difficulty got it into the ambu-
lance and brought it to the Sanatorium. The Horse, named Ronuk—whose
owner refused to leave the Sanatorium and sat on the gates on and off for three
days—was suffering from buttercup poisoning, having been turned out to grass
on some land on which a great number of buttercups were growing. For three
days and nights we worked upon him and we were then able to give some hope
of recovery. On hearing this, the owner went on his way, satisfied. The Horse
was temporarily blind, but has now recovered and has gone back to his owner.

A ‘MORNING CONVERSATION’ IN A CORNER OF OUR FIELDS.

Many of the Horses and Ponies brought to the P.D.S.A. know
nothing of fresh grass or green fields. Their lives have been an

everlasting toiling through crowded streets; tramcars, omni-_

buses and motor-cars have dulled their senses, hard unsympathetic
streets have jarred their bones and nerves and have taken toll
of their youth and vigour; conscious only of the road ahead
and the load behind they work their weary lives away. What
happiness must be theirs when first they are turned out on the
fields and paddocks ! How timid their first few hesitant steps !

One Horse was led into a field only with the utmost difficulty. -

It would not go through the gate and it was not until a basinfulof
oats was used to tempt it that it could be induced to enter the
field. At first it loitered near the gate and fence, gradually ven-
turing further afield and then it sampled the grass. A neigh of
delight gave evidence of its enjoyment of this unlimited feast.
But when the time came for it to be brought indoors it would not
allow itself to be caught and it was not until five men had been
summoned that, tired but triumphant, it allowed itself to be
gently led away. -

Sometimes 30 Horses are convalescing or resting in the fields.

The Small Animals’ Ward.

 

,.

Our Dog Ward accommodates 28 patients. It consists of a small
surgery, a kitchen for the preparation of food and twenty kennels of
various sizes. Each kennel has an indoor section with a saw-dust strewn
concrete floor, and an out-door run (See picture above). One end of
the Ward is reserved for Cats, Monkeys and other small animals.

During the last year 450 animals have been treated in our Small Animals
Ward. 215 of which were surgical cases.

One wet afternoon, an old unemployed man walked wearily to the Sanatorium
carrying a dirty bundle in his arms. He had walked many miles and the bundle
was a small black and tan Terrier wrapped in an old sack. The little Dog was
covered with supperating wounds and one eye was terribly injured—the result
ofa dog-fight some days previously. The injured eye was treated and the wounds
thoroughly cleansed, large pieces of dead flesh having to be cut away. For days
the little chap hung between life and death. Hot-water bottles day and night,
small sips of brandy and warm milk every hour and careful nursing at last pre-
vailed and the dog made a good recovery.

A small Terrier was brought in in a pitiful condition. He was fully con-
scious, yet blind, deaf and rigid as a board. The owner had been driving stakes
with a heavy hammer, to make a chicken-run. The head ofthe hammer had flown
off and hit the Dog on the top of the head as he was frisking around his master.
We placed him in abasket lined with flannel and surrounded him with hot water
bottles. Gradually he became less rigid and at the end of a week began to try
to stand and showed signs of regaining his sense of balance, although he was
still blind. After a fortnight he could walk a few steps and sight returned to a
certain extent. After a month’s care he was able to return home. .

A poor woman, in great distress. brought her Cat—her only companion—
with a badly iniured tail. “ Always waiting for me when I come home from
selling my flowers in the streets." We amputated the tail and all was well.

A poor old man called early one morning, pushing a ramshackle old peram-
bulator on which was a derelict gramophone, a bundle of dirty rags and a sorrowful

25

 




 

collie. The old man’s wife had died and he had walked with his scanty possessions
from Portsmouth seeking work. On the journey his Dog, which was now his
sole companion, had become lame and he had been obliged to add its weight to
the already overburdened perambulator. He besought us to do all we could to
ensure a speedy recovery for the Dog. We found considerable inflammation of
one forefoot. An X-Ray photograph showed a foreign body which had evidently
worked in between the pads of the foot. An operation was performed and a
sharp splinter of metal was removed. The Dog made a good recovery and was
able to rejoin his master in his wanderings within a fortnight.

Inverted eyelids are one of the commonest of the many surgical cases admitted
to the Ward. In such cases the eyelids have grown inwards causing the lashes
to come into contact with the eyeball. It is, as may be imagined, a very painful
complaint, often accompanied by a continuous watering of the eye and, in bad
cases, ulceration of the eyeball. A Dog was brought by a man who had found
it, suffering from this complaint. It was in an emaciated condition, the coat
looked as ifit had never seen agrooming brush, and the eyelids had been neglected
so long that the eyes themselves had become terribly ulcerated. An operation
was performed successfully and the Dog given nourishing food and a thorough
daily grooming. At the end of a fortnight the owner was notified that his Dog
was ready to return home, and at first he refused to believe that the sleek and
shining creature was none other than the miserable little waif he had left in our
care two weeks ago.

A Cat terribly injured in the abdomen by barbed wire.

A Monkey with a broken arm caused by falling off the barrel-organ as he was
earning his living with his owner.

A woman, a hawker of vegetables, brought her Cat with its ears in a terrible
state. The Cat accompanied the woman in her cart on her rounds.

 

HERE Is,PETER—2g YEARS OLD—AN IN PATIENT HE WAS ATTACKED BY
A GREYHOUND AND TERRIBLY MANGLED, POOR LITTLE CHAP! HIS
WOUNDs WERE VERY SEVERE, ESPECIALLY ROUND THE NECK, CHEST AND
FRONT PAWS. HE SUFFERED MUCH FROM EXHAUSTION. BUT W'TH
DAY AND NIGHT NURSING HE MADE AN EXCELLENT RECOVERY.

Generally the above Bell rings many times during the night—either by people
bringing an animal, or more frequently by calls to go out to a case.

Many and varied are the experiences of the night staff; for they must be
men of resource and infinite patience. They are expected to perform miracles
of healing in the most trying conditions ; very often an upturned sugar box is
their operating table and a bicycle lamp their only illumination.

The following cases are taken from the Night Case Book :—

10 pm. A call to go 13 miles away. A Dog who had eaten through its kennel
roofed with iron sheeting. In doing so it had cut its abdomen, inflicting a
horrible wound eleven inches long. We stitched it up by the light of two candles
Stuck in beer bottles ; it was no easy job, but we managed it and in twelve days’
time the Dog was running about again.

11 pm. A greengrocer was returning home after collecting his supplies. His
Horse had taken fright and bolting down hill had crashed into a garage wmdow.
lts body was severely cut and one particularly nasty gash between its ears and
nose had to be stitched up immediately. We did this by the light ofa policeman’s
torch and a cyclist’s lamp.

.2.15 am. A call to go to a small cottage in the country, where a Dog. had
slipped over two steps and fractured its leg in three places. The owner said he
could not sleep because of the dog’s screams. We set the leg.

4 am. Went to a difficult whelping case.

_ 5.30 am. Called to an injured Mare on an arterial road, which had been run
Into by a car. The radiator of the car was buckled, the Mare receiving severe
Wounds. We were there with the Ambulance in twelve minutes. Brought the
, anlmal back to the Sanatorium.

7 am. Called to a colic case eleven miles away.

An average night’s work.

P.D.S.A. Dispensaries.

 

OPENING TIME_AT A DISPENSARY IN THE EAST END OF LONDON.

The following only gives a glimpse of hundreds of thousands of
cases treated at the Dispensaries :—

A “ Cure for Worms ”-—-Dog. Owner had twisted a piece of wire round
its tail a month previously to “ kill a worm ” he said. Tail was dropping off.
Tail amputated and owner instructed on the folly of his treatment.

A Dutch Barge. The Captain’s Dog had broken its leg. A telephone message
was sent to a Dispensary, the barge visited and the dog’s leg set. Each time
the barge arrived to discharge cargo a bulletin was telephoned to the P.D.S.A.
and several visits were made. The dog recovered to the delight of the entire

crew—consisting of the Captain, his wife, two children and two Dutch deck-
hands.

Worms again ! A Coster gave his Horse a dose for worms. To do 50.
he tied its head back to a beam and gave one pint of linseed oil and turpentine—
what percentage of turpentine he could not say. On returning a few hours
later he found the animal in such agony that he sent for the P.D.S.A. The medicine
had gone down the windpipe into the lungs instead of down the gullet into the
stomach. We spent most of the night with the Horse, but it died and a post
mortem showed the lungs practically burnt up by the turpentine. The man had
but recently bought the Horse for £20 and intended to pay by instalments. He
cried bitterly, knowing he was bankrupt.

Starvation. A Horse, whose owner made a livelihood for himself, .his
wife and five children by carting seamen’s “dunnage ” from ship to lodging
house and vice versa. Work was scarce in the docks, so there was little food

28

 

 

 

 

 

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

for"the Horse. Finally it refused to eat and became desperately thin. The owner
sent it to the P.D.S.A. explaining that he had no food for it and no money to pay
for treatment. Reassuring the man, the Assistant sent the Horse to its stable,
for it was suffering from a bad form of indigestion brought on by starvation and a
diet of packing straw. Then he arranged for its maintenance and removal to
Hospital.

The Kitten’s Bangle. A little child had put a “ bangle ” on its kitten’s paw.
The bangle was an elastic band and as the kitten had grown, the band had cut
through the flesh to the bone. Children often make abangle out of an elastic
or rubber band for their kitten’s paw.

Broken Knees. An Italian ice-cream man’s Pony fell down in the street.
The knees were badly broken. A P.D.S.A. Assistant gave first aid and made the
Pony comfortable until the ambulance arrived. The Pony was taken to the
Sanatorium and made a good recovery.

Gratitude. An old man brought his Dog to a Dispensary several times for
treatment. He put 1/- each time in the Voluntary Box. On making enquiries
the Assistant found that it cost him 1/1 in fares to come, and also that his only
subsistence was the Old Age Pension of 105. per week ! He was at once told not
to make any voluntary contribution, so on further visits he always brought a
small bunch of flowers or a few potatoes !

The Dog and the Wheel. While a P.D.S.A. Assistant was on his way to
visit a case, he was overtaken by a private car, the driver of which stopped him
and asked him to return to a garage a few hundred yards back. On arriving at
the garage, he found that the proprietor’s pet Retriever, being inquisitive about a
car wheel standing against the wall, had pushed its head through the spokes
and thus become jammed. In its fright, the Dog had become nearlyfrantic and
would allow no one to approach it. the P.D.S.A. Assistant, however, soon had
it under control and the application of a little grease together with gentle manipu-
lation liberated the prisoner.

 

A TYPICAL HAWKER’S STABLE.

29

 




 

 

WFirst Aid. A little boy brought a Dog, with a splint fastened round one
leg, and the rest of his body covered with bandages. “ I’ve seen you do this kind
of thing,” explained the boy, “ and wanted you to see if I’d done it right, in case
he gets hurt and I can’t find you !”

Practical Sympathy. A boy, who at work had lost the use of his arm, had
been unemployed for three years. During that time he saved enough to buy
a Pony and cart for starting a vegetable round. The first night he was the happy
possessor of the Pony, he omitted, through ignorance, to tie it securely in the
stable. The Pony wandered into another stable and was kicked by a Horse, the
kick breaking its leg. The P.D.S.A. visited it. When informed that the Pony
would have to be destroyed, the boy fainted. Through our efforts and the
kindness of the Press, the sad case was made known and a great animal-lover
most generously gave the boy another Pony—a healthy little animal we were
able to find for him.

Fellow Feeling. Two Donkeys—one for advice during foaling, the other
to have its teeth attended to. On arriving at the Dispensary for the second
visit, the Donkey whose teeth had been rasped held his companion firmly with
its teeth and tugged it away down the street. No one could separate them,
neither by coaxing or force, so they were allowed to go home, and the dental
patient could be treated without the sympathetic interference of his pal.

A Third Eyelid. Dog with a haw or “ third eyelid.”

An Iron Collar. Dog with an iron collar deeply embedded in the neck
having been put on when a puppy and forgotten.

A Septic Foot. Donkey, having trodden on a rusty nail had badly injured
its foot. Foot dressed and donkey sent by ambulance to the Sanatorium where
it was treated for one month. Meanwhile, its owner, an organ grinder had to
pull his organ along the streets. This was particularly difficult as the man had
only one leg.

Ulcerated Eye. Dog, neglected, ulcerated eyes, the ulceration in one
eye having eaten into the eyeball.

A Vicious Dog. “ My Dog has become quite vicious,” said an owner. “ He
screams if his jaw is touched." Dental trouble was suspected, but the trouble
was a piece of bone locked between the teeth, which, through constant rubbing
of the Dog, had been driven right through the cheek making a hole as large as a
sixpence.

Six months pain. Dog suffering from an abscess of the mouth for six months.
caused by a decayed tooth. Anaesthetic was given, the tooth extracted and the
wound treated.

A Sad Case. It was sad work destroying a Great Dane who had been given
as a companion and guard to a 4-year-old little girl who was blind, due to after
effects of measles. The child and the dog were inseparable companions. The
dog was very ill and past all recovery, after distemper.

Other frequent patients at the Dispensaries are :—

Parrots. Their trouble usually an overgrown beak, or canker;
Canaries with Asthma, or broken legs and claws.

Monkeys suffering from lung trouble, brought by Italian organ grinders.

The P.D.S.A. Midland Area.

.. The Midland Area consists of1 Hospital at Dunkirk, Notting-
ham, 4 Dispensaries, at 21 Carlton Road, Nottingham, 15, Bell
Street, Wolverhampton, 23, Hall Street, Bilston, and Anglesey,
Hednesford and 2 Caravan Dispensaries—1 working exclusively
in the Potteries—and 1 Small Animals Ambulance.

Patients are brought to the Hospital from all Midland Towns.
30,409 cases have been treated during the year at the Hospital
and Dispensary in Nottingham.

 

A SECTION OF THE SMALL ANIMALS’ WARD.

Many of the comfortable pens for the small animals, and spacious
stalls for Horse patients in the Hospital wards, have been presented
by animal lovers in the district. A recent gift of equipment took
the form of an ultra-violet ray lamp, which has proved of great
benefit to a number of suitable cases. An X-ray apparatus is now
greatly needed.

A selection of cases discharged during the past two weeks include :—-A Pony
which had been taken ill in the street with Colic. This Pony was the main support
of a disabled miner, who had sunk his compensation money in the purchase of
a Pony, cart and a stock of vegetables. As he said about his livelihood: “ It’s
better than being on the Dole, and that’s where I should be, if it was not for
your P.D.S.A. Chaps.”

31

 




 

 

An Old English Sheep Dog which was admitted with a tumour the size of a
small orange.

A small and very lovable Terrier which was expecting a litter of puppies.
Quite used to varying scenes, she soon made herself at home in the Hospital,
and when her family had arrived, and was settled' in the world, she was safely
returned to her mistress in a distant town.

Dog hurriedly brought to our Caravan at one of the outlying Stations, had
received a bad cut on the foreleg. An artery was severed, and the Dog was
bleeding profusely. The Assistant applied first aid, and temporarily checked the
bleeding. and telephoned to the HOSpital from a nearby call office. The ambulance
was sent out immediately, and when it arrived at the Caravan to pick up this
patient, a woman waiting for attention for her Cat was heard loudly to observe
“There's not another Ambulance, or yet a Fire Engine that could have come
more quickly.”

A case which illustrates the gratitude shown by the people who come with
their animals for attention, is that of an unemployed man whose Dog had been
treated at the Hospital for a serious fracture. When his dog was discharged, he
said to us. “ This dog is the only friend I’ve got, except the ‘ Missus.‘ I haven’t
any money ; but will you let me come and do a job of work to make up for
what you have done for old Bob .7 ”

During their time of convalescence most of our Monkey patients. and we have
many, find the Staff Mess Room more congenial than the Wards, as possible tit-
bits are more numerous in this-department. One day, while one Monkey, “ Bill’
was at liberty in the mess room, he chanced to spot the Superintendent leaving
his pipe on the'top of a cupboard, while he went off to see a case in another part
of the Hospital. Unfortunately. in his hurry, he had not quite extinguished the
pipe. On his return to the mess room, he found “ Bill ” perched on top of
the cupboard With the pipe firmly held in his hands, puffing vigorously. com-
pletely enveloped in a cloud of smoke. Cajoles and threats failed to make
“ Bill " relinquish his hold on his new found treasure, and the assistance of- his
pet nurse had to be obtained before the Superintendent could retain his pipe.

A Dispensary had closed for the day, and the assistant was about to go home,
when a furious banging at the door arrested his attention. The door was opened
to admit a little lad of about eleven years of age, carrying a forlorn looking Terrier,
nearly as big as himself. With tears welling up in his eyes, the boy placed the
Dog carefully on the table and explained that it had just been knocked over by a
motor car, and could not put his leg to the ground. On examination, the in-
juries proved to be a compound fracture of the foreleg, there being a break above
and below the wrist joint and large wound over the jomt. The injuries were so
serious that nothing could be done for the Dog, and it fell to the assistant the
hard task of telling the little chap that his dog would have to be painlessly put
to sleep. This was more than the lad could stand, and he burst into tears. saying
“ It was only yesterday I had to pay six shillings out of my savings to recover
him from the pound.” (The pound is a place under police control, where loSt
dogs are taken). “I was saving that money up for his licence next year, now
I shall have no dog, and I had, no money to pay for his licence.” The boy was

P.D.S.A. Caravans.

Our Caravans still continue the same work as started in 1922 with a one-
horse Gypsy Caravan. In the following year we had our first Motor Caravan
given us. This old veteran is now beyond work, having travelled 170,084 miles.
We have now 5 large Caravans and 3 smaller ones.

We have often stressed the enormous value of our Caravan Service, as it
travels and works in our cities, towns and villages throughout the length and
breadth of our land. Some “ distressed areas ” and districts are so congested,
and the people in so deplorable a state, that the sufferings of the animals must
be left to the imagination.

During the past year we have worked the South-west of England, the South
Coast, the greater part of the Midlands including the Potteries, and the
County of Essex which is visited twice a week. Many hundreds “of
thousands of animals have received treatment, and their owners instruction.

An out-of—work miner brought his nine-months-old Puppy, with the request “
that all the back teeth should be extracted. The teeth were perfect. On.
being asked why he wanted them extracted, he said, “ Why, Guv’nor, they’re
all poisonous,—-my pals told me so—and for 20 years I have always had my puppies’
teeth taken out ! ” He left a wiser man, promising to explain the error to his
pals.

A Retriever tossed by a cow—the Dog’s leg was broken. This was sent by g '-
ambulance to the P.D.S.A. Nottingham Hospital where it made an excellent
recovery.

A Cat with an eye hanging out and a fractured jaw, a brick having been thrown
at it. Destroyed. .

A Dog, just a bag of bones, suffering from distemper. Had been ill for six
weeks.

A Bitch that had had puppies fifteen weeks previously, but one Puppy remained.
The condition and suffering of the mather were so dreadful that she could not
even sit down.

A lame Horse brought by a Hawker. Tendons were inflamed through faulty ,
shoeing and rough roads.

. IAn Unemployed man brought his Dog saying it was going blind. The trouble
was two husks of wheat which were found to be embedded in the eyelid, causing
pain. These were removed and ointment and lotion applied. ,

And so the same tales can be told wherever a Caravan is working. The
following are two of the many instances of gratitude which cheer us on our way :

A Dog had been treated for canker of the ear, from which it had been suffering
for a year. Half-an-hour later, the Dog returned to the Caravan alone and
expressed a great liking for us. He was with us some time refusing to leave.
Later on, when his owner arrived, he said that when he missed his Dog, he thought
it might have come back to us as it was fond of people who were kind to him
and made a fuss of them.

A small boy, clasping a little Dog tightly in his arms, was awaiting the arrival
of the Caravan. He seemed to be extremely anxious. When the Caravan
arrived. his pet was treated, and the lad went away. On entering the garage
next morning to fetch the Caravan for its day’s work, the Staff were amazed to
find it washed, and the brass-work polished until it shone. The proprietor
' disclaimed all knowledge. The next morning, again the Caravan was cleaned
and polished. The night-man at the garage, who went off duty at 7 am. reported
that the washing and polishing had been done by a small boy. Enquiries revealed
his identity. He was the little boy who had been waiting for the Caravan with
his Dog!

We are extremely gratified to Mrs. .Plant and her friends, for their gift of a
Caravan for work in the Potteries and also to Miss Hughes and an anonymous
giver for gifts of a Caravan.

BRINGING THEIR ANIMALS

 




 

The P.D.S.A. Abroad.

Paris.
Dispensaries :
9. BIS RUE DE LA BUCHERlE.
16, RUE DE LA REPUBLIQUE, LES LILAS.
The P.D.S.A. in Paris is now a recognised feature in the City.
Our Superintendent and his senior assistant have been presented

with a Diploma of Honour, with Medal, by the Minister of Agri-
culture.

“ Mr. Reginald Horne, for his zealous and successful
administration of the Paris Dispensary for a period of

four years during which thousands of animals had been
treated.”

“ Mr. Amsden, for his devoted and unceasing work on
behalf of the animals at his Dispensary at Les Lilas.”

This honour was conferred upon ‘them at the Annual
Meeting of the French Association for Animal Defence. . Among
those present at the Meeting were Mons. Paul Strauss, Vice-
President of the Senate, Mons. R. Brandon, Deputy, Mons. M.
Ursat, Assistant Director of the Agricultural Service of the De-
partment of Seine et Oise.

 

A SERIOUS CASE.

36

 

 




 

 

 

 

 

“1H — ”—4. ——~.——--—»«.._;‘:_*__.* .1: "—37 r_«—w,; r‘-'V~~—.»—~

During this year 35,608 patients have received treatment at
the Dispensaries. Many ofthe animals are in the same deplorable
condition as in other countries. The same sad tale could be told.
Acute suffering often being the result of the owner’s amazingly
ignorant attempts to cure the animal himself. However, the
following case was not the owner’s fault :—

A large dog was brought in on the point of dying. The owner asked
for it to be destroyed, which was done. At the owner’s request, a post
mortem examination was made, and in the stomach was found 2 Ping
Pong balls, a piece of tape about 3 ft. long, and a mass of what appeared
to be grass. .

The River Seine runs near one Dispensary, and we are doing
all in our power to stop the throwing of animals into the river.
During the warm weather, the tramps of Paris collect there. One
day one of them was amusing himself by throwing a small Mongrel
Puppy into the river, and as it made its way out throwing it back
again. A gentleman happened to be passing at the time and
after watching the performance for a few minutes took the tramp
by the coat collar and pitched him in, picked up the puppy and
walked away. As the water is not very deep at this point, the
offender managed to drag himself out, but looked rather sorry
for himself.

We are very often asked to vaccinate Siamese Cats against
Leprosy, it being the mistaken idea that this disease can be con-
tracted from this particular breed of cat. We sometimes have
difficulty in making it understood that this is not so. The tip
of a Dog or Cat’s tail is often cut off to preserve it from having
worms or distemper. A string of corks is often put round a Cat’s
neck to prevent illness, and a layer of tar,'or cobbler’s wax on Dogs
heads to prevent distemper.

The following translation of an article which appeared recently
in Paris Midi gives some idea of the nature of our work :—

“ The People’s Dispensary for Sick Animals of the Poor ” has
become a truly Parisian work.

” Fripon ” is not a dog but a cat. He was very ill and his mistress was very
worried. She ekes out a very poor existence. That is why, one dark morning
recently, they both made their way, each carrying the other in a manner of speak-
ing, to “The People’s Dispensary for Sick Animals ofthe Poor,” or in good French,
“ Le Dispensaire Populaire pour les Animaux Malades.” We were curious
enough to follow them, with their permission. In the Notre Dame quarter,
any one will indicate to you the way to this Dispensary, where are alleviated
the sufferings of those who have not the gift of speech to explain the cause of
their pain. The habitues of this clinic for domestic animals volunteer informa-
tion very freely. We take, even as for a bus, a numbered ticket from the book
hanging at the entrance; we set down our little wicker basket amongst others
of all shapes and sizes. All the animal lovers in Paris seem to know the spot.

In spite of the plaintive miaows of the cats and the yelping of the little dogs,
which one hears on all sides, a great Spirit of cordiality prevails. Each owner
relates his little troubles to another. People of all classes, all nationalities,
animals with varied coats, birds of different feathers, fraternise whilst waiting
for their number to be called out, just as in the waiting room or vestibule of any
hospital. When we came out again—” Fripon ” and his mistress and ourselves
—completely re-assured as to the nature of the cat’s bobos (French baby-word

37

 




 

 

 

 

for any ache or pain), the last client to arrive was detaching a ticket bearing the
number 50. Our own number was 20. This proves that there is no lack of
work.

The work can only be carried on by virtue of kind donations ; that is to say,
by the aims and offerings of those who love ourinferior brothers. Everything
there is free; prescriptions, remedies, operations, even anaesthetics—for no
“ patient ” undergoes an operation without an anaesthetic.

“ As soon as we are able," said the Superintendent in charge, with a slight
Anglo-Saxon accent, “ we hope to be able to extend our activities to the pro-
vinces. There, also exist poor people—folk who are totally unable to pay for
expensive treatment, and who are forced to watch, helpless, the slow agony of
an animal which was once, perhaps, their best friend.”

The P.D.S.A. has cause to be very grateful to the French Associa-
tion of Animal Defence, and in particular to its President, Madame
H. Namur, and to its Hon. Secretary, Madame N. Mesureuru
These ladies have helped the P.D.S.A., in Paris in every possible
way, and have also undertaken to pay a large proportion of the
rent of one of the Dispensaries.

Tangier.
ONE HOSPITAL. ONE DISPENSARY.
AT WALLER’S FONDAC.

We have mentioned elsewhere our desire that the P.D.S.A.
should be a world-wide activity and that every nationality should
benefit by our teaching and work. An evening’s work at the
Tangier Dispensary recently seems to point that we are moving
in that direction. The following nationalities brought their
animals :—

A Spanish Woman tears streaming down her cheeks, had brought the
family bread-winner, a donkey, suffering from meningitis.

A Moor, bringing a donkey which had fallen into some corrosive acid.

A French woman with a duck with its neck twisted due to apoplexy.

An Italian with a cat whose eye was hanging out.

A German whose dog had a rabbit bone wedged in its food pipe.

A Swiss with a dog in an advanced state of fever.

A Czechoslovakian who had come direct from a fishing voyage with a dog
that had a fish bone in its nose.

A Portuguese with a dog suffering from a wasting disease.

An American whose dog was in an acute state of pneumonia.

An English lady, accompanied by a policeman, who said she had found a horse
working lame and walking on three legs, with its owner perched on top, could
anything be done 2 “ Could we do anything ” was promptly shown by putting
the horse in the stable, and the culprit left with the constable. So this endless
procession goes on day in and day out.

During the year 6,40l cases have been treated, including 279
animals painlessly destroyed and 280 kept in the hospital. In
addition to the work in the Hospital and Dispensary, Market
days—twice a week—are extremely busy days for the P.D.S.A.
Staff whose duty it is to inspect the thousands of Horses, Mules
and Donkeys which come long distances from the villages and are

38

 

 




 

 

left in the Fondaks. Saddles and burdahs are lifted, wounds
dressed, medicine and advice given and serious cases taken to the
Hospital.

A constant patrol of the streets is another activity of the P.D.S.A.
and numerous cases of cruelty have thus been investigated and the
offenders brought to the notice of the police or to the Sultan’s
representative.

Some cases treated :—

A Mule accompanied by two Arabs was brought to the dispensary in a pit‘eous
state with no fewer than ten deep-seated wounds and suffering from concussion.
One eye was closed up with a wound above, one hind-leg had a large wound
which exposed the bone, and others clearly seen on other parts of the body
were too numerous to mention. One in particular situated on the top of the
head was so deep that the bones of the skull were protruding. A course of treat-
ment had been given which consisted of dusting the wounds with a powder made
by grinding down stones picked up in the street. This method presumably dates
back to King Solomon’s time, and had done a terrible amount of harm. All
the surrounding skin and flesh had been destroyed. It took days to remove
every particle of powder which had sunk deep down into the flesh. The pain
that this poor beast suffered must have been indescribable.

A Spanish boy brought a Donkey which, with great difficulty he managed to
get to us suffering from a swollen and inflamed leg. So great was the pain that
this patient little beast collapsed upon the ground from sheer exhaustion. It
was left for a time to recover strength and then put into the Hospital and made
comfortable. I questioned the boy as to how this injury occurred and how long
it had suffered. But the answers were vague and misleading and l was asked to
believe that this condition had occurred only twelve hours previously and that
it may have been bitten by a snake. The condition of the leg was such that it
was twice the size of the opposite leg and after a few days treatment, pus poured
away leaving a wound into which I could get my closed hand with the bone ex-
posed. The Donkey must have been in this condition a considerable time.
But now all is changed. The wound is healing and the benefit of the rest in
Hospital from its laborious work of going from door to door with bread, has
improved its condition enormously.

. A very small Dog was brought to me by a French lady for treatment. It was a

sweet natured little dog and one that was a real family pet. The owner was crying
and greatly concerned about it and requested me to examine it. One fore-leg
was terribly swollen and after examination I found it was fractured. I enquired
the cause and was told that an Arab had beaten it with a broom.

A Donkey was brought to the dispensary suffering extensively frcm burns.
It was a horrifying sight to witness this poor animal shaking from shock, with its
skin minus hair and as hard as leather. All the legs and the under part of the
body were burnt.

The cause of the trouble was due to a Moor in an adjoining stable which re had
vacated, washing the floor with a corrosive acid. This acid, undiluted, had leaked
into the stable of the affected Donkey, got on to its legs and in its endavour to
relieve the pain, the animal had fal.en to the floor, only to be burnt in other
parts.

Realising that in a few days the whole of the burnt skin would peel off, leaving
exposed flesh, it was painlessly destroyed.

A Message from a Tourist :—

” During my recent stay in Tangier I visited the P.D.S.A. Dispensary. The
Work that is being done there is nothing less than amazing, especially in detecting
lame and sore donkeys. For instance, I visited the stable one morning and found
a bad sore under the saddle of a donkey. I could not find the owner so went
to the Dispensary to fetch the P.D.S.A. Assistant, who visits and inspects

39

 




 

 

 

 

Stables. When we arrived the donkey had disappeared. We looked all round.
and went into Other stables to try and trace it, but it could not be found. . I
left the matter in the hands of the P.D.S.A. The next day I called at the DIS-
pensary, and the P.D.S.A. Superintendent informed me that the donkey had
been found in a dark unused shed and had been brought to the Dispensary for

.treatment.

“ The P.D.S.A. seem to know every donkey and its history in the district.
It is amazing. I was told of several terrible donkey cases treated in the DIS-
pensary in the past months. One had been carrying sand until it fell down
exhausted. The driver had then thrashed it until it was almost dead. It was
bruised all over the body and had concussion ofthe brain. This donkey, I learned,
was immediately destroyed. Another appalling case was that of a donkey whose
straw bedding had caught fire. The poor creature was so badly burned under
the stomach and legs. and about the head,that it could not stand. The owner
left it with the P.D.S.A. on condition that it would not be destroyed, as he was
dependent on it for his livelihood. The donkey was nursed for 2g months, when
it was taken home to the Moor. fit and strong, but very much scarred.

“ These accounts left me still more strongly convinced of the value of the
work being done by the P.D.S.A. in North Africa. Now what I feel is very badly
needed in Tangier is 3 Caravan Dispensary to travel into the surrounding country,
as the suffering of the animals in these districts is often appalling, and by the
time the information has reached the Dispensary the animals are probably aban-
doned or dead.

“ Perhaps I may be allowed to appeal to animal lovers to make a little sacrifice
and try to provide this great need. I understand that the cost of a Caravan is
£500. Those of us who have followed the work of the P.D.S.A. in Roumania
and the East Indies will know the godsend the Caravans are in those countries.
Both Caravans were the generous gifts ofanimal lovers. They are doing a magnifi-
cent work, not only treating many thousands of cases, as they travel through out-
lying districts, but also in teaching the owners how to take better care oftheir
animals. They are welcomed wherever they go. Cannot we make a great
effort to provide an “ Ark of Mercy ” (as someone has aptly called a P.D.S.A.
Caravan) for the poor animals of North Africa ?

“ God bless the work ofthe P.D.S.A. and strengthen and encourage the workers
in their difficult work in Tangier for the suffering animals. May the day soon
come when Tangier will be known for its humane treatment of animals. When
that day comes it will be due to the P.D.S.A.”

The P.D.S.A. held its annual inspection of Donkeys and Coach
horses on the Marshan under the Patronage of HE the Mendoub
and the British Minister, Ernest Gye, Esq., C.M.G., which proved
an enormous SUCCESS.

Typical “treatment” given by owners of injured animals in
Tangier, will be found on page 47.

Our urgent need in Tangier is a Caravan Dispensary. Through
the great kindness of animal lovers we have Caravans working in
Roumania and Bali. They travel great distances, treating sick

animals which it would be impossible to reach otherwise.

In Tangier our work is greatly restricted by lack of a Caravan,
as we want to go and work and teach in the surrounding districts.

The cost of a Caravan Dispensary is £500.
We heartily thank all Supporters who have done and are doing

so much to help our work in Tangier, but we want to work
harder, by going further afield.

Rou mania.

1 HOSPITAL AND 1 DISPENSARY
AT STRADA’ CIOCAN, 15, PRIN CALEA; DUDESTI, BUCAREST.

1 HOSPITAL
AT MORENI, BUCAREST.

Under the gracious patronage of the King of Roumaniaw
who is our President—the work in this country is rapidly gaining
popularity and the confidence of the people of all classes.

Queen Marie of Roumania has also greatly encouraged us
in our arduous task by sending the following message to Mrs..
Dickin :—

To the Founder and Honorary Director of the
People’s Dispensary for Sick Animals of the
Poor (Incorporated), London :—

“ The efforts of yourself and your staff to alleviate
suffering amongst the Animals of the Poor in all
parts of the world are known to me and I watch
with sympathy and satisfaction the progress of the
work of the People’s Dispensary for Sick Animals of
the Poor in Rou‘mania.”

Another recognition which we greatly value was the Blessing
of the Dispensary at Moreni by a priest of the Roumanian
Greek Church. A representative assembly was present at the
ceremony : the Primar (Mayor) of Moreni ; the Prefect of Police
and other police officials in full uniform ; an officer of the Rou-
manian Army ; some of the richer residents of the town : and
a great crowd of the poor of Moreni, without shoes or stockings
to their feet.

The priest, a tall, black-bearded man in cassock and blue stole.
was attended by a lay reader. On a table before him, in the Dis-J
ensary yard, stood four tall, slender candles, a small bowl of
holy water, a bunch ofthe herb basil, a Crucifix, an ancient leather-g
bound, beautifully embossed book of prayers, and a number of
P.D.S.A. medals. The service began with readings from the Book
by the lay-man and the priest, after which all knelt in the dust,
many of the congregation joining with the priest in repeating a
prayer.

Then began the ritual of the Blessing. All stood. The four
tall candles were lighted, and the priest took up the bunch of
basil, dipped it in the holy water, and made the sign of the Cross
with it. Then he sprayed the water to the north, south, east and
west. Meanwhile the layman continued to read the service. A
procession formed, led by the priest, who went to each stable in
turn, carrying in one hand the Crucifix and bowl of holy water.
and in the other the bunch of herbs. With the latter he sprinkled?
each horse in turn, blessing it.

P.D.S.A. HOSPITAL IN BUCAREST.

  

Returning to the yard, the priest, holding the Cross in his left
hand, walked among the congregation, and then kissed the Crucifix
and the hand which held it. A prayer concluded the religious
ceremony.

Then, in the name of Mrs. Dickin, O.B.E., a P.D.S.A. Special
Representative presented the medals which had lain on the table
to those who had rendered valuable service to the Society in
l Roumania. The first to receive one was the priest who had per-
formed the Blessing. Though warned that the request would be l
.refused, the P.D.S.A. Official asked him if he might have the
candles and basil used in the ceremony to take to Mrs. Dickin,

who greatly appreciates this recognition ofthe work ofthe P.D.S.A. ‘
by the Roumanian Church. l;

The priest gladly gave them, and wrapped them himself with
great care, sending with them a blessing on the work of the
‘l P.D.S.A. as a whole, and on Mrs. Dickin, whose work he greatly
, admires.

The Primar, the Representative of the Army and other valued
friends of the P.D.S.A. in Roumania, were also decorated.

In conclusion, the company drank to the prosperity and develop-
ment of the P.D.S.A. in the national drink of Roumania which is
taken with bread and olives.

It is difficult to tell of the horrible suffering of the animals
which are brought to the Dispensaries andﬁCaravan. It is distressing
beyond words to even read about it, but to witness it, to be

surrounded by it, is still more harrowing—so a few typical cases
will suffice.

 

 

From our Superintendent’s Report :—

After a day’s work at the Head Dispensary on Saturday last, I
visited the following cases :—

6.l5 p.m.—telephone message—Horse down in the street. A large jar of
acid been broken over him, scalding him terribly.

7.35 p.m. Called to a Cow. Fallen down and could not rise. Found the
whole of the pelvis fractured. It had, according to the owner, been beaten with
some heavy instrument while out at grass. Destroyed.

9.30 p.m. Called to another Cow. Found cow completely paralysed. Died
within one hour. Embedded in the stomach was found a two inch nail. This,
and pieces of wire, are common causes of fatal illness among cattle here.

7 a.m. Sunday. A Horse had fallen down a nine foot trench ; found he had
fractured his spine and both legs. Destroyed.

Horse, with ghastly fistulous withers, working 14 hours a day over rough
ground. Had been crudely operated upon, having 59 inches of raw flesh.

Cow, whose tail had been chopped in two because it had strayed into a field.

A Horse, overworked and underfed. It was so miserably thin that even at
a distance it was possible to count its ribs. Owner had cut a quantity of flesh
from its hindquarters, believing that this would give new life to the animal.
The wound was festering, one eye was missing, and an ear was badly torn.

Horse gored by a bull, and then left to its own devices. In consequence the
injured leg was rotting.

A village boy had gone to a field to get his Pony. Before catching it, he took
hold of a foal, which with its mother also occupied the field. The mare resented
the boy’s action, and kicked out at him, so the lad flung at her a chopper which
he was carrying. It caught her in the abdomen, making a terrible gash. The
poor creature tore madly round the field, with the chopper still sticking into
her, and the intestines hanging out.

95l6 cases have received treatment during the last 12 months.

If we told ofthe awful suffering which the P.D.S.A. has witnessed
in Roumania, this page would not be read. It is frequent to
see Horses with horrible gaping wounds on the back, shoulders
and round the face ; some with eyes out where they have been
lashed with whips ; others struggling along on three legs, being
beaten unmercifully when they stopped—and other animals treated
in the same diabolical manner. But the bright side of our work
is that it is now becoming well-known and as distrust as to our
motive is now being overcome, a great aptitude to learn is shown.

We will continue to work as long as we have money to do so,
but at the present time Roumania is avery heavy burden financially.
We do not know how to meet the expenses for the coming year
and as we cannot work without money we can do no other than
to recall our Staff unless help is received.

"Our special need at the moment is £600 for aHorse Ambulance,
as so many Horses are found lying in the streets and_we have nothing
to remove them to Hospital. Whata Godsend an Ambulance
would be, only those who see the suffering of the Horses can
understand !

A ROUMANIAN HORSE WITH NEGLECTED HOOFS
18,000 HORSES TREATED IN 18 MONTHS.

East |ndies——Bali.

The dreadful condition of the pariah Dogs in Bali is shown by
the pictures we publish. They must not be taken as isolated
cases but as the average state of the dogs destroyed.

In addition to destroying many hundreds of thousands of these
poor wretched animals, we have treated nearly 10,000 animals,
chiefly dogs, but also horses, cows, pigs, water-buffaloe,
goats, cats, etc. We have used nearly 21,000 rounds of Am-
munition, gallons of chloroform, and scores of pounds of
Mange dressing, Iodine, Cotton-wool, etc. '

Reports from Bali make it evident that the work of the P.D.S.A.
is becoming firmly established in that island, and is gaining a steady
hold on the affections of the Balinese. One of the most significant
signs showing the increasing appreciation of the P.D.S.A. Service
is that the mountain people now lie in wait for the Caravan
Dispensary, having been so impressed with the results of
previous visits. A month’s work includes travelling with the
van from 400 to 500 miles as well as the Ordinary itinerary.
Between 40 and 50 villages are visited. We are not destroying
so many dogs now, but cases are being brought for treatment,
more than 500 cases being treated in the villages in 3 weeks.

From the Superintendent’s report, Horse cases include the
following :~~

A Horse in a village had a small sore on his shoulder. The owner threw
the horse and with his big curved wood-cutter’s knife cut away a huge piece of

the flesh, filled it up with dirt, and washed the horse in the river that had already
collected the filth of many villages. lts condition was so bad that I had twice to
put the animal under chloroform and operate, and the horse recovered. Six
months later I was called in again to this horse, and found the poor chap standing
on three legs. The near hind was broken and the flesh gangrened ; the muscles
on the inner side of the off hind leg had rotted and dropped away, exposing
the thigh bone ; there were two big holes in the abdomen and pus was exuding
from all parts of the body. The flies no doubt helped with the infection for
the animal had been standing in that condition for five and a half weeks. \v’Ve
all remember that slogan “ With their eyes they plead— ” ; I shall never for-
get how that horse’s eyes pleaded as I walked in the Kampong and shot him.
Now the owner has two ponies, the best cared for in the district. A cough,
a fall, or a scratch brings him hot-foot to the P.D.S.A.

A Pony with a sore on the neck due to a rope round the neck being studded
with nails pointing inwards, to prevent it running away.

A young Horse with long neglected foot wounds. It could not walk. The
treatment was long, but successful, and we became very good friends. I always
left his dressing till the last each day, for it was so refreshing to hear that cheerful
whinny of greeting after a full day. He developed a habit of lifting his foreleg
to me and whinnying at the same time, and I heard' sometime afterwards that
the owner always gave him plenty of food because he (the owner) thought the
horse told me what had happened each day. It is certainly a fact that the man
asked my interpreter if I could understand the language of the horses.

The P.D.S.A. through its Superintendent, was recently honoured
in being given a special interview by the Governor General
of the Dutch East Indies and Mrs. de long, on the occasion
of their visit to Bali. Their Excellencies expressed pleasure at
the sight of the Caravan Dispensary, and their gratification with
the work of the P.D.S.A. ‘

Our work in Bali has, of course, only been possible at a very
great cost. This cost might have been far greater, may indeed,
have been too much to have allowed the work to continue, but

Her Excellency, however, obtained for us an exemption for
payment of motor-car tax, and a clearance of the bill for over
twenty thousand cartridges—two of the biggest items of expendi-
ture. Also we have now in course of preparation some thousands
of leaflets, printed by the Government stationery department of
Batavia, to assist the educational side of the work.

Through the great generosity of an animal lover, who made it
possible for the P.D.S.A. to go to the aid of the Dogs in Bali
and provided a Caravan for that purpose, not only has a great
work of mercy at last reached these poor wretched animals, but
also it is impossible to estimate the permanent benefit to the
Balinese themselves in educating them and opening their eyes
to the proper treatment of animals. And not only Balinese,
but Japanese, the Malays, the Chinese and other nationalities
to be found in Bali. But there still remains a tremendous work,
to be done, not only in Bali but the whole of the East Indies.
We need money to continue the present work and to train a few
Balinese to carry it on to set us free to establish the P.D.S.A.
in other islands.

As in other foreign countries, the response of the people, after
their trust has been gained, has been amazing. They walk many
miles to find us and in many cases are quick in following instruc-
tions.

The, P.D.S.A. is truly a missionary work, resulting in a change
of heart towards the animals and therefore of permanent value.

CONCLUSION.

We ask that it may be remembered that the suffering described
in these pages gives only a hint of the misery which exists : only
a glimpse into the world of animal misery. We ourselves.
we horrible suffering and agony about which we dare not even
write and at present the P.D.S.A. is working only in a very small
part of the world.

Is it any wonder that we are striving to shed the light of the
P.D.S.A. into every corner of the world, for “the dark places
of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty ? ” - ‘

We must labour for the animal that staggers along its blood-
stained path, the animal that suffers alone, often with only neglect,
hunger, burning thirst or intense cold and maddening pain for its
companion. To know how much they suffer, one has only to
see the speechless gratitude in their eyes when you try to help
them—that look is enough to express the depth of their pain.

 

May I add a personal note to all our Supporters 2

I want to say how impossible it is to try and thank you adequately
for making it possible for the P.D.S.A. to do its work. We are

honoured by your trust in us, and I think we spend your money
as you would have it spent. How we wish we could do without
money ! If we could, it would not be long before the Map on the
front page of this book was covered with tne names of the places
upon which the light from the P.D.S.A. Lantern shone.

But unfortunately, the work stands or falls in proportion to
the money we receive. We are entirely dependent upon those
whose hearts ache for the animals as do ours. lf money ceases to
come in, the P.D.S.A. must cease.

Your past generosity and sympathy make it very difficult to
ask you to continue your support. But it is our bread. With-
out it, Dispenssries must be closed, Caravans and Ambulances
remain idle, and Staff reduced at home and recalled from abroad—-
and so, what can I do, but ask you still to help us ? And if you would
send the name and address of any other animal lover to whom we
might send a copy of this book, we should be still further in your

debt.
