Dr. Wilber also states, “I make
a suggestion to your Institute that
you devise some sort of a manual
or handbook for high school teach-
ers of science. Such. a manual
would contain advice, suggestions
and references for biological ma-
terial which could be used in sci—
ence projects and fairs. I am quite
sure that you will find many p-ro~
fessional scientists in the biolog-
ical field Who share my views with
me. If such a book were distribut-
ed widely. . . it would do much to
'overcome the pernicious practice
of permitting high school students
to engage in unwarranted pain
causing procedures on warm—
blooded animals. Dr. Wilber also
writes:

“Again may I encourage you to
do all in your power to publicize
the undesirability of having high

school students do this type of ex-
periments. I emphasize, however,
that this does not mean I oppose
even the most drastic experiments

professional scientists who are in-
vestigating new biological path-
ways. In this case, the profession-

new knowledge.

traste principles which are well
known to me is incomprehensi
ble and unjustified.”

Citizens who do not want thei '
tax dollars going to pay for ani—
mal experiments by high school
youths which may not only be
cruel to the animals but degrad-
ing and demoralizing to the stu-
dents should write the following or
a similar letter to:

U. S. Department of Health,
Education, and Welfare, Di.-
vision of Research Grants,

Gentlemen:

I I do not want my tax dollars to be
used for animal experimentation
by high school students as I con-
sider it entirely unjustified and
not only cruel, but harmful and
degrading to the students.”

address and write TODAY.

NEW YORK-Slaughter without
fear or pain for most of the 115
million food animals expected to be
butchered in U. S. packinghouses.
this year is ensured by a new fed~
eral humane slaughter law which
became effective July 1. It requires
1 all packers whosell to the govern-
ment to render hogs, sheep, and
cattle insensible before they are
killed. '

One method, carbon dioxide im-
mobilization, is so gentle that a
hog that had passed through the
system but purposelyhad not been
killed, did not resist repeating the ‘
’trip soon after regaining conscious~
ness. Other methods approved by
the law are electric shock and me-
chanical concussion. Animals are

 

held up in a- restraining pen while ‘ '

the electric probe or mechanical
instrument is applied to their heads.

Cardox Division of Chei‘ﬁetron
Corporation, which supplies carbon '
dioxide to the packers, said im-
mobilization keeps hogs uncon- ‘
.scious for about four minutes,
twice the time needed for slaugh-
tering. The heavier-than~air gas
gathers at the bottom of a tunnel
which is depressed in the center. ;
Animals walk into the tunnel and
emerge unconscious on a conveyOr.
‘ belt. , .

Carbon dioxide and electric and
mechanical stunning methods are
humane, painless, and quick.

A hilmane society that backed
the law, the Animal Welfare In-
stitute, says. injuries to workers
and bedlam in the plants will be re-
duced because killing-ﬂoor em-
ployees no longer will be in con-
stant contact with animals ﬁghting
for their lives. 1

Animal Welfare
The Animal ‘Welfare Institute is a new,
nonfproﬁt, membership organization whose
primary function will be factﬁnding and
information-dispersing regarding the con—
troversial question of the use of animals
for research in laboratories. The Insti—
tute will seek to prevent suffering to ani-
mals in the laboratory phase of medical
research, and will endeavor to promote
the welfare of all animals. Its President
is Christine Stevens, of Ann Arbor, Michi-
gan.

Mrs. Stevens has been active in humane
programs in her home state, and currently
is Chairman of the Shelter Committee of
the Humane Society of Washtenaw Coun—
ty at Ann Arbor, which operates a new
$100,000 Animal Shelter there. Accord-
ing to Mrs. Stevens, the Animal Welfare
Institute will “seek to function with a
solid background of fact as a clearing
house for information on animal welfare,
especially the use of animals in labora-
tories,” and that while the Institute is in-
terested in every phase of animal welfare, '
it will at present concern itself primarily
with humane safeguards in the use of ani-
mals ’fOr research and medicine.”

Executive and information offices of the
Institute have been, established at 730

We read in the paper recently
where Sir Edmund Hillary, con-
queror of Mt. Everest, was visit-
ing New York and hadymade an
ascent on the formidable Empire

State Building. It suddenly oc-
curred to us that if Sir Edmund
could climb the Empire State
Building so could “we. Why do
men want to climb buildings?
No one can really say. Perhaps
the great danger att1 acts them-—
the terrible uncertainty about
what is waiting for them .at the
next floor, the unquenched de-
sire to attempt the possibletfor
. its own sake, the comradeship
and the sense of achievement
. that comes from doing some-
‘ thing the easy way. Perhaps that
is why men climb buildings. Once
you ’ve 1eached the top of a
‘ building you’ll never want to live
. on the ground floor again.
‘ And so it was with us. The
Empire .State Building is a for-
‘ bidding monument of rock and
. granite, its bold bare face sta1 mg
out over a sea of leSser and uglier
buildings and only partly air-
conditioned.

it quite easily. But as we got
off we ran into our ﬁrst difﬁ-
culty. There was a sign in the
hall “Use Night Elevators After
7 p. m. and on Saturdaysand
Sundays.” Suppose, ”we thought
to ourselves shuddering, we
didn’t get down by 7 p. m'. . .
but we didn’t think about it

long.

app: .1

Since. we were making such
good time we decided to keep
going as long as we could. We
took the elevator to the twenty-
seventh ﬂoor and made our sec-
ond camp. It was right in front
of the Arlene Dahl Lingerie and
Nightgown Co. and although we
intended to camp there for three
days Scott urged us to go on. V7 e
passed up the thirty-thud floor
where the Iron and Steel - In-
stitute was for a much better
camping site on the thirty-ﬁfth
ﬂoor. where the Schenley Whisky
Co. maintains its ofﬁces. It was
a smart decision as it gave. us

a chance to refurbish our sup-

plies. By this time we were both
b1 eathing pretty heavily and
our loyal Sherpa porter Sug-
gested we stop at the J antzen
Bathing Suit ofﬁce on the ﬁfty-
ﬁrst ﬂ00r and catch our breath.
We stayed there for several m1

little fellow, insisted we keep

gen masks and started up again.
Up past the First National Bank

of Boston, up past the Brook-
haven Atomic Bomb Project,
higher than I. Miller Shoes and
the Innocenti Italian Motor
Scooter Co.

But we didn’t dare stop. At the
eightieth ﬂoor we zoomed past
the New: York Knickerbocker
Basketball team and at the
eighty-second ﬂoor \the Animal

we were on the eighty-sixth

a sense of power, a sense of ex-
hilaration, a sense of loneliness.
Only ﬁfteen million people had‘
visited the eighty-sixth ﬂoor be»
fore us. For the ﬁrst time in our'
lives we were alone. But we‘
hadn’t gotten to the top yet. . It“
was now 11:15. We scrambled
on the elevator, aVOiding two:
severe looking cornices, and roSe
slowly and carefully to the 102d
ﬂoor. Our faculties started .to
get numb.

From here on we had to climb. .
Scott belayed us and we belayed
Scott. We climbed past a door
marked “For Employees Only,”
then up a ladder with a sign
“Protected by the Wm. J. Burns
Agency ” and still up past “No
Smoking” Warnings, until at last
we opened a‘trap door and stood
on the 105th floor. We had
reached the summit. As we .‘both
hung onto the WJ Z television
aerials we embraced each other.
_The moment that the whole
world Waited» for- was upon:
us. We tied a United Nations
ﬂag to an NBC TV aerial and an
American ﬂag to a CBSpipe line,
and then, after taking photo-
graphs as- the cruel wind beat
around our faces, we made the
di ﬁicult descent by an express
elevator straight down to the
ground.

In years to come there will be
arguments and debates as to
who got to the top of the Em-
pire State Building first. Scott,
our Sherpa porter, will claim he
did, but the truth is we got there

The Conquest of Empire State

We read in. the paper recently
where Sir Edmund Hillary, con-
queror of Mt. Everest, was visit-
ing New York and had made an
ascent on the formidable Empire

State Building. It suddenly oc—
curred to us that if Sir Edmund
could climb the Empire State
Building so could we. Why do
men want to climb buildings?
No one can really say. Perhaps
the great danger attracts them—«—
the terrible uncertainty about
what is waiting for them at the
next floor, the unquenched de-
sire to attempt the possible for
its own sake, the comradeship
and the sense of achievement
that comes from doing some-

thing the easy way. Perhaps that.

is why men climb buildings. Once
you’ve reached the top of a
building you’ll never want to live
on the ground ﬂoor again.

And so it was with us. The
Empire State Building is a for-
bidding monument of rock and
granite, its bold bare face staring
‘ out over a sea of lesser and uglier
buildings and only partly air-
conditioned.

u y t It

Since we knew the problem
would not be easy we hired a
Sherpa porter named Jay Tenz-
ing Scott from the Ben Sonnen-
berg Public Relations Ofﬁce. The
Sonnenberg office. has the Em-
pire State for an account and
their porters know it better than
anybody else.

Scott advised us that we had
to prepare for the trip. For-
tunately we could purchase sup-
plies on the ground floor. We
bought food from Longchamps,
Chlorophyll toothpaste from the
Walgreen drugstore, and. money
from the Manufacturers Trust
Co. On Feb. 5 at exactly 10:16
a. m. we started to make the
ascent. Scott advised us to do
it by stages so the ﬁrst thing
we did was take the local ele-
vator to the sixth ﬂoor, and
set up our ﬁrst camp. We were
both very fresh and we made

bl.

 

it quite easily. But as we got
off we ran into our ﬁrst difﬁ-
culty. There was a Sign in the
hall “Use Night Elevators After
7 p. m. and on Saturdays and
Sundays.” Suppose, we thought
to ourselves shuddering, we
didn’t get down by 7 p. m. . .
but we didn’t think about it

long.

0 C 0

Since we were making such
good time we decided to keep
going as long as we 'could. We
took the elevator to the twenty-
seventh ﬂoor and made our sec-
ond camp. It was right in front
of the Arlene Dahl Lingerie and
Nightgown Co. and although we
intended to camp there for three
days Scott urged us to go on. We
passed up the thirty-third floor
where the IrOn and Steel In-
stitute was for a much better
camping site on the thirty-ﬁfth
ﬂoor where the Schenley Whisky
Co. maintains its ofﬁces. It was
a smart decision as it gave us
a chance to refurbish our sup-
plies. By this time we were both
breathing pretty heavily and
our loyal Sherpa porter sug—
gested we stop at the Jantzen
Bathing Suit ofﬁce on the ﬁfty-
ﬁrst floor and catch our breath.
We stayed there for several min—
utes catching our breath and
losing it again. Scott, the plucky
little fellow, insisted we keep
going up. We both put on oxy-
gen masks and started up again.
Up past the First National Bank
of Boston, up past the Brook-
haven Atomic Bomb Project,
higher than I. Miller Shoes and
the Innocenti Italian Motor
Scooter Co.

But we didn’t dare stop. At the
eightieth ﬁoor we zoomed past
the New York Knickerbocker
Basketball team and at the
eighty-second floor the Animal
Welfare Institute and finally
past the WOR TV studio on the
eighty-third. Before we knew it
we were on the eighty-sixth
ﬂoor where we set up the last
camp before trying to reach the

summit. It was primitive but
satisfactory. There a snack bar,
a ladies’ and men's washroom, a
water fountain, phone booths
and recording studio where you
could make records and send
them to friends in other parts

- of the world. We started to feel

a sense of power, a sense of ex-
hilaration, a sense of loneliness.
Only ﬁfteen million people had
visited the, eighty-sixth floor be-
fore us. For the ﬁrst time in our
lives we were alone. But we
hadn’t gotten to the top yet. It
was now 11:15. We scrambled
on the elevator, avoiding .two
severe looking cornices, and rose
slowly and carefully to the 102d
ﬂoor. Our faculties started to
get numb. ’

From here on we had to climb.
Scott belayed us and we belayed
Scott. We climbed past a door
marked “For Employees Only,”
then up a ladder with a sign
“Protected by the Wm. J. Burns
Agency,” and still up past “No
Smoking” warnings, until at last
we opened a trap door and stood
on the 105th ﬂoor. We had
reached the summit. As we both
hung onto the WJZ television
aerials we embraced each other.
The moment that the whole
world had waited for was upon
us. We tied a United Nations
flag to an NBC TV aerial and an
American flag to a CBS pipe line,
and then, after taking photo-
graphs as the cruel wind beat
around our faces, we made the
difﬁcult descent by an express
elevator straight down to the
ground.

In years to come there will be
arguments and debates as to
who got to the top of the Em-
pire State Building first. Scott,
our Sherpa porter, will claim he
did,‘but the truth is we got there

By TOM WALLACE

THE ANIMAL WELFARE INSTITUTE, which
has headquarters at 22 East 17th Stree,t
New Y01k, acknowledges a debt of grati—
tudeto Dr. Perez-Alvarez, of the Instituto
. N acional dc Cardiologa of «Mexico City, for
an article in “Surgery,” a United States
publication, upon the care handling and
housing of dogs used tor experimentatiOn
in the inte1 est of advancement of learning
which may be helpful to human beings.

.A gene1ation ago nearly everyone was
for or against vivisection. Some admirable
publications, among them “Life,” a frolic.

" some weekly which had a nation-ally‘known, .

respected and beloved editorial page (Ed-
ward Sanford Martin, editor), steadfastly
‘- opposed experiments upon living animals.
Nowadays, so far as this writer knows,
no nationally respected publication is un-
cﬂhonally opposed to experiments Upon
a l I do not hear nowadays of many
1n°dividﬁals who go the length of saying no
living animal should be used experiment-
; ally,'but everyone who is interested broadly
in animal welfare holds, that utmost pains
should be taken to avoid subjecting any
. animal to any“ pain, unhappiness or incon-
venience which c0u1d be avoided. -

l A new federal McLaugh-
tei; law won’t guarantee painless
deaths for doomed meat animals
in ‘ Tulsa. County, but one big
packer believes a similar law—
on state level—is inevitable.

. “I think, we eventually will
come to it,” said R. E. Brooks,
president 0 Brooks Packing 'Co.
of Sand Spr° gs. «

The new US. law, effective
ug. 30 will not affect procedures
391.9", because it applies only to

 

   
  

 

"1) 33"; ..\

packing houses which sell to the
federal government.

“I know of no packing house
in Tulsa County which will be
affected by the new law,” said
Dr. A. F. Ezzell, chief of the
c oun ty meat inspection pro-
gram. '

How do cattle and hogs meet
death before being converted to
Steaks, roasts, chops and hams
in Tulsa County packing houses?

One packing plant uses a “kills

 

 

 

‘

‘Lilace,

 

 

 

driven into a pen, where one
hind leg is shackled to a con-

aW Discussed

ing hammer.” Cattle and calves
are driven into stunning pens:

where a “knocker” stands on a 1‘
platform and knocks them un-f
conscious with a hammer blow,

Although some people say cat-j
tle sometimes regain conscious-l
ness while being bled to death]
at the “bleeding rail,” packers—l
and. Dr. EzzelL—said this rarelyf
happens. '

“If the hammer is wielded by
a really proficient man,” a pack-
er said, “there’s little chance for
error.” i
Another packing house uses j
a riﬂe to kill cattle.

Hogs at one packing house are

veyor belt. Then, they’re hoisted
up to a place where a man cuts,

ror""“’sti’cks” their throats.

At other plants, hogs are
k n o c k e d unconscious before
“sticking.” ‘

What do the new federal regu-
lations provide? In brief, they

say animals must be humanely"

immobilized before slaughter.

There are three approved meth-
ods—knocking out by carbon di-
oxide, electrical shock or me-
chanical concussion.

Suppliers of carbon dioxide
claim this system keeps hogs
unconscious for about four min-
utes—twice the time needed for
slaughtering.

‘ The heavier-than-air gas gath-
ers at the bottom of a tunnel
which is depressed in, the center.
Animals walk into the tunnel and
emerge, unconscious, on a con-
veyor belt. , ' .
Packers questioned about the,
new law Were opposed to the
electrical shock method. ,
Commiented one plant official:
.“", packing plant is a . mighty
and the electrical

 

 

 

 

method is dangerous and might
take a human life.”

The new law is backed by the
Animal Welfare League, headed
by Mrs. Christine Stevens as
president. ‘

“ . . . Animals,” she‘said “will
be spared many of the horrors
of the packing house.”

Another backer of the law was

the Society for Animal Protective
Legislation.

There seems to be some dis-
pute about the meaning of
“humane”—as the word applies
to animals. One packer ex:
pressed belief that hogs, for
instance, just aren’t bothered
too much by pain.

Commented another: “Some of
these new methods aren’t work-
ing so well as methods now in
use.” \

Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey,

“Yes, most of

is a degree of
loneliness i n
everyone which
is f o r g o t t e n
among animals
and particularly
with dogs. Dog's.
more than other
animals, show
their under-
standing , a n d
appreciation. That’s why people
go out of their way to be con-
, siderate of them.”
Emily Cobb, E. 78th St., ac-
tress: “Among
dog lovers, yes,

New York City,
where there
would be more
loneliness if the

DEAR FOLKS:

.. It is good to hear of an incumbent presi—
dent of the United States and an ex-presi-
dent of the Opposite party jointly warning
the country’s senators and representatives
that, regardless of political aﬁ‘lliations, they
must pull together to form and implement
a wise foreign policy. Mr. Truman may be a
dyed-in-the-wool Democrat, but he is letting

his Party know that he is ﬁrst a red, white

and blue American. -

‘ NOT SO MANY BABIES! If the Popu—
lation Reference Bureau, Inc. (not connected
with the Government) ﬁgured correctly,

~ Amercia’s new‘babies are, not ﬁlling their

usually high immigration quota. The dc-

, termined‘ small-fry began rushing in in un-

usual numbers right after 1945, but by late

WISDOM MUST REPLACE PRIDE. It
is difﬁcult to know what is the right decision
about those troublesome bits of land, Quemoy
and Matsu, located so few miles off the cost
of the China mainland. The two islands can-
not be too valuable to the Nationalist Chinese
on Formosa a hundred or so miles away, cer-
tainly not valuable enough to involve their
best friends, A ericans, in a holocaust which
might destroy ' he world. Many Americans
are for ﬁghting to keep the two islands, if
only as a matter of pride in the thought that
we Americans keep our promises. It seems
that we did promiSe Nationalist China that
we would assist in the event that the little
islands were attacked, an unwise promise to
begin with, and one wonders how it came to
be made. It is understandable that larger
Formosa itself must be defended according
to promise, and because it is a strategic out—
post in the event — Heaven forbid! — of war
between East and West. It would seem that
American lives should not be sacriﬁced to the
territorial ambitions of any country. Some

promises, when found to be unwise, must be .

replaced with wise decisions.

ARE ‘THE SERVICES” MAD! Being
an Army man, President Eisenhower must
know what he is about when he allows his
new science adviser, James R. Killian, Jr., to
shake the concrete walls of the Pentagon. Mr.
Killian advised that the Pentagon surrender
its space exploration and ﬁndings to a new
civilian organization known as the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration. NASA
in short. The military Big Brass feel that
it is rather a tarnishing idea.

EPIDEMIC OF BOMBINGS. While we,
as a democracy, cannot and would not do with-
out a free press, a free press does have its dis-
advantages in civil life as well as in political
circles. At a small social gathering of un—
usually intelligent VIPs in the Capital the
bombings of churches, synagogues, and
schools, was being discussed. A seasoned
newspaper woman was of the Opinion that,
while some of the more expert bombings may
havebeen planned by a widespread group,
other bombings were subsequently done by
unimportant or criminally inclued individuals
who had no such idea until they read the
ﬁrst bombing headlines. Said the newspaper
woman, “Headlines are catching, whether
they be constructive or destructive. I believe
that if, for a month, all crime news could be
suppressed, or even reported. quietly rather
than dramatically, the drop in the crime rate
would startle even J. Edgar Hoover.” Well,
the magniﬁciently edited Christian Science
Monitor thrives mightily without sensational
reporting. Perhaps our newspaper editors can
do a better job at reducing crime than can
our overworked police departments. It’s
worth trying. Editors of “yellow” headlines
take note. - .

HUMANE SENATOR HONORED. It is

"the best of news to hear that Senator Hubert

H. Humphrey has been awarded the yearly
Albert Schweitzer Medal, given by the Ani-
mal Welfare Institute, for his wonderful ﬁght
in passing the bill for more humane slaught-
ering of meat-bearing animals. While the bill
was not perfect, Senator Humphrey did his

—best, and there is hOpe -- if we continue to

remind Washington --— that conditions“ will
be still further improved. It would be inter-
esting to know more about this annual medal,
named for the great humanitarian and out-
standing champion of all animal life. The
Animal Welfare Institute, a national organ-
ization, has headquarters at 22’ East 17th
street, New York City.

MORE BOOKS FOR MORE PEOPLE.
President Eisenhower is so accustomed to re-

that he must have been jubilant when Con-

he named for establishing new rural libraries
and enlarging others. Usually allotted a $3
million budget, the amount for rural libraries“ ‘
and books will be upped to $6 million! The“ ‘

Dear Journal:

We note that little Laika, is
now declared dead in her cap-
sule coffin in Sputnik No. 2.
There has been some discussion
of the effect on , Laika of the
“tumbling” of the satellite. Our
American seientists could have
foretold that this tumbling
would be fatal to Laika if con-
tinued because it has been prov—
en by them over a period of
years. In this conntry small
animals, cats, kittens, and rab-
bits have been placed in con-
stantly revolving drums driven

by motors, in “fatigue” tests. ~

After trying to keep up with
their moving “floor” they have
ﬁnally tumbled about and died
of nervous collapse or fatigue.
Cats hate been known to stay
alive as long as four or five
days in such a test.

What value this experiment
has to the thuman race is a
question and it is more of a
question why, having been per-
formed once, it should ever be
necessary to perform it again.
This is only one of many callous
and uncessary experiments
which may be repeated numer-

ous times depending upon the
whim of an experimenter.

One can recognize the benefits
of animal experimentation and
still protest vehementaly against
needless cruelty meted out to
these sacrificial animals. But
there is something sacro‘sanct
abOut the medical. profession
which seemito tie men’s tongues
when they would rebel against
known waste and mistreatment
of animals in laboratories. Even
humane minded scientists find
themselves stymied in trying to
correct these conditions and

' 'nly influence the situation by.

oratories. = '
However, Coronet Magazine

courageously has published an

MINOR! REl’ORT

 

By ROBERT C. RUARK

There is no telling how many
million dogs will go down to the
grave bearing the, name of
“Sput” or “Nick” instead of
“Spot” or “Sport,” which were
current when I was a lad. But
it literally took one small ani-

. mal to arouse
the world to a
common sensi-
tivity to what’s
going on.

ter what its name was, than
when the Russians were slaugh-
tering the Hungarians in bunches
just the other day.

It ' is the same principle, I
suppose, that goes with cats up
trees, little boys down in wells,
or any well pin-pointed personal
tragedy. The Americans and the

A Puppy Becomes

British, _I suspect, are the worst
about this.
t o o

The fact is ignored that hun-
dreds of thousands of dogs are
put to death in pounds or are
sold to research laboratories.
You don’t often hear about this,
and so it is ignored. Atomic
energy and guided missiles get
hashed o‘ver so often as. to “be-
come a bore. Military appropria-
tions and slashes in same arouse
widespread disinterest and even
the influence of new wars gets
lost in world series and cricket
matches.

But hang up one puppy in the
outer sky as a new constella-
tion, and all of a sudden hu-
manity associates itself with a
science which is explicable only
to a few. Nearly everybody has
had, or seen, a puppy. Very few
people know how to crack an
atom, or understand enough
physics. to be better than bored
with the whole topic-

But a puppy is something
tangible. A puppy chews your
slippers and wets the rug and
throws up and barks and romps.

QUESTION: I have been going steady with a girl who

thinks I am obligated to her.

Does going steady mean that I

must continue to be exclusive in my contacts with other girls?

L.M.

ANSWER: That is entirely a matter of honesty and mutual

understanding. As long as you

and as long as your conduct has not implied

any serious intention, it does not seem that
you are obligated. It is a matter of Christian
principle that we be honest in all of our re-
lations. The problem is, have you at any time
implied that you were serious? If you have,
it is better to have a clear understanding and
dissolve your close friendship. It would be a
kindness to both of you to have such an un-
derstanding now and not’become more deeply

A Martyr ,

A puppy, in effect, is humanity
—-an imperfect creation caught
up in the lonely cosmos.

A machine arouses no sym-
pathy, and generally very little
interest in the average human
breast, any more than you
grieve about an uprooted carrot
or a tree sawed into lengths for
fireWood. But a dog trapped into
man’s devilish scientific machi-
nations—ah, that is another
matter.

It 1: o

The lost dog howls or whimp-
ers, and sometimes scratches at
strange doors. A waif is nearly
alWays appealing, and the de-
scription, ““Stray Dog,” is oft-
en applied to lonely humans.
And so the idea of a lonely
pooch, lost and whirling in the
skies, bereft of a door to
to scratch on, with no fire to
snore in front of, no hand, to
lick or to pat his head, no
fleas to scratch -—- unable even
to bay the moon —— suddenly
fetched us up to an awe-filled
realization of what the boys in
the laboratory have been up to.

It is the same way with peo-
ple. Millions of people have
been put to the torch, cruelly
k i 1 l e d, tortured, massacred,
bootlessly murdered in wars and
tiny fights they did not under-
stand. History ignores them,
largely. Crime is bad, but it
needs Albert Anastasia to make
you realize it.

A maid of Orleans on a pyre;
a John the Baptist with 1118
head on a salver; a Christ on
a cross—they all become sym-
bols of man’s incredible stu-

idit in dealing with man. .
p Ansd this puppy, sped through
outer space, became a sudden
symbol of the madness of our
times. This Russian sacrifice to
science, in the modern mind,
became a martyr. Thousands of
monkeys died to make the Salk
polio vac-cine possible, and a
million rats and rabbits have
died to prove various expen-
ments. Nobody cared.

But in the case of the dog-
inhabited Sputnik, the Russians
made a grave mistake in pub-
lic relations. They should have
used anything else, including
Khrushchev, for that trip into
space, but never a dog, who
still qualifies as man’s best
friend, not as man’s worst
enemy.

*- ‘ FOR GOVERNOR:
NELSON A. ROCKEFELLER

After careful deliberation, THE NEWS favors the elec-
tion of Nelson A. Rockefeller, Republican, as the next
Governor of New York, to succeed Gov. Ave1 ell Harriman,
Democrat. ,

We think highly of Gov.
Harriman personally, a n d
believe he has done his best
according to his lights; but
we fear his lights aren ’t
bright enough.

Some of his appoint-

 

seem to us to have been far
too political—~notably his
replacing of Lt. Gen. George
P. Hays on the Waterfront
Commission with John P.
McGrath, the H a r r i m a n
campaign manager; and his
_ supplanting of ,Mrs. Caro-
line K. Simon on the Anti-
Di-scrimi'nation Commission
with a Liberal Party
politician.
The Governor 's nonchalance toward the Apalachin crime
Convention hasn’t looked good to us. We can’t care for his
statement Sunday that he would never enforce the Conden-

KHEEL LAYS IT ON THE LINE

In a telephone interview Sunday with Jack Turcott of
THE NEWS, impartial transit chairman Theodore Kheel
came out ﬂatly for forbidding private automobiles to park
below 59th St. in Manhattan and in congested sections’of
. other boroughs.

Private Car Ban This drastic measure, said
For Manhattan ? Mr. Kheel, would (1) at least tem—

porarily wipe out the Transit Au.-
thority’ s deﬁcits by forcing more people to use the subways
and buses, and (2) radically cut trafﬁc congestion.

We’ve‘feltfor years that this remedy eventually will

 

have to be adopted, though wedislike the idea of curtailing

anybody’s use of his car or compelling people to use any
particular means of transportation. _

, Now that Kheel has laid it on the line, let’s have some
full and frank discussion of his proposal—leading off with
suggestions from all who think they have better solutions
than Kheel’s. Solutions that will work, we mean.

SWISS BLACKBALL GREAT BRAIN

A faction 1n Switzerland’s Parliament proposed recently
that the Swiss Government be empowered to cut the work
week in that country from 48 to 44 hours 1n the next year.

‘ The SWiss labor unions came out heavily against this
notion, saying they didn’t want any Great Brain in Berne
meddling with matters that shouldbe ‘settled between em-
ployers and workers. Swiss voters overwhelmingly de-
feated the propOsal day before yesterday.

The Swiss’ insistence on thinking for themselves has
been paying off for generations, and still is paying off, in
prosperity, lack of labor trouble, and various other things.

In which connection, it’s a pleasure to see the——

‘ GREAT BRAIN IDEA
wblackballed in our own city by Dr. John J. Theobald, the
new Superintendent of Schools.

Dr. Theobald has just come out for restoring a lot of
independence and initiative to school principals and teach-
ers, and taking away a good deal of the Board of Educa-
tion’s powerto lay down blanket regulations to apply to
all the schools.

“The local , school,”
“ought to be able to fashion the pro-
gram 0f education in order to best
meet the needs of its community."

That makes eminent sense to us; and we hope Dr.
Theobald will let nothing—the opposition of professional
educationists or anything else-keep him from pressing for
adoption of this policy. .

A Shocking Example of

Humane organization reports on
case involving mistreatment of
dogs used in medical research

\ By roM WALLACE

THE ANIMAL WELFARE Insrrrurn;L head»
[quarters 22 East 1111!! orreet, New *YOrk,

reports a case of cruelty to animals which

should cause humane persons all over the
United States’to think about and inquire
into how dog‘s used in experimental sur~
gery are treated in their own communi-
ties.

tural advancement. That such crass bru-u
tality to animals as that which the Animal

Welfareulnstitute reports in Boston" could.
be practiced. in such acommunity is hardly
less than horrifying. It indicates that an

education sufficiently high. to qualify a7

man for experimental surgery may be. cou-
pled under one hat with an astounding lack
of horse sense. saying nothing about the
humaneness that should be expected of
persons responsible for the handling of de-
fenseless animals.

Dog’s which are used by surgeons in ex-

periments should be so kept prior to 0p» "

should be carefully, umanely, handled if
the experiments upon them are to have
any educative valuei Nothing is learned
if a dog which survitves an operation dies
because it is cruellyjabused after surgery.

In the case which involved a Boston
clinic, bodies of dogs; were found by police
of a Boston suburb in a pond. They showed
evidence of recent surgery- The police
investigation resulted in discovery of a
chicken farm on which; as a sideline, dogs
used by a Boston clinic were kept. on mud
in. a. floorless pen and fed garbage “three
or four times a Week.”

In. the pen! were 11 live dogs and. one
dead dog Which had been half devoured by
Survivors. _ In;..the”pen there was a dog
Which~wasﬂnable to,stand and other dogs
walked. over it. In its chest was an open
and festering surgical wound. That dog
was taken by the SiP.C.A. to the Angeli
Memorial Dog Hospital, where it died. I An
autopsy resulted in more than a litre of
pus being taken from the dog’s heart sac.
According to the testimony of the chief of
staff at the hospital,‘~between 600 and 700
cubic centimetres of'pu‘s were found in the
chest cavity and: there waspus in the ab-
dominal cavity. ' .

The Animal Welfare Institute presents
in its Information Bulletin an introductory
article followed by a reprint of testimony

vealed in Boston.

" nimal Cruelty In Boston i

in a court in Wrentham, where trials re-
sulted in a doctor being fined $50 for cruel
transportation of a dog not in a good
physical condition, and in a sentence of
six months in the House of Correction for
the chicken farmer who mishandled dogs
before and after they were submitted to
surgery.

The farmer testified, in explaining why

.a dead hen was found in the dog pen, that

when he found a fowl dead in the poultry
yard he pitched it into the dog pen. in
addition to the garbage he dumped there
every three or four days. Testimony
showed that the surgeon who was‘con-
ducting the experiments had never seen
the enclosure in which the dogs were kept.
The chicken farmer received as compen-
sation for keeping the dogs $50 a week.

THE ANIMAL RESCUE CLINIC invites atten.
tion to the testimony that resulted. in
the two convictions and speculates upon
whether there are in other centers of pop
ulation conditions comparable to those re-

A layman would suppose that everysur-
geon would have sufficient horse sense to
know that education is .not served by exu
periments on dogs handled before and
after surgery as those ~ which figured in]
the Boston case were handled. but that oh-
viously is not true of every surgeon.

Louisville surgeons experiment upon
dogs that are housed humanely, fed rightly
and looked after carefully and competently
after experiments That this is true—~that
a veterinarian is employed to supervise
the dogs—eis due partly to the unflagging
interest. of and uncompensated services of
a dedicated Louisvillian, Miss Carolyn Ver-
hoeff. But it is due also to the fact that
Louisville surgeons have co-operated in~
telligently and amiably with Miss Verhoeff.‘

I am sure that everyone who reads the
Animal Welfare Institute’s report of the
Boston case will feel disposed—regardless
of whether he is a dog lovers—to partici-
pate in investigation of circumstances in
which dogs in‘his community are subjected
to experimental surgery.

If what court records show did happen
in. Boston could happen in a city as ad- J.
vanced as Boston, what may not be taking i
place in many other cities? If one isur-fi
geon does not know that after an operation '
a dog should be treated about as carefully
«a—as humanely—as a human patient should 1

 

be treated, lest the experiment have ndi
educative value,‘ how many more surgeonsi:
are equally lacking in gumption, regardless ‘

of their attainments as scientists?

Rain of Death

EXTENSION OF REMARKS
or

HON. JOHN D. DINCELL

or MICHIGAN , '
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

' ' Monday, January 18,1960

' Mr. DINGELL.’ Mr. Speaker, pursuant
to permission granted, I insert herewith
in the RE‘CORD an article entitled “Rain
of Death,” from the November—December

‘ 1959 issue of Information Report, which
. is published by the Animal Welfare
Institute:
RAIN or DEATH

The effect of the most “popular” new poi-
sons on life—~whether human or animal
life-becomes increasingly serious with
every passing year, since more millions 0f

pounds of these highly toxic chlorinated

hydrocarbOns and organic phosphates are
constantly being spread more ‘widely and
their effect is often cumulative.

The effect on animals is well summarized

by .a responsible zoologist who has studied

the problem, Dr. George J. Wallace of Michi-~

gan State University: “The cur-rent wide-
spread program poses the greatest threat
that animal life in North America has ever
faced—worse than deforestation, worse than
illegal shooting, ' worse than drainage,

drought, oil pollution, possibly Worse than
If"

all these decimating factors combined.
‘ this and other pest-eradication programs are
Jcarried out as now projected, we shall have
been witnﬂesses within a single decade, to a
greater extermination of animal life than in
all the previous years of man’s history on
earth.” (Reader’s Digest, June 1959). '
In Long Island, N.Y., last .year, citizens
isought an injunction against mass spraying
jof DDT by airplane by the US. Depart-
5 ment of Agriculture. Testifying on the
danger to human health and life was. Dr.
Malcolm M. Hargraves, of the Mayo Clinic.

Following is a summary of his statements as '

i reported by William Longgood in the Ameri-
can Mercury, July 1958: “Dr. Hargraves testi-

ﬁed that he was positive that DDT and its
aplastic anemia,

solvents cause leukemia,
Hodgkins disease, jaundice and other bloOd
disorders, many of them fatal. Of more
than "200 people he has treated for those
maladies during the last 4 or 5 years, he said,
all showed exposure to chlorinated hydroe
[carbons Dozens of them are now dead, he
‘added. He emphasized that, while he spoke
‘for himself as an individual, the majority of
lhematologists he works with at the Mayo
jClinic share his beliefs about the danger of
DDT Dr. Hargraves was not the ﬁrst to im-
lplicate DDT as a cause of cancer. Dr. W. C.
Hueper, head of, environmental cancer re-
search of the National Cancer Institute, De-
partment of Health, Education, and Welfare,
has listed as carcinogens, the chlorinated
hydrocarbon pesticides, especially aramite
and DDT.” .

In “Public Health Aspects of the New In-
secticides” (American Journal of Digestive
Disease, November 1953) Dr. Morton S. Bis-
gkind includes a bibliography of 119 scientiﬁc
papers on the subject. The great amount of
jcareful scientiﬁc study showing the danger
’to human health has not, however, brought
about any reduction in the use of the poisoIis.
On the contrary, the amount used and degree
of toxicity are constantly going up instead of
down.

One of the biggest programs for spreading
‘ a chlorinated hydrocarbon, in this case

‘ heptachlor, is in the ﬁre ant eradication pro-
gram for which Congress voted an appropria-

"soil; .
poisons through feeding on the; leaves; the

the protests of conservation agencies. The
State of Alabama, however, has refused to
accept the program this year. In 1958 State

‘ ConserVation Department ofﬁcials there founCW

that up to 75 percent of, all wildlife might be
killed _
Southern States, however, will continue des-r
pite reports‘such as the followingby Con-
gressman LEE METCALF', of Montana (CONe
GRESSIONAL RECORD, March 18,1959): “In two
areas that were treated with heptachlor for
eradication of the imported ﬁre ant, birds
were reduced 75 to 85 percent—quail and
rabbit populations were virtually wiped out.

Fire ant eradication work in Monroeville, '

Ala., last July was reported in the Mon‘tgom- ,
ery Journal to have resulted in the deaths of
hundreds of chickens, more than? 50 dogs,"
many cats, some birds and an undetermined
number of turkeys, _ducks and squirrels.
Veterinarian O. L. Poitevint, of Climax, Ga...
has stated that the deaths of upward to 100
.head of cattleand large numbers of chickens,
t‘uikeys,’goats, and sheep, and reproductive
failure in 100 to 150 brood sows, resulted from
ﬁre ant treatment. arOund that community.”
The reproductive failure mentioned above
is characteristic of the effects of sublethal
doses of this/type of poison. For example,
in 1 an article by .Dr. "James B. DeWitt, Fish
and Wildlife, Service chemist (“Wildlife in'
North Carolina,” September 1957), the au-4
thor states in summarizing experiments at
the Patuxent Wildlife Research Refuge: “In

no case has it been possible toget reproduc- ,

tion from quail or pheasants which had been;
reared and maintained on diets containing,
insecticides, if- the parents of these birds also
had received insecticides. in the reproduc-f
tion diet. ” In other words, after the second

- generation, there are no more baby quail or

baby pheasants

OUr national bird, the bald eagle, is ap-
parently succumbing to this same form of
decimation. Mr. Charles Broley, the leading

expert on eagles, is reported (New York

Times, September 13, 1958) as stating that
“his observations had convinced him that 80
percent of Flouda’ s bald eagles were sterile.”
He noted that the eagles lived largelyon ﬁsh.

\

, tion of $2, 400 ,000 for the coming year, despite . ” - - ’

if the” program centinu‘ed. Other

In a recent issue of Audubon magazine he ’.

quoted the. late .Dr. Herbert R. Mills, a bac-
teriologist, as having found a large residue
of DDT in many ﬁsh found dead in Tampa
(Fla) Bay. Mr. Broley said that "in 1940
there were 500 active nests in Florida; now
the total is probably only 80. ”

There are other Ways, too, in which these ‘-

persistent poisons carry on their ﬁght
against living things long after their mig-h
inal application. Rachel Carson, author of '

“The Sea Around Us,”_ wrote in the Wash— 1
' ington Post, April 10, 1959:

“During the past
15 years, the use of highly poisonous hydro-
carbons and of organic phosphates allied to

. the nerve gases of chemical warfare has built

up from small beginnings to what a noted
British ecologist recently called an amazing
rain of death upon the surface of the earth. -
Most of the chemicals leave long-persisting

residues on vegetation, in soils and even in --~~"'«

the bodies of earthworms and other organ-
isms on which birds depend for food. The
key to the decimation of the robins which
in some ”parts of the country already

amounts to virtual extinction is their reli-
ahce on earthworms as food. The sprayed f.“ ,
leaves With their load of poison eventually"

fall to become part of the leaf litter of the
earthworms acquire and store the

following spring the returning robins feed "on

the worms. As few as 11 such earthworms;
are a lethal dose, a fact conﬁrmed by careful
research in Illinois. ”

While birds and mammals are succumb- f;

ing to the poisons designed to kill inseam.
what is happening to? the insects them—
selves? Vast numbers of them have bee

killed, of course. .. “However, insects repro~
duce on a scale' 3:96- With 3.; Speed unknown
to warm-blooded creatures. They can de-
velop new strains withina .very brief space
of time, and they have done, so. In “Insecti-
cides, Boon or Bane" by Paul F. Springer,
Fish and Wildlife Service biologist (Audu-
bon magazine, summer .1956) this passage
appears:
After World War II, DDT was by far the
most popular insecticide and was considered
' a, panacea for insect control. But the in-
sects were not to be counted out so soon.
In an amazingly short time, resistant pop-
ulations of certain species began to appear.
Some were able it withstand dosages of DDT
1,000 times greater than those originally

needed to kill their ancestors. Now, in many ‘

parts of the country, such pests as house-
ﬂies, mosquitoes, roaches, body lice, ﬂeas’,
bedbugs, lygus bugs on alfalfa, saltmarsh
caterpillars, imported cabbage worms, cab-
bage , loopers and codling moths are im—
possible to control economically with DDT.

When resistance of these insects was ﬁrst .

noted, it seemed;a simple matter of turning
to other insecticides for’their control. But
‘é'this didn’t always work. While substitutes
sometimes proved temporarily effective, it
was found that resistance to poisoning by
DDT. frequently meant they were resistant
to other chlorinated hydrocarbons 'or that.
resistance to these alternate compounds
quickly, developed. Hence, there is a need
for an, entirely different group of control
insecticides which accounts for present in-
creasing interest in the organic phosphates."

The organic phosphates are indeed inter-
esting. As noted in the article, by William
F. Longgood quoted earlier, “Some of . the
organic phosphates are so lethal that a
single drop-in a person’s eye will cause death
within seconds.”

At least one manufacturer of chemicals
has recognized *the biological facts. Mr.
William T. Thompson,‘ president of the
Thompson Chemical Co. of St. Louis and
Los Angeles, ,has stated: "We have decided
to withdraw entirely from the production,
distribution and research of the presently
known agricultural insecticides. A 12-year
study. has convinced us that the currently
known and used broad spectrum insecticides
and their widescale application to agricul-
tural crops—although giving temporary con-
trol and temporarily increased yields—are
at. best palliative,. and perhaps will prove
dangerous and uneconomic in the long run.

«“The growing number of insect pests of
economic importance that are becoming re-
sistant to presently used agricultural in-
secticides demonstrates a serious inherent
danger in widescale use. The imbalance of
the fauna population caused by the destruc-
tion of natural predators and parasites (thus
allowing the uninhibited development of the
insect pest) is further proof to us of the
unsoundness of the. current chemical in-
secticides. This can only result in rapid and
dynamic development of the insect pest from

the few not controlled .by the application,_

but can easily cause heretofore unimportant
insects to increase to the status of economic
pests, once the predator-parasite balance has
been unset. ‘ 7 -.
» “The ingestion of presently employed in-
secticide residues by humans and other
warmblooded animals is a correlative prob-
lem of a highly serious nature.” . ,
These intelligent thoughts are the excep-
tion rather than the rule, however; most of
, the‘ manufacturers are determined to de-
fend themselves and their products. An arti-
cle in the New .York Times, November 22.
‘1959, headed “Pesticide Scare Worries Mak-
’ers, Chemicals Producers Fear Bad Public

' Reaction to Cranberry Incident,” states in‘

part: “Leaders of the volatile argicultural
chemical industry also are expressing deep

//.

CONGRESSIONAL. RECORD 4‘- APPElV

“Insect resistance to chemicals;

 

\

concern. Some fear a ' possible reaction
against the increasing application of pesti-
cides and other Chemicals in agriculture that
eventually could cut into sales.

“It was, an allegedly harmful residue from
a chemical weed killer, aminotriazole, that
prompted action with regard to cranberries.

“Some industry oﬂ‘icials also fear the pos-
sibility of still tighter Government regu1a~
tions governing the manufacture and mar-
keting of agricultural chemicals. \

“ ‘In Order to meet Government require-
ments we must new spend up to $2 million

 

in research over a period of up to 5 years

before a new product can be marketed,’ said
one top oﬂ‘icial Of an agricultural chemical
company. '

“ ‘We believe products now on the market
are thoroughly safe and that any further
restrictions would make our research costs
prohibitive.’ "

It is difﬁcult to guess just what this
spokesman means by the phrase “thoroughly 1
safe.” '

The American Medical AssociatiOn Council
on Pharmacy and Chemistry states that/“it
is not reasonable to expect that human be-
ings can avoid injury if they are exposed
* *"* year after year to a toxic agent in
atmospheric concentrations that kill insects
in a few. hours.” Clearly, it is fantastic to
call such poisons “thoroughly safe.” They
are killing birds by the thousand, ﬁsh by the
ton. Many of them have been shown to be
carcinogenic when taken over a period of
time in sublethal doses. The Food and
Drug Administration has denied any-toler-
ance rating to many of, them, including ;
heptachlor of ﬁre ant fame and also DDT. .
Nevertheless, DDT has been found to be
present in a high percentage of the milk ‘
tested for its presence, and the average
American has DDT stored in his fat. ' '

It is estimated (Congressman-LEEMETCALF, i
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, September 2, 1959)
that “at least 3 billion pounds of these
chemicals were sprayed over more than 70
million acres of our crop and timberland to '
kill insects, weeds and plant diseases last 3
year."

The 86th Congress has appropriated $2,- ‘
565,000 for (study of the effects of pesticides
on ﬁsh and wildlife. It also passed an
amendment to the pure food and drug law
which prohibits sale of food containing any
residues of any carcinogenic substance.
These are steps in the right direction, but .
they have not stopped plans to continue the J
huge heptachlor dispersal in« the South
which will certainly kill birds and animals ‘
on a tremendous scale. Effective action to
step unnecessary dissemination of poison is
urgently needed for the protection of our
wildlife, our domestic animals and ourselves.

is a? particularly acute issue
apartments in co-ops. '

People" which appeared in The
Post’s ' daily magazine section

pointed out that more than 100,~
000 families in the city are at-
.feCted by the ban, which is still
lspreading to more buildings.

‘ . a . :5 ‘ as - .
, This week we went again to
Martin Trainor, an expert, in

 

these matters, to ﬁnd out the. 5
current situation. ‘Trainor, an 3..

Upper East Side. civic leader,
is an attorney with offices at
,7 E. 48 St. He first gotinVolved
aWith landlord-pet owner legal
problems a few years ago when

case. —

Here are some of the points
that - Trainor made ' regarding
pet owners who live —in-'-—or are
considering buying into—co-ops-
that bar pets:

urchase agreement "before buys
ing. Better still, have your at-
torney look at it; he’ll be able
to spOt the implicationsof some
provisions that may look in-
nocent to you. .

Second, don’t panic and don’t
,lose your temper if the man-‘
agement tells you to get rid of
your pet. Keep 'cool and get
legal advice fast. Many legal
areas involving co-op’s are still
unclear, and you may be in. a
better position than you think.
But don’t get- too optimistic; at
this point it looks as if the law
is all on the side of the co-op
managements. However, your
proprietary interest in the build-
ing may affect the courts if
you choose to light. But don?t
be t h e r circulating petitions »
among your neighbors. The
petitions won’t help at all.

Third, most cases never reach-
the courts. Attorneys for the
tenant and the management, be-

dispassionate, usually can reach
an agreement that leaves the
pet in the apartment, although
some special provisions for its
care may be necessary.

Whether you. own a co-op-
apartment or rent your living
quarters, remember that land-
lord problems are least likely to
arise where pets are Well cared
for and are not permitted to be-
come nuisances. If you must
leave your dog alone during-the
day,>'make sure he’s trained not
to bark at every noise in the
shallNlI he has an accident in the
hall, clean it up promptly, and
don’t let him. go on the, grass
around thesbuilding. ‘
Last spring we pointed ou
jth‘at the Appellate Division, in
La case involving an apartment
still under rent control, hold'
that “the mere keeping of a dog
in contravention; of the terms
of a lease‘is not a breach ”of a
“substantial part of the tenancy.”
Perhaps this liberal interpreta-
tion “can be extended, ' although
that’s our hope.

California packers use
"painless slaughtering

- _ _---—-

,1; The 2,000,000 hogs expected to
fbe slaughtered in California this
year will be affected by two new
‘laws intended to reduce fear and
pain among animals and injury
to workers in pack‘i'nghouses.

The federal humane slaughter
law, effective July 1, requires all
packers who sell to the govern-
ment to slaughter all animals by
an approved method. A California
state law, the first of several state
humane slaughter bills, supple-
ments the federal law and pro-
vides for local enforcement
through the California Depart-
'ment of Finance.

ApprOved methods of stunning
range from electric shock and
mechanical concussion instru-
ments to a type of anesthesia sim-
ilar to that used with humans
undergoing surgery. The latter
method, carbon dioxide immobili-

 

zation, is so gentle that in one
test a hog that had passed through '1
the system but purposely had not
been kill-ed, did not resist repeat-
ing the trip soon after regaining
consciousness. ‘

Cardox Division of Chemetron
CorporatiOh, which supplies car-
bon dioxide to. the packers, said
the .method keeps hogs uncon-
scious for about four minutes,
twice the time needed for slaugh-
tering. The heavier-than-air gas
gathers at the 'bottomof a tunnel
which is depressed in the center.
Animals Walk into the tunnel and
emerge, unconscious, on a con-
veyor belt.

The ni r ns-titu-te
a humane society that led in the
fight for passage of the laws, says
injuries to workers and bedlam
in the plants will be reduced be-
cause killing-floor employees no
longer will be in constant contact
with animals fighting for their
lives.

They’re hunting coyotes and COy-dogs now through-
out the East, right down to the New York City line These
wild animals have been shot by hunters just a few miles
from New York in Westehester County, in New Jersey,
and in Connecticut’s Fairﬁeld County. ‘

The wooded a1eas of the en-
the Eastern Seaboard abound
. with coyotes now, although few
people here are aware of it, and
hunters consider it sport to gun
these creatures down.

:5 ~14 55

There’s a coy-dog in New
York, on the Upper West Side,
in the apartment of. Dean and
Hedy White, and a more likable
creature you’ll never see.

This animal, half coyote and
halt dog, is affectionate, obedi-
ent, and as companionable as
any dog. She’s a good watchdog,
but, when she knows it’s all
right, she’s happy to greet visi-
tors to the office of Our Pet
World magazine, which the
Whites publish.

But hunters and some state
officials assert that coyotes and
coy-dogs, roaming as wild things,
destroy not only vegetables and
small rodents, but also fowl,
sheep, and deer. They will not
attack man unless they are
rabid.

$- A?- a.

A dog that has reverted to

the wild state—«usually because

its owners have abandoned it--

may do as much damage as a
coyote or a’coy-dog, and may be
more vicious.

Coyotes have been seen in
New Y01k state at least since
1912, and in 1ecent yea1s a big
migiation of the species into
the Eastern states from On-
tario, Minnesota,Wisconsin and
Michigan has caused the breed
' to increase rapidly in these
parts.

About a fifth of them are the
result of matings with dogs,
usually German shepherds, col-
lies or setters. The dog and the
coyote, of. course, belong to the
same animal family.

A coyote weighs 20 to 30
pounds; a coy-dog, 40 to 50
Both have triangular faces that
look like a iox’s. The eyes and
ears are set far apart, and the
muzzle is narrow. The ears are
pricked up like a shepherd’s,
but they sometimes drop in the
coy-dog. The bushy tail is car-
ried low.

If you ﬁnd one of these ani-
mals, there’s probably another
nearby, for coyotes mate for
life. Moreover, coyotes and coy-
dogs generally travel in packs
of up to six animals.

The widespread apartment ban on pets is a never-end-‘
ing problem for pet owners in this and other cities, and it
is a particularly acute issue for New Yorkers who buy

apartments in co-ops.
In the series on

last spring under our byline, we
‘ . pointed out that more than 100,-
000 families in the city are af-
fected by the ban, which is still

This week we went; again to M

’Martin Trainer, an expert in
"these matters, to ﬁnd out the
. current situation. Trainer, an
Upper East Side civic leader,
is an attorney with offices at
7 E. 48 St. He ﬁrst got involved
with landlord-pet owner legal
"problems a few years ago when
. his friend. Harry Rapp of the
1 Irish Echo, an enthusiastic pet
owner, asked him to handle a
case. ..

.Here are some of the points
that Trainer made regarding
pet owners who live in—or are

censidering buying intO—co-ops

that bar pets.

First, study the lease or
. purchase agreement before buy-
‘ king. Better still, have your at
torney look at it; he’ll be able
to spot the implications of some
provisions that may look in-
nocent to you.

Second, don’t panic and don’t
lose your temper if the man-
agement tells you to get rid of
your pet. Keep cool and get
legal advice fast. Many legal
areas involving co-ops are still
unclear, and you may be in a
better position than you think.
But don’t get too optimistic; at
this point it looks as if the law
is all on the side of the co-op
managements. However, your
proprietary interest in the build-
ing may affect the courts if
you choose to tight. But don’t
b o t h e r circulating petitions
among your neighbors. The
petitions won’t help at all.

Third, most cases never reach
the courts. Attorneys for the
tenant and the management, be-
_Cause they are capable of being
"dispassionate, usually can reach
an agreement that leaves the
pet in the apartment, although
some special provisions for its
care may”. be neac‘essary.

Whether you own a co-op
apartment or rent yOur living
quarters, remember that land-
lord problems are least likely to
,arise where pets are well cared
.for and are not permitted to be-
COme nuisances. If you must
leave your dog alone during the
day, make sure he’ s trained not
.to bark at every noise in the
hall. If he has an accident in the
hall, clean it up promptly, and
don’t let him go on the grass
around the building.

Last spring we pointed out
that the Appellate Division, in
a. case involving an apartment
still under rent control, hold

"that “the mere keeping of. a dog,

in contravention of the terms
of a lease is not a breach of a
substantial part of the tenancy.”
Perhaps this liberal interpreta-
tion can be extended, although
that’s our hope

The most curious fact about

Last week we carried Mrs.
Bea Williams’ suggestion that
instructions for the care of par-
akeets be mimeographed and
distributed when the birds were
given away as prizes during
Mulberry St.’s Festival of San
Gennaro. Mrs. Christine'Stevens,
president of the Animal Wel-
fare'Institute, read the items,
got in touch with Mrs. Williams,
and saw to it that such instruc-
tions were mimeographed. Then
Mrs. Williams persuaded t h e
Festival people to distribute the
instructions. A pat on the back

we disagree), but we know the

dogs, in proportion to the whole
purebred dog population, being
bred. today than there were
years ago. _ ‘ ‘ .

ful about their breeding pro-

There’s victory to; report in the dispute over annual

laboratory conditions at St. Vincent’

AATWo weeks ago this column
was devoted to charges that
dogs, rabbits and other animals

were being kept in unsanitary 5'

and dangerous conditions at the
hospital. A dog had jumped
off the roof of the 12-story

building, prompting the- in-
vestigation.
Except for Ed and Pegeen

Fitzgerald who waged a vigor-

ous campaign on their noon-
: time W’OR program, no other

11 ewsp a p or or broadcaster

bOthered to look into the matter
. (except for one newspaper
7 which decided to accept the hos-
pital’s story)

This Week we received the
following announcement from
the ASPCA:

“The ASPCA and the NeW ‘

York State Society for Medical
Research have reached an agree-
"..ment which will withhold the
g1V1no' of any lost, strayed or
.-abandoned animals to St. Vin-

. cent’s Hospital until its labor-
atory quarters are rehabilitated.-

“Informed of this action,
which is the result of a dog’s
Jumping off the hospital’s roof
on July 25 a spokesman for
"the institution said that until
improvements meeting ASPCA’s
standards w e r e completed,
there Was no intention of hous-
ing dogs or cats in its animal
quarters.

Metcalf Hatch law in 1952, the
ASPCA, by private arrangement

The ASPCA statement raises
more questions than it answers.
True, it disposes once and for
all of the hospital’s statement
that there was a fence around
the roof where the dogs were
exercised '

What about the other charges
made two weeks ago by Mrs.

' Christine Stevens, president of

the Animal Welfare Institute.

What about the vermin, the
. . parasites on rabbits, the animal

excrement under the rabbit

cages? What about water for

the animals? The ASPCA

inspector might have been mis—

led about dogs being exercised

on leashes, but coul.’dnt he see

the unsanitary conditions. for
. himself? ,
Exactly what are the
“ASPCA’s standards anyway?
1 Nevertheless, this Victory at
St. Vincent’s represents a mile-
stone. A ,preCedent has been-
set. It is now acknowledged by
the ASPCA and the State
Society for Medical Research“
that certain/(minimum stand-
ards of care must be maintained
for laboratory animals.

From now on; every labor-
story that uses animals must
keep. its animals’ Welfare in
mind. This column (unlike the
Fitzgeralds and many other
people) does not disapprove of
the use of animals in experi-
mentation as such; we are grate-
Iul that so many animals have
lived longer, healthier, hap-
pier lives because of the re-i
search performed. with the use

The ASPCA has many ad-
mirable people on its board and
its staff. Its hospital in ex-
cell’ent.
ment is good and thedirector

program,
One-of the best in’ the world.
But the ASPCA, apart from
those . exceptions, is a bureau-
cracy that'has grown more and
more out oftbuch with the
ordinar y dog, cat, and bird
owner over the years. For
exandple, the ASPCA is sup-

has been defended by- ASPCA
officials in conversations with

NEW YORK~ Slaughter Vlit hout
fear or pain for _'1&nost of the 115
3 million food animals expected to. be
" butchered in U. S. packinghouses

this year is ensured by a new fed-
ei-ai humane slaughter law which
became effective July 1. It requires
all paci: ers who sell to the govern-
ment to render hogs, sheep, and
cattle insensible before they are
killed.

One method, carbon (1? :3:v::¥.:‘.-e_ i111-
mobilization, is so gentle that a
hog that had passed through the
system but puiposely had not been
killed, did not 1e1ist rep ating the
trip soon after regaining con ci01 s—
ness. Other methods appioved hy
the law are electric shock and me—
chanical concussion. Animals are
held up in a restraining pen while
the eiectric probe or mechanical
instrument is appiied to their heads.
1 Cardox Divisio: of Chesnctron
V’,,‘I_,Corporation, which Supplies: carbon
dioxide to the packeis said im—
mobilization keeps hogs uncon-
cscious for about four minutes,

tWice the time needed for slang h-

tering‘. The heavier- than air gas
gathers at the bottom of a tunnel
which is depressed in the center.
Animals walk into- the tunnel and
emerge unconscious on a conVeyor
belt.

Carbon dioxide and electric and
mechanical stunning methods are
humane, pa 111 ess, and quick. '

A humane society that backed
the law, the Ania—1a] Welfare In-
stitute, says injuries to wo773'1
and bedlam in the plants will be re-
' duced because killingﬂoor em—
, ployees no longer will be in con-
stant contact with animais iighting,

and chrrently Secretary of Health, Education and We. a, e

3 ' . I in the Kennedy Cablnet. .

We do not think highly,
though, of the Socialist medicine .
plan which Mr. Ribicoff is trying ,
to sell to Congress. We think even
less of this scheme after reading
a speech the Secretary'dehvered a
few "days ago to the graduating

' class of the University of Cah- ,
fornia Medical School in San g
Francisco. ‘ 7 .

The speech led off with a de-
tailed reminder of how good the;
taxpayers had been to. these; .
young men in ﬁnancing the medi-K lg

- \ 'cal school and any public scheols; "
they may have attended‘before beginning to study med1c1ne. ll}

They were urged to love their fellow men, serve them,
selflessly, andé-by implicatiOn, at least—think not seriously;
if at all about what fees to charge for this service. ‘ ' , ~

Ri‘bicoff climaxed his speech with a predictlon that, as;
time goes on, all Americans will expect to have ‘ adequate
health care on the list of basic rights.” . , ._

Throughout the speech, one could detect a verledthreat . ,
that, if the doctors don’t play along ..W,1th the poht1c1ans in
furnishing more and more .“free” medical serv1ce,-the polls-“g
ticians will take over the doctors. , . - . 7

_ not only to protect the doctors’ independence, but also to“;

Needless Cruelty over the country.
In Laboratories 7 This newspaper has never
editorially opposed vivisection— ,
experiments on live animals—though we have a hunch that
'somerof it is useless and more of it is done—by callous and/ or
sadistic so-and-sos for whom. the death penalty might be
the proper prescription. . . ,
. But, according to such temperate and responsible out- ,.
ﬁts as the Humane Society of the United States and the
Animal Welfare Institute, a heart-rending number of poor,
helpless animals suffer needlessly in. many a laboratory
throughout the nation. . ” '
Says the Humane Society:

We are not relying on rumor, hearsay, or conjecture . . .
Our-staff investigators have worked inside laboratories, all over
America, as laboratory technicians and animal caretakers. Our
ﬁles hold hundreds of detailed reports . . . We have hundreds
of photographs of the laboratory animals on operating tables,
in cages, chained to walls . . . Cruelty and suffering have quan-

titatively increased, and the general ,‘public is almost universally -
convinced that laboratory animals are humanely treated.

Two bills aimed at radically cutting down this scientiﬁc
savagery have been introduced in the present Congress.
They are H. R. 3556 (supported by the Humane Society) ~
and H. R. 1937~backed by the Animal Welfare Institute, .

Either measure looks desirable, so far as we can make
out. Both are designed to put the laboratories under strict

, governmental supervision, with provisions for cracking
- down hard on any laboratory found to tolerate needless
\ cruelty to experimental animals. , .
' Neither bill seeks to outlaw what ina'hy doctors still
contend isnecessary, result-getting Vivisection.
‘ a: a: it

The AMA, we believe, would, be wise to withdraw i
oppositionto these bills. Particularly at this time, it cou
use all the good-will which such a pullback would gener

- for the AMA among the tens of millions of" Americans

, like animals and-detest cruelty to them.

Pei- Notes

As a result of recent men-
tions of Cats magazine and All-
Pets magazine here, a number
of readers have asked for more

cations. Cats magazine costs $4
a year and can be obtained by
writing to its offices at 4 Smith-
ﬁeld St.., Pittsburgh 22, Pa; it’s
wonderful reading for those of

 

us who love cats, whether
we’re just. owners of strays or

 

him with you to busy streets
on a leash, and give him some
petting and a treat when a car
backﬁres or some other sharp
sound startles him.

Remember, too, that nervous-
ness can be avoided in dogs;
it isn’t inevitable. Truly well-
bred dogs should have sound
nerves. Try to buy a dog whose
nerves are steady.

; Christmas Gift Books
Set for Dog Hobbyists

Here it is coming onto
Christmas, and what should
one give a dog hObbyist for
Christmas but a good dog
book. Book stores have dozens
of books on individual breeds,
and there are some extra
special collections.

~ For example, there’s ALL
DOGS GO TO HEAVEN (Gros-
set & Dunlap, $4.95). This is a
collection of classic dog
stories selected by Beth
Brown, and including one by
herself.

Some of the great ones in-
clude Curwood’s “Kazan,”
Vereen. Bell’s “Brag .Dog,”
MacKinlay ' Kantor’s “Th e
'Voice "of Bugle Ann,” and
Bret Harte’s “A Yellow Dog.”

Beth Brown has a shorter
collection for juniors called
THE WONDERFUL WORLD
OF DOGS (Harper, $3. 95).

These include Ben Ames Wil-.

liams’ “Mine Enemy’s Dog,”
Terhune’s “The Coward,” Bor-
den Deal’s “The Christmas
Hunt,” and others.’This book
is supposed to be for junior
readers, but many at the
stories were actually written
for adults.

S Then there is THE COM-
PLETE BOOK OF DOG
|TALES by John T. Marvin
i(Howell, $4. 95). Marvin is a
well known Ohio breeder of
West Highland White Ter-
riers, an all terrier judge, and
kennel editor of the Dayton
Daily News.

The book. is primarily for
dog show enthusiasts, who
may find themselves includ-
ed, along with Billy Lang, Ma-
rie Meyer, Charlie Meyer,
Percy Roberts, Col. Dick
Davis, and others.

Marvin mixes ancient tales
with stories of the show ring,
so that you get puppy tales,
sad tales, true tales, and
screwy tales.

 

THE COMPLETE FOX TER-
RIER by Evelyn L. Silvernail
(Howell, $5.95) is a long

needed and truly excellent

book on both Wire and
Smooth Fox Terriers. This
book has 86 above average
pictures of great dogs, good
drawings by Ernest Hart, and
a comprehensive text

The silly season must be upon us, judging from the
nonsense about dogs that is finding its way into the public
prints these days. Some of it, unfortunately, may mislead

dog owners.

The worst—and most recent»—
example of this sort of thing
appeared last Sunday in a. week-
ly newspaper, The National En-
quirer. It charged that dogs are
being deliberately bred in de-
formed and grotesque shapes to
please the public and thus to
make money.

And how is the nefarious pro-
cess being carried on? By that
old bugbear, inbreeding, of
course.

.7.

a: ‘l‘

In the. entire article, only one
person talks sense about dog
breeding. He is Dr. Jay D. Hy-
man, of the Gramercy Park Ani-
mal Clinic, who points out what
every geneticist knowswthat in-
breeding simply accentuates
both the good and the bad quali-
ties of the parents in the off-
spring

In breeding, carefully planned,
is a very helpful (in fact, an es-
sential) part of any program of
sound breeding, because it helps
to ﬁx a type. ‘

The article also asserts that
rnany dogs are “overbred,” or
too highly bred. This is gibber-
ish! How can a dog be “over-
bred”? Or “too highly bred"? It
is either purebred or it isn’t.
And if it is purebred, it is either
carefully bred or badly bred.
(Did vou ever hear of a dog
being unde1 bred” or “too lowly
bred”?)

a: ~14 4‘5

As with most other sensa-
tional charges based on igno-
rance, those in the Enquirer
article do have a grain of truth
in them.

It is true that some dogs have
been developed»...grotesquely to
satisfy human whims. The apple-
headed dogswbulls, boxers, Bos-
ton terrierswoften have difﬁ-
culty with respiration. The toys
have been bred down so small
that many can’t whelp naturally.
The gene that carries the color
in Dalmations, blue merle col-
lies and Shetlands Sheepdogs is
coupled with congenital defects
of hearing and seeing. Bassets
have been bred so heavy. that
their legs are overburdened and
suffer from the strain.

Worse still is a factor com-
pletely unmentioned in the sen-
sational attack on dog breeders
—the emphasis on coat texture.
This is most observable in poo-

Parakeets Are Favorfe Firs'l's‘

By H. H. Miller

ODAY, more than a fifth
of the families in the Unit-
ed States own one or more
parakeets. The parakeet popu—

lation has risen rapidly each
year and seems destined to
continue on the upward
swing, for these brightly
hued, intelligent, often talk-
ative, often clownish com-
panions have taken a strong
hold on pet loving folk.

Naturally, in many homes
a parakeet may be the first
bird ever owned, so it fol-
lows that there may be mis-
takes in, keeping it thriving
and happy. .These may not be
intentional, of course, but
from lack of knowledge.

Handy Leaflet

To this end, and because it
is devoted to the interests of
all pets, the Animal Welfare
Institute, 22 East 17 Street,
New York, has a leaflet avail-
able on parakeet care, free
upon request. It covers many
essential points. For example,
the small cage used for trans
porting the birdfrom the pet

shop is merely a carrying

cage, not suitable for perma-
nent living quarters. Be sure
to get a cage large enough

Page L12

to allow the bird plenty of
room to move about. It should
be placed in a high, light place
in the room, away from ex—
cessive heat or direct sunlight
and, very important, away
from any drafts.

The cage must have perches
and a swing, as well as
water and seed trays, Fresh
seed and drinking water must

be kept in the latter. And.

there must be gravel in the
cage, otherwise the bird is un-
able to eat.

Shells Remain

A common error made by
first time owners is mistaking
leftover shell for un eaten
seed. The bird eats only the
kernel of the seed and leaves
the shell. Leftover shells
should be removed often and
the tray replenished with
fresh seed.

A bird is often very young
when purchased, perhaps such
a baby that he cannot find
the seed tray. Sprinkling some
seed along the gravel on the
floor of the cage will help him
find his way. Cuttlebone, and
a mineral cake should be pro-
vided and a small quantity of
fresh greens such as lettuce

parakeet may be the first bird
ever oWned, so it follows that
there may be mistakes in keeping
it thriving "and" happy. These may
not be intentional, of course, but
{rem lack of knovirled ge.

To this end, and ”because it is 5:
devoted to the interests of all

pets, the Animal We are Institute,

has a leaflet available on Para-
keet care, free upon request. It
covers many essential points. F01
example, the small cage used for
transporting the bird from the
pet shop is merely a “carrying”
cage, not suitable for permanent
living quarters. Be sure to get a
cage large enough to allow the

. bird plenty of room to move
about. It should be placed in a
high, light place in the room,
away from excessive heat or di-
rect sunlight and -— very impor-
tant -- away from any drafts.

The cage must have perches
and a swing, as well as water and
seed trays. Fresh seed and drink-
ing water must be kept in the
latter. And there must be gravel
in the cage, otherwise the bird is
unable to eat.

A common error made by first-
time owners is mistaking left-
oVer shell for unea-ten seed. The
bird eats only the kernel of the
seed and leaves . the shell. Left—
ov er shells should be removed

to give him flight freedom in the
100m. Be sure all windows and
doors are closed or screened. Also
be careful of household appli-
ances. A parakeet is full of cu-
riosity and m y even investigate
running wate from a faucet. If
it’s hot, it ca scald him.
Cleanliness essential in bird-
keeping. Kee the cage clean.
Cover it lightl with a dark cloth
at night. Bird are frightened and
made nervous by shrill noise or
so speak softly

with fresh seed.

A bird is often very youn
when purchased, perhaps such
baby that. he cannot fiiidxthe see
tiay. Sprinkling some seed along
the gravel on the» floor of the
cage will help him find his way.
CuttlebOne and a mineral cake
should be provided, and a small
quantity of fresh “greens” (let-
; tuce, etc. ) should be given sever-r
‘ al times ‘a week. . l

The stiair. of being in a new
environment is a heavy one. It
takes time for a bird to settle

rervousness may cause diarrhea.

(Q) “My girl friend has a toy
terrier puppy who has a habit of
crawling into the neighbor’s yard 1
and drinking stale water. What 3
can she do to break this habit?"~

L. J. D.

(A) How aboue sinking some
heavy-gauge wire into the ground 3
and bringing it high enough to .
prevent the puppy from going I
through the fence? Stale water,
such as in a ditch or depression
in the ground after‘ a rain, will do
no harm, however.
