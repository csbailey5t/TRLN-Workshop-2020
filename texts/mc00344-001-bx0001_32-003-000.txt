NOV. 10. 1959_

Bear Christine:

I have gone over the eXperdmental projects
you sent me and which you have suggested for use
by secondary school students. I regret to say
that I feel that many of them would be somewhat
difficult to run unless considerably more detailed
instruction were given. Some of them call for
equipment which the ordinary high school does not
possess and I am afraid that the teachers too would
have difficulty in aiding the students in some of
them.

I have expeessed myself somewhat along the
margins but it may be I am too old to appreciate
what younger people can do now~a~days. They probably are
more clever than I give them credit for.

I do not want to seem discouraging but before
you are through with this project you will undouﬁtedly have
found many workable projects. I might be well to get
in touch with some of the biology teachers in the
secondary schools and get their ideas. Most of the
projects would undoubtedly have to be done in connec-
tion with their school work.

Sincerely,

Cashew ‘

The Animal Welfare Institute
Attention.Mrt. Christine Stevens, President
730 Fifth Avenue

New York 19, N. Y,

Greetings:

Thanks for the cepy of the First Annual Report of
the Animal Welfare Institute which I have received. It is
encouraging to read of the accomplishments that have been real-
ized during the first year of its Operation. It gives an
indication of the vigor of the organization and of the
enthusiasm and true devotion of its officers and members.
It promises well for its future achdevement.

I am sorry that I can not be with you in person
at the annual meeting on October 1. I shall be with you, how-
ever, with the hope and supplication that the cause for which
you are working may succeed in the end and lead to a greater
control of unwarranted and unnecessary cruelty to our dumb
and helpless friends, .

Let us also trust, that as time passes, there may be
a greater understanding of the aim and purposes of t he.
Institute and that the shortsighted intolerance to its cause
in certain Quarters may eventually subside.

f If you as chief promoters of this new movement in

, ‘this country will keep in mind that little progress has been
made in any field without Opposition, you should take
oouréage from.the fact that truth will in.the end conguer
and a righteous cause succeed.

My best wishes are with you.

Sincerely,

EV dear
U

l have read with a greet deal of inte>eet
the Report of the Animal Welfare Institute for the
nest year. You have good reaeon to be proud of your
accompliehmente. More and more people are beginning
to take notice of he importance of the problems
involved in animal welfare and of the need for dreetic
changes in the treatment of animele under Vd ions
conditione. You have reeeone to feel encouraged.

In my abstract of the UFAW Handbook I
put down the pPl“e of the book as $9.50. Should you
in any may ever Lee this abet? ct (which i do not
tiinx you will) the coet of the booK should be changed

Ann Arbor, Michigan,
September 2, 1955.

Dr“. K. A. 513131198,

Dept. of Biology,

Michigan ﬁtate University,
East Lansing, ﬁich.

my dear Dr. Stiles:

I am writing you as a member of the Committee
in Charge of Local Arrangements for the A.I.B.S. meeting
to be held at the Michigan State University next week. It
has Just come to my attention that Booth so. 12 in the
EXhibit Hall which was assigned to the Animal Welfare
Institute early in the year, and which is also announced
in the program of the meeting, has been this last minute
taken away from this organization. I have not leernt the
reason for this move except that pressure was brought on
your Committee from the outside for reasons which can
hardly be Justified.

I have been interested in the Animal Welfare
Institute from the time of its inception and so far as I
can see there is nothing objectionable in its aims and
, purposes. It can in no sense be identified.with the anti-
vivisectionist movement since it has expressed no objection
to the use of animals for exocrimental purposes when such
use is in the hands of competent sen and for the purpose
of extending knowledge in connection with disease and.other
useful ends. The Institute has for its purpose the allevi-
ation of cruel and wanton use and destruction of animals
wheteher it be in laboratories, slaughterhdnes or else-
where. Itoaim is also to prevent seizure of animals from
established humane societies where animals are cared for
in a humane way.

My feeling is therefore that the remove]. of the
assigned booth for the use of the Institue is not in accord-
ance Wiunfair play and must have been.incited by men.or
organizations thst have no knowledge of the real purpose
of the Institute. I know that there is no use in asking
for a reconsideration of the question at this late date
but I feel that your Committee has not acted under full
knowledge of the situation and I for one wish to protest
such action as unjustified.

I em writing to you because I know you and

because you are located at the nichi an state Unive
Where the meeting w111 be held. g ° rsity

OFFICE OF THE DEAN

UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
HORACE H. RACKHAM
SCHOOL OF GRADUATE STUDIES-
ANN ARBOR

712 Sunset Road,
Ann.Arbor, Michigan,
October 14 , 1951 .

hrs. Christine Stevens,

Animal Welfare Institute,

730 Fifth Avenue,

New Yerk 19, N.Y.

My dear hrs.Stevens:

I have your letter regarding the meeting of the
.A.A.A.S. in Philadelphia, December 26-31. I bekieve it would
be desirable for the Animal Welfare; Institute to tame a small
booth at the meeting under special exhibits. It would afford
a chance to distribute circuia rs and literature and to solicit
interest. ‘The exhibits are well attended and I am sure that
you could make a booth very attractive so that it would demand
attention. If some good animal paintings, sketches, and other
illustrative material are available it would be geod.

Exhibits need.not be put up before the first day
of the meeting and although desirable it is not necessary that
an attendant be present all the time. There are dull and
active hours. >

I have not planned to be present at the meeting.
So far*I have had no notice of the program. It appears that it
is necessary to make hotel reservations early.

In the booths many concerns take down the names
and addresses of persons who seem to be interested so that
literature can be sent them afterwards. What is your idea
with regard to soliciting for membership? Should any fees
be attached?

" In requesting a booth I imagine a letter to
the Administrative Secretary of the A.A4A.S., 1515 Massachu-
setts Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. would be all that would
be necessary. I do not knOW'lf any fees are attached but
the Secretary would let you know how to proceed.

Best wishes,

Sincerely,
