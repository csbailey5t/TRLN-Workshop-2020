To Lovers of Wild Birds.

 

Are you fond of Birds 3’

Of course you are ; that is why you like to have them about you.

A Chafﬁnch, a Linnet, or a Lark, reminds you of the country and
cheers you with its song.

But have you thought of the price which these wild birds pay for
your pleasure ?

You want your bird to be happy.

What is happiness for a bird?

Freedom, fresh air, and wide space for flight—Freedom to choose
its mate and build its little home and rear its nestlings.

Do you realise that the music in which you delight is the bird’s
mating song ?

But the trees and bushes where it would naturally set up its cosy nest
are far out of reach, often out of sight, its wonderful wings are useless.

Have you seen~~-of course you havemthe tiny cages in which the
most free and active of God’s creatures are too often shut, to beat and
sometimes break their wings in despair?

Such a cage is only a prison—cell, indeed to a wild bird any cage is a prison.

The lowest criminal in prison has his hours of exercise and the hope
of release. The caged bird has not these.

Have you cast into prison a sweet and harmless fellow-creature
because you are fond of birds? Let it out!

Carry your cage to the nearest park. or common, open the door and
set the little captive free. He may be so cramped that he cannot ﬂy well
at ﬁrst. Watch him into safety. You will feel very happy when you see
his delight ; and you will then; know for certain that you are truly fond
of birds.
