BB / The Houston Post/Mom, Aug. 11, 1986

Specially trained pets watch out

y connecting ﬂight was delayed
and, according to the computer
screen in the airport corridor, it

would be about two hours before I would
begin my journey back to Houston.

Fortunately, I had a copy of James Her-
riot ’5 Dog Stories (St. Martin’s Press, New
York). This recent publication by the re-
nown storyteller would certainly keep me
occupied, entertained, and the two hours
would pass quickly.

Thus, I settled down with these wonder-
ful stories from England’s most famous
country veterinarian. I apparently be-

came oblivious to all other terminal activi-
ties until a muted barking sound, which
had apparently emanated from an adja-
cent waiting area, managed to transfer
my thoughts back into the world of con-
gested travel, long lines, and hurrying
people. Any time I detect a bark-
ing sound or hear evidence of an
animal’s presence — especially in
. an international airport — my en-
thusiasm and curiosity says “go-
find-it.” '

This I immediately did! Sitting
comfortably in a back row seat
was a well-dressed, handsome
young man, and directly in front of
him was a beautiful golden
retriever complete with guide harness,
etc. The young man is blind and, obvious-
ly, the well-disciplined dog is his eyes. I
have, over the years, witnessed hundreds
of similar situations as this and, each
time, a big lump forms in my throat and a
tear or two manages to cloud my eyes. My
emotional responses are not generated by
pity or sadness, but are associated with
joy and thankfulness as I observe this tre-
mendous display of love and loyalty which
is mutually shared by a human and com-
panion animal.

The young man was softly speaking to
his companion and, apparently, the dog
understood as they walked to the corridor.

I watched as they visited one of the
snack counters and purchased some can-
dy. They returned to the original area and,
throughout this trip, the golden retriever
gave the appearance of being docile, kind
and gentle; yet you could detect that this
beautiful animal also was a proud, well-
disciplined protector — totally committed
to the welfare of his master.

Once seated, it appeared that the dog
wanted to help in the consumption of the
chocolate covered peanuts. The man final-
ly weakened and shared a few pieces of
candy with his dog, followed by a verbal
stipulation of “no more.” As the man con-
tinued eating, the dog relaxed and didn’t
“beg” for more. He appeared satisfied.

., , . . . ~ ,- __ After awhile, I learned the man was

few things are as touching as the tremendous display of love and loyalty Off at the airport earlier- The friend would

shopping together and often had come to
the airport. Throughout our conversation,
Rusty watched me with curiosity and at-
tentiveness combined with a degree of
skepticism as if to say, “who is this char-
acter and what does he want?”

His sister’s ﬂight arrived and I watched
as she embraced her brother and then a
' big hug for Rusty. It was obvious that
Rusty is family, too. Bonded together in
mutual respect and love, the blind man
with his two beloved companions walked
down the long corridor leading to the bag-
gage claim.

I watched them for a long thne and,
once again, that little lump formed in my
throat and my eyes became misty. As I
stood there, my thoughts were directed to-
ward the thousands of dogs and cats I have
seen abused, homeless, abandoned, and

 

diseased. Most met a tragic death on the
highways or by starvation and / or disease.
The lucky ones were humanely euthanized
in an animal shelter. I realize they all
can’t be Rustys, but there are many who
have the ability and talent, but are never
given an opportunity to perform as a fam-
ily companion.

Give them a chance to become a part of
your family. Visit the animal shelters in
this area. I can assure you that there’s a
Rusty waiting to be your friend and loyal
companion — there are so many that need
your help a ﬂash er realize it er
not, you need them, also. As you walk up
and down the rows and aisles of kennels
looking for the “right” pet, don’t be sur-
prised if a little lump forms in your throat
and a few tears well up in your eyes. It
happens to many!

he Guide Dog Foundation forthe
Blind, Inc. of Smithtown, N.Y. is

celebrating its 40th anniversary.
This private non-profit, non-sectarian or-
ganization was established in 1946 for the
primary purpose of blind rehabilitation
through the use of guide dogs. A guide dog,
equipment. a formal 25-day z :iential
trainiz'sg anagram and a . .rensive af—
ter-care ‘3‘»le are all given, at no
charge. to deserving people who seek the
independence, mobility and companion-
ship that the animal provides. This ex-
traordinary program has graduated more
than 400 men and women who came from
diverse geographic areas, ethnic groups

and socio-economic levels. All of them
came to the Foundation with a common
purpose: to expand their horizons and
compete equitably with the sighted world
for education, career opportunities and an
improved quality of life, through the use of
a guide dog.

Different breeds are used for guide
dogs: golden retrievers, Labrador retriev-
ers, and German shepherds have proven to
be the most reliable breeds for this special
work. Although a large percent of the dogs
used are produced by the Foundation
breeding and puppy programs, an occa-
sional donated dog is accepted from the
general public.

Each dog receives comprehensive train-
ing in both rural and urban areas. Guide
dogs must be able to tolerate loud city
noises and heavy pedestrian traffic as well
as cope with country walks, roads with no
sidewalks or curbs. The dogs also learn
procedures for elevators, steps, revolving
doors, turnstiles and shopping. The Foun-
dation emphatically stresses that NOT ev-
ery blind person can use a guide dog. An
applicant’s aptitude and abilities, not his
disability, will determine part of his quali-
fications.

The training involves more than an av-
erage amount of exercise; therefore, an
applicant must be in good physical health.
He must be totally blind or have serious vi~
sual limitations and need the dog for con-
structive purposes. This includes the stu-
dent who attends school, the housewife
who shaps for the family, the person who is
in a rehabilitation program, and the wage
earner who travels to and from work. The
applicant must also be able to provide ade-
quate housing and care for the dog. There »
is a minimum age requirement of 16 years,
but no maximum limit.

The Guide Dog Foundation for, the
Blind, Inc. is not affiliated with any other
organization. It is supported entirely by
voluntary public contributions and neither
solicits nor receives government aid. The
officers and board members serve volun-
tarily and without compensation. Although
providing better mobility for blind people
is the Foundation’s primary objective, it
aims to contribute to the rehabilitation
progress of these able citizens so that they
will gain social integration in the commu-
nity and increased opportunities for better
self-sufficiency.

These services as provided by the Foun-
dation are available to blind men and
women because of the generous public sup-
port.

Zoos reaping rewards from ra-refeline breeding oompound

Dedicated to the preserva-
tion and reproduction of en-
dangered purebred cats, the
compound is one of only two
[private breeding facilities of its
kind in the nation. The other is
en the East Coast. Major zoos
throughout the country ship
their cats here in the hope that
they will end up getting more
cats back.

New housed at the 683cm
compound are four Temmin-
ick’s golden cats from Nepal,
two snow leopards from the
Himalayas, six Siberian tigers,
a Bengal tiger, two African
leopards, four Northern Chi-
nese leopards, four Canadian
cougars, three California cou-

cies.

° Joe Maynard and his wife,
Jeanne, started the non-profit,
tax-exempt breeding facility in
1978 and opened it to the public as
a wildlife museum two years ago.

- Rarest of the rare at the com-
pound are the four Temminick’s
golden cats. Only nine are now in
captivity, according to the Interna-
tional Species Inventory System
based at the Minnesota State Zoo in
Apple Valley, Minn. ,

1 Zoos that now have cats here to
be bred are Oklahoma City; San
Diego; Memphis, Tenn; Omaha,
Neb.; Dallas; and Toronto. Other
zoos ship rare cats to the compound
from time to time. The animals are
sent here to breed with cats from
other zoos or with cats owned by
the compound. The care, housing
and feeding of the animals are
provided by the compound. In
return, the compound splits the
litter with the zoo and has the rare
Cats on hand for research and
exhibition.

‘ Some members of the Exotic
Feline Breeding Compound, which
has 1,000 members who pay a
minimum of $15 a year in dues,
help pay for the upkeep by adopting
an animal, contributing $40 to $100
amonth.

? Zoos are attracted to the com-
pound because of the tendency of
Some animals not to breed in
captivity. Many cats are affected by
the interruptions in mating pat
terns caused by the urban locations
of the zoos and the great number of
people visiting them. The animals
seem to breed better at the Rosa-
mond facility because of its isola-
tion and the relatively few visitors.

‘ T'Succeesful breeding of the cats is

 

 

no simple task. A research team
from the National Zoo in Washing-
ton, which spent several days last
year collecting and testing semen
from all of the adult male cats at
the compound, discovered that
male fertility levels vary with the
season of the year, just as female
heat cycles vary.

To strengthen the bloodlines of
the endangered cats and to avoid
inbreeding, as can easily happen
with zoo stock, ofﬁcials look at the
breeding history of particular ani-
mals by consulting the Interna-
tional Species Inventory System
about the species, and then select
mates from the computer at the
Minnesota zoo. More than 65,000
animals from 15 countries are
included in the inventory, said
Nate Fleshness, program director
for the system.

Dr. Freeland Dunker, 32, an
Escondido, Calif., veterinarian, one
of several veterinarians and medi-
cal doctors who provide medical
services to the rare cats, said the
breeding record of the compound is
testimony to the success of the
facility.

The Exotic Feline Breeding Com-
pound “is highly respected by
major zoos as a research and
breeding place for endangered spe-
cies,” Dunker said. “Blood samples
from these cats are being used by
ISIS (International Species Inven-
tory System) to establish norms in
blood chemistry and hematology
studies of the various species.”

Lori Trahan, 26, a Lancaster,
Calif., dental technician is one of 11
volunteers -- all women — at the
cat compound who serve as guides
and help care for the animas.
'hahan has devoted 25 hours a
week here for two years "because I
love being around these animals.”

Veterinarian Don Gillespie reg-
ularly drives 140 miles from Santa

Barbara, Calif, to check the health
of the cats. When Tedi Bear, a
3—year-old female Siberian tiger
came down with a bacterial infec-
tion, Gillespie transfused a gallon
of blood from Caesar to Tedi Bear to
save the tigress’ life. Caesar and
Tedi Bear are from the same litter.

For two days, volunteers held
Tedi Bear’s head in their laps while
bottles of IV fluids dripped into her
system. Tedi Bear recovered.

Dr. Richard Deeley, a Lancaster
dentist, has done root canals on a
Northern Chinese leopard, a
clouded leopard and a Temminick‘s
golden cat.

In addition to the volunteers,
support for the cat compound
comes from the dues of the mem-
bers of the organization. Last year,
the compound’s expenditures came
to $110,000, but the costs would
have ballooned to $221,000, Joe
Maynard said, had the volunteer
labor not made up the difference.
Maynard is president of the organi-
zation, and his wife serves as vice
president. Both are on the seven-
member board of directors of the
breeding facility.

Chen-Chi, a Northern Chinese
leOpard and one of 15 of his
subspecies in the United States, is
the most recent product of the
labors here. Chen-Chi, which is
Chinese for "great protector,” was
born here March 24. '

For now, Chen-Chi has the run of
the Maynard home and will con-
tinue to be a house pet for the next
several weeks. It is hoped that
Chen-Chi eventually will breed
with Su Lin, a 1-year-old female
Northern Chinese leopard at the
compound.

Two adult cats run free at the
compound but never venture any.
where near the rare-cat cages.

No wonder. They’re a couple of
smart Siamese cats.

 




I once knew a woman who
had a pet tortoise named
Fluffy, and I think of this as I
listen to experts consider the
plight of the desert tortoise.
The experts have gathered
from the universities, from
the Bureau of Land Manage-
ment, from the fish and game
departments, from all the
small offices with gray desks
and steady checks.

The desert tortoise itself
(Gopherus agassizii) has
skipped this occasion. In the
bright lights and big cities of
the Sun Belt, this small rep-
tile is no big deal. They are
being wiped out in the des-
ert, and in cities survive
mainly as pets and captives
(at least 20,000 in California,
and thousands in Tucson
and Phoenix). Once upon a
time they averaged from 10
or 20 up to several hundred
per square mile. But this is a
new time and a new West.

I thumb through the 838-
page draft report being con-
sidered by the Desert Tor-
toise Council. I discover that
Gopherus agassz’zii runs 6 to
14 inches and hardly pesters
anyone. They endure their
slow lives for 50 to 100 years.
I am brieﬂy bewitched by the
notion that somewhere out
there lumber Methuselah
tortoises that have seen the
whole Western movie, all
three reels, from Wyatt Earp
to Palm Springs.

The tortoise looks to be a
perfect foil for a quick hit:
They are the innocents, the
benign nothings who do not
attack cattle, sheep or hikers,
the little rascals who pack no
venom. Scientists tag them as
an indicator species, one that
suggests the health of the
ecosystem as a whole. Al-
most stationary in their hab-

Everything 21 Desert Tortoise Is—Calm, a Homebody,
Long-Lived, Quiet—the People of the Southwest Are Not

its, long-lived and quiet, they
are witnesses to the way hu-
man beings in the Southwest
treat the land and forms of
life woven into the land.

Tortoises spend only three
to six months a year actively
feeding and moving, and
even during this frisky peri-
od they devote most of their
hours to snoozing. Tortoises
are homebodies and spend
their lives within a few hun-
dred yards of their burrows,
wandering off mainly for a
little dining, basking or love
making. Specimens tagged
during a study in the late ’305
and early ’40s were found in
the same area by scientists in
the ’80s.

The papers come one after
another, and they stand in
contrast to the sea of peace
that constitutes normal tor-
toise life. People, it seems,
have been wreaking havoc
on tortoises for a long time

6 LOSANGELES TIMES MAGAZINE, AUGUST 10, 1986

(they were sold as dog food
in Los Angeles during the
18905). We shoot them for
the hell of it, drive over them
with cars, collapse their bur-
rows with off-road vehicles,
stomp them to death with
our livestock and starve them
to death by running cattle

and sheep on their range—

beasts that devour the forage
tortoises crave.

Until the 19705, nobody
much cared. Then came all
those federal laws about en-
dangered species and all
those new agency mandates
demanding environmental
impact statements. I take a
closer look at the faces in the
meeting room and realize I
am sitting with the new ser~
vants of the tortoise: Hacks

from the BLM who suddenly

must kowtow to a damn rep-
tile; biologists from fish and
game departments who
thought they would spend

their days keeping tab on an-
telopes and bighorns, who
now are here fat with statis-
tics about tortoises and man-
agement plans for them.

I have heartily supported
every law, executive order
and petition to salvage the
dwindling biological wealth
of the earth. But now, in this
room, I see what happens to
every decent impulse in my
society: It becomes part of
that ugly thing, government.

The cities and towns of the
Southwest are ugly, the pop
ulace footloose, the crime
frequent, the marriages di-
sasters, the air electric with
promise. There is so much
space that no one can for a
single moment doubt the
basic American dream that it
is possible to make some-
thing worthwhile of life. Ev-
erything a desert tortoise
is—calm, a homebody, long-
lived, patient, quiet—the
people of the Southwest are
not. We don’t stay in our bur-
rows or limit our motion to
the cycle of the sun.

Just across the road from
where we are meeting,
huge power plant belches
smoke into the sky. The facil-
ity burns coal mined in the
Navajo and Hopi country of
northern Arizona; the elec-
tricity generated is then
ﬂashed outward to blaze in
the lights of Southern Cali-
fornia. Such grids of energy
are the stuff of life in the
Southwest, and they do not
produce a state of mind that
cottons to the issue of endan-
gered species. C!

A Whale Watching

great white shark being
what it is, a low-grade panic
is the scuba diver’s constant
companion. When I’m div-
ing, I am constantly on
watch: I can never quite for-
get that divers resemble
seals, among the favorite
hors d’oeuvres of empty-
eyed marine predators such
as sharks and killer whales.
One morning, at a favorite
diving spot just north of San-
ta Barbara, I was standing on
the bottom checking out Na-
ples Reef, a rocky formation
teeming with ﬁsh that lies 50
feet under the Santa Barbara
Channel. I was greatly enjoy-
ing the abundant marine life
despite my strong awareness
of both sharks and my watch
(below 33 feet, the bends
becomes a danger if a diver
stays down too long). Sud-
denly, sure something was
behind me, I turned to look.
And almost swallowed my
regulator. Right there was a
huge, dark-brown eye, and
behind it was a 40-foot
whale. My heart thudding, I
retreated a few feet, nearly
certain that gray whales don’t
eat seals, that they are filter
feeders and strain plankton
and such through their teeth.
A curious calm replaced the

One difference between

wasn’t deep enough for ni-

overwhelming sense that this
gray whale was not a some-
thing; it was a someone. It
wasn’t staring; it was watch-

large, dark eye mounted in
the side of the head was a
porthole and someone was
sitting behind it. Like the
driver, maybe.

What I felt coming from
that gray whale was an over-

and I stayed. We remained
this way, taking each other’s
measure, for some time. After
a minute, I reached for it. It
backed away a bit, just out
of reach, but it stayed. It
watched; it noticed; it per-
ceived; it considered. I
tried to do the same, but it
was too big and too close—I
couldn’t see very much of it.

The whale ﬂoated serene-
ly and patiently, while I, with
my limited View, began to
grow impatient, bored. I was
also aware that my bottom
time and my air were run-
ning short. I had decided
that the whale had no desire
to filter me, but I was afraid
that as it swam away it would
swat me with that 747 tail
and bounce me over Naples
Reef. So I waited uneasily
while the whale just ﬂoated
there, that huge, dark eye
somber and unblinking.
Watching.

After four or five minutes,
it ﬂapped its great tail and,
bending like a freight train,
circled me, that melancholy
eye coming very close. I

Fido’s r'de ' t k
By Steve Elliott '
The Phoenix Gazette
Valley veterinarians agree that letting a dog ride in a
truck bed is hazardous, but unfortunately, they say,
most owners don’t. realize the dangers until Fido takes
a life-threatening tumble.

. “If you’re lucky, you get away with it. If you’re not,
we see you,” said Dr. Irv Ingram, president ,of the
Arizona Veterinary Medical Association. “There is no
questioning the potential dangers.” ‘ ‘ ‘
“You see tons of people with dogs in the backs of

their trucks,” said Dr. Beverly Scott, president of the
Central Arizona branch of the AVMA. “We see the

. disasters. ~A lot of times there’s not enough left of the '

dog to put back together.” -‘

' Each year, the veterinarians said, many dogs die or

are injured as a result of falling or jumping from truck

beds -- a tragedy they said easily can be avoided.

“Do the humane thing — leave the dog at home,”
said Sue Wilkerson, administrator of Emergency
, Animal Clinic Ltd. in north central Phoenix.

, ' Wilkerson said her clinic treats 20 to 40 dogs a year
injured by falls or jumps out of truck beds. Fifty
percent must be put to sleep. . -

“It’s really ugly,” Wilkerson said.

Multiple brOken bones and internal injuries are the

norm. .

For the 50 percent that survive, recovery is often a

" long and painful process. ’

“You can’t keep them in bed for months like a“.

be d 's d
human,” Scott said. ' '

Besides treating the injuries from falls and jumps,
the veterinarians reported dogs in backs of trucks
blinded by ﬂying objects, burned in the paws by the
searing-hot metal in the truck bed, killed by sunstroke
and left with bleeding lungs from the volatile mixing of
gas fumes, heat and asphalt vapor.

For an owner’s pocketbook, treatment and recovery
also can be painful. .

“If an animal falls out the back of a truck, you’re
looking at a minimum cost of $100,” said Dean Kite of
Emergency AASHNE Veterinary Clinic in Mesa.

The veterinarians placed the maximum ﬁgure for
treatment at more than $1,000. ‘ ' ‘

The veterinarians agreed the most gruesome injury is
“road burn,” when a dog’s skin is scraped away as the
dog slides on the pavement.

“Many times, a lot of the dog you’re trying to put
be? together is left back at the accident site,” Scott
sax . _ ‘ ,

One veterinarian reported cuts so deep that he had
to remove asphalt from a dog’s leg bone.

. If the dog survives the fall, other hazards await. _

“Nine out of 10 times, the dog is run over by a car
driving behind the truck,” Wilkerson said. .

Many drivers secure their dogs in the truck bed with

rope or chain, but even this is no guarantee of safety,

the veterinarians said. ' Z
See .0093, Page 8 -

- — - .

 

 

 




Each of the veterinarians related '
stories of “secured” dogs jumping
from trucks and being dragged
blocks before owners were aware of

it. .
With shorter ropes or chains, -

animals have died by hanging.

Jeff Reid, a spokesman for the
Arizona Humane Society, added
that human lives also are at stake as
cars swerve to avoid the animal in
the road.

Although the best way to avoid‘
an accident is to leave a dog at
home, Reid said, carpeting the
truck bed can reduce the chance of
a fall.

Last month, San Diego County
became the 10th California county
to pass legislation requiring d s in

cover, cage, harness or other device.

Dear Connie:

Thank you for writing to express your support for HR 4871, The Pet
Protection Act of 1986. I appreciate knowing your views.

Like you, I am concerned with the use of animals from animal pounds
and shelters for animal research. While I support legitimate research
on animals as a means to provide necessary information for human
health, and to reduce potential pain and suffering on humanity, there
are indications that research on animals taken from an animal shelter
for certain research projects, is unnecessary.

I am Opposed to unnecessary research on animals, whether the animals
come from animal shelters or from any other source. I believe the
overriding principle we should use in assessing the validity of
research and in the research subject selection, is the value the
potential information will be to human health.

As you may know, the Pet Protection Act of 1986 is currently in the
Subcommittee on Health under the Committee on Energy and Commerce.
Because the bill has raised questions which have not been answered, I
will withhold judgment and cosponsorship until the bill has undergone
the necessary hearings, and the full ramifications can be determined.

Again, thank you for letting me know your views. Your continued
correspondence is most appreciated. If I may be of further
assistance, please let me know.

With warmest personal regards, I am

Sincefély,

HOUSTON POST - August 10, 1986

Hopes for baby pandas dim as couple

 

By PETER HARDIN
Media General Newspapers

 

WASHINGTON — At the National'

Zoo, 3 hand-printed letter from the
children of Ms. Teitelbaum’s kinder-
garten class in Shaker Heights, Ohio,
asks. this question: “Did the pandas
have a baby yet?”

Their poster-size letter is displayed
beside two air-conditioned pens that
house giant pandas Ling-Ling and
Hsing-Hsing.

It’s a ready reminder of national in-
terest in the celebrity creatures’ sex
life.

Unfortunately, recent events at the
’Panda House suggest the children of
Shaker Heights will have to wait still
longer. There will be no h00p1a about
pregnancy “watches” this year and less
of the news media hype about one of
Washington’s best-known couples.

The ever—popular pandas are on the
eve of their golden years - a scientist
calls it “post-middle age” —— and they
may be slowing down a bit. ‘

For the first year since 1983, the ro—
ly-poly pair didn’t mate. During the
once-yearly period of heat for the fe-
male, Ling-Ling, they tried in late May
but failed.

“They looked as though they’d never
mated before,” said Devra Kleiman,
assistant zoo director for research. “We
were just sitting there shaking our
heads. We couldn’t believe it.”

Scientists don’t know enough about
panda reproduction to pinpoint the
problem.

Ling-Ling’s shorter heat — which

lasted just more than a day — could

National Zoo stars Hsing-Hsing

and Ling-Ling are on the eve

have been caused by advancing age,
delay of her reproductive cycle last
year, hormones given her last year to
induce heat or a combination of fac-
tors, Dr. Kleiman said.

And Hsing-Hsing, the male, isn’t get-
ting any younger, either. Perhaps he
didn’t give off all of the necessary
chemical signals at male pandas
may produce to stimulate the female,
she suggested.

“Communication is a two-way street,
anyway. You can’t blame one or the
other, unless you have a clear case.”

Meanwhile, zoo officials aren’t aban-
doning hope for a successful preg-
nancy, even though a “biological clock”
is running for Ling-Ling.

“I think the only thing we can do is
just hang in there and see what hap-

pens,” Dr. Kleiman said.

She estimated Ling-Ling’s age at
about 16 and Hsing-Hsing’s around 15.
Officials in the pandas’ homeland of
China say the oldest panda female

known to have a reproductive cycle

was 20.

The failure was the latest disappoint-
ment for fans eagerly awaiting arrival
of the first healthy cub in this country.
Washington’s pandas, a gift from China
in 1972, are the only ones in the United
States.

A cub died of pneumonia within
hours after delivery in 1983. Another

was stillborn in 1984.
' ‘ Last year, the pandas — generally

solitary animals —- frolicked and
romped in early spring mornings as
never before. They enjoyed a new, jun-
gle gym-like complex built by volun-
teer crews. Zoo officials harbored
great expectations for a pregnancy.

hits middle ae

Ling-Ling showed signs of pregnancy
after she was given hormones to induce
heat and had mated in late June and
early July. In December, the signs
turned out to be a false alarm. ‘

This year, relations before the mat-

ing season were frostiern .
There was little swatting. wrestling
or nipping. Dr. Kleiman now thinks the
pandas‘ heightened act1v1ty a year ago
was quite unusual for their age.
Overall. she’s pleased With research

gains made while observing the pan-
das. There are only about 1,000 left in
the world.

“We’ve certainly collected more
long-term, behavioral and hormonal in—
formation than any other place,” she

said.

As for panda cub prospects, “We
have a very open mind as to what these
pandas will do." she said. “They have
managed to do something different ev-
ery year.”

PEOPLE WEEKLY - August 18, 1986

SOME FOLKS MAY RAISE A STINK, BUT
NORTH CAROLINA’S NORMA JEAN IS A
NOT-SO-LITTLE PIGGY WHO STAYS HOME

Raymond Sattler was 6 years old
when he saw his first piglet and decid-
ed he wanted to be a pig farmer. “i got
sidetracked into neurosurgery,” says
the Lumberton, N.C. doctor, “but the
pig thing just stuck." That must explain
what happened two years ago, when
Sattler received a piglet for his 40th
birthday. Instead of raising the animal
for his table, he raised it in his home.
Norma Jean, a 640-lb. Duroc, frolics on
five acres of land, but she eats in the
house and sleeps in her own room.
“Pigs have a personality, but nobody
usually takes the time to know them,”
says Ray’s wife, Debbie, 29, a nurse.
The couple, who have no children, de—
scribe Norma Jean as a hygienic, basi-
cally happy hog who enjoys eating

 

Ray and Debbie usually lull Norma Jean to

saw-a

chocolate (especially Godiva), drinking
champagne (Korbel Natural), listening
to the music of flautist Jean-Pierre
Rampal and watching Ronald Reagan
on TV. “There’s something about his
voice that she likes,” says Ray.
But'there are drawbacks to having a
pet pig. The Sattlers, who have already
bought a larger car and moved to a
bigger house, can no longer eat at the
same table with Norma Jean. “She’s
so tall now,” says Ray, “and gets so
enthusiastic—snorting and drooling——
that the whole table moves.” Enter-
taining guests is also a problem, smce
Norma Jean tends to playfully knock
over visitors. “We make an effort ‘0
stand around,” says Ray, ”30 if she
charges, we can use body blocks and

 

Trodﬂosome Pig or E.B. White

throw her out of the way." And when
the Sattlers tossed Norma Jean a 400-
guest party last March, they were criti-
cized for spending thousands of dol-
lars on a pig.

Acknowledging that “some people
think we’re crazy,” Debbie defends the
pampering. “Pigs in general have a sad
life because, I believe, they know that
most of them are raised for food.”

“Having Norma Jean is totally ridicu-
lous,” admits Ray, “but it’s also joyful.
When i come home after a hard day
of operating, it’s comic relief to see
this enormous pig.” Whatever sacri-
fices they’ve made for her, adds Ray,
are minimal. “We even still eat pork in
the house,” he says. “We just don’t let
Norma Jean smell it on our breath." C]

l

t

to return to health

LITCHFIELD, Maine (AP) —— A
young deer hit by a sports car. A baby
woodchuck orphaned by a hunter. A
red fox with crippled legs. All found
refuge in Jean’s Jungle.

Jean’s Jungle —— named for Gene
and Jean Thompson — has been the

last hope for hundreds of creatureS'

that couldn’t survive in the wild.

The Thompsons run a wildlife hospi-
tal-boarding home at their own ex-
pense, preparing food, cleaning cages
and nursing ailing animals seven or
more hours. a day, every day of the
year.

In the eight years the retired couple
have been rehabilitating animals, they
have only taken time off once, for
their daughter’s Wedding, said Mrs.
Thompson as she strolled about the
menagerie in her yard.

SHE SAID her satisfaction comes
from bringing animals back to health.

“It’s a thrill to see them go,” said
Mrs. Thompson. “We cry a lot.”

Some refuse to leave when their
cages are first opened, but eventually
all of those that can survive go. “They
letigou know when they’re ready,” she
sa .

Some come back to visit. A red-
tailed hawk that recuperated from a
gunshot wound “did a flyover this

spring, about seven months after we

released him,” said Thompson.

But a few animals, like a three
legged deer that was rescued by a
woodsman and a fox whose legs were
probably bent by rickets, will likely
live out their days in captivity.

“If we know they won’t survive, we

won’t let them go,” Mrs. Thompson
said. But she and her husband do not
try to tame the animals, which are
brought to them by game wardens,
woodsmen, motorists and others.

NEITHER 0F the Thompsons is
formally trained as a‘ veterinarian, but
Thompson said he has learned how to
set bones, clean infections and repair
broken wings. .

“A lot of it is common sense,” said
his wife. “We’ve raised three children
and five foster children, so we know
something about babies.”

Jean’s Jungle got started when a
friend gave them a fawn to care for.

“We raised the first one and that
was it,” said Mrs. Thompson as she
prepared a “deer salad”. of chopped
squash, potatoes and cucumbers,
topped by a couple of apples. “We’ve
raised 15 fawns.”

She used to hunt, and still likes to

take target practice, but no longer

shoots anything living.

“I never knew what beautiful, intel-
ligent animals they are,” she said. “I
never knew one personally”

THE THOMPSONS spend about
$50 a week in feed, and also buy
chicken parts, liver, hamburger, dog

and cat food and fruits and vegetables

for their animals. The state contrib
utes road kills, which supply a small
portion of the animals’ food.

Maine’s Inland Fisheries and Wild-
life Department regulates the more
than 70 wildlife rehabilitation centers
in the state, requiring them to get
permits and to provide suitable. homes
and diet for the animals. ’ -

b y chicken plan -

EVERY year one and a

quarter million European
foxes are slaughtered to stop
the spread of rabies. It is an
effecive technique: over the
last decade, there have been

' at the most four deaths from
- the disease each year.

But killing foxes on this

avast scale disturbs environ-

mentalists and is extremely
expensive._ Worse. it cannot
keep up With the onslaught of

, the disease: rabies spreads a

bit further west in Europe
each year.

But as that spread ad-
vances dangerously. relief is
close with a new approach: a
safe vaccine that can be used
on foxes, to be spread by a
shower of chicken pieces.

A team led by Dr Jean
Blancou in the French Min-
istry of Agriculture started
work on the harmless cowpox
virus. Using genetic engineer-
ing techniques they added the
gene that makes the outer

 

skin of the rabies virus. This .

skin is harmless, but is the
part of the virus that gen-
erates antibodies.

In tests. this virus has been
effective, and Blancou’s team
now wants to test it in the
wild using chicken heads
inoculated with the vaccine
and scattered through the
woodlands as bait. They also
hope to be able to use the
vaccine on animals which
already have rabies. So far
there are no plans to extend
the treatment to humans.

There is a problem with
the chicken-head shower
plan. Foxes in the country-
side are scattered over wide
areas, and the vaccine would
be effective. But foxes in
urban areas, of which there
are many, are far more
concentrated. It would be
difficult to vaccinate. a high
enough proportion of them to

A stop the spread of the disease.

However, should the tech-

*‘——_

nique work, it couldvhave a
massive impact. Rabies is a
terrible disease which is
usually fatal to humans who
are bitten by infected ani-
mals, often stray dogs. The
rabid animals become “mad”
and rush around snapping
wildly.

In the developing coun-
tries. dogs are the most
common carriers. Fatalities
in Latin America, Africa and
Asia make up the bulk of the
15000 people a year who die
from the disease. But the
western world has its pockets
of rabies: in California. there
are caves ﬁlled with rabid

bats.

A break in the weather Sunday drew more than 20,000 people to the Zoo. The crowd was the largest of the year.

Crowds Tum Forest Park Into A Z00

 




By Deborah Peterson
Of the Post~Dispatch Staff

Bees weren’t the only things swarming at the St.
Louis 200 on Sunday, as balmy weather and the
new ape attraction drew throngs of people and
forced police to divert traffic from Forest Park.

Lou Immethun, manager of visitor services for
the Zoo, said Sunday’s crowd of more than 20,000
was the biggest of the year so far. He said an exact
head count of the number of visitors to the Zoo
would be unavailable until today.

He said the fine weather had brought out the

82 degrees at 1:15 pm.

Immethun said that by 11:30 am. both of the
Zoo’s parking lots ——- which have 1,800 spaces -—
were full. He said the lots were closed and then
periodically reopened as spaces emptied, and that
each of the spaces turned over at least three times
throughout the day.

Lt. Michael Beck said he had decided to divert
traffic from the park’s main arteries when he
drove into work about 2:30 pm. Beck is watch
commander at the Police Department’s Hampton
Avenue District headquarters, which oversees

entire park. I understand that from 10 in the
morning traffic had been backed up from Wells
Drive and Hampton south to (Interstate) 44.”

Wells Drive is the first street north of Highway
40 at Hampton Avenue.

Beck said it took about 20 minutes with the
diversions to clear up the traffic bottlenecks
around the park. He also said that not everyone
was pleased about not getting in.

“Some people were like, ‘l’ve been waiting two
hours to get into the park and I want to get into the
park,’ ” he said. “And we were telling them there

Forest Park.

crowds. The temperature hovered around 80 most .
“The Zoo was packed,” Beck said. “It was the

of the day. The high temperature for the day was just was no room.”

Beck said that he saw many out-of-
state license plates in the lines of cars
waiting to get into Forest Park, and
that many people chose to park some
distance away, then walked in.

Immethun said lines were long at
special Zoo attractions, such as the
Children’s Zoo, the new Jungle of the
Apes exhibit and the Zoo Train.

Special displays, such as the ele-
phant and the sea lion shows, were
sold out quickly.

Immethun said that despite the
long lines visitors remained in good
spirits. “.It was a real good family
crowd,” he said.

Beck said that he had driven down
Hampton on his way to work - at
2634 Hampton — and that the street
had been turned into a parking lot.

“I saw people in the traffic lanes
with the doors of their vehicles open
and they were just kind of sitting
there,” he said. ‘

Beck said he also talked with sev-
eral merchants along Hampton who
told him that cars had been “literally

— parked” on the busy thoroughfare all
day. ' '

That led Beck to order that traffic
be diverted from Forest Park. He
said officers blocked both exits on
Hampton off of Highway 40 and also
blocked Hampton at Oakland Avenue,
south of 40, and diverted traffic east
and west on Oakland. ,

He said police also closed Tamm
Avenue, which is the overpass west of
Hampton that ends just west of the
Zoo’s south entrance, and that offi-
cers forced drivers to make U-turns
at Wells and Hampton and then go
south on Hampton. He said that at the
north end of the park, police diverted '
traffic out of Forest Park along Wash-
ington Boulevard.

Surgery of James A. Wight, York-
shire veterinarian—aka. James
.Herriott, author and lamb fan.

Herriott:

'Of dogs
and dales

By Lisa Anderson
Chicago Tribune '

hirsk, England—It is the

I lambing season in Yorkshire,
a glorious time of year when
lambs with black faces and cotton-
ball bodies romp in the pale new
grass. An occasional snowstorm
may still whiten the broad, bald
tops of the highest hills, but it is
James Herriot’s favorite time of
year. It signals the arrival of spring.
It also signals the imminent arriv-
al of the tourist season, which is not
James Herriot’s favorite time of
year. Worse, he has inadvertently
brought it on himself. Strangers
were rare in this remote, pastoral
corner of northern England until
. Herriot put it on the map in 1972
with “All Creatures Great and

Small,” the first of five best sellers 1

recounting his experiences as a
country veterinarian.

Although ﬂattered, Herriot, whose
real name is James Alfred Wight, is
still mildly astonished that so many
would be so charmed by his tales of
treating ﬂatulent dogs, diagnosing
morose ewes and grappling with the
eccentricities of their taciturn York-
shire owners.

Well "over 20 million readers have
bought his books and, to Herrror, it
seems that most of them are hell--
bent on visiting him here. Sitting at
lunch in the Three Tuns Hotel, an
18th—Century inn overlooking the
square of this ancient market town,
Herriot is quick to laugh over the
celebrity he regards with horror and
amusement. Still a practicing vet at
69, he is slim and wiry with silver
hair and the squinty eyes and
weathered face of one who has
spent most of his life outdoors.

Although he used pseudonyms for
people and places in his books, his
passionate fans have been quick to
track him down.

“Literally thousands of them
come to the surgery,” he says With

disbelief. “I see them at 2:45 on.

Wednesdays and Fridays and rattle

my dog charity box at them,” he

says, grinning. “They’re very gener—
ous people. I make about 100
pounds a time,” he says, adding
that at least his celebrity does some
good in raising money for a nearby
dOg sanctuary. He is less amused by
the intrepid fans who track him to
his hOuse.

It’s not that he is ungrateful, it’s
just that Herriot doesn’t consider
himself a celebrity and barely thinks
of himself as an author. “Writing
has occupied such a teeny, tiny part
of my life, you see,” he says in his

'soft, Scots burr, pointing out that

he didn’t even start writing until he
was 50.
“When you think of it. I wrote all

. of my books when lwasha full-tim€_

. vet. I wrote all of them in front of

my TV set. I could thoroughly

, enjoy the teli; and bash away at
‘ the typewriter," he says porntedly,

as if trying to dispel any image of
himself as a tortured artist. “There
are far better books than mine sit-
tin in drawers somewhere,” he
ad 5, noting his own first book lan-
guished in publishers’ offices for
two years. ~ g - _

He is even more loathe to let the
world’s perception of him .as the
Albert Einstein of veterrnanans go
unchallenged. “Undoubtedly, 1 am
the best-known vet in the world.
But, as a vet, I’d say I was run-of-
the-mill. I made the grade,” he says
without apology. . -

None of this diminishes the one
talent thatgeven Herrmtcannot —

deny: the ability to touch readers
with his stories of pets and their
eccentric owners and to bring them
into the harshly beautiful world of
?the Yorkshire dales.

; About five hours northwest of
‘London, this is a region of deep

,1 griver valleys tucked between high

ihills, or “fells.” The land rises and
:falls suddenly, crazily folding in on
itself to produce narrow dales or

"yawning wide to expose vast,

moorlike stretches. The fabric of
Yorkshire is defined by an endless
parade of ancient dry—stone walls
that march” up and down the hills
and across the broad pasturelands
in whimsical, wavy lines. The dales
have been Herriot’s enduring pas—
sion since he arrived here from
Glasgow in 1937.

“I would say, it’s a feeling of
wildness. That’s the thing about

. Yorkshire,” he says. “Wherever

you are, up in those dales, you’re

* on the edge of the wild. I always

feel quite a thrill when I climb up

' on the tops, the little lonely tracts

where you see the little signposts

' that have been there for hundreds

of years.”

To hear him tell it, he was a
lucky man to practice veterinary
medicine when he did, and above

- all, where he did.

“I came in at the very beginning

_ when things were just starting to

become scientific,” he says of the
days when, as a young man, he

. joined the sweetly eccentric Famon

brothers, Siegfried and Tristan, in
the veterinary practice in Thirsk.

“Up until then, it [veterinary
practice was really steeped in

_ witchcra t. Farmers had been using

the same remedies for hundreds of
years. It was a revolution when the
antibiotics, sulfa drugs, steroids and
all these things came in.

“I went through the high noon of

" veterinary practice, when vets really

came into their own for, oh, 20
years, you might say. Farmers were
absolutely devoted to the vet and
thanked him for all he could do.
But now, the pendulum has swung
right back and the farmers are
doing it for themselves. Today,
they’ve all got their own syringes.
So I’ve watched it swing right
around from the beginning. when
they didn’t need us, to the middle, ‘
when they were desperately happy
to have us, to now, when largeeani-
mal practice is fading away.”
l-lerriot still practices out of the

same red-brick, vine—covered sur-
geryhe wrote about. Siegfried. now
in his mid-705, still practices there
as well, along with Herriot’s son,
Jimmy, and four other young vets.

“He leaps at the deor, he wants '

to go out, wants to go out. And
then, when he gets out, he won’t
go,” says Herriot, clearly delighted
with Bodie’s peculiarities. “So I
have to slink down the village with
him under my arm. That’s me, tak—,
ing my dog for a walk,” he says,
chuckling. “It’s awful.”

. At the moment, however, it
looks unlikely that Bodie or other
Herriot pets will have any more
books dedicated to them. The doc-
tor is still wielding his stethoscope,
but, for the time being, he has put
'down his pen. The upcoming dog
stories, like those in his charmingly
illustrated children’s books, such as
the recently published “Moses the
Kitten” and “A Christmas Day

A country veterinarian

'

 

 

 

Kitten” due out in October, are
not new stories, but drawn from
his earlier works.

“They are all true stories,” says
Herriot, who is particularly fond of »
the tale of the Christmas kitten,
which first appeared in his third
book, “All Things Wise and Won-
derful.” “It’s about a stray cat that
used to come into this woman’s
home for years—come in, have a
bowl of milk, and then shoot oil
again. One Christmas, it came in
with a kitten in its mouth. It laid
down the kitten and then died. It
had brought the kitten to the only
warm place it knew"

This tender little story :iight

Herriot followed his origina. plan
of a one-shot publishing career. '-

 

“I wanted to write one book and
get this out of my. system. Once I
had written one, I Just went on and
on, until I got fed up. l’m fed up
now.” He says this quietly, then
smiles and tries to explain. “For a

ambition, apart from the childrens’ .. 7. 7
books, to do anything else. Not at A worn stone step I _

He shudders at the thought .of ~ 7, 7 .
another “book tour” and avords in-
terviews. Indeed, he granted this in—
terview with The Tribune only for
old time’s sake, out of a lasting
gratitude to Alfred Ames, a former
Tribune editorial writer and book
reviewer, whose glowmg, Novem—
ber, 1972, review in Book World of
“All Creatures Great and Small,”

Herriot says, is “what started me‘

off in the USA.”

He is not being modest. Al-
though he had published two slim
books in England—with the rather
limp titles, “If Only They Could
Talk,” and “It Shouldn’t Happen,

to a Vet”-——Herriot was far from a

household name in the United

Kingdom when Thomas McCor-~

mack, president of‘New York’s St. , -‘ ~ .-

ﬁchanted by the world Herriot de-
scribed, McCormack combined the
itwo books in one volume, repack—
iaged it as “All Creatures Great and
Small,” and introduced it to Unit—
ed States. .

. Hardly anyone noticed it except
for Alfred Amcs, who was cap—
tivated. His review led off une—
‘quivoeably: “lf there is any justice,
l‘All Creatures Great and Small’
will become a classic of its kind.”
McCormack promptly ran the en-
tire review as a. full~page ad in the
.New York \Times and sales of the
E book, which had already blossomed
E in the Midwest, began to sweep the
' country and, eventually, the world.
iTo date, St. Martin’s Press alone
1‘ has sold over 20 million copies of
Herriot’s books, not to mention
millions of others sold by publish»
ers around the world. The TV se~
ries based on his books has been
seen by additional millions.

“I’m in the last lap—not to be
gloomy—but when you’re in your
70th year, I feel you should start
doing all the; things you want. One
of the things I want to do is spend

 

more time with my grandchildren,”
he says firmly.

And that’s not all. He wants to
be. out .walking in the clear York-
shire 'air, working in his garden,
spending weekends in Scotland or
at his little Yorkshire country cot-

{to root for his avorite Scottish

'9 With his two children, Jimmy and

' He doesn’t want to escape to the

doesn’t want a Rolls-Royce [“l’m
afraid if you took a Rolls-Royce to
the football matches, the lads
would get their knives out.”].

He wants to stay in Yorkshire.
As he says and has written so
often, “I was captivated by it, com—

pletely spellbound and I still am to
this day.”

The beginning of life is a shell game
for the ostrich, the world’s largest
bird — as this young feathered fel-
low found out when he hatched at
the Oklahoma City Zoo. Shortly be-
fore the big event, Laura Bottaro of
the 200’s bird department used a
powerful light to make sure the
baby bird inside the huge egg was
doing well (right). In a series of
photos, snapped over an eight-hour
period, the young redneck ostrich
chipped his way to the outside
world. A week later, the comical-
looking bird already stood a foot
tall. He’ll grow to be more than a
towering nine feet.

This is in response to your recent letter to Burl Osborne
concerning the bull named "Texas." -

Apparently you missed the followup stories on the news and other
places that the animal died of the injuries. There was rather
extensive coverage of the event and I am sorry that you missed
it. It was not a happy ending and particularly unfortunate
considering the possibility that this bull could have sired
others with the same unusual markings.

I hope this answers your questions.

Sincerely,/,

Baby Mac, a 20-
month-old. 675-
pound elephant,
attracted plenty of
attention last night
as the Deni/er Zoo
observed its 90th
birthday. Cynthia

20,000 elp Denver Zoo mark its 90th birthday

 

Rocky Mountain News Staff

 

An estimated 20,000 peOple, most of
them children escorted by their parents,
turned up at the Denver Zoo last night for a
4-hour celebration of its 90th birthday.

Sponsored by one of the 200’s corporate
supporters, CenterLink -— a non-profit net-
work of 90 Denver-area child-care centers
-——— admission was free. In turn, proceeds
from concession sales were donated to the
new Children’s Discovery Center being
planned by too officials.

Yesterday’s event, called “Family Festi-

val -— An Evening at the Zoo,” included-

appearances by Rep. Patricia Schroeder,
D-Colo., and Mayor Frederico Pena.

But it was Baby Mac, a 20-month-old,
675-pound elephant, who clearly attracted
the most attention.

Orphaned in Africa, Baby Mac has shown
steady progress under the direction of her
29-year-old trainer and owner, Allen
Campbell, in adjusting to his American
home. For $5 a snapshot, the 200’s official
90th anniversary mascot posed with young-
sters, at times raising his trunk in mock
charge at the camera.

“He’s very peeple-oriented,” said Camp-
bell.

Among Baby Mac’s most crowd-pleasing
talents were his ability to stand on two legs
upright, shake his ears like Dumbo, squeal
on command and “give five” by slapping
his trunk on the palm of his trainer’s out-
stretched hand.

“He has a masterful repertoire of
tricks," said zoo director ,Clayton Freiheit.
“When he came here, he was just down to a
handful. Now he does more than 30.”

Yesterday’s public birthday party at the

zoo was one of several such ceremor
this summer. A series of Tuesday evenin,
concerts at the zoo that began in June
features Denver-area groups. Upcoming
dates are Aug. 12 with the Queen City Jazz
Band and Aug. 26, when Cat’s Night Out
will perform.

Tickets for the concerts are $3 for Zoo-
logical Foundation members and $5 for
non-members.

SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE

By Jack Viets

The price San Franciscans
pay for animal control services
is among the highest in the
United States and Canada, re-
ports a nationwide survey by a
San Francisco dog breeder.

Under its $1.4 million contract
with the nonprofit San Francisco
Society for the Prevention of Cruel-
ty to Animals, the city of San Fran-
cisco, with about 716,000 people, is
paying about $1.98 per capita for
control services for an estimated an-
imal population of 19,000 to 22,000.

New York City, with a popula-
tion of 7.2 million, has a similar $2
million contract with its local SPCA
but pays only 28 cents per resident
for control services for an estimat-
ed 40,000 animals, said Peter Paul,
founder of the San Francisco Ani-
mal Control Management & Educa-
tion Society, an urban animal plan-
ning think tank.

Even at that figure, Paul added,
the New York City Health Depart-
ment recently informed Mayor Ed-
ward Koch, “It would be cheaper to
have a limo pick up stray animals,
take them to the Hemsley Hotel,
and wine and dine them before put-
ting them to sleep.”

Paul‘s survey is “extremely bi-

ased, and not an honest picture of
the situation,” contended Rich

Avanzino, president of the San '

Francisco SPCA.

“You have to put quality of ser-
vice into the equation. It doesn't
compare apples to apples.”

By law, local SPCAs with city

animal control contracts in New

York and many other cities may
keep pet licensing fees, he said, and
this feature cuts down the actual
'cost of their contracts considerably.
But the San Francisco SPCA re-
funds nearly $100,000 in licensing
fees to the city's general fund each
year, he noted.

In Washington, DC, with
611,000 peOple, essentially the same

animal control services provided in '

San Francisco cost $693,113, or $1.05
per person, for an estimated animal
population of 16,000, Paul’s survey
showed. But the District of Colum-
bia “has an on-site administrator” to
oversee the contract, Paul said.

San Francisco animal control
costs are so high because there is
“poor oversight" of SPCA animal
control operations, Paul charged.

Avanzino is “so adept at public
relations,” Paul said, “that he has
convinced the city that fringes like
free pet food, animal adoptions and

 

- August 5, 1986

services for senior citizens are part
of animal control.”

The San Francisco SPCA’s ani-
mal adoption and outreach pro
grams are not paid for by the city
but by "charitable contributions
from people who care,” Avanzino
replied.

When the San Francisco
SPCA’s animal control budget is
compared with the animal control
budgets of all the cities of the Bay
Area, “we give more for the buck in
terms of service,” Avanzino said.

In the 198566 fiscal year, for
example, San Mateo County spent
$2.80 per resident for animal con-
trol, Contra Costa County $3.48 and
Marin County $4.77, headded.

Mono County spent $11.62, he
said, “and that shows the fallacy of
basing costs on p0pulation. Mono
County has a p0pulation of only
9500 in an area of 110,000 square
miles.”

Paul continues to insist that the
city‘s chief administrative officer
“send a man down to the San Fran-
cisco SPCA to check it out.”

“There’s virtually no account-
ability as to the quality of service,"
said Paul, an avowed critic of the
SPCA since he boarded one of his
prized Afghan hounds briefly at the

_ SPCA three years ago.

 




 

Southern Wildlife Is Threatened as the Drought Upsets Nature

 

By THOMAS J. KNUDSON
Special to The New York Times

CHATSWORTH, Ga. -- In a normal
year, acorns begin to fall here in late
October. But in this year of heat and
drought, many began to fall in July,
creating a situation that could hurt the
region’s wildlife.

“Many animals depend on seeds and

nuts to carry them through the wing

ter,” said Terry Kile, a wildlife super-
visor with the Georgia Department of
Natural Resources. “Without a good
fail seed crap, we could see mortalities
in some species.”

All across the South, the normally
predictable patterns of nature have
been upset by this year’s torrid tem-
peratures and lack of rain. Forest
plants are so withered that white-tailed
deer, normally shy woodland crea-
tures, browse boldly in open fields.
Swamps are so dry that alligators have
moved to moister areas, such as resi-

dential storm drains and sewer pipes.~

And coastal rivers are so brackish that
sharks, stingrays and other saltwater
species have been caught more than 15
miles inland.

The drought’s impact on the South’s
native plants, animals and fish has not
been fully determined. But just as do-.
mestic crops and livestock have suf-'
fered, so, too, have wild animals strug-
gled in the heat, according to experts.

Over all, officials said the long-term
impact should be limited because the
South’s native species, which have
withstood droughts for centuries, are
resilient in such calamities.

Eugene Odum, director emeritus of
the Institute of Ecology at the Univer-
sity of Georgia in Athens, said: “The
South has been through this kind of
thing before, hundreds of times over
history. People and farmers are suffer-
ing, but the drought is part of a natural
cycle. It’s an interesting experience.
We should observe it, study it and not
be uptight about it.”

If the drought continues, losses in
some species could be so significant
that hunters, fishermen and bird
watchers could notice a quieter coun-
tryside this fall, conservation officials
said.

Wetland bird populations have al-
ready dropped because their prime
feeding and nesting areas are drying
up. “Wood ducks have really been af-
fected,” said George Steele, a wildlife
biologist with the Georgia Department
of Natural Resources.

ew York 'l‘imes/ Jimmy Walker

An alligator in the Okefenokee Swamp in Georgia, where the water level is much lower than normal. The drought
has caused many alligators to move to moister areas, such as residential storm drains and sewer pipes.

 

 

“They nest in cavities off the ground,
usually near water,” he explained.
“But because of the drought, there’s no
water under their nests. So when the lit-
tle ducks emerge, they can’t escape the
predators.”

The lack of rain has affected the alli-
gator population as well. Typically, the
alligator nests in a boggy, inaccessible
area, but the drought has left such
areas more exposed than usual. “ Alli-
gator nests may be more subject to
predation by black bears and racoons,"

.Mr. Steele said. "

Alligators usually have a keen sense
for locating water, he said. “But some-
times they meet up with a barking dog
or traffic, and this confuses them and
they end up where they don’t want to
be, like somebody’s backyard.”

The bobwhite quail is also threatened
by the heat. “Quail begin hatching in
July,” Mr. Kile said. “But if it’s too hot
and dry, the ability of the eggs to hatch

 

is affected. I’m afraid there could be an
impact on their reproduction. Our
hunters may not have nearly as many
quail around to hunt this fall.”

Food Supply Is J eopardized

Mr. Kile said the drought might re-
duce the yield of wild seeds and nuts
this fall, which could affect everything
from songbirds to squirrels to deer.
“As these animals prepare for the win-
ter, we may see some mortalities be-
cause they need these seeds to put on
fat,” Mr Kile said. “I would not say
there’ll be a large-scale impact, but
there could be. It depends on the win-
ter.”

Fishermen will have fewer fish to
catch in some areas. The temperature
of some mountain streams in northern
Georgia is so high, and water levels so
low, that trout stocking programs have
been delayed, said Mike Gennings, su-
pervisor of the fisheries section of the

 

Department of Natural Resources.

Farm ponds, especially those in
smaller watersheds, are drying up
across the South and fish such as large-
mouth bass are dying. “It looks like
there’s going to be a lot of stocking to
be done in farm ponds,” said Mr. Gen-
nings.

Fishermen on Georgia’s Altamaha
River face a different kind of problem.
While angling for fresh-water species
such as catfish or large-mouth bass,
they have inadvertently hooked sharks.

‘Biggest Fish in the World’

“They’re pretty surprised -— they
think they’ve got the biggest fish in the
world for a while,” said Bill Croft, co-
owner of the Two-Way Fish Camp in
Brunswick.

Even the mosquito is dying as the
fierce sun dries up the puddles and
ponds where its larvae hatch and de-
velop.

Kile. “But now you can go outside in

hornets, yellow jackets and honey

“Normally, there are mosquitoes all ‘
over at this time of .year,” said Mr.

the evening and not be harassed.”
But the drought is bringing other

stinging insects out in droves. “People

are being exposed to a lot more wasps,

bees,” said Jim Harron, an entomolo-
gist with the Georgia Department of
Agriculture. .

‘ ‘Their natural sources of water have
dried up,” Mr. Harran said. “And they
are showing up around backyard pools,
drinking fountains, anywhere there is
water. And they seem to be a little
more aggresive than normal. We’re
seeing an increasing number . of
stings.”

And other species are actually thriv—
ing in the heat. “This weather is going

 

to help our mourning doves,” Mr. Kile

said. “Doves make a very poor nest, so
their main mortality factor is rain and
high wind ” -

the kitchen mixing one of the most unsa-
vory concoctions imaginable.

She takes strawberries, cantaloupe and
cottage cheese, mushes it together with a
can of beef flavored dog food, and places it

the task of saving them.

The 43year-old Seidman is a kindergar-

could just as well be saving mountain lions
or eagles. But while other volunteers at
Walnut Creek’s Alexander Lindsay Jr. Mu-

one is standing in line for turtles.

turtles. On a scale of one to 10, they’re a 12,”
Seidman says. “They’re not romantic. They

locking Horns

What a grand and timely story on the
crisis facing America’s national parks (so-

; CIETY, July 28). As head of an organization
that has "locked horns” repeatedly with

the National Park Service over its ante-

diluvian policy of "natural regulation”

[management taking a completely hands-

oﬂ‘ position] of the buffalo, I commend your
handling of the subject.

CLEVELAND AMORY

President, The Fund for Animals

New York, N. Y.

You state that my amendment blocked
the National Park Service from establish-
ing new grizzly populations in the parks. It
did not. What it in fact said was that a
grizzly-bear recovery plan couldn’t be
funded unless the public had a chance to

_ review and comment on the plan. There’s

no question that the grizzly bear must be
preserved. However, there has to be a bal-
anced land-management plan that re-
spects the rights of all people who use our
public lands, particularly in those towns
that are next door to grizzly habitat.
SEN. JAMES A. MCCLURE, Chairman
Subcommittee on the Department
of the Interior and Related Agencies
Washington, DC.

NEWSWEEK is right on target—debates
over national-park management have
been raging since the establishment of Yel-
lowstone. Today the reckless leasing of N a-

; tional Forest lands around Yellowstone for

oil and gas development is the gravest dan-
ger of all to the grizzly bear and other
wildlife in Yellowstone. Reform of the na-

tion’s oil- and gas-leasing laws is urgently
needed to protect our national parks from
becoming isolated fortresses of wildlife, un-
der hostile siege, doomed to fall one by one.
PHILIP M. Hocxmt

Yellowstone Chairman, Sierra Club
Jackson Hole, Wyo.

I suspect Theodore Roosevelt would
know how to handle our national-parks
crisis—more grizzlies, fewer bureaucrats
and a federal policy in which preservation
is placed above exhibition. There is little
doubt that he would rather be visited by
one of the courageous bears than by a tour-
ist who sues the government following a
wildlife run-in.

United Press International ,

linked to five car accidents involv-

; ._ ing gawking passers-by, police say.

_ . The determined bird, who has
i .1. refused to leave the area surround-
’ ing well-traveled Route 100, has
avoided capture. The most recent
hunt involved 10 people with a
turkey net, but they could not catch

the feisty fowl.

“He’s kind of dumb and kind of
smart,” game warden Eric Nuse
said Friday. “We can get real close
to him sometimes, and then he just

runs away.”

Nuse described the turkey as “an
arrogant sort of bird living a
charmed life.”

Nuse said the turkey has an
_ affinity for crossing Route 100 or

standing by the roadside, and lately
the road has been backed up with
parked cars whose passengers are
enjoying the bird’s show.

Police say they’ve received at
least 30 calls asking that the bird he
removed.

_ Monastery, God sometimes has to wait for the monks
- to feed the dogs.

This monastery might be less known to the outside
world for its prayers than for the German shepherds it
. breeds, the other dogs it trains and its book on canine
obedience.

At dawn, before Brother Marc dons his black robe
for matins, even before he’s eaten his own breakfast, he
feeds a litter of 11 yelping puppies that will each

eventually sell for $500 and up.

- . Fifteen minutes later, at 6:30, the 17 bells in the
.main tower toll. Brother Marc begins the morning
prayers. Nine other monks, some wearing jeans under
their robes and sandals on their feet, sing, “Glory to
you, oh God.”

“We all love the shepherds,” Brother Marc said. “We
love to sing and we love the shepherds. That’s two
important parts of our lives here. It’s better than
working in a factory, or not having dogs and just raising
cows. 1 think shepherds are more fun than cows.”

Their book, “How To Be Your Dog’s Best Friend,” a-

training manual for dog owners, is in its 12th printing
and has sold more than 100,000 copies since it was
published in 1978 by Little, Brown and Co.

Each monk wrote a different chapter. They were

college philosophy and theology graduates who became .

dog experts by practice and experience.

“We made mistakes,” said the 43-year-old Brother
Marc. “We read veterinary books. We were raising
animals already. We learned on horses, cows, pigs and
sheep. We learned how to give injections of penicillin.
We learned how to diagnose.”

The monks, members of the Orthodox. Church in:
America, first tried to support. themselves farming 500
acres of rugged land surrounded by birch trees in the

bowl of four well—worn peaks just west of Vermont’s
Green Mountains.

“What did we know about farming?” Brother Marc
asked. “But there was nothing else to do in this part of
the country, so we started farming. From farming we
went to dogs because up here there’s no grasslands and
it just wasn’t working out.”

The monks’ first dog was a non-pedigree German
shepherd from a Seeing Eye kennel in New Jersey. The
monks named him Kyr. ‘

The monks lost Kyr when building their new.

monastery. He responded to “the call of the wild,” as
Brother Marc put it, and of several roaming female
dogs in heat.

“So we said, where do we get another dog? We didn’t
know anything about breeding (German shepherds).
We just knew about this one animal. So we began to
learn about. the whole professional organization of
German shepherd breeders in this country. Luckily we
got started with some of the best breeders in the

country.”

Although the monks sought only another dog for
companionship, they found themselves with a litter of

puppies.

“What are we going to do with these puppies?”
Brother Marc recalled asking himself. “We can’t raise
them all. We can’t afford just to give them away. We
have to pay for the dog and the vet bills.” -

Word got out that the monks had newborn puppiesgagg .
“Visitors come here and they say, ‘We love your dogs, _ '_ p.

 

“$5.:

.

We want. to buy,”’ said Brother Marc. “It’s a word of;
mouth that’s spread. . . . Now We’re so inundated, waft-2f“

don’t dare advertise.”

1,500 dogs of all breeds, Brother Marc estimated.

Since the mid-19705, the monks have trained at least;

nent. “No elephant is safe in Africa,” says
professional big-game hunter Robin Hurt
in Tanzania. "Now if there are any survi-
vors, they are cowering, frightened, in the
deepest forest.” Pessimists predict that
wild Africa will soon become little more
than a string of gloriﬁed safari parks as the
true Wilderness shrivels and the animals
die out. The process is already under way in
some of the continent’s most popular game—
viewing regions. “A few decades ago Africa
was a sea of wild animals surrounding a few
islands of humans,” says Hurt. “Today the
reverse is true.”

Poaching is one of the biggest threats—
and it has decimated Africa’s rhino popula-
tion. As late as 1970, a healthy population
of 65,000 was scattered throughout east,
central and southern Africa. Today 4,500
rhinos are left, living in tiny groups that
could die out unless they are immediately
protected. None remain in Uganda; 170

live in the Central African Re-
public and another 300 in Zam-
bia. The only major herd of
black rhinos in the world—the
several hundred in Zimbabwe’s
Zambezi valley—is struggling
against a similar fate.

Dagger handles: It is a cruel
trick of nature that rhinos are
easy targets for poachers. De-
spite a keen sense of smell, they
have poor eyesight, and many
are so docile that a poacher
adept at imitating animal
sounds can call a rhino to its
death. They are also creatures
of habit and must drink daily.
Often a poacher can stake out a
watering hole to ﬁnd ready
prey. The prize is the rhino’s
horn. Prices have soared from
$17 per pound wholesale in the
early 19705 to $300 per pound
in the main markets in North
Yemen, where rhino horn is
used to make dagger handles,
and in Asia, where it is used to
make traditional medicines.
The trade is illegal almost ev-
ery‘where, but the laws are
rarely enforced, and traders
continue to sell as much as the
poachers can provide.

Desperate to halt the rhino
slaughter, rangers in the Zam—
bezi valley shoot poachers on
sight. Since the controversial
policy began early last year,
rangers with the Department
of National Parks and Wildlife
have killed 13 poachers and

Indeed, the best hope for
preservation may be appealing
to proﬁt motives. One promis-
ing approach is game ranches.
In southern Africa, some 1,000
landowners who once raised
cattle or other herds have trans-
formed their property into pri-
vate wildlife preserves. Ranch-
ers raise money by opening
their premises to photographic
and hunting safaris and culling
some herds for meat and skins.
The results have been encour—
aging. In the parched bushland
of southeast Zimbabwe, Ed
Naude joined his land with that
of two neighbors last year
to form a 150,000-acre game
ranch, and the consortium

president of the Central Afri-
can Republic, when he visited
the region late last year. The
president ordered his elite unit
to patrol the national parks
from then on. But in some coun-
tries, poachers allegedly enjoy
protection at the highest levels
of government. Experts believe
that many wildlife services are
riddled with corruption. Some
allege that rangers and war-
dens often shoot the animals
themselves and that some park
oﬂicials and government min-
isters control the horn-and-
ivory trade for their own gain.

If avarice triggered the
current assault on the elephant
and rhino, sheer human expansion will de-
termine the ultimate fate of all the conti-
~ nent’s wildlife. The population of sub-Sa-
haran Africa is increasing at an annual
rate of more than 3 percent—the highest
rate in the world. By the year 2025 the
population will have tripled, to 1.6 billion
people. Governments generally have kept
the boundaries of national parks and re-
serves intact—and in some instances have
even extended them. But the inexorable
human tide is straining against these fron-
tiers, and wildlife will undoubtedly suffer
as millions of people move onto vast areas
of marginal land.

Conservationists still nurture hope for
preserving Africa’s animals, and they are
pressing for stronger measures. Many are
calling for a total ban on ivory trade, but
the commodity is too prized to make that a
realistic possibility. Instead, ivory-produc-

ing countries this year agreed to begin
monitoring shipments to curtail the illegal
trade. Each nation will submit a quota of
tusks for export based on estimates of live
herds; each tusk will be numbered and its
movements monitored worldwide. But suc-
cess will depend on the honesty of hundreds
of ofﬁcials—and in corruption-ridden Afri-
ca, that is an unlikely prospect.
Meanwhile, sanctuaries—fenced-in en-
closures that are meticulously moni-
tored—may save enough rhinos to allow
them to survive in small numbers. Kenya
has designated one sanctuary at Lake N a-
kuru for a government experiment; if suc-
cessful, the program will be expanded to
three other areas. But sanctuaries alone
will not be enough. ”We must. broaden our
horizons outside the parks—something
conservationists have been loath to do until
now,” says Jonah Western of the New York

the dollars to save it,” says con-
sortium co-owner Mark Spar-
row. "We must [funnel] that en-
thusiasm now into meaningful
economic channels.”

Permit fees: Big-game hunting
may also play a role in preserv-
ing some herds. Conscientious
hunters set. their sights on old
bull elephants and cape buffalo
only, sparing females and the
young for the perpetuation
of the species. Professional
hunters contend that their
presence actually deters poach-
ers. Hunting also generates rev—
" ‘ enue through permit and tro-
phy fees that, in the best of
worlds, should be reinvested in
the preservation of animals.
"One cannot be sentimental about wild-
life,” says hunter Hurt. "It must pay for
itself to survive.”

To some extent, it does—if only by keep-
ing the tourists coming. Last year Kenya
netted about $300 million from nearly a
half-million visitors, making it Ken ya's big-
gest foreign-exchange earner, ahead of
such traditional exports as tea and coffee.
As the continent’s wildlife population
diminishes, so too will its major tourist at-
traction. Impoverished African govern-
ments will ultimately decide the animals‘
fate on coldblooded calculations of cost
effectiveness, rather than moral, esthetic
or environmental considerations. If money
talks loudly enough, some of Africa‘s mag-
niﬁcent creatures will survive—but not be-
fore all too many have fallen.

Camera doesn’t stop gorillas
from helping to save species

 

By John Beifuss ‘
Staff Reporter

 

 

The romance of Carlos, the gorilla stud
from Memphis, and Hope, his intended
mate, is now in full swing — and on camera.

Les Schobert, general curator of the
North Carolina Zoo in Asheboro, said the
rare lowland gorillas have displayed “a
high degree of breeding activity.”

What’s more, a crew shooting a promo-
tional film for the zoo captured footage of
the gorillas breeding. ,

Schobert said the footage was not particu-
larly rare, but “it’s something you don’t see
on the educational channel every night, ei-
ther.”

The footage will not be included in the
park promotional film, but it will be studied
by zoologists with the Species Survival
Plan, an international program that coordi-
nates breeding for about 40 endangered
species. Carlos and Hope were matched un~
der the plan.

Schobert said 200 officials witnessed “ap-
parent copulation,” but it is not known

whether the breeding was successful.
“With gorillas, it’s difficult to tell.”

He added that Hope probably is a long
way from being a mother. “Breeding is not
the same as conception. It has to be thqabso-
lute right time for conception to occur.”

The most promising aspect of the appar-
ent mating, he said, is that the gorillas “feel
tomfortable enough in their environment
to go ahead and breed, even with the public
there. This is all very, very positive. We’re
certainly‘pleased at this point.”

He said the pairing of Carlos and Hope ex-
emplifies the “nice cooperation between
the Memphis Zoo and the North Carolina
Zoo and the Species Survival Plan.- What-
ever the outcome, we‘re doing this for the
betterment of the gorillas.” ,

Carlos, 16, sired two offspringat the Mem-
phis Zoo. The 450-pound Romeo is on loan to
North Carolina until he fathers two more
babies there.

He arrived in Asheboro in May, but
wasn’t allowed contact with Hope until late
June. The gorillas went on exhibit together
two weeks ago.

is often unimpaired. As a result,

THE TRENTON, NJ TIMES - August 10, 1986

Wildlife is on the rise

 

By JACQUELINE TENCZA

Staff Writer

 

Wildlife enthusiasts may be happy to learn
that the beaver and muskrat population‘along
the Delaware and Raritan Canal is rising, but the
little critters can mean trouble to the waterway.

Muskrats burrow underwater into the side of
the canal, weakening the banks. And beavers
gnaw at trees and shrubs, depositing the debris
across the canal and obstructing the water flow
with their dams, explained James Amon, execu-
tive director of the D&R Canal Commission.

Muskrats, which look much like rats, but are
larger and have longer, flatter tails, have become
common in even the most densely populated
portions of the canal, such as Trenton.

“I saw a muskrat in Princeton this morning,”
Amon said recently.

THE PROBLEM is that the tunnels these
rodents create weaken the canal banks, Amon

But muskrats, beavers

explained.

Four years ago, muskrats caused a break in
the canal when the bank in Franklin Township
caved in.

Amon speculates that the growing muskrat
population has resulted because coats made from
the furry critters’ pelts are no longer in vogue.

“Trapping is not that common anymore,”
Amon said.

He said that in the 19305, when a private
company owned the canal, “ratters,” who were
paid “by the ear,” were hired to trap muskrats.

The long, shiny hair of the muskrat is often
dyed to look like mink, seal or sable.

The canal director said he would not be upset
if area residents took up trapping to control the
muskrat population.

ALTHOUGH THE muskrat situation is an
old problem that has recently resurfaced, the

along D&R Cana

cause problems

presence of beaver is a new one to canal
commission staff.
“In May, we started seeing trees that were

’)

chewed down, Amon said, explaining the
beavers were working in an area north of
Stockton.

A number of river birches, pin oaks and ash
stumps had been chewed, and the state Water
Supply Authority maintenance staff had to
remove what looked like the beginnings of a
beaver dam across the canal, Amon said.

The dam would have obstructed water flow,
which is a water supply for some 750,000 people
in Central Jersey.

“It could slow the flow to the point of
affecting the water supply,” Amon said.

Since the darn foundation was cleared in May,
Amon said there has been no new evidence of the
beavers befouling the canal.

“But, I suspect that this won’t be the last time

we’ll see our buck-toothed friends,” Amon said.

BEAVERS PROBABLY were the most
hunted animal in North America from the 16005
through the 1800s, and were widely used for
trading, wildlife experts say. Laws were passed

today, beavers can only be hunted at certain
times of the year.

The increasing population of both beaver and
muskrat is not unusual, according to Richard
Winters, a staff biologist for the US. Department
of Agriculture. -

Neither animal has many natural predators,
with the exception of man, Winters said.
Trapping beavers and muskrats has dropped as
the furs have become less pOpular.

“It’s kind of a question of supply and
demand,” Winters said. .

Beavers have been a problem for years in
Arkansas and muskrats have been causing leaks
in dikes in wildlife refuges throughout the
country, Winters said.

Not So DumbAnimals

By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 

ADAM ’S TASK: Calling Animals by
Name. By Vicki Heame. 274 pages. Al-
fred A. Knopf. $17.95.

 

.3,

As kids, a lot of us grew up reading
such dog and horse stories “Lad, a
Dog,” “Black Beauty” and “The
Black Stallion"; and from the movies
and television, we were familiar, too,
with the stories of Lassie and Rin Tin
Tin. They were stories in which a
brave dog or horse helped rescue
someone in trouble, or stories in
which a troubled child and an endan-
gered animal saved and redeemed
one another. For Vicki Hearne, those
stories are not simply sentimental
tales concocted for children, but fic-
tions that reveal the possiblities of
communication between domestic
animals and man; and in this provoc-
ative new book, she expounds further
on the intricate moral relationship
that can develop between dogs, cats,
horses and human beings.

A poet and an assistant professor of
English at Yale University, Vicki
Hearne is also a professional animal
trainer, and “Adam’s Task” reflects
her fluency in these two disparate
worlds. Drawing upon Ms. Hearne’s
own experience, as well as a wide
variety of texts —- including works by
Wittgenstein, Freud, Nietzche and
technical animal trainer’s manuals
— the book emerges, at once, as an in-
formed defense of animals’ capacity
for understanding and commitment;
and a philosophical meditation on the
nature of learning, responsibility and
language.

As Ms. Hearne sees it, a well-
trained dog may possess a far more
limited vocabulary than human
beings, but his potential respect for
language is far greater - in fact, is
absolute in the sense that a command
from his handler will elicit a response
that is instantly “full, meaningful and
serious.” Proper obedience training,
she argues, develops a dog’s intellect
and social skills, and in doing so also
confers, on him, dignity and nobility

of character. Further, by facilitating

understanding between dog and man,
it nurtures mutual autonomy, trust,
reliance and a love that is based on
“shared commitments and collabora-
tion.”

a

In using decidedly anthropomor-
phic terms to talk about dogs and
horses, Ms. Hearne points out she is
using language that implies animals
are capable of moral understanding.
This is the same language employed
by animal trainers and the authors of
children’s books; and it stands in
sharp contrast to the coldly objective
language of behaviorists and people
who insist on referring to an animal
as “it” instead of “she” or “he."

When Ms. Heame, herself, relates

‘ a dog or horse story, the animals be-

come full-fledged characters, as
brightly delineated as people created
by Dickens or Twain. There is Clever
Hans, a famous horse who could an-
swer questions with alphabet blocks
by reading minute changes in his
owner’s facial expressions; a gallant
police dog named Rinnie, who unlike
his human handlers saw through a
con man’s elaborate deceptions; and
Halla, a high-strung horse who won a
Grand Prix jump even though a
pulled muscle left her rider virtually
incapacitated.

As for animals Ms. Heame has
trained herself, they are no less re-
markable as personalities. Take, for
instance, Belle, a beautiful and most
serious pit bull, who refuses to put up
with any sort of laziness on the part of
her owner. One day, Ms. Hearne
writes: “it turned out that three days
had gone by and I hadn’t worked
Belle on retrieving. l was lazing/
about, reading in bed, on the left side
of the bed. Belle brought me her
dumbbell and stared at me loudly.
(Bull Terriers can stare loudly with-
out making a sound.) I said, ‘Oh, not
now, Belle. In a few minutes.’ She im~
patiently dumped the dumbbell on top
of the book I was trying to read, put
her paws up on the edge of the bed and

, bit my hand, very precisely. She took

the trouble to bite my right hand,

 

‘ in

even though my left hung within easy
reach. She bit, that is, the hand with
which I throw the dumbbell when we
are working. A very gentle bite, I

' should say, but also just -— precise

and justified.”

In her insistence on rigor, it might
be noted, Belle is only taking after her
owner, for when it comes to training
her animals, Ms. Hearne appears to
be a tough taskmaster indeed. Obedi-
ence and discipline, she believes, go
hand in hand with respect; and re-
spect for a dog or horse’s intelligence
means stern authority, not mollycod-
dling, bribery or sweet talk. When a
dog insists on digging holes, for in-
stance, a harsh correction, combined
with some reverse psychology, is
called for: Ms. Hearne gets down on
her knees, eagerly participates in the

. digging, then fills the hole with water

and plunges the dog’s head inside.

0

As a writer, Ms. Hearne occasion-
ally diminishes the considerable
force of her arguments by overstating
an issue or stretching a metaphor be-
yond its bounds — atone point, she _
compares the risks horsemen are
willing to take to those taken by sol-
diers in war. She also lapses, from
time to time, into the convoluted syn-
tax and pretentious posturing associ-
ated with the most tiresome sort of
academics. One sentence, for in-
stance, reads: “But some horses (and
this, alas, is part of the talent in
them) are capable of responding to
the knowledge art creates of what it
feels like when there is complete con—

.gruence between the soul and the mo-

ment (that congruence Wittgenstein
indicated when, at the end of the
Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, he
says, ‘He who lives in the present
lives in eternity’) with a general anxi-
ety that work should continue.”

Such passages/——- which occur inter-
mittently throughout the book -—
ake reading “Adam’ s Task” a

‘ somewhat arduous process, and re-
ﬁled, as well, acertam lack of clarity

in thinking. All in all, though, Ms.
Hearne’s passion for her subject,
along with her eclectic intelligence
and technical expertise, succeedsin
making even the most skeptical
reader re-evaluate his relationship
with animals and his preconceptions
about communication. And in that
alone, “Adam’s Task” stands as a
most intriguing and original book.

ing. “Labradors are very stable and
adaptable. They’re short-coated,
easy to groom, and have few
medical problems compared to oth-
er breeds."

The future guide dog begins its
schooling at 6 weeks of age when
the puppy goes to a foster home.
Jane Brackman, a motion picture
producer who lives in Altadena, is a
volunteer for Guiding Eyes who is
currently raising a golden retriever
that she will return when it is 15
months old.

“The purpose of the foster home
is to give the future trainer a good
foundation to work with,” she said.
“We have 100 dogs in foster homes
right now, and we're always look-
ing for volunteers. We expect the
dog to return with basic house
manners and to have learned obe-
dience.

“The dog we're raising at home is

children to part with them.

as six months the curriculum will
continue. Walking along a street,
the dog learns to be observant in
four directions; up, down and to
each side. They’ll walk their owner

crack in the pavement, an over-
hanging rosebush. When crossing a
street, it the blind person signals

Screened for Suitability

At scheduled intervals, the new
owners arrive to accept their dogs,
generally in groups of 10. About 50
dogs and owners are matched each
year. All have been screened so
that the most suitable dog will be
given to them.

“You have to take into consider-
ation the age of the person re-
ceiving the dog,” said Hall, a staff
trainer. “A younger, more active
person would adapt better to a
German shepherd, as they move
more quickly. The Labradors and
goldens are quieter and more suita-
ble for an older person.”

During their stay, those receiv-
ing their new guides live in a
building that has all the comforts of

room with its own fenced-in yard

Rickards owns the Shaker Animal Clinic and the All
Animal Clinic, all four of whose doctors are FACT
volunteers. Over the years, Rickards said, 35 veterinar-
ians have contributed their services.

“There’s no doubt in my mind they appreciate it,” he
said of the pet owners. Each pet is given shots for
common diseases, a worming exam and a general
exam. The whole treatment takes about 10 minutes.

The pet owners are asked to show some proof of low
income, such as a welfare card. Rickards said he was
not concerned that some pe0ple may cheat by using
FACT even though they can afford a regular vet.

“It’s like running a soup kitchen,” he said. “If some-
one comes in from Gates Mills in their old clothes and
gets a bowl of soup, you can’t let that stOp you from
giving soup to the ones who really need it.”

Horses hit the feed bag
after court-OK’d rescue

By CAROLYN DAVIS
STAFF WRITER

Two thin, unkempt quarter horses
with hooves twice their normal size
were found yesterday after police and
Animal Protective League authorities
broke into an Olmsted Township
garage.

Authorities said the animals had
probably been kept in the cinderblock
and wood garage for several years
without prOper feeding, exercise or
veterinary care.

The horses were taken to the Tim-
berlane Stables on the Cuyahoga
County fairground in Berea where
they will remain while league officials
present evidence to a Berea Municipal
Court assistant prosecutor.

League officials said they would ask
that the animals’ owner, Gene Fene-
ley, be charged with cruelty to ani-
mals.

“She’s so skinny,” said Beverly
Sprowls , a tissue at her eyes, as she
watched a 5-year-old filly being led
onto a trailer. “She was beautiful
when we had her. I should have stayed
in the car.”

Sprowls and her husband, Gary,
were the previous owners of both
horses, protective league officials
said.

Feneley, 55, said the horses had
been well-cared for, and denied the
animals were mistreated.

“He’s wrong . . . they are not in poor
condition.” Feneley said, of Dr.
Robert Alexander’s assessment of the
animals’ condition. Alexander is presi-
dent of the league.

The Berea court issued a search
warrant Monday at the protective
league’s request.

Alexander said neighbors reported
last week they thought two horses and
chickens were being neglected and
kept in a garage with little ventila-
tion.

About 1:40 pm. yesterday, league
officials, two Olmsted Township
police. and employees from the stable

arrived at Feneley’s Bagley Rd.
house. When no one answered at the
house, the group went to the garage.

Officials found the horses standing
in two broken, wooden stalls piled
high with dirt and covered with straw.
The only window in the room was
boarded up except for a slit across the
bottom.

Chickens were running around the
building, which smelled heavily of
manure and of ammonia from the
chicken dr0ppings.

Alexander said the garage probably
had not been cleaned in about seven
months “to have that much buildup of
manure.”

League deputy animal warden
Sherry Bryson led the mare out of the

 

 

barn and toward the trailer. The mare
walked awkwardly on her hooves —-
which were elongated instead of
rounded, and were cracked and
covered with dirt.

“Their hooves are in deplorable
condition,” Alexander said. “They’re
actually walking on the side” of their
hooves.

When Stanley 0. Jackson, a profes-
sional horse trainer with the Timber-
lane Stables, led the filly out of the
barn, she became tangled in wire
lying on the ground. Jackson fell as
the horse ran wildly around him and
snarled him in her lead until he let go.

Jackson, 67, was not hurt. The horse
was caught a few minutes later.

Both horses were thin and had abra-
sions. Their leg bones and ribs showed ,3
through their skin. Their manes were '
shaggy, with one horse’s mane hang-
ing about six inches down its face.

Alexander estimated the filly
weighed about 1,000 poUnds and her
mother about 1,200 — some 200
pounds less than they each should
weigh.

At 2:15 pm, after the horses were
taken away, Feneley arrived. Alex-
ander explained what happened and
handed him the search warrant.

Gary Sprowls of Grafton said he
and his wife sold the horses to Feneley
about four years ago after meeting
him at the Shaker IGA Market, 27091
Bagley Rd, Olmsted Township, where
Sprowls works.

For the past two years. he said he
had not seen the horses outside as he
passed the house on his way to and
from work. _

NEW YORK TIMES — August 17, 1986

Seeking theFormula for Happy Hens

By HAROLD FABER

Are American chickens happy?
Would happier hens lay more eggs?
A team of avian scientists from Cor-
nell University .in Ithaca, N.Y., is
trying to ansWer those questions in an
effbrt to increase egg production and
improve the living conditions of the na-
tion’s hens, ' _
“It’s tough to find the answers be-
cause animals cannot talk to us,” said
Dr. Ari van Teinhoven, professor of
animal physiology at the State College
of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Cor-
nell. “How does one then ask an animal
whether it is happy?” '
Dr. Teinhoven and his ' colleagues
rely on experiment and observation.
They vary the number of hens in cages
and change the size and accessibility of
their feeding troughs. Their measure of
avian happiness is egg production.

Life in a Hen Factory

. The best egg-layers in the United.

States are White Leghorn hens, which
can‘ lay as many as 270 eggs a year.
Last year, New York State’s 279 million
hens laid a total of 68 billion eggs, ac-
cording to the State Crop Reporting
Service in Albany.

' Most New York chickens live in large
commercial hen factories where five

or six mg rows of cages filled with,

ﬁens are stacked one on top of another.

space each, never seein the li ht of
”flay or scratching in a gamyard.

Bathed in artificial light'that makes
them think the days are longer, the
hens eat from a common trough, with
food dispensed automatically. Their
wastes drop through the wire floors of
theircages. The cages tilt slightly so
that eggs roll forward to a rack or con-
veyor for automatic collection.

Previous studies have shown that
egg production drops with an increase
in the number of birds in a cage, ac-
cording to one of the Cornell scientists,
Dr. Danis L. Cunningham. The as-
sumption has been that the drop is
linked to an increase in social tension
and possibly to a rise in physiological
stress, he said.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Happy hens? Scientists at Cornell- are trying

 

The New York Times / Bob Mahoney
to determine the

optimum number of hens in a cage for maximum egg production.

 

Testing that assumption, the Cornell

scientists have found that when seven'

hens live together in one cage, the less
aggressive birds in the pecking order
produce fewer eggs than the more ag-
gressive ones, perhaps because they do
not get enough to eat.

“The relationship between rank and
egg production didn’t exist when only
five birds were caged together,” Dr.
Cunningham said. “There may be an

 

 

ideal number of birds per cage and
space per bird that is not so stressful to
them.” ' .

The Cornell scientists have not found
that number. But when the experiment
ends, they said, they hope they can
demonstrate that upgraded living
conditions for hens will not only im-
prove their health and comfort -—
presumably adding to their happiness
—— but also increase their egg-laying.




_._ Not Only Dogs Deserve Protecti

As a concerned horsewoman I was upset
when I read the recent article concerning
vague Florida laws dealing with livestock

ineglect. ‘

L The article started off by saying that it is
.easy to spot the abuse of 150 cats in a house
.because the cats show obvious signs of dis-
ease. The same holds true of livestock.

.- If 10 horses are turned out on a one-acre
.sand lot with limited water, no shade, a roll
of moldy hay and no other source of nutri-
tion, it stands to reason they are also lacking
vital veterinary and farrier care.

If procedures for protecting these ani-
mals are not initiated because the owner is
ignorant of proper care procedures or holds
a good job or because he doesn’t have the
time, I can only say bunk. Those are the
most ridiculous reasons imaginable.

If 10 dogs are put in a small enclosure
with no shade, limited water, dry nutrition-
less food with no medical care, the Humane
Society would have a field day. Nobody
cares about the owner’s excuses when man’s
best friend is mistreated, all they care about
are the dogs.

According to Cpl. Ron Hartley, supervi-
sor of the agricultural unit of the Hillsbor-
ough Sheriff’s Office, there are many rea-
sons for an animal to be thin. He says that
Braham cattle all over the state are given
good nutrition and vet care. What happens
is, “those cattle are let loose for years in Flor-
ida through drought and flood, without an
adequate worming program. If that isn’t
neglect then I don’t know what is. ‘

There is also no reason for a horse to be
ribby due to recent foaling, age or size — al-
though that is considered acceptable by Cpl.
Hartley. The only excuse that I could possi-
bly accept is an extended illness or injury to
the animal. Even the oldest broodmare will
keep a layer of fat over her ribs if given ade-
quate feed.

Also, in my own personal experience, the

smallest horses are much easier to keep fat
than show animals. My 15.3-hand mare is on
an easy maintenance feed program which
keeps her fat by most standards despite the
fact that she is worked regularly.

The biggest concern to owners of live-
stock in Florida is not just feeding but ade-

ri From.

Owners' Neglect

quate veterinary care. Because Florida does
not have harsh winters, parasites are a seri-
ous problem. An animal Can lose weight at
the top of its frame and look pot-bellied due
to a heavy infestation of worms.

Parasites are the leadingcause of colic
death in horses in Florida. Once an animal

gets worm damage, it is permanent and can
cause death before the animal’s full life
span has been realized. ‘

Horses do not have to be kept fat to be
healthy. A good working weight is what Cpl.
Hartley calls lean. These horses are not
skinny. They are keeping weight on their
hips and a layer of fat over their ribs.

The average backyard horse needs cer-
tain things to be healthy. These are: ade-
quate shelter (3 simple lean-to is fine) and
safe fencing: a minimum of one feeding per
day plus a good source of grass or clean hay;
clean fresh water; a vet program of worm-
ing and vaccinations; depending on the indi-
vidual animal, the attention of a qualified
farrier.

Judging from the remarks made by Cpl.
Hartley, it seems that he should take time to
thoroughly check out these repeat calls he is
getting —- with the help of a good vet. Usu-
ally when complaints are repeated there is a
good reason.

Cpl. Hartley is obviously not a qualified
vet therefore he is not in a position to make
a professional diagnosis regarding the
health and well-being of livestock. There is
no excuse whatsoever for an owner to con-
tinue neglecting his animals. '

It seems to me that Florida laws are all
too selective about which animals are to be

saved. The general public worrieswa‘bout

dogs, man’s best friend. But other animals
that are equally dependent upon man’s good
graces are pushed into the shady grays of
inadequate legislation.

On a parting note, it has come to my at-
tention that Sarasota County does have a
livestock protection program that, with the
help of qualified vets, is proving successful
within the same range of laws (on the state
level) as Hillsborough County.

I cannot understand why it is that Sara-
sota County can function effectively within
these loose laws and officials in Hillsbor-
ough County can only pass the buck or ex-
cuse themselves by complaining about the
structure of the laws. If these people really
cared they would find a way to protect live-
stock in Hillsborough County.

TAMPA TRIBUNE - August 17, 1986

Tampa Bay Humane Society
ls Against Pound Seizure

A variety of letters, and articles have ap«
peared in the Tribune regarding pound sei-
zure, the practice where animal experi-
menters can go into the shelters and seize
unclaimed dogs and cats for their laborato-
ries.

The Humane Society of Tampa Bay is, of
course, very much against this practice, and
Hillsborough County remains the only
county in the state where this archaic prac-
tice is perpetuated.

Although the questions concerning this
practice invariably turn to research itself,
there is really only one question that Trib-
une readers need to ask themselves, “If my
family pet became lost, would I want him to
be used for live animal experiments?”

From the number of phone calls that
come into our shelter, it is obvious that the
pet owners of this community are united in
not wanting this to happen to their own pet.

Other city/ county functions operate to
give the community peace of mind. If your
house is on fire, you know you can count on
a fire truck to be on its way. You want to
know that if someone breaks into your
house, there is a police station that will re-
spond. This is what is known as civilization.

Yet, in a society that teaches us to be
kind to animals, that nurtures pets as mem-
bers of the family, we are subjected to the
most uncivilized practice. If you inadvert-
ently lose your pet for five days, your life-

long pal can suddenly become a laboratory
tool. '

Dog control was initiated as a com-
munity function to give residents the peace
of mind that if they lost their pets, there
would be a shelter from which they could be.
retrieved, and at worst, these pets would be
humanely euthanised.

But the function of animal control has
been subverted to become a supplier of
cheap tools for the laboratories.

We are not asking to change the original
function of animal control. In fact, we are
asking for just the opposite — for it to be al-
lowed to revert to its original mission to pro-
vide effective animal control. We want to
have policies that make everyone in the
community happy to cooperate with animal
control.

In fact, the Florida Animal Control As-
sociation recently voted 128 to 1 against
pound seizure because “surrendering ani-
mals for research purposes created more,
harm than good.”

Many other countries and states have
banned pound seizure. Every other county
in Florida has terminated the practice.

Our hope is that county officials will lis-
ten to their constituents who are requesting
that we join in.

THE NEW YORK TIMES - August 19, 1986

Conservationists Fear Breakdown in

 

By THOMAS W. NETTER

 

ENEVA, Aug. 18 — Intema-

tional conservation officials

fear that a moratorium on

commercial whaling put into
effect this year is crumbling from
what the World Wildlife Fund calls
“flagrant” violations by some coun-
tries.

In recent weeks, such traditional
whaling nations as Iceland, Norway
and South Korea have announced
plans to continue hunting whales for
“scientific purposes” under the 40-
nation International Whaling Conven-
tion of 1946. The term “scientific”
whaling has been characterized by
conservationists as a “loophole big
enough for a whaleboat.”

Japan, where whale meat is an ex-
pensive delicacy, and the Soviet
Union have announced plans to join in
the moratorium in coming years, and
these and other nations have already
cut back hunting as whale stocks
have dwindled and international pres-
sure to curb hunting has increased.
The United States long ago aban-
doned the whaling industry that built
Nantucket Island and New Bedford

and inspired Herman Melville’s ’

“Moby Dick.” ~

While the United States Govern-

ment has supported the ban on com-
mercial whaling, it has disappointed
conservationists by refusing to im-
pose sanctions on Iceland and Nor-
way; what to do about South Korea
has not been considered yet. Under
United States law, any nation that
weakens the conservation program of
an international fishing treaty risks
sanctions in the form of restricted
fish exports to the United States, as
well as restricted rights to fish in
American waters.’

Conservationists say' that in the
case of some whales, like the north—
east Atlantic minke whale, hunting is
threatening a drastic diminution or
even extinction of the species.

“I am afraid the commercial whal-
ing moratorium is crumbling,”
Charles de Haes, international direc-
tor general of the World Wildlife
Fund, said in a statement issued from
his office’s headquarters in Gland,
Switzerland. “The recent announce-
ment by Iceland that it intends to kill
whales for so-called scientific pur-
poses and sell the byproducts to mink

and other fur farms, is a shocking cir-
cumvention of. the International
Whaling Convention.”

The dispute centers on a clause in
the International Whaling Conven-
tion, created to regulate whaling. In
June, the International Whaling Com-
mission recommended that whale
meat be made available from the
whales harvested for “scientific” re-
search and should be used primarily
for “local consumption.”

. The United States’ View was that
this would heed the “sovereign
rights" of nations to conduct such re-
search, while ensuring that such
whaling not be an excuse to supply

6 WhalingMoratorium

the lucrative Japanese market.
Conservationists say Iceland’s an—

nouncement Aug. 6 that it would kill

up to 120 whales a year, producmg

about 4,000 tons of whale meat prod-

ucts, and consume “51 percent” of it
at home has raised alarmbells.
Critics argue that Icelanders could
not possibly consume 51 percent of
the whale meat, since they usually
consume an estimated 200. tons a
year. For Iceland to stay Within the
interpretation of whaling commissmn
rules, about 1,800 more tons would
have to be used domestically, prob-
ably as feed for fur-bearing animals,
“I am actually appalled,” said
Peter Kramer, the wildlife fund 5
conservation director, “because what
we are observing here is that it isn t
science that comes first, but that
commercial whaling had been con-
ducted by these countries preViously,
and in order to continue whaling, they
have set up a scientific program.
While there are important reasons
for research involving whales, fund
officials and other conservationists
say that more than a million whale
carcasses have been dissected in this
century already. What is more to the
point, they say, is the whale meat
market in Japan, where the meat of
the largest mammal costs more than
beef.
The whaling controversy comes at
a time when the world’s population of
the large, sea-going mammals 15 ei—
ther protected, as in the case of the
blue whale, which was hunted to near

extinction, and other species, or still
threatened by hunting. Some scien-
tists believe the northeast Atlantic
'Minke whale, regarded as the species
most threatened by commercial
whaling, has fallen in number to
30,000 to 40,000 or even lower in the
northeast Atlantic.

Elizabeth Kemf, editor of the wild-
life fund’s newspaper, says these
whales have fallen so much in Nor-
way’s hunting grounds that Whalers,
despite a two-week extention of the
1986 hunting season, did not reach

their quota of 400, catching only 379
whales.

There are some hopeful signs, with
the Soviet Union pledging to halt com-
mercial whaling in 1987 and the J apa-
nese saying they will do so in 1988. But
the question" remains of .what will
happen to the whale meat market in
Japan. “That is the crucial ques-
tion,” says Mr. Kramer, “because if
that market is closed, then real com-
mercial whaling is over.”

:Although the wildlife fund has
called on Japan to ban trade in
whales and whale products caught for
scientific'purposes, there seems to be
scant chance that Japan will act any-

time before 1988, the conservationists:
sa . .
'bIl‘he fund says it has helped develop,
methods of studying whales that do-
not require killing the animals and. ..
has tried to discourage countries like,
Iceland, Japan and Norway from
hunting whales in the name of sc1-y‘
ence. ; .
“Attempts to circumvent the whal-;
ing ban must be exposed,” says_Ms..
Kemf. “As long as whales are killed-
in the name of science and their car-; .
'casses sold, the moratorium remains,
a myth.” ' ,

Feathered Friends

Beatrice Foster doesn’t live alone. Not
really.

“I ain’t that healthy,” she says. “I have
arthritis and bursitis .. . . but I can get
around. I don’t have to have nobody lead
me.” . ,. ,

And she has DeeDee, a parakeet given
to her by People-Animals-Love (PAL), a
nonprofit District “pet-facilitated” therapy
group that works with the elderly, the
handicapped and institutions. . .

“It’s a " lot of company," says the 76-
year-old Foster, who lives in a Columbia'
Heights federal housing project in North-
west D.C. “She doesn’t talk, but she makes
an awful lot ofnoise. And if I sit on the
chair, she comes right over here on my ‘
lap.” ‘

DeeDee is one of nearly 100 birds—
mostly parakeets, but also lovebirds and
cockateels—that PAL has placed in the
past three years. .

“On a senior citizen’s and Social Security
income, you can’t afford to buy too many
things,” says Foster. “So when I heard they
-- were supplying these birds, I learned all
about it.”

The birds are first trained for six weeks
by the Montrose 4-H Club in Rockville,
where they’re taught to be companion
animals. “They’ll come out of the cage on
your finger, interact with you and look to
you for attention and snacks,” says Ann
Holder, a club leader and PAL volunteer.

Pat Boyer, who lives in Rockville’s Beth-
any House for the elderly, got Lady Anne
in February. “She gets next to my ear and

goes chirp-chirp—chirp,” she says. “I tell her

I want her to be quiet, and sometimes she
is and sometimes she isn’t.”

The parakeet goes everywhere with
Boyer—into the bathroom, around the
kitchen—often while perched on her
shoulder. “Because I only have one hand,”
she says, “sometimes it takes me longer to
do things like feeding her water."

Lady Anne’s worth the effort.

“She’s just a baby. She‘got into the trash
can, and I had to get her out,” says Boyer,
55. “And when I was washing dishes, she
jumped into the dishpan.”

The birds, Holder says, are a great
incentive at meals, which tend to be no fun
solo. “We encourage people to interact
with the birds at dinnertime—to give them
some of their vegetables."

Another reason she developed the pro-
gram was to get her 4-Hers—many of
whom didn’t have grandparents living in
the area—involved with the elderly./ The
club members, who range in age from 8 to
18, follow up once a bird is delivered,
answering Questions on care and, if neces-
sary, delivering feed and gravel. The se-
niors contribute only what they can afford.

“One lady here wouldn’t take a bird,”
says Boyer. “I said, ‘Don’t you hear my
Lady'talking to me?’ She said, ‘Yes, but I
don’t want it.’ ” .

The woman has since died, Boyer adds.
“She had cancer, but I think she could have
lived a little bit longer if she had had a
bird.”

he rain started in the middle of the

night. By morning it was pouring.

But we’d driven 12 hours to get to
Maine’s Baxter Park, and we were going up
Mount Katahdin in spite of the weather, in
spite of the fact that we could hardly
distinguish the trail from the stream run-
ning alongside.

What do you do when a dreamed-about
trip begins to look like a
washout? You take what
you can get. As we waded
up the mountain, the usu-
ally spectacular vistas were
camouflaged by clouds.
There wasn’t much to see,
_but there was plenty to
hear. “Listen!” my birder
friends whispered. A long,
clear whistle—a white-
throated sparrow. Whee-
wbeeootz’ti—wbee—a gray-
cheeked thrush. When the
sun ﬁnally came out, our
ragtag expedition raced
for the summit. But we
continued to listen. There
were phoebes and vireos
and a choir of warblers.
At the point where each
gargantuan boulder began
to seem more impossible
than the last, we started
hearing the song of the
pipits that would greet us at the very top.

Now, I have never considered myself a
birder. Given a choice between binoculars
or a ﬁeld guide, and an extra ration of Fig
Newtons, I’ll go with Nabisco. But I will
admit that the music of the woods is one of
my favorite reasons for going there. If it
were entirely quiet, it would be a vastly
different place.

And, someday, it could be.

Impossible? No. Most of the birds whose
songs make the wilderness such a lovely
and lively place are ours for only a small
part of the year. They build their nests and
rear their \(V‘ in El: ":1 northern forests,
then return in the fall to their winter
homes—the tropical forests of Mexico,
Central America, the Caribbean islands,
South America.

to—birds that are no bigger than a child’s
hand—were not only the same species but
actually the same birds that I might have
seen while hiking in Mexico, or Panama,
or Suriname. In 35 years I’ve visited only a

invisible map in their heads, or the lines of
mountains and wind currents as they cross
the continents and oceans? Their lines on a
migration map are a complicated system,
coming in from all over the continent to a
funnel south of the border, then fanning
out again over South America. The same
route each year. How do they know? Is it
instinct, or magnetic impulses in their
brains? I’m not sure anyone has an answer.

But one thing we do know. The tanagers
that ﬂash scarlet among the trees, the
thrushes with their ﬂutelike songs, the
whole array of orioles, ﬂycatchers, king-
birds, warblers, mockingbirds, vireos,
grosbeaks, buntings——a third of the birds
you’re probably familiar with in the United
States—spend a large part of their lives in
the tropical forests. They depend on those
winter retreats to survive.

The problem is that these tropical forests
are vanishing rapidly all over the world.

Since 1950, two~tbirds of Central Ameri-
ca’s rainforests have been wiped out.
Worldwide, tropical forests are falling to
the axe, the chainsaw, and the plow at a
frightening rate: Forty percent are already
gone. The reasons are varied. Population
explosions in tropical countries drive
more and more farmers to cut and burn a
few acres upon which to eke out a meager
living. Our own demand
for cheap beef and fast—
food hamburgers is met by
expanding acres of cattle
pastures in the tropics,
mostly on land that once
supported forests. Logging
for valuable hardwoods
such as mahogany and
teak often leaves great
gaps in the forest canopies,
destroying ten times as
many trees as are actually
harvested.

Unfortunately, as more
and more acres are
cleared, people are discov-
ering the paradox of the
rainforests, a sort of eco-
logical Catch 22: These in-
credibly rich systems sur-
vive on incredibly poor
soil. The nutrients are al-
most all in the vegetation.
Once the vegetation is
gone, it is only a year or two before
depletion is complete and erosion begins.
For a brief moment, perhaps there will be
a pasture (beef cattle), quick proﬁts (a
million double cheeseburgers), but then
the once-rich forest will end its life as
desert. With the trees gone, even the rain
goes, too.

Although no one is really sure, scientists
estimate that 25 to 100 acres of tropical
forest are lost each minute. At this rate,
they will be gone by the end of the next
century. In certain areas, the pace is even
worse: Many countries are losing their
forests at such dizzying rates that they will
be gone within two or three decades,
unless something is done to reverse the
process.

The few tropical forests I’ve hiked were
magical places. In Chiapas, Mexico, a trail
led back for miles beyond the ancient
Maya ruins, into a forest of towering trees,

A Hunter Tries a New Way
Of Protecting the Interests
Of Western Lumbermen

_ By KEN SLOCUM
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
. FORKS, Wash—“I had the rifle in my
right hand, and I reached out with the bar-
rel and pushed back the ferns. That
wounded bear stood up right at the muzzle,
and I fired into his chest. It didn’t even
knock him down. Then he was on me.”
.Ralph Flowers has had close contact
With bears for 30 years, and it shows. Odd
lumps misshape his left arm and his par-
tially numb hand; tooth scars speckle the
right hand, and his trigger finger no longer
Will close. But generous gray hair hides
the stitching that put back his scalp after a
bear cuffed him On the head.

Mr. Flowers says he killed some 60
black bears in his youth, hunting them for
sport. That was before he was hired by
timber companies in 1960 to do it for a liv-
ing, “making groceries off of bear tails,”
as he puts it. His total bear kill through
last spring is 1,122.

So the 58-year-old Mr. Flowers would
seem to be an unlikely person to become a

. benefactor of bears, a man who now would

i save hundreds of bears, temper animal-
control practices of the timber industry
and alter hunting seasons. But he may be
heading on such a course.

The damage black bears do is costly to
the timber industry. For some bears
emerging from hibernation with gnawings
in the gut, the springtime fir tree is a gus-
tatory delight. The bears rip off the bark
and then rake the trunk with their teeth,
gathering the inner lining, or cambium, a
tender, sugar-rich layer. In the process,
the tree is severely damaged and, if gir-
dled, killed. The main tree damage is con-
fined to three months—April through
June—and dwindles when the bears’ favor-
ite food, wild berries, appears in July.

That three months adds up to big bucks
for the timber industry because the most
vulnerable trees are .
some eight to 10
inches in diameter
and have been nur-
tured by companies
for perhaps 25
years. One hungry
bear can peel 50
trees in a night and
do $20,000 in damage
over the spring, the
timber companies '

contend.

Not all bears peel

trees. “The best

guess is the cubs — ——

Harold Sturgis, a district wildlife biologist
for the Oregon Department of Fish and
Wildlife. Mr. Flowers thinks it goes a step
further. “It’s probably learned, but what

3 we don’t understand is why some bears be-

come addicts to cambium and others will
peel an occasional tree but don’t seem to

, like it.”

Whatever the reason, the solution tradi-
tionally has been the same: Where bear
damage becomes a problem, the bears are
killed. Washington state, for instance,
holds a spring bear-hunting season solely
to control forest damage. ‘

Over the years, killing bears didn’t
cause much of a fuss here in the North-
west, where many jobs depend on trees
and on the lumber companies. But it did
recently, after three timber companies
were hit by an epidemic of tree-peeling
bears in a six-square-mile area near Alsea,
Ore. The three, Willamette Industries Inc.,
Starker Forests Inc. and Hull-Oakes Lum—
ber Co., brought in a government trapper.
He trapped and then shot a dozen bears.

Upset, Cathy Sue Anunsen, of Salem,
and her attorney husband, Roger, sued to
stop the killing. They are backed by an en-
vironmental group, the Fund for Animals.

_ The suit challenges the Oregon law allow-

ing timber companies to kill bears to stop
tree damage, and it contends that wildlife
belongs to the public, which should be al-
lowed to collect damages when wildlife is
destroyed. A circuit—court judge is ex-
pected to decide this month whether to or-
der a trial.

But most attention is focused on Mr.
Flowers, this time without his faithful .270-
caliber riﬂe. After working as a profes-

- sional bear hunter for 15 years for the

Washington Forest Protection Association,
a group of timber companies, Mr. Flowers

since 1975 has been the supervisor of the
group’s animal damage control and spends
much of his time locating and mapping
‘1. tree damage so the state can direct spring
bear hunts. “All the years I worked on ani-

mal control, I hoped to come up with a so-

lution to damage other than killing the
bears,” says the soft-spoken Mr. Flowers.
Two years ago, he began wrestling with

the idea of feeding bears in the spring I
rather than shooting them. His employer, f
the timber group, gave its approval and fi-

nanced an experimental feeding project.

Using three captured bears, Mr. 2

Flowers tried dozens of mixtures of fruit
and vegetable fiber, plus an attractant and

minerals. Then he tested a recipe in the

wild. “Man, did those bears love it. They

l licked the buckets shiny,” he says.

Last spring, again with money from the
timber~company group, Mr. Flowers ex-
panded the feeding project into five areas

; of Washington. Results won’t be compiled
. until fall, and Mr. Flowers declines to pre-

dict the conclusions.

 

 

 

But initial indications look promising,
Mr. Flowers says. On one two-acre test
plot with a feeder, where 109 trees were
peeled over three years, none were peeled
this year. On two plots checked last month,
damage declined 80% on one and 87% on
the other. But in a different test area, one
bear ate all the feed and then peeled 45
trees around the feeder. (“He’s since gone
to bears’ happy hunting grounds,” Mr.
Flowers remarks.)

In the Oregon suit, the Fund for Ani-
mals is seeking a court order to force tim-
ber companies to stop killing bears. In-

: stead, the fund wants the state to try Mr.

Flowers’s feeding program, which'it will fi—
nance. “We think it could be a landmark
decision, with ramifications reachng far

. beyond Oregon,” says Cleveland Amory,
' the fund’s founder.

Timber companies say they kill bears
only as a last resort. “We’re not in the
bear-killing business; we’re in the timber
business,” says John Davis, the general
manager of Western Timber & Logging, a
division of Willamette Industries. But the
companies are skeptical of the feeding pro-
gram. “The trees are vulnerable over 15 to
20 years,” says Barte Starker, the execu—
tive vice president of Starker Forests. “We
have trouble understanding how you can
feed a bear for 15 to 20 years without af-
fecting its ability to feed itself.”

While Mr. Flowers worries about costs,
which in the test amount to $300 to feed one
bear for two months, he doubts that feed-
ing would change bears’ ability to survive.
He shows a reporter a bear track So big
that it dwarfs his hand. “That bear is in f

the area anyway, and we’re only going to

feed it for two months,” he says. “So it

5 isn’t going to change his habits.”

Still, Mr. Flowers concedes that in the

‘ bear-control business he has shown faulty

judgment before. Take the time he jumped
a bear in the woods, knocked it down with
one shot and then saw it get up and run off.

9 The code of the wild dictates that a hunter

. -1-“ b"‘“—‘- «- -

track down a wounded bear, both to cut
short the animal’s suffering and to prevent
bear attacks.

Trailing the hear, he got off a few more
shots and then found that he was out of
shells. “From what I’d seen of that bear, it
looked scrawny, and I didn’t think it would
take much to finish him off,” Mr. Flowers
recalls. So he put down his rifle,\found a

. formidable club and followed the bear into
: the bushes. .

Rubbing scars of old puncture wounds

that went completely through both arms,
Mr. Flowers observes with a rueful smile:

“As soon as that bear stood up, I knew I
had made a mistake.”

Vegas performers’
white tiger gives birth

" LAS VEGAS — Sitarra, the
SOD-pound pure snow white Bengal
tiger co-star of illusionists Siegfried
& Roy’s Frontier Hotel show,
“Beyond Belief,” gave birth last
week to four white tiger cubs at the

9“'

stars Jungle palace” in Las Vegas.

Siegfried assisted as Roy deliv-
ered the babies in a special nursery
that had been prepared for their
arrival.

According to Siegfried and Roy,
this is believed to be the first case
in the world of a pure snow white
tiger giving birth to offspring. The
father of the cubs is Neva, a
"GOO-pound white male. He, Sitarra,
and a third white tiger, Shasadee,
were acquired by Siegfried and Roy
three years The three are descen-

dants of rare white. tigers be-'

queathed to this country by the
Maharajah of Rewa of India several
years ago.

The cats are estimated to be

worth several million dollars.

The mother is one of only five
pure white tigers known to exist in
the world today. They are widely
thought to be rarer than pandas.
She is a featured performer in
Siegfried and Roy’s Las Vegas
show, which includes a number of
large-scale illusions centered
around their menagerie of wild
animals.

Plans are uncertain as to when
Sitarra, who joins the ranks of
working mothers, will return to the
nightly performances at the Fron-
tier.

Neither rain,
nor snow,

DEA%/£0 I

nor gloom of night”

By Ray Flack _ ,
Denver Post Staff Writet’f

To Janice Lapp, the bite of the
Postal Service is far worse than
the bark of her small dog Petie.

Maili'delivery to Mrs. Lapp’s
home at 1754 Akron St., Aurora,
has been stopped, and she’s
snarling mad about it. She
contends that her dog, a
12-inch-high white Maltese, poses
no danger to the mailman and
that she’s being made the victim
of other people’s mistakes.

The Postal Service says it is
acting according to policy, “even
if the case seems to have some
discrepancy.”

“We don’t look at whether a
dog bite comes in a big or small
package. We look at all of them
as bites,”-said Scott Budny, a
postal spokesman. He noted that
62 mail carriers have been bitten
by dogs in the Denver area this
year.

Lapp said Petie sneaked out
through an open screen door at
her home Wednesday and began
barking as the postman, who
wasn’t identified, approached
her home to deliver the mail into
a slot that opens into the house.

“Petie did a half circle and
barked. He didn’t bite the man.
The mailman then kicked Petie
three times,” Mrs. Lapp
contended.

She said the lO—pound dog then
went to another woman in the

yard after she had given it a
voice command.
The carrier telephoned his

supervisor at the postal station

at 1550 Dayton St., and the
supervisor decided to impose the
stop- delivery order. ,

Lapp said she had appealed to
the supervisor and to Dave
Lamont of the Postal Service
consumer affairs office. Both
declined to reverse the order,
though Lamont told Lapp “there
appear to be some discrepancies
in this case.”

Budny said the policy,
established in 1982, is put into
effect if “a mailman is attacked,
the dog bites or is looking as if he
is attempting to bite.”

According to the letter
advising that no more mail will
be delivered to the home, Mrs.
Lapp has three options: She can
install a mail box near her
sidewalk, rent a postal box or get
rid of her dog. “I’ll never get rid
of my dog. If I have to, I will ship
him to the United Kingdom,”
Mrs. Lapp said. She explained
she is a native of Great Britain
and has been in the United States
seven years.

She said she had no idea what
she would do to get her mail.

“My husband isn't going to buy
a mail box, and I’m not going to
rent a box. I’ll get rid of the
mailman before I get rid of my.
dog,” she said.

With his bulging eyes, wide mouth, three double.

has a face only a mother fish could love.

'Still, he’s .a friendly critter who will leave behind
lots of friends when he moves to a 'new aquarium

Seems after all those red fish and trout dinners, the
rare 25-pound Queensland grouperis too fat for his

His_ owners and caretakers are sure Gordon will be
happier in a bigger saltwater tank near other grou-

they’re proudly predicting he’ll be the star attraction,,

CLEVELAND PLAIN DEALER - July 31, 19376,“

Reclaimed lan
is donatedfor f
wildlife refuge ”

By PAULINE THOMA
STAFF WRITER

COLUMBUS - The largest dona-
tion of land for wildlife conservation
purposes in Ohio history was made
here yesterday by the Ohio Power Co.
after two years of negotiations.

At a news conference, officers of
Ohio Power and its parent company,
American Electric Power Co., gave
9,154 acres of reclaimed strip mining
property to the non-profit Interna-

 

tional Center for the Preservation of 7

Wild Animals Inc. for a $25 million
sanctuary for endangered and disap-
pearing animals. .

In American Power’s plush audito-
rium, which was filled with taped jun-
gle sounds and noises of twittering
birds, board Chairman W.S. (Pete)
White said the first parcel of more
than 3,000 acres-would be deeded to
the center immediately and that
blocks of more than 500 acres each
would be provided as needed by the
center’s progress and as reclamatiOn
bonds are released by the state.

The land, wide open spaces where
the deer and the antelope will play, is
in Muskingum County, not far from
Interstates 70 and 77. -

Backers have predicted the sanc- ’
tuary will attract a million visitors a ‘
year from all over the world. No open- '

ing date has been set.

The gift provides the impetus for
raising private funds, marketing and
site planning that can now begin, sai-
dRobert W. Teater, former director of
the Ohio Department of Natural
Resources and consultant to the
project. Teater predicted building of
the animal herds would start within
two years.

The center, which will be a haven
and a survival and research facility as
well as a tourist attraction, is
expected to have on display in natural
settings bobcats, cranes, camels, deer,
antelopes, bison, wild horses, elk, ibex,
otters, beavers, badgers, coyotes,
prairie dogs, snow leopards, cheetahs
and zebras.

Gov. Richard F. Celeste, prefacing
his remarks with the observation that
the jungle noises reminded him of a
iward club meeting in Cleveland, said

 

the center’s plans indicated “godd
stewardship of extraordinary natural
resources” and that the refuge would
the a globally recognized conserva-

tion effort that would bring visitors to .

the state and aid the major zoos by
-, roviding them with animals.
.. The state has given $50,000 for fea-

ﬂ§ibility studies for the refuge.

 

International Center for the
Preservation of Wild Animals

Thomas H. Anderson, president of

. the center, called the rolling hills,

trees and ponds being donated “a fan-

tastic piece of pr0perty that is abso-
.. lutely gorgeous and eminently suited

for our purposes.” .
He added, “Now the hard part
starts. We accept the challenge indi-

- cated by this magnificent gift and we

intend to create a fantastic facility.”
White said no appraisals had been
made of the land. Sources have esti-
mated the value of the land at $400 an
acre, making the gift worth more than
$3.6 million. The power company
reclaims 1,200 acres each year after
coal mining ceases, at an average cost
of $9,000 an acre. ‘
Teater gave credit for the original
idea to Daniel M. Galbreath, a center

trustee, who had suggested the “bold .

 

and visionary” plan eight years ago as
a way to help Ohio zoos that were
having difficulty importing exotic
creatures. Galbreath replied that he
had been a devotee of wildlife since he
caught turtles and crawdads as an 8-
year-old.

The center’s board, which includes
200 directors in Ohio and Pittsburgh,
had asked Ohio Power for 10,000 acres
several years ago.

The land is part of Ohio Power’s
Muskingum Mine area and includes
acreage already mined and reclaimed
plus some untouched by miners. The
utility will retain mineral rights to the
land, which is partially in Rich Hill
Township and partially in Meigs
Township.

‘ f Henry Ford hadn’t invented the mass

Hi8 dog would have foreseen the necessity
for a low-priced automobile accessible to
even the most common of breeds. And even
though Henry beat the dog to it, I’m.
inclined to believe it was the dog’s idea in
the first place.

In any case, city streets were soon
jammed with shuddering Model T’s, each
with a dog tongue hanging out the window.
Or so it probably seemed. Whatever the
actual rate of dogs to cars, one clear
universal truth emerged. from Henry Ford’s .
. innovation. Or his dog's.

' That is dogs love cars. This bond between ‘
zinc and creature is a trait unique to dogs
one. ‘ ~ .

Sure, we always hear how much the
American people love their automobiles and
would never part with them, even if the3
Russians threatened to nuke us all if we
didn’t. But how many of us gleefully bound

out the door for our autos every workday
morning to join rush-hour traffic?

Given half a chance, a dog would. A dog I
would choose a car ride over food, ﬁguring-
the food could wait, a car might not. “Cat“ "
ride” is among the most basic phrases injja

“walk,” “fetch” and “stay out of the
garbage.” ~

stroll from house to car. Dogs have no

“The big question is can this
male sire offspring,” Lucas said.
If kittens are born, the mother

cougar will be allowed to teach them '
how to survive in the wild.

Lukas said this conditioning
could take more than two years.

If everything goes as scheduled,
the panther-cougar kittens will be
sterilized, fitted with radio transmit-

. ter collars andreleased in the wild

in areas of North Florida to see if
they can survive.

Scientists decided to use female
cougars in the first phase before sub-
jecting female ’panthers to the

stresses of captivity. ,
, If the tests with the cougars are

successful, then a female Florida

panther will be captured to mate .

with Big Man.

If that mating is successful, the
kittens would eventually be released
into the wild when they are mature
enough to survive on their own. .

The Texas cougar and the Flor-
ida panther are very close geneti-
cally and the panther is a subspecies
of the cougar family, officials said.

Officialsalso stressed the rein-

thers in South Florida, estimated to
range between 30 and 50 panthers.‘

the bears exercise far more restraint

Benign View of Black Bears t:::.‘t:.:::s‘i.:;- assists;

 

By JANE E. BRODY

 

T. PAUL -— Teddy bears, bear

hugs, Smokey Bear and Care

Bears notwithstanding, in the

popular mind bears are dan-

gerous, even ferocious animals that
readily attack unsuspecting humans.

However, with respect to the black
. bear, by far the most common bear in
. this country, nothing could be further
from the truth, according to Dr. Lynn
L. Rogers, a world-recognized expert
' on black bears. Dr. Rogers has been
studying the behavior of these “most
manlike of North American mam-
mals” in the Superior National For-
est for 17 years and has found their
appearance to be far more threaten-
.ing than their actual behavior. For
example, bears use their fierce-look-
ing fangs primarily to rip open logs
for a meal of insects, and the bear’s
occasional aggressive-looking stance
on hind legs is simply a way to get a
better view, Dr. Rogers explained in
an interview here at the North Cen-
tral Experiment Station of the United
States Forest Service.

In addition to shedding much light
on the habits and habitats of bears,
Dr. Rogers’s research has had unex-
pected medical spinoffs related to
crash dieting, space travel, severe
burns and the treatment of gall-
stones, kidney disease and possibly
cancer. For example, in its long
hibernation, the black bear burns
body fat and its cholesterol level
soars, yet it has no problem with
hardening of the arteries or choles-
terol gallstones. The bear was found
to produce a special bile acid, urso—
deoxycholic acid, that dissolves gall-
stones and that is now used medically
for that purpose. As for its place in
the overall environment, Dr. Rogers
showed the black bear to be an impor-
tant disperser of fruit seeds, which
emerge from the animal’s digestive
tract intact and primed for germina-
tion.

Dr. Rogers has found that the
bear’s various threat gestures, from
extending its lips and snorting to
lunging explosively are intimidating

but are almost never followed by an
actual attack.

“I have invaded bears in their dens
to tranquilize them, draw blood, fit
them with radio-collars and take
their temperature and their pic-
tures,” Dr. Rogers said. “I’ve chased
and treed and captured their cubs.
One time I fell and accidentally clob-
bered one on the head with my heavy
camera and kicked it in the teeth. But
in all my years of studying bears, I
have have never been attacked.”

“Black bears,” he explained, “live
in the forest and are very adept at
climbing trees, so they evolved with-
out a strong tendency to aggressively
defend their cubs. In the last 80 years
throughout. North America, despite
many thousands of close encounters

between people and bears, there have
been only 40 unprovoked attacks, and
only 18 were fatal,” he said.

Most such encounters result from
the bear’s extraordinary dependence
on fragile food supplies, Dr. Rogers’s
tracking studies and analyses of ex-
crement have shown. The black bear,
whose diet is 90 percent vegetable
matter, is highly susceptible to the
vagaries of weather and its effects on
such preferred foods as berries and
nuts. When food is in short supply, the
research revealed, sexual maturity is
delayed by several years, litters are
smaller and borne further apart, and
cubs and yearlings are less likely to
survive. In addition, hungry bears
tend to travel many miles from home
in search of sustenance.

People most often run into black
bears when shortages of their natural
foods prompt them to invade camp-
grounds and town garbage dumps for

a meal. Such “nuisance bears” are
commonly shot, and, Dr. Rogers
found, injuries inflicted by people ac-
count for more than 90 percent of the
deaths among adult bears in Minneso-
ta.

Other than man, he said, adult
bears have few natural enemies. Only
grizzlies and wolves attack them, but
such incidents rarely occur. And
bears are extremely hardy, rarely
succumbing to disease. Cubs, on the
other hand, can fall prey to starvation
and carnivorous animals.

As an alternative to shooting nui-
sance bears, some localities have
tried capturing and moving them
some distance away. Tracking stud—
ies by Dr. Rogers and his colleagues
have shown that bears would have to
be released more than 40 miles away
to assure that at least'half would not
return.

Killing of 2,000 Bears‘

“We’ve radio-tracked bears 126
miles from'home during years of
drought or leaf frost, but when the
food supply improves, they go back,”
he said. “Last year, food was very

scarce and the bears probably trav-.
eled many times that distance. Thou~
sands of bears from Canada invaded
east-central Minnesota and Wiscon—
sin, resulting in perhaps 2,000 being
killed as nuisances and during hunt-
ing season. This year food is very
abundant and the bears went back
home.”

“Now we’re seeing very few bears
in Minnesota because many of the

resident bears were killed along with '

the transients,” he said. “Most were
shot in trees ”while trying to escape
from people, or in barrel traps after
capture. In bear~people interactions,

more dangerous than they really are.
It’s hard to get a balanced view when
the outdoor magazines repeatedly
stress danger from bears. If a bear
comes into your camping area, the
best way to get rid of it is to chase it,
not shoot it.”

Another useful technique, Dr.
Rogers’s studies showed, is to spray
the bear with capsaicin, the “burn-
ing” ingredient in cayenne peppers
now used by mail carriers to repel
dogs.

While the black bear is neither an
endangered nor a threatened species,
its natural habitat is shrinking as peo—
ple expand into wooded areas to hunt,
cut forests for wood and build sum-
mer homes. Black bears can still be
found in 35 to 40 states, Dr. Rogers
said, but in some states the popula-
tions are probably too small to be
reproductively viable. ' ,

Bears, both male and female, are
promiscuous, and males have little to
do with their families. In fall, as the
food supplies dwindle, the bears build
solitary dens; only females with cubs
have company in winter. Females
impregnated the previous June have
litters in January of one to four hair-
less cubs, each weighing less than a
pound. The cubs live all winter on the
milk of their hibernating mothers,
emerging from the den three months
later with a coat of fur but weighing
Just four to seven pounds. The cubs
continue to nurse for another year,
which serves as a natural method of
birth control and increases the cubs’
chances of survival until the next lit-
ter is born two years later.

Findings on Hibernation

_ Hibernation has long been the most
intriguing aspect of bears, and it has
also turned out to have greatest rele-
vance to people. In Minnesota, bears
commonly hibernate for six months
or longer, never emerging once from
their dens to urinate, defecate, eat or
drink. Dr. Rogers, in collaboration
with biochemists at the University of
Minnesota and the University of Illi-
nois, studied blood from hibernating
bears and uncovered several findings
with possible medical applications.
In hibernation, the bear’s kidneys
essentially shut down, yet they are
not poisoned by accumulating urea
that the kidneys normally filter from
the blood. Instead, urea is reabsorbed
from the bladder and broken down to
release nitrogen molecules which the
bear uses to build new protein and
preserve its lean muscle tissue during
hibernation, even though it eats noth-
ing and loses up to a third of its
weight. If the biochemical triggers of
this phenomenon can be isolated and
applied to humans, Dr. Rogers sug-
gested, they might be used to treat
burn victims, people in kidney failure
or those on crash diets, and may also
be applicable to long-term space trav-
elers and people who cannot eat be»
cause of intestinal disorders or can-

,cer treatments.

A sight for whale. watchers

Rarest of species has returned to coastal waters off Massachusetts

By Jerry Ackerman
Globe Staff

After their first summertime absence in 10
years. whales have returned to Massachusetts
coastal waters. ' '

But the new arrivals are quite different animals
-— including right whales, the rarest species in the
world — a change some naturalists say indicates
that a natural ecological transition is under way in
Massachusetts Bay. _

For amateur whale watchers and the boats that
take them 20 to 25 miles east of Boston to watch the
cetaceans, this shift may make up for the unexpect-
ed departure of the more spectacular, cavorting
humpback whales early in June.

And for naturalists. the arrival of right whales —
a species almost made extinct by the wholesale
slaughter of whales for their oil over the past cen-
.tury - is presenting a rare opportunity to study
their behavior. '

In addition, naturalists who work with whale-
watch boats sailing from Provincetown and Glou—
cester report that sei whales. a species usually seen
off Iceland and Norway and almost never close to
shore, are appearing inside Massachusetts Bay.

The naturalists think changes in fOOd availabil-
ity are responsible for the transition.

“The humpback whales we, were seeing before
feed mostly on sand eels.” said Candice Keays, a
naturalist for the Seven Seas Whale Watch boats in

Gloucester. “Now we are seeing species of whales

that are primarily plankton eaters.”

Biologists believe the six-inch-Iong bottom-feed-
ing sand eels, which are also food for several fish
species, have been in a cyclical decline for several
years on Steilwagen Bank, the fishing ground in the:
center of Massachusetts Bay where whales congre—
gate. '

According to Charles Mayo, director of the Center
for Coastal Studies in Provincetown, this loss of
sand eels has meant less plankton is being eaten in
the area — and that the surplus of plankton has at—
tracted the right whales and sei whales.

Mayo said in a telephone interview that he be-

 

‘This looks like the right
whales and sei whales are
filling in a biological. niche .
in which one type of animal
leaves an environment, an-
other appears to fill in.’

. - Charles Mayo

lieves the shift is natural and disputes contentions
that man—made pollution is the cause.

“This looks like the right whales and sei whales
are filling in a biological niche," he said. in which
“one type of animal leaves an environment. another
appears to fill in."

He said that just as biologists were caught off

' guard by the June departure of humpback whales

to grounds 50 miles east of Nantucket, they can’t
predict the whales’ next moves. either.
Meanwhile, the humpback whales. whose leap-

. ing and diving antics make them especially popular

tourist attractions, may be moving closer to Cape
Cod. .Mayo reported 37 were seen between 10 and 15
miles of Chatham and Orleans on Sunday.

Other humpback sightings were reported on Jef-
freys Ledge, a fishing ground. east of Portsmouth,

‘ N.H., that can be reached in about three hours from

Gloucester. Salem and Newburyport.

Some biologists hope the addition of rarer species
of Whales to tour-boat repertoires will encourage
amateur watchers to think more seriously about
their adventures. ' '

“In some ways the whale-watch industry has be-
come a victim of its own hyperbole,” said Keays.
“It’s been almost a circus atmosphere with the
humpbacks out there doing all kinds of tricks. What
I’m trying to imprass on people now is that‘if you
want to see a whale jump through a hoop, go to Sea
World. If you want to see some of the rarest animals
on earth, go to their natural habitat."

Adopting a son
easy compared
to adopting dog

A long time ago Fred and Kay Meyer adopted
a son. As you can imagine, it was a complicated,
bureaucratic procedure, but ultimately it all
worked out and now their 7-year-old son is a
happy member of the family.

Then the Meyers took on a real challenge.
They tried to adopt a puppy.

“Corey (the 7-year-old) wanted to take care of
a dog and we agreed to help him,” said Fred.

“We didn’t want to go out and get a dog with a
pedigree or anything like that; we just wanted a
best-friend type of mutt, you know. In fact we
decided to go down to the humane society and
see if we could find a puppy that might need a
break.

“We found one on our second trip and we
filled out what we found out was only the
‘preliminary’ information sheet.

“We filled out a form, agreeing to have the
puppy spayed or neutered and that we all lived
together in the same house and some other basic
information. ' ‘

“Then we sat down for our interview.

“The interviewer asked us where the puppy
would stay,” said Kay. “I told her we had a 20-
foot-by-40-foot porch connected to the house and
that that’s probably where it would sleep. She
asked what kind of a roof the porch had and we
told her it was aluminum.

“She told us that when it rained the rain on
the roof would frighten the puppy, so that was
unacceptable.”

“I told her that, at least for a few months, the
puppy would stay in the house, probably in the
kitchen. 1

“Our house is on a fenced-in acre of land and

eventually, I told her, the puppy would get its ‘

own dog house and stay outside.”

“She asked us if one of us would be at home
or if the dog would be by itself,” said Kay. “I told
her that we had our own business at home and
that someone would almost alWays be there. She
asked if people came in and out of the fence and
I said yes, that we do have employees who have
to come through the fence gate to get to our
office.”

' “’Well,”’ she said, ‘doesn’t that mean the dog
might be able to get away through the open gate?’

“We told her that if we were both not going to
be home but that someone might open the gate
then we would put the dog on a chain.

 

i

 

“She said they couldn’t go along with that and
she walked out of the room to talk to someone

_ else. A few minutes later another woman came in

and said that our arrangements were

; unacceptable. She did say that we had 24 hours to
; remedy the situation.

“Our son was crushed to find out that we were

‘unacceptable.’ ”

The Meyers went out and purchased a little

; black puppy with white spots.

“His name is Patches,” said Kay, and We are
very happy.

“We just wonder why it is so difficult for a
family that is obviously interested in caring for

an animal, while at the same time they end up
:; destroying the great majority of dogs and cats
that are brought in?”

Phil Snyder is the executive director of the

Humane Society of Tampa Bay. Two years ago
i, when he took over the reins (so to speak) he said

he would install a stricter adoption program at

the society’s shelter in order to prevent the

recycling of animals.

“Two years ago,” he said, “when an animal
would leave the shelter we discovered that only
about 10 percent of them were being spayed or
neutered. Now we have a 92 percent fulfillment.

“We want to adopt out as many good pets to as
many good homes as we can and we do that by
finding out as much about the applicant’s pet
history as we can. If you had a dog that was run
over by a car, we want to make sure it won’t

=" happen again.

“If you are married we ask that both of you
come down. If you have a roommate we ask the
same thing. We want to make sure that both of
you will care for the pet.

“Veterinarians are telling us that they are
seeing better and more responsible owners than
ever before.”

I don’t know. Snyder makes a lot of sense. But
I think if I was that puppy and the Meyers came
by and wanted to adopt me and got turned down,
I would have bitten somebody on the foot.

Group says species die out while

US delays «

By Dianne Dumanoski
Globe Staff
In just 13 years, at least 80 animals and plants
have become extinct while awaiting designation by
- the federal government as endangered species, says a
report by the Defenders of Wildlife.

The national conservation group cites this as but

one example of how inadequate support by the Rea;
gan administration continues to undermine the En-‘

.dangered Species Act. Reauthorization of the law,
passed in 1973, and its funding levels are currently
;under review in Congress.

Unless things change, another victim could soon
be the roseate tern, which‘has its largest colony in the
world on a small island off Cape Cod, said Thomas
French, director of Massachusetts’ endangered spe-
cies program. Named for its pink breast and its red

legs, the species has (1 i '

The problems outlined in the Def ’

and by Fitzgerald in an interview include: report

David Klinger, a spokesman for the US Fish and
Wildlife Service, which is charged with enforcing the

endan-

gered list more frequently than in
the past. During 1981, Watt’s first
year as the head of the Interior De:
partment, only four species were
added. In 1985, 60 additions were
made. ‘

The Defenders of Wildlife group
counters that the increased rate of

‘listings will do little to reduce a

backlog of 3,900 candidate plants
and animals now awaiting federal
review and possible protectiOn.

French characterized federal
action on candidate species as
“painfully slow and painfully lit-
tle. There’s a lot of foot-dragging
there.

“The excuse I usually hear is
lack of staff and there’s probably
some truth to that. But my guess
is that conservation is not a par-
ticularly high priority in this ad-
ministration." '

Last year, the House passed its
reauthorization bill With an
amendment instructing the Fish
and Wiidliie Service to halt extinc-
tions among candidate species.
French s'i the agency recently
has stepped up efforts to set priori-
ties.

But Klinger offered little prom—
ise for an increased rate of list-
ings. "We can only doso much
with certain levels of staffing and
funding,” he said.’

Although the Reagan adminis-
tration has repeatedly proposed
major cuts in funding for endan—
gered species.‘~ Congress has re-
stored most 'or all of the money.
The same is true of the pending
.‘bill.

Money, however, isn’t the only
problem, according to Fitzgerald.
The Reagan administration, he
said, has ignored or subverted the
law, which stipulates that no fed— ;
eral action shall jeopardize a listed
species.

He said the conservation group
may sue to overturna new regula~
tion that eliminates reviews of
government activities that affect
endangered species outside the
United States. Fitzgerald said this
new regulation runs counter to
current sentiment in Congress,
where the House recently passed a
bill giving the Agency for Interna-
tional Development $10 million
earmarked to help other countries
preserve their biological diversity.

Klinger defended the new regu-
lation by saying, “Our ability to
promote the recovery of species in
Other countries is very limited. We
can do a lot more for species found
in the US.” »

He said the findings on enforce-
ment in the Defenders’ report are
”a bit. misleading." The Fish and
Wildiife Service has not reduced
its effcrts, Klinger said, but has
shifted its focus from small inves—
tigations to large undercover open
ations directed against illegal
trading of endangered species.

Offsetting the bad news, mean—
while, is the recovery of the brown
pelican along the Atlantic Coast.
The bird, which was severely af-
fected by the now-banned pesti-
cide DDT, has made a strong
comeback and, Klinger said, has

been removed from the govern—
ment’s list for recovery — the first
time a species has been dropped
from that list.

Vet’s dream is a haven for injured

By Peter Gorner
Chicago Tribune

t. Paul—The big shuttered
wooden cage looks ominous.
One need only come near to
sense the annoyed shifting of
something very large. A nasty
contralto croak snaps an unmistakable
waming: “Get the hell away!”

Veterinarian Patrick Redig doesn’t
pause, but calmly unlatches the cage
door. “Go on,” he matter—of—factly tells
the occupant. “Get up on the perch

. on the perch. You know I can’t
reach you down there.”

Then, in a ﬂash, the vet makes a
practiced grab with gloved hands. A
few thumps and outraged fortissimo
squawks later, Redig’s ﬁsts emerge
elasping the legs—hence the murderous
claws—of a 12—pound female Ameri-
can bald eagle.

Redig quickly ﬂips the great bird on
its back, cradling it in his arms like a
baby. The eagle’s eyes are spewing yel-
low fire. Yet, oddly, it doesn’t resist.

“The position tends to soothe them,”
explains Redig as he carries the eagle
to X-ray its infected leg.

“This animal has a fungal infection
in the legbone. She was shipped here
from Alaska; lame, scavenging and
growing steadily weaker. We’re treating
her with drugs and literally fighting for
her life, because a one~legged eagle can-
not survive. So she’s hurting, yet she’ll
let us try to help her.”

Lucky eagle, to end up at this unique
and humane hospital—the Raptor Re—
search and Rehabilitation Program
[RRRP] of the University of Minneso—
ta’s School of Veterinary Medicine.

As the world leader in healingin— .

jured birds of prey and releasing them
back to the Wild, the place is con-

sidered a kind of miracle.

The term, raptor, is akin to rapa—
cious, meaning grasping or gripping. It
refers to the manner in which these
birds seize prey with their feet. A low
reproductive rate has always kept
predatory birds in proper balance with
their prey, but man has imperiled the
predators’ very existence. Throughout
history, no birds have been so persecut-
ed as the birds that must kill to live.

Since 1972, responding to national.
concern for the environment, the Min-

. nesota vets have treated thousands of

wild birds—a phenomenal total of
3,600 raptors and nearly 2,000 birds of
other species. Admissions have in—
cluded more than 400 bald and golden
eagles, 72 peregrine falcons, 45 osprey,
even a whooping crane.

Nearly 50 per cent of all the patients
completely recover and are set free.

An additional 25 per cent are left
with some disability and are sent to
captive breeding programs to produce
eggs and foster chicks for placement in

nests, or are used in educational exhi~

bits.

The remaining animals either die
from their injuries, or are euthanized
because there is no hope.

“It grieves me to put a bird down,”
Redig says. “I try to carry them as far
as is humanely possible, especially the
endangered species such as the bald
eagle or peregrine falcon.”

Despite such sad episodes, Redig’s
busy clinic nomially is quietly upbeat
and fueled by a sense of mission. Con-
valeseing eagles bathe and preen them—
selves in a child’s wading pool. Owls
on the mend exercise by swooping '
down the hallways. Hawks and falcons
are. flown outdoors like kites, learning
again to soar. Orphaned bald eaglets sit
like art students curiously studying

“Baby raptors will imprint on the
first moving object that provides them
with food when they open their eyes,”
Redig says, smiling. “We go to ex—
tremes to make sure they know what
they are.”

Completely protected by state and

federal laws, raptors are strictly

. eontroled by permits for purpos—

es of rehabilitation, research,
education or falconry. It is ille—
gal, in fact, to shoot, trap or
keep any wild bird as a pet,
except English sparrows,
pigeons and starlings.

shotgun pellets and bullets thatOreﬂeet the loathing of
raptor haters who since Colonial times have con-—
sidered them vermm. ‘

Such hazards aeCount for most of the bloody messes
that Redig routinely repairs—the broken legs and
wings, the crushed toes, the battered bodies and heads.
Nearly. half his eagles carry “lead residue in their blood
resulting from eating game birds wounded by lead

“Trauma causes about 75 per cent of our admis-
sions, particularly fractures of the long bones,” Redig
says. “Birds are fairly easy to work on, surgically, but
their bones are very thin. They shatter when they
“break, so lots of times” we’re dealing with fragments
and splinters. Because the bones lack substance, we
can’t implant screws to plate them together. Instead,
we use a lot of wires and pins.

“Leg fractures also cause trouble because birds really
do need both limbs. We suspend them on slings, use
special bandaging—all to protect that one good foot.
Otherwise, they’ll try to stand on it and develop pres-
sure necrosis sores, like bedsores, on the bottom of the
‘ foot. That’s a real hassle to treat.”

There always have been raptor lovers and raptor
haters, as peroeptively characterized by Hope Ryden,
an eloquent Writer on nature. .

Raptor lovers, like "the birds they admired, writes
Ryden, “were often loners—independent, quiet in—
dividuals who did not easily band together to take
action. That type of group‘ behavior would be more
typical of a crow, a bird that sometimes acts With its
kind to mob a solitary hawk.” ' —

Raptor haters, on the other hand, were “usually
vocal and politically active, and their motives were
often self-serving. They looked upon every hawk, eagle
and owl as potential competitors in the sport of hunt—
ing game birds. Therefore, these birds that hunt birds
man wants to hunt were themselves to be hunted.
During most of our country’s history, the raptor
haters have had their way.” ‘ .

Environmental activism in the 19705 helped achieve
a balance. The Migratory Bird Treaty of 1973 vorded
all state laWs that permitted the killing of birds of
prey. Other legislation listed endangered specres and
provided for their restoration, and banned the
pesticide DDT that destroyed their eggs. Various
spokesmen and advocates arose for many wrld animal

It doesn’t hurt your cause if the advocate also is one
of the world’s few top-notch surgeons specializing in
birds; thus raptors are fortunate to have Pat Redig, 38,
a raptor lover if ever there was one. .

, .A native Minnesotan, Redig grew up in Hibbing

With a respect for 'all the myriad pieces of nature’s
\puzzle and a fascination with birds of prey. By age 9,
“he was ﬂying a hand-reared sparrow hawk [kestrel] on
a line. The nest year, he tried to emulate his pet’s
power by burlding a hang glider, but crashed on the
test ﬂi ht. At 14,,he patched up an owl’swing, using
chloro orm and a pin.

{That was the start—the beginning of a deeply deter-
mined avian Dr. Dolittle, who, with a handful of col-
leagues, has written the book on the medical care of
these unjustly maligned birds. .

“The timing was right [in 1972] for us to start a
rehab program,” he says. “However, we went into this
Without any expectation of longevity or public sup-
port. It was .somethin we were interested ﬁn doing, we
liked dorng it, and we elt it was the right"'thing to do.

 

,1

The response has been amazing.”
.Founded on a shoestring by Redig and avian phv-
Siologist Gary Duke, the RRRP now has a $245,000
annual budget, treats 350 predatory birds a year—

? including 50 eagles—and relies on a cadre of devoted

volunteers. Supported by the university, some public
funds and many private donations, the program re—

; cently received a $1.6 million private grant to con-
‘ struct its own building. .

As a young veterinary surgeon, Redig discovered —

_‘ thatno one even knew how to anesthetize such highly
. sensrtive birds. He and Duke killed the first three owls
j they operated on. Soon, all parties got better—in the
RRRP’s second year, 120 birds were treated and re—
3 leased to freedom. '

The most common large raptors, the redtailed hawk

. and great horned owl, are Redig’s most numerous pa-

tients. He has treated 609 great horned owls and 554
redtails—agarn, a remarkable ﬁgure.

Ecologists have learned how important such birds

1 are in controling rodents. A single redtail, for example,

Birds of prey, from their perch atop the food chain,
also serve as crucial environmental indicators. If
there’s trouble in the raptor population, there’s some-
thing wrong down the line—some disease or pollutant
that may directly affect the lives and health of human
beings. > ‘

. In general, Redig’s patients, though often in pain,
"act stoical. They handle captivity well. Such imposing
birds have distinct individual personalities. Observing
them, it is impossible to be unimpressed by their in-
. nate dignity and the freedom they represent.

The beautiful, maje-‘ic and intelligent golden

eagles—the favorite 0’? most raptor lovers—relate

__,, __ ....o..

readily with humans; the tough and volatile bald eagles
never do: Redtailed hawks project an easygoing, stable
personality; they’re very likable birds. Owls also seem
laid back. On the other hand, goshawks, Cooper’s
hawks, and sharpshinned hawks are “nut cases,” say
their doctors, and rarely accept their situation.

As word of the Minnesota vets’ altruism has spread,
Redig’s sick bay has overflowed with hawks and owls
of all types, including burrowing owls, barn owls,

’ barred owls, sereech owls, even Arctic snowy owls that
have drifted far astray seeking food. The rare falcons,
and the magniﬁcent eagles—of which more than 200
have been released—mirror the recovery of these en—
dangered species.

Redig, in fact, has as a sideline become the principal
figure behind the reintroduction of the peregrine fal—
. con in the Midwest. As the voluntary agent, or broker,
for release programs, he already has successfully freed
56 peregrines in his state, and last month was overjoy—
ed to find the birds gradually returning to their histor—
ic nesting sites in cliffs along the Mississippi River.
Chicago’s five peregrines, recently released from their
perch high atop University Hall of the University of
Illinois at Chicago, were obtained by Redig.

Among raptors, bald eagles are particularly vulnera-
ble to trapping and shooting, he says. “Trapping is
practiced when eagles are wintering; and, being basi—
cally scavengers, they often are attracted to baited
traps. Unlike mammalian predators, which appear to

develop a certain wariness, bald eagles have a curiosity ~

that lures them to these things with horrible results.
“Trapping injuries are devastating to birds, no mat-

ter what anybody tells you. You cannot just take a

bird out of a trap and set it loose. It may look okay,

but within days its toes will turn black, freeze and fall

3ft". lnfecl'éon sets in. Without treatment, the bard will

‘ “And a few people still are blasting away at bald
f eagles,” Redrg says wearily. “When we X—ray eagles
that have beeen caught in traps or hit by cars, we find
g that over half of them contain shotgun pellets.”
; . Pestrcrdc poisoning remains a problem, particularly
in ertres that put out strychnine to control pigeons.
Strychnme kills in 45 seconds. Dead owls sometimes
, are found with poisoned pigeons they had been eating
811“. ”clenched in their talons.
,‘ Fishing tackle also gives Redig nightmares: “You
5 hook a big fish, it breaks the line and gets away. That
-‘ fish may end up in a bald eagle’s nest, and when a
3 young eagle eats the fish, he also eats your walleye rig,
spinner, beads and monoﬁlament line. Our X—rays will
: show hooks lacerating the bird all the way down into
the stomach. The surgery required is massive.”
f ‘ Surgery rs measured in hours, though, and it will
take many months before Redig’s birds are strong and
agile enough to be released. On the average, it costs
$2,000 to spare an eagle—and more than half of them
brought to the clinic will survive—and at least $500 to
heal an owl.

“We release a lot of eagles every year,” Redig says,
“and although I’d rather sneak out by myself and free
the bird along the Mississippi, I decided that was, just
too selfish. This is something to be shared with
everybody.

“It’s really a celebration, I think, when we can turn
a healthy bird-back to the wild. So we get as many
people involved as we can.” ,

_Redrg’s patients arrive from everywhere [Republic
Arrlrneshelps out by shipping the birds free]. They
come from vets, zoos, naturalists, game management
professronals—but also from concerned bird lovers
’who routinely drive hundreds of miles to Redig’s clin—
ic, arrrvrng exhausted with avhurt hawk or owl—or
even a robin or a goslingé-for the vets to save.

Each bird is banded, and Redig has seen some re-
peaters over the years. ' r

“We fixed a rough—legged hawk and set him loose,
and srx years later we got him back. He’d been caught
1 in a trap. There also was a bald eagle that had been
shot. We ﬁxed him, freed him and two weeks later, he
I was shot again. The same bone was broken, though
about two inches higher than before. Unfortunately, he
i didn’t make it out of here the second time around.”

Despite the violence he has witnessed, Redig is thril-
led to 'document an extremely important change. No
longer must he so often work in furious temper, oper-
ating around the clock, despairing at the stupidity of
his own specres. ' ‘

“During our first four years—until l976—about a
‘ third of our birds had been’shot. Since then, there’s
been a steady trend downward. People aren’t so quick
2 to shoot them anymore. We’re now running only 5
a per cent, although our total patient population re—
mains fairly stable.
_ “This is one of the most encouraging and joyous
, things about our work. It has been largely because of
education that this has occurred.
. “I. think we’re going thru a maturation in our soci-
5 ety in which .we regard the wild creatures on this plan-
; et not as objects to be merely destroyed or exploited,
' but to be valued and appreciated.
“Our statistics show this change in attitude toward
; the great predatory birds. To someone like me, the
. change makes all the difference. I think this is an
' absolutely wonderful time to be alive.”

“Let’s go find some more naive

Not quite. They carry lit-

Not a gun in sight.

And here we have the crocodile — bru-
tal, fierce, primitive, dangerous.

You can’t be serious. Here’s one hiding
its head in the sand. It thinks we can’t see
1 .

The moon is full, the night air thick
with mosquitoes and deerflies, and in the
distance a chuck-will’s—widow is calling
plaintively. Off to the northeast, lights
glitter at the Florida Power & Light Tur-

key Point nuclear power plant near
Homestead. ,

In the bow of the airboat, ecologist
Frank Mazzotti, headlamp on his brow,
stares intently at the canal bank. At his
side, Jim Lindsay sweeps each bank with
a battery-powered 300,000-candlepower
quartz beam light.

Suddenly the light picks up near the
shore a red glint like a pair of miniature
bike reflectors. They are the eyes of an
American crocodile. ~

At the controls, Mike D’Orazio heads
the airboat toward the bank. In the tangle
of a sprawling nicker bean bush, Lindsay
makes a deft swoop with a pair of special-
ly designed tongs, and in a moment an 8-
'inch baby crocodile, soft—skinned, wide-
eyed, lies calmly in the palm of Mazzot-

. ‘ ti’s hand.

“For a crocodile it’s pretty photoge-
nic,” Mazzotti says. “PeOple who think of
crocodiles as ugly, brutish creatures al-
ways say, ‘Ohh, cute.’ ” '

3. . The baby is one of tour hatchlings the

trio captured, measured and weighed the
night before. They recognize it by the
notches Mazzotti clipped in its scutes, the

" bony, scalelike protrusions along the top
é of its tail. That clipped pattern is its very
, own identification tag and will remain on
1‘ the animal for life.

The hatchling’s fat little stomach holds
the remains of its egg yolk, which will
nourish it during its first few days of life.
It already has sharp teeth but doesn’t try
to use them. It is weighed, measured, the

'1 data recorded in the red notebook. It has
3 its photo taken, then is slipped gently
7 back into the shallow water.

“We’re very gentle with the small ani-

' mals,” says Mazzotti. “I’d let it bite me
E rather than hurt it. We’re considerably»
i firmer with the larger animals.”

The airboat moves out into the canal

{ again. We look for a larger crocodile, but
not too large. Mazzotti and his crew have

permits to capture and measure only ju-
veniles, those under 1.5 meters.

it’s good to be

Those adolescents are harder to
, grab than the babies. Many at Tur-

caught and measured a time or
two, and they’ve caught on to the
routine. We spot one, but before it

ally in July, the researchers go out
in the airboat or canoe at least four
nights a week. They work at night
because crocodiles are relatively

' easy to spot by eyeshine, but almost

impossible to see during the day.

Once hatching is over, monitoring
is done less often. '

This is Mazzotti’s eighth summer
of tracking, weighing and measur-
ing crocodiles.

“I have no stories to tell you

-. about being bitten,” he says. “In

this business it’s good to be a bit of
a coward — you don’t get hurt. I’m
very safety-conscious, to the point
of being paranoid. You don’t make
mistakes.”

Actually, only two species, the
Nilecrocodile of Africa and the
saltwater crocodile of southern

(Asia, ever attack people.

“This one is not at all like the
Nile crocodile that you see in Tar-
zan movies,” says Mazzotti. “It’s
less aggressive even than the alli-
gator. The American crocodile is
very shy and runs away very fast.
It poses less of a threat to humans
than the alligator. I’ve never had a
crocodile defend its nest. You rare-
ly see one near the nest.”

Unlike the nest of an alligator,’

iwhich usually is dug amid dense
ivegetation, the crocodile digs her
- nesting hole in an exposed sandy

beach or marl bank; at Turkey
Point it is dug in the rocky berms,
spoil piled up when canals were
dug. Not much grows on these bar—
ren banks. Mostof the vegetation,
mainly Australian pine, has been
killed off by herbicides. Because

 




the canals serve to cool water from
the power plant, an unobstructed
current of air across the water is
necessary. .

The mother crocodile digs down
a foot or more, lays her eggs, cov-
ers them up and gOes away. She
will come back to visit the nest dur-
ing the incubation period, as often
as once a week.

During these visits she drags her
tail along the ground, leaving an S-
shaped trail that is one of the only
ways the researchers can find the

Remains of fish, birds and rep
tiles have been found in crocodiles’
stomachs, along with stones. Sever-
al theories exist regarding the pur-
pose-of the stones: Some biologists
say they are swallowed for ballast,

. while others believe they serve the

same purpose as gizzard stones in
chickens, to grind up food after it is
eaten.

There is also an old myth that a
croc swallows a stone for every
person it eats.

“That’s probably the one [theory]

 

that’s not true,” says Mazzotti.
nests. “We also look for upturned ‘
soil and disturbed vegetation,” says
Lindsay.

Some years, however, the nests
are never found and where the
hatchlings come from is unknown.

The mother’s visits increase as
hatching time nears. Without her
help, the babies cannot dig out of ,
their nest. Sensing that the eggs are ‘
about to hatch, she opens the nest
hole, and as the hatchlings break
out of their shells she picks one or
more up in her mouth and carries
them to the edge of the water.

But a few of the tiny creatures
may not be able to break through
the hard shell. Then the mother will
take the egg in her mouth and roll it
gently between her tongue and
teeth to release the baby.

She may carry her offspring as
far as 100 meters away from the
nest to put them in the water.

“They can be born, hit the water
and swim,” says Mazzotti.

Although the young are born with
tiny teeth and are able to fend for
themselves immediately, the moth-

er stays around for one or two
nights before going on her way. -- -

While a mother alligator once
charged Mazzotti, he has never
seen a crocodile try to defend her
young or even to respond to their
grunting distress calls.

Disaster from many sources
threatens both eggs and hatchlings.
They can be hurt by too much or too ‘
little water. Nests can be flooded or 7 "
dry out. Raccoons often dig up and
eat the eggs before they hatch. Fire
ants sometimes kill the hatchlings.
Lindsay once saw a hatchling being
drowned by a blue crab. Large tar- r
pon and snook, and ospreys and
large wading birds such as herons
feed on them, too. ‘ '

Hatchvlings that surviVe find
plenty of food. Small fish are plen- '
tiful in the cooling canals. Hatch-
lings also eat insects, worms, crabs ‘
and other small crustaceans, “any-
thing small enough for them to bite; -
They eat everything that moves

and some things that don’t,” says
Mazzotti.

he only American crocodiles

found in the wild in the United

States are in Florida, which

probably is perfectly OK with

most of the people in the other
49 states.

At one time crocodiles ranged up the
east coast of Florida to the Daytona
Beach area, but they were almost wiped
out by hunters early in the century. Alli—
gators suffered a similar fate but have
made a dramatic comeback in recent
years. Crocodiles, on the other hand,
found themselves on the US. Endangered
Species List.

Crocodiles, which live in swamps, riv-
ers, ponds, lakes and bays in warm areas
in North and South America, Africa, Asia
and Australia, are cousins of alligators
but have a look of their own. The alliga-
tor’s snout is wide and rounded; the croco-
dile’s is longer, thinner and pointed.

Still unsure? Look at the animal when
its mouth is closed. (Most peOple would
figure that’s safer, anyway.) When an alli-
gator closes its mouth its teeth are con-
cealed; the crocodile has a large tooth
protruding on each side of the jaw.

The croc, a secretive and unsociable

creature, doesn’t respond to environmen-
tal management as well as the gator,
which is one reason it is in trouble. Key
Largo, Everglades National Park and
Turkey Point near Homestead are the
only three places in the state where they
breed, although an occasional stray turns
up elsewhere. One even found its way to
the Gulf Coast of Florida in 1977.

The Florida population of Crocodylus
acutus was placed on the US. Endan-
gered Species List in 1975, and in 1978 a
study was begun at Florida Power &
Light’s Turkey Point power plant to learn
the effects of warm water, effluent from
the plant and salinity on the handful of

crocodiles living in the shadow of the
huge facility. For the past nine years,
Frank Mazzotti of Penn State University
has been observing the crocodiles at Tur-
key Point and Everglades National Park,
as well as in Mexico and Jamaica. (Penn
State has a contract with FPL to monitor
the crocodiles at Turkey Point and with
the Army Corps of Engineers to study
those in Everglades National Park. A
similar study is being done in north Key
Largo by wildlife biologist Paul Moler of
the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish
Commission.)

Can they coexist?

Mazzotti had been working with chi—
tons, a kind of mollusk, and finishing
work for his master’s degree at the Uni-
versity of Miami when he went to work
for Everglades National Park. “I wanted

to work outside for a while before going
on for a Ph.D.,” he recalls. It was at the
park that he became interested in croco-
diles and alligators.

He describes his work at Turkey Point
as an effort to document that the power
plant can be compatible with the croco-
dile’s environment.

It is a management program, not a
breeding project, he emphasizes.

Cooling canals
seem to foster
crocodile nesting

“It’s a legal responsibility to. an
endangered species,” he explains.
“In the future we are going to have
to solve the conservation of endan—
gered species by forming a part-
nership with them”

The 1,650-acre site that Mazzotti
monitors is about 5 miles long and 3
miles wide and contains 168 miles
of canals. Although some of the ca-
nals existed before the FPL plant
was built, most of the vast network
of waterways was dug for the
plant’s cooling canal system.

The system is a series of alter—
nating 100-meter-wide canals and
90-meter-wide earthen berms. It is
along these canals, whose waters

the crocodiles live and nest. They
spend most of their time in the wa-

bask in the sun as alligators do or to
lay their eggs —- hard, oval, white
and somewhat longer and larger

Crocodiles long have lived in the

says Mazzotti. While he is cautious
about making predictions, he calls
it a good'sign that three nests were
found there this summer. Most
years only two are found, so it ap-
pears that a new female has
reached breeding age.

While a mature female usually
lays about 39 eggs, the new nester
laid only 15 eggs this year The»:

figure, Mazzotti says, but the num-
ber of adults and juveniles i‘s uncer-
tain. About 20 nesting females have
been counted. statewide. The best
guess for the number of animals of
both sexes past the hatchling stage
is 130 to 140 in Everglades Nation-
al Park, 70 in north Key Largo and
20 to 22 at Turkey Point.

Females can reach a length of 10
feet and weigh 220 pounds. The
largest male Mazzotti ever has
come across measured 121/2 feet
and weighed around 500 pounds.

In the Everglades and at Turkey
Point there seems to be one male to
about three females; in Key Largo
the male-female ratio is more
evenly balanced.

It is not unusual for large males
to have a harem, Mazzotti says. He
finds their courtship behavior fas-
cinating. “They swim arm in arm,
blow bubbles at each other. The
male will bite the female in the
back of the neck — very human.”
Nevertheless, mating marks the
end of the male’s involvement, and

off he goes.

Hope for the future

Mazzotti has learned much about
the crocodile but he wants to know
more — more about the effects of
water temperature and salinity, for
example. Lab studies have indicat-
ed crocodiles do better in cooler

and less saline areas. Mazzotti -.

wants to find out if soil moisture
and temperature of the nest deter-
mines the hatchlings’ sex, as it does
with alligators. Crocodiles, alliga-
tors and turtles carry no sex chro-
mosomes and gender is not deter-
mined at conception.

And above all, he’d like to see
them make a comeback as the alli-
gators have done. '

The program at Turkey Point
costs the company about $40,000 a
year, according to Ross Wilcox,
chief ecologist for FPL in its Juno
Beach office.

“One of the things we’re striving
for is to establish compatibility of

says. “Some people are not aware
of the steps we take to be compati-
ble. Sometimes it is as simple as
knowing the animal is there and do-

ing its thing. We want to know how

well they are doing.”

This has not aiways been the phi-
lOSOphy of the power company,
which was the subject of a great 5
deal of criticism from environmen- .
talists in the mid-’70s. The compa- .
ny’s original plan was not to build a
cooling system at Turkey Point but .
to dump effluent into Biscayne
Bay. Biologists worried that even
slightly changing the water tem-
perature in the shallow bay could
mean a loss of marine life, recalls
Charles Lee, senior vice president
of the Florida Audubon Society.

The Environmental Protection

Agency, US. Fish and Wildlife Ser-

vice and other agencies became in-
volved and as a result of negotia-
tions, FPL agreed to build the
cooling canal system. ,

“FPL has been involved in some
big environmental controversies in
the past, but they have changed
their attitude. They have done
some good things in the biological
research area,” Lee says.

Wilcox agrees. “That’s one of the
reasons [the FPL office of] environ-
mental affairs was started. We
started to encounter some signifi-
cant environmental issues at Tur-
key Point.”

Wilcox, whose specialty is ma-
rine ecology, also supervises other
FPL wildlife projects involving
manatees, sea turtles, bald eagles
and wood storks along with a num-
ber of programs involving what he
calls protected species —— migra—
tory birds, ospreys and some
hawks, all protected by federal
law. .

Thomas Stice, wildlife biologist
at the Florida Game and Fresh Wa-
ter Fish Commission regional of-
fice in West Palm Beach, says the
FPL crocodile project is “very
helpful in comparison with nothing
being done. At least they are trying
to do what’s right and get us infor-
mation and help that. species along.
From what I know about it, it’s go-
ing quite well and we’re pleased. I
wish more companies would take a
more active interest.” .

S *rne gators at Zoo
ace future in retall

 

By JOHN HILL

The Orlando Sentinel

" ORLANDO -—- This year he’s a

long, leathery photo subject. Next
, year he’s an attache case and a spe-
jcialty item in the delicatessen case.
He’s one of 1,000 alligators that
Gatorland Zoo plans to butcher and
skin each year now that the popular
tourist attraction has added gator

hides and meat to its exhibits of the '

living, breathing reptiles.

Gatorland, known for its “Gator
Jumparoo Show” and alligator c01-
lection, Opened a slaughterhouse on
its grounds in south Orange County
' nearly three weeks ago. Owner
Frank Godwin plans to ease into
production during the next few

Weeks; his goal is 1,000 skinned alli- ,,

gators a year.

i Such a pace would allow Gator- 2

land to replace each year’s “crop”
with the 1,000 eggs the attraction

hatches each year, Godwin said. It

also would maintain the attrac-

tion’s alligator population at 5,000 ;

reptiles.

Godwin, whose family has owned ,

”the zoo since 1950, said the attrac-
‘ijtion will continue to rely on tour-
;‘ism as its main source of income.

; But he hopes the slaughterhouse I

will provide a financial hedge
iagainst those years when tourism
:slumps.

Gatorland’s gift shop is offering
152,000 alligator-hide attache cases,
.3800 handbags, $300 boots - and
cans of Gator Chowder that sell for
$2.29. Next month Godwin plans to
’open the Gator Deli, featuring alli-
gator meat that customers ‘can
take home and cook themselves.

“It seemed like the natural way
to go,” he said. “We were too de-
pendent on tourism. With the satu-
ration of tourist attractions in this
area, you have to be unique to sur-
alive.”

The slaughterhouse has created
.a caste system at the,36-year-old
. zoo. There are “show” alligators,
the ones who live in large pools and
perform in the Jumparoo show; and
“meat” alligators, who spend most
of their lives in glassed-in pens eat-
ing a special diet designed to fatten
them for the kill.

Gatorland workers slay eaeh
reptile with a blow to the base of
the skull that Severs the spinal

 

cord. The butchering -— Gatorland

.prefers the term “harvesting” — is ’

f done in a small, refrigerated build-
:ing off limits to the public, Godwin
Csaid.

. A 6-foot-long"alligator yields
about 20 pounds of meat in addition
to its valuable hide, Godwin said.
The hides are sent to tanneries in
New Jersey and Georgia for pro-
cessing and conversion into wal-
lets, handbags, boots or brief cases.
The only part of the hide that can’t
“be used is the top of the head and
the bony stretch along the animal’s
back, he said. .

The meat, which sells for about
310 a pound, is kept at the zoo for
;sale as freshly cooked “gator bites”
or sent to a Louisiana cannery for
use in the gator chowder.

Godwin’s operation is not unique,
but it is the biggest in Florida, ac-
cording to Dennis David, the state
Game and Fresh Water Fish Com-
:mission’s coordinator for alligator
programs.

, Killing wild alligators is illegal,
David said, but alligators raised on
bommercial farms may be slaugh-
Itered.

. Such farms have been Operating
in Florida since the 1930s. Although
:the game commission has never
;been swamped by requests for the
grequired state license, the number
Zof farms has risen sharply in the
past decade. ‘ ’
That is because the state’s alliga-
tor population, once threatened

‘ with extinction, recovered to the

point where, in 1977, alligators
were upgraded from an endan-
gered to a threatened species.
“There were six to eight of them
in the 19608 and ’705,” David said.
“Into the 19803, we have about 26
licensed.” Those 26 farms together
have about 37,000 alligators, David
Said, led by Gatorland with 5,000,
although only 3,000 of those are in-
;ended for harvesting. ,
Gatorland’s farm runs on a
three-year cycle, the length of time
it takes an alligator to grow to 6

3 feet in length — the optimum size

 

,,_____

 

for meat and hides. ‘

The threeyear cycle starts in
early summer, when the females
lay their eggs, Godwin said. The
mothers are so protective of their
eggs that they must be raped and
pulled away so the eggs can be col-
lected. The eggs are then stored in
a hot,‘humid storeroom under wet
grass until they hatch about two
months later.

In their second year the reptiles
are moved into another set of heat-
ed quarters to make room for the
next generation. In their third year
they are moved to open pens to be
fattened up even more before being

' slaughtered.

Heat and humidity are essential
to fattening ’an alligator, Godwin
said. “They’re cold-blooded ——

3 when it gets colder, they st0p eat-

ing,” Godwin said. “When they’re

[heated year-round, they eat year-

roundf’

Throughout the process the rep:
tiles are fed ground meat and fish.
Godwin said he keeps an eye out for
particularly heavy males and fe-
males, or gators that grow faster
than normal, because those attri-

butes can be passed on to genera-

tions through selective breeding.

 

 

 




 

 

a!“ Pity the poor Los Angeles Zoo. While it is
generally acknowledged to be one of the best in
the nation, its reputation pales in comparison to
the famous San Diego Zoo just a few miles south.
/ N ow its standing may be further weakened by the
recent controversial. firing of its former director,
Warren Thomas. ‘

, It would be easier to comment on Thomas’
abrupt dismissal in June by James E. Hadaway,
general manager of the city’s Department of
Recreation and Parks, if more information had
been made public on the matter. Unfortunately,
Hadaway announced his decision with a bare
minimum of detail, saying that it followed a
disciplinary hearing 'and was the culmination of
“continuous internal problems at the zoo” in recent
years. '

Thomas then sued, demanding to be reinstated in
the zoo director’s job and asking the court to
prevent the city from hiring another zoo director
until the matter is settled. City attorneys have told
Hadaway to say no more because of the pending

 

litigation, so public diScussion of Thomas’ firing,

has unfortunately become largely a matter of
speculation and gossip.

‘ Thomas’ detractors point to thecriticism of his
management of the zoo two years ago in an audit
by the city’s chief administrative officer. They

suggest that although Thomas, a veterinarian,”
might be a fine zoologist, he was a poor adminis- .

trator. His supporters, on, the other hand, play up
his good reputation as a. scientist. They say that
he got into hot water precisely because he was not
a bureaucrat. _

In all fairness to Thomas, the last few years at
the Los Angeles Zoo have not been marked only
by trouble; There have been bright spots like the
successful drive to build a new koala house in 1983,
the special panda exhibit that coincided with the
1984 Olympic Games, and the recent construction
of a new children’s zoo. The Los Angeles Zoo is
making progress, and zoo experts nationally give

LOS ANGELES TIMES - August 5, 3986

$200: Go for the Best

Thomas credit for that. So does the.Great'er Los
Angeles Zoo Assn., the nonprofit corporation
whose members and volunteers help support and
run the zoo. ‘

Yet even the zoo’s biggest boosters admit that
it’s not as good as it could be. As almost anyone
who has visited the San Diego Zoo will tell you,
the Los Angeles Zoo is not in the same league.
The reason for that may be less poor management
than outdated management. The chief administra-
tive officer’s review in 1984 pointed out that the
zoo could benefit if its management and control
were transferred from the city to a private, non-
profit zoo society. That is how virtually every

[well-known municipal zoo in the country, includ--

ing San Diego’s and the Bronx Zoo in New York
City, is run. City officials have not followed up on
that suggestion. ~ ‘ , .
. In 1985 the zoo association studied the possibility
of taking over the zoo, and submitted a discussion
paper outlining a pOSsible management plan. The
paper was turned down by the city, however. The
association plan envisioned the group’s managing
the zoo, with the city providing personnel and
paying most operating costs. The arrangement was
clearly too one-sided and raised too many ques-
tions about personnel matters and liability to be
readily accepted by the city. But the discussions
should not have ended there. The zoo association
and city officials should go back to the drawing

- board until they devise a mutually acceptable plan

to begin getting the Los Angeles Zoo into step with
other zoological parks around the nation. _ ,

Rather than lying low while the Thomas con-
troversy plays itself out, Mayor Tom Bradley
and other public officials who can affect the zoo’s
future should use the public attention that they
have right now to move forward with efforts to
redefine that future. If they do, Thomas’ firing,

however it is resolved, will have served a bene-

ficial purpose—helping move the Los Angeles Zoo
from being very good toward being the very best.

DENVER POST - August 8,

 

By Robert Kowaiski

Denver Post Staff Writer

A proposed downtOWn aquarium would
become Denver’s third most popular tour- ;
ist attraction -— drawing nearly 1 million g

; visitors a year, but still not. enough to pay
’ for its construction the project’s consul-
tants have concluded.

In a preliminary report to be released
late next week, the consuii ants estimated
that the-aquarium Would, east $12 million to
$15 million to build in City Park, or about
5 $30 million at one of two downtown sites.
Admission fees and revenues from con-

cessidn stands would co 1 15 only annual op- .-

erating costs for the aquatic exhibit — not

‘ its initial construction price, reports‘the ,

" “Cambridge Seven Assoeiaies Inc., a Mas-
_ sachusetts firm retained by Denver to de-
’ sign the aquarium.

“I don’t think any fariiity like this re-

5 , tires its own, debt,” Cambridge consultant
Frank Zaremba said Thursday. “The capi~ '

tal cost has to be I‘alSi 11 either through
fund-raising or bond issues.’

The consultants have narrowed poten-
1131 locations for the aquarium to City
Park, a site near the Union Station in the
Central Platte Valley or at the site of
Currigan Hall Convention Center.

If constructed at either downtown loca
tion, the aquarium would include about

100, 000 square feet of space, making it_

slightly larger than Currigan.
If built in City Park the facility would
include 40, 000 to 50, 000 square feet of

. ;. space, most of which would be constructed
‘ ' underground to help quell complaints of
neighbors oppoSing any new attractions
near the Denver Zoo. .
" , For several years, zoo offiCials have

wanted to add an aquatic exhibit to other

.‘ animal displays in the City Park zoo. In
'- 1982, veters approved a $6 million bond is-

sue, half Of which is earmarked for the
aquarium addition.

The Denver Zoological Foundation has .
raised an additional $3 million to $4 million
for the project; said Zoo Director Clayton
,Fre‘iheit. ‘

“We, of c0urse, feel that a complete zoo-
logical park ought to include aquatic ani-
mals, ” Freiheit said. “It’s a difference of
whether you want a freestanding cultural
tourist attraction or another exhibit at the
zoo. I’m trying to keep a totally open

' mind. ”
Cambridge Seven, hired in January to .

conduct the $175.1l00 study. favors the larg- ;

er, dewntown proposals. The company has

, designed aquariums now operating in Bal ‘

timore and Boston.

Denver may try to recruit the help of
the zoo to raise money for one of the down-
town locations, said mayoral aide Sandy
Drew.

_“The city has not said that they would
foot the bill, nor has the zoo board said
that they wouldnot foot the; bill,” Drew
said.

The consultants estimated a downtown
aquarium would attract 750,000 to 900,000

TAMPA TRIBUNE — August 10, 1986

Zebras roam Swaziland’s Miilwane Wildlife Sanctuary. About 4 percent of the country’s land i " protected.

‘Progress taming the wild of Africa

The tale of what happened to‘
'Swaziland’s majestic wildlife tells
also what is happening all over the
continent below the Sahara.

By DON CALDWELL
Tribune Correspondent

MBABANE, Swaziland — Think of Africa: Thunder-
ous packs of zebra, elephant, giraffe and buck charging
into the horizon, passing thorny acacia trees and leaving
behind blinding clouds of dust.

The image is grand and glorious. But outdated.

Over. most of the continent, the wilds are wild no
longer.

The demise of the majestic animals here in Swazi-
land is a tragic tale similar to that told all over sub-Saha-
ran Africa.

It’s the story of seemingly limitless wildlife giving
way to the hunter’s gun, the poacher’s snare and the
march of progress.

And it all happened so recently, and so very, very
fast.

“If, at the time, anybody had suggested ”that the ani-

vanishing animals, founded by Swaziland-born Ted Reilly.

__mals were destined to be shot at and
all killed off it wouldn’t have made
any sense to me,” says Swaziland-
born Ted Reilly, 48, the father of
local nature conservation, who
remembers driving through the
country’s hot, bushy eastern low-
lands as recently as 1950 and seeing
swarms of impala, wildebeest and
zebra. .

“I always figured there were
more where they come from.”

For centuries that seemed the
case.

Before the arrival frOm the north
of the Nguni-speaking ancestors of
today’s Swazis in the 17005, bushman
hunter-gatherers lived here in har-
mony with nature, in untamed land.

Then the northern clans came
with their ﬂocks of domestic ani-
mals and tools of agriculture.

Change came to the land, but
slowly, and scientists say a vast and
varied wildlife population still
thrived: kudu, lion, wildebeest,
zebra, impala, giraffe, elephant, os-
trich, warthog, rhinoceros, eland
and leopard.

In the 18405, white farmers,
hunters, missionaries and colonial-
ists began coming from South Africa
and Britain to this landlocked king-
dom at the southern tip of Mozam-
bique. The pace of change quick-
ened.

The goal of those early settlers:
to tame the land.

And the wildlife be damned.

“Anything in conﬂict with man’s
attempt to tame the land was not tol-
erated,” says Reilly. “It was
stamped out.“

Settlers in South Africa favored
Swaziland as a winter hunting
ground. One of the earliest victims
of the hunt (was the elephant, which
used tomigrate freely from Mozam-
bique and South Africa up the many
rivers that flow east across Swazi-
land. Soon only the occasional stray
elephant was found here.

Much of the game that survived
the hunts was killed by an epidemic
of rinderpast -— a cattle disease —-
that swept through Swaziland in
1895.

But, in. those days, many species
of wildlife freely migrated over vast
areas of this corner of Africa, and
soon game found its way back into
Swaziland. Reilly says that within 10
years of the plague white hunters
again were sending wagonloads of
game meat to market in South Afri-
ca. .
The British colonial government
in Swaziland did little to control the

slaughter. Those game laws that

were enacted were rarely enforced, ‘

Reilly says.
in em? 0" (“we gave:

reseryes on chunks of land covering
about 12 percent of the country. But

 

their hearts weren’t in it: At the end ~

of World War I the land was sold
cheaply to returning soldiers as
farms and ranches.
Reilly’s father, an Irishman who
settled in Swaziland after coming to
South Africa at the turn of the cen-

tury to fight in the Anglo-Boer War, ‘

bought one of the farms on the Ing-
wavuma River at Nsolo, in southeast
Swaziland. He bought it as a “shoot-
ing box,” a place to go to hunt for
waterbuck, wildebeest, buffalo, os-
trich, leopard and lion.

That was in the 19205. In the
19305, so many wildebeest appeared
in Swaziland — probably a mass

. migration — that the colonial farm- .

ers Considered them a plague and
combatted them with machine guns
and poison.

_So plentiful were the wildebeest,
hunters found it easy and profitable
to fill up their wagons with only the

. tails of the animals ~— to be sold as
knife sheaths or fly-swatters — leav-
ing the carcasses out in the bush.

As recently as the late 19405, as
bus, nicknamed the “Impala Ex-
press,” carted about a thousand
dead impala a week from Manzini to
Johannesburg.

And, Reilly says, driving east
from Manzini into the lowlands in
1950, “your biggest hazard on the
road was colliding with wildlife”.

But modernization, which im-
proved the lives of the people,
spelled the end for animals.

A network of new roads into the
bushland made once-remote areas
accessible to hunters and poachers; ,
improved health and sanitation led
to a booming population that needed
a place to live; anti-malarial medi-

' cines made the low-lying areas suit-
able for human settlement, .which
squeezed but the animals; and
sprawling sugar plantations that pro-
vided jobs took over land that was
once home to wildlife.

The animals had fewer and
fewer safe places to run to.

An east-tcwwest railway line built

in the early ‘68:; ca: ‘l2: twat: low—
lands in half, and free-flowing game
died against the fence.
. Reilly saw wildebeest, zebra, im-
pala and kudu lying dead along the
railway fence,-5tymied in their at-
tempts to migrate from north to
south.

“They didn’t know what fences
were,” he says. ’

Today, the roads through the
bush are likely to be blocked only by
goats and cattle. There are but a few
hippos, impalas and leopards in the
wild. You rarely see them.

“In my lifetime," Re is
“I’ve seen it go from game all over
the wilds to none at all.”

  

  

But the animals do survtve in
Swaziland today, because of. the ef-
forts of Reilly, with the support of
the late King Sobhuza 11.

After the colonial government
rejected a call in 1959 to create a na-
tional-park system, Reilly and his
wife, Liz, decided to convert their
l,150—acr.es farm at Mlilwane, south
of Mdabane, into a private reserve

mals.

“Everybody thought we were
. But Reilly wouldn’t be deterred
by naysayers: “I had known Swazi-
land as a land of plentiful game and
it had all disappeared. It saddened
me. I couldn’t imagine a Swaziland

without any game.”

The Reillys phased in Wildlife as
_ they phased out cattle and their pro-
' ductive fields of corn, rice and cit-
rus.
Reilly and his rangers went into
the lowlands to catch animals to
stock the reserve — in a race to get
them before the poachers did.

' 'Much of the game was caught at
Hlane, a once-game-rich savannah
in northeast Swaziland owned by the
king in trust for the nation. Sobhuza
welcomed Reilly’s efforts as he too
was distressed by the decimation of
the Wildlife and the refusal of the co-
lonial government to do anything to
stop .it.

Reilly’s crew knocked the ani-
mals out by shooting them with dart
guns, a crude technique at the time.
For every one zebra or wildebeest
caught and successfully transferred
to Mlilwans, about six of the animals
died from the tranquilizer. But, says
Reilly, even catching animals at
3 those odds was better than letting
them all die to poachers. .

Reilly says he borrowed heavily

5 to transform his farm into a game
park. He doesn’t remember worry-
ing tbo much about how he’d pay the
money back if the undertaking
flopped.

“I was more concerned with the
impala and the elaad.”

A certain spunk when dealing
with the bank helped. .

When he went back for more
money one day, the bank manager
asked him what additional assets he
had to back the loan.

“I told him one of the waterbuck
just had a calf. And he wasn’t too
pleased with that asset.”

But the manager apparently was
pleased with Reilly’s commitment

‘ and continued to back him.

tive. Whes Reilly opened the rest

Reilly says king Sobhuza helped
rally support for the park from
Swazis by calling his subjects to Lo-
bamba, the nation’s spiritual capital
near Mlilwane, and telling them he

heartily endorsed the project.
Faced with growing support for
Mlilwane, the British rulers finally
declared it a game sanctuary by law
in 1966, and today it covers an area
10 times its original size and is run
by a non-profit trust supported by
the government. In 1967, the king’s
land at Hlane was also designated a

game sanctuary by the colonialists.
Reilly says the conservation
movement was boosted by indepen-
dence in 1968 and several more re-
serves have since been added to the
list.
Today, about four percent of the

country’s land is protected, and most
of the wildlife that once called
Swaziland home is back and ﬂour-
ishing.

As is virtually all of the remain-
ing wildlife in Africa, the animals
are safely within sanctuaries.

Tribune reporter now traveling

It costs the customer about $125
to $250 for an inspection, depend-
‘ ing on the size of the building.

An inspection is potentially dan-
gerous if the floors have been
weakened by termite-infestation,
and the dogs are personally insured
for $25,000 each, about what it
costs to train them. But how Out-
man trains them is protected as a
trade secret.

Simply, it’s a behavior modifica-
tion technique, analogous to pro-
gramming a computer, he said. The
dogs will not work unless certain
procedures are followed and once
the red collar is on, it’s all business.

Training Process

The beagles go through three
stages of training, beginning at 5
weeks of age. But not all beagles
are made Of the stuff needed to
become TADD dogs. There is a
30% washout rate. .

“For instance, we don’t know if
Steve will ever make it to the front
line,” Outman said pointing to‘a
9—week-old trainee currently on
sick leave from puppy boot camp.
“But he’s got cute down real good.”

Like Steve, all the dogs are given
human names. No Fido or Snoopy
here, just Steve, Henry, Stewart
and Ben. -

When customers are making a
major decision to buy a home “they
don’t want to see a Snarf” sniffing
for termites, Outman said. “It ap-
peals to the anthropomorphic ideal
people have of their dogs. That if
my dog could talk, it’d be human.”

Most of Outman’s business has
been on the East Coast. Although
his California-based company has
been in business since 1979, TADD
.is only now finding interested ex-'
terminators in California.

Bank, Hospital Problems '

TADD dogs were called to in-
spect a bank vault in San Antonio,

Tex, where termites were eating ,

money, and a Georgia medical
school sought an inspection after
spawning termites swarmed an
operating room during surgery.
While bank and hospital officials
'Vare grateful to the dogs, some real
estate agents aren't because they
often lose prospective buyers after

the dogs find termites. Some agents

have tried to cover up the termite
scent by spraying perfume along
the walls. (One even tried plopping
cat food along the wall to deter the
dogs.) A human would smell only
. the perfume, “but the dog will say,
‘Oh, perfume and termites,’ ” Out-
man said. '
- But the dogs can’t smell forever.
Although none of the dogs has
reached the retirement age of 8,
Outman hopes to use the retirees
for breeding.
“It’s a retirement benefit they
can look forward to,” he said.

.1 Monks Have Words to Live By:

—The monks at the New Skete
.- Monastery in Cambridge, N .Y., are
truly a breed apart. In fact, they’re
less known arOund the world for
their prayers than for the German
shepherds they raise and their
book on canine obedience. Each
day at dawn, Brother Marc and
nine other monks feed litters of
puppiesthat will sell for at least
$500 apiece—before morning
prayers. “We all love the shep-
herds,” Brother Marc, 43, said. “We
love to sing, and we lOve the
shepherds. That’s two important
parts of our lives here. It’s better
than working in, a factory, or not
havmg dogs and just raising cows. I

‘ think shepherds are more fun than

cows." Their book, “How to Be
Your Dog’s Best Friend,” is in its
12th printing and has sold more
than 100,000 copies since it was
published in 1978. The monks,
members of the Orthodox Church
in America, first tried to suppOrt
themselves by farming but, as
Brother Marc said: “What did we

knOw about farming?” They soon

turned to breeding shepherds and

OUAN PE

For researchers, it’s a chicken and
egg problem. Study after study
shows that pet owners have lots of posi-
tive characteristics—they are more re-
laxed, compassionate, and even, accord-
ing to one study, more afﬂuent. The
question remains: Are pet owners that
way before they bring animals into their
lives, or is there something about shar-
ing your home with a pet that makes
you a better person?

Researchers have many case histories
showing that pets have a therapeutic ef-
fect on people with problems. Mental
patients begin to take more responsibil-
ity for themselves when they’re given a
pet to care for; prison inmates become
less aggressive; children and elderly
people who have been withdrawn and
unreachable begin to talk—if only to the
animal. But these are extreme cases.

    

Your Pet, the Psychiatrist

Researchers aren’t sure exactly what
effect pet ownership has on ordinary
people. They do know that people who
own pets get a lot of pleasure from their
company. One nationwide survey, fund-
ed by the Pets Are Wonderful Council,
found that 99 percent of pet owners con-
sider their cat or dog a member of the
family. In fact, the importance of pets
ranks just after that of immediate family
and other relatives. Three quarters of
those surveyed were also convinced that
their pets had improved the quality of
family life. For instance, they felt that
they quarreled less, laughed more, and
communicated better after a pet joined
the family.

An animal’s intuitive sense is con-
firmed by a study conducted at the Uni-
versity of Maryland, which found that
pets brought families closer together by
reducing tension, and giving adults and
children a common Opportunity to be
playful in the company of the pet. Dogs,
in particular, tend to draw families into
outdoor recreation because dogs need
daily exercise.

Pets also satisfy emotional needs.
Though much has been written about
the value of animals to elderly people
and others who live alone, even people
who live with other people spend a lot of

The Pros of Owning a Pooch

 
   
 

Pet owners appear to be more relaxed,
compassionate, and well-adjusted than
individuals without an animal in their lives.

By Carolyn Jabs

time talking to their animals. Ninety-
four percent of the people in the Pets
Are Wonderful survey had no doubts
that their pets could understand their
moods.

In general, though, the survey found
that pet owners feel less pessimistic or
anxious about their lives than people
who don’t own pets. Pet people de-
scribed their lives as more “full,” “re-
warding,” “interesting,” and “relaxed”
than nonowners. Of course, that rule
doesn’t apply to every individual. Many
of the pe0ple surveyed felt also that hav-
ing a pet prepares couples for parent-
hood because animals require day-in-
day-out care. Nearly everyone agreed

 

that pet ownership helps children learn
responsibility and respect for life.

Like Owner, Like Pet?

Dr. Jeffrey Kelly, a researcher at the
University of Mississippi Medical Cen-
ter, gave personality tests to dog own-
ers, cat owners, and people who didn’t
own pets to determine any differences.
He found that dog owners tend to be so-
cial leaders who enjoy being the center of
attention. In contrast, cat owners scored
higher in curiosity and independence.

“The image most people have of a
dog involves the animal’s unbridled, de-
monstrative affection and sociability,”
Kelly wrote. “In contrast, cats are seen
as less demonstratively affectionate, but
very inquisitive. It is fascinating that the
same ‘personality’ dimensions differen-
tiate their respective owners. It may
well be the case that individuals are
most attracted to animals which exhibit
behavior patterns that match or comple-
ment their own personality style.”

Similar results were found in a study
of people who own more exotic pets. Dr.
Aline Kidd, psychology professor at
Mills College in Oakland, Calif, found
distinct personality profiles for owners

of turtles, birds, snakes, and horses.
Turtle owners scored high for being
hardworking, reliable, considerate, and
goal oriented. Snake owners tend to be
relaxed but unpredictable. Bird owners
are s0cial, courteous, expressive, nur—
turing, and contented. Among horse
owners, the personalities differ accord-
ing to sex: Male horseowners are often
aggressive and dominant but not partic-
ularly expressive, while female horse
owners are easygoing.

Kelly’s study reiterates the differ-
ences between people who own pets and
those who don’t. “Pet owners as a group
exhibit personality characteristics that
connote adjustment and well-being,”
wrote Kelly. “There’s a stereotype that
people close to pet animals may have
problems relating to other people, but
our findings suggest quite the opposite.”

Owning a pet may have a very posi-
tive effect on how other people feel
about you. In one study, Randall Lock-
wood, director of higher education at
the Humane Society of the United
States, asked students to describe people
in a set of pictures. The people were
similar in appearance, but some were
photographed with animals and others
were not. The people with animals were
rated as happier, smarter, wealthier,
and more relaxed than those without.
That may explain why many pet owners
ﬁnd that they meet other people when
they’re in the company of their pet. In a
Swedish study, more than half the par-
ticipants said their animals had helped
them to make new friends.

Do pet owners seem more sociable
and happy because their pets make
them that way or are the people who
like animals simply nicer? So far, the re-
searchers don’t know, but someone "is
certain to tackle that question in the
near future. In the meantime, those of
us who own pets are pretty sure we
know the answer. a

Baldeagle breeds amid
Space Center activity

 

By JEFF BATER

United Press International

Silence is not golden at the Ken-
nedy Space Center, but the Ameri-
can bald eagle, the endangered bird
and proud national symbol, always
wings its way back there.

The snowy-headed eagle, which

prefers the quiet seclusion of
mountains and tall trees, has nest-
ed at the rocket base for at least 23
years, wildlife officials say.
~ The surrounding Merritt Island
National Wildlife Refuge supplies
_, the bald eagle -- known scientifi-
cally as Haliaeetus leucocephalus
—— with enough winter food during
breeding. The eagle has shrugged
off launching shuttles as if they
were strange birds -— smoky, noisy,
metallic.

“It may startle them, but they
usually go back to what they were
doing. If it’s very close to the shut-
tle, it may fly away,” said Dorn
Whitmore, a recreation specialist
with the US. Fish and Wildlife Ser-
vice.

The piney roost that is nearest to
a launch pad, about five miles
away, has been home to eagles
since 1963, Whitmore said. For the
”last five years, a remote-controlled
Nikon camera fastened to a branch
has documented family life in the
nest during fall and winter. It was
operated by TGS Technology Inc.,
. the photographic contractor for the
f-National Aeronautics and Space
Administration. _

. “It’s rather unique to have a
camera in there showing the entire
nesting sequence,” Whitmore said.

> Film shot last winter was recent-

ly deveIOped, producing more than
200 close-up color frames. It
_ showed the evolution of a tiny eagle
from chick to a bird ready to leave
the nest.
,_ The adult birds migrate to the
refuge in the fall, apparently from
elsewhere in the South. About.350
breeding pairs are in Florida; only
Alaska has a larger eagle popula-
tion.

Five nests were inhabited around
the Space Center during the 1985-
. 86 season, yielding five fledglings.

The breeding cycle and prepara-
tion lasts about six months. A ma-
ture male bird woos its mate in
flight. They hook talons and soar
together before mating. They build

I

 

thEir nest with twags, ugnt grass
and pine branches half as thick as a

- man’s wrist.

“They’ll fly up to a pine tree, hit
it with a significant force and try to

“break a limb off,” Whitmore said.

The female lays one to three

eggs, usually in December. Some

eggs are destroyed by foul weather.

‘ incubation takes a month, and then
' the down-covered eaglet cracks out
, of its shell. .

Both parents care for the young,

i.’ but the male Spends more time
than the female hunting for food.

“They take their turns,” Whitr

" more said. .

He said the birds swoop doWn on
rats, rabbits, snakes and fish. But

, the favored prey are migratory

K birds, especially coat and duck. The

eagles time their breeding season
to the availability of the birds.

“They have lots of things to eat,”
he said. “They’re looking for crip-
ples. They’ll take them first.”

The eagle uses its beak to make
the kill. It flies back to the nest with
the remains for its family.

The bird, which emits a shrill
whistle, does not warn its prey of
an impending attack.

“You don’t see them shrieking
and diving like on a cartoon fea-
ture. They just sort of hover and
pick up the bird,” Whitmore said.

In March or April, the eaglet
takes its first, clumsy practice
flight. Soon, it leaves the nest, hav-
ing acquired the 7-foot wingspan of
brown feathers that either parent
sports.

Eagles only attack humans who .

invade their territory, Whitmore
said.

“They would be quite disturbed if
someone got into their nest,” he
said.

Bald eagles living in the Ever-
glades make their home in old
mangrove trees. At the Space Cen-
ter, they nest in the pines. The birds
are found near water — in coastal
areas and beside such lakes as Lake
,George in Ocala National Forest.

' With development encroaching
upon the Florida wilderness, the
eagle’s habitat is shrinking, Whit-
more said. The Merritt Island ref-
uge is trying to keep the endan-
gered species, protected by an Act
of Congress, alive. The camera
film will help wildlife officials bet-

NO FREE REFUGE

I am astounded that author Iarry Rice
(“The Great North Plains,” May) would be
offended at the fact that hunting is allowed
at certain refuges. After all, it is highly
probable that hunters license fees, plus
the taxes they pay on guns and ammuni-
tion, footed the bill for the refuges. These
places basically provide a breeding place
for waterfowl and many non-game birds

~§"-m—ur
and animals. If hunters hadn‘t paid for the
refuges, chances are the areas might have
been drained and developed.
When people like Larry Rice start paying
for these areas, then they‘ll be qualified to

 

 

express an opinion on whether or not
people should be allowed to hunt on
them. In the meantime, legal, licensed
hunters do more for wildlife than anyone.

designate the dogs to be walked

, if your outside area was limited?

Over to the next door neighbor
perhaps? Could an elderly per-
son who walks with difficulty or
with a cane be able to maneuver
a “pooper scooper?” Or would all
the other residents be detailed

to clean up? What abOut an ani-

To The Commercial Appeal:

In the recent discussion of
the presence of pets in federally
subsidized housing, two impor-

tant points have been over- ‘

looked. -

The first is that all'tenants
are not equally willing and able
to take of themselves, much less
a pet. For the majority of ten;
ants, owning and caring for a pet
poses no problem. But in devis-
ing rules that, can be applied
fairly to all tenants, the landlord
must take into account an irre-
Sponsible few who are either un-
willing or unable to care for
their pets.

The second puint is that

, medical problems such as aller-

gies, emphysema, and other res-
piratory problems are not un-
common among the elderly.
Thus the puppy that is Mrs.
Smith’s pride and j could pose
a serious threat to the health of
Mrs. Jones who lives next door.

The landlord’s responsibil-
ity is to provide a pleasant place
for all of his or her tenants to
live. Those tenants who want
pets must assure the landlord
that their pets will be properly
cared for and will. cause no prob-
lems for the other tenants. With
this in mind, the pet ownership
rules at Highland Meadows seem
very reasonable.

POT KILLS

 

 

When it comes to turning a
proﬁt, drug dealers don’t let
anything stand in their
way—including wildlife. Ac-
cording to state environmen-
tal ofﬁcials, record numbers
of wild animals in California
are being slaughtered by mar-
ijuana growers to protect
their lucrative crops.

One section that’s been
hard hit is Six Rivers National
Forest in northern California.
A 1985 Forest Service report
documented the raiding of
269 marijuana “gardens" in
which 25,550 plants—esti-
mated by police to have a
street value of about $2000
each—were dug up. Each gar-
den used two or more meth—
ods to kill intruding animals:
rat traps, steel leghold traps,
and poisons. In most cases, a
mortuary of carcasses—chip-
munks, squirrels, birds,
deer—was found strewn
around the plot. The animals
that died quickly were lucky:
One rabbit, for example, was
found alive with both front
legs cut off; larger animals,
like deer, had died slowly of
starvation, entangled in chick-
en wire surrounding the
gardens.

The horror story goes on,
and with over 20 million acres
of National Forest land in Cal-
ifornia, and only 28 Forest
Service criminal enforcement

agents to cover it, the pot
growers are holding all the
cards. Despite the odds,
though, Bill Derr, a Forest
Service regional criminal
agent, estimates that the agen-
cy, in conjunction with local
law enforcement ofﬁcials,
was able to remove about half
the gardens in the Six Rivers
area last year. The crisis has

I STUART, Fla. - When Friends of
the Sea researchers jump off the boat
into a thickly milling group of dolphins,
it is hard to tell just who is doing the
studying.

. The research team observes the dol-
phins. The dolphins observe the re-
search team. They swim in for a closer

Ibok, circling each other.

: The divers have their underwater
video cameras and hydrophones to re-
cord what they see and hear. The dol-
phins bring no such equipment to the
meeting, but it is obvious they are
there by choice.

. Free choice is an important part of

Friends of the Sea dolphin research.
Based in Tequesta, Fla., the organi-
zation studies dolphins in their natural
habitat. They have no massive holding
tanks, no aquariums.

: “If you study an animal in its natural
habitat, you can learn more about it
and its being,” said Larry Vertefay,
founder of Friends of the Sea.

I “It’s better for the dolphin, and it’s
better for man. We don’t have to jail
any dolphins, and I don’t think they
deed to be in confinement for enter-
tainment and greed.”

I Vertefay was sitting in the galley of
the Dolphin, a 61—foot sailboat that
serves as the organization’s research

“Vessel. Across the table 'was Denise
Herzing, naturalist and research coor-
dinator. Between research expeditions,
the boat was moored for a couple of
days at a Riviera Beach marina.

.1 [While Vertefay and Herzing talked
about their work, other crew members
bustled about readying the boat for its
next trip out to sea.

. Friends of the Sea, a non-profit foun-
dation, sends the research boat 100
miles or more out to places where it

has encountered dolphins in the ast.
Researchers have developed what er-
tefay and crew refer to as a “relation-
ship” with a number of dolphins under
study.

Herzing explained that they study
family structure and relationships as
well as social behavior.

“We don’t make anything happen,”

said Vertefay. “We don’t feed, pet, con-
trol. They have free choice.

“Social behavior we can observe and.

learn a great deal from. These things
don’t happen in a captive environment.
They have close relationships with one
another. They’re close, and they’re
true. They live in harmony with their
environment.”

Researchers make careful records of
the dolphins they encounter, noting any
distinctive markings. They’ve given
dolphins that show up again and again

names like Rose, Mole, Chopper and
Stubbie. '

Dolphin communication is one of
their key areas of research. Research-
ers talk to the dolphins, whistle to
them, play music and record their re-
sponses.

“They communicate to one another.
We just don’t have the key to their
language,” said Vertefay.

It is clear Vertefay has special feel-
ings for dolphins.

He casually uses words like “rela-
tionship” and “language.” He refers to
them as “ambassadors of the sea.”

Just how intelligent are these crea-
tures that he and his crew have been
studying for several years?

“What you’re dealing with is a differ-
ent type of intelligence,” said Herzing.
“With humans we can’t even come to
terms with what intelligence is.”

When Exotic Pets
Are Cashed In, Zoo

in Vegas IS Winner

By CHARLES HILLINGER, Times Staff Writer

LAS V EGAS—Half the animals in Nevada’s only zoo came
from private homes and backyards in this gambling metropo—
lis. '

“This town is full of fascinating people from all over the
world, people with exotic tastes. Keeping lions, tigers and
leopards as family pets isn’t all that unusual in Las Vegas,”
said Pat Dingle, 39, director of the Southern Nevada
Zoological Park as he groomed the mane of Arnie, a
21/2 -year—old, 400—pound African lion.

Dingle, a former homicide detective, estimated that 200 to
300 big cats are kept in private homes in Las Vegas. Permits
are granted to keep some of those animals in certain sections
of the city and surrounding area. But many are kept illegally
as pets.

Make Their Way to Zoo

“It’s crazy. I believe there are more lions, tigers, leopards
and ocelots in Las Vegas homes than in any city in the
country,” Dingle said. Many of those animals make their way
to the zoo with the cooperation of the local animal shelter and
state and federal wildlife agencies.

Arnie, for instance, was a baby when given to a Las Vegas
Showgirl as a 1983 Christmas present. By the time Arnie was
three months old and weighed 25 pounds, its owner decided
that an African lion really did not belong in an apartment

house. She gave the lion to the
animal shelter, which presented it
to the Las Vegas zoo. 7 ‘

Other house pets that are now
zoo animals include a 4-year-old
female Bengal tiger named Zarah
and a 3-year-old Asian spotted
leopard named Samantha.

Some offers, however, are re-
fused. “We turned away 20 big cats
so far this year,” Dingle said. “We
don’t have the room or facilities to
house them at the present."

The zoo is on a half -acre site on
Rancho Boulevard at the north end
of the city. Another 5%. adjacent
acres have been purchased, and a
master plan has been drawn up for
an $8-million, six-acre zoological
park.

Dingle said lawyers and account-
ants are preparing plans for the zoo
to go public with a stock sale
sometime next year.

Several prominent Nevadans are
members of the zoo’s advisory
board and board of directors. The
zoo has had the backing of area
business and government leaders,
and more than 500 people have

become association members by
paying annual dues.

The zoo Was launched in 198] by
Dingle, who may be the only
former cop anywhere running a
zoological park. A radar man
aboard the aircraft carrier York-
town for four years during the
Vietnam War, he joined the North
Las Vegas Police Department
when he was 21 upon leaving the
Navy.

He was chief of detectives when
he retired in 1980 after a dozen
years on the police force.

“Since I was a kid growing up in
Alhambra, Calif, I have always had
birds, especially parrots,” Dingle
said. “My older brother, Sheldon, is
editor of Watchbird magazine, a
leading bird publication.”

While a detective in 1979, he
opened a local bird shop, known as
For the Birds. “It was an overnight
success. I quit the police force the
following year to spend full time
with the business,” he recalled.

At For the Birds he exhibited his
personal birds, which some regard-
ed as the finest collection of exotic
birds and talking parrots in Neva—

da. He purchased several small
animals, including goats, sheep, a
llama, and started a petting zoo for
children of his customers.

“There was nowhere in Nevada
where children or adults could see
lions, tigers, apes and other wild
animals except in animal acts at
casinos. They could only read about

them in books, see them in movies
'or on TV or travel great distances
to see them,” Dingle said. “The idea
”hit me. Nevada needs a zoo.”
. So, 3% years ago, he opened the
Southern Nevada Zoological Park.
He built a veterinary hospital on
“the grounds to care 4 for the zoo
animals as well as for animals from
the public. .
Today,,Ding1e's wife Muffye, 42,
, a former" manicurist, and seven
[full-time keepers operate the zoo.
Veterinarians Scott Bradley, 34,
and his wife Ann, 31, run the
animal hospital. '

150 Birds on Exhibit

The zoo, Dingle said, is in a

- modest, early stage with 50 animals
and 150 birds, representing 50
.. exotic species such as yellow,
streaked chattering loris, golden
eagles, flamingos, macaws, parrots
”and parakeets from around the
world. ' . _
San Diego Zoo has been very
helpful, giving six rare Barbary
apes and a dozen African green

. grivet monkeys to the zoo. Nancy
With the Smiling Face, one of the
green grivets, recently gave birth,
the third baby that the monkey has
had since arriving at the zoo. __

Party at the Zoo

If you’ve waited until the end of the
summer to visit a zoo, the Texas Zoo in
Victoria is throwing a big party on August
10, and everyone is invited.

In keeping with the state’s sesquicenten-
nial celebration, ZooFest follows a West-
ern theme this year. There are food
booths, games, and animal—conservation
workshops, as well as the popular Beau-
tiful Burro Contest.

“The Beautiful Burro Contest is limited
to donkeys from South Texas only. How-
ever, any donkeys in South Texas at
the time of the contest will qualify,” Says
Jacquelin A. Mead, executive director
of the Texas Zoo.

The braying burros, often sporting col-
orful blankets, hats, and even sunglasses,
are favorites with the crowds. According
to Mead, the unusual “beauty” contest
honors the animal for its role in Texas
history. Burros were used as pack animals
during the settling of the state. And at one
time, large herds of wild donkeys roamed
the Coastal Plains around Victoria.

For additional information about Zoo-
Fest or the Texas Zoo, write to J acquelin
Mead, Box 69, Victoria, Texas 77902; or

Scripps oward News Service
. SAN FRANCISCO -— Conserve-i
tionists are excited about the new:
est additions to the San Franciscoi
Zoo: No. 1, No. 2 and No.3.

‘ They are bald-eagle chicks, the
first in California to be incubated
and hatched in captivity.

Members of the San Francisco

‘Zoological Society's Avian Conser-

v

vation Team plan to use the eaglets
as the nucleus of the state’s cap-
tive-breeding program for the en-
dangered species.

Nancy Venizelos, the team’s di-
rector, says the group of scientists,
zoo specialists and volunteers hopes
to increase the current population
of 60 bald-eagle mating pairs to
nearly 140' pairs within 10 or 15
years. '

The still-downy chicks, who
made their first appearance before
the press this week, range in age
from 6 to 8 weeks and weigh about
3% pounds.

The eggs were . the first in

California to be taken from their,
nests before hatching so specialists

cauld ensure their survival, said 200

biologist George Carpenter. They;

were incubated and hatched at the

Predatory Bird Research Group at .
UC-Santa Cruz, and will remain at:

the San Francisco Zoo.

However, they will not be avail-.

able for public viewing until they
are more mature. Zoo scientists are
trying to imprint only eagles on the

young bird’s developing minds, and

goso far-Fae to'feedithe chicks .With’
an eagle hand-puppet to avoid all’
human contact. . .

l

Said Carpenter: “They certainly:
are acting like wild eagles.” ;

The chicks will be supplemented

with three mates in the next year ori .

80. Project manager John Aikin’
says the team hopes to, successfully.

' hand-raise six pairs of eagles.

The resultant offspring will 11w;

The year-old project; costing

’ $50,000, was funded by the feder-

ally run Institute of Museum Serv~'

, ices and the San Francisco Zoologi-

cal Society.

The Avian project is one Of only
three in the country, although the
bald eagle is endangered in 43
states and threatened , in Oregen,‘
Washington, Michigan, Wiscosain
and Minnesota. -

“The only state in which the bald-
eagle flourishes is Alaska, with i

7,500 pairs out of a total 0.3..

population of 8,700 pairs.- We’re'
struggling to restore some balance
within California,” Venizelos said.

Carpenter predicts 100 percent
success with the captiveebreeding
program. “We can take better care.

he said. “However, their place is in

CHICAGO TRIBUNE - August 5, 1986

Lions and dogs and police, oh

By Robert Enstad

Henny, 'a 90-pound German
shepherd puppy, narrowly escaped
being arrested early Monday for
impersonating a cat in Waukegan.

Three local residents on their
way to O’Hare International Air-
port called police at 2:50 am. to
report a lion on the loose in the

west side of the city. They said the

animal had a big ﬂuffy crop of fur
on its tail, had closely cropped
hair from the back of its neck to
its tail, and other markings of a
lion—or so they thought. .

“It was a bona ﬁde call,” said
Waukegan Police Chief Ronald
Hauri. “The people were sure they
had seen a lion.”

With sirens wailin ,_ 10 police
and animal-control o icers sped to
the 2700 block of Westwood Ave-
nue to begin the search. The
“lion” was last reported seen en-

tering a wooded area.

Meanwhile, Henny, who was
supposed to be on guard duty at a
local towing company, apparently
was enjoying his new freedom and
the feline look that has given the
ll-month-old dog celebrity status.
The dog recently had sat for a $30
summer grooming that owner M1-
chael Hussey wanted to be unusu-
al. . .

“I wanted the dog to be cool
during the summer and I wanted
it to be a conversation piece. It
was Henny’srsummer haircut,”
said Hussey,“ owner of ,Wrecker
Services in Waukegann '

It also was unusual enough for
Henny to have been asked to
model his lion look for a local
newspaper, which published the
picture. -

As the lion search proceeded in
the predawn hours Monday,

waukegan police checked zoos

‘and circuses for missmg lions.

None was reported missing. Nei-
ther could police ﬁnd anyone who
heard any unusual howlings or
grolwlings in Waukegan, Hauri
sat . '

. A Waukegan police officer com-
ing on the day shift Monday found
the answer.

He remembered the towing com-
pany With the strange-looking Ger-
man shepherd.

Could it be, he asked himSelf,
that the so-called free-wheeling
lion was really a dog?

By the time police went to
Wrecker Services at 3100 Central
Ave., only a few blocks from
where the lion sighting was report-
ed, Henny was back home. But
he’d been gone, all right, having
escaped through an Openin in the
fence, and he was full 0 debris

 

from his nocturnal prowl.

“At first I thought there might
be some criminal charges against
me,” said Hussey, 31. “Now I
think this whole thing is pretty

-99

hilarious.

Hauri‘said that grooming dogs
to look like other animals seems
to be the current craze among dog
owners. Hussey said he doesn’t
know.

“Everyone does these things to
poodles and cocker spaniels every
month, ‘so why can’t I do it to a
German shepherd?” Hussey said.

As for Henny, he was cleaned up
and regroomed Monday morning
in time for a. bevy of photogra-
phers who came to record the dog
that looks like a lion. . '

donkey is not like treating a

Not about to be beaten by
a burrito, the vet went back
to his truck and returned
with a tranquilizer. Two false
starts and two needles later,
he gave her the injection.
He’d plant the needle in her
neck, she’d snort, kick, and
he’d jump away. On the third

him into early retirement.

The vet shook his head.
“We’ll have to do it the hard

ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH - July 31, 1986

The Dog Problem Is A People Problem,

By William B. Hope Jr.

"‘" he tragic death of two antelope in
the Zoo has served to focus public
attention once again on the prob-

lems associated with stray dogs in our

city. ~

Each year, City Health Division staff
members pick up several thousand dogs
that have either been turned loose or
allowed to run loose by their owners.

Every year, hundreds of individuals in.

the city suffer dog bites. Last year alone
some 707 persons were bitten by dogs.
This resulted in some 45 persons having
to take rabies immunizations, a not-too-
enjoyable- experience. Already in the
first three months of 1986, some 110
persons have suffered dog bites in the
city.

City law requires that whenever an
animal bites a person the Animal Regu-
lation Center must be notified. At this
point, the biting dog must be placed un-
der quarantine for a period of 10 days to
assure that we are not dealing with a
possible case of rabies. Without this
quarantine observation period, the vic-
tim must undergo anti-rabies injections.

Each year, dozens of dog owners are
cited for allowing their pets to run loose
or because their dogs have bitten indi-
viduals. The courts, for the most part,
are very lenient in these. instances. A
recent case involved a person cited for
having eight dogs on his premises with-
out registrations or vaccinations and for
operating a kennel without a license.
The judge summarily dismissed the
charge of operating a kennel without a
license and fined the individual $12 in
court costs on the no-vaccination/regis-
tration charges.

In another situation, a dog bit individ-
uals on five occasions between 1983 and
February of this year. The owner was
charged with allowmg a dog to run at
large and with having a dangerous or

vicious dog. The court found the owner

 

guilty and ordered a fine of $150 plus
court costs of $12, for a total of $162.
The court had another option, rarely
exercised: to order the animal put to
sleep.

Some have suggested that the city’s
approach to controlling dogs should be
changed. The suggestion is that the city
should abolish all requirements for per-
mits for dogs per se. Instead, the city
should require licensing of all potential
dog owners, much like a driver’s li-
cense. Potential dog owners would be

required to agree to meet certain re-.

\‘ .
l

quirements before being allowed to pur-

chase a dog. A major .requirement .

would be to have thein dogs spayed or
neutered. Special permits could be is-
sued to those few individuals who would
meet special requirements as breeders
of dogs.

The problem highlighted in reference

to Forest Park is basically a people

problem. The same can be said for the
stray dogs seen on city streets. Many
individuals tire of a pet and simply turn
it loose. Other dog owners seem to feel
that it is their privilege to allow their
dogs to roam at will regardless of the
city’s laws, public health considerations
or the animals’ welfare. These individ-
uals at best are guilty of neglect we at

worst are guilty of animal abuse.
Owners who dump their dogs on city

streets or in the parks are subjecting

these animals to an inhumane future, in
addition to the possible danger they are
creating for the general public. Many of
these animals do, in fact, starve to a
point of developing diseases that result
in their death. They may contract parvo
virus or other infections that will result
in their demise. It is not at all uncom-
mon to find stray dogs and newborn
puppies frozen to death during the win-

ter months. Dumping dogs is not a hu--

mane way of disposing of an unwanted
pet. .

This dumping of dogs when they fall .

out of favor with their owners is totally
unnecessary. There are a number of
agencies in the metropolitan area that
will gladly pick up a dog if the owner
becomes disenchanted and no longer
wishes to keep the animal. The City
Health Division, the St. Louis County
Health Department, the Humane Soci-
ety of Missouri and other organizations
and individuals are ready and willing to
help find this animal a new home. Other
organizations play a role in these mat-
ters, including the Animal Protective
Association, Citizens for a Humane St.
Louis and Animal Friends.

It is important to note that dogs are
very dependent, much as children are.
Dogs are dependent upon their owners
for their food, shelter, medical care and
general well-being. It is important that
dogs be under the control of their own-
ers at all times. It is vital that owners
maintain current rabies inoculations for
their dogs.

The safety of people must come firsf.
This objective will be guaranteed if all
dog owners will assume their legal and
humane responsibilities.

William B. Hope Jr. is St. Louis health
commissioner. 1

HERO DOG

Eat your heart out, Morris
the Cat. Here comes Tango
the Dog. Named the 1985
Ken-L Ration Dog Hero of the
Year, Tango demonstrated
“outstanding bravery, loyalty,

‘ and intelligence to save her

‘ master,” according to George
Yapp, president of Pet Foods.
The 13-year-old border
collie/Australian shepherd,
who knocked out seven other

 

ﬁnalists for the award, risked
her life last August to rescue
her owner, Al Choate of Port
Townsend, Washington, from
an attacking cow. Effused a
grateful Choate, “That’s one
smart dog.” For her efforts,
Tango was awarded a brass
medal, a year’s supply of dog
food, and the satisfaction of
knowing that, having taken
on a cow, she could probably
swallow Morris in one gulp.

OBBS, N.M., is proud as

punch of its version of J. R., a

seven—foot-long alligator by

the name of John Roger who
has become the city’s almostpfﬁcial
mascot. The hull alligator lives at the
wastewater treatment plant in his own
private solar-heated home, swims in his
own pool, and feeds once a week or so on
meat scraps. .

City officials are quick to point out that
he’s no tax burden, though, as all the
building materials and his food are
donated by residents of the community.
In fact, he is the opposite of a tax burden
to Hobbs. Because of his popularity with
schOolchildren, who have been fasci-

nated by John Roger for years, officials '

feel that parents have come to know
more about the treatment plant and its
needs and have looked more favorably
on bond issues dealing with improve-
ments at the plant.

J .R. is young in ’gator years, probably
no more than 14. Alligators live more
than 50 years. But he may have a lot
more growing to do. An average bull
alligator can be as long as 12 feet.

‘ John Roger’s beginnings were humble

—- as anyone’s would be who was flushed
down a toilet. He was somebody’s pet,
and probably outgrew his owner. He was
disposed of back in 1972 and ended up
swimming about in the city’s effluent

pond, which has since been replaced by.

the modern treatment plant. ' On the
basis of several sightings, J. R. quickly
became a legendary figure. Rumors cir-
culated that a creature lived in the pond

at the outskirts of town. When the bizarre .

stories were conﬁrmed, the alligator
was found to be less than a yard long. The

‘ pond was drained to catch him.

Like J. R. of “Dallas” fame, Hobbs’ J.
R. can be a little fussy: He likes only

natural light, lots of warmth, and to be

fed whenever he’s hungry. And how does

‘ one know when an alligator is hungry?

He lets you know. On days when J. R.’s
belly and tail are full, one can walk
inside his home to clean it up, watched

over by a smiling John Roger. But when

he’s hungry and wants to‘be fed, watch
out. The alligator will hiss loudly and
refuse to allow his housekeeper to enter
until his feeding. What John Roger
doesn’t require immediately, he stores
as excess nourishment in his tail.

Over the years, a few thingshave
changed. The alligator is still a favorite
of hundreds of schoolchildren, but now
the children must go to see him. He used
to make schoolhousecalls in a cage in
the back of a city pickup. '

John Roger’s future seems bright in
Hobbs. He has become so accustomed to
human beings that he cannot be safely
released to a wildlife preserve. Besides,
he has more seniority at the
wastewater-treatment plant than most
of the employees, so all have voted to
keep him.

While “Dallas” is in hiatus during the

Will the African wilderness turn into a string of gloriﬁed game parks?

These great herds of moving, unhurried,
innocent creatures, at home in their ele-
ment, numerous as buttercups in an Eng-
lish May meadow and as beautiful, were
like the heart that gives life to a body; with-
out them, the features of the landscape
would still be there and still be shapely, but
they would be lifeless as the contours of
the dead.

trees, eying the passing herd for prey. The
annual migration of the Wildebeest, in
search of fresh pasture and water, is so
dazzling it seems more a gaudy Hollywood
fantasy than nature in the raw.

It is also a kind of mirage, the shimmer-
ing splendor of it all masking a crisis for
Africa’s wildlife. In the case of some ani-
mals, the next few years could amount to
the last safari. Since the early 19705 the
black rhinoceros has been slaughtered in
such numbers that it is virtually extinct in
much of the continent. Poachers are killing
tens of thousands of elephants annually. A
few hundred surviving mountain gorillas
have been driven to their last stand in a
handful of hideouts. The fate of other spe-
cies such as cheetah, African wild dog and

 

Wars, drought, a human population ex-
plosion, corruption and simple greed have
all conspired against Africa’s animals.
Most conservationists agree they are ﬁght-
ing a rear-guard action to try to preserve
one of the globe’s great natural wonders.
Pessimists predict that wild Africa will
soon become little more than a string of
gloriﬁed safari parks as the true wilder-
ness shrivels and the animals die out.

That process is already under way in
some of Africa’s most popular game-view-
ing regions. In Kenya’s Amboseli and Ma-
sai Mara parks great swaths of land are
becoming clogged with lodges and tented
camps. Crowded minibuses race each other
across the plains in search of game, then
cluster eagerly around their ﬁnd; recently

was surrounded by nearly 60 vehicles.
African wildlife, of course, need not be
observed from a seat on a minibus. Visitors
can choose from an array of excursions to
suit all tastes and pocketbooks: canoeing
safaris on the Zambezi River, camel-trek-
king in Kenya’s arid northern district,
hikes into central Africa’s mountains in
search of gorilla, even jaunts by balloon
over the Kenyan plains. But for tradition-
alists the ultimate attraction is Still the big-
game safari. N EWSWEEK’S Ray Wilkinson
recently joined one hunting safari into the
remote Tanzanian bush. His report:

Climbing high into a lone acacia tree in
the early morning, professional hunter
Robin Hurt and one of his American cli-
ents, Andrew McMillan, spot a shy and
elusive antelope, called a sitatunga, 300
yards away deep in a swamp. Steadying his
Ruger N o. 1 hunting gun in the crook of a
branch, McMillan gets the animal in his
telescopic sight and fells it with one quick,
clean shot. The crack reverberates across
the hills and around the lake. The antelope
is a prize, extremely hard to ﬁnd but not
endangered. Dinner at camp that evening
is sitatunga steak—"one of the rarest
steaks in the world,” offers Hurt.

Big-game hunting is still the exclusive
preserve of kings, princes and business bar-
ons. N 0 one else can afford it. Ernest Hem-
ingway immortalized the safari in his 1935
novel “Green Hills of Africa” and little has
changed since. A client pays anywhere
from $1,000 to $1,500 per day per person,
which covers the services of a professional
hunter, trackers, gun bearers, animal skin-
ners, table waiters, luxury tents, hunting
and trophy fees, four-wheel-drive bush ve-
hicles, even light aircraft for travel be-
tween campsites. Nothing is left to chance.

Getting a taste of the wild: Tourists in Tanzania cluster around a lion hill

 

A client’s taste in food and drink is careful-
ly noted before his arrival. For the connois-
seur, hunting offers far more than the kill.
“1 like, above all else, the roar of the lions at
night,” says Andrew’s father, Tom, a
wealthy businessman who owns a con-
struction company in Nevada, farms rice in
California and has made several hunting
trips to Africa. "For me, that is Africa. The
bush helps me rediscover myself.”

But even in this remote part of east Afri-
ca, evidence of poachers abounds—trip

 

fences, snares, wooden racks to dry
poached meat. A pile of zebra and antelope
legs, hacked from the carcasses, lies dis-
carded at one site. The poaching is so heavy
that several areas have already been
stripped of game. “This was elephant coun-
try at one time,” says Hurt. “N ow, if there
are any survivors, they are cowering,
frightened, in the deepest forest.” There
are traces of one family of elephants here;
but there are ominous footprints, presum~
ably poachers’, superimposed over the ani-

mal tracks. The only trace of

tral and southern Africa. To-
day only 4,500 remain, living in

tiny groups that could die or be poached out
unless they are immediately protected. "It
must surely represent the most appalling
example of the destruction of a large mam-
mal in the history of man,” says Peter J en-
kins, a senior game warden in Kenya. The
only major herd of black rhinos left in the
world—the several hundred animals living
in Zimbabwe’s Zambezi valley—is now
struggling against a similar fate (opposite).

Guards and high fences: Kenya, the destina-
tion of many Africa-bound visitors, seems
to have been a rhino poacher’s paradise.
Wildlife expert Daphne Sheldrick, whose
late husband, David, ran the country’s
8,000—squaremile Tsavo National Park for
nearly three decades, says Tsavo once had
the biggest rhino population in Africa, as
many as 8,000 in the late 19605. “They were
so thick on the ground, if you didn’t see 40
in an afternoon, you’d had a bad day,” she
recalls. In 1970 there were still 20,000
black rhinos in Kenya. Today there are
around 400; and nearly a quarter of these
are penned up on a privately owned
game preserve, protected by guards and
high fences.

It is a cruel trick of nature that rhinos
are, in fact, easy targets. Though they have
a keen sense of smell, they have very poor
eyesight. Many are so docile that a poacher
adept at imitating animal sounds can virtu-
ally call a rhino to its death. Rhinos, too, are
creatures of habit, and they must drink
daily. Often a poacher simply has to stake
out a watering hole and wait. The relative
ease of the kill has resulted in widespread
carnage. Zambia may have had as many as
12,000 rhinos as late as 1973. Now there are
just 300. In ﬁve years the rhino population
of the Central African Republic has been
reduced from 3,000 to 170. Uganda’s herds
have been wiped out.

The prize is the rhino’s horn. Made of
thickly matted hair, the horn can be re
moved from the dead animal in just 10
minutes. Poachers, and a handful of trad-

 

ers, can make a fortune in those minutes. In

the early 19705 the horn fetched $17 per
pound wholesale. By the end of the decade
it had soared to $250. Today it fetches $300
from buyers in its main markets, North
Yemen and Asia, and sells retail for as
much as $13,000 a pound. The increased
demand for horn was fueled, in part, by the
oil bonanza in the Middle East and by gen-
eral economic prosperity in Asia. In North
Yemen, which handles half the world’s
rhino-horn trade, the horn is used to make
the elaborately carved handles of daggers.
In Asia the horn is used in the preparation
of traditional medicines to cure nosebleeds
or reduce fever, and not as an aphrodisiac,
as commonly believed. The trade in rhino
horn is illegal virtually everywhere; even
North Yemen oﬂicially banned importa-
tion of the horn in 1982. But the laws are
often not enforced, and the small coterie of
traders who control the market continue to
sell as much rhino horn as the poachers on
the savannahs can provide.

For sheer ruthlessness, elephant poach-
ers on the remote northern plains of the
Central African Republic know few peers.
Though heavily armed with automatic
weapons, raiding gangs prefer to chase ele-
phant on horseback, then hobble the beasts
by slashing their rear legs with ﬂat broad
spears. The disabled animals are then
slaughtered. Poachers have killed nearly
8,000 elephants out of a regional popula-
tion of 11,000. British elephant expert Iain
Douglas-Hamilton made an aerial survey
of the region last year and found that the
rotting carcasses and skeletons littering
the landscape outnumbered living ele-
phants by two to one.

When Gen. André Kolingba, president of
the Central African Republic, visited the
region late last year, audacious poachers
even ﬁred on his entourage—to their subse-
quent regret. Members of the presidential
unit fanned out from helicopters, killed 1
poacher, captured 24 others and recovered

picked up the bloody trail of a dying rhi-
noceros and the footprints of two tracking
poachers. The stricken animal lumbered
into a thicket of 14-foot-high combretum
bush, where the poachers felled it with
two ﬁnal shots and began hacking at the
prized horns. The thud of knives against
horn masked the approach of the rangers,
who tiptoed over a carpet of dry leaves to
within 15 yards of the unsuspecting hunt-
ers and, without warning, opened ﬁre.
One poacher fell dead. The second scuttled
behind the rhino and emptied a 30-clip
magazine from his AK—47 assault riﬂe.
The bullets ﬂew harmlessly overhead,
shredding the bushes. The rangers circled
the clearing and shot the second poacher
dead through the splayed back legs of the
fallen animal. "They are the enemy,” re-
called scout David Chipesi proudly, “and
we destroyed them.”

That shootout in the Zambezi River val-
ley two months ago was the most encour-
aging success Zimbabwe’s rangers have
enjoyed in their shoot-on-sight battle
against invading gangs of poachers from

neighboring Zambia. At stake is the sur-
vival of the world’s last great herd of black
rhino. In just six years, two-thirds of Afri-
ca’s black-rhino population has been de-
stroyed. Lured by the soaring prices of-
fered for rhino horn, poachers inﬁltrated
every known rhino habitat. Today fewer
than 5,000 black rhinos have escaped the
onslaught. In many parts of Africa the
survivors are being herded behind electri-
ﬁed fences for their own protection. But
the Zimbabwe Department of National
Parks and Wildlife wants to defend a herd
of some 750 to 1,000 animals on their own
turf, in the wild. In early 1985 Operation
Stronghold was launched.

“Make no mistake: we are ﬁghting a
very nasty bush war here, with no quarter
given,” says Glenn Tatham, the chief war-
den of the region. He was speaking, over
the crackle of a battered radio, in the clut-
tered operations room of the Kapirin-
hengu ranger base camp, set in a clearing
on the banks of the Zambezi. Across the
several hundred yards of crocodile-infest-
ed river lay Zambia, sanctuary for the
poachers who slip almost daily across the
current in sleek banana boats and fade
into the bush in search of instant fortunes.

Shoot on sight: Poaching in the region
began in earnest two years ago. Gangs
numbering as many as 16 men and armed
with the latest automatic weapons have
killed 100 rhino since then. "They caught
us with our pants down,” admits 28-year-
old Blondie Leathem, a senior ranger in
the Operation Stronghold force. But now
the rangers’ alert presence is paying off.
Since Stronghold’s start, rangers have
killed 13 poachers; 11 others have been
captured. Tatham is unrepentant about
his controversial shoot-on-sight policy.
“It’s very difﬁcult to arrest someone with
a riﬂe who is prepared to shoot you,” he
said. "Unless they throw their guns up in
the air and raise the white ﬂag there is no
chance we are going to try to reason with
them and arrest them. We shoot ﬁrst to
protect our men. It is a sensitive
subject—killing a man for kill-
ing an animal. Many people
don’t agree with this policy. But
as far as I’m concerned, killing
an animal is no different than
robbing a Barclays bank.”

Prime Minister Robert Mu-
gabe has personally endorsed
the harsh penalties for poach-
ing, but he has not been able to
spare much money for the op-
eration. At any one time
Tatham has fewer than 50
rangers in the ﬁeld. Two-man
patrols are often away from
base camp for a month, cover-
ing as much as 15 miles on foot

each day. Only ﬁve oﬂicial vehicles patrol
more than 3,800 square miles. But the
antipoaching effort has won valuable sup-
port from outside the country. The Foun-
dation to Save African Endangered Wild-
life (SAVE), a U.S.-based volunteer
organization, donated two bright red Ya-
maha dirt bikes, two single-engine air-
planes, a tractor-trailer, tents and more
than $100,000 worth of desperately need-
ed radio equipment. Says SAVE president
Ingrid Schroeder, “The Zimbabweans . . .
deserve all the help they can get.”

The Zambezi valley holds one of the
greatest concentrations of wildlife in the
world, but under the double canopy of rain
trees, ebony, acacia and mopani bushes, it
seems eerily empty. On a recent patrol the
silence was unbroken except by the angry
snap of a tsetse ﬂy and the call of a honey-
guide bird. Cradling riﬂes against their

 

chests, the rangers followed elephant
trails, stepping on leaves to avoid making
tracks on the dusty path. They' scanned
the ground, looking for footprints, broken
branches and overturned stones that
could signal the presence of poachers. At
least four gangs were known to be operat-
ing in the area. In whispered Shona, the
local language, Tatham told a scout, “I
want a gang of them now. I want four of
them and then eight of them.”

Pounding gait: On this day there were no
new signs of intrusion. As the sun set, the
rangers unpacked blackened pots and rus-
tled up the evening meal. The scouts dined
on sadza, a maize porridge they kneaded
into balls then dipped into beef stew. Sud-
denly there was movement in the bush. A
rhino, attracted by the scent of cooking
meat, bulled through the undergrowth.

MARK PETERS FOR NEWSWEEK
Turning back the clock: Consortium co-ownerEd Naude with one of his ostriches

 

Hunting for Profits

 

ark Sparrow had mixed feelings

when he sold off the last of his 5,000
prize cattle a few months ago. His fam-
ily had spent decades carving a thriving
beef ranch out of the parched bushland
of southeast Zimbabwe. Now Sparrow
was planning to turn back the clock: he
would restock his 75,000-acre Lone Star
ranch in Chiredzi with the region’s nat-
ural inhabitants—elephant, leopard
and antelope—gambling that ranching
wildlife would return an even higher
proﬁt than raising cattle. His experi-
ment is one of hundreds of similar re-
cent projects across southern Africa. If
they succeed, they could help preserve
some of Africa’s great herds.

Many experts see game ranching as a
natural ally to Africa’s national parks.
“We must broaden our horizons outside
the parks, something conservationists
have been loath to do until now,” says
N airobi-based Jonah Western of the
New York Zoological Society. “We must
cooperate with the private farmer.” Last
year Sparrow joined his Lone Star ranch
with the smaller properties of two neigh-
bors, Ed Naude and Clive Stockil, and
formed a 150,000acre game ranch abut-
ting the Gonarezhou National Park.
Their consortium has established a lu-
crative hunting concession, photo safa-
ris and an ostrich farm for skins; a croco-
dile farm is on the drawing board. Other
game ranches—there are already more
than 300 in Zimbabwe alone—are ex-
perimenting with mixed cattle-wildlife
spreads and commercial meat produc-
tion. Says Stockil, the consortium’s
managing director: “The potential is so

 

 

enormous we can’t develop it quickly
enough.”

Last month, as Sparrow and his part-
ners busily ripped down old cattle fences
to allow the wildlife free grazing, two
Americans from Philadelphia were
hunting the spread. James Falco and his
son, James J r., were spending $550 a day
for the privilege; it would cost them an
added $2,000 for any lion they shot,
$4,000 for an elephant. Hunting is prob-
ably the most lucrative aspect of private
game ranching. It is also controversial,
though Sparrow has no time for the
"bleeding hearts who cry about wildlife
but don’t produce the dollars to save it.”
Argues Sparrow: "N one of these species
is endangered, and some should even be
culled. Why not make a proﬁt from cull-
ing and churn it back into saving wildlife
overall? It may sound contradictory, but
we’ve got to put the highest price possi-
ble on an animal’s head to save him.”

Thus far the prospects are encourag-
ing—for the farmers and for wildlife. In
its ﬁrst year the new consortium yielded
$1.70 per acre from wildlife activities
compared with between 73 cents and
$1.45 per acre as a cattle ranch. N ation-
wide studies by the Parks Department
show the dollar return from wildlife run-
ning twice that of cattle. "The world has
gone mad in trying to identify with wild-
life,” says Sparrow. “We must channel
that enthusiasm now into meaningful
economic channels to save the animals.
Eventually the ledgers will tell whether
we have been successful. If they haven’t,
my head is on the chopping block.”

220 elephant tusks. The president ordered
his elite unit to patrol the national parks
from then on. That was a rare success story
in the battle against poachers. Park rang-
ers and police are often outnumbered and
outgunned by the raiders, some of whom
enjoy protection at the highest levels of
government. Experts believe many wild-
life services are riddled with corruption.
Some allege that rangers and wardens of-
ten shoot the animals themselves, and that
some park ofﬁcials and government minis-
ters control the horn-and-ivory trade and
protect the poachers.

The evidence of high-level indifference,
if not complicity, stretches across the waist
of Africa in an elephant line of death. In
Chad there were 15,000 elephants six years
ago; now there are 3,000. During the bloody
regime of Idi Amin, Uganda’s 20,000 ele-
phants were reduced to fewer than 3,000 by
unruly Army troops and poachers, who of—
ten used machine guns to mow down entire
herds. Ninety percent of Sudan’s elephant
population has been killed. Zaire’s herds
have been reduced by 60 percent. In parts of
Kenya 80 percent of the elephants have
been killed and the animals are now virtu-
ally extinct in Somalia. Even in the Ivory
Coast—so famous for its herds that the
country celebrated them in its name—only
a few scattered herds remain. Until a few
years ago, Tanzania’s remote Selous Game
Sanctuary housed some 100,000 elephants,
possibly the largest concentration in the
world. Unnoticed by the outside world,
wholesale slaughter in the last few years
has decimated the population.

[Deadly combination: The world’s appetite
for ivory seems to be insatiable. Last year
as many as 60,000 elephants were slaugh-
tered to service a $500 million industry
that produces an estimated 9 million ivory
pieces each year. As military budgets in
east Africa burgeoned, so did the number of
automatic weapons that found their way
onto the private market. An increase in
available weapons and in the number of
men trained to use them has proved a dead-
ly combination, particularly at a time
when ivory prices are at an all-time high.
Depending on quality and weight, an aver-
age 13—pound tusk sells for as much as $40
per pound. A 30—pound tusk will fetch a
premium $60 per pound.

According to the most recent estimates,
somewhere between 700,000 and 1 million
elephants remain in Africa. Unlike the
rhinos, they are not faced with immediate
extinction. But if the‘killings continue at
the current rate, experts warn of a catas—
trophe. "We’re talking about the danger of
a 95 percent reduction of the elephant pop-
ulation,” says Douglas-Hamilton. "This is
not speculation: it has already happened in
places. What we will end up with is a few
scattered populations of extremely fright-
ened young elephants.” The average

NEWSWEEK/AUGUSTII, 1986

 




 

weight of tusks arriving on the market has
dropped from 21 pounds eight years ago to
13 pounds today, an indication of the de-
struction of the older bull—elephant popula-
tion. “They have decimated the bigger
bulls,” says professional hunter Hurt;
“Now the poachers are moving against fe—
males and very young elephants. No ele-
phant is safe anywhere in Africa.” '

If avarice triggered the current assault
on the elephant and rhino, human expan-
sion will determine the ultimate fate of all
wildlife in Africa. The population of sub-
Saharan Africa is increasing at an annual
rate of 3 percent—the highest rate in the
world. By the year 2025 the population will
have tripled, to 1.64 billion people. Wildlife
will undoubtedly suffer as millions of peo-
ple move onto vast areas of marginal land.
' “Soon the only sanctuaries for wildlife will
be in the parks and on private land,” says
Sheldrick. "Outside these areas the ani-
mals are doomed.” Though governments
generally have kept the boundaries of na-
tional parks and reserves intact, and in
some instances have even extended them,
an inexorable human tide is straining
against these frontiers. Herdsmen feed
their cattle within the parks or blatantly
poach for meat and game trophies even in
such hallowed reserves as Tanzania’s
N gorongoro Crater. Human settlements
have crept up to the fence of Meru National
Park in east Kenya. A park’s best defense
may be its very remoteness and unsuitabil—
ity for human habitation. “A few decades
ago Africa was a sea of wild animals sur-
rounding a few islands of humans,” says
Hurt. "Today the reverse is true.”

Despite the dismaying statistics, conser-

vationists still nurture some hope. Rhino
sanctuaries—fenced-in enclosures that are
meticulously monitored—may well save
enough animals to allow them to survive in
small numbers. Kenya has designated one
sanctuary at Lake Nakuru for a govern-
ment experiment; if successful, the pro-
gram will be expanded to three other areas.
The hope is that in the comparative safety
of protected areas the rhinos will again be
able to breed and replenish their number.
American rhino expert Esmond Bradley
Martin has enjoyed a modest success in
encouraging Asian herbalists to substitute
the horn of the common Siberian saiga
antelope for rhino horn in their various
potions. He has also been actively cam-
paigning in North Yemen for the use of
substitute materials, like water buffalo
horn, to replace rhino horn in the manufac-
ture of dagger handles.

A tusk quota: Many conservationists are
calling for a complete ban on ivory trade,
but the commodity is too highly prized to
make that a realistic possibility. Ivory-pro-
ducing countries this year agreed to begin
monitoring ivory shipments in an effort to
curtail the. illegal trade. Each producing
country will submit a quota of tusks for
export based on the estimated number of
the nation’s live herds. Each tusk will be
numbered and its movements monitored
"worldwide. The success of the project will
depend on the honesty of hundreds of ofﬁ-
cials in many countries; that may be the
trophy most difﬁcult to bag.

Game ranching could also help (box). On
some 1,000 game ranches in southern Afri-
ca landowners have transformed their

 

property into wildlife spreads. They raise
funds by opening their premises to photo-
graphic and hunting safaris, and they cull
some of the herds for meat. To them, of
course, sound conservation measures be-
come not a luxury but a matter of commer-
cial survival.

Big-game hunting may also play its part
in preserving at least some of the herds.
Conscientious hunters set their sights on
old bulls only, sparing females and the
young for the perpetuation of the species.
The mere presence of professional hunters
actually deters poachers from shooting out
herds. “When we moved into the area re-
cently, the poachers moved out,” said Hurt.
“When we pull out, they will be back in a
ﬂash.” Hunting also generates revenue,
through permit and trophy fees, that, in
the best of worlds, should be reinvested in
the preservation of animals. "One cannot
be sentimental about wildlife,” says Hurt.
"It must pay for itself to survive.”

And it does. "Kenya has learned that
animals mean money,” Bradley Martin
says. Last year the east African nation
earned around $300 million from the
nearly half-million tourists who visited
the country. Impoverished African gov-
ernments will ultimately determine the
fate of their wildlife by coldblooded calcu-
lations of cost effectiveness, rather than
by moral or esthetic considerations. If
money talks loudly enough, some of Afri-
ca’s magniﬁcent animals will survive—-
but not before all too many have fallen
prey to human greed.

Los ANGELES TIMES - August 3, 1986

T. SHASTA CITY,
Calif—In several moun-

, tain areas of California,
there are some awfully funny look-
ing animals walking around.
They’ve got long ears, lots of wool,
carry packs and have feet like
ostriches.

Steve Biggs looked into his cor-
ral at his pack station in Mt. Shasta
City, almost in the shadow of
14,1162-foot—high Mt. Shasta,
‘looked at his 50-or-so llamas, and
tried to explain everything.

“I was teaching sociology in San
Francisco in 1977, when I saw an
article in Sports Illustrated about
llamas,” he said.

“I was a backpacker at the time,
and I became intrigued with the
possibilities of the llama as a pack
animal in California. I started driv—
ing around the state, talking to
people who bred llamas, learning
everything I could about the ani-
mals. In 1979, I bought three llamas
and moved up here.”

Today, Biggs has about 50 lla-
mas, three employees and takes
outdoor types into the Klamath and
Marble mountains and the Trinity
Alps on 3- to 5-day pack trips, at
costs from $255 to $400.

.If you like the idea of mountain
hiking in California but not the idea
of loading a 60—pound pack on your
back, hire a llama. Traditional
western American pack stations, of
course, have employed horses and
. mules for this sort of thing for more
than a century. So when llamas
started showing up on trails of the
Sierra Nevada, the Klamaths and
the' Marbles, there were sneers
aplenty from old-school types.

"‘Pack station operators like to
say that llamas spook their animals
when they meet on the trail,” Biggs
said. “But I’ve been taking llamas
into the mountains for eight sum—
rriers, and it hasn’t been a serious
problem yet. Sure, if a horse has

never seen a llama, it might get
jittery passing one on the trail. So
when we see a horse/mule pack
train coming, we pull our animals
as far off the trail as we can, and let
them pass.”

Traditional pack stations in Cali-
fornia’s mountain areas are com-
mon. In the Eastern Sierra alone,
there are 16. But over the past 10

 

years or so, it’s gotten so youuhave
to define what you mean by pack
animal”-—-horses, mules or llamas?

“There are three llama pack
stations in the state now,” said
Biggs, who is also president of the
International Llama Assn, a group
of about 800 US. llama raisers. The
group tries to prevent the importa-
tion of Chilean llamas. Prices of
US. llamas have escalated rapidly
in recent years—particularly fe-

males—and llama owners would
like to see the trend continue.
Presently, Biggs estimates, there
are from 8,000 to 10,000 llamas in
the United States.

“The demand seems to grow all
the time,” he said. “They’ve been
considered good pets for decades,
and they’re raised for their wool.
But as pack animals, llamas have
really caught on. They’re very
popular in Alaska now, there are 10
llama pack outfits there that I
know of.”

On a Shasta Llamas trip, hikers
gather at Biggs’ outpost in a green
valley in West Mt. Shasta City. He
lives in a 100-year-old farmhouse
where some Tom Mix movies were
filmed a half-century ago. Two of
Biggs’ wranglers, Will Murphy and
Bob Manley, jump into the llama

corral to find four animals for a
one-day hike.

The llamas aren’t willing partici-
pants. They scatter in all direc-
tions, forcing Murphy and Manley
to get a long rope, go to the far end
of the corral and walk to the barn,
forcing the llamas to a confined
area. At last, four are involuntarily
loaded onto a stock truck. When
the truck gate is slammed shut, the
animals begin to hum, and lay their
rabbit- like ears back.

“That’s their ‘moderate distress’
sound,” Biggs explained. “They’re
saying: ‘Hey, we just got back from
a five-day trip yesterday, don’t we
get a couple days off?’ ”

Next, Biggs, driving the stock
truck, led a small caravan of vehi-

area of the Klamath Mountains, he
drove up a Shasta-Trinity National
Forest road to a Pacific Crest Trail
trailhead, at a 6,000-foot elevation.
At a point where the Pacific Crest
Trail crossed the Forest Service

of Rosy, 7; Esteban, 61/2; Pablo, 3,
and Andy, 2%.

“The older animals will carry
over 100 pounds, but we rarely ask
them to,” Biggs said. “No one rides
them, not even kids. They’re strict-—
ly pack animals. Even at that,
llamas can carry more weight in
proportion to their body weight
than horses and mules. And they
eat a lot less—maybe two-thirds
less than a horse or a mule.”

Biggs put a smaller load on Andy,
the smallest and youngest llama.

“Andy here will only carry 20 or
30 pounds. This is his first trip. He’s
been halter-broken, and he’s hiked
with a halter, but hasn’t had to
carry anything until today.”

The day’s hikers were intro-
duced to their llamas, and, reins in
hand, set out. south on the Pacific
Crest Trail toward Mt. Eddy, about
four miles distant. The trail was
mostly level, carved on the side of a
timbered ridge. Looking west for
most of the hike, the bikers could
see the snow-capped Trinity Alps.
About a thousand feet below the
trail, in a long, green valley, bright
red and yellow tents could be made
out next to a small creek.

Hiking with a llama provides
clues of how they evolved, in the
high altitudes of the Andes, a
precipitous region of poor forage.

At each creek crossing or photo
stop, a distinctive trait of the llamas
was plainly seen. They will eat
anything-pine needles, weeds,
moss, grasses, tree bark, dead
chunks of wood—that’s green or
looks as if it used to be green. And,
like their camel cousins, llamas
drink very little water. On this trip,
Andy guzzled only two mouthfuls
of creek water all day.

In a few hours, the group stopped
at Upper Deadfall Lake, for lunch.
Biggs and Murphy tied the llamas
to small pines, and they immedi-
ately laid down in the grass and
remained quiet for the entire stop.

some of the animals that will be used for a pack trip that day.

group, touching off another chorus
of humming.

Murphy: “Llamas are wonderful,
low impact back country animals.
They’re very sure-footed, hardly
ever stumble, and their feet are so
soft a 300—pound animal can step on
your foot and not hurt you. They
don’t tear up the trails nearly as
bad as horses and mules. In fact,
they make less of a print on a trail
than a backpacker’s boot. And you
don’t have to turn them loose to
browse at night. You can stake
them or tie them to a tree and
they’re perfectly content.”

It is true, Biggs said, that llamas
spit.

“They’ll spit at each other during
fights over food,” he said. “But it’s
easy to train them not to spit
around people. One whack on the
snoot usually solves the problem.”

Llamas evolved in the Andes
regions of South America, at alti-
tudes up to 16,000 feet. Andean
people have raised them as pack
animals for the last 1,000 years.

Late in the day, on the way back
to the trailhead, Biggs said only a
minority of his 50 llamas actually
are used as pack animals.

“None of the females pack,
they’re too valuable,” he said. “Fe-
male llamas, in about 1977, were
worth about $2,500. Now, they’re
running $10,000 to $12,000. Males
run $1,500 to $2,000. Ideally, you

time, or taking care of their babies.
I only use about 15 of the males for
packing. I’d like to have 20 or 25,
and offer more trips.

“But all male llamas aren’t ideal
pack animals. Unlike mules or
horses, body types vary greatly in
llamas. For packing, you want
males that have long legs and lean
or medium builds, rather than
stocky-broad types, which tend to
be the best for wool production.

“I’ve considered the wool end of
the business, but never gone in that
direction. Llama wool goes for good
money, but it’s too labor intensive.

“As pack animals, they’re hard to
beat. Costs are much less than
having horses and mules. Feed
costs are about two-thirds less.
They don’t run up much in the way
of vet bills. Once in a while one-will
get an upset stomach, but Milk of
Magnesia usually solves the prob-
lem.”

Thissummer, Biggs figures his
llamas will pack in about 130 fly
fishermen, outdoors photographers
and hikers into the mountains. A
vegetarian, Biggs emphasizes back
country trips for the gourmand. At
dinner, for example, typical fare
might include some chilled white
Zinfandel, chips and dips, antipasto,
wheat pasta with mushroom sauce,
broccoli soup, vegetarian enchila-
das, potato pancakes with apple
sauce, fresh cakes and cheese-

cakes, and, on the season’s last trip,
champagne and ice cream.

And what do the llamas get?
More of the usual: tree bark, pine
needles, grass and weeds. And hold
the water.

Gentlemen:
Elease explain something to me ----

It is my understanding from.information received in the mail
today, that three Senators have refused their consent to place
the reathorization bill for Endangered Species on the Senate
agenda. How can three out of so many, have suCh authority?

It seems to me that past experience should have proved that the
OVERWHELMENG MAJORITY of the American people want the Endangered
Species Act, or it would never have been passed several years
ago. Why these 3 are now taking such a stand is difficult to
understand. They are answerable not only to the people of their
own states, but to ALL the people.

The remark of Senator Steven Symms (R—ID) who said that threatened
wolves and grizzlies "make nice carpets", is absolutely inexcuse-
abel and unbelievable. Where has this nan.been for the past ten or
more years While so many people have been working to change this
idiotic thinking? It doesn't sound like a statement from an edu-
cated, caring individual.

The three Senators Who rerse to consent to the placing of the
Endangered Species Act on the agenda of the Senate should be made

to give their reasons - the above, plus SenatorsAlan Simpson (RrWY)
and Howell Heflin (D-AL). Apparently these Senators do not realize
that it is actions such as theirs, which fOrce animal activists to
take the measures they sometimes do to awaken the public as to what
is going on. Is this what the 3 want? I do not believe in the
violence, but I also do not blame one bit those who partake of it

in order to help the animals..

I would like an answer from you three gentlemen, please.
Sincerely, '

Honorable Mack.Mattingly
Senator from.Georgia
Senate Office Building
Mbshington, DC 20510

Dear Mack:
any thanks for your reply to my letter re the Pet Protection Act of 1986.

Of course, you have right to feel as you do that it is okay for animals
from animal shelters to be turned over to research labs. There are liter-
ally millions of people who disagree vehemently with.you, and I am cer-
tainly one of them.

we are all aware of the many discoveries and advancements the medical pro-
fession has made over the years, and credit for these should not be dimin-
ished. What many people don't know is that many of the greatest medical
discoveries have been made without the use of live animals. The following
are just a few:

Penicillin (1929 by Alexander Flemming)

Discovery of the cause andnethod of transmission of yellow fever
Small pox vaccine (1796, by Edward.Jenner)

Polio hot pack therapy (by Sister Kenney)

Insulin (by Banting)

Sulfa drugs

Ether (1846 by William.Morton)

Germ.theory (by Spalianziani, Louis Pasteur and others)

Quinine (1820)

Radium (1898, byaMarie and Pierre Curie)

The microscope, the thermometer and the stethoscope were all discovered
without sacrificing animals.

The cruel experiments we read about are unnecessary because there are modern
alternatives that are more accurate, less expensive and far less time-con-
suming than.the use of live animals.

The hundreds of baboons that were tortured and killed at the Gennarelli lab—
oratory at the Univ. of Pa. could.have been replaced by a.single robot.
These robots simulate human beings in that they can breathe, bleed, react,
cough, vomit, all at the touch of a button. Such robots are being used by
General Motors to test the effects of car crashes, and at the Univ. of Nﬁami
in its Cardiology Dept.

Nhny of us have read about the burning of sheep and other animals at the
Shrine Burns Institute in Galveston, Texas. An unanesthetized sheep is

first charred over half of its body; then smoke is blown into its lungs,
and finally its lungs are filled with water to see how long it will take
it to drown.

  




_ 2 _

The burned and drowned sheep could have been spared their agony by cell-
and-organ culture techniques which.have been developed for the study of
burn and smoke inhalation. .A robot named "Thermo—Nhn“ has been invented
to test burns on the body.

Cancer research using live animals is unnecessary, redundant and archaic.
In the many decades of this research, millions of animals have been.sacri-
ficed, and.we still know relatively little about the cure for cancer.

Many tests can replace animal testing. The Ames Test, for example, is an
in vitro method used to screen chemicals for carcinogenicity as well as
capacity to cause mutations. This test takes from.48 to 72 hours and costs
about $200, as opposed to similar animal tests that take two to three years
and cost over $200,000. Since Reagan is so anxious to save us money, this
matter should be thoroughly investigated by Congress before any more money
is turned over for this kind of research.

If such modern.methods are available, why aren't they usad more widely? ‘\::]§190 if'

Even the most dimwitted of us can figure. that one out. There are a num- " VI
ber of reasons all based on the fact that animal research is a multimillion ,
dollar business, and those who benefit from it don't want it disturbed. "gaggi’

Researchers want large federal grants whiCh they can obtain for expensive '
annual experiments. .Also, they continue to work on live animals from habit,
apparently not wanting to take the time from.their lucrative business to

learn the newer, modern methods.

It would behoove the vivisectors to come out of their Dark Ages and begin
to recognize that this is theAge of the Computer. Animals no longer need
to be subjected to pain and suffering.

It would also behoove the members of Congress to do more investigating as
to what really goes on in research laboratories, instead of waiting for
organizations concerned about animals to break in, steal material and then
show it to Congress as was done by PETA with re the Gennarelli laboratory,
and other organizations at the Univ. of So. Calif.

I didn't mean to write a novel, Mack, but I am so concerned about the over
use of animals in laboratories, and the billions of taxpayers' dollars
which are spent annually to help this suffering to continue. I hope you
'will do some investigating of your own.

Sincerely,

GMrs.) Constance F. Yarbrough

Dear Connie:

Thank you for your recent letter concerning the Pet
Protection Act of 1986.

As you know, this legislation, House bill 4871, would
prohibit the use of federal funds granted through the National
Institutes of Health for the purchase of "pound animals" for
research purposes. The bill was introduced on May 21, 1986, and
referred to the Subcommittee on Heath of the House Committee on
Energy and Commerce. There is no companion bill in the Senate.

I do not condone the inhumane treatment of animals nor do I
condone research that is not necessary for the protection of
human life and health. We must ensure humane treatment of
animals as well as provide adequate resources for medical
research. Because animals are necessary in some areas of
research and because pound animals can be used in certain
experiments, I do not believe that a prohibition on the use of
animals from shelters is in the best interest of medical
research. Nor do I believe that using "purpose—bred" animals in
medical research is more humane than using pound animals.

Again, thank you for your letter.

Sincerely,

/

MEMPHIS COB-MERCIAL APPEAL - July 23, 1986

 

4195811":«ManonKin-mas- .‘ .

 

Worldwide concern has been ex-
pressed about the killing of large
numbers of kangaroo, the familiar
symbol of Australia. Is it a needless
threat to an endangered species, or a
necessary procedure? '

 

In today’s debate, US. Rep. Robert
J. Mrazek (D-N.Y), a member of the
House Appropriations Committee,
argues for a bill that would reinstitute
a ban on importing kangaroo pro-
ducts to this country.

On the other side of the issue, lan
A. Dawes, information counselor for
the Australian Embassy in Washing-
ton, says culling of huge herds of kan-
garoo is necessary, and is done hu-
manely.

 

 

Congress can help stop slaughter

 

By Rep. Robert J. Mrazek

 

IN one sense, Australia’s treatment of

kangaroos is the equivalent of
America declaring open season on the
bald eagle.

Other than perhaps the koala, no
creature is as inextricably linked to
the spirit and reality of Australia as the
kangaroo. Yet kangaroos are being
hunted down by the millions in the
name of greed. Americans have an op-
portunity to be heard on this matter.

Despite official protestations by
the Australian government, at least 10
species of kangaroos and wallabies,
their smaller cousins, are in danger of
eventual extinction. Because hun-
dreds of thousands of these species
still exist, the situation is deceiving.

It is clear that market forces more
than any other factor are in control of
the fate of these species. The demand
for kangaroo hides for sport shoes,
handbags and fur products, and for
kangaroo meat for pet food and human
consumption, will determine the fate
of the kangaroo.

I HAVE INTRODUCED legislation
that would reinstate a government ban
lifted by the Reagan administration in
1981 against the importation of kanga-
roo products. While the majority of
kangaroo-product imports do not come
to this country, a sizable percentage is
eventually re-exported from Europe
and Asia.

It is clear that a lack of American
demand for kangaroo products can tip
the scales in favor of these species’ sur-
vival. My bill covers importations of

products from the red, Eastern grey
and Western grey kangaroo species, all
listed as “threatened” under the US.
Endangered Species Act of the 19703.

The plight of the kangaroo is a clas-
sic example of human exploitation of a
remarkable species, similar in fact to
our own destruction of the buffalo
herds in the 19th century. Lip service
is paid in Australia to the idea of the
kangaroo as pest, destroying crops and
competing with domestic livestock for
scarce resources. .

Doubtless, kangaroos do account
for the loss of crops, as do insects, oth-
er wildlife and an atrocious record of
land management in Australia. But no
damning evidence exists to justify, for
example, the slaughter of 2.3 million
kangaroos in 1982, at the same time
that a devastating drought was causing
the animals not to reproduce.

KANGAROOS ARE KILLED accord-
ing to quotas devised by the “manage-
ment” programs overseen by the five
Australian state governments and the
national government. The quotas are
generally an arbitrary 15 percent of a
species’ population. Each skin or car-
cass is tagged for later accounting.

Given the climate surrounding the
kangaroo “harvest," it is difficult to be-
lieve that the few large companies
which form a cartel in control of the
commercial kangaroo industry act as
corporate saint. Nothing is to prevent
the tags from being recycled to in-
crease “legal” kangaroo kills. Further,
where animals of commercial value
exist, poachers are never far behind.

Finally, there is a political facet to
the story. The Australian National
Parks and Wildlife Service provides
implicit support to the industry

through the quota system. And politi-
cal expediency dictates that a Labour _
Party government facing the prospect
of losing power with the surrender of
only nine seats should protect its own ,
hide. One way to do this is to eliminate ;
the “pesky" kangaroos and gain the :
support of rural voters. '

A recent judicial ruling for a tem- 3
porary export ban on a challenge to a i
kangaroo-management program in the ‘
state of Queensland has made clear
that some Australians are intent upon
giving the kangaroos an even chance.

The management programs will be
challenged further.

Yet, the government is hardly in-
timidated. The ministry for Arts, Heri-
tage and the Environment archly an-
nounced that the government action
constituted a “suspension, not a ban,”
and that “following review and neces-
sary amendment to management pro-
grams, exports could recommence.”

No doubt, the suspension will end,
and the slaughter will go on.

BUT THERE ARE alternatives, as
Greenpeace has pointed out. Nonlethal
control methods can be implemented
to prevent agricultural damage. And
standards should be established to reg-
ulate kangaroo hunters and their pro-
ficiency, and to stop the brutal slaying
of kangaroo joeys. It is nothing less
than humane and proper.

We can do our part by reducing the
sizable financial incentive for contin-
uing the slaughter of a fascinating
class of animals.

We should act now in Congress to
stop the importation of kangaroo pro-
ducts. After all, we wouldn’t export
bald eagles, would we?

Kangaroo culling done humanely

 

By Ian A. Dawes

 

PPOSITION to the culling of kanga-

roos is often based on claims that

are misleading, in some cases deliber-
ately so.

Among them are that cruelty is
widespread; that kangaroos are in dan-
ger of extinction; that culling is uncon-
trolled and that the only reason for the
cull is the trade in kangaroo products.

These claims are all untrue.

Kangaroos belong to the Superfa-
mily Maropodoidea. The family has 48
member species, ranging from tiny
creatures to kangaroos as tall as hu-
mans. Of the 48 species, seven are com-
mercially harvested.

Each of the seven species commer-
cially harvested is abundant and in no
danger of extinction. Indeed, it is be-
cause of their abundance that culling
is carried out.

OF THE OTHER 41 species some are
rare. Conservation programs are de-
signed to ensure their survival.

Of the seven species commercially
harvested the largest numbers killed
are of red, eastern grey and western
grey kangaroos. The combined ranges
of these three species covers most of
Australia.

The combined population of the
red, eastern grey and western grey in
1984 was estimated at 13.3 million. Sur-
veys in pastoral areas in 1985 found in-

The objectives oi Austraiia’s kan-
garoo management programs are to

maintain kangaroo populations at via-
ble numbers for all species over their
natural ranges, and to contain adverse
effects on agriculture to acceptable
levels. This is an internationally ac-
cepted approach to environmental
management.

Kangaroos do compete with live-
stock. Generally, Australian farms can
tolerate moderate populations of kan-
garoos. However, farmers believe
numbers should not be so high that
they have serious detrimental effects
on the environment and agriculture.

COMMERCIAL harvesting of kan-
garoos is used because it allows wild-
life authorities to strictly control the
cull, it can be used as an effective man-
agement tool to control populations,
and the commercial use of culled kan-
garoos avoids waste of hides and other
products.

The export value of kangaroo pro-
ducts to Australia is in the region of
$7.4 million a year, not a large sum.
There is no truth in the suggestion
that kangaroos are only killed for the
money kangaroo products earn.

If commercial harvesting of kanga-
roos was stopped, the kangaroo would
still have to be culled. Landholders
would undertake their own programs
to control, probably using the cheapest
methods available. There would be
less expert shooting and increased suf-
fering of wounded animals. It is likely
that poison would be used, resulting in
other species being killed and, inevita-
bly, increased suffering.

Quotas for the culling are set each
ytu after consultation between feder—
al and state wildlife author? :ies. There
is no evidence to support the claim
that the illegal killing of kangaroos is 3

million a year, higher than the set quo-
ta for 1986.

A study by the Royal Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
(RSPCA), an association devoted to
animal welfare, and to the incidence of
cruelty in kangaroo culling, found
that, “If achieved correctly, kangaroo
culling is considered one of the most
humane forms of animal slaughter.”

It did not find that cruelty existed
to any great extent and found that
while harvesting operations were not
perfect, the education of shooters
through a recent report, “A Code of
Practice for the Humane Shooting of
Kangaroos” should help further en~
sure humane killing.

The RSPCA stressed that while it
was not in a position to decide whether
there should be a kangaroo industry,
at no stage did it recommend “that le-
gal commercial culling should be
stopped because of excessive cruelty."
The report said that such action
“would not reduce the number of kan-
garoos killed but would force land-
holders to use methods considered in-
humane.”

IT IS ALSO worth remembering
that Australia is a western democracy.
The members of the Australian gov-
ernment must, as must members of
Congress, listen to the voices of their
electorates.

While the majority of Australians
accept the need for a kangaroo culling
program to conserve the kangaroo and
protect farming, they would, if the pro-
gram inflicted large scale cruelty or
even remotely endangered the surviv-

After two' years of study, the US.
Navy today will begin trapping red
foxes that threaten the survival of
two endangered bird species at a
wildlife refuge in the Seal Beach
Naval ' Weapons Station, a base
spokesman said Friday. .

“The first traps are going to be
set this weekend,” said Curt Sand-
berg, acting public information of -
ficer at the base.

The Navy hired a state-licensed

to remove the 50 to 60
foxes, which have been preying on
critical breeding pairs of
light-footed clapper rails and least

‘ terns at the Seal Beach National ,

Wildlife Refuge, a 1,100—acre salt-
marsh inside the 5,000-acre base.
Both birds, once common along
the California coast, are on the
federal list of endangered species.

Only five pairs of breeding clap-

“The clapper rail may be our

Wildlife Service in the Southern
California region.

“They are really in trouble just

Santa Barbara south to the Mexican

Least terns have been so threat-

But how many of these puppies will end up

being dumped after their keepers tire of.

Pe0ple like Mrs. Finn should visit the Hu-

The city will end the contro-
versral practice of selling a

mals from the airy pound to the
; Umversrty of Tennessee at Mem-

phis for use in medical research,

, Mayor Dick Hackett said yester-

day.

Hackett said he notified Dr.
James C. Hunt, chancellor of the
university, that the agreement
between the city and the medi-
cal school will be terminated
Dec. 31. The city stopped selling
animals to other research facili-
ties two years ago.

The number of animals sold by
the Memphis Animal Shelter for
research has declined markedly

in the last few years. Hackett ’

said.
“Because of the reduced usage

of shelter animals, I am con- i

vinced that the value of this pro-
gram is no longer sufficiently
worthwhile and should be dis-
continued,” he said.

“And I have been assured it

will not have an overwhelming

negative impact on UT.”

Dr. Hunt said the university
will rely on other sources for an-
imals for research and educa-
tional purposes. He said the loss

of the animals from the shelter
.. will not cripple research. ' ‘

Animal lovers have cam-

paigned to stop the sale of

shelter animals for research.

Vets unveil
better care
for pets

By Durmeriss Cruver
USA TODAY

ATLANTA —— Pet owners
are demanding better health
care for their animals, and
USA veterinarians are re-
sponding with chemotherapy,
new vaccines, braces for teeth
and sprays to ﬁght bad breath.

A peek at what’s new, ac-
cording to vets attending the
ﬁve-day American Veterinary
Medical Association meeting,
which ends here today:

I Cancer therapy. The
same treatment given to hu-
mans is now being applied to
pets, including chemotherapy
and radiation. And there’s a
new, ﬁrst-of-its-kind vaccine to
prevent feline leukemia.

IDentistry. More vets are
giving dogs root canals, and
now on the market is a meat-
ﬂavored dog toothpaste. For
your dog’s bad breath and
plaque build-up, a medicated
tooth and mouth spray is ex-
pected to be out in January.

I Dermatology. A survey of
540 USA vets shows that ﬂea
irritation and other skin prob—
lems in dogs and cats are on
the rise. The reason: extreme
heat and poor grooming.

The latest skin care product
is an odorless and greaseless
ﬂea and tick dip.

I Weight control. More vets
are recommending low-salt di-
ets and dietary management
for pets.

IInsurance. Coverage for
medical bills is available.

Animal shelter owners” son-in-law ordered jailed

By Anne Cowles
Staff “’rifer

The son-in-law of the owners of Life
For God‘s Stray Animals was ordered
Thursday to spend 10 days in jail under
the same contempt order that caused Ann
and Jerry Fields to flee two weeks ago.

Rockdale County Superior Court Judge
Clarence Vaughn ordered Ronnie Denney,
head foreman of the shelter for the past
three years, to report to jail by 5 pm.
Monday.

“According to Mr. Denney, Ann P.
Fields contacts him by phoning him at
various pay telephones. Their method of
operation is to use a different telephone
each time.

“Mr. Denney is told during each con-
versation the location of the next pay tele-

phone that will be used to contact him,”“

Vaughn said in his order.

“Mr. Denney is in contempt of court,
based on his knowledge of the previous
court orders-and his current conduct
which constitutes a willful violation of the
court’s orders,” Vaughn concluded.

Denney could not be reached for com-
ment, and attorney Abe Sharony, who rep-
resents Life For God‘s Stray Animals, was
on vacation.

But during testimony Wednesday, Den-
ney said he would obey any orders the
court imposed on him.

Vaughn has yet to rule on another mo-
tion by County Attorney John Nix seeking
authorization to try to collect $164,500 in
contempt fines from the shelter and its op-
erators.

The motion to find Denney in con-
tempt of court was brought by homeown-

ers who have been battling the Farmer
Road shelter in court for several years.

The Fieldses disappeared July 8 after
they were ordered jailed on contempt
charges for not moving all 1,200 of their
animals to a new location on Miller Bot-
tom Road so they would not be a nuisance
to homeowners in the area.

Vaughn ruled in January 1984 that the
shelter was a public and private nuisance.
His decision was subsequently upheld by
the Georgia Supreme Court.

Denney testified Wednesday that Mrs.
Fields left him signed blank checks that
he fills in with amounts to pay employees
and bills.

He testified that he knew the Fieldses
had been ordered to cease Operations at
the Farmer Road site, although only about
450 animals have been moved to the new
site.

“Komodo dragons are intelligent

eight feet charge at high speed and
occasionally devour human beings."

It seems only 7,000 of them exist. ‘

Give that census taker a combat rib-

the island of Komodo, which. as you
know, is in Indonesia’s Lesser Sunda
Archipelago. I thought it was the
Greater Sunda Archipelago. but
that’s what happens when you don’t
go to the right schools. .

Anyway. the island needs rain,
and a major fire could knock out the
dragons.

I suppose the lesson to be drawn
from this is that if you are a fire-
fighter in an arson-plagued neigh-
borhood, you have problems, but
thank your civil-service rating your
district does not include Komodo.

“Save those dragons, Flaherty.”

“Your momma. captain!" .

Scientists say the dragons may
someday need human aid to survive.
Well, I certainly do not wish to see a
. fire on Komodo, but why should I get
too upset by the plight of dragons.
Tell them not to breathe fire if they
want a safe neighborhood. Just how
guilty must we liberals be? It is one
thing to lend a hand to one’s neigh-

END OF WHALING IN PROSPECT AT LAST

 

All commercial whaling is
to end within two years,
after decisions to call a halt
announced last week by
Japan and Norway. The
decisions, climax of a long.

conservationists and
whaling nations, represent a
partial victory for both
sides. The

finally achieved the "

PRIVATE pets can become pub-

Congress tucked into a 1983

whether they are reasonable.

Reasonable rules governing

TAMPA TRIBUNE - July 25, 1986

etS Quint

to study an disease

Abnormal Stomach rhythms may be
connected to a bloating disorder that can kill
dogs, the UP researcher says.

GAINESVILLE (AP) - A Uni-
versity of Florida researcher sus-
pects that electrical activity of the
stomach may be the cause of bloat-
ing that kills as many as 36,000 dogs
a year in the United States.

The disorder, known as gastric
dilatation-volvulus, causes a dog’s
stomach to fill with air and gas and
becomes football-sized. The bloated
stomach presses against other or
gans and stops the blood flow. The
dog goes into shock and dies.

The problem occurs mostly in
large, deep-chested breeds such as
German shepherds and Great
Danes.

“We have identified, in re-
covered dogs, an abnormal rhythm
of the slow waves of the stomach,”
said Dr. Colin Burrows, associate
professor of veterinary medicine.

“Dysrhythmias have been identi-
fied in people with unexplained
chronic gastrointestinal disorders,
such as chronic bloating, nausea and
vomiting. Once the dysrhythmia has
been corrected, with drugs or elec-
trical pacing, the problem disap-
pears. We speculate that the same
thing may be happening in suscepti-
ble dogs.”

Burrows has received a $30,000
grant from the Morris Animal Foun-
dation to investigate this possible
cause of the disease.

Diet, exercise, greedy eating and
one large meal a day have been

ruled out as possible causes, but he
said they may be factors in initiating
the disease.

In simple cases, treatment in-
volves the use of anti-shock drugs
and insertion of a tube inthe dog’s
stomach to relieve- the pressure.

About half of the time, the dog's
stomach twists and surgery is re-
quired to undo the twist and sew the
stomach to the abdominal wall to
prevent recurrence.

Costs for surgical treatment
range from $400-$800, but Burrows
said the cost will be partly under-
written in dogs participating in the
study.

Burrows wants to test the dogs of
clients brought in for treatment of
the disease by implanting electrodes
in the stomach wall.

They will detect the electrical
activity in stomach muscles and
record them. If abnormalities are
found in the patterns, then Burrows
will know if he’s found the cause of
the disease.

The hormone epinephrine may
play a role in the disease. He said
dysrhythmias can be induced in
dogs by injecting them with epine-
phrine.

“We are speculating that if we
can identify this as a cause, we may
be able to prevent bloating in sus-
ceptible dogs, which would be a step
in the right direction."

One night about 10 years
ago, Ruffin, a young
thoroughbred colt destined
for stardom at Hollywood
Park, injured his leg in his
stall. With that, his racing
days were over.

Enter Zola Da Virro, who
had excelled as an equestri-
an in her youth and, then 29,
was reaching what she de—
scribes as “the first of many
mid-life crises.” She’d put
her husband through school,
and his career was taking off.
Two children were growing
up fast. In short, she needed
a new game. “I wanted
something that would con-
sume my every waking and
sleeping moment and keep
me from contemplating the
meaning of life too thor-
oughly.” She decided to buy
a horse.

Ruffin was the only choice
for the job, a horse with little
training. What Da Virro set
out to do with him is some-
thing akin to taking a 5-year-
old child and educating him
or her to a doctorate of phi-
losophy, a process that can
be accomplished with a hu-
man in, say, 20 years, if all
lights are green. It took sev-
en years for Da Virro and
Ruffin to reach the PhD. lev-
el of horsedom, and three
years more to practice, polish

what’s important in a Grand

and conformation, or the
horse’s structure. If a horse
isn’t able to withstand the
physical and mental de-

Ruffin has clearly got what
it takes, and he loves to play
the game. He‘s about as

quirks, as one might expect
(and always tolerate) in the

Now, Da Virro and Ruffin
compete at Grand Prix level
in dressage. the equestrian
sport that captivated the pub-
lic during the 1984 Olym—

means, simply, training and
education. A horse is
schooled to complete obedi-
ence in a series of precision
movements including such
elementary maneuvers as
walk. trot and canter, the
three natural gaits we all as-

sociate with horses. At Grand
Prix level, on the other hand,
the horse and human must
execute 51 movements with
unity and elegance. These
include extension and col-
lection of the three basic

Although Da Virro makes a game of

Honking for the Monkeys:

Fanatics Have Their Uses

By. Charles Krauthammer

WASHINGTON -- Drive by the
National Institutes of Health in
suburban Washington and you see trou-
ble. The bumper stickers say “Liberate
Laboratory Animals” and the signs say
“Honk for the Silver Spring Monkeys.”

The issue is no longer freeing 15 mon-
keys from a Silver Spring, Maryland, lab
where, for the sake of understanding

strokes in humans, they were subjected.

to brain-damaging injuries. That fight
was won years ago. The monkeys are out
and the research terminated.

This fight is over the proper rest home
for these monkeys. The NIH first had
them in cages in Poolesville, Maryland.
Under pressure, it sent them to a more
open environment in Louisiana. People
for the Ethical Treatment of Animals
demands that they live out their days at
a “primate park” (Primarily Primates,
Incorporated) in Texas. One demonstra-
tor — “prepared to die” —went on a 64-
day hunger strike over the issue.

I am no expert on retirement homes
for monkeys, but this seems to me to be
going a bit far. Then again, the animal
rights crusade is about going far. Its
soldiers want not just to stop the abuse
of animals in the laboratory. They want
to stop the use of animals in the labora-
tory. If they had their way the labs
would be shut down, the animals freed
and medical science devastated.

The animal rights cause is a form of
fanaticism. It places one value, admit-
tedly an important one, above all others.
But there are values other than the pre-
vention of animal suffering. One of
these is the prevention of human suffer-
ing through medics? advances, many of
which rest on animal experimentation.

And yet we owe these fanatics a great
debt. If you work in an animal lab you
know they are outside demonstrating
and sometimes inside infiltrating. (That
is how the Silver Spring monkeys were
discovered.) It makes you doubly careful
about how you treat your animals.

“Extremism in the defense of liberty
is no vice,” said Barry Goldwater in
1964. That is certainly wrong. Extrem-
ism in the defense of anything is a vice.
Yet for a society the presence of a mass
of contending extrernisms 'is a virtue. It
helps produce a moderation that would
otherwise be impossible.

Madison, of course, was the great
theorizer of such a system of contending
factions. As he thought, factions con-
strain and moderate each other, re-
straining majority enthusiasms.

Enthusiasm for nuclear power, for ex-
ample. Chernobyl is the latest example
of Madison’s wisdom. Societies that do
not permit contending extremisms, i.e.
pluralism, are subject to catastrophic

headlong plunges, like the Soviets’ crash

nuclear power program. Where the nu-
clear imperative is not constrained by
busloads of Diablo Canyon anti-nuclear
fanatics, safety can be ignored.

After Chernobyl there was much self -
congratulation about US. nuclear safe-
ty. That was not something that those
who believe in the nuclear imperative
could take credit for. Credit was due
anti-nuclear fanatics who have argued
and demonstrated and litigated and ca-
joled society into nuclear safety.

Of course, if they had their way we
would have not safer nuclear power but
no nuclear power. The paradox for a
pluralist society is that extremists must
be resisted and at the same time wel-
comed. It would be disastrous if they
ever won. It would be only just less
disastrous if they went home.

The same is true of the anti-porno-
graphy fanatics. feminist and bluenose
alike. They are a threat to free speecl‘i,
yet their critique (particularly the femi-
nist critique) is valuable. It makes us
rethink perhaps not what ought to be
legally permitted but what ought to be
socially sanctioned.

The point is that an extremist is the
last person to whom you want to give
power but the first to whom you might
want to give the floor. Such is the project
of pluralism. Every fanatic, whether for
monkeys or for motherhood, is granted
the power of petition and contention.
The result is a brilliant scheme for har-
nessing the energy that lies at the politi-
cal extremes and for deflecting it to
produce a moderating effect.

Banning experimentation or nuclear
power or pornography are terrible ideas,
but we need the extremists who believe
in them. They keep the rest of us honest.

«0 il leases ~

By The Associated Press

WASHINGTON — Federal agencies
have awarded 4.7 million acres of oil and
gas leases in the national forests surround-
ing Yellowstone National Park that could
threaten scenery and wildlife if ever de-
veloped, the Sierra Club said Monday.

Current planning by the Forest Service
is inconsistent from forest to forest, the
club said in endorsing a bill that would re-
quire designation of suitable and unsuit-
able leasing areas in the forests.

The bill, sponsored by Rep. John Sei-
berling, D-Ohio, and others is the subject
of hearings today by the national parks
subcommittee of the House Interior Com-

mittee that Seiberling chairs. The Sierra

.Club held a news conference to release a

study of oil and gas leasing around Yellow-
stone. ,

Among other things, Seiberling’s bill
would give the Forest Service control of
leasing on its lands. Currently the service
can only make recommendations to the In-
terior Department’s Bureau of Land Man-
agement, which decides whether to issue
leases.

Of the six national forests that almost
encircle Yellowstone and adjacent Grand
Teton National Park, two -— Beaverhead
and Custer — do not contain so-called “sit-

uation l” habitat for grizzly bears, a ‘

Situation 1 habitat is an area used by the
bear that biologists say is essential to the
bear’s survival.

Draft forest plans for two other forests
— Shoshone and Bridger-Teton — would
not permit leasing in most of their situa-
tion 1 areas. But similar draft plans for the
Gallatin and Targhee would permit leas-
ing, the report said.

“The conﬂicting approaches to mineral
activity in essential grizzly habitat is a
prime example of the confused nature of
minerals management in the forests near
Yellowstone,” the club’s report said.

“It becomes even more dramatic if you

Eagle Nest Found

A family of three bald eagles is
nesting in the El Dorado National
Forest near Placerville, according
to the US. Forest Service.

“It’s the southernmost recorded
nesting since at least World War
11,” said Mariann Armijo, a Forest
Service wildlife biologist. “Maybe
they’re returning to this part of
their native grounds after all these
years.”

Armijo added , hat the eagles,
first identified in late May, proba-
bly arrived at the Union Valley
Lake site in March to set up their

area, group claims

consider the fact that the coordination of
grizzly management activities among the
forests and between the forests and parks
is frequently cited by the Forest Service
as an excellent example of integrated eco-
system managemen

“The grizzly bear is a very sensitive
species. . . . Any appearance of humans
drives him away,” said Philip Hocker, 3
Sierra Club director.

The report said development of a natu-
ral gas field adjacent to Canada’s Water-
ton National park in Alberta has resulted
in a pronounced decline in the number of
grizzly bears in the area, in part because
of illegal hunting made easier by roads cut

for use of the gas installations.

Though more than 200 wells have been
drilled around Yellowstone, only five have
found anything. Four are producing natu-
ral gas, the report said.

The report recommended, among other
things, that the Forest Service adopt a pol-
icy of no leasing in critical grizzly habitat.

Pit bull terrier. Even the name of the latest in
“macho dogs” sounds tough.

They are stocky and muscular, with physiques
on the order of Sylvester Stallone and a growing
reputation as the Rambos of dogdom. They have be
come the hottest topic in the animal world, prompt-
ing Tufts Veterinary School to schedule a special
conference for Thursday to separate fact from myth
about the dogs.

Pit buli loyalists, such as Denise DePaolis of Sau—
gus who owns three American pit bull terriers, in-
sist that the dogs, originally bred for bull-baiting
and for fighting, can be wonderful family pets.
Many local officials say they are killer dogs and
want them out of their communities

Following a spate of attacks, the city of Lynn this
week permanently banished from the city several
breeds known popularly as pit bulls. .

In Worcester, a grand jury charged three persons
with “assault and battery with dangerous weapons,
to wit: two pit bull terriers." Over the Fourth of July
weekend alone, the city received reports of five inci-
dents involving pit bulls, one in which a person was
hospitalized. One woman had “the dress torn off of
her" and her handbag shredded. said Raymond
Bergman Jr.. Worcester's chief animal control offi—
cer.

Bans are being considered in that city and in at
least two other Massachusetts communities.

BOSTON GLOBE - July 19,1998

A hot dog gestheol‘d shoulder

Pit bull breed banished in Lynn; loyalists attack “canine racism”

 

     

“I think it’s unfair,” DePaolis said. "Any dog can
rip you apart, not just a pit bull." If there is going to
be a law, she said, it should apply to all vicious dogs.

Tufts veterinary dean Franklin M. Loew said the
bans could be the beginning of “canine racism.”

As the popularity of pit bulls has increased in
recent years, so have reports of the dogs running
amok.Eight dogs killed people during the past year,
according to the Humane Society of the United
States: six of them were pit bulls. It is estimated that
500,000 of the country’s 55 million dogs are pit
bulls.

Dog officers and animal behavior experts say
this group of dogs may attack without warning and
often without provocation. Because of their fighting
ancestry, they tend to pull and tear, causing more
severe injuries than the run-of-the-mill dog.

Debates about bans of pit bulls have been com~
plicated because this isn’t a single breed of dog but a
family that includes several named breeds, as well
as many unregistered dogs that are still used for
dog—fighting in this country. The sport is outlawed
in 30 states. including Massachusetts.

 

GloWhotJ Blanding
Patches, a pit bull terrier, belongs to Tom DePao-
lis of Saugus.

According to Randall Lockwood of the US Hu-
mane Society. most of the fighting dogs have been
bred solely for such behavior. Thereibre, he said,
they can look like almost anything — from a heavy
greyhound to an oversized pug.

T 0 make things even more confusing. some dogs
that are classically pit bulls in appearance. such as
the American Staffordshire terrier, have been bred
to overcome their fighting ancestry. Carter Luke of
the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruo
city to Animals said he has seen no problems with
the breed.

Lockwood, who said he has witnessed the best
and worst of pit bulis, said iilegal dog-fighting is per—
petuating dogs that are hazards to humans and oth-
er animais. Shaped by dog—fight enthusiasts, they
are “a perversion of everything normai dogs should
do. What they've created. is a canine psychopath."

' SHOW 0F SUPPORT: Ronnie Denny gets a hug from a supporter Monday as he leaves the animal
shelter on Farmer Road after being granted an appeal on contempt of court charges.

Animal shelter facing deadline
for mamntanng charity status

 

By Anne Cowles
Staff Writer .

 

Officials in the Georgia secretary of state’s of-
fice have said they will withdraw the charitable or-
ganization status of the Rockdale County no-kill ani-
mal shelter, Life For God’s Stray Animals, if the
owners do not file pr0per financial disclosure forms
by the end of August.

If its charitable status is removed, no more mon-
ey can be raised by the shelter, officials said.

At the same time, a last-minute appeal has given
the son-in-law of Ann and Jerry Fields, the owners
of the shelter, at least two more days before going
to jail to serve 10 days for contempt of court.

The son-in-law, Ronnie Denney, has been operat-
ing the shelter since the Fieldses disappeared three
weeks ago to keep from being jailed themselves for
refusing to comply with a court order to move the
Operation to a more rural site. The Fieldses are still
at large.

Denney was to report to the Rockdale County
Jail by 5 pm. Monday. but his attorney asked the
Georgia Court of Appeals to allow him to remain
.free while appealing the contempt charge. The court
granted two days for both sides to present briefs on
the question. . ,

Rockdale County Superior Court Judge Clarence
Vaughn ruled the shelter 3 public nuisance in 1984

and ordered it removed. After numerous appeals, the
Fieldses began moving the animals to a new site but
disappeared before more than a few hundred ani-
mals had been transferred.

Meanwhile, the Fieldses must file a proper finan-
cial disclosure report with the state by Aug. 29 or
face revocation of the shelter’s status as a charitable
organization.

The Fieldses have not filed the required financial
disclosure reports with the state since 1984, when
they launched a major fund-raising effort to obtain a
new location to house their animals.

Bill Cloud, spokesman for the state Office of
Consumer Affairs, said, “Based on the fact that Life
for God’s Stray Animals is two years delinquent in
their financial disclosure filings with the secretary
of state’s office, the recent flight of the principals of
the organization, and the recent report of a new
fund-raising effort on behalf of the organization, we
are looking at the possibility of unfair and deceptive
practices under the Fair Business Practices Act.”

The Fieldses lack a required audit of their fi-
nances by a certified public accountant, and they
have filed only one financial disclosure report, in
1984.

If the Fieldses do not comply with state require-
ments, they will “no longer be licensed by this office
to collect funds,” said Walter Daniel, director of cor-
porate investigations for the secretary of state’s of-
fice.

DENVER. POST - March 24 , 1.988

from the presidential race, United

States senators may decide this sum-
mer the fate of wolves and their possible
re~entry into Yellowstone National ’ark.
At.’ least Sen. Alan K. Simpson of Wyo-
ming, who has had the matter on hold for
three years, is now ready to do battle.
‘_ Several years ago, the National Park
Service and various conservation inter—
ests proposed to bring back 60 to 90 mem—
bers of the gray wolf clan to the park,
there to re-establish themselves as self-
supporling citizens of the West.

'l‘hese pro-wolf conservationists hold
that Canis lupis is an officially decreed en.-
dangered Species; that a small pack can
sustain itself within the park from natural
' fodder and feeding off lame and ball
game; and that as the grizzly bear and
other endangered colleagues, the wolf is
entitled to preservation in the great nat—

uralmuseum that is Yellowstone.
However, anti-wolf ranchers in Mon—
: tana and Wyoming do not believe that the

neighbor with nearby flocks and herds.
’l‘he wolf has always had a mixed recep—
tion in the West. As the Readers Encyclo-
pedia. of the American West affirms, the
Indians regarded wolves as “spiritual
bmlhers,” legitin'iate competitors for
f ood. and. sources of clothing and bedding.
The native Americans would often dis~
guise themselves as wolves while limiting.

, Push to retorn wolves to Yellowstone

men had to be pretty hard up to eat wolf
meat, and hides brought in by “wolfers”
were lgiotlorr'i "merchandise on the frontier.
From this historical antagonism, ac-
cording to Rep. Wayne ()wens of Utah,
the well has received a “bad press” in
this country. “. . . wolves do not attack
people, and ordinarily do not attack do—
mestic animals. . . . In fact, there is no
documented awe of a healthy wolf ever
attacking a human being in the history of
North America.” , ‘ -
()wens was speaking when the House of
Represcnlatives recently passed a man-
lhorization of the Endangered Species
Act, which legislation has been lagging in
the Senate, partly due to the Great Yel-
lowstone Wolf Affair; During the colorful
llouse debate, Rep. llon Marlenee of Mon-
tana circulated a picture of a live cow
whose. udder and hind quarters had been
pa rtiall y eaten by wolves. ;
Wolfophiles maintain these largest.
members of the dog family would prey in .
Yellowstoneonly on weaker members of.‘
other species that already are over-graz-é
ing the park. The encyclopediasts concur,s’

. stat ing that wolves are “intelligent. and so-
‘ cial . . . with great endurance and tactical
skill.” and hunt in packs of six to eight.
“Such packs have little trouble bringing
down animals as large as deer and prong
horns, especially when deep snow ham-
pers the prey. Larger mammals .... elk or
wapiti, caribou and moose --— are more
difficult to run down and overpower, and
most of the big game killed by wolves are
weak, crippled or otherwise subnormal."
’I‘he heart. of the matter seems to be
whether wolfophobes outside the park are
to be allowed to hunt. wolves that may de-
part the federal payroll. In a recent. court.
action in M innesota. where 1,200 Eastern
timber wolves reside, slate and federal
game officials were restrained from sane-v
tioning a. trapping season to thin out
wolves preying on (‘lon'iestie stock.
in “Sierra (.‘lub et al v. William Clark et.
at," the 8th US. Circuit. (ﬂourt of Appeals
held that under the lilru‘langered Species
.Act the interior secretary could not all--
lhorize public hunting or trapping of en-
dangered species “except. in the. extraor-
dinary case where (game) population

pressures within a given ecosystem can-
not be otherwise relieved.” '

Whether this Minnesota ruling wouldtb'e
interpreted to prevent Montana andWyo-
ming ranchers from protecting theirani-
mats against Yellowstone escapees is un-
clear, hul. Senator Simpson plans" an
amendment during Senate debate to oVer-
turn the ruling against. protective hunting.

Conservationists seem willing toilet
states authorize such hunting once the
Yellowstone wolf family is established.
They believe the wolves will find enough
natural prey within the park tomake a
mass exodus to civilization unlikely.

But the ranchers outside Yellowstone,
who also are an intelligent and social pack
having great endurance and tactical skill,
still see the gray wolf as “cowardly, de-
ceitful and merciless,” just like grandpap—
py said. Their man Simpson isn’t going to
let. the wolves come back to Yellowstone
until this matter of hunting predators, en-
dangered or not, is cleared up.

projects from the act if controversies could not be

resolved. So far, Tellico Dam is the only project

, that has received such an exemption

That does not mean all 18 well with the program.

I Congressional supporters are fighting for the very

survival of the program right now. Legislation to
“‘Vreauthorize the program has passed the House 399
til 16, but the bill has been held up in the Senate
athe past three years, in part over a controversial
, program to reintroduce timber wolves to Yellow-
in stone National Park
It" it~='l‘he Endangered Species Program has had some
Iiiajor successes. The law is believed to be largely
responsible for saving the bald eagle, the grizzly
bear, the peregrine falcon and the American
: alligator from extinction. At present 485 plants and
animals are protected by the law, but that does not
I guarantee their survival. The last California
1.. condor and the remaining black- footed fer rets now
are in captivity. The one surviving dusky seaside
' sparrow died in 1987. About 80 species became
' extinct while they were awaiting formal designa-
,~ tiou under the law.

Conflicts between development and species go

on. But increasingly, private developers and
wildlife agencies have been able .to' negotiate
compromises that permit the projects to proceed '
while providing alternate habitat for the plants, ‘
animals or birds. The Reagan Administration
constantly has sought to cut back federal funds for
the program, and opposes the law’s renewal, but
Congress has managed to maintain financing at
roughly the same level as in 1981—-although the
work load has increased significantly—and to
reauthorize the program on a year-to-year basis.
The major hurdle to reauthorization of the
program is Sen. Alan K. Simpson (R- Wyo.,) who
has vigorously opposed, on behalf of WyOming
stock growers, the reintroduction of the wolf to

, Yellowstone. Federal officials should be able to

assure ranchers that roaming wolves that prey on
domestic livestock will be quickly identified and
shot, or trapped and transplanted. This single issue
is no excuse for delaying renewal of the entire
program.

Scientists still have not completed an inventory
of all the plant, animal, bird, fish and insect life in
the 50 states. Some species are becoming extinct
before they are even catalogued. The Endangered
Species Act is vital to the nation’s understanding of
its own biological diversity and the maintenance of
ecological systems such as Yellowstone with a
balanced population of. game and predator. The,

‘ renewal bill should he passed and approved by the I

President this year so there is no interruption in;
this vital work.

'Most Endangered Mammal

Arecently launched advertising
campaign to bolster efforts. to
save the Florida panther makes an el-
emental point, not only about the pan-
ther but about Florida itself.

. The television ads for Save the
Florida Panther Inc., an organization
devoted to raising public awareness
about the panther, show a forlorn-
looking panther in urban surround—
ings. They were designed by Ad 2, an
organization of young area advertising
professionals, which has made the
panther the focus of its annual public-
service campaign. One ad shows a
panther lying in bushes as workers
build a house nearby. The narrator

says we are robbing the panther of its
existence “as we construct the future
for ourselves.”

The panther, the nation’s most en-
dangered mammal, is a dramatic but
hardly the only victim of Florida’s
growth. ,

That growth, we all know, will con-
tinue. But it must be accompanied by
an acceptance of our responsibility to
preserve Florida’s natural heritage
for future generations.”

With state commitment, and coop-
eration by the development and agri-
cultural industries, threats to the pan-
ther can be managed so that this
impressive predator will survive.

Panda
headed
henna

Test-tube cubs
being planned

By MARK DAVIS
Tribune Staff Writer

TAMPA -—— Yong Yong the pan-
da has a date with a test tube.

The 6-year—old is leaving Busch
Gardens today for Beijing, China,
where scientists will artificially in-
seminate her.

“We hope to have two (cubs),”
said Annie Fu, a member of the
technical team that .accompanied
Yong Yong and Ling Ling, a 21/2
year old male panda, to Tampa last
fall.

“She’ll be leaving a few weeks
earlier than we anticipated,” said
Gerald Lentz, the amusement park’s
zoo manager. ‘

The pair of pandas arrived at
Busch Gardens in November, amid
a whirl of cameras, curious report-
ers and people anxious to see two
members of a vanishing breed.

Yong Yong is scheduled to
board an airliner in the early after-
noon and head for New York. From
there she’ll fly on to San Francisco
and Shanghai before landing Sun-
day in China.

Ling Ling will remain on display
at Busch Garden’s panda but until
May 17, when he is scheduled to de-
part. ’

Busch officials said last month
they hoped negotiators could con—
vince the Chinese government to let

them keep the duo longer. They still .

want the male to stay, said publicity
director Glenda Gilmore.

“We haven’t given up on that,”
she said.

. Pandas that breed in the wild
normally bear one cub, but special«
ists in China have been able to
breed twins through artificial in-
semination, Fu said. And if Yong
Yong returns to China now, her
chances of bearing offspring are
best because she is nearing her re-
productive cycle.

p

 

 

I

i

Some experts are almost ready
to give up on pandas" chances of
survival‘unless the Chinese govern-
ment makes extraordinary efforts
to save their dwindling numbers.

. Conservation groups Thursday
urged the us. Fish and Wildlife
Service to deny import permits for
short-term panda exhibitions in
American zoos. Keeping pandas on
display, ”away from their native
country and breeding specialists,
further threatens animals already
looking at extinction, they said. The
service has. not decided whether t

honor that request. ’

Yong Yong’s departure is not a
response to the groups, Fu said.’
“This was already planned."

Busch officials plan to continue
marketing their remaining visitor.

Discovery Zoo rescue fund
quickly zooms to $24,350

Parks chief heartened by effort

By Jimmie Woods

 

OF THE HOUSTON POST

Buoyed by a $10,000 challenge
by Tenneco Inc., the Rescue the
Discovery Zoo fund soared to a
first—day total of $24,350 in money
and pledges Thursday.

The fund-raising campaign, or-
ganized by The Houston Post and
joined by two other media organi-
zations and a bank, is aimed at col-
lecting $60,000 by the end of April
to keep the popular children’s pet—
ting 200 open until Oct. 1.

Joining The Post in the rescue
- effort are KTRK-TV Channel 13,
KKBQ 93 FM and MBank Houston.

The city Parks and Recreation

Department had planned to close
the Discovery Zoo at the end of this
month in a budget cutting move.

Instead, parks Director Don OI—
son said at a press conference
Thursday, the city now can hire six
new zookeepers and two laborers
and keep the petting zoo operat-
ing, giving “the administration and
the City Council time to deal with
the budget shortfall.”

Allen Mclnnes, executive vice
president of Tenneco, presented
his company’s $10,000 check and
issued a challenge for the public to
match it. He chipped in the first

$100 with a personal check.

' “We want everyone, and I mean
everyone, to help meet this chal-
lenge with your nickels and dimes
and your $5, not only for the
$60,000 but for the long-range im—
provement of the zoo,” he said.

The Tenneco challenge was akin
to spontaneous combustion.

“It’s really kind of funny,”
Mclnnes explained. “I was riding
to work this morning and I had
read about the zoo in the paper.

“I thought, I’ve got little chil—
dren. I’m a native Houstonian. I’ve
come here and I’ve brought my
children here. So what can I do?

“And when I got to the office,
everybody else had the same idea,
so we came up with the chal-
lenge?’

Contributions to the rescue fund
should be made payable to “The
Discovery Zoo” and mailed to PO
Box 2126, Houston, Texas, 77252—
2126, or delivered in person to any
of the 24 MBanks in the Houston
area. .

5
Donations are tax-deductible
and should be accompanied by the
coupon that appears with this arti-
cle so the Parks and Recreation

Department can send a confirma—

tion letter to the donor.

Olson said the contributions will
be placed in a special trust fund at
MBank and will be administered by
the Houston Parks Board.

The fund total Thursday does
not include the mail contributions
or those delivered in person to
MBanks.

The campaign was off to a zany
start at 6 am. at KKBQ when John
Lander, the 93Q morning zoomas-
ter, told his listeners “Nothing is
free today.”

By 11 am, he said, the station
had received $6,000 in pledges.

Lander auctioned dates with
himself, The Post’s Ken Hoffman
and Don Nelson, co-host of Chan—
nel 13’s Good Morning Houston,
for $2,000 in contributions.

A woman named Sandy bid
$1,000 and two others offered
$500 each for dates to the upcom-
ing Michael Jackson concert. Land-
er claimed Sandy for himself, say—
ing, “Hoffman and Nelson are only

. worth $500 apiece.”

A song request cost a $20 zoo
pledge, and a happy birthday went
for $10.

In La Porte, Randy Sexton, a
carpet company owner, had the
same idea as The Post and set up a
separate fund at the La Porte State
Bank to accept contributions to
Friends of the City of Houston Pet-
ting Zoo, PO Box 1457, 77571.

“I’m a big fan of the petting zoo
myself,” Sexton said.

“I saw the picture of that little
boy in his braces that y’all had on
the front page, and I figured if he
could give his piggy bank, I could
do something, too.”

Sexton referred to Juan Pablo
Castillo, 4, who took his savings of
$5.09 to the 200 Tuesday.

Mike Kleibrink, director of pro- \.\

Young, old
join effort
to save zoo

75—year-old donor

repays lad's $5.09

By Jimmie Woods

 

OF THE HOUSTON POST

 

“I am 75 years old, a native—
born Houstonian and have enjoyed
the 200 for many years,” Katherine
Carroll wrote when she sent a
check for $15.09 to the Rescue the
Discovery Zoo fund.

Why would anyone make such a
strange contribution?

Her instructions were to give

 

E] Naturalist/page 1 30
El Editorial/page 1 E

 

$10 to the zoo and $5.09 to the
little boy who gave his piggy bank
to the 200.

The little boy was Juan Pablo
Castillo, who contributed his sav—

ings to help save the petting zoo

the day after the city announced
plans to close it and move the ani-
mals.

Since that first offering, The
Houston Post has organized a cam—
paign to raise $60,000 to keep the
Discovery Zoo operating until Oct.
1, when the city hopes to have re
solved its budget crisis. The Post
has been joined in the effort" by
KTRK-TV Channel 13, KKBQ 93
FM and MBank.

The rescue fund rose to
$26,348.09 Friday as the first mail—
in contributions arrived.

Contributions should be made
payable to “The Discovery 200’
and mailed to PO. Box 2126,

Loo Crew gets
an early start
helping staff

By Jimmie Woods
or THE HOUSTON POST

 

There is nothing wrong with 6:30 in the
morning as long as it is the end of the day and
not the beginning.

Unfortunately this morning, it is the begin-
ning because you have to be at the 200 by 7:30
and that is at least 45 minutes from home.

On this Good Friday, you are working with
the Zoo Crew, a group of volunteers that aug-
ments the staff of keepers in the Discovery Zoo
and does everything from cleaning the animal
pens and the bird cages to greeting the public.

Discovery, the children's petting 200, is the
popular attraction the city planned to shut down
for the summer just as the peak attendance
season was beginning.

Carol Nickson is the boss today and she has
hardly settled in when the radio crackles and it
is crisis time.

A yellow-throated marten, a wily animal simi-
lar to a weasel, has escaped and is up a tree on

the golf course chasing a baby owl, and the

keepers chasing him need an extendable net.
Carol has one and radios in that she’s on her
way.

The Zoo Crew includes some adults over the
winter but during the peak summer season,
most are youngsters, said Nickson who is the
senior zookeeper. They must be at least 14 or
entering the ninth grade.

Crisis time again. Zoo Director John Werler is
at Channel 13 with a llama and an American
kestrel getting ready to appear on “Good Morn-
ing Houston,” but where is the box of strange
looking lizards?

They are in the back of Werler’s car parked at
the Discovery Zoo barn.

So Carol dashes off to save the day again. She
makes it and a short while later the public ad-
dress blares: “He ’3: on.

The volunteers Friday were Kathleen ()ria. a
junior at Lamar High School; Michael Larcart, a

sophomore at Sam Houston; and Marilyn Bus—
by, a retired geophysicist.
Both Oria and Larcart worked at Discovery

last summer, liked it and are back this year.

That often isn’t the case, Nickson said.
Oria, however, doesn’t even mind cleaning
-1, which she drew Friday along with McDon-
ald. W-l is 200 lingo for West Side, Pen 1. That
is the cow pen. -

“A first-day volunteer who draws W—l some-
times won’t make it through the day,” laughs
keeper Diane Steffen.

“It’s real bad in there now with the weather
like it is. It’s muddy, ” Marilyn explains. "You
have to clean up the shed and pick up all the
feces and rake the whole thing. It takes a long
time. ”

Busby is a special kind of volunteer. For her,
Discovery is a full-time job.
She started with the Zoo Crew one day a

week in February last year and by the end of
May was working five days.
“I like animals,” Busby said as she spread a

pan of greens and grain in the duck pond. “I .

like working outdoors.”

“Did they catch the yellow—throated mar—
ten?”

“Yeah,” says Scott. “They dan‘ed him and
when he was falling out of the tree, they caught
him in the net.”

It is a little past 1 now. Quitting time. Not
theirs. The real volunteers will still be there until
4 pm.

They know you have to go write a story. So
when you say. “Gee, gang, gotta go. Deadline,
you know," they just smile and say “Come back
to see us."

This was quite a way to spend Good Friday.
it really was. A good Friday. that is.

City's zoo funding 'just a drop in the bucket’ '

 

 




 

\ ‘- By Jimmie Woods

 

OF THE HOUSTON POST

All the buildings with animals
in them were paid for with. private
donations, Toddie Gardner said
as she stood outside the auditori»
urn in the Discovery Zoo.

“What the city puts in out here
is just a drop in the bucket," said
the outgoing president of the Zoo
Advisory Board, the umbrella
group that coordinates the orga~
nizations which contribute to the
improvement of the 200.

Over the last five years, Hous—
ton has picked up smaller and still
smaller shares of the tab until the
city budget for the 200 ~-
$2,975,000 in 1987 with
$2,174,000 of that for personnel
—- now is essentially an operating
budget

The zoo is beginning the sec.—
ond phase of a three-phase, long—
range development plan that will
cost an estimated $23.7 million.

Houston contributed $7.0 mil~
lion in capital funds for the first
phase, which cost $10.2 million
and included the just-opened Big
Cat Habitats, the Denton A. Coo-
ley Animal Hospital and the com—
missary complex.

From there, it is private money
all the way — $16.1 million.

That money will come through
three of the 200's four major sup~

port organizations.

The biggest money funnel is
the Zoological Society of 1101.15—
ton, which, since its founding in
1967, has raised nearly $10 mil—
lion for zoo improvements, said
Nancy Williams, its executive di—
rector.

Zoo Friends of Houston lnc.
sometimes combines forces with
the zoological society but gener—
ally picks a special project to fi—
nance.

“Mr. Werler tells us what he
needs, and we do it," president-
elect Nancy Wells said.

”Mr. Werler" is John 12. Werler,
director of the. zoo.

The Assistance League of
Houston has carved out the zoo’s

educational program as its territo~
ry and provides everything from
books, graphics and supplies to
the two Zoomobiles, at $10,000 a
pop.

The volunteer arm of the zoo is
the Zoo Docent (Imincil, more
than 200 strong.

The zoological society has a leg
up in that it operates the conces—
sions at the zoo and puts the prof-
its into capital improvements.
The society. whose membership
is open to anyone who pays the
annual fee, also does special pro~
jects and fund—raisers.

It was the organization which
brought. a pair of white tigers ——
lndiana Jones and Sankara ~~~ to
Houston in November 1085.

Those rare big cats sell for
$120,000 a pair.

Linda Rountree, outgoing
president of the Zoo Friends, was
excited about the upcoming Zoo
Ball, a biennial event the friends
stage that draws 1,500 to 2,000
people and raises money for spe-
cial projects.

The ball, this year dubbed the
Sea Lion Salute, is scheduled for 8
pm. April 15 at the 200.

“It's an open—air event, and we
will raise $350,000 to renovate
the sea lion pool."

The friends, now comprising
80 women, has an open member-
ship policy but. requires that
women applying must have done
volunteer work at the 200.

The contribution from the As—
sistance League may run $20,000
a year, Rowe said, and the group
raised $5,000 for the Young Dis—
covery Room in the new George
R. Brown Education Center.

Of all the support groups, the
general public is most likely to
meet the docents face to face.

The word “docent" means
teacher and teach is what the do
cents do ~- in schools, in hospi-
tals, in libraries, at conventions
and before garden clubs.

“Anywhere they want us," said
Gardner, a docent for 17 years.

“We give animal and ecology
lectures and tours," she said.

Discovery
Zoofund
exceeds

$96,000

Contributions top
goal for project

Contributions to the Rescue the
Discovery Zoo fund soared to
$96,234.49 Thursday, a week after
The Houston Post and three other
sponsors began a campaign to
keep the children’s petting 200
open through the summer.

The popular attraction at the
Houston Zoo in Hermann Park was
threatened with closure at the end
of April in a city budget-cutting
move.

The Post, KTRK-TV Channel 13,
KKBQ 93 FM and MBank Houston
organized the fund drive to raise
$60,000 that would keep the 200
operating until Oct. 1.

The fund campaign ended Tues-
day, when contributions exceeded
the goal, but donations continued
to pour in.

By Thursday, 2,690 individuals,
small businesses and large corpora-
tions had joined the list of donors.

Several donors took advantage
of matching gift plans by the Chev-
ron Corp. and the Exxon Corp.
through which their employers
agree to match their contributions.

Donations near $100,000

The campaign to rescue the Dis-
covery Zoo from closure officially
ended earlier this week when the
campaign goal of $60,000 was
reached.

That was the amount the city
Parks and Recreation Department
estimated it would take to keep the
popular children’s petting 200 open
until Oct. 1. when Director Don
Olson believes the city will have
dealt with its budget shortfall. As of
Thursday, the total contributed was
$96,234.94.

The rescue campaign was orga-
nized by The Houston Post, which
was joined in the effort by KTRK—
TV Channel 13, KKBQ 93 FM and
MBank Houston.

__S_purred zoo rescue effort

Boy' 5 unselfish giving rewarded

By Jimmie Woods
OF THE HOUSTON POST

 

The happy face of the little boy
in leg braces looked out from the
front page of the newspaper and
straight into the heart of Houston.

Juan Pablo Castillo, 4, was pic-
tured handing over all $5.09 from
his savings bank so the children’s
petting zoo in Hermann Park,
threatened with closure because of
city budget cuts, could keep its an-
imals.

The picture and story in The
Houston Post touched Katherine
Carroll, and Charles and Connie
Sykes, and the Holiday Inn and
nearly 2,700 others. In a little
more than a week, they contribut-

ation and improvement of the Dis—
covery Zoo

Carroll replenished Juan Pablo 5
savings. Charles and Connie Sykes
sent him a check for $100. The
Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza in the
Galleria will treat him and his
mother, Jhanet, to a four—day trip
to Walt Disney World and furnish
$500 In spending money.

Juan Pablo was a little miffed
when he learned Carroll had reim-
bursed his $5.09 contribution, said
Laverne Havran, in whose home
the boy and his mother live.

“He said, ‘Why did she do
that?’ ”

After all, it was his money.

Carroll said she was moved to

make her gift because “he had
done what we all ought to do.”
Ron Spies, general manager of the
Crowne Plaza, praised Juan Pab-
lo’s “act of unselfish giving."

“Your son has set a fine exam-
ple for the youth of our communi—
ty," Spies wrote in a letter to Juan
Pablo’s mother.

Charles and Connie Sykes, who
moved to Houston from Nebraska
about five years ago, suggested in
a letter accompanying their check
that “you may want to talk to your
mommy about starting a fund to
save the children’s 200."

The Post had the same idea and
quickly was joined by Channel 13,

Houston and the resources of its
renowned medical center. He has
undergone surgery twice —-—- one
operation on his back and one on
his hip.

“i don’t remember my back op—
eration,” Juan Pablo said.

“You were too young,” Laverne
Havran replied.

Juan Pablo attends early child—-
hood classes at Douglas Elemen-
tary and sometimes thinks he
would like to grow up to be a fire—
fighter and rescue his teacher, Bar-
bara Huck, from a burning build-
mg.

“He can read about 100 words,”
Laverne Havran said. “He is so
smart," .lhanet Castillo said with a
proud smile. '

Juan Pablo knows he has been
on an airplane. although he was
too young to remember that trip.
Now he is thrilled about flying “on
a big airplane" to Florida, meeting
Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck
and Goofy and riding on the mono—
rail.

“l won't fall off. will I?” he
asked.

“No, l won’t let you fall off," his
mother assured him.

When all the excitement was
over, the $100 check and the Dis-
ney World trip presented and the
photographer finished taking his
picture, there was one important
question left for him.

“A hundred dollars is a lot of
money," Juan Pablo was told.
“What do you want to do with it?”

He thought hard for a minute
and looked around the zoo and at
the other people strolling in the
bright afternoon sunlight.

f‘l want to leave it here." Juan

Pablo said. “to buy some animals.”

The Rescue the Discovery Zoo
fund campaign officially ended
when the campaign goal of
$60,000 was reached. All money
collected above that amount has
been dedicated to improvement of
the Discovery Zoo.

Between the
chimps, the
tourists and the
politics of Africa,
Jane Goodall has
her hands full.

 

BYMICHAEL MCRAE

 

t had not been a good day for Jane Good-

all. She had awakened before dawn, as

she often does, and by first light was
already hiking into the dense tropical forest
of Gombe National Park. On the slopes
above. scattered groups of chimpanzees
were just beginning to stir in their arboreal
night nests.

As she climbed up the trail, Goodall felt
a familiar sense of anticipation. She had
been making this trek for 27 years, and
during that time there was little of chimpan-
zee behavior she had not witnessed. Still, the
chimpanzee is one of the most complex of
animals. so she never knew quite what to
expect. Especially of late. With more people
roaming the forest than ever before, the
surprises had been coming with troubling
regularity.

By 9 am. Goodall had settled in at the
“camp," a station where. each chimp re-
ceives bananas on an irregular basis. Among
those present were Goblin, the dominant
male. and iirodo, a feisty adolescent. Goodall
had had trouble with both chimps. Frodo is
the bad boy of Gombe. At 1-1, he is welldevel-
oped and anxious to move up in the social
hierarchy, but the older, bigger males are
quick to keeehirn down. To vent his frustra-
tions. he often beats on females —— chimpan-
rev and human alike. Recently he had taken
many liberties with Goodall. swiping at her
or yanking her hair. and she did not espe-
riallj.‘ like him

Goblin had become a greater concern.

an adolescent he, too, had beaten on

. drill, but he seemed to have outgrown

t at habit. Now he was acting up again, a

real worry. as he had developed into a 150-

pou nil hruiser, w ith three times the strength

of a man and a set of wickedly long canine
teeth.

On this particular morning, however,
both chimps seemed agreeable enough.
Goodall sat for a while with two of her
'l‘anzanian field assistants, recording the
chimps’ activities on videotape, and when
the group‘moved off into the forest to feed,
shc followed them.

The chimps climbed the steep, heavily
forested slopes of Sleeping Buffalo, a ridge
opposite camp. Goodall seemed one with
them, able to anticipate their every move —-
or so she thought. It was no surprise when
F rodo pulled his bratty routine, and swatted
at her. But at the t0p of the ridge, Goblin
caught her completely off guard. Hooting
wildly, he rushed straight. at her and pushed
her. down the hill. She tried to stand; he
pushed her again. Terrified, she reached out

side magazine, where this article first appeared.

for a tree and clung to it. Goblin ieapt up
into the tree and wrenched her away. one
hand on her arm. the other around her neck.
Then he began stomping furiously on her
back.

Finally, the assault ended, and Goblin
charged off into the forest “displaying" —~
dragging and waving huge dead branches,
stamping the ground, still screaming at the
top of his lungs.

The attack, which occurred in October,
was one of the worst yet. “He so very delib-
erately pushed me on and on and on down
the slope,” Goodall explained later. “I think
the chimps get tense and irritated by too
many people coming too close in groups _
people they don’t know. They take out their
hostilities on me. I worry about it terribly.
What on earth would happen if Goblin v ere
to attack a tourist? If they screamed or pan-
icked, I think they might be killed."

_ Later that week, Goodall would find,
herself unable to sleep. wandering along tho7

much more complicated sincc‘thef

Whether it is appropriate to mix. tour-
ism and scientific research is - for the time
being, anyway -- a moot point. Tanzania is
desperately poor and its government knmas
that primate tourism is a IUL'ratj\."i= source of
foreign exchange. For the last three years. n
has encouraged the growth of tourism at
Gombe but has done little to control it. To
make matters worse, the number of local
fishermen camping on the beaches at
Gombe far exceeds government regulations.

Last year, with chimps dying of tourist-

borne pneumonia and Goodall appealing for

outside help, it seemed an opportune time to
, request a visit. Customarily, Goodall . re
'i'ceives few journalists at Gombe. Her time

{consented to an interview.

Goodall’s is the longest continuous field

'i’years this June —— but it is far from finished.

’ "long. Two years ago, in a longawaited analy-

l .

sis of her first 25 years, “The Chimmnzees of

“Gombe: Patterns of Behavior,” she explain-

' ed that had the study ended after only 10

years, as she originally envisioned, “we
should have had a very different picture of
the Gombe chimpanzees than we do today.”

The picture she paints now is far darker
than the one she sketched earlier, which
portrayed the chimp as a “peaceful if tem-
peramental animal living equably With its
fellows in a sinless Garden of Eden,” as one
British ethologist so eloquently phrased it.

Her observations and writings from
1960 through 1970 did much to shape this
myth, Goodall now admits. She witnessed
acts of kindness and affection that struck
her as precursors of human altruism and
love. She saw that the chimps can experi—
ence suffering and sadness, and that they
have a great capacity for enjoyment and
fun. She was especially struck by the endur-
ing bonds among family members, particu-
larly between mothers and daughters.

In 1971, however, one of her graduate
researchers observed the first clue that the
chimpanzee was also capable of brutally vio
lent behavior. That September, three males
in the socalled Kasakela community (named
after the valley in which they lived) savagely
attacked a female from a neighboring com-
munity, tore her baby apart, and ate it.

“It came as a complete shock to all of

us,” Goodall says. Though Japanese re
searchers working south of Gombe had re-
ported cannibalism a year earlier. she had
dismissed the claim. “We all said, ‘They must
have made a mistake. They weren‘t very
close; it must have been a black baboon that
Falls being eaten.’ We were all very scorn-
u

The incidents persisted — six of them
between 1971 and 1984. Passion and Pom, a
mother and her adolescent daughter, were
habitually cannibalistic, systematically at-
tacking mothers in their own group and
devouring the babies in front of them. Good-
all remains puzzled by this behavior, though
she believes that the two wanted the infants
only for the meat. Once they had seized the
babies, they were no longer aggressive to
ward the mothers. In one instance, Passion
even embraced a mother whose baby she
was eating.

The year after the cannibalism was dis
covered, the study community of chimps
divided. A new group formed in the south,
ranging through the Kahama Valley. Gangs
of “Kasakela warriors,” which had once
played and laughed in a ,“carnival atmo
sphere,” turned stealthy and secretive. They
invaded the south and hunted down and
killed both males and females — surprising
behavior given the chimps’ sexual appetite.
The southern chimps had once fed in the
study area, so they were not strangers to the
raiding parties.

“They w ere gang attacks, between four
and seven {ire-adult males attacking one vic-
tim," says Goodall. :I'he fights went on for
10 to 20 minutes. The};.' werggabsolutely hor-
rendous to watch. The chimpspoundegmth
their feet, twisted limbs, dragged fh'é‘ivu-
tims along the ground, hit them. They were
even seen drinking blood on one occasion.”

By 1977, the Kahama community was no
more.

Some scientists believe the warfare
started because Goodall cut back on the
number of bananas she had been dispens-

ing, forcing the chimps to capture new feed- I

ing grounds. But Goodall’s theories are far
more intriguing. She now believes that the
chimps' capacity for war may be innate —
the chimp as “dawn warrior.” “They have
the same precursors as our own early ances.
tors must have shown,” she says. “I’m sure
that if the Kasakela warriors had had guns,
they would have used them.” .

Because the chimpanzee is man’s closest
genetic relative, is it possible, then, that we‘
share with it a biological predisposition to
ward warfare? Goodall finds this plausible
and speculates further that the chimpanzee
stands “at the very threshold of human
achievement in destruction, cruelty and
planned intergroup conflict. If he develops
the power of language," she wonders, “
might he not push Open the door and wage
war with the best of us?"

There may be forces at work in the
chimpanzee’s natural habitat that are push-
ing it down the evolutionary path our ances-
tors followed, but Goodall says we’ll never
know. Long before the many millennia it
would take to find out, mankind will have
destroyed the great African forests and rele-
gated the chimpanzee to laboratories and
zoos. Soon, she says, there will be no more
chimpanzees in the wild.

Goodall is well aware that she must be
an activist if she h0pes to continue studying
her subjects. Most ethologists working in
threatened habitats share that view, yet she,
perhaps more than others, feels compelled
because of her prominence to operate in as
wide an arena as possible. Besides her re

search at Gombe, and her writing and iec- .

turing and fundraising, she is organizing
chimpanzee conservation projects in En-'
gland and Africa. directing a study of zoo
chimps, and lobbying for the humane, treat-
ment of . laboratory chimps. The lab-chimp
crusade, which required five trips to Wash-
ington last year alone, has been especially
timeconsuming.

The gang attacks ‘were absolutely horrendous
to watch,’ says Goodall. ‘The chimps pounded
with their feet, twisted limbs, dragged the
victims along the ground, bit them. They were
even seen drinking blood on one occasion.’

Certain conservationists accuse Goodall
of neglecting her own back yard, and sug
gest that she could have used her influence
to pressure the Tanzanian government into
action. Others recognize that a foreigner
working in postcolonial Africa is in no posi-

‘ tie: to make demands. But certainly no one

understands better than Goodall what her
Siluatluﬂ is at Gombe. and how much it has
changed since 1960. when she left home in
Engind and journeyed into the wilds.

f there is any constant in Goodall’s life, it
,2 is the difficulty of her working entiron-
ment. Gombe is rough, corrugated coun-
try: a succession of steepsided, heavily for-
ested valleys that abruptly rise 2,500 feet
from Lake Tanganyika to a grassy ridge
three miles inland. Clambering around in
the muggy equatorial heat of the dry season
or in the torrential rains that extend from
October through May is exhausting, debili-
tating work. The nearest medical clinic or
saint is in Kigoma, three hours away by

A century ago, the region was the heart
of darkest Africa, infamous as a slavetrad-
ing center and totally inhospitable to whites.
Today, with the volatile political situation in
nearby eastern Zaire and Burundi, and with
the prevalence of life-threatening diseases
such as malaria, one might argue that condi-
tions have hardly improved.

lGoodall’s long tenure in such a place
says a great deal about her courage and
stamina -— both physical and mental. At 53,
she has the constitution and energy of a
woman half her age — and her powers of
observation are perhaps more acute than
ever ._ but toughing it out at Gombe has
required more than overcoming the rigors
and isolation of the bush.

Early in her career, some scientists re-
garded Goodall as a “blond bimbo,” accord.
ing to Mary Smith a senior assistant editor at
National Geographic and a longtime friend
of Goodall’s. “It was too easy to make jokes
about ‘me Jane, you Tarzan and the apes,’
says Smith. Some of this was pure sexism, of
course, but much of the skepticism was due
to Goodall’s lean credentials.

In 1957, when she came out to Kenya on
safari, Goodall had only a secretary’s train-
ing. Louis Leakey, the eminent paleoanthro
pologist, hired her as a secretary and took
her to Olduvai Gorge to help dig for fossils.
Leakey was looking for someone to study
the great apes, because he believed their
behavnor might provide clues about the hab

its and behavior of early man.

He favored untrained women as animal
observers, as he found them patient. sensi-
tive and without the biases of formally train.
ed ethnologists. Goodall impressed him with
her deep interest in animals, and he offered
to make her his ‘chimpanzee girl." She ac-
cepted at once. Later. he chose the late Dian
Fossey to be his gorilla expert, and Birute
Galdikas to study the orangutans of Borneo.
The trio became known in some circles as
“the trimates.”

Goodall knew that life at Gombe would
be arduous. Apart from the rugged terrain,
up to two feet of rain could fall in a single
month, and the grass could grow to 14 feet
Violent storms often blew over the lake,
making travel impossible. The 20square~
mile habitat had reserve status, but the local
villagers resented this protection, feeling
that the needs of the chimps were being put
ahead of their own. Tillabie land and fire
wood were scarce, and the reserve contain-
ed both.

About 150 chimps lived at Gombe, the
same number as today. Local superstitions
held that they possessed transmigrated hu-
man souls and that any gun fired at them
would burst. Villagers up and down the lake
considered the chimps friendly, though far
from harmless. In early 1957 a chimp had
seized a human baby from her mother’s
back and devoured the child‘s face, hands,
and one foot. Goodall knew of the incident,
but was undeterred.

After receiving some training in pri-
mate behavior and anatomy back in En-
gland, Goodall set out from Nairobi in June
of 1960 in an overstuffed Land-Rover. Her
mother, Vanne, was along, as the local au-
thorities had refused to allow a young En-
glishwoman to live in the bush without a
European companion. They arrived in Kigo-
ma three days later, just as boatloads of
refugees poured in from the Belgian Congo
(now Zaire), 25 miles across the lake and in
the throes of revolution.

Weeks later, when the authorities were
satisfied that the crisis would not spread to
Tanganyika twhat is now Tanzania), they
sent Goodall, her mother, and a cook they
had hired in Kigoma, on their way. Theirs
was a lean expedition: a shopworn alumi-
num dinghy and outboard motor, a second
hand army tent and cots, and a minimum of
supplies. Goodall's eyes have never fully re
covered from the cheap, used binoculars
Leakey had given her.

For the first 17 months, Goodall rarely
left the field. After five months her mother
returned to England, leaving her alone with
her small staff until her sister Judy arrived
to photograph the chimps, in August 1961.

Goodall’s routine was to rise at dawn,
track the chimps for 12 hours, and work late
into the night, transcribing her notes by the
glow of a hurricane lamp. On some balmy
nights she slept out on the high grassy van-
tage she named the Peak, to save the effort
of climbing it again in the morning. During

the rainy season, sne wrote in “in the Shad-
ow of Man," she so dreaded wading through
the-cold, wet grass in the pre—dawn darkness
that she began to make her ascents nude,
with her clothes bundled in plastic. The
shock of the cold grass against her skin was a
sensual pleasure.

During that first year, the rains seemed
endless. Soggy sheets. mildew and foot rot
made life dismal, but the time was also one
of high excitement. Once, after a terrific

deluge, Goodall blundered across a lone
chimp hunched against the cold and wet
Hearing :1 soft “hon,” she turned her head.
When she looked, the chimp had vanished.
"Then came a sound above me,” she would
write in her field notes. "A large adult male
stared down at me, lips tensed, with rapid,
jerky movements he shook a branch. I knew
he was threatening me and quickly looked
away, for prolonged staring would make
him more agitated."

Suddenly the forest exploded. The male
above let out a savage “uvaaaan” and shook
the tree Violently, showering Goodall with
raindrops and twigs. All around her, bushes
swayed and shook, and there was the sound
of screeching chimps, thudding feet. and
crashing vegetation. “My instincts urged me
to get up and leave,” she wrote, “but my
scientific interest, my pride and an intuitive
feeling that the whole intimidating perfor-
mance was merely bluff kept me where l
was. To prove myself utterly harmless l
feigned disinterest and pretended to chew
leaves and stems.”

A branch struck her in the head, and a
chimp burst out of the bushes, charging
straight for her but veering off at the last
second. Then all was quiet. The chimps had

disappeared into the forest. and Goodall was ,

alone, aware of the sudden silence “save for
the pattering of rain on the leaves —-— and the
thudding of my heart."

The encounter was an initiation of sorts.
Gradually, the chimps‘ aggressiveness gave
way to tolerance, and Goodall was able to
approach closer. She gave them names such
as David Greybeard and Goliath, after the
biblical characters; or old Mr. McGregor
who reminded her of the gardener in “The
Tale of Peter Rabbit.” Flo, the female she
would first meet in 1962, later became so
famous through Goodall’s writings that the
Sunday Times of London printed her obitu-
ary. '

This habit of naming study animals is
common now, but at the time it was bad
science, as was the concept of individuality.
Names suggested anthropomorphism; tradi—
tional ethologists preferred labeling their
subjects with numbers. Then, as now, how-
ever, Goodall’s interest was in the differ-
ences between chimps, and how personality
and behaviors are shaped by upbringing and
childhood experiences. Years later, after
compiling millions of bits of observed data
into life histories, she would be able to trace
quirks in adult chimps back to their mothers
or siblings.

Flo, for example, was a model mother —
affectionate. tolerant and playful - and so

is her daughter Fifi. By contrast. Passion
neglected her daughter Pom, which may
explain mother and daughter’s aberrant
cannibalistic teamwork.

% g

Goodall has an aura of cool self-assur-

ance that Mary Smith of National Geo-
graphic calls her “sublime serenity." The
aura stood up even in the early 19605, while
she was being savaged at press conferences

by boorish journalists or dismissive scien-
tists.
In her first year, Goodall had collected
more than 800 ages of field notes, observing:
behaviors never before witnessed in wild
chimmnzees. They hunted bush pigs and
colobus monkeys and ate the meat. They
“fished” for termites, probing into the in-
sects’ towering dirt nests with grass stems or
twigs that they had stripped down. This
ability to not only use tools, but make them,
was a revelation. Until then man was
thought to have the exclusive franchise on
toolmaking. “We must either redefine tool.
redefine man, or accept the chimrianzee as
men," pronounced a delighted Leakey in

1962

Goodall now believes
that the chimps’
capaci ty for war may
be innate. ‘They have
the same precursors
as our own early
ancestors must have
shown,’ she says. ‘I’m
sure that if the
Kasakela chimps had
had guns, they would
have used them.’

 

The Leakeys‘ careers were taking off.
To document their fossil discoveries, the
Geographic chose a young Dutch wildlife
photographer, Baron Hugo van Lawick. Lea-
key was already acting as Goodall’s adviser
and confidant; he decided to be her match-
maker as weli. In 1964, she became Baroness
Jane van LawickGoodall. Three years later
the couple had a son, Hugo Eric Louis. They
nicknamed him Grub (short for Grublin, a
play on Goblin, the chimp).

Van Lawick remembers how “primi-
tive" conditions were at Goodall’s little
camp when he first arrived. “She had one
tent and hardly any equipment -- one knife,
one fork, a tin plate, a tin mug. But Jane
doesn’t care about food.” Only work mat.
tered, and the two drove themselves. “I look
back and wonder how we did it," says van
Lawick. “We finally made a rule. One night
a week we would knock off at seven and
relax."

 




While Goodall was in London in the
winter of 1965, trying to condense 8,000 pag-
es of notes into a doctoral thesis, her health
finally broke down. She confessed to having

‘ suffered severe abdominal pains on and off
for two years. The prescription: complete
rest.

With each passing year, however, Good
all seemed to take on more. She established
a research center at Gombe, which required
the supervision of postgraduate and doctor-
al students. To support the growing center,
she took on speaking engagements and col—

‘ laborated with van Lawde on televiSlon
' films. She became a visiting lecturer at Stan-
ford.

The ’705 were in many ways more diffi-
cult than the '60s Leakey, an uncannlly pre
scient man, had always opposed feeding the
chimps bananas because he felt it was dan-
gerous and affected their natural behavior.
“I feel it is creating a most dangerous and
impossible situation which might lead to
these chimps being shot . . . after they have
seriously injured, or even killed, some Euro-
pean or African,” he had written to Goodall
in 1964. “It is not right and I cannot be a
party to it." As his health failed, his railing
intensified, and he refused to hear argu-
ments that provisioning merely improved
her chances of observing social interactions.
“It was sad," Goodall recalls. Only just be
fore his death in 1972 did he accept some of
her findings.

The following year, the neverending
work -’ which had been pulling Goods and
van Lawick in separate directions — to
further toll when they divorced. A year lat-

er, she married Derek Brywwn, a Worl
War ll fighter pilot who was head of nation-
al parks in Tanzania. In one of the great
tragedies of her life, he died of cancer in
19%.

For the last 12 years. the government
has not allowed Goodall to live full-time at
Gombe. in 1975, 40 armed rebels crossed the
lake from Zaire. abducted four students.
and held them for 3503.000 ransom. The
money was. paid and the students freed. but
since then Gombe has been considered a
politically sensitive areaGoodall stays there
in three-week stints. for a total of about four
months. in her absence she relies heavily on
the work of her Tanzanian field assistants.
The rest of the year she divides between
traveling and her home in Dar es Salaam, on
the coast of Tanzania, where she does most
of her writing.

But it is at Gombe. in her simple stone
house on the beach, that Goodall says she
feels most at home. Some afternoons she
likes to sit by the lake, sorting out her
thoughts and letting the wavelets lap at her
feet. Ten years ago, she might have had the
beach to herself; nowadays, an endless pro
cession of fishermen and the odd tourist
walk by. ‘

About a dozen people visit the park
each week. but their nilmbers are on the

rise. in the absence of a reservations system,
Gombe can be bombarded by day-ydsﬁbrs
from Kigoma. and the little 10bed hasten?
the park headquarters can be overflowing.

Tourists and habituated chimpanzees
are a bad mix. ‘Toui‘ists are touching
chimps, and chimps are touching them, be-
cause the chimps are utterly blasé about
people,” Goodall says. “It’s dangerous for
people because they can get hurt. It’s d
gerous for the chimps because they can get
all our infectious diseases. 1 think this pneu-
monia epidemic probably came in from '
goma." .

Last June, nine chimps died in the e -
demic. In 1966. a dozen contracted polio
after an outbreak in Kigbma; half of them‘,
died. Last year‘s orphans have a gready'lg:
minished chance of survival. Thus, the p ,;
monia epidemic may eventually claim as?
many as 15 chimps, nearly a third of the
study group of 50. . , .

ﬂ

As bodies are discov‘éred, Goodall ma,
them in plastic and places them in the “cof-'
fin,” a metal box behind her house. In
Gombe‘s fierce heat, the bodies decompose
rapidly. On an afternoon last August, Good-
all removed the skeletons of the pneumonia
victims, and washed the bones in the lake.
Later she packed them in her big leather
suitcase. and took them to California for
analysis.

The most expedient solution to the
death toll would be to‘ban everyone but
researchers from the park, which is what
the militant Dian Fossey might suggest were
she alive. But Goodall ismore realistic; she
knows that Gombe cannot survive without
the support of the government and the local

people.

“if we’re going to conserve some of
these forest habitats in West and Central
Africa,” Goodall says, “the only possible way
is by allowing tourism, so that the govern-
ments can have some foreign exchange com-
ing in. You compromise a piece of the park,
habituate the animals there, and create
trails so people can walk to see these shy
forest creatures. If there’s a river, perhaps
they can go by canoe.”

At Gombe. her plan is to partially habit-
uate the now wild chimps in the northern
and southern valleys and redirect tourists
there. “The rationale." she explains. “is that

these chimps will never be as completely
accepting of people as the chimps here are.”
It’s,an old plan, one she’s toyed with since
theg’GOs, but the pneumonia deaths have
created a new urgency.

"isf‘About 18 months ago, Goodall appealed
to’tlie African Wildlife Foundation for help,

oodall lives a short distance down the

beach from the visitors’ hostel at.

Gombe. Her house is a long, low
place, with thick walls, a thatched roof, and
a cool, dark veranda, so well-camouflaged by
overgrowth that it can’t be seen from the
beach. Heavy wire grating covers its win-
dows. The chimps and baboons have the run
of the park, and they tend to get into things.
“aim Grub was an infant and Goodall was
wandering the forest, she used to lock him
in the house. Carnivorous male chimpanzees
would eye him intently from outside the

grating.

The night of our arrival at Gombe, my
wife and I walked down the beach to deliver
some batteries and coffee creamer Goodall
had requested. She invited us in. The room
was nearly dark, and she sat with her back
to the single kerosene lamp, making it diffi~
cult to see her features. When she shifted, I
noticed that she was more gaunt than in her
photographs. Her hair, in its customary po
nytail, was streaked with gray. But her so
.rene aura, which seemed to emanate from
her eyes, was unchanged, and as she spoke I
noticed the tranquilizing effect it has.

In the morning we met David Gilagiza, a

field assistant who would be our guide, and
hiked up the main trail into the forest. A
member of the Ha tribe, Gilagiza was born in
a nearby fishing village and had worked at
the park less than two years. The Ha are a
diminutive people — at 26, Gilagiza is barely
five feet tall and 110 pounds -— but their size
makes them well-suited for scrambling after
chimps in the rugged, thickly forested hills.

Goodall had assigned Gilagiza to ob
serve mother-infant relationships. Fifi, Flo's
daughter, was his target, animal, so we
would spend most of our time'tracking her
and her large family: Freud,‘Fr6do,ijanni
and the infant Flossi. We located the group
in a grove of leafy deciduous trees. Fifi and
Freud were idly grooming Frodo and Fanni,
while Flossi swung hyperactively through
the treetops. She drOpped fruit bombs on
her brothers and peeked down at them,
wearing a deadpan expression on her little
pink face._When she clambered down for
some love and reassurance, Fifi coddled and
tickled her, causing her to snort and chortle
with laughter.

Soon the chimps moved off toward Ka-
kombe Stream. We followed at a distance.

. Butterflies of peacock blue or crimson flit-

ted through the forest, and the twittering of
hidden birds mingled with the gurgle of the
stream. The group stopped often to feed on
palm nuts and fruits, and split up and re
formed several times, joining other chimps
who ranged through the area. To maintain
contact, they called to each other with
panthoots, low throaty cries that rose to a
frenzied crescendo of squealing. Sometimes
they drummed on the buttresslike roots of a

 




fig tree, creating a resonant pocketyqiock
sound. The clamor shattered the stillness of
the forest, and was a sudden, thrilling re-
minder that we were visitors in a wild and
mysterious place, the domain of apes and
early men.

As I walked on the narrow trail, some-
thing brushed past me from behind. I was
startled to look down and see a short, hairy
body scuttle by. When Iii-Odo passed my
wife, he slapped her hard. “You must watch

Within a few hours, we had observed
behaviors that Goodall had seen only after
many months in Gomhe. We sat just a yard
away as Gremlin fashioned probes from

and used them to fish for termites.
Later we watched Beethoven and Gremlin
mate, the process lasting but 10 seconds
When the chimps spotted a tr00p of red
colobus monkeys high above in the forest
canopy, they moved rapidly as a team, caus-
ing the monkeys to take flight through the
treet0ps like a flock of startled birds.

Most of these activities occurred low in
the Kakombe Valley, where the terrain was
flat and the going easy. Later that week,
however, we came to angeciate just how
tough Goodall is. Tracking’Mer group of

chimps to the south on a brutally'hOt day, we _.

crashed through a snarl of brambles and
vines at the bottom of a steep ravine. The
chimps grew quiet and stealthy as they ap-
proached the southern border of their range
and we soon lost them. We turned back,
exhausted. As I bushwhacked up the SIOpes,
the dense growth grabbed at my face, snag-
ged my pack, and bound my legs together. In
places I climbed on all fours, clutching at
saplings and dragging myself uphill

At the top of the ridge, I was red-faced,
pouring sweat, and bleeding in several plac-
es. Gilagiza was waiting for us, not a bead of
perspiration on him. We walked up to an
open crest, where Freud and Frodo lay on
their backs in the trail. I took a photograph
of Freud and he covered his eyes, as if he
were sick of posing fer tourists. Suddenly
Frodo leaped up and dashed past me, kick-
ing out with his hind legs like a mule. I
sidestepped him, but he hit my wife just
below the knees —- butting her off the trail
~— and ran off screaming.

That night, Goodall recounted Frodo
stories as we prepared dinner over an Open
fire in her kitchen. Once, he had licked her
all over, she said, but most of their recent
encounters had involved aggression. “I don’t
know what to do with him,” said Goodall. “I

don’t want to use gas and make him choke
and cry. Then I would be a challenger; now
I’m just someone for him to take his aggres-
sions out on."

We ate on the beach. where. it was cool-
er. The sky was filled with stars. and a short
distance offshore the fishing canoes formed
an unbroken line that stretched to the heri-
zon. The lake sitzmnzered with the reiterate

dagaa surfaced, the men cried out to each
other, sounding like rodeo cowboys. I found
this extraordinarily picturesque, but Good-
all detested the noise. Because she. suffers
from insomnia, she resorts to earpiugs to
sleep.

I noticed a red glow across the lake in
Zaire. “The last of the sun,” I said.

“It’s far too late for that.” she corrected
me. “It’s probably just a village on fire. The
rebels demand food from the villagers, and
when they’re refused, they burn the vil-
lage.”

It was a reminder that 1975 was not so
long ago. Refugees from Zaire continually
show up in Tanzania, and some of them have
settled on the beaches near Gombe. Good-
all’s men call one refugee camp “the village
of cannibals” because the Zairoise are
known to eat baboons and chimps, and even.
it is said, humans.

The conversation took on the quality of
campfire ghost stories. Two years ago, the
decapitated body of a young chimp named
Getty (after the oil baron, one of Goodall’s
benefactors) was found near the park. Good-
all believed the head might have been taken
for witchcraft. “Thank God I was not the one
to discover him,” she shuddered. She guess
ed that the head might have gone to Burun-

. di, a country she says is a conduit for smugv

gled live chimps.

A baby chimpanzee in Burundi might
sell for as little as 85. But in Europe, the same
animal might fetch as much as $15,000 from
a biomedical lab conducting AIDS or hepati-
tis 8 research. Historically, most lab chimps
have come from West Africa. From there
they are shuttled around the continent,
their papers forged so that dealers can sell
the animals as legal in Europe. Goodall sus-
pects that chimps are also being taken from
Mahale National Park south of Kigoma.

In the United States, Goodall said, she
had toured one laboratory under contract to
the National Institutes of Health and saw
two baby chimps in a cage only 22 inches
square. The isolation, she said, drives them
insane. “Just try to imagineff'lossi and Wolfi

«a

shut up in one of those.”"”“=i-+~».l .

Last year, she asked the NIH to sponsor
a conference on standards for the humane
treatment of research chimps, but the agen-
cy rejected her proposal. “The conference
was to be a way of finding out what the
chimps need, what the biomedical pe0ple
need, and how we can combine the two to
the best advantage of the chimps," she ex-
plained. “I’m not saying let’s stop all re
search using the chimps; I’m saying if we’re
going to use them, then we’ve got to treat
them properly."

The NIH rejection had been a blow.
“They think we’re licking our wounds,” she
said, “but we’re not. We’re going to have our
own conference, much smaller, and take the
issue directly to the public.”

Goodall excused herself. She had writ-
ing to do, data to analyze, a conference to
plan, chimps to observe. Goodall has always
run at full throttle, only now, moving in so
many different directions, she seems to
have a sense of her own limits. “All I can do
18 get people inspired, can’t I?” she asked. “I
can’t do it all by myself.” I

Diane Halverson’s Pig Crusade

By Henry Mitchell »- .
Washington Post Staff Writer

f you meet Diane Halverson at some
cocktail party at a grand Georgetown
house you discover that all of a sudden
the conversation is about pigs.

She is one of the few women of the
capital who, if she called you a pig, would
expect you to glow with the compliment, for
she is far gone in the love of farm animals, and
pigs in particular. She is determined they will
he raised humanely, even if their fate is the
frying pan.

Last summer, for example, when others
were heading for the beaches, she ventured to
Zurich to study a demonstration of family pens
for raising the beasts, far more humane than
the “factories” in which they are commonly
housed. '

A character in the novel “Crome Yellow"
peers at a group of swine happily wallowing on

“V.

a farm and says, “Just look at. them, sir. Rightly t if
is they called pigs.” And no doubt millions of "it”
Americans think pigs are filthy beasts, though
the truth is they are as intelligent as dogs, and
if they like a bit of mud, well who does not?
Besides, as a letter from an intelligent woman
recently pointed out, when pigs wallow it is
because they like a No. 20 sun screen. Given
freedom to trot about a little, the pigs on a
spring day area paradigm of paradise,
gruntling among fallen branches, roots and (in
favored places) truffles.

discovered a different world, a rich and
stimulating world, but it took some
ﬁetting used to. She ﬁrst stayed at a
ﬁdging for Christian young women on
Capitol Hill, which was not such a jolt,
but the ﬁrst time she rode a city bus
ﬁre was amazed.

-> “There were only three passengers,
sitting about as far from each other as
ﬁbssible, and I couldn’t get over it.
Why hadn’t they all sat together so
grey could talk?”

For a farm girl, as she tended the
mimals or worked getting the hay in,
most of the day was spent alone. She
couldn’t imagine that if one had a
chance to meet people, one would not
leap to them but she soon learned the
ways of towns when she crossed Wis-
consin Avenue.

A nice-looking man—she thought
maybe he was a senator as he had a
'dark suit and tie and good shoes—of-
fered to catch her dog for her.

“Oh, that’s not my dog,” she said.
This may be one way men introduce
themselves in Georgetown. There is
always a dog somewhere, and the
woman is almost certain to say some-
thing. Having said it wasn’t her dog,
.ghe was surprised the man started
chatting in a friendly way and suggest-
ed they have some coffee, but the farm
:giﬂ knew better than that and said she
Thad to get home. What a nice man. He
,was going right by there and would
:j’drop her off.

“I don’t think this is the way to Capi-
301 Hill,” she said as Hains Point came
«into view. The man said it was a short

place?

Is it possible his intentions were not
“honorable? She was abrupt and firm.

since. Even ones that seem to like

that kind she settled in happily, and has
even found some men a girl could love.

Her sister was already in Washing-
ton, a legislative aide to a senator. She
kept an eye on Diane, very helpful, of
course. Diane tried a job or two before
the Animal Welfare Institute in 1976
where she still works. She writes, lec-
tures on pigs and when she can she
works with them. She eats meat and
will let you eat a pork chop, and what
drives her mad is not the killing of ani-
mals for food, but the barbarism of
raising them from infancy to slaughter
in unnatural ways that literally drive
them insane.

One of the commonest behaviors of
sows when they are put in iron crates
(as most of them are, before they far-
row) is gnawing endlessly on a bar. It
has finally been discovered this com-
pulsive and seemingly pointless activity
releases endorphins in the brain, Hal-
verson says. It is like banging your
head on the wall but may make life
more bearable.

Not that pigs are the only farm ani-
mal confined in crates that prevent
turning around or in many cases even
seeing other animals—~a hardship for
animals with strong herd instincts.

“I went to an auction years ago in
Minnesota where cattle were being
sold for shipment to a slaughterhouse.
The thing that threw me was not that
they would be killed, but what hap—
pened while they were still alive.

“A cow was brought in with a bro»
ken leg. They used a cattle prod to get
her in, then they dragged her out by
the legs. I peered in all the pens to find
her, but never did. While looking for
her I found a young heifer in a pen,
badly hurt, in fact I thought she was
dead. As I turned away she lifted her
head looking back at me. I was moved.
and I was angry, and went out to do
something about it. I didn’t manage to
do anything at all.”

People said, when she started her
work for farm animals, that farmrrs
had to raise them brutally to t‘omgx-v‘lv
in the market. Most people don't want
to think how their pork is raised, and
besides there’s nothing they can do
about. it.

manely raised. They can ask grorers.

 




 

“Many small farmers have been able
to make profits by using low-invest-
ment hog housing systems that allow
the pigs 3 reasonable amount of free-
dom.

“But other farmers have tried to
compete with large-scale industrialized
farms by building barren quarters, giv-
ing the animals no space, in an effort to
avoid the labor of raising hogs on straw
or outdoors. But such systems are very
expensive to build. Tax incentives have
paved the way for the big factory
farms to the point it is sometimes
called ‘tax farrning.’ Often the money
for factory farms comes from other
sources than farming. It is investment
money put into the factory farms for
tax breaks. If the price of pork falls,
they can sit it out, but the small farmer
who is trying to imitate their methods
cannot. A small farmer can easily be-
come overextended, when he invests
in expensive factory-farm methods, but
has no reserves.

“Government research should be di-
rected another way—not for the bene-
ﬁt of huge factory farms, but to explore
animal housing systems the small fann-
er could adopt, make a proﬁt while also
giving a decent life to his animals.”

People like Halverson believe you
should ﬁrst find out what is important
to a pig, and take that into account
when raising it.

Given full freedom, for example, a
sow may travel three miles to collect
nesting materials, and clearly that can-
not be duplicated on a farm. But you
can provide straw and brush for her to
make a nest. Also, it turns out (in Uni-
versity of Edinburgh studies) the moth-
er pig likes her nest to be backed by a
large tree, and likes her enclosure
open to the south. These preferences
can be catered to on farms as easily as

not, a post instead of a tree, for exam—i

ple.

Given their choice, pigs remain in ‘

family units. They all sleep together in

a nest. They resent and resist the in- '

troduction of an outsider pig—it may
take 90 days before the newcomer is
accepted and allowed to sleep with the
rest. But the common system now is
for the piglets to be taken from their
mother after the shortest weaning pos-
sible and raised away from her with un—
related piglets, and without the nest.
The small farmer, Halverson insists,
can economically compete while adopt:-
ing many of the measures that pigs

like—piglets can remain in a family pen
until the day they are taken to slaugh-
ter. Pigs have clear preferences in
where they defecate. and it makes
sense to give them their head. And per—
haps there could be tax breaks for small
farmers turning to a humane system.
Halverson is by now used to men
who do not expect most women to be
terribly interested in pigs, or to prefer
working with animals to making money

“When my mother was dying, we
wanted her to go to a place for special
treatment, but we couldn’t afford it. It
would have been nice then to have
more money. And I’d like to buy my fa-
ther a really good truck. But I know I
never will be able to do things like that.

“And my father could certainly use
me on the farm. He counted on me and
now I’m not there. For several sum-
mers I went back to bring in the hay.
Of course I have thought long and hard
about the work I do and how to justify
it.

“But I learned my love of animals
and my anger at inhuman treatment of
living things from my mother, and
learned independence from my father.
You can’t have everything, you can’t
do everything.”

She remembers her grandmother’s
stories about her great-grandmother.
How hard it was to leave Norway, how
people died on the voyage, how solemn
it was when the bodies were sewn in a
sheet and committed to the deep. How
hard it was to begin again in a new
country and a hard climate.

The family were Lutheran, but
when Diane was a little girl her parents
became Jehovah’s Witnesses. The Wit-
nesses did not say the Pledge of Alle-
giance or salute the ﬂag, and until the
Supreme Court upheld them in a fa-

    

mous case, they were heavily penalized
in their communities.

Young Diane was the only Jehovah’s
Witness in her class at school, and
while kids were not beastly to her, still
she felt apart. She does not adhere to
the Witnesses now, but does not re-
gret her family’s faith, which” she
thinks taught her to live with preju-
dice—a useful thing for one who works
for animals. Everybody thinks animals
should be treated with kindness but
many think those who work in the ﬁeld
are a bit odd.

They are, of course. It’s odd to ﬁght
to change anything at all, and oddest of
all to give a hoot for dumb animals that
are going to be turned into bacon any-
way. The years go by and Halverson
does not see any sudden conversion of
the public.

But little by little she does see a
change. Americans resist cruelty more
than they did. There was a time when
a man could beat a horse on M Street
or break an old dog’s ribs and nobody
would protest.

There comes a time in most great
movements when crisis brings change
suddenly, but always the change has
been building up for years, sometimes
for centuries, until the public con-
science says “no more.”

That day for farm animals is not yet
here, but when it comes there will
probably be a few names along the way
that are remembered.

Diane Haiverson wants a result, not
a medal, and if she nudges things along
that is reward enough. Besides, she
has already escaped the hell common
to many who work at tasks that don’t
interest them and who ﬁght for money
and status that bring them no delight.
Diane Halverson, let loose with the af-
fable pig, is bonded to life’s brightness.

I

arly in our friendship, when I'd thrown
sticks to my arm’s numbing weariness and her
seemingly inexhaustible delight, I inquired about
her run-and—fetch obsession. “It’s my job," Freda
replied with characteristic understatement.
"You’ve got yours, tapping on that machine every
morning and going off to wherever it is you go
all the time. Mine is to chase sticks and be your
companion."

And so it was, from the summer of 1973,
when Freda came unexpectedly into my life.

I’d just moved into the ﬁrst home of my
own, a condominium near downtown Decatur,
and this mottled wad of fur was a housewarming
gift from close friends. Except for a passing pa-
rade of alley cats, I’d never had pets while grow-
ing up, hence, I could not fathom how such
simple creatures could twine themselves so
tightly around the human heart.

Holding her that ﬁrst time, feeling her faint
heartbeat and terrified tremblings, the mystery
was revealed, a contract sealed that would bind
us for nearly 15 years.

Orphaned in the north Georgia hills, she
was a starved, pathetic little bundle of bones.
With her heavy black-and-tan coat, pointed ears,
sharp muzzle and long bushy tail, she was pre-
dominantly Cerman shepherd. Fu-Manchu chin
whiskers also implied a schnauzer in a long ago
woodpile. Enormous feet also suggested, omi—
nously, a mewling pup that proper nourishment
would encourage into a heavyweight.

Fortunately, those paws never fulfilled their
promise. They continued to grow, but she did
not keep pace, never weighing much more than
50 pounds, and, consequently, she pranced
through adulthood as the little girl forever play-
ing house in her mother’s furry slippers.

From day one, she was the queen of Adair
Park. With her cheerful disposition and trade—
mark sheaf of sticks, she quickly became our
neighborhoods mascot and friend. She’d run and
fetch, barely panting above normal, till I'd beg
for mercy and summon her home. An all-round

athlete, she loved to swim and, as a side-
line, terrify small ducks in ponds and lakes.
She learned that swans are not big ducks
when a white-winged B-29 swooped down
on her at the monastery lake at Conyers
and sent her howling in terror to my side.

“You could have warned me,” she
grumbled. “Those things could hurt some-
body.”

She went with us on hiking trips in
the mountains, on Chattahoochee rafting
trips and took immediately to the seashore.
When a group of us joined the running
craze, she enjoyed nothing more than bar-
reling around Emory’s Lullwater Estates,
diverting to harass chipmunks and squir—
rels, and still easily beating us to the ﬁnish
line.

The only human she ever purposely
bit was a good friends now ex-husband. “I
ﬁgured if Freda disliked Charlie enough to
bite him, then I didn’t have much use for
him, either,” the lady explained after her
divorce.

An adolescent ﬂing with a Norwegian
elkhound resulted in 10 curious-looking
pups. She did all the proper things, but
motherhood clearly wasn’t her life’s work.
"What do I need a passel of little four-
legged babies for when I’ve already got
one big two-legged baby?” she teased.

er normally sunny nature over-
H casted into gloom whenever suit~

cases and cameras heralded my
departure, without her, on another travel
writing assignment. I might be gone two
days, two weeks or a month. When I re-
turned, she staged her version of a Broad-
way ticker-tape parade, showering me
with messy wet kisses and a pile of throw-
ing sticks accumulated in my absence.

“I get pretty bored while you’re
away,” she said at one homecoming. “I
guess I’ve gotten used to having you
around. They treat me like a dog —— har-
har —- but actually they’re pretty nice.
When you’re around, Grandfather [my fa-
ther] gripes and grumbles about dogs. But
all I have to do is look pitiful, and he
cooks me scrambled eggs and grits and
even comes out and tosses a stick or two.”

Over 13 years, I went on so many
trips and returned so many times to ﬁnd
her waiting there, I began to think she’d
live forever. Then, in the summer of 1986,
I came back to ﬁnd her'in the hospital,
clinging forlornly to life. She’d suffered a
crippling stroke. Her head was cruelly
wrenched to one side, and all the strength
had gone from her legs.

“Old F reda’s been a real trooper,”
said Dr. Peter Muller III, a caring young
vet at Briarcliﬁ’ Animal Clinic. “Why don’t
you take her home and make her as com-
fortable as possible. She could recover ——
I’ve seen it happen -— and if she can’t,
well, she’s had a full life.”

So we went home, and, for nearly a
month, I fed her by hand and encouraged
her back on her feet. One morning, I

came downstairs and found
her standing by the door. “I
thought it was time I got
up,” she said with a weak
smile. “Let’s go to the
park.” Her old turf was a
tonic. She wobbled and
weaved but managed to stay
up. “Throw me one, for old
times sake,” she urged. She
staggered drunkenly for-
ward, fell down, gamely got
up again and smartly re-
trieved. ”I think I’m going
to make it,” she said proud-
ly. "You still need me. and.
besides, my job’s not done.”

Gradually, she regained
her stength, and, by and by
over the next few months,
she came close to returning
to her old familiar form.
Friends suggested I forsake
writing and take up laying-
on-of-hands faith healing.

"No question about it,”
my writing colleague Rich-
ard said, “you willed her
back to life. But perhaps
you should think about a
second dog, just in case.
Freda could be your train-
er.

e entered my life as
serendipitously as
Freda had, on our

annual trip to, Lake Babun in
the north Georgia moun-
tains. Dick and Barbara
Gray, owners of the Lake Ra—
bun Hotel, had taken in a
beagle pup that apparently
had strayed from a rabbit-
hunting party. With the ho-
tel closing for the winter,
they were soliciting a perma-
nent home for this wild child
they called Babun. Offering
only token resistance, 1
brought him back to Deca-
tur. Freda accepted him gra-
ciously.

 

“Beagles are notorious 5
bat-brains,” she said, “and
this guy’s battier than most
I’ve seen. He’s had a hard
life, though. Hunting dogs
are badly abused. But if we
both work with him, I think
we can turn him around.”

She did not appear im-
mediately prophetic. Skittish
and people-shy, the little
beagle shivered like an au-
tumn leaf at the sound of car
doors, the on-off clicking of
the furnace. Even the splash-
ing sounds he made while
drinking water sent him into
paroxysms of fright. He

 




howled in the dead of night
as eerily as Lon Chaney in
“The Wolfman,” and, left
alone one afternoon, he re-
duced two pairs of aluminum
blinds to shredded shrapnel.

Ever the hound, he’d
dash for freedom at the
slightest crack of the door.
Lost for three days, he was
apprehended by DeKalb
County's eﬂicient Animal
Control and returned only
temporarily chastened. I was
on the verge of packing him
back to Lake Rabun.

“Don't give up just yet,”
Freda cautioned. “I’ve talked
with him, and I think maybe
he’s learned his lesson. He’s
going to shape up.”

Sure enough, last sum-
mer, Babun ofﬁcially joined
our ranks. Instead of quailing
at the leash, the promise of
the park sent him eagerly
dancing into its hold. Instead

 

of shying from strangers,
he’d rush toward any human
holding out the faintest
promise of a scratch behind
the ears. He’d pounce on the
living room couch, wag his
tail and beg for affection. All
the while, Freda watched us
from her place on the carpet,
not jealously, but with a wise
owl’s all~knowing eyes.

“I’m getting too old to
do this much longer," she
said one morning in the park.
“The arthritis gets worse all
the time, I can hardly see or
hear anymore, but as long as
I can, I'll keep trying to do
my job.

"Don't be too unhappy
when I’m gone. Think about
me sometimes, and try to re-
member all these good times
we’ve had. Maybe you could
even write a story about me.”

Her incredible recovery

had, in truth, lulled me back

into a false sense, if not of her
immortality, at least of her
seeing me through another
year, and maybe another
year after that. I went off to
Europe, to Alaska, the South

_,. Paciﬁc and, always, came
ﬂ)" back to ﬁnd her waiting. Last

fall, I came back from a two-
day trip to Alabama, and she
wasn't there. All the debits of
nearly 100 canine years had
been called in without no-
tice, and she'd slipped quiet-
ly, peacefully away.

I was 34 when I met
Freda. Now I’m looking
down the gun barrel of 50.
She was a constant through
the ebb and ﬂow of my mid—
life. Old friends who resur-
faced after several years
would be astonished to ﬁnd
her still at my side. Now I
have to tell them she's no
longer there. Her job is
done. I

Safari Club’s Lovefest for Big Game

SUMMARY: More than 8,000 people attended the ninth Dallas Safari
Club exposition. Amid myriad trophies and hawkers of safaris, guns
and taxidermy, big game hunters hobnobbed and told tales, all the
while earning money for the club’s conservation efforts. One thing the
disciples of Teddy Roosevelt stress: Hunting big game is not immoral.

ruth be told, big game hunters love

animals. It’s people they can‘t

stand. Especially those who think

hunting is evil and who are incapable of

seeing the humor in a tuxedo with a zebra
cummerbund and leopard bow tie.

Sure. hunters admit there is a certain
thrill in the whomp of a 400-grain bullet
slamming into a grizzly bear. But they posi-
tively resent namby-pamby Bambi lovers
who suggest that this is immoral. If any-
thing. hunters think it is the antihunters
who are cruel.

“We know there s only so much food out
there. and if you have more animals than
you have food. you lose all the animals."
says Tony Houseman, chairman of the Dal—
las Safari Club’s ninth exposition last
month. "But when there‘s a blizzard in
Montana and the elk and deer are in 4 feet
of snow. starving to death. there isn‘t one
game department that will tell you that they
can get a dime from any of these save-the-
animals organizations for feed. They can
get money from the Dallas Safari Club."

The annual convention is for the true
believers. the hard-core who wear elephant
hair bracelets and hearing aids (for their
gunshot—deadened eardrums). An antihunt—
er would have been as conspicuous as a
zebra with spots.

During the 3V2—day Dallas exhibition.

more than 8.000 people paid $5 each to
view two large convention rooms stuffed
with taxidermists. outﬁtters. professional
hunters. rifles. wildlife artists. fur coats.
safari clothing. jewelry. furniture and
enough mounted animals to fill a game
preserve. Dominating the exhibit was the
Mountain. a floor—to-ceiling display in the
ballroom with 64 life-size mounts. includ-
ing every big game animal hunted in North
America —— the lifetime collection of Safari
Club member Don Corley.

The exposition was speckled with side—
shows. There was quick—draw artist Joe
Bowman. the "master of triggemometry."
and an actor doing an impersonation of avid
big game hunter Theodore Roosevelt.

There were standing-room-only semi—
nars on the merits and demerits of hand-
loaded ammunition vs. factory issue; hard
points vs. soft points; bagging big game
with a handgun: changes in the scoring of
deer and elk racks; and the perils of safaris
in a country where cranky soldiers carry
AK-47s. Acquired immunodeficiency syn—
drome was of acute concern: Some hunters
now cam their own plasma to Africa.

The convention theme was the Year of

the Elk. and that animals massive presence
was everywhere. One head even had the
fatal .300—caliber Magnum slug and shell
casing mounted on a plaque next to it.

EXPEDITIONS BY RON THE GUIDE

Often visitors stood in awe below one of
the huge heads. quietly counting the points
and wondering whether there were more
where it came from.

Those who book the hunts eagerly as-
sured that there are. From Alaska to Zim-
babwe. virtually anyplace where game is
legally hunted ——- including the Soviet
Union —— is accessible to the hunter with
enough time and money. Judging by the
land—office business the outﬁtters were do—
ing. booking hunts appeared as easy as
shooting fish in a barrel.

These hunts are not cheap. Last year. an
Oregon hunter paid 8 109.000 in an auction
for a $200 permit to hunt a bighom in
Montana. The year before he paid 879.000.

“You must be nasty. mean. tough. and
maybe rich for this one." reads an ad for a
bongo hunt in the Central African Repub-
lic. “Do NOT take your wife. girlfriend. or
sissy brother-in-law along. . . . If you‘re
man enough to lift the money it takes to buy
this hunt, you’re man enough to take a
bongo.“ (On seeing the lone example of the
antelope on display at the expo. several
observers sniffed: "Too bad it‘s a female ."l

Besides trophy fees. which can cost
thousands of dollars and usually apply even
if the animal is wounded and escapes. there
is the cost of airfare and accommodations.
a safari license. game management fees.
export fees. the cost of preparing and ship-
ping the trophy. the hire of a professional
hunter. insurance. taxidemry. liquor. gratu—
ities and a host of other expenses. “If you
don‘t have the bucks. best back off." says
Don Holt. a Texas taxidermist whose corr—
vention booth featured a life—size mount of
a rearing zebra.

The only group hunters disdain more
than antihunters is poachers. “There's too
much money to be made illegally" to stop
poaching completely. says Peter Hathaway
Capstick. who has parlayed his 17 years as
an African big game hunter into seven
books. "In some countries the poachers are
better-amred than the army." In one case.
he says. a government official was found
with l .900 elephant tusks in his house. The
average weight: 6 pounds. "That‘s 950
baby elephants.“ he says. sighing.

Killing. the hunters insist. is a very
small. though critical. part of the hunt.
“The shot is to hunting what the putt is to ‘
golf: It is the logical conclusion of a chain
of events in which all of one‘s skills and
knowledge have been tested and chal—
lenged says Capstick. a former New York
stockbroker who lives in South Africa and
sports a monocle. His perch in the conven-
tion lobby was stacked high with special

 




editions of his books. which he signed from
morning until night as quickly as they were
thrust in front of him. Some people canied
copies of his books hundreds of miles for
him to sign. “It‘s become a sort of cult." he
says with a smile.

To hear hunters tell it. there is a primal
urge in hunting that once awakened is not
easily put to rest. Carolyn Williams says
she once told her husband that “I didn‘t
want any dead animals hanging in my
house Then he took her hunting. Now she
is one of the few hunters, and perhaps the
only woman. to have bagged one each of
the 29 species of big game legally hunted
in North America — in hunting lingo. a
" grand slam." The Safari Club honored her
at the convention with its annual Out-
standing Hunting Achievement Award.

“This last year I didn‘t have any major
hunts because 1 was really kind of tired.”
she says shortly after receiving the award.
“1 had 10 hunts in ’86. and it spilled over
into ‘87 and I was just a little tired of
hunting. It wasn‘t fun anymore. . .
it was fun. but it wasn‘t as fun.“ All told.
including airfare. licenses. fees and taxi-
dermy. it cost her about $500000 to ac-
complish the grand slam.

Professional hunters. who guide hunters
to the game. overflow with stories of close
calls and crazy clients. R. J. “Dick" Born.
a professional in Zambia. recalls one client

Carolyn Williams. hunter of the year

utfrtters" tables are covered with

glossy color photos of satisfied

hunters next to their quarry, some-

times accompanied by a blow—by-blow

slow-motion video of the kill. Elephant

hunters usually pose with a towering tusk

on each side; leopard hunters seem to favor
slinging the dead cat around their necks.

The demand for trophies — and the high
prices hunters are willing to pay — has
occasionally tempted professional guides
to bend or break the rules. A four-year sting
operation by the US. Fish and Wildlife
Service, in the guise of a phony guide
service. resulted last February in 17 arrests
for poaching and other hunting violations
across the United States.

Aside from the rare poaching by a pro.
big game hunters scoff at the notion that
they threaten the existence of the animals.
They insist rather that it is the millions they
spend hunting which help feed deer in the
winter. transplant sheep and elk to new
habitats and sponsor breeding programs for
rhino and other endangered animals.

They point to Roosevelt. who convened
a group of inﬂuential friends to ponder the
indiscriminate hunting that had nearly
wiped out the white-tailed deer east of the
Mississippi and threatened the bison with
extinction. The result was the ﬁrst formal
meeting. in 1888. of the Boone and Crock-
ett Club. an organization that promotes
game management and the conservation of
wildlife habitats. To celebrate its centen-
nial. the club was invited to Dallas to share
the spotlight at this year‘s safari convention.

The organization is known primarily as
the oldest official scorekeeper for North

hunting is expensive, what with the cost of guides, airfare and

g.

permits.

American game taken by riﬂe. But it con-
siders itself first and foremost a conserva-
tion organization. Two years ago. it pur-
chased the 6,000—acre Theodore Roosevelt
Memorial Ranch near Dupuyer. Mont. to
study the effects of livestock on the game
populations on the eastern slope of the
Rocky Mountains. The organization has
established a chair at the University of
Montana for this purpose. which it plans to
endow with $900,000.

“The problem is not preservation but
land use.” says James H. “Red“ Duke Jr..
president of Boone and Crockett. “I’ve
seen a lot of money frittered away on mean—
ingless projects. We’re reversing the field
on the research grant application process by
first determining what the proper questions
are and then ﬁnding the best researcher."

The Dallas Safari Club has donated
nearly $320,000 in the past year to about
50 organizations, including Boone and
Crockett. The underlying purpose of the
convention is to raise money. and to that
end more than 100 donated hunts. fishing
trips. paintings. sculptures. mounted tro-
phies. taxidermy packages and other items
were auctioned off during the three nights.
A one-of-a-kind Weatherby Mark V .300
Magnum with a 3-by-9 Zeiss scope. intri-
cately engraved and inlaid with more than
90 inches of gold wire. fetched $18000.

There were more esoteric forms of fund—
raising behind the scenes. Late in the last
night of the convention, at a private mixer
for the Boone and Crockett and the Dallas
Safari clubs. someone brought out the Toe.
Reportedly once belonging to an old miner
who lost it to frostbite. the Toe is as cold.
black and hard as a piece of steel —- and
perfectly preserved. Membership in the Toe
society is truly for the elite.

The rub is in the initiation. The Toe is
dropped in the donor’s drink. which must
be consumed in a single gulp with the digit
touching the lips. There is a $5 .000 ﬁne for
biting or swallowing it.

The kicker is you have to pay $100 for
a shot at drinking the gruesome grog.

Caring

  F or (Your

(6 1988, The New York Times News Service
HE DOG that frisked its way
through so many years of your life
is not eager to play anymore. And
the cat seems to spend more time
than ever sleeping.

For owners of aging pets, this is a painful
realization. But some preparation —— both
emotional and medical w can make it easier
on animal and owner.

“Often people seem surprised that their
pet has gotten older." said Susan Phillips
Cohen, a social worker and the director of
counseling at the Animal Medical Center in
New York City.

“Particularly city people. They don't have
that organic, built~in sense of life span. If
they have a bouncy cat or dog, they forget
how old it is. And there are even people who
lie about a pet’s age and never let it get over
10 years old."

_ Dogs often live into their early teens, and '
small ones tend to outlive large ones. Many
cats live into their late teens.

But when an animal begins to fail, there
are painful decisions. Modern veterinary
care can cost hundreds —- in some cases
thousands -— of dollars. Yet often the only
other choice is euthanasia.

Pet medical insurance can help with the
bills to some extent. Moreover there are
signs owners can watch for and things they
should and should not do to keep the pet as
healthy as possible. in its later years.

Dr. Michael S. Garvey, chairman of the
department of medicine at the Animal
Medical Center in New York, suggested that
elderly animals be seen by a veterinarian
more often than for a yearly checkup. He
described symptoms that might be cause for
concern in an animal of any age, but that in
the older pet may indicate serious illness:

An increase in thirst or urination.

ln dogs, frequent or continual coughing.

In cats, rapid and deep breathing, even
when at rest.

LOUIS POST-DISPATCH - April 8, 1988

 

 

Vomiting, diarrhea or a change in stool
color that are more than occasional.

When such symptoms occur, Garvey said,
“the earlier the animal is diagnosed and
treatment is started, the more likely is a
successful outcome."

Basic requirements for regular care, he
said, are for the animal to have constant
access to fresh, clear water, and to be
protected from extremes of heat, humidity
and cold.

Arthritis is common among older dogs, but
not cats. If the animal shows signs of
stiffness, there are medications that may
ease the symptoms. “Under no
circumstances should people use their own
arthritis medicine on a pet," Garvey said. He
said Tylenol and Datril are extremely toxic
to cats. “In fact," he said, “no medication
should be used without consulting a
veterinarian."

A dog that has had regular runs in the
park all its life may continue moderate
exercise into old age, Garvey said, "but

walks, rather than explosive play." He
warned against “jogging with a 13-year-old
dog.” -

Obesity should be avoided at any age,
Garvey said, but “the older the animal gets,
the less it exercises, and the easier it is for it
to gain weight on the same amount of food.”
Owners should cut back a bit on the quantity
of food, which should consist largely of
standard commercial pet food, not. table
scraps or sweets.

Garvey pointed out that certain
prescription foods recommended by a
veterinarian might be helpful for the older

animal with kidney, heart or other problems.

But he was skeptical about the products in
“gourmet pet stores," adding, “It‘s difficult
for anyone to knowif they are really
balanced and nutritious.“

Blindness can develop in older animals,
but “is tolerated very well," Garvey said.

“Many times people don't realize that the
pet is blind until they rearrange the
furniture," he said. (Tatum: is can be

Post-Dispatch 'Photo

removed and vision successfully restored.

“Also. some animals as they get older tend
to be less tolerant of being pestered." he
said, “and that can be a problem with small
children. That’s to be expected.”

But even the old animal that has had the
best care may eventually put enormous
strains on its owner and often on the vet as
well.

“There have been monumental increases
in longevity," said Dr. Jim Wilson, acting
medical director of the veterinary hospital
of the University of Pennsylvania. “We have
the knowledge and ability, and many owners
don’t have the finances to allow us to use
them. They are asking us to euthanize the
animal, and we know we can save it. This is
an emotional turmoil for the vet."

Two companies provide medical
insurance for pets. A.H.I.A., the Animal
Health Insurance Agency, 24 Delay Street,
Danbury, Conn. 068“), insures cats and dogs

up to 10 years old against sickness and injury.
Pets over 10 are insured against injury only.

V.P.I., Veterinary Pet Insurance, 400 North
Tustin Avenue, Santa Ana, Calif. 92705, will
insure animals to any age for illness and injury,
but will not accept new applications for animals
older than 11. V.P.I. premiums increase as the
animal grows older.

Even when the bills are paid and science has
done what is feasible, the painful decision may
have to be made. “A lot of people expect and
hope and pray that their animals go quickly,”
Wilson said. “But they usually don’t. Neither do
people. So it’s important to get ready.”

Alice Woodward of Concord, Calif, said:
“You’re never prepared. I let my dogs go a day
or two longer than they should have. That’s the
time you need that understanding vet.”

Wilson suggested ways ’of knowing when the
time is right:“Is the animal in pain?” he asked.
"That may be hard to evaluate. But the absolute
best tip that it’s time is when the old animal
stops eating.”

Special Foods
For Old Animals

Like people, older cats and dogs need
special diets —- low in calorie, low in fat, and
high in certain vitamins and minerals. Most
stores that sell pet foods carry such products.

“These special foods are a good idea,” said
Dr. Evan Kirk, at Kirkwood Animal Hospital,
on Manchester Road. “And sometimes an

"v u._:"

older dog or cat needs prescription foods -—
available through veterinarians — if they
have certain medical problems.”

He cited some of the common ailments of
old pets: arthritis, kidney and heart disease
and failing eyesight. “Owners usually can tell
best whether a pet is in pain,” he said. “If they
are stiff in the mornings, if they are whining,
or if they yelp when you touch them, it’s a
good sign they are in pain.”

What about euthanasia?

“That’s pretty much up to the owner -- it’s
an individual decision,” he said. “The quality
of life is what’s important. We generally let
the owner decide.”

Dr. Gary King, of Concord Animal Hospital,
in Concord Vollage, cited weight gain as a
common problem. “Because they’re prone to
gain weight as they get older, they need a diet
that’s not too high in fat, and they also need
more protein,” he said.

Getting the proper amount of protein can be
a problem, however. “Too much protein starts
putting a strain on the kidney and liver.” he
said. '

He, too, recommends prescription foods,
because they offer higher quality ingredients,
in many cases, and can be tailored to
individual needs. “They’re a little more
expensive, but they can be worth it for the pet
that needs special attention,” he said.

01d cats are very similar to old dogs, King
said. “Dogs are a little more prone to arthritis
because of their bigger size, but generally
their problems are the same.”

His advice about euthanasia was the same
as Kirk’s. “It’s a quality-of-life decision,” he
said. Owners should make that decision, acting
with their veterinarian’s advice. he said.-

'ings ponds prove

fatal to migrating flocks j

Hundreds of waterfowl die near Quartzsite

By Steve Daniels
Western Arizona Bureau

QUARTZSI'I‘E —-— Hundreds of migrating
waterfowl have died of cyanide poisoning after
landing iii tailings ponds of the Cyprus
Capperstone Gold Mine. near here; federal
ofﬁcials said 'l‘hursday.

For the past three weeks,
Henry, a Bureau of Land Management wildlife
biologist, “sizable flocks”. of migrating water-
fowl have. been attracted by water in the ponds
and dying almost immediately.

I’ederal ofﬁcials alerted to the deaths by an.
anrmymous telephone call found garbage bags
of dead birds around a tailing pond and more
than a dozen dead birds floating in reddish—
brown residue laden with sodium cyanide.

Ofﬁcials said 300 to 500 ducks. mostly tral,
a bird about half the size of the more~lamiliar
mallard. died of what Henry termed “essen-
tially: suffocation."

”(.‘jnniitle bonds with oxygen and prevents

said Susanna

the lungs from working,” she said.

Sodium cyanide is used in mining to
separate gold from ore through a process
known as leaching.

Mine Superintendent Leon Hardy said mine
workers have prevented birds from landing on
a small “reclaim“ pond by putting "up colored
ﬂags, playing recorded noises from a cassette
player over outdoor speaker phones and even
thrOwing rocks at birds attempting to land.

But workers were unable, Hardy said, to
control a much larger tailings pond elsewhere
on the mine property.

“The lil..M‘s posture has been ‘ftnd a
solution or shut down the mine,‘ ” l-Ienry said
Thursday.

Copperstone, Arizona‘s only open~pit gold
mine. began production in Deeember. ()pcra—
tors say they hope in the first year of operation
to produce 150.000 ounces of gold. worth
roughly 8.7.7 niiilion at current prices.

The mine is beneath what is known
as the Colorado River Flyway, a
migratory path followed by tens of
thousands of , waterfowl. Migrating
birds, Henry said, view the ponds as
an opportune place to 1est. '

“We have lost a few birds over the
years,” Martin said. “We require that
mines fence off tailings ponds for just.
that reason, so deer and other wildlife
can’t get into them.”

Hardy hopes the problem ends

when the Spring migration is over.

“I can’t imagine a duck flying over
this area when it‘s 130 degrees,” he
said, adding, “It‘s worrisome, trying
to figure out how to engineer this
thing for the life of the mine, not just
to provide a ten1pora1y ﬁx.”

Copperstone has a life expectancy
of six or seven years. 1

Hemy said it is difficult to tell
exactly how many birds have died
“because they simply slowly sink into
the muck.”

There is an antidote for sodium
cyanide, and mineworkers use it if
exposed.

Plans for new animal shelter
under way for DeKalb County

By Scott R. Akin

Neighbor News Editor

DeKalb’s proposed 451.5 million
animal shelter could be only a year
away if architectural designs are
approved by the ,. ,. .
DeKalb County
Board of Com-i-
missioners.

The plans call
for constructing a
22,000-square-foot
facility on Camp
Road at Kens-
ington Road, a.
site occupied by 13*
the county’s soon- M
to-be demolished
cannery.

The facility, designed by Leo A.
Daly Architects, would double the
animal control department’s ca-
pacity, housing more than 600
animals, architects said at a meet-
ing of the board's Animal Control
Policy Committee March 29.

The building would house the
department‘s administrative of-
fices. the animal detention section.

Sherry Schulman

adoption kennel,‘ veterinarian’s of-
fice and treatment section.

A full-time veterinarian will be
added to animal control’s staff,
officals said.

If the plans are approved ground
could be broken as early as August
and construction completed by May
1989.

In other business, the committee

reviewed preliminary plans for a

vigorous county-sponsored spay/
neuter program it plans to rec-
ommend to the board of com-
missioners. ‘

The program calls for an un-
disclosed increase in pet adoption
fees, which would go to pay for
spaying or neutering the animal.
The animal adopter would receive a
voucher that would be accepted by
cooperating veterinarians for the
animals later sterilization.

Thirteen of the county’s 30 animal
hospitals and some 20 veterinarians
have agreed to participate, said
Veterinarian Bob Whiteway, a vol-
unteer coordinator for the project.

The committee also approved a
disposition consent form for pet
owners relinquishing their pets to
animal control. Those wishing to
withhold the animals from the
possibility of being used in medical
research must request that by
signing the form.

“I think it’s better if a person has
to sign if they want the animals to go
to research,” Commissioner Sherry
Schulman said. '

Other committee members. Jean
Williams and Chairman Robert
Morris, argued that pet owners
could be distraught and easily
convinced to consent to any disposi-
tion of the animal.

Ms. Schulman also lobbied for a 2

sign to be erected in the shelter
lobby explaining the possibility of
impounded animals being used for
medical research.

“I think we’ve got to take the
responsibility for our own policies,”
she said.

Other committee members
agreed to recommending the place-
ment of such as signs.

Bearing Up Under Panda Pressure

“Underneath, she’ll be naught but
wood-wool and plaster. ”
———-British Museum taxidermist Roy Hale,

contemplating his assignment to stuff Chi—Chi,
a London Zoo giant panda who died in 1972

hate to bring this up, but one day our
very own Ling-ng will go the way of
all panda ﬂesh. She’s getting very old,
and her childbearing years are
numbered. Even so, this spring I’ve
detected a weakening in the collective
' 1':community psychic will as it applies to
cub production. Fifteen years of panda-cub
media hyperventilation have left you.
winded, and now, many of you no longer
care about getting a cub; some of you are
even downright negative about it. (The
other day I heard a man say: “Here it is
only March, and already I’m sick of the
damned pandasl”) Hey, I understand. I too
*hate panda-cub hype, and it’s still okay by
me to loathe “I Wuv Zoo” T-shirts (the
ones with tiny cub heads where the Os
go); the Channel 4 News team (year after
. year, the number one panda-overkill
offender); annoying, whimsical panda
newspaper headlines (“Pandas’ F’lings
Make Cub Fans Hsing”); crazed,
bulge-eyed panda birth-watch volunteers;
and, above all, icky panda biology. The last
we get via taped TV broadcasts of panda
“mounts” and news stories like the 1977
Washington Post article that informed us
that zoo officials were thinking about
helping then-sexually-hapless Hsing-Hsing
“get the idea” by marking Ling-Ling’s
“target area” with spray paint.

Yes, all these things are disgusting and
wrong. Still, I know they’re not Ling-
Ling’s fault, and I don’t let them distract
me from what really matters: wishing for

‘ a cuddly cub. So please, don’t hide behind
a “hip” facade of cub blaséness, don’t

‘ whine about the thousands spent annually
on cub conception—just root for Ling-
Ling! She has given us 110 percent every
year, and the least we can d rovide

her with an atmosphere of positive
birthing karma. If you’re still not
convinced, I challenge you to read the
following Ling-ng Career Mating
Summary (which I’ve loaded with lots of
helpful panda personiﬁcation to ease your
understanding) without collapsing into a
heap of cub-loving humanity.

1972-80. The Virgin Bride Meets Mr.
Four Left Feet. Having been swapped for
two extremely snazzy, valuable musk
oxen, hailed by thousands of adoring
Americans and set up in new $425,000
digs at the National Zoo (among other
amenities, each panda got a personal
black, slate-lined swimming pool), Ling
and Hsing must have felt like conquering
rock stars during those early years. And
for a brief time they acted that way: Both
mimicked rockers’ notorious hotel-room-
destroying antics by throwing gravel at
the walls and chucking their furniture.
Hsing-Hsing even chewed a hunk out of
his door frame. But when it came time to
get down to the serious business of
producing a love child, Ling-Ling dutifully
showed up at the panda’s common
backyard fence to perform provocative
“come hither” tumbling exercises, while
Hsing-Hsing . . .well, let’s just say he '
refused to shed his boyish ambivalence.
“He’s too young,” zoo ofﬁcials would say.

Or: “He’s just shy.” But when he ﬁnally

gave it a serious try in
1977, Hsing-Hsing
also proved he was:
dumb. Trying

to mate, he
“approached
[Ling-Ling] in

the ear ﬂap, on

the wrist, and

even on the

right foot.”
Ling-Ling

slugged him.

And who

wouldn’t? And

yet, as “reward” for this very intelligent
response, Ling-Ling started getting
regular trips to an Orwellian
artificial-insemination room.

1981: Here Comes the Cuckolder.
Reasoning that “the presence of another
male will be quite stimulating” to Hsing-
Hsing—the old sitcom jealousy routine—
zoo director Dr. Theodore Reed brought
in Chia—Chia (pronounced Cha-Cha), a
male panda from the London Zoo. After
spending several days lying around
mooching, criticizing the woodwork (“Is
this . . . particle board?”), generally
bad—mouthing the American zoo system,
not doing any chores and, of course, not
brushing his teeth, the bushel-butted
Chia-Chia lumbered over for what would
have been, no doubt, a 15-second mating
session followed by a 17 -hour belly-up
snooze. Ling-Ling belted him. In
response, 200 ofﬁcials threatened to bring
in E1 Macho—a cocky, oversexed Mexico
City panda—during the next mating
season. Instead (relatively speaking, she
must have counted herself lucky), in
1982 Ling-Ling was once again put under
the insemination knife.

OUT
THERE

 

 

Women, imagine a mediocre, long-
forgotten high school boyfriend turning up
at your door—wearing only a grin and a
codpiece—and shaking his fanny and
saying, “I’m baaaaack!" Also imagine that
he has ballooned from his youthful
74-pound frame to a gross throw—weight
of 300. This, in the form of a now—eager
Hsing—Hsing, is what turned up at Ling's
door in March 1983. Still, ever the
trooper, she allowed the slob to “make
love” to her. Naturally, this was shown on
television, and instead of a much-needed
period of convalescence, Ling-Ling got a
just-to-be-sure trip to the insemination
table. She had a cub that year but, sadly, it
died of pneumonia. Ling—Ling spent the
next winter battling kidney disease, and
despite the protests of some citi7ens (“She
doesn't like [Hsiiig—Hsingl,” proLing-Ling
activist Elizabeth lrvine told The Post.
“Her life has been hell for the past 10
years, believe me!"), the breeding
methodology continued. In the last few
years, Ling—Ling has suffered many Hsing-
Hsing maulings, hormone injections,
inseminations and, as we all know,
heartbreaking dying-cub tragedies, all
under the 24-hour watch of zoo weirdos
charting her “mount count," nesting
patterns and bleat—and—moan intervals.

All of which might send me into the
“leave her alone" camp, except . . . well,
you can just tell from the brief times she’s
had one that the Lingster really wants a
baby. Hence my position: Her motherhood
should be encouraged, but in a more
pleasant manner that caters to her
current needs. Now that Ling-Ling is old,
I think of her as sort of a Moms Mabley
character—still interested, but only in
younger men. (When I watch Ling-Ling
these days, I can almost hear her saying, a
la Moms: “1 don’t want me no ollllld
pandas. Naw. Hsing-Hsing now, he gets
tired just scratching his tooth") The zoo
could do its part by putting Hsing-Hsing in
early retirement, shelving the
insemination gear and spending a few
extra thousand to bring in a quality
selection of young panda studs from
around the globe. As for the rest of us
who are leery of volunteer zoo duty, we
can offer fan support. Nothing
embarrassing or degrading. You might do ,
as I’ve done here in my apartment: Set up A long way to grow

REVERYTHING’S DESIGNED FOR THE ANIMALS AT

  Riverbanks "

At first, you hear the thunder be—
gin to rumble in the distance. As
the storm approaches, it gets
darker. The thunder intensifies,
lightning crackles and then a
drenching rain falls. The birds in
the area seek the refuge of their
nesting spots. They huddle there
for 10 minutes or so until the
storm passes and bird life returns
to normal.

It’s all so realistic that you could
swear you were watching birds in
a tropical rainforest. And in a
sense you are. You’re in the
Rainforest exhibit at the River—
banks Zoo on the outskirts of Co-
lumbia. The storms, which occur
inside the exhibit several times a
day, are part of the innovative
technology that has made the zoo
one of the major attractions in the
state and earned it a place among
the top 10 zoos in the nation.

At Riverbanks the environment
has been designed for the 700 ani—
mals rather than the more than
half—million annual visitors. That
way, the visitors get to see the 200
mammals and 500 birds in their
natural habitats. Most live in large,
naturalistic exhibits that, instead
of bars and cages, use psychologi—
cal barriers to separate man and
animal. Those barriers include
moats, water and, in the case of
the birds, light. Since almost all
birds won’t ﬂy in the dark, River-
banks’ aviaries are well lit while
the surrounding public hallways
are only dimly illuminated.

Plants, trees, boulders, ledges
and pools, moreover, are arranged
in the exhibit areas in such a way
that the animals are able to be—
have much as they would in the
wild. Even the landscape artists
care what the animals think of the

surroundings. They don’t dress
things up; for instance, they pur-
posely keep a jungle looking like a
jungle. So while the public areas
bloom with marigolds, daisies and
other ﬂowers, the animal habitats
are given more of a natural look.
The five million Visitors who
have already toured the zoo have
plenty of reason to return in 1988.
Riverbanks is undergoing its first
major expansion since it opened
14 years ago. There’s a new farm
that gives city dwellers a taste of
rural life. It houses cattle, goats

Seeing Eye
dog mauled
in attack

PENSACOLA (AP) -— Two city
workers probably saved the life of a
blind woman’s Seeing Eye dog when
.it was mauled by two other dogs,
but Linda Watson said the traumatic
attack may make her $10,000 ani-
mal useless as a guide dog.

In any case, Ollie, an Australian
shepherd owned by Watson, 34, will
be off his feet for about two weeks
with bite wounds to the left front leg
and neck.

Gas workers Jesse Wood and
Mike Hyder kicked and used a
wrench. and broom Tuesday to beat
off the attacking dogs, identified as
part pit or English bulldog or boxer.

“They wouldn’t let go,” said
Marion Gale, a co-worker of Wat-
son’s at the Escambia County School
District where both are switchboard
operators. “They just dragged him
all over, and she (Watson) was
screaming. The neighbors wouldn’t
come out, because apparently these
dogs have been out before.”

The women were walking
- through a downtown neighborhood
during their lunch break when Ollie
was attacked.

Watson couldn’t see what was
going on, but she heard.

“I heard my dog screaming and

the other dogs growling and biting.

and everything,” she said.

She remembered thinking, “Oh,
my God, they are going to kill my
dog! They’re going to kill him!’ All I
was afraid of is that they would kill

“Ollie is her eyes,” Gale said.
"Even the owner came out and
kicked his own dogs, and they
wouldn’t let go.”

When they were finally beaten
off, the attacking dogs retreated in-
to the home of their owner, Joseph
Frances Beasley, so animal control
officers couldn’t impound them,
said Jimmy Dykes, supervisor of Es-
cambia’s animal shelter.

But Dykes said his officers cited
Beasley for failure to have the. dogs

 

 

vaccinated and licensed. Watson
has contacted the state attorney’s
office about the possibility of filing
criminal charges for failure to con-
trol his animals.

Watson said that while Ollie will
recover physically the attack may
make him become aggressive.

“If that’s the case, I’ve lost a dog

Worse than the financial loss,
she said, would be the increased
hazard from traffic. Watson said
she knows Ollie will get her across

Do you have uninvited wildlife guests vis-
iting your house or garden? If so, we’d
like to hear from you.

Many wild animals—especially deer,
coyotes, foxes, opossums, raccoons, and
skunks—thrive in decidedly urban set-
tings; seeing a doe and fawn wouldn’t be
remarkable in Portland, Berkeley, Pasa-
5 dena, or a host of other Western cities.
Even moose rank as pests in some areas,
such as Anchorage.

- Such a sighting may be thrilling, but it
_ could signal trouble as well. Becoming
.; increasingly common are conﬂicts be-
tween homeowners and wild critters: mid-
. night feasts in garbage cans or in tempt-
ing gardens, ﬁghts with household pets, or
nests in basements and crawl spaces. 1

Tell us about your wildlife problems and
how you deal with them, which wild ani-
mals cause you trouble, and what damage
they do. Then describe measures you’ve
taken to try to eradicate the animals, pro-

Two of 200 oryxes born at the Phoenix 200 since
1963 explore their surroundings.

Exotic oryx gets
foothold in wild;
was nearly gone

By Carle Hodge
Arizona Republic Science Writer

The Arabian oryx, the animal that some believe led to
the legend of the unicorn, has starred in perhaps the most
dramatic resurgence of any animal yet hunted to the brink
of extinction. .

From a herd of only nine in 1963, nearly a third of all
those known to be alive then, the Phoenix Zoo has helped
the exotic antelopes return to breeding in their natural
lands.

Six have been born at the zoo since Feb. 7, when the
200th was born. The 200th was named Sakeena, Arabic for
“tranquility.” ‘ ‘

Now, thanks in part to a program called Operation
Oryx, scores of descendants of the Arizona-bred “world
herd” occupy zoos across North America and Europe. But
more importantly, others have been released in the land of
their ancestors.

Protected in a refuge, they roam the rocky plain of
Jiddat al-Harasis, splashed with green acacia, in the desert
of Oman at the tip of the Arabian Peninsula.

There, they are bearing the first calves known to be born
in the wild since the original oryxes were brought to
Phoenix. ‘

Oryxes are thought to have inspired the legend of the
unicorn. Their long, ridged horns slanted back like slender
rapiers, Arabian oryxes, creamy-white except for partly
black legs and faces, are about the size of deer.

For centuries, they grazed the Middle East, where they
were stalked for food and magic by the humans who
shared that parched region. Ground oryx horn was
believed to be an aphrodisiac. Killing an oryx was a
Bedouin boy’s passport to manhood.

Still, large herds persisted until the post-World War II
arrival of off-road vehicles and high-powered rifles.

World wildlife organizations ﬁnally began fearing for
the species’ survival. So they sent Kenya’s chief game
warden, Maj. Ian Grimwood, to Oman for a roundup in
1962. He managed to capture only two males and a female. .

Although the plan had been to keep them in Kenya, in
eastern Africa, its climate proved too humid for them.
Grimwood set out on a global tour of zoos.

When he saw the new one in Phoenix, he was convinced
he had found the place for the oryx.

“This was their kind of environment,” Wayne Homan,
the 200’s general curator, said last week. He gestured at the
red buttes that huddle around the zoo in Papago Park.

Homan, 57, 3 Gilbert resident, came from the Miami
(Fla) Zoo two weeks before the Phoenix Zoo opened in
late 1962. And he is credited with being one of the
principal oryx saviors.

 




_A start at replenishing the dwin- .
dling oryx population was not easy.

Grimwood’s three oryxes were
followed within a year by other gifts:
one female from London, another
from Kuwait, then two females and
two males from Saudi Arabia. .

Homan found the oryx, which he
feeds mainly alfalfa, “docile, one of
the easier animals we have to work
with."

But among the first nine, a males-"T

heck of agitvaty to start a breedi..g
herd,” Hartman recalled.

Slowly, though, the immigrants
tflourished. By 1972, Phoenix was able
to ship six oryxes to the San Diego
Wildlife Park, and, later, to other
zoos.

,The goal is to continue exporting

them. In Phoenix, there now are 49 of
the animals: 18 males and 31 females.
Most live away from public view in
breeding pens.

Over the years, there had been talk
that other oryxes were held across the
'Middle East by small zoos and private
collectors. Though the rumors later
proved true, they long eluded conﬁr-
mation. .

Then, last summer at a London
conference celebrating Operation

Oryx’s silver anniversary, a census
emerged: About 800 oryxes. were
estimated to be alive.

“We didn’t expect anywhere near
that number,” Homan said.

But, he said, that number is too

 

small to ensure continuity, so Opera-
tion Oryx will go on.
, ."-"‘This is the first time that man has
' set forth to preserve a large animal
and put it back into the wild,” he said.
“We’ve shown it can be done.”

and because I like long things. I
learned that she could shed. I didn’t
know that.”

Marc and the other children got a
sense of just how long Katy is when
they compared her to a 14-foot, 6-
inch cake created in her likeness.
The cake consisted of 26 small bread
loaves sprinkled with green cocunut
—-— to represent grass, of course.

The classroom was also filled
with long balloons, long streamers
and long lines of wide—eyed young-
sters — all in honor of a longtime
friend. ‘

“Katy comes here every year,”
said school principal Jane Fletcher.
“Every student in every grade gets to

see her. She’s very well known by ;
anyone throughout Plano who’s past ,

second grade.”

Sheryl Harbaugh, a first-grade
teacher, said the discussions about
animals are usually captivating sub-
jects for people of all ages.

”But when Jim Dunlap comes to
speak, he has the kids in the palm of
his hand," said Ms. Harbaugh. “I
think it was just great. It‘s something
the kids will remember for a long
time.”

 

 

 

“If she could talk she’d
probably say, ‘Who’s the
party for? ”

-- Jim Dunlap

 

Dunlap, who raised the python on
a diet of chicken and rabbit, said he
wasn’t sure Katy was aware of the at-
tention she was receiving.

“If she could talk she’d probably
say, ‘Who’s the party for?’ ” he said.
“Snakes don’t show emotional attach—
ment like other animals do. She
treats everybody the same.”

On the other hand, the children
seemed to favor Katy over the cen

ter’s animals. The party was also at-
tended by Ralph the bullfrog, Sara
the tarantula, Garbage Can Harry
the lizard, Capuchi the monkey and a
nameless opossum with 11 babies in
her pouch.

But Katy stole the show.

“Katy is just laid back, even
though it'sounds like a pun,” said
Mme G Scharringhausen, a volum
teer who works with Dunlap. “She‘s a
celebrity among the animals because
she’s such a ham.

“When we took her out of the
trunk, she was facing the crowd of
children and everyone laughed as
she turned around and faced a row
of photographers.”

Katy turned 12 on Tuesday. And
for the first time in her life, she
donned a party hat, heard Happy
Birthday sung by a chorus of chil-
dren and had a chocolate and vanilla
cake served in her honor.

But for all the hoopla, Katy the
Burmese python could only hiss at
her 160 first-grade admirers and
slither across a table wagging a red

ribbon on the tail end of her 14-foot,

6-inch body.

The unsuspecting snake arrived
at Christie Elementary School with
an entourage of other animals from
the Plano LivingMaterials Center
for what usually is a biology lecture
presented by her owner, Plano biol-
ogy teacher Jim Dunlap.

But the talk took a sentimental
twist as children expressed grati-
tude for the reptile that has been a
“show-and-tell” topic since she
hatched at the Dallas Zoo in 1976.

“Hi, Katy. My name is Asleigh. My
last .name is Jones,” wrote one child
in her carefully designed six-page
birthday card. “I have heard a lot
about you. I like you. I even love you.
Happy Birthday.”

As a postscript, Asleigh wrote,
“Katy, Christie says no to drugs.”

And Marc Setty, 7, was stumped
when asked if Katy’s birthday party
was as much fun as his own.

“They’re about the same,” Marc
said after careful thought. “I like

when he was 25. He weighed 305 pounds when he died.

Brain tumor f ells zoo’s
beloved gorilla, Samson

By Robert Blau

In the end, it was a golf-ball—
sized brain tumor that. killed Sam—
son.

The 30—year-old gorilla, long one
of the most beloved attractions of
Brookfield Zoo, died Thursday
after apparently suffering a stroke
earlier in the week. Samson was
given a lethal injection after it was
determined he would not survive.

“It was a humanitarian thing to
do,” said Dr. Anne Baker, curator
of primates at the zoo.

Samson, who was lent to the
Brookﬁeld Zoo by the Buffalo
Zoological Gardens in Buffalo,
N.Y., in 1980, was taken off ex-
hibit six weeks ago after showing
symptoms of slowed activity and
reduced vision. ‘

“He was a close friend,” said
Jan Rafert, a zookeeper who ten-
ded to the 305—pound Samson
daily. “He picked up on our
moods and we picked up on his,
nonverbally. There’s just a look in
their eyes that you can read.

“He was 100 percent gorilla,”
Rafert added. “He could be hard
on the outside, put up a good
front. but inside he was soft as a
marshmallow.”

At 30, Samson was no spring
chicken. The oldest gorilla in cap—
tivity, for example, died at the age

of 53 and the life expectancy of a
gorilla decreases dramatically after
age 35, according to Baker.

But in the plush environs of
Tropic World, where Samson
spent his last years in captivity
surrounded by ferns and corn
plants, he lived a “normal life,”
according to Baker, and by some
standards, a luxurious one.

About six weeks ago zoo offi-
cials noticed that Samson was hav-
ing trouble seeing and that he was
moving slowly. By the end of Feb-
ruary, Samson was blind.

On Tuesday, 200 employees
were unable to rouse Samson from
the ﬂoor of his holding cage, ac-
cording to Baker. When he finally
woke, Samson drank some orange
juice and lay down again. He rose
for a short time the following af—
ternoon, drank a little more juice
and collapsed one ﬁnal time.

Zoo officials said that Samson’s
family realizes something is wrong.

The other gorillas “were looking
for him last night,” Baker said.
“They did a vocalization they do
when trying to find a group mem-
ber and ran through the cages.”

Samson is survived at Brookfield
by his mates, Alpha and Babs, and
by four children. Aquilina, Becky,
Jaban’ and an infant born Mare-l.
l l, still unnamed.

“We don’t increase breeding

CHRISTIAN SCIENCE ll'lONITOR - April 4, 1988

Fur ﬂies over wild a

Canada’s fur industry
counterattacks efforts
by animal rights groups

By David R. Francis
Staff writer of The Christian Science Monitor
Ottawa

“When you stop buying, they’ll stop
dying,” says the Ontario Humane Society
pamphlet. Below the slogan is a photo-
graph of a lynx caught in a leg-hold trap.
“Say no to fur,” says the bumper sticker
from the same group, with the “no”
caught by a trap.

Such anti-fur efforts, and far more ex-
treme measures by some animal rights
activists, have prompted the nearly $1
billion (Canadian; US$800 million) Cana—
dian fur industry to mount a major cam-
paign to save their business -— and the
livelihoods of native people in northern
Canada, Alaska, and Greenland - from
possible extinction.

The animal rights organizations won
the battle to stop the killing of “white-
coats” (baby harp seals) on the ice off
Newfoundland. When the European Com-
munity banned the import of seal skins in
1983, the only signiﬁcant market for
these pelts was wiped out. '

Last spring Ottawa allowed two large
vessels to take part in the ﬁrst offshore
seal hunt in four years. Faced then with a
threat by the EC to ban the import of
Canadian ﬁsh, the Canadian government
late last year banned all such commercial
offshore hunting.

With this success behind them, hun-
dreds of animal rights groups around the
world are stepping up or launching emo-
tion-laden campaigns against the whole
fur business. The fur industry, caught off
guard en sealskins, is determined to resist
these efforts. _

In Britain, animal rights activists per-
suaded Alan Clark, trade minister, to pro-
pose a regulation Feb. 8 requiring promi-
nent warning labels on fur garments. The
label, to be put on fur goods made from
bobcat, coyote, fox, lynx, and wolf, would
state: “includes fur from animals com-
monly caught in leg—hold traps.”

“If the British nunister succeeds with
these regulatory measures, we believe the
United Kingdom will introduce similar re—
quirements in the European Community,”
says Dave Monture, secretary-treasurer
of Indigenous Survival international, an
alliance of aboriginal people of Alaska,
Canada, and Greenland.

Five Cree Indian leaders from northern
Quebec and Rhoda immksuk president of

Inuit Tapirisat (representing Canada’s
Eskimos), were in London last week to see
Mr. Clark and others in an effort to stop
the new regulation.
Mr. Monture’s group has organized the
_ sending of some 15,000 post cards by
Indians, Inuit, and others to Clark read-
ing: “Your ill-advised proposal to tag
some fur coats with a misleading warning
will break the treaty promises made by
the British Government to protect the
rights of Canada’s native peoples. This
disgraceful act of treachery threatens the
survival of a proud aboriginal people.” ,
Earlier, Canadian External Affairs
Minister Joe Clark sent a strong letter of
protest to Britain’s Mr. Clark. The Danish
and US governments have also objected.
The Fur Institute of Canada, set up
with government and industry money to
lead the pro-fur campaign, notes that let-

,- ters to Clark and other British ofﬁcials
have been sent from the British Fur Trade
Assocration, the Aboriginal Hunters and
Rappers Federation of Canada, and
members of the United States Congress
and the Canadian House of Commons
The Rt. Rev. John R. Sperry, Anglican
Bishop of the Diocese of the Arctic, wrote
Queen Ehzabeth, Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, and others to say labeling
would “condemn a whole way of life for a
large maJonty of Canada’s northern ab-
ongmal people.” It would be “viewed by
many of us as little short of an act of
cultural genocide,” he added.

The annual rights people show no sign
, of discouragement. John Walsh, Western

Hemisphere regional director of the

World Society for the Protection of Ani-

mals (W SPA), notes that

an international campaign
against the fur business
will be launched at the so-
c1ety’s biennial board
meeting in 'lbronto May

13. The society is a con-

federation of 312 organi-'

zations involved in animal

protection in 63 countries W

and includes the Humane

Society of the United

States and the Canadian Federation of

Hurrﬁnle Societies.

-“ 's is the beginning of what will be
long, hard ﬁght,” he said. His goal is a:
end to the wearing of wild animal furs
whetherraised in a fur ranch or trapped
in the .wﬂd. The campaign slogan will be

Wearing fur is a moral issue.”

tors wrll be oﬁered camera—ready adver-

more graphic in their portrayal of cruelty
' than others, depending on local taste.
says Mr. Walsh.
The pro~fur industry campaign strat—
egy centers on three points:
0 An attempt to publicly discredit some
animal rights activists and groups.
. For instance, Monture of Indigenous
‘ Survival International calls their efforts
“organized intolerance. It is one people
trying to tell another group of people how
. to live.”
“She American fur industry set up the

Fur Retailers Information Council to pro
.. vide the news media information on the
; extreme activities of some animal rights
? groups. Thomas Riley, a spokesman, says

many activists regard the fur trade as.

only their ﬁrst objective. These groups,
. Mr. Riley asserts, eventually want to stop
, medical experimentation on animals,
holding animals in circuses or zoos, and
even the raising of animals for food, eSpe~
cially in so—called “factories.”

(The WSPA’s Walsh, who says he tries
, to be a vegetarian, does not expect people
~ to stop eating animals “in my lifetime.”

But he does hope that will happen at some

point, noting the decline in meat con-

sumption that has already occurred in the

US.)

Riley lists a host of illegal measures by
animal rights activists.
The Animal Liberation
Front is under investiga-
tion in California for alleg-
edly causing $4.5 million
in damage to animal re-
search laboratories. The

campaign threatens the livelihood of .

many Indians, Inuit, or Métis (mixed In-
dian and white) trappers and hunters.
“We have to present trappers and in-
digenous people as an endangered spe-
cies,” says Douglas Sirrs, the Department
of External Aﬁairs ofﬁcer overseeing the
effort to protect the industry. The gov-

; ernment helped sponsor a major exhibit

:that opened last December in the British
{Museum on the aboriginal way of life.
Monture charges that some animal ac-

tivists are more concerned with animals

than human beings — including Canada’s
105,000 trappers.
A recent article in the 'Ibronto Globe

and Mail from an Inuit community on 5

Broughton Island in the far north spoke
of a drastic increase in suicides among
youngsters since the European Commu-
nity ban on seal pelts reduced the ham-
let’s income. The author quoted the vil-
lage mayor as saying: “I was a lot happier
when I was a teenager because I could go
out hunting all day. Suicide was some
thing that never happened.”

Bishop Sperry, who has been preach-
ing in the Arctic for 40 years, admits that
suicide, alcoholism, drugs, and other
problems of the Inuit are not only the
result of lost seal hunting, but of a people
facing social erosion frOm the arrival of
southern culture. .

Speaking on the telephone from his
Yellowknife oﬁce, he noted that no food

can be grown in the north, theiallfood

 

has to be shot, ﬁshed, or trapped. “'lrap-
pers and hunters here can’t understand
why people in southern climes who kill

" millions of animals for their tables and for

their shoes are attacking the only eco-
nomic means they have to stay oﬁ‘ wel-
fare,” he said.

0 Fur industry ofﬁcials charge that
animal rights activists both exaggerate
the suffering of animals killed in the busi-
ness and ignore extensive measures taken

to reduce any such suﬂering. They point

to special courses for trappers on the
most humane methods and a research
program at Vegerville, Alberta, aimed at
devising more-humane traps, including
padded leg-hold traps.

Sperry, who has walked many a trap
line with members of his ﬂock, says, “I
object to the charge it is diabolical or
cruel.”

As the debate heats up, the US$2 bil-
lion fur trade in the US has seen a major
change in its market. More professional

NATIONAL ENQUIRER - April 12, 1988

Dogs Over Him

George Stewart’s 13-year mar-
riage went to the dogs -- he was
hounded out of his tiny two-bed-
room cottage by 44 stray mutts
his softhearted wife Jackie had

brought home.

When George finally howled, “It’s
them or me,” Jackie chose to keep
the dogs!

“I couldn’t care less if I never see ,
another dog as long as I live,” grum- .

bles George, 39, who’s now divorced
and living happily with a “pet-less”

girlfriend. “Dogs destroyed my mar- ‘

riage and turned my life into a liv-
ing hell.

“Don’t get me wrong: I don’t hate
dogs. In fact, I like some of them.
But have you any idea what it’s like
to share a tiny cottage with more
than 40 barking, stinking dogs all
over the place? You have to be abso-
lutely nuts about dogs — and I’m
just not.”

' Poor George’s house started to go
to the dogs in 1974 when Jackie
asked if she could have one pooch.
“Sure you can have a dog,” George
told her. Now he adds: “I’ll regret
those words until the day I die.

,“But how was I to know what
would happen?”

The barking menagerie began
with a mutt named Lucky. “And it
all just kept growing,” admits
Jackie, 35.

“I suppose my problem is I just
can’t say no. Somebody brings me a
dog, or I see a stray on the street and
my heart goes out to it.”

he strolled through a bamboo forest
on Discovery Island.

What makes Cook’s offer all the
mere impressive is that Disney will
be footing the entire bill.

"On the surface, conservation
economics doesn’t seem to work,”
Cook said. “In other words, without
imagination this would be a real
white—elephant kind of a thing ”

But Cook — a gentleman with a
deliberate stride and a slight frame
that makes him almost stork like —
has imagination. He envisions a
world in which people respect the
environment and understand how
the survival of animals is linked to

In the past, trainers went into

out the monkeys they wanted. The
rest of the monkeys would go crazy,

often scratching and biting the "

trainer before he could get out.
' As Discovery Island’s first ~10

around and lazed in their cages be-

plained his new capturing proce-

He says, too many mouths and not
enough food to fill them.

“You have to keep a natural bal-
ance in nature,” he says.

Following World War II, he says

that he and other hunters who be-
longed to the Isaac Walton League
trekked to the woods on snowshoe,
carrying potatoes to the deer that
were starving in the Pennsylvania
woods. 7 .
“If you’ve ever had to clean up
the dead carcasses oi starved ani-
mals,” he says, “you’d understand
that it’s a hell of a death.”

He also says he’s taken guns
from poachers in Pennsylvania and
in Africa. “What they need to do is
control the poachers,” he says.

Hunt almost over

For Lee Hanna, the hunt is al-
most over, he says. Last year he
and his wife went on a two-month
sight-seeing cruise to Alaska. No
hunﬁng.

But Hanna says you can’t be too
sure. He won’t discuss some of his
“more hair-raising experiences" in
the jungle, “because i might want to
go again.

“If my wife read that, it would
be the end.”-

The emergence of medical and veterinary
associations dedicated to animal welfare has been
one of the most encouraging recent developments
in the animal rights movement. Through
membership and participation in either of two
societies formed in this decade—the Physicians
Committee for Responsible Medicine or the
Association of Veterinarians for Animal Rights—
professionals in gratifying numbers are adding
their voices to the protest against certain attitudes
and actions long favored by organized medicine.
The sound is anything but a joyful noise to the
medical establishment, which does not suffer
gladly the strain of contrapuntal harmony from
within its ranks.

Many of those discordant notes are being
struck by the Physicians Committee for
Responsible Medicine (PCRM), founded in 1984 by
' Neal D. Barnard, M.D., who had “long been
concerned about the treatment of animals in
laboratories and in educational exercises in
medical school.” A member of several animal
protection groups, Barnard eventually learned that
other physicians shared his concerns. “But no one
was organizing these doctors in a constructive
fashion,” he says. “So I thought, ‘Why not? Who
can speak more authoritatively about the
directions of medical research than people actually
doing research or those who take advantage of its
results?’ ”

Barnard has been speaking—with considerable
authority—virtually non-stop since he formed the
PCRM. In the last three months of 1987, for
example, he took part in a press conference on
pound seizure in Atlanta/Georgia, participated in
a debate on the same topic on the Cable News
Network, spoke on a radio show in Washington,
DC, appeared at a press conference at the
National Institute of Mental Health regarding

 

THE GROWING

ANIMAL RIGHTS
MOVEMENT

Phil Maggitti

Nearly 460,000 cats have been sacrificed by medical researchers since 1980.
According to animal rights spokesmen, a great many investigations—such as the
barbiturate experiments at Cornell University Medical College (CA TS September
1987)—are nonproductive and nonessential. The inhumane treatment of cats at
Cornell has come to an end, thanks largely to the efforts of Trans-Species
Unlimited, a nationwide animal rights group with headquarters in.
Williamsport/Pennsylvania. But one victory does not win a war, and there is yet
much fighting to be done on the animal welfare front. The following describes
the efforts of two other groups involved in the struggle.

psychological experiments involving animals,
testified before a National Institute of Health
advisory committee, and made two other television
appearances as well. This in addition to running
a psychiatry clinic at George Washington
University in DC, where he is an assistant
professor of medicine, and providing psychiatric
care one night a week in a shelter for homeless
women.

The ﬁfteen hundred members of the PCRM,
Barnard explains, are concerned about the
“misdirection” of modern medicine. “Our primary
goal is to stop the abuse of animals in
laboratories. To a great extent that will depend
on the facilitation of preventive medicine. If we
can persuade people to take better care of
themselves, there might be less clamor for the
abusive kinds of research that occur now.”

Although Barnard contends “there is no
justification for putting animals into cages or
manipulating them in any way,” he points out
that the PCRM “hasn’t taken a formal position in
that regard. We do have a few animal
experimenters in our group,” he says, “along with
some who favor a limited, carefplly restricted use
of animals, and others who are opposed to the
use of animals at all. What distinguishes us in
the animal rights spectrum is the fact that we try
to use professional clout. What’s more, we think
strategically. We’ll adopt. conservative goals if
they’re the ones we have a realistic chance to
achieve. If there’s a small regulation that might
make research a little more humane, but that
doesn’t question the necessity of research, we'll
work for the adoption of that regulation. At the
same time we urge our members to educate
themselves and to use their knowledge to educate
others in as strong a way as possible.” ’

One goal that the PCRM is working to

Dr. Neal D. Barnard, M.D., founder of
Physicians Committee for Responsible
Medicine: “Our primary goal is to stop the
abuse of animals in laboratories.”

achieve is the passage of HR 778, sponsored by

Representative Robert J. Mrazek of New York,
which would deny government funding to any
institution that uses animals acquired from
pounds or shelters for research purposes (CA TS,
October 1986). This bill, introduced two years ago,
has been assigned to a subcommittee for eventual
hearings in the House, where it has 104 co-
sponsors, but not as yet in the Senate, where it
has none.

Dr. Barnard has made a number of
appearances in support of the Mrazek bill and of
local anti-pound seizure legislation. On a segment
of Live in LA. last year, be debated the merits of
pound seizure with Donald Reis, M.D., professor of
neurology at Cornell University Medical College.
While Dr. Reis frequently exhibited the sullen
discomfort of the medical establishment at being
obliged to take its case to the people—one call-in
participant in the discussion referred to him as
“arrogant and uninformed”—Neal Barnard came
across as the White Hat: an earnest, clean-cut,
well-spoken advocate, the prototype of the favorite
nephew who did the family proud in medical
school.

“Dr. Barnard is articulate, patient, and
helpful,” says Ginger Schulman, former
coordinator of the DeKalb Coalition to Protect Our
Pets in Atlanta/Georgia. “He has a great deal of
concern for animals, and he brings scientific
credibility to any discussion.”

When the DeKalb Coalition sought to have
pound seizure banned in that county last year,
their efforts were opposed by researchers at
Emory University in Atlanta. The coalition invited
Dr. Barnard to testify at hearings before the
county commissioners and to appear at a press
conference. The Atlanta Constitution, reporting on
Barnard’s visit, observed that the coalition had
“brought their heavy artillery with them.” Not
long afterward pound seizure was suspended by
court order in DeKalb County following the
discovery of improprieties in pound release
practices. .

The debate over pound seizure is one of many
battles being fought on behalf of animals. The
use of animals in research and in medical and
veterinary schools, the horriﬁc practices
commonplace in the raising and slaughtering of
animals for consumption, the killing of animals
for their pelts, and even the breeding and
exhibition of animals are some of the other
battles being waged in the animal welfare

CATS MAGAZINE

_ a
campaign. Underlying each confrontation is the
belief, expressed by Dr. Barnard, that “human
beings were not put here to be the crown of
creation—to exploit all other animals at our

.. whim.” This is a belief shared by Neil Wollf,

D.V.M., co-founder of the Association of
Veterinarians for Animal Rights (AVAR).

“I always thought it was paradoxical,” says
Dr. Wolff, “that an organization like the
American Veterinary Medical Association never
got involved with key animal issues. There are
never any articles in veterinary journals calling
attention to the slaughtering of seals or the poor
conditions in research laboratories across the
United States. It’s like these people have blinders
on.”

To be sure, abuses abound in the laboratory.
For more than a decade cats were subjected to
inhumane treatment in barbiturate experiments at
Cornell University Medical College (CA TS,
September 1987). In addition, Harvard, Columbia,
and the University of Pennsylvania have been
cited for gross violations of the Animal Welfare
Act. According to the United States Department
of Agriculture, facilities at the Mayo Foundation
in Rochester/Minnesota (which experimented on
369 cats in 1983 alone), were routinely deficient in
“cage size, sanitation, cage maintenance,
ventilation, and number of animals per cage.”

The indifference of the veterinary community
to these and other abuses led Wolff and his
colleague Ned Buyukmihci, V.M.D., to form the
AVAR in 1981. Unlike the Physicians Committee for
Responsible Medicine, the AVAR is philosophically
opposed to the use of animals in research. “We
try to lend our professional opinion in testimony
against research that’s redundant or non-
essential,” says Dr. Wolff. “We also try to make
sure that the animals used in any research

project are well taken care of.”

The care of research animals, nominally the
province of the United States Department of
Agriculture under the auspices of the Animal
Welfare Act, is spotty at best. Though the act
requires that minimal standards be observed in
the handling, care, and feeding of laboratory
animals, such animals are “protected” by the act
before and after experiments only. In between
they’re fair game for any games the researcher
might design. The act was constructed in this
manner, according to the conference committee
report, “to provide protection for the researcher.”
Furthermore, in 1977 the Secretary of Agriculture
decided that rats, mice, birds, horses, and other
farm animals were not animals as far as the
Animal Welfare Act was concerned. Thus,
observed the Ofﬁce of Technology Assessment of
the United States Congress (OTA), “Current
regulations probably do not affect a substantial
percentage of animals used for experimental
purposes.” And to protect the researcher from the
few animals left under the Welfare Act’s
protection, violations of this act are not subject to
criminal prosecution.

“The PCRM is very concerned,” says Neal
Barnard, “that animal research is largely
unregulated. Anyone calling himself a scientist is
free to do just about anything to animals. That’s
got to change.”

But as the number of medical professionals
speaking out for change has grown, the response
of organized medicine and its foot soldiers has
been growing, too. And the medical establishment
is not without some heavy artillery of its own. In
an Op-Ed piece that appeared in the Washington
Post last year, Dr. Michael E. DeBakey, former
White House physician and current chancellor at
the Baylor College of Medicine, asked with
thundering self-assurance, “Shall we tell hundreds
of thousands of victims of heart attacks, cancer,
AIDS, and numerous other dreaded diseases that
the right of abandoned animals to die in a pound
supercedes the patients’ right to relief from

suffering and premature death?”

Asked how he might respond to that
statement, Dr. Barnard replied, “First of all, if we
lie to an AIDS patient by telling him that animal
experiments are going to prolong his life or save
him, we’re being unethical. If we lie to cardiac
patients by telling them that their best hope is
animal experimentation, we’re being unethical
again. We must tell AIDS patients the truth: that
animal models are limited and that no one knows
whether any of these is going to lead to a .
vaccine or a treatment. We must tell patients with i,
heart disease that dietary changes, control of '
smoking, and lowering of blood pressure are far
better in preventing, controlling, and reversing
heart disease than transplants or coronary artery
bypass or other surgical heroics are.”

The backlash against animal rights is not
always so high-minded as Dr. DeBakey’s
approach. When Neil Wolff sent a letter to the
state veterinarian of Alaska expressing the
AVAR’s concerns about the number of dogs that
die each year in the now famous sled dog race,
the veterinarian replied by asking what gave Dr.
Wolff the right to make these inquiries. At the
end of his letter, the man entrusted with
overseeing the care of Alaska’s animal population
wrote, “RS. Been doing any hunting lately?” To
which Dr. Wolff replied by mail, “P.S. Been doing
any healing lately?”

Though Dr. Barnard finds the backlash of
organized medicine “disturbing,” he feels that the
animal rights movement will eventually prevail.
“We’re already seeing a lot of doctors who don’t
buy the argument that we should maintain the

status quo. One reason is that animal research
isn’t working for them. Another is that they can

no longer ignore the ethical problems. That’s why
our membership is growing. I’m sure there will '
continue to be an old guard which maintains that
dogs and cats merit no consideration at all, but I
suspect that ten years from now these people will
be regarded as the tobacco institute is regarded
today—having no credibility and just trying to
cater to their own vested interests.”

There are practical as well as ethical reasons for reducing (some would say eliminating) the use of animals
in medical research. Computer models are now available which predict the effect of new drugs on the nervous
system. Why, therefore, should animals be subjected to conﬁnement, discomfort, and death if the information
they provide could be supplied as easily—and less expensively—by microchips?

“There are also a number of computer models that can be used to teach the same techniques and procedures
that animals are used in teaching,” says Neal D. Barnard, M.D., chairman of the Physicians Committee for
Responsible Medicine. An interactive computer video program, Barnard says, “can be used in place of live

animals to teach emergency decision making.

“And there are companies that make lifelike models of babies and adults for surgical practice. At a number
of institutions people still practice putting tubes down cats’ throats—which is an absolutely pointless and
abusive practice. This goes on particularly in nursing schools. The human models are far more appropriate.”

Cellular research is another alternative to the use of live animals in the lab. To cite just one example, two
scientists at the National Institute of Health have developed an efﬁcient cellular model for screening
chemotherapy drugs. “This has probably saved a million animals a year,” says Dr. Barnard.

The Honorable Robert Dole
Minori ty leader

United States Senate
Washington, D.C. 20510

Dear Leaders:

We urge you to schedule early Senate action on S. 675, the
Endangered Species Act Amendments of 1987. The bill would
authorize funds for the protection of endangered and threatened
species. Many of our constituents have asked us to seek prompt
Senate consideration of this important legislation. The Senate
Environment and Public Works Committee is working to have S. 675
scheduled in a timely manner. We are interested in helping the
committee with this effort.

The Committee bill contains many important provisions
improving the joint Federal/State program for the conservation
and recovery of endangered wildlife. Authorization of
appropriations for the Endangered Species Act expired on
September 30, 1985. Since then, federal funds have been
appropriated for each of fiscal years 1986 through 1988.
Although the requirements and prohibitions of the law have been
unaffected by this lapse in authorization, timely consideration
of the Endangered Species Act Amendments would be appreciated.
Then we can ensure that this vital program will be reaffirmed and
improved without further delay.

All Senators have had ample time to study S. 675, which was
reported to the Senate on December 9, 1987. Since that time,
over 20 cosponsors have been added to this legislation. '
Moreover, the House has already passed a comparable bill —- H.R.
1467 —- by a vote of 399-16 on December 17th.

We realize that many of our colleagues have an interest in
this legislation and may wish to offer and debate amendments to
S. 675. That process cannot begin, however, until the bill is
brought up for consideration by the Senate.

Please schedule floor time for S. 675 as soon as possible.

Dear Mrs. Yarbrough:

Thank you for your recent informative letters to me, Senator Nunn,
and Congressman Swindall, as well as cOpies of letters to other
government officials.

It is good to hear of your support for so many worthwhile efforts
to protect laboratory animals, marine mammals, and wildlife. As you
may know, I was recently involved in attempts to block action on the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge drilling bill, and in committee
mark-up I offered an amendment to provide that more revenues from this
legislation, in the worst case that it passes, go toward wildlife
protection programs.

I am pleased to inform you that, at your request, I am a cosponsor
of Senator Dole's S.J. Res 197 declaring April, 1988, "National
Prevent-a-Litter Month". I ar hopeful that this legislation will pass
quickly.

I also thought you might be interested in the enclosed copy of a
letter I sent to my colleagues today urging them to join me in
requesting that Senators Byrd and Dole promptly schedule action on S.
675, the Endangered Species Act reauthorization bill.

Thank you again for taking the time to share your concerns with

IO-YEAR COMPARISON OF AFRICA-N ELEPHANTS BY SELECTED AREA

L__.

A new census of elephants in East Africa reveals
that the elephant population in Kenya, Tanzania
and Uganda has declined significantly in the last
10 to 15 years. Environmental experts predict
the animal will become extinct in those countries

by 1998, if poaching practices persist. Attempts
to protect elephants from poachers, through
export quotas and bans on private sales, has
driven up the price of ivory since 1970, from
$7.74 per kilo to $100 per kilo.

By SY MONTGOMERY

new census of elephants in East Africa reveals
that the elephant population in Kenya. Tanza-

nia and Uganda has dropped by 87% or more in
the last 15 years. and the report predicts that the
animal will become extinct in those countries within 10
years if poaching practices persist.

The census further says this unprecedented “popu-
lation crash" includes many national parks and game
reserves in those countries. It also suggests that the
situation may be equally grim for elephants through-
out Africa.

"This is happening so fast no one can believe it.
Sanctuaries have been turned into shooting galleries. If
the demand for ivory is fed, it's going to wipe out
elephants in East Africa." said Richard Estes. chair-
man of the antelope specialist group of the Internation-
al Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural
Resources.

The new census was conducted by elephant special-
ist Iain Douglas-Hamilton and commissioned by the
European Economic Community and World Wildlife
Fund. His report appears in the East African Wildlife
Society's journal, Swara, which hit the newsstands in
Nairobi in late March.

Douglas-Hamilton said he was able to spot only 100
elephants in the Kilifi District of coastal Kenya in
1987—where 10.000 elephants were known to have
existed in 1973.

And in Uganda’s Murchison Falls South National
Park—an area where the animals are supposedly
protected—the number of elephants has dropped from
13.800 to 725 in 15 years. decreasing by 95%, he said.

Decline is Precipitous

“The numbers are declining much faster than people
thought," said Rick Weyerhaeuser, director of World
Wildlife Fund's Africa Program. “This is a disaster."

“For East Africa the data would suggest that the
elephant is already an endangered species," Douglas—
Hamilton said. “There is no way the East African
elephants could sustain the ivory off -take of the last 10
years over the next 10 years without going extinct."

The report “is a cause for extreme alarm," said
researcher Elizabeth Marshall Thomas, whose work
helped lead to the 1983 discovery that elephants use
sounds below the threshold of human hearing to
communicate over 2 miles or more. “We’re going to
live to see the end of wild elephants in Africa unless
there‘s a stop to this."

The census. performed by researchers flying over
known elephant areas and counting the pachyderms,
surveyed 31 areas in Uganda. Kenya and Tanzania.

In a few protected areas, such as Kenya's famed
Masai Mara Reserve and Amboseli National Park, the
elephant population has increased as a result of
effective anti-poaching patrols and tourism in recent
years.

But the overall numbers show a stark decline. In
unprotected areas, the 10-year change shows a 78%
drop in the elephant population of East Africa. In
protected areas, which include national parks and
game reserves. the decline is 51%.

Increasingly, Douglas-Hamilton said. elephant car-
casses are littering his study areas. “Drought and
human encroachment are not killing the animals," he
said in a telephone interview from Nairobi.

That the ivory trade is responsible, he said, is
evidenced by “the number of dead elephants I see
{while} flying over Africa and, on all of them. the tusks
are missing."

Patti Loesche, a Douglas-Hamilton colleague, said
she has been seeing an average of one wounded
elephant each day in the course of her wildlife studies
over the past year at Tanzania‘s Lake Manyara.

Meeting an elephant on a forest trail “is an
incredibly exciting experience that deepens your
understanding of the way our ancestors lived," Estes
said. But walking along those same trails today, she
added, "you encounter the ghosts of elephants.”

About a quarter of Africa’s estimated 764,000
elephants are believed to be in Kenya, Tanzania,
Uganda. Ethiopia and the Sudan. But these are
admittedly guesses. based on little documentation.

Although census data is even more scanty for other
African nations, Douglas-Hamilton said, the situation
is probably the same—or worse—over the rest of
Africa. with the exception of a few southern nations
like Zimbabwe. where elephant herds are carefully
managed and reportedly growing despite a thriving
ivory trade.

But in Sudan, Chad, the Central African Republic
and Zaire, poaching has virtually wiped out the animal
already, according to an earlier Douglas-Hamilton
article in the journal of the English Fauna Preservation
Society, Oryx.

During 1979-82, for example, Sudan exported 1,200
tons of ivory representing the deaths of an estimated
107,000 elephants, or about 80% of the total elephant
population in that country, according to Mutasim
Bashir Nimir, director of the Sudan Wildlife Research
Center in Khartoum.

‘This is happening so fast no one can
believe it. Sanctuaries have been
turned into shooting galleries.’

 

With sharply rising ivory prices—which have
jumped by more than sevenfold since 1978—and the
increasingly easy access to firearms, there has been
nothing short of a firestorm of poaching, even in
national parks.

Since 1971, the value of arms imported to the
strife-ridden continent has increased from $500 million
to $4.5 billion. And some of those weapons have found
their way into poachers' hands, according to Douglas-
Hamilton. He said that some soldiers find poaching an
easy way to augment meager salaries and that park
guards are often simply not equipped to deal with
well-armed poachers.

Tempted by fast money. “it is not at all unusual for
park guards to turn into poachers themselves," Estes
said. This is documented by numerous researchers and
authors and acknowledged by African officials.

Douglas-Hamilton's latest census contradicts earlier
reports that have suggested that, at least in some parts
of Africa, concern over ivory-driven elephant poach-
ing is exaggerated.

In the late 19605 and early '705, elephants fleeing
poachers congregated in some national parks such as
Tsavo in Kenya. The concentration of animals dam-
aged trees and shrubs and, for a time, the Kenyan
government actually considered culling elephants in
these protected areas.

Moreover, studies as recently as in 1982 and 1983
sponsored by the US. Fish and Wildlife Service have
concluded that ivory trade did not pose an immediate
crisis for African elephants. Instead, researcher Ian

Parker had said, an expanding human population was
the major threat.

But Douglas-Hamilton has argued since then that
Parker's thesis was based on incomplete ivory trade
records that represented only a tiny percentage of the
actual numbers of elephants killed for their tusks.

International trade records show that nearly 300
tons of uncarved elephant tusks were legally exported
from African nations in 1986. But a 1987 meeting of
officials of the Convention for International Trade in
Endangered Species concluded that only 26% of the
ivory that actually left Africa was exported legally.

As the biggest tuskers are wiped out, elephant
hunters are resorting to killing smaller and younger
animals, according to Douglas-Hamilton. He said the
average weight of tusks imported by Japan—like the
United States. a major consumer of ivory—fell from
16.29 kilograms (35.91 pounds) in 1979 to 9.7 kilograms
(21.38 pounds) in 1982.

Some Governmental Controls

The governments of Kenya. Tanzania and Uganda in
recent years have imposed some controls over the
ivory trade, but poachers in those countries are
continuing to provide most of the world's African
ivory.

The Tanzanian government took over control of the
sale of ivory in 1986. allowing export only of ivory
obtained with legal permits. Kenya outlawed private
ivory trading in 1978, leaving the job to government—
sponsored cullers and marketers. And Uganda in 1987
agreed to limit annual ivory exports to 156 tusks.

Some wildlife experts hope that. in time. interna-
tional trade agreements that restrict ivory sales to
scientifically determined, legally enforced quotas will
quell poaching.

An ivory quota system was set up by Convention for
International Trade in Endangered Species agreement
in 1986, which was intended to impose limits on ivory
exportation.

The World Wildlife Fund's Weyerhaeuser said
promoting a legal and ecologically sound ivory trade
could give African nations a powerful economic
incentive to preserve their wildlife resources. He said
he hopes that Douglas-Hamilton’s census will provide
new incentive to enforce the treaties and adherence to
the quota system.

On a cool, quiet evening last fall, Mike Phillips, who
is a biologist with the US. Fish and Wildlife Service,
stopped his four-wheel-drive truck on a narrow log—
ging road in the brushy woods of eastern North Caro-
lina and shut off the engine. We got out and started
hiking up the road. Suspended above the pine trees, a
brilliant half-moon fit our way. We had gone only a
short distance when the beam of Phillips’ ﬂashlight
illuminated a trail of large pad prints in the moist
sand. “They’ve been here, all right," he said.

The “they” Phillips was referring to were red wolves.
A few weeks earlier, eight of them—seven from a

captiveobreeding facility outside of Tacoma, Wash-
ington, one from a sanctuary in Missouri—had been
released in the Alligator River National Wildlife Ref-
uge. A 130,000-acre tangle of snake- and tick-infested
swamp forest and marshland, the refuge occupies a
peninsula bounded by saltwater and the Alligator
River. Lush, secluded, hauntingly beautiful, it is lo-
cated just across the sound from touristy Nags Head
and the Cape Hatteras National Seashore.

The introduction of those animals to that place was
no routine experiment. The red wolf is one of the
most beleaguered large mammals in the United States.
Its purchase on survival is more precarious by far than
that of the grizzly bear, the Florida panther or the
manatee. A lanky cousin of the smaller coyote and the
more statuesque gray (or timber) wolf, the red wolf
was extirpated throughout most of its once considera-
ble range by the early part of this century. During the
past 20 years, federal officials have been working on a
complicated plan to reverse that process. The tracks
Phillips and I found on the Carolina logging road
proved that red wolves were indeed on the comeback
trail. Now, however, the question is whether they can
stay on it long enough to establish healthy, self-sus-
taining populations. If they do, it will mark the ﬁrst
time a captive-bred North American mammal that
had become extinct in the wild has been successfully
returned to its home.

Giving several pairs of red wolves a chance to live
normal lives may not seem like much, but in the risky
world of endangered species any progress, no matter
how small, is counted a breakthrough. As it hap-
pens, people who admire wolves have had a number
of breakthroughs to celebrate lately. Although gray
wolves remain conspicuous mainly by their absence in
the lower 48, there are some tantalizing signs that they,
too, may be returning.

The only sizable gray wolf population south of

Canada and Alaska continues to roam the forest-and-

lake country of northern Minnesota. There, after years
of controversy (SMITHSONIAN, january 1985), public
opinion now seems to be running strongly in the wolf’s
favor. David Mech, a biologist with the Fish and Wild-
life Service (FWS), attributes the turnabout in part to
good behavior. Notwithstanding the fears of area
farmers, Mech says, wolves seldom venture out of the
woods to attack livestock.

Compared with Minnesota’s 1,200 gray wolves, pop-
ulations elsewhere may seem paltry, but the important
thing is that the species is showing up in places where

it hasn’t been seen for a long time. Biologists are keep-
ing an eye on about 20 of the animals in northern
Wisconsin. Roughly the same number are holding out
in upper Michigan and on Isle Royale in Lake Supe-
rior. Sightings have been documented as far west as
Idaho. But the most dramatic reappearance is occur-
ring in the northern Rocky Mountains.

About a dozen gray wolves from Canada took up
residence in Glacier National Park a few years ago.
Today three and possibly four diflerent packs are
denning there. Other wolves have been spotted east of
Glacier. The FWS recently drew up a proposal to
reestablish wolves in Yellowstone National Park in
Wyoming. William Penn Mott jr., the director of the
National Park Service, supports it, stockmen oppose it,
and Congress will likely grapple with the issue later
this year. When it does, it will have to reckon with the
wolf’s compelling new image. Not only in Minnesota
but in other parts of the country as well, the animal is
no longer reviled as a wanton killer but revered as a
thrilling symbol of the wild.

Whereas gray wolves have managed thus far to edge
back largely on their own, thanks to a robust reservoir
of the creatures across the border in Canada, red
wolves are too far gone for that. Only 92 genetically
pure individuals are known to exist and all of them
(except for the ones at large in North Carolina) are

being held in captivity. It’s a tragic comedown for -a
stealthy, nocturnal predator that once ranged across
the entire Southeastern part of the country, from the
Gulf Coast to southern Illinois into Georgia.
Specialists in taxonomy have had a hard time de-
ciding what, exactly, the red wolf is—a species, a sub-
species of the gray wolf or a hybrid of the gray wolf and
the coyote. In the 19705, Ronald Nowak, a zoologist
with the FVVS, studied skulls from these animals and
found signiﬁcant differences. He concluded that each
is, therefore. a distinct species. Nowak believes red
wolves probably came from a canid that evolved en-
tirely in North America. About a million years ago, he
theorizes, some of those wolllike animals crossed over
the Bering land bridge into Eurasia, later to return as
gray wolves which then proceeded to back red wolves
into-what is now regarded as their historical range.
When pioneers moved into the Southeast, they
launched an all-out war on red wolves, which were
known to prey occasionally on livestock. The species
was shot, trapped and poisoned out of existence in
many areas, and much of its habitat was rendered
unsuitable by agricultural development and defor-
estation. Between 1932 and 1964, state and federal
predator-control specialists destroyed 50,000 wild ca-
nids, including a large number of red wolves. The
decimation and displacement helped undermine the
social structure of the survivors and they began to inter-
breed with coyotes. "They were simply mating them-
selves into oblivion,” says john Patton, an ecological
geneticist at Washington University in St. Louis.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  

  




1n the early 19705, the FWS initiated a red wolf
recovery program under the direction of biologist
Curtis Carley. The animals were then barely managing
to hold out in patches of marshland and coastal prairie
in Texas and Louisiana. “By the time our project got
under way," Carley recalls, “we realized it was going to
be difﬁcult to even identify a pure red wolf."

Carley and his associates knew it was just a matter of
time before hybridization with coyotes resulted in the
disappearance of red wolves in the wild. The only way
to save the species from genetic extinction was to set
up a captive-breeding program—a holding action that
would culminate in a! reintroduction attempt once
biological survival had been assured.

Over a period of several years, Carley’s people cap-
tured nearly 400 canids in and around Beaumont,
Texas. Most of them were found to be coyotes or hy-
brids; only 40 were considered pure enough to keep for
breeding. Those wolves were ﬁrst sent to the Point De-
ﬁance Zoo in Tacoma, Washington, and subsequently
transferred to a contract breeding facility nearby.
About a third of their pups survived and were certiﬁed
as pure red wolves.

“At that point, all of our genetic eggs were in one
basket,” Carley says. “To minimize the likelihood of a
biological catastrophe-the loss of breeding stock to an
epidemic, for example—some of the Point Deﬁance
animals were sent to facilities in other parts of the
country." Today, red wolves are being bred at ﬁve zoos
in New York, Texas, Louisiana and Washington, and
at the Wild Canid Survival and Research Center (also
known as the \Nolf Sanctuary) in Eureka, Missouri.

Last year I visited the sanctuary, which was estab-
lished by the late Marlin Perkins and his wife, Carol.
It is located at Washington University’s Tyson Re-
search Facility, a former federal munitions dump con-
taining 2,000 acres of wild Ozark habitat. Rare canids
raised there, in addition to red wolves, include Iranian
wolves and gray wolves from Mexico and North Amer-
ica. Bill Malloy, then director of the center, showed
me around and told me that wolves normally breed
very well in captivity. That spring, however, the sanc-
tuary’s ten red wolves had produced only two pups,
both of which died, apparently of a virus, a short time
after. whelping.

Sneaking up on the wolves

Malloy took me into one 2.5-acre enclosure where
six red wolves lived on the side of a wooded hill. Due
to their shy nature and the dense undergrOWth, the
animals were hard to see. We tried to sneak up on
them but they skittered away, running silently with
their thick, bushy tails held out.

Despite their name, red wolves range in color from

tawny to black. They generally weigh between 40 and
80 pounds (gray wolves range from 60 to 150 pounds).
They may at times appear scruffy and at other times
sleek, an aspect that is enhanced by their spindly legs.
Little is known about their social life, but it isbelieved
that mated pairs stay together. Unlike gray wolves,
which prey on large animals, red wolves seem to pre—
fer smaller ones. They eat rabbits, squirrels, insects,
even ﬁsh and plant material. They do much of their
foraging at night. The kind of thick vegetation found
along bayous and in Southern swamps seems to be
their favorite habitat.

Although, as Malloy indicated, wolves breed well in
captivity, generations of conﬁnement dull their sur-
vival instincts and may have an unforeseeable long-
term impact on their behavior. To return red wolves to
the wild as soon as possible was always the goal of the
recovery project. So in 1978, with the captive animals
steadily increasing in number, Carley tried an experi-
mental release on an island off South Carolina. The
creatures did quite well, scientists were able to monitor
their activities with radio-tracking equipment and
people living in the general area cooperated fully.

Encouraged, the recovery team began looking for a
suitable, permanent release site—a large, relatively un-
disturbed area where the wolves could ﬁnd enough to
eat, be free from harassment and avoid encounters
with coyotes. The ﬁrst. choice was a remote region in
Kentucky and Tennessee called the Land Between the
Lakes. After the release plan was announced, how—
ever, farmers and hunters raised such a ruckus that it
had to be dropped.

No sooner had that possibility evaporated than
another, even better, turned up. It was a huge tract in
North Carolina's mainland Dare County, property that
the Prudential Insurance Company had offered to
make available to the FVVS. Early in 1984. that wilder-

ness became the Alligator River National Wildlife
Refuge, and Warren Parker, who by then had taken
over the wolf-reintroduction program, designated it
his “primary candidate" as a release site. It was large
enough to accommodate a number of wolf family
groups, which was essential to avoid the problem of
inbreeding. It was isolated, had the right kind of cover
and was teeming with small prey animals, nm to men-
tion black bears, bobcats and raptors. There were no
coyotes. in the area.

A collar that “captures” the wolf

Fully aware that the earlier reintroduction plan failed
because the public had not been adequately prepared,
Parker went out of his way this time to inform the
local gentry. About 1,000 people live next door to
the refuge in three little communities-Stumpy Point
on Pamlico Sound, a crab and oyster ﬁshing village;
East Lake, once known for its moonshine but today
mainly a trailer park; and Manns Harbor, another
ﬁshing village. Parker held a number of public meet-
ings to explain the project and dispel misconceptions
about wolves. Some folks were reassured when they
found out about the “capture collar" each wolf would
be wearing. The collar contains a radio transmitter
and tranquilizer darts that can be triggered by remote
control. It enables scientists to keep track of the wolves
and to knock out a wayward animal for recapture
before it gets into trouble.

In 1986, preparations got under way to ship seven
wolves from Washington State and one from Missouri.
I went back to Eureka that fall to watch Diane be
readied for her trip. She had been selected not only
because of her excellent health but also because she
displayed the aggressive characteristics of an alpha.
(Alpha males and females are dominant animals that
pair off and breed with a high rate of success.) When a
technician tried to catch her with a big salmon-ﬁshing
net (above), she dodged and ran to the perimeter of the
pen’s chain link fence. Once cornered, however, she
became immobilized with fear, and into a shipping
kennel she went. Then she was flown to Raleigh-
Durham for a rendezvous with the other wolves, and
the whole group was whisked off to the refuge.

The plan was to keep the wolves in pens for a six-
month acclimation period, during which time they
were to be fed dog food, then road kills and, ﬁnally,
live prey. Following the release, which was originally
scheduled to occur in the spring of last year, Parker
and Phillips would continue to put out road kills for a
few months. After that, the animals would be on their
own. But problems with the capture collar caused a
lengthy postponement of the release.

I took advantage of the delay to ﬁnd out how the

 

 




 

 

 

 

 

The red wolf gets another chance

Carl Mann, who lives near refuge, fears authorities
will forbid hunting with dogs there because of wolves.

refuge’s neighbors felt about the wolf project. The
reactions were decidedly mixed. Ray Paschal, who
operates an auto-repair business in Stumpy Point,
typiﬁed those who had a good-natured attitude. “I
don't think the wolves are going to be a problem as
long as they stay out of our backyards," he told me.
Others were more skeptical and some, including a
goodly number of deer hunters, were downright hos-
tile. Carl Mann, a retired soldier whose great-grand-
father settled Manns Harbor, took it upon himself to
speak for local hunters who still run dogs on the
refuge. He’s convinced that the federal authorities,
having already curtailed hunting with dogs, plan to
eliminate it altogether. "It’s our sport and we've done
it for hundreds of years," he said.

Late in Séptember I got a call from Parker advising
me that the collars were ready and a release was set
for the next day. The following morning I was back at
the refuge watching veterinarian Larry Cooper take
blood and stool samples from the eight animals and
administer rabies shots, vaccines against distemper and
parvo disease. heartworm medication and vitamins.
The creatures were hung upside down to be weighed
and then, at last, the collars were ﬁtted.

"These animals face a harsh ordeal in this environ-
ment," Cooper observed as he worked. He talked about
the mosquitoes, which carry a number of parasites,
including heartworm. He talked about ticks (“I’ve seen
lost dogs come out of here crawling with ticks swelled
the size of grapes"), hookworm, tapeworm and sar-
coptic mange mites. As Cooper was ﬁnishing, Parker
yelled and pointed to a three-foot-long water moccasin
swimming through the scum in a slough less than 15
feet away. “Yeah, snakes could be a problem, too,"
Cooper said. "Red wolves never did live very long in
the wild—maybe seven or eight years at the most."

And then they wandered off

The next morning, the pen doors were opened and
the caretakers walked away. After nearly two decades
of planning and preparation, that's all there was to it.
Parker called it a "soft release" because the wolves
were left to wander off on their own, which, after a .
while, they did.

Everything went fairly well until the evening in
mid-October when 13cyear-oldjohn Barnes jr., of
Manns Harbor, heard his dog barking in the backyard.
He glanced out the window and saw what looked like
a "skinny German shepherd" eating food from his
dog’s dish. The wolf, a male, stopped by another home
farther down the road later that night. The radio-
tracking crew, following its movements, recaptured the
animal, observed it for a while and then relocated it,
along with its mate. Two weeks later the female was

found dead on a beach, apparently overcome by a
massive infection.

Another wolf, a male that had been staying close to
one of the release pens, was recaptured after his collar
malfunctioned. The animal, it turned out, had been
involved in a bad ﬁght—probably, Phillips surmised, a
territorial battle with a pair of the other wolves. He
had 35 puncture wounds (21 broken foot bone was
poking through the flesh) and had lost 25 pounds.
After he was treated and returned to a pen for con-
valescence, his partner wandered off the refuge twice.
She was recaptured but developed‘an infeCtion and
eventually had to be deStroyed.

Such problems were not unexpected. Phillips' assess-
ment is that, on balance, the introduction has gone
quite well so far. He is convinced that the vast major-
ity of the people living in the area now support the
program. None of the wolves has been shot. The ani-
mals’ scats contain hair and bone, which indicates
they’re eating well. “I feel very good that six of them
are still alive,”the biologist says. , . , y , _ . _ .

Monkeys provide second set of

little hairy, but he’s their baby.

 

Psychologist Mary Joan Willard
reasoned that if capuchins could be
trained as crude musicians and cash-
iers, they Could be trained to perform
chores for people who didn’t have the
use of their hands.

Her simple idea evolved into the
Boston University’s Helping Hands
Project, a program that she said could
make monkeys as valuable to quadri-
plegics as guide dogs are to the blind.

“The chains of behavior impress
people the most, I think,” Willard said
in a telephone interview. “A quadri-
plegic could direct a laser (using his
or her chin) at the refrigerator, and
the monkey would open the door. He

. could point at a drink and the monkey
would take it out, close the door, put a
straw in the drink and put it on his
feeding tray.” ,

The monkeys also are trained for
tasks such as cooking meals, retriev-
ing books and adjusting lighting, Wil-
lard said.

Since the project started in 1977,
only seven monkeys have been placed
with quadriplegics —— none of which
live in Florida.

That’s not many, especially consid-
ering that Willard has had more than
1,000 requests from quadriplegics
around the country who want a
trained monkey of their own.

But Willard said that if the project
gets enough financial support, she
could be placing 40 to 50 monkeys a
year by 1993. ‘

The first placements have been
free to the quadriplegics. Willard said
that when the project goes full-scale
there may be a token charge.

The accompanying stories look at
two vital phases of the Helping Hands
program.

One is Walt Disney World’s part of
the project. Officials at the Orlando-
area theme park have agreed to use
their nature preserve, Discovery Is-
land, to breed all the capuchins Wil-
lard needs.

Another essential part of Helping
Hands is the foster-home program. Be-
fore the monkeys are old enough to be
trained —— usually about 3 or 4 years
old — they need to be socialized in a
caring. family environment, Willard
said.

oyster family happy to mom

MULBERRY -— Casey
sucks his bottle, his brown
eyes impossibly wide.

After draining his formula
in about 20 seconds, he jumps
from his adopted mother’s
knee to the floor, then to the
couch, then to a visitor’s lap.

If Casey seems more hy-
peractive than most 9-month-
olds, maybe that’s because he’s
a baby capuchin monkey.

John and Wanda Keiser of
Mulberry adopted Casey at 9
months, and despite his pri-
mate status, he has blended in-
to the family quite well.

“We just love him,” Wanda
says as Casey climbs up her
arm. “But then, we’re kind of
animal freaks anyway.”

The Keisers are one of 63
families selected to raise mon-
keys prior to their being
trained in Boston University‘s
Helping Hands Project.

Once the monkeys are
about 3 or 4 years old, they
will be sent back to the univer-
sity to undergo a 6-month
training program. When they
graduate, they will be placed

with quadriplegics for whom the monkeys

will act as second sets of hands.

Thousands of volunteers

Project director Mary Joan Willard
says that nearly 6,000 people have volun-
teered to offer foster homes for her mon-
keys. A rigorous screening process has
narrowed that field down to 63.

Wanda Keiser’s interest in the project
was sparked when she read about Helping
Hands in 3 Ladies’ Home Journal article
published in The Tampa Tribune in July
1986.

That week Keiser sent a letter about
why she wanted a monkey to foster home
director David Taylor.

A month later she received an in-depth
questionnaire from Taylor, asking her for
details such as the material on her sofa

and the number of hours she would leave
the monkey caged.

She provided four references -— two of
them veterinarians. Those people also re-
ceived questionnaires.

“I sent the application through over-
night mail because I wanted that monkey
now!" Keiser says.

In November 1987, she got a call from
Taylor saying her care-and-feedmg infor-
mation was on the way. .

A week and a half later Casey arrived.

And he was as beautiful as Wanda
Keiser had hoped. The 2-month-old capu-
chin had a face the size of small lemon. A
ring of gray hair made Casey look like. a
little old' man, but his wide-eyed curiosuy
was 100 percent baby.

....~- ,..._.__

Wanda and her 18-year-old
daughter, Karen. were ecstatic. But
her husband, John, didn’t share her
enthusiasm for the new hairy baby.

”At first he wasn’t real thrilled
because it is time-consuming," Keis-
er says. “He said, ‘At least it doesn't.
wake you up at night like a real ba-
by.’ "

50 John Keiser thought.

Wanda Keiser had been awak-
ened by Casey‘s birdlike “peep,
peep” every two hours, around the
clock —— feeding time.

“He's just gotten to the point
where he’ll sleep like five or six
hours at a stretch at night," Keiser
says.

On top of the regular feedings.
Keiser has had to change Casey's
diaper every two hours — using ex-
pensive disposable diapers made
for premature babies -— and bathe
him every morning.

Teething a problem

Then there are some problems
that are particular to baby mon-
keys, such as the teeth marks on the
hanging—lamp shade.

"He’s teething, so his mouth
goes on mrerytln'ng." Keiser says.

Most of the day, Casey climbs
the living-room furniture or linkers
with the toys in his playpen. all the
while being tethered to a concrete
block.

Wanda Keiser says she wants to
keep his cage time to a minimum

 

 

Casey goesgrocery shepping with Wanda
Keiser so he will learn how to act in Dublin

keyaround

but has to restrict his movements a
bit so that he doesn't run away or
hurt himself.

When she has to go shopping ——
and can't get her daughter or her
husband to monkey sit — she takes
Casey along. He stays leashed to the
front of the cart as she rolls up and
down the aisles of Food World.

As Casey jumps from the front
to the back of the cart, grabbing ev-
erything within his reach. curious

shoppers close in, hoping for a good
look or maybe a chance to pet the
footlong primate.

Food World managers agreed to
allow Casey’s visits after a call to
the health inspector’s office gave
them the OK. Health inspectors said
Casey should be given all the free-
dom of a guide dog.

Managers at a nearby Publix, on
the other hand. have banned Casey.

The only restaurant the monkey
has visited is the Golden Corral.
Restaurant management there had
no complaints about Casey, but
Keiser says she had to keep him
caged or the animal would have eat-
en all her food before she could get
a taste.

With all the hassles involved,
some people may wonder why the
Keisers tried so hard to get Casey.
The family already had nine cats,
two dogs and four chickens.

Humaniike appeal

“It appealed to me in the first
place because it was so humaniike.
And I was probably also having a
touch of the emptiness because my
first one's getting ready to go in the
Air Force," Keiser says, indicating
her daughter, Karen.

“When I read the article (about
the Helping llands Project) I closed
my eyes, and I just couldn’t picture
not being able to move anything buy
my head,” she says. “It scares me to
death.

“My husband broke his neck in
’79,” Keiser says. “He's fine now.
But when I read that, i thought this
(foster-home program) would be a
really wonderful way to pay back
some of our dues. You know, we‘ve
been extremely fortunate."

One of the toughest parts of the
project for the Keiser's will be giv-
ing up Casey in about three years.

“We‘ll miss him, I‘m sure," Keis-
er says. “But we‘ll be at the top of
the list to get another one. I think
I‘m going to take a cruise in-
between, though."

 




Insurance for dog§, cats

Taking bite out of pet health bills

By Gail Appleson
REUTER NEWS SERVICE

NEW YORK -—— The increasing
sophistication in health care for
cats and dogs is good news for
owners, but the corresponding
bite of veterinary bills is leading
consumers to pet insurance —— a
budding US. industry.

J. Scott Henderson, president of
Danbury, Conn-based Animal
Health Insurance Co., said that
soon pet insurance will be avail—
able in 49 states, with the New
Jersey legislature expected to pass
legislation soon. Tennessee does
not allow pet care policies.

“Nationwide health and acci—
dent insurance coverage for cats
and dogs coincides with the emer-
gence of high-tech medical care
for pets,” Henderson said.

Animal Heaith is a young com-
pany that began selling pet insur-
ance policies last year.

There are few U.S. pet insur-
ance companies today, but the in-
dustry is beginning to grow now
that policies can be sold in most
states, insurance firms said.

“There is definitely a market

 

ter, agreed that pet insurance will
help save more animals’ lives. But
he said growth of the pet insur-
ance industry has been slack be-
cause of a lack of advertising and
promotion.

“A lot of people don’t foresee
disasters or don’t know it (pet in-
surance) is available,” he said.

Garvey said his institution sees
only three or four insurance forms
a week out of the 1,200-1,300
cases it treats.

“I think it (insurance) would
be good for both veterinarians and
pet owners if this suddenly caught
fire,” he added.

At the same time that the cost
of pet care has risen, the number
of households with dogs and cats
has also increased, said Christo-
pher Cross, vice president of mar—
keting for Animal Health lnsur-
ance.

Animal Health estimates that
more than half of the nation’s
households have pets, with about

55 million pet owners who spend ~
in excess of $5 billion per year, to ':‘

meet the medical needs of their

cies are underwritten by VPI in,

Cross said the firm' was founded
after its owners noted the success
of the pet care insurance industry
in Europe. ‘

“I am told in Sweden, 60 to 70
percent of all pet owners own in-
surance," Cross said.

“Over the, years there have
been several (U.S.) companies
that have attemped to sell pet in-
surance, but most have not sur-
vxved,” said Moore. “The pet-
owmng public was not willing to
pay a high premium.” .

Both Animal Health and VPl
said their plans are successful be-
cause they offer protection at
moderate costs. The companies’
policies cover only cats and dogs,
and coverage applies only to inju-

nes and illnesses, but not preven-
tive care, spaying or neutering.

will allow more people to provide
care for cats and dogs that they
could not otherwise afford, mean-
ing that fewer animals will have to

Pit Bulls Barely
On Tap l5 Bite List

By STEVE TEASLEY

Poddles and Cocker Spaniels bit
more DeKalbites than Pit Bull
Terriers last year, the DeKalb
County animal control center re-
ports. . _

But, says the county commis-
sioner who would like to see pit
bulls banned in this county, “If I
had a choice of itf‘ing bitten by a
peddle or a pit bull, I’d pick the
poddle every time.”

District 2 Commissioner John
Evans says he’s not impressed by
statistics showing the pit bull
barely in the top 15 among breeds
that reportedly bit DeKalb res1—
dents in 1987.

For one thing, he says, the death
of two children and the severe
mauling of an elderly woman —: all
by pit bulls in three separate 1nc1-
dents since November of 1986 ——,
put the pit bull in a “vicious’
category by itself.

In addition, he says, the pit bull
breed probably is outnumbered in
DeKalb by the more pepular
breeds like poddles, shepherds and
spaniels. Therefore, the statistics
don’t reflect an accurate picture of
the propensity of pit bulls to attack
people, he said.

So far, Mr. Evans has been
unsuccessful in getting fellow
board members to ban pit bulls in
DeKalb.

And, one reason, some have sug-
gested, may be the statistical infor-
mation he and the other commis-
sioners have on ’87 bites.

THE ANIMAL CONTROL Cen—
ter ﬁgures show that of the pure
breeds, German Shepherds bit the
most DeKalb Countians last year.

Fifty-six German Shepherd bites
were reported, plus another 31

said.

A dog that is labeled formally as
a dangerous animal here has to
have more restraints than the dog
that hasn’t bitten someone, accord-
ing to the new law.

For example, while kept unat-
tended on the owner’s property, a
dangerous dog has to be conﬁned
inside a kennel with a top, and the
kennel has to be inside a second
perimeter fence that is unattached
to the kennel.

A dog that hasn’t bitten anyone
has to be behind a fence —- if it is
unattended on the owner’s prop-
erty. But, it doesn’t have to be
confined inside another fenced
area with a top.

Spay -' Don't Litter

The month of April is Pre-
vent A Litter Month and 12
veterinarians in DeKalb
County have agreed to cooper-
ate with the Humane Society to
spay or neuter dogs and cats
living in our county.

It is essential that you have
your pet spayed or neutered or

. you are going to find yourself

with a litter of cuddly new-
borns very soon. You may
think you can get rid of the
new litter by giving them to
friends or just dropping them
off at the Animal Control Shel-
ter.

That may get the newborns
off your hands, but it does not
guarantee that they will live a
happy, nor even a long life. Our
Animal Shelter is full of un-
wanted animals. They make
every attempt to have these

pets adopted, but unfortunately ‘

it is an impossible task. Statis-
tics show that in this past year
seven and a half million dogs
and cats had to be put to sleep
by Humane Societies and ani-
mal shelters. And that is a bad
Situation.

 

Suffering an even worse fate .
are the animals that are simply ,

turned loose to make their own
way in the world. They don’t do
well. They root through rotting
garbage, are injured by other
animals, are hit by cars in
streets and suffer painfully be-
fore they die.

If you have a pet, it is your
responsibility to take care of
your animal. And that also
means taking care of that lit-
ter. There are already more
pets than there are good
homes. . '

During Prevent A Litter
Month these local veterinari-
ans will neuter a cat for $20 or
spay a cat for $30. They will
neuter a dog for $35 or spay a
dog for $40. A dog or cat must
have current vaccinations be-
fore spaying or neutering, or
they will have to have the
vaccinations before surgery.
Vaccinations are not covered
by the costs above.

SMITHSONIAN MAGAZINE - March 1988

By Michael Weisskopf

Plastic reaps a grim
harvest in the
oceans of the world

We build this material to last; now, after
years of dumping it into the sea, it’s come back

to haunt us, killing and maiming marine life

It is dawn on the Gulf of Mexico, nature’s rush hour.
Sunbathers and pleasure boaters, sleeping off the arid
heat of july, haven't yet descended on the shore. All
along the water's edge, seabirds strut and dive for ﬁsh,
while ghost crabs and ground squirrels scurry for food.
But this morning there's a human intrusion. A large,
bearded man slowly drives a tan pickup truck down
the beach, his right hand gripping the steering wheel,
his left continuously punching a portable computer to
record what the tide brought in.

As Tony Amos jabs computer keys programmed for
the most common discoveries, he rattles off the items
in the staccato tone of an inventory clerk:

“Plastic bottle, plastic bottle, plastic bag, Styrofoam,
plastic glove, plastic lids, foam packaging, plastic rope,
plastic produce sack, Karo syrup jug, six-pack ring,
another glove, Styrofoam cup, cup, plastic bag, plastic
fishing line, plastic bleach bottle, plastic egg carton,
piece of plastic net, 50-pound plastic bag of sea salt,
Bic lighter.

“More synthetic gloves—this is going to be a world-
record glove day. . . . Here’s an interesting plastic bot-
tle, mineral water made in France. There’s a Mexican
bleach, a green bottle. You see a lot of them. . . . Oh
God, more gloves. . .

itself from an abandoned curtain of plastic ﬁshnet.

Marine plastic pollution: time to act

Finally he brakes and gets out to inspect a specimen
for which there is a special computer key designated
“dead." A three-foot—long redﬁsh, its scales shim-
mering in the sun. has washed ashore. The ﬁsh is
ringed tightly by a black plastic gasket, which has
caused a deep gash and eroded the gills. Apparently,
months earlier, the ﬁsh had darted into the gasket,
which had lodged behind its gill cover. As the ﬁsh
grew, the plastic ring became a noose, damaging the
gills and thus eventually cutting off the animal’s supply
of oxygen.

Amos has come to expect such casualties. An ocean-
ographer at the University of Texas Marine Science
Institute who has combed the same seven and a half
miles of beach every other day for ten years, he is one
of a growing number of scientists who are document-
ing plastic pollution of the ocean and its perils for the
creatures that live there.

The thousands of plastic objects that Amos logs in
during every sweep of Mustang Island's beach repre~
sent a tiny fraction of the debris ﬂoating a few miles off
the Texas shore. And the problem extends far beyond
the Gulf. Throughout the world, important water
bodies—especially the oceans—have become virtual
wastebins for the tons of plastic products dumped
daily by commercial ﬁshermen, military vessels, mer-
chant ships, passenger liners, pleasure boats, offshore
oil and gas drilling operations, the plastics industry
and sewage treatment plants.

No one knows how much plastic pollutes the seas.
In 1975, the National Academy of Sciences estimated
that seven million tons of garbage are dumped into
the world's oceans every year. There was no overall
breakdown for plastics, but the academy itemized
trash from several speciﬁc sources. Measured in terms of
weight, less than 1 percent of that litter was categorized
as plastic. But some experts believe such ﬁndings

greatly understate the problem because plastic is so
much lighter than other debris. The production of
plastics has more than doubled since 1975. Plastic soft
drink bottles. for instance, were not introduced until
the late ’705. This dramatic increase is reflected in more
recent studies of marine debris. A 1985 report estimated
that merchant ships dump 450,000 plastic containers
each day into international waters.

Another measure of the problem is the vast amount
of plastic that is washed ashore. Mustang Island and
other tourist beaches along the Gulf of Mexico, a body
of water that shelters a busy international port and
hosts extensive offshore oil activities, look like clut-
tered landﬁlls. One three-hour-long cleanup of 157
miles of Texas shoreline in September 1987 reaped
31,773 plastic bags, 30,295 plastic bottles, 15,631 plas-
tic six-pack rings, 28,540 plastic lids, 1,914 disposable
diapers, 1,040 tampon applicators and 7,460 plastic
milk jugs.

The author, a staﬂ writer for the Washington
Post, has been covering the issue of marine
plastic pollution [or the past several years.

 




The oceanographer worries that people will begin
to accept ubiquitous trash as part of the environment.

It is one of the sad ironies of modern times that the
synthetic developed by Man to outlast and outperform
products made from natural materials is ravaging na-
ture in the process. Since the exigencies of World War
II spurred large-scale production of plastic as a substi-
tute for scarce resources, it has become the favored
American material—more durable than wood and
rubber, lighter than metals, safer than glass and less
expensive than leather. It is present in virtually every
product line from Army helmets to artiﬁcial hearts to
Styrofoam cups.

Today, the plastics industry occupies a major place
in the [1.5. economy, employing more than one million
workers in almost every state and in 1985 producing
$138 billion in ﬁnished goods. The 1.2 trillion cubic
inches of plastic manufactured in that year was near-
ly double the combined output of steel, aluminum
and copper.

As with all revolutions, however, there is a “trade-
off," as Ronald Bruner, of the Society of the Plastics
Industry, describes it. The very durability of the syn-
thetic has created a massive disposal problem, espe-
cially in the marine environment where seagoers

 

traditionally unload their domestic wastes and gear.
Bruner contends that it is n0t plastics themselves that
are the problem, but rather the way people dispose of
them. Regardless of where the blame lies, the problem
has caught up with us. Whereas other materials de-
grade relatively quickly or sink to the bottom, plastic
persists. Buoyant, it ﬂoats on the surface and can be
easily mistaken for food. Often transparent, it nets or
entwines animals that cannot see it. It is the most
common type of sea litter today.

Like individual mines ﬂoating around

A number of scientists believe that plastic is the most
far-reaching, man-made threat facing many marine
species, annually killing or maiming tens of thousands
of seabirds, seals, sea lions and sea otters, and hundreds
of whales, dolphins, porpoises and sea turtles. “You can
go to an oil spill or a toxic chemical spill and see ani-
mals struggling to survive," says David Laist, senior
policy and program analyst for the US Marine Mam-
mal Commission. “But those dangers are concentrated
in one place. \Vith plastic pollution, it’s a different
situation. Plastics are like individual mines floating
around the ocean just waiting for victims."

Until only recently, no laws have speciﬁcally prohib-
ited ocean disposal and dumping of plastics. As a
result, vessels worldwide have made the ocean their
home—and their dumping grounds, disposing of
wastes with a wantonness that never would be per-
mitted on land. Joe Cox, of the American Institute
of Merchant Shipping, explained the rationale for
dumping: “You go weeks without seeing any other
people and you begin to think there' 3 an awful lot of
water out there. Taking it down to the baseline of
human behavior, its just easier to do it."

Plastic’s devastating effect on an entire population
of marine animals was ﬁrst observed in the late 19705.
The victims were the northern fur seals of the Pribilof
Islands, which are located in the Bering Sea wesr of
Alaska. Scientists from the National Marine Mammal
Laboratory (NMML—a division of the National Marine
Fisheries Service) found that, beginning in 1976, the
seal population was declining at a rate of 4 to 6 percent
annually. They concluded that plastic entanglement
was killing up to 40,000 seals a year.

Naturally curious, the seals were playing with frag-
ments of plastic netting or packing straps ﬂoating in
the water, often catching their necks in the webbing,
according to Charles Fowler, an NMML biologist who
visits the islands every summer during mating season.
The debris can constrict a seal’s movements, prevent-
ing normal feeding. Unable to extricate itself, the
animal eventually drowns, starves to death, or dies of
exhaustion or infection from deep wounds caused by

the tightening of the material around its back and neck.
Many seal pups grow into the plastic collars, which
tighten as their necks thicken. In time, says Fowler, the
plastic severs the seal’s arteries or strangles it.

Fowler says that often more than one seal can be-
come entangled in the same piece of netting. He once
came upon a mother and pup whose necks were ringed
this way. "Every time the mother moved." the biologist
recalls. "she dragged the pup along with her. It was a
pathetic sight."

Some of the fur seals are also dying in the large
plastic nets used by foreign ﬁshing boats in the North
Paciﬁc. Draped like curtains for miles across the ocean,
these nets become death traps for many unintended
victims, including birds. Unable to see the translucent
material, they dive for ﬁsh trapped in the nets, get
caught and then drown.

Whales are also among the victims. They sometimes
lunge for schools of ﬁsh and surface with netting
caught in their mouths or wrapped around their heads
and tails. A whale dragging hundreds of feet of net
may be unable to eat. The extra weight impedes the
whale’s movement and can exhaust it. Beached whales
have been found on both the East and West coasts,
their bodies emaciated and entangled in plastic net. In
the fall of 1982, a humpback whale tangled in 50 to
100 feet of net washed up on a Cape Cod beach. It was
starving and so thin that its ribs were showing. “In a
couple of hours, the animal was so weak it simply
died," said Phil Clapham, cetacean research director at
the Center for Coastal Studies in Provincetown. "At
that point, it had been digesting its stomach."

Mounting rescue efforts for whales

In the past four years, Clapham’s center has received
reports of entanglement of about 20 humpbacks, an
endangered species with not more than 8,000 survivors
in the North Atlantic. Twelve were dangerously
ensnared; two eventually died. The center mounts res-
cue elforts to save entangled whales. One success story
involves a 25-ton female humpback, which staffers
called Ibis because a line under her tail suggested the
long, curved bill of that elegant bird. A playful,
friendly whale that swam near boats in the early 19805,
she was a favorite of scientists and whale watchers
along the New England coast.

In the summer of 1984, Ibis got tangled in 300 feet
of net. She was brieﬂy seen in October and then not
spotted again. Experts at the center feared she had
drowned. But on Thanksgiving Day Ibis, very thin,
tired and still badly entangled, appeared just outside
I’rovincetown Harbor. Crews in small, inflatable boats
approached her and managed to hook a rope onto the
tangled net. The rope was attached to buoyant floats,

After trying to submerge a few times, Ibis gave up.
She simply lay on the water’s surface, allowing the
rescuers to pull the net out of her mouth and off her
tail. Freed in two hours, she recovered and two weeks
later set forth for her winter migration. A healthy
whale returned the following May, and by June 1986,
Ibis was swimming with a calf. "A lot of champagne
was ﬂowing among the whale scientists on the East
Coast," recalls Clapham.

 




Such happy endings are rare for the victims of plas-
tic entanglement. Along Florida’s coasts, brown peli-
cans diving for ﬁsh sometimes go for ﬁshermen's bait
and get hooked. Sport ﬁshermen will usually cut the
line, thinking the pelican will then be free. But the line
is a killer. Sometimes the synthetic wraps so tightly
around the bird’s feet and wings that these limbs
atrophy. More often, the lines snag branches of the
squat, gnarled mangrove trees clustered on the islands
where the birds traditionally roost.

“Then the birds just hang there until they’re skele-
tons," says Ralph Heath, who runs a seabird rescue
mission near St. Petersburg. “They don't last long
once they’re suspended from the tree limbs. They
can't bite the line loose. They can't shake it loose. So,
they keep thrashing until they die."

From a distance, the mangrove islands along Flori-
da's west coast dazzle in the sun, ornamented by
large pelicans perched on boughs. But inside the trop—
ical grove, skeletons of seabirds dangle from plastic

 

 




strands, feathers broken in the furious struggle for
survival, splintered wings fallen to the swampy island
floor. Since Heath founded his Suncoast Seabird Sanc-
tuary in 1972 (SMITHSONIAN, August 1974), he has wit-
nessed hundreds of such hanging deaths. He has res-
cued thousands of other entangled birds, freeing them
from tree limbs or cutting off lines and hooks.

Cruising Boca Ciega Bay in a 24-foot motorboat,
Heath anchors near a mangrove island owned by the
sanctuary. He is looking for injured birds. An assistant
hurls Spanish sardines into the water, luring dozens of
pelicans from the rookery. Heath spots a bird with a
bloody wing and scoops it up with a net. A piece of
ﬁshing line is wound around its ﬂank, deeply etching
its humerus and cutting into tissue. Heath carefully
disentangles the bird and returns it to the water. "If it
wraps any tighter, it acts like a tourniquet and cuts off
circulation,” he explains. During the next 20 minutes
he nets and disentangles ﬁve more birds. "Once that
happens, it's all over."

Heath has found pelican chicks dead in their nests,
strangled by hundreds of feet of ﬁshing line that had
probably been dragged there by their parents. He. has
seen pelicans garroted by plastic six-pack rings—in-
cluding one with a ﬁsh stuck in its throat, held there
ﬁrmly by'the plastic yoke. _

In small shapes and sizes, plastic resembles the food
supply of some marine creatures. But-it is dangerous
to consume. Seabirds, mistaking spherical resin pellets
(the raw material used to manufacture plastic prod-
ucts) for ﬁsh eggs and other natural food, suffer intes-
tinal blockage and ulceration. \Nhales are also victims
of plastic ingestion. On New Year’s Day 1984, an infant
pigmy sperm whale beached itself alongside its dying
‘mother on Galveston Island in the Gulf of Mexico.
Named Laﬁtte after a French pirate who had once

landed there, the calf was taken to an aquarium and
nursed. Laﬁtte seemed to be healthy, eating some
squid and diving playfully in the holding tank. Sud-
denly he stopped eating and on January 11, he died.
Dr. Raymond Tarpley. a Texas A&M University veter-
inarian, participated in the necropsy. The conclusion:
Laﬁtte had died of severe infection of the abdominal
cavity lining. In the animal's stomach he found, among
other items, a SO-gallon plastic garbage-can liner, a
plastic bread wrapper and a corn-chip bag.

Most worrisome is the danger of plastic to indiscrim-
inate eaters such as ocean turtles. especially hatchlings
that spend their early lives at sea surviving off surface
organisms. To a turtle, says zoologist George Balazs of
the National Marine Fisheries Service in Honolulu, a
transparent plastic bag or particle can look like a
jellyﬁsh. plankton or the larval stage of a crab. Once in
the turtle's intestines, he adds. the indigestible mate—
rial can block fecal matter, prevent assimilation of
nutrients and make the turtle too buoyant to dive for
food. It is gruesome—but true—that dead turtles with
plastic bags and ﬁshing line extending from both ends
have been found in the Gulf of Mexico, in the Hawaiian
Islands and along the East coast. "When turtles eat
that much plastic," says Balazs. "you reach a point of
no return. Their ability to swim around is severely
impaired. Then they're at the mercy of the ocean."

In a way, the marine plastic pollution problem
crept up on American lawmakers. While several inter-
national conventions and federal laws have included
provisions to limit or prohibit marine dumping of
chemicals, oil and other substances, none of them has
applied directly to the more recently recognized prob-
lem of plastic debris. The 1973 International Conven-
tion for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships
(MARI’OL) contained an annex (Annex V) that

ken for food by feeding sea turtles.
and swallowed; they then clog the animals“ intestines.

 




would prohibit ocean disposal of plastics, limit other
garbage disposal and require ports to provide facilities
for receiving trash from incoming ships. But that annex
needed separate ratiﬁcation and it languished, lacking
the requisite number of signatory nations to become
international law (at least 15 nations representing half
of the world’s gross commercial shipping tonnage).
The holdouts included the United States.

A key turning point occurred in 1984 when a con-
ference on marine debris was held in Honolulu under
the auspices of the National Marine Fisheries Service (a
division of NCAA, the National Oceanic and Atmo-
spheric Administration) That meeting brought into
focus the scope of the problem and led to the founding
of NOAA’s Marine Entanglement Research Program.
It also mobilized governmental agencies and environ-
mental groups to push for ratiﬁcation of Annex V.

In the wake of that conference, Congress was urged
by the U.S. Coast Guard, the Marine Mammal Com-
mission, NCAA and numerous environmental groups
to ratify the annex. Finally, in the last week of l‘J87,
the United States completed its ratification process,
pushing the percentage of tonnage represented by sig-
natory nations over the level necessary for Annex V to
become effective.

Parties to the law now have one year to put their
domestic programs in place. Thus, beginning on De-
cember 31, 1988, it will be illegal for ships registered in
signatory nations, and all other ships within the waters
of those countries that'prohibit dumping, to discard
plastics into the ocean.

“I think that it is a remarkable thing that it hap-
pened," says Kathy O’Hara, who is a marine biologist
and plastics specialist for the Center for Environmental
Education. “It was an incredible public-awareness
event. A lot of the environmental community’s energy

was focused for the last two years on U.S. ratiﬁcation.
It deﬁnitely will make a difference."

But O'Hara and other environmentalists also point
out that although the annex will help, it will by no
means solve the problem. It only deals with ocean
disposal, for one thing, ignoring pollution from such
land sources as sewage treatment plants and plastics
manufacturers. In addition, nations not party to the
annex don’t have to adhere to its conditions unless
their ships are in the waters of party nations.

Moreover, it will be difﬁcult to get compliance. Con-
sider, for instance, the disposal choices facing a captain
bringing his ship into U.S. waters from a foreign port.
An already existing American law requires that any
garbage on this ship that has been in contact with food
must be incinerated or sterilized before port disposal.
(This law's purpose is to prevent the spread of pests or
infectious diseases.) Facing incineration fees as high as
$450 per truckload, however, fewer than 3 percent of
ships now bring their trash into American ports, often
choosing instead to throw it overboard at sea. Much of
this trash is plastic. Although Annex V will severely
restrict this option, the temptation to cheat is obvious.
The U.S. Coast Guard, which will enforce Annex V for
the United States, is currently developing regulations
for its implementation.

There is the additional problem of military vessels,
which are exempt front Annex V. American warships
alone discharge four tons of plastic every day, says
Larry Koss, environmental program manager for the
U.S. Navy’s shipboard program. While U.S. military
vessels are being required by Congress to comply with
Annex V within ﬁve years, each signatory nation will
be handling this question independently. Koss says the
Navy is exploring the idea of a special thermal waste
processor for plastics that will compact large loads of

The b dy of an albatross has rotted away, exposing

the enduring plastic items that ravaged its insides.

the synthetic trash into small bricks that can be more
easily stored and carried by ships to port.

The plastics industry also is addressing the problem
of plastics disposal. One spotlight is turned on degrad-
able plastics; the technology for some types is already in
place and research continues for wider and appropriate
applications. Several companies now offer degradable
resins for sale, and a few manufacturers in the United
States, Italy and Canada are making degradable plastic
bags. A photodegradable agricultural mulch has been
available for several years, and to comply with laws in
ll states, manufacturers have developed six-pack rings
that also break down in sunlight.

There has been some progress, too, in the area of
recycling. Plastics industry sources say that, in this
country, 20 percent of all plastic soft drink bottles are
being recycled into items like polyﬁll stufﬁng, paint-
brushes and industrial strapping. Technology is also
available for “commingled” recycling—mixing differ-
ent types of plastics in the recycling process—and that
process is now being used to produce a new building
material called plastic lumber.

Ronald Bruner, spokesman for the industry’s trade
association, says his members feel the “black eye” of
stories linking their products to wildlife losses. The en-
vironmental concerns are warranted, he says, but they
should not overshadow the great beneﬁts of the plastics
revolution. “Look at how many human lives plas-
tic saves. Take disposable products like syringes that
prevent the spread of disease; in medical procedures,
the use of plastic in sutures, prosthetic devices."

Meanwhile, back on Mustang Island, Tony Amos
drives his truck along the beach every other morning,
documenting the plastic debris that the tide has
brought in. "I never know what I’m going to ﬁnd
next,” says Amos, the professional trashcomber, who
estimates that up to 90 percent of the plastic items he
finds are dumped off ships. To prove his point, he
boasts a personal collection of plastic containers that
could have originated only on foreign vessels—Korean
shampoo, Cuban bleach, Moroccan mineral oil and
toilet bowl cleaners from Hong Kong and Czechoslo-
vakia. He agrees that Annex V is a solid step toward
addressing the problem, but ht points out, as do many
others, that further steps must follow. People in his
line of work don't tend to get overly optimistic. “I have
pictures of girls in bikinis lying among piles of the stuff
on the beach," says Amos. "People have almost got
used to this. Maybe it’ll become acceptable—part of
the environment." It's something to think about.

At four of the 26 middens, there
was no cone debris on top of the
snow, meaning, the squirrels that had
inhabited them had not survived.

According to biologists, Mount
Graham red squirrels rarely, if ever
abandon their middens and never do
so during winter. The 26 middens
checked that day to determine
winterkill had all been inhabited in a

squirrel census taken last fall.
At other middens, there were
several piles of cone shells, indicating

that there was a live squirrel around ,

somewhere. At some, the searchers
were met with proof positive of a live,
healthy squirrel when the inhabitant
perched on limbs and chattered. At
one midden, the squirrel came down
out of the tree branches and scam-
pered across the snow to get a closer
look at the visitors.

The Mount Graham red squirrel,
one of the smallest of the 25
subspecies of red squirrel in North
America, is mostly an olive and
brown color on its sides and back,
with a redish-colored streak down its
back along its spinal column.

Those on the mountain search that
day were part of a select group,
according to Tom Waddell, a Game
and Fish representative who has been
stationed on Mount Graham for more
than 20 years. They were, he said,
among perhaps 50 people who have
been at the summit of Mount Graham
in winter or early spring.

The people on the mountain also
represented a mixture of opinions on
the construction of the observatories.

Among them were several represen-
tatives of the Forest Service and the
Fish and Wildlife Service, the federal
agencies that have taken neutral
positions as they mull the observatory
proposal and its impact on the
mountain and the squirrels.

One of those representatives, 3
Forest Service employee who is not
involved in the decision on the future
of Mount Graham, has made up his
mind about the debate.

“I like the mountain,” this person
said. “Too bad the mountain and the
scopes can’t mix.”

A blunter assessment came from
Waddell.

“Those sc0pes would destroy this
place,” said Waddell, who was among
the first to challenge the university’s
observatory proposal when it was
made in the early 19803.

On the other side of the observa-
tory debate among the searchers were
three representatives of the universi-
ty’s Steward Observatory, which is
leading the effort to put the observato-
ries on the mountain.

UA officials have said they are
convinced that the observatories can
coexist with tht red squirrels and
other annuals it Mount Graham and

I

that the observatories are necessary
for the expansion of knowledge.

Oblivious to the debate that focuses
on them, several red squirrels on the
day of the search were seen scampero
ing up and down trees and on top of
the snow surrounding their middens.

This performance, plus the atten-
tion they have received in the Mount
Graham controversy, led one of the
searchers, biologist Peter Warshall, to
coin a new term for these squirrels.

‘The Mount Graham red squirrels,
Warshall said, are the “glamour
squirrels.”

Mount Graham ‘hunters’
seek squirrels’ survival

By Gene Varn

Southern Arizona Bureau

MOUNT GRAHAM —-— In a
snow-covered clearing just below the
summit of this tall mountain, a weary
group of squirrel hunters sprawled on
one of the few dry spots to assess their
daylong search.

Wet and tired from plunging
through snowdrifts and up and down
steep, tree-lined slopes, the group of
15 hunters listened intently one
afternoon last week to the scores on
their quarry, the endangered Mount
Graham red squirrel.

Their interest was not in how many
had been shot and killed that day, for
these hunters carried no weapons, but
in the squirrels’ survival through a
harsh winter.

The concern that sent the searchers
Tuesday to High Peak, Emerald Peak
and other points on top of Mount
Graham was the rate of “winterkill”
among the 250 red squirrels estimated
to be alive before winter.

Heightening the concern of the
searchers was what rose above them
as they lay in the clearing, the
l0,720-foot summit at High Peak, the
highest point on Mount Graham.

On that peak and on neighboring
Emerald Peak, the University of
Arizona hopes to build an observatory
complex that would rank among the
world’s best.

Standing in the way of the
construction of those observatories is
the Mount Graham red squirrel,
which exists no place else in the world
and has lived in isolation on and near
the t0p of the mountain for an
estimated 11,000 years.

Several groups, including organiza-
tions representing environmentalists
and hunters and the state Game and
Fish Department, have battled ﬁercely

against the observatory proposal.

These opponents contend that the
observatories would jeopardize the
survival of the squirrel and that the
mountain should be left alone.

The decision on what will happen
will be made this year, possibly this
summer, by the US. Forest Service in
conjunction with the US. Fish and
Wildlife Service.

But the focus of the searchers who
gathered below High Peak last week
was not on what the observatories
might do to the squirrels.

Instead, their aim was on what
nature did to the squirrels through a

harsh winter in which their main food
supply, cones from Engelmann spruce
trees, was in short supply.

As the group relaxed in the sun
after the day’s search, Randy Smith, a
Forest Service biologist who led the
expedition, asked what had been
found at 26 targeted “middens,” the
combination nest and food cache that
is the center of a red squirrel’s life.

Those middens, in which red
squirrels had been found alive in
earlier surveys, had been selected by
computer as a sample to determine
what had happened to the whole
population over the winter.

Smith feared the worst, believing
that because of the failure of the

THE ARIZONA REPUBLIC — Phoenix - April 3, 1988

Englemanri spruces that crowd the
top of Mount Graham to produce
cones last year, up to 50 percent of the
squirrels could have died. .

According to some biologists, that
would have brought the squirrel to the
threshold of extinction.

But the news was good at the end
of the search.

Smith calculated a winterkill rate of
18 percent, far less than he had feared.

The group of 15 who searched for
the squirrel middens through the
thick trees and the snowthat day had
driven about 25 miles up the SWift
Trail, the road that leads up Mount
Graham from US. 666. ‘

From there, the group had been
taken by “snow cats,” vehicles wrth
treads like a bulldozer’s, the final five
miles over a snow-covered trail.

At the top, the searchers broke into
teams that scattered out in an attempt
to ﬁnd middens marked in prevrous
Surveys of the squirrel population.

To determine whether a squirrel
was alive and using its midden, which
is buried under snow at this time of
year, the searchers looked for mounds
of debris on top of the snow. This
debris is the shell husks dropped by
the squirrel as it eats the seeds wrthin
Engelmann spruce cones. _ ‘

Canmes put
on the dog
for parade

By Floyd Whaley DALLAS

OF THE TIMES HERALD STAFF

 

Oak Lawn’s Easter Sunday parade
was not the most digniﬁed event, but
about 5,000 people turned out‘ to
watch fur—covered participants pant in
the hot sun.

The parade of dressed up dogs was
featured in the Turtle Creek Associa—
tion’s Easter in the Park.

“It’s just a neighborhood event,”
said organizer Gary Wiley, of the dog
day afternoon which was followed by
the Dallas Symphony Orchestra in
Lee Park.

Some of the more than 70 entries
parading down Turtle Creek Boule-
vard were a terrier in a tuxedo; sever—
al dogs honoring the holiday by wear-
ing bunny ears; a pit bull in fatigues;
puppies in a grocery cart; and a poo-
dle in bikini underwear.

“It’s Easter and she’s a lady,” said
Dallas teacher Ben Ortiz, of his stan-
dard poodle Jeté, who was wearing
traditional attire of bonnet and pearls.
Jeté also hosted a pair of lacy white
bloomers. “She loves it. I’m her date,”
Ortiz said.

The “Pooch Parade,” in its second
year, was added to the Easter in the
Park program to increase revenues
from beverage and souvehir sales,
which go to the Dallas Parks and Rec-
reation Department’s Adopt A (flow-
er) Bed program.

“It makes the work worth it,” said
Lee Park supervisor Carolyn Ma—
thews. A police spokesman said the
event drew a crowd that grew to 8,000
people to hear classical music after
the parade. “This is a good indicator
that the parks are for the citizens of
Dallas.”

A panel of five judges gave awards
in several categories to the parade
contestants. including smallest dog, 3

48 . Horses Suffer Agonizing
Deaths- Due to Govt. Bungle

 

 

Forty-eight wild horses died agonizing deaths because of
outrageous bungling by the Bureau' of Land Management
(BLM) -— which authorized a study of the horses that went

tragically awry.
BLM permitted a

to be set up in
Nevada’s Clan Al-
pine Herd Manage-
ment Area.

But enough hors-
es could not be ‘
caught, so a helicopter was
used to chase more into the
trap from areas up to 20
miles north of the trap.

All of the adult horses
were fitted with special col-
lars so they could be moni-
tored.

Then they were released
-—- and the BLM went on its
merry way, not bothering
to check on the horses
again.

But instead of heading
south to a nearby watering
hole, the horses chased in
from the north headed
back to their old area . . .
and found a fence blocking
their way.

They followed the fence,
trying to find a way around

u

it —- and weeks later, 48-

horses were found dead of
thirst, exhaustion and heat
stroke along the fence.

BLM has admitted in a
special report that it bun-
gled the project.

The agency has a stand-
ing policy in Nevada that

wild horses aren’t to be driven
from one area to another. But they
were.

BLM also didn’t have an inspec-
tor at the site to make sure every-
thing was going O.K. And nobody
checked after the horses were re-

leased to see thati
they were all right.

Fumed Russell Gaspar,
general counsel for the
Washington-based Ameri-
can Horse Protection Asso-
ciation:

“The 48 horses died in
agony. It’s clear the BLM
was not exercising prOper
control over the roundup
and it’s also clear that the
researchers did not give"
enough thought and atten-
tion to how the animals
they were capturing were
going to be handled and re-
leased.

“What’s happened here
is typical of the bureau-
cratic bungling that’s gone
on in several other BLM
studies.”

NEW YORK TIMES - April 7, 1988

 

By ROBERT LINDSEY

SAN FRANCISCO, April 6 -— A Fed-
eral appeals court here has ordered
;ree cutting halted on hundreds of
acres in the Sequoia National Forest
until a study of environmental conse-
quences of the logging is completed.

The ruling Tuesday by the United
States Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit overturned a decision-last fall
by Federal District Judge Edward
Price of Fresno. Judge Price had up-
held an assertion by the United States
Forest Service that it was not required
to prepare a report on the expected en-
vironmental impact before permitting
logging in the area.

 

-—-——— ..

 

 

But environmentalists said that to
some extent the decision was a hollow
victory because much of the affected
area has already been logged as a re-
sult of Judge Price’s ruling.

The forest, 200 miles south of here,
contains stands of huge redwood trees
that are among the oldest living things
on earth. Although the Forest Service
has prohibited cutting of the sequoias,
last May it authorized logging compa-
nies to cut oak, pine and other trees
surrounding them.

The agency contended that logging of
those specific trees would give the se-
quoias access to more sunlight and

.._ help regenerate the sequoia groves.

Sierra Club Suit
Disputing this position and contend-

ting that Federal law required the

agency to prepare a report projecting

sthe effects of the logging on the groves

'n greater detail, the Sierra Club
brought suit against the Forest Service
last spring.

After hearing the case, Judge Price
ruled that the Forest Service had not
acted improperly.

Environmentalists today applauded
the decision overturning his ruling,

Special to The Denver Post

COLORADO SPRINGS -— The
owner of 33 pit bull terriers plead-
ed guilty Friday to one count of
dog fighting and one count of cruel-
ty to animals.

Robert Thew, 34, will be sen-
tenced Monday, but District Judge
Steven Pelican said he will consid-
er giving Thew a four-year defer-
red sentence under an agreement
reached by lawyers for both sides.

'l‘hew had been charged with
seven counts of dog fighting and
cruelty to animals, but five counts
were to be dismissed in exchange
for guilty pleas.

As for the 33 pit bulls, Pelican
said Friday they probably will be
given to the Humane Society of the

k Preventing pet

By designating April as
“Prevent a Litter” month,
the Humane Society urges

more pet owners to
sterilize their animals.

 

By LOURDES

RODRIGUEZ-FLORIDO
Staff Writer

He’s got mournful brown eyes that
tell his story without words. A skinny,
black dog, he was found wandering
around the Sawgrass Expressway and
was dropped off at the Humane Society
of Broward County.

He is unadoptable. He has mange.

By the time you read this, he will be
dead.

Each year, an estimated 7.5 million
dogs and cats are killed in animal shel-
ters around the country, according to
the Humane Society of the United
States.

Not all of them are old or sick when
they are put to sleep. Many are healthy
kittens and puppies with nowhere to go.
There are just not enough homes for the
more than 70,000 puppies and kittens
that are born each day in the United
States.

If left to fend for themselves, the ani-
mals face a life of starvation, disease
and human cruelty.

Each year, the Humane Society in
Fort. Lauderdale takes in about 12,000
animals. Only 20 percent are placed in
homes. The rest are destroyed.

“The Humane Society doesn’t neces-
sarily save lives, but it prevents suffer-
ing,” says Lani Wigand, of the Broward
County Humane Society.

“Some of these animals get more love
and attention here than they’ve had
their whole lives. To me it‘s just real
important to try to get this point across.
The public shouldn’t hate us for euthan-
izing animals. But what they should do
is help us change this.”

What they want you to do is sterilize

your pet. This year, the Humane Society
of the United States has designated
April as national Prevent a Litter
month. A federal resolution is pending
in both the House and Senate of the US.
Congress.

It’s part of the Humane Society’s “Be
a Pal, Prevent a Litter” campaign.
which stresses sterilization, education.
and legislation. They hope the message:
will help to curtail animal overpOpula~
tion.

O"€l‘1)0pulatio

 

“The public shouldn’t
hate us for euthanizing
animals. But what they

should do is help us
change this.”
—— Lani Wigand,
Humane Society
of Broward County

“Literally the message is to prevent a
litter,” says Kate Rindy, coordinator
with the campaign. “We are all respon-
sible. We’re the only ones who can solve
this problem. It’s so easy, if peOple
would not allow their pets to breed and
to run loose.”

Rindy cites the 1980 Florida law that
requires sterilization of any animal that
is ad0pted from a shelter or pound as a
positive step.

Other measures also help. The Ani-
mal Regulation Division of Palm Beach
County offers a rebate of $20 for a fe-
male animal or $15 for a male animal
to Palm Beach residents who have their
pets sterilized. They also offer a dis-
count in license fees to owners of
spayed or neutered pets.

“We are having an impact on the
problem,” says Dennis Moore, director
of the Animal Regulation Division. “In
Palm Beach [County], there has been an
increase in [human] population, while
the number of animals destroyed has
leveled."

In 1978. 15.400 animals were im-
pounded by the Palm Beach County di-
vision. Last year the number was
14,403. “I think we’re having a positive
impact.“ he says. “But still you're de-
stroying over 9,000 animals a year."

Moore is seeing a decrease in the

' overall number of animals picked up.

but an increase in the number of cats.
Felines reproduce more quickly than
dogs.

“The mind-set that we have is that
cats are very independent,” he says. “A
lot of people let their cats do their own
thing and as a result will be causmg
much greater problems in the future."

Moore says the division will be pro-
posing laws to make cat owners more
responsible, such as requiring that fe-
lines wear license tags.

“The best thing to do is to educate
people in the value of spaying and neu-

tering,” says George Hulme, secretary

and executive director of the Animal
Rescue League of the Palm Beaches,
which operates a reduced-fee steriliza-
tion clinic. “It makes for better pets.”

Pet owners’ outdated attitudes are
responsible for uncontrolled breeding.
says Judie Schlei-Siegel, a board mem-
ber of Pet Aid League Inc. in Broward
County. “People have old concepts such
as that making animals have a litter
makes them better pets.” Schlei-Siegel
says. “There’s no truth to it. It’s unfortu-
nate that peOple think that animals are
humans, that to neuter a male dog takes
away his manhood. Education is need—
ed.” '

Both Pet Aid League and Animal
Birth Control for Broward Inc. are non-
profit organizations that help with ster-
ilization costs for people who cannot af-
ford to pay regular veterinarian fees.

Getting your pet sterilized does make
a difference. In six years, one female
dog and her offspring can produce
67,000 puppies. In seven years, one cat
and her babies can produce 420.000 kit-
tens.

“Because we domesticated them. it's
our responsibility to take care of what
we created," says Cherie Summersgill.
of the Pet Aid League. “We feel that the
bottom line is spaying and neutering.

Making sterilization affordable

 

If you want to do something to help
reduce animal overpopulation and
the suffering it causes, get your pet
or that stray you’re feeding steril—
ized.

Do it in April as a way of partici-
pating in the Humane Society’s “Be a
Pal, Prevent. a Litter" campaign.

You say you can't afford it, that
spending anywhere between $50 and
$100 for spaying or neutering is too
much for your budget?

Well, you can afford it. There are
several organizations in Broward
and Palm Beach counties that can
help you to pay for sterilization.

Pet Aid League Inc. and Animal
Birth Control for Broward Inc. will
set you up with a veterinarian that
will do the procedure for less.

Through Pet Aid League it gener-

ally costs $24 to $40. Prices vary de-
pending on the weight and sex of the
animal. With Animal Birth Control.
sterilization of cats runs between
$16.50 and $30. Prices for dogs vary
according to size and sex.

In certain hardship cases. the non—
profit organizations will pay for the
whole procedure. but this is on 3 lim—
ited basis.

For more information. or to set up
an appointment, call Pet Aid League
at 492-5110 and Animal Birth Con—
trol at 922-3604.

The Animal Rescue {League of the
Palm Beaches. at 3200 N. Military
Trail, West Palm Beach, charges $20
for spaying a female dog. $18 for a
female cat. $15 for neutering a male
dog and $10 for a male cat. For more
information. call 686—3663.

The Debate:
TORTURE 0R RESEARCH?

Today’s debte includes our opinion that it is necessary
for human health to use animals in research, an opposing
view from the District of Columbia other views from Cali-

across the USA.

Animal research is
needed; don’t ban it

Today is the beginning of a new life for thousands of peo-
ple walking out of hospitals with patched-up hearts and ar-
teries, new or repaired organs.

And believe it or not, many of them owe their lives to a

A few years ago, what’s now the beginning of a new life
would have been the end. But because of technology and
techniques developed through research on animals, mil-
lions will live out a full life.

But the search for prevention and cure of the diseases we
still fear is threatened by zealous animal-rights groups.

Some of the more militant of these groups have stolen
900 laboratory animals, vandalized at least 25 research lab-
oratories and caused millions of dollars in damage.

That’s deplorable. There’s no justifying such behavior.

But it’s having an impact —— intimidating scientists, dis-
torting the truth and misleading public ofﬁcials.

The American Medical Association has put out a call to
arms to physicians and scientists to help defend animal re-
search against restrictive new laws.

The price for medical progress must be borne in part by
animals, the AMA says, adding, “No legislation or standard
of humane care can entirely eliminate the necessity for
some animals to suffer and die.”

Animal-rights groups want to ban animals from all re-
search. They argue, as you can read on this page, that such
experiments are unnecessary, exploitative and immoral.

Those are opinions. Emotional. Irrational Misleading

These are facts.

b 600,000 heart and bypass surgeries are done yearly.

I Most babies who would die of heart disease are saved.

b We seldom hear about diseases like diphtheria, scarlet
fever, TB, whooping cough, rubella, measles, polio.

D And important breakthroughs could lead to cures and
prevention of AIDS, Alzheimer’s disease, strokes, cancer.

And all because of medical research using animals.

The government says 22 million animals are used annu-
ally in research. Only 5% are dogs, cats and primates. Up to
90% are rodents. The rest are ﬁsh, amphibians and birds.

The government also says only 8% feel pain. In 60% of
the experiments, there’s no suﬁ‘ering and in 32% the ani-
mals get pain-killing drugs or anesthesia.

Those are the facts. And they should prevail over the nar-
row moral and ethical interpretations of a vocal few.

Of course, no animal should suffer needlessly. No animal
should be maimed or hurt so someone can have a “new,
improved” pancake makeup or household product

Scientists can protect animals and preserve legitimate re-
search better than any ill-conceived laws. They can share
information to avoid duplicating research. And they can de-
velop and use alternatives whenever possible.

Animals should never be used for experiments unless it’s
absolutely necessary. But when it’s necessary, medical sci—
ence and society at large must reject the twisted argument
that animal life is more valuable than human life.

INGRID NEWKIRK
An opposing view

 

 

This research is wrong;
it must be banned now

WASHINGTON — The fa-
ther of animal experimenta-
tion, Rene Descartes, thought
that dogs were things. He
nailed them, fully conscious, to
wooden slats, then sliced them
up with a scalpel.

Despite their shallow reas-
surances, many experimenters
still follow his lead.

Take Dr. Barbara Gordon-
Lickey’s work at the University
of Oregon. She drills holes in
kittens’ skulls, rotates their eye-
balls, then forces them to jump
from great heights into tanks of
water. The kittens get so sick
from the drugs she gives them
that sometimes they cannot
stand, circling uncontrollably
when they do.

People for the Ethical Treat-
ment of Animals and other
groups have meticulously do-
cumented hundreds of cases of
blatant cruelty, unspeakable
pain and death.

Despite this and the inter-
vention of ethical scientists, the
National Institutes of Health
endorses such laboratories as
SEMA in Maryland, where
highly intelligent chimpanzees
are isolated in tiny microwave-
like chambers -— for human
convenience, not scientiﬁc “ne-
cessity” — and promotes ani-
mal-use advocates like Dr.
Robert White, who kept the
severed heads of monkeys
alive for up to two days in grue-
some experiments of practical-
ly zero value.

Animal research and its sup-
plier industries have become a
giant syndicate, greedily gob-
bling up government grants
each year, and determined to
trample less lucrative but hu-
mane alternatives.

QUOTELINES

 

Ingrid Newhirk is the na-
tional director of People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals.

 

We now know that data from
the unfettered use of millions
of animals in the last century
could have been gathered in
other ways, often through the
most valuable ﬁeld of human
study, epidemiology.

And many diseases, notably
up to 80% of all cancers, 90%
of heart disease and almost
100% of AIDS, can be prevent-
ed if money used to create dis-
ease in nonhumans is spent on
human education.

Last. week, the Environmen-
tal Protection Agency de-
nounced as “unethical” the use
of data gathered from experi-
ments on human beings in
World War 11. So should we de-
nounce the immorality of de-
liberately inflicting suffering
and death on living beings who
happen not to have been born
into our own species.

It is a matter of longstanding
prejudice, of supremacism, to
do otherwise.

R.G. Gentry wrote recently
in The Washington Post,
“Many whites were not ready
for the Brown vs. Board of
Education ruling, but blacks
were ready.

“Many men were not ready
for the consequences of the
feminist movement, but the
women were ready.

“The hearing-dominated hi-
erarchy of deaf education is
not ready for us to assume con-
trol, but we (the deaf) are
ready.”

Many humans are not ready
for animal liberation, but the

animals are ready.

“Those of us in pain have a special bond with animals.”
—— Donna Spring, founder, Disabled and Incurably Ill
People for Alternatives to Animal Research

“We want cures for our illnesses.
— Rich Simpson, founder, Incurably Ill

for Animal Research

“isn’t compassion one of the most important human
characteristics, or shouldn t it be? What right do we have
to take these animals and treat them like that?

— Jane Goodall, British behavorial scientist
who spent 28 years studying chimpanzees

“The bottom line is, without this research a lot of peOple

will die."

It’s cruelty to people
if tests are curtailed

NEW YORK -— Diseases
that once claimed thousands of
lives ——— polio, diptheria, small-
pox —- now can be prevented,
largely because researchers
had animal models to use in
their investigations.

Unfortunately, we are not
yet able to prevent or cure
AIDS and are limited in our
ability to treat it.

If efforts by animal—rights
activists to legislate and regu-
late animal research out of ex-
istence are successful, they will
slow or even stop much cur-
rent research into AIDS and
other diseases.

Biomedical research faces

enough challenges without the
addition of further handicaps.
_ Why is an animal model so
important? In short, our soci-
ety considers it unthinkable
and immoral -—- and rightly so
-— to introduce disease into an
otherwise healthy human in or—
der to study the whys and
wherefores of how a disease
progresses.

This is critical information:
We need to know how some-
thing happens in order to be
able to understand how best to
treat it and when.

Scientists already have
learned a great deal about
AIDS from animals.

They discovered that AIDS
is caused by a virus as a result
of research on cats. The identi-
ﬁcation of the type D retro-
virus that causes simian AIDS,
a disease in monkeys that re-
sembles human AIDS, was an
important step toward develop-
ment. of a system to test for
AIDS.

Frankie L. Trail is president
of the Foundation for Biomedi-
cal Research.

 

Goats, rabbits, mice, sheep
and guinea pigs all have played
a role in the attempt to unlock
the secrets of the AIDS virus.

Scientists continue to search
for an ideal animal model for
AIDS. The lack of one has ham-
pered researchers in their
quest for treatments and cures
and has had just as profound
an effect on prevention.

The Institute of Medicine, in
its 1986 report on AIDS, warns
that the scarcity of available
animals to test the safety and
efﬁcacy of candidate vaccines,
should the scientiﬁc obstacles
inherent in this research be
surmounted, may compromise
or delay adequate preclinical
evaluation.

While AIDS is perhaps the
most visible, it is not the only
disease or condition for which
animals will play a critical part
in research.

Those who suffer from
many other conditions, such as
Alzheimer’s, multiple sclerosis,
Parkinson’s and atherosclero-
sis, still wait for improved
treatments and cures.

It is naive to assume that this
progress will come without a
critical research resource: ani-
mals. And it is cruel to deny
hope to those who continue to
wait for brighter futures.

That will be the net effect of
placing the “rights" of animals
over those of humans.

Like most Americans, I
think that is too great a price to

Even show biz abuses

LOS ANGELES -— I’ve been
working for many years in the
ﬁght against various forms of
animal exploitation. Recently,
I’ve been concentrating on ani—
mal cruelty in the entertain-
ment industry.

This problem was brought to
my attention by an investiga-
tion of the motion picture Pro-
ject X. With the Society Against
Vivisection, I began the ﬁrst in-
vestigation of charges of cruel-
ty during production of this pic-
'ture. We were able to secure
eyewitness accounts, nota-
rized, in which the abusive
beating of chimpanzees was
described in vivid detail. We

took this evidence to the dis
trict attorney.

After a three-month investi-
gation, General Manager Rob-
ert Rush of the Los Angeles De
partment of Animal Regulation
asked that criminal charges be

know that big ﬁsh eat little ﬁsh
and cats eat birds. Where do
you see all this love and harmo-
ny in the small animals?

“Maybe there’s some rea-
sons out there that we will nev-
er understand, and then maybe
that little ﬁsh or that little bird
has been a naughty little ﬁsh or
naughty little bird.”

Mrs. Rathbone, this is a deli-
cate question, and you needn’t
answer it But is there some an-
imal that your group would en-
dorse for medical research?

“Yes, there certainly is. The
possum. Not only do weat the
society feel that animal has giv-
en this part of the country a ter-
rible name, we can’t stand
those heady little yellow eyes
and that horrid, scaly tail.”

Thank you, Mrs. Rathbone.
Our next guest is Rattlesnake
Walker, a famous swamp
guide. Mr. Walker, what is your
reaction?

“The possum is the No. 2
smartest animal in the forest.”

ﬁled against six animal train-

to the district attorney’s ofﬁce,
the statute of limitations had
elapsed on the most appropri-

ate charges. The trainers were

saved by the bell. But perhaps
only temporarily; the district
attorney is reviewing this evi-
dence and a civil suit might be
ﬁled. . ‘

For years, it has been the re-
sponsibility of the American
Humane Association to protect
animals in entertainment. The
Hollywood office of AHA
claimed that it had done an in-
depth investigation of these
cruelty charges. But Robert
Rush of the Department of Ani-
mal Regulation has said AHA
did not do an in-depth investi-
gation and has told AHA it can
best help animals by stepping
aside and allowing another or-
ganization to do the job proper-

Who is No. 1?

“The fox is No. 1. She can
run on three legs while she
rests one. She rests the left
front leg ﬁrst, then back right,
and so on. She can run forever

er, too. He can pretend he has

Deﬁnitely not It’s inhumane
to use animals in experiments.
No one should have to go
through that type of pain un-
necessarily, and that is exactly
what laboratory animals have
to endure. It’s just unfair. I
have always loved animals,
and I have always felt that us-
ing them in research was
wrong.

Nobody likes the idea, but it
has to be done. Animals are
necessary in research to help
ﬁnd the answers to the medical
questions that will help human-
kind. I’m not an animal hater. I
have one guinea pig, two ham-

long as the animals are not be
ing mistreated, I think they
should be used.

I’m a right-to—lifer ——- I’m
against killing anything. Only
in extreme cases, however,
would I consider using animals
in laboratory research. For ex-
ample, using humans for re-
search that involves a cata-

ease would be too risky.
Animals obviously would be
the better subjects.

Yes, I do. We have to have
some way to conduct experi-
ments and,'at this time, ani-
mals are the only alternatives.
We certainly can’t use humans
in research. Some animal-
rights supporters say the ani-
mals are being tortured in the
labs, but I don’t think they are.
Hopefully, they’re only. being
used morally to help mankind.

At Sea World, Stress Tests Whale and Man?

By ROBERT REINHOLD

Special to The New York Times

SAN DIEGO —— lf killer whales could
communicate with humans, as some
experts believe they may someday,
four of the whales here might give an-
swers to some profound questions:

Why did they turn on two of their
trainers, nearly killing them? Are
highly intelligent ocean creatures like
these happy spending their lives in a
big tank doing stunts for human audi-
ences? Does the human species have
the right to confine them for entertain-
ment and profit. or even research?
ilk/hat, in short, is the proper relation-
_.ship between the two most highly
levolved species in the planet’s two bio-
logical realms, land and sea?

Such are the questions that have
been swirling around Sea World, the
huge marine life entertainment park
here, in the wake of 14 recent accidents
with the whales” human trainers. Two
were seriously injured when dragged
under or struck by the whales, six-ton
black-and-white animals said by some
experts to be so emotionally sensitive
that, like humans, they get ulcers when
unhappy and depressed.

But for the corporate parent of Sea
World, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich
Inc, the publishing and insurance con-
glomerate based in Orlando, Fla, the
issue involves much more than the
nexus between humans and cetaceans.
For the whales are the superstars of
three ~— soon to be four — marine
theme parks that have become the
most profitable arm of a company that
is desperately cash-hungry because its

debt grew to $2.7 billion last year fighto;
ing off a takeover by Robert Maxwell.‘
the British publisher.

The three top managers of the San
Diego park have been dismissed be-
cause of the accidents. But critics
charge that the ultimate blame lies
with the higher management of Har-
court, whose chairman is William
Jovanovich, for putting too much pres-
sure on the whales and their low-paid,
inexperienced trainers.

Last month. Sea World began year—

 

long festivities leading to its 25m anm'
versary. The park hopes to draw a
record four million visitors this year.
at $19.95 a head for adults, $4.95 for
children. A new whale show begai
March 23. The four whales, Orky,
Corky, Shamu and Kandu, put on a daz-
zling show of leaps and back flips, wav-
ing their huge flippers on cue 'and
splash-ing the delighted crowd of 3,000
in sun-drenched Shamu Stadium.

But for now the show does not fea-
ture bare-back riding or swim-alongs
as itdid in the past. The eight trainers
in wet suits keep a respectful distance
at the edge of the six-million gallon

tank.

 




“We were domg some very spectacu—
lar things that enhanced the show
value, but we overemphasized the im-
portance of the entertainment,” said
Robert K. Gault Jr., the new president
of Sea World. “People come to see the
whales. We’ve taken a step back to re—
evaluate our safety and training.”

Despite their name, their mouthful of
frightening teeth and ferocity when it.
comes to devouring salmon and seals,’
killej whales are generally consideredl
quite gentle and friendly with humans.
Many;prefer to call them orcas, afterE
their scientific name, Orcinus orca, be?
catise killer whale is misleading. No
other aquarium has reported troubles
witlrjorcas similar to those at Sea
Worlds

56 what happened here is puzzling.
While in the tank on March 4, 1987, a 21-
year-old trainer, Jonathan Smith, was
hit on the back by a male orca, grabbed
in the jaws of another, dragged down
and smashed against the bottom of the
40-foot-deep pool. He suffered a lacer-
ated liver, heavy internal bleeding and
other injuries.

Mr. Smith filed suit this month
charging that the park “induced” him
into the pool, “representing to him it
was safe for him to enter the pool with
little or no training. knowing well that
killerwhales have a dangerous propen-
sityfor attacking, ramming, dragging
and smashing people." The suit adds
that “he was told the animals were
gentle" at a time when the park knew
that. the recent introduction of a new
aggressive male with female orcas
raised the danger. His lawyer, Charles
A. Bleiler, charged that most of the
trainers had little experience working
with animals.

Mr. Gault would not comment on the
suit except to say that it had “no legal
basis" because Mr. Smith had received
\i'orkntan's cornpensat‘on benefits.

Old Conflicts
Resurface

About a dozen less serious incidents
followed, but no changes were made ei~
ther in the shows. the training of the
workers or in the handling of the
whales. Then on Nov. 21, a i2,000-pound
whale struck John Sillick, 26, while he
was riding on the back of another. He
suffered a broken back, hip, pelvis, leg
and ribs and has undergone two opera-
liUllS.

“I’m learning to walk again,’ he said
in‘an interview at home. He said he had
no prior experience when he first got
into the pool and that the training was
“learn as you go." Still, he said was not
bitter and liked working at Sea World.

Two weeks later, the three top man-
agers at Sea World were dismissed.
They were Jan E. Schultz, the presi~
dent, Lanny Cornell, the chief zoologist.
and David Butcher, the chief trainer.
Mr. Schultz sued, charging he had been
dismissed "in bad faith and unfairly"
and made a "scapegoat" for the acci—
dent but he has now asked that his suit
he 'i'x’lllldl‘anl. suggesting an out-of-
f‘Ot'll settlement has been reached.

'I'ht episodes at Sea World have
"ekindled longstanding conflicts be-

tween the marinr parks and whale ad- ‘

humanlike.

They travel in “pods," or kinship
groups, of 15 or 20 that are like ex-
tended families and are not incestuous.
Like humans, the whales mature sex-
ually in their teens and can live as long
as 70 or 80 years in the wild in the case
of females, 50 years for males, accord-
ing to Dr. Michael A. Bigg, a leading ex-
pert at the Pacific Biological Station, a
Canadian Government installation in
Nanaimo, British Columbia.

Such advanced creatures should be
left to run their own lives, say their
human defenders, like Dr. Paul Spong,
director of Orcalab, a private research
institution on Hanson Island, British
Columbia.

“They are the highest evolved crea-
tures in the ocean,” he said. “We are
begining to realize animals have rights
and the more highly evolved have more
than the lower. Those rights should in-
clude freedom, to live freely in the
ocean and manage their own affairs.

their social and space needs.”

 

‘ whales, go to Alaska," he said. “Most
people cannot do that. But they can
come here by the millions. So while we
are entertaining people, they walk out
educated too.”

. Newcomers
In the Tank

The troubles at Sea World began
soon after it acquired a competing
park, Marineland in Rancho Palos
Verdes near Los Angeles, shut it down,
and brought its two whales, Orky and

tion of Orky, an agressive male, into
the Sea World tank with females of
breeding age may have altered the so-
cial mix, experts speculate.

Orky had a reputation for being a lit-
tle cranky and trainers avoided going
into the water with him at'Marineland.
But said Al Pentis, an independent ma-
rine biologist who used to run Boy
Scout educational programs at Sea
World, the trainers immediately en-
tered at Sea World. “That was a sign
Sea World was in too big a hurry," he
said.

Bleiler, the lawyer for Mr. Smith, said
many of the trainers were young peo-
ple, none of whom were required to
have experience working with animals.
They earned as little as $6.05 an hour.

In addition to the turnover, Mr.
Spong, the whale advocate, theorized
that the animals, which normally
cruise 50 to 100 miles a day, were under
stress because of their confinement.
.“Even though they exercise, it’s like
prison.” he said. “You cannot consider
this to be a happy animal.”

Mr. Gauit, the Sea World president,
acknowledged some of this was possi-
ble. He said the introduction of new ani-
mals, breeding activity. including one
live birth last year, the building of a
large new tank and the training for new
{shows all may have combined to alter
athe social interaction of the creatures.
“We did not have enough experienced

Another factor may have been the '
high turnover among the trainers. Mr. 3

As a result, Sea World has tightened
its training procedures and hopes to re»
turn trainers to the tanks within three
months. In the past, there was an em-
phasis on developing the putative
“friendship" between animal and
trainer, rewarding the animal for good
behavior with not only food but also af-
fection.

The new approach, under the new
chief trainer, Michael Scarpuzzi,
avoids the issue of whether the animals
can develop emotional ties to humans.
“These are animals," he said, “\‘t'e
don’t know what they are thinking or
feeling. It‘s strictly communication to

train the animal.

“We ask them to give their flipper.
We reward that. If we get into feelings
or thoughts, we get into a lot of gray
areas that get us into trouble. Sim~
plicity and consistency is the best ap--
proachﬁ’

Why would the animal injure his

 

trainer? “They have moods," said Dr.
Bigg, the orca expert. “The trainer’s;

job is to know when the animal is not in

a good mood. Now and then they will
grasp somebody in the mouth, but it‘s
clearly not a serious attempt to hurt.
They are very powerful animals and
could do a lot more damage than they
do. There is no case of a whale ever kill-
ing a human in the wild.”

Such critics say whales should be
freed. “Putting a whale that’s used to
swimming in the wild into captivity is
like putting a human in a closet,” said
Scott Timingham, president of the Sea

Redondo Beach, Calif. “It’s not just the
lack of space. They are subject to

Kittens no IOnger satisfy popular gorilla

By S. L. Wykes
Knight- Ridder .Neuspapers

. WOODSIDE, Calif. —— Koko, the Wood-
s1de gorilla who gained international rec-
ognition through her use of sign language
and her love of a tailless kitten called All
Ball, has issued a pressing message: She
wants to have a baby.

“Want gorilla baby,” she signs, her
arms making a cradle-rocking motion. At
other times, she lifts her gorilla baby doll
and points to her nipples. “Drink there,”
she signs.

But like many modern females who
have put off having a family, Koko is fight-
ing a biological clock, not to mention an-
other major obstacle —— the difﬁculty cap-
tive gorillas have breeding the traditional
way.

So sometime this spring, perhaps as
soon as the middle of this month, Koko
will be artificially inseminated with the

sperm of Ivan, a wild- born gorilla who
lives in Tacoma, Wash.

Koko will be 17 years old in July and
has been able to reproduce for at least
seven years. Most zoo gorillas stop con-
ceiving in their mid-20s

One approach commonly used to breed
gorillas in captivity would be to take Koko
to a male, in hopes that they would mate.
But moving her might disrupt her too
much, said her teacher and friend for the
past 15 years, Penny Patterson.

“When we moved from Stanford to [the
Woodside compound of the Gorilla Foun-
dation], there was a six-month period
where Koko would not eat and wasn’t talk-
ing," Ms. Patterson said.

Artiﬁcial insemination is no sure thing
either, she said The odds are very much
against a successful insemination on the
ﬁrst attempt Under perfect conditions ar-
tificial insemination in humans succeeds
only once in every six treatments.

Kokos first insemination wili not by
any means be made under perfect condi
tions.

Although a semen collection expert
has rated lvan‘s sample among the best he
has seen in 15 years. the sample will not
be fresh, nor was it frozen specifically for
insemination. It was collected and saved
to test Ivan‘s fertility. Any misstep in
thawing will destroy its potency.

Ms Patterson will be assisted in the
process by Gilroy veterinary technician
Barbara Binder Ms. Binder was trained
by Carrol Platz, a former Baylor Universi-
ty reproductive physiologist.

“She is a beautiful animal much ”pret-
tier in person than in her pictures; Ms.
Binder said. “I just fell in love!”

Ms. Patterson has loved Koko for much
longer and has been thinking about how to
overcome Koko 5 lack of a gorilla role
model. which might affect Koko s ability to
rear her own baby.

 

who now wants a baby

Kokos

mother a San Francisco Zoo

gorilla did not have enough breast milk to
feed her baby. At 6 months of age — many
months earlier than wild gorillas are
weaned —— Koko began her life among
humans.

Koko s attachment and affection for'
kittens which along with her signing has
made her an international star, is evi-
dence of purely instinctive mothering, Ms.
Patterson said

If April comes and goes and no oppor-
tune time for the insemination arrives,
Ms. Patterson will keep trying. “We re just
hoping for the best,” she said.

The best would be a real live baby go-
rilla for Koko to rear and perhaps to teach
to sign. She has already indicated an in-
terest in passing on that knowledge

“Koko has dolls that are the size and
shape of gorilla babies,” Ms. Patterson
said and she molds their hands into
signs.

 

Koko’s ability to communicate has
made her a national celebrity.

Hunters driving panda to extinction,
figures on poachers in China show

From Staﬂantl Vl"ire Reports

WASHINGTON — Chinese au-
thorities have arrested 203 peOple
on charges of illegal hunting of the
endangered giant panda and recov-
ered 146 pelts, representing about
one in seven of all pandas alive at
the last count, the World Wildlife

Fund (WWF) said Wednesday.

“These are shocking revela—
tions,” said William Reilly, presi-

dent of the fund’s U.S. affiliate.

“The situation appears to be wors-

ening for the panda.” with the ani—

Reilly said it was the first time
China had released such detailed
statistics.

The fund said it was renewing

public estimate of the panda popu-
lation: about 1000. Another survey
is under way. and results have been
announced only for the Woiong Na-
ture Preserve: 72 now compared
with 145 in 1976. ‘

Chinese authorities previously
said poaching was under controi.
though the possibility of the death
penalty for poachers was an-
nounced last fall. the fund said.

Forestry Minister Gao Dezhan
announced the arrest statistics in
February. He reportedly said 150

tigation into poaching and fur trade

China. where almost all pandas live.

Dear Connie:

Thank you for contacting me regarding several important
animal and environmental issues.

On January 6, 1987, Senator Stevens introduced S. 62, the
Driftnet Import Monitoring, Assessment, and Control Act of 1987.
This bill would amend the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and
Management Act to regulate driftnet fishing operations in waters
off the coast of the United States.

The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation
held a hearing on this measure on April 30, 1987. The measure
was reported out of the Commerce Committee on December 16, 1987;
however, no further action has been scheduled.

Senator Ernest Hollings, the Chairman of the Senate Commerce
and, Science and Transportation Committee, has planned a series
of hearings beginning on April 13, 1988, on the reauthorization
of the Marine Mammal Protection Act. According to Committee
staff, legislation will be drafted as a result of these hearings.
It is my understanding that the reauthorization will begin with
Fiscal Year 1989 for a five—year period.

For the last two to three years, native Americans have been
allowed to conduct "subsistence harvests" of fur seals. Less
than 5,000 seals a year are killed, and the meat is frozen and
eaten throughout the year. In accordance with the Marine Mammal
Protection Act, the pelts cannot be used for any purpose.
Hunters are asking that they be allowed to sell the pelts taken
during the harvest. This issue will be considered by the
Commerce Committee during its April hearings.

You will be pleased to know that I am a cosponsor of
S.J. Res. 197, Prevent—a-Litter Month. This measure is designed
to raise the public's awareness of the importance to our society
of the spading and neutering of animals to prevent unwanted
births.

 




Mrs. Constance F. Yarbrough

Connie, as always, it is good to hear from you. As these and
other animal and environmental issues come before the full
Senate, I will keep your comments in mind.

Sincerely,

Sam Nunn

Couple Envisions Retirement Home For Monkeys

By Tom Uhlenbrock
Of the Post—Dispatch Statt

“Man, however well-behaved, at
best is only a monkey shaved. ”
~— William Gilbert, 1836—1911
Tim and Robin Goodale share
their three-bedroom home in a St.
Peters subdivision with five mon-
keys. They’ve made arrangements
to acquire 53 more, and say they
plan to make room for up to 1,000.
Also living in the small ranch
house are three poodles, two cocka-
teels, seven guppies and the Goo-
dales’ three children.
“It’s crowded, but it’s worth it,”
Robin Goodale said.
The Goodales are “animal activ-
ists” who specialize in “rescuing”
monkeys that are either pets that
have outlived their welcome or lab
animals that are no longer needed.
As members of the Simian Society
of America Inc., they have helped
place such animals in new homes.
“But we found that some were
again being used for lab experi—
ments or exhibition, and we don’t
want. that,” Robin Goodale said. “So
now we’re trying to build a perma-
nent place to keep them.”
Jojo, Queta, George, Christina
and Gomer --- four capuchins and a
macaque —- currently reside in
large, toy-filled cages in the Geo
dale’s living room and basement.
They soon will be joined by three
more caputhins and 50 squirrel . - f . . y , _ . . . j _

monkeys on wait, in addition to the
ones in Arizona," Tim Goodale said.

Vicky Norwood of the university’s
psychology animal lab said the capu»
chins would be sent to the Goodales
next week, and the squirrel monkeys
might soon follow. “I talked to Tim
this morning and he’s definitely inter
ested in them,” she said Tuesday.
“We want to place them in a good
home.” .

Norwood said the university was
phasing out its primate colony.

The new arrivals will be housed for
now in the Goodales’ basement. "It’s
huge, and squirrel monkeys are
small,” Robin said. But the couple has
long-range plans; they want to build a
monkey sanctuary to house up to
1,000 primates.

The Goodales have located land off
Highway K inSt. Charles County and
have the blueprints for the facility.
They’ve even come up with a name
~— the PIN Foundation, which stands
for “Primates in Need.” The non-
profit sanctuary would be closed to
the public but would serve as sort of a
retirement home for monkeys.

“These monkeys have been sub-
jected to inhumane treatment,” Tim
Goodale said. “We think they deserve
to have a quiet place to live out their
lives.”

The Goodales estimate the cost of
building the sanctuary and operating
it for a year at $200,000. They said

,two corporations with world head-
quarters in St. Louis may help fi-
nance the project.

He named the corporations, both of
which use animals in some of their
operations, but asked that they not be
identified publicly until they have
made a commitment.

The Goodales said there would be

few restrictions on the monkeys ac-‘
cepted at their sanctuary. “We have
no biases,” Robin Goodale said. “We
don’t care if they’re old, toothless or
ugly.”

However, only smaller primates ~—
the ones most often sold as pets and
used in laboratory experiments -~
will be accepted. “Everybody has to
know their limit, and ours stops at
macaques," she said. Male macaques
can reach 40 to 60 pounds, she said.

Said Tim Goodale: “There are cer-
tain monkeys we don’t feel we can
take: those used in AIDS and commu-

nicable disease testing. It’s too much
of a risk to the other monkeys.”

The Goodales abhor the use of pri-
mates in lab experiments. But both
are in the medical field and say they
realize that animalssometimes are
needed for research. Tim Goodale
works in drug and alcohol rehabilita-
tion at the DePaul Hospital CareUnit;
Robin Goodale is finishing up nursing
school

“The testing is fine, as long as it’s
done humanely, and the monkeys are
taken care of afterward,” 'i'im Goo
dale said. “That's why we're in. .t i

 

for con wrote and individual sponsor»
ship. Our work will continue because
monkey research continues.”

The household food bill already is
high. he said, especially with the ex‘
pensive diet of fresh fruit, vegetables
and Monkey Chow required for the
monkeys. “At times, they eat better
than we,” he said.

“We give them Cheerios and pret-
zels and wheat rolls to get their
grains,” Robin Goodale said. “They
like bagels, too.”

There also are the usual, and some-
times unusual, medical bills.

“George'had to have biaces to
keep his smile," Tim Goodale said of
an 8-year-old cinnamon-tailed capu-
chin. “He had to have his canines
removed, and the other teeth would
have become crooked. That cost
$290.”

The Goodales have a wildlife
breeder permit. A St. Peters zoning
official said they apparently were vi-
olating no laws as long as the opera
tion was not a public nuisance and
was not for exhibition or commercial
purposes.

Robin Goodale said their neighbors
had no gripes, either. “The monkeys
don’t make any noise, and we don’t
have peOple in,” she said. “We try to
be discreet.”




THE PHOENIX GAZETTE - March 25,

JEFFREY HART

 

 

OK, let’s save the whales

ith a few honorable exceptions,

such as Theodore Roosevelt and

former Senator James Buckley,

American conservatives have not
been notable in the ranks of those of
linguistically close description: conserva-
tionists.

Conservatives see something genuinely
sinister in some of the environmental
factions, like Greenpeace and the Sierra
Club, a utOpianism that does not deal in
necessary trade—offs «— between, say, some
ugly medical research with monkeys and
the possibility of curing cancer. (Admit-
tedly there is frivolous and cruel labora-
tory use of animals.)

But as far as this conservative is
concerned, the Japanese are pulling a fast
one and should be called to strict account
and made to obey the international
agreements they have in fact signed.

Under the terms of the International
Whaling Agreement, to which Japan is a
signatory, Commerce Secretary William
C. Verity, Jr. has now declared Japan in
violation. A Japanese whaling fleet in the
Antarctic is in the process of slaughtering

300 Minke whales for alleged "research”
purposes.

However, the whale meat will be sold
commercially to support the "research.”
If you buy that, you will buy Mount Fuji.
The Japanese like to eat whale meat, and
the expedition is a commercial one. The
Japanese rationale that the research is
necessary, to study the Minke replace-
ment rate is just a lot of Sushi.

According to the whaling accords, once
Verity has declared the Japanese in
violation, President Reagan has 60 days
to tell Congress what he is going to do
about it. If he plans to do nothing, he is
required to tell Congress why.

Japanese ﬁshing rights in US. waters
could be restricted or eliminated, but
since they are minimal and constantly
violated anyway, his is not much of a
sanction. We could close US. markets to
Japanese fish products. The trouble there
is that the fishing industry is one of the
few in which we have a favorable trade
balance with Japan.

But this in nit~picking The Japanese in
fact are tremendously sensitive to bad
publicity m “saving face.” And some of

them know on what fragile foundations
their prosperity is based. Fisheries Minis-
ter Sato has said that if criticism becomes
accelerated, "we will reconsider our
decision at that stage.”

The International Whaling Commission
has declared Japan in violation. Secre-
tary Verity has made the necessary
declaration to President Reagan. Let’s
"accelerate” the criticism, as Sato
phrases it. '

This conservative is entirely opposed to
Japan-bashing of the demagogic Richard
Gephardt type. Yet Gephardt is scoring
points because the Japanese have begun
to emit an aroma of arrogance in their
international dealings, and even have
made implicit claims to racial superiority.
This, while the US. Navy and US.
taxpayers protect Japanese oil-import
routes. Our own domestic investment lags
in some part because of money spent to
undergird Japan’s prosperity. In fact,
Japan would sink beneath the economic
waves within 24 hours if US. markets
were closed to their products.

Remember the sad lesson of Admiral
Yammamoto, Japan, and lay off the
whales.

Smokey is ﬂanked by (from left) attorney Ludin, plaintiff Sikorski, court coordinator Walter Cross and attorney Johnson.

THE FUR WILL BE FLYING IN PITTSBURGH
AS SMOKEY THE CAT GOES ON TRIAL
FOR FELINE-IOUS ASSAULT

The letters are addressed simply
Smokey, Wood Street, but the mailman
knowsjust where to deliver them: J.R.
Weldin Co., Pittsburgh’s oldest office-
supply store. And thereby hangs a tail.

The tail belongs to Smokey, a 17—
year-old cat who for the last eight
years has entertained patrons as he
sunned in the Weldin store window or
lounged by the cash register. But last
Oct. 19 a customer, one Nicole (Nickki)
Sikorski, 19, claimed that Smokey
scratched her: in November she filed a
$3,000 negligence suit against the
store in small-claims court.

Sikorski, a legal secretary. alleges
that Smokey came at her—not exactly

on little cat feet—when she tried to
buy tape for her boss, Richard John-
son, the attorney who’s handling the
complaint. The scratches on Sikorski’s
left hand make her look “like a heroin
addict,” says Johnson, who is asking
$1,500 in damages (for “psychological
discomfort, shock and dismay”) and
$1,500 in medical costs.

The hearing, before three arbiters, is
set to begin next week and has be—
come something of a paws celebre in
Pittsburgh. Three local lawyers have
volunteered to represent Smokey, al-
though Weldin’s attorney, Gary Ludin,
will act as counsel. The store has set
up a Smokey Defense Fund and col-

lected $2,000—not exactly kibble——
from concerned citizens. “We have in-
surance to cover this,” says the store’s
owner, Peg Brown, who insists Smokey
is innocent, “so the money will actual—
ly go to various animal charities.”

Both sides are going at the case
tooth and nail. Johnson will introduce
as evidence the four color photos tak—
en of Nickki’s hands, and he’s invoking
local ordinances against harboring an
animal in a place of business. Mean-
while, 100 people are planning to show
up as character witnesses for the de—
fendant. Will Smokey himself take the
stand? Advises his attorney: “Not un-
less he’s subpoenaed.” El

'Dogfighﬁng Becoming Rare In Go. But PitBullsRemain

By KIRK MARTIN

Though pit bull terriers are com-
mon and get increasing attention
for their violent attacks on hu-
mans, .the dogﬁghting they were
broil for is becoming rare in Geor~
git. '

iStricter laws, more energetic en-
forcement and stiff prison sen-
tences haVe discouraged the sport
in Georgia and have driven its
enthusiasts out, of state, ltperts
say.

“And to a degree it’s also driven
it underground,” said Marc Paul-
hus, southeastern director of the
Humane Society of the United

 

 

Paulhus credits the Georgia Bu-
reau of Investigation with the suc-
case.

“I have never encountered a
state police agency that has gone
aﬁer dogﬁghting with the fervor of
the G31, ” he said. “The GBI
stands out, and I think they stand
out nationally.”

Pit bulls, bred through genera-
tions to enhance their fierceness in
arranged ﬁghts, have gained a
reputation in DeKalb and else-
where- for their attacks on the
unsuspecting, including the fatal
mauling of a 2-year-old Stone
Mountain boy last month.

been prosecuted in the past as a
result of dog attacks on humans,
DeKalb Assistant District Attor-
ney John Petrey said no investiga-
tion out of his ofﬁce has focused on
dogﬁghting.

Pit bulls remain in circulation
and their dangerous nature has
survived through a sort of “trickle
down” effect, Petrey said. “Owners
are unwittingly perpetuating these
qualities.”

A ban on the breed would not be
practical, but “the most dangerous
dog is the fight-bred pit. bull,”
Paulhus said, comparing the dog’s
attack to a shark’s feeding frenzy.

groundwork for the crachdown on
dogfighting was done earlier' 1n the
decade when the GBI made a ser-
ies of raids to dacument the pres
ence of the sport in the stube and
its horrors for the Georgia é um :..

sumably a loser, tossed into the

wounds. Another oowered in shock

 

completely chewed away.

That effort led to the passage of
laws making dogﬁghting a felony
bringing up to five years in prison
and fines up to 85, 000 in Georgia, 2
Paulhus said. Bht the real payoff

ilan And Two Elephants.
Elude The Grasp Of Law

1988. New York Daily News .

NEW YORK -- Somewhere'in the
~'ilds of North America, Arlan Seidon
,4 hiding out with two 7-ton pachy-
.erms named Tory and Duchess.

Seidon. a circus'animal trainer has
teen sought by the New Jersey state

police for four years, ever since he.

ignored a court order to return the
elephants to their owners.

But Seidon‘s daughter, Robin, says
he will not give the elephants back
because he believes that they were
abused by the owners. .

Robin Seidon, who lives in Manhat-
tan, says that her father calls her ev~
ery few weeks but neversays where
no is. “It’s not easy hiding out with a
:ouple of elephants, but my father is
a very determined man when he be-
ieves in something. I guess you could
ay he is a little eccentric."

The elephant tale began in 198.}.
when Arlan Seidon sold two Indian
elephants he had raised from infancy
3 Richard Drake and his son, Ed-
ward. for $74,000. The Drakes, who
.ewn an exotic animal ranch in Te-
hachapi. Calif.. planned to rent out

the elephants for television commer- ,

cials and circus acts.
According to court records. the
Drakes paid SSUiidl.‘ and agreed to’

pay the balance in monthly install-’

ments of $1.700. Ten months after the
sale. the Drakes had fallen behind
five months in payments.

In 1982.. Edward Drake said. he
was taking the elephants from Cali—

fornia to New York for a television .

:omrner cial As a favor he said he
agreed. to pick up Seidon at his home
in Fordland. :vi ant. . and drive him to
a Circus in North Carolina after stop-
ping in New York.‘ . -

Bts? Drake-said that while he was
asleet i at a mot ei in Pennsylvania
Seid Ill fird with the trailer and the
elephants

Seidon s lawyer, Isabelle Strauss,
maintains that her client repossessed
the elephants legally because of non-
payment and took them to a ranch in

Colts Neck, NJ. There, she said, Sei-
don discovered that the elephants
had hook boils. wounds caused when
hooks used in training had pierced
their hides.

She said Seidon had then refused to
give the elephants back — even if he
were paid what he was owed -— and
the Drakes sued. They denied that
they had abused the elephants ‘It
was all a lie Seidon made up in an
attempt to get his elephants back.’

- Edward Drake said

Superior Court Judge Peter
Thomas of Monmouth County, N. I.
ruled in 1984 that the elephants be-
longed to the Drakes. That decision is
being appealed. Instead of returning
the animals, Seidon fled, and he
hasn’t been seen since.

Robin Seidon says her father’s only
concern is the welfare of the ele-
phants.

Tigers owner. takes
cubs under his wing

Tom Monaghan has rewritten the story of the three bears.
The millionaire owner of the Detroit Tigers and Domino’s Pizza
adopted three black bear cubs Thursday.
A hunter who killed the cubs’ mother last month claimed self-
defense, but has been charged with killing a bear out of season.
The two males and fe-i
male, weighing between I
71/2 and 8 pounds, were;
rescued from a telephone 2
booth outside Grayhng.
Mich., March 24 after an
anonymous phone tip to
wildlife omcials.
Monaghan credits wife
Marge with the idea of ‘
taking the cubs. “She
loves the little things,” he ‘
says. Last winter, she ,
rode with natural re-f
sources agents who
tagged cubs. i
Monaghan, 51, knows i
what being orphaned is .
like: He grew up in a 1

his father died. ;
The 2-month-old cubs ‘
— spending today in their new home, Domino’s retreat on Drum-

soon. ?
They’re ready to be weaned from sow’s milk, which wildlife ;
specialists have provided because pigs are their nearest domesti- '
cated relatives, says biologist Joe Rogers of Michigan’s Wildlife
Recovery Association. ‘
A natural habitat for the bears will be built at the lodge.
Names haven’t been selected yet “Maybe we should name

Star animal trainer

makes sure felines
know their lines

By MICHAEL D. DUNN
Tribune Staff Writer

TAMPA —— Bryan Renfro knows the queasy
excitement of meeting a major motion-picture
star.

When asked if he would be interested in
working with a sandy-haired actor that just
happens to be one of the world’s top box-office
stars, he nearly dropped the telephone.

Of course he’d be interested in working
with Benji! -

A lot of big-name movie stars are tempera- ~

mental and self-important, Renfro said, but not
Benji. He’s one of the nicest dogs you’d ever
want to meet.

Renfro met Benji a couple of years ago
when Frank Inn, the celebrated canine’s train-
er, asked if he would like to help prepare the
dog for a starring role in “Benji the Hunted,” a
movie released last year.

Renfro has 15 years’ experience as an ani-
mal trainer for television and movies. He has
trained animals for films such as “Gremlins”
and .“Ruthless People” and TV shows such as
“Highway to Heaven” and “Here’s Boomer.”

Currently he’s teaching cats how to act in a
new NBC-TV series called “Aaron’s Way.”

 

As a matter of fact, he said, cats have be-
come a big part of his life lately. He was in
Tampa earlier this week promoting a nation-
wide contest to find the “Friskiest Cat in Amer-

-ica”

One of the amazing aspects of cats, Renfro
said, is that they teach people almost as much
as people teach them.

“Cats train people so easily,” be said. “They
have their people trained to feed them when-
ever they want, to let them in and out when-
ever they want. They’re intelligent.”

Animals learn in essentially the same way
people do, he said.

“it’s an individual thing. Just like people,
some animals learn faster than others. Even in
the same litter of puppies, some will learn
quickly and some won’t,” he said.

“Everybody asks which is easier to train,
cats or dogs. But they’re two different types of
animals, so you can’t really say one is harder
than the other,” he said. “The process I use is
patience, love and reward.”

For instance, when Renfro is working with
Teddy Brown, one of the feline stars of “Aar-
on’s Way,” he reaches into his coat pocket and
pulls out a piece of dry cat food as a reward
for good behavior.

“My wife gets upset when I put canned cat
food in my pockets,” he quipped. “There’s two
ways to train, negative and positive. We prefer
the positive (reward method). It keeps the ani-
mal much happier.”

Most pets can be trained to obey simple
rules, but owners must make a sustained'effort,
he said.

“Some people get frustrated because they 1

want their dog to be at Benji’s level in a week.
But Benji has 10 years of training,” he said. “If
people would begin training their dog or cat as
soon as they get them, it would eliminate 99
percent of the problems they’ll face in the fu- '
ture.” '

Cats and dogs aren’t the only animals to
experience fRenfro’s magic touch — he said he
also taught two rats to play basketball.

Renfro said animals probably always will
be popular on the silver screen and on televi-
sion because of their enormous appeal to peo-
ple.

“People are very much in love with ani-
mals, and they always have been,” ‘he said.

“Look at Rin Tin Tin and Lassie, Boomer and V

Benji. And look at all the things (Walt) Disney *
has done.”

Or as Benji so eloquently put it: “Arf, arf.
Errrrr. Arf.”

NEW YORK TIMES - April 2, 1988

Sisters Under the Skin

 

By Yona Zeldis McDonough

It's the beginning of April —- time to
put my fur coat into storage. ['1] be
sorry to part with the sleek brown
beaver that has kept me warm all
winter. The end of the season has
made me think about the past winter,
my first as a fur owner, and some un-
usual experiences.

For example, as I walked along
57th Street in Manhattan,- a woman
hissed, “A lot of animals were tor-
tured to make that coat!” I was sur-
prised, not by her sentiment, which I
understood and even respected, but
by her need to express it, unsolicited,
in public. In the following weeks, I dis—
covered that my outspoken critic was
not alone and that some of her com-
patriots were even more unabashed
in proclaiming their views. One
woman Shouted: "Bloody fur! Shame
on you!” Like it or not, I realized 1
was going to have to defend my coat
against detractors. .

I understand the arguments
against wearing fur and have decided
to wear one anyway. Not only does fur
solve, more efficiently than any other
substance known to man, the need for
warmth, it hasalso been with us for
hundreds if not thousands of years.

Since I eat meat, .I find the distinc-
tion between wearing and eating arbi-
trary. Animals don’t care whether
their flesh is consumed or their skins
are worn; the point is, they have died
and we have killed them. This may
sound cruel, but it is honest.

 

 

Yona Zeldis McDonough writes short
fiction.

I would like to ask those women
whovkeep shouting at me just how
consistent they are. What about wea r-
ing leather and suede? Animals must
be killed for those skins, too. Do all
these women wear only sneakers and
carry canvas bags?

What is even more offensive than
the opinions is the rudeness with
which they are expressed. Didn’t the
mothers of these women tell them
that shouting at strangers shows an
appalling lack of manners? Or has
their love of animals so clouded their
minds that they have become wholly
insensitive to the feelings of others?
It seems ironic that the champions of
animal rights show so little regard
for human rights.

What do these women think they
are accomplishing by these attacks?
Do they really believe that I am going
to be suddenly converted, and toss my
fur into the flames? What ignorance
and na’iveté!

0n the contrary, their anti-fur cam-
paign has made me more entrenched
in my own position: I am determined

 

Why all

.- I

to continue wearing, and delighting
in, my fur. If I had the money, I ’d buy
another — maybe a sumptuous mink
or a full-length sable.

No man has publicly upbraided me
for wearing a fur coat. Why? I have
some thoughts on this (which are not
substantiated by research or study).

My furrier told me that the average
age at which a woman picked out a
mink used to be 55, and her husband
footed the bill. Now, the average fur
buyer is 35 and purchases the coat
herself. This seems to confirm a shift
in the status of women.

Women have more buying power
these days. They are more likely to
have well paying jobs in traditionally
male fields like law, business and
medicine than ever before. They
work hard and know how to reward
themselves: a fur coat is one way to
dothat

Everything considered, I can’t help
but feel there’s a sub rosa feminist
issue lurking here. Haven’t we
learned something from our enor-
mous struggle for equality? Must
women resort to brutish tactics to get
their point across? Hasn’t every
woman burned at the leering re-
marks offered by some man as she
passed him in the street? Must she
now be harangued by a woman — a
sister, under the skin, so to speak —-
for a coat she’s probably bought her-
self with money that would have been
nearly impossible to earn 40 or even
20 years ago?

Verbal abuse was once something
that men used against women in pub—
lic to assert anger and their power.
Shouldn’t we, as women, have found a
better way to express ours? [I]

Catching the wolves in the wild has
sometimes often been an arduous un—
dertaking, he said, but catching them in
their 100-foot-square pens, as another
part of the. preparations, has its own
drama. Mr. Phillips and Warren T.
Parker, coordinator of the recovery
project, directed a team of four care-
takers and a veterinarian last week as
they fanned out with nets and snatch
poles in the pen, trying to capture two
skittish red wolves who raced lightly
over the mud and the tumbled and rot-
ting‘tree stumps of the pen.

Learning to Be Intolerant

That in itself was a good sign of the
wolves increasing intolerance of man,
said Mr. Phillips, who noted that early
in their acclimation, the animals would.
simply cower and give up when cor-
nered. After an animal was caught in a
net and tranquilized, Dr. Paul Cooper
would work quickly to make an‘ inch-
long incision for a radioactive implant
and suture it. The process was com-
pleted in about 30 minutes just as the
tranquilizer was weariig off.

The implant will be used to help iden-
tify the droppings of the animals after
matey are released so they can be exam-
'ined to analyze the wolves’ diet. Analy-
sis of the droppings of the animals al-
ready in the wild has shown that they
are managing to stalk and catch their
food and are not scavenging among the
trash cans of Manns Harbor or at a
inearby landfill, said Mr. Parker.

Mr. Taylor said the high—technology
techniques had not always worked. One

such failure was last fall with treeo
wolves wearing collars that weregsup-
posed to release tranquilizing darts
into the animals’ necks at the direction
of a remote-controlled radio signal.

“It was'a complex problem with the
software,” he said, “and so now we
have to track them, catch them and
then tranquilize them.”

Early Disappointment

Another disappointment, said Mr.
Phillips, was the fact that none of the
animals became pregnant while i the
acclimation pens awaiting release. Nor
were there radio monitoring data on
the two females in the wild suggesting
that they had slowed their activity in
preparation for'the birth of pups.

“Some of the wolves are going to die
because mortality is a fact of life in the
wild,” said Mr. Phillips, explaining that
wolves living to be eight to 10 years old
in captivity will probably not last more
than four to five years in the wild. “We
are hoping to get two good breeding

 

seasons out of those we release and the

real test will be to see if that first litter
born in the wild survives and repro-
duces itself. A group of 25 to 30 red
wolves here would mean complete suc-
cess.” '

Introducing the wolves into the area
caused some controversy initially, said
Mr. Parker, especially among hunters
who had used the four-year-old pre-

serve for hunting with chase dogs.

But the Fish and Wildlife Service re-

laxed their usual rules at Alligator

River, only slightly limiting the hunting
areas and exempting from prosecution
any hunter who accidentally kills a red
wolf and reports it within 24 hours.
According to Mr. Phillips and others,
the accommodation is helping to prove
that restoration of endangered species
can be done practically.

“There are all kinds of arguments
for doing this and they include the legal
one that we are required to under the
endangered species law, the moral one
that we have an obligation to conserve
and restore and the scientific one that
we can learn a lot,” said Mr. Phillips.
“1 would add that we should do it be-
cause we are proving that We can do it.
We are losing our biological diversity
with the endangering of each species ,
and it’s like removing spokes from a
wheel. Pretty soon the wheel col-i
lapses.” ' -

Raising to Train the I m periled Red Wolf to Survive in the Wild

 

By RONALD SMOTHERS OWM ,0 .

Special to The New York Times

MANNS HARBOR, N.C., April 1 —-
Deep in the Alligator River National
Wildlife Refuge, four red wolves are
isolated in pens as part. of an ambitious
project to restore one of the continent’s
most endangered species to the wild.

The project, begun last fall by the
United States Fish and Wildlife Serv—
ice, is proving itself and disproving the
literary conceit of another North Caro-
linian, the author Thomas Wolfe, said
John Taylor, manager of the wildlife
preserve.

“You can go home again,” said Mr.
Taylor. “That ’s a good way to put it.”

The four wolves being held at the

‘ preserve are among about 80 remain—
iiig in captivity from a species that
once roamed the Southeast by the hun-
dreds of thousands. They succumbed to
competition with man for food and
territory, but only after decades in
which their relentless forays put boun—
ties on their heads and created a vil-
lainous mythology in which the wolves’

Limousines are not just for the rich
and famous, says Valerie Watt: They
are also for her and Cocoa, her Labra—
dor retriever guide dog.

At the urging of the blind woman
from Pompano Beach, the Broward
County State Attorney’s office filed
charges on Wednesday against two lim-
ousine operators she says did not agree.

In December, the operators hiked
their prices or refused to take her to
Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood Interna-
tional Airport when told that Cocoa also
would be coming, Watt says.

“They really have a lot of nerve,”
Watt, 24, said on Thursday. “They don’t
care. They just think people who are
disabled aren’t going to make a fuss.”

State law makes it illegal to deny the
disabled full access to public facilities,
including carriers, said David Strauss,
an assistant state attorney handling the
case.

Misdemeanor charges now face Tony
Desanti Jr., owner of Broward Limou-
sine and Airport Service in Margate.
and Philip Dimaria, owner of Broward
Airport Services in Fort Lauderdale. If

convicted, they face 60 days in jail or
$500 in fines.

’att, who receives her bachelor s de-
gree in social work from Florida Atlanc
tic University next month, has had Co-
coa since an eye disease blinded her six
years ago.

She had called the limousine services
while planning a vacation to Oregon for
her and a Pompano couple from whom
she rents a room.

The companies originally quoted
prices of $30, but raised them as high as
$69 when told about Cocoa, she said.
Airport Services insisted that the guide
dog be caged while Broward Limousine

7

later refused to transport the dog.

Robert Desanti, son of the owner of
Broward Limousine, denied any wrong-
doing. The company had hauled Watt
and Cocoa several times without a cage
or a problem, he said. Higher prices are
standard for a party of three with lug-

gage.
“I don’t think this is fair," Desanti
said. “We‘re not here to rob anybody.”

The company may have demanded a
cage because it is not wise to "put a dog
in a stretch limo, a $55,000 vehicle. with
fleas, nails and saliva," Desanti said.

Watt said guide dogs are “trained to
be very quiet and mellow.”

Demaria declined to comment.

Once roads are built, the land can never be considered
for protection as wilderness. Logging ruins wildlife habi-
tat and degrades water quality, conservationists say and
in dry Rocky Mountain forests, it takes more than a,cen-

tury for a new tree to grow to a diameter of six inches.

The plans do not call for an overall increase in the
rate of logging. But environmentalists say that since so
many prime areas have already been cut, more roads,
and thus more damage, are required for the same yields.

At the same time, the Forest Service loses more than
half a billion dollars a year on timber sales —— in effect
subsidizing the timber industry —- because building and
maintaining the roads often costs more than the logging
companies pay.

The Forest Service says the expenditures benefit
users other than timber companies. But the Office of
Management and Budget, which estimates that the Gov-
ernment lost $600 million on timber sales in the 1985 fis-
cal year, has called the practice “overextended and mis-
directed.”

According to Ms. Sheldon, in some areas the Govern-

ment receives less than 10 cents for,

every dollar it spends for roads and!

other costs. The Wilderness Society
says the worst case is the Tongass Na-
tional Forest in Alaska, where, it esti—
mates, the return is two cents on the
dollar.

The clash over the forests is being
played out in 14 separate appeals of
the plan for the Gallatin, just north of
Yellowstone Park. Forty percent of
the forest is designated wilderness.
But the 10-year plan calls for building
or reconstructing 350 miles of roads
and would make a total of 18 percent
of the forest available for logging.

In documents filed in February,
an alliance of conservation groups
called the Greater Yellowstone Coali-
tion said the Gallatin’s beauty, recrea-
tional value, proximity to Yellowstone
and variety of wildlife — especially
the imperiled grizzly bear — should
weigh more heavily than mining, oil
and gas and especially timber.

“They’re actually spending tax-
payer money to destroy the wilder-
ness values right next to Yellowstone
Park,” said Michael Scott, director of
the Bozeman office of the Wilderness
Society, which has joined the Greater
Yellowstone Coalition. “It’s crazy.”

By the Wilderness Society’s

analysis, the Gallatin will lose up to $4 million a year on

timber. But the forest’s deputy supervisor, Ken Galick,_ "

argues that forest sales should not be evaluated just on
their return to the Treasury. “It depends on what kind of

accounting system you keep,” he said. “Yes could argue‘
these sales have a positive impact on society.” He said ~

that logging jobs created “community stability,” that
clear-cutting improved wildlife habitat and that roads
expanded recreation opportunities. .

Survivor Tells of A Miracle Rescue at Sea

In an amazing escape from death, three men tossed into
shark-infested seas when their boat collapsed were saved
by 10 dolphins — which not only guided the men to
share, but even fought off attacking sharks! Eyewit-
nesses on shore, using binoculars, confirmed that the
dolphins surrounded the men following the January 6
boot accident off South Africa's east coast. "It was truly
amazing," said witness Nigel Fairhead, 41, owner of a

It was uncanny the way
those dolphins just ap-

right after my two pals

and I realized with a
sense of awe that they
were forming a protec-

It was as if they’d been
watching us and knew we
had no chance of survival in
that storm-churned, shark-
infested water without their
help.

We had guardian angels

saw they were dolphins, re-
lief swept over me.

The dolphins were making high-pitched
squealing noises as if they were talking to each
other — like they were saying, “..,OK I’ve got my
eye on this one. What’s that one going to do
next?”

I was still holding on to a rope dangling from
the catamaran. Suddenly a big wave caused the
boat to shoot away, dragging me with it. I hung
on for dear life as I was dragged about 300 yards
—— and four of the dolphins broke away from the
pack around my pals and chased after me. I man-
aged to crawl up the rape and get aboard the
boat. I was exhausted. But the boat capsized
again and I was thrown back into the water.

I was so dazed and tired I felt like giving up
and letting death take me. But one dolphin imme-
diately put its nose under my backside and
started pushing me toward the boat!

It was an amazing feeling —— as if some giant
hand were picking me up and lifting me along.
The dolphin pushed me right to the boat, and I
began dragging myself aboard.

Then I saw two other fins cutting through I

the water nearby. Sharks! My body quaked with
fear. “Don’t let me die like this,” I prayed.
Then to my amazement I saw three of the
dolphins go after the two sharks ——-while the
fourth dolphin stayed behind with me, so close I

By now I had drifted so far from shore, and
the waves were so rough, that I couldn’t see the
beach. Suddenly the dolphins began squealing
and swimming together in one direction. I real-
ized they were showing me the way to shore!

I began swimming along with the dolphins,
pushing my boat ahead of me. But I was scared
because I’d cut my leg and nothing attracts
sharks like the scent of blood.

Every now and then one of the four dolphins
would break away from the pack and return
about five minutes later, making sounds like it
was communicating with the others. It sounds
crazy, but I think that dolphin was out patrolling
for sharks, then reporting back to his friends.

I kept moving through the water. After what
seemed like an eternity I finally spotted the
shore. Waves sweeping toward the beach carried
me close, then some people waded out and helped
me to the beach.

There, I learned that Roger and Terry were

Parks plan seeks to solve
urban Wildlife problems

By Drew Digby
Denver Post Staff Writer

Denver has too many beaver,
buffalo and geese, and it plans to
do something about it.

Until this year. the city parks
and recreation department has
handled such urban wildlife prob—
lems individually as each case
arose. But the agency’s new
managers are developing a plan
to finally deal with Denver’s lon-
ger-term animal woes.

Denver will trap some beaver,
sell a few buffalo and try to truck
aw. y some geese, said Carolyn
Et'er, who with husband, Don.
manages parks and recreation.

But, she added. “We have an
opportunity to allow people here
to have experiences with wild-
life."

The opportunity, she noted.
must be balanced so animals do
not get. everything their way to
the detriment of humans.

Beavers are a good example of
the sort of balances the parks
plan will try to strike between
human and animal needs. Al-
though cute and lovable to some
people. to others beaver are dan-

Buffalo also are posing prob-
lems for Denver, which has two
herds in its Daniels and Genesee
mountain parks. Because the
natural dangers for bison are re-
duced. their numbers grow so

fast that the city each year must

mals, which generally are pur-
chased to breed and start other
herds elsewhere. The city will
auction 23 buffalo April 19 at
Daniels Park.

In other city parks, geese and
their droppings are the big wild-
life headache. The problem —
made worse by fowl lovers who
have so pampered the birds by
feeding them that they no longer
migrate - has gotten so bad that
some city lakes must be dredged
just. to eliminate geese drop-
pings.

Although the city tries to get
rid of them, the geese quickly
are replaced by birds from near-
by communities. said Amy Pul-
ver, parks department spokes-
woman.

“We don’t live in the kind of
place where there are fences at
the city limits."

livelihood. And the latest threat from
Europe could devastate Canada’s re-
maining fur industry and the aborigi-
nal communities it supports. Wild furs
generate about $100 million in sales
annually, and native leaders have as-
sailed Clark’s initiative, calling it
nothing short of “cultural genocide.”

and the Soviet Union’s, where fur
trapping is a major industry. And last
week Denmark ﬁled a formal com-
plaint with the EC against the British
proposal. Still, Seligman underscored
his convictions on March 3 in his pub-
licity outing on the ice ﬁoes three
miles off Prince Edward Island. Selig-

man and five other members of

the European parliament
joined Swit to frolic with baby

the International Fund for Ani-
mal Welfare videotaped their
adventure to promote its anti-
fur campaign in Europe. In an
emotional display, Swit knelt
down beside one of the baby
seals, embraced it and sang a
chorus of You Must Have Been
a Beautiful Baby.

The broad campaign against
the Canadian wild-fur industry
comes at a critical time. The
value of wild furs harvested in
Canada is growing at a rate of
about 20 per cent a year. Late
last month Hudson’s Bay Fur

major auction house, staged
one of the largest fur sales in

in Britain and has focused public
opinion on the trapping issue. On
Feb. 4 British Minister for Trade
Alan Clark said that his government
would likely force retailers to label
some wild-fur products, including
. coyote, lynx and wolf, with the warn-
ing “Includes fur from animals com-
monly caught by means of a leg-hold
.trapf’ -

‘ Earlier this month, while represent-
' atives from Canada’s fur industry
vowed to lobby against Clark’s pro-
' posal, a group of animal rights activ-
ists, including American actress Lo-
retta Swit, travelled to the ice ﬂoes
oﬁ' Prince Edward Island. Their ac-
tivities were ﬁlmed, and they will be
used in a campaign against the fur
industry. And last week Madron Se-
ligman, a member of the European
parliament who accompanied Swit,
said: “We will seek a ban on imports
of wild furs. The issue is cruelty to
animals.”

Six years ago a European Communi-
ty (EC) ban on seal imports almost de-
stroyed the Canadian sealing industry,
in the process depriving many north-
ern Inuit communities of their main

 

Thomas Coon, a Quebec Cree and co-
chairman of Indigenous Survival In-
ternational, told Clark in London last
month that the minister’s plan, “un-
like the seal ban, not only targets Inuit
communities but includes aboriginal
people throughout Canada.”

Native and fur-industry leaders have
expressed particular concern that the
campaign against the leg—hold trap
will gather momentum in Europe and
result in a general ban on all fur prod-
ucts. Currently, wild fur is extremely
popular in many European countries
and is used extensively in sportswear.
It is sought after for its rich colors and
asilkiness that does not occur in pelts
from ranch—raised animals. But Cana-
da’s largest wild-fur customers in Eu-
rope are Switzerland and Germany,
and both have strong lobbies that pro-
mote animal rights. Said Seligman,
who also serves as chairman of the
EC’s Parliamentary Intergroup on Ani-
mal Welfare: “We in the EC will soon
be seeking labelling similar to Brit-
ain’s regarding leg traps.”

Seligman’s proposal has met with
protests from numerous governments,
including Canada’s, the United States’

 

 

through more humane meth-
ods, including padded traps or spring-
loaded devices that suffocate their vic—
tims. Said Donald McCrea, a Métis
trapper from Cowan, Man.: “It is dis-
couraging, just when we have gained
ground in humane trapping, to have
this happen.”

Still, the Canadian fur industry does
have some friends in London. Last
month an article in Britain’s widely
circulated humor magazine Punch
asked whether the next step in the
battle over animal rights might come
when sweaters suddenly appear on
store shelves bearing labels that warn
“This sheep was damn cold without
this wool.”

Fur retailers say that they fear that,
despite such support, the impact of
tags bearing the leg-hold warning will
be irreversible. Said a London shopper
at the upscale Harrod’s clothing store,
where one coyote and fox coat was sell-
ing for $17,900: “I would ﬁnd it hard to
wear a coat with a clear conscience
with a label like that.”

I've never seen a more disgusted-
1ooking basset hound.

PROVING A PROFESSOR’S PET THEORY,
SHEBA THE CHIMP IS TREATING
A BASSET HOUND AS HER OWN DOG

It’s a typical girl-and-her-dog story.
Whenever the 6-year-old sees her pet
basset hound, she jumps up and down
in glee. She hugs the dog, toys with
its floppy ears, then begins swatting at
it playfully, getting the pooch to dash
away, bark, then come back for anoth-
er swipe. Each time the dog returns,
the 6—year-old pulls her lips back over
her teeth and grins with satisfaction.
No, her smile isn’t unusually wide—
not for a chimpanzee. Sheba, the
60—lb., 3V2’-tall 6-year-old, belongs
to a primate cognition project at Ohio
State University. Part of her program——
which is being conducted by associate
psychology professor Sally Boysen—

involves learning to choose colors, to
recognize body parts and to count
(Sheba has mastered the numbers
from zero to seven). The other part of
her program involves learning to take
care of her own pet, Skylar, a 9-month—
old basset. Skylar’s function is more
social than cerebral. Because Sheba
was raised in the home of a Columbus
Zoo volunteer for two years, she
wasn’t in a mood to learn when she
came to the project in 1984. “She was
a real princess, spoiled from all the hu-
man attention,” says Boysen, 38, who
hopes to apply her findings to help-

ing learning-disabled children. “When-
ever l challenged her with a new task,

whom she adopted, so to speak, five
months ago, helped Sheba open up. “i
got Skylar for Sheba for the same rea—
son people buy pets for children,” says
Boysen. “It’s part of the socialization
process. Sheba is in charge of the dog,
just as a human would be. She tells
Skylar what to do and where to go with
gestures and vocalizations.”

Their games will soon become more
structured. For starters, Sheba will
learn to throw a stick for Skylar to
fetch. “Having a dog is teaching Sheba
responsibility,” says Boysen. “Be—
sides, they’re as cute as hell for a kids’
book i want to write.” El

“lnstlnctively, Sheba
is extremely gentle
with Skylar,” says

the chimp’s trainer-
teacher, Sally Boysen.

Kennels’ dogs do
‘stupid tricks,’
outsmart crooks

By Sandra McIntosh
Sidﬂli'rite‘r

Ken Miller‘s dogs have made dozens of commer-
cials, and sniffed out drugs and fugitives for the po-
lice. His top dog, Magic. is a memorable star of the
“stupid pet tricks” segment of “Late Night with De.
vid Letterman."

That prize-winning golden retriever is far from
stupid. In fact. Magic is one of several canines that
have persuaded Miller. a Henry County resident.
that man’s best friend can be trained to help pay the
bills.

Miller, the owner of three kennels in the metro
area. has made a career oftraining dogs.

“I was in the restaurant business. but I didn’t en-
joy that any more.” Miller said. “When my wife and I
decided to move to Georgia. we were discussing
what to do. and I said I‘d really like to try. making a
living working with the dogs."

Miller. a burly man with an easy manner. began
training dogs when he was 13. He said he started out
just trying to teach the dogs tricks But when the
owner of the kennel where he worked after school
saw his ability with dogs. he sent Miller to school to
learn the art of obedience training. By age 17. he
was teaching obedience training to dog owners.

When Miller and his wife. Karen moved to Geor-
gia from New Jersey in 1978. Miller took up dogs as
a busmess. buying kennels in Ellenwood, Conyers
and Atlanta. entering obedience competitions. get-
ting his dogs parts in commercials and training drug
sniffing and tracking dogs.

Today. Miller said. his kennels train 700 to 800
dogs a year, and his personal pack of dogs has in-
creased to 16. including eight golden retrievers.

er and a King Charles spaniel.

Magic. his first and most successful dog. has won

into the Golden Retriever Hall of Fame. Miller said.

commercials. and in February won fame on Letter-
man‘s show.

Miller said friends had been trying to talk him
into auditioning a dog for the Letterman show for
years. However, “none of the things my dogs did
were dumb.” Then one day. Miller saw Magic press
her face against a window pane when he walked
past, prompting him to burst out laughing.

“She really did look stupid. with her nose
pressed up against the glass." Miller said. Magic now
does the trick on the command of “make a face.
Magic. make a face."

There is also a serious side to Miller‘s work with
dogs. He said one of his favorite duties was using his
dogs to track criminal suspects and find crack
houses. A lieutenant in the Fulton Cc-unty Sheriffs
Department's Posse. a volunteer organization that
assists the sheriffs and police departments, Miller
used his dogs to track escaped criminals. hunt in-
jured or lost people and raid drug houses.

li‘liiler was forced to quit the tracking activities
in January because a foot probiem made it impossi-
ble to follow the dogs, but he said surgery this fall
should correct the problem and put him back on the
trail. “One of my favorite things is putting drug
pushers in jail." Miller said.

A Reasoned View of Animal Experiments

Dr. Jane Goodall, famed for her stud-
ies of chimpanzees at Tanzania’s Gombe
National Parks, poses a startling question:

“Can you imagine putting two 2-year-
old human infants into a container that is
22 inches by 22 inches and two-foot high?"

The image of two toddlers in a pen
scarcely the size of a grocery cart horri-
fies, but Goodall says it aptly illustrates
what goes on in some research facilities in
the United States and other nations.

She has seen young chimps crammed
in such cages, though “there isn’t any dif-
ference between a preverbal human child
and a chimpanzee” in their awareness and
“need for love and affection.”

Goodall would prohibit such cruelty
but she would not prohibit the use of ani-
mals in research. Her mother is alive to-
day because surgeons placed a pig valve in
her heart, so Goodall understands that ani-
mals must be sacrificed for medicine. She
also knows her beloved chimpanzees are
essential to AIDS studies since only large
primates carry the AIDS virus in their
blood (though the chimpanzees have not,
as yet, developed AIDS).

But Goodall — who visited the Tampa

TAMPA T

RIBUNE ~ April 7, 1988

Bay region this week for a lecture and to
tour, with delight, the new Lowry Park Zoo
—-— rightly believes research is not threat-
ened by requiring animals to be humanely
treated.

Alas, the medical community and gov-
ernment regulators have been reluctant to
address Goodall’s reasonable concerns.
The National Institutes of Health last year
rejected her request that a conference be
held to establish standards for the treat-
ment of research chimps. Goodall held her
own.

The Animal Welfare Amendment Act
passed by Congress in 1986 charged the
US. Department of Agriculture with devel-
oping standards on the “psychological”
welfare of animals in laboratories, ad-
dressing such factors as the animals’ need
for companionship. But the department
has dawdled, many suspect because of
pressure from the biomedical industry.

Such resistance to reasonable safe-
guards is as reproachable as those frantic
campaigns to stopall research using ani-
mals. In fact, the biomedical industry has
adopted some of the animal-rights radi-

cals’ histrionics, acting as if providing de~
cent-sized cages or exercising animals
would halt medical progress.

Some research companies are even us-
ing the AIDS scare to‘push the US. govern-
ment to allow the use of wild chimpanzees
in experiments, currently prohibited. The
unjustified measure would doom the
gravely endangered chimpanzees.

Goodall’s recommendations —- bigger
cages, better-trained attendants, taking
care that experiments are not done unless
necessary —— may increase laboratory
costs, but they should also enhance results.

A chimp, for instance, that is isolated
and confined in a tiny cage becomes psy-
chotic —— hardly a normal specimen. As
Goodall points out, “Stress affects the im-
mune system; it seems obvious that it
would skew any results.”

In any event, there is more to the mat-
ter than results. Goodall is usefully re-
minding researchers and society as well
that no undertaking is so great that it justi-
fies forsaking ethical reSponsibilities.

SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER - April 17, 1988

Why Gentle ‘Killer Whales’
Turn on Their Trainers

 

BY ROBERT REINHOLD

 

San Diego
f killer whales could com-
municate with humans, as
some experts believe they
may someday, four of the
whales here might give answers
to some profound questions:

Why did they turn on two of their
trainers, nearly killing them?

Are highly intelligent ocean crea-
tures like these happy spending their
lives in a big tank doing stunts for
human audiences?

Does the human species have the
right to confine them for entertain—
ment and profit, or even for research?

Such are the questions that have
been swirling around Sea World, the
huge marine-life entertainment park
here, in the wake of 14 recent acci-
dents with the whales’ human trainers.
Two were seriously injured when drag-
ged under or struck by the whales,
six~ton black-and-white animals said by
some experts to be so emotionally sen-
sitive that, like humans, they get ulcers
when unhappy and depressed.

But for the corporate parent of Sea
World, Harcourt Brace J ovanovich

Inc., the publishing and insurance con~ .
glomerate based in Orlando, Fla, the
issue involves much more than the re- "

lationship between humans and ceta-
ceans. For the whales are the super-
stars of three marine theme parks that
have become the most profitable arm
of a company now desperately cash-
hungry because its debt grew to $2.7
billion last year fighting off a takeover
by Robert Maxwell, the British publish-
er.

The three top managers of the San

Diego park have been dismissed be- .
cause of the accidents. But critics ‘

charge that the ultimate blame lies
with the higher management of Har-

court, whose chairman is William J ova-
novich, for putting too much pressure
on the whales and their low-paid, inex—
perienced trainers.

Last month, Sea World began year»

’ long festivities leading to its 25th annio

versary. The park hopes to draw a re-

cord 4 million visitors this year, at

$19.95 a head for adults, $14.95 for chil-
dren. A new whale show began on
March 23. The four whales, Orky,
Corky, Shamu and Kandu, put on a
dazzling show of leaps and back flips,
waving their huge flippers on cue and
splashing the delighted crowd of 5,000
in sun-drenched Shamu Stadium.

But for now the show does not
feature bare-back riding or swim-

Seo World may
have been in
‘too big a hurry'

to get on with
the show

 

alongs as it did in the past. The eight
trainers in wet suits keep a respectful
distance at the edge of the 6million-
gallon tank.

“We were doing some very spec-
tacular things that enhanced the show
value, but we overemphasized the im-
portance of the entertainment,” said
Robert K. Gault Jr., the new president
of Sea World. “People come to see the
whales. We’ve taken a step back to
re-evaluate our safety and training.”

Despite their name, their mouthful
of frightening teeth and ferocity when
it comes to devouring salmon and
seals, killer whales are generally con-
sidered quite gentle and friendly with

humans. Many prefer to call them or-
cas, after their scientific name, Orc1-
nus orca, because the term killer whale
is misleading. No other aquarium has
reported troubles with orcas Similar to

those at Sea World.

So what happened here is puzzling.
While in the tank on March 4, 1987, a
2Lyear-old trainer, Jonathan Smith,
was hit on the back by a male orca.

 

grabbed in the jaws of another, drag-
ged down and smashed against the bot-
tom of the 40-foot-deep pool. He suffer-
ed a lacerated liver, heavy internal
bleeding and other injuries.

Smith filed suit this month, charg-
ing that the park “induced” him into
the pool, “representing to him it was
safe for him to enter the pool with
little or no training, knowing well that
killer whales have a dangerous propen-
sity for attacking, ramming, dragging
and smashing people.” The suit adds
that “he was told the animals were
gentle” at a time when the park knew
that the recent introduction of a new
aggressive male with female orcas rais-
ed the danger. His lawyer, Charles A.
Bleiler, charged that most of the train-
ers had little experience working with
animals.

About a dozen less serious inci-
dents followed, but no changes were
made either in the shows, the training
of the workers or in the handling of
the whales. Then on November 21, a
12,000—pound whale struck John Sillick,
26, while he was riding on the back of
another. He suffered a broken back,
hip, pelvis, leg and ribs and has under-
gone two operations.

The troubles at Sea World began
soon after it acquired a competing
park, Marineland in Rancho Palos
Verdes near Los Angeles, and brought
its two whales, Orky and Corky, here a
year ago. The introduction of Orky, an
aggressive male, into the Sea World
tank with females of breeding age may
have altered the social mix, experts
speculate.

Orky had a reputation for being a
little cranky, and trainers avoided go-
ing into the water with him at Marine—
land. However, at Sea World, the train-
ers immediately entered the tank with
him, said Al Pentis, a marine biologist
who has run Boy Scout programs at
Sea World. “That was a sign Sea World
was in too big a hurry,” he said.

Another factor may have been the
high turnover among the trainers.
Bleiler said many of the trainers were
young people, none of whom were re-
quired to have experience working
with animals. They earned as little as
$6.05 an hour.

 




In addition to the turnover, Dr.
Paul Spong, director of Orcalab on
Hanson Island, British Columbia, theo-
rized that the animals, which normally
cruise 50 to 100 miles a day, were stress-
ed by confinement. “Even though they
exercise, it’s like prison,” he said. “You
canlnot consider this to be a happy ani-
ma

Gault acknowledged that some of
this was possible. He said the introduc-
tion of new animals, breeding activity,
including a live birth last year, the
building of a large new tank and train
ing for new shows may have altered
the social interaction of the creatures.
“We did not have enough experienced
trainers,” he added.

As a result, Sea World has tighten-
ed its training procedures and hopes to
return trainers to the tanks within
three months. In the past, there was an
emphasis on developing a “friendship”
between animal and trainer, reward-
ing the animal for good behavior with
not only food but also affection.

he new approach, under

the new chief trainer,

Michael Scarpuzm,

avoids the issue of
whether the animals can devel-
op emotional ties to humans.
“These are animals,” he said.
“We don’t know what they are
thinking or feeling. It’s strictly
communication to train the ani—
mal.”

Why would the animal injure his
trainer? “They have moods,” said Dr.
Michael A. Bigg, an expert at the Pacif-
ic Biological Station in Nanaimo, BC.
“The trainer’s job is to know when the
animal is not in a good mood. Now and
then, they will grasp somebody in the
mouth, but it’s clearly not a serious
attempt to hurt. They are very power-
ful animals and could do a lot more
damage than they do. There is no case
of a whale ever killing a human in the
wild.”

Sea World owns a dozen killer

whales, about one-third of those held ,

in captivity worldwide, at its four

parks. According to Standard & Poor’s,
the parks contributed 28 percent of the
parent company’s profits in 1986 on
only 17 percent of its sales. New figures
are not available, but Sea World’s role
has certainly grown since Harcourt
had to sell off its magazine and school-
supply Operations in restructuring it-
self after the takeover attempt.

The episodes at Sea World have
rekindled longstanding conflicts be-

tween the marine parks and whale ad-
vocates over confining orcas.

“They are the highest evolved
creatures in the ocean,” Spong said.
“We are beginning to realize animals
have rights and the more highly evolv-
ed have more than the lower. Those
rights should include freedom, to live
freely in the ocean and manage their
own affairs. The conditions of captivi-

.ty cannot meet their social and space

needs”

Such views are elitist in Gault’s
Opinion. “They say, if you want to see
whales, go to Alaska,” he said. “Most
people cannot do that. But they can
come here by the millions. So while we
are entertaining pe0ple, they walk out
educated, too.”

 

The issue of keeping orcas in cap-
tivity has become so political that Sea
World has been thwarted legally in its
attempts to capture new whales in
their main habitats, the waters off
Alaska, British Columbia and Washing-
ton state, since the late 19705.

TAMPA -— When bored, zoo ani-
mals pick up some nasty habits.

And boredom and bad habits, zoo
curators say, can shorten life spans
and stifle breeding habits.

For instance, elephants wag their
heads

Lions, tigers and bears pace back
and forth monotonously.

Some jaguars lick their tails
ragged.

Chimpanzees, gorillas and orang—
utans pull out their arm hair and beat
their mates. They also do the “wash-
board,” a habit in which apes sit and
press their nesting material with their

animals at Lowry Park Zoological
Garden. “It looks like a lady cleaning

its increase as well, Salisbury says.

For example, Herman, a chimpan-
zee at Lowry Park, liked to spit on
people from his small cage, before he
was moved recently into the spacious
Chimpanzoo exhibit on the 22-acre
grounds.

Salisbury says he expects the spit-

 




Boomer Balls — used in many
of the world’s zoos — are made of
extremely thick, heavy-duty plastic
and are about the size of a kickball.
Some have a valve that opens and
can be filled with sand for weight.
“The animals love them,” Salisbury
says.

In the monkey night houses, zoo
workers distribute scraps of papers
and magazines, which the monkeys
like to tear up.

The chimpanzees sometimes
“read" the magazines, though Salis-
bury frowns upon pushing any an-
thropomorphic behavior on wild an-
imals.

Daily. 200 workers cast sunflow-
er seeds throughout the grounds of
the mandrills’ exhibit, to “encour-
age them to forage. They’re natural
foragers," he says.

“Browse" -— food sources such
as shoots, branches and bamboo
sticks -— is stuck into tree limbs for
monkeys and apes to use as tools.

And with browse, apes can at-
tain another type of food.

On the suggestion of monkey
and ape expert Jane Goodall, zoo
designers created a concrete artifi-
cial termite mound within the chim—
panzee exhibit, which holds pans of
mustard and jam.

Through holes in the mound. the
chimps can pass sticks and come
out with a special treat on the end
of them. In the wilds, chimpanzees
often use sticks to poke out ter-
mites, which they eat.

At the Philadelphia 200, animal
keepers sprinkle colognes such as
English Leather on the ground of

‘catnip.

Keepers there also drilled wells
into wooden blocks and filled them
with gum arabic, a sweet substance,
for the Asian squirrels. It forces
them to chew through the wood to
reach the food.

At the Bronx Zoo in New York,
keepers are big on tree-feeders.

For the giraffes, there’s a tree
with a pulley at the top, where
keepers hang branches of browse.
“It‘s hung at a height where they
have to work for it,“ says James
Doherty, curator of mammals.

At New Orleans’ Audubon Zoo,

It‘s important to keep animals

proving an animal‘s psychological
health helps them to live and breed
longer, says Karl Kranz. curator of
mammals at the 42~acre Philadel-

mals,” Kranz told The Philadelphia
Inquirer recently.

“Animals in the wild are pro-
grammed to get enough food to eat.
to avoid being eaten and to repro—
duce,“ he said. “But in captivity
they don‘t have anything to do. To-
day’s challenge is to find ways to
make life in the zoo more like the
active life they face in the wild."

But Audubon Zoo's Anderson
points out that some of the things
they do in the wild aren't very ex-
citing.

“What may appear to be bore-
dom to humans is not always bore-
dom.“ he says. “A lot of animals ——
especially the cats —— spend a lot of
their time sleeping. It’s part of their
job. They sleep in the wilds because
they don’t have to get up and move
around.

“A lot of animals, including hu-
mans. are pretty lazy."

Dear Mrs. Yarbrough:

Thank you for letting me know of your support for S. 1457,
the Pet Protection Act of 1987.

I have long been committed to proper and humane treatment of
both laboratory animals and wildlife, and I can certainly
understand your concern about the practice of pound seizure,
which may very well undermine public confidence in community
animal shelters. It is important to remember that while research
involving animals has provided us with scientific breakthroughs,
random source animals are not always appropriate for such
activities. In addition, we must not lose sight of the fact that
recent technological advances have greatly reduced the need for
many animal experiments.

As you know, Senator Ford introduced S. 1457 on June 30,
1987, at the request of former Senator Tsongas of Massachusetts.
This bill is currently pending in the Labor and Human Resources
Committee. Representative Mrazek has introduced a companion in
the House of Representatives, H.R. 778.

No action has yet been taken on these proposals, but I
nevertheless assure you that I will keep your concerns prominent
in my mind should this legislation come before me in the Senate.
Thank you again for taking the time to let me know your concerns.
I hope you will continue to keep me up to date on your opinions
regarding issues important to us all.

Dear Mrs. Yarbrough:

Thank you for letting me know of your support for my
position on legislation that would open the coastal plain of the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in northern Alaska to oil
and gas exploration and drilling.

I am well aware of the unique beauty of this portion of our
largest state, and of how critical it is to the continued .
survival of the Porcupine Caribou population, not to mention the
countless other wildlife species that make this region home. As
you may know, I was a staunch supporter of the original
legislation six years ago to protect this outstanding natural
resource. I was greatly dismayed when the Senate refused to
negotiate in 1980 and we were forced to abandon the Alaska Lands
Act.

During the recent debate in the Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee, I strongly opposed the draft bill to open
ANWR to oil and gas development. I offered and supported several
amendments that would have prevented any action until the
Administration completed a study of our overall energy
alternatives. Unfortunately, these amendments failed and the
committee reported out a bill by a vote of 10 to 9. However, I,
along with many of my colleagues, will continue to work to find a
way to protect this unique area.

Again, thank you for keeping me informed of your concerns.

A 3.day-old Goliath heron, nestling between its father’s feet at. the Dallas Zoo,
is the first to be hatched naturally in captivity in 80 years.

Dallas Zoo’s newest heron makes zoological news

By Carol Trujillo
Staff Writer
The Dallas Zoo’s newly hatched Goliath
heron, huddled in a stick nest on Bird Row,
looks more like a fist-sized wad of laundry lint
than an international zoological phenomenon.
But the 3-day-old chick -— the first to be
hatched naturally by captive herons in 80 years
— represents a reproductive breakthrough.
When the chick shrugged off its shell Thurs.

day, bird zoologist Chuck Siegel said, the Dallas
Zoo became the first in the United States to fos-
ter a Goliath heron's natural birth.

The regal parents, preening to the strains of
ragtime jazz on Saturday, were nonchalant
about the birth's significance. Their fuzzy off-
spring napped in the sun or nibbled regurgi-

tated raw fish.

about

The last Goliath heron hatched
by natural means -— the warmth of
its parents’ downy feathers -— was
in 1908 in the Netherlands.

The Dallas Zoo already is re-
nowned as the only facility in the
world to successfully breed and in-
cubate captive Goliaths, the largest
of the heron family, Siegel said.

Zoo officials hope the rare birth
will stimulate interest in preserv-
ing wild animals and their habitats.

The gray- and rust-colored Goli-
aths are not endangered. But the
long~necked wading birds found
near African marshes and rivers do
not reproduce well in captivity.

Since last year, the heron pair
has spawned —— but spurned —— a
dozen eggs. Zoo officials success-
fully incubated five of those eggs.

Inexplicably, the birds took a
keen parental interest in their last
two eggs. The parents, who take
turns minding the chick and regur-
gitating meals, shared nest-warm-
ing duty throughout the 32-day ges-
tation, Siegel said.

The rest is history. Little Goliath
made zoo headlines. The other egg
produced a stillborn chick, which is
being studied to determine the
cause of death.

stride the percolations of the week-
end “Jazzoo” concert, which drew a
crowd of 7,000.

Like any parents, the herons

'didn’t begrudge attention paid to

their offspring. Siegel studied the
chick through a video camera and
binoculars from a few feet away
and visitors stood on tiptoe outside
a barricade to see what all the fuss
was about.

The chick —— though not as
comely as the 200’s llama or reticu-
lated giraffe babies -—- drew plenty
of “oohs” and “ahs.”

Despite the Chick’s celebrity sta-
tus, it will remain nameless,

“That tends to anthropomor-
phize them,” he said, adding that
the chick, with its incubated sibl-
ings, will be shipped to zoos in San
Diego and Seattle to start new
flocks.

Patent on first man-mad

By Robert Lee Hotz

Sciemre/Medicine Writer

When two Boston biologists pat-
ented a white lab mouse last week,
a scientiﬁc revolution leaped from
the test tube into the law.

For the ﬁrst time, the US. Pat-
ent and Trademark Ofﬁce had rec-
ognized a genetically engineered
animal as the legally protected in—
vention of a laboratory, not nature.
The action gave man-made animals

the same legal status as the aerosol

can, the refrigerator or a computer
chip.

The mouse, genetically altered
so that it readily develops cancer, is
only the ﬁrst in a parade of new an-
imals that could soon receive pat—
ents —— all of them concocted in uni-

versity and corporate laboratories.

Patents on 21 other man—made
animals are pending. It may, in fact,
be only months before the govern-
ment begins issuing patents on ge-
netically engineered animals that
contain human genes.

The new era of creation, howev-
er, is breeding controversy as quick-
ly as new life forms. Efforts to pat-
ent animals are pitting congressmen

~ against patent officials and reli-

gious leaders against the entrepre-
neurs who seek to protect the prof-
its promised by man-made life
forms.

“Reverence for all life created
by God may be eroded by subtle
economic pressures to view animal
life as if it were an industrial prod-

uct invented and manufactured by
humans,“ the Rev. Arie Brouwer,
general secretary of the National
Council oft'.‘h1,1rches. said recently
in a formal statement Having a mor-

atorium on animal patents.

“The gift of life from God, in all
its forms and species, should not be.
regarded as if it were a chemical
product subject to genetic alterv

controvers

ation and patentable for economic
benefit,“ he said in the statement,
which was endorsed by a dozen ma-
yor religious leaders.

.Genetic engineering allows sci-
entists to erase the natural bound-
aries between species by routinely

moving genes between plants, bacte-

ria and animals. The results are an-
Imals new to nature —— a salmon, for
example. that contains genes from
cows and chickens. In the process.
it, also blurs the legal distinctions
that govern the ownership of living
things.

‘ As a result, life ~—— at its most
fundamental level is becoming
another form of private propertv. V

‘ “The decision is outrageous "
said Jeremy Ritkin, a leading critic

of genetic engineering who has or—
ganized a coalition of animal rights
actwrsts and public policy groups,

,including the Humane Society of

the United States. to block the new
patent policy.

“A handful of bureaucrats in the
patent ofﬁce have taken upon them-
selves to establish a policy that al-
lows the private sector to literally
own anything in the animal king-
dom except homo sapiens, " he said.
“And you can own any amount of
the genes in homo sapiens if it is
put into an animal."

To gain time to debate the mor-
al dilemmas, Congress is seeking a
two—year moratorium on the patent-

ing of animals.

Legislation introduced in the
House and the Senate to suspend
animal patenting has more than 80
Republican and Democratic co-
sponsors. Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-
Ore., is pushing for Senate hearings
on animal patents.

After evaluating the moral and
legal problems of patenting higher
animals, a House Judiciary subcom-
mittee unexpectedly rejected a staff
report last month that endorsed an-
imal patents. And last week, US.
Rep. Charlie Rose, D-N.C., and 29
other congressmen wrote the patent
office to urge that no more animal
patents be issued.

“In light of mounting congres-
sional opposition to current animal
patent law, the patent office has
been given no clear and certain sig-
nal from Congress that the unre-
stricted patenting of animals is ac-
ceptable public policy,” the
congressmen wrote.

“Due to the extraordinary eco-
nomic, environmental and ethical
consequences of this decision, we
request you immediately halt the is-
sue of any further animal patents
until Congress has acted legislative-
ly on this matter."

Patent Office spokesman Oscar
Mastin said the office had no imme-
diate response to the letter.

The ability to rearrange an ani-
mal’s genetic inheritance grew out
of a single scientific breakthrough,
but the patent law covering the new
creations has been altered in incre-
ments through a series of bills,
court decisions and regulatory rul-
ings.

For generations, Congress has
allowed breeders to patent new
plants produced by grafts, cuttings
or other asexual methods. In 1970,
patent laws were amended to in-
clude sexually propagated plants,
including alfalfa, cotton and soy-
beans.

But in 1980, the US. Supreme
Court extended patent protection to

life‘s simplest single-celled animals.
The first patent covered a microbe
designed to eat oil slicks.

In the few years since US.
courts ruled that life is no bar to
patent protection, almost 11,500 pat-
ent applications covering biotech-

 

nology products have been filed at
the Patent Office. All are secret un-
til approved. In 1987, the patent of-
fice issued 1,476 biotechnology pat-
ents. Of those, 206 covered the
products of genetic engineering.
Now, by the latest action of the
Patent and Trademark Office, pat—
ent law reaches into the living cells
of all mammals, birds and fish.
Patent officials say that, “for the
time being, we are not going to con-
sider applications involving human
life.” A grant of “limited but exclu-
sive property rights” in a human is
prohibited by the US. Constitution.
But many of the 100,000 genes
that control human growth and de-

velopment already have been isolat-
ed, transferred into bacteria and ‘

patented by drug companies. Re-
searchers are breeding pigs that
contain human genes for growth
and mice that secrete human hor-
mones in their milk. At least one
prominent biologist wants to copy-
right the entire human genetic
code.

Biotechnology critics warn of a
day when a corporation might even
patent a disease-resistant human
being.

While industry executives dis-
miss the idea of patenting humans.
companies already are seeking pat-
ents on the genetic probes that de-
tect individual human genes that
cause diseases like cystic fibrosis
and muscular dystrophy. The genes
that cure those diseases, once iso-
lated and duplicated, could also be
patented as a human “invention.”

Some politicians and religious
leaders worry that the federal gov-
ernment is moving too quickly to 1i-
cense the living products of genetic
engineering.

Industry executives say the gov-
ernment isn’t moving fast enough.
They say too many biotechnology
patents are lost in a “regulatory
never-never land.”

In a sense, animals have been
private property since the first goat,
cow and dog were domesticated, but
genetic engineering adds a new di-
mension.

Today’s farmer may own the an-
imals in his herd, but the person
who patents a genetically engi-
neered animal owns the entire spe-
cies. The patent owner is entitled to
royalties every time the species

gives birth —— in all of the subse- 1

quent generations.

Tattoo artist
finds dogs a
nice sideline

ASSOCIATED PRESS

 

 

FRESNO -—— Chuck Pitman has
tattooed the arms of Navy sailors.
the buttocks of fraternity boys and
even the belly of a crocodile. but
lately his business has been going to
the dogs.

Literally.

Man‘s best friend is no stranger
to Pitman‘s shop, where dog own—
ers typically bring in pedigrees or
expensive show dogs for identifica
tion tattoos in case their animals
are stolen.

“Collars can come off," noted
Trudie Johnson, a customer who
netted her black chow Kong as Pit»
man inked a “K87" on the inside of
the‘animal’s rear leg.

Pitman has been tattooing dogs
for eight years to supplement the
more traditional business of tat-
tooing the chests of Lemoore Naval
Air Station sailors or the buttocks
of Fresno State University fraterni-
ty brothers.

“I‘m making a living, but I won‘t
get rich." said Pitman, 33.

The piranhas swimming in a fish
tank inside Pitman‘s shop also are
marked. and Pitman recalls even
inking “Butch" on the belly of a

32-inch-long crocodiige.

Owners typically‘g shell out $25
per dog for a simple identification
tattoo. Pitman said he recommends
tattoos on the inner thigh to pre
vent any funny business with the
animal. Pitman said there have
been cases when thieves have
clipped off the tatt ed portion of
the dog‘s ear to avoiox detection.

And then there’scosmetic tat-
tooing, such as taking some black
ink to a show dog’s nose to rid it of a
distracting pink spot. Some owners
want to go one step better and put a
red rose or a butterfly on the ani-
mals. i

Pitman says he doesn’t give the
animals pain killers or muzzles
when he touches the tattooing pen-
cil to the animal‘s flesh. He just asks
the owner to hold the animal’s head
and comfort it. -

“Some get a little rowdy. Some
whimper a little. But it doesn’t real-
ly hurt them,” Pitman said.

 

 




TOWN G COUNTRY - May 1988

n May of 1981. Dr. Edward Taub, head of the Institute for Behavioral Re-
search in Silver Spring. Maryland. hired a young man named Alex Pa-
checo to help in his laboratory. where he was doing experiments
relating to spinal-cord injury and stroke. The experiments, conducted
primarily on macaque monkeys, involved cutting nerves to eliminate
feeling in the monkeys’ limbs. As the young man would describe it later,
the seventeen animals were kept in a small room in rust-encrusted
cages just 17%" wide. The walls of the room were splattered with ﬁlth.
Twelve of the monkeys had been debilitated by having nerves severed
in one or both arms. and they struggled hungrily to retrieve scraps of food
that had fallen through the wire-mesh floors of their cages and into piles of
feces on the waste-collection trays below. Some of the animals had
septic, draining wounds. Three had bones coming through their flesh. In
their misery, many had chewed off the fingers and toes on their deadened
limbs; others masturbated incessantly or attacked each other through the
cages. Bandages were ﬁlthy and ineptly applied. The stench from the ac-
cumulated waste and open wounds was ovenivhelming.

Over the next several months. Alex Pacheco recorded what he saw in

the lBFi lab. When he suggested that a veterinarian be called in, he was
told that IBR didn’t employ a vet It was only later that he learned that the
project had begun with thirty animals. and that two sealed barrels in the
lab contained dead monkeys. Although no animals were supposed to die
in the course of the experiments, lBFi had already run through almost half
the monkeys by the time Pacheco arrived.

Within a week of being hired, Pacheco was put in charge of an experi-
ment. although he had made no claims to any previous laboratory experi-
ence. The experiment required him first to accustom two monkeys to
being hand-fed one raisin at a time. He was then to starve them for three
days. then feed them a few raisins; then starve them for another three
days and, after showing them a handful of raisins. not feed them. The aim.
Pacheco says. was to ﬁnd something “interesting” in the monkeys' re-
sponse that might lead to additional funding for the lab. A month later,
Pacheco was asked to administer an “acute obnoxious stimuli" test that
was carried out on an ongoing basis. Its purpose was to determine, by
mapping the monkeys’ sensitivity'to pain, whether any of their severed
nerves had regenerated. The procedure involved strapping a monkey
to an immobilizing chair and applying surgical pliers to its neclz. arms
and chest The technician who showed Pacheco how to perform the
test demonstrated it on the monkey’s testicles. Earlier, the test had
been carried out with a cigarette lighter. Pacheco faked the records for
the tests and kept taking notes. He borrowed money to ﬁx his camera.
bought ﬁlm, requested and received his own set of keys to the lab
and took pictures there late at night

Some months later, Pacheco showed his notes and photographs to a
group of ﬁve scientists, who had convened in secret at his request He
then escorted the men on a midnight tour of the IBFi facility. By dawn all
ﬁve had signed afﬁdavits in favor of prosecuting Dr. Taub for cruelty to ani-
mals—not under the Animal Welfare Act, the primary federal law govern-
ing humane care for laboratory animals, which has no criminal provisions.
but under a Maryland statute that did.

A week later, on September 11, the Montgomery County police raided

the IBFi research facility and conﬁscated sixteen macaques, one rhesus
monkey and the laboratory ﬁles. This was the first such raid on behalf of
animal rights in the U.S.; the ﬁrst time anyone had gone into a lab and come
out with hard evidence of the animals’ mistreatment For Alex Pacheco.
the cofounder and chairman of a fledgling radical animal~rights organi.
zation called People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). who
had inﬁltrated the lab for just this purpose, it was a tremendous victory.

At the time of the police raid. PETA consisted of an unpaid staff of two,
and a dozen volunteers. In the seven years since. the organization has
burgeoned to 250,000 members and is one of the largest and fastest-
growing animal-rights groups in the country. Its budget in 1987 was $3.25
million; in 1988 it will total between $3 million and $5 million.

PETA's growth reﬂects that of the animal-rights-and-welfare move-
ment, whose numbers, respectability and sophistication have increased
dramatically over the past two decades. Today more than 7,000 groups in
America promote animal rights or animal welfare at the national and local
levels. Boasting some 10 million supporters, these organizations range
from the old-line groups (known as reformers or regulationists), which

concern themselves with the mistreatment of animals but do not advocate
vegetarianism or antivivisection. to far more radical groups (known as
abolitionists), which consider all of man‘s uses for animals—in the labora-
tory. as food or clothing, or as exhibits in zoos—to be unjustifiable.

Since the Seventies. animal groups across the spectrum have mounted
a multifaceted assault on what they see as wanton mistreatment of ani-
mals. They have attacked the long-accepted use of animals in biomedical
research, asserting that it is not only cruel and immoral but too often scien-
tiﬁcally unproductive and wasteful of taxpayers’ money. They have tried to
establish legal rights for animals in the courts. Joined by highly respected
scholars, veterinarians, physicians and scientists, who have given the
movement new credibility. they have worked for legislation,.most success-
fully on the state level. and made masterly use of advertising and the me;
dia. The most extreme activists have broken into labs to steal records.
destroy property and rescue—researchers would say steal—animals.

Flanged against the animal rightists in the debate are numerous groups
within the biomedical establishment: private and public universities and re-
search institutions that receive funding for animal research; the farm lob-
bm pharmaceutical companies; government agencies such as the
National Institutes of Health, the US. Department of Agriculture, the
Consumer Product Safety Commission. and the departments of defense
and transportation. Also opposed is the multimillion-dollar research-
animal-breeding industry.

Animal-protection groups would place the National Institutes of Health
near the top of their list of offenders. since NIH apportions more than $5
billion for research every year and sponsors, at least in part, many of the
experiments the groups ﬁnd most abhorrent NIH (under the Public Health
Service) puts out guidelines governing the humane treatment of lab ani-
mals in the projects it funds. Ofﬁcially, NIH is also responsible for screen-
ing proposed projects for their scientiﬁc merit and for compliance with NIH
guidelines for the treatment of animals. According to activists. however.
NIH has avoided specifying which procedures can and should be avoided
(such as. for instance, clipping off guinea pigs' toes as a means of identify-

Town & Country

 

 




ing the animals). And, the activists say, NIH has rarely suspended its fund-
ing of a project found to be in violation of NIH guidelines, even if its
violations have been repeated and flagrant.

Both the magnitude of the economic interests and the number of ani-
mals at stake in the controversy are enormous. Figures on the animal po-
pulaton in U.S. laboratories vary wildly, from 20 million to 100 million. NIH
uses a figure of 17-22 million for all vertebrates used annually in research,
education and testing. The USDA estimates that there are 176,141 dogs,
54,125 cats, 48,540 primates and 521,773 rabbits in American labs. Pa-
checo questions these numbers, pointing out that one company alone—
Charles River Laboratories, a research-animal-breeding company in Wil-
mington, Massachusetts, owned by Bausch & Lomb—breeds and sells
more than 20 million vertebrates a year within the US. Nobody, he says,
knows what the national ﬁgure would be if mice, rats, reptiles, fish, fowl,

Hume, Kant, Montaigne. Schopenhauer and Bentham have pondered the
relationship between man and animals. What distinguishes man from
other animals? they have asked. A soul? Rationality? Language? The
capacity for free choice? How do those differences help to deﬁne our obli-
gations to animals? Most people believe that animals should be treated
well, but why? Simpiy out of kindness, or because they have an inherent
right? Are we cast in the role of benevolent despots, appointed to govern
the animals as God appointed Adam to rule over Eden, or are people and

animals actually kin in an evolutionary continuum? And, if the latter is true,
does the Daminian concept of the survival of the fittest grant us the right
to use other species for our own benefit?

Such questions took on new political heat in this country in the Sixties.
During those turbulent years of civil-rights marches, Vietnam protests and
the growth of the ecology movement, many people started to question
man's exploitative attitude toward nature, natural resources—and ani-
mals. The organizations that sprang up in the Sixties and Seventies were
far more activist and extreme than early animal groups such as the
ASPCA (the oldest animal-welfare group in the U.S.), founded in 1866.
The tactics of the new organizations were influenced in part by Green-
peace, with its sophisticated legal ploys and astute use of the media.

The movement gained impetus in 1975 from Peter Singer’s book Animal
Liberaﬁon. In it, Singer made an eloquent philosophical case for halting all
exploitation of animals. drawing parallels between racism and the “spe-
ciesism" manifest in animal abuse. More important, he also turned a
spotlight on laboratories. For the ﬁrst time, readers. many with no previous
interest in animal protection, learned about the Draize test of cosmetics,

efsnders of animals—ranging from the gently humane to sho-
litionists opposed to all man’s uses of animals—are re-
presented by some 7,000 organizations nationwide. PETA

pharmaceuticals and household products, in which thousands of rabbits
are blinded every year; and about the Lethal Dose 50 (L050) test, in which
tens of thousands of mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, cats and piglets are forced
to ingest or inhale increasing doses of a toxic test chemical until 50
percent of them die, and the effects of the chemicals on them can be
assessed by autopsy. Readers discovered the waste of animal life in
gratuitous or duplicated experiments. They also learned something about
the brutality of routine conditions on the huge factory farms: how chickens
are raised in such overcrowded cages that their bills must be cropped lest
they peck each other to death; how veal calves spend their entire lives in
darkness, virtually immobilized in stalls so narrow they can't lie down.

Alex Pacheco read Animal Liberation when he was in college. From
then on, he dedicated himself to protesting farm practices and the trap.
ping of wildlife. He picketed fur sales and waved placards at local rodeos.
in 1979 he met Cleveland Amory, the founder of The Fund for Animals, a
progressive animal-protection group, and signed aboard the FFA-funded
Sea Shepherd l, a converted trawler preparing to embark on a mission
against illegal whalers. After participating in the sinking of the pirate whal-
er Sierra off the coast of Portugal, Pacheco ended up in England, a
country with a long and venerable history of antivivisection activity. There
he joined the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection and was influ-
enced by Ronnie Lee, who had been jailed for stealing animals from
laboratories and for burning sealing boats.

After Pacheco’s return to the States in 1980, he moved to Washington,
D.C., where he and another young activist. British-hem Ingrid Newkirk,
founded PETA. Their intention was to “turn up the heat" on research facili-
ties and factory farms through confrontational tactics. Pacheco infiltrated
Taub’s institute for Behavioral Research less than two years later. From
Pacheco’s point of view, the disposition of the Silver Spring case would
demonstrate much that was wrong with NIH and with the laws that animal-
welfare groups had struggled to put on the books. After two bitter, pro-
tracted trials. Edward Taub was convicted in 1982 on six counts of

cruelty to animals, and NIH suspended over $100,000 of iBR’s grants.

Ultimately, however, the charges against Taub were dismissed by the
Maryland State Court of Appeals, which held that since Taub's work was
funded by federal grants, he was exempt from state law and subject only
to the Animal Welfare Act. (The Maryland law has since been rewritten to
prevent such decisions.)

For the movement, Silver Spring marked the beginning of a new, ag-
gressive era. Not long after Pacheco’s exposure of IBR, the American
wing of the British Animal Liberation Front began to make incursions into
research facilities that they had reason to believe were in violation of NIH
guidelines. In May of 1984, the ALF broke into the University of Pennsylva-
nia’s Head injury Clinic and afterward delivered over sixty hours of stolen
videotapes to PETA, which acts as the group's unofﬁcial spokesman. A
thirty-minute version of the tapes showed inadequately anesthetized,
struggling baboons strapped onto racks and receiving blows to the head
that were designed to break their necks and cause brain damage. Later in
the tape, the technicians were shown performing unsterile surgery on the
baboons, making mocking remarks as they did so. The sloppiness and
callousness of the clinic's methods and personnel were enough to cause

then-Secretary of Health and Human Services Margaret Heckler to sus-
pend funding for the lab. ALF members made similar raids in 1984 and
1985 at the City of Hope National Medical Center in Duarte, California, and
the Infant Blindness Lab at the University of California at Riverside. The
City of Hope subsequently lost its NIH funding and was fined $11,000
by the USDA; the Infant Blindness Lab was not penalized but was
enjoined to change certain of its experimental methods. With these
and other break-ins. the animal-rights movement captured headlines
across the country as reporters described a new “climate of fear" in the
nation’s laboratories.

Much of the animal-rights movement’s animus is directed toward the
content and current level of enforcement of the broad-based Animal Wel-
fare Act. Enforced by the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Ser-
vice (APHlS), the act ostensibly covers the treatment of any warm-
blooded animai “used . . . for research, testing, experimentation or
exhibition purposes, or as a pet." Remarkably, however, because of a poll-
cy implemented in 1977 by the Secretary of Agriculture, “farm animals"
(horses, sheep, pigs, cows and goats) used in research are not covered by
the provisions of the act. Therefore, APHIS inspectors cannot take effec-
tive action even if they see these animals suffering or being mistreated.
Another of the activists' complaints, buttressed by the findings of the US.
General Accounting Office, is that APHlS’ on-site inspections are not
consistently performed and that reports of violations are not adequately
followed up to ensure compliance. Furthermore. activists claim that there
is nothing in the act (or in any other federal law) to prevent researchers
from justifying the infliction of intense pain by saying that the use of
painkillers would hinder their results. This alone, activists say, renders the
act meaningless.

Certainly, many scientists also criticize abuses like those at the Penn
Head Injury Clinic. They, NIH and the activists now agree, in principle, on a
few things: experiments should have real and constructive goals; altema-
tives to animal research should be used when they exist; the number of
animals used in experiments should be (Continued on page 230)

hristlne Stevens

Christine Stevens is the founder
and president of the Animal Wel-
fare Institute. The wife of Roger L.
Stevens (chairman of the board of
the John F. Kennedy Center for the
Performing Arts), she is tall and el-
egant, and seems the quintessen-
tial involved society lady.

AWl is primarily concerned with
the humane treatment of experi.
mental animals and with the suffer-
ing of animals on traplines, in
slaughterhouses, in transit and in
general commerce. AWl publishes
one of the best newsletters in the
field, the Animal Welfare lnsﬁfute
Ouartedy, and distributes some of
the best and most comprehensive
animal-welfare materials available,
many of which are written by Mrs.
Stevens.

in 1955, Mrs. Stevens founded
the Society for Animal Protective
Legislation, which prepares infor-
mation, upon request, for members
of Congress about bills pertaining
to animal issues, and also orga-
nizes write-in support. SAPL has
been instrumental in achieving the
passage of twelve of the existing
fourteen protective federal laws, in-
cluding the Humane Slaughter Act,
the Wild Horse Annie Act and the
various versions of the Animal Wel-
fare Act.

leveland Amory
Cleveland Amory is founder and
unpaid president of The Fund for
Animals, but he is equally well
known as a social critic, colum-
nist and author whose first book,
The Proper Bostonians, establish-
ed him as an up-and-coming cur-
mudgeon. Amory, himself a prop-
er Bostonian—and a graduate of
Harvard, where he was president
of the Crimson—opened the doors
of The Fund for Animals in 1967.

The Fund for Animals, which has
over 200,000 members, is one of
the largest, most celebrity-sub-
scribed and successful anticruelty
organizations in the world. It works
on rescuing wild and feral animals
and on preventing animal cruelty
wherever it occurs, with whatever
methods seem appropriate: legis-
Iation, litigation, education, con-
frontation. The Fund opposes the
use of animals in research (its mot-
to is “We Speak for Those Who
Can't”), and its largess includes
contributing to and collaborating in
the efforts of other animal-welfare
groups.

At 6'4" and 225 pounds, with a
wild, wiry shock of auburn hair,
Amory has been described as the
last cantankerous man of letters in
the style of Alexander Woollcott
and H.L. Mencken. Consistent with
its leader’s personality, the Fund
tends to become flamboyantly in-
volved in well-publicized issues,
such as the celebrated helicopter
rescue in 1978 of almost 4,000
burros in the Grand Canyon and in
Death Valley—and, in 1983-85, of
over 4,000 wild goats on San Cle-
mente Island—that were going to
be shot in population-control pro-
grams. Working with PETA, in 1982
the Fund saved hundreds of hors-
es that had been collected in Tax-
as by people who intended to make
money shipping horse meat to
France but instead let the animals
starve. It also owned and funded
the Sea Shepherd I, which disabled
the pirate whaler Sierra, freed dol-
phins from Japanese fishing nets
and—along with Greenpeace and
other prominent activists on this
list—protested the commercial
slaughter of baby harp seals in
Canada.

relax that was closer to home. Here, we can

sit outside - and watch pelicans diving for
fish.” For this couple, who were wed in Ve-
rona, Italy, in a castle associated with
Shakespeare's Juliet, the Taj infuses their
free time with a much-appreciated touch of
romance. “We need a certain magic in our
life, a contrast in environment that a house—
boat can create. A houseboat brings out the
best in people—partly because it’s a change
in environment and partly because it’s clos-
er to nature.”

With a mind to making the most of what
nature has to offer, Harlan treated the Taj
as a kind of picture frame. The stark, ivory-
colored walls and furniture, the pale traver-
tine floors, the simplicity of the Moorish
arches that are repeated throughout the
house (even in the bases of the tables)—all
are intended to serve as backdrops for the
view. “You can open up the doors or screens
to bring in the outside,” says Deborah Har-
lan. “That’s where the color is—on the wa—
ter, on the hills and in the sky.”

Through the ever-changing scenery pass
Army Corps of Engineers barges, ferries
and fishing boats, ducks and sea lions.
Should the Harlans care to venture out onto
the water themselves, Angel Island is only
five minutes away. “It’s very isolated,” says
Bill Harlan. “Deer roam around there. It’s
like having a forest in our backyard.” To the
Harlans, and to the other houseboat owners
of Sausalito, that feeling of being a part of
the outdoors, of inhabiting a floating world,
renders any sacrifices they have to make to
live on the waterfront insignificant. Cl

ANIMAL RIGHTS—AND WRONGS

 

(Continued from page 160)

reduced when possible; and everything
should be done to minimize an animal’s pain
and to provide good ongoing care. Just
which experiments are “justified,” what al-
ternatives are available, how many animals
are necessary for a test group, and what
constitutes pain for an animal—this is
where the fight goes on.

The Medical Research Modernization
Committee, a group of scientists and doc-
tors associated with the animal movement,
says taxpayers’ money is particularly wast-
ed and animals needlessly sacrificed in stud-
ies of behavior and drug addiction, and in
research on impact and trauma. The com-
mittee questions the relevance of much
USDA product testing. It points out that
certain drugs, such as thalidomide, proved
benign to test animals but had harmful ef-
fects in humans; others, like aspirin, are tox-
ic to some animals but not to people. While it
doesn’t deny that some drug discoveries and
surgical innovations—in particular, organ
transplants—have owed something to ani-
mal research, the committee holds that ani-
mal research has also yielded bad results,
and sometimes taken longer than in vitro
methods. Penicillin, sulfa drugs, ether,
germ theory, quinine and radium were all
discovered without the use of animals.

D.J. Bross, Ph.D., founder of Biomedical
Metatechnology, Inc. and former director of
biostatistics at the Roswell Park Memorial
Institute in Buffalo, New York, has written
that “from a scientific standpoint . . . what
are called ‘animal model systems’ in cancer
research have been a total failure.” The
hundreds of millions of tax dollars distribut-
ed to animal researchers by the National
Cancer Institute, he says, “[were] spent and
the animals killed for two main reasons.
First, it was a highly profitable undertaking
for certain medical schools and research in-
stitutes that were incapable of doing any
genuine cancer research. Second, it was sus-
tained by a . . . belief in a grossly unscientif-
ic notion: mice are miniature men.”

0n the other hand, Charles R. McCarthy,
Ph.D., director of the Office for Protection
from Research Risks located at NIH, can
think of few areas of research that haven’t
depended on animal testing, including cardi-
ac and cancer treatments. He and many sci-
entists and physicians point to the routine
use of the valves of pigs—since they are
closest in size and form to human valves—
in human heart-valve replacements. The
technique of angioplasty, in which danger-
ous arterial plaque is ﬂattened against the
artery walls, was developed through re-
search carried out on dogs, as was bypass
heart surgery. And the vaccines for polio
and for hepatitis B, to name only two, were
born of experimental work carried out with
monkeys, chimpanzees and other animals.
The prevailing opinion in the biomedical

community is that since using humans in
testing is not an acceptable alternative in
our society, animals are an essential ele-
ment in the experimental process.

Katherine L. Bick, Ph.D., deputy director
for Extramural Research at NIH, says:
“The whole idea of being able to reproduce
test-tube or tissue-culture results in the
whole animal, in an environment that is rea-
sonably controlled, is essential. Scientists
are not trying to set up a system to torture
animals. They’re trying to get the best from
their experiments." There is an entire gen-
eration of people, Bick maintains, who don’t
remember what it was like when friends and
family could be crippled or killed by polio,
and who have no appreciation of the effort
involved in finding a vaccine safe enough to
be used for mass inoculation. The work of
the most extreme animal-rights activists,
she says, is rooted in “a philosophy that the
rights of animals are equivalent to, or .. .
even superior to, those of human beings. I
disagree. I think human life is the most im-
portant thing.”

As the battle lines have hardened, similar
feelings have been voiced by such groups as
The Incurably Ill for Animal Research,
based in Arizona, which publishes a quarter-
ly newsletter documenting medical ad-
vances based on the use of animals. The
defenders, too, have taken to the media.
Recently, a full-page ad in the New York
Times, taken by Reader’s Digest, reprinted
portions of an article by Dr. Robert J.
White that decried “the devastating ef-
fect animal-rights extremists are having
on . . . research.”

The accusation of warped values is one
that activists face routinely. Pacheco says:
“If—and it’s a very big if—it really were the
case that if you killed one dog you could
save two people, and if you said, ‘We’re go-
ing to do it painlessly,’ I wouldn’t concern
myself with that problem, because there are
so many other areas of real abuse.” At other
times, Pacheco has taken a less mollifying
line: “We’re sharply opposed to any condi
tion or procedure that causes an animal to
suffer, to the same degree that we’re op-
posed to any procedure or condition that
would cause a human child to suffer, wheth-
er it’s physical or psychological. Keeping a
dog in a cage in a pet shop would be consid-
ered inhumane by most people. Even if the
experiment doesn’t involve mutilating the
animals, even if the way they are killed is
considered painless, we consider it impor-
tant how they spend their lives."

To which researchers respond that if ac-
tivists oppose the very caging of animals,
there is little they can do to satisfy them
short of stopping the work altogether.

But what are the alternatives to using ani-
mals in research? Pacheco and many others
point out that recently evolved computer

ANIMAL RIGHTS—AND WRON GS

and mathematical models, as well as cell or
tissue cultures, all hold promise as replace-
ments for animals in the lab. Lower organ-
isms, such as one—cell life forms, which
seemingly do not experience pain, can some-
times replace higher ones, they add. The
techniques of gas chromatography and
mass spectroscopy can be used to analyze
blood, urine, and spinal and gastric fluids.
Various imaging techniques—CAT scans,
PET scans and ultrasound, for instance—
can be used in some pathology, neurophysi-
ology and stroke studies. In classrooms and
medical schools, more dummies and cadav-
ers can be used in place of live subjects.
Research into alternatives has increased
dramatically in recent years, sometimes
in response to media pressure. In 1980, for
instance, Revlon gave $750,000 to Rockefel-
ler University to develop alternatives to the
Draize test. The funding came six months
after activist Henry Spira mounted an ad-
vertising campaign asking, “How many rab-
bits does Revlon blind for beauty’s sake?”
The Johns Hopkins Center for Alternatives
to Animal Testing was established in 1981 to
fund research into the development of alter-
natives to the Draize, LD,’0 and other tests.
Originally funded by a grant from the Cos-
metic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association,
the center now numbers among its cor-
, porate sponsors such giants as Avon, May-
belline, Pfizer and Hoffmann-La Roche.
According to Alan Goldberg, the center’s
founder and director as well as associate
dean for research at the Johns Hopkins
School of Public Health: “Most cosmetics
companies are now building up databases on
the effectiveness of various in vitro tests.”
Goldberg cautions that it is still impossible
to predict when any of the alternatives be-
ing explored will be ready for widespread
use, since for each of the product groups
now assessed by the Draize method, batter-
ies of specific new tests must be de‘rised.
Nonetheless, he and others believe that in
the long run, in vitro tests will be prover: su-
perior to animal tests in virtually every in—
stance. “With in vitro testing,” he says,
“you can ask much more focused quies-
tions.” He also points to a shift in the cli-
mate of opinion: “We’ve moved light years
in getting people to consider that in vitro
testing could provide their answers.”
Animal advocates can point to other vic-
tories as well, such as a 1985 amendment to
the Animal Welfare Act that grew out of
two companion bills sponsored in the Senate
by Senator Robert Dole of Kansas and in the
House by Representative George Brown of
California. The amendment strengthened
the monitoring of labs and established an
information service at the National Agricul-
tural Library to decrease duplication of
tests and to provide data on alternatives to
using lab animals. It also attempted to com-

pel researchers to pay more attention to al-
leviating the pain they inflict, including
postoperative pain.

At the same time, the Public Health Ser-
vice guidelines under which NIH operates
(and which are commonly known as the NIH
guidelines) were updated for greater ac-
countability. The newest require each of the
800 PHS-funded facilities involved with ani-
mal research in the US. to have an in-house
oversight committee (which must include,
among others, a scientist, a veterinarian, a
nonscientist and a nonaffiliated person),
whose job it is to review all proposed and on-
going projects to make sure that they meet
NIH standards for care, cage size and staff
training. Researchers have to justify their
use of animals at all—as well as the particu-
lar species and numbers-and the goal of
the project. NIH routinely visits between
ten and fifteen labs every year, and inspects
projects against which complaints have
been lodged. “The effect of in-house com-
mittees is that of having the traffic cop on
the corner, rather than all the way across
town,” comments McCarthy. And although
paperwork has escalated for researchers,
most are taking the new rules in stride.

“It’s helped,” says Pacheco, “but it’s still
housekeeping. What’s done to an animal
while it’s still under the knife, while elec-
trodes are being planted in its head, while
the animal is having its eyes sewn shut—the
mutilations and the physical manipulations,
the electric shocks—that’s still not outlawed
by the legislation or the guidelines. More
over, it’s still a self-policing system. Any
outside critics are, in effect, locked out.”

The Silver Spring monkeys (three have
died since the 1981 confiscation) have re-
mained in NIH custody, at a'cost of $30,000
a year for the first five years. Theyare now
housed in Louisiana at the Delta Regional
Primate Research Center, an arm of the Tu-
lane University Medical Center. PETA has
pursued a series of legal actions in an effort
to sue NIH for custody of the monkeys. The
courts have ruled against the organization,
although perhaps because of Pacheco’s per-
sistent efforts, five of the fourteen surviv-
ing monkeys were released to the San Diego
Zoo in September of 1987. A panel of scien-
tists who examined the monkeys at Delta in
1987 recommended mercy killings for the
remaining nine, which incensed Pacheco.

Members of Congress have extracted a
promise from NIH that this will not be done.
In July of 1987, Representative Robert C.
Smith of New Hampshire introduced a bill
that would turn the monkeys over to Pri-
marily Primates, a private animal refuge in
San Antonio. NIH has maintained that the
facility lacks the proper veterinary care;
PETA disagrees sharply. The bill had 121
cosponsors at the end of February 1988.

“The animals have given their all for re—

LAWS THAT PROTECT ANIMALS

THE ANIMAL WELFARE ACT (1966). Orig-
inally known as the Laboratory Animal Wel-
fare Act, this act was strengthened in 1970,
1976 and 1985. Administered by the USDA’s
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service,
it mandates the type of care and treatment
to be accorded warm-blooded laboratory ani-
mals (farm animals are excluded and ro-
dents and birds have never been covered)
and sets standards for cage size and food.
Recent provisions have strengthened moni-
toring of labs, encouraged education and in-
formation about alternatives to animal
research, and helped prevent unnecessary
duplication of tests. One portion of the
amendment, still under discussion, demands
that researchers provide for the psychologi-
cal well-being of primates. Activists claim
that the act provides no practical control
over what a researcher can or can’t do to
laboratory animals.

THE HUMANE SLAUGHTER ACT (1958).
Strengthened in 1978, this act requires that
all animals slaughtered for meat be killed as
humanely as possible. The bill does not cov-
er the rearing or transporting of animals.

THE WILD, FREEvROAMING HORSES AND
BURROS ACT (1971). An extension of the
Wild Horse Annie Act of 1959, this act pro-
tects these animals on federal land from
“capture, branding, harassment, or death”

 




 

except when herds become too large, in
which case the Bureau of Land Manage-
ment can round up surplus animals and of-
fer them to qualified owners under the
Adopt a Horse program.

THE MARINE MAMMAL PROTECTION ACT

(1972). Under intense pressure from animal--

protection groups, Congress passed this act
prohibiting the killing, capturing or harass-
ing of any marine mammal without a per-
mit. Broadened in 1976 to include all US.
waters to 200 miles, the law is still fairly
easy to get around, and enforcement contin-
ues to be a problem.

THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT (1973).
This act provides that lists of threatened or
endangered species be drawn up by the Sec—
retary of the Interior. (Importation of spe-
cies on the endangered list for commercial
purposes is outlawed.) The bill was
strengthened in 1978.

Bills currently being considered in Con-
gress would: allow citizens to sue the De-
partment of Agriculture to compel it to
enforce the Animal Welfare Act; require
NIH to release the remaining Silver Spring
monkeys to a private sanctuary in Texas;
modernize the testing of consumer products
containing hazardous or toxic substances;
establish a national information center with
the goal of decreasing duplication of live-
animal experiments and increasing re-
searcher) accountability; prohibit any NIH-
funded facility from obtaining or using
experimental animals from animal shelters;
prohibit certain practices (such as confine—
ment in crates) in the raising of veal calves;
impose a two-year moratorium on the pat-
enting of genetically altered animals. Cl

om Regan

Torn Regan, a professor of philoso-
phy at North Carolina State Univer-
sity, is one of the most respected
and prolific philosophers in the
area of animal rights and welfare.
In his renowned book The Case for
Animal Rights, he argues that, as
complicated beings that can suffer
and feel emotions, animals have a
value independent of their useful-
ness to man. In writing the book
he became an abolitionist—con-
vinced that there are no circum-
stances that can justify animal
experimentation and exploitation.

Regan’s interest in animals
stems in part from his studies of
Gandhi. Described in The Sun
magazine as an action-intellectual
in the style of Bertrand Russell, Re-
gan advocates and practices civil
disobedience. In 1985, he first of-
fered a written philosophical con-
demnation of baboon experiments
at the University of Pennsylvania
Head Injuries Clinic, and then
joined eighty hard-line activists in a
four-day sit-in at the NIH that pre-
ceded the suspension of the lab’s
funding.

His role. he believes, includes
spreading the word on the lesser-
known instances of animal abuse.
His particular causes have includ-
ed the Lethal Dose 50 test and the
conditions of confinement and de-
privation under which veal calves
are raised in this country.

In 1985, Regan founded the Cul-
ture and Animals Foundation, a
nonprofit cultural organization.
CAF funds contemporary writers
and artists who are concerned with
animals and supports the perfor-
mance and presentation of cre-
ative works concerning animals.
Regan uses the organization to
open up new constituencies for
animal rights; for instance, CAF
has made videos aimed at recruit-
ing senior citizens and religious
groups. Ultimately, he hopes to find
benefactors who would help him
establish a center comprising a re-
search library, performing arts fa-
cilities, animal sanctuary and
wildlife refuge—an embodiment of
CAF’s purpose and Regan’s vision.

r. Michael w. Fox -

Michael W. Fox is one of the animal
movement's most articulate and
persuasive spokesmen. A doctor
of veterinary medicine, PhD. in
medicine and doctor of science in
animal behavior, Fox is director of
the Center for Respect for Life and
Environment at the Humane Soci-
ety of the United States. Born and
educated in England, he came to
the HSUS in 1976 for the express
purpose of applying the methods of
investigative science to the study
of the use of animals as pets, labo-
ratory subjects and livestock. as
well as in zoo exhibits and schools.
Fox is credited, along with Peter
Singer and Tom Regan, with cool-
ing the emotional temperature of
the movement and lifting the level
of discussion within the scientific
community.

An international authority on the
subject of animal behavior and ani-
mal-welfare science, Fox is the au-
thor of thirty books on subjects
ranging from the integrative devel-
opment of a dog’s brain to animal
fables. He is a contributing editor at
McCall's and writes a syndicated
column called “Ask Your Animal
Doctor” for United Features. He is
also a frequent guest on the net-
work talk shows and one of the
most popular lecture-circuit speak-
ers in the country.

Fox is currently focusing his at-
tention on factory taming and ge-
netic engineering. For the last
seven years. he has been monitor-
ing developments in biotechnology
that have enabled scientists to al-
ter a farm animal’s genetic struc-
ture in order to produce new, more
profitable strains. "The federal
government and the farm industry
are very excited about this," Dr.
Fox has said, “but they seem to be
indifferent to the ethical and theo-
logical problems that are immi-
nent." As Fox sees it, man’s
learning to treat the world with re—
spect and compassion is part of
the evolutionary process, and an
imperative for survival.

 




 

lice Harrington
Friends of Animals was forrnad in
‘ 1957 in New York by Alice Herring-
ton and a small group of volunteers
_ who were committed to reducing.
through low—cost spaying. the num-
bers of pets being killed in pounds
and shelters. (As many as 18 mil-
lion are euthanized every year.)
Some veterinarians claimed it was
, unethical for colleagues to perform
neutering operations at reduced
fees, but most welcomed the pro-
gram, and it gradually went nation-
al. Today it sponsors 80,000
operations each year.

in the late 19603, FoA founded
the first professional lobbying
group for animals and joined the
protest against the slaughter of
baby harp seals—the beginning of
its long commitment to protecting
marine mammals and bringing a
halt to the fur trade. A prize-winning
documentary film made in 1970 by
Mrs. Harrington about the annual
slaughter of fur seals on the Pribilof
Islands was among the many im-
portant efforts that led to the pass-
ing of the Marine Mammals
Protection Act of 1972. The FoA
was also instrumental in bringing
about the passage of the Endan-
gered Species Act in 1973.

Mrs. Harrington retired as presi-
dent in 1986. Her successor, Pris.
cilla Feral, has continued in the
tradition of energetic activism es-
tablished by Mrs. Harrington. Un-
der Feral’s administration, FoA has
embarked on a television advertis-
ing campaign against the fur trade.
This program, with the slogan
“Warm Body Gold Heart,”
marked the first time in the US.
that any animal-rights group had
adopted the use of television
“'spots as a means of promoting
its viewpoint. The ads have en-
countered resistance from both the
fur and television industries and
have yet to be aired by any of the
major networks, which claim that
the ads represent the opinion of
“special interests."

FoA has also recently astab
Iished a wildlife orphanage and re-
habilitation center in Liberia, which
has the most progressive and strin-
gently enforced conservation and
antipoaching laws in Africa.

Helen Jones is one of the most far-

animal-rights movement. Founder
and president of the lntemational
Society for Animal Rights, Ms.

early Fifties as a volunteer, han-
dling fundraising and public rela-

ship director for the American
Humane Association in Denver
and the Humane Society of the
United States before quitting to de-
vote most of her time and energy to
the more extreme lSAR.

ISAR is a highly professional, rel-
atively low-key abolitionist organi-
zation that argues, as the National
Law Journal has put it, that “ani-
mals, like people, have rights aris-
ing from their existence." The first
organization to use the term “ani-
mal rights" in its name, lSAFl con-
siders itself to be the conscience of
the animal-rights movement. It is
an acknowledged leader in the dif-
ficult fight to establish legal rights
for animals.

Backed by some of the best re-
search in the movement, lSAR has
campaigned intelligently for every-
thing from a ban on sport hunting to
halting the wholesale killing of mil-
lions of blackbirds by the US.
Army, Air Force and Department of
the Interior. in the mid Seventies
lSAR was a leader in repealing
pound-seizure acts, which allowed
laboratories to take animals from
shelters, and in 1978 launched
what would become a national ef-
fort to stop the now-notorious Le-
thal Dose 50 and Draiza tests in
the cosmetics and pharmaceutical
industries.

Television personality Bob Bark-

influential members. ISAR publica-

with the organizers of the Miss Uni-
verse and Miss USA pageants—

Swan song
at Swan Lake
is one of joy

Denver Post Wire Services

ST. PAUL, Minn. —— Minnesota is

putting the swan back into Swan '

Lake.

The state Wednesday released
four giant trumpeter swans at the
southern Minnesota lake to help re-
store the largest North American
waterfowl to the area.

“It was really thrilling for me,”
said DuWayne Giefer, a director at
the Nicollet Conservation Club,
where the rare, snow-white birds
were released.

“They let them (the first pair)
go and they half paddled, half ﬂew
out of the lagoon to the bigger part
of the lake. Then they paddled until
they got out behind some rushes
and disappeared from View.”

The release marked the start of
the second year of restoration ef-
forts by the state Department of
Natural Resources.

The giant birds, which weigh up
to 35 pounds and have a wing span
of up to 8 feet, were hunted by pio-
neers for their down and meat.

Some of the birds continue to die
despite the protection of state and
federal laws and fines that can ex-
ceed $1,500, said Carrol Henderson,
the state’s non-game wildlife su~
pervisor. Some hunters mistake
the swans for ducks or geese and
other birds die by ingesting lead
shot. _

“A number of people had written
off trumpeter swans like the buffa-
lo. I took that as a challenge. I felt

the birds deserved a chance to
make a comeback,” Henderson
said.

The trumpeter swan population
dwindled to fewer than 100 birds in
the continental United States 50
years ago. They now number about
11,000 in North America, with most
of those in Alaska, and have start—
ed to make a comeback in the
western United States.

The state is raising birds at a

cost of $1,600 each from eggs col-
lected from the western United
States, Canada and Alaska and
plans to release them as they turn
3 years old.

It released its first crop last year
in northwestern Minnesota. Thir-
teen birds survived and migrated
to Iowa and central Minnesota. and
they are expected to return this
month and mate.

Senators blast dolphin slaughter

Denver Post Wire Services

WASHINGTON -- Senators and
environmentalists joined Wednes—
day in calling for an end to the ac—
cidental but extensive slaughter of
dolphins by foreign ﬂeets fishing
for tuna in the Pacific.

At a hearing of the Senate Com-
merce, Science and Transportation
Committee, lawmakers and envi-
ronmentalists also criticized the
Reagan administration, saying it
had failed to enforce a law that re—
quires the United States to press
the foreign tuna ﬂeet to reduce the
killing of dolphins.

Administration spokesmen said

that rules had now been adopted to ,

carry out the the Marine Mammal
Protection Act but that it would
take three more years before they
take effect.

Several senators praised U.S. tu-
na fishermen for sharply reducing
their incidental killing of dolphins
in the last 10 years. But environ-
mentalists complained that the
American tuna boats are still un-
necessarily killing thousands of
dolphins each year.

 

Environmentalists
complain that
American tuna boats
are unnecessarily
killing thousands of

Dolphins tend to travel with
schools of yellowfin tuna in the
eastern part of the Pacific Ocean
for reasons that remain a scientific
mystery.

Dolphins are trapped in the huge
nets used by the fishing boats to
haul in tuna, and either drown or
are crushed or maimed when
dragged aboard the vessels.

With the passage of the 1972 pro-
tection act, several actions were
taken to reduce the slaughter.

Meanwhile, however, the acci~
dental killing of dolphins increased
because of the growing. tuna fleets

ST. LOUIS POST—DISPATCH -

of other countries operating in the
Pacific, including Panama, Costa
Rica, Ecuador, Mexico and Spain.
Last year more than 78,000 dol-
phins were killed by these foreign
fleets; in 1986 they killed nearly
125,000 dolphins.

The 1984 amendment to the ma-
rine mammal law provided that
countries that did not take steps to
bring down their killing of dolphins,
including putting observers on the
tuna boats, should be denied access
to the US. market for their catch.

But one official said it had been
difficult to draw up appropriate
rules because of the complexities
of the issue. For example, foreign
fishing fleets that do not want to
adhere to restrictions on dolphii
killing might simply take their
catches to other markets, particu-
larly in Europe.

He said interim rules had now
been completed requiring observ-
ers on foreign vessels and certifi-
cation by those vessels that US.
requirements for protecting dol-
phins are met.

Stop Killing Dolphins For Tuna

Congress decided four years ago that if
foreign fleets did not reduce the number of
dolphins they kill in the process of harvest-
ing their tuna catch, they should be denied
access to the US. market. Since then, how-
ever, the killing of dolphins by foreign
fleets in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean
has actually increased, to the point that
now more than 100,000 of the mammals
die each year as tuna boats snare them in
the giant purse seines designed to haul in
schools of yellowfin tuna.

The senseless slaughter was brought
home to US. consumers by the recent
news broadcast of a movie made aboard a
Panamanian-registered tuna boat. The
film showed hundreds of panicked dol-
phins in the throes of death, sacrificed to a
harvest of not more than a dozen tuna.

The departments of State and Com-

merce have dragged their feet in develop-
ing and enforcing regulations that would
carry out Congress will on this matter, as
hearings before the Senate Commerce
Committee have shown. Now, at last, ad-
ministration officials say they have devel-
oped rules that will cause foreign fleets to
reduce their dolphin kills ———- but they add
that fully three more years will pass before
they begin to take. effect.

Such a delay is unacceptable. American
tuna fleets as well as foreign ones should
reduce dolphin kills far below levels
deemed acceptable by the administration
(at present, 20,500 a year for US. fleets).
Additionally, U.S. processors of tuna, in-
cluding St. Louis~based Ralston Purina,
which markets Chicken of the Sea tuna,
should shun purchases of tuna from for-
eign sources that do not abide by US. law.

Snakes, rattles and bankrolls

Brisk trade in unusual Texas resource pits ecologists vs. entrepreneurs

By Melinda Henneberger

Staff Writer

In Cooke County in North Texas, a
half-dozen eager hunters armed with
ﬂashlights and metal tongs fan out across
a remote gulley near the Red River.

In the Houston laboratory of a biotech-
nology company, researcher Jack Kill-
man clones a protein that might stop the
growth of tumors.

And in a strip shopping center in
Farmer’s Branch, George and Linda Wills

purvey a variety of exotic trinkets includ-
ing earrings, belts and paperweights.

In their disparate pursuits, all are in-
volved in the buying and selling of one of
Texas’ hottest and oddest natural re-
sources: rattlesnakes. And environmen-
talists say Texas’ booming snake business
is leading to an ecological bust.

Hunters estimate that 500,000 Texas di-
amondbacks fetching about $50 apiece
were harvested in a bumper crop last
year. They supplied what Wills called the

“constant demand” for products ranging
from $10-a-pound snakeburgers to $40
snakeskin gimme caps. Byproducts range
from gallbladders marketed as an Orien-
tal aphrodisiac to the freeze-dried venom
purchased by research labs at up to $40
an ounce.

The rattler’s parts fetch handsome
prices. The snake’s head, which nets
hunters a dollar, fetches $20 to $50 as a

paperweight. The rat-
tle, which a hunter may sell for $3,
isinade into $10 earrings.

Those cashing in on the snake
trade are mainly small- time opera-
tors whose numbers have swelled
to several thousand since the Urban
Cowboy craze popularized snakes-
kin attire in the early 19803. More
recently, the oil bust has made
snake-hunting a particularly attrac-
tive source of supplemental income
4- about $5,000 a year for the most
enterprising.

“Cowboys, oil wells and snakes
are related to Texas - that’s what
people up north think,” said Wills,
who calls himself the “world’s larg-
eSt manufacturer of rattlesnake
products.” He employs 28 people at a
rattlesnake slaughterhouse in
Brady, Texas, where the diamond-
backs are killed in a miniature guil»
lotine, processed and turned into
offbeat products.

’ Wills said his best customers are
retailers in New York, Pennsylva-
nia and other Eastern states.

“Praise the Lord for Yankees, or
we couldn't be in the snake busi-
ness, ” he said
, The snake business also supplies
Killman at NaturSorce laboratories
in’ Houston with the protein- -rich
venom involved in his research.
Killman says that, in studying
venom, he isolated a protein that
has yielded positive results in re-
tarding the growth of tumors in lab-
oratory animals.

Naturalists maintain that what’s
liitsch for New Yorkers, beer money
for ranchers, raw material for sci-
ence and big business for snake-
product wholesalers could be a dis-
aster for the delicate balance of na-
ture.

' The conﬂict
hunters and herpetologists dates
back 30 years, when rattlesnake
roundups became a rite of spring in
many Texas and Oklahoma com-
munities.

2 Bill Ransberger, a Sweetwater
Snake hunter and handler, has sur-
vived 40 rattlesnake bites. But he
says he steers clear of “those envi-
ronmentalists.”

; ;“You have to be careful with
them,” he said “You don’t argue.
You just walk away. ”

v ..Still, the two groups share a fas-
situation with facts about the amaz-
ing diamondback, which reportedly
can bite several hours after being
decapitated and grow new fangs in

«Some of their reptilian instincts
are almost human.

' "They come out of hibernation
looking for sex and a meal and then
go crawl back under a rock for a
month,” one snake enthusiast said.

pressive blue whales, rattlesnakes
have not elicited an outpouring of
sympathy from the masses.

ity for rattlesnakes,” said Jim Seip-
pel, an Austin engineer who serves
as chairman of the legal affairs
committee for the Greater San An-
tonio Herpetological Society.

Nonetheless, environmentalists
have gone on the offensive. Last
month, 26 Texas animal rights and
environmental groups banded to-
gether for the first time to protest a
rattlesnake hunt at Taylor, Texas.

There, as crowds gathered to
watch snake handlers pile dazed
rattlers on their heads, two protest-
ers dramatized their concerns by
chaining themselves to a fence in-
side the grounds.

Local police responded by throw-
ing a tarp over the protesters, who
soon unchained themselves and
went home. But Seippel, one of the
protest organizers, said the group’s
future efforts won’t be so easily ob-
scured.

The consortium is organizing a.

nationwide letter-writing campaign
directed at the Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department. The group’s
goal, Seippel said, is to encourage
the department to regulate the
number of snakes killed and outlaw
the practice of pouring gasoline
into logs and animal holes to force
snakes out into the open. Critics say
the gasoline frequently kills other
animals that live underground.

Diamondback rattlesnakes “are a
natural part of the ecology — it’s
not like the communists let them go
to terrorize Texans,” said Dallas
herpetologist David Barker.
“They’ve been there for a million
years.”

Because rattlers prey on rodents
and rabbits, a decrease in their
number could lead to an explosion
of disease-carrying rodents and rah

bits that cost millions in crop dam-
age, said Dr. Jeffrey Black, a profes-
sor of biology at Oklahoma Baptist
University.

A decline in the rattlesnake pop-
ulation “could cause a general col-
lapse of an ecosystem," Barker said.
“Rain patterns, clean water and all
the food we eat depend on a healthy
ecosystem."

Snake hunters respond to those
charges by saying that they are ren-
dering a service -— ridding the state
of the dangerous reptile, educating
crowds who gather at the roundups
and promoting safety.

The Texas Parks and Wildlife De-
partment is officially noncommit-
tal.

“It brings into play competing
interests, and our job is to ride the
fence,” said Bruce Thompson, pro-
gram director for non-game and en-
dangered species for the Parks and
Wildlife Department. “We’re caught
in the middle.”

Thompson said his office has
“received a number of letters re-
cently from people who frankly
don’t look into what our capabili-
ties are.”

Those capabilities, he said, do
not include regulating the use of
gasoline or controlling animal wel-
fare. The department could regu-
late the number of snakes killed
within a given period, but the effect
of snake population levels on the
environment “is not something we
could demonstrate," Thompson
said. “And I can assure you many
people would object.”

“I’m not saying there’s no prob-
lem,” he said, “But it’s one of many
trouble spots. I see it as being a self-
regulating thing. If enough people
see it as objectionable, it will stop."

Seippel calls that view a cop-out.

snakes could upset the ecosystem.

Texas rattlesnakes continues.

Hunters say an increase in the

number of snakes killed every year
means the snake population is
growing, while environmentalists
say it means a decrease in the num-

"1 can’t understand some of the
environmentalists' concern over
something that can maim, cripple

, Rationing care Raft?

More states

1 Last year Oregon made na-
tional headlines when it dropped
, Medicaid funding for certain trans-
plants.

Lawmakers decided the state
would no longer pay for bone mar-
row, heart, pancreas and liver trans—
plants, covering just kidney and cor-
nea operations. Money that would
have paid for 30 transplants a
year was redirected to prenatal
care for some 1,500 vLomen.

The policy shift means low—
income people now must raise the
money—ranging anywhere from
$100,000—S200,000--—to pay for a
life-saving operation.

“We had a limited amount of

money,” says Janice Yaden, as-
siStant to Gov. Neil Goldschmidt,
“and the [state Medicaid] agency
recommended using it to serve a
larger number of’m It
was jifst’more cost-effective.”
' Oregon isn’t the only state wres-
tling with the issue. Texas, Ari—
zona, Alabama and other states
Lhave’also limited coverage.

 

 

 

 

m

Such moves represent the most ex-
plicit attempt yet at rationing health
care in the United States. And there
are far-reaching implications for
older Americans since some ad-
vocates of rationing health care sug-
gest age as a valid basis for denying
life-sustaining treatment. (See related
story on page 12.)

“The way states resolve the ques-
tion of organ transplants may be an
indicator of how they-will deal with
future health care issues,” says
Phoebe Lindsey,

a researcher at i "L
the RAND-
UCLA Center
for Health Pol-
icy Study. “The
question for
st r“ ’ is
per to al-
w rationing to
ur in an ad

hoc manner or whether to develop
speciﬁc criteria.”

Unfortunately, she says, any kind
of cost—beneﬁt analysis requires plac-
ing agdollar“ value on human life.

"Arizona lawmakers stared grimly

at the bottom line last summer be-
fore voting to drop coverage for bone

marrow and liver transplants. ‘26 ‘

onard 1rschner, Arizona’s Medicaid
director, says was the uncomfortable
question facing his state.

For the cost of one transplant, he
says, Adm provide comprehen-
sive pediatric care for about 300g.hil—
dren. “We’re reaching a point in our
so'éiety where we have to decide what
to do with limited resources.”

Other states have not been as di-
rect as Oregon and Arizona.

Alabama covers a variety of trans—
plants, including kidney and bone mar-
row, but sets a 12-day limit on an-
nual hospital stays it will pay for un-

der Medicaid, a restriction transplant.

experts say is impractical.

“The 12-day limit is not even realis-
tic for pre-transplant needs,” says a
spokeswoman for the American Coun-
cil on Transplantation. “Patients need-
ing transplants often are in and out
of the hospital for more than 12 days
even before the actual operation.”

Texas tried imposing a yearly

 

$50,000 cap on per person hospital -

expenses under Medicaid, in effect rul-
ing out transplants, which usually
cost $100,000—$200,000 each. But

., last year a federal court ordered.
Texas to pay for liverwtransplants for

a 6-year-old and ‘a S-month-old, re-
jecting the state’s dollar cap as arbi-
trary and unreasonable.

“In the Texas case, the court said
that if a state is going to cover a cate-
gory, then it must cover a reasonable
amount,” says Roger Schwartz, an at-
torney with the National Health Law
Program in Washington, DC.

In at least one instance, age was
ruled an insufﬁcient basis for denying
coverage. Before dropping liver trans-
plant coverage last year, Arizona had
limited the procedure to those under
18. But a federal court in 1986 or-
dered the state to pay for a trans-
plant for a woman in her 403.

' “Case law seems to be developing
that a trans—
plant is just an-
other required

hospital serv-
ice,” Schwartz
says.

Still, trans-
plants are
hardly routine,
and their ur-

gﬂﬁw gent, life-saving
nature only serves to intensify the fund-
ing debate. Because organs are in
short supply, meaning only a small
number of people can be served, the
question becomes: Who will they be?

Add to this a lack of treatment al-
ternatives, and each funding decision
produces a life-an'd-death drama with
a clearl identiﬁable sufferer: The
ﬁrst victim of Oregon’s new policy on
transplants was 7-year-old Coby How-
ard, a leukemia victim who died be-
fore money could be raised for a
bone marrow operation.

As new technologies such as heart
and liver transplants become more
promising, states will face increasing
pressure to provide ﬁnancial access
for those persons without coverage.

Already, public outrage and two
pending lawsuits have prompted Ore-
gon to temper its judgment.

A state task force on organ trans—
plants recently recommended restor-
ing coverage once private donations
reach $100,000, says Medicaid admin-
istrator Hersh Crawford. The state
would not put up any money but
would administer the program as
long as contributions collected by a
private fund-raising group, covered
the state’s cost, he says.

However, once coverage is rein-
stated, if private donations don’t keep
pace with costs, the program would
again shut down, Crawford says.

Though he is hopeful a steady
stream of money will ﬂow into the
transplant fund, Crawford wonders
if the enthusiasm to give will outlive
the memory of young Coby Howard.
.“It’s a lot easier to raise money if

you have a name and a face.”

Articles ignore cruel side
of rodeos and dog racing

Lately, every time I pick up the pa-
per I read about more exploitation of
animals. On April 17, you ran articles

glorifying two so-called “sporting
events” - rodeo and dog racing.

Rodeo by any humane standard is
cruel. Unfortunately, spectators see the
glamour of the cowboys of the Old West
and rarely realize that the animals are
subjected to great stress and physical
injury. The cruelties are too numerous
to name here, but injuries have been
well-documented: broken limbs, open
wounds, abrasions, spur marks in neck
and shoulders. broken horns, even bro-
ken necks.

Dog racing is another instance
where spectators are many times un-
aware of the cruelties involved. Racing
dogs are merely “machines” to the orga-
nized dog racing industry. Approximate-
ly 30,000 to 50,000 dogs a year are killed
before they ever reach the track be-
cause they are not fast enough.

.When your reporters write a feature
article involving the use of animals, I do
wish they would investigate all sides be—
fore they become the gullible press
agents for cruelty.

Paws for reflection

Dogs, those stubborn sissies, don’t you love ’em?

his past weekend, The Boy and I
entertained a guest in our home.
Her name is Suzy (only because
she steadfastly refuses to answer to
her real name, which is Sally), and she is a
young beagle who normally lives with a
friend of ours. He went away for a few days;
ergo, Suzy was ours.

Anyway, she was pretty much a delight,
and, except for sometimes reversing the nor-
mal order of things (i.e., relieved herself the
very second her walk was over and she was
safely inside), our report card to her owner
was glowing: Personality, A; Looks, A; Socia-
bility, A (she loved Blux and was respectful of
the cats, particularly after the mean one
bopped her on the beak). After only a few
days in her company, we will miss her.

The interesting thing, fun aside, was how
much Suzy and Blux are alike. This was not
news to The Boy, who grew up with a dog at
his side and who has always saidiof the spe-
cies, “They’re all the same. Exactly the
same.” But, though I have had a few dogs in
my time, never before had I realized The Boy
was not exaggerating but speaking the plain,
unvamished truth.

All dogs are the same. To wit:

I All dogs, when treated well, are absolute
lambs, which is to say, Sissies. They abhor
violence, cringe at the merest hint of tension
in the family and yield the right-of-way to
cats. They may appear to make good burglar
alarms (indeed, their barks and sometimes
their looks can be quite effective in this re-
gard), but once a burglar is inside he is in
danger only of having his face washed.

IAll dogs prefer to sleep on their sides,
legs stretched out straight, on your bed. They
may settle for sleeping elsewhere but given
the choice, would rather sleep with you, their
heads on your pillow. All dogs also dream a

lot, as evidenced by the groaning noises,
sighs and fierce bicycling movements they
make whilst at rest.

I When rising, all dogs go through the fol-
lowing process: First they stretch; then they
sneeze; then they shake themselves, enough
so their ears make helicopter noises; then
they repeat the whole thing until they wake
you.

I All dogs will, if you look at them warmly,
roll over onto their backs and demand you
scratch their bellies. Should you do this, at
some point all of them will wrap both front
paws about their noses and scratch same until
they sneeze, again.

IAll dogs, in a perfect dog world, would
eat cat food. This is why, in the imperfect one
they inhabit, they will look at their bowls only
after they have polished to a high gloss the
cat’s bowl and pushed it with their noses out
of the kitchen.

I All dogs are stubborn and simply have to
walk on the broken glass from which you are
trying to save them, or simply must stand
between the bucket seats of your car, or sim-
ply insist on smelling that one patch of snow
that is in the middle of the road.

Invariably, too, all dogs will get their own
way: It may take them a while, it may take
them weeks, but they will walk on that glass
or stand between the seats or smell that one
patch of snow. The proof is in the pudding,
and the pudding is Suzy: “Her owner tried for
months to get her to respond to “Sally" but
she would have none of it, and in the end she
won.

Of course, so did he, because the bottom
line is, all dogs are exactly the same, which is
to say, they’re all great, every last loose-
lipped one of them.

New tests
may spare
animal lives

Cultured skin promising
as chemical ‘guinea pig’

By Rick Weiss
Special for The Washington Post

WASHINGTON — Seeking nothing more than to
darken her eyelashes, “Mrs. Brown” went blind in the
spring of 1933. She suffered constant pain for three months
until her corneas peeled away, all because she used an
eyelash dye that promised to “radiate personality.”

Her experience earned her a place in a chamber-«of—hor-
rors exhibit presented to Congress by the ﬂedgling Food
and Drug Administration as part of a successful campaign
to pass the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938.

Countless such tragedies no doubt have been averted
since the FDA gained, through that act, the authority to
prohibit the sale of harmful cosmetics. But the legacy of
Mrs. Brown, as she is referred to in FDA archives, remains
a painful one for more than 100,000 rabbits each year that
are subjected to similar fates under the act’s provisions
requiring toxicology tests on animals.

Here is what happens, for example, in the classic Draize
test for ocular irritancy: The rabbits are held firmly while
their eyelids are pulled back and a measured dose of a
suspected eye irritant is squirted onto the eye. The rabbits’
eyes then are observed after 24, 48 and 72 hours for
redness, blistering, bleeding or blindness.

The FDA says such tests on live subjects are necessary
to ensure human safety. .

But in recent years, there has emerged a movement
aimed at replacing such animal tests with “in-vitro," or
test~tube, alternatives. More than 100 in-vitro toxicology
tests, most using cell or tissue cultures, are under
development by scientists, including leading researchers in
some of the largest household chemical and cosmetic
companies. ‘

Replacing animal tests “used to be considered a ﬂaky.
humane idea,” said Henry Spira. a leading spokesman for
the movement against animal testing. But today, he said,
“in vitro has moved into the mainstream.“

A recent development is a “living-skin equivalent"
created by a biotechnology company that should be
available to testing labs in about a year. The material.

 

 

Testskin: An alternative to animal testing

 

 

An artiﬁcial skin, called Testskin
by Organogenesis, of Cambridge,
Mass, has been created so chemi-
cals can be tested without harming
whole animals. It consists of skin
cells grown in sheets to produce

a tissue resembling human skin.

It has several layers. with the
outermost layer in contact with

the air. The tissue is supported by
its own synthetic skeleton and
circulatory system. A nutrient
medium is circulated into a vessel
containing the tissue, and waste .
products. produced by the tissue's
metabolism or by reactions to the
tested chemicals. can be removed
and analyzed during tests of a
chemical's toxicity.

called “Testskin,” is an artiﬁcially
fabricated sheet of living skin that can
be painlessly exposed to various
irritants.

The problem now, some researchers
and activists say, is that federal
regulatory agencies are failing to
provide the leadership and incentives
needed to nurture this toxicological
transition.

Spira knows how to generate
incentives. In one of the turning
points of the animal-rights movement,
he organized a highly successful 1980
protest against Revlon Inc. Individu-
als from more than 400 groups
dressed in rabbit costumes and
marched outside Revlon’s corporate
offices in opposition to the company’s
use of the Draize test. Spira ran
full-page newspaper ads depicting
bandaged white rabbits asking, “How
many rabbits does Revlon blind for
beauty’s sake?”

Six months later, Revlon initiated a
research program at Rockefeller Uni-
versity in New York City to look for

alternatives to the Draize test. Within .

months, other cosmetic compa '
contributed hundreds of thousands of
dollars to similar programs, and the
search for in-vitro alternatives got
under way seriously.

Today, cosmetic companies widely
publicize their commitment to reduce
the number of animals used in testing
their products. Such commitments are
more than token gestures; companies
are finding that in-vitro tests can have
a number of advantages over tradi-
tional animal tests. According to the
congressional Office of Technology
Assessment, in-vitro tests cost an
average of $50,000 per product as
opposed to $500,000 when animals are
used.

Moreover, in-vitro tests can be
more precise than many animal tests,

making it possible to learn more about
the molecular mechanisms that under-
lie inflammation, membrane damage
and tissue toxicity.

A fundamental problem with ill-Vl-
tro models, however, is that they fail
to mimic the complexity of the whole,
living organism.

“Any risk assessment of human
ocular irritation or any other type of
toxicity is going to have to be based
on a spectrum of data generated from
a battery of tests,” said John Frazier,
a professor of environmental health at
Johns Hopkins University and associ-
ate director of the university’s Center
for Alternatives to Animal Testing.

In a broader approach to the
problem, some researchers are seeking
to combine the various components of
skin into a living laboratory specimen
that can be tested as a unit. ~

Eugene Bell, professor emeritus at

the Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology and chairman of Organogene-
sis Inc., a biotechnology company in
Cambridge, Mass, has recently un-
veiled a “living-skin equivalent espe-
cially adapted for toxicology testing,
I’Testskin. .
DeveIOped by Organogenesis as a 1
skin graft for the treatment of burns, 1
Testskin can be grown in sheets the ,
size of conference tables, Bell said. It
has a synthetic skeleton and Circula-
tory system, but is covered with a
living outer layer and “feels like a
piece of skin,” he said. Pigment-con-
taining melanocytes can be added so
that the skin can tan after exposure to

sunlight, Bell saw, and “it even ’

repairs itself when wounded.”

Bell makes the test skin in a 1

two-stage process he calls “a bottle-
filling Operation.” First, he mixes
cultured dermal fibroblast cells with
appropriate nutrients and other bio.
logical molecules, and pours them all
into a mold. Over a period of a few
days, this gel condenses into a

“dermal equivalent,” or a mass of
cells similar to the deeper layers of
skin.

Later, human keratinocytes, the
type of cells that form the outer layer
of skin, are cultured onto the dermal
equivalent. They multiply and sponta~

So far, however, regulatory agen-
cies, the key link between basic
research and commercial use, have
given few clues about which, if any,

in»vitro tests may be accepted as
alternatives to current tests. And
although committees abound, Kailash
Gupta of the health-sciences division
of the Consumer Product Safety
Commission said, “None of the
agencies, as far as I know, has
seriously sat down and said that these
are the criteria that alternative tests
should meet to be accepted.”

Spira notes that the Environmental
Protection Agency still refuses to
accept a more humane version of the
Draize test, the Low Volume Eye
Irritation test, which he says has been
studied for more than a decade and
has been designated a standard
method by the American Society for
Testing and Materials.

Bureaucratic sluggishness is not the
only factor slowing acceptance of
incvitro alternatives. Difficult scien-
tific hurdles remain, and uppermost

among them is the need to design

objective validation criteria for new‘

test methods.

neously organize themselves into a
multilayered, differentiated epidermis
within about four days. After three to
four weeks, a complete basal lamina, a
layer of specially arranged cells, is
formed between the epidermis and
dermis. The basal lamina, present in
living skin but never before created in
vitro, is believed to be an important
region governing chemical penetration
and the inﬂammatory response.

Not everyone is sold on Bell’s new
product. Paul Wegener, of San Die-
go-based Clonetics Corp., a maker of
cultured epithelial cells, says there
may be advantages to testing different

‘ cell types separately, including cost.

But the successful modeling of a
tissue system even hinting of the
complexity of human skin bodes well
for the future of in-vitro testing.

“I think that this is just the very
beginning of a method to create
hybrid organisms that will be useful
for testing,” Bell said. “We are really
primitives at this point.”

If the goal is to become less
primitive, and a decline in the use of
animal tests is one measure of that
goal, then progress is being made,
according to Animal Rights Interna-
tional, a coalition of animal-rights
groups in New York City.

Independent toxicology labs, cos-
metic~company trade associations and
government agencies all are exploring
ni-vitro alternatives.

Moreover, with so many laborate
ries developing their own iii-vitro
tests, “any list (of standards) that
comes out of a laboratory is going to
look like it’s self-serving,” said Dennis“
M. Stark, director of research and.
testing alternatives at Rockefeller
University. A

Ultimately, some argue, even regu~l
latory revisions may be insufficient.
Christopher Kelly of the National.
Testing Corp. in Palm Springs, Calif,
a developer of in-vitro toxicology
tests, says nothing short of congressio-
nal action is needed to ensure in
vitro’s acceptance. '

Massachusetts farmers
find fault with premise
«of animal cruelty bill

By B.J. Roche
Special to the Globe

COLRAIN - Like three generationsbefore him, dairy farmer Ken
Avery is up each morning before 6 to milk his 54 head of Jersey cows.

Avery milks the cows on one side of the barn - Goldie, Bertha, Pa—
tience, Farrah, Bonus, and on down the line — while his son Craig takes
the other. His work day typically ends at 10 pm, after he‘s fed the cows
their seventh meal of the day.

Avery, 58. bristles at the idea that he could be called inhumane. Yet,
as president of the Franklin County Farm Bureau, a farmers’ lobbying
group, he is one of hundreds of farmers from across the state who are
fighting a proposed ballot referendum aimed at prohibiting cruelty to
farm animals.

, “My feeling is that if it's passed, it will be the end of the small family

farm. It's that simple,” Avery said, sitting in the kitchen of the farm—
house his family has lived in since 1855. “People are coming in and
saying. ‘You do this,’ and they have no idea about what farming is
like.”

Members of the Cam-

bridge—based Coalition to
End Animal Suffering and
Exploitation have gathered
72,500 signatures on peti-
tions supporting the Hu—
mane Standards for Farm
Animals referendum. 1f the
standards become law.
Massachusetts would be-
come the first state in the
nation to establish humane
standards for the treatment
of farm animals.

But farmers and agricul-
tural officials say the bill,
aimed at the large—scale
“factory farming" and con-
finement of veal calves and
poultry, is vague and un-
necessary, at least in this
state. They argue that such
a law would put further fi—
nancial pressures on dairy .. .

The proposed referen~

. dum would set minimum standards for the confinement of veal calves
and require the state Department of Food and Agriculture to develop
regulations for the slaughtering of veal calves and chicks as well as
surgical procedures for farm animals.

It would also establish a five—person advisory board made up of the
state director of the Division of Animal Health and four specialists in
animal science, who would be nominated by humane organizations.
The board would develop further regulations, and would review and
comment on construction of any farming projects costing more than
$10,000. ‘

“The problem opponents have is not so much with the law, but with
the regulations that could come from the advisory board,” said Kathy
O’Neil, a member of the research staff of the House Natural Resources
Committee.

Mass. farmers dispute premise

of proposed animal cruelty bill

I ANIMALS
Continued from Page 33

“The concern is that the language
is so vague that it’s hard to know
what regulations would be devel—
oped."

Farmers routinely perform
such operations as dehorning and
castrating their farm animals,
Avery said. but the board could re-
ouire that such operations be per-
. armed only by veterinarians,
which would be prohibitively ex-
pensive for many.

The 300 or so dairy farmers
who use the older, stanchion-type
barns, where cows are tethered to-
gether in long rows during the
winter, are concerned that the
board will require freer movement
of the cows, adding to their con—
struction and labor costs.

The proposed regulations come
at a time when ”developers are
knocking on everyone’s doors" 'in
western Massachusetts, Avery
said. In the past year, more than
100 dairy farms have gone out of
business, leaving 512 remaining
in the state.

Enforcement of the law would
cost between $500,000 and
$600,000 per year, according to
state Food and Agriculture Com-
missioner August Schumacher.
He estimated that modifying the
state’s stanchion barns would
cost about $90 million.

“Dairy farmers are in a precar-
ious enough situation economical-
ly,” SChumacher said. “Many
farmers are going to say who
needs the hassle? I can sell to a de-
veloper."

State Rep. Jonathan Healy (R-
Charlemont), a member of the
House Natural Resources Commit
tee and himself a dairy farmer
said that the Coalition to End Ani
mal Suffering and Exploitation

to set a national precedent.

“It’s clear to me that they've
done their surveys,” Healy said.
“This is a liberal state. and there’s
a very small farming constituen-
cy. Whv pick a place where thprp’g

only two veal farmers in the whole
darn state?”

Coalition member Steven
Ronan helped write the proposed
bill. He says that it has been mis-
understood by the farming com-
munity. and that it is actually in-
tended to help farmers by provid-
ing public support for humane
farming practices.

“If it passed, people could have
the security of knowing that farm
‘animals are better treated here
than in other states, and we
would have millions of people fo—
cusing on the problems that the
state's farmers have right now,"
Ronan said.

Farmers “have been told by
the Farm Bureau that this was in-
tended to make life miserable,”
Ronan said, “but we hoped it
would be helpful to farmers. In Eu-
ropean countries where minimum
disease standards had been estab-
lished, they’ve prevented disease
problems that are associated with
inhumane problems.”

The Legislature has until May
4 to act on the bill. If the Legisla-
ture rejects the bill or takes no ac-

Ken Avery bristles at the idea that he could be called inhumane.

tiOn, the coalition must obtain
8,421 additional signatures by
June 22 to get the question on the
ballot.

Healy said the Natural Re—
sources Committee is hoping the
coalition will withdraw the ballot
question and work with commit-
tee members on drafting more spe-
cific legislation that would apply
strictly to large veal and poultry
producers.

If the question winds up on the
ballot Avery Healy and Schu—
macher will all be spending the
summer traveling around the
state to discuss the potential im—
pact of the bill. Healy said the edu—
cational effort is likely to cost
about $3 million.

“Here we are, we've got to
spend all this time and money to
educate people in Fall River and
Boston that we’re not out here
beating our livestock,” Healy said.

“The sad part is that we all be-
lieve in what they’re doing."
Avery said. “It’s the method
they’re going about it. They‘re just
too radical.”

Animal adoptions
encouraged during
National Pet Week

United Press I ntematt'orwl

NEW YORK — Actor Alan Thicke, who beats the
drums for a pet parent program and pet adoption cru-
sade, hopes people without a founfooted furry friend
will think about adopting one during National Pet
Week, which begins today.

There is no shortage of adoptable cats and dogs.

Ten million pass through the doors of animal shel-
ters in the United States annually. Only 15 percent -—
1.5 million —— are. adopted.

Thicke, alias Jason Seaver of television’s “Growing
Pains.“ is pleading for a roof over the heads of millions
of homeless cats and dogs at risk of being put to sleep
this year.

“Fewer homeless animalscan mean happier chil-
dren," Thicke said.

“I’ve. seen for myself the special relationship that
can develop between a child and a pet,” he said. “Not
only does the child learn about responsibility, but he
learns important lessons about love and
companionship."

Thicke is celebrity chairman for the Purina Pet
Parent Program. a national pet education and pet adop-
tion campaign for elementary schoolchildren that this
year coincides with National Pet Week.

This spring, according to his estimates, more than 5
million kids, ages 8 to 12, in 37.000 schools will take
part in the Pet Parent Program that teaches humane
treatment of animals.

Through the adoption component of the program,
Purina is donating $500,000 to humane societies nation-
wide to subsidize pet adoptions during National Pet
Week, Thicke said.

The company is picking up part of the fee people
must pay when adopting an animal. The fees, usually
$25 to $40, typically cover part of the cost of shots or
other services provided to the animal.

In Thicke’s opinion. kids in the fourth grade are at
a great age for beginning to accept responsibility for a
pet. if parents are agreeable.

What if parents aren’t agreeable?

“Well, I think the kid should wage a little campaign,
saying they are able to accept the responsibilities in-
volved. helping to take care of the pet.

“Even if a parent does not resist the idea of a pet
for a child. there should be an understanding between
child and parents before a pet is adopted.

“The. lines of responsibility should be straightened
out."

The Pet Parent Program was developed by Lifetime
Learning Systems Inc. of Fairfield, Conn.

Roberta Nusim, president of the education compa-
ny. says having a pet is one of the greatest joys of child-
hood. It can also be one of a child‘s most valuable

learning experiences, she contends.

Students taking part in the Pet Parent instruction
explore their role as “parents" in providing daily food,
grooming and exercising pets. They also learn more
about companionship, on which both pets and people
thrive.

“Empathy and understanding is also gained as stu-
dents make the association between being a Pet Parent
and their parents' responsibility for taking care of
them,” Ms. Nusim said.

She agrees with Thicke that National Pet Week is a
wonderful time for students in the Pet Parent program
to get their families thinking about adopting a pet.

“Participating humane organizations across the
country are encouraging the adoption of puppies and
kittens by reducing their pet adoption fees," she noted.

“This reduced fee will enable parents to adopt a
‘best friend’ for their child at a very reasonable cost.”

A panel of experts helps oversee the pet education
and adoption program Thicke is promoting. These in-
clude six noted specialists in veterinary medicine, pet
therapy, psychologi, education and animal training.

The panel was selected with help from the Delta
Society, an international resource center on human-an-
imal interactions.

Aline Kidd, one of the authorities, is professor of
psychology at Mills College, Oakland, Calif, and senior
clinical psychologist for Lamorinda Psychological Asso- .
ciates in Lafayette, Calif.

Speaking of pets and children, she said:

“By providing love and companionship to a pet and
a thorough understanding of the responsibilities of dai-
ly pet care, children develop a deeper insight into the
value of life, good health and humane treatment of all
living creatures.” -

 




Bell Center Gets New Tenants: Three Yer

By Tom Uhlenbrock
0f the Post-Dispatch Staff

The window washers at 1 Bell
Center in downtown St. Louis got

some company Friday —- three"

young peregrine falcons.

The 44-story building, owned'by
Southwestern Bell, has been used
for the past four years as part of an
effort by the Raptor Rehabilitation
and Propagation Project to reintro-
duce the falcons to Missouri.

The project has released 18 fal-
cons —— counting the three new-
comers —— from a cage built on a
small terrace on the building’s 43rd
floor.

Michael J. Vaughan, assistant
manager of the building, said the
workers inside often spotted the
birds diving and soaring.

ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH - April 23, 1988

“It’s two-way glass, and they
sometimes will land on a, ledge and
respond to their own reflection,”
Vaughan said.

The birds also are protective of
their adopted home; they have
been known to dive bomb window
washers as the washers use scat-
folding to cling to the sides of the
building.

“I had an energy management
class outside on top and one of the
large birds flew down as if to say,
‘What are you doing here?’ "
Vaughan said. “When we built this
new cage, they hovered over the
top of the workers and hissed at
them.

“The birds will never hit you;
they just like to check you out. For
the most part, our contractors have

an affection for the birds." \
Walter J. Crawford Jr., director
of the raptor project, said the cage,
with its bird’s-eye view of the Gate-
way Arch and downtown. provides
a perfect aerie for the falcons.
“When it’s windy up here, it’s
amazing," Crawford said. “it. takes
two people to open that door."
Crawford said the falcon pro-
gram had been successful so far; of
the 15 birds previously released,
there has been only one known cas-
ualty. “That bird flew down a 250-
foot. smokestack at the brewery,"
Crawford said.
“They manage to get themselves
into some binds —-—— another one

flew down a ventilator shaft at the j 3;}.
stadium, and we had to get him
out," Crawford said. ' i

But he said the birds, which are
banded for identification, had been
returning after wintering in South
America and seemed right at home
in-St. Louis, dining on the, city’s pi-
geon population.

The goal of the peregrine pro
gram is to have the falcons some-
day nesting and breeding high atop
city buildings. Crawford said pere-
grines had not. bred in the wild in
Missouri for more than 100 years.

“We watch them from dawn to
dusk,» seven days a week all sum-

éﬁmer,” he said. “The people have

the unique opportunity, if they’re
chosen, to say ‘I helped bring an
endangered species back.’

“But they have to be committed.

This is a scientific project. And they
can’t be afraid of heights.”

crowing over
big-city life

Stray rooster
adopts a block

By Linda Heiser
The Arizona Republic

t is just after sunup as Herb,
1 swaggering like a puffed up peacock,
heads for the showdown.

Scratching in the dirt like a bull on the
brink of charging, he whirls and strikes
with all his might.

With lightning speed Herb scratches
and whirls again, landing a second mighty
blow directly on the head of his victim,
who stoically yields to this show of might.

There is little doubt that Herb, the
inner-city rooster, is still cock of the block
in this residential neighborhood.

The victim of this aggressive rebel
without a clue is a decorative, life-size
duck, which is fashioned out of plaster.
And it is a morning ritual, when Herb
isn‘t crowing, for him to stage unprovoked
pecking attacks on his ceramic yard mate.

“We really don’t even hear him crow
anymore, because we’re used to it,” said
Fran Leivian, in whose central Phoenix
front yard Herb has taken up part-time
residency. “We all love him so much that
it doesn’t bother anyone here.”

Herb appeared three years ago in the
neighborhood as a chick. “He had all of
his feathers, but he was still a pretty little
guy, and we figured he was a leftover from
someone’s Easter,” said Bob Leivian,
Fran’s husband.

Herb was named by neighbors in honor
of President Herbert Hoover, who, while
campaigning, promised a chicken for
every pot. The neighbors, however, think
there should be a rooster for every block.

“He’s our mascot here, and everyone
looks out for him,” Fran said.

From the very beginning, Herb was a
survivor. “We’d throw out some feed for
him but other than that, he was on his
own,” Bob said. “He even learned to crow
on his own.”

Because Herb did not learn this art at
the knee of a professional, he tends to
crow at inappropriate times. “He does
crow in the morning but also during the
day,” Fran said. “And sometimes, in the
middle of the night, a fire truck will go by
and wake him up with the siren, so he’ll
crow then, too. He has a wonderful crow.”

Herb circulates among several houses
on the block, maintaining a relatively
predictable schedule. “He waits to be fed
here, and then he’ll go next door and visit
that lady, and then go down a couple
houses and sit on their porch during the
day,” Fran said.

By evening, Herb has a snack at the
Leivian’s and then will mosey across the
street to roost 10 feet off the ground in an
orange tree.

“He drives me crazy even though he
seems to look both ways before crossing
the street,” Fran said. “But he takes his
time and goes so slowly that I just know
he’ll get hit.”

Flirting with death is nothing new to
Herb. “Cats won’t mess with him,” she
said. “In fact, our cats just hustle past him
because he’ll go after them. But dogs are a
different story.”

Three times stray dogs have attacked
Herb. “One time three of them had him
surrounded and really hurt him before
some man stopped in his car and chased
them off,” she said.

“There were hundreds of feathers in the
street, so one of *-the other neighbors

 

After his share of battles and his fill
of crackers, Herb offers a classic
pose for the camera.

picked up all the feathers so when the
children got home from school, they
wouldn’t think that Herb had been
killed.”

When he is injured, Fran said, he will
disappear for several days. “And then
suddenly, he’ll be back again,” she said.

Although Herb has earned respect from
the neighbors for his staying power, he has
not broken any records for friendliness.
“My daughter calls him a turkey because
he peeks at her,” David Robb said. “And
once, I almost took him to work with me
because if you leave a car door open, he’ll
hop right in.”

It is on the Robb porch that Herb
spends his afternoons. “He’ll just come
right up and peck on the door and try to
get in if we leave the door Open,” said Nan
Robb, David’s wife. “So I give him Wheat
Thins because those are his favorites. He
hates corn flakes.”

Nan said that many passers-by presume
that Herb is yet another example of the
current country-look craze in home
decorating. “You know how they sell all
those stuffed chickens and roosters,” she
said. “Well, they think Herb is one of
them,- so when he moves and crows,
people go crazy.”

Athough Nan is a die-hard fan of
Herb’s, she is not wild about the fairly
good-size mementos he deposits at her
doorstep after munching crackers.

“But we love him here,” she said.

Herb, after all, is only human.

Some doubts about dolphin-swimming

By Edward Flattau

Most people who have swum in the same tank with
captive dolphins consider the event an experience of a
lifetime. But are these encounters all that gratifying for
the highly intelligent sea mammals?

Defenders of this relatively new form of
entertainment contend that the dolphins seem to enjoy
the fratemization every bit as much as the human
beings. Many environmental organizations, however,
perceive a major potential for abuse.

There has been no exhaustive study of the long—term
effect that daily close contact with human beings has
on dolphins. Moreover, the National Marine Fisheries
Servicee, which issues permits authorizing the capture
and display of dolphins, has yet to establish
standardized regulations to assure humane treatment
of the sea mammals.
~ What groups such as Greenpeace and the Humane
Society of the United States most fear is that this
immensely popular (and, one might add, extremely
proﬁtable) activity will proliferate throughout the ‘
country as every two-bit hotel and motel seeks to
enhance its appeal. ‘ .

Declining dolphin populations in the wild would
then be faced with additional pressures, as well as
third-rate accomodations in captrvrty.

At present, only three sites in the nation have
permission from the marine fisheries service to
conduct swim—with—dolphin programs, and they are all
located within 50 miles of each other in the Florida
Keys.

Three new dolphin-swim applications are pending
before the service, however, including one from the
Hyatt Regency Waikoloa Resort in Hawaii.

Most environmental organizations haVe no objection
to a hi ly selective process which allows a few non—
proﬁt acilities to research the interaction between
humans and dolphins purely for educational purposes
and under careful supervision.

But Dr. Susan Lieberman of the Humane Society
goes so far as to suggest that such activities should
only be licensed if accredited by universities.

The three facilities-in operation insist that they fit
the environmentalists’ criteria. While at least two of
the three establishments mainly support themselves
through receipts from the dolphin—swim attraction (at
$50. a dip), they all maintain that they are primarily

environmental affairs columnist.

educational institutions which realize little or no profit.

They point to the strict rules they have imposed to
protect dolphins’ health. A rigidly-adhered—to limit is
placed on the number of swimmers and the duration
spent mingling with the creatures. And a section of the
pool is declared off limits to humans so that the
dolphins can retreat to privacy whenever they wish.

Mandy Rodriguez, director of the Dolphin Research
Center on Marathon Key, boasts that the maximum
each of his ll captive dolphins is exposed. to
swimmers is three hours a week.

The managers of the three facilities also note that
the dolphins have always been gentle with human
visitors (the creatures are constantly monitored for any

essive tendencies or stress), and there is no
evrdence of transmission of any diseases.

Certainly, the experience has been salutary for
human bern . Rodri ez can even point to noticeable
therapeutic nefits at mentally retarded children
have attained from their time with dolphins at his site.

There is also little dispute that such operations are a
valuable tool in building public 3 pathies for
preservation of the creatures in t e wild.

Nonetheless, some animal rights groups believe no
sea mammals should be removed from their natural
habitat.

“To put an intelli ent cetacean who is used to
swimming in the wi d into a tank is like putting a
human in a closet,” says Scott Timingharn of the Sea
Shepherd Conservation Society in Redondo Beach,

- Calif.

The dolphin handlers concede that their charges '
raised in captivity tend to be more docile and reliable
than counterparts in the wild. Thus, a tank or sealed-
off lagoon is undoubtedly not the best place to
perpetuate the original genuine article.

Assuming strict management regulations are
imposed and permits are granted sparingly to.
minimize exploitation of wild pepulations, the future
operations that emerge should probably resemble the
Dolphin Research Center. It is the only one of the
three facilities that actually provides dolphins any
access to the open sea.

Captive recruits have frequently jumped a low fence
enclosing the center’s swim area and raced out into the
Gulf of Mexico to catch fish or even frolick with some
of their wild Cousins. With one exception, however,
they have always returned.

Hence, wherever the dolphins enjoy the same
freedom of entry as their human vrsitors, we can be
certain that the creatures are our true friends rather
than amiable prisoners of circumstance.

of ﬂuff named Molloko, the only
California condor chick conceived
in captivity, gobbled minced mice,
and keepers of the endangered spe-
cies were encouraged by its appe-
tite.

The newly hatched chick, which

raised the condor population to 28,
ate rts first meal from the fingertips
of a handler at 6 am. Saturday and
ate again at hourly intervals, said
Martha Baker, spokeswoman for the
San Diego Wild Animal Park. ' '

Molloko is an Indian word for
the grant condor species.

Giant worm
has turned
town around

KORUMBURRA, Australia
(AP)—-The federal government has
chipped in $11,000 to help save the
gurgling earthworm, a 12—foot her—
maphrodite with 16 hearts that has
transformed Korumburra from a
near ghost town to a bustling tour-
ist attraction.

The great Gippsland gurgling
earthworm, now listed as an en—
dangered species, is so named be-
cause of the sucking and gurgling
noises it makes when it burrows—
something like a. bathtub draining.

Townsfolk say the earthworm
helped turn their fortunes around.
They show their appreciation with
an annual worm festival called Kar-
mai, the abori inal word for giant
earthworm. Hed each March, it in-
cludes parades, carnivals and an
earthworm queen.

Korumburra began exploiting the . " g; .
earthworm as a tourist attraction in 911?; f
I977 after the local coal mine went ‘

,5 bankrupt, a butter plant shut down
and young people began heading to
Melbourne in search of jobs.

“The worm saved the town,” said
Mark Holmes. “The worm helped
people have an identity.”

Visitors now ﬂock to Korumbur-
ra, population 2,800. The town’s
shops display fluffy toy worms and ' ‘ ' ‘ ' - -

LOS ANGELES TIMES - April 16, 1988

Alan Thicke .
Goes to the ,
Dog Wash

here’s actually a science to the

I SUpposedly unskilled labor of sepa-

rating your dog‘from several kilos of

rug fluff, loose hair, retired bugs, Kibble
crumbs and back-yard dirt.

“You don’t nozzle dogs,” actor Alan
Thicke explained. “I pail ’em. It’s also nice
to warm the water first. . . . I think it is
more comfortable for the dog to be at room
temperature. '

“Besides, you never know what’s coming
out of hoses in the Valley.”

And there is more, much more, as Thicke
and a company of personalities large
(Dennis Franz of “Beverly Hills Buntz” TV
series) and small (Brian Bonsall, 6, who
plays Andy Keaton on “Family Ties”) start
brushing up on techniques for next Satur-
day’s Celebrity Dog Wash on the back lot
at Universal Studios.

There is, Thicke continued, the prepara-
tion; “I think the washer is as important as
the washee here, and the important rule of
dog washing is . .. . sensible clothes.”

Cl

Comes the mind—set: “You can’t go into it
tentatively. You have to climb into the
trenches and get down-and-dirty when
you wash a dog. It is one of those things in
' life that requires your full concentration.”

The execution: “Both hands, both arms,
because you just can’t do a three-fingered
dog wash. If you get a decent-size dog it’s
going to be the best of three falls.”

The end result: “M utt wrestling.”

Asstar of the Successful family sitcom
“Growing Pains,” Thicke has become
something of a national father figure, an
Ozzie Nelson of the ’80s. So he has been
named parent and/ or father of the year by
at least three major organizations.

As host of “Animal Crack-Ups,” a chil-
dren’s series, Thicke also is ascending to

. the "crown of Dr. Dolittle. Hence his
appointment as celebrity chairperson of the

, Purina PetParent Program.
The ‘overall campaign aims at finding
i home:~ for. more than 300,000 shelter ani-
i mals mis‘vyear. Purina will approach all
, sides of the national problem by, educating
youngsters in pet care, by donating
$500,000 to selected animal shelters, which
will supply the children and by publicizing
the continuing need of stray and dumped
pets through . well, a Celebrity Dog

Wash. . - -_-....... ~

 

 

The sudsing is free, is open to any pet
whose owner cares to call for a reservation.
Some squeaky-clean dogs will be available
for adoption, and the two-hour event will
be staffed by experienced dog handlers in
addition'to celebrity docents.

Thicke is stiff with credentials for his
unpaid position. ‘

He grew up with ,a dachshund called
Heidi and a French poodle called Pierre in'a
Canadian family that “wasn’t too original
with names.” In Los Angeles in 1970, there
was Beliveau, a stray cat named after Big
Jean the hockey player.

Then came marriage and Sable, a Pom-
eranian. She went with the 1984 divorce.
Thicke and Gloria Loring have joint custo-
dy of their two sons. Permanent custody of
Sable went to Thicke’s brother, writer
Todd. 1 C]

Now, and since Christmas, the most
energetic resident of Thicke’s new Toluca
Lake home is Christopher, a shepherd-
and - collie mutt.

He was adopted for the best and most
serious of reasons—as a buddy for Thicke’s
sons, Brennan, 12, and Robin, 10.

“A puppy gives them a sense of purpose
and suddenly they are responsible for
something other than themselves,” Thicke
said. “Brennan gets a real sense of humani-
ty from the dog, literally a; sense of
parenting. With everybody else, boys will
be boys. But with pets, boys will be
mothers.”

A dog was also a deliberate accessory of
Thicke’s new life.

“I got divorced and [his talk show]
canceled in the same year and my life had
got out of control,” he remembered. “When
all that happens, you start to restructure.
That included priority (A) get the children
accustomed to the transition, (B) get your
career on track, (C) find suitable lodgings

. . and then get a dog.”

With all those elements in place, he said,
there may now be room for the final
structure; A relationship:

“I only got a dining room table two .'

to sit somebody down.”

j Logging ls Halted
Near Redwood Forest

The 9th US Circuit Court of Ap-
peals has ordered California timber
companies to stop cutting trees sur—
rounding giant redwoods in the Sequoia
National Forest, ruling that the US.
Forest Service did not meet environ-
mental requirements when awarding the
1ogging contracts.

About 400 acres are included in the
nine sales contracts challenged by the
Sierra Club last May. The contracts per-
mit loggers to clear-cut all nonredwood
vegetation in speciﬁed areas. The For—
est Service claimed this logging method
would enhance the regeneration of the
sequoias. The conservationist group
countered that clear—cutting around red-
woods destroys their habitat, hampers
regeneration and endangers the water
quality of nearby streams.

“Reversing a lower federal court ’5 rul-
ing, a three-judge panel of the San
Francisco-based court concluded that
an environmental impact statement
should have been prepared and issued a
preliminary injunction against further
cutting. But the ruling came after some

On patented mouse, let reason rule 5 ,_

The first patent for a genetically engineered ani-
mal—a mouse created by Harvard University scien-
tists—predictably provoked new protests from en-
vironmentalists and bureaucrats.

Although such reactions to the quickening pace of
biotechnology advances have become common, fears
of turning the animal kin dom upside down or of
handing the ownership of ture life to the giants of
corporate America ring particularly hollow and hyster-
ical in the case of this genetically altered mouse. By
adding a human cancer gene to mice embryos, re-
searchers have built a creature that could accelerate
the development of treatments for cancer.

Concerns about the emergence of the extraordinary
new technology of genetic engineering, of course, are
broader. Taken in totality, the rapid advances in trans-
forming animals and fish, the gains made in cloning
large farm animals and proposals to begin to map the
full range of human genes in a cell conjure up images
of future human parents ordering tailor-made babies
and of technology out of control.

More immediate worries are voiced about ecological
balance, animal rights and the political question of
who should be setting public policy in this emotional,
sensitive area. Not surprisingly, even before the cancer-
prone mouse was created in Harvard laboratories,
Congress had introduced two bills to suspend granting
animal patents for two years. On issues where
lawmakers fear the unknown, don’t know how to react
to difficult problems or are taking a lot of heat from
vocal constituents, they have opted increasingly to do
nothing for awhile and meditate about the issues.

In the case of animal patents, a moratorium would
mean that private industry would stop doing valuable
research in the United States that it could not protect.

laboratories would go abroad where other countries
such as Britain, Holland and Japan are funding major
biotech projects and granting animal patents.

The issue of whether patent law should be applied to
living matter has been addressed in this country. In
1980, the Supreme Court ruled that genetically altered
micro-organisms could be patented. Three years ago,
the patent oﬂice extended the decision to plants, and,
last' year, to genetically improved animals bred by
farmers. 'The Harvard mouse patent is a logical exten—
sion of these past decisions. But the patent ofﬁce has
made it clear, and reiterated its position last week, that
it doesn’t intend to extend the logic to human patents.

Biotechnology is an emerging industry in which the
United States has a dominant global position and the
opportunity to improve human health and the rehabil-
ity and efficiency of agriculture. Scientists believe ge—
netic engineering soon will produce animals that give
cheaper and more nutritious meat and dairy products,
crops that are more resistant to disease and new drugs
to treat diabetes, heart attacks, cancer and AIDS.

To achieve these developments, companies must
have a way to protect their investments in research
and innovation. The patent office has acted responsi—
bly and must be allowed to evaluate the other 21
animal patents that are pending. It would be a travesty
for Congress to halt this process. If it does, the eco-
nomic, social and scientific benefits of biotechnology
will likely be lost to foreign competition.

Political leaders and scientists should not succumb
to an atmosphere of fear and controversy that is so
easy to manufacture in today’s society. Regulations are
in place. laws are evolving slowly. What is needed
from Washington, business and the scientific commu—
nity is a long-term strategy that will ensure that
biotechnology can deliver the benefits it promises.

Dear Pat:

I know you say you believe animals should be used in research,
but I hope you will also keep an open mind and listen to what
others think — especially some doctors and veterinarians.

Enclosed is an article from the Detroit News.

.Also, I have written previously on patents on man—made animal
breeds. .After listening to radio broadcasts over the weekend
on the killer bees wending their way to Georgia, and hearing
that these bees are the direct result of man's interference
in South.America in 1957 when he crossed two different species
of bees in order to get more honey, then I realized that man
has no business whatsoever messing around with genetic engin-
eering.

Now just suppose this genetically altered mouse gets loose one
day from.the research laboratory. There is simply no way of
knowing what damage can or will be done to other animals.

Of course, as long as many can get the NIH to advance him/her
thousands of dollars for a project he thinks MIGHT just help
hu.mans, he is going to continue with all kinds of experiments.

When we all live to be a hundred or more, where and how are we
going to live? What will be the quality of life for humanity
when the population of the world is doubled or even tripled?
What will happen to the environment so that man can build ever
more houses and apartments? Will we be living one on top of
the other with no green spaces left for relaxation? That may
be what some people want, but I fail to see any advantage to
this type of existence.

Sincerely,

CMrS.) Constance F. Yarbrough

'In’ his March 20 letter, “Human Cures Through
Animal Research,” Steven Carroll, executive director of
incurably ill for Animal Research, offers once again a
stock argument to defend biomedical experiments on
animals. Because we have great sympathy for his cause,
we feel we must set the record straight. Mr. Carroll's
argument depends both on a moral confusion and a

mistake about factual matters.

First, to the confusion. Mr. Carroll thinks nothing

else is necessary to prove that animal experimentation is
, justified than pointing to the alleged good results. Many
‘- people agree with Carroll that these experiments have
2 led people to valuable medical beneﬁts, and yet they
« oppose further experiments. They believe. and most. of
us would agree, that good ends do not justify any means.
' Whether they are right or wrong, many thoughtful
- persons oppose animal experiments for moral reasons.

Among these opponents are the Disabled Against
Animal Research and Exploitation (DAREl, located in

" Maryland, and the Disabled and Incurably Ill for

Alternatives to Animal Research, with headquarters in
California. . .

Second, the factual mistakes. Mr. Carroll’s view that 4

It is only through the maximal exploitation of current .

Horrors at The
Slaughterhouse

WASHINGTON — In “The Slaughterer,”
a short story by Isaac Bashevis Singer, Ypi-
neh Meir wanted to be a rabbi. Instead, the
Hasidim in the old country appointed him
the ritual slaughterer. An obedient Meir
studied the laws of slaughter as found in
sacred texts. He took holy instruments ——
knives, a whetstone - and followed the Ha-
sidim’s command.- ' ,

“Barely three months had passed since
Yoineh Meir had become a slaughterer,”
Singer wrote, “but the time seemed to
stretch endlessly. He felt as though he were
immersed in blood and lymph. His ears
were beset by the squawking of hens, the
crowing of roosters, the gobbling of geese,
the lowing of oxen, the mooing and bleating
of calves and goats; wings fluttered, claws
tapped on the floor. The bodies refused to
know any justification or excuse —- every
body resisted in its own fashion, tried to
escape, and seemed to argue with the Cre-
ator to its last breath.”

Yoineh Meir, whose life would end in
madness, also could not escape: “The kill-
ing of every beast, great or small, caused
him as much pain as though he were cut-
ting his own throat. Of all the punishments
that could have been visited upon him
slaughtering was the worst.” .

Fiction was reality last week when the
House Committee on Government Opera-
tions reported on the punishments of work-
ers in U.S. slaughterhouses. Findings
document that Yoineh Meir might well
have been an American worker. Slaughter-
ing remains the worst: ,

o No other U.S. industry, including coal
mining or construction, has a higher injury
or illness rate. Nearly a third of its employ—
ees suffer job-related injuries or illnesses
annually, compared to one-tenth for manu-
facturing workers. The United Food and
Commerical Workers Union states that
58,000 slaughterhouse employees are in-
jured a year, about 160 a day.

0 Annual turnover rates between 60 and
100 percent are common in many plants. In
a recent 12-year period, a company that
employs 15,000 people had only 48 hourly
production personnel who worked long
enough to earn retirement benefits.

0 At a Dakota City, Neb., plant where
3,200 cattle are killed and dissembled daily,
a union vice president describes the condi-
tions of butchery: “Workers stand in a sea
of blood.... Nearly all workers stand .on
treacherously slippery floors covered with
animal fat buildup, which provides a situa-
tion where workers slip frequently.... Lines
of people stand side-by-side with approxi~
mately 48 inches of working space between
them. Nearly all the workers wield razor-
Shi‘sr'p knives and power tools... Because of

, the breakneck chain speeds and close work-
_ ing conditions, workers frequently are acci-
dently stabbed by their neighbors.”
Depictions of gore aside, few surprises
are in this report. Workers’ lives, rights and
feelings are valued only slightly higher than
the animals they are poorly paid to kill and
hack. Companies underreport injuries. The
Occupational Health and Safety Administra~
tion is too understaffed to enforce what
weak safety laws there are. Companies wel-
come high turnover -— it- means less outlay
for benefits, pensions and vacation pay.
' Ravening for profits is rampant. Between
1981 and 1986, conveyor speed at one large
plant increased more than 22 percent, from
225 bodies an hour to 275. '

In the best traditions of tsk-tsk alarm,
the committee’s recommendations for re-
form are a weak stew of shoulds and musts.
“OSHA should mount a comprehensive-
campaign” to investigate the high-injury
rate. No company should be exempt from
inspections. OSHA must.... Somebody
should.

Left unquestioned is the rational for
slaughtering animals in the first place. An
average of 9 million cows, calves, pigs,
sheep, horses, buffalo, chickens, turkeys
and ducks are killed a day in the carnage
rite of satisfying flesh-eating Americans.
Cultural conditioning is involved, ranging
from the falsity that meat supplies protein.
unavailable elsewhere to the lie that ani-
mals have no rights. To hidethe grislineSs,
euphemisms abound. Blood is “gravy.”
Slaughterhouses are “meatpacking plants.”
A slice of a hog corpse is ”fresh pork.”
Pig’s testicles are “Rocky Mountain Oys-
ters.”

If an allegedly civilized society can
chew up the language as it chews on 9 mil-

' lion animal cadavers a day, why is it a sur-

prise that the hired slaughterers are abused
worse than other U.S. workers?

If an allegedly civilized Society‘can‘chew up "the '

language as it chews on 9 million animal cadavers

a day, why is it a surprise that the hired-

slaughterers are abused worse than other U.S.
workers? Flesh-eaters keep the workers as far
out of sight as they do the idea of swallowing
pieces of animal corpses out of mind.

This isn’t some arcane code bf animal-rights’
morality. It’s a recognition of a hard truth that

_ Isaac Bashevis Singer, a Nobel laureate and one

whose diet is animal-free, embraced: “Those who
eat meat share in the guilt, but since they’re not
conscious of the actual slaughter, they believe it
is a natural thing. . . . I would say that it would be
better for humanity to stop eating meat and stop

torturing these animals. I always say that if we

don’t stop treating these animals the way we do,

we will never have any rest.”

 

Dogcatcher
Quits Over
Dog’s Death

By Terry J. Hughes
Of the Post-Dispatch Staff

A dogcatcher in Ozark, Mo., has re-
signed in the face of a public outcry
over his killing a stray dog by club-
ibing it and running over it with a
pickup truck. '

The dogcatcher, John Bross, 38,
ggave his resignation to Mayor Neal
:Grubach Wednesday afternoon. At a
special meeting that night, the City
Council accepted the resignation,
Grubach said. -

Bross was suspended from his job
after the incident, which happened
March 10. He was reinstated April 4,
four days after he was convicted of a
charge of cruelty to animals; he was
fined $117 and ordered to perform 10
hours of community service.

Humane Society officials across
southwestern Missouri protested the
reinstatement, saying they believed
Grubach had agreed to fire Bross if
he was convicted.

As recently as Monday, Grubach
and the City Council refused to bow to
the pressure to fire Bross from the
part-time job, which paid $500 a
month. Instead, the mayor reinstated
Bross and placed him on a six-months
probationary status with the warning
that he would be fired if a similar
incident occurred.

A man who answered the tele-
phone at Bross’ home Thursday night
refused to relay an interview request
to the former dog catcher.

The man~added, “On the advice of
his counsel, he is not making any fur-
ther statements, especially to the
'news media.”

On March 10, Bross was called out

i to catch a stray beagle that had been

the subject of nuisance complaints
for about two months. A witness at
Bross’s trial said Bross had caught the
dog by its collar, had hit the dog sev-
eral times with a two-foot-long club

g and had run over the dog three times

before it stopped wimpering.

The mayor said Wednesday that he
had not asked Bross to resign. Gru-
bach also refused to discuss details of

" the case.

Zoo finally getting a roar of approval

But even without the whimsical
characters from the mythical zoo of
children’s writer Dr. Seuss, The Zoo
— one of the newest zoos in the na-
tion with a fourth birthday on May
19 — has plenty to make people talk
and gawk:

IJuergen Hergert, a West Ger-
man reptile expert, spent 100 days
in a room full of poisonous snakes
two years ago. He came out unbit-
ten but bleary-eyed from sleepless
nights in bed with heat-seeking
serpents.

lEllie Phant, an 800-pound
baby pachyderm, last year was
loaned to a pair of newlyweds who
wanted to arrive at their hotel with
an extra trunk.

IA feed-the-animals policy is in
effect, as long as visitors use only
dry pellets sold by The Zoo, at a
petting area and at certain other
exhibits including a giraffe tower
where people can get an eyeball-to-
eyeball look at the long-necked
creatures.

I Syria, a Bengal tiger, died last
December from a mysterious AIDS-
like illness a day before two cubs
he fathered were born.

I Colossus, weighing at least 550
pounds and billed as the largest
lowland gorilla in captivity, took his
ﬁrst steps into a spacious outdoor
enclosure March 18 after spending
the past 20 years in a small indoor
cage at a now-defunct facility in
New Hampshire.

For Quinn, 51, The Zoo has
been the culmination of a dream
not unlike that of author-illustrator

Theodor Seuss Geisel’s imaginative

Gerald McGrew. .

“I always knew even when I
was a child, I always wanted to
work with animals,” said Quinn,
who grew up in Knoxville and the
nearby hills of eastern Tennessee.

As a youngster he caught, raised
and hunted wild animals and con-

tinued his hobby as a soldier in Ko- ;

rea, where he kept a menagerie

that included deer, hawks and *

eagles. -

Quinn began working on the '

idea of a 200 in nearby Pensacola

back in 1960 with the Northwest
Florida Zoological Society. He left
to work at a children’s zoo in San
Francisco and nothing came of the
idea until seven years later when
Quinn returned to help the society
start a small zoo in Cantonment,
north of Pensacola. .

But it was in the wrong place —
too far from the city and tourist-at-
tracting beaches — and at the
wrong time.

“People just weren’t thinking
zoo at that time,” Quinn said.

Now, he says, “people are more
aware of the environment and en-
dangered species.”

The small zoo folded after
Quinn went back to California in
1970 to join Lion Country Safari.
Six years later, Quinn started his
own zoological consu1ting business
in Beverly Hills, Calif, conducting
African safaris and bringing ani-
mals back to the United States.

His clients included Benson’s
Animal Park in Hudson, NH,
where he first met Colossus.

The path toward their reunion
began when Quinn was on safari in
Kenya with two Pensacola physi-
cians who had been active in the 10-
cal zoological society, Drs. James
Potter and Tom Birdwell.

“I said, ‘I’d like to come back to
Pensacola. The area needs 'a zoo
badly. It’s a zoological desert,’ ”
Quinn recalled. , . . -

Museum in Pensacola, Quinn said.
The arrival of Colossus, pur-
chased from Benson’s by The Zoo’s
New Hampshire partners, helped
double March attendance. Qumn

expects 130,000 visitors this year.

Quinn makes no apologies for
the park’s ambitious name and bris-

ties

at the

suggestion it is

unimaginative.
“The name, in fact, is quite im-

aginative . . .

since this is the only

zoo we’ve got,” he said. “We wanted
The Zoo to be everybody’s zoo.”

Pat Quinn checks out his newest attraction, Colossus, a gorilla.

The nearest major zoo is in New
Orleans, 200 miles away. .

The trio formed The Animal
Park Inc. with a pair of New Hamp-
shire businessmen, Prentice Robin-
son and Ronald Hutch, and Dr.
Donald Dooley, a California veteri-

narian. Quinn is president and the

other investors are on the board of
directors. Quinn’s wife, Donna, and
aptly named son. Noah, 18, also
work at The Zoo.

Quinn envisioned a simple,
small and clean zoo.

“What I’ve done is built 3 mon-
ster here,” Quinn said with a smile.

It is neither simple nor small,
with more than 250 animals cover-
ing 20 acres in the unincorporated
community of Midway about 10

miles east of Gulf Breeze. Thirty'

more acres are available for
expansion.

About 500,000 people live within
a 50 mile radius, but at first they
were skeptical, thinking it was an-
other roadside stop with small,
dirty pens, Quinn said.

“We are anything but that,” he
said.

The Zoo has large outdoor en-
closures, ponds and monkey islands,

Fans of wolves ﬁght bad rap on pets image

By Tom Boone
OF THE TIMES HERALD STAFF

 

Ever since Little Red Riding
Hood spoke those immortal
words, “My, Grandma, what big
teeth you have!" wolves have had
to contend with a truly crummy
public image.

The Three Little Pigs didn’t
help any, whining about being
gobbled up and all.

Someone has always been try-
ing to “keep the wolf from the
door.“

In short, said Scott Carruth of
DeSoto, wolves have taken a big,
bad rap.

Carruth and his wife, Teresa, a
veterinarian. own Willow Run
Kennels on Parkerville Road.
The Carruths raise wolves for
sale. and this week he and a few
other wolf fans in the Dallas area
formed the Aniwaya Wolf Club.
the area’s ﬁrst organization for
wolf breeders.

WOLVES

From B-l

 

Carruth, who also raises Labra—
dor retrievers, says he sells wolf
cubs, for $450 each, faster than
he sells dogs. The buyers are
among a growing number of peo-
ple who realize wolves aren’t the
vicious beasts depicted in litera-
ture and Lon Chaney movies,
Carruth says.

“They make great pets," Car-
ruth says. “They’re real social
and structured animals. And
they‘re very intelligent.”

They’re also as playful as any
dog. Witness Nakaiya, a 9-week-
old black Canadian timber wolf
who loves to romp with the Car—
ruths” cat, Max, and their minia-
ture schnauzer. She also enjoys
being held like a baby and lick—
ing Teresa Carruth’s face.

Nakaiya, like the four other
wolves the Carruths are raising,
isn’t 100 percent purebred. But
she‘s close, 97 percent, Carruth
says.

“Wolves are considered an en-
»dangered species, so it’s against
lithe law to own a purebred wolf.

You could get sent to prison if
you‘re caught," Carruth says.

Nevertheless, there are com—
mercial breeders who will breed
purebred wolves with dogs, usu-
ally malamutes, huskies and
sometimes German shepherds, to
come up with the ideal mixture
of wolf and dog.

Except for Nakaiya, the Car—
ruths’ animals are one-half to 75
percent wolf, Carruth said.

Wolves‘ colors range from
white to black. “They’re all sizes
and shapes," Carruth says. “Some
are kind of rangy. There are 27
different strains in North Ameri-
ca. The Asiatic wolf will get to
about 50 pounds, and a McKen-
zie Valley wolf could grow to 175
pounds“

Alex, a cross between a
McKenzie Valley wolf and a ma]-
amute, weighs about 125 pounds
and, upright, stretches higher
than 6 feet.

Despite his size and regal bear-
ing, he shrinks from strangers.

“Wolves are timid,” Carruth
says. “They’re not displaying
submission. they’re just timid.
They‘re not. that way around
dogs or other wolves, just around
people. I think that‘s one of the
reasons they have survived in the

Brought up correctly —— that is,

taught early and regularly to so—
cialize with humans and other.

animals —— wolves make excel-
lent companions and are good
with children, Carruth says. “But
I would really not want to put an
adult wolf in a family with chil-
dren.“

Adult wolves, in demand for
breeding purposes, often bring
$1,500 to $2,500 apiece, Carruth
says, although he sometimes sells
them for as little as $600. “My
main interest is in finding them a
good home,” he says.

The Carruths have been raising
wolves for 10 years, but it has
been only recently that public in-
terest has become fairly wide—
spread. Unfortunately, he says,
he gets a lot of calls from people
who want to know if one of his
wolves “will beat up the pit bull—
dog next door.”

Carruth’s animals aren’t neigh-
borhood bully candidates, he
says. Despite their reputation,
wolves aren’t aggressive. Some-
times, one might inherit a testy
nature from being part German
shepherd.

“But that‘s the dog coming out,
not the wolf," Carruth says.

CHICAGO TRIBUNE - April 24, 1988

 

Wild horse adoptions
riding into sunset?

Critics say program is inhumane

By Rogers Worthington

Chicago Tribune

MINNEWAUKAN FLATS,
N.D.—A few caracasses still lay
sprawled on the sere northern
rangeland, a stark reminder of the
110 horses that died of hunger and
thirst here this winter—one more
setback in a federal wild horse
adoption program that critics say
has gone terribly wrong.

“This is a farming and ranching
community, people who grew up
with animals and take good care of
them,” said Benson County Sheriff
Ned Mitzel, who was among the
first to discover the animals’ plight.
“When they see abuse like that,
they get real upset.”

It. was the worst abuse case in the
history of the controversial adop-
tion program. Largely as a result of
it, the federal Bureau of Land
Management two weeks ago sus-
pended the adOption program, in
which large numbers of wild horses
were handed over free to people
who agreed to care for them for a
year.

After that, the new owners could
dispose of the animals as they
wished. Animal-rights advocates
contend that, for most horses, the
program was merely a delayed con—
duit to the slaughterhouse, where a
1,000—pound horse can bring be-
tween $200 and $400.

“No one takes 400 wild horses
because they’re going to train them
to the buggy and saddle,” said
Sheila Bichler, a Grand Forks,
ND, member of the Humane So—
ciety of the United States, who vis-
ited the Minnewaukan Flats
pasture.

Earlier this month, federal ofﬁ—
cials seized 27] horses here, appar—
ently all that remained of 400 hors—
es adopted by two North Dakota
ranchers last July. The field in
which the horses had been forced
to survive had almost no water,
and had only high alkaline “cheat”
grass, a tough wheat straw with lit—
tle nutritional value.

The surviving animals, many of
them severely emaciated, were
shipped to a holding facility in
Bloomﬁeld, Neb. The US. attor—
ney’s ofﬁce in Fargo is investigat—
ing the two adopters, Jerry
Cudworth of Sheyenne and Glenn

DeLorme of Fort Totten.

The case has drawn renewed at—
tention to the confounding dilem—
ma of how to manage the nation’s
estimated 38,000 wild horses,
which have no natural predators
and are protected by law. To keep
the herds from overpopulating and
overgrazing, the Bureau of Land
Management periodically conducts
roundups.

There are more than 8,500 wild
horses corralled at the agency’s fa—
cilities in Bloomfield and Lovelock,
Nev., at a per diem cost per horse
of $2.25, according to agency ofﬁ-
cials. Since 1980, more than $92
million has been spent on the ef-
fort, the ofﬁcials said.

“That could buy a lot of school
lunches,” said Robert Buford, the
agency’s director.

Although the adoption program
has been suspended, ofﬁcials said.
the agency will continue corralling
wild horses, and will deliver 7,000
animals already committed to ap—
proved adopters.

When the program began in
1976, individuals paid an adoption
fee of $125 a horse and could
adopt up to four animals. But in
1984, when the corral population
ballooned to 18,000, the agency
started to waive the fee and per-
mitted applicants to adopt horses
in the names of other people by
obtaining their powers of attomey.

Cudworth and DeLorme, for ex—
ample, convinced 98 Sioux Indians
on the Fort Totten reservation to

've them powers of attorney. Dur—
ing the last ﬁscal year, 12,776 hors-
es were adopted—and two-thirds of
them were by large-scale adopters.

Only the large-scale adoption
program has been suspended; the
small scale program continues.

The wild horses are mixed breeds
descended from horses brought to
North America by Spanish
colonists. During the Depression,
the herds grew when hard-put
ranchers and farmers in Nevada,
Wyoming and other Western states
set loose horses they could not af-
ford to feed.

Environmentalists argue that the
herds should be managed on the
range. Robert Hillman, chief in-
vestigator for the Animal Protec-
tion Institute of America, says the
adoption program violates the wild

horse protection act, which prohi-
bits sale of the animals for com-
merCIal purposes.

Agency ofﬁcials argue that, once
title is turned over to an adopter at
the end of a year’s supervised cus-
tody, the animal’s fate is not its
concern.

In December, 1986, an advisory
board of the departments of agri—
culture and interior recommended
euthanasia for any horse not adop-
ted within 90 days. But the House
Appropriations Committee later
barred the use of federal funds for
this purpose.

Further complicating matters, a
Reno US. District Court judge or-
dered the bureau last July not to
turn horses over to adopters when

they know the intention is to sell
them to slaughterhouses.

Burford described himself as “be—
tween a rock and a hard place,” in
March 1 testimony before the
House Interior Committee on Na-
tional Parks and Public Lands. He
asked that Congress review the
laws protecting wild horses.

One solution he is not likely to
support—nor is Congress—is legis—
lation proposed by the Office of
Management and Budget to enable
direct auctions of excess wild hors—
es. Congressional staffers privately
refer to the proposal as “the Alpo
amendment.”

Instead, the bureau is banking its
hopes on other efforts, such as the

Sheba The Chimp
Shows Command

0f Numbers Game

COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -— Sheba isn’t a typical 6-
year-old just because she likes candy, playing with the
telephone and coloring.

Sheba is a chimpanzee who knows howto count.

The chimp lives at Ohio State University’s animal
laboratory. She is one of only two monkeys in the world
that can count, and the only one that understands the
concept of zero, said Sally Boysen, who directs the lab’s
primate cognition project.

In an interview last week, Boysen said she believed
that that ability was a major step forward in defining the
cognitive processes of higher primates and their similar-
ities to those of humans. She said the ability to count
objects involved a different cognitive process than learn-
ing languages.

'Boysen took part in early studies that showed that
higher primates can learn language. More than a decade
ago, Koko, a female gorilla, and Washoe, a female

chimp, learned to use sign language to communicate
with humans.

But counting is a new research goal and a hobby that
Sheba indulges in when she is not playing with her
keepers, with the four other apes at the lab or with
Boysen’s dog, Schuyler, who is her best friend.

The chimp also dials telephone numbers at random
when no one is watching.

Sheba, a lab-born chimp owned by the Columbus Zoo,
wrll appear on ABC-TV’s “Good Morning America” this
week; she is the subject of a story due out this month in
People magazine.

The surrogate mother-daughter relationship between
Boysen and Sheba and their mutual teasing has helped
the chimp ignore the attention and get to work.

In a recent demonstration, Sheba was placed on the
floor in front of a small, rectangular yellow plate. Above
that was placed plastic squares with numbers ranging
from zero to seven, mixed randomly. Boysen then
placed four apples on the plate.

“0K, Sheba. We’re going to count some apples. How
many?” Boysen asked. Fighting a desire to mug for a
photographer, Sheba touched each apple then pointed to
the number five and looked to Boysen for approval.

“You know that is not five apples,” Boysen said. “Try

to the number seven.

It took a third try and a hallway conference between
'Boysen and Sheba before the ape finally ignored the
photographer and picked the correct number. Sheba
was rewarded with a kiss and a handful of M&Ms and
gumdrops.

Boysen has worked with Sheba for almost five years
and says theassociation has been rewarding from the
start, although Sheba would rather be playing.

“They have such a short attention span,” Boysen said.
“At first, she wouldn’t try at all. But then she began to
show us she could learn fast.”

Animal Rights Groups
Could Sue Under Bill

Among a gaggle of House bills
aimed at giving animals better protec-
tion against mistreatment by research
scientists and animal dealers is a mea-
sure to give animal protection groups
the right to sue for enforcement of the
1966 Animal Welfare Act by the US.
Department of Agriculture.

Groups such as the Humane Society
of the United States have argued that
Agriculture has failed to enforce the
law, which gives the agency control of
regulations on shipping and husbandry
of many farm animals, lab animals and
pets and the responsibility to enforce
those rules.

     

1966 law protects animal welfare.

But the groups have lost court battles
against Agriculture over whether they
have legal standing to sue. The legisla-
tion, called a standing bill, would allow
groups to seek a mandamus order di—
recting government ofﬁcials to perform
their duty under the 1.966 law.

According to Stephana West, an aide
to Democrat Charlie Rose of North
Carolina, who introduced the measure,
the Agriculture Subcommittee on De-
partment Operations, Research and
Foreign Agriculture will hold hearings
on the bill later this spring.

It’s Spring, and the Pandas
Are Going At It Again . . .

America’s giant panda couple, Ling-Ling and Hsing~
Hsin’g, mated on three consecutive days this month at.
the National Zoo, but it is too soon to tell if Ling-Ling
is pregnant. a zoo spokesman said yesterday.

The pandas mated each morning April 9, 10 and
11, said Robert Hoage, special assistant to the 200’s
director.

The 200 is monitoring Ling-Ling s urine for signs of
hormone changes that would indicated pregnancy,
and it has made modifications to her living quarters in
anticipation of a possible birth, Hoage said.

It could be several weeks before it is known if Ling-
Ling is pregnant, he said. -

If Ling-Ling were to give birth to a surviving pan—
da, it would be the first successful breeding of the en—
dangered giant pandas in the United States.

In four pregnancies, Ling-Ling has failed to give
birth to a cub that lived longer than four days.

Ling—Ling, believed to be 19, came to the United
States with HsingoHsing, 18, as a gift from China in
1972.

On June 23, Linching gave birth to a pair of cubs.
One died immediately but the second survived four days
and appeared to be healthy before dying of an infection
caused by a common environmental bacterium.

So instead of steel bars, the ar-
chitects -— CRSS of Houston - in-
stalled a clear acrylic wall, like a de~
partment store display window, be~
hind which the cats appear —-— and
disappear —— to suit themselves.

The lions occupy a savannah
with a large moat, the pumas have a
canyon-like setting and the snow
leopards have massive angular
rocks on which to laze. The smaller
cats — servals and margays, for ex-
ample — have smaller, more con-
ventional wire enclosures, al-
though these also are thickly
landscaped with native vegetation.

Habitats are not new, having
been introduced in Germany in the
early 19008. But the combination of
high costs and curatorial stubborn-
ness prevented their widespread in-
troduction until recently. Now most
enlightened zoos have or are plan-
ning outdoor habitats. The Dallas
Zoo is constructing a SS-acre Wilds
of Africa exhibit that will contain
large cats and other animals, and
officials hope to open a habitat for
lowland gorillas next year.

Zoologists insist that open habi-
tats help animals re-establish beha-
vioral patterns they knew in the
wild. They also represent a depar-
ture from the “structure is all” atti-
tude that has dominated 200 design
for decades.

“Means of enclosure have held
all the attention, to the detriment of
the space within," says zoologist Da-

vid Hancocks, who participated in‘

the 1986 Dallas gorilla habitat sym-
posium. “Great care is paid to the
possibility of physical escape, but
little is done about helping the ani-

mals escape from human gaze if

they want to, or escape from threats.

from each other, or escape from
boredom. By and large, zoo design
standards have been abysmal.”

But nothing could have pre-
pared the architects for some of the
they encountered in

 

 

 

Houston. Having never lived in the
open, many cats initially refused to
leave their cages. Eventually, an an-
imal psychiatrist was brought in to
help condition them to their new
habitat. Once they got used to it,
they trashed it again and again,
stripping the bark off trees and
trampling the bamboo. Only lately
have curators discovered a combi-
nation of plants that can survive
the pranks of Siberian tigers.

Not everything works equally
well in the Houston design. The
acrylic partition in front of some
areas is as much a wall as a window,
distorting the views of the cats and
making them seem too much like

museum specimens. And the small.

cats got short-changed for space,

partly because private contribu-

tions were petering out as their
quarters were being designed. Cor-
porations were eager to adopt a lion
or a leopard, but how much market-
ing mileage can you get out of a
margay?

But the most persistent criticism
of the habitat — that finding the an-
imals is sometimes difficult ~— is
also a measure of how skillfully it
has been designed.

“We probably erred in making
the landscaping so lush," says Hous-
ton '/,oo director John Werler. “We
made the cats so comfortable that
they‘ve become indifferent to the
public “

the University of Virginia. to which
the Kluges have directed $3 million.

Federal investigators have said
they want to question the Kluges,
but at Friday’s ceremony, Kluge
said he has not yet spoken to them
about the charges.

Last week, after “summoning”
local reporters to a chandelier-lit
stable on the estate, Patricia Kluge
said, “We are shocked and horrified
at the horrors” uncovered on their
property. “We do not condone this
kind of action . . . . It is so totally
foreign to our nature as preserva-
tionists and lovers of the coun-
tryside.” The Kluges have contrib-
uted to the Nature Conservancy,
the Virginia Wildlife Center and the
New York Animal Hospital.

The Kluges are standing by Mus-
grave, whom Patricia Kluge de-
scribed as “a highly reputable gen-
tleman. He, too, is a preservation-
ist. The reason he is here is be-
cause he is the best at what he
does.”

One person who participated in a
shoot last year said, “It’s not my idea
of sport.” The man, who did not wish
to be identified, said he and his seven
or eight shooting companions killed
“literally thousands” of pheasants,
quails and mallard ducks. “Once was
enough,” he said.

The night before the hunt, he re-
called, the guests dined on pheasant,
“presumably shot by the previous
guests," and then danced in the disco
in the massive Albemarle House,
which Town and Country magazine
called “the grandest estate built in
America since the 19203.”

The next morning, the hunters,
all of whom were attired in special
“shoot” outfits of oversized tweed
jackets and trousers, toasted the
hunt from silver goblets that were
marked with the number of their as-
signed shooting “peg,” or position
on the field.

Then Musgrave, who had “a
stuffy British accent,” according to
the guest, ordered “heaters” to
shoo the birds from bushes in the
direction of the shooters. After they
fired, handlers directed dogs to re-
trieve their prey.

The guest list at Albemarle House
has included such disparate celebri-
ties as former Virginia governor
Charles S. Robb, presidential confi-
dant Betsy Bloomingdale, Beverly
Sills, Frank Sinatra, former New
York Times editor AM. Rosenthal,
and Arnold Palmer, who designed
the estate’s 18-hole golf course.

WGAY in Silver Spring, which he
built into Metromedia Inc., includ-
ing Washington’s television Channel

$4.6 billion in 1985.

Before her marriage to Kluge in
1981, Patricia Rose, born in Bagh-
dad to an Iraqi mother and a British
father, lived in England, where she
regularly posed nude for a British
skin magazine owned by her then-
husband.

According to an affidavit signed
by Donald R. Patterson, a special
agent of the US Fish and Wildlife
Service’s division of law enforce-
ment, the investigation into the.




game preserve began Nov. 14,
when residents of the Lake Mon-
ticello area in adjoining Fluvanna
County discovered 61 hawk feet
and seven hawk carcasses next to
the gate of Lake Monticello.

About a week later, Fluvanna
County Deputy Sheriff Jackie Gillis-
pie, who also is a deputy federal
game warden, received an anony-
mous letter that suggested he check
out “a rumor that many natural

game-bird predators have been ruth- '

lessly destroyed in the preserve.”

On Jan. 17, Gillispie found an in-
jured red-tailed hawk along Rte.
712, adjoining the Kluges’ shooting
preserve. A veterinarian deter-
mined that the bird had been shot
by a small-caliber rifle.

Investigators then interviewed
Brian Scott Heath, who until he was
fired Feb. 29 was the only local res-
ident employed at the shoot. Heath
said he had worked as a beater.

Heath told investigators he had
been fired primarily because he did
not agree with killing predatory an-
imals. He said the gamekeepers
killed hawks and owls on a daily ba-
sis, either by trapping or shooting.
He admitted that he too had killed
several hawks shortly after he was
hired last summer.

He said the gamekeepers were un-
der instructions from Musgrave to
kill any animal that would be a threat
to the released ducks or pheasants.
After they would kill a hawk, owl or
dog—as many as 15 to 20 hawks a
day, Heath said—the carcasses were
placed in feed bags and buried in a pit
on the property. The feet were re-
tained as proof of the number of
hawks killed, Heath said.

Last July, Heath said, Shardlow,
Amos and Deighton, who kept di-
aries to record the number of
hawks killed, bet with one another
over who could kill the most. The
hawks and other predators were at-
tracted to the preserve because it
was stocked last summer with
8,000 to 10,000 pheasant chicks
and 3,500 ducklings, Heath said.

Based on the testimony of Heath
and others, federal investigators se-
cured search warrants. Forty

armed federal and state agents .
raided the preserve on March 28 ,

and uncovered what has been de-

scribed as the largest hawk kill in .

Virginia history.

The cache included the remains
of 91 redtailed hawks, seven Coop~
ers hawks, five great horned owls, a
red-shouldered hawk, a barred owl,
a turkey vulture, a crow, feathers, a
bobcat hide, deer parts, various
skulls, and a number of rifles and
revolvers, leg-hold traps and elec-
tronic calling devices.

CREATIVE LOAI’S’ING -At1anta - March

 

 

HUMANE SOCIETY MM” '

Begun in 18 73, the Atlanta Humane
Society is our city ’3 oldest charity. Not only
is the Society involved in pet adoption, but
also it serves as a valuable resource for
education and information on animal care.
CREA TI VE LOA FING is pleased to announce
Ask the Atlanta Humane Society, a new
column that will be a weekly feature in the
Spring Living Guide. In this column, the
Society will answer animal care questions,
reminding readers of pet care
responsibilities and keeping us informed
about upcoming pet-related activities
around town. '

If I bring you an animal, how long do
you keep it?

Once an animal is available for
adoption at the Atlanta Humane Society,
we do not have a time limit. The pet
remains available until it gets adopted, as
long as it is healthy. The health of the
animal, its ability to adapt from a home
environment to a kennel environment of
300 other animals, and space for the
animal are considered when making it
available for adoption. Most of the
animals unavailable for adoption are in
poor health.

An animal brought to us as “lost” is
held three days if it has no identiﬁcation;
with identiﬁcation, the animal is held for
seven days after making attempts to
contact the owner. After the holding
period, an animal can then become
available for adoption. An abandoned
animal is treated as an “owner released”
animal and can be considered for adoption

 

 

2-; ,

Why can’t you keep all of the
animals?

The Society receives not only cats and
dogs but also gerbils, hamsters, lions,
wolves, boas, monitor lizards, horses, etc.
“Exotic” or wild animals are brought in to
us because an owner realized they were
not suitable pets; or, the animals are
conﬁscated by law-enforcement authorities
because they were owned illegally without
a permit. Appropriate homes with
reputable zoos or similar facilities are
sought for these animals. It would
obviously be cruel to conﬁne them to a
small cage for the rest of their lives.

The distressing number of an estimated
10 to 12 million animals are brought to
shelters each year. There are,
unfortunately, just too many animals and
not enough good homes.

What should I do ill see cruelty to
animals?

Report it. There are laws against the
mistreatment of animals. The recently
passed Georgia Animal Protection Act
supports citizens who report cruelties in
pet stores, kennels, even humane societies.
This law is enforced by the Department of
Agriculture. Call 656-3667.

For other animal cruelty, contact your
local animal control agency. Most humane
societies do not have law enforcement
powers, but animal control ofﬁcers, as
deputies of the law, can ﬁne or jail people
for animal cruelty. If you need the number
for your area, call the Society at 873-
5564. If your area doesn’t have an animal
control agency, contact your local police

Call for Entries:

Atlanta students in grades K—7 are
invited to submit artwork for the Atlanta
Humane Society/JCPenny Student Art
Contest, one of the major events that will
take place as a part of Be Kind to Animals
Week, coming up May 1-7. Last year the
Society received over 4,000 entries from
school children; thanks to JCPenny, over
$1,000 in prizes and ribbons was awarded.

The exciting part about the contest this
year is that the artwork will be for sale.
(The buyer will determine the sale price of :
a piece of artwork, and this will be a tax-
deductible contribution.) Proceeds from
the sale will beneﬁt the Society’s new
Community Animal Care and Education
Center. The students’ art will be exhibited

 

at all JCPenny stores and four other
locations (to be announced) from April 24
through May 7.

The deadline for entries is March 31.
Information on contest rules and size
requirements can be obtained from any
JCPenny package pick-up desk. This art
contest is a wonderful vehicle through
which children can become more aware of
the joys as well as the responsibililties of
pet ownership. One of the Society staﬁ’s
favorite pieces last year was submitted by

Bad Choice For Dogs

DeKalb Commissioner
Sherry Schulman has once
again called for an end to the
practice of sending dogs fr’om
the DeKalb Animal Shelter to
researchers at Emory Univer-
sity. She says that in a recent
court suit from animal lovers,
the court has ruled that the
animals could no longer go to
Emory.

That is not our understand-
ing of the court’s ruling. They
held that the county could not
SELL animals. That does not
mean that they can not give
them for research. And that is
what our stories said at the
time. If we knew it as media
reporting county business, we
ﬁnd it surprising that Commis-
sioner Schulman who runs the
County business didn’t.

Commissioner Schulman has
been a consistent opponent of
the use of animals in research.
We suspect that she is using
this as another way of attack-
ing animal research. It is im-
perative that at least the facts
be kept straight in this highly
emotional debate over animals
and research.

No one likes the idea of
animals dying in research. We
hope no one likes the idea of
them dying in the Animal Shel-
ter either. To one of the ani-
mals marked for death it

doesn’t make much difference

which way they die...but it does
make a significant difference to
the person who medical re-
search saves.

The urgent need is to stop
the needless deaths of dogs —-
and cats — and other pets
turned in to the DeKalb Ani-
mal Shelter. The Humane So-
ciety figures point out that
tragically only one animal in
four will be placed in an
adopted home after being sent
to the Animal Shelter. The

death is tragic enough without '

making it worse by making it
for nothing. There are far more
animals being born than there
are homes for animals.

The real solution to death at
the hands of human beings —-—
whether researchers or Animal
Shelter workers -- is to spay or
neuter your animal. Don’t
allow unwanted puppies and
kittens to be born. It does no
good to take them to the Ani-
mal Shelter or dump the new
litter in the lap of the over-
worked Humane Societies.
Three out of four animals will
be marked for death.

April is prevent a litter
month, and we fully support
this effort to prevent unwanted
animals — not debate over who
will kill them or whether their

death should be of some beneﬁt

to someone or not.

Knight-Ridder Newspapers

SAN JOSE, Calif—Rick Collins
and Joel Potter like to say they’re
“No. l in the No. 2 business.”

Their business is picking up after
pooches. In the words of the flyers
crrculated by the two: “We pick up
where your dog left off. -No load
too large, no dog too small. If your
yard starts to smell, give us a yell.
We’re never too pooped to pick it
up.

Collins and Potter ﬁgure they’re
performing a public service that
could make them a pile. Since they
amved in San Jose from Minnesota
in December, they have garnered
more than 100 Santa Clara County
customers who pay $5 a week to
have canine messes removed from
their yards.

.To Potter, a former vitamin dis-
tnbutor and pipeline designer, and

Collins, who used to work in televi—
sron advertising, it’s a profession
wrth unlimited possibilities.

Operating their company, Poop

City eager to put teeth in curbing beavers ’ toll of trees

By Drew Digby
Denver Post Staff Writer.

City—dwelling beavers continue
to eat away Denver’s trees, caus—
ing thousands of dollars of damage
despite several years of relocation
efforts.

The city parks department ad-
mits pr i"‘:."l()US efforts haven’t work-
ed, but the idea is right.

(‘arolyn Etter, manager of the
Parks Department, told a City
Council committee Tuesday the so-
lution is to relocate the beaver col—
onies.

Etter said, however, that past
relocation efforts haven’t suc-
ceeded because of inadequate co—
operation with adjoining cities and
agencies.

Although Etter sees no need to
kill the beavers, others do.

Relocation efforts are a proven
failure, said Joe Duscina, a gar-
dener who has documented mas-
sive beaver damage.

“Beavers are a rodent, they are
destructive and they have no busi-
ness in an urban area,” said Dus-
cina, who claims 985' trees have
been lost to beavers in Bear Creek
Park alone.

A professional trapper could
eliminate most of the problem in a
couple of weeks, but government
officials are afraid of animal rights
activiﬁs, Duscina said.

“"l‘hi re’s no way we are going to
see those trees replaced in my life-

time or in my children’s lifetime.
. . . If we don’t do something now,
we’re not going to have any trees
left.”

The parks department is to meet
today to get state wildlife experts’
views on the problem.

Other meetings to come up with
a new relocation plan will be held
in the next few weeks.

There is also debate over wheth-
er the city should eliminate all
beavers or merely reduce a popu—
lation explosion. Right now, the
state estimates there are 75-82
beavers in Denver along the South
Platte River and Bear Creek.

Those areas might support about
a third of that number, experts es-
timate.

The problem developed because
the beaver’s natural predators, in-
cluding coyotes, no longer roam
the rivers’ urban stretches.

Sherri Tippie, a Wildlife 2000 rep-
resentative who has argued
against Mapping the beavers, said
the government won’t give her

“We want to help, but we
weren’t allowed to do as much as
we could have,” she said.

Efforts by her group to help re-
plant trees, she admits, failed.

“They weren’t watered and the
majority of them died.”

Still, Shel thinks killing beavers is
too extreme.

“Wildlife are not a nuisance if
they are planned for.”

Members of the City Council say
'l‘ippie’s efforts haven’t worked

Animal Research: There Are Alternatives

In his March 20 letter. “Human Cures 'l‘hrough
Animal Research,” Steven (Carroll, executive director of
incurably ill for Animal Research, offers once again a
stock argument. to defend biomedical experiments on
animals. Because we have great. sympathy for his cause,
we. feel we must set the record straight. lvlr. Carroll’s
argument. depends both on a moral confusion and a
mistake about factual in..ittr-.rs.

First, to the confusion. Mr. {Carroll thinks nothing
else is necessary." to pic-w that animal experimental:ion is
justified than pointing to the alleged good results. Many
people agree with Carroll that these experiments have
led people to valuable medical benefits. and yet. they
oppose further experiments. They believe, and most of
us would agree, that good ends do not justify any means.
Whether they are right or wrong, many thoughtful
persons oppose animal experiments for moral reasons.
Among these opponents are the Disabled Against
Animal Research and li‘lxploitation (DARE), located in
Maryland, and the l'iisahled and lncurably ill for
Alternatives to Animal Research, with headquarters in
California.

We owe it to ourselves and to the animals to examine
the reasons put forth by these groups in order to be

consistent with our own reflective position that good
ends do not justify any and all means.

Second, the factual mistakes. Mr. (Carroll’s view that
animal experiments have led to great medical progress is
not the view of some of America’s leading biostalisti-
cians and epidemit‘ilogists. We mention just a few: lli.
Richard Pete, the author of a major study on canct—r

It is only through the maximal exploitation of current

US. Agency Halts Mass
Adoptions of Wild Horses

By RONALD B. TAYLOR, Times Staff Writer

The Bureau of Land Manage-
ment has suspended indefinitely its
controversial wild—horse mass-
adoption program that animal pro-
tection groups say results in the
slaughter of thousands of mustangs
rounded up on Western ranges.

Robert F. Burford, bureau direc-
tor, said Friday that the suspension
is being implemented because of “a
shifting emphasis” toward other
methods of controlling the over-
population of mustangs.

He said these include heightened
efforts to increase individual adop-
tions of mustangs. especially in the
Eastern states, and the proposed
development of privately funded
wild horse sanctuaries.

Under the controversial mass—
adoption program, ranchers have
been allowed to take hundreds of
animals without paying the regular
$125—a-horse adoption fees. The
ranchers can sell the horses after
keeping them a year.

Nearly 15,000 wild horses have
been taken through the fee-waiver
program since 1984, more than half
of them in the last year, according
to Bureau of Land Management
spokesman W. Timothy Locke.

Bureau officials say they do not
know what happens to the horses
once title passes to the adopters.
Animal protection groups dispute
this. saying agency officials know
that most of these horses are
slaughtered.

Reacting to Friday’s suspension
order. Cleveland Amory, president
of the Fund for Animals, said,
“Thank God, they’ve finally come
to their senses." He called the

mass-adoption program “a cruel,

stab in the back to America’s wild
horses.”

There are 43,000 mustangs run-
ning on the range in 10 Western
states. bureau officials estimate.
These mustangs compete with 3.2
million head of domestic livestock
on public lands leased by cattle and
sheep ranchers. Burford has said he
would like to reduce that number to
31,000. a level he feels wili not
damage the ranges furtler.

 

Annual Roundups

The law does not allow thinning
the herds by hunting or euthanasia
so adoption has been the primary
way to reduce the number of
mustangs on the range. Each year,
federal horse wranglers, assisted
by helicopters, round up several
thousand animals and truck them
to government holding pens where
they are put up for adoption.

The controversy focuses on the
fee—waiver adoptions, not the reg—
ular “Adopt-a-Horse” program
that the bureau has used to place
86,000 wild horses and burros with
private individuals since 1976. In-
creased efforts will be placed on
this program, Burford said.

However, the regular adoption
program has never kept pace with
the bureau’s wild horse roundups.
Each year thousands of “unadopta-
ble” horses were left in govern »

merit corrals. Burford said the
agency spends $17.8 million a year
to feed these unwanted horses. The
mass-adoption program was start-
ed in 1984 to dispose of the older,
less attractive horses.

Burford’s decision will not affect
the 7,000 fee—waiver approvals in
the pipeline, an aide said.

Defendant in Lawsuit

The bureau is the defendant in a
lawsuit by the Animal Protection
Institute of Sacramento and the
New York—based Fund for Ani-
mals, which charge that the mus-
tangs are pastured by ranchers for
12 months and then shipped to
market in violation of the Wild
Horse and Burro Act passed in 1971
to stop commercial exploitation of
these animals.

Plaintiff attorneys have filed
documents with a federal court in
Reno contending that bureau offi-
cials allowed a major fee-waiver
adopter to ship 460 horses from
South Dakota to Montana. They
said the federal officials knew that
the horses were being sent to a
slaughterhouse in Canada. Records
show 49 mustangs were killed by a ,
Canadian meatpacker before the
animal protectionists discovered
what was happening and notified
Burford.

Bureau officials deny they knew
the horses were headed for slaugh—
ter.

Threats to Sea Life and Agriculture

 

As Ozone Is Depleted, Much of Life Could Go

 

By PHILIP SHABECOFF

WASHINGTON

HERE is scientific consensus now

that certain industrial chemicals

are destroying the atmosphere’s

protective ozone layer, leaving the

earth and all the life upon it increasingly

exposed to damaging ultraviolet radiation

from the sun. But scientists remain largely

in the dark about what effects that radia-
tion will have on the earth’s ecology.

A recent report by a panel of Govern-
ment and academic scientists that was
convened by the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration found that chloro-
fluorocarbons and halons -— chemicals
used in the manufacture of refrigerants,
foam insulation and solvents, among other
things — are destroying atmospheric
ozone more rapidly than computer models
had anticipated.

Ozone has declined by a global average
of more than 2 percent, the panel reported,
and will almost certainly drop further be-
cause tons of the chemicals have been re-
leased into the atmosphere and are rising
slowly toward the ozone shield.

Scientists generally agree that increased
ultraviolet radiation will bring a sharp rise
in skin cancers, largely among fair-
skinned people. The Environmental Pro-
tection Agency has calculated that in the
United States alone there will be more than
155 million additional cases of skin cancer
and 3.2 million additional cancer deaths
over the next century if the ozone destruc-
tion continues at its current pace.

But damage to other organisms, espe-
cially those in the lower tiers of the earth’s
food chains, could ultimately prove far
worse. F. Sherwood Rowland, a scientist at

the University of California,
Irvine, who first warned
more than a decade ago that
chlorofluorocarbons might be
destroying the ozone layer,
said in a recent interview
that the consequences of this
destruction would probably
be even more severe for eco~
logical systems than for
human health.

Dr. Thomas P. Coohill, re—
cently elected president of
the American Society for
Photobiology, said that skin
cancer in humans is often re-
garded as “the most deleteri-
ous effect of ozone deple-
tion." '

“But in many ways
humans can protect themselves from
radiation,” he said. “I think that plants
soaking up all that ultraviolet is more of a
worldwide worry. Decreasing crop yields
could lead to starvation in many parts of
the world.”

Scientists stress that very little research
has been done on the threat of increased ul-
traviolet radiation to trees, grasslands and
crops, mammals, fish, bacteria and the
rest of the web of life upon which human
existence depends.

“This is difficult to research because it
is a problem that has not happened yet,”
said Martyn M. Caldwell, a science profes—
sor at Utah State University who is on as-
signment at the National Science Founda~
tion. “My own opinion is that increases in
ultraviolet radiation could add up to sub-
stantial changes in the ecosystems. But we
just don’t know.”

 

Richard B. Setlow, senior. biophysicist in
the biology department of the Brookhaven
National Laboratory, said: “It is very
clear that increasing ultraviolet will affect
these systems, but the magnitudes of the
effects are not known. ls it trivial? ls it a
large amount?" One of the unknowns, he
said, is the degree to which organisms can
adapt to increasing levels of radiation.

The research that has been done indi-
cates that the consequences of further
ozone depletion could be severe, even cata-
strophic.

The Antarctic Example

Some of these findings have been re-
ported by Dr. Sayed Z. El-Sayed, a profes-
sor of oceanography at Texas A&M Uni-
versity who recently returned from Ant-
arctica, where the ozone depletion is espe-
cially severe. Dr. El-Sayed studied the ef-
fects of ultraviolet radiation on marine
phytoplankton, microscopic plants that
flourish in the Antarctic Ocean.

These tiny plants, which Dr. El-Sayed

called "the grass of the sea," are the food -

source of krill, a shrimp that abounds in
the Antarctic waters. Krill, in turn, are the
principal food of squid, fish, penguins,
seals, whales and other animal life in the
southern regions of the globe. The phyto—
plankton are also a major food source of
zooplankton, microscopic marine animals

that also form an important link in the food ‘

chain.

l)r. El-Sayed’s experiments showed that
increasing radiation slowed the process of
photosynthesis in the phytoplankton, and
that they died off almost entirely when ul—
traviolet radiation was raised 10 percent.

 

The smaller species of these plants, the
kind forming the primary food source for
the krill, were especially sensitive to the
radiation, he found.

If ultraviolet radiation continues to in-
crease because of a thinning ozone shield,
“we are going to be in some trouble,” Dr.
El-Sayed said. “I can't predict how much
trouble, but it does not bode well. if any-
thing happens to the krill, the whole
ecosystem will absolutely collapse. We can
say goodbye to the whales, to the seals, to
the penguins, et cetera.”

Research conducted by Dr. Alan F. Tera-
mura, a professor of botany at the Univer-
sity of Maryland, suggests that. food crops
would also be jeopardized by increased ul-
traviolet radiation. In experiments on soy-
beans, Dr. Teramura found that an in-
crease in radiation equivalent to what
would result from a 25 percent loss of
ozone reduced the yield of the soybean cul-
tivar by 20 to 25 percent. There was also
evidence, he said, that the radiation was
damaging the quality of the grain, includ—
ing its protein content, and might increase
the plant’s vulnerability to insects and
weeds.

While no similar research has been con-
ducted on other crop plants, it has been
estimated that two out of three plant spe-
cies are sensitive to increased ultraviolet
radiation, Dr. 'l‘eramura noted.

“At a minimum, our data on soybeans,
even as a worst-case scenario, shows us
the potential damage of increased levels of
ultraviolet radiation,” the botanist said.
"We can only hope that the responses we
found are the extreme case, not the gen-
eral case.”

mits pi erious efforts haven’t work-
ed, but the idea is right.

("arolyn Etter, manager of the
Parks Department, told a City
Council committee Tuesday the so-
lution is to relocate the beaver col-
onies.

Etter said, however, that past
relocation efforts haven’t suc-
ceeded because of inadequate co—
operation with adjoining cities and
agencies.

Although Etter sees no need to
kill the beavers, others do.

Relocation efforts are a proven
failure, said Joe Duscina, a gar-
dener who has documented mas-
sive beaver damage.

“Beavers are a rodent, they are
destructive and they have no busi-
ness in an urban area,” said Dus-
cina, who claims 985- trees have
been lost to beavers in Bear Creek
Park alone.

A professional trapper could
eliminate most of the problem in a
couple of weeks, but government
officials are afraid of animal rights
activip‘s, Duscina said.

. . . If we don’t do something now,
we’re not going to have any trees
left.”

The parks department is to meet
today to get state wildlife experts’
views on the problem.

Other meetings to come up with
a new relocation plan will be held
in the next few weeks.

There is also debate over wheth-
er the city should eliminate all
beavers or merely reduce a popu—
lation explosion. Right now, the
state estimates there are 75-82
beavers in Denver along the South
Platte River and Bear Creek.

Those areas might support about
a third of that number, experts es-
timate.

The problem developed because
the beaver’s natural predators, in-
cluding coyotes, no longer roam
the rivers’ urban stretches.

Sherri Tippie, 3 Wildlife 2000 rep-

death in an icy pond.

Bear was a sadly neglected mongrel c00ped '

the love and attention she needed.

“We were scared to death —- the water was
freezing and I was sure we were going to drown 3,
under the ice,” says 8-year-old Martha. ~ i’ ~

Bear, Sarah, 7, and Martha swam to solid ice
and climbed out of the frigid water. But Zeke,
who couldn’t swim, struggled desperately as he
tried in vain to save himself.

The girls stretched'their arms toward Zeke,
but couldn’t grab him —- and the poor little boy
was drowning right before their eyes!

That’s when Bear leaped into action. She
swam to the boy, grabbed his coat collar with her
massive jaws, then paddled feverishly to ferry
Zeke to safety.

gets $2,000 for a fully mounted
lion and about $800 for a lion skin
rug.
Craddock said he was told big
game hunters who did not want to
make the trip to Africa could stalk a
transplanted Texas lion for a
$2,500 to $3,500 fee.

Meanwhile, a Conroe bow—and-
arrow hunter told The Post he wit-
nessed the slaying of another lion
in the Wallisville area last Sunday
—- after the two carcasses were
found in Trinity River marshlands
about 100 yards inside government
property.

L’tdeanwhile, an official of the Hu—

mane Society of the United States
joined a chorus of critics who have
already denounced the lion hunts
as “repulsive” and “a damn
shame.”

“It certainly is a preposterous
situation when these so-called
brave hunters go out and shoot
half-tame lions,” said Bill Meade,
director of the humane group’s
Corpus Christi regional office.

Meade said he would assign an
investigator to the case, although
he was not certain whether any le-
gal action against the hunts was
possible.

The corps’ Craddock said Wil-
burn also had agreed to pick up the
remains of half a dozen goats, used

 

 

 

 

lion hunts, investigator says

as bait for the lions, from the reser-
vonr property.

. “The main thing the corps wants
right now is to get the carcasses off
government property,” Craddock
said, :‘and to halt all activity involv-
mg Iron hunting on government
property.”

Corps spokesman Ken Bonham
said corps attorneys are looking for
any law or regulation that might
prohibit the lion hunts. Federal and

state wildlife agents said earlier

they knew of none.

The Conroe bow hunter, who
asked not to be identified, said he
went with a companion last Sunday
to hunt wild hogs on land he was
told belonged to Wilburn. He said
they were told an African lion hunt

was in progress on a nearby island.

.They later went to the island, he
said, and saw a big-maned, 500-
pound lion circling inside a clump
of trees. The lion. had taken refuge
there shortly after being released
for the hunt.

“He appeared to be used to peo-
ple and didn’t seem to be afraid of
the people around him,” the bow
hunter said, “until they started
throwing rocks at him to drive him
out of the trees so the hunter could
get a shot at him.”

. He said the lion, stung by a rock,
finally charged out of the trees to-
ward the hunter, a Colorado man
who had paid $2,500 for his Sun-

day of fun. The lion hunter missed

three times before finally killing
the lion with a head shot, the bow
hunter said.

. He said he was told that the pre—
vrous weekend, one of the lions
whose carcasses turned up on fed-
eral land was released from a cage
on a boat. The lion trotted off about
50 yards, stopped and looked
around in puzzlement, and then
was bowled over by a hunter’s bul—
let, the Conroe man was told.

He said he was told the ‘lion
hunts had been going on two or
three weeks and nine lions had
been killed. Most of the lions, he
said, came from various zoos and
were sold for about $500 apiece
because they were getting old.

HEALTH—FOOD

Experiment to stress
health-food benefits
produces
unexpected result.

 

The Associated Press

HARRISON TOWNSHIP, N.J. --
Sixth graders who fed a rat a steady
diet of junk food and watched him dete-
riorate into red-eyed lethargy say they
are convinced: The road to good living is
not paved with tasty treats.

But there was one problem with the
experiment. The junk food rat, Honey,
outlived his companion, Nut, who was
fed only health food. Nut choked to
death on a cracker as the results were
announced on Thursday.

“He was extremely healthy,” a dis-
traught Kathie Dilks assured her class
at Harrison Township Elementary
School. The teacher said that Nut would
be provided a proper burial.

The experiment had been slated to
last another 31/: weeks, but, even with
Nut’s death, the results have already
persuaded students like Paul Amiss, 12,
to heed the good nutritional points his
mom has been making for years.

The test showed that a steady diet of
junk food caused a baby white rat to
grow at a slower rate than a companion
rat who was fed the school-lunch menu,
Dilks said.

Honey, who dined on cookies, red lic-
orice and orange marshmallows, ap-
peared lethargic and sleepy during a
news conference at the southern New
Jersey school. An open can of stale soda
waited'nearby in case Honey was
thirsty.

Nut, the rat that munched tossed sal- ‘

ads, bananas ‘and pizza, weighed in at a
whOpping 78 grams prior to his sudden
death and showed substantial tail
growth. Honey weighed 45.5 grams.

LOS ANGELES TIMES - April 19, 1988

LETTERS :

McCarthy on
Slaughterhouses

I was compelled to answer the
nonsensical, meandering diatribe
by Colman McCarthy entitled
“Slaughterhouses: Butchery for
Animals, High Danger for Those
Who Kill and Hack” (Op—Ed Page,
April 12).

If ever a title set the tone for the
“discussion” of an issue, this hum-
dinger has to get the Kewpie doll.
Regardless of your feelings on the
issue, would you feel you had to
read on, in the interest of gaining
some new glimmer of insight, if you
saw an article “The Soviet Union:
Bloodsucking Dictatorship or An-
droid Factory?” Not everyone is in
it to waste time, so most articles of
this nature are passed up.

Still, being a confirmed omni-
vore, I felt that the offhand slap
against this society’s “allegedly”
civilized behavior of eating the
flesh of animals could not just lie
there. I am, by association, merely
“allegedly civilized.”

First of all, it is not a “lie” that
animals have no rights. It is as true
as the fact is that I do. Human
beings, in the interest of living
harmoniously, invented the con—
cept of “rights.” The mortally
wounded brontosaurus, bleeding
out its last in a swamp after
escaping its carnivorous enemy,
had no more rights than the flies
hitting McCarthy’s windshield or
the ants crunching under his shoes.
The same goes for the zebra that
breaks its leg in a burrowing
animal’s hole, and awaits its fate
among the hyenas. Rights, in the
purest sense of the word, exist only
when a sentient mind invents
them.

Civilization demands we discard ‘

the cycle of cruelty and forgetful-
ness that marked the behavior of
some of our ancient ancestors, but
it does not demand that we elevate
animals other than ourselves to our
stature. Possession of a nervous
system does not confer upon its
owner any guarantees—either the
creature in question can survive, or
it cannot. We have banded togeth-
er to ensure that we will. Our
abysmally stupid and brutish
neighbors carry us, feed us and
clothe us. So it will be until they
join us.

' KEVIN CAREY

Olancha'

McCarthy was certainly right on
the mark regarding slaughterhouse
violence. If one stops to think for
even a moment about the damage
inflicted on our planet’s animals for
no reason greater than the selfish
satisfaction of our palates, it be-
comes easy to understand why
there will never be real peace in
the world. If we can so easily
sanction the cruel methods of
breeding, raising and slaughtering
animals, and then create a vastly
profitable industry around that
misery, then clearly we can justify
the destruction of other human
beings for causes which we actual-
ly deem important or essential.

The animal—rights people have a
slogan which bears some reflection:
“Nonviolence begins at breakfast.”
We have satisfied our taste buds at
the expense of our conscience and I
would say it is a poor trade indeed.

BEN WOOD
Encinitas

McCarthy’s initial point about
the miserable working conditions
in meat-packing plants is well
taken—and well documented, Sin-
clair Lewis having put it much
more eloquently in his book, “The
Jungle.”

But when the article degener-
ated into a hysterical attack on all
of us who mercifully don’t feel
haunted by the Ghost of Chicken
Past, 1 was struck by a thought: No
doubt, civilization would be better
served if McCarthy laid off of us
non-vegetarians and instead used
his position as a syndicated colum-
nist for the more important goal of
pressing the attack on the world’s
numerous barbaric factions that we
must witness slaughtering human
beings every day on the front pages
and on the evening news. Make
yourself useful, Mr. McCarthy.

JOSEPH BISSIN
San Luis Obispo

McCarthy’s article on the abat-
toir led to a review of my notes for
a layman's sermon on “the moral
basis of vegetarianism" that I pres-
ented to our Unitarian church
congregation in 1983.

After touching on the usual sub-
jects, including the health risks of
eating meat, I proposed a potluck
where parents and children could
learn more about the vegetarian
dietary. option. There would be
meat (the always popular ham-
burger) and non-meat dishes of-
fered for comparison.

Snz’all slickers and boots to

The adults and children who
wanted hamburgers would slaugh-
ter the calf and prepare it for the
barbecue. For educational purpos-
es, a child would be encouraged to
trigger the “captive bolt,” a device
that stuns, but does not kill, the
animal prior to cutting its throat.
Those children who wanted to
handle the knives would be al-
lowed to if they were dexterous
enough. The smaller children
would carry out the offal, and help
with cleanup.

My drift had become clear early
on, and here a very audible gasp
rippled through the audience
(which included at most two vege»
tarians).

That gasp symbolizes the entire
morality of eating meat in a society
where it is not required for surviv-
al. As McCarthy suggests, we
might benefit from examining that
morality more carefully.

Maria Aragon, whose “1,000,000-
to-l shot” put her in the ranks of
unwitting, unwilling deer hunters.
She is unamused by deer any
more, as the animals pose real
dangers to her children, ages 2 and
5. Aragon shot a pellet gun at deer
in her yard last month. hoping to
scare them away. But she killed an
animal and now faces a $200 fine.

She said she has seen up to 15
animals in her yard at the western

munching on bushes.

Deer have a docile image, of
course. But experts have told her
the animals can use their hooves to
devastating effect, and the peril of
bucks with antlers is obvious. Foot-

prints also are not the only thing

deer leave; Aragon said she does
not like cleaning up after them.

In Boulder, one problem is the
lack of natural predators to control
the deer population; it would be
impractical to import mountain
lions or open a season for hunters
in or near the city limits. Trapping
deer and moving them elsewhere
is a solution but an expensive one.

BOULDER — Even the most
congested cities have some forms

where a system of greenbelts has

the animals have become a prob-

Boulder has deer, lots of them,
including some that live on the

and yards of two-legged neighbors
for a snack. Some deer no longer
even commute from the mountains
into town any more; they live in

She said the problem isn’t due to
a scarcity of food in the wilds near—
by. Instead, deer “have lost. their
fear of people” and now thinkol
humans as creatures who “fertilize
and water things they like to eat”.

The urban deer population is
tough to count, but it has grown
less unusual to find them “bedding
down next. to someone’s garage or
having fawns in back yards,” she
noted.

A study four years ago deter
mined that there were 1,100 to 1,200

But the population appears to have

ized — a process also costly and
difficult. Dogs also could be used to
chase unwanted deer from yards
but Kuelthau fears the hounds
might. maim the wildlife.

Seven people were arrested

mark the start of “Animal Lib-

Campus police arrested the

demonstrators as they tried to hand
out leaflets at the Medical Sciences
Building on Parnassus Avenue, said
Chief Bob Reisig of the UC San
Francisco police.

They were held briefly at the
Hall of Justice before being cited
for. trespassing and released to ap-

The arrests followed an all-
night candlelight vigil after the pro-
testers marched 35 miles on Sunday
from a Palo Alto park to San Fran-

“The horrors taking place be-
hind these closed and locked doors

' is tragic,” one protester said Sunday

night at the UC San Francisco Medi-
cal Center.

The demonstrators will stage
rallies this week at UC Davis, Stan-
ford, UC Berkeley and the Letter-

Elliot Katz, a veterinarian and
head of In Defense of Animals, said
protesters are calling for a halt to
medical and psychological experi-
ments with animals, especially for-
mer pet dogs and cats sold by ani-
mal pounds for research. They are
also demanding the right to hold
surprise checks of research labora-
tories, Katz said.

A rally is scheduled today at UC

group, claimed to have set a fire last
year that caused $2.5 million in dam-

LOS .-‘\NGELES TIMES - April 16, 1988

aurel Canyon Park has

gone, officially, to the

dogs.

Unofficially, it’s been that
way for some time, ever since a
small group of dog owners began
letting their pets run loose there
in defiance of the city’s leash law.

Then word spread, until there
were dozens of adamant dog
owners—including such celebri-
ties as artist David Hockney-—
who argued with their neighbors,
fought with animal control offi-
cers, packed a City Hall hearing
room and even enlisted the sup-
port of former Vice President
Walter F. Mondale to gain sanc-
tion for Los Angeles’ dog park.

It soon became a park where
the animals ran loose while the
children were caged—in a small
playground tucked away in a
corner.

On Friday, the dog owners
won.

Hours for Running Free

The City Council declared the
small grassy area atop the Santa
Monica Mountains the first park
in the city where animals will be
permitted to run free, at least
part of the day. By an 11-0 vote,
council members set free the
animals between dawn and 9 am.
and from 4 pm. until dusk,
drawing applause and cheers
from about 100 dog owners who
attended the meeting.

“There are over 200,000 dogs
in the city, and there is not a
single facility where they can go
to exercise,” said Councilman
Joel Wachs.

Officials said the Laurel Can-
yon Park precedent may lead to
establishing other leash-free ar-
eas around the city.

Merely four acres, the park is
located off Mulholland Drive in
an affluent hillside neighborhood
above Hollywood and the San
Fernando Valley. At the en-
trance is a sign showing a man
walking a dog On a leash, a
reminder of the law. But down
below, the picture is different.

On a nice day, as many as 100
dogs can be found romping
around the park, unrestrained.

Playground Fenced

Off to the side, the childrens’
playground is enclosed by a met-
al fence and posted with half a
dozen signs warning “No dogs
allowed.”

Everywhere else, there is no
question who rules.

Water bowls dot the ground.
Pooper scoopers stand against
numerous trash cans posted with

signs that read, “Please pick up
after your dog.” Tacked to a
bulletin board are advertise-
ments for “dog-sitting” and
“dog-walking” services. '
On sunny weekends, expensive
cars pull up with dogs hanging
out the windows, the express10ns

of Pavlovian pleasure on their
faces reminiscent of children ar-
riving at Disneyland. Before
noon, the parking lot fills up, and
cars stand along both sides of the
road leading in and out of the
park, despite “no parking” signs
there.

Dogs of every kind are there,
from expensive show champions
to scruffy mongrels. Some chase
a ball or a Frisbee. Others simply
stand around in a crowd. Their
owners, meanwhile, stand
around in their own crowd.

“You meet lots of people,” said
Joella March, a West Hollywood
artist and art teacher, who was
running her dog in the park. “It’s
good for the dogs and good for
the owners, too.” ’ .

Some residents of the sur-
rounding neighborhoods bring
their dogs because their hillside
homes have no flat back yards
and there are no sidewalks for
walking pets.

But dog owners also come here
from throughout the city. Santa
Monica attorney Barbara Fox
said she takes her beagle, Casey.
on the 38-mile round trip because

her community does not allow
dogs in its parks, even on leashes.
And word had spread of this one,
special park.

The City Council’s action

“My wife and my two school-
age sons no longer even want to
go there at all at the risk of being
run down by the dogs,” Perkins
wrote. “If anything, there should

be a fenced dog playground in a
people’s park, not the other way
around.”

Hockney, who featured Mul—

comes four years after Laurel
Canyon Park became a battle-
ground between dog owners and
other park users who complained
that the animals were taking
over the place, making it unsafe
and unsanitary for humans.

At least a few dogs can be
found running loose at every
park in the city. But, said Elaine
Kohn, a Laurel Canyon resident,
“I ask you to show me another
park in the city that has the
concentration of dogs that this
one has.”

Each side counts some of the
area’s celebrity residents in its
ranks.

Actor Anthony Perkins sent a
letter to the City Council com-
plaining that trips to the park had
turned “into a nightmare.”

Paul H. McKenney Jr. turns faucet to help his dog get a drink.

 

holland Drive in one of his most
famous paintings, spoke on be-
half of the dog owners at one
council hearing. Responding to
complaints about dog droppings,
he commented, ”Some of us think
the world is a little too hygienic
anyway.” .

“Whenever I run into Davrd
Hockney,” said Councilman Mike
Woo, whose district includes the
park, “all I want to talk about is
art. All he wants to talk about is
the dog park.”

park.

Former Vice President Mondale
got into the act at the request of his
daughter, Eleanor, who-until re-
cently moving to Chicago to take a
broadcasting job—liked to let her
Rottweiler, Teddy, romp around
the park. In 1985, he called Mayor
Tom Bradley to ask him to “take a
look at the matter.”

During hearings before the City
Council, ParkWatch members con-
tended that they earned the right
to let their dogs run free because
they spent money to clean and
patrol the park and rescue it from
gangs.

“After all, it was the presence of
dogs that chased the criminals from
the park,” Purse said.

But other park users complained
that they were being chased away
as well.

her fear for the safety of her two
small children.

“When my youngest was only a
month old, a big pack of dogs
mowed him over. He was just
frightened to death.”

“I’m not anti-dog," insisted Jerry
Greenfield, president of the Laurel
Hills Homeowners Assn. and an
opponent of unleashed dogs in the
park. But Greenfield, a dog owner
himself, said this park is simply too
small for the novel program and
that leash-free areas should be
established in larger parks, where
there is enough room for both dogs
and humans.

Greenfield also contended that
the city should not give in to
“lawlessness" by “dignifying peo-
ple who took over that park."

Until City Council redistricting
in late 1986, it looked as if there
might be no official attempt to
settle the dispute.

Before redistricting, the park
was in the district of Councilman
Wachs, who blocked efforts to
allow dogs to _ run loose there,
agreeing with neighbors who said it

Leash-Free Park Gets OK

was too small an area. But redis~
tricting put the area in Councilman
Woo's district.

Last year, Woo offered the com-
promise that would allow dogs to
run free in mornings and late
afternoons. Dogs will be allowed in
the park at other times, but must be
leashed.

Los Angeles now joins Berkeley
and San Francisco as cities that
allow dogs to run free in some park
areas. The council action also asks
the city Recreation and Parks
Department to report back in six
months on the time-sharing plan
and whether it should be expanded
to other parks.

Whether the time-sharing plan
will settle the dispute is unclear.
Critics expect dog owners, who
won their victory through years of
civil disobedience, to ignore the
new rules.

Woo said the controversy has
been like nothing else he has seen
during his three years on the
council. When he was elected, he
noted, “I did not envision basically

ATLANTA FMGXZINE - April 1988

/In apparent victory over ‘joonno’
seizure” in DeKn/o County underscores
t/ze eonﬂior between medical resenre/z and
animal rzg/ns

By Tom Junod

anuel Maloof had
‘ heard enough. For
nearly an hour, he had been watching a
work session of the DeKalb County Board
of Commissioners slide into chaos, in-
vaded by warring armies. As the county’s
chief executive officer, he had presided over
his share of controversies —- lawsuits, zon-
ing issues, battles with neighboring coun-
ties. But now everyone was talking about
dogs, for chrissake, and the place was a
madhouse, a tent meeting of doctors, ve-
terinarians, TV crews, press agents, ear-
nest activists in suits and ties and gray-
haired ladies with BAN POUND SEIZURE
buttons stuck to their sweaters, all jammed
into his conference room on a sweltering
September day._

They ﬁlled every available seat, lined the
walls and spilled out the door, jostling for
space. On one side: the good gray men of
the medical establishment, urging the
DeKalb commissioners to preserve the
county’s practice of providing dogs and
cats from its animal shelter to Emory and
the University of Georgia for research and
experimentation. On the other: the activ—
ists dedicated 'to abolishing that policy. In
between, seated at a long table of polished
wood, were the six county commissioners,
listening to the arguments, pleas, accusa-
tions and torrents of invective.

The debate was not gentle. Over the past
seven years, a new force has come to dom-

inate discussions of scientific ethics, and
this was its ﬁrst show of power in Atlanta.
It is called the animal-rights movement,
and it holds. that all living things are essen-
tially equal —- that, in the words of one of
its leaders, “a rat is a pig is a dog is a boy.”
For its adherents, the movement holds
nothing less than the promise of a new
Eden: humankind’s victory over its worst
instincts, a taming of the last ethical fron-
tier. For its opponents, however, the notion
of “animal rights” threatens more than
man’s prejudices; it threatens his ability to
ﬁght disease.

Insisting that nearly every medical “mir-
acle” of this century has been a result of
animal research, the scientiﬁc community
compares the apparent will of the Ameri-
can people — a 1985 Associated Press poll
found that 78 percent of the public sup-
ports the use of animals in research —— to
the animal rightist’s stated aim of abolish-
ing vivisection. And although the activists
behind the “ban pound seizure” debate
maintained that they were not trying to ban
animal experimentation, scientists from
Emory and Yerkes Regional Primate Re-
search Center — and men such as Manuel
Maloof - viewed their efforts as a Trojan
horse, a first step in establishing a “tyr-
anny of the minority over the majority.”

Maloof listened to the arguments until
he could stand no more. At the other end
of the table sat Dr. Neal Barnard, a Wash-
ington, D.C., psychiatrist and medical ad-
viser to animal-rights groups, who was ex-
plaining why dogs bred specifically for re-
search should be used in experiments

 

 

DeKalb Commissioner Sherry Schulman: “We
just don’t want [researchers] experimenting on
animals that might have been pets”

 

 

instead of dogs from the shelter. Maloof
asked him to clarify his position. Was Dr.
Barnard saying that it was somehow better
to kill a “purpose-bred” dog than a dog

 

 

‘If you can’t use animal models, your research
stops, and stops cold,’ says an Emory
neurosurgeon

scheduled to die at the pound?

Yes, for the good of science, answered
Dr. Barnard. The founder of a group called
the Physicians’ Committee for Responsible
Medicine, he had been traveling the coun-
try, offering testimony in meetings just like
this one, and he reiterated his contention
that purpose-bred dogs produce better re-
search, that pound animals are unreliable
subjects, that “cheap animals make for
cheap science.”

Maloof cut him off. “I think you’re a
good guy, but you’re on the wrong track.”
And then, suddenly, the chairman was off
his seat, and with his voice high and crack-
ing, he shouted down the young doctor.
“What’s going on in this country when we
turn away from what’s good for humans to
waste time on these crazy issues? .
Sure, I’m emotional. My wife just went
through a dadgum hospitalization, and I
didn’t know whether she was going to live
or die. . . . But if they can come up with
an answer by doing a dog in, then so be it.”

In the aftermath, both sides — the re-
search community and the DeKalb Coali-
tion to Save Our Pets —- attempted to at-
tach meaning to Maloof’s outburst and to
predict how such a display of emotion
would help or hurt their causes. For the
representatives of Emory and Yerkes, Ma-
loof couldn’t have performed better if
they’d provided him a script; they knew
that the public’s perception of medical re-
search was tied to the image of the scientist
in his sterile white coat, and they figured
that Maloof’s testimony would lend their

 




public-relations efforts a human dimen-
sion. For the groups seeking to end pound
seizure, the reviews were more mixed; they
had sought to abolish only the use of
pound animals in research, and yet here
was Maloof confusing the issues, behaving
as though they had asked to abolish ani-
mal experimentation altogether. At the
same time, however, they hoped that the
style of his monologue, captured by TV
cameras, would reveal just how bullying,
irrational and intolerant of dissent the other
side could be.

The prognostications were moot. Two
weeks later, Gary Shapiro of the Coalition
to Save Our Pets sued DeKalb County,
contending that by selling animals to re-
search institutions without an advisory
board to regulate the practice, the county
was in violation of its own ordinances. On
Oct. 19 Judge Robert Castellani of the
DeKalb County Superior Court agreed and
issued a permanent restraining order
against the sale of animals from the county
shelter for research. Although Castellani
did not forbid the donation of animals, the
flow of animals to Emory and UGA
stopped, and Atlanta’s animal-rights move-
ment had come of age. (DeKalb provided
the animals to Emory in return for veteri-
nary care and the chemical for humane eu-
thanasia. At press time, a DeKalb spokes-
person said that although the county was
“in a posture to donate,” it had not started
doing So.)

“The fight over pound seizure estab-
lished, really for the first time, the pres-
ence of animal protection groups in the At—
lanta area,” says Sherry Schulman, the
DeKalb commissioner whose daughter,
Ginger Redmon, was instrumental in or-
ganizing the Coalition to Save Our Pets.
“These aren’t people who just love pets.
These are people who truly believe in ani~
mal protection, and that’s a powerful
force.”

0 gauge exactly how powerful, it is

best to turn away from Atlanta for a
moment and survey the influence of the
animal-rights movement on the national
landscape.

Thirteen years ago, there was no such
thing as an animal-rights movement, and
the concept of animal rights was foreign
and unformulated. There were, of course,
humane societies opposed to the use of
pound animals in research, and antivivisec-
tion organizations opposed to the very idea
of animal experimentation, but they lacked
unity and a cogent message. Then came the
publication of Animal Liberation by an
Australian professor of philosophy, Peter
Singer, and suddenly those concerned with
the status of animals in our world not only
had their bible but their rallying cry.

In Animal Liberation Singer attacked
humanity’s traditional dominion over the
beasts of the earth and, indeed, the entire
Western conception of animals as a re-

Behind Closed Doors

he black-and-brown hound enters the laboratory, its hindquarters

slumping. Sedated by morphine, it is passive and forlom-looking, and

lit doesn’t pull against the technician’s leash. “Okay boy, c’mon,”
says the technician, his voice reminiscent of a parent compelled to discipline his
child, a mixture of impatience, sadness and resignation.

A steel table gleams under the light. A young surgeon kneels beside the dog,
petting its head and curling its ear around his ﬁnger. The technician turns on
an electric clipper and begins shaving a patch of fur from the dog’s ribs. For a
minute, there are just two sounds in the room: the buzz of the clipper and the
surgeon’s whispered assurances to the dog. Then things happen quickly.
Through a vein running above its paw, the dog is given a bolt of barbiturate-
based anesthesia and falls forward, its dead weight supported by the technician.
The surgeon sticks a red breathing tube down its throat and secures its tongue
against the roof of its mouth with gauze. Both men pick up the dog and carry
it to the table.

What begins now is the process of isolation that turns the dog into a subject,
a heart sequestered from the mass of flesh and blood. The dog is covered by
green sheets, leaving only the shaved patch exposed to the light. A laboratory
assistant, replacing the technician, clamps towels around the edges of the patch.
She is serious, brisk, efﬁcient. She moves a tray of hemostats, clamps and scal-
pels ~ gleaming symbols of precision —— into place over the dog. The surgeon,
a fellow in cardiovascular surgery, slices the ﬂesh with a scalpel, then follows
with an electronic unit that simultaneously cuts and cauterizes, leaving a charred
lip around the incision. A blue spark leaps from the tip of the unit, raising a
thin plume of smoke, and the room suddenly smells like meat.

“They use the same unit on humans,” says the assistant, “and you get the
same smell. In fact, what we’re hoping to do is replicate exactly what would
happen in an operating room.”

Through skin, through fat and then through twitching, rippling layers of
muscle, the surgeon proceeds, until finally he can poke a finger between the
dog’s ribs and point to a lung. He drapes the edges of the cavity with damp
gauze, then inserts a rib retractor and turns the crank, stretching muscle and,
finally, exposing the heart. It is amazingly bloodless and clean, and its eerie
beauty can easily induce one to forget that it is connected to a dog lying under-
neath green sheets.

For a half hour, the surgeon and the assistant work to free the heart from its
protective membrane, to tap its vessels and to rig it with measuring devices. Fi-
nally, nearly two hours after the dog emerged from the kennel, a scientist enters
the lab and dons green surgical scrubs. By this time, the prep work is virtually
complete, and the surgeon is drinking a Coke.

The experiment begins. The scientist states his purpose: to test the safety of
multivessel coronary angioplasty. “I am interested in the problems that can en-
sue when there’s an area of the heart that’s threatened, and another area of the
heart where angioplasty temporarily blocks blood flow. Will the threatened area
go to pot, and will it be able to bounce back?”

For the next hour, the research team tries to answer that question, curtailing
blood flow to the heart’s left ventricle, then using ultrasonic crystals to measure
how the threatened ventricle reacts to occlusions of the circumflex artery. There
is an atmosphere of both tedium and anticipation. There is occasional talk of
department store sales, crotchety parents, the need for a raise. The dog’s heart,
under stress, turns from pink to purple, from purple to blue. At one point, it
looks as though the heart-will fail, halting the experiment. “C’mon dog, don’t
fibrillate,” the scientist says. “We’ve worked very hard on you today.”

Finally, the computer spouts its last line of data, and the experiment is over.
The heart, under hot lights for several hours, films over. The assistant gives the
dog an overdose of anesthesia. In a few minutes, the surgeon takes a syringe
and gives the heart a direct shot of potassium chloride. The heart surges, then
misses a beat, then twitches and wiggles until it stops. The respirator is turned
off. The surgeon stuffs the gauze into the cavity and disconnects all the tubes.
The technician comes back to wrap a mustard-colored sheet around the dog and
put it into a plastic bag. The sheets that cover it are never removed, and it is
hard to remember its face. —- Tom Junoa’

 

 

 




 

ANIMAL RIGHTS

 

 

Continued from page 87

source. Although he did not advocate the
enfranchisement of animals, Singer did be-
stow them “rights” as sentient beings, con-
demning their exploitation as a product of
“speciesism” — the oppression of one spe-
cies of animal by another, in this case
Homo sapiens.

Animal Liberation managed both to
translate the vague sympathies of old-line
antivivisectionists into a radical agenda and
to ﬁnd an audience of vegetarians, young
idealists, old hippies and adherents of hol-
istic health— the citizens of the budding
New Age. Armed with the conviction that
they had found in speciesism a key to the
woes of animals and the sorrows of hu-
mankind, the people who accepted the ten-
ets of Animal Liberation needed only a
spark to coalesce into a full-fledged move-
ment, a spark that would be provided by
the research community itself.

In 1980, Alex Pacheco, a political sci—
ence major at George Washington Univer-

sity, met Ingrid Newkirk, an animal activ-
' ist, and the two founded an organization
called People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals (PETA) to advance the ideas of
Peter Singer and Animal Liberation. In
1981, Pacheco, seeking ﬁrst-hand experi-
ence in a research laboratory, volunteered
to work for Dr. Edward Taub at the Insti-
tute of Behavioral Research. Night after
night, he sneaked into the lab, document—
ing and photographing what he had found
— cages caked with filth, monkeys suffer—
ing from self-mutilation and untreated
wounds, experiments almost diabolical in
their ingenuity, and a research scientist who
kept a monkey skull and hand as paper—
weights — until, after four months, he had
gathered enough evidence to have the lab
raided and Taub charged with cruelty to
animals.

The impact of the raid — the ﬁrst such
action taken against a research laboratory
in the United States —— was immediate and
far-reaching. “The case was on the ‘CBS
Evening News,’ ” says Ingrid Newkirk,
now co-director of PETA with Pacheco.
“Here, for the first time, people saw that
something could be done [about the labs],
and they came out of the closet. We wer-
en’t prepared for the volume of mail we re-
ceived. We had to start churning out sheets
of information. But the time was right to
create what [writer and animal activist]
Cleveland Amory calls ‘an army of the
kind.’ ”

In the seven years since the raid, PETA
has grown into an organization with an an-
nual budget of $2.5 million and some
200,000 members dedicated to ending the
use of animals as sources of food, fur, sport
and knowledge. Once regarded as a coali-
tion ruled by sentiment, the movement now
claims a presence on Capitol Hill, a solid
record of inspiring legislation and influenc—

ing public policy, a mainstream presence in
the movie “Project X” and the rock album
“Animal Liberation,” and a feared under-
ground arm -— the Animal Liberation
Front and other groups specializing in lab-
oratory break-ins and researcher intimida-
tion. Relentlessly (some would say reck-
lessly) assaulting not only the methods of
biomedical research but also its worth and
intent, the movement has created what sci—
entists call “a climate of fear” in the re-
search community, putting most research-
ers on the defensive and some out of busi—
ness.

Now it has come to Atlanta.

For years this city’s animal-rights activ—
ists worked in the shadow of their compa—
triots in California, Massachusetts, Penn-
sylvania, New York and Maryland, organ-
izing, demonstrating, writing letters,
seeking to inform the public of their posi—
tion — but never making much of an im-
pact. In the wake of the DeKalb pound de-
bate, however, there are indications that

 

Animal liberation
is in the air in
Atlanta. Rightists
hint at break-ins
at laboratories to
halt research.

 

national animal-rights leaders have taken
an interest in Atlanta and are ready to push
the movement to a new phase.

“Our scientists are very concerned,” says
Sylvia Wrobel, health sciences information
ofﬁcer at Emory. “They feel that things are
getting worse, and they fear that something
is going to happen.”

That something is an act of vandalism or
“animal liberation” at one of the labs. Al—
though they have been insulated from the
activities of the Animal Liberation Front,
Atlanta’s scientists 'are aware of the conse-
quences of practicing vivisection in an at-
mosphere of animal-rights activism — a
legacy of torched laboratories, slashed tires,
blood-spattered files, scrambled data, graf-
fiti—scarred homes and stolen research ani—
mals. Now, according to local animal-rights
leaders, an action of this sort is set to take
place in Atlanta.

“Animal liberation is in the air down
here,” says Gloria \Vilkins, Atlanta’s PETA
representative. “Do I think it’s going to
happen? I know it’s going to happen.”

“Something’s cooking in animal libera-
tion for Atlanta,” says Ginger Redmon,
now an employee of PETA in Washington,
DC. “I just can’t tell you what it is be-
cause that will blow it.”

The question, then, is not “has the ani-
mal-rights movement attained a measure of
power in Atlanta?” It has, and it is likely
to grab for more. The real question, the
hard question, is “how will that power af-
fect the lives of Atlanta’s citizens?” For
while many Atlantans might join the hue
and cry against the more frivolous aspects
of animal use — furs, veal and the testing
of cosmetics and household products ~—
they might lapse into silence if they thought
that for every animal spared by groups such
as PETA, a potentially lifesaving medical
technology has fallen by the wayside. Yet
there is evidence that something of this sort
is already happening, and that for all its
good intentions the animal-rights move-
ment has endangered the future of
biomedical research — leaving many to
wonder whether animal activists should be
chastized or cheered.

To answer this question, it is best to re-
turn to the battle over pound seizure in
DeKalb County.

In the fall of 1986, Gloria Wilkins re-
ceived a telephone call from a young
woman who wanted to know about PETA
and what she could do to further the cause
of animals in Atlanta. In the course of their
conversation, \Vilkins explained the tenets
of animal rights and promised to send the
woman a copy of Animal Liberation. Then
the caller said that her name was Ginger
Schulman (since then, she has had it le—
gally changed to Redmon), and that her
mother was DeKalb County Commissioner
Sherry Schulman. Later, Wilkins would re-
member that “I said to myself, ‘Well, Glo-
ria, this is your lucky day.’ ” , 1

By the spring of 1987, Redmon had be—
come, in her mother’s words, “a real con-
veit to animal rights.” Having discovered
that animals from the DeKalb shelter were
going to research institutions for experi-
mentation, she began studying local ordi-
nances to see how the policy could be
changed. Then, in May, she met Cam
MacQueen, a young DeKalb resident inter-
ested in animal issues, and with the guid-
ance of Wilkins, John McArdle of the New
England Antivivisection Society, and the
National Coalition to Protect Our Pets, the
two formed the DeKalb coalition. Over the
summer, Redmon and MacQueen contin-
ued researching the issue and tried to sell
their ideas to each member of the county
commission. Finally, on Sept. 1, at. a work
session of the DeKalb commissioners,
Sherry Schulman introduced the idea of
changing the county ordinance to prohibit
the sale of shelter animals for research.

It was not an auspicious debut for Red—
mon or MacQueen. “On one side was this
huge contingent of doctors from Emory -—
it must have been about 10 people -— and
on the other was Cam, my mother and
myself,” says Redmon. “The entire session
lasted about two hours, and if I had to
guess, I’d say we were given about 15 min-
utes to speak and Emory about an hour
and 45.” Although Commissioner Schul-
man and the coalition insisted that they just

 




wanted to restore public trust in the shelter
and not end animal experimentation, the
Emory contingent “kept trying to broaden
the issue and bring it back to their right to
experiment on animals,” says Schulman.
“While I still haven’t made my mind up
about that right, an antivivisection law is
not part of my agenda. We just don’t want
them experimenting on animals that might
have been pets. The shelter should do what
its name implies —— provide a shelter for
lost and abandoned animals. It was never
intended to be a warehouse for research-
ers.”

Two weeks later, there was another work
session on the issue, and this time Red—
mon, MacQteen and Commissioner
Schulman brought their own contingent
and their own authority on the use of ani-
mals in research, Dr. Neal Barnard. Bar—
nard insisted on drawing a distinction be-
tween the death of a pound animal and the
death of an animal bred for research, and
Manuel Maloof answered him with the
speech that the Cable News Network
broadcast all over the country. Although
Commissioner Schulman never asked the

commission to vote on the county’s animal

control policies (“She knew she didn’t have
votes,” Maloof says), the media responded
with a flurry of stories, and the DeKalb

County Superior Court responded to the

coalition’s lawsuit with a permanent re-

straining order on the sale of animals for
research.

In December, Ginger Redmon moved to
Washington. Leaving ambiguity to the un-
converted, she speaks confidently of her
work on pound seizure, certain that her co-
alition not only helped free the county
shelter from the specter of torture, but also
focused attention on animal-control issues
previously neglected. Indeed, last autumn’s
furor over the shelter has left an impressive
legacy of reform: an animal-control com-
mittee that has been charged with review-
ing the county’s policies, $1.05 million ear—
marked for the construction of a new shel—
ter, and the likelihood of a spay-neuter
program.

“All those pro-animal groups have been
very positive for us,” says Captain H.C.
Wood, the man who runs the DeKalb shel—
ter. “It’s kind of like the traffic light that’s
been out of order for a while. If 10 people
get killed at the intersection, someone
comes out and fixes it.”

Where the happy endings stop, however,
is in the effect of the “ban on pound sei-

_ zure” on biomedical research at places such
as Emory.

 

In his testimony, Dr. Neal Barnard as—
sured his listeners that research would be
improved, not hampered, if scientific insti-
tutions were denied access to the DeKalb
County shelter. A veteran of similar de—
bates across the country, he is a polished
witness, and after listening to him repeat
his contention that all responsible research—
ers use purpose-bred dogs in their experi—
ments, one might believe that the animal-

 




rights movement exists solely to further the
cause of science.

However, none of the practicing scien-
tists interviewed for this article accepted Dr.
Barnard’s opinions. Although such a state-
ment invites an obvious response from an—
imal—rightists —- of course they don’t ac-
cept it; he’s called their bluff — the re-
search community’s low opinion of Dr.
Barnard does not seem rooted so much in
the fact that he stands against them as in
the fact the has never stood alongside them.
The man’s a psychiatrist, scientists like to
say, and he’s never done a day of research
in his life. They also call Barnard’s beliefs
about pound dogs “absurd,” “preposter-
ous,” “pseudoscience” and “inappropriate
statements that fly in the face of reality.”

That last characterization of Barnard’s
testimony is from Dr. Robert Guyton, an
associate professor of surgery at Emory and
one of the most successful open-heart sur—
geons in Atlanta. Described by one of his
technicians as “an example of someone
who can do research that has a direct clin-
ical application,” Guyton spends a great
deal of time in the laboratory, working out
new surgical techniques. On pound dogs,
he has devised a method for cooling the
heart during bypass surgery in order to
preserve health tissue while he stops the
heart from beating; on pound dogs, he has
been working to perfect a technique that
would employ a chemical solution and
heart-lung machine to reverse the damage
to heart muscle stricken by heart attack.
(For his trouble, he has been hung in effigy
during demonstrations on the Emory cam-
pus.) Understandably, he takes umbrage at
assertions that pound dogs are unsuitable
research subjects.

“True, there are some types of experi-
ments that require purpose-bred dogs, ex—
periments where you need to know the
background and genealogy of the animal,”
he says. “For the most part, though, pur-
pose-bred animals are not more suitable or
less suitable — they are just more expen-
sive.”

Guyton points out that “six blocks from
my office, 7,000 dogs are killed each year
at the [Atlanta Humane Society] shelter,”
yet. he has to import dogs from kennels out
of state. (The number of animals euthan-
ized in DeKalb is similar to the number de-
stroyed in Fulton —— 9,355 in 1985, 8,478 in
1986, 4,848 in the ﬁrst six months of 1987.)
In 1986, Emory scientists experimented on
— and eventually killed, or, in research
parlance, “sacrificed” — 640 dogs from
DeKalb County at a cost to the researcher
of $50 to $90 apiece. Now, with Emory no
longer buying animals from DeKalb (shel-
ters in Fulton, Cobb and Gwinnett do not
supply animals for research), scientists a:;.
paying $275 to $400 per dog. Since univer-
sity science is fueled for the most part by
federal grants, and grants offer the scien—
tist a finite amount of money to complete
a study, the loss of pound dogs has re-
sulted, at least for Guyton, in “a decrease
in the work we’ve been able to do.

“Because of the cost of dogs, what we’re
heading for in the laboratory is a move to-
ward working with pigs and sheep. Unfor-
tunately, that will require some repetition
of the work that’s been done on dogs over
the last 20 or 30 years — we don’t know the
pig’s heart as well as we do the dog’s heart,
and we will lose at least a year in our re-
search.”

What Guyton most fears, however, is the
effect of high costs on the research of
young scientists. “[The loss of pound dogs]
affects them a lot more than it does me.
I’m fairly established. But an increase in
costs tends to weed out young investigators
on tight budgets.”

How has the loss of pound dogs affected
research in other states? The question elic-
its two responses. According to Sherry
Schulman, “Maryland and Massachusetts
have statewide bans on pound seizure, and
neither Harvard nor Johns Hopkins have
felt any ill effects.” According to Dr. An—
thony Monaco, however, professor of sur-

 

The DeKalb coalition
insisted its only

gery at Harvard and chief of transplant
surgery at New England Deaconess Hos—
pital, the Massachusetts ban has been “a
disaster. The cost of dogs is astronomical,
and profiteers steal dogs in neighboring
states and truck them to Massachusetts to
be sold at an exorbitant rate. The taxpayer
gets a fifth of the research for his money
and we have the black marketing of dogs.
The whole thing is outrageous, an example
of how politicians have caved in to a vio-
lent lobby. It hasn’t prevented dogs from
being used, and it hasn’t saved a single an-
imal’s life. It is the most absurd thing in the
world.”

he research community and the ani-

mal-rights movement have promoted
two different versions of what happens to
a cat or a dog when it leaves a county shel-
ter and enters a research institution.

In the research community’s version, the
animal is not selected for experimentation
until it has been slated for euthanasia at the
shelter -— until it has gone unclaimed for
seven days, been deemed unadoptable or
had the misfortune of being a “give-up,”
turned in by its owner. The animal is then
taken to the institution and “conditioned”
- wormed, vaccinated, treated for fleas

and any diseases. At the institution, it is
tended by a veterinarian and housed in ac-
cordance with standards established by the
federal Animal Welfare Act or the Public
Health Act. Nine times out of 10, it dies
painlessly, in the same manner that it
would die at the shelter — by an overdose
of the anesthesia administered during re—
search. If it must survive the experiment,
painkillers minimize its suffering. To make
sure that no animals die in frivolous, un-
necesary or abusive experiments, an insti-
tutional animal-use committee examines
grant proposals and, with the input of at
least one nonscientist and one member of
the community at large, has the power to
reject unsuitable research.

In the animal-rights version, the animal
selected for research is likely to be big and
docile — at one time, probably someone’s
pet. It is taken from the shelter, sometimes
before the completion of the seven-day
waiting period, trucked across town and
left to wait on a loading dock. Once at the
institution, it can languish in a cramped
and often filthy cage for months at a time.
Expecting a kind hand, it is ushered into a
laboratory, where the provisions of the An—
imal Welfare Act are suspended and the
scientist can proceed according to his
imagination. There is no guarantee that the
animal will be properly anesthetized. There
is no certainty that it won’t be used again
and again in painful experiments. In the
end, its fate will be summed up in a rhyme
promulgated by PETA: “Unseen they suf-
fer, unheard they cry; in agony they linger,
in loneliness they die.”

In all likelihood, the first version would
not exist without the second. Often obli—
vious to the concerns of animals in the
past, scientists admit that the animal-rights
movement — and its relentless documen-
tation of laboratory abuses —— has stung
them into a new ethical awareness. Main—
taining that PETA’s litany of horrors ar—
gues against animal abuse rather than ani-
mal research, many profess their embrace
of the traditional “Three R’s” of animal-
welfare (as opposed to animal-rights) or-
ganizations: replacement of animals where
feasible alternatives exist, reduction in
numbers where possible and refinement of
techniques to minimize pain.

“We haven’t gotten closer to science,”
says Bill Garrett, director of the Atlanta
Humane Society; “science has gotten closer
to us. For far too long, the medical com-
munity felt that the ends always justified
the means. Now that attitude seems to be
changing. I know some scientists who have
gotten to be real ‘humaneiacs.’ ”

In their literature and public statements,
however, animal-rights activists have made
it clear that they are not content to be the
conscience of vivisectionists and that they
view the “Three R’s” as mere steps: along
the way to their ultimate goal: the abniiition
of animal research. Certain that any use of
animals for human ends is an expression of
“speciesism” and therefore the moral
equivalent of racism and Nazism, animal

 




rightists reject the moderation of animal-
welfare groups, spurning any accommoda-
tion with a medical establishment that al-
lows and, in their minds, encourages the
abuse of animals. They do not care that
some scientists might be trying to conform
to humane standards; they are not swayed
by the investigator’s plea that 90 percent of
research involves rodents. For the animal
rightist, the scientist sins the moment he
identifies the rat, the cat, the dog or the
chimp as an inferior and deems it a suit-
able tool for the extraction of knowledge.

“We’ve never been afraid to take the
hard line,” says Ingrid Newkirk of PETA.
“Anything that improves the living and
dying conditions of animals is fine, but
we’ve never been satisfied with just a little
bit. The same thing that you want for other
human beings we want for other beings
who do not happen to be human. You
don’t have the right to use your neighbor’s
child in an experiment; you shouldn’t have
the right to use your neighbor’s dog in an
experiment.

“Animal experimentation is the worst in
our nature, and the mindset is more horri~
ble than the blood.”

In demonstrations, animal rightists often
carry a poster marketed by PETA. The
poster portrays a rhesus monkey immobi-
lized in a restraining device, its posture
suggestive of crucifixion, and proclaims in
graf f ittilike scrawl: “THts ls VlVlSECTION;
DON’T LET ANYONE TELL You le’l‘liR-
ENT.” The absolutism of the message is in—
structive. In animal—rights literature, there
are no worthwhile experiments, no dogs
dying painlessly, no scientist with motives
untainted by the profit—hungry medical es~
tablishment. If biomedical science has by
and large moved to a more humane direc-
tion, no activists will ever hear about it, for
in their newsletters and magazines, they see
only the worst. outrages the system allows
— the exceptions defining the rule.

“Their view of medical research is based
on what their own propaganda has told
them about medical research,” says Dr.
Guyton, and his assessment, although
harsh, is accurate. Most animal—rights ac-
tivists have no scientific background and are
admittedly not interested in acquiring one.
Says Jane Bass of the Georgia Earth Alli-
ance: “Researchers say I’m naive; I say
they’re naive. They say I’m simplistic; 1 say
they‘re simplistic. They say I don’t under-
stand what they’re trying to do. But I don’t
have to understand what they’re trying to
do. I’ve done my job. I’m a grass-roots ac-
tivist; it’s up to the next generation of ac-
tivists to gain the expertise.”

“Emory gave me a printout of all the ex-
periments they‘re doing, and it‘s gobbledy-
gook,” says Ginger Redmon. “I can’t be-
lieve taxpayers have to pay for that stuff
[through federal grants].”

Out of ignorance has come hostility.
Barred from the labs, animal rightists have
come to look upon the trappings of science
—— the white coats. the arcane language. the
air of inviolability -— as instruments of

oppression, symbols of the scientist’s ab-
solute license. Their faith in the crimes
being committed behind closed doors is
unwavering.

Ginger Redmon: “I know they don’t use
anesthesia when they operate on dogs at
Emory.” How does she know? “I just
know.”

Gloria Wilkins, showing the videotape of
the Taub lab: “This tape will show you how
sloppy these labs are.” Taub’s lab? “All of
them, really.”

Jane Bass: “Why do they have children
dissecting animals and learning insensitiv-
ity in school? So they don’t question the
researchers when they get older. It’s a
whole rotten system that should be cleaned
up.”

For many years, the church warred
against science, fearing the consequences of
unfettered investigation. Now another sys-
tem of belief has challenged science’s role.
“Pure objective science would put us all at
risk,” says lngrid Newkirk. “It has to be

 

Rights activists

are more interested
in grants and glory
than in improving
the health of humans

 

tempered. It cannot stand without an ethi-
cal spine.” Though no one would doubt
Newkirk’s contentions, researchers fear the
consequences of allowing groups such as
PETA to police their work.

lthough animal-rights leaders argue

that their movement is not “anti—sci-
ence,” they do acknowledge their kinship
to Europe’s Green parties and other ele-
ments of the “global holistic movement.”
Indeed, more than a dispute over one’s
right to study laboratory mice, the animal-
rights debate encapsulates age-old tensions
between Eastern and Western thought,
spirituality and scientific method, physi-
cians counseling prevention and scientists
seeking cure. On the one side: pragmatists
who see nature as a constant struggle for
survival, who view the idea of giving rights
to animals as a precursor to social break-
down, and who justify animal research with
the question: “Who is more important, a
rat or a child?” On the other: idealists who
see nature as a state of innocence, out of
which man has fallen. “We cannot con—
tinue to live with an ‘us-or—them’ atti-
tude," says Newkirk. “We are not at war

with the animals.”

To appreciate the immensity of the gulf
between the two points of view, you need
only ask what would happen if an antivi-
visection law became a reality.

“If you woke up tomorrow and there was
a law against animal experimentation, sci-
ence would become science again,” says
Newkirk. “There’d be innovation and
competition and imagination. The scientist
wouldn’t be able to go to work and say,
‘Well, I’m going to knock in the brains of
a cat today. Or drown a rat. Instead of
harming animals we’d be helping people.”

For practicing researchers, however, a
law banning vivisection would represent the
final defeat of science by forces inimical to
it. Although animal-rightists have always
claimed that animal “models” could be re-
placed by such alternatives as computer
modeling and tissue culture (“If research—
ers are so smart, why can’t they come up
with other ways?” asks Jane Bass), scien—
tists insist that progress depends upon their
access to biological systems.

“As one who does both computer mod—
eling and animal experimentation, l can tell
you conclusively that computers are not
enough,” says Dr.William Weintraub, an
Emory cardiologist. “A computer is a ma-
chine; what it can tell you depends on the
information you put into it, and I don’t
think we’ll ever know enough for the com-
puter to replace biological systems.”

“It is inappropriate to try new things out
on humans without going through animal
research,” says Guyton. “Animal labora-
tories take the things that are developed in
tissue cultures and computer models and
test their applicability in a biological sys—
tem. The laboratory is the intermediate step
between the benchwork and the patient-
care delivery system.”

“If you can’t use animal models. your
research stops and stops cold,” says Dr.
Roy Bakay, an Emory neurosurgeon and
Yerkes researcher who employed rat and
monkey models in the development of rev-
olutionary treatments for Parkinson’s Dis-
ease. “You’re back to trial and error.”

ln their attack on the means of animal
research, animal-rights activists have sought
also to invalidate the ends. They condemn
most research as frivolous and unneces-
sary, invoking the name of John Darsee -
the cardiology fellow who turned out reams
of fraudulent research at Emory and Har-
vard —— like a talisman. They say that in-
vestigators are less interested in improving
human health than in grabbing grants and
glory.

“Some think they’re hot on the trail,”
says Newkirk. “But that isn’t the case with
most of them. I ask them how many ani‘
mals they’ve used in their career. I ask them
how much tax money they’ve used. Then I
ask what they’ve achieved that has contrib—
uted to human well-being. No, not the va
lio vaccine. What have you done? 1 have yet
to ﬁnd something.”

“No one should kid themselves that an-
imal research, or even research in general,

 




has been the foundation of human health,”
says Dr. Barnard. By advocating preven- ;
tion instead of cure and pouring money
into education instead of animal research,
the medical establishment could, according
to Dr. Barnard, cut the cancer rate in half 1
and come to grips with the true causes of ,
heart disease —— lifestyle and the ingestion
of animal fat.
“Research only scratches the surface of i
health,” says Barnard. “For all the work L
done on dogs, no amount of research in the ‘
world can save you if you decide to smoke
cigarettes.”
It is a formulation that suggests we are
to blame for our own ills and implicitly
questions our right to make animals suffer '
for our salvation. Scientists, however, argue 3
that it ignores the host of diseases that ap-
pear to have nothing to with lifestyle, that
sneak out of our genes or environment and
bedevil us with nature’s cruel genius. In the
past, animal research has proven instru- 1
mental in the development of insulin, open-
heart surgery, transplantation technology, .
antibiotics and a host of vaccines for every- '
thing from polio to hepatitis B. For the fu-
ture, scientists are peering into the systems 3
of living animals for keys to Parkinson’s, i
Alzheimer’s, cancer, a score of genetic dis-
eases and a transplant repertoire that would
include bones and intestines.
How important has animal research been
to the development of modern medicine?
“I’ve heard it suggested that people who
want to stop animal research should wear a
bracelet that says, ‘ln case of emergency, 1
will forgo all treatment,’ ” says Dr. Doug- ,
las McClure, a Yerkes scientist in charge of '
developing monkey and chimpanzee models 1
for AIDS drugs and vaccines. “Just about ,
anything a hospital can do has been done
on animals first.”
It is easy to say that animal research has ‘
been useful; it is more difficult to ascertain t
that it is moral. For some physicians, pro— :
gress has its own morality; when a medical
advance is within reach, they believe we ab-
rogate our moral responsibility if we pass it ‘
by. For animal rightists such as Dr. Bar-
nard, the choices are just as clear. “Even if
good did come from animal research,” he
says, “that wouldn’t make it right. I could i
say that slaves built Atlanta, and that
wouldn’t make slavery right, would it?”
His question challenges the pragmatist’s
defense of animal research, and it is nearly
impossible to answer. It does, however,
warrant a question in return. We live in a
world of compromise and hard choices.
From the beginning, we have chosen to
erect the edifice of medical knowledge on
the backs of animals. Now, because of the
insights gleaned front a sometimes savage
tradition. a man with a dead heart can find
a new one, and a woman wracked by dis-
ease can hope for a cure. We might wonder
if humankind has acted ethically. But if
humankind is given the choice of inhabit-
ing a world of medical possibility or a .
world of moral certainty, which way will ;
humankind choose to go?

Seven cocker spaniel puppies that were res-

Couple charged with cruelty

Spike, Spock, Annie, Priscilla and their three
siblings are considered crucial evidence in a crimi-
nal investigation.

Ottis Moore, president of the Cherokee County
Humane Society. considers the seven cocker span-
iel puppies lucky to be alive.

The puppies were allegedly buried in a shallow
pit last week by 3 Cherokee County couple whose
dog had the litter four weeks ago, said Lt. Michael
Evans of the Cherokee County Sheriff's
Department.

They were rescued by a sheriffs deputy after

I It
spending three days in the ground with no food or
water, Evans said,

Authorities have since charged Rodney and
Christina Ammons of Woodstock with one count
each of cruelty to animals, Evans said.

Sheriff‘s deputies said they believe the couple
buried the pup ie to dispose of them.

However, Christina Ammons said five of the
seven puppies had already been promised to pro-
spective owners and. that they were only keeping
them until they were old enough to give away.

Mrs. Ammons said her husband and son built a
cave-like shelter so that the puppies would not

wander from their unfenced yard.

“We felt they needed some
fresh air," she said. “They were
not covered up."

According to Mrs. Ammons, the
shelter had an opening and sufti
Cient food.

“Things like this make my
blood run cold.” said Moore. who
is keeping the puppies until new
homes can be found for them.

According to Moore. the pup-
pies were still trembling when
they were brought to his home,
but became more extroverted once
they were warm and fed. He said
his wife named four of them, but
three were so similar she couldn’t
distinguish between them well
enough to give them names.

A neighbor who had heard the
puppies crying for two days said
she called the sheriff's depart-
ment after she discovered the

puppies buried in the Ammons
yard.

The woman. who request
anonymity, said she found t
puppies in a 1-by-11/i2-foot pit the
had been covered with a board.
dirt. rocks and pine straw.

“When I opened it up, six little
puppies came out and I just about
had a stroke, it made me so mad.”
she said.

The seventh puppy was so

The woman said the puppies

minutes. “Then they went back
into the hole like it was the only
thing they knew," she said.

Meanwhile, the mother of the
puppies was locked in the base-

The March 11 death of 2-year-old
Chatt Hyder at the fangs of pit bull
terriers is worse than a tragedy. It is
worse than the tragic November 1986
death of 4-year-old Billy Gordon Jr. It

is worse, because we allowed such a ‘

fatal attack to happen again.

The question is how can such
tragedies be prevented. The Hyder
child 5 death has once again brought
'the controversy over pit bulls to the
forefront of community attention.

Activists are again calling for county
officials to ban pit bulls from DeKalb,
despite legislation already in place to
hold pet owners responsible for the
vicious acts of their animals.

Hayward Turnipseed, the owner of
the pit bull that mauled the Gordon
child, was convicted of manslaughter
and sentenced to five years in prison
and five years probation, the first

It was more than just a live-
stock show at Wills Park in Al-
pharetta on Sunday: It was a lla-
ma-rama.

Llama breeders and dealers
came from throughout the South-
east, and almost 100 adult and
baby llamas made Alpharetta their
home for the weekend during the
Sunshine States Llama Associa-
tion’s (SSLA) Llama Fair ’88. The
ﬁrst llama exhibition in Georgia,
the fair was an attempt to educate
the public about the livestock.

“I’m impressed,” said Libby
Watson, who traveled from Salis-
bury, N.C. Mrs. Watson, who saw
her ﬁrst llama a few months ago
on a local TV show, said she was
thinking about buying some llamas
to complement the cows she and
her husband keep on their farm.

why I couldn't want something

“She got it in her head that
she liked them, and here we are.”
said Artie Watson. “I stick to more
standard pets, like dogs. I’m begin-
ning to come around, though."

It is common knowledge that
llama hair makes excellent sweat-
ers, but most of the llama owners
at the exhibition raise their ani-
mals for breeding purposes. Lla-
maphiles stress that llamas make
excellent pets because of their
docile nature. According to the In-
ternational Llama Association
(ILA) in Denver, there are about
12,000 llamas in the United States,
mostly in the Midwest and West.-
ern states. '

Patrice Cook, who belongs to
both the SSLA and ILA, said there
are more than 100 llamas in the
state. Mrs. Cook started.5 years
ago with one llama and now has 40
on her farm in Covington, Ga.

See LLAMAS, Page 4B

 




The gentle animals participated in events
that included an obstacle course, a public re—
lations contest (during which the animals
stood around looking cute) a pack demonstra-
tion and a llama parade. The 500 spectators
were content to watch in wonder as the huge-
eyed beasts stood on display while Andean
ﬂute music played over a boom box. .

i The onlookers did seem suitably im-
pressed by the series of tricks performed by
llamas named Fanciful Lord and Linus. They
walked through an inner tube, over a seesaw
and under a rope while an announcer exhort-
ed the crowd to “Give the llamas a big hand
folks — these are talented llamas.”

Talented or not, llamas were a topic of de-
bate during this year’s session of the Georgia
General Assembly. Rep. Terry Lawler (D-
Clarkdale) introduced a bill allowmg llama

owners to sue if their investment is killed by a
dog. One of Lawler’s constituents is a llama
owner who asked that he sponsor the bill,
which died in a state Senate committee.

Llamas also came to the attention of the
federal government in 1984 when the Agricul-
ture Department ruled it would allow the im-
portation of 350 llamas and alpacas, a smaller
cousin. Those animals, which are native to the
mountain areas of Chile and Peru. were
banned from importation to the United States
in the 19303 because it was feared they would
spread hoof-and-mouth disease. _

Animal lover gets

By Fred Smith
Yavapai County Bureau

MAYER — At some point in the
past several years, Freddie Menke’s
love affair with the animal kingdom
got out of hand.

Indeed, Mcnke’s dogs became the
scourge of a rural neighborhood a few
miles north of Mayer, according to
sheriff’s reports and testimony in
Justice Court. .

Neighboring ranchers reported that
cows and calves had been killed by
dogs, although no one could prove the
attackers belong to Menke.

Two mothers complained that dogs
terrorized their children walking be-
tween their homes and a school-bus
stop.
It got so bad that folks were taking
up arms for protection.

Lynn Essenburg told ofﬁcers that
she shot and killed a dog that was
part of a pack of 12 or 14 that was
about to attack her registered bull.

Bill Carter said he shot two dogs
after he watched them kill a calf he
owned. .

N
wes Conlan, an animal-control
officer, testified be counted anywhere
from seven to 130 dogs during his
visits to Menke’s place. It was
apparent, be indicated, that Menke
had little control over them.

Another officer, Jonee Davis, said
in an interview that attempts to get
Menke to take control of the situation

 

had failed. Not only were the dogs

getting loose, she said, but Menke’s
property was a health hazard, with
piles of trash and dog excrement
surrcunding the house.

Baring the past several weeks,
Menke apparently got the message.
He cleaned up the property, cleaned
up the water pond, built some fencing
and took 15 dogs to a veterinarian for
shots and licensing, it was brought out
during testimony.

The only problem there, Menke
said, was that the veterinarian ran out
of license tags.

In court Friday, Menke agreed to

cut of dcghouse

 

“I won’t go along with
cruelty, because, by God,
'I’m not cruel to them.
These dogs are my life. I
treat them better than I

ATTLESNAKES ~

 

Uncontrolled roundups are having bad effect on environment

Every year from late February
through April, thousands of people at-
tend rattlesnake roundups, some of the
more famous and eccentric events to

. be found in the Southwest. Annually,
, 15 to 30 of these “roundups” take place
' across Texas; perhaps a half-dozen oc-
. ?‘ ~ . ' cur elsewhere. Some are small affairs;
DAV _ others are major events, worth hun-
BARKER dreds of thousands, even millions, of
dollars to the sponsoring organizations

and communities, such as in Sweetwater.

Roundups are weekends of flea markets, dances, beauty
contests, beer, parties, food and crowds. And all of these
activities revolve around a “pit” of captive rattlesnakes,
whose numbers increase throughout the roundup as hunt—
ers bring in their catches to be counted and weighed.

Rattlesnake hunting once was confined to the period of
the roundup, and the first roundups of 30 years ago were
scheduled at this time of the year for a reason. During late
winter and early spring, western diamondback rattlesnakes
haul themselves up from underneath the ground to let the
sun‘s rays drive the chill of the winter's hibernation from
their bodies.

Driven by instincts millions of years old, groups of dia-
mond backs congregate at these wintering sites on the south-
east facing of hillsides and blu’ffs; it is here that breeding
occurs. Some animals travel more than 15 miles from their

:5-

 

summer territories to join these congregations; in mid-

spring they will return to those territories, following invisi-
ble scent-marked trails that are probably older than
recorded history.

Normally, diamondbacks spend a great deal of time be-
low the surface, to escape the cold of winter and intense
summer heat. It is in the early spring, at the dens, that dia-
mond backs come out in plain sight during the day.

The original purpose of roundups and. rattlesnake hunt-
ing was to lessen the perceived risk diamondbacks might
pose for livestock and as a celebration of the advent of
spring. Local families and friends went out to known
wintering sites of large numbers of diamondbacks, spent
the day titling them and had a big picnic. Now, it is unusual

‘ to encounter a den of more than 10 or 20 diamondbacks. '_

, be held in town. The rattlesnakes would be collected live ,

w.“

Some years ago, the roundups changed. Undoubtedly, it i

E was some civic-minded person who suggested that roundups i

l

and displayed for all to see. A contest was created with pub- ?

licity, money and trophies as incentives. ,
Diamondbacks, because they are relatively large snakes, r

I are incredibly efficient animals. They can go amazingly

long periods between food and water. It is not unusual for
rattlesnake hunters to “stockpile“ them, keeping dozens or

' even hundreds together in dark plywood boxes, without

food or water, for more than two years to have a winning

. entry at a roundup.

Enormous numbers of animals-die while stockpiled due
to starvation, dehydration or illness resulting from collect-
ing techniques. Since only living snakes can be entered in a -
roundup contest, the bodies are pulled from the masses of

living snakes and skinned, so they won’t be a total flos‘s.~.ItA

isn’t unusual for the winning entry to number more than
500 animals.

As the roundups grew into the media events that they
are today, so too did the enticements. Rattlesnake hunting
became a. year-round activity. Today, according to
rattlesnake hunters, 95 percent or more of the rattlesnakes
at any given roundup are not collected the weekend of the
roundup and are not collected in the vicinity of the
roundup.

More enticement to collect diamondbacks came with
what has been termed the “Western craze.” In 1980, the
movie Urban Cowboy popularized Western fashion across
the nation. Suddenly, diamondbacks were worth money.
Businesses were set up to buy diamondbacks on a year-
round basis, and their hides were made into boots, hat-
bands, vests and belts. The hide buyers found a small mar-
ket for rattlesnake meat. Then they found an immense mar-
ket for the gall bladders of diamondbacks in the Orient,
where the gall bladders of many venomous snakes are used
in folk medicine.

These markets are sufficiently lucrative to support the
purchase of diamondbacks at the price of $3 to $5 per pound.
In both 1986 and 1987, professional rattlesnake merchants
purchased between 400,000 and 500,000 western diamond-
back rattlesnakes in Texas, including the 40,000 or so sup-
plied by roundups each year.

Most diamondback rattlesnakes are collected by a ,
method known as “gassing." A puff of gasoline is sprayed '
into crevices in the ground, and the fumes drive snakes to ‘
the surface, where they can be captured.

Countless varieties of insects, snails, arachnids and other
invertebrates live below the ground. Salamanders, frogs
turtles, lizards and snakes all spend time in burrows. Then

 

M M“ V




j are very few mammals that do not occasionally take refuge

* underground, and many species may spend the majority of
their lives there, such as moles, shrews, prairie dogs,
weasels, mice and rats.

Recent research sponsored by Texas Parks and Wildlife
and conducted at the University of Texas at Arlington dem-
onstrates that the practice of gassing is harmful, usually
lethal, to any animals subjected to it. Diamondbacks appear
to be the most resistant to the gas fumes, but their lungs are
permanently damaged. .

The uncontrolled hunting of rattlesnakes and the prac-
tice of gassing constitute largely unrecognized but quite se-
rious problems for Texas Diamondback rattlesnakes are ma-
‘jor predators of rodents and rabbits in the western two
thirds of Texas; rattlesnakes are a natural and important
part of the balance of nature. Rodents and rabbits cause esti-
mated billions of dollars of agricultural loss annually in
Texas. While rattlesnakes may occasionally bite livestock,
any resulting loss is insignificant in comparison.

More significantly, to accommodate the capture of hun-
dreds of thousands of diamondbacks annually, the practice
of gassing is now so widespread that it may cause the deaths
of millions of other animals of untargeted species.

Large areas of Texas are being turned into deserts of life,
devoid of all creatures that rely on subterranean habitats. It
is without question an ecological disaster of great magni-
tude and as yet unknown consequences. A small number of
people are being allowed to poison the land for very short—
sighted gains and for “sport.”

If rattlesnakes are to be hunted for profit, the practice
must be controlled. For the sake of much of the wildlife of
Texas. it is time for the state to elevate the western dia-
mondback rattlesnake to the status of “game animal” and
create bag and possession limits, such as exist for other ani-
mals of commercial value.

An ordinance making the practice of gassing illegal, sim-
ilar to those enacted in other States, also is necessary, but
that alone cannot control the problem.

Such ordinances need not have negative effect on festivi-
ties known as- rattlesnake roundups. While some partici-
pants may be reluctant to give it up, the contest aspect of
roundups is outdated and only peripheral to the many posi-
tive community activities.

The stated goal of roundups was once to drive
rattlesnakes to extinction; today that seems frighteningly
possible, and along with the extinction of the rattlesnake
will come the extinction of many other species of animals.
Such a goal was never their right. All citizens of Texas, and
of the Southwest, have a stake in a healthy balance of na-
ture.

It is time to recognize the rattlesnake as an integral part
of our natural heritage. '

Born to Be Wild

HEN MY CHILDREN FOUND THE

baby bird, I prepared them for

the worst: “It won’t live through

the night,” I said, ever the

pessimist. “They never do.” But
this one did, an ugly, reptilian-looking
day-old starling that had fallen out of
its nest under the eaves. The wildlife
expert I consulted said to feed it
canned cat food, a couple of globs on
the eraser end of a pencil shoved ‘
down its throat every 20 minutes
from dawn to dusk. Miss a feeding, I
was told, and it would die.

You think having children ties you
down? Try rescuing a baby bird. But it
worked, and Peeper—that’s what the
bird said and what my children named

it—grew into a raucous ﬂedgling.
Believing that wildings should be
wild, I let Peeper go when he was
ready to ﬂy and feed on his own. But
he wouldn’t let us go. He was free to
leave but chose to be my family’s
constant companion. Every time one
of us stepped outdoors, we’d hear a
churring call and a ﬂutter of feathers,
and Peeper would make a ﬂapping
landing on our heads or shoulders.
He worked in the garden with me,

my avian companion and pest-control
expert, snapping up the grubs I
uncovered while weeding. But he
could be a royal pain, too. He fell
down the chimney, ﬂew into the
house, dive-bombed the UPS man,
almost zoomed off with my car keys
and insisted on sitting on my shoulder
and squawking in my ear.

The bird never associated with

3 other starlings, though, and I
wondered if he thought of himself as a

small feathered human. According to
Joan Smith, a biological technician at
the National Zoo, “This phenomenon
is called imprinting and often occurs
when baby birds are rescued and
rehabilitated by humans. [Later] the
human contact fades, and they can
revert to the wild.”

By early fall, Peeper was taking
trial ﬂights with neighborhood ‘
starlings, tentatively ﬂuttering on the
edge of their growing ﬂocks. One
clear, cool morning, a ﬂock ﬂew low

» over the rooftop, and he heard its call.

We watched as he leaped into the air
and joined his relatives as they gained
altitude. He called once, with that
distinctive starling churr, and was
gone. We never saw him again.

So now, when I hear people
complaining about starlings—how
they overpower bird feeders and soil

 

buildings and statues—I think of that

irascible ball of feathers. And I
remember these lines from a poem
anthropologist Loren Eiseley wrote

‘ about a bird he knew:

It is years now
but I still lie awake and listen in the
mornings.
How does a man say to his fellows
that he has been enchanted by a
bird? I

Your Excellency:

It is extremely difficult for someone like myself - who has been
taught to love animals, especially dogs and cats - to understand
why Koreans eat dogs and cats.

This is completely repulsive to me, and hard to understand how
something like this could still be going on in the so-called
civilized world of the 20th Century.

I first heard of this about a year ago, and I did some letter-
writing about it. I understood that this practice was discon-
tinued, but DOW-I am advised it is still going on, and I have
been sent picture to show dogs going to market in cages, and
dogs being displayed at street markets in Korea.

In View of the coming Summer Olympics in your county, I feel
this is going to leave a very bad impression on people who Will
attend the Olympics, and who come from countries where a dog
and a cat is considered a pet — not something to be eaten.

I could send you dozens of stories about the value of dogs in
America = the lives they have saved in disasters; how they are
serving as "Seeing—Eyes" for the blind; "Hearing—Ears" for the
deaf, and numerous other valuable services.

Our doctors have stated that having a pet is very definitely a
plus for the elderly in that they help them cope better, live
better, and live longer.

GRIT - April 3-9, 198

By WALTER R. FLETCHER.

Doberman pinscher,

Gridiron's Air Coryell, named after

Don Coryell, former coach of the
National Football League’s San
Diego Chargers, is America‘s dog
hero of 1987.

The 6-year-old black and tan,
known as Jet, and her owners,
Candy and George Sangster of

Sepulveda, Calif., were honored in

Washington as part of the
ceremonies celebrating Dog Hero
Week. For the Sangsters, there

was a medial, and for the heroine, a

year’s supply of dog food.
The exploit that earned the
Ken-L Ration award for Jet took

" place on Halloween. Sangster, who

is administrative assistant to
Tommy Harmon, the 1940 Heisman

Trophy winner and now a California

sports broadcaster, is a diabetic
and had slipped into a coma.

“I had left my front door ajar, so I
would be able to give the trick-and
treat youngsters some goodies
when they came to the house,”
said Sangster. “I passed out, falling
on the living-room floor.”

Jet apparently nuzzled the door
open sufficiently to get out, ran to a
gate in a 4-foot-high fence
separating the Sangsters’ property
from a next—door neighbor’s, Hazel

 

Candy-
Sangster
with Jet

Lavin, nuzzled Up the latch‘on the
gate and ran through to the Lavin's
house, where she began to bark
furiously.

Lavin, hearing the continuous
barking of the usually quiet Jet,
noticed the Sangsters’ car in the
driveway and, since it was dusk,
lights on in their house. So she
phoned them. When there was no
answer, she dialed 911 and
explained the situation.

Two paramedics arrived. Jet, still
barking, was running back and
forth between the two houses.
"She’s telling us something,” said

Lavin. “I think we should go to the

Sangsters."
When they did, they found

Sangster unconscious from severe

hypoglycemia. Lavin told the
paramedics her neighbor was a
diabetic, so they quiCkly
administered glucose and she
regained consciousness.

 

 

 

 

Her husband wasnin‘ Virginia,

'where he was judging three shows

over the weekend.

If not for Jet, the paramedics
said, Sangster would not have
survived.

“When I came to," she said, "I
heard one of the paramedics say,
‘This dog deserves a medal.’ Now
she has one. A friend gave us Jet
when she was just 8 weeks old.
She’s the best gift we’ve ever
received.”

This is the 34th year the Quaker
Oats Co. has sponsored the
competition and it is the first time a
Doberman has received the award.
Jet was chosen from more than
300 canines who performed heroic
and often life-saving deeds.

Dear Mrs. Yarbrough:

Thank you for letting me know of your concern about the recent
Japanese expedition to Antarctica in pursuit of 300 Minke whales.

I certainly appreciate and share your interest in guaranteeing
that whales, as well as all other types of marine mammals, are
properly protected. In the past, I have supported measures such as
the Marine Mammal Protection Act to achieve this goal.

The Japanese fishing industry had previously promised to end
commercial whaling this spring, and considering the world-wide
scrutiny of their actions, it is unlikely they will be able to evade
this deadline. Several legal actions are underway, and it is possible
that economic sanctions may be taken against Japan if the whaling
continues. While Congress has not yet been directly involved in this
recent controversy, I assure you that I will continue to monitor this
situation with your thoughts prominent in my mind.

I appreciate hearing from you on this important issue, and I hope
you will continue to write to me about those matters of importance to
you.

Sincere y

ARIZONA REPUBLIC - Phoenix - March 19, 1988

 

 

 

 

By G'ail Tabor
The Arizona Republic

nfair and anti-dog, canine lovers
l I claim. The “vicious dog” ordi—

nances that are sweeping the
country are knee-jerk reactions by
bureaucrats, are unrealistic and extreme,
they say.

The ordinances threaten the loving
relationship between a pet and its family.
dog advocates say, adding that such laws
are an attempt to legislate instinctive
behavior by labeling i “vicious.” And,
some critics say, the laws may even be
unconstitutional.

Not so, respond municipal officials,
anxious to avoid further incidents in
which children and adults are bitten or
mauled by dogs. The ordinances are not
onerous to responsible dog owners.
officials claim; they actually will protect
well-behaved dogs as well as citizens.

Nobody can ask the dogs what they
would prefer. If they could talk, they
might ask to be left alone to do what
comes naturally. And that, as we shali
see, may well be the canines’ undoing.

Mesa and Pima County have enacted
“vicious dog” ordinances. The Glendale
City Council will consider one similar to
Mesa’s, only much stricter, this month.

On Thursday, Prescott Valley decided
to delay action until further studying a
proposed “dangerous” dog ordinance.
Many experts say “dangerous” is the
key word in the debate.

“ ‘Dangerous’ is much easier to prove
than ‘vicious,' ” said Dale Dunning,
executive director of the Arizona llu—
mane Society. “Any dog can be
dangerous, as could any person.

“At any one moment, they could do
something that’s vicious.”

Sometimes, a dog will bite somebody.
yet when confronted by animal—control
officers or brought in front of a hearing
officer in court, will revert to its normal.
everyday behavior of wagging tail and
licking tongue, he said.

That image does not fit with society‘s
stereotype of “vicious” ~— a snarling dog
with bared fangs.

Carol Walker, an animal-control
officer in Prescott Valley, helped write

that community’s prOposed ordinance
and says it is court-tested and acceptable

to dog owners.

icious-dog’ laws are Spreading. But
some dog owners and animal-control
experts ask: Do these ordinances take

“It avoids naming any specific

1‘ breed,” she said. "It’s a good tool to
train responsxble dog owners. It’s putting
‘ more teeth in the leash law, and it spells

out exactly what your dog may or may

not do.”

Pat Ganser, a Maricopa Countv
animal-control ofﬁcer, says all these
ordinances eventually will resemble the
one proposed in Prescott \‘ailey.

“What’s ‘vicious’ to you and to me
can be two different things.” he said. “I
think (other communities) are going, to
have a tough time.”

In the middle of all this sits Hoss, a

1-year-old American Staffordshire ter-
rier (a k a pit bull) who in December
was declared “vicious” under Mesa’s
ordinance.

Hoss‘ owners, Richard and Diane
Anderson, say their dog has been
discriminated against and their family
has been treated unfairly.

It seems that Hess and his sidekick.
a mixed-breed dog, got bored in their
back yard and decided to stroll the
neighborhood. They burrowed under
the fence.

Upon reaching freedom, the two
spied a cat and immediately gave
chase. The cat climbed a tree, and the
dogs barked furiously.

For some strange reason, the cat
did not stay in the tree. Giving a great
leap, tabby hit the ground — a grave
error in judgment. Hoss outran it, and
that was the end of the cat.

Hoss’ mixed-breed companion, ac-
cording to the only eyewitness, did
not participate in the deed.

This is where members of the
Arizona Dog Council, a dog-advocacy
group, take issue with the procee -
ings. The eyewitness, a 12-year-old,
was not present when Mesa hearing
officer Andrea Andrews took testi-
mony.

“If they are going to rely on
hearsay, I can visualize neighbor
pitted against neighbor, accusing them
of all kinds of things just to vent a
grudge,” Dog Council member
Mildred Gleeson said.

Besides, added Chuck Cushnell.
president of the council and an

accredited American Kennel Club
judge, “To chase cats is instinct.”

“I also have three cats, and one of
them kills birds,” said Diane Ander-
son of Hoss’ family. “Shouldn’t it be
declared a ‘vicious cat’?”

That would be a possibility if there
were an ordinance confining cats to .
premises, putting them on leashes and
requiring registration, conceded hear-
ing officer Andrews. There is no such

ordinance; but there is one concerning
dogs, and she has to enforce it.

Gleeson raised an interesting point:

“Is a cat a domestic animal or a
wild animal?” she asked.

Cats do not have to be licensed,
registered or kept on leashes. so they
conceivably could be considered wild
animals. Had Hoss had gone out and
killed a coyote, a wild animal, he
would have been doing what comes
naturally, and nobody would have
given a whit. Gleeson said.

Andrews did some homework on
what city, county and state ordinances
say about wild vs. domestic animals.

“Unfortunately. the state (law) is
black-and-white,” she said. “And the
only issue is, ‘Did the dog kill the
cat?’ ”

The dog did.

As a result, Hoss languishes in his
recently constructed, escapeproof (and
very expensive) kennel. with the
required “Beware of Vicious Dog"
31in on the fence, while his owners

pay fines and endure probation.

Unlike Mesa‘s law. the Pima
County ordinance covers borh “dan-
gerous” dogs and “vicious or destruc-
tive”.animals. And it uses various
criteria to determine whether an
animal qualifies as dangerous.

Animal-control officers put the
animal in question through various
tests, on and off its home property
and in out of its owner’s presence.

Officers also videotape the animal‘s

behavior, in case the owner objects to -

court findings.

Since Dec. 9, when Pima County’s

ordinance was passed, 14 animals
have been investigated. said Jody
Burns of the county’s animal-control

 




department. Five (two chOWS, “”0 P" Ganser said cities need to gear their

‘ For example, the ordinance defines
:;a vicious dog as: “Any dog, except

The dog group wants the phrase
”domestic animal,” which includes
icats, "to be changed to “livestock,”
jlwhich does not include cats.

iafter the ordinance took effect, the
3 city received 91 complaints about

" vicious dogs. Animal-control ofﬁcers

rejected 75 of them "as having no basis.
“We’re seeing less of that because
police are screening cases better,”

. Andrews said. “Hearsay simply isn’t

going to do it. In my last case, we had

18 witnesses, all neighbors, against the
dog.”

‘ A major worry of the dog group
(Andrews is “really concerned” as
well) is the ordinance’s requirement
that owners of dogs “declared vicious
carry $100,000in liability insurance.

Because of the outcry, and the
possibility that such insurance can

cost $5,000 annually .(if it can be _

obtained at all), Andrews said t.here.is
a “stay” on that requirement pending
review by the City Council.

Andrews saysthe lack of an appeal
route concerning what is or is not a
vicious dog could cause trouble.

“There is some indication that the
Superior Court may (hear an appeal),
but there’s been no Statute. The City
Council provided appeal proceedings

. for the no-smoking ordinance, but not

this. Yes, I think there’s potential for

(legal action) to enter into it.”
Although Andrews had no input on

the ordinance herself, she gives high

marks to the Arizona Dog Council’s

efforts to make the law enforceable
and to Mesa for its willingness to-
listen.

“City Council is listening, at least,
and that’ss important,” she said.
“They’re willing to recognize there
may be problems with this law and
are willing to do what they can to
avoid it.” '

IMarch 28, 1988

Mr. Temple Reynolds
Director

Arizona Game & Fish Dept.
222 W. Greenway Road
Phoenix, AZ 85023

Dear Mr. Reynolds:

I think one of the worst things of civilization is that as children,
we all love animals — it seems to come naturally to us. I know it did
to me, and my good parents nurtured that feeling. 'We always had pet
dogs and cats, and I was taught to treat them in a humane manner.

Unfortunately, in too many cases, when a young boy shows love for ani—
mals, dad can't wait to shove a gun in his hand, and tell him how much
fun it is, and what a great thing it is to get out and commune with
nature, and kill a few animals.

As far as I am concerned — and fortunately, I am by no means alone in
my thinking - hunting will never be a sport, nor fun, nor a great way

to spend time in the woods. ‘It is nothing more than the murder of ani-
mals who are trying to live in their own areas But man again steps in
and prevents that by first, taking away the animal's natural habitat,
and then destroying the prey because man wants to do the killing, in-
stead of letting the natural predator do this.

I understand that Arizona has a really ridiculous license fee to kill
mountain lions; something like $1.50, when Colorado charges $25. It
is bad enough to kill these magnificent animals for sport, or for a
trophy, bUt to allow an average of 7,500 hunters roaming your state,

is really obscene. I wonder that you have any lions left in the state.
Further, I understand your lion tag permits the great hunter to kill
lions with kittens and even the kittens. iMy, how proud that must make
a male feel - how macho - to kill lion kittens.

Your so-called "stock killing laws" are ludicrous, but of course, since
your job depends on the hunter in your state to a great extent, I don't
really expect your Department to do anything about it. However, I hope
you will at least increase the lion tag fee, and discontinue the bounty
which allows the killing of this animal all year. Since this is the
case, why bother to buy a hunting tag?

Sincerely,

CMrs.) Constance F. Yarbrough
