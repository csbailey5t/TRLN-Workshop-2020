Dear Christine, j “ ' ‘
5Manyzthank3‘for your kind donation towards maintaining the
Painting Contest,for this current year. I am very,very grateful.It will help

a lot in covering essential expenses. I have just returned from a rather dif
ficult visit to Morocco. Feelings there,not of the best for British and Amer-
ican: However,I was fortunate in finding the right channels,and was apparentl
well accepted.(For What I was able to dol) The Ligue Marocaine pour la Defens.
of Animalsqggg grand peOple,domng a grand job,with Very few assets.Being Marc
caines,they4a lot of guidance! This I was able to give,and had the luck to be
able to meet the Ministre de I'Education Nationale,in his'glittering'offices
in Rabat,and get his full agreement to institute,and establish Humane Educat—
ion in all Maroc schools as from'the beginning of the new term. Also,the Mayo
of Casablanca agreed to start humane education among the people in the Souks,
etc. This is all so urgently required. Meantime,l have come back to try and
raise funds for a Shelter/Hospital for the Ligue,to try and save so many of
the appallingly ill-treated beasts of burden,i.e.Horses, Mules,Donkeys,etc.

I felt quite heartbroken at the pitiable sights,and spent most of the time
touring,on foot, the souks and other such places,trying to show the peOpleihow
their animals,(their means of livlihood)shoid be treated. This was no easy .
job,considering the language spoken is Arablcl still,my poor French,and actual‘
demonstrations,met with good response.Crowds followed me everywhere,and not at
all hostile: so it goes to prove,that even the most ignorant folk can be tau-
ght. I went 'armed' with excerpts from the Koran,distinctly laying down the

 




law for the care of animals: I feel some good has been done,and it's all
a step in the right direction. Ligue Marocaine is happy to co—Operate with
HEIA,unfortunately,they too,are in a financially poor state: and all voluntar.
workers._ One thing_really had me_livid - that_of the Municipal cars picking
up,every day between 5 pim}x& 5.30 p.m.,a11 dogs and cats,Seen on the streets.
and,WAIT FOR IT - taking these'rpOOr-Creatures to the Pasteur experimental
place: Certain members of the Ligue,go out daily,before 4 p.m.,and collect as
many dogs and cats as they oan5to save themt one marvellous woman has over
50 cats,and l9 dogs,in her flat: 4 floors up: I was appalled. Such a situatio
will become quite impossible, _ The Mayor of Casablanca has promised his
full suppert for the Painting Contest as regards having the premier exhibitio
and judging in Morocco - that means a fine'venue for the exhibition - there
are some lovely public buildings in Maroc-- left by the French,of:courseix

Do hepe you are satisfied with the progress of the Laboratory Animal

THANKS *

We thank you most gratefully for the
splendid help given during the past year
to our humane activities in Africa .

Through your generosity - many, many
animals have been saved from distress and
destruction -- many others, especially wild
life, have been given adequate protection.

Over 500 unfortunate, almost blind
African people , mostly young , have been
provided with spectacles after eye operations
-- thus giving them aid to see again, and once
more, become useful citizens, and children
enabled to go to school for the first time.

Our educational programme has been
greatly extended, and the organisation of
the annual Painting Contest for All Africa
Schools (Subject: Humane Actions) has been
more successful than ever before. In
connection with the Contest, Sponsors would
be warmly welcomed. The costs of the
Contest have increased enormously with the
expansion of its popularity.

The foregoing are only a few of our
activities , made possible through your
goodness.

INFORMATION

We would like to draw your kind
attention to some administrative changes
concerning the Institute. Due to
unavoidable circumstances, it has
become necessary to consider the
establishment of a new working base,
elsewhere in Africa. In this connection
we have found helpful co-operation
from our friends and associates in
Morocco. It is possible that much of
our work in future will be directed from
there.

For the time being our office in
Dar es Salaam is being kept open for
the reception of mail.

The Institute's funds are now
banked in London, and donations can
be made payable to the account of:

HUMANB EDUCATION INSTITUTE OF
' AFRICA,

THE STANDARD BANK LTD. ,

117, PARK LANE,

LONDON , W . 1 .

The Director, Mrs. Isobel Slater,
M.B.E. , may also be contacted direct
c/o the foregoing Bank address .

As always , the aim of the Institute's
activities -
"COMPASSION FOR ALL
LIVING CREATURES"

 




The continued interest and generosity of our
Friends and Supporters will ensure the promotion
of humane thinking and action among st the young
people of Africa , and particularly through the.
annual Painting contest exhibitions in overseas
countries, the "Message of Kindness” can be
projected over a Wide horizon

Thank you .

Dear Mrs. Stevens:

Please forgive me for the long gap in our
communication. Much has intervened both in Washington
and here in Tanzania that affects Peace Corps Tanzania
since our lovely breakfast in your home,and in the
course of these events I misplaced your address. It
has taken me until today to secure it from Washington.

Unfortunately, I have also received in the mail
today a letter from Mrs. Slater, who is now in San Remo,
Italy, stating that the responses to her letter to the
various Peace Corps Directors in Africa has been dis-
appointing. She states that she has heard only from
the Directors in Togo and Kenya. I am sure that there
are Volunteers in each country interested in working
with an art project of this type, but I suspect it is
very difficult for any individual Peace Corps Director
to pinpoint the proper persons.

Enclosed is a copy of the letter that was sent to
each Director. ' ,

Thank you again for the fine breakfast at your
home. I very much enjoyed meeting you and your mother.

Kindest regards.

Dear Christine , 19th December 1966.

v ’ Many thanks for your letter of 12th Dec. It is really most
kind of you to spare the time in trying to effect some plan to ensure the
successful continuity of the Painting Contest. I'm glad indeed that you
have had a meeting with Paul Sack. I am very interested in your discussion-
re.the Peace Corps people taking a hand in the running of the Contest,and
I think it could work out when we have developed a contrete plan for the
Operation. The Peace Corps do not work in all 'our' countries,but still,it
might be arranged that they would accept the entries from the remaining
, ones. But what would be the position if the P.C. had to leave any country
in our coverage?i.e. Guinea,earlier this yearf You know politics make a
lot of good things a bit uncertain: HEIA is well—known in 16 of the coungg'
where the P.C. is working,and of course,HEIA is known in the other 10—15
places where there is no P.C. I think initially I would have to write at
length to all our Ministries of Education concerned,to ensure their cont-
inued support of the Contest,and to.be certain that the Contest entries con
tinue to express the lessons learned through HEIA. What would you suggest
to be a good working plan? Should we have the P.C. take over the whole or—
ganisation of the Contest, or should I still do the essential organisation, '
etc? Here,we come to the thorny question of costs: as you rightly say,the )
lOOO Dollars would be well spent - don't I know it.But who will provide the I
necessary security? Evidently Mass,S.P.C.A. is out. David Claflin wrote me‘,
a brief letter, and three lines answered my request for the financial aid ﬂm)
the Contest: no funds. Very disappointing. ISPA would be the ideal source,,
but again,they boggle at costs: You know I had a long discussion with them f

I

JZY 41%09

 

in London earlier this year, and although they wanted to enter into the
Humane Education programme in Africa, they stuck at,to me,unessential-costs '
of offices,staff,etci they could'nt undertake it: However,to sponsor pnly, ;
the Painting Contest for its valuable contribution to humane care of animalsé
might be viewed favourably. Would you put it to them,Christine? in the fir§§
instance. It would come well from you. Paul Sack told me that the Peace C. ;
organisation could'nt supply funds, but would there not be some other dept.,f
who manages the Peace Corps,be willing to help? Goodness knows,but it's ‘
little enough money to ensure so valuable an asset,compared with the mill— ,
ions of dollars going on much less valuable projects. Don't I know,only tool
well,the misuse of a lot of useful cash: After all, it's not to be surpris-gj
ing - one has to live in Africa a lifetime,to know what is really wanted.

As things are, I can carry through the Contest on HEIA funds for a year,but
that is not satisfactory - especially,when I am in a bit of a spot person- a
ally,and won't be able to dip into personal resources when emergency would ‘
arise,as in the old days. I have got to change my whole way of life,and lean
to make do,on little! But that's beside the point. If only dear Eric H.had
not passed out on me,I'm pretty sure everything would have worked out well,

  

: and I could have made 8 HQ in Morocco. Morocco needs humane education now.




  
     
    

 
       
 
     
     
       
    
   
   
  

more,I think,§gkany other countr%ﬁ¥% Africa, Yes, the Fondouk is it Fez,
but they are SO overworked there 1 all the clinicial work,that I don't
think the Contest entries could be handled there - there is a much better
plan,if funds were forthcoming, to have theentries handled by the ‘Ligue
Morecain for the Protection of animals',with which HEIA is associated, at
Casablanca. If I find it possible a little later on, I mean to go there,
and work from there. However,at the moment,we must make a plan for the
carrying on of the Humane Painting Contest. I have already notified all
our followers in Africa,that I was going on long leave,(the usual thing in
Africal) and new plans were-under discussion as regards future Painting Con—
tests ~ so that gives us time,to get something into operation. If there can;-
be a Contest in 1967 -it takes many months to circulate notices,etc.,then

we could be ready for the beginning of 1968. I‘ve already had 1965 and 1966
together this year,due to my being away in 1965. So to miss one year would'n
be so bad,although GHANA is all ready to send in their entriesl' I think I
mentioned that I have to keep on the mailing system here,after I leave,and

a part-time help will keep in contact with me. It just was not possible to
'close down'comphetely the well—known address here,without first giving full
notification of a new established office elsewhere. You can understand this
I'm sure. When Mr Sack returns,I'll probably see him,and get his views re.
the P.C. and the collection of the entries.' I'm sure it could work, but wit

  

            
         
     
    
     
 

the cash security. I'll write again,later, but I'll be most grateful if
you can approach the ISPA in London. [Happy and peaceful Christmas.

Dear Christine,
A few lines in haste,as usual! I have never had any

acknowledgement from David Claflin,far less favourable response, so I'm
somewhat disappointed. So much depends on the successful continuity of
the Painting contest on having the financial side taken care of. If
Mass.S.P.C.A. does'nt play,I'll have to explore new channels for the
backing of the contest,and I'm afraid for the moment I'll have to leave
it to chance. We are going to be in a bit of a difficulty,my husband
and I,as regards finances due to the problem of getting money out of
here,at least for the time being - that means,I cannot with any assur-
ance depend on personal financial backing for the contest! so until
things become more clear,I will have to go slowly. It's all a headache
meantime,the routine work goes on,and when I leave in January,I will
have to leave some part—time help to take care of things and keep this
address. It has proved quite impossible to suddenly call 'halt' - too
many countries are involved,and it would be foolish to make any offic—
ial notification of changes without being able to give a definite plan
as regards the changes. My idea is to carry on the work as usual,from
wherever I may have to reside,in conjunction with the assistant I'll
leave here. Sad though it be,I just cannot see any other organisation
taking over the work - they all say,"too much to do": yet,I‘ve done it,
practically single—handed,and successfully. One salary paid to these
"Executives",would support the Painting contest easily,for at least two

years or more: The Peace Corps people have now said,th%9would take on
the collection of the Painting entries in the countries where they are
stationed,but of course,could'nt undertake the financial side. So that
takes us back to ensured backing for the contest. See if you could
sound Cloflin in a discret way? All for the moment - I'm really

25th June 1966.
Dear Christine,

Many thanks for your letter,just received. How right you are
about the AHA: 1 never did have any use for them,having discovered long
ago that there was an awful lot of'empty propaganda' emanating from that
source. However,it seemed to me,with something of a problem for the mom-
ent,that they were about the only pinup people handling a so-called Inter-
national painting contest - but there again,it seems mainly to bring some
publicity to themselves: This is confirmed by a letter I have Just received
in answer to my query as to whether they could take over the African con—
test. The reply is not satisfactory by any means,and a bit evasive: they
might consider it,if,it seems,there would not be a lot of extra work en -
tailed,etc., etc.,’5They talk of the staff required to handle extra work:
My goodness,Christine, I do get fed up with all these rich organisations
bleating about the staff they need: here,I am,bashing along,with all Africa
or most of it,on my plate,with only occasional part-time 'cheap'labour, and
with very little financial aid: Not that I think of complaining: it's my
own pleasure,but for the time being with all the changing circumstances,l
feel a bit baffled as to how to keep things going. And until my husband,
when he leaves Govt.,at the end of the year, finds suitable re-settlement
somewhere overseas, I don't feel in a position to commit myself to volunt—
ary work of this nature,indefinitely. I'm sure something will emerge,but
the future is a little hazy for the present. No, I could'nt work with ,
SPANA ~ they too,are haphazard: and are not really doing the job in N.A¥u4&
at all. They treat their staff there,very badly, and have lost some excel~
lent people —-in fact,two of their men assistants have contacted me,to spe
if I could employ them.Good men too. I would have Jumped at the chance 0

having such expert help,had I been in a better financial position to do so.
I.Africa is crying out now,for Humane Education.I‘ve been fortunate in bre-
aking through there,with the painting contest. If only the MSPCA could see
the position in the way that E.H. realised it, all could yet,be fine.

I'm thinking of writing to Senator Robert Kennedy - he's just been
here,briefly, but in all his speeches he has been urging the fact that the
USA must do more for Africai especially in the field of Education. And if
all his worthy sentiments are correct,and true,then he should be inclined
to consider Humane Education. What do you think? I'm fully convinced that
Humane Education is the real and solid foundation for trying to build a bet
ter world - the people must learn the true fact about humanity,and this in-
cludes understanding of the needs of all living creatures. In Africa,our
teaching is keenly welcomed - the only trouble being,the politicians: and
with all the difficulties they create,it is being more and more difficulty
to keep firm contacts with so many changes in Governmentsﬁ I feel it might
be now easier working outside Africa ~ for the reason that working within
encounters many obstructions and restrictions,i.e. no free access to cer~
tain countries,and mysterious mishandling of mail,etc£ so much is suspect.
I have had to discontinue the connections in Bhodesia,and beyond - this is
quite absurd. and one is never very sure when objection will be taken to
contact with other places. I will not commit myself to AHA in any
way, but will wait a bit longer to see whether some better solution will
present itself. It is the Painting Contest which worries me mostly - I can
always carry on sending the literature and lectures,etc., from anywhere2
but the Contest is highly valuable,and must somehow be maintained. I‘m in
the thnnes of the 1966 one,now: Again,grateful thanks. Yours,

”FTC. 3W!

28th May 1966.

I was indeed happy to get your letter of 16th May. I
have'nt written for some time,knowing well,that you have plenty on your
fork: I profoundly h0pe that all goes well with your hard battle for
humanity in the Lab.

I'm writing this note now,to ask if you would be a
dear and write to the AHA peOple in Denver - I have just written to them-
adding your weight to mine,yours,probably much heavier: Reason: I am in
a real jam about etting some well~established overseas organisation,pre-
ferably American, America being very pOpular in Africa,at presentl) to
take over our wonderful ALL-AFRICA SCHOOLS PAINTING CONTEST. The AHA seems
equipped to deal with painting contests,with their International one, and
few other overseas organisations seem able to cope with Humane Education
in Pictures: They have shown a lot of interest in our annual painting
contest, so I thought this might be one side of our work which could be
easily taken over. I can cope with the 1966 Contest, but after that....?x
It's not going to be easy to get any organisation to take over all the
work of HEIA,and maintain it on the successful lines established. ISPA
was scared at the coverage,when I discussed a plan with them in London re-
cently, so would'nt comit themselves to taking over all: but they would
help in some way,I think.

JZV'ézmﬂf

 

My dear Christine,

You know,Christine, I have been a bit worried for a
long time now, about the future of HEIA,when circumstances,unavoidable,as
regards my own domestic and financial affairs, should come to a head -
after living in so settled a way in Africa for some 30 years, one does’nt
really realise that so pleasant a way of life must change in some waylwell,
I have to face it now. Before the end of l966,a move will have to be made.
I can carry on much of the work from overseas, being so well~ known as I
am - for my sins: but some things require a permanent headquarters,such
as for the Painting Contest — and the painting contest is something so
valuable in promoting and encouraging humane thought and action,among the
younger generation in Africa, off—setting as it does,so much misery from
the political upsets, that it is imperative that the Contest goes on with—
out a break. For America to come into Africa in this Humane Field,would
be good for all,concerned. Boston just does'nt seem interested any more.
Alas, for the passing of Eric Hansen. I cannot get any response at all
from Boston,which,on the face of it, is most surprising.

I thought,if you would write to AHA,eXplaining all
this,and lauding them for their International painting effort, you might
be able to encourage them to consider the prOposition seriously. It would

be a bi $000 for them to et the advantage of takin .over so well-estab~
lished i humage asset. , g Could you do this,Chris%1ne? I would be so y

 




1
very, very grateful. I just can't think at present,what will happen to
us? I‘ m resigning myself to the fact, that I'll probably have to go on a

"pay- ~roll" somewhere, until the position gets a bit more settled down,that
is, whilst my husband finds a suitable Opening,elsewhere, but after so long
in Africa, it's not going to be that easy. HoWever, we haVe some months in
hand, and lots can happen. But HEIA must go on somehow ,somewhere,for the sake

of the animals.
All for the moment, but do what you can about AHA and

the ALL-AFRICA SCHOOLS PAINTING CONTEST - that would be a huge load of my

mind'
All the best to your endeavours.

Yours, ngéﬂpmlz.,i-

ﬁear Christine,

. nany thanks for your letter,yesterday. This is to let you knot
that I've just written to Russell Train,enclosing two most appealing photos
of a little homeless lion cub,brought in here,the other day, and which caused
me to make a frantic protest to the Minister for WildLife,etc., for allowing
the poor little creature to be turned Rose in the bush,because there was no
place to keep it,in Dar: I was furious. A cub cannot kill,and fed itself. All
this,for want of a sanctuary,or orphanage,in Dar area. The usual snag,‘no
money'!‘ I've asked Russell Train whether he could help with funds for a
small sanctuary. Often,lost or orphaned wild creatures are found in this area
and a sanctuary would be a great asset from many aspects. There's poor Hugo
also needing some sanctuary, and going in daily fear of a bullet. Alasl

Now,to more sad news. You will,I expect have read of the lat~
est upheaval in this politicalepower—ridden continent? I'm heartbroken - my
lovely Nigeria, and our dear friend Balewa. It's all ghastly - sp unexpected.
Our work in that country was going on so well — in fact,I think Nigeria will
be top in our painting contest judging,to take place on the 15th Feb. This is
a blow. Following on Dahomey recently, not to mention the other unhappy parts
of A. I cannot write in detail - letters are often opened ~ Yours,of yes-
terday had been opened,and stuck with tape: I'm coming to the definite con

aclusion thatﬁﬁg hEIA will have to be conducted from outside Africa - I cannot
honestly think of any one place at the moment,where Tt_would be good to set u
a H.Q. everywhere there is a smouldering of one kind or another. In View Of
this latest tragedy,I just can't think clearly. But this,I do know, BETA must
continue to help the animals in Africa, either outside Africa,or within.
Added to this, my husband has sprung something of an ultimatum — he,1t seems
has ﬁad his'fill'. Now, unless I have a home somewhere,and an income,it
would be pretty difficult to carry on independentlygin any place, so,1t may
be that I'll be forced to tag along,perhaps to U.K._ How changed can things
become in a few years - incredible. Then I started HEIA,I had no thought of
changes in living conditions,through”independences of countries",or anthing
else ~ living so long in Africa,one just took things for grantedz' The next
few months will decide the best thing to do. I have my pets to think of also
and wish I could go to a country without those cruel quarantine regulations.
Had Dr Hansen's plans materialised,horocco would have been the best bet - it
being so near Europe. I have written to Mr Potter ~ no dice: hiss Carlsen,
and Lavigne, have‘nt replied: I guess they are still unsettled. I Will
write to Mr Nacfarlane,and he Eaiﬁx Claflin, presently. I'll also see if
John Hall,RSPCA,London, has any ideas. Yes, indeed $ierra.Leone,I love,
'but again, my old friend there,died,and the new regime is a bit different.
It's the same everywhere in A. As it seems to me,now, HEIA could well be
carried on from overseas somewhere — as you know,I cannot visit the differ~
ent countries very much — too expensive ~ and our work is really carried on
through the mail, and very well too - the only snag being, the heavy pospgge
and the gargatuan amount of writing: But a.permanent address is essen ,

and the annual painting contest,invaluable to our work, must go on.

 




I'm all set for the Exhibition and judging of our 1965 pictures, on Feb.l5th

if nothing unforeseen turns up to interferel Ifll write you again soon 4,~«

this is really to tell you that.l'd written to Russell Train, and I‘m not sure

rif I had the correct address? I addressed to: 601,Nat10nal Press Building,
Washington,D.C. African Wildlife Leadership Eoundation. ﬁeuld that be oorrect~

For the moment, my love,and good wishes.

Yours,
I enjoyed the litzabout the regent award of

the eexremx Schweitzer ewe. I shoulq’iwthink‘a
very able man received the award for lBeE,

_ CONTRASTING sadly, with the

splendid page of pictures from

Saa N ane Sanctuary which appea-

red in your issue» of December

14, was the letter in your issue
i of the very next day. Not by any
! means a kind letter,but one which
could provoke another outburst
of ill-feeling against that poor,
much- maligned hippo named
“Hugo”.

Of course creps have to be
protected; this point doesn’t re»
quire emphasis. What does not
seem to be understood is the fact
that all the world over owners
”of large, rich and highly cul-
' tivated farming lands have accep-

 

 

 

 

 

 

{ humane- mindedness,

ted without question their respon—
sibility for protecting their lands
and crops from nature’s marau-
ders. It has never been the
general habit of demanding the
death penalty for every bird and
beast found on farming lands
overseas. Such aprocedure would
be calamitous.

Wild creatures have their
rightful place in the worldtoo and
have a purpose to fulfil, a fact
which should not be forgotten.
Further, it is Man’s simple duty
to care for and protect these
humbler children of God’s crea-
tion, and Hugo is definitely one
of these. This particular hippo

was obviously destined to make

the , pleasantsurroundings

 

wise he wouldnitbethereiivstran‘ge, :
as it may seem Hugo prefers his
own co mpany and that of the Kura~
sini residents and their dogs to

seeking out others of his own kind. ‘
It is believed that many hippos ‘

may be found farther along the
creek and on the coast -- unless

of course they have all ruthlessly
4 been killed off. " 1

If such a splendid project as i
the Saa Nane Sanctuary in the ‘

Lake Region could be established
and enjoyed by the people in that
area surely some such scheme
could be started in the Kurasini
area -—- an ideal place ~-—- and
thus solve the problem of Hugo
and any other hippo which might
appear. All Hugo needs is a lit.-
tle bit of shamba of his own; he
must go ashore sometimes. It
should not be very difficult to in-
troduCe some other animals to
the area, preferably orphans,
and with adequate fencingasanc-
tuary could very quickly be esta-
blished. '

I feel sure there are many

humane- minded residents in Dar
es Salaam and beyond who would
be only too happy to help save the
country’ 5 wild life by contributing
towards such a project. At the
same time assisting in the
promotion of national enterprise
well in keeping with Tanzania’s
and the

i, progressive spirit of providing
‘3 its people with educational and

pleasure-giving amenities.

Whatever happens, Hugo must
be allowed to live, free from fear,

 

Kuras ini creek his habitatmtheﬁgm .

it. ‘ _

: COMPETITORS ARE ADVICE!) TO READ THE HUMANE EDUCATION
. LITERATURE ISSUED FREE, BY THE INsmerE L . .

N.B. Competitors are reminded that there are no tigers, polar bears or kangaroos in
- Africa! entries should not depict these animals—only African. animals, and
scenes, are acceptable. Also, competitors should remember that it is not. humane
(kind) to keep wild birds in cages, dogs on heavy chains, nOr should capapults
be used to kill or injure birds, or other small animals and pietures of ‘ﬁghting

. scenes’ are not encouraged, cruel pictures are not humane. '

Another hint to competitors! scenes showing nurses working in hospitals,
although humane, is professional routine Work, and not‘an idea for showing
acts of kindness. Also too, ﬁremen ﬁghting a ﬁre—that is their everyday
work. But a person rushing into a burning house or farm building, to try
and eﬂect a rescue, is indeed a very brave, and humane act.

CompetitOrs are advised to give plenty of thought to the idea for their
. entries—there are a great many kind acts which ordinary people can
perform daily. '

THE COMPETITION IS OPEN TO SCHOOLS ANYWHERE IN AFRICA.
SPECIAL NOTE TO COMPETITORS:-w

There is no fee for entering the competition, but competitors are asked to send
with their entries, a packet of USED POSTAGE STAMPS of their own country—these
will be sold by the Institute to helpdefray the costs of returning the entriesafter the
competition is over. Intending competitors should start collecting used stamps in good
time.

NOTEZ BIEN

 

2 prix spéciaux ont été ajoutés pour la Section B'pour l’entréeexpri-
Inant 1e mieux l’affectio‘n et la bonté témoig‘nées a un chien, se souve-
' nant que le chien est connu'pour étre “le meilleur ami de l’Homme” et

AVIS
ON CONSE.ILLE AUX COMPETITEURS DE LIREMAU PREA-
VANT LA LITERATURE SUR L’EDUCATION’ HUMAIN
EMISE GRATUITEMENT PAR L‘INSTITUT.

IF CONCOURS ES}; OUVERT A TOUTES LES ECOLES
AFRICAINES

NOT EZ BEEN Les compe'titeurs sont rappéles qu’il n’y a mi tigres, ni ours, ni renne, ni

Kangourou en Afrique! Les entrees montrant seulement des scenes at
des animaux d’Afrique, sont acceptables. Aussi, que ce n’est pas
humain de garder des oiseaux sauvages dans des cages, des chiens
attaches a dc grosses chaines, ou d’user dc lance-pierre pour tuer on.
blesser des oiseaux, ou de petits animaux, les dessins representant des
scenes de combat et de tueries ne sont pas encourages, des images
represéntant 1a crauauté ne sont pas humanitaire.

Encore un. mot avis !~-«—Les scenes qui représentent des nurse qui
travaillent dans un hospital, n’est que routine professionelle, est pas
une ide’e trés originale montrant un. act. de bonté. Ainsi qu’un pompier
qui bat des ﬂammeswc’est son travail de tout les jours. Mais une
personne qui s’élance dans une maison ou ferme qui brule, pour
essayer d’accompli un sauvetage, est vraiment une personne brave et
humaine.

Les competiteurs sont priés de bien réﬂechir aux idées pour leurs
entrées-—il y a beaucoup d’ACTES DE BONTE que l’on peut exécuter
quotidienement.

EDUCATION IN ANIMAL WELFARE

A SERIES OF 12 EASY LESSONS
FOR USE IN . AFRICA

By
Kimetungwa na
ISOBEL SLATER

 




INTRODUCTION

Education in animal welfare is essential for the following reasons, ﬁrstly from
the humanitarian aspect. The awakening and fostering of the sense of justice and
sympathy developed through the educative process, guides the imagination towards
respect for the lowest animals so that they may occupy their rightful place in our
domestic lives. In this, it is the heart that can triumph over intellect.

Secondly, we have the economic side to consider. To the poor man the welfare
of his animals means the welfare of his home and family.

It seems rather useless trying to educate the rural masses in Africa unless at
the same time they are taught how to look after their animals. To millions of villagers,
their animals mean their wealth, and the whole point of modern education, although
admirably directed to raising the standard of living, will be completely lost unless the
peOple are educated in the matter of animal welfare also.

The whole standard of the villagers can be raised through education in animal
welfare. Most Africans have a love for their animals but failure to reason about them
is at the root of the cruel and neglectful conditions seen in so many thousands of cases.
Animals with sores and verminous, kept in dirty and evil-smelling places, give ample
evidence of this. The lives of these animals and their usefulness are shortened through
such ignorant neglect, and their money—earning capacity reduced considerably.

9

Often these animals are the “ breadwinners ’ of a family, and on their well-
being depends the whole domestic economy of their owners. If animals sicken and
die through lack of care and knowledge as to their needs, many owners can be left
destitute. Marked evidence of this can be seen in times of drought. So people in
their ignorance kill the source of their livelihood.

Let education, without delay, be directed towards raising the standard of the
rural masses by initiating and implementing an extensive programme of animal welfare
instruction. The Schools can do much to build up the right attitude of the rural
people towards animals. The children must be trained to a sense of responsibility
where animals are concerned. A great moral can be learned through kindness to
animals, and it may be truly said that people who arekind to dumb animals will be
kind and considerate to one another. Any person who can slash an animal with a
panga or other weapon, or injure it with a spear or arrow in a ﬁt of rage or vengeance,
might as easily turn on his fellow men in the same cowardly way.

The education of the people in the matter of animal welfare might well form
the basis on which the whole structure of a rural community could be raised to a much
higher standard of living. '

Lesson 1.
FRIENDS AND SERVANTS

There are four reasons why we should treat our animals with
kindness:

1. They are our friends and servants.

2. They serve us well and demand nothing in return; if they
could speak, all they ask would be food, water, and a clean,
safe and sheltered place to sleep.

3. They provide us with food and milk, also clothing from
their skins.

4. When we sell them in good condition, more money is ob-
tained for the upkeep of our homes and families.

For these reasons we should ensure their well-being by taking the

greatest care of them. See that they always have enough to eat and

' plenty of fresh, clean water to drink. See that they have proper

~ housing and protection, especially at night when wild animals are on

the prowl for food, and unscrupulous persons might steal or injure
them.

We must always protect our domestic animals in times of danger,
or when they are in need of our help. Animals can suffer greatly
when catastrophe occurs, such as the distress Caused through ﬁre, .
storm or ﬂood. Drought also can be looked upon as a time of great
distress. Animals are very often forgotten during such hard times
when all help is directed towards saving human lives. But the animals
should not be forgotten. Let us try and remember that they are part
of our domestic life and they deserve our help and protection at all
times.

Animals are easily terriﬁed by noise and commotion and un-

' usual happenings, far more so than human beings, who can feel

secure in the knowledge that help will come to them. The animals

have not this comfort; always they fear that they will be abandoned
and left to suffer from unknown terrors.

LET US TRY TO MAKE OUR ANIMALS FEEL THAT WE ARE

THEIR FRIENDS AND WILL NOT FORSAKE THEM NOR
LEAVE THEM TO SUFF ER

Lesson 2.
THINGS WE SHOULD NOT DO

Do not beat or injure animals-this is cruelty.

Do not forget to give our animals food and water daily.

Ensure that their needs in this simple way are satisﬁed.

Do not neglect them when they are sick or injured. Treat them
carefully at home, or better still try and get some skilled veteri-
nary aid for them.

(Some simple ﬁrst aid hints are given in Lesson 12).

Do not overload donkeys, nor work them when they are sick
or suffering from sores.

Do not tie up any animal to a tree or other support, with a short
piece of rope or wire, for long hours.

Do not leave animals tied up under the hot sun or in the pouring
rain. Give them shelter at all times.

Do not leave animals outside at night without proper protection.
Wild animals roam at night looking for food. Often a do-
mestic animal can be seriously injured, if not killed outright.
This means a great loss to the owner.

Do not omit to build a good strong boma or shelter for your
animals.

Do not hurry animals on safari let them take their time, especially
cattle, goats and sheep. .

. Do not hobble animals tightly.

. Do not take calves away from their mothers until they are old

enough to feed themselves.

. Do not hurt or frighten animals about to be slaughtered.

. Do not slaughter pregnant animals.

. Do not abandon any animal, particularly a dog Or a eat. If you

no longer want to keep your dog or cat, try to ﬁnd some kind

person to take it and give it a good home.

. Do not beat or torture a dog or a cat in any way just because

it may have stolen food. If animals are well fed and kindly

treated, they will not steal. .

. Do not trap nor cage wild birds, this is very cruel. It is their

right to be free.

. Do not use catapults. These cruel instruments can cause great

suffering and agony from 1njury. Also do not shoot birds with

air guns for sport.

. Do not pack fowls into small baskets, nor again carry them up-

side down, nor by their wings.

. Do not take fowls on long safaris unless they are in good, airy

crates with enough food and water for the journey.

. Do not leave crates of fowls lying in the hot sun. Put some

leaves on top to give them protection.

. Do not keep cattle in dirty bomas, especially in the rainy season.

. Do not forget to milk cows at regular periods daily.

. Do not set steel traps for wild animals. These traps can wound '
them cruelly, and wild animals have a right to their freedom, free
from cruelty and suffering.

.Do not try to kill animals by cruel methods which cause them to
suffer pain.

.Finally, do not treat any animal or bird in any way in which
you would not like to be treated yourself. Animals and birds
feel pain andsulfering just as do human beings, and whereas
human beings can speak out and help themselves, the animals .
cannot do so, therefore it is our moral duty to help them.

HUMANE EDUCATION thTiTUTE
or warm...

Lesson I2
GENERAL PRINCIPLES TO REMEMBER

Be merciful to our beasts. Do unto them as you would have
them do unto you. Treat all domestic animals well, as we would
like to be treated if we were in their place. Many of them work for
us and bring us money for our homes and families, therefore we
feed them well and water them daily. We give them good shelter
from the sun and rain and protection from danger.

Kindness and consideratiOn to animals helps to make human
beings kind to each other, and those of us who feel kindness for all
living creatures, whether man or beast, can do a great deal to show
the way towards a good way of living to those who have not yet
learned the secret of happiness and contentment through kindness
to animals and their fellow men.

SIMPLE FIRST AID

In areas where it is not possible to obtain skilled veterinary
treatment for animals, the following advice should prove helpful:

1. Find out where some person lives who is naturally gifted
in helping sick or injured animals so that the help of such
a person can be obtained as quickly as possible. In this
way the life of an animal may be saved, or at least, suffering
arrested until more skilled help can be obtained.

Burns and scalds: Put the animal under restraint and apply
strong cold tea, and obtain expert advice at once.

Stings: If possible pinch up the affected part between the
ﬁnger and thumb for a few minutes, then apply vinegar to
the part. Adrenalin is also good to give : 3-4 drops for
a dog or cat. This drug is obtainable from all chemists and
is particularly good in cases of shock or collapse. It may
also be given for snakebite, but skilled veterinary aid should
be obtained as quickly as possible.

56

 




Wounds: These should always be thoroughly cleaned in
the ﬁrst place by gently washing with hot or cold water,
afterwards, applying an antiseptic such as Dettol. Failing
this, use a solution of warm water and salt.

Wounds, whether large or small, should NEVER BE
NEGLECTED.

Ears: Watch the ears of your dog or cat carefully, this
helps to avoid canker. Ears should be cleaned now and
again With a little oil.

Choking: This can be very serious and skilled assistance
should be obtained as quickly as possible. Small objects
can be removed from the mouth, throat, or upper parts of
the gullet by means of forceps 'or some butter.

Sickness in Fowls: A little butter can sometimes prove
helpful when chickens appear to be choking. Some bread
soaked in warm milk is good for fowls when they seem to
be sick and off their food.

Accidents: Remember, animals in pain and frightened, are
almost certain to bite and resent being handled. A coat,
rug or sack should be thrown over the animal so that it
can be carried to a safe place for attention. Dogs should
be muzzled by a tape or cord tied round the jaws, and cats
handled by a helper wearing gloves. Injured animals
should be kept as quiet as possible until expert help is
obtained.

Broken limbs: No animal should be made to walk about
with a broken limb. Keep the animal quietly in one place
and bandage the limb with splints to keep it ﬁrm until
expert help is obtained as quickly as possible. In many
cases broken limbs can be mended if given the proper atten-
tion in time, but if a broken limb is neglected, it may not
mend, and in such cases it may mean the loss of a valuable
animal.

, It is a good plan for animal owners to keep the following
ﬁrst-aid remedies always handy:

58

 




Dettol, Acriﬂavine Emulsion (for sores, burns and wounds)
Liquid Parafﬁn, Castor Oil, Boracic Powder, Boracic
Ointment, Epsom Salts, Common Salt, Kerol or Gammatox,
Olive Oil. Also some strips of bandage (americani or
calico is good material to cut up for bandages and is not
expensive). Some pieces of thin wood for splints. It
is useful also to have a forceps and a pair of scissors.

It would be an excellent plan for owners of many animals
living in one area to set aside a small hut or room, for use as a First
Aid station or hospital, and all co-operate to keep it supplied with
the necessary equipment, such as listed above.

A dip could be constructed there, and all small animals could
be brought regularly for dipping. There should also be a vessel full
of fresh drinking water always available.

A well-organised First Aid service in every village would be a
great asset for the welfare of animals.

 




Lesson 8.

OUR CAT

Much of what has been said about the care of dogs may be
said about cats. .

DO NOT KEEP A CAT UNLESS YOU ARE PREPARED
TO CARE FOR IT PROPERLY.

Cats can get various sicknesses like dogs, when neglected, and
even more so as there are usually so many more stray and. diseased
cats to be seen wandering about.

Many people seem to think that a cat does not need any attention
at all, and that it can ﬁnd food and look after itself. This is not so.
A cat needs proper daily feeding and fresh water to drink, just like
a dog or any other animal. A cat should also be brushed daily to
help keep it free from fleas and ticks, also from the loose hair which
it can swallow when licking itself; loose hair when swallowed can
cause sickness. A cat is a naturally clean animal and always tries
to keep clean through licking itself. -

Cats are useful for catching mice and rats, and some people
think that this is all the food they need. This is quite wrong, but if
a cat is hungry it will eat its kill and thus may get skin disease and.
other sickness. Cats require proper food daily i.e. porridge, (posho),
milk and ﬁsh, but not ﬁsh bones as these are not easily digested and
can pierce the entrails and cause death, the same also applies to dog.

Cats will eat grass when they feel sick; this is natural medicine
for dogs and cats, but if the sickness keeps on, the right sort of medi—
cine should be given without delay.

Cats should have their own clean and dry place to sleep, and.
should never be left outside at night. When a cat is kept indoors a
small box of sand should be kept in a corner for it to relieve itself.
‘ Female cats can have kittens several times ayear, one reason
why there are so many cats in the world! When the kittens are born,
it is kindness to take away immediately all but one or two of the male
kittens. The unwanted kittens should be quickly immersed in a
deep bucketof lukewarm water and kept under for an hour or more.
They feel nothing at all by putting them to sleep in this way, and it
is so much better than allowing them to grow up unwanted, hungry

44

 




and probably diseased. It would not be possible for the average
householder to feed large families of kittens adequately. ‘By dis-
posing of them at birth a kindness is being done. '

A thin, starved eat, like a thin, starved dog, is a pitiful sight and
is the sign of a cruel and neglectful owner.

Cats will catch and kill birds, especially when they are hungry.
This is a very bad practice and should be discouraged. The birds
in any case should not be destroyed as they are very useful to Man.

Feed your cat well, and you will have much pleasure from owning
him, and will keep him your friend. Dogs and cats are real friends
and companions in the home and a person’s character can be judged
by the condition of his domestic animals.

Kindness to animals in the home means a good moral up
bringing for the children. Let the children understand early in life
that they must look after the animals carefully and never raise a
stick, panga or other cruel instrument against them.

Children should be taught how to play with puppies and kittens
gently and in this way they will grow up with the proper sense of
understanding regarding the needs of our dumb friends, and at the
same time, this will help to teach them kindness to each other.

The kind owner makes sure that Mwenye paka aliye mwema hua-

‘ his cats are well fed and ngalia kwamba paka zake wana-

; comfortable lishwa sawasawa na kitunzwa
vema

 




Lesson 11

WILD ANIMALS

To those of us who live in a country like Africa, a country rich in
wild life, it is our duty to do all possible to protect these creatures of
the wilds. Wild animals have their own laws of nature, but it is not for
man to take it upon himself to cause injury and suffering to these
lovely care-free creatures. Here are some of the things we should
remember in trying to protect the wild animals:

Do not shoot them wantonly. Do not shoot if there is little
chance to kill outright. Do not set cruel traps, such as gin traps,
stacked pits, tree snares, etc., these are cruel and cause great suffer-
ing. Never shoot or try to capture a mother with young. This
is particularly cruel as the young of wild animals are most diﬂiCult
to rear; by shooting or destroying the mother, the young one
will most probably die.

When wild animals have to be killed, let us try to ensure that
they are killed quickly and humanely. If an animal is wounded
and escapes, see that it is followed up and killed, otherwise it may
prove a serious danger to unsuspecting travellers who may cross
its path. Wounded, animals become very savage through the agony
they suffer. A wild animal will attack through fear and pain.

Wild animals have a great fear of human beings as they seem
to associate us with pain and suffering. This is not good, for even
wild animals would respond to kindness if given a chance.

We all know that crops must be protected, but let us try to make
a plan for the provision 0f some humane means whereby we can get
rid of animals who would damage our crops. Shooting seems to be
the most humane way provided the marksman is sure and can shoot
to kill.

Let us try and protect our wonderful wild animals, and let us
remember that their only defence is attack against the human beings
who would injure them and cause them suffering.

54

 




Lesson. 5.

GOATS AND SHEEP

Goats

Goats are kept in large numbers in Africa and many owners
seem to imagine that these animals can live on any old scraps and
rubbish that can be picked up. This is not really so, although goats
do like to wander along roads and round about houses picking up
all sorts of odds and ends; they actually resort to this kind of feeding
when they are neglected by their owners. Strong, healthy goats
require good grazing like any other animal, and every owner should
ensure good and adequate grazing for them if he values them at all.
If an. owner does not value his goats he should not keep them.

Goats should be herded out to good grazing daily, and allowed
to graze for at least seven hours at a, time. Well-fed goats are healthy
and command good prices when sold for food. Also' she-goats
give rich and plentiful milk when properly fed; goat milk is very good
for babies.

Goats should have plenty of clean water to drink every day,
and if owners make sure of having a drinking trough near the house,
the animals will thank him for it. A trough is easily made and
should be kept ﬁlled with fresh water every day.

Goats should be kept in a clean, dry, sheltered place like all
other domestic animals. They do not like to lie on wet, dirty ground,
in any case this can cause sickness.

Do not tie your goats up for long hours on short pieces of rope,
they need plenty of exercise. If they must be tied up at times to
keep them from wandering, give them a long rope so that they can.
lie down comfortably or graze as they like.

Do not beat or kick your goats, treat them kindly.

Regular dipping is good for goats and helps to keep them
healthy.

Dips are easily made at home by scooping out the trunk of a
tree, and every animal owner should have one, or several owners
could share a dip if any expense is incurred in the making.

32

 




Sheep »

,Much the same method used for the care of goats should be
used by owners of sheep. Fat, healthy sheep command excellent
prices and it is a really simple matter for the good sheep owner to
see that his ﬂock gets the best care and attention possible. In this
way he makes sure of their good value when the time comes to sell.
Poor, thin and starved looking animals are of little value to their
owners, but healthy well—conditioned animals can always command
good prices, both for their meat value and their skins.

Do not let your sheep wander unattended otherwise dogs and
other animals can get at them. Sheep are supposed to have very
little intelligence but they do know that they require food and
water to keep them ﬁt and well. Sheep are liable to various diseases
of the skin. When such a thing is detected, the owner should at once
report to the veterinary post for skilled advice. Sheep also get
worms easily and owners should take care to prevent this by giving
suitable worm remedies, and also suitable medicine to get rid of
worms if already present. It is very unwise to allow such a condition
in sheep to be neglected.

A careful and considerate owner will see that he makes a good
strong boma to protect his ﬂock, especially for night protection.

At shearing time be very careful to see that the skin underneath
the ﬂeece is not cut; this can leave nasty wounds and cause suffering
to the animal. Shear carefully and quickly. When a sheep has
to be killed do so humanely and quickly so as not to cause fear and
pain.

See that ewes have extra good grazing; when they have lambs
they require a lot of good feeding. ‘

Do not separate the lambs from their mothers until they are
old enough to help themselves.

 




Lesson 6.
PIGS

Pigs are not commonly kept in Africa, but those owners who
do keep a few pigs, and they are very proﬁtable animals if properly
cared for, the following advice should note:

Pigs should be fed well. They will, eat most things, but fruit
skins, such as paw-paw, melon, pumpkin and such like, make good
feeding, also cassava.

Give plenty of clean water to drink daily.

Pigs should be kept in a good-sized pen, cleaned out every
day and if enough food can be given in the pen this is much better
than allowing them to roam in the bush. They do not require the
same amount of exercise as is given to other domestic animals, but
the pen should be big enough for them to move about freely, and
should be sheltered from the sun and rain.

Do not let lice or other parasites grow on the pigs. A good way
to keep them clean is to rub old motor car oil all over the body, but
if this method is used care should be taken to keep the animals out
of direct sunlight. '

If pigs have worms they will not thrive well and the owner should
consult the veterinary department as to the best kind of medicine
to give them.

When a mother pig has a lot of little piglets to look after, she
should be given much more food to eat, otherwise she will lose condi-
tion and the piglets will not thrive well.

SCOTLAND, U. K.

Dear Isdbcl:

Forgive me for being so slow to respond. I am delighted to
know that you are out of the hospital after successful treat~
ment.

I am cncloaing a check to‘help your good work On the Ghana
correspondence to keep going, and I am cxtrcmaly sorry not to
have been able to deal with the pressing matter of developing
standard literature which you could sand out. I have just
finished the final editing on our 300 page book, Animals and
Their Legal Rights, and on the manual, Comfortable Quarters g9;
Qaboratory Animals, which has also just gone through a new
revision. In addition, there have been tramandoua pressures

on the Endangered Species Act which have necessitated my spend-

ing a great amount of my time to try to head off serious waakan~
ing.

YOu are absolutely right to-hava held off a decisive drive,
because to do that we mush have complete coordination. As you
know, it is not going to'bo possible for no to spend more than

a very small fraction of my time on this work: and it is because
I so greatly value your experience and devotion to the cause that

I wrote to you in the first place. I enclose some additional
latters which need replies.

 




M8. Isobel Slater August 7, 1978

. I am giving your drafts cf leaflets to Caaig Van Note. who .

has racently visited Africa and who serves as Executive Director
of Monitor, a coalition of consarvation and~humane groups. I
hope to be able to write you again soon about the development of
the literature that we need. The one ﬁning we must be sure to
‘watdh is ﬁhat wa do not get in "ever oux‘heada“ and that whatever
program we davalop is one that does not require more time and
energy than wa can handle. ~

Perhaps while you are waiting for more iéeas from an: 3160. yea
‘might wish to try some revisions of your literature‘beeausa I
have an impression~~a generalized ona-that, good as it is, it

is in some respects outdated and needs to be revised~~just as the
publications I mantioned earlier in this Ishtar have had to be
revised. If yau could look them over with an eye to ﬁhe current
situation, it would be very helpful.

Kindest regards anﬁ hoping that ynu are feeling fully recovered
now,

Yours, *

Bear christine,

It is quite a time since I had a letter from you, and
this sakes me a little anxious to feel that you have not receiVed the
letters I sent to you, explaining my suggestions regarding the estab -
lishing an AWI wing in Gnana, or other African countries crying out for
the protection of wild Life in particular.

Please understand my position as regards Ghana - with-
out your directions, how is it possible to put'drive'into the action So
essential to stimulate suCcessful achievement? Up until now, I have been

_holding back the decisive:aove for a go ahead, and merely fostering the
desire to protect the animals. But, and I a sure you realise, Africans
require definite instructions to any action, and from what I have dis—
covered about Ghana, is that the desire is there to promote the welfare

, Hand preservation of animals - however, in my eXperience, a strong lead is
necessary,otherwise interest could evaporate if tactics are delayed. ‘

. I have not yet, felt able to write officially to the
relevant Departments enlisting full co-operation and support. This dees

.trouble we greatly,as I know only too well that any initiative to bear
lasting fruit, must carry conviction.. As I have su gested before,this
would e an excellent period to promote animal méec_tion 1n Afr1ca, by

=‘a U.Q. organisation, so nuCh reSpected as your invaluable AWI.

, However, christine, it needs your difinite instruction.‘
‘As I eXplained in.previous letters, I an not in the financial circuI -
stances to venture back into Africa, at the present time ,except in a
purely organising capacity. Albeit, my name still carries influence in
the Sphere of compassion for all living creatures, with emphasis on the
protection and preservation of animal life, and given the necessary fin-
ancial backing, I am always ready to sail in with all the knowledge and
skill at my command. I know exactly the prodigious amount of work
which surrounds you, but I would ask that you try to squeeze in a modicuI
of time, tonnndxnnr consider  the salient points in my previous letters,
only you, can do this ,with your foresight and understanding. ,

xuuu dmhwboeﬂw; If it is the financial aSpect of launChing into Africa“,
in only a minor way to start, is something that I thoroughly understand,
but there are always ways and means to accomplish anything worthWhile.
- As far as the initial work in Ghana is concerned, the
,eXpenses have been kept at a.niniIII; postages being the largest item in
addition to esSential material required, and of course the time I have _
spent over theseeer the past months - also kept to realistic pro-

portions' I attachh an approx; note of what general expenses

DON KEYS

Our donkeys are ﬁne little animals, and so hardworking and
uncomplaining; patient, and so ready to carry our burdens for us,
also to draw carts and wagons and to pull our ploughs. For this”
reason they are of much value to us and they deserve the best care
and attention possible.

Things that donkey owners should remember:

1. They need good feeding and plenty of fresh, clean water

daﬂy.

2. They should not be worked for more than SIX hours per
day; they should be allowed to graze and rest for the
remainder of the day, i.e. if they work from 7 am. until 1
pm. they should then be allowed to graze and rest.

The good and the bad way of
treating our willing helper,
the donkey.

 




If they wear harness for drawing carts or ploughs, see that
it is soft and well-made otherwise sores will start and this
may cause ill-health to the animal if neglected.

Never mend the harness with pieces of wire as this can cause
very bad sores and will give much pain.

If the donkey is used for carrying loads, see that there is
good, soft sacking under the pack to protect the back,
and be sure to see that the load is evenly balanced half on
each side.

Be very careful not to overload the donkey. It is very sad
to see a small donkey staggering along, hardly able to
walk, under enormous loads of stones, sand or copra.
Sometimes the ignorant and inconsiderate owner adds to
the burden by sitting on top of the whole load! This is very
cruel and it is not allowed. A donkey should not carry
more than .160 lbs on long safari: For short safaris about
200 lbs could be carried, but never with the owner on top
as well.

Never hobble a donkey tightly with a short or hard piece
of rope. The best thing for hobbling is a soft, broad piece
of webbing or a pliable strap of leather. If the animal is
hobbled too tightly it will be liable to fall down, and then
of course, injury can result.

Never work a donkey when he seems lame for this will only
make the condition so bad that he will be unable to work
at all. If any lameness is apparent, rest the animal until
it is ﬁt again; this simple precaution will repay the owner
in the long run.

It is a wise man who knows how to take care of his
donkey.

If the donkey has to wait some little time between loads
during the working hours, slip off his harness or pack to
give him some rest; he will work so much better for this
small consideration. Let him roll in the sand and have a
bit of grazing at one end of a safari; this will refresh him
for the return safari.

Never tie him up for long hours under the hot sun, or in the
rains. Give him a long rope if he must be tied at times,
and ALWAYS GIVE HIM SHELTER.

 




We should never leave our donkey, or donkeys, outside and.
unprotected at night where wild animals on the prowl can
get at them, especially if the donkeyis tied up there can be
little chance of putting up a defence from attack. If you
‘value your good friend, the donkey, and you should value
him when he works so hard to help you, see that proper
provision is made for shelter and protection at all times,
and particularly at night. Old lions often prowl near
villages where they know it will be easy to catch some
domestic animal for a meal as they are unable to go very
far to kill. Donkeys and cattle, in particular, often receive
bad wounds from attack by old lions, and although they
may escape being killed outright, they can suffer greatly
' from wounds. '

We must see to our donkeys’ hooves regularly and ensure
that they are level and even. Through neglect the hooves
of a donkey can become very misshapen and this will hinder
him walking properly; therefore working days will become
limited and ﬁnally cease altogether if he cannot walk.

Do not beat, nor cause any injury to your donkey. Never
drive him fast. Let him, take his time.

If a donkey gets sores these should be washed with a solution
of salt and warm water. Afterwards some healing ointment
should be gently rubbed in and the animal kept out of direct
sunlight. Zinc ointment is a useful thing to keep if you
own animals. Dettol, too, is a very useful antiseptic to
keep .by you, it helps to keep ﬂies away from wounds.
If used carefully, i.e. a teaspoonful to a large cup of water,
you will ﬁnd that a small bottle will last for a long while.

Titks should be removed daily and destroyed immediately,
and the coat brushed with a good hard brush. A wash
once a week with Kerol or Gammatox, according to direc-
tions, will help to keep animal. free from ticks and other ~
harmful. pests.

A healthy, well-kept donkey should have bright eyes
and shiny skin._ No ticks, sores or lameness should be
seen. We must do all possible to ensure that the whole
condition of the animal is good, then we will get good work
and ‘good value in return. It will repay us well to give
this simple care and attention.

 




At times when grazing is poor, try and give an extra ration

' of crushed maize or anything else you are able to procure.
It is not kind to keep a donkey to help you with your work
if you cannot undertake to provide the simple necessities
for his health and well-being,

Donkeys usually like to drink towards evening when
the work is .done, so do ensure that plenty of fresh clean
water is available, a scooped-out tree trunk makes an
excellent drinking trough and, set at a place where the
animals know where to ﬁnd it, it will give pleasure to the
considerate owner to see how the animals appreciate the
water provided for them. I

' Finally, if the donkey seems ill, and you can always telliby
such signs as dull eyes, falling hair and general listlessness,
take him to the nearest veterinary post at once. The sick-
ness may be from one of the several common causes of
animal sickness in Africa, ﬂy sickness or tick fever being
very prevalent. If skilled veterinary aid is obtained as
quickly as possible, there will be a good chance of saving
the animal’s life. The loss of a donkey may mean serious
hardship to an owner. Guard against this misfortune by
ensuring the simple daily care and attention so necessary
to the health and well-being of the animals.

THE GOOD OWNER IS KIND TO ALL HIS BEASTS

 




' OUR GOOD FRIEND THE DOG

Many people like to keep a dog for various reasOns. Dogs
in the home make good and faithful companions and learn through
kindness to guard and protect their master’s property.

A dog should be treated as one of the family and should be
given his food at regular times every day. He should have his own
drinking bowl, and this should be ﬁlled with fresh, clean water daily;
dogs in hot climates require a great deal of drinking water and this
helps to keep them ﬁt. A dog should also have his own bed, or mat
to sleep on. ‘

Dogs should not be neglected in any way, otherwise they will
get into the habit of wandering away and if hungry will pick up all
sorts of dirty things to eat and this can cause sickness. A hungry
dog will also steal food when he gets the chance.

Your dog should be de-ticked and brushed with a good hard
brush every day, and if he shows signs of sickness he should be treated
properly in good time. Most dogs in Africa have worms at some time
or other, and worm medicine should be given properly otherwise
the dog will get into a very bad state of health, thin and miserable.
A sick dog cannot be a happy dog and his value as a guard or
companion can be greatly reduced. Dogs are wise animals and
when they feel out of sorts, they will eat grass, but the kind, careful
owner will watch when the dog eats grass and make sure that the
animal is not really ill. '

Fly sickness is common amongst dogs living in rural areas and
whenever a dog appears to be listless and drooping, lying around
and showing no interest in food, the owner should have the condition
diagnosed by an expert and proper treatment given without delay, '
otherwise the animal willget weaker and weaker, until he ﬁnally
dies. To neglect a dog is very bad, and very unkind to lose a family
friend in this way.

If the dog is a bitch, do take care of her when she is in season.
Do not let her wander around for many dogs to get at her- Try and
keep her indoors and exercise her on a lead outside until the season
period is past. When a bitch is in pup, do give her extra food and

 




care, and see that she has a nice clean place ready where she can have
her pups. When the pups arrive, and there may be many, do not
keep all of them, leave perhaps three at the most with the mother'
The others should be quickly and humanely put to sleep. This is
not cruel, but kind. The most simple and humane way is to take
the pups, especially the female ones, immerse them quickly in a deep
bucket of lukewarm water and keep them under for an hour or more
they will feel nothing if this is done quickly and it is kinder to put
them to sleep as soon as they are born rather than allow them to
grow up unwanted, to become strays, and to suffer from hunger and
disease.

The remaining pups will feed from their mother for six Weeks,
and‘she will be able to feed two or three pups properly, then they
should be given plenty of milk daily, and gradually will. be able to
take other soft food until they are old enough to eat anything.
Bones are good for puppies to chew as these help their teeth and
muscles. ‘

NEVER GIVE DOGS OR PUPPIES CHICKEN BONES
these do not dissolve and can cause serious trouble and even the death
of a dog. If ﬁsh is given, do see that the bones are ﬁrst removed.

After the puppies are six weeks old, good homes should be
found for them. It is not good to keep a number of puppies from the
same litter when they are growing up; they will grow better and
stronger when given new and kind owners.

We must never beat our dogs. If a dog does wrong, and most
dogs will do wrong things until they are trained through kindness,
scold him and make him understand that there are things which he
must not do. Talk to him ﬁrmly and kindly, he will soon under-
stand. . Never make a dog afraid. Do not cheat or tease him. Let
him trust you always and you will get much pleasure from the train—
ing of your dog. Train a dog not to steal eggs, a common failing
with dogs who are hungry: also, not to chase motor cars or bicycles
nor to bite people.

During the training of your dog, when he does what he is told,
give him a special kind word and a pat, also an extra piece of food,
or perhaps a bone. He will understand by that you are pleased with
him and he will wag his tail in gratitude. -

In such a way, a great friendship is established between a man
and his dog.

 




Grown-up dogs require one good big meal every day, usually
in the evening, and perhaps a small bite, or a bone, in the morning.
Puppies require a lot of feeding if they are to grow up strong and
healthy. They should get fed three times a day until they are over
two months old, then they should have two good meals a day.

If a dog is not properly fed he will go out and Steal; and eat.
human manure, which will cause much sickness, he may also kill
other small animals and do many wrong things.

It is good to dip your dog once in two weeks this helps to keep
him free from ticks and other harmful disease carrying pests.

Never use parafﬁn on a dog’s skin for the purpose of g tting rid
of ticks or for any other reason; this can cause a great deal of pain
and irritation and does not help. Sores should be washed with a
solution of salt and warm water, or with Dettol, well diluted.

DO NOT ATTEMPT to cure your dog of sickness unless you
have had expert advice as to the proper kind of treatment, otherwise
more harm than good can be done. A sick animal requires prompt
and skilled attention.

See that the pads of your dog’s feet are always clean and in good
condition. Do not neglect to pull} out any thorns which may have
got into the pads. If the dog limps at any time, examine his feet
most carefully.

A word about hunting dogs. Some people still keep dogs for
hunting; this is not a good way to kill animals for food, nor is it a
good way to keep dogs. Many hunting dogs are in a dreadful con-
dition from wounds received whilst hunting, and when these wounds
are neglected they cause the animal great pain and suffering. Wounds
should always be washed and kept clean, and covered with soothing
ointment, the dog should not be made to hunt until the wounds are
completely healed. Hunting dogs are often starved cruelly, in the
belief that they will be more eager to kill. This is all wrong and it
is to be deplored that. dogs who are the friends of man should be
used for such unhappy purposes as the killing of other animals.
There are other ways in which game can be killed for food.

Finally, DO NOT KEEP A DOG UNLESS YOU ARE
PREPARED TO CARE FOR IT IN THE PROPER WAY, i.e.
giving it the necessary food required daily, and plenty of fresh, clean
water to drink; keeping it free from ticks, and giving it care in sick-
ness; making sure that it has a clean place of its own to sleep.

Dear Isobel,
I was so glad to hear from you but sad to
hear of your husband's death and the great difficulties
you are encountering. Is thereno chance of your working
with an animal protective organization in Africa? It
seemh terrible that your experience and greet ability
should be, if not wasted, at any rate not put to its full
use. It's good that WFPA is carrying on the painting ‘
contest. Are you in touch with hr. Ohudo in Kenya who is
doing a fine job in encouraging enactment of legislation to

keep rare and endangered species out of the importing coun~

tries?

m'm.keeping your phone number to call you when we

comm to London again. I don't know quite when that will be,
but hope to find you when we do come.

Yours,

P.0. Box 5719, Georgetown Station
Washington, DC 20007

Dear Christine:

I was tearful when I received your January 27th letter and the enclosures.
It is incongruous that ISAR should have made those statements about you -
of all the people in the movement. ””“p

I recall that recently, I wrote in a letter to Ed Duvin that you have
been a "martyr" to our cause - that working in so many, many different
areas of animal abuse, it is mind—boggling and even awesome. And in
her June 16, l988 letter to me, Ann Free wrote about the passage of
those 12 bills and that "Christine deserves most of the credit for her
dogged determination."

It is nothing less than irrational that ISAR should have resorted to
using back-biting statements about you when from the beginning of the
real crusade about animal cruelty in this nation, you forged the way
when other organizations (except HSUS in those days) had done nothing
about the institutionalized brutalities to animals. I just hope when
that interview with you comes out in The Animals' Voice, it will serve
to repair this gross injustice to you and SAPL.

Because, where haven't you been relative to work to alleviate cruelty

to animals? Those twelve protective federal laws attest to your efforts.
When I was going through some Christmas cards — those which I could never
discard - those cards hand-drawn by you represent a rich record and
symbolism of your hard work. I took out one - that of calves in cruel
confinement - sent out so many, many years ago when there was no attempt
to work on this cruelty back in those days ~ yet your forward looking
action is with us today, full steam.

No other organization can match the efforts of SAPL in so many areas of
animal abuse — particularly back in the days when organizations were
loath to tackle any institutionalized cruelties. Other organizations
used cute puppies and kittens to accentuate the work but you took the
direct and realistic route and have never turned back from this approach.

I well remember the battles with the NSMR. Particularly Dr. Visscher

who stooped so low as to malign your father. And I recall what the
American Humane Association was like in the early days: quite horrible
and yet it represented the lone voice for local shelters to turn to

for help. (The AHS back in those days fostered further onuelty and

injury to the animals instead of helping them.) I recall those awful

days and the reluctance of other organizations except the Anti-Vivisection
types to approach the laboratory animals' issues.

However, having stated the above, Christine, I cannot agree with the
theory you advanced to the research community about using animals
destined for death in pounds provided they would be fully anesthetized
and used for research without ever recovering consciosness. Despite

 




-2-

the fact that it might discourage some of the terrible people who gather
and sell animals to laboratories, I could never trust any researcher to
abide by the regulations which your plan suggests. Why should anyone
trust them? In all these years of trying to negotiate with them, there
certainly has been a complete lack of any compassion for their research
animals. They have consistently refused even the most moderate of
proposals to ease the suffering. They have always had complete laissez
fairs in the use of their animals and this attitude has never changed.
Even when some of the worst experiments become known to the public, as
in the Silver Spring case, the research community immediately raised
money to help Dr. Taub.

We certainly know by this time hhat the Animal Welfare Act is not helping
the animals. The proposals to enhance the AWA which congress passed in
1985 are still being fought off by the researchers who clearly have the
power to defeat them.

In fact, the twelve protective federal laws which SAPL instigated and
fought so hard for - except for a relatively few ~ must realistically
be termed failures today.

If we have advanced, it is scarcely noticeable. I wish we could be a
little kinder to each other because the work is so difficult, consuming,
and haunting.

On another matter, I had written to William K. Reilly, President of

the World Wildlife Fund after I found out that he had worked against

a total ban on ivory imports into the U.S. We are contributors to

WWF and I was disturbed about this. I am enclosing the letter from him

but I still cannot understand his reasoning against a ban. If you have
the time, I would appreciate your opinion of his stand, and the return

of his letter. I can only hope we won't be disappointed with him as
head of the EPA.

Warmest regards, Christine.

.L.L.LO LIL-LulJ-D 1.1.1.U GLUII

Escondido, CA 92026
Dear Ms. Scott and Mr. Scott:

Thank you for your recent letter inquiring about WWF's
position on elephants and the ivory trade. I abhor the tragic
slaughter of the African elephant and I am deeply concerned that
_ recent newsletters from other organizations trying to raise funds
) have misstated World Wildlife Fund's position. I therefore
especially appreciate your taking the time to write me for
clarification.

In fact, World Wildlife Fund -- the only worldwide
conservation organization with an on-the-ground program in Africa
-- was the driving force behind the new Elephant Conservation Act
(HR 2999), which the President signed into law on October 7.
Since it is difficult to craft a U. S. law that has effect beyond
our borders, the bill as originally drafted called only for a ban
on ivory imports into this country. But the United States imports
only about 10% of all ivory that leaves Africa each year and
global demand far exceeds supply. In the course of our analyses,
WWF concluded that a unilateral U. S. ban on these imports would
merely divert the ivory trade into other markets and would do
nOtning to stop the widespread killing or elephants for their
tusks.

Consequently, we worked very closely with Congressman
Anthony Beilenson of Los Angeles, the original sponsor of the
bill, to produce legislation that would have the maximum possible
impact on reducing international ivory trade. The new bill does
just this. It not only orders the Secretary of the Interior to
impose a ban on all countries that traffic in poached ivory or are
not members of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species (CITES), which monitors ivory trade, but most importantly,
it is forcing Hong Kong and Japan, the world's principal
purchasers of ivory tusks, to stop buying illegal ivory.

Only concerted international action and strong political
and economic pressure against those that traffic in poached ivory
will save the African elephant. In the few months since the bill
passed the U.S. House of Representatives, and in response to
pressure from World Wildlife Fund, the U.S. government, and other
CITES members, two of the worst offenders, Burundi and Dubai, as
well as Japan and Hong Kong, have all taken measures to stop
illegal ivory trade. I am confident that these measures and
others we are discussing with CITES members will substantially
curtail the ivory trade by 1990.

The World Conservation Strategy, which guides the work of
WWF and other major international conservation organizations,
recognizes that conservation of natural resources in most
developing countries can only be achieved when there is an.
economic incentive for doing so. Indigenous people living at the
poverty level are not likely to protect wildlife unless they
benefit directly. It is for this practical reason that World
Wildlife Fund supports the Sustainable use of some species in
circumstances which produce economic benefit for local people and
concomitant conservation. The African elephant, howeverVMis not
one of these species. In our view the killing of elephants for
the ivory trade cannot be justified.

We urge WWF members not to buy elephant ivory. In most
markets it is impossible to tell whether or not ivory jewelry or
other ivory products came from poached elephants. So long as
illegally taken tusks constitute a very substantial share of world
ivory trade -- as they do today -- the purchase of any ivory
maintains market demand, creates an incentive for poaching, and
threatens the very survival of the African elephant.

' WWF's efforts to curtail_the ivory trade are being supple-
”mented by a massive program of assistance to African countries to
‘bclp them stoplpcaCLing;and-protect.elephant populations over the

long term. WWF has taken the lead in preparing with African

governments and other major international organizations a Compre-
hensive, coordinated African Elephant Action Plan that will
require a minimum of $18 million over the next five years. I know
you care as deeply about elephants as we do and I hope that World

Wildlife Fund can count on your Continued support for elephants

and for our other vital conservation programs.

Dear Christine:

Thanks for your letter of the 11th and I'm so glad the clippings I
sent might be useful. It's a shame that I don't get to following up
on some of the news items but I'm kept so busy writing letters that
I have myopic vision and too little time.

You can reach the bait boat captain, Eddie Diehl by writing: E.B.
Diehl, Jr., 1124 Dawnridge, El Cajon, CA 92021. His phone number

is (619) 447-4855. He's a very nice person and we talked for quite

a while. Among other things, he told me that Marie Callender's
Restaurant has made some kind of statement about the dolphin/tuna
issue. My husband stopped in the restaurant here but nobody seemed

to know about this and we can't find any corporate address. He also
said that in regard to the carnage from fishing fleets, the very worst
is the attitude of Taiwan. From his perspective, much worse than is
Japan.

As to the fate of the California animal—related bills, there really
is nothing but discouraging news. I'm enclosing Senator Roberti's
newsletter and I agree completely with his editorial comment.
Virginia Handley had written me that Republicans are told.to vote

NO on animal bills. The good ones have already gone down to defeat
or have become two—year bills. I feel terrible about the Veal Calves
bill. If the bad opponents' bill passes and if the governor does not
veto it, then we have lost for the calves, too. I wrote Roberti that
it's clear the attitudes of our opponents are hardening and I believe
are taking some of our democrats along with them.

The McCorquodale elephant abuse bill now faces the hurdle of the
Assembly Ways and Means Committee on August 25rd.

Warm regards.

August 1989

Dear Friends:

Did you know that more than one hundred bills relat-
ing to animals have been introduced this year? This
is good news on the one hand because it means that
more legislators have developed a sensitivity to the
rights of animals. But, on the other hand, it has unit-
ed the opposition in their efforts to defeat these im-
portant bills. I

Which is why many of this year’s bills have been
defeated and why many have become two-year bills.
There will be no further action on the two-year bills
until next year. . *

Over the years, the humane community has become
more organized. We’ve made substantial progress in
protecting animals from cruelty and misuse. But, as.
this year’s fight over humane legislation indicates, we

still have a long way to go. We need your continued ‘
support and involvement. . . ,- , , ‘

 

 

ELEPHANT CRUELTY
BILL ADVANCES

“It continues to shock me that anyone would try to justify pull-
ing an elephant to the ground and beating it repeatedly with hick-
ory axe handles,” said Senator Dan McCorquodale, author of
legislation to end elephant abuse. “It is even more appalling that
anyone would call such cruelty ‘discipline’.”

The members of the Assembly Public Safety Committee obvi-
ously agreed. They voted unanimously to pass Senator McCor-
quodale’s SB 892. The bill now goes to the Assembly Ways and
Means Committee where it is scheduled to be heard in late
August.

Last year complaints surfaced that Dunda, a captive elephant,
was beaten by four elephant handlers in the San Diego Wild
Animal Park. Senator McCorquodale, Chairman of the Senate
Natural Resources and Wildlife Committee, convened a number
of public hearings on this issue and concluded that a law pro-
tecting‘elephants in captivity was needed. SB 892 outlaws the
use of electricity, food, water or rest deprivation, and punish-
ment which results in scarring or breaking of an elephant’s skin.

Senator McCorquodale announced after the committee vote that
he plans to hold public hearings in San Diego later this year to
determine if state and federal “whistleblower” protection laws
are adequate to protect employees who report animal abuse to
outside authorities. McCorquodale is concerned that the keep-
ers who informed him of Dunda’s beating have allegedly been
harassed and threatened with the loss of their jobs. “If it wasn’t
for these keepers, who truly cared about Dunda when they
worked with her at the San Diego Zoo, we would never have
known about the elephant’s plight,” said Senator McCorquodale.

UPDATE ON THE CENTER FOR
ALTERNATIVES TO THE USE OF
ANIMALS IN RESEARCH

The good news: Last year, the Senate was successful in getting
supplemental budget language passed that directed the Univer-
sity of California to explore the feasibility of creating a Center
for Alternative Methods to the use of animals in research, teach-
ing, and testing.

In April the University delivered a report to the Legislature that
concluded it is feasible to create such a center.

The Senate then requested a $428,500 augmentation to the
University of California’s 1989-1990 budget to provide initial fund-
ing for the center.

The bad news: Unfortunately, once again, Governor Deuk-
mejian vetoed this budget item even though the University of
California supported the augmentation.

More good news: The University of California has agreed, that
by December 1990, it will report to the Legislature on its progress
in using animal alternatives in research projects funded by the
$44 million in Prop 99 research grants it has received. The Prop
99 account funds tobacco-related disease research.

The University’s report will include the following information
from each campus and institution that receives grant awards:
the number and dollar amounts of research grants that did in-
volve the use of animals, the number and species of animals used
in research, and the number and dollar amounts of research
grants that utilized animal alternative methods.

The report will provide valuable information about how the
University is progressing in its efforts to use alternatives to
animals in research.

 

elephant abuse, is scheduled to be heard in the Assembly Ways and
Means Committee in late August.

 




1989-1990
MAJOR HUMANE BILLS

Cockfighting — SB 1587

Increases the penalties for cockfighting from a misdemeanor to
a possible felony. This bill also makes the owners of the birds
responsible for costs of care after their birds are seized. Provides
that cases involving seized animals and cocks will be tried with-
in 60 days of the seizure of the animal. Two 30-day continuances
may be granted.

Assembly Ways and Means Committee. No hearing date set yet.

Elephant Abuse — SB 892 (McCorquodale, D-San Jose)

Makes it a misdemeanor for any owner or manager of an
elephant to engage in abusive behavior towards the elephant.
This would include the discipline of the elephant by any of the
following methods: Deprivation of food, water, or rest, use of
electricity, physical punishment resulting in damage, scarring,
or breakage of skin, insertion of any instrument into any body
orifice.

Passed Assembly Public Safety 7-0 on 7/ 18. To Assembly Ways
and Means.

Veal Calves — SB 1110 (Marks, D-San Francisco)

Ends archaic practice of chaining a veal calf in a 22” wide en-
closure, preventing the calf from turning around for the entire
span of its brief life. Outlaws the method of raising so—called “milk-
fed” veal which necessitates feeding the calves an artificial, iron-
deficient formula laced with antibiotics.

Passed Assembly Public Safety 6-1 on 7/ 18. To Assembly Ways
and Means Committee.

Product Testing — SB 60 (Robbins, D-Van Nuys)

Requires manufacturers of cosmetic and other household
products who test those products on live animals to provide labels
disclosing that practice to the consumer. Companies that fail to
label their products would be guilty of a misdemeanor.

ln Senate Appropriations. Two year bill.

LD 50/ Draize Ban — AB 2461, (O’Connell, D-Carpenteria)

Bans the use of the Draize Eye lrritancy Test, the Skin lrritancy
Test and the Lethal Dose Test for testing cosmetics and house-
hold products upon animals within the State of California. The
Draize Test, used to determine the irritancy of a cosmetic, in-

volves spraying or squirting substances such as nail polish
remover, shampoo or eye shadow on the eyes of immobilized
rabbits. The Lethal Dose Test has been used to determine the
toxicity of floor wax or detergents by forcing animals to ingest
these substances.

On Assembly floor. Two year bill.

Killing Pets for Food — AB 1842 (Speier, D-South San
Francisco)

Makes it a misdemeanor to kill dogs or cats for the purpose of
eating them (an accepted practice in some cultures). Current laws
prohibit cruelty to animals but do not outlaw killing them for
food.

On Senate floor.

Steel-Jawed Traps — SB 756 (Marks, D-San Francisco)

Requires any person using these traps to be licensed and the traps
to be identified. Also provides for the inspection and removal
of animals from the traps. In addition, the Department of Fish
and Game is required to develop standards that are necessary
to ensure the competence and proficiency of applicants for a trap-
ping license.

In Assembly Ways and Means but no date set for hearing.

Puppy Mills — AB 2001 (Farr, D-Carmel)

Enacts the Consumer Pet Protection Act. Prohibits pet shops from
selling puppies under twelve weeks old and allows customers
who buy sick puppies to be reimbursed for veterinary bills. Also
provides the customer with the right to return the animal and
receive in exchange an animal of equivalent value, of the con-
sumer’s choice.

Failed on Assembly floor 40-33.
Mountain Lions — AB 860 (Katz, D-Sepulveda)

Prohibits the sport hunting of mountain lions. Also requires the
Department of Fish and Game to prepare a plan for the manage-
ment of mountain lions. $70,000 would be appropriated from
the California Environmental License Plate Fund to the Depart-
ment for this expenditure.

In Assembly Ways and Means. Two year bill.

COCKFIGHTING LEGISLATION NEEDS YOUR SUPPORT!

Senate legislation that would increase the penalty for cockfight-
ing from a misdemeanor to a felony 18 facing major opposition.
SB 1587 is scheduled to be heard in the Assembly Ways and
Means Committee soon after the legislature reconvenes on Au-
gust 21. Members of the Committee need to hear from you about
the importance of this legislation.

Cockfighting exists not only in rural areas but in California
cities as well. Cockfighting is big business. Thousands of dollars
exchange hands during these fights. Law enforcement is con-
cerned about the illegal gambling, concealed weapons and il-
licit drugs that are commonplace at a cockfight.

At a cockfight, two roosters are placed in a pit where they are
forced to fight — usually to the death — for the amusement or
gain of their owners and spectators. The birds have steel imple-
ments — which resemble ice picks and knives —— attached to their
feet. These birds, which are bred to be very aggressive, rip and
tear at each other until one is dead or too mutilated to continue.

Cockfights often last for more than fifteen minutes. If the fight
isn’t over then, the birds are moved to a smaller pit where the
fight continues until a winner is declared. Cockfighting is inhu-
mane and must be stopped.

Please let your legislator know of your support for SB 1587.

SB 1587 would make cockfighting in California a felony. Cockfighting
is inhumane and must be stopped.

 

 

NOTICE

In June 1988, the voters approved Proposition 73. Among other things, Proposition 73 placed cer-
tain restrictions on mailings which are sent out by government offices. As a result, this office may
no longer keep you updated on items of interest to you unless you specifically request that we do so.

L ' ' them. A few species of birds do harm to growing crops and should
be frightened away, but much more harm is done to mom, fruits and
grain; by insects. The birds are our very useful helpers as they
get rid of these pests for us. ‘ Bll‘dS"Wlll work all day destroying

Lesson 3.

CATTLE

 

Our cattle mean wealth to us; it is thereforeto our great advant-
age to care for them in the best possible way. Their welfare means
our welfare and that of our families. we therefore show them kind-
ness and consideration in the following ways.

1. We must feed them well. See that they have plenty of
good grazing. It is particularly important to remember that in
times of drought the animals should be moved in good time to areas
where grazing is still plentiful. To wait until the grazing in the
usual area is’dried up IS VERY BAD AND NEGLECTFUL and
leads to much hardship and suffering both--former-animals;who—fare

selves,“who.. can in times of drought lose their animals through
sickness and starvation,_therebylosing their own means of livelihood.

7‘\ 1

Extra Feeding. It is a good plan to try and have a store of
extra food for use in times of drought. More root crops could be
grown and saved for the time when natural grazing becomes depleted.
Cattle like mealie (mihindi) stalks, or mealies themselves if there are
enough to spare. Mealie stalks might be stored or put into pits
well tramped down (silage). Prickly pearsﬁwithou‘t thornsﬁchopped up,
and mahogo, also make good extra feeding. In areas Where Kikuyu
grass or lucerne can be grown it is a good idea to grow patches of
these; if cut and stacked they will be ready in times of need. Cattle
require food all the year round if they are to remain in good healthy
condition and of the best value. Ownerszwhefeally-‘va‘lueand.cons.i.der..;-.:-*

of cattle that can be fed well and adequately and properly cared
for. In this way only can good healthy stock be raised.

2. WATER in plenty is essential for the health and well-being
of all cattle and here again the careful and considerate owner will
take steps to ensure that an adequate water supply 15 available. In
areas where water is likely to dry up at various seasons owners should
do all possible to co- operate with each other 1n trying to ﬁnd a means
whereby a good water supply can be provided. The making of a
well might mean a little expense, but in the end it would be greatly
worth the little expense and trouble entailed. It is not right to
imagine that cattle can do without water they all need water, but of
course if there 13 no water available they have to go without, and this
sometimes makes people think that they do not need it at all. This
is quite wrong. Fresh clean water daily will contribute in a large
way to the healthy condition of our animals. ~

3. Salt is another thing necessary for the animals. Cattle like
to lick salt and it is so good for them. Try to provide this very
simple necessity and it will give pleasure to owners to see how much
their animals appreciate it. -

Owners of only a few cattle should have no difﬁculty in ensuring
adequate feeding and watering of their stock. It is a bigger respon-
sibility for owners W1th large herds to see that the animals are well
fed and watered, but it is to their own advantage to make certain
that the animals get all the care and attention required to keep them
in health and in proﬁtable condition. ,

From well cared for animals we can get much more meat, milk
and money, and also good manure for our shambas. We can also
get strong and healthy calves.

Things to remember when a cow is in calf:-

Do not drive her fast, nor make her walk far.

Give clean, dry shelter at night.

Give her extra food.

Do not make her work in any way. ,

Do not sell her unless you are sure she will be well cared for.
Do not hobble her tightly.

See that she 18 de- ticked properly when she cannot be dipped.

When the calf comes see that it gets ENOUGH MILK, temalee

mother’s milk. It will repay us so very much more to let the calf have
all the mother’s milk it needs until it is well on the way to growing
up strong and healthy THIS POINT CANNOT BE STRESSED
TOO MUCH.

If all the foregoing simple and natural instruction is given due
consideration the animals will be kept in good condition and con—9““
sequently be of much more value to us and our families.

Other things regarding health to remember:

Dipping is good and necessary for cattle as this helps to keep
them free from disease.

At the ﬁrst sign of any sickness'try to get skilled veterinary
attention immediately,for in this way we may be able to arrest any
serious sickness or disease, thereby saving the life of our animal.
Also it is important to remember that if an animal shows any sign
of sickness it should be separated at once from the other animals.
Keep it in a clean, dry place by itself until the sickness has been
properly diagnosed. In this way the other animals may be prevented
from catching the sickness should it be of ambadwkindt

If an animal gets injured many-way,-vorperhapsbreaks a limb,‘/-:”-¥~~-~-m
do all possible to care for it. Do not try to make it walk; pest-it "
quietly. Bytaking—thts~simple-~.—precaut»ion»~its- life andvaluemay be

It is good to keep some useful antiseptic dressing handy, such
as Dettol, for the treatment of sores and wounds, for by this means
serious sickness from neglected wounds may be prevented. A mild
solution of salt and warm water is very good for washing wounds,
if no other dressing is available.

Another important thing to remember is that the hides of cattle
are valuable, and if an animal is beaten, apart from the cruelty aspect,
the hides may be spoiled and their value lowered. Cut or bruised
hides are worth little compared with those of kindly treatedanimals.
Webbing sticks should be used for driving cattle or other animals.

When branding has to be done, take care that this is done humane-
ly and quickly. Do not allow the animal to be tortured,in—-A~the~
processasahis—m-ay possibly lead to loss of goodcondition. through
the state of fear and suffering which the animal experiences.

Cows should be milked twice daily at regular times. Neglectl./"'l;'
to do this can cause the animals great discomfort. See that hands _
are clean for milking as this all helps to keep the cow healthy and.....; m

Remember that the manure from cattle is excellent for the
shamba, and if the cattle are kept in clean, dry bomas (with shelter
. from the rain) the manure can be easily gathered and will prove of
great value for 9di»crops. ‘

Finally, when an animal has to be killed for food, see that this
is done QUICKLY AND HUMANELY. Do not torture with a
slow and painful death, this is very cruel and alsB lessens the quality
and value of the meat.

W
POULTRY (FOWLS)

Our fowls bring us in money and give us food, and for this reason
. we must treat them properly. Here are some things to remember
when we keep fowls: ‘ . ’

I. They should have protection from the sun and rain and
also to keep them safe at nightﬁwe should build a small hut for
them. ' In the hut we should put several perches where the fowls can
roost; theylike to sleep like this, off the-ground. Also make a few *
nesting boxes so that the eggs will always be laid there and can easily ‘
be found, and will not get stolen.

 

 

Fowls who have no house to sleep or nest in, and no boxes in

which to lay their eggs, get into the yep/y bad habit of wandering away

' and laying their eggs where they cannot always be found. This is

aloss to the owner, and sometimes when the eggs may be found
they are too bad to sell or use, andpso are valueless.

It should not be muchtrouble to build a small fowl house, and‘in
this way, the fowls are properly cared for and will prove of much
_more‘value to the owner. _

'2‘. Sand or ashes should always be available for the fowls to
scratch in and dust themselves. Fowls like grit; it is good for their
health and helps to produce good eggs.” ‘

3. Food should be given every day. - Fowls are fond of green
food, and grain,as&-~well.” To ensure that your fowls will remain
healthy and lay good eggs, itiswgoodvtOU—try,and give them extra food
tathatwhiclipthey pick up when foraging.

4. Water is most important. There should always .be'a good
supply, of fresh, clean water in a drinking vessel so that the fowls
can drink as much as they like every day. Fowls kept without water
get ill and often die.

5. Chickens should be looked after well, and should be kept
in a small enclosure, well-protected from hawks and other'birds
who Would swoop down and take them away. The mother hen
should get extra feeding whilst looking after her newly hatched
chickens. *

. - . .m‘.._.....u_4.... .- -.

 

6.- Great care should be taken when transporting fowls to
market. They should never be packed in small baskets so that
they can hardly breathggf, Give them a good sized crate with tins
ﬁxed to the sides to hold food and water for the journey. In this
way, the fowls will arrive in good condition and will fetch better
prices.. The crate should be covered on top with leaves to protect

the birds from the sun during the journey and when waiting at the
market to be sold. ,

On short vjourrreyss‘ifdo not carry the fowls upside-down, or by
the wings, nor again, tie their legs so tightly together that it hurts
them. Carry them under your arm. .

If you are walking a long way, demos-forget to}. carry a little

1""

j 'maize in your pocket and a small tin for water, so that the birds may
> not go hungry and thirsty. By doing this you are keeping, the fowls
~ well and contented and their condition will be sonveriy” much} better. .

It is cruel to neglect the care of your fowls even if you intend .. 7
to sell them. Ducks should also receive the proper treatment, and

have plenty of water provided. for them; they love to Splash about in

’ mud and water. Do not carry a duck by its wings, this~iscruelfi~ '

the wings can get torn from.» thebody through‘be'ing carried-inthis”
way,-»andiw-a-wlot‘ of‘suﬂ’ering can be caused to the bird?“ One duck
can be carried under the arm, and two or more ducks can be carried

_ in an airy and roomy basket, when taking them to the market.

Many people living in Africa seem to thinktthat fowls can look

‘ after themselves and do not require to be fed regularly. This is all
~ wrong, and the reason whythe fowls are so thin and poor-looking,

and the eggs so small and of little value.
Care and good feeding, water and shelter, will help to make

ﬁne healthy birds, and produce good, big, and valuable eggs.

When fowls appear sick and off their food, warm milk and

' bread may prove useful, but it is a good plan to separate any sick-

looking fowl from the others incase the sickness may be catching,

INTRODUCTION

 

Based Qh_the knOWAedge"that it is imperative for a World Organisa-
tion.to try everything humanly possible to improve the situation
'as far as theftreatmentZOfoarm animals is concerned in countries
outSide_Europe, a pian with this aim in mind was deVeloped two,
years ago,; rIShEdftheninimind”mainlyjthe Afro-Asiatic Terri-r
tory.”” Primarily, the problems of transportati0n_and.slaughter
should be taken into consideration. It is well known that in'

.th se two areas in particular_the greatest atrocities are being

Icommittedi.:_ ,,..
For that reaSbn I pregented‘ahd exPlaiHEley intention in thiS‘
direCtiOn'of‘Aﬁimalfﬁelfare,ftowthe“Councillof_theyworldiFedera—
tion for the Protection Of Animals, as it was then Called, as
early as in the year 1979. For a pilot prOjeCt, some important
countries in Africa were envisaged. For the preparation of suCh
a-mission and the necessary diplomatic consultation during the,
trip, Federal Minister (retired) Professor Dr. Lujo Toncic-Sorinj
was kind enough to offer his services. I knew him from the time
when he was Secretary—General of the Council of EurOpe, and wef
have been good friends ever since. ‘

WFPA Council approved my plan and accepted the costs that
wouldgarise if the reject was carried out, namely_amounting to

S.frs. 20.ooo.——. approximately.

Due to availability of time, it was decided that the trip should
cOmmence towards the end of 1980 but regrettably, for reasons
which I am unable to give here in detail, the trip to Africa was
not possible.

Therefore, I decided at the beginning of 1981 to undertake this
project alone and without the financial help of the World Society

for the Protection of Animals, which had, in the meantime, come
into being.

Furthermore, I was convinced that, amongst other duties, it was

the first and foremost task of the President of an Animal Protection
organisation to take the initiative himself and conduct discussions,
personally, with Governments,in particular Governments of the '
Third WOrld, for the purpose of improving Animal Protection.

Together, with Professor Toncic, we chose first of all Kenya, the
Sudan and Egypt, the trip to commence on 20th September, 1981._

The result of this mission is given in detail in the attached
Report.

The following facts have emerged as being absolutely crucial:-

1) If any success should be obtained at all, no matter whether
; short term, medium or long term, then negotiations must be'
conducted with the governments of the countries concerned,
that is to say, with those officials who can understand the
situation and who, due to their official position in
government, are able to make commitments.

'To make such a mission at all possible, organisation and
technical help from the Embassies of important countries
represented in the Third WOrld is essential. Appointments

can only be made on the spot when in the country of destina—
tion, but not from home.

 




_ 2 1

In this case, I must say that without the direct intervention=g
of Federal Minister Ertl and the Foreign Ministry as well asm'”
. the Austrian Foreign.Minister, Dr. Willibald Pahr, most probably
rnOthing would have-been achieved. M»Without the help and support
‘given to us by the German and Austrian Ambassadors in Nairobi,
Khartoum afi Cairo, everything most certainly would not have-
gone as planned .- ,v~~ '. ;.. ' 1 -

The results as couid not be expected Otherwise — were achieved

by hard and difficult effort. ._Most certainly it will take some
time, and more eSpecially the support of the German Federal
Government, to bring the individual agreements to fruition.
Therefore, We shoUld consider to aim our next project for the
Asiatic territories. 3- ~ -. . m .

Kenya is surrounded by countries where Animal protection is

practically non existent ~ with the exception of Tanzania -
therefore there has been no COOperation with Kenya so far.

The position in Tanzania is not quite clear beCause“0f the
'political instability in that_country.v .The border is at
:present-completely_closed.P'IIniaddition, there are also very
bad economic conditions. ;_These will increase as the p0pu~

_L‘They make Special efforts as far as ”Wildlife" is concerned,
taking into account that income from tourism plays an
important partué' . ' ‘ ' -‘ ”

A very important personality here is Vice—Minister Philip Leaky,
i>M§P$'~ Ministry-of the Environment and Natural Resources.

The'diScuSSions.with Mr. O. Kibinge, the Permanent Secretary
iof State in the Ministry of Livestobk DevelOpment and his
DepartmenteDirector Dr. NyangaiwnﬁjveryconstruCtive. It

had been planned that the Minister fOryAgriCulture, Dr. Mango,
'should take part in the discussions himself, however, he had
to be excused because of a sudden official Visit to India.

”To~his representative, Mr- Kibinge, I eXplained the situation
‘”as far as "TranSport” and-“Slaughter”aro concerned, the way

'we see it, and I stressed that they should try and reach the
EurOpean standards in these fields if only for esonomic,
hygienic and not least cultural aspects.' ‘Thérefore, it would
be a very good solution if they were to adopt the two EurOpean
Council Conventions on ”TranSport" and ”Slaughter“. ‘ As far

'as the financial side was concerned, this could almost certainly
“beésOlved through the German.Aid for Developing COuntries.

we handed the two gentlemen the texts 0f both Conventions.

"Whether Kenya will be able to join such an "open" Agreement is
at presentdoubtful. as Kenya would then be the first-African
state joining a EurOpean Convention. However, Several bi-

Nairobi will again allow us to use its services.

IDiscussions with Mr. J. N. Kiio, the Under Secretary in the
"M1nistry of Natural Resource es, covered above all, the situation
of "Wildlife". .7 After the prohibition cf hunting in Kenya
'in 1975, one would eXpect the wildlife stock to have recovered
in numbers. This seems, however, only partly true i It is
“true that the hunters have disappeared in the wildlife
reserv01rs but the poachers in this territory still stick
~tOgether Kenya has at present about 1,800 Rangers however
‘VHOO‘more are needed. 1 Furthermore, there are note neugh motor
vehicles available and there is only(nn3helicOpter “which is
at present out of order. There is therefore, a need for a number
of heliCOpters and small aircraft so that the vast territories
‘*can be observed from the air. I Kenya will not be able to solve
these problems without foreign aid. »

The Director of Wildlife Conservation in‘Langata, Dr. David Lindiyo
Confirmed this This young and very approachable man is
doubtless working very hard to bring a solution to the many
problems in his country. The Na atiOnal Park which is close to

his office accommodates a large number of wild :1nimals, whose

' protection can be more easily assured because the park, being

' so close to Nairobi, more efficient control can be exercised.

At the reception a.nd during dinn r at the residence of the
Austrian Ambassador, -Dr. Woschnagg, I had an Opportunity for
several interesting conversations, among others, with the
President of the Kenya SPCA Mr. Monk. He told me that the
Kenya SPCA ha.d no animal .shelte r at preSent. The'only shelter
which they had was in the old airport of Nairobi. 'When the
airport closed, the shelter had been discontinued. No new
shelter had been installed in the new airport so far. I told
him that State Secretary Kibinge had informed me that suitable
shelters for animals would be erected in the new airport; ‘ the
'building work had not yet been complete ed. I told Mr. Monk of
our plans for im-provement in the field of Transoort and
Slaughter. "I calso had an interesting conversation With

Dr. Norbert Greer (Austrian Veterinarian) at present working on
a project in North Kenya for the protection of Rhines. He
promiSed to let me have a report.

Discussions in the training centre of the Meat Department.
This Centre had been built with the help of FAO and the Danish

' 1"Government with British support. It has served as a training

*centre for slaughterhouse Workers.'I Every year two oeurses
are held for 24 peOple i. e. about 50 peOple per year.‘ The
work force is not sufficient from this, partly becauSe some of
the peeple taking the course go to other African oeuntries
”after completion of the course. 2,000 fully trained workers
are needed whereas only 200 are available at present.'

There are three export slaughterhouses i. e. in ﬁenya,-Nairobi
andeombasa and in Uplans there is a spec cial slaughterhouse
'"with meat factory for pigs. Ielectrical stunning cf the
"a nimals is carried out bcfor—e they tr' bled. Training of the
slaughterhouse workers is in two groups:

Ia)IfOr'workers: stunning, slaughtering and cutting up of
" ‘ carcases, two weeks theoretie1l introduction followed by
2 months practical work in the slaughterhouse.

 




; 9 -

for superVisors: ,edubstien,in hygiene, learning to
' distinguish'between different-qualities of meat and
~ manufaCturing of meat prOducts;_ training time 3 months.

The stunning of larger animals is usually done by hammer
as there is no ammunition for captive—bolt pistols which
‘are only partly available because.there is not sufficient

' money.‘ ”"' '

Particularly interesting:~;

.V,At present anybody can Open a butcher‘s shop in Kenya, without
.VFSpecial.training.i ,There-are numerous small slaughterhouses
, and butchers in the country, and the method uSed for such
slaughtering simply defies description.

I believe Dr. Munyao when he says he would like to See conditions
in this sector correSpond to a geod European'standard.
Above all he would like to see

i) .the erection of a model slaughterhouse;
ii) ‘the erection of a model meat products centre;
iii) a model butcher's shOp. ‘

, I have promised to very sincerely investigate the possibilities
of the realisation of such plans.- ’ ‘

10 After a short inepection of the training centre, we_travelled

to the slaughterhouse.l Following a talk with the manager

gand veterinarians there,-we denned protective Clething and
started our inspection tour of the building. *This is the
largest slaughterhouse in‘Kenya. Buildings and installations
-are rather.old, their conditiOn, however, relatively good.
Approximately 8,000 animals are being slaughtered here every
month, particularly cattle, not so many sheep and goats. 1 The
-capacityiwould-be sufficient for double the number.~ 90% is

f r eXpOrt as fresh meat and in tins,-whilst 10% is used for
home.consumption and is stored in the meat depot.‘ Corned beef
(70%) goes to Great Britain,~20% fresh Jeat‘and 10% other meat
products go to Hong Kong and the Middle East and to Mauritius.

10? of the total turnover from slaughter in Kenyaiis being
_handled in this slaughterhouse, =~ r

Delivery of animals is by goods train, the siding (next to the
Nairobi/Mombasa line) can hold 25 containers; These‘are‘
suitable for transporting animals; the upper third being
eventilated~and the floor corrugated so that the animals cannot
slip. There is also delivery by lorry;' The shelters after
~unloading, appeared to be clean. From.there, the animals

are driven to tha slaughterhOuse-where a passage allowing only
one animal to pass at a time leads directly to the slaughter
room. The animals pass through a shower on.the way to the
slaughter room to cleanse them from dust and dirt.* -At the
end of this passage the animals pass along into a b x and when
the door of this box is closed the animals are restrained.

A butcher who stands on a platform over the head of the animal
usesa_captive—bolt pistol - at least in our presenCe.P The
first shot did not have any effect, only at the second shot
did the~animal collapse. I Then the side door of the box was
Opened, the animal rclled out and another butcher cut its throat.

~In deference to the Mohammedan pepulation another man next

lto the animal read something from the Koran. "’we were told it
went like this: ”Allah is great and Mohammed is his prophet".
fWewere infermed-that the head of the animal must always be

in the direCtion of Mecca;' ”'i' .; ”7 '

To ensure thorough drainage of blood, the carcaSSos are sus-
pended on the hook of a moving chain which transports them
to the next upper level where they are then cut up. ';

M Sheep and goats are transported to the upper storey at a

",different entrance where they are led through a small winding

I'passage toa sort of slaughter table._ We were told that a
Smaller bolt apparatus is used, however, we could not check on
this as there were neither sheep nor goats there at the time.

We watched the meat processin“ handlin- and ackurin of
. , . . .1 s, g . p e g

fresh meat as well as the production of corned beef. , However,
these details are not relevant to animal protection.

We would mention that almost everything was done by hand without
the use of machines. Hundreds of.men and women work in the
depots, cutting the meat and packing it in foil.

11 At the reception and dinner at the residence of the German
Ambassador, I had an opportunity to have important discussions
,with, amongst others, the Viceuminister Philip Leakey. ,I
’spoke to him also about the incident at Nairobi Airport, where
a consignment of l7OMnonkeys which had_ccme from EthiOpia via
Nairobi and destined for Moscow, had arrived at_Nairobi with
the animals being very sic: and desolate. All the animals had
Ito be killed. Mr. Leaky told me that his Government had
‘StOpped,all tranSit-traffic for animals immediately.,
Furthermore, as from 25thpSeptember,1981 strict prohibition for
trapping of monkeys would bein force.

Mr. Leaky also told me about the Wildlife.clubs with 70,000
members in Kenya. He suggested.cooperatimi with these Clubs,
‘Vthe idea of animal protection could be spread generally through
them. During this conversation as well as On other occasions,

I brought up the question of Animal protection as a subject

in schools. We shall have to think about the_type of '
instruction material which we could send to the schools via the
Ministry of Education. ,_The Embassies will also help us to
make the right contacts. -

Another extremely useful conversatiOn was the one I had with
Herr Niessen of.the:DGE {German Society-for Aid to the
Developing Countries).h He lives at_present in_Nairobi and
guides DeveIOpment Projects. , The plan to.build model inStalla—
tions in Kenya, such as a slaughterhouse, meat processing
plants and butchers‘ premises was of great interest to him.

He saw possibilities.to interest the_German industrial circles
concerned in these projects., On his advice I shall contact
Dr. Lohmann the Manager of DGB,_responsible for Africa. I

Dr. Lohmann is going to Kenya at the beginning ofxDecember;

I Siall Speak to him before then in Cologne.

During the safari tour undertaken by Prof- Toncic and myself
onithe'23rd September (organised by the Austrian.Embassy),
we tried to get some information regarding the animals there.

gfour times.

Sever al high officials at the Winistry took part in the
discussions in his office at the Ministry of Agriculture
When we came to discuss the subject of ”s laughter", the
follOwinchommen s were made by thengyptian offici ale:

.‘1

aThe religious commandments of islamvare strictly
.c onItrolledI by the  eccle s iastic al bodiCs;

These rCllFlOJS commandments demand the  taking of
blood from the living animal;

They say thzt if stunning is applied by way of using
'the cz1ptive- bolt pistol lectr1C1ty etc. it could not
be guarante Ced that the animals are mCrely stunned and
would return to consciousness. EXperiments carried
out'in"Greece had shown that out of ten cattle stunned
by way of‘CaptiveLbolt pistol, eight were found to

be dead.

Such a procedure would therefore in no way be
acceptable. Be sie des this, they were of the
oi3inion that a quick out through tIhe throathould
result in a sudden, shock— like reduCtion in

blood pressure; this quick extraction oi,blood
'from the brain would result in immediate
'unconsciouSneSS and tierefor immunity to pain.

To these arguments I replied as follOws:

to a). According to our information there is no sura in the
* Koran'which indicates in any way a partic Lular
‘method of slaughter to be used which prohibits
stunning before blood is  take . It is much
'more likely, in my opi n1on, that this habit
represents an old cus stem, a tra dition.'

Not one off. the gentlemen present could quote a

mcorresponding.sura from the Koran for me. However,
'they said they would try and get information for

me in this reSpect.

According to EurOpean standard and after many years

‘of scientific investigations, the taking of blood
Afrom;a stunned animal was equal to taking blood

from a conscious animal. It was completely futile
to discuss this question-any more '**

Beside s,_it is a fact that the thro.ats of smaller

to me.

Dr. Hafiz replied to thisi

Such methods weim comp3ete ly impossible at

'perform the cut through the throat when they are

The subject of the TranSportation Of animal” was widely

idis cues ed. ’Ihe proble  1s here are DurthUl rly financial which
means that there is oract1cally no_money to acquire suitable

asked whether it-would be pQSSible to have two large vehicles
suitable for the tranSportation of animals supplied by

west Germany, these vehicle cs t'o' be . sed for trial purposes
to ascertain if they would be 1t1sf1ctory in Egypt for

the tranSportation of animals forﬂsLaughter . L I a.greed

to approach our respective Ministry to look into this

matter. I ' E ‘

'ﬁha nded to him by the German “mbassad)r Dr. Hille. The

hMlnlStUr of State also.weleomed the suggestion that a

, representative from Egypt be admitted to the Board of
WSPA as An Advisery.Director, and who could also act as

_a contact man, perhaps to start with, the Egyptian Ambassan
dor in Bonn could be delegated for this post.

Visit to Schubra, the seat of.the Cairo SPCA. Here
informative discussions with Dr. Samir Saleem and his
Ecolleagues took place.

The SPC’ with administrative building,-animal shelter and
've terin ry installations.was started in 1965. Dr. Salem,
wheSe rnain occupation is Dir;~Gen- of Veterinarians in Cairo,
Honorary President of the SPCA. His Board consists of
15 members, seven of whom are in administration, and the

remainder with the veterina.ry polio edahd other efficiAI posts.

Ten veterinarians, delegated as re cq_uired by Dr. Salem' S
_foice, work in-Schuhra, also thirty pe ceple work as
wardens for the animals in- the organisation etc.

.4The: main work of the SPCA consists of veterinary care for
sick or injured animals, mainly denkeys, horses a.nd dogs
and also the introduction of an educe tie; n programme, the
material for'Whieh comes mainly from-the UK and the USA.

With the help of the R)yal Soc1 e for the Prevention of
Cruelty t0.Animals a film was mad Which is new being shown
.in the cinemas. ~The film depic LtSWSOOd-and bad animal
shusbandry. - , -

The 1980 Report of the Cairo SPCA showed that 3,481 animals
had been accepted to the shelter iae, 601 horses, 104 mules,
.948 donkeys, 598 dogs, 1,2h0 sheep, goats etc. All these
animals-were in bad condition oniacceptance to the shelter.
Some had to be put to sleep,vand-otherswhere handed back

to their owners after treatment.- We were told that animals
are mos stly brought to the shelter by the police.

-Injectiens are also ae minis wtej ed-at the-shelter. Dr. Salem
thinks that-due to the efficient and dedicated work of his
organisation, conditions-will gradually improve. He

thinks that this is proved, amotigs t other factors, by the
.reduction in-the number of the animals brought to the
shelter.-. In the re port of the year 1979 there were

4,249 animals admitted to the shelter, ill or injured.

Dear Trs. Stevens,
Many thanks for your letter dated 4th December, 1978.

I shall write to ﬁrs. Isobel Slater and find out whatever
assistance she could give to me, since my activities in Ghana
are relatively new.

I am still negotiating with the authorities of Ministry of
Education to introduce Humane Education to the Elementary
School teachers. I may need real guide lines from many
European countries and then adOPt whichever may be suitable to
my work in Ghana.

I hOpe you will continue to co—oPerate with me. YOu might

have learned in Berlin after seeing the slides from Ghana that

I haﬁe . very many activities to cover.

With best wishes,

Yours/gaithfully,

Ault'Wharrie ,—

Royal Scottish Masonic Home
Dunblanc

Pertshire, Scotland

Dear Isobel,

I tried repeatedly to phone you at the Royal Scottish Masonic
Home, but when I finally got through they said that you were not there,
so I am writing and marking this "please forward". After I got' our
letter I thought it best that we talk on the phone to establish ow
we could work together more effectively. It seems to me that what is
necessary if you are willing to continue is for you to write out a
budget for thenamount of money that will be necessary in order to carry
. forward the work efficiently. At the moment we are having a badge
designed by the man who has done our designing as a volunteer for the
last couple of years, but he has not sent it back as yet.

Concerning WEPA, we had no wish at all to create some sort of
competition. It simply occurred that I met the young man from
Ghana when I went to the WFPA meeting in order to give a talk on
laboratory animals. I didn’t have an Opportunity to have any
extensive talk with him owing to the fact that I was unable to stay

-» at the meeting during the whole week but only came to give my talk

and to attend a few of the sessions. However, we did ride on a.bus
together back to town on one occasion and talked during that brféé
interval. That is why he sent me all the materials which he had
published. I spoke of you and said perhaps we could all work.together.
Certainly I had no wish to create ill feeling, and I am sorry to hear
that the WOrld Federation has taken advantage of materials which you
have so kindly allowed them to use. Unfortunately, I don't know the
woman who has been handling this at all. Indeed I have now even
forgotten her name although I heard it.

    
 
 

I hope you will write me about this because I think it would be
very hmch too bad not to continue as we have planned to do. The main
problems are; 1) I have virtually no time to devote, and that is of

 

    




Mrs. Isobel Slater“ N.B.E.
February 2, 1979
Page 2

course the reason that I was so happy that you were able to take over
writing letters, 2) we cannot put in unlimited amounts of money, but
we could put some in and if we had an estimatedfor the year, an amount
that you think would work, we would make it a point to raise money for
that purpose.

‘ I agree with you that we need to focus on all kinds of animal
welfare not just on whales, and, as you.know a young girl who was
volunteering with us this summer made paste-ups of some of your
leaflets and sent cepies to you for your approval. I believe you
received them but if not, please let me know. These Would, of course,
be very inexpensive to reproduce. The question is, should they be
reproduced in Scotland so that you could have them sent out from
wherever you are staying, or Should we have them.done here and shipped
to you? '

I hepe this letter will reach you safely and if you would like to
call me collect to discuss the matters I have raised I would be most
hhppy to hear from you. My number is 202-?37~2??2. All good wishes
and I hope things are going well for you.

Sincerely,

Dear friend,

From Berlin after the congress I returned to Holland,
and again travelled to Paris. I returned to Ghana only on the 27th.
October.

During my stay in Europe, I have learned a lot about animal
welfare societies, yet in Ghana and Africa as a whole I have a
long way to go. my people really do not understand the importance
of treating an animal with love. My only hOpe is that many peOple
are very sympathetic to the work I am doing now,LIL

I pray that all of you will eapert— supporthin spirit so_ that
I may one day write,tell you that animals in Ghana and other parts_
of Africa are treated with care.
