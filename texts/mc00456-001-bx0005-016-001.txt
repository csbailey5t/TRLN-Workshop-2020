A few Cases out of many hundreds treated by the P.D.S.A.

abroad 2—-

A Horse, very emaciated condition, suffering from severe
lung trouble, breathing difficult and painful. The owner,

a Moor, had slit up the nostrils “ to help it to breathe,”
he said.

A Donkey had been gored by a Bull, with the result that
it'was badly hurt and ruptured, so that the bowel trailed on
the ground—all the water passing through a hole in the bowel,
It had been working in this condition for many months.
The Donkey was destroyed immediately.

Donkeys who have had their nostrils slit to “ prevent them
from braying.“

A poor old Horse belonging to a Moor had been worked
with sores on the back until the backbone became so rotten
that pieces of bone could have been removed by the hand.
The pain was so great that it fell on its knees ‘when the
collar was put on, only to be thrashed again by its owner.

Three Donkeys with open wounds caused by owners
driving them by prodding open sores With a large packing
needle.

A Donkey bleeding profusely from large wounds. Two
on the hind leg, two inches long, six inches deep, and two
the same length on the stomach, penetrating well into the
intestines : the result of two Moors quarrelling as to who
owned the Donkey, and in their rage, slashing the Donkey
with their knives. Destroyed.

At several places where there are mills for crushing
olives, Donkeys are used for this purpose. They pull
a long pole round and round to crush the olives. These
poor brutes are blinded with a hot needle, so that they can
work better

Terribly
burnt with a
red-hot iron
on body and
legs “ to pre.
vent a cough

the coming

winter."

 

 

A Horse belonging to a very poor man in a village. The
poor animal had been so severely burnt around the hind
legs and stomach, that the P.D.S.A. Assistant took 5% pounds
of skin and cooked flesh away when dressing it. The
case was visited twice daily for some time.

The P.D.S.A. also treats Coats, Dogs and other
small Animals, as well as Birds suffering from
cruelty and neglect.

Some suffering is too diabolical to print. We speak
only of what we know and have seen ourselves.
Detailsipf such cases will be sent on application.

I have seen the souls of Animals appear
in the depths of their eyes.

I have seen the soul of an Animal reveal
itself suddenly for a moment sad as a
human soul, and search for my soul with
tenderness, supplication or terror.

I have felt a deeper pity for the souls of
Animals than for those of my Brothers,
because the Animals are incapable of
coming forth from their semi-night,uand
are without speech—Pierre Loti.

A motor car ran over this Pony’s leg four years ago. Since then
the owner has been working it at night only, to avoid detection.
It was found at 4 a.m. by the P.D.S.A. and destroyed.

We can but hope that in their death
agony, some consciousness comforts them
that at last their day of crippled feet,
festering sores, cruel blows, starvation
and. torture is over, and that they are
entering the cool green fields of peace
where they will be understood, cared for
and loved.
