I have just time to enclose 4 cases from-a Report I
have received to—day from a Technical Officer—in—Charge of
one of our Rescue Squads about his work two days ago. I
quote 4 cases only; but they give some idea of the misery
of the animals during and after a Raid.

1. ”An Alsation was trapped under a beam about 12” by
8”, which lay across his back, with the wreckage around
him. He was immovable and nobody could get near him. A
Doctor tried to give him an injection. We arrived in time
to painlessly destroy the animal."

2. ”A Cat had been under debris for four days and defied
all efforts to get it out. On the fourth day, we arrived
on the scene and succeeded in shifting the rubble, etc., and
rescuing it. Unfortunately one leg was broken, which had
turned gangrene whilst under the debris. We put it to
sleep." ’

5. "A spear of glass was embedded in a dog’s thigh.
Its owners were so occupied in salvaging the remains of
their home that they had not noticed it. The dog was in
great pain. We extracted the glass.”

4. "A little Scottie was buried under the debris of a
house. He was very vicious and no one could go near him.
With great difficulty we managed to remove some debris, but
found that the little dog was blind, owing to glass he had
received from the blast. With the owner’s consent we put
him to sleep."
