The Short, Tragic Life of
a Bull Calf

It was the night before new moon. It was as dark
as the inside of the cattle truck that stopped at
the roadside just short of Doncaster, where the
road joins the A1 to London.

Somebody threw two objects from the truck,
and drove on. At ﬁrst light a farmhand found
what the truck had jettisoned.

It was two calves, scraggy, bony—and dead.
They were not more than two days old and they
had not been fed for two days. .

In the truck, coming from somewhere around
Rotherham, their hunger had become starvation,
their fatigue turned to exhaustion and (a farmer’s
phrase) they had ‘gone down’—collapsed. Other
calves, still with the strength to bellow, had
trampled them.

Those other calves would soon be dead, too,
and hanging in bunches from hooks in some
slaughterhouse. They were born unlucky. Wrong
sex, wrong strain; dairyabreed bulls that could
make neither milkers nor beefers.

It is one of nature’s jokes that in dairy herds,
where cows are wanted, most calves are bulls.
The best they can get is sudden, painless death.

So a large trade has grown up in such unwanted
animals. It is a legitimate trade and a necessary
one, too, centred mainly on the lush pasturelands
of Herefordshire, Cumberland and Westmorland.

Usually the markets, such as those at Hereford
and Carlisle, are well conducted and most of the

Illustrated introduces the article with these words: Bull calves are odd beasts out on dairy farms. Their best prospect
is a sudden and painless death. Most of the dealers in calves are honest people engaged in a legitimate and well-
conducted business—such as the people shown in these pictures, against whom there can be no criticism. In this
investigation, writer Jack Miller was more concerned about the unscrupulous few whose eyes are on proﬁts—not
on the pain they cause. This is the story of those men—and of the RSPCA patrols who ﬁght them.

farmers and dealers in the trade run their business
with proper consideration for the young animals.
But there are also others whose only
concern is quick proﬁt and whose treat—
ment of the calves, in the little time they
have to live, worries the authorities:
callousness that comes from contempt—or
could it be the other way? The calves are
sent on two to three hundred—mile journeys
in overcrowded trucks with nothing in their
baby bellies.

The dumping of those two starvelings was a
good sign to RSPCA men who, with mounting
cooperation from the police, are hunting out
the cruelty—mongers.

A good sign because, you see, even dead calves
are worth the price of their skins—10$. to 185.

By dumping those two the truckers show that
they were beginning to fear snap inspection at
the roadside by an RSPCA Inspector.

There are still undercover transactions. A
dealer calls on a farmer—or a farmer may call in
a dealer—and a quivering, doe—eyed creature that
has not yet sucked milk changes hands for a few
shillings.

The dealer dare not put it into the market. He
knows that even when it is killed its ﬂesh may
be too young to ‘set’ and may be condemned at
the slaughterhouse . . . but let the butchery worrY
about that. He’s making his proﬁt too.

These two pictures recall the opening in the Spring of a permanent exhibition at Hanlith House, Cheddar. Mrs Desborough
Walford, Council Member (on the left of the picture), presided at the opening ceremony and introduced Mrs Wallis Power,
Vice-Chairman of the RSPCA Council, who is also shown in the picture. Mrs Wallis Power paid tribute to the generosity of
Miss Catherine Ripley. Among the numerous officials present at the opening ceremony was Mr ]. Hobhouse, Council Member

and Chairman of the Bath Branch.

The second photograph illustrates the attractive display of RSPCA pictures.
Hanlith House and its unique museum were kindly presented to the RSPCA to be used as a permanent exhibition of the

Society’s work by Miss Catherine Ripley.

 

RSPCA SEEKS INTERNATIONAL
PROTECTION FOR ANIMALS

Eightyvfour organizations in countries as wide
apart as Sweden and Bermuda, Canada and Hol—
land, India and Spain, the USA and South Africa,
Greece and Portugal, have accepted in principle
an International ‘Charter’ of animal welfare
circulated by the RSPCA.

The charter recognizes a moral obligation
that all animals should be protected from
man’s cruelty and seeks to encourage humane
education to this end. It recognizes that they
should have proper conditions of living and
travel, veterinary treatment in sickness, and,
where necessary, a painless death.

Animals slaughtered for food should ﬁrst be
rendered unconscious by mechanical means. The
claims of science, sport and entertainment should
not exempt man from the obligation to avoid
cruelty and unnecessary suffering, whether in
experimentation, training, or exhibition.

The RSPCA is now considering the calling of
an International Conference to be attended by
representatives of its Overseas Branches and of
those societies who are in favour of the adoption
of such a charter, with a View to the formation

of an international organization for animal wel'
fare. It is hoped that the formation of such an
organization will do much to promote a recog
nition of the importance of animal welfare as an
integral factor in international understanding.

 

CATS IN POSSESSION

There is something in the ownership of cats that
seems to promote observation and good writing.
The remark is prompted by a reading of My
Five Tigers, by Lloyd Alexander (published by
Cassell, 123. 6d.) The author’s feeling for cats
is plainly shared by the illustrator, Peggy Bacon,
whose numerous drawings show the same lively
and original observation as the writer’s style.

The tigers of the title are, of course, the ordinr
ary domestic cats who arrived at Mr Alexander’8
home and ﬁnally ruled it. It began when ‘Rabbit
performed the ceremony of taking possession.
The pattern was repeated by each subsequent cat.

‘It begins with hiding, preferably underneath
something. (In Rabbit’s case, a living room chair.)

his Spot becomes a general headquarters an
all operations proceed from it.’

A forest area near Frankfurt has been laviShly
equipped with more than a thousand nesting
boxes and bags. In 1953 the local bird population
was estimated to be 24 pairs per hectare at the
end of the ﬁrst year’s super’stimulation; last year
it had increased to 44 pairs, which must surely be
near the overcrowding mark. As was to be ex;
pected, predatory birds have shown a corre—
sponding increase in numbers, but the complex
as a whole seems to be healthy and stable.

Frankfurt’s municipal forest department is now
reported to be applying Pfeifer’s methods on the
grand scale, and a Dr Brunns, of the Institute of
Applied Zoology at Wurzburg, has begun similar
experiments in 28. other areas throughout the
Federal Republic. If all the projects continue
successfully, conservationists here might consider
raising funds for nesting boxes right away. It
might be cheaper than attempting to keep atomic
power station planners and other intrusive MiniSv
tries away from expensive sanctuaries and reserves.

 

The Chief Secretary, who has made‘a habit of visiting markets unofﬁcially whenever possible, writes on:

TWO ENGLISH MARKETS

The ﬁrst is now quite a small market, and, on my
last visit, it was at once apparent that, compared
With conditions I saw there some years ago, there
had been a certain improvement—thanks to the
efforts of RSPCA Inspectors. The calves were
under cover, but the market still suffers from
a serious defect—namely, that children are
able to go in and out and seem to ﬁnd a
grim pleasure in beating the animals with
sticks when the Inspector’s back is turned.
There is still talk of the market being moved to
a more suitable site, but various difﬁculties stand
in the way of this being done.

There was straw for the calves in some of the
pens, but not all, till I saw it done.

The cattle are in a part of the market that is
near to a public footpath and though there are
movable corrugated iron sheets to prevent the
animals leaping over the iron stanchions where
the lorries are unloaded, no attempt had been
made to have corrugated iron sheeting put on the
side facing the public footpath.

There is a water trough in the market, but no
cattle can possibly get to it. The trough is close
to the main road and the cattle cannot be taken
to it because there is no fencing to prevent their
escaping into the road. Water should be readily
available in the actual cattle and other pens
Attested cattle, of course, drink from buckets
specially provided for them, but the store cattle
go thirsty for long hours on end.

Shelter for the pigs is provided, but there is no

cover apart from canvas sheets stretched across
the existing iron fencing, which is roughly 3 ft.
high, instead of being raised some 6 or 7 ft. SO
as to allow the circulation of air underneath.

Some cattle come by rail, and the station is
some little distance from the market premises,
which means that the Inspector cannot both
supervise the animals in the market and keep an
eye on the unloading at the railway sidings. MOSt
of the animals, however, come in lorries and the
vehicles seen were equipped with proper‘ tail’
boards and were well ventilated. There was onlY
one farmer’s lorry there without un 1111‘
loading ramp and the sooner we have legislav
tron to make such ramps obligatory the better
for the animals concerned. There is a portable
ramp.

NO improvement can be brought about in this
market without strong pressure being put on the
local authorities because fewer animals are being
brought to it and therefore it is not a paying
Proposition. If it is to remain on its present site,
extra stanchions and rails should be ﬁtted, to
protect the animals from local children.

The RSPCA is pressing for improvements.

Pity the plight of the cock bullﬁnch in a cage too
small for him to stretch his wings! Dock leaves
are resting against the cage, as camouﬂage, and on
the ground nearby rest twigs covered with bird—
lime. The imprisoned waif is a call—bird; he has
been placed on the ground by an unscrupulous
man to attract his fellows.

Luckily for the imprisoned bird and the rest
of the wild creatures he would unwittingly have
decoyed, the police came along and the RSPCA
had the ﬁnch released and the man who had put
him in the cage was ﬁned a total of £5, as well as
being ordered to pay £3 53. costs (B.660). He had
been found guilty ﬁrst of using bird lime and
second of conﬁning a wild bird in a small cage.

A more foul use of the decoy is to brace a
wild bird, fastening string around his wings
and tethering him to the ground. His unsuSo
pecting fellows are attracted by his cries and
by his helpless ﬂutterings as he tries, whilst
his strength lasts, to free himself and soar
into the air.

Far from being exceptional, prosecutions by the
RSPCA for offences involving wild birds are only
too frequent. For the ﬁrst six months of this
year, the RSPCA prosecuted in 148 such cases.

Almost one in three convictions obtained in
magistrates’ courts by the RSPCA are taken
under the Protection of Birds Act, 1954. (The

IDEAL HOMES FOR
BIRDS

With acknowledgments to the Manchester Guardian,
in whose columns this article appeared in the early
summer of this year.

In’ Germany, ornithologists are trying to keep
down insects by increasing the population of
birds which normally feed on them. It is appar»
ently too early to say whether there has been any
appreciable diminution in the numbers of insect
pests but the birds are certainly being attracted
in thousands. This should please almost every;
body, particularly those who are properly cona

and birds for the ﬁrst six months of 1956 was
510.)

Linnets, goldﬁnches, greenﬁnches, chaﬂinches,
yellow—hammers, siskins—these are among the
birds taken by net and lime, trapped, kept in
cages too small.

Though wild birds may be ‘sold for a song’,
they will enrich the unscrupulous trapper who
may in an "afternoon trap scores. Some will die,
but what does this matter to him: he can ask
prices ranging from 103. to 50$. apiece for the
unhappy survivors. First he will slip a ring over
the shank. The law allows the sale of close—ringed
specimens bred in captivity and there is a reputv
able trade in them, although the keeping of all
birds and animals in close captivity is deplored
by the RSPCA. Innocent people may be hood;
winked into thinking they are involved in a legal
transaction, when buying a wild bird that, unbe’
known to them, has been decoyed by a braced
or caged specimen of his own kind, but RSPCA
Inspectors week by week are able to demonstrate
to magistrates that the ring on a bird’s shank is
easily removed—giving proof that the bird sold
as a close—ringed and bred in captivity was taken
and ringed as an adult. It was in this way the
RSPCA obtained most of its 148 convictions for
offences involving wild birds in the ﬁrst six
months of this year.

cerned about the side—effects of dousing the land
with insecticides.

The German bird population is being increased
by a method known to biologists as well as to
advertising agents in Britain as ‘super—stimulant’.
The bait is the ideal home———the nesting box in
the case of the bird. It has been used by nature
conservancy to extend the range of pied ﬂy;
catchers in to the West Country. Dr Sebastian
Pfeifer, of the Institute of Applied Ornithology
at the University of Frankfurt has not stated
speciﬁcally what kinds of birds he has been able
to attract, but he claims that ‘normal’ populations
of three birds per hectare (about 2% acres) have
been increased ten, ﬁfteen, and even twentyrfold

carry away the water and on the lower side of
this channel there is a concrete buffer about a
foot high, I noticed that some of the drivers
had carelessly parked their lorries so that the
tailboards were over the channel and the pro—
tecting concrete buffer, with the result that
the washings ﬂowed down amongst the stand—
ing cattle. 7

The day was dry but with the sloping gang—
ways down which the water ran many of the
animals slipped, in spite of wood chips being
put down to give them a foothold. IF IT IS
NECESSARY TO CLEANSE A CATTLE
LORRY TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF
DISEASE, WHAT IS THE SENSE OF ALLOW;
INC THE WASHINGS FROM THE LORRY
TO BE DISPERSED AMONG THE CATTLE?

In order to ‘punch’ the ears of the cattle, for
the purpose of the subsidy, the animals are
driven singly into a stockade and their heads
are ﬁxed in a sort of guillotine. This device con—
sists of two semivcircular iron castings, the lower
one being ﬁxed and the upper one mobile. The
latter is brought down to hold the neck and head
in a ﬁrm grip, so that the animals can neither
move forwards nor backwards. The lever to
produce this pressure is held in position by
being slipped into the appropriate notch of a
steel bar, 4 or 5 ft. high.

Some of the animals did not struggle, but the
majority did; their eyes watered and saliva came
out of their mouths in their terror at being
gripped in this Way. The lever to secure the
animal Was on the offside, but the near side ear
had to be punched! A particularly objectionable
feature was the way in which the animals were

made to back out of the stockade. Cattle have a
natural reluctance to walk backwards and ob
viously gangways and pens should be so arranged
as to avoid this.

The system of steel or wooden gangways or
cat~walks above the pig pens, to enable the
auctioneer to walk along when the animals are
being sold, saves a great deal of extra handling
and could well be used more generally.

At this market, too, children have free access
to the animals and help to make their lot even
more intolerable.

RSPCA Inspectors do not ﬁnish duty until the
animals are entrained at 8 or 9 p.m. As the
animals are not watered in the market and
as the railway regulations do not require
them to be fed or watered until a period of
twelve hours has elapsed, it is highly pro— '
bable that these unfortunate cattle, sheep and
pigs do not receive even a drink of water for
twenty—four hours or longer.

Cows were tied to rails in the pens with
calves at foot also tied near them with rope
halters. There was no straw and whilst this is
customary it seems a most objectionable pro—
cedure and springs from the contention of the
Auctioneers’ Institute that a buyer cannot judge
the milking qualities of a cow until she is ‘well
stocked up’. Overcrowding of pens did not occur

~ but is, I am assured, the usual practice in this

market.

Local officials are working with Headquarters
to bring about improvements, but the more one
sees of market conditions in this country, the
more keenly one feels the need for special
legislation.

The calves are loaded into lorries after the auction. The
RSPCA has patrols to check on overcrowding and suﬁ'ering

Tom Maygothling, who farms outside Here’
ford, summed up farmers who do such deals:
‘That sort of person has no feeling for anything.’

He likes to give his calves a start with their
mothers, then wean them to feeding from a
bucket after three or four days. Fred Higgs, on a
neighbouring farm, does the same.

Mind you, it can be kind sometimes if the calf
never knows its mother. Cows have gone ﬁghting
mad at losing a calf after three or four days. The
milk is no loss; ﬁrst milk contains things that
help form a calf’s stomach. . . . It would just
about poison you or me.

ay up north, too, at Carlisle, I saw the result
of the RSPCA in action. A dealer brought in a
skinny calf that could hardly stand and the
RSPCA Inspector ordered it out of the market.

The dealer said nothing, just took away the
caIf‘PrObably to be destroyed. He had specu—
lated a few bob on a quick deal and he had lost.
SO what? He had more shillings—and there are
always more calves.

ifteen other calves that day were ruled ‘not
ﬁt to travel’. The auctioneer accepted the In—
Spector’s ruling and the calves were auctioned
With that proviso. They would be slaughtered
locally.

The skimpiest of them, a sorry dun creature,
sold for 55. Others brought up to 30$.

Among the dealers at Carlisle, expertly apa
praising the calves, was a woman, Mrs Alan
Ritson, of Workington. Her husband, I was told,
would be at Cockermouth, eighteen miles away,
buying more.

Mrs Ritson had a youngster with her—a lad
of three or four—sucking at a quartervpound
stick of rock While she bid against the men.

Selling was quick; the auctioneer called bids
as fast as he could speak, and eighteen seconds
was enough to shoot the price up from £1 to £3—
and another calf was sold.

Most of these calves—‘bobbies’ they call them
—ﬁnish up as pievmeat. There were 157 in the
market that day. Mrs Ritson bought sixteen at an
average price of £2 163. 10d. An expert told me
they were ‘good average calves’.

I noticed she bought none of the weak ones
the RSPCA Inspector had said must not travel.

I noticed, too, that at lunch in the market
café, she passed up the meat pie and settled for
fish and chips. So did her driver, tough ‘Big
Scott’. So did I.

In the afternoon Big Scott fetched a double—tier
lorry for the calves Mrs Ritson had bought. In
the lorry he already had nineteen from Cocker’
mouth. He said he was off on ‘the long trip’,
which, in the calf market, means London.

Some lorries can carry 140 calves. Somebody
said it was hardly worth going three hundred

 

in the sale ring at Hereford. For calves, life is a short journey

LIVING ANIMALS IN
EXPERIMENTS

‘A reprehensible degree of carelessness’ is

reported by the Chief Inspector (Mr P. L. C.
Carrier) in a Return (dated August 2, 1956)
of experiments under the Cruelty to Animals
Act, 1876, during the year 1955. (The Report
is available, price 6d., from HM Stationery
Oﬂice.)

Irregularities quoted are:

Seven cases in which Licensees exceeded the
scope of their current certiﬁcates under the mis—
taken impression that the latter provided the
necessary cover.

There was one instance of a Licensee performv
ing experiments for which Certiﬁcate B is re—
quired, without holding this certiﬁcate.

One case was reported in which a series of
simple experiments was initiated by a Licensee
who held a Certiﬁcate A authorizing the experia
ments; the experiments were mistakenly con—
tinued by an assistant.

‘Misunderstanding’

In none of these cases (says the Report) did it
appear that there had been any deliberate inten’
tion to contravene the Act, but it was considered
by the Secretary of State that there had been
misunderstanding as well as a reprehensible degree
of carelessness, and those concerned were ada
monished and warned as to their responsibilities
under the Act.

Altogether, 2,476,201 experiments were per—
formed during the year. Experiments performed
under anaesthesia throughout totalled 33,017.
In 266,707 experiments operative procedures
were carried out under anaesthetics from the in;
ﬂuence of which, on conclusion of such pro—
cedures, animals were allowed to recover.

The number of experiments performed
without anaesthetics was 2,176,477, consti-
tuting approximately 87 per cent of all those
made during the year.

Cats, dogs, horses, asses or mules were used ,

in 12,697 experiments; 7,903 of these experiments
were performed under anaesthesia throughout
the whole period. Experiments on these animals
r6present approximately one half of one per cent
of all experiments performed during 1955.
Note: The RSPCA is opposed to all painful

eXperiments on animals.
