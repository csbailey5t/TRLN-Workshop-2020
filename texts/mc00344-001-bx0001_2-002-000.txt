lSTlZlN is a convenient, effective cathartic for the purgation of horses. It is recommended in cases 0f
constipation and impaction of the large intestine (impaction colic), gastroenteritis, laminitis, and othercon-
ditions requiring promotion of peristalsis and defecation. (Correct diagnosis is important.)

lSTlZlN usually acts within 10 to 12 hours inducing pulpy, well-formed excrements. The granules are

tasteless and odorless and are easily administered by adding to feed, or by mixing with water for intubation.

Note: This cathartic agent is eliminated as aharmless dye that colors
the urine reddish-violet to yellowish-brown depending upon pH. ‘ "

The single-dose premeasured foil pack permits accurate dosing fer
normal or extra strength laxative effect.

Packaged in boxes of 12 unit doses. (Each dose ‘/2 02. or 15 g.)

Yes. You can recommend
ALPO as a complete and
balanced diet.
Here’s why...

Every ALPO product is formulated to provide a
nutritionally complete diet for normal dogs. And we can
prove it. In the laboratory. And in the kennels. By all
acceptable nutritional standards, ALPO is shown to be
both complete and balanced. And here’s who helped
us prove it:

1. THE NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL
(NRC) OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY
OF SCIENCES.

Every ALPO variety is fortified to meet the nutrient
requirements for maintenance and growth of dogs,
as established by the NRC Committee on Animal
Nutrition.

2. THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN
FEED CONTROL OFFICIALS (AAFCO).

ALPO’s substantiation under the AAFCO Protocols,
which provide for adequate testing of nutritional
claims, shows that all ALPO products are complete
and balanced for dogs. . . for reproduction,
gestation, lactation, growth of puppies, and
maintenance of adult dogs.

3. INDEPENDENT UNIVERSITY STUDIES.

Long-term nutritional research conducted at
independent university laboratories show that
hand-feeding of fortified meat-based formulations
as the only source of nourishment over several gen-
erations provides satisfactory canine maintenance,
growth and reproduction.

4. OUR OWN KENNEL TESTS.

At the ALPO Center for Advanced Pet Study,
generations of puppies have already grown to
active, healthy maturity. Living proof of ALPO as an
exclusive diet.

 

ALPO. Doing what we can to make pet foods better.

Drop by and let us know if there’s
any way we can a351st you.

As a veterinary practitioner one frequently ﬁnds himself
in the role of nutritionist.

Whether it’s in response to a new pet owner asking
“What should I feed him?”, or the result of diagnosing
clinical signs of nutritional deﬁciency — keeping abreast
of the latest research and development concerning animal
nutrition is an important part of your practice.

While Champion Valley Farms is quite new to the field of
animal nutrition, we bring with us a considerable
knowledge of ~ food science, dietary studies, and advanced
quality production control systems through our parent
organization, Campbell 5014) Company.

While we’d like the chance to acquaint you with our
efforts toward developing highly acceptable nutritionally
adequate products, we’d like even more iiizpormm/y, the
opportunity to meet you in person, and get a better feeling
as to how we might best serve the needs of your practice

through product development and consumer education
over the coming years.

We hope that you’ll be able to set aside at least a little of
your time during the AVMA Convention and meet some
of the people behind our Recipe brand pet products.

 

 

We’ll be at booth 118-119-120.

See you there!

Mardel Memo:

 

 

7*
*—

People ask us, ”What's a
nice young pet supply outfit
like you doing at a veterinari—
an's meeting?"

Well, the reason is very
simple. We've come up with a
couple of new products that are
just tailor—made for the veteri—
narian, and we're here to talk
about them:

Bonocin, the liquid bandage
for dogs. It brushes on easily,
and dries rapidly to a durable
network of nylon fibers allowing
for normal tissue respiration.

Marnodor—Plus, the odor
destroyer. Composed of freeze—
dried bacteria in tablet form,
it mixes into a water solution
for convenient spray applica—
tion. And there's never been
anything like it for controlling
odor where animals are handled
and kept.

We have lots more to tell
you about these two new prod-
ucts, as well as some other
irons we have in the fire. StOp
by our booth and register, we
will be happy to forward you
some samples to try.

SECTION ON LARGE ANIMALS

(1) Mineral Interrelationships in
Ovine Nutrition

A. L. Pope. PhD

Madison, Wisconsin

It is not the objective of this presentation to dwell on

3*. the voluminous research data that indicate the rather

precise requirements, metabolic functions, and classic de-
ﬁciency symptoms of sheep mineral nutrition. Rather, the
0bjectives are to review only the most recent research on
mineral interrelationships, such as calcium-phosphorus,
selenium-sulfur, and copper-molybdenum. Current prob-
lems with mineral nutrition in sheep production and sug-
gested methods of improvement will be presented.

(2) Copper Intoxication in Sheep

Ralph Farnsworth. DVM. MS: Scott Eustis. DVM:
R. E. Werdin. DVM. PhD; C. M. Stowe. VMD. PhD
St Paul, Minnesota

Several episodes of cumulative copper poisoning in
sheep, characterized by icterohemoglobinuria, occurred in
Minnesota as a result of excessive intake of dietary copper.
Efforts at treatment utilized ammonium molybdate, but
excessive doses increased the losses. D-penicillamine was
used orally and parenterally to mobilize copper from the
body and facilitate its excretion in a chelated form. The
result of copper analysis, histopathologic examination, and
the effects of molybdate and D-penicillamine therapy will
be discussed, including changes in blood copper, cerulo-
plasmin, liver enzymes, blood urea nitrogen, clearance
gests, and suggested values for precrisis diagnosis of the
isease.

(3) Urolithiasis in Feedlot Lambs

Robert H. Udall. DVM. PhD
Fort Collins, Colorado

The control of urinary calculi in feedlot lambs can best
beFaHiGd Out with a plan of action to be instituted when
It IS SuSpected that an occurrence is imminent. This con-
cept has been shown to have a high probability of success
When there is prospect for a change of weather when
th‘? lambs are on a high-concentrate ration. The general
Drlncip1es that seem most effective in controlling the occur-
Fence 0f calculi are to increase the intake of .chlorldes by

e use Of SOdium or ammonium chloride, whlch increases
he excretion of chloride in the urine and increases the
SOlubﬂity 0f magnesium. Intake of any supplements that
tend to increase the excretion of ammonium 1011 are con-
tralndiGated. Provision of adequate, potable water supply
8 0““ be made. Struvite calculi (magnesium ammomurg
phosphate) are the most frequent calculi 1n sheep an
00m.“ when the pH tends toward the alkaline s1de due to

(5) Role of Silages, Additives, and Less
Common Feed Substances in
Ovine Nutrition

A. L. Pope. PhD
Madison, Wisconsin

“No domestic or wild animals are capable of existing
on more different feeds than sheep. Weeds, grasses,
shrubs, roots, cereals, leaves, barks, and even in times of
scarcity, ﬁsh, meats, dead animals all furnish subsistence
to this wonderful animal.” So wrote Killebrew in 1880.

Today, there are more options open to sheep producers
than at any time in the past to use different feeds and
feeding systems commensurate with maximum net re-
turns. Ewe feeding can be simpliﬁed and mechanized by
bulking the diet to save labor. More ewes can be carried
per acre of corn through silage than with any other type
of management. Other silages, cornstalks, and corncobs,
as well as industrial by-products can be used, but each
presents advantages and disadvantages that will be
discussed.

(6) Lymphedema in the Horse
Gustave E. Fackelman. DVM. Dr med vet. MA

Kennett Square, Pennsylvania

Lymphedema refers to an accumulation of extracellular
fluid within the peripheral lymph vascular system. Any
increase in the production of interstitial ﬂuid or any
decrease in its rate of transport within the lymphatics
will result in such an accumulation.

Increased production results from an increase in the
effective ﬁltration pressure (EFP) of the blood capillaries.
A rise in venous pressure may actively increase EFF,
whereas hYpoproteinemia, by decreasing resorption at the
03131113}? level may cause a similar increase in EFP.

I (7A) Virus-Induced Respiratory Diseases
2 of Horses

A. E. McChesney. DVM. PhD.
and Leroy Coggins. DVM. PhD

Fort Collins, Colorado, and Ithaca, New York

Equine herpesvirusn adenovirus, inﬂuenza virus, para-
inﬂuenza virus, and rh1nov1rus commonly induce respira-
tory diseases in horses; other viruses less commonly in-
duce respiratory disease.

The pathogenesis of respiratory disease is inﬂuenced
by virus characteristics including: virulence, favored site
of replication, and Slte of initial infection. Anatomic fea-
tures of horses’ lungs that affect the disease pathogenesis
include the branching pattern of the bronchi, the blood
supply to the lungs, the structure of the respiratory
bronchiole, and the arrangement of alveoli. Properties of
the host that affect the disease course include host sus-
ceptibility, surface and circulating antibody, the level of
immunologic competence of the individual, and the amount
and quality of mucus in the respiratory tract.

 

E (78) Equine Respiratory Viruses

Leroy Coggins. DVM. PhD. and
Mathias J. Kem-en. Jr.. DVM. MS
Ithaca, New York

The principle viruses causing respiratory illness in the
horse will be discussed. These include equine inﬂuenza,
equine rhinopneumonitis, and equine adenovirus. The
basic characteristics of ,these viruses as well as the epizo-
T’ otiologic factors associated with these infections will be
considered. Serologic studies have indicated that these 3
viruses are enzootic among the equine population. Clinical
epizootics of equine inﬂuenza caused by both types of
equine inﬂuenza (Equi A1 and Equi A2) are common in
gI‘OIIps of assembled horses. There appears to be no
signiﬁcant antigenic variation of the equine inﬂuenza
viruses as yet and the presently available commercial vac-
cines appear to be effective when used properly.

Ames, Iowa

Fifteen sows with agalactia from 6 herds and 8 nor-
mally lactating sows from 3 herds were necropsied 18 to
48 hours postpartum. Macroscopic lesions of mastitis were
observed in 7 of the agalactic and 2 of the clinically
normal sows. Principal organisms isolated from mastitic
mammary glands were Escherichia coli and Klebsiella sp.
Analyses will be presented of the relationship between
total somatic cell counts, total bacterial counts and pH of
milk, macroscopic and microscopic glandular changes, and
bacteria isolated from each mammary gland.

In a second study, clinical, clinical chemical, and micro-
biologic observations were made on 3 sows with coliform
mastitis and 3 normally lactating sows at 4 intervals post-
partum. Sows with mastitis evidenced fever, leukopenia,
and low plasma protein ﬁbrinogen ratios.

(11) Serologic Diagnosis of
Eperythrozoonosis in Swine

A. R. Smith. DVM, PhD

Urbana, Illinois

Diagnosis of eperythrozoon infections has been based
upon the demonstration of Eperythrozoon in blood ﬁlms
and upon herd and individual history. Since the majority
of mfections are subclinical, direct identiﬁcation of the
organlsm is diﬂ‘icult. Therefore, a hemagglutination test
was developed. The test consists of glutaraldehyde at-
tachment of partially puriﬁed eperythrozoon antigen to
sheep erythrocytes. The test was evaluated, using eXPeTl'
mental laboratory infections. Swine samples arising from
the University of Illinois swine preventive medicine Pro"
gram have also been tested. The test appears to be reliable

and dependable in identifying herds which are latently
infected With Eperythrozoon.

(13) Application of the Complement-
Fixation Test to the Control of Mycoplasmal
Pneumonia in Swine

William P. Switzer. DVM. PhD' and
Kenneth 5. Preston. DVM

Ames, Iowa

Following the development of the complement-ﬁxation
(CF) test for the speCIﬁc diagnosis of mycoplasmal pneu-
monia in swine, trials have been conducted whereby sero-
negative sows were identiﬁed in diseased breeding herds
and removed to isolated quarters where they produced
mycoplasmal pneumonia-free pigs. Thirty-four such sows
produced 34 mycoplasmal pneumonia-free litters.

For the past several months, ﬁeld trials have been
underway with the cooperation of several midwest swine
producers to determine if it is feasible to control and
eradicate the disease in an infected herd, using the CF
test as a diagnostic tool to identify infected swine in the
breeding herd. The seronegative breeding swine are used
to continue production in the herd. Management prac-
tices are instituted to avoid reinfection of the pigs pro-
duced by the seronegative breeding herd. The results are
encouraging to date.

James W. Dunn, DVM, MS; Richard E. Coupe. BS;
Michael G. Daharsh. BS; Kenneth C. Olson. BS;
Norman R. Underdahl. MS: Marvin J. Twiehaus. DVM. MS

Lincoln, Nebraska

Diagnosis of atrophic rhinitis (AR) should be based on
several criteria. Slaughter checks over the past 10 years
revealed approximately 6% of over 27,000 Nebraska
speciﬁc-pathogen-free (SPF) swine and 16% of over 9,000
primarily non-SPF swine had measurements of 6 mm or
more space in the nasal passages or nasal septum devia-
tion, or both. Although lesions in non-SPF swine were
more severe, the incidence in both types of herds varied
annually and seasonally. Effects of etiologic and other
known factors should be considered in making an accurate
diagnosis.

Anaerobic lagoons are an efﬁcient method of disposmg
0f SWine wastes. Often the efﬁciency of these systems can
e increased by recycling efﬂuent in conjunctlon WIth
gutter-ﬂush systems. Pigs from a closed herd w1th no
history of salmonellosis or swine dysentery were exposed
to Efﬂuent from an anaerobic lagoon on a farm where salmo-

Neurologic examination must be carrled out systematically
and observations critically evaluated. A worklng knowledge
of neuroanatomy and neurophysiology “should enable One
to interpret the observations and .predlct which areas of

Richard C. Dillman. DVM, PhD

Ames, Iowa

The laboratory procedures required for the differenti-
ation of some of the more common diseases affecting the
bovine central nervous system (CNS) will be illustrated
and discussed. Emphasis will be placed on the proper
use of gross and microscopic examinations, along with
clinical pathology, as they apply to diseases of the bovine
CNS. The correlation and interpretation of the results will
be described. In addition, the limitations of certain labora-
tory procedures will be examined. Speciﬁc diseases in-

meningoencephalomyelitis, listeriosis, and rabies.

(18) Value of Necropsy in Accurate
Diagnosis of Neurologic Disease

L. Tryphonas. DVM. PhD

Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada

Accurate diagnosis of neurologic disease can be made
ante- or postmortem. For an antemortem diagnosis,
methodic clinical examination and appropriate clinico-
pathologic assays are essential. Although a certain num-
ber of neurologic diseases can be diagnosed with these two
approaches, at the present state of our knowledge necropsy
remains the sole answer to accurate diagnosis for the
majority of such diseases. Practical as well as more
sophisticated techniques useful in pre- and postﬁxation
examination of the nervous system will be illustrated.
Basic criteria for recognition, analysis, and diagnosis of
gross pathologic lesions will be presented.

(21) Toxic Materials and Neurologic Disease
William 3. Buck. MS, DVM

Ames, Iowa

Certain chemicals that are ubiquitous to our environ-
ment are used as pesticides or therapeutic agents or are
considered to be nutrients or nutrient substitutes, but
may under certain conditions contribute to neurologic
disease. Chemicals having primary toxic effects upon the
bovine nervous system include various forms of lead, syn-
thetic organic insecticides, nitrofurans, mercury, urea,
salt, and certain toxic gases such as carbon monoxide,
carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulﬁde.

The clinical aspects of neurologic disease associated
with exposure to toxic levels of these chemicals will be
discussed. The neurologic syndromes produced by each
of these toxicants must be differentiated not only from
each other, but also from other neurologic syndromes
such as polioencephalomalacia, infectious thromboembolic
meningoencephalitis, brain abscesses, nervous forms of
coccidiosis and acetonemia, rabies, hypomagnesemia, and
soybean overload.

WhiCh is often affected is the heels. A pronounced 1m-
alance of the heels results in the creation of an abnormal
Shearing force. The total effect is often a typlcal heel

A noninvasive method for measuring arterial blood
pressure was compared to simultaneous intraarterial blood
pressure measurements in order to establish its credibility.
Accuracy of the indirect measurements was established
during general anesthesia as each horse was arbitrarily
adjusted to hypotensive, normotensive, and hypertensive
states. Horses in a separate experimental group were

common causes of lameness such as fracture of the third
phalanx, fracture of the extensor process, pedal osteitis,
laminitis, navicular disease, and traumatic arthritis of the
distal interphalangeal joint will be presented. The man-

agement and surgical treatment of these conditions will

My. treatment of certain cases of bowed tendon in the
horse IS accomplished by placing a strip of fascia sulf-
cutaneously alongside the affected tendon. The fascia IS
excised from the gluteal region.

The fascia is transplanted 10 days after application 0f
the Ashelm technique which consists of a series of punc—
tures into the tendon along its length.

.Postoperative care consists of 30 days of stall fie-St,
daily SWlmming for 6 weeks, and about 2 months’ exerCISe
1n paddocks.

In the 20 seriously affected horses treated by this aP‘

(30) Animal Models of Human
Hematologic Disease

R. M. Bannerman. DM. FRCP
Buffalo, New York

A variety of hematologic disorders determined by single
gene mutations are now under investigation in laboratory
and domestic animals. More than 19 types of hereditary
anemia are known, and will be used to exemplify experi-
mental approaches to hematologic models. Some of the
animal mutants are di-rect analogues of human disorders,
others have no direct analogy but may be valuable models
of general pathologic processes. All provide valuable tools
for new understanding of individual steps in normal
hematopoiesis and its regulation. In View of the genetic
conservatism of mammals, deliberate search for analogies
is worthwhile. Any new mutant discovered deserves care-
ful study and an effort to maintain the gene in the stock.

(32) Pyruvate Kinase Hemolytic Anemia
in the Basenii

Russell V. Brown, PhD

Richmond, Virginia

Hemolytic anemia due to deﬁciency in erythrocyte
pyruvate kinase has been widely reported in the Basenji.
Genetic studies indicate the hemolytic anemia is autosomal
recessive. The enzyme defect is a codominant since non-
anemic carriers of the defect can be detected. Of 200
Basenjis tested in 1972, 18% were carriers. Testing and
elimination of carriers from breeding is reducing the
incidence. Hemolytic pups can be detected at 8 weeks,
or earlier, by packed cell volumes and hemoglobin values
60 to 70% of normal and 10- to 20-fold increase in
reticulocytes. Red blood cell half-life is greatly shortened.
Adenosine triphosphate reduces cell fragility in vitro.

(33) Gray Collie Syndrome (Cyclic
Neutropenia)

N. F. Cheville. DVM, PhD

Ames, Iowa

The gray Collie syndrome is a lethal hereditary disease
associated with abnormal hair pigmentation, cyclic de-
pression of circulating neutrophilic leukocytes, enteric
disease, and bilateral scleral ectasia. Neutrophils disappear
from the circulating blood at 10- to 11-day intervals and
are accompanied by episodes of fever, diarrhea, gingivitis,
respiratory tract infection, lymphadenitis, and lameness.
Most affected dogs die within a few days of birth, yet
some survive only to succumb in early adulthood. Their
life-span is lengthened if they are given supportive clinical
treatment. Even then, they eventually develop lymphoid
exhaustion, persistent monocytosis, and amyloidosis. The
defect causing the cyclic disappearance of neutrophils has
been corrected by bone marrow transplantation.

(35) Inherited Hemorrhagic Disorders

W. Jean Dodds. DVM
Albany, New York

It has been recognized for over 30 years that inherited
hemorrhagic conditions similar to hemophilia and its
allied disorders in man could occur in animals. Most of
these diseases have been described in dogs, but they also
have occurred in horses, cattle, goats, swine, and rats.
Although the X-linked recessive traits, hemophilia A and
B (Christmas disease), are the most commonly encoun-
tered hereditary bleeding diseases, several autosomal bleed-
1ng dlsorders have been described. These include VOn
Willebrand’s disease; factors VII, X, and XI deﬁciencies;

thrombasthenia; thrombocytopathy; hypoﬁbrinogenemia;
and aﬁbrlnogenemia.

(39) Pharmacologic Control of Estrus in
Small Domestic Animals

James H. Sokolowski. DVM, PhD

Kalamazoo, Michigan

Compounds will be discussed Which have been used
in attempts to prevent, suppress, or inhibit estrous activity
in the bitch. Based on the literature, progestogenes With-
out exception can cause endometrial proliferation, endo-
metritis, mucometra, or pyometra. The injudicious use
of progestogens without proper selection of subjects and
without explaining the potential of problems to the client
is questionable.

The compound mibolerone, a nonprogestational steroid
which is in clinical testing now, may offer the efﬁcacious,
safe, and economic estrous inhibition that we have been
looking for for many years.

Thomas J. Burke. DVM. and
Harry A. Reynolds. VMD. PhD

Urbana, Illinois

Megestrol acetate (6-methyl-A6-17—a-acetoxy proges-
terone) is a potent orally effective progestogen that is
rapidly eliminated from the body.

Two regimens of treatment were used for estrus con-
trol in the bitch: I mg/lb (0.45 kg) /day for 8 days begin-
ning in early proestrus and 0.25 mg/0.45 kg/day for 32
days beginning in late anestrus. In addition, 19 bitches
were given 0.25 mg/O.45 kg/day for 32 days regardless of
their estrous cycle status for posttreatment breeding studies.

Results of 389 bitches given the 8-day and 120 given
the 32-day treatment will be presented. Data from the
19 posttreatment litters will also be presented.

Testicular, thyroidal, and adrenal activities were mea-
sured in male Beagles immunized against bovine lute-
IHIZing hormone for 15 or 52 weeks. Circulating antibodies
were associated with atrophy of the testes, epididymides,
and prostate gland. The effects of immunization were
apparent by high levels of antibodies and reproductive
dysfunction for as long as a year in 3 of 4 dOgS- The
thyroid and adrenal glands were not detectably affected.
A single dose of human chorionic gonadotropin stimulated
antlbodies which failed to cross-react with canine gonado-
troplns or to cause reproductive failure in immunized
dogs. A single dose of ovine gonadotropins stimulated
antlbodles which were associated with ejaculatory failure
for more than 20 weeks.

(44) Nutrition of Dogs During Changing
Stages of Life

B. E. ShetFy. PhD
Ithaca, New York

Most dog owners ﬁrmly believe that there can be no
standard diet suitable for optimum nutrition of dogs of
various ages under all conditions of life. As a result,
blending of commercial diets and direct supplementation
of commercial dog foods is a common practice in the ﬁeld.

The pet food industry is beginning to respond to these
needs by producing foods speciﬁcally for growth, re-
production, or for all physiologic functions.

In his role of professional advisor on animal health
and productivity, the veterinarian frequently is required
to counsel dog breeders and owners on meeting nutritional
needs. Such discussions require fairly speciﬁc knowledge
of nutritional requirements. This report will deal with
changing nutritional needs of dogs during life and the
use of commercial foods to meet these needs.

and other special dietary products.

The role of dietary protein in the development of renal

(50) Cervical Spondylopathy: Wobbler
Syndrome in Dogs

Robert R. Selcer. DVM. and John E. Oliver. DVM. PhD
West Lafayette, Indiana

Cervical spondylopathy is a disease entity commonly
involving the Great Dane; however, other breeds have
manifested the syndrome.

Although many theories have been proposed as to the
cause of this disease, there is a strong suggestion that
genetics may play an important part.

The most consistent clinical signs are those due to
proprioceptive deﬁcits. These include hypermetric gait,
rear limb incoordination, a broad-based stance, and wear-
ing away of the toenails.

Diagnosis depends on neurologic examination and
cervical myelography. Radiographic ﬁndings consist of
stenosis of the spinal canal, exostosis around the articular
facets, subluxation of the vertebrae, and hypertrophy 0f
the ligamentum ﬂavum. Any one or any combination of
these abnormalities may be seen in a particular dog. The
treatment of choice, in our experience, has been decom-
pressive dorsal laminectomy.

(54) Immunology of Cancer

Arthur I. Hurvil’z. DVM. PhD
New York, New York

The ﬁeld of immunology has been an area of great
excitement during the past decade and a half. Improved
understanding of the newer concepts of the basic elements
of immune response will be described, especially as these
relate to determining the body’s ability to attack neo-
plastic cells. Abnormal antigens are known to develop on
the surface of many cancer cells and these cells may be
rejected in the same manner as organ tissue transplants.
Thus, the immune system has a role in protecting the
body against neoplasia. Modiﬁcation of host immuno-
surveillance system can inﬂuence the incidence and out-
come of neoplastic processes.

The diagnosis of cancer can be a most difﬁcult task.
It begins with an analysis of the species, age, breed, and
sex of the patient. History and physical examination, 1n-
cluding direct observation and palpation, are the hall-
marks of arriving at a deﬁnitive diagnosis.

In order to carry out adequate therapy, the extent of
disease must be determined. Radiographic techniques, both

Go from Here?

Frederick W. Clayton. DVMI MPH. MS
Bethesda, Maryland

The continuing merger dialogue between representa-
tives of the American Board of Veterinary Public Health
and emerging American College of Veterinary Preventive
Medicine has stimulated renewed interest in specialization.

The history of specialty boards, beginning in 1915,
will be reviewed to provide a perspective for current
negotiations. The development of the “umbrella concept”
by the American Board of Preventive Medicine is par-
ticularly relevant.

The formation of the American Board of Medical
Specialties heralded a basic change toward a strong cen-
tral organization with a full-time staff and reduced the

autonomy of the member boards. The relevance of this
change will be discussed.

(65) Closed Environmental System
Toxicology

Vernon L. Carter. Jr.. DVMI MS
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

The closed environmental system presents a unique
problem to the toxicologist. This system, as utilized in
spacecraft and underwater vehlcles, must employ an en-
vironmental control system (ECS) to remove toxic atmos-
pheric contaminants, since the leak rates are negligible,
The hazard associated with contaminant buildup due to
the limited atmospheric space, overheating, and the limita-
tions and possible failure of the ECS is ever present.

In order to minimize the major sources of contaminant
buildup, a nonmetallic materials selection program is em-
ployed, anticipating both nominal operation and overheat-
ing situations. Exposure of candidate materials to opera-
tional temperatures and pressures with qualitative and
quantitative analysis of the offgassing products is neces-
sary to eliminate those which would contribute excessively
to the atmospheric toxicant load. In addition, the pyrol-
ysis toxicity of those heat-resistant materials used in
areas where the highest probability of thermal stress exists
should be investigated. These pyrolysis studies have both
basic and applied uses.

The exposure by inhalation of animals and man to low
molecular weight ﬂuoroalkanes such as CBI‘Fa, CBrClF2,
and CCle2 has been demonstrated to result in a variety
of effects on the central nervous and cardiovascular systems.

A concentration-dependent decrement in myocardial
performance was found to be independent of the avail-
ability of metabolic substrates and adrenergic function.
The performance decrement was determined to be the
consequence of a decrease in the myocardial uptake of
oxygen. Coronary venous oxygen content was elevated

and coronary arterial blood ﬂow was decreased in propor-
tlon to a contractility decrease.

(68) Species Pitferences: The Missing
Relationship In Understanding Health
Effects of Environmental Chemicals

Frederick W. Oehm-el DVM. PhD

Manhattan, Kansas

Species with-similar chemical, metabolic, and excretory
pathways exhibit s1m1lar effects when exposed to poten-
tially poisonous chemicals. Such compounds may be found
in the daily env1ronment as components of feeds or foods
prophylactic or therapeutic medications, waters and air,
in industrial env1ronments, and on common environmental
surfaces. Understanding species differences in biotransfor-
mation capabilities is of the utmost importance in labora-
tory and clinical evaluations of environmental hazards and
in transposing toxicologic information from laboratory re-
sults to practical situations involving domestic animals and
man. It is the role of the comparative scientist to clarify
the physiologic and biochemical variations between an-
imals and to document suitable laboratory models for the
various detoxiﬁcation schemes and clinical syndromes as-
sociated with domestic animal and human toxicoses. Only
by understanding and expecting speciﬁc species variations
can abundant laboratory information be accurately and re-
alistically applied to potential hazards or clinical toxicities.

by Immunotluorescent Staining of Skin

Donald C. Blenden, DVM. MS

Columbia, Missouri

Several strains of rabies virus inoculated by various
routes into laboratory mice can be identiﬁed in neural
elements of the skin. Frozen sections of skin of the head
region, particularly the muzzle or cross sections of ear,
are stained with FITC-labeled anti-rabies globulin and
Evans blue counterstain.

All of 30 artiﬁcially induced cases and 5 natural ter-
minal cases in dogs have demonstrated virus in sections
of skin of muzzle or facial sensory papillae. The skin of
1 dOg was found positive on day of onset. Reﬁnement of
the technique may reliably detect early rabies in dogs, as
in mice. -

Muzzle skin of 3 cattle with conﬁrmed rabies was
easily determined to be positive, as was 1 case in. a.cat.
Skin specimens from 5 rhesus monkeys with art1ﬁc1ally
induced rabies were found to be positive on day of onset,
as Well as late in the course of illness. . _

These investigations are continuing on SpeCIGS impor-

Honolulu, Hawaii, and Ames, Iowa

Sections of lung and adjacent lymph nodes were col-
lected at necropsy from each of 3 axis deer killed on
Molokai Island, Hawaii. Tuberculous lesions were ob-
served grossly only in the lungs and mediastinal lymph
nodes. However, in 1 deer a ﬁstula was noticed in the
ventral abdominal wall. Since lesions were not seen in
the abdominal visceral organs, it appeared that the d1-
aphragm had been eroded by the thoracic lesions.

The histopathologic appearance of the lesions was that
of an infectious granuloma with varying numbers of in-
ﬂammatory cells, including multinucleated giant cells.
Connective tissue formation and cellular necrosis were
observed.

The isolates were identiﬁed by growth and biochemic
features, including sensitivity to 10 Mg thiophen-2-carbox-
ylic acid hydrazide as M ycobacterium bovis.

The presence of tuberculosis in these wild deer is of
public health signiﬁcance and a potential danger to other
animals.

Trenton, New Jersey

Since 1959, New Jersey has documented 289 conﬁrmed
equine cases and 50 human cases of eastern encephalo-
myelitis (EE). During the summer of 1968 alone, 115
equine cases were diagnosed in addition to 12 human cases
of EE. Viruses of both EE and western encephalomyelitis
(WE) have been isolated from birds, mosquitoes, and other
species, but WE has not been detected in either human be-
ings or horses in New Jersey. Following the occurrence
of Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE) in Texas
in the summer of 1971, a massive campaign of equine vac-
cination, using live attenuated VEE vaccine (TC 83) was
carried out in Texas and in some 20 other states, extend-
ing northward to include New Jersey. Since that cam-
paign and subsequent use of the vaccine in New Jersey,S

James L. Fowler. DVM. MS

Presidio of San Francisco, California

A large volume of valuable microbiologic data on food
is generated annually by Department of Defense labora-
tory facilities. These data have potential applications in
public health, particularly in the development of micro-
biologic criteria. A Centralized Computerized Microbio-
logical Data Collection system, with 11 participating lab-
oratories, was designed and implemented by the US Army
Medical Research and Nutrition Laboratory, Denver, CO.
Selected data from analysis of the 1972 ﬁle will be pre-

(76) Recent Trends in Salmonellosis
Epidemiology

Marshall D. Fox. DVM. MS
Atlanta, Georgia

The number of reported salmonella isolations from hu-
man beings in the United States in 1973 exceeded 26,000
for the second consecutive year, continuing the gradual
upward trend apparent since 1969. One serotype, Salmon-
ella agona, accounted for a major portion of this increase.
Studies in the United States and other countries suggest
that S agona was originally introduced via Peruvian ﬁsh-
meal and has become sequentially disseminated through
domestic livestock and human populations, afﬁrmining the
importance of the feed-animal cycle in human salmonel-
losis. Pet turtle-associated salmonellosis continues as. a
public health problem despite federal regulations effective
since December, 1972.

m0n problem in animals; it is a less frequent, but still s1g-

Leptospires of the serogroup pomona have been iso-
lated from aborted California sea lion pups with multiple
hemorrhagic lesions. Limited evidence indicates that the
sea lion leptospires are zoonotic. Virus isolates from
aborted sea lion pups and from aborted adult females have
been shown to infect domestic swine and to be indistin-
guishable from vesicular exanthema virus of swine. Anti-
bodies to these viruses are present in California sea lions,
northern fur seals, gray whales, and feral swine on Santa

(79) Import Quarantine Regulations: Do
They Meet Our Needs?

Richard L. Parker. DVM. MPH
Atlanta, Georgia

Animal quarantine regulations of the Public Health
Service are designed to prevent introduction of zoonotic
diseases. They have been promulgated over the years and
tend to deal with speciﬁc diseases such as rabies, psitta-
cosis, and salmonellosis. They are generally applied by
nonveterinarians; however, veterinary consultation is read-
ily available by telephone.

The traveling public generally cooperates with the reg-
ulations. Veterinarians need current information in order
to correctly advise their clients regarding animal import
requirements.

Regulations in effect, their reason for existing, and po-
tential changes will be discussed.

(80) Salmonellosis: A Current Animal
Environmental Health Problem

Erskine V. Morse. DVM. PhD, and Margo A. Duncan
Lafayette, Indiana

Salmonellosis represents a major and continuing global
threat as a zoonotic disease. Intensiﬁed and concentrated
rearing of livestock have compounded the problem in the
Unrted States and northern Europe. Environmental, as
well as psychological, stresses play a deﬁnite role in the
hosts’ resistance to the infection. Contamination of foodS
durlng processing and preparation favors interhost trans-
fer. Indiscriminate antimicrobial therapy may, to Son?"
degree, compound and further complicate difﬁculties 1n
the control of salmonellosis. The ubiquitousness of salmon-
ella; the host range of the agents; widespread reservou‘s
1n nature; impact of environmental stresses; marked sus-
ceptlbllity 0f the young, aged, and debilitated; and the
questlonable efﬁcacy of therapies indicate that eradicatlon
of salmonellosis in food-producing animals will be difﬁcu1t
and probably impossible.

(83) State Animal Health Programs:
Protection. and Conservation

Robert C. Hammond. VMD. and Hugh E. Binks, DVM
College Park and Laurel, Maryland

The philosophy of state and federal regulatory animal
health programs regarding disease is: if possible, keep it
out; if it gains access, eradicate; if eradication is impos-
sible, control.

The success of this policy can be measured in the rela-
tively low level of animal disease in the United States and
the high consumption of meat by the average American.

Americans are protected from contracting infections
from animals and animal products. Such human patho-
gens as M ycoplasma bovis that previously caused serious
levels of illness due to such pathogens as Brucella abortus
have been signiﬁcantly reduced.

Conservation of high-quality animal protein is an
equally important beneﬁt. There are still vast areas of
the world where the single greatest deterrents to any kind
0f development or progress are the tremendous losses oc-
casioned by animal disease.

(85) Hog Cholera: Where We Are and
What We Must Do

J. C. J-eﬁeries. DVM
Hyattsville, Maryland

After almost 14 years of effort by veterinarians, State
and federal regulatory agencies, the swine industry, and
many others, a long-held dream is near reality—the com-
plete eradication of hog cholera from the Unlted States.

As we approach this goal, we must exert every effort
to assure ourselves the disease is in fact eradicated or to
locate the last bit of virus if it is still here.

The efforts of all individuals and organizations that
have carried us this far continue to be needed, perhaps
now more than ever, at this critical period.

(86) Bluetongue: Problems in Diagnosis
and Incidence Measurement

Hugh E. Mei-calf. DVM. MPH. and
Albert J. Luedke. DVM. MS

Denver, Colorado

Evidence shows that bluetongue probably occurs in
all species of ruminants, both domestic and wild. Each of
these ruminants varies in clinical, pathologic, and epi-
zootiologic features of the disease. Each species presents
unique problems in diagnosis and yet each probably con-
tributes to the overall incidence of bluetongue infection.
Laboratory diagnostic problems are caused by fastidious-
ness of some strains of the virus and coexistence of virus,
in close association with erythrocytes, and speciﬁc circulat-
ing antibody. Serologic diagnosis is complicated by dif-
ﬁculty in interpretation of results. Problems in incidence
measurement are due to a compounding of the diﬂiculties
of diagnosis with generally inadequate reporting inherent
in many of our disease reporting systems.

Considerable research and diagnostic data have been
developed on bluetongue and are available for use when
considering measures to provide safety in regard to move-
ments of cattle, semen, and ova. Improved serologic tests
and viral isolation techniques are of particular signiﬁcance.
The greater understanding of bluetongue disease and the
testing and handling procedures which strengthen safety
elements should enable the countries concerned to develop
satisfactory certiﬁcation requirements. Certiﬁcation re-
qulrements for the international movement of cattle, se-
men, and ova must be developed through discussions and

agreements between the exporting and importing countries
involved.

Programs Adequately Handle the
Emergency?

Richard E. Omohundro. DVM
Hyattsville, Maryland

The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service
was reorganized on Nov 1, 1971, to include a separate
Emergency Programs Organization within its Veterinary
Services.

The International Operations Staff is charged with:
(1) training personnel outside the continental United
States, (2) maintaining worldwide surveillance of livestock
and poultry diseases exotic to the United States, and (3)
cooperating with other governments to provide technical
expertise to their disease control and eradication programs.

The Technical Support Staff is charged with develop-
ing and maintaining up to date, all information available
on livestock and poultry diseases exotic to the United States
into a date bank system for planning purposes. In addi-
tion, they are required to develop and maintain up-to-date
operational plans to control or eradicate livestock and
poultry diseases exotic to the United States. Technical
Support furnish staff support to ﬁeld eradication programs
when they are declared a national emergency.

The National Emergency Field Operations Staff is re-
sponsible for selecting, training, and conducting periodic
“test exercises” for 5 Regional Emergency Animal Disease
Eradication Organizations (READEO’s). The READEO’s are
activated, as needed, when the Secretary of Agriculture
declares a national emergency, and are under the “line”
direction of the National Emergency Field Operations
Staff.

The Emergency Programs Information Center (EPIC
room) has been constructed, equipped, and is operational.
The EPIC room is located at Hyattsville, MD, and has re-
placed the old “ready room” located in the hayloft of a
deserted dairy barn in Beltsville, MD. The EPIC room is
an ultramodern nerve center which contains all of the
elements necessary to furnish the staff support for and to
maintain operational control over one or more major epi-
zootics of exotic diseases of livestock or poultry, or both,
which might gain entry into the United States.

of the disease and lack of experience by clinICIanS and

hes in diagnosis. The latter is particularly Significant 1n

inoculation, chickens were examined for lesions histologic-
ally and by palpation. Up to 50% of line 6 chickens de-
veloped incidence tumors but most of the tumors regressed,
since only 8% died and 13% had lesions by 26 weeks,
The mechanism of regression will be discussed.

(92) A Phenotypic Mixing Test for the

William Okazaki. PhD;
H. Graham Purchase. BCSc. MRCVS. PhD;

Phenotypic mixing (PM) occurs when leukosis viruses
of subgroups A, B, C, or D are cocultivated with Rous
sarcoma virus of subgroup E. When assayed on cells ge-
netically resistant to subgroup E viruses, only the pheno-
typically mixed virus will induce a transformed focus.
Using this principle, a standard test system (PM test) was
developed for the detection of leukosis viruses. It was as
sensitive as and shorter than the standard complement-
ﬁxation test and on ﬁeld-type materials (embryos, plasmas,
and blood) gave comparable or better results.

(94) Efficacy of Lyophilized Turkey
Herpeswrus Vaccine Against Marek’s
Disease in Broilers

Caswell S. Eidson, PhD, and
Stanley H. Kl-even, DVM. PhD

Athens, Georgia

Two sources of lyophilized turkey herpesvirus vaccine
and a single source of cell-associated turkey herpesvirus
(HVT) vaccine were evaluated for control of Marek’s dis-
ease (MD) in broﬂers. The chicks used were hatched from
dams vaccinated at 1 day of age with the cell-associated
HVT vaccine. Approximately 2,000,000 chicks were vac-
cinated at 1 day of age with either cell-associated or cell-
free HVT vaccine. There were 5 doses of cell-free HVT vac-
cine, ranging from 500 to 3,000 plaque-forming units (PFU)
and 3 doses of cell-associated HVT, ranging from 500 to
1,000 PFU per bird. There were no unvaccinated controls
used in this study since the purpose was to determine
whether the cell-free HVT vaccine would be as effective
in reducing the incidence of MD lesions in broilers as the
cell-associated HVT vaccine.

All groups were processed at approximately 8 weeks
of age and in one study there was no difference in the in-
cidence of MD lesions in birds vaccinated with either 500,
750, or 1,000 PFU of the lyophilized or cell-associated HVT
vaccines. In a second study, birds given 1,000 PFU of the
lyophilized HVT vaccine had fewer MD lesions than birds
given 1,000 PFU of the cell-associated vaccine. However,
there were only 40,000 birds per treatment. It was con-
cluded from this study that the lyophilized HVT vaccine
was as effective as the cell-associated HVT vaccine in re-
ducing the incidence of MD lesions in broilers.

Age-related resistance to Marek’s disease (MD) is ex-
pressed through lesion regression. The role of humoral'
immunity in this type of resistance was studied by render-
ing chickens deﬁcient in bursa-dependent functions by cy-
Clophosphamide treatment and comparing their ability to
regress MD lesions with that of untreated hatchmates. At
the time of virus challenge, the chickens were 9 weeks of
age, were free from prior infection, and the cyclophospha-
mide-treated group had severely impaired bursa functions
but intact thymus functions. The lack of antibody produc-
tion had little effect on the ability of cyclophosphamide-
treated chickens to regress MD lesions.

appeared from the birds, which was conﬁrmed by negative
virus recovery attempts. When .day-old P- and N-line
progeny of J M-V- and HVT—vaccmated dams as well as
control chicks were naturally exposed to heavy concentra-
tions of J M virus for 8 weeks, recovery of virus at weekly
intervals from kidneys from each of the 3 groups of prog-
eny indicated a marked repression of J M virus infection
by J M-V maternal antibodies for the ﬁrst 5 weeks as com-
pared with that of progeny from HVT and control dams.
Although viremic levels of all 3 groups were approximately
the same at the end of the 8-week period, repression of
viremia for the ﬁrst 5 weeks by the J M-V maternal anti-
bodies drastically reduced Marek’s disease lesions at the
end of the 8-week trial period.

Formation in Hamster Cell Cultures
Inoculated with Cell-Associated Marek’s
Disease Virus and Turkey Herpesvirus

R. L. Witter, DVM. PhD. and
J. M. Sharma. BVSc. PhD

East Lansing, Michigan

Viral infection persisted for up to 10 serial passages
in primary hamster kidney (HK) cultures inoculated with
cell-associated Marek’s disease virus (MDV) or turkey
herpesvirus (HVT). However, infection was solely associ-
ated with inoculum-derived avian cells, as shown by the
persistence of inoculum cells beyond the disappearance of
infectivity during serial passage, the ablation of infectivity
by treatment with cytotoxic anti-avian cell antibody, and
the failure to infect HK cultures with high doses of cell-
free MDV or HVT. Heterokaryons, some of which contained
viral antigens, were observed in virus-containing mixed
hamster-avian cell cultures, but the role of these cells in
viral replication was uncertain. It is concluded that HK
cells do not support persistent infection with, and are
probably refractory to, the strains of MDV and HVT used
in these studies.

bronchitis virus (BV) and their immunity was cross-chal-
lenged with 8 different ﬁeld strains of IBV. The virus
recovery method was used to evaluate immunity. One-
and 4-week-old chickens were vaccinated ocularly with
both Holland strains, and respiratory reaction was eval-
uated by gross observation and histopathologic examination.

Ethylenediaminetetraacetate upon
Newcastle Disease Virus Production

Arturo Vallejo. DVM. and Benjamin Lucio. DVM. MS
Mexico City, Mexico

La Sota strain of Newcastle disease virus was inocu-
lated into the allantoic sac of 9- to 11-day-old embryos,
harvested 48 hours later, and titrated.

When the virus was diluted with nutrient broth, titers
of harvested ﬂuids were in the range of 10“ to 109.5
median embryo infective doses per milliliter.

The addition of ethylenediaminetetraacetate at levels
of 0.218 mM in the embryo increased the virus titer to
1010.3 to 1010'5 median embryo infective doses per milliliter.

. When M8304 was added to the inoculum, an increase
1n t1ter was not found.

(107) Interference of Marek’s Disease
Immunity Following Simultaneous
Application of Marek’s Disease and
Fowlpox Vaccines

R. F. Gentry. DVM. PhD
University Park, Pennsylvania

Vaccination of day-old chicks with a mixtureof fowlpox
and Marek’s disease (MD) vaccines resulted in a marked
decrease in resistance to MD virus. Immunity to fOWlpox
was reduced in birds given MD virus compared with those
given only pox Vll‘uS. The degree of interference varied
with the route of application and type of fowlpox vaccine
employed as well as the kind of birds (leghorns or broilers)
used in the test. The use of combination fowlpox-MD
vaccine would result in increased MD mortality or con-
demnations, or both.

(108) Adenovirus Infections from the
VieWpoint of the Diagnostician

R. W. Wintertield. DVM; A. M. Fadly. DVM. MS:
A. M. Gallinal DVM. PhD

West Lafayette, Indiana, and Urbana, Illinois

Avian adenovirus infections in chickens in the United
States have not in the past been associated with the
incitement of disease. During the past 3 years, however,
we have isolated adenoviruses which are responsible for
clinical entities varying in signs and lesions. These isolates
have been the cause of respiratory signs, hepatitis, anemia,
intramuscular hemorrhages, and adverse reproductive per-
formance. A differential diagnosis of the diseases caused
by adenoviruses should be made, since diseases of a dif-
ferent etiology are also encountered that are similar
clinically and pathologically. Isolation and identiﬁcation
of the virus is important, but it should be emphasized
that many adenovirus isolates are not pathogenic. There-
fore, actual virus infection in a ﬂock should be correlated
with the history, signs, and gross and histopathologic
observations. Whereas isolates of the virus may share
common antigens (e.g., by the agar gel precipitin test),
they may differ on virus-serum-neutralization assay.
Furthermore, the speciﬁc manifestations of disease may
differ with the respective adenovirus isolate studied.
Workers in Europe and Australia have also conﬁrmed
the presence of pathogenic adenoviruses in chickens durlng
the past few years. Thus, the avian diagnostlman should
recognize problems which may be associated With these
infections in this country.

Fecal or gut tissue samples were collected from chickens
of Various ages and tested for the presence of adenov1ruses
and for adeno-associated viruses. In about 40% . of the
125 tissue samples tested, an infectious agent was isolated
in t1lbe cultures of chicken embryo kidney cells. In ap-
p.roXimately 40% of the adeno isolates, an adeno-assoc1ated
erus Was identified, using a complement-ﬁxation antigen
1nduction procedure. The adeno and adeno-assomated
VirUS isolates as well as known adeno stralns were clas-
Siﬂed serologically. The adenoviruses were placed 1n 8
istinct groups, whereas the associated .v1rus Isolates all
appeared to be members of one serologlc group.

(110) Isolation and Identification of
Infectious Anemia Virus

George Stein. Jr.. MS. DVM. and Carol R. -Wills. BS
Salisbury, Maryland

The hemorrhagic syndrome and aplastic anemia are
variations of the same disease complex known as infectious
anemia. An adenovirus isolated from livers of birds with
infectious anemia is capable of inducing anemia in sus-
ceptible chickens. The virus is lethal to 5- to 8-day-old
chicken embryos originating from susceptible or unexposed
parent stock. The embryos usually die 3 to 10 days after
being inoculated in the yolk sac with liver tissue from
chickens with ﬁeld cases of infectious anemia. Embryonic
lesions are dwarﬁng and congestion. Macroscopic embryo
liver lesions are observed in a small percentage of embryos
dying after 15 days of incubation.

Greenport, New York

Suspensions of tissues from dead ducks in California
suspected of having duck virus enteritis of (DVE) were
inoculated in 9-day-old embryonating duck embryos and
1-week-old ducklings. Mortality did not occur in duck
embryos. Ducklings remained clinically normal for 21 days
postinoculation (DPI), but developed DVE antibodies. At
10 DPI, half of the embryos were examined, and those
inoculated with 1 of 4 ﬁeld specimens had faint petechia-
tion of body and liver. Electron micrographs of the livers
revealed a herpesvirus which (reacted with DVE ferritin—
tagged DVE antiserum. Tissue suspensions from these
embryos were lethal to duck embryos and ducklings.
These ﬁndings suggest use of multiple methods for con-
ﬁrmation of DVE.

Two-week-old gnotobiotic chicks were inoculated in the
foot pad with viruses isolated from the synovia, the res-
piratory tract, or the digestive tract. Antibodies were
determined by agar gel precipitin (AGP) test and plaque-
reduction test.

All inoculated chicks developed inﬂammatory changes
in the synovium and synovia. When viruses were plaqued
in primary chick kidney cells, either small (0.75 to 1.5 mm)
or large (2.5 to 4.5 mm in diameter) plaques were pro-
duced. Serum from virus-infected chicks showed a common
precipitin line by the AGP test. On the basis of the plaque-
reduction test, the Viruses were classiﬁed into 4 major
serotypes.

An experiment was designed to study the effects of
single and concurrent infections of M ycoplasma synoviae
(MS) and avian inﬂuenza A virus (AIV). Poults were im-
munity challenged at 4 weeks of age. Signs of sneezing,
coughing, and gaping were evident in poults immunity
challenged with AIV and AIV + MS groups 7 days postchal-
lenge. In the same groups, sinusitis was observed 12 days
postchallenge, whereas in the MS group, enlarged sinuses
were not observed until the turkeys were 10 weeks of age.
There was a signiﬁcantly higher percentage of mortality
in AIV + MS and AIV-challenged groups, 18.5 and 15.0%,
as compared with MS and control groups, with 1.6 and
2.0%, respectively. Gross lesions of uniformly thickened
and opaque air sacs, caseous casts in sinuses and trachea,
and formation of diphtheritic membranes within trachea
and bronchi were prominent lesions in dead poults. Total
condemnations at the processing plant (including culls)
were 9.8% in AIV + MS, 6.6% in AIV, 6.7% in Ms groups,
and 2.5% in control group. Common ﬁndings in culled
birds included runtiness, lameness, synovitis, and enlarge-
ment of bones making up the tibiometatarsal joint.

The signiﬁcance of these results, along with observa-
tions on weight gain, feed conversion, serologic data, and
histologic changes, will be reported and discussed.

were infected at 1 day of age and the same number in an-
other group were infected at 4 weeks of age. Two groups

whereas the microantiglobulin test was far superior to all
other tests in detecting infected birds.

(120) Evaluation of Certain Antibiotics
in Relation to the Carrier State of
Erysipelothrix rhusiOpathiae (insidiosa)
in Turkeys

R. E. Corstvet..PhD. and Cheryl Howard. BS
Stillwater, Oklahoma

The factors that affect the carrier state of Erysipelo-
thrix rhusiopathiae (insidiosa) in the turkey are not
known. Our experimental designs have shown a number
of environmental factors that apparently do not inﬂuence
the carrier state. The only consistent ﬁnding was that
the systemic or intestinal carrier state may result if the
number of organisms per milliliter of blood does not
surpass 10“. In this way, antibiotic therapy may contrib-
ute to the production of the carrier state. Various anti-
biotics and combinations of antibiotics were compared as
to their efﬁcacy in contributing to the carrier state. The
low carrier rate of E rhusiopathiae (insidiosa) that was
produced experimentally made it difﬁcult to interpret the
efficacy of the antibiotics. However, penicillin appeared
to be the most effective in aiding the host in the elimina-
tion of E rhusiopathiae (insidiosa).

(121) Etiology of Ulcerative Enteritis
(Quail Disease)

German A. Berkhoiil‘l DVM. PhD
West Lafayette, Indiana

Using strict anaerobic culture techniques, 17'strains
0f the causative bacterium of ulcerative enterltls were
studied in detail. The organism was identiﬁed as a Clos-
tridium. . .

It appears that these strains form a. group distlnct
from the other species of the genus Clostrldlum. They are
pathogenic and in view of the fact that bobwhlte quall
(Colinus virginianus) seem to be the most susceptible
hosts under natural and experimental condltions of mfec-
ti0n, the name of Clostridium colinum is suggested to des-
ignate this species. Three cultures representlng th1s spe-
cies have been deposited with the Amerlcan Type Culture
Collection (ATCC 27769, 27770, and 27771).

chicken and mouse tissues did not induce immunity against
the different immunogenic type of P, multocida. The
chicken and turkey embryo bacterins did not induce cross-
immunity in mice, but they did induce homologous immu-
nity. These studies show the cross-immunity induced in
the turkeys was host speciﬁc because the antigen responsi-
ble for cross-immunity was produced only when P multo-
cida was grown in embryonating turkey eggs.

(123) Failure of Anticoccidial Protection
During Adverse Climatic Conditions

W. Malcolm Reid. PhD. DSc
Athens, Georgia

Diagnostic laboratories are sometimes asked to investi-
gate “breaks” in which anticoccidials fail to prevent coc-
cidiosis. Some such failures have been attributed to spells
of hot humid weather, resulting in reduced feed intake
and reduced medication levels. Decreases in feed intake
varied from 9 to 68% 24 hours after birds were shifted
from a cool to a hot environment in experiments involving
‘ 5 anticoccidials and unmedicated controls. In a single ex-
periment involving a temperature difference of 21 degrees
(C) occurring 1 day postinoculation with Eimeria tenella,
signiﬁcant increases in lesion scores in the hot environ-
ment showed partial failure due to insufﬁcient anticoccidial
intake.

A 3 X 2 X 2 factorial arrangement of treatments involv-
ing 3 concentrations of monensin (O, 90, and 110 g/ton), 2
strains of birds (Hubbard and Cobb), and 2 total sulfur
amino acid (TSAA) feeding concentrations (7% below and
7% above NRC requirement) was used to study the inter-
relationships of different treatments on feathering. Each
of the 12 treatments was replicated with 5 ﬂoor pens with
50 females and 50 males each. Monensin concentrations
had no effect on feathering, but a strain difference was
evident at 28 days and the higher concentration of TSAA
signiﬁcantly and progressively improved feathering at 42,
49, and 56 days of age.

todes in laying hens.

In broilers, the anthelmintic efﬁcacy was 100% for the
roundworm and cecal worm and 91% for the intestinal
threadworm, based on worm burdens of treated versus
nontreated birds.

In laying hens, the anthelmintic efﬁcacy was 97% for
the roundworm and 99% for the cecal worm, based on
worm counts at necropsy. Fecal egg counts were reduced
correspondingly in the treated group.

Pullman, Washington

A familial and progressive form of epilepsy which re-
sembles LaFora’s disease of man has been identiﬁed in
Beagle dogs. Epileptic seizures, beginning as early as 5
months of age, are precipitated by altering light and sound
intensity. Histologically, intracytoplasmic accumulation of
PAS-positive material resembling LaFora bodies are found
in the central nervous system and other tissues, including
peripheral nerve, liver, spleen, and lymph nodes. Intracy-
toplasmic inclusions form in glial cells and neurons in the
central nervous system, especially the thalamus. The
spherical inclusions have a dense core with a ﬁbrillar radi-
ating periphery, and range from 2 to 10 ,Lb in diameter.

(131) Models of Diabetes and Obesity

Charles E. Hun’rI DVM. PhD;

Steven U. Walkley. BS

Birmingham, Alabama

Diabetes mellitus in man still presents many unsolved
problems, even 50 years after the discovery of insulin.
Affected individuals have increased susceptibility to infec-
tion and cardiovascular disease and reduced life expec-
tancy. Adult onset diabetes often is associated with obesity.

Diabetes has been reported in nonhuman primates, the
dolphin, dog, cat, horse, cow, sheep, house mouse, spiny
mouse, Chinese hamster, Egyptian sand rat, and guinea
pig. In order to be most useful in the study of a human
disease, an animal model should be consistently susceptible
to the disease and have analogous biochemical and morpho-
logic alterations in tissues. Among the diseases observed to
date in the species listed, only those in the house mouse,
Chinese hamster, sand rat, and spiny mouse come close
to fulﬁlling these criteria. Several strains of inbred mice
have proved useful as models for studying diabetes and
obesity, because the modes of inheritance have been de-
ﬁned and these animals are small, easily managed rodents.
This presentation will focus on biochemical and tissue le-
sions observed in the mouse models, including discussion
of a new strain of mouse which develops severe obesity in
adulthood.

is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Activities of
muscle enzymes in serum, including creatine phosphokinase,
aldolase, and glutamic oxalacetic transaminase, are elevated
in affected mink as compared with control mink. Histo-
pathologic changes in affected mink include variation in
muscle ﬁber diameter, size, degeneration of muscle ﬁbers,
and proliferation and centralization of sarcolemmal nude}

(133) Model for Skeletal Resist
Vitamin D in Renal Failu:ence to

Steven E. WeisbrodeI VMD. PhD' and
Charles C. CapenI DVM. PhD

Columbus, Ohio

Chronic renal disease in man and animals is associated
with disturbances in calcium homeostasis which often are
resistant to Vitamin D therapy. Partially nephrectomized
and intact'rats. were used to evaluate the effect of uremia
on hyperv1tam1nosis D. Serum calcium, phosphorus and
blood urea nitrogen were higher in uremic rats than in
intact rats both given vitamin D. Metaphyseal bone in
uremic rats was resistant to vitamin D-induced bone re—
sorption; osteoblasts and osteocytes appeared less active
ultrastructurally and osteoclasts were infrequent. Cal-
citonin synthesis and release from C-cells, as evaluated
by electron microscopy, was greater in uremic rats. It is
suggested that the altered response of bone to vitamin D
in uremic rats is due to elevated serum phosphorus and
increased calcitonin release. The partially nephrectomized
rat may be a useful model for evaluating end organ re-
sistance in uremia.

When ethanol was administered as part of a nutri-

imals maintained or gained weight and liver morphology
was normal in the controls, whereas isocaloric substitution
of carbohydrate (36 to 50% of total calories) by ethanol
resulted in the production of fatty liver in all animals,
with striking triglyceride accumulation and enhanced
activities of microsomal drug detoxifying enzymes, in-
cluding the microsomal ethanol oxidizing system. In-
ebriation and manifestation of dependence upon with-
drawal of the diet were observed, including an 80% in-
cidence of audiogenic seizures in rats treated for 2 to 4
weeks. Some baboons also developed alcoholic hepatitis
and cirrhosis, with increased activities of serum glutamic
oxalacetic transaminase.

associated with their use. The impact of stress and t It:
physiologic changes of each agent are of concern to {etac
of these groups when evaluating tissue changes resu mg
from the euthanatizing process.

The agents to be mentioned are:

carbon monoxide, chloroform, diethyl-ether, halothane,
hypoxia, and nitrogen.

A motion picture will be shown to relate the physiology
of hypoxia of aircraft pilots to the digniﬁed and humane
death experienced by animals subjected to hypoxia in a
high altitude-low pressure cabinet environment.

The reasons for the use of physical methods of eutha-
nasia will be correlated with physiologic and pathologic
responses of the animal being killed. Relative aesthetics,
humane considerations, and operation standards will be
compared.

(139) A Survey of Common Lesions in
Aged, Spontaneously Diabetic
Guinea Pigs

Edwin J. Andrews, VMD. PhD; C. Max Lang. DVM:
Bryce L. Munger. MD

Hershey, Pennsylvania

Since 1969, we have maintained an outbred colony of
guinea pigs which have a high incidence of spontaneous
mature-onset diabetes mellitus. In over 100 guinea pigs
which have died and been necropsied, a wide variety of
lesions have been found. Lesions similar to those in human
diabetics include ﬁbrosis of the pancreatic islets of Langer-
hans, severe hepatic fatty degeneration, glomerulosclerosis,
and cataract formation. Other lesions are peculiar to the
guinea pigs and do not generally occur in man. These in-
clude a high incidence of fatty replacement of the exocrine
pancreas, marked pancreatic islet cell hyperplasia, fatty
degeneration of the adrenal cortex, ovarian follicular cystic
degeneration, occasional hypothyroidism, metastatic calci-
ﬁcation, and dystrophic osteogenesis. The gross and histo-
pathologic ﬁndings will be discussed with regard to similar-
ities and differences seen in human diabetics. (Supported

(140) Cardiovascular Depressant Effects
of Aminoglycoside Antibiotics in
Nonhuman Primates

H. Richard Adams. DVM. PhD

Dallas, Texas

HemOdYnamic effects of aminoglycoside antibiotics
(neomycin-streptomycin group) were examined in several
species of nonhuman primates: rhesus (M acaca mulatta),
squirrel (Saimiri sciureus), and owl monkeys (Aotus
trivirgatus) and dog-faced baboons (Papio cynocephalus)-
In closed-thorax pentobarbital-anesthetized primates, the
intravenous administration of neomycin, streptomycm,
dihydrostreptomycin, kanamycin, and gentamicin produced
varying degrees of hypotension and bradycardia in all
primate species studied. Cardiovascular depressant effects
0f neomycin were subsequently examined in more detail in
open-thorax artiﬁcially respired baboons by continuously
momtoring systemic blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR),
cardiac output (00), left ventricular contractile force
(LVQF), and the maximum rate of rise of LVCF (dF/dt)
during pentobarbital anesthesia. Intravenous administra-
tlon of therapeutic and greater-than-therapeutic dose levels
(14 to 56 mg/kg) of neomycin produced a dose-related
depression of cardiovascular function as evidenced by a
decrease in BP. HR, co, LVCF, and peak dF/dt. Maximum

(141) The Circulatory Effects of the
Addition of N20 to Halothane in
the Stump-Tailed Monkey

Eugene P. StefFey. VMD. PhD:
J. R. Gillespie. DVM. PhD;
J. Berry. BS: E. l. Eg‘er. ll. MD

Davis and San Francisco, California

We studied the circulatory effects of 4 alveolar doses
of halothane-N2O-02 in 6 healthy, unpremedicated, 5-year-
old, male stump-tailed monkeys (Macaca arctoides) dur-
ing conditions of controlled and spontaneous breathing.

We found that, like halothane-02, halothane-N200.»
produces dose-dependent cardiovascular depression. How-
ever, the addition of N20 to halothane results in signif-
icantly (P<0.05) less depression than equipotent doses
of halothane alone in mean systemic arterial pressure,
mean pulmonary artery pressure, heart rate, cardiac out-
put, stroke volume, and left ventricular work during con-
trolled breathing, and cardiac output, stroke volume, and
left ventricular work during spontaneous breathing.

 

(I42) Repeated Ketamine Anesthesia
in the Chimpanzee

U. S. Grant Kuhn. lll. DVM, and
Robert J. Arko. DVM

Atlanta, Georgia

Incident to a venereal disease research project requmng
frequent examination and manipulation of the experlmental
SUbjects, 1,079 anesthetic episodes were produced w1th

etamine in 25 chimpanzees over a period of 28 months.

Within a 5-month period the frequency of anesthetic
episodes in 11 chimpanzees ranged between 5.6 and 82/
month. Untoward results were minimal. Deaths attrlbuta-
ble to the anesthetic agent were not experlenced, nor was
any evidence of change in tolerance observed In expen-
mental chimpanzees.

(144) Carbon Monoxide Euthanasia:
Chamber Concentrations Using
Automobile Engine Exhaust for

Euthanasia of Dogs

A. F. Moreland. DVM

Gainesville, Florida

Although destruction of animals is less than exciting to
practitioners of the healing art, veterinarians are fre-
quently called upon to perform or advise about euthanasia
of animals. Use of CO for mass euthanasia of dogs has
been approved by the AVMA Panel on Euthanasia, with
the recommendation that more research be conducted re-
garding its use.

Measurement of exact concentrations of CO and other
exhaust gas components in a euthanasia chamber utilizing
automobile engine exhaust has been impractical in the
past. This study has utilized an infrared spectrophoto-
metric device calibrated to accurately sample CO concen-
trations between 0 to 10%. Concentrations of nitric oxides
and hydrocarbons were also measured. Description of the
construction and operating details of the euthanasia
chamber as used for mass euthanasia of dogs will be
presented. Correlations with regard to CO concentration
and time of onset of unconsciousness and death will be
g1ven.

We’ve beefed it up. . .

 

SILINICARE® N

is the best

you can prescribe
for nephritis

Why? Because Clinicare N contains
readily usable, high-quality protein from
beef, casein, and whole dried eggs. The low
level of high biological value protein (6%)
results in minimal protein excretion.

Added carbohydrates supply readily
available energy for reduced protein
catabolism.

All vitamins and minerals are optimally
balanced to compensate for reduced
absorption with age.

The high level of polyunsaturates from
pure vegetable oil aids in the treatment of
skin problems associated with kidney
conditions.

And the low moisture content (70.0%)
gives high nutrient levels and a highly
palatable consistency and texture.

What it all adds up to is the best
therapeutic/long-term maintenance diet you
can prescribe for nephritis, dermatoses and
geriatric cases. New, improved Clinicare N

from Agway.

House Authorizes Panel Study
On Feline/Human Leukemia

Prompted by the current confusion over
the relationship of feline leukemia to
human leukemia, the AVMA House of
Delegates, July 21, in Denver, adopted,
with minor changes, Resolution No. 7,
authorizing the Council on Research to
immediately appoint a panel up to seven
members to consider the problem. The
House authorized the panel to recommend
specific laboratory techniques that would
serve as a standard testing procedure for
reliable results from all laboratories con-
ducting the indirect immunofluorescent
test for feline leukemia virus infection.
Compounding the confusion about the
problem has been the reporting of dif-
ferent results by different laboratories
conducting the test for the same samples.

The resolution assigns the panel to
consider the disposition of test-positive
and clinically affected cats and the use
and significance of the indirect immuno-
fluorescent test for detection of feline
leukemia virus. The panel is requested to
report to the Council on Research at its
first meeting in 1975.

Resolutions AdOpted

No. 1 proposed that "No Smoking”
sections be provided in the larger audi-
torium and meeting halls of the national
convention and that no smoking be per-
mitted during sessions held in the smaller

 

Dallas To Host
1978 AVMA Convention

Dallas, TX, was selected, Sunday, July
21, by the House of Delegates, as the site
for the 1978 AVMA annual meeting. The
invitation was issued by the Texas VMA.
The last time the AVMA met in Dallas
was in 1967.

Invitations to host the 1978 meeting
were also received from the Minnesota

Cincinnati, OH — July 19-22, 1976
Atlanta, GA—July 11-14, 1977
Dallas, TX — July 17-20, 1978

meeting rooms. The resolution was adopt-
ed with the understanding that the pro-
vision concerning no,_smoking be limited
strictly to the sﬁientific sessions at the
annual convention. . .

No. 2 proppsecb; that AVMA use its
influence to stimulate the development by
federal governmental agencies such as
USDA, DOD, HEW, and AID of pro-
grams encouraging the ultilization at every
oppotunity of US. veterinarians in inter-
national programs such as those sponsored
by the Food and Agriculture Orangization
and World Health Organization of the
United Nations and the Pan-American
Health Organization.

No. 6 was an invitation from the Texas
VMA to hold the 1978 AVMA annual
meeting in the state of Texas, specifically
in Dallas.

Resolutions Not Adopted

No. 4 was an invitation from the Min-
nesota VMA to hold the 1978 AVMA

AVMA Honors USDA Secretary
and Wisconsin Parasitologist

US. Department of Agriculture Sec-
retary Earl L. Butz and Dr. A. C. Todd,
University of Wisconsin parasitologist,
will receive the AVMA Appreciation
Plaques for 1974. The plaques, which
replace the traditional honorary member-
ship designations, recognize non-members
of AVMA who have contributed distin-
guished service to veterinary medicine.
This is the first year the plaques have
been awarded.

Dr. Butz

Secretary Butz, early in his career, was
on the staff of Purdue University, moving
up from instructor to professor and head
of the Department of Agricultural Eco-
nomics. In 1954, he left the university to
become Assistant Secretary of Agriculture
under President Eisenhower. In 1957, he
returned to Purdue as dean of the School
of Agriculture. He served in this capacity
for 10 years, then became vice president
and dean of continuing education. During
these years he was instrumental in estab-
lishing the School of Veterinary Medicine
at Purdue. In 1971, he was appointed by
President Nixon to serve as Secretary of
Agriculture.

In his present position, Dr. Butz has
played an important role in supporting
the work carried on by the emergency
programs staff of Veterinary Services,
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Ser-
vice. In 1972 and 1973, emergency pro‘
grams were required for exotic Newcastle
disease in southern California and for
hog cholera and Venezuelan equine en-
cephalomyelitis. As plans develop to com-
plete the Pan American highway, linking
Central and South America, the need for
strong foot-and-mouth disease controls
becomes imperative. With Dr. Butz’s sup-
port, negotiations are under way with six
Latin American countries to prevent the
northward spread of the disease.

He has also taken a vital interest in
eradicating brucellosis from livestock and
in the cooperative screwworm eradication
program in the Southwest, begun in 1962.
He was instrumental in redirecting funds

vet-kem
announces
the “one-dip”
tick collar

Another innovation from Vet-Kem! A new but tried-and-proven tick collar
that makes one dip last and last.

 

 

 

Vet-Kem’s new tick collar is the one that will end pet-owner complaints
about collars that work only on a dog’s neck.

Its continuous action kills ticks over the entire dog within hours.
From the dog’s nose. To the tip of his tail. Even between the toes.

Larvae. Nymphs. Adults.

Dip the dog once in Kem-Dip. Then fit it with a Vet-
Kem Tick Collar to prevent reinfestations of fleas
and ticks. '

    
   
  
 

From then on, simply dispense new collars from
time to time to maintain healthier dogs and happier
clients.

For technical information and a free
sample, see your Vet-Kem distribu-
tor representative.
Or write to us.

It really kills ticks

Mardel Memo;

 

 

 

PeOple ask us, "What's a
nice young pet supply outfit
like you doing at a veterinari—
an's meeting?"

Well, the reason is very
simple. We've come up with a
couple of new products that are
just tailor—made for the veteri—
narian, and we're here to talk
about them:

Bonocin, the liquid bandage
for dogs. It brushes on easily,
and dries rapidly to a durable
network of nylon fibers allowing
for normal tissue respiration.

Marnodor—Plus, the odor
destroyer. Composed of freeze—
dried bacteria in tablet form,
it mixes into a water solution
for convenient spray applica—
tion. And there's never been
anything like it for controlling
odor where animals are handled
and kept.

We have lots more to tell
you about these two new prod—
ucts, as well as some other
irons we have in the fire. Stop
by our booth and register, we
will be happy to forward you
some samples to try.

Drop by and let us know if there’s
any way we can assist you.

As a veterinary practitioner one frequently ﬁnds himself
in the role of nutritionist.

Whether it’s in response to a new pet owner asking
”What should I feed him?”, or the result of diagnosing
clinical signs of nutritional deﬁciency —— keeping abreast
of the latest research and development concerning animal
nutrition is an important part of your practice.

While Champion Valley Farms is quite new to the ﬁeld of
animal nutrition, we bring with us a considerable
knowledge of - food science, dietary studies, and advanced
quality production control systems through our parent
organization, Campbell Soup Company.

While we’d like the chance to acquaint you with our
efforts toward developing highly acceptable nutritionally
adequate products, we’d like even more importantly, the
opportunity to meet you in person, and get a better feeling
as to how we might best serve the needs of your practice
through product development and consumer education
over the coming years.

We hope that you’ll be able to set aside at least a little of
your time during the AVMA Convention and meet some
of the people behind our Recipe brand pet products.

We’ll be at booth 118-119-120.

See you there!

Dr. Spangler Elected to 12th
Term as AVMA Treasurer

Dr. Don H. Spangler (KSU ’31),
Lacy, WA, was elected to his 12th term
as treasurer of AVMA, July 17, by the
AVMA Executive Board, meeting in
Denver, CO. As treasurer, he is also a

    

Dr. Don Spangler
member of the Executive Board, to which
he was first elected in 1960 as representa-
tive of District VI. He served as Board
chairman for two terms.

In 1965, he was elected president of
AVMA and continued to serve as both
treasurer and president during that year.
He has been active in the organizational
aspects of veterinary medicine during most
of his professional life. Before serving on
the national level, Dr. Spangler was pres-
ident of the Central Minnesota VMA for
two terms and president of the Minne-
sota VMA in 1954. He was a member
of the state association’s executive board
for 3 years.

Now retired, Dr. Spangler conducted a
general practice in Atwater, MN, for 25
years before becoming supervisor of the
Animal Industry Division of the Wash-
ington State Department of Agriculture,
Olympia, WA. He served in this position
until 1969. Dr. Spangler began his vet-
erinary career in Campbell, NE, where
he conducted a mixed practice for several
years. In 1934, he joined Norden Labora-
tories and served as a branch manager in
Minnesota. In 1940, he moved to Atwater
and returned to private practice.

The Minnesota VMA honored Dr.
Spangler in 1965 with its "Veterinarian
of the Year” award. In 1966, his alma
mater, Kansas State University, presented
him with its Distinguished Service Award.

 

Smoking Ban In Section
Meetings

“No Smoking” signs will again be
posted in all rooms where the seven
official scientific sections are holding
sessions this week. The recommendation
by the AVMA Committee on Scientific
Program was first imposed last year for
the health, safety, and comfort of every-
one attending the section pro-grams. It is
hoped that the same commendable re-
sponse will be made to the ban this year
as was made in Philadelphia last year.

 




Visit AVMA Professional
Liability Insurance Booth

The word ”veterinary” comes from the
Latin "veterinarius" meaning of or per-
taining to beasts of burden or draft.
”Malpractice” combines the French "mal"
meaning evil and the Medieval Latin
"practicare." The word ”insurance” de-
rives from the Middle English ”ensuren.”
But ”veterinary malpractice insurance”
may be all Greek to you— unless you
get a translator. Visit the AVMA Pro-
fessional Liability Insurance Trust booth
618 where Miss Gaylee Rich and Dr.
Dinsmore speak the language of the vet-
erinarian and the insurance underwriter.

 

MESSAGE CENTER

The Mountain Bell Telephone Com-
pany will maintain a Message Center
in the Convention Complex Monday,
July 22, through Thursday, July 25. If
any veterinarian wishes to provide a
way for his home office to reach him,
he may give them the telephone num-
ber of the Message Center (303, 825-
6388). Messages will be posted on a
board at the MC and veterinarians may
check here for messages.

 

 

 

Student AVMA Participates in Autotutorial Exhibits

Miss Jane Meier, chairperson of the Student AVMA (SAVMA) Autotutorial Advisory
Board, and Philip Roudebush, SAVMA president, are shown in an autotutorial booth at
the Purdue School of Veterinary Medicine, where they are senior students. The Student
AVMA is interested in encouraging and recognizing quality autotutorial programs and
will participate in the 1974 autotutorial exhibit by offering “appreciation” awards for
outstanding contributions. Self-study and more individualized instruction, using audio-
tapes, slides, Videocassettes, and movies, are being used more widely in veterinary
colleges today. The autotutorial exhibit came into being because most of these learning
units are effective for the continuing education of the graduate veterinarian.

Yes. You can recommend
ALPO as a complete and
balanced diet.
Here’s why...

Every ALPO product is formulated to provide a
nutritionally complete diet for normal dogs. And we can
prove it. In the laboratory. And in the kennels. By all
acceptable nutritional standards, ALPO is shown to be
both complete and balanced. And her'e’s who helped
us prove it:

'I . THE NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL
(NRC) OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY
OF SCIENCES.

Every ALPO variety is fortified to meet the nutrient
requirements for maintenance and growth of dogs,
as established by the NRC Committee on Animal
Nutrition.

THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN
FEED CONTROL OFFICIALS (AAFCO).

ALPO’s substantiation under the AAFCO Protocols,
which provide for adequate testing of nutritional
claims, shows that all ALPO products are complete
and balanced for dogs . . . for reproduction,
gestation, lactation, growth of puppies, and
maintenance of adult dogs.

Outgoing President Cites
Siginificant Accomplishments
of AVMA in Past Year

Two recent turn of events in Washing-
ton which bode well for the veterinary
profession are favorable action by Con-
gress on bills to create an Animal Health
Research Act and the release of funds
formerly appropriated by Congress but
impounded by President Nixon.

Dr. John F. Quinn

Outgoing AVMA president Dr. John
F. Quinn (MSU ’43) announced these
significant developments in reporting
some of the activities of the American
Veterinary Medical Association during his
term of office in the past year.

”We are certain now that the Congress
will pass the Animal Research Act and we
are confident that the President will sign
it,” he said. If passed, the act, developed
from legislation proposed in 1972 by
AVMA and the American Association of
Veterinary Medical Colleges, will provide
much-needed funds for animal health re—
search to veterinary colleges and to de-
partments of veterinary science and pathol-

ogy of land-grant colleges.

In addition to the release of impounded
funds, which veterinary schools have now
received, Dr. Quinn reported that Con-
gress is acting on new bills that would
provide more funds for health education
over the next 3 to 5 years. "We have

Student AVMA Offers
ATE Excellence Award

A committee of the Student AVMA is
viewing this year’s A T Exhibit with
special interest and purpose. SAVMA,
through it’s Audiovisual Committee, wlll
recognize excellence in A T programming
by granting the ATExcellence Awards for
the first time this year.

The slide-tape (or script) programs
and videotape programs are being con-

- sidered in separate categories. Ten stu-

dents representing 6 veterinary colleges
are evaluating the programs. So that these
students can participate more fully in the
Convention, only programs under 20 min-
utes in duration will be included in this
year’s Awards considerations.

Student appreciation of faculty (and 1
practitioner) efforts, feedback to inter-

 

 

 




 

 

 

 

ested authors, and encouraging the in-
creased availability, sale and /or exchange
of learning materials are the principal ob-
jectives of the ATE Award project, ac-
cording to Miss Jane Meier (Purdue ’75),
coordinator of the SAVMA project. A
program’s effectiveness as a learning re-
source will be considered from the per-
spectives of the target population for
which they were created. Why not see
how well you agree—the Exhibit is
located on the lower Lobby of the Curri-
gan Exhibition Hall. Watch the JAVMA
for an announcement of the Award

recipients.

Dr. Harrell Honored by ACLAM

Honorary membership in the American
College of Laboratory Animal Medicine
(ACLAM) was bestowed upon George
T. Harrell, Jr., M.D., during the 111th
Annual Convention of the AVMA in
Denver, Colorado. Dr. Harrell, an hon-
orary member of the AVMA, was hon-
ored by ACLAM for his significant
contributions to the development of lab-
oratory animal medicine. Dr. Harrell, a
renowned scholar, educator, and aca-
demic administrator, was clean during the
formation of two schools of medicine—
the University of Florida College of Med-
icine and the Milton S. Hershey Medical
Center at Pennsylvania State Medical
School. At both institutions he provided
encouragement and the environment for
the development of quality animal sup-
port programs to assist faculty in their
teaching and research endeavors. He also
supported the development of postdoc-
toral training and research in laboratory
animal medicine. He has served as an
advisor to the National Institutes of
Health and the National Academy of
Sciences in matters relating to laboratory
animal resources.

His address to 110 ACLAM diplo-
mates and guests at a banquet honoring
him stressed the importance of veterin-

 

ary and human medicine developing co-

operative programs to solve
in the biomedical sciences.

Can You Beat This Record?

Dr. W. M. Coffee (IND ’18), La-
Center, KY, who has been in practice
for 56 years, says he has attended 55 con-
secutive AVMA conventions. That must
be a record! Dr. Coffee was AVMA
president in 1950-51.

medicine will receive its fair share of these
monies,” Dr. Quinn said, ”and that the
anticipated federal funds will help our
veterinary medical schools expand their
enrollments and permit more students to
find educational opportunities in veter-
inary medicine.”

Animal Technicians

Two other areas of education in which
AVMA has made significant progress
this year, Dr. Quinn said, are the develop-
ment of a new accreditation program for
animal technicians and the inauguration of
a new procedure for evaluating foreign
colleges of veterinary medicine.

The first four training programs to be
accredited by AVMA are at Michigan
State University, the University of Ne-
braska School of Technical Agriculture,
Columbus Technical Institute in conjunc-
tion with Ohio State University, and Fort
Steilacoom Community College, Tacoma,
WA.

"I believe the AVMA accreditation pro-
gram will provide a tremendous service
to the profession by helping to assure that
the animal technicians we get in the future
will have the kind of training and com-
petence we need,” Dr. Quinn said.

Approved Foreign School

The State University of Utrecht in the
Netherlands became the first foreign vet-
erinary school 'to be approved under
AVMA’s new procedure for evaluating
veterinary schools outside the United
States and Canada, Dr. Quinn reported.
”Like the accreditation program for ani-
mal technician training, this evaluation
program is a significant step forward in
assuring that the services we provide as a
profession will be the best possible,” he
said.

Animal Overpopulation

The outgoing president said AVMA
members can be proud of what the pro-
fession has done during the ast year in
the area of animal overpopulation. New
public education materials on pet neuter-
ing, developed and distributed by the
Association since January, include the
pamphlet "Pethood or Parenthood,” slide-
sets, a 16-mm film, and a 30-second tele-
vision public service announcement. Dr.
Quinn credited state and local veterinary
medical associations with much of the
widespread distribution and wide use of
these materials, particularly the TV an-
nouncement, which has reached an esti-
mated 150 million people.

Drop by and let us know if there’s
any way we can assist you.

As a veterinary practitioner one frequently ﬁnds himself
in the role of nutritionist.

Whether it’s in response to a new pet owner asking
“What should I feed him?”, or the result of diagnosing
clinical signs of nutritional deﬁciency — keeping abreast
of the latest research and development concerning animal
nutrition is an important part of your practice.

While Champion Valley Farms is quite new to the ﬁeld of
animal nutrition, we bring with us a considerable
knowledge of food science, dietary studies, and advanced
quality production control systems through our parent
organization, Campbell Soup Company.

While we’d like the chance to acquaint you with our
efforts toward developing highly acceptable nutritionally
adequate products, we’d like even were importantly, the
opportunity to meet you in person, and get a better feeling
as to how we might best serve the needs of your practice
through product development and consumer education
over the coming years.

We hope that you’ll be able to set aside at least a little of
your time during the AVMA Convention and meet some
of the people behind our Recipe brand pet products.

We’ll be at booth 118-119-120.

See you there!

cently in the area of animal overpopulation
is the initiation and coordination of a
National Conference on the Ecology of
the Surplus Dog and Cat Problem in
Chicago 2 months ago,” Dr. Quinn said.
Upon the invitation of AVMA, the Amer-
ican Humane Association, the Humane
Society of the United States, the American
Kennel Club, and the Pet Food Institute
met in what might be called a "landmark"
meeting to study the animal overpopula-
tion problem. Tangible results include 11
fine papers that cover every major aspect
of the surplus animal problem and a com-
prehensive report on conclusions and rec-
ommendations which will be available in

booklet form, possibly by September 1.

”What is perhaps more important about
this conference,” Dr. Quinn said, "I think
we have laid the groundwork for a good
deal of cooperation and mutually bene-
ficial work by a number of different
groups that have, up till now, been wast-
ing a lot of effort working at cross-
purposes toward very similar goals.”

In conclusion, the outgoing president
said that although he left the office with
some regret he also left it with complete
confidence that "our new officers and our
ever-faithful delegates, Executive Board,
headquarters staff, and members in gen-
eral will continue to move this great
organization forward, as it has moved
forward for the past 111 years, to reach
new heights and keep veterinary medicine
the high calling and noble profession we
know it to be."

On leaving office, Dr. Quinn received
from Dr. John B. Carricaburu (COL ’44),
incoming president, the past-president’s

plaque.

 

Two Reelected
To NBVME

The House of Delegates, Sunday, July
21, reelected two incumbents to the Na-
tional Board of Veterinary Medical Ex-
aminers: Dr. F. D. Wertman (ISU ’40),
Des Moines, IA, and Dr. M. H. Phillip-
son (ONT ’49), Las Vegas, NV.

 

Smoking Ban In Section
Meetings

"No Smoking” signs will again be
posted in all rooms where the ‘seven
official scientific sections are holding
sessions this week. The recommendation
by the AVMA Committee on Scientific
Program was first imposed last year for
the health, safety, and comfort of every-
one attending the section programs. It is
hoped that the same commendable re-
sponse will be made to the ban this year
as was made in Philadelphia last year.

Mardel Memo:

 

 

People ask us, "What's a
nice young pet supply outfit
like you doing at a veterinari—
an's meeting?"

Well, the reason is very
simple. We've come up with a
couple of new products that are
just tailor—made for the veteri—
narian, and we're here to talk
about them:

Bonooin, the liquid bandage
for dogs. It brushes on easily,
and dries rapidly to a durable
network of nylon fibers allowing
for normal tissue respiration.

Marnodor—Plus, the odor
destroyer. Composed of freeze—
dried bacteria in tablet form,
it mixes into a water solution
for convenient spray applica—
tion. And there's never been
anything like it for controlling
odor where animals are handled
and kept.

We have lots more to tell
you about these two new prod-
ucts, as well as some other
irons we have in the fire. Stop
by our booth and register, we
will be happy to forward you
some samples to try.

House Reduces Period
for Honor Roll Membership

The House of Deelgates, Sunday, July
21, reduced the period of continued
membership required for an AVMA
member to attain honor roll status.
proposed amendment to the AVMA By-
laws, adopted by the House Sunday,
states that ”A veterinarian who has
reached the age of 70 years and has main-
tained continuous membership in the
Association for a period of 40 years, may,
upon recommendation by the Executive
Board, have his name added to the Asso-
ciation’s Honor Roll . .

The amendment was one of 18 pro-
posed to the House at this year’s meeting.
Seventeen of the amendments were adopt-
ed. One was rejected and referred back
to the Executive Board and Council on
Biological and Therapeutic Agents for
clarification.

President-Elect Dr. John B. Carrica-
uru (COL ’44), presiding officer, called
or a roll call on the disposition of a pro-
osed amendment on membership which

elicited considerable discussion. The
amendment proposed to remove the re-
quirement that applications for AVMA
membership be processed through state
associations for recommendation. Focus
of the discussion was on the question of
state rights. Dr. N. W. Pieper (COR
’32), chairman of Reference Committee
4, which recommended adoption of the
amendment, explained that it in no way
encroaches on the rights of state associ-
ations and would facilitate certain pos-
sible decisions of the Judicial Council.
The House adopted ‘the amendment on
the roll call vote.

Final action was taken on two amend-
ments related to changing the name of
the National Conference of Student Chap-
ters of the AVMA to the Student Ameri-
can Veterinary Medical Association
(SAVMA). The Judicial Council, in
another amendment adopted, is given the
authority for disciplinary actions within
the membership.

Veterinary Expertise Needed
in Exotic Animal Diseases

A need for US. veterinary expertise in
exotic animal diseases was emphasized by
the House of Delegates in a resolution
adopted July 21, calling on AVMA to
use i’ts influence to stimulate the develop-
ment by federal agencies, of programs
that encourage the use of veterinarians in
international projects such as sponsored
by the Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAQ), World Health Organization
(WHO), and Pan-American Health Or-
ganiza'tion (PAHO).

Until now, the efficiency of the vet-
erinary profession has been able to protect
the US. livestock industry from exotic
diseases existing in many countries in the
world today, said the AVMA Council on
Public Health and Regulatory Veterinary
Medicine, which submitted the resolution.
This accomplishment, however, has pre-
vented. U.S. veterinarians from obtaining
firsthand experience in diagnosing, treat-
ing, and controlling exotic diseases. With
the increase in international trade and the
rapid transportation of animals, animal
products, and foods of animal origin, the

Yes. You can recommend
ALPO as a complete and
balanced diet.
Here’s why...

Every ALPO product is formulated to provide a
nutritionally complete diet for normal clogs. And we can
prove it. In the laboratory. And in the kennels. By all
acceptable nutritional standards, ALPO is shown to be
both complete and balanced. And here's who helped
us prove it:

I. THE NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL
(NRC) OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY
OF SCIENCES.

Every ALPO variety is fortified to meet the nutrient
requirements for maintenance and growth of dogs,
as established by the NRC Committee on Animal
Nutrition.

2. THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN
FEED CONTROL OFFICIALS (AAFCO).

ALPO's substantiation under the AAFCO Protocols,
which provide for adequate testing of nutritional
claims, shows that all ALPO products are complete
and balanced for dogs. . . for reproduction,
gestation, lactation, grOwth of puppies, and
maintenance of adult dogs.

3. INDEPENDENT UNIVERSITY STUDIES.

Long-term nutritional research conducted at
independent university laboratories show that
hand-feeding of fortified meat-based formulations

I as the only source of nourishment over several gen-
I erations provides satisfactory canine maintenance,

I growth and reproduction.

4. OUR OWN KENNEL TESTS.

EXOTIC DISEASES — from page 10

danger of exotic diseases being introduced
1n the United States increases, the Coun-
cil said.

By using US. veterinarians in inter-
national programs tO which the United
States already provides major financial
support, benefits would be invaluable to
the US. livestock industry in the event an
exotic disease were introduced in this
country. In addition, countries already suf-
fering from these diseases would benefit
materially from the participation of US.
veterinarians.

The House of Delegates suggested that
FAO, WHO, and PAHO solicit participa-
tion by US. veterinarians in their animal
disease programs and asked AVMA to
inform members of the opportunities
available to them in these international
agencres.

79% U.S. Veterinarians
Are Members of AVMA

The percentage of veterinarians who
are members of AVMA increased to 79%
in 1973. As Of Dec. 31, 1973, the mem-
bership stood at 23,950, a net gain of
1,152 new members. Dr. A. Grant Mis-
ener (ONT ’38), Chairman of the Refer-
ence Committee 1, made the report to the
House of Delegates, July 21.

The number of new veterinary grad-
uates who joined the AVMA also re-
flected gains: 1% for US. graduates and
3% for Canadian graduates. Supporting
the increase was the high rate of mem-
bership retention, more than twice as
high as in 1972. Only 346 nonpaid
members were dropped in 1973, the low-
est number in 10 years.

States with the highest percentage of
AVMA membership were New Hamp-

 

 

 




 

 

 

Progress Report on New AVMA Headquarters

Dr. Francis H. Fox (COR ’45), chair-
man of the AVMA Executive Board,
resented to the House of Delegates,
Saturday, July 20, a progress report on the
new AVMA headquarters under construc-
tion at Schaumburg, Ill.
”Actual construction began in Decem-
ber of 1973,” he said, "but winter weather

   

!‘ *‘

structural steel over the north end of the
building where there is no basement.
"To reestimate the completion of the
pro]ect at this point in July, 1974, would
be. sheer speculation. If the strike ends
this month (as it probably will), at least
6 to 8 weeks will be required for the
ready-mix haulers to catch up on back

 

View of north end of new AVMA headquarters building, June 1, 1974. A 3-month-old

characterized by repeated wet periods,
made for very slow progress. When the
weather improved in early spring, the
contractor replaced the project superin-
tendent in order to achieve better coordi-
nation of trades and the picture bright-
ened considerably. In a meeting with the
AVMA treasurer and staff in early
March, the architect and the contractor
concurred that completion of the building
by the end of 1974 was quite realistic.
”Then on May 14, 1974, during the
week in which the concrete floor was to
be poured, a strike of ready-mix truck
drivers began. By mid-July, it had idled
200,000 workers in northern Illinois and
had halted an estimated $2 billion worth
of construction activity. Our contractor
proceeded to complete whatever work he
could without the floor pour, but that
amounted to little more than erection of

orders, and critical shortages of the raw
materials will almost certainly develop,
along with disputes over the escalating
costs of those and other construction ma-
terials. Therefore, it seems reasonable to
speculate that completion of the building
will probably not occur earlier than mid-
summer in 1975 and possibly later, and
that the total cost (for lease, construction,
furnishings, landscaping, moving, etc.) of
the move from our present quarters to
the new building will be greater than was
originally anticipated.”

In the light of these various delays,
which have escalated costs of the new
headquarters, Dr. Fox said that the Ex-
ecutive Board feels “it will be prudent
for the Association to hold in abeyance
the funding of all other major projects
until the new headquarters has been oc-
cupied and the attendant expenses paid.”

 

shire (93%), Hawaii (91%), Alaska
(90%), and Connecticut (90%). In total
membership, California reported the high-
est number, with 2,814 (83%), Texas
with'1,9o4 (77%), and New York with
1,637 (79%).

Six veterinary colleges reported 100%
0f their veterinary graduates joined
AVMA in 1973. The colleges were: Au-

burn University, University of Colorado,
Cornell University, University of Georgia,
University of Illinois, and Texas A&M
University.

[As of Dec. 31, 1973, the membership
of the American Medical Association was
162,542, or approximately 44% of the
total number of physicians in the United

States]

 

 

MESSAGE CENTER

The Mountain Bell Telephone Com-
pany will maintain a Message Center
in the Convention Complex Monday,
July 22, through Thursday, July 25. If
any veterinarian wishes to provide a
way for his home office to reach him,
he may give them the telephone num-
ber of the Message Center (303, 825-
6388). Messages will be posted on a
board at the MC and veterinarians may

Auxiliary Presents Gift

A gift of $17,991.32 was presented to
the AVMA Foundation July 22 by the
Women’s Auxiliary to the AVMA. Mrs.
Robert Monahan, president of the Aux-
iliary, made the presentation to AVMA
President John F. Quinn (MSU ’43),
during the Auxiliary’s business session in
the Terrace Room of the Denver Hilton
Hotel.

More than half of the total gift was
obtained through contributions from state
auxiliaries and interested individuals” and
through the sale of handicrafts at the 1973
Marketplace in Philadelphia, PA. The
remainder, $6,652, was obtained from
the Auxiliary’s restricted dues.

In addition to the sum given to the
AVMA Foundation, the Women’s Aux-
iliary is holding in escrow a sum of
$10,702 for the AVMA Museum Fund,
should that project become a reality. This
brings a total of $28,693.32 which is allo-
cated to AVMA projects.

Dear Ms. Gould:

This will confirm my March 15 telephone conversation with your Washington
office regarding the AWI exhibit to be presented at our Annual Meeting
in Denver this July.

In view of the fact that the materials to be displayed with your exhibit

are free of charge to veterinarians and other interested parties, it is

our opinion that such an exhibit should be reclassified as a scientific

or educational exhibit and located with exhibits of a similar nature;
consequently, we have reassigned the Animal Welfare Institute exhibit

to the Scientific Exhibit area for which there is no charge for the exhibit
space occupied. In order that you may be familiar with the rules and regu-
lations pertaining to these exhibits, we are enclosing applicable information.

Although we have your application for professional exhibit space, we would
appreciate it if you would complete the enclosed application as a matter
of routine information and return it to us as soon as possible.

We are enclosing our check in the amount of $495.00 as a refund for the
payment which we recieved with your application for professional exhibit
space.

We are confi nt that you will be pleased with this relocation.

ordially,

. COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS: In determining the educational value of an exhibit, it is helpful to the Committee
to know what branded pharmaceuticals were used in the clinical work on which the exhibit is based. Inclusion
of such products does not prejudice acceptance of an exhibit, providing they are reported in an ethical manner,
without commercial emphasis on the brand name" and without deliberate disparagement of competitive
products. It is, admittedly, difficult to draw a sharp line between commercial and scientific intent, when the
research objective has been to determine the clinical efficacy of a specific new drug—particularly at the behest
and with the ﬁnancial support of its manufacturer. The Committee does expect, in such instances, that the
Exhibitor will not embarrass the Association by obvious commercial advocacy~either in display or discussion—of
Speciﬁc products. Failure to abide by this ethical restriction, in spirit as well as letter, will be considered cause
for removal of the exhibit.

1. Eligible Exhibits

Exhibitors must submit a list of products or services that they
propose to exhibit. The AVMA reserves the right to determine the
eligibility of any company, product, or service for inclusion in the
Exhibit and to bar any exhibit, promotion, or part thereof that in
its opinion is not in keeping with the character and purpose of
the exhibit.

Products, materials, equipment, data and service must be ap-
plicable to the practice of veterinary medicine. Biological prod-
ucts require a license from the Agricultural Research Service.
Drugs require an effective NDA. Information contained in the
exhibit and in advertising literature or pamphlets that are dis-
tributed must conform to labeling cleared by the FDA.

Any demonstrations by live models must be approved in advance
by the AVMA Department of Scientific Activities. Such demon-
strations should be kept in good taste and take into account the
professional atmosphere of the meeting.

2. Applications for Space

Applicants must use the official application and contract form.
Applications must be received by the Association not later than
March 1, 1974 with a minimum deposit of $100, and payment in
full must be made not later than April 1, 1974. No telephone or
telegraph requests for space will be accepted.

3. Price of Space

The rental price of space includes a booth of fireproof draperies
on chromium tubing; a two-line sign with company name, city,
and state address; general overhead lighting, night watchmen;
and, a 50-word description of the exhibit to be published in the
convention issue of the JOURNAL OF THE AVMA and in the
official convention program, provided such information is fur-
nished not later than March 1, 1974.

All booths are 10 feet wide and 10 feet deep unless otherwise
shown. Booth equipment consists of 8 feet high back panels and
3 feet high side panels.

4. Assignment of Space

The Association reserves the right to make such reallocation of
space as may be necessary for the benefit of all concerned. How-
ever, no change in space allotment will be made after space
reservation has been confirmed without consultation with the ex-
hibitors concerned.

In the allotment of space, first choice will be assigned on a basis
of one (1) point for each $500 of advertising in AVMA publications
in 1973 and five (5) points for each year of participation in an
AVMA exhibit, provided the application for exhibit space has
been returned to the AVMA office by March 1. After this date, all
space will be assigned on a first-come, first-served basis—regard-
less of the point status of any exhibitor.

5. Subletting of Space

Exhibitor shall not assign or sublet any space allotted to him
and not advertise goods other than those manufactured or sold
by him in the regular course of business. Products and services
to be exhibited are to be listed in “Application for Space.” No
sign or courtesy card is to be displayed for any equipment for
demonstration purposes unless the supplier of such equipment
is also an exhibitor in the exposition.

6. Decorations and Furniture

Tables, counters, chairs, decorative material or construction work
for exhibits will be furnished by Manncraft Exhibitors Service,
216 West 17th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64108, and charged

November, 1973
You are cordially invited...

to submit your application for professional exhibit space at the 1 1 1th Annual Meeting

of the American Veterinary Medical Association to be held in Denver, Colorado, July 22
through July 25, 1974.

The prospects for a larger than average attendance will give you an opportunity to reach
over 2,000 veterinarians who have come to learn about new products and services your
company will be offering during the coming year.

While there has been little change in the standard rules and regulations, these procedures
will be of special interest to exhibitors:

I? The exhibits will officially open on Tuesday, July 23. Exhibitors will therefore
have Monday to set up exhibits at straight time labor rates.

I} Exhibits will be Open from 10:00 A.M. on Tuesday, July 23 and Wednesday,
July 24. Exhibits will also be Open on Thursday, July 25, from 8:30 AM. to
12: 00 Noon.

Dismantling of exhibits will take place on Thursday, July 25, commencing at
12:00 Noon and continuing through Friday, July 26. Straight time labor rates
are in effect from 8:00 AM. to 4:30 P.M., Monday through Friday.

I? No section meetings will be held from 1 1:30 AM. to 2:00 P.M., thus providing
exhibitors with 21/2 hours of free program time each day. There are no section
meetings scheduled for Thursday afternoon.

Finally, in order to have a description of your exhibit published in the May 1 issue of the
Journal of the AVMA please return the enclosed form with your application for exhibit
space not later than March 1, 1974. Exhibit space will be assigned in accordance with the
point system described in Section #4 of the Prospectus, providing your application has
been returned to us by March 1. After this date, all space will be assigned on a first-come,
first—served basis, regardless of the point status of the exhibitor.

You are urged to make application now for the space you desire. Hotel reservation forms
will be mailed to you on receipt of your application.

it’s easy for your pet to earn his wings,” a United Air
Lines pamphlet reads. “All he has to do is fly United. We’ll
give him his free ‘I ﬂew United’ plastic wings. Just think of
the status! Your pet can claim he belongs to the elite group of
animals who have ﬂown at speeds over 600 miles an hour.”
But if pets could tell of their travel experiences in the baggage
holds of aircraft, they might well demand “I surciiived
United’ 11. ags. 4

One woman, for example, flew last summer with her two-
year-old boxer from New York to San Francisco on United.
The dogs 1was dead on arrival in San Francisco. A veteri-
narian rtorraed an autOpsy and attributed the boxer’s

o:ation. United paid the womanh 9300.
'1c cident a. champion borzoi, enroute from
Chicagot - show in Los Angeles, died on the flight,
again from cation. His white coat- was spewed with
blOod froml" -1- s hemorrhaged lungs.

After an Trish .~olf'nound died0 on an Eastern Air Lines
ﬂight from Dallas to Miami,the dog’s owner, in a ﬁt of
rage, reta iated by 5 reading paint on an Eastern 7‘27 and
chopping1 holes in the aircraft. The man’s attorney told CU:
“He had dreamed of breeding puppies from that dog. When
the dog died and nobody seemed to care he just blew his top.”

Unfortunately,
number of animals that die, or are injured, or are disabled

as gaps, so its impossible to determine the exact

.-

.nga pet by air.

Not the same environment

More unfortunate is the fact that the airlines-have misled
pet owners into thinking that the environment in the luggage
compartment ' similaci' to that of the plane’s passenger
section. cA Nor thirst Airlines pamphlet entitled, “Good
\dz'ice nippi zPets on Northwest Airlines, ’ assures
that ca go -ompa. rtrnents are heated and pressurized so
your pet mill hate a comfortable journey.” But another
Northwest Airlines publicationv—a manual for baggage per-
sonnelwnotes that “there is a pattern of mortality {for some
dogs] during summer months.” Short-nosed dogs, such as
terriers, bulldo its, pekingese, boxers, and mastitis, the
manual says, seein to have difﬁculty breathing when it’s hot

there is no industry wide data on the-

 

and humid. That information isn t in the pamphlet for
passengers.

How hot 13 hot? well an airline trade association' memo-
randum notes that on-ground temperatures in a cargo com—
partment can reach as high as 130°F. The United Air Lines
pamphlet, entitled “United’s Guide to Pet Troyel,” says pets
travel in “heated, pressurized comfort just like you” in our
“air conditioned aircraft.” Since, no airline has air condi~

.tioned baggage compartments, the United pamphlet is a

cruel deception.

The temperature spectrum

The high 011- ground temperatures possible in aircraft
baggage compartments are only one end of the temperature
spectrum. An airline stewardess who flies between the Unitev'l
States and EurOpe placed a minimum—maximum. indicating
thermometer in her suitcase. The suitcase, with the ther-
mometer, went into the plane 5 luggage compartment where
pets would ride. The temperature extremes she recorded
were O°F and 104°F. '

An American Airlines ofﬁcial, testifying before the Civil
Aeronautics Board on air freight rates, candidly described
the conditions animals face in the hold of American’s DC-IO.
That’s the new wide-bodied aircraft Chet Huntley calls “an
inspiration for planes yet to be built” a TV commercial.
One section of the hold is a “frying pan,’ the ofiicial
said, with in-fiight temperatures of up to 1159?. “interest-
ingly enough,” he said, “ right adjacent to that some area
. . . we are freezing things.” So, he acknowledged, American
was experiencing both problems with respect to emit"? als in
the same compartment within a few feet of each other. Cori-
ous to see if American levels 111th consumers about baggage
compartment temperatures, we queried three American reser-
vation agents. All three assured us that temperatures in bag-
gage compartmen s where pets are transported are the 5:31.115-
as in passenger cabins.

The airlines are quick to point out in their lit er ratur.
baggag e compartments are pressm ized. V1 hat th 1e, don '1'
you, howexer, istl 1at those compartments are also . Virtually
airtight. Thats so it a tire should break out there it w ould

in luggage compartments must, for the most part, endure
for the entire flight on the oxygen in the compartment at the
beginning of the flight. The freight aboard displaces air
and reduces the oxygen available for breathing. So a pet
unlucky enough to wind up in a jammed luggage compart-
ment may have a deadly problem.

Another American Airlines official, testifying at that

'same CAB freight rate hearing, revealed that American ﬁrst
experienced serious animal mortality on aircraft when it
began ﬂying long-range trips in the 19-1-05 and the 19505.
American and some other carriers, he said, asked Douglas
Aircraft engineers to look into the problem. The chief recom-
mendation in a series of Douglas reports was to limit the
number of animals hauled. .

Most major airlines have since set some limits, however
varying, but in the absence of any statistics there’s no way to
judge whether pet mortality rates have gone up, down or re-
mained the same. Douglas also suggested installation of a
series of fans in baggage compartments “to prevent stagna‘
tion or excessive build up of carbon dioxide in the vicinity of
the animals.” No airline, however, has installed such fans. An
American ofﬁcial testiﬁed under oath that the cost of the
recommended fans and related equipment would be about
$19,000 per plane. A United ofﬁcial suggested at the same
bearing, however, that the cost would be considerably less.

mvss‘etems‘es = as .. "

One way for an airline passenger to have his pet avoid
the hazards of the hold is to bring the animal into the pas-
senger compartment. Seven airlines—Eastern, TWA, United,
American, Frontier, Northwest and Hawaiian—permit this,
but all seven require the pet to be confined to agcontainer
small enough to ﬁt under the seat. Since the maximum height

for such containers is approximately 8 inches, only very small

pets can qualify. Five of the seven airlines limit carry-on pets,
moreover, to one per ﬁrst class section and one per coach
section of each Eight. (American and Frontier permit one
pet per passenger.) So, its important when making a reser-
vation to make a reservation for your pet if you intend to
transport him under the seat. A reservation is wise, too, for
pets to be carried in the baggage compartment, since most
major airlines limit the number of animals that can be trans.
ported there. An Eastern ticket agent told CU that passengers
often arrive at the airport only to learn that there is no room
for their pet anywhere on board the aircraft.

Pets lucky enough to enjoy the luxury of riding in the pas-
sengercompartment are charged the same as pets that must
endure the dangers of riding with the baggage.

The one-way charge for pets is $10 if the passenger
is less .han $.30, otherwise it’s $12. That applies to pets travel.
ing with the passenger on the same- flight. Rates for animals
shipped as air freight are something else.

The premium rates charged for animals have drawn
complaints to the Civil Aeronautics Board from commercial
animal shippers. Several airlines have responded by citing
the claims they’re forced to pay animal owners as justiﬁca‘

is re

tion for the charges. American, for example, says that
claims for dogs and cats run 4-61 per cent higher than for
regular freight. That argument seems to boil down to ques-
tionable logic-the more animals the airlines kill,'the more
they should be paid. . , .

But many smaller carriers, plus Branifi, Northwest and Air
Canada, won’t accept liability for the loss, injury or death
of a passenger’s pet in the luggage compartment. Other air-
lines restrict their liability to the value of the animal, with
a limit of $500. Additional protection can be purchased, but
regardless of the declared valuation the amount of pay-
'ment in event of loss is limited to the animal’s market value.
An Eastern company memorandum notes that customers
“will not collect on sentiment alone, only on proven worth
or“ true value.”

A dilemma for owners

In the absence of any data about the incidence and precise
cause of death of animals aboard airplanes, pet owners face
a dilemma. It appears risky to ship an animal by air, but
just how risky is it? And under what conditions is the risk
greatest? No one knows, and so consumers have no reliable
way of determining when a pet should travel by air and when
it should not. .

CU suggests, therefore, that the CAB, after consultation
with veterinarians and other expert parties, establish mini-

amum baggage compartment standards for the shipment of

animals. The standards should include minimum and maxi-

‘mum temperatures permitted, pressurization levels, noise

levels and oxygen requirements. Those minimum standards
should then be posted at airports and in airline ticket ollices
so pet owners can make informed judgments of the risks
involved and decide whether they are willing to have their
pet take them.

The airlines 'should be required to report all animal.
deaths and injuries to the CAD and that information should
be made available to the public.

As an interim measure, CU suggests that anyone whose
pet dies or is injtxred on an airplane so inform the CAB’s
Oﬁce of Consumer Affairs (W'ashington, D-C. 204-23) so
that ofﬁce and other interested parties can get a clearer
picture of the actual risks involved. Please send a copy of
your letter to Department PET, CONSUMER REPORTS, R0.
Box 1111, Mount Vernon, N.Y. 10550.

Meanwhile, perhaps the best that anyone can do on an
individual basis is to request in writing a statement from
the airlinedetailing the actual conditions a pet will face in
the cargo compartment of the speciﬁc flight under consid—
eration. Then review that information with a veterinarian
and let him help you decide whether to risk’shipping your
pet by air and, if so, whether the animal should be given
a tranquilizer. '

if you do decide to ship your pet by air, be certain that
the container is sturdy, large enough to accommodate your
pet and well ventilated at three sides, so as to reduce the
chances of crushing or suffocation in the hold.

This year millions of Americans will fly
on commercial airlines. And tens of
thousands of them plan to bring their pets
along with them. Many others plan to ship
them by air freight. But pets who travel

by air face a risk.

A Braniff flight-~Kansas to Washington, D. C.:
two puppies dead. On a hot day last July,
fourteen puppies dead on a TWA flight-~Kansas
City to St. Louis. There are many other

examples.

fast they can load an airplane and how much
money they'll save rather than with the well

being of any animals on board.

BAGGAGE BEING LOADED ONTO
PLANES

And the heat gets so intense in the cargo
compartment that the fellows unloading have

to take turns going in and out of the
compartment to keep from passing out themselves.
I've seen some cases—-mostly dogs-—that have
tried to chew their way out of their cages,

that if they didn‘t die from a heart attack

they bled to death as a result of trying to chew
their way out. Some of them did make it out

of the cages. When we opened the cargo doors

they jumped out and were never seen again.”

GALLOWAY NARRATION:

 

A recent airline trade association memorandum
notes, moreover, that on ground temperatures

in cargo compartments can reach a hundred
thirty degrees Farenheit on a hot day. Baggage
compartments are pressurized, but they are
virtually airtight, which means that traveling
animals must endure the flight on oxygen in

the compartments. Since freight displaces

air, a pet or pets in a jammed compartment

may have a deadly problem.

Powerful as the cat it prang from.

It began in 1964. That’s when scientists, working with a
Himalayan snow leopard, made the world’s first successful
isolation and tissue culture replication of panleukopenia
virus. This achievement may have been one of the best
things that has happened for domestic cats.

Virologists at Norden Laboratories found the snow leopard
virus to be a tremendously potent antigen. This unique

virus became the basis for ‘Felocell’, an unusually effective and
safe immunizing agent.

‘Felocell’ is a lifesaver for kittens. . . bridging the gap between
weaning and normal vaccination. Maximum immune response
against panleukopenia is gained with a single 1 ml. dose!

‘Felocell’ is remarkably different from any other
modified live virus vaccine:
0 Utilizes the highly antigenic Snow Leopard virus.

0 Routinely produces a level of protection approaching
that of natural infection.

0 Produced on Norden’s feline Established Cell Line for
maximum safety and potency, a procedure which virtually

Gentle as the kitten it protects

eliminates the danger of transmission of toxoplasma and other
contaminants such as reovirus, picornavirus,
syncytial, leukemia and sarcoma viruses.

0 ‘Felocell’ is unusually stable and safe and it’s gentle—
causes no sting, pain or lump formation.

The choice is yours: If your preference is for a modifie

live virus vaccine, put ‘Felocell’ to work. If you prefer

an inactivated tissue culture vaccine, the name is ‘Felocine’
—the nation’s number one choice for over 3 years.

Either choice gives you the most modern approach to feline
immunology . . . single-dose protection at nine weeks of age.

Rapid and tranquil emergence—this is just
as much a characteristic feature of FLUO-
THANE (halothane) as is rapid and smooth
induction. From the last suture to return of
consciousness, the time elapse is usually
between 5 and 10 minutes.

This rapid, uneventful recovery with FLUO-
THANE provides important patient benefits
—earlier postanesthetic evaluation, prompt
determination of adjunctive therapy, a quick
return of protective reflexes.

Here are additional reasons why many vet-
erinarians consider FLUOTHANE versatile
inhalation anesthesia—from minor proce-
dures to major surgery.

0 Nonflammable, nonexplosive. 0 Can be
mask-induced. 0 Potent. . . can be used
with oxygen alone. 0 Nonirritating to respi-
ratory tract. 0 Does not stimulate salivary
or bronchial secretions. 0 Produces bron-
chodilation. 0 Depth of anesthesia is readily
adjustable. 0 Spares use of adjunctive
drugs. NEW! 250 ml. size now available for
easier storage, greater convenience and
economy.

...RAPID RECOVERY

FLUOTHANE

Brand of halothane

 

 

 

Certain drugs including some broad spectrum anti-
biotics and the organophosphate and carbamate in-
secticides are cholinesterase inhibitors. Do not use
succinylcholine chloride during treatment or within
14-21 days following treatment with these drugs.

ADMINISTRATION: FLUOTHANE (halothane)is twice

atshpotent as chloroform,and four times as potent as
e er.

Therefore, FLUOTHANE should be used with vapor-
Izers that Provide accurate concentrations which can
be. altered in percentage fractions over the entire
Cl'n'ca' range of 0.5 to 4.0 per cent (v/v).

Concentrations of 1.5 to 2.5 per cent FLUOTHANE
3’? reQuired for induction of anesthesia, whereas
maintenance requirements vary between 0.5 and 1.5
per cent in the inhaled atmosphere.

Whichever apparatus is used, IT IS ABSOLUTELY
NECESSARY THAT THE VAPORIZER BE PLACED BE-
TWEEN THE GAS SUPPLY AND THE BREATHING
BAG. IF BETWEEN THE BAG AND THE PATIENT,
OVERDOSAGE MAY RESULT.

Induction should not be hurried, and the concentra-
tion of vapor should not be suddenly increased.

In horses, where endotracheal intubation is desired,
the intubation may be accomplished by using an
anesthetic dose of one of the short acting barbiturates
and/or succinylcholine chloride.

In other species, succinylcholine chloride should NOT
be used for endotracheal intubation. However, short
acting barbiturates may be used.

HOW SUPPLIED: No. 5125—Unit packages of halo-
thane stabilized with 0.01 per cent thymol (w/w). In

The "Parade" Incident

March 4, 1974
Dear Sir:

I must comment on the “Parade Incident” section
of the excellent Feb. 15, 1974, editorial in the J .A.V.M .A.
(pages 352—353). Many veterinarians, including Dr.
G. R. Blind, whose letter appears in the February 15
issue also, are not aware of the carefully planned assault
on our professional image that is taking place.

A short history of the article in Parade is, I think,
in order. Mort Weisinger, the author, contacted John
Whitehead, chief veterinarian of the ASPCA Hospital
in New York City. Mr. Weisinger deluged Dr. White-
head with ancient allegations of nails and coins between
the patient and the x-ray cassette, veterinary dog-nap-
ping, unscrupulous tick dips, and the like.

After assuring Mr. Weisinger that most veterinarians
do not have time for lunch, let alone these ludicrous
practices, Dr. Whitehead referred the journalist to me

Letters

as chairman of the Ethics Committee of the Veterinary
Medical Association of New York City. The author
called me and I agreed to meet with him since I would
not submit to a telephone interview. .

Subsequently, when meeting at my ofﬁce WIth the
author, I was informed that he had been requested to
do a “hatchet” job on veterinarians similar to an article
he recently had written on “ﬁxed” beauty contests. At
that point, I told him I would have nothing to do with
being involved in an article of that type. It was then
that the author told me that he would be delighted to
write in his article that the Ethics Committee Chairman
of New York City was afraid to speak with him. I
then said that I would be glad to be interviewed if I
could review the copy for accuracy before publication.
I received that assurance verbally.

In about 3 hours of conversation during which time
I referred the journalist to the AVMA for their Code

Bind Your

lo urnal Issues in to

then your reference source is always complete, organized and in-
stantly at your service. We call them ”Vigilant Volumes”; they so
carefully store and provide on instant notice so much knowledge of

timely value.

The cost per “Vigilant Volume,” by official commission from the jour-
nal publishers is but $5.95 per volume, permanently hard bound in
washable buckram, gold embossed with period dates, journal name
and special insignia—plus your name stamped in gold leaf. ”Vig-
ilant Volumes” are handsome library additions too, real conversation
pieces. These volumes are bound in the authorized colors.

HOW TO ORDER

Simply ship your journal issues to us via parcel post, together with
your name, address, and remittance, at $5.95 per volume. Within

medical conventions, I have seen it take years before
“organized veterinary medicine decided upon a just
solution.” Who are the judges who are to decide what
is just? Who should decide what is good for the pro-
fession, or for the community?

I would defend the right of veterinary speakers or
writers to speak out and give their opinions so long as
the motive is “community interest” and not an attempt
for personal proﬁt or personal fame.

Brucellosis in Yellowstone Bison

February 5, 1974
Dear Sir:

I read with dismay the Jan. 15, 1974, J.A.V.M.A.
article on page 131 stating that the Council on Public
Health and Regulatory Veterinary Medicine agreed to
continue efforts to persuade the USDA to proceed im-
mediately with eradication of brucellosis from Yellow-
stone bison.

Attempts to brucellosis-test bison or other wild
speCIes would almost necessarily entail a high mortality
and great expense.

 

When threatened species of Wildlife whose contribu.
tion to disease perpetuation is not well deﬁned are to
be included in eradication programs of questionable
beneﬁt at great hazard to that speCIes and at great ex-
pense to the public, then it IS tlme to call for a
moratorium. . . .

I strongly urge that the Councﬂ. dlscontlnue efforts
to promote brucellosis eradication 1n the Yellowstone
bison.

Calic Roping—Cruelty or Sport?
March 8, 1974
Dear Sir:

I disagree with Dr. Walton Hawk’s opinion that
rodeo events and cutting horse contests (wherein cat-
tle are “badgered”), are cruel (J.A.V.M.A., March 1,
1974, page 435). I also disagree with his approval of
the Humane Society of the United States, which has
been antagonistic to such worthwhile animal activities.
as medical research, equine endurance rides, and the
sports of horse racing and showing. .

In his letter he deﬁnes cruelty as “the inﬂiction of
pain or even distress.” My Oxford Universal Dictionary
deﬁnes cruelty as the “disposition to inﬂict suffering”
and as “delight in another’s pain” and as “mercilessness.”

I can accept these latter deﬁnitions; in that context,
rodeo cannot be designated as a “cruel” sport, nor can
racing, polo, steeplechase or most other vigorous sports
involving the use of animals in the United States.

All of the mentioned sports are rough and dangerous.
Injuries to animals, and human beings, are relatively
common. However, it is never the intent to cause in-
jury in any of these sports, and the rules by which these
Sports are played are set up to prevent and minimize
injuries if possible.

By contrast, in such animal sports as cockﬁghting,
dogﬁghting, and bullﬁghting, the goal of the sport is
physical injury or death. These sports may be deﬁned
therefore as intentionally cruel.

If rodeo and cutting contests are cruel because oc-
casionally injuries occur, or because the involved an-
imals are “distressed,” then we should consider as crue1
many other activities for the same reason. These, pie‘
sumably must include racing, horse shows, competitlve
riding, animal circus acts, and the conﬁnement of an-
imals in zoos, kennels, and laboratories.

Certainly animals are distressed at times at dog
shows, obedience trials, in police and sentry work, and

Films To Enhance Public Relations

March 1, 1974
Dear Sir:

I am writing in response to two articles in the
JOURNAL of the AVMA for Feb. 15, 1974. These two
articles “Our Growing Vulnerability,” and “The Pub-
lic’s View of Veterinarians: A Study in a Suburban
Area of Illinois,” both serve to emphasize the need for
more complete and extensive efforts in the area of pub-
lic relations. As stated in the editorial on “Our Grow-
ing Vulnerability,” “Public relations programs can only
enhance that which is already good.” Mr. Craig W.
Thomas also suggests in his article, “The Public View
of Veterinarians: A Study in Suburban Area of Illi-

 

nois,” that a combination of “Lassie” and “Marcus
Welby” might be a good format for a nonﬁctional tele.
vision series. .

I agree with the content and empha31s of these two
articles and I would like to offer the following sugges.
tion as a partial solution toward improvmg our public
relations. .

It is my understanding that Dr. Hernot has sold
the movie rights of All Creatures Great and Small to a
production company in this country. I would like to
prOpose that the AVMA initiate a program to have the
Covenant shown with the movie, All Creatures Great
and Small.

Certainly any ﬁnancial burden incurred by the
AVMA to have the Covenant shown would be minor
considering the potential this program would have in
heightening the image of the veterinarian.

AVAILABLE ON REQUEST

Until l972, the proceedings of the annual
business meeting of the AVMA (officially titled
Business Sessions, but also called the business pro—
ceedings, annual report, convention business prO-
ceedings) was sent to every AVMA member as a
membership service. However, on the assumption
that many people do not use the Business Sessions,
the Executive Board in l972 decided to distribute
(in December) copies only to members who spe-
cifically request them, and to make available to all
members an abridged annual the

(sodium thiamylal for injection, NF)
INDICATIONS: Surital may be used as the sole
intravenous anesthetic agent for major and minor
surgery, or for intubation and induction of anes-
thesia prior to the administration of a volatile
anesthetic in dogs, cats, horses, swme, and cattle.
WARNING: Emergence delirium in horses and
emergence excitement in dogs may occur follow-
ing barbiturate anesthesia. lntracarotid injec-
tions may result in direct cerebrovascular endo-
thelial injury with subsequent edema and
ischemic necrosis in the brain, especially in the
horse. Perivascular injection may result in
severe irritation of the surrounding tissue.
PRECAUTIONS: As with any anesthetic, if at any
time cyanosis occurs or if respiration becomes
excessively depressed, injection of the drug
should be stopped and, if necessary, artificial
respiration instituted.

Additional care should be employed when

AVMA Council Finalizes Position on—

Supportive Care to Seriously Ill Patients

Recommending that the term “sup?

portive care to seriously ill patients”
replace the term “veterinary inten-
sive care,” the AVMA Council on
Veterinary Service at its spring meet-
ing, March 11-12, encouraged veter-
inarians to proceed as rapidly as pos-
sible to develop their knowledge of
the pathOphysiology of shock in order
to provide competent supportive care
to seriously ill patients. It cautioned
that veterinarians consider the conno-
tation of the term “veterinary inten-
srve care” and of the medical and
legal implications involved whenever
they suggest or administer this care.

The Council also expressed concern
that. the high cost of sophisticated
Inonltormg devices which provide op-
lflmum measurements of the seriously
111 pet might discourage veterinarians

from implementing essential treat-
ment of shock.

Horse Show Guidelines

“ The final form of the Council’s
Gurdelmes for the Conduct of an
0ﬂic1al Horse Show Veterinarian” was
a.d0pted _at this meeting. The guide-
lililts‘ pomt out .the speciﬁc responsi-
giveleShOf' veterinarians called on to
Showsp y§1ca1 examinations at horse
not to ﬂint cautlons these veterinarians
inari n erfere With the USDA veter-

an who Is there to determine the

May I. I974

show management’s compliance with
the Horse Protection Act.

When working horse shows involv-
ing the Horse Protection Act, the
guidelines state that the show veter-
inarian’s primary responsibility and
obligation is to show management.
He should make the necessary pre-
show inspection in order to protect
show management from showing any
horses that have been sored. Every
horse entered should be subject to a
preshow examination. Each horse
should be visually and manually in-
spected and digitally palpated prior
to entering the ring.

The Council has a continuing con-
cern about the problem of soring
horses and plans to keep the problem
under surveillance.

Acupuncture

The Council discussed at length the
medical and legal aspects of acu-
puncture as a therapeutic measure in
animals. Until concrete evidence is
available that the procedure has ther-
apeutic value for animals, the Councrl
said it will regard acupuncture as ex-
perimental. Before the Council can
establish a position on the procedure,
further studies with controls must be
conducted and additional cases treated
under the supervision of a veter—

inarian.

The Council’s chief concern is pro-
tecting the public from claims made
by individuals without basis on con-
trolled experiments or research. It is
also concerned about the legal respon-
sibilities that develop when acupunc—
ture is used. “When the acupuncture
needle breaks the skin,” said Dr.
Fayne H. Oberst (KSU ’43), Council
chairman, “the procedure becomes a
surgical one and comes under the
purview of the various state veterinary
practice acts.” The Council said it
will withhold judgment on the value
of acupuncture in animals until evi-
dence derived from controlled usage
is obtained.

Shortage of Food Animal
Practitioners

Trends in large animal practice
have been a long-time study of the
Council. Recently, responding to vari-

' ous groups that have expressed a need

for more food animal practitioners,
the Council explored the signiﬁcant
causes of this shortage. They found
three in particular:

1) Changes in animal agriculture.

2) Rapid expansion of companion
animal practice.

3) Societal changes that reﬂect
changed attitudes of veterinary stu-
dents and veterinarians toward large
animal practice.

853

 




 

 

 

 

 

     
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
   

Some philosophical solutions pro-
posed by the Council include:

1) Development of a good pro-
fessional and public image of the
large animal practitioner.

2) Improvement of communications
between colleges of veterinary medi-
cine, practitioners, and the livestock
industry.

3) Modiﬁcations in large animal
practice.

4) Modiﬁcations in veterinary med-
ical education.

In addition to these studies and
proposals, the Council agreed to con-
tinue studying and developing speciﬁc
recommendations on the subject for
the veterinary profession.

Biological Products

The recent discontinuance of many
biological products and therapeutic
agents was discussed by the Council.
It recommended strongly that any
government agency that proposes to
discontinue a biological product or
therapeutic agent should place the
prOposed action before an advisory
committee consisting of representa-
tives of industry, a teaching institu-
tion, and a practicing veterinarian
before taking deﬁnite action. The
Council also recommended that before
any biological product or therapeutic
agent is removed, there should be

854

wide dissemination of the proposed
ruling among all practicing veter-
inarians.

Furthermore, the Council requested
that the AVMA Council on Biological
and Therapeutic Agents be advised
of this action and asked to take ap-
propriate action on the issue.

Stand-Up Care

In answer to a query to the AVMA
about stand-up (round-the-clock) care,
the Council expressed the following
opinions about 24-hour surveillance of
seriously ill patients by qualiﬁed per-
sonnel:

Stand-up care should be provided
by professional or qualiﬁed para-pro-
fessional personnel. As alternatives,
in less critical cases, stand-up care
might be provided by:

1} An attendant with electronic
audlovisual surveillance living on the
premises.

. 2) An attendant checking the pa-
tient periodically, as needed.

3.) Special-care facilities for the
pat1ent and client.

In the event the
care facilities precludes an attendant
being present for 24-hour duty, the

client should be made aware of this

situation and the exact nature of the

patient’s supervision should be clearly
explalned.

The Animal Control Act combines
two earlier Illinois laws, namely, the
Illinois Rabies Act, passed in 1965,
and the Illinois Dog Licensing Act,
passed in 1897. County governments
are responsible for administering and
enforcing the act, which includes an
educational program to be carried out
at schools, youth groups, and civic
organizations. Registration fees are
deposited in an Animal Control Fund,
which must be used only for adminis-
tering the act and cannot be deposited
in the general county fund.

Basic parts of the act are the ap4
prehension and impoundment of dogs
that run at large and the education
program aimed at teaching responsible
dog ownership and training animal
control wardens in proper methods of
apprehension and humane care of
animals. The county must operate an
animal shelter or adequate impound-
ment facility in which to conﬁne stray
or homeless dogs. Inoculation against
rabies by a licensed veterinarian is
required of dogs that are not conﬁned
at all times. Owners who keep their
dogs conﬁned to a kennel at all times
may register their dogs under a “ken-
nel license.”

AVMA Group Insurance Improvements

The Trustees of the AVMA Group
Insurance Program have announced
substantial improvements in the medi-
cal care plans effective on May 1, 1974.
The improvements are automatic and
members insured for these plans do
not need to request the changes.

0 Plan I—Basic plus Major Medical
Expense Insurance. Under Part
B the lifetime maximum is in-
creased from $15,000 to $50,000,
for each insured family member.
This is in addition to beneﬁts un-
der Part A, Basic Beneﬁts, which
are unchanged. Furthermore, each
year, under the automatic restora-
tion provision, up to $1,000 of
beneﬁt used will be restored to the
maximum.

0 Plans IIA and IIB—Comprehen-
sive Major Medical Insurance.
The lifetime limit is increased
from $50,000 to $100,000 for each
insured family member. This is
also subject to the automatic res-
toration provision noted above.
Beneﬁts Increased. In the past,
after the $300 or $750 deductible
the plans paid 100% of hospital
room and board charges up to $50
per day and 80% of other eligible
expenses. Under the change, the
hospital room and board benefit
remains unchanged; however, 80%
is payable for the ﬁrst $2,000 of
other eligible expenses incurred in
a calendar year and 100% of the
balance.

855

 

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Family Deductible. Previously,
the deductible of $300 or $750
applied to each member of the
family. After May 1, 1974, the
maximum deductible for a family
in a calendar year will be $600 or
$1,500, depending upon the indi-
vidual deductible elected.

The same improvements are being
made in the AVMA Employee Plan
for lay employees.

No additional charge will be made

for the increased coverage in Plan I.
The extensive increase in beneﬁts un-
der the Comprehensive Major Medical
Plans (IIA and IIB) , however, have
required a modest increase in charges.
Details of all plans available in the
AVMA Group Insurance Program and
the charges may be obtained by writ-

Trust, Fourth Floor, 105 W. Madison
St., Chicago, IL 60602. Telephone

Dr. Kent C. Roberts (COR ’51),
Purcellville, received the title “Virginia
Veterinarian of the Year” at the
banquet opening the annual conven-
tion of the Virginia V.M.A., February
16—18, at Charlottesville. Before a
capacity audience, Dr. Roberts was
presented a framed certiﬁcate by Dr.
Kermit Cockrell (TUS ’58), Herndon,
awards committee chairman. He cited
Dr. Roberts for his “leadership, in-
spiration, and contributions” to the
veterinary profession. Dr. Cockrell
said Dr. Roberts always wanted to be
a veterinarian, as his father was. At
Cornell University, where he got his
D.V.M. degree, Dr. Roberts won the
coveted prize for the most humane
and kind treatment of animals. In
his community today, he has won the
same reputation, Dr. Cockrell said.

Although Dr. Roberts conducts a
busy mixed practice with two associ-
ates, he continues to make contribu-
tions to the profession and his state
and community. He has served as
president of both the Virginia V.M.A.
and of the Northern Virginia Veter-
inary Conference, and as director of
the District Of Columbia Academy of
Veterinary Medicine.

He has served on the Virginia
V.M.A. committee for establishing
animal technology programs in com-
munity colleges; on the General As-
sembly study commission for the pos-
sible establishment of a college of
veterinary medicine in Virginia, and is
presently serving his second 5-year
term on the Virginia State Board of
Veterinary Medical Examiners, of
which he is past president.

In community affairs, Dr. Roberts
served on the Loudoun County school
board for several years, being elected
chairman the last year. Now he is
on the Parents’ Committee at Mercers-
burg Academy.

Convention Program

.Dr. T. Marshall Hahn, president of
Virginia Polytechnic Institute and
State University, discussed the pos—
SIbllities of establishing a college of
veterinary medicine at Virginia Poly-
technic Institute, as recommended by
a study commission of the General
Assembly. In general sessions, dis-
cussmns were conducted on the vet-
ermarian’s use of animal technicians
and ways ’in which practitioners, state
departments, and the Virginia Poly-
technic Institute can better serve each
other and the public. Separate sem-
lnars were held during one morning
and afternoon on large animal, small
anlrnal, and regulatory veterinary
medlcme.

The association approved life mem-
berships for two members: Dr. Ira
Franklin (AUB ’42), now residing in
San Miguel de Allende, CTO, Mexico;
and Dr. Walter Williams (COR ’36),
Upperville, VA.

Animal Technicians Rules

Rules and regulations for animal
technicians were unanimously en-
dorsed by the association on February
17, and the Virginia State Board of
Veterinary Medical Examiners
adopted them the same day. This cul-
minates many years of preparation by
Virginia veterinarians, led by Dr. H.
Carlton Newman (MID ’44), chair-
man of Virginia V.M.A.’s animal tech-
nician’s committee, who has traveled
extensively and conducted research in
an effort to establish the program in
Virginia.

Since the state Practice Act was
amended by the 1972 General Assem-
bly to provide for the examination and
licensing of animal technicians, the
ﬁrst examinations for these workers
will be given June 10, 1974. Applica-
tions, fully documented, must be sub-
mitted by May 10. Forms and addi-
tional information are available from
the Virginia Department of Profes-
sional and Occupational RegistratiOn,
Box 1X, Richmond, VA 23219.

Virginia has one 2-year course in
animal technology, which offers an as-
sociate degree when the course is suc-
cessfully completed. The program, di-

rected by Dr. William B. Allison
(COR ’60), is conducted at Blue
Ridge Community College, Weyer’s
Cave, VA, in the Blue Ridge Moun-
tains. Its ﬁrst graduates will receive
certiﬁcates in June.

New Officers

Dr. Seymour L. Kalison (MSU
’40), Blacksburg, was elected pres-
ident of the association. He is profes-
sor of veterinary science and project
leader of veterinary science extension

’57), Annandale, president-elect; Dan-
iel V. Flynn (UP ’58), Charlottesville,
vice president; and Grover D. Cloyd
(AUB ’42), Richmond, secretary-
treasurer.

Dr. Kalison, who has ﬁlled his pres-
ent position at VPI and State Univer-
sity for the past 20 years, began his
veterinary career as a private practi-
tioner. After 2 years, he joined the
USDA as supervisor of animal dis-
ease eradication, Agricultural Re-
search Service, in western Tennessee.
During 1945—1950, he was supervisor
of meat inspection activities for the
Department of Health, in East Haven,

Illinois V.M.A. Honors Legislators
and Veterinarians at Annual Meeting

The Illinois State V.M.A. gave spe-
cial recognition during its 92nd annual
meeting, February 16—18, in Arlington
Heights, IL, to a number of veterinar-
ians and state legislators who have
served the veterinary profession in out-
standing ways.

Service Award

Top honor, the Illinois Veterinary
Service Award, went to the two veter-
inarians Dr. Robert E. Storm (ISU
’40), Skokie, and Dr. Erwin Small
(ILL ’57), Urbana. The recipients
were selected in recognition of their
meritorious contributions to the veter-
inary medical profession. Dr. Storm is
a small animal practitioner in the Chi-
cago suburb of Skokie. Dr. Small is
professor of veterinary clinical ined-
icine at the University of Illinois Col-
lege of Veterinary Medicine.

President’s Plaque

Retiring presidents of the Illinois
State V.M.A. and of the Illinois Acad-
emy of Veterinary Medicine received
plaques in recognition of their service
to these organizations. Recipients
were Dr. Emil Gast (KSU ’52), Jer-
seyville, retiring president of the vet-
erinary association, and Dr. Elmer
Goetz (COL ’44), Mattoon, retiring
president of the academy.

Awards of Merit

This year, the association honored
two state legislators for their efforts in
legislation relevant to the Illinois State
V.M.A. and veterinary profession.
The Award of Merit was presented to
State Representative Daniel Pierce
(D.-Highland Park) and State Sen-
ator John B. Roe (R.-Rochelle).

Rep. Pierce, minority whip of the
Illinois House, was honored for his
sponsorship of the Animal Welfare
Act, which became effective Oct. 1,
1973. The new law provides for the
state licensing and inspection of all
commercial establishments selling any
kind of animal. The Congressman has
also received honors as a leader in the
areas of special education and envi-
ronmental protection.

Sen. Roe, serving his ﬁrst term in
the Illinois General Assembly, was
honored for his work on behalf of leg-
islation modernizing the Veterinary
Practice Act. The 1961 law was re-
vised in 1973 to reﬂect changes in the

858

practice of veterinary medicine, in-
cluding recognition of ammal health
technicians and the need for contin-
uing education for veterinarians. Sen.
Roe is vice chairman of the Senate
Committee on Public Health, Welfare,
and Corrections.

Scientific and Social Program

A total of 17 scientiﬁc sessions and
four small animal in-depth seminars
provided veterinarians with the latest
information in veterinary medical ad-
vances. Social events included the an-
nual banquet and a Hawaiian revue.
A guest at the meeting was Dr. John
Quinn (MSU ’43), president of the
AVMA.

New Officers

New ofﬁcers elected were: Drs. J. H.
Nadler (ILL ’54), Peotone, president;
R. C. Glover (OSU ’42), Evanston,
president—elect; W. W. Brown (ISU
’55), Earlville, treasurer; and W. E.
Brandt (ILL ’55), Flanagan, chair-
man of the executive board.

Academy Officers

An increase in attendance at the
116—member Illinois Academy of Vet-
erinary Medicine meeting and lun-
cheon was noted again this year.
Members elected the following ofﬁ-
cers: Drs. T. T. Wright (ONT ’52),
Des Plaines, president; Leland H.
Holt (MO ’55), Granite City, pres-
ident-elect; R. E. McKinney (ILL
’62), Jacksonville, treasurer; and R. A.
Latham (ILL ’52), Erie, retained as
executive secretary.

Ul Student AVMA Chapter
Receives New Upjohn Grant

The Illinois Student Chapter of the
AVMA recently received a $500 grant
from the Upjohn Company, enabling
the chapter to expand its activities. A

Illinois State V.M.A.
Completes 2nd Heartworm
Survey

Many Illinois practitioners are ﬁnd-
ing that heartworm disease appeal}?
in the small breed house dog in addl-
tion to the outdoor and show dog.
Seventy-ﬁve percent of the veterinar-
ians responding to a survey conducted
by the Illinois State V.M.A. said they
offer their clients preventive programs
for the disease.

The 1972 survey was the second
conducted by the association in 2
years. Plans have been approved f0}
another survey to obtain the expen-
ence of Illinois veterinarians with the
disease in 1973. .

In the latest survey, 917 question-
naires were sent to all types of veter-
inarians in the state. The 27% re-
sponding, indicated that more dogs
were treated in 1972 than in 1971 but
that the number of positive cases Was
about the same. Although half the
dogs tested were either in or aroun
Chicago, the highest incidence °
heartworm was in the southern Pa
of the state. The majority said they
diagnosed the disease by blood teSts’
most commonly the Knott’s test.

AAHA To Emphasize
Self-Study Programs

At a February Board of Directors’
meeting in Atlanta, the American
Animal Hospital Association an-
nounced unanimous approval for an
increased effort in the ﬁeld of con-
tinuing education for the small animal
veterinarian. The board action called
for emphasis on the development of
self-study programs to help bring
more veterinarians into the main-
stream of the continuing education
process. According to AAHA Presi—
dent, Dr. Ray Russell (KSU ’56),
the successful introduction in 1973 of
an AAHA self-study course in oph-
thalmology helped prove that prac-
tlcmg veterinarians will respond in
appreciable numbers to the concept
of nonformal study.

In another related action, the board
appointed a special administrative
committee to formulate long-range
plans for continuing education and to
recommend a basic curriculum of sub.
jects to guide the development of the
self-study program series. Dr. George
Abbott (COR ’45), chairman of the
AAHA Education Committee, will
also act as chairman of the Special.
committee.

In addition, the board also an-
nounced the award of a contract for
production of the next self-study pro.
gram, Small Animal Radiology, to
Synapse Communication Services, Inc,
of Old Greenwich, Connecticut. Syn.
apse has been active in the ﬁeld of
developing multimedia instructional
programs for professional groups in
health care. Dr. Abbott stated that
combining the communications ex-
pertise of Synapse with the technical

knowledge of experts in veterinary ‘

medicine should produce programs of

dramatic interest attuned directly to “

the needs of the small animal prac- ‘

titioner.

New Breeding Grounds for Endangered Animals

Opens This Spring at Front Royal, VA

The opening this spring of the

 

 

 

 

 

 

4,000-acre Front Royal, VA, breeding
grounds for rare and endangered ani-
mals is a project that Dr. Theodore
H. Reed (KSU ’45), director, Na-
tional Zoological Park, Washington,
DC, calls “the most exciting and
meaningful thing I was ever associated
with.” A news feature about it was
published in the Washington Post,
Feb. 12, 1974.

Plans are to breed rare and en-
dangered animals that have not repro-
duced enough under zoo conditions
to keep up a healthy population. This
is particularly important today, Dr.

870

Reed points out, when strict importa-
tion laws are in effect to protect ani-
mals in their shrinking native environ-
ments and to protect American crops
from the proliferation of undesirable
animals. “It’s breed or go out of busi-
ness,” he said.

However, to breed and to breed with
some genetic forethought, he adds,
you need space. This is what the
new Front Royal breeding grounds
will provide. Formerly a government
cattle research station, the 4,000 acres
will offer the various conditions needed
by the rare wildlife that will inhabit
it. The ﬁrst animal to be let out in

Front Royal this spring is the Pere
David deer. “This animal does. not
feel secure if there isn’t a herd Wl’th a
balance of age and sex,” said Dr. Reeds
“It needs to interrelate in normal
social units.”

Other animals, like the lion and
hippopotamus, will breed anywherg'
The sable antelope, on the other han i
are never known to breed in front 0
anybody, “We did a study on. them
and had to use a peephole,” sald D1;
Reed. Still other animals need te

The new Front Royal breeding
grounds should be just what all these
animals ordered—privacy or social
interaction—and ensure for future
generations a healthy population of
some of the rare animal species in-
habiting the earth today.

Meat Packers View New
Trichinae Test as
Exciting Revelation

The new blood test for trichinae
control, discussed by Dr. Victor H.
Berry (TUS ’51) at the 33rd annual
meeting of the National Independent
Meat Packers Association (NIMPA),
January 30—February 2, was received
as an “exciting” revelation by mem-
bers of the association. Dr. Berry, who
is assistant deputy administrator of
ﬁeld operations, Meat and Poultry In-
spection Program, Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service, USDA,
said that the test is fast, relatively in-
expensive, and “promises maybe to be
the answer for trichinae control.”

The new blood test, being explored
by APHIS scientiﬁc services under
Dr. Harry C. Mussman (KSU ’65),
deputy administrator, requires about
15 minutes in a laboratory and is said
to be many times more sensitive than
a trichinoscope and very speciﬁc. The
test requires only a tiny amount of
blood from the animal being tested
and can use whole blood as well as
serum. '

The. test apparently could permit
detection of many infectious diseases
0f market animals—all those which
create circulatory antibodies, such as
brucellosis and hog cholera as well as
trichinosis. It also shows possibilities
of detecting food poison toxins. The

PHIS plans to spend the rest of the
year. examining the sensitivity and
SpeCIﬁCIty of the test. No funds for
further development of the test are
contalned in USDA’s proposed budget
for 1975, but APHIS is trying to get
money for this purpose.

USDA Updates Standards for
Accredited Veterinarians

The US. Department of Agricul-
ture, on March 5, proposed to revise
its standards governing private veter-
inarians who help administer cooper-
ative state-federal disease control and
eradication programs and federal hu-
mane laws.

The proposed revisions would:

1) Broaden the duties of accredited
veterinarians to clearly include help—
ing horse shows comply with the Horse
Protection Act.

2) Clarify responsibilities of ac-
credited veterinarians in handling an-
imal medicines and ofﬁcial forms and
tags.

3) Clarify the conditions under
which accreditation can be with-
drawn~and reinstated after a min-
lmum 1-year interval—for failure to
comply with USDA’s standards of
accreditation.

Ofﬁcials said that private veterinar-
ians play a key role in state-federal
programs by examining, vaccinating,
and certifying to the health of animals
that are subject to government regula-
tions.

NEW, SIMPLE, EFFECTIVE FILTER
TECHNIQUE PERMITS

MORE RAPID, MORE ACCURATE
DETECTION OF CANINE
HEARTWORM MICROFILARIAE

. . . AND WITH GREATER ECONOMY.

The Evsco Difil-Test is an improved filter technique
providing increased diagnostic accuracy as well as
saving costly laboratory time. Minimal procedural
Steps produce a reliable sample in less than 2 min-
utes without centrifugation. Far more efficient than
other methods and at lower cost. A specially de-
signed filter provides free-flow filtration for com-
Diete recovery of microfilariae without clogging by

cellular debris. This feature, plus a special inten-
sive stain which is used separately, permits clearer
microscopic examination. This modification allows
direct staining of microfilariae trapped on filter,
avoids staining laboratory equipment, and also re-
duces cleanup time. The Difil-Test Kit, supplied in
a compact plastic tray for finger-tip convenience,
contains ready-to-use components for 50tests.

You, the small businessman, are

The heart of free enterprise. The

But you’re letting it down in one
respect. By not supporting U.S.

Aquaculture Legislation

H.R. 12518, introduced by Rep. Mailliard (R,CA),
would provide for the development of aquaculture in
the United States. The purpose of this legislation is to
provide for a national program for aquaculture develop-
ment in order to increase sources of marine protein for
the consumer, to increase the availability and quality
level of consumer ﬁshery products, to develop new re-
sources to improve or maintain recreational ﬁsheries, to
initiate new business, industry, and employment, and to
provide other national beneﬁts.

Fish Inspection Legislation

On March 4 and 6 hearings were conducted by
the House Subcommittee on Fishery and Wildlife Con-
servation on H.R. 12849, introduced by Rep. Sullivan
(D,MO), and related bills proposing legislation to pro-
vide inspection and sanitary regulations for the handling
and processing of ﬁsh and other seafood products from
the ﬁshing ships through the channels of distribution to
the consumer. There have been a number of bills intro-
duced into the House on this subject. At the present
time there are no regulated or established inspection
programs covering this ﬁeld of food processing.

Other bills on this same issue include H R. 887, in-
troduced by Rep. Pepper (D,FL), H.R. 8894, intro-
duced by Rep. Melcher (D,MT), and H.R. 10150, by
Rep. Bingham (D,NY).

The AVMA submitted the following statement on
March 6, 1974:

.Fish are among the most perishable of all foods. Con-
tamlnation of ﬁsh by microbiological or chemical agents which
prOduce disease in man may occur from many sources. These
Include the water in which the ﬁsh live, the. water “59d for
Processing, the ships in which ﬁsh are transported to the
processing plant, and everything that the ﬁsh come into contact
Wlth along the route of processing and distribution. Man is
the .mOSt important source of microbiologic agents which con-
tammate ﬁsh and ﬁsh products with disease-prOdUCing agents.
Processing methods which utilize modern sanitation safeguards
can mlnimize microbiologic contamination and prevent ﬁSh and
ﬁsh products from causing disease.

The need for more food is a major concern throughout the
world, Our great bodies of water hold real promise for the
production of food, but presently a great part of what man

arvests from the sea is wasted due to poor handling methods.
Good sanitation and processing practices could reduce the cur-
rent rate of loss and assure that safer and more acceptable
products will reach the consumer.
Meat and poultry products have become safer and more
EEOIeSOme. as a result of inspection programs authorized by
m eral leglslation and effectively enforced by the U. S. Depart;
ﬂ (int Of Agriculture. The safety and wholesomeness of ﬁsh an
3 Products could be improved by an effective inspectlon pro-

gram which would assure adequate sanitation and safe handling
practices beginning with the operations of ﬁshing vessels and
extending through the processing activities.

The American Veterinary Medical Association supports and
encourages the enactment of federal legislation which would
regulate sanitary practices in ﬁsh processing through a system
of inspection. We believe that H.R. 12849 would provide the
authority for the establishment of such an inspection system
and we encourage its enactment.

Animal Health Research Legislation
Moves Toward Final Approval

On March 12, the Senate Agriculture Subcommittee
on Research, Chaired by Sen. Allen (D,AL) ad0pted
H.R. 11873 “Animal Health Research Act” and with
minor changes passed it on to the full Committee for
approval (see J.A.V.M.A. April 1, page 686).

Another Bill tor Spay Clinics

H.R. 13193, introduced by Rep. Fish (R,NY) pro-
vides for loans for the establishment or construction of
municipal, low-cost, nonproﬁt clinics, for the spaying
and neutering of dogs and cats.

USDA Updates Standards for

Accredited Veterinarians

In September, 1973, the House Committee on Gov-
ernment Operations held hearings on the Problems in
Air Shipment of Domestic Animals (see J.A.V.M.A.

Feb. 15, 1974, page 356).

One of the conclusions listed by the Subcommittee
was that until the present laws are changed, the Federal
Aviation Administration, Civil Aeronautics Board, and
the USDA can solve most of the problems by coop-
erative operations.

Following through on this conclusion, the Federal
Aviation Administration is amending Part 121 of the
Federal Aviation Regulations to require that cargo
containers housing live animals for carriage by air in
the cargo compartments of aircraft be secured in the
cargo compartment in such a fashion as to prevent
shifting, to assure a continuous air ﬂow around the con-
tainer, and be protected from the hazards of shifting
of other cargo.

Among the problems that were discussed during
the hearings and relating directly to veterinary medicine
was that a few veterinarians were preparing improper
health certiﬁcates and in some cases signing certiﬁcates
on some animals that had not even been observed.

Again, to try and correct this problem, the U.S. De-
partment of Agriculture is revising its standards gov-
erning private veterinarians who help administer c00p.
erative state-federal disease control and eradication
programs and federal humane laws.

The proposed revisions:

1. Broaden the duties of accredited veterinarians
to clearly include helping horse shows comply with the
Horse Protection Act.

2. Clarify responsibilities of accredited veterinarians
in handling animal medicines and ofﬁcial forms and tags,

3. Clarify the conditions under which accreditation
can be withdrawn—and reinstated after a minimum 1.
year interval—for failure to comply with USDA’s stan.
dards of accreditation.

The new regulations list and explain in detail the
requirements for accreditation, speciﬁc standards for
accredited veterinarians, along with illegal activities that
would result in the suspension or revocation of accred-
itation.

These revisions of the regulations should reduce un-
ethical and illegal practices.

Private veterinarians play a key role in state-federal ‘
programs by examining, vaccinating, and certifying to y
the health of animals that are subject to government .
regulations.

USDA Considers Private Financing for

Fleming Key Animal Import Center

The USDA is asking for public comment on obtain- 1
ing ﬁnancing for construction of an animal import
center at Fleming Key, FL.

The center would be a 16-acre USDA enclave on
part of the Key West Naval Base. It would hold some ‘
400 imported cattle or other livestock at one time for
the 5-month quarantine necessary to detect any infec-
tion of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) or other diseases. ;

The center was authorized in May, 1970, under ‘
Public Law 91-239, in recognition of the need to im-
prove American livestock bloodlines with genetic stock .
from parts of the world where FMD occurs. However, :
livestock cannot be imported from these infected coun-
tries until such a center is in operation. ,

Last year, Congress appropriated funds for archl' ,
tectural and engineering planning. USDA is seelflng ;
alternative ways for private ﬁnancing of constructlon,
which could include donations of money, buildings, .fa-
cilities, or other improvements—a means of ﬁnancmg
authorized by PL 91-239.

Indemnity tor Poultry and Egg Producers

S. 3231 introduced by Senator Eastland (D, MS)
and co-sponsors, and HR. 13747 introduced by Rep.
Bowen (D, MS) and co-sponsors would provide indem‘
nity paYments to poultry and egg producers Who have .
been required to destroy or remove their products from
commercial markets because the products conlsﬁllne
residues of chemicals registered and approved for use
by the federal government.

IMMEDIACY!

That’s the idea behind AAl’s small
animal surgical demonstration series——
10 sophisticated techniques, by some
of America’s finest veterinary surgeons
and educators, presented in a way that
puts you right at their side, where you
can learn and profit immediately.

3-dimensional realism.

Each demonstration comes to you
in a combination of media (for use
together or separately, as you wish):

° The visual portion is on a GAF

color stereo disc—brilliant close-up
color photographs that show depth as
well as length and width, with much
more realism than any textbook illus—
tration. (A GAF View-master viewer is
part of the AAI package.)

° The audio portion is on tape cas-
sette. Drop the cassette into any
player, turn it on and listen as the
procedure is explained in detail—as
if you were in the operating room.
(Portable cassette players are available
to AAI customers at nominal cost.)

A major breakthrough.

These days, with the dramatic in-
crease in the possibilities of small
animal surgery, no veterinarian should
be without the capacity for full surgi-
cal service. This remarkable series can
help you achieve first-line capability
quickly, with a minimum of bother.

Free 10-day trial.

Make us prove what we say. Accept
these exciting demonstrations plus .

cine Tissue Culture Origin) Vaccine, Modified Live Virus, INTRANASAL

ew NASAMUNE-IP makes it possible to get the extra benefits that result
rom introducing the virus at a natural part of entry:

Interferon production is stimulated and is present as early
as 12 hours following administration.

Secretory antibodies are also stimulated which provide
intermediate protection.

Circulating antibodies appear in approximately 10—14 days
to provide high level, long term, systemic immunity.

Safety and efficacy thoroughly documented in field trials
involving hundreds of cattle.

NASAMUNE-IP, lntranasal . . .

another new product from Affiliated research

NASAMUNE-IP is produced in tissue cell
cultures derived from Master Cell stocks
from the Affiliated “Frozen Stable Cell
Bank SystemTM”. Bovine tissue cell cul-
ture is used for the propagation of the
IBR fraction; porcine tissue cell culture
for the propagation of the PI-3 fraction.
NASAMUNE-IP is unexcelled in purity,
antigenicity and safety.

Pu rity—The cells used for vaccine prop-
agation, as well as the attenuated virus
fractions, have been extensively pre-
tested to assure freedom from adven-
titious agents.

Antigenicity—The recommended doSe

supplies 16 times the antigenic content
needed to give the animal full protec—
tion from virulent IBR and Pl-3 challenges.

There is no antigen “blocking effect”.
Neither antigen interferes with the other.

Safety—Field, safety studies conducted
on herds involving hundreds of cattle
have shown the vaccine is free of unde-
sirable side effects.

Studies prove that the vaccine does
not revert to virulence upon back—pas—
sage in test calves. Administering doses
thousands of times in excess of the rec-
ommended field dose produced no un-
toward effects.

LEGAL BRIEF

Assistance from Clients

What are the legal implications when a client assists
the veterinarian—or when he simply observes the vet-
erinarian treat or perform surgery on an animal?

Though there appear to be no American Appellate
Court cases involving suit by a client against a veter-
inarian for damages under these circumstances, there
have been suits and threats of suits at the trial court
level.

In January of 1972 a circuit court in Wisconsin
sitting with a jury absolved 2 veterinarians from any
negligence in connection with injury to a client by her
cat while the client was holding the cat during the ad-
ministration of a worm pill by the veterinarian. In this
particular case, also, the jury absolved the plaintiff of
contributory negligence.

In 1968 a local court in Adelaide, Australia, held a
veterinarian liable for injury to a client who was holding
his cat during an examination. The judge said that
permitting the client to expose himself to the risk of
injury without warning was a breach of duty on the
part of the veterinarian.

In her book, Clinical Aspects of Some Diseases of
Cats, Miss J. 0. Joshua states with regard to the danger
from cat bites: “. . . but a warning must also be given
as to the dangers from a bite and the method of holding
advisable . . . the veterinarian has an equal public health
duty to himself, his clients, and his staff in this respect.”
In addition to the physical injury which may result, the
writer also points out that infection might occur follow-
ing a cat bite.

In another instance, suit was ﬁled by a client who
fainted after smelling the ether being used to anesthetize
his cat. Apparently this was settled out of court.

What should be the veterinarian’s attitude about
permitting the client or even asking the client to help?
As always in situations involving negligence, the answer
depends on the circumstances. To my knowledge there
1s no law or provision in any practice act which states
that a veterinarian should not use the client’s assistance.

But there are some important considerations. In cor-
responding with attorneys involved in the 1972 Wiscon-

sin case I stated: “Certainly your client’s (vete.
inarian’s) defense will be strengthened if it can be
shown that he warned the client about the possibility
cat bites or scratches when she agreed to hold her ca?
I feel however that a good defense can be built, eve"
if there were no warning, if it can be shown that:

1. The client is experienced with cats.

2. The veterinarian had no knowledge that this ca
had a Vicious temperament or a habit of biting an
clawing. ;

3. The cat had no defects or diseased or tender spo. ‘
which would have made it unusually sensitive when hel 1
and which the veterinarian knew about or should ha‘,
discovered. _ ‘ . '-

4. It is accepted custom among veterinarians .111
locality (the larger the locality the better, 1n VIBVY, f'
the dim View courts now take of the “locality rule 5
human medicine) for clients to hold their ownpe
while the veterinarian examines them or admimster
shots or medication.

“If the client has held her cats on other Occaswllt
while they were being examined or treated, and piet-
ticularly if she has previously held this cat for thlsgto
erinarian, another strong argument would be adde
the defense.” 1- able

In my opinion, these same prinCipleS are appri‘c di-
whether it is a large animal or a pet ammal. rable
tionally, large animal owners have been knowledgeaex.
and.If competent in handling animals and have beeghese
pected to assist as a matter of course. But even 11} a is

veterinarian is in a position to appraise and which
might indicate that it is either reasonable or unreason-
able to use the client’s assistance.

Permitting clients or for that matter other indi-
viduals to witness the treatment of an animal, particular
surgery, also contains some legal hazards other than
complaints which may arise from animal humane orga-
nizations. Fainting, nausea, or even “shockng the sensi-
bilities” could lead to the threat of legal action. If the
veterinarian pays no heed to those who watch him per-

Although veterinarians should not “run scared” about
using clients to assist—because there are many situations
in which this is a reasonable and nonnegligent thing
to do—they should keep in mind that any negligence
or lack of foresight on the veterinarian’s part which
might lead to a client’s injury can also lead to a damage
suit. As the number of clients increase and the rela.
tionships become less personal, this danger increases and
may lead a veterinarian to decide that as a matter of
policy clients should not be permitted to assist in the
treatment of animals.

Anti-Science—A Misunderstanding

It is relatively easy, then, to build up
a picture of the contemporary scientist as
a mercenary, prepared to serve any
master who will build him his machines.

only from itself, as witness the author-
ship of practically every book and sym-
posium on research and educational
policy. .
Lastly, but importantly, disillus10n
comes from trivial and unnecessary lack

nized. I believe exactly the opposite is
true. Scientists are ﬂattered to be even
noticed! But the news media ignore a
scientist’s work unless a “breakthrough”
has occurred or unless an established
“celebrity,” such as a Mead, Pauling,

Scientists themselves, through their own
organizations, have done much to form
this image. . . But if science, in its own of-
ﬁcial pronouncements, equates itself with
business, it must expect to be regarded
as such—so that, let us say, a cutting
back of scientiﬁc research funds for eco-
nomic reasons is of no greater public in-
terest than a decision to cut back on ad-
vertising. And it cannot expect, any more
than business expects, to be listened to
as a disinterested moral force . . . .

As for the technological effects of sci-
ence, in this case it is more difﬁcult to
construct a balance sheet. . . . Yet it
has to be admitted, I think, that there
are characteristics of science which are
at least partly responsible, in a quite di-
rect way, for our present technologically
induced ills. Science has not been so
structured as to consider those topics
which cut across specialties. And even

DeBakey, or Barnard says something.
Celebrities who have an “image” can
easily rate a full news column based on
trivia. Misbehavior of scientists or phy.
sicians, even though petty, will make the
front pages, of course.

of consideration for other human beings:
at times this failing is exhibited by both
scientists and physicians. Thus scientists
often forget that their support comes
from money earned by taxpayers, and
doctors occasionally do not treat a patient
because he is needed as a control.

Explaining Medicine's Unpopularity

Since biomedical research is the basis
of most medical progress, and since the
relatively few voices derogating scientists
have become so persistent and vitriolic,
their accusations need examination. Sci-
ence, medicine, and the universities,
like all recipients of taxpayers’ support,
should engage in on-going self-criticism
if they expect to fulﬁll the promise made
to the public by accepting huge sums of
money. In this endeavor they have not
shown great zeal! The large-scale ﬁnanc-
ing of medical education and research
by taxpayers’ money might well be the
main reason for the limited but noisy
rancor toward medicine and physicians.

A second reason is the exposure of the
reading and viewing public by the mass
media to overLsimpliﬁed and overdrama-
tized scientiﬁc discovery. This has led
to gross overexpectation. Further, the
questionable behavior of some students
has disenchanted some people on the
virtues of a university education. Uni-
versities have not always integrated
closely enough with matters that seem
urgent to the public. Too long the uni-
versity “establishment” has sought advice

applying and among those accepted, and
consequently in the profession itself. A
Committee was appointed early in 1971
to investigate methods by which more
minority applicants could be attracted to
the Veterinary College. The lengthy
committee report (which was accepted
by the faculty in June, 1971) concluded
that at this point in history there was
relatively little interest among black,
Spanish-speaking, and other American
minorities in a veterinary medical career.

We are in the pr0cess of formulating
approaches whereby the challenges and
rewards of veterinary science may be
presented to young minority citizens be-
fore the age of vocational decision. These
are tentative at the present time but will
hopefully lead to increased minority en-
rolhnents through special education/
public relations programs devoted espe-
cially to minority groups.

Antiscientism

Most medical students have never had
to write an essay in their life. T0 or-
ganize and put down on paper a logical
and concise medical history is often a
task beyond their powers, and here the
problem-oriented record is without doubt
a help. But it seems a poor substitute
for what should be an integral part of

for what's itching him.

The leading dual action corticoid injectable
specifically for canine pruritus.

BETASONE has brought relief to
thousands of dogs and owners suffer-
ing from “Thumper’s Syndrome.’ ’* Its
unique formulation combining a fast-
acting corticoid with a long-acting
corticoid provides prompt and pro-
longed relief of canine pruritus in a
single economical injection.

Immediate action
N 0 other long-acting corticoid relieves
itch faster than BETASONE. Its fast-
acting ester, betamethasone sodium
phosphate, is highly soluble and
begins anti-pruritic activity within
minutes.

Prolonged action
A superior new long-acting ester,
betamethasone dipropionate, then
takes over. The small size and uniform

Precautions and contraindications: For all the beneficial ef-
fects of the corticosteroids, one should be aware of the pos—
sible untoward reaction which may occur. Betamethasone,
like cortisone and all other corticosteroid derivatives when
given systemically, is capable of causrng Side effects, espe—
cially during long continued and/or high dosage. Some of
these are: suppression of inflammation, reduction of fever,
increased protein degradation and its converSIon to carbohy-
drate leading to a negative nitrogen balance, sodium retenf
tion and potassium diuresis, retardation of wound healing,
lowered resistance to many infectious agents such as bacteria
or fungi, reduction in numbers of circulating lymphocytes.

Betamethasone has primarily glucocortICOId action and
should not be used as replacement therapy when mineralo,-
corticoid action is desired. _ .

Corticosteroids are contraindicated in animals With acute
or chronic bacterial infections unless therapeutic doses of_an
effective antimicrobial agent are used. Betamethasone like
all corticosteroids, may mask Signs of infection such
as elevation of temperature. .

Although not absolute contraindications, caution should be
taken in the administration of betamethasone to dogs With
congestive heart failure, diabetes, and chronic nephritis.

activity.
Outstanding results

You can depend on BETASONE to
give relief from pruritus. In 217 clinical
cases, 80% showed good-to-excellent
response. Side effects are minimal
when used, as directed. This is due to
the exceptional long activity of the
betamethasone dipropionate ester
which provides outstanding results at
very low dosages.

The low dosage also means you can
stop “Thumper’s Syndrome” very
economically with BETASONE.

This season, when clients complain
about dogs who go ”thump” in the
night, give them long-lasting relief that
starts fast. BETASON E.

Schering Corp., Animal Health
Division, Kenilworth, N .J. 07033.

An increase in the incidence of osteoporosis may be noted,
mainly in older dogs, with prolonged use of corticosteroids.
Their use in older dogs during the healing stages of bone
fracture are not indicated.

Side effects: Weight loss, anorexia, diarrhea, polydipsia, poly—
uria may follow prolonged administration or overdosage of
corticosteroids.

Warning: Clinical and experimental data have demonstrated
that corticosteroids administered orally or parenterally to
animals may induce the first stage of parturition when admin-
istered during the last trimester of pregnancy and may pre-
cipitate premature parturition followed by dystOCIa, fetal
death, retained placenta and metritis.

How supplied: BETASONE Aqueous Suspension is available
in 5 ml. multiple dose vials.

Shake well before using.

*Thumper's Syndrome is a condition arising from pruritusasso-
ciated with canine dermatoses. SYMPTOMS: Often occurs in
the middle of the night and continues through early morning
hours. Characterized by thumping sound as dog’s foot comes
in contact with the floor while scratching uncontrollable itch.
VISIBLE SIGNS: Irritation of dog is exceeded only by irritation
of owner.

Dr. Quinn’s Invitation to the Annual Meeting

This year AVMA will be holding its annual meeting in Denver
from July 22—25. I sincerely hope that you and your family will
be able to join us in “The Mile-High City” for this 111th annual
convention.

The program, as always, has been planned to provide you and
your family with opportunities for both professional growth and
social activities.

The scientiﬁc sessions will be kept to three days so that we
can maximize beneﬁts gained during time spent away from our
regular activities. A fourth day will be devoted to seminar pro-
grams. The program committee has worked closely with many
allied groups in arranging almost 200 presentations on a wide
variety of topics. In most cases, the presentations have been
scheduled according to subject area. In addition to the nearly
200 presentations sponsored by AVMA, many allied groups will be
conducting programs of their own. This year the program will in-
clude 11 limited-attendance “wet labs.”

Once again the AVMA Foundation will sponsor an all-day
seminar program, providing in-depth instruction on 22 different
topics. Eleven of the seminars will be repeated at different times
so that more of us will have an opportunity to participate. Those
of us who attend seminar programs will be aiding the profession Dr_ John F. Quinn,
as well as ourselves, since any proﬁts from this activity Wlll go AVMA President
to the Foundation. , ,

Once again the autotutorial exhibits should be a convention highlight. There W111 be 60 slide
and tape presentations available and this year, for. the ﬁrst time, there WllI be between 10 and 15
videotape presentations. These self-education exhibits have proved in the past to be extremely popé
ular. Many from the Detroit, New Orleans, am; Philadelphia meetings have been used by state an

AVMA Placement Service at Annual
Convention

Continuing the policy established at the annual meeting
in Dallas 7 years ago, the AVMA Placement Service will
arrange personal interviews between members of the
Association seeking employment and representatives of
organizations wishing to employ veterinarians. The service
is available without charge to AVMA members in good
standing who have registered with the Placement Service
and to exhibitors at the annual meeting, as well as to
potential employers registered with the Placement Service.

Both candidates and employers, who have not pre-
viously done so, are urged to register at the Placement
Service ofﬁce immediately upon arrival at Currigan Hall
in Denver. The Placement Service ofﬁce will be located
in the lobby area of Currigan Hall. Registration prior to
July is desirable. Requests for forms should be sent to
the Division of Scientiﬁc Activities, American Veterinary
Medical Association, 600 S. Michigan Ave., Chicago, IL
60605.

All advance registrants, both veterinarians and em-
ployers, should check in with the Placement Service ofﬁce
immediately upon arrival to establish a contact point for
arrangement of interviews.

The AVMA expects to continue its Placement Service,
and will, as in the past, issue bulletins of available vet-
erinarians and open positions 3 times yearly (January,
May, and September). All inquiries should be directed
to the Division of Scientiﬁc Activities, AVMA.

Message from Auxiliary President

Denver, Colorado, perched
high in the Rockies one mile
above sea level, bids welcome to
the AVMA and its Auxiliary!

Mark your calendar and re-
serve July 22—25 for the 111th
annual AVMA convention.
There will be available, accord-
ing to your interests, a balanced
mixture of business and relaxa-
tion.

Those involved in the legisla-
tive affairs of the Auxiliary will
be registering on Monday at the
Credentials Desk and sharing
coffee with the auxiliary ofﬁcers.
This informal gathering offers an excellent opportunity for
the delegates and the executive board to meet on a “cup-to-
cup” level to discuss items on the meeting agenda.

It is hoped that the House of Delegates, which meets
on Monday afternoon, will seat a full delegation from every
state and have many from each state in the “visitors”
section. You are most welcome to come!

Following an address by Dr. John Quinn, president
of the AVMA, the House meeting will reﬂect the plans and
projects completed by the 1973-1974 ofﬁcers and commit-
tees and will project the anticipated programs suggested
by the ofﬁcers and committees for 1974—1975.

'Of interest to all will be information concerning our
recent Membership Drive, the Auxiliary Cook Book, our
Publications and Public Relations projects, our Interna-
tional Book project and our commitment to our Student
Auxiliaries and the Student Loan Fund.

We have initiated a Swap Shop-Talk for constituent
ofﬁcers who will meet to “show and share” tips and ex-
periences which promote eﬂiciency in ofﬁce.

Tuesday, our second convention day, features the “Get-
Acquainted Breakfast.” Relax and renew old acquaint-
ances and form new friendships. It is an ideal time to
arrange to meet and enjoy Sister State members.

The Marketplace, our annual craft sale bonanza, fol-
lows the breakfast—and is a delightful display of the
myriad craft skills of the veterinarian’s wife. Buy one of
our large shopping bags at the door and ﬁll it to the brim!
What a great opportunity to get unusual, handmade
birthday gifts, stocking stuffers (and even purloin an
idea or two for your local auxiliary) ——many at bargain
prices. On sale here too, will be our ofﬁcial auxiliary
jewelry and the opportunity to order the Auxiliary Cook
Book. You can always bask in the knowledge that you
have spent for a good cause—our Student Loan Fund!

Planned for Wednesday is the “Gourmet Mile High
Breakfast.” Prepare to savor and enjoy a truly elegant
meal! Come early! Eat slowly! Stay to see our newly
elected ofﬁcers installed!

Our sessions come to a close with the Speak-Out, where
members contribute ideas toward the plans and programs
of the future. Hear about our Book Review Panel and
“HOW NOW,” our resource listing of animal books for
the very young reader. Hear about “Pethood or Parent-
hood,” the new AVMA slide /ﬁ1mstrip presentation. Come
prepared to participate and to suggest ideas which may

grove helpful to the committees which ' meet later in the
ay.

«s

Mrs. Robert R. Monahan,
President

Truly, there has been much thought, time, and effort
expended toward making this convention one. which you
Wlll enjoy and remember always! So, start now, dust off the
luggage, it’s later than you think!

See you soon in Denver!

ACLAM Plans Active Program at
I974 AVMA Meeting

This year, for a change in pace, the American College of
Laboratory Animal Medicine plans to hold their banquet
in a retreat from the convention complex in the dining
atmosphere of the famed El Rancho Restaurant nestled
among the snow-capped mountain peaks of Golden, Go.
This beautiful mountain setting will undoubtedly provide
a most stimulative and enjoyable environment to hold the
annual ACLAM dinner. All arrangements have been meti-
culously planned, including busing to and from the restau-
rant. The bus is scheduled to leave the convention hotel
complex at 6:30 p.m., Monday evening, July 22, 1974. A11
ACLAM members need to do at this time is plan to at-
tend. The Monday evening banquet time and setting is a
departure from previous year’s festivities. This scheduling _
will allow more members to attend the ACLAM sponsored
“wet laboratory” on Comparative Ophthalmology con-
ducted by Dr. Milt Wyman, Professor of Clinical Sciences,
Ohio State University, on Tuesday evening, July 23, 1974.
Additionally, Dr. Wyman plans to conduct a full-day sec-
tion lecture on Comparative Ophthalmology. ACLAM will
again joint sponsor a symposium entitled Animal Models
of Metabolic Diseases with the American Society of Ex-
perimental Pathologists and the Institute of Laboratory
Animal Resources. It is anticipated that individual agendas
are ﬁlling rapidly, so do reserve time accordingly to par-
ticipate in these events.

Toxicologic Evaluation of 0-ethyl O— (p- nitrophenyl)
phenylphosphonothioate in Cattle and Sheep

J. S. Palmer, D.V.M., M .P.H.

SUMMARY

Acute oral toxicity studies in newborn calves, yearling
cattle, and sheep were conducted with O-ethyl O-( p
nitrophenyl) phenylphosphonothioate (EPN). A total of
15 calves, 28 yearling cattle, and 19 mature sheep were
tested.

The minimal toxic dosages were 2.5 mg. /kg. of body
weight in calves and 25 mg./kg. for sheep and yearling
cattle. The maximal nontoxic dosages were 1 mg./kg.
of body weight in calves and 10 mg./kg. for sheep and
yearling cattle. At all toxic dosages, cholinesterase
(ChE) activities were depressed. At maximal nontoxic
dosages, all animals were free of clinical signs, but ChE
activities in individual calves and sheep were depressed.

For calves and yearling cattle, but less so for sheep,
there was great variation within groups as to degree of
intoxication induced. Signs were seen in affected sheep
between 4 and 7 hours, in calves in approximately 24
hours, and in yearling cattle between 1 and 23 hours.

 

THE INTRODUCTION of organophosphorus compounds as
insecticides followed the development of acquired re-
sistance of insects to the chlorinated hydrocarbons.
However, the margin of safety (that difference between
the minimal dosage for control of insects and the dosage
resulting in toxicosis) provided by the hydrocarbons
for use with livestock was greatly reduced or even non-
existent for the earlier organophosphorus compounds.
Because many of these compounds were hazardous, fur-
ther chemical synthesis produced metabolites of these
parent compounds; these breakdown products retained
their insecticidal properties but at the same time reduced
their toxicity to farm animals.3

Wettable powder, emulsiﬁable concentrate, and dust
formulations of EPNa are available for the control of
certain mites and insects in a variety of orchards and
for a number of ﬁeld and vegetable crops.2 Recommended
application rates vary from 0.84 to 13.45 kg. of active
ingredient per hectare (0.75 to 12.0 lb./acre) with a
mandatory interval (generally related to quantity ap-
plied) between application and harvesting. The speciﬁed
intervals (3 to 30 days) are necessary to reduce the con-
centration of residues, as well as to protect agricultural
workers from the hazard of skin contact, inhalation, and
ingestion. The seriousness of this hazard of exposure

to EPN and 11 similar insecticides prompted the issuance
of an ofﬁcial safety standard that governs the reentry
of workers into treated ﬁelds and requires the use of
protective clothing and equipment.1 Such a standard
should reinforce the precaution of avoiding eXposures
of livestock to EPN from carelessness in application and
storage that could result in the contamination of feed
and water.

Preliminary and incomplete veterinary toxicologic
studies of EPN and 15 organophosphorus insecticides to
an undisclosed number of cattle and sheep were sum-
marized in 1957 .6 Oral and dermal data were generalized
in dosage categories of EPN lethality, toxicity, and non-
toxicity to calves, steers, and sheep. The present study
was undertaken to more clearly deﬁne the clinical ob-
servations and laboratory results from oral exposures to
3 classes of livestock.

Materials and Methods

An 87% emulsiﬁable concentrate of EPN was used in all
trials. Dosages for each animal were calculated for the
active ingredient on the basis of milligram per kilogram
(mg./ kg.) of body weight. Each dose was administered in
gelatin capsules.

Fifteen 1- to 2-week—old grade dairy calves, conﬁned in
individual indoor pens and maintained on water-diluted
evaporated milk twice daily, were dosed with EPN at 1 of 3
dosages. At the time of dosing, each calf was in good health
and free of diarrhea; body weights ranged from 23.9 to 50.9
kg., with a mean of 34.6 kg.

Twenty-eight yearling grade heifers or steers were dosed
at 1 of 6 dosages. Body weights ranged from 124.9 to 238.6
kg., with a mean of 190.8 kg.

Nineteen 1- to 2—year-old sheep used in the study were
predominantly of Delaine-Merino breeding, either wethers or
virgin ewes. Body weights ranged from 23.6 to 40.9 kg.,
with a mean of 35.1 kg.

Sheep and yearling cattle were fed a grain-mix concentrate
consisting of ground shelled corn, crimped oats, and cotton-
seed meal before and during the trial. This ration was
supplemented by hegari hay in outdoor pens. These Cfl'ftle
and sheep were in good health and in good range condltlon
at the time of dosing.

Blood samples were collected before each trial to estab‘
lish a normal whole blood ChE activity value for each test
animal, and then again at 6 hours posttreatment. SUbSe‘
quently, samples were collected at 24-hour intervals after
dosing. Observations for clinical signs were made at sam-
pling times and at irregular intervals between.

Atropine sulfate, administered parenterally at a dosage 0f
0.5 mg./ kg. of body weight, was used to prevent death-

related to depression 0t ChE activity (Table 1). Three
of5 calves dosed at thlS rate were free of clinical signs,
with minimum ChE values rangmg from 43 to 60%
of the mean pretreatment value. Contrastingly, the other
zcalves were so severely porsoned that they required
treatment; mean depressron of ChE activity was 13%.

The maximal nontoxic dosage was 1 mg./kg, of
body weight, with all 5 calves free of clinical signs.
This dosage was also reﬂected in a 72% minimum ChE
value.

At 5 mg./kg. of body weight, 4 of 5 calves were
severely intoxicated. One of these, which was not treated
because of the moderation of initial signs, died 72 hours
after exposure. The 5th calf at this dosage was poisoned
toa lesser degree than the others and survived without
treatment. Signs of toxicosis, delayed and observed
initially at approximately 24 hours after exposure, were
increased salivation and then, generally, dyspnea and
prostration. Occasionally muscular tremors, diarrhea,
anorexia, and ataxia were evident. A single dose of
atropine, administered in equal quantities intravenously
(iv) and subcutaneously (s.c.), controlled the signs
associated with toxicosis in all but 1 calf, which required
a2nd dose. On necrOpsy, the calf that died had con-
.gested lungs and liver.

The initial indication of toxicosis was one or more
of the following signs: diarrhea, anorexia, salivation,
tympanites, and ataxia. These occurred within a 22-
hour interval, beginning at 1 hour after dosmg and
extending through the 23rd hour. There was no cor-
relation between the signs and the different dosages.

Sheep.—The minimal toxic dosage to sheep was 2.5
mg./kg. of body weight. One of 5 sheep .dosed at this
rate developed signs of intoxication but drd not require
treatment (Table 3). This sheep had muscular tremors
and ataxia 6 hours after dosing, followed by diarrhea
and anorexia, which resulted in a 9% weight loss in 4
days. For the group, the minimum .ChE value was 25%
of the mean pretreatment value, wrth a range of 14 to
33%. The clinically aﬂected sheep had the greatest de-
pression of ChE activity, as would be expected.

At either 5 or 10 mg. /kg. of body weight, .sheep were
free of clinical signs. There was a marked drﬂerence of
the minimum ChE values for the 2 dosages—103%
of the mean pretreatment value for 5 mg./kg. of body

weight, compared with 46% for 10 mg./kg. of body
weight.

At either 37.5 or 50.0 mg./kg. of body weight, all
7 sheep were poisoned. The degree of intoxication of
5 sheep at 37.5 mg./kg. of body weight ranged from
mild to severe, with 2 in the latter category requiring
treatment. At 50 mg./kg. of body weight, 2 sheep were
poisoned and died, even after they were given 2 or more
doses of atropine.

The initial sign associated with EPN poisoning in
sheep was either salivation or tympanites. Depending
on the degree of toxicosis, these were followed by
diarrhea, anorexia, ataxia, muscular tremors, dyspnea,
and prostration. Such signs were seen 4 to 7 hours after
dosing; larger doses caused toxicosis at the lower time
limit. At necropsy of the 2 sheep that died, the lungs
and liver of both were congested; 1 sheep also had
reddened intestinal mucosa and the other a distended
gallbladder.

Discussion

The marked disparity among individual animals in
their susceptibility to toxicosis was apparent in groups
of calves and yearlings, but less so in sheep.

The action of EPN as an effective depressant of blood
ChE activity is reﬂected in both the minimum and
maximum values at all but the lowest dosage for each
animal class (Tables 1, 2, 3). Although the individual
value was erratic as an indicator of the degree of in-
toxication induced, the fact remains that ChE deter-
minations would be a valuable aid in diagnosis of
toxicosis due to EPN.

Rates of biotransformation of organophosphorus in-
secticides differ among animal species.4 For the sheep
of this report, toxicosis was induced in 4 to 7 hours;
for the calves, it was induced in 24 hours; and for the
yearling cattle, it was induced in 1 to 23 hours. In
cattle, therefore, age should be considered as affecting
the rate of biotransformation.

If vegetation were sprayed directly with EPN or con-
taminated by drift from application elsewhere, using the
various recommended rates, livestock having unrestricted

938

grazing of such vegetation would be potentially exposed
at the rate of 5 to 84 mg./kg. of body weight.5 The
minimal recommended application rate (0.84 kg,/
hectare) would be hazardous to calves, whereas a rate
of 4.5 kg./hectare or greater would be hazardous to
mature cattle and sheep. These calculations were based
on the uniform application of 1 lb. of chemical to 1 acre
of land, which would provide 10.4 mg. of the chemical
for each square foot. Assuming that the animal would
consume 3% of its body weight in forage daily and that
some of the chemical would be unavailable by not
adhering to vegetation, an approximate exposure of a
7 mg./kg. of body weight dosage was obtained. This
would be applicable in lush pastures or in those with a
sparse cover of vegetation in which 1 lb. of the active
ingredient per acre or 1.1208 kg./hectare was used.
There were discrepancies between the datafrom the
1956 report6 and the data reported here. The minimal
toxic dosage was 1.0 mg./kg. of body weight to young
dairy calves in the early screening of EPN, whereas 5
calves in this study were free of clinical signs at the
same rate. Additionally, in the early screening, 20 mg./
kg. of body weight was lethal to sheep, whereas only
1 of 5 sheep in this study was poisoned at 25 mg./kg.
of body weight, and that sheep did not require treatment.

Vascular Rings in the Dog

T, S. G. A. M. van den Ingh, D.V.M., and J. S. van der Linde-Sipman, D.V.M.

AMONG CONGENITAL cardiac anomalies in the dog an
important place is taken by vascular anomalies, the so-
called vascular rings, that result in stenosis of the esoph-
agus and occasionally the trachea. In a review of the
literature one investigator found 54 cases of right aortic
arch and 2 cases of double aortic arch.5 From his own
material he added 23 cases of right aortic arch. Re-
cently, another 5 cases of right aortic arch were
described.1'3'4'6

In a series of 5,398 dogs presented for necrOpsy over
a 5-year period (1968—1972), we found 11 cases with
vascular rings.

Case Re porfs

Double Aortic Arch.——A 9-week-old, male German
Shepherd Dog had had episodes of vomiting since the
age of 2 weeks and was dyspneic.

At. necropsy the dog was found to have an esopha-
geal dllatation cranial to a stenosis just above the heart.
At the same place, the trachea was stenotic, with a de-
forrnlty of the tracheal rings. The cause of the stenosis
of both esophagus and trachea was a vascular ring
formed by a well-developed right and left aortic arch.
The left ductus arteriosus was practically closed. The
rlght common carotid artery and the right subclavian
artery had their origins in the right aortic arch; the
left common carotid artery and the left subclavian ar-
tery arose from the left aortic arch (Fig. 1A).

A 6th dog—a 2-day-old male Beagle that died of
catarrhal ﬁbrlnous pneumonia—had a vascular ring simi-
lar to the one described. The ductus arteriosus was

patent and the esophagus was neither stenotic nor
dilated.

Obliterated Left Subclavian Artery Originating Just
Cranial to the Left Ligamentum Arteriosum.——Two 7 -
week-old female German Shepherd Dogs had a clinical
history of vomiting, usually after eating.

At necropsy both dogs were found to have a dilata-
tion of the esophagus, cranial to a stenosis caused by a
vascular ring. This ring was formed by the right aortic
arch, the left ligamentum arteriosum, and the base of
the heart. Branches of the right aortic arch were, in
order, the bicarotid trunk, the right subclavian artery,
and the left subclavian artery. The latter, which arose
just cranial to the left ligamentum arteriosum (Fig. 1C),
was obliterated along the ﬁrst 2 to 3 centimeters and had
a narrow lumen further on. One of the 2 dogs also had
a left and a right cranial vena cava, a left instead of a
right azygos vein, and foci of pneumonia in the lungs.

Left Subclavian Artery Arising from the Brachio-
cephalic Trunk.—A 2-month-old male Bouviers des
Flandres had had episodes of vomiting since it was 1
month old.

At necropsy, a dilatation of the esophagus was found
cranial to a stenosing vascular ring composed of a right
aortic arch, a left ligamentum arteriosum, and the base
of the heart.

From the right aortic arch arose the brachiocephalic
trunk, which ﬁrst gave off the left subclavian artery,
after which the trunk divided into left and right common
carotid arteries. The right subclavian artery arose some
2 cm. distal to the origin of the brachiocephalic trunk
(Fig. 1D). An incidental ﬁnding was an invagination of
the small intestines.

Left Aortic Arch with Right Ductus Arteriosus.—
A 7 -month-old female Dachshund had a history of
vomiting after food intake.

At necropsy the dog was found to have a dilated
esophagus cranial to a stenosing vascular ring formed
by the left aortic arch, the base of the heart, and the
right ductus arteriosus, practically closed, which arose
from the right pulmonary artery and continued past
the right side of the es0phagus to the dorsal aorta. From
the left aortic arch successively branched the bicarotid
trunk, the left subclavian artery, and the right sub-
clavian artery. The latter originated cranial to the
right ductus arteriosus, was obliterated along the ﬁrst
2 to 3 centimeters and had a narrow lumen further on

(Fig. 1B).

Discussion

In attempting to explain the origin of the various
types of vascular rings described, one should start from
the vascular pattern at the end of the branchial period
(Fig. 2). During normal development the postbranchial
period starts with the disappearance of the right 6th
gill arch artery. The left and right subclavian arteries
move cranially along the left and right dorsal aorta until
ﬁnally their origin is cranial to the 6th pair of gill arch
arteries. At the time the subclavian arteries reach their
ﬁnal location, the right dorsal aorta, between the right
subclavian artery and the junction of the dorsal aortas,
disappears. At the same time, both parts of the dorsal
aortas between the 3rd and 4th pair of gill arch arteries
disappear.2 The ﬁnal vascular pattern in the dog is a
left aortic arch giving rise to: (1) the brachiocephalic
trunk (ventral aorta) giving off (a) the left and right
common carotid arteries (the most proximal parts of
III S and III D), dividing in the external carotid arteries
and the internal carotid arteries (III S and III D and
the cranial parts of both dorsal aortas) and (b) the
right subclavian artery (IV D and the original right sub-
clavian artery); (2) a left subclavian artery; and (3) a
left ductus arteriosus (VI S) running from the left dorsal
aorta to the left pulmonary artery.

The development of the various types of vaSCular

aorta between the right subclavian artery and the bi-
furcation of the dorsal aortas does not disappear, a
double aortic arch develops. The subsequent vascular
pattern is reminiscent of the embryonal pattern and con-
sists of a right and a left common carotid artery arising
from the right and left aortic arches near their bifurca-
tion, and a right and a left subclavian artery arising
from the right and left aortic arches some distance before
the junction of both aortic arches (Fig. 1A).

Right Aortic Arch and Left Ductus (Ligamentum)
Arteriosus.2—The part of the left dorsal aorta caudal
to the left 4th gill arch artery disappears, whereas the
left subclavian artery has not yet moved along it. This
results in a right aortic arch from which arise the bi-
carotid trunk (ventral aorta), which branches into left
and right common carotid arteries, the right subclavian
artery, and a left subclavian artery with normal lumen
arising just cranial to the left ductus arteriosus (VI S)
(Fig. 1C).

The part of the left dorsal aorta caudal to the left
4th gill artery becomes atretic at the time when the sub-
clavian artery is moving cranially along it. Only that
part of the left dorsal aorta between the left 4th gill arch
artery and the left subclavian artery disappears. This
results in the following pattern: A right aortic arch
giving off the bicarotid trunk (ventral aorta), which di-
vides again into the common carotid arteries, the right
subclavian artery, and the left subclavian artery. The
latter artery is partly formed by the remaining atretic
part of the left dorsal aorta and partly by the original
left subclavian artery, being more or less atretic secon-
darily (Fig. 1C ). As the left subclavian artery does not
make contact with the left 4th gill arch artery, the latter
no longer has any function and becomes atretic and
disappears.

The part of the left dorsal aorta caudal to the left
4th gill arch artery disappears, while the left subclavian
artery has already reached its ﬁnal location. This re-
sults in a right aortic arch that gives origin to (1) the

artery and partly by the original left subclavian artery,
(2) the right subclavian artery, and (3) the left ductus
arteriosus (Fig. 1D).

Left Aortic Arch with Right Ductus Arteriosus.~
The part of the right dorsal aorta caudal to the right 4th
gill arch artery becomes atretic, while the right sub-
clavian artery is moving along it. Only that part of the
right dorsal aorta between the right 4th gill arch artery
and the right subclavian artery disappears. The left
instead of the right 6th gill arch artery disappears as
well. As the right subclavian artery does not make con-
tact with the right 4th gill arch artery, the latter no
longer has any function and disappears. The result is
a normal left aortic arch, with the following branches:
(1) the bicarotid trunk (ventral aorta) dividing into the
common carotid arteries, (2) the left subclavian artery,
(3) the right subclavian artery, partly formed by the
remaining atretic part of the right dorsal aorta and
partly by the original right subclavian artery, being more
or less atretic secondarily, and (4) the right ductus
arteriosus (Fig. 1B).

Primary Hyperparathyroidism in a Dog

SUMMARY

A 9-year-old male dog of mixed breeding had per-
sistent hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia, mitral in-
sufﬁciency, 3rd-degree heart block, and urocystitis. A
parathyroid adenoma involving the left caudal gland was
surgically removed. A stormy postoperative course, pri-
marily due to renal shutdown, was followed by death 6
days later.

Necropsy revealed typical systemic complications
due to persistent hypercalcemia. The remaining para-
thyroid glands were normal. A bile duct carcinoma was
also present.

 

IN 1925 it was demonstrated that an extract from the
bovine parathyroid gland, given to dogs, resulted in hy-
percalcemia and, initially, hypophosphatemia?”6 When
an excessive amount of the extract was given, causing
serum calcium content to exceed 15 mg./ 100 ml., signs
typical of primary hyperparathyroidism (anorexia, de-
pression, weakness, polyuria, vomition, and dehydration)
and, occasionally, death occurred.5

Diagnostically, the triad of hypercalcemia, hyper-
calciuria and hypophosphatemia has always indicated
increased circulating parathormone.”28 In fact, hyper-
calcemia and hypophosphatemia in human patients
immediately narrows the differential diagnosis to hyper-
parathyroidism, early vitamin D overdosage, or a
myeloma or sarcoidosis with renal tubular abnormal-
ities.17’28 Due to the high incidence of renal disease
due to hypercalcemia, it has been recommended that
hyperparathyroidism should be considered and appropri-
ate tests performed on all human patients with urinary
calculi or nephritis”,28

Although primary hyperparathyroidism in man is
well-known,"e7'13,14,17’23'28 few case reports are available

describing primary hyperparathYIoidism in the canine
species.10,18,2l,24,27

treatment of nephritis and hypercalcemia. The dog had a
2—month history of anorexia, weight loss, polydipsia, poly-
uria, and weakness. A special diet“ had been prescribed and
prednisolone dispensed to stimulate appetite, but only
a slight remission of anorexia and polyuria resulted.

The dog was noticeably thin. Auscultation revealed a
grade III (of V) systolic murmur, heard loudest over the
left apex. Atrial contractions, not followed by ventricular
contractions, were audible. The heart rate was 64 beats/
minute.

Electrocardiography (Fig. 1) revealed an exaggerated

respiratory sinus arrhythmia. Periodic muscle quivering
was evident on the isoelectric line. Primary abnormalltleS
consisted of a 3rd degree atrioventricular block and ven-
tricular ectopic beats. The P—R interval varied from 0.12 to
0.20 seconds but did not follow the pattern of a Mobitz type
1 conduction (i.e., the P—R interval did not progreSSIVely
increase until a QRS complex was dropped). 0

Bacterial cystitis was diagnosed on the basis of mlcro-
scopic observation of numerous polymorphonuclear .18111‘0‘
cytes and bacteria in urine specimens. HematologlC an
biochemical analyses are given (Table 1). _ ,

A tentative diagnosis of primary hyperparathyFOIdlgnl’
mitral insufﬁciency, 3rd-degree heart block, and urocyStltls
was made. Although exploration of the parathyroid 3131} S
was advisable, it was believed that the urinary infectlon
should ﬁrst be treated and the dog allowed to gain strength
Accordingly, the animal was released December 15 on a
regimen of 500 mg. sulfadimethoxineb o.d.

The dog was readmitted on Jan. 15, 1972. Physical
signs had not changed markedly from those of 35 days
previously. An intravenous pyelogram obtained on Jan-
uary 20, was suggestive of chronic interstitial nephritis.
The results of hematologic and biochemical tests during the
ensuing 10 days are given (Table 1).

Surgical Procedures

Surgical exploration of the parathyroid glands was
performed on January 23. Lactated Ringer’s solution
containing furosemidec was administered intravenously
throughout the surgical procedure.

. The right parathyroid glands appeared normal, as
dld the left thyroid and cranial parathyroid glands. A
round mass, approximately 1 cm. in diameter, was visible
at the caudal part of the left thyroid gland. It was
eas11y excised by blunt dissection.

Postoperative Course

.DuG to an apparent postsurgical renal shutdown
ﬂUIdS were administered intravenously and NaHC03
Orally until January 27. Thereafter furosemide was given
Orally, On January 28, the dog had muscle fasciculations
during exercise. Immediately after exercise on the morn-
mg 9f January 29, the dog had a 5-minute convulsion.
on10-(310nic muscle spasms were interspersed with
running movements of all 4 limbs, chewing movements
of the mouth, and excess salivation. On the morning of
January 30, the dog appeared noticeably weaker and
ad another convulsion after exercise. By night, he
Conld not move in or out of his cage unaided. During
the night, he died. Hematologic and biochemical

analyses during this postoperative period are given
(Table 1),

Laboralory Findings
t On initial examination (Dec. 11), signiﬁcant labora-
Ory ﬁndings were: neutropenia and lymphopenia (With-

out concurrent eosinopenia) , which persisted throughout
the presurgical course; hemoconcentration; high normal
calcium concentration which, when redetermined on
December 14, was found to be increased markedly;
hypophosphatemia; slightly increased blood urea nitro-
gen (BUN) and creatinine concentrations; and moder-
ately increased alkaline phosphatase and glutamic trans-
aminase (GPT) activities. Results of urinalysis on that
day and 3 days later were both indicative of bacterial
cystitis. The urine speciﬁc gravity, although within
normal range, was lower than that expected for a moder-
ately dehydrated dog with normal renal concentrating
ability.

Later, the BUN and creatinine values increased con-
siderably and persisted throughout the rest of the dog’s
life. Urinalysis revealed remission of the bacterial
cystitis; the speciﬁc gravity remained within the normal
range.

Postsurgically, increased BUN and creatinine con-
centrations and hemoconcentration were detected. Fluid
therapy resulted in hemodilution, a reduced urine speciﬁc
gravity (1.010) and a gradual reduction in the BUN con-
centration. Serum calcium content returned to normal
within 48 hours after surgery. Serum phosphorus con-
tent remained normal for the 1st 48 hours after surgery.
then gradually increased. The leukocyte count reached
low normal postsurgically, with a slight regenerative
neutrophil response. Eosinopenia persisted throughout
the postsurgical course, associated With lymphopenia
except in the sample collected after the convulsmn; 1n
this sample the lymphocyte count was normal.

Pathologic Findings

Microscopically, the removed left caudal parathyroid
gland was round, soft, reddish brown and measured 1

was indistinct, being accompanied by solid masses of
active chief cells (Fig. 2). These cells tended to form
palisades around blood vessels. The center of the neo-
plasm also contained a few cystic spaces, some small
foci of calciﬁcation, and scattered areas of histiocytes
laden with hemosiderin (Fig. 3 and 4). The gland was
almost devoid of fat cells. Peripherally there were small
dark chief cells and syncytial cells. The ﬁnal diagnosis
was adenoma of the left caudal parathyroid gland.

On necropsy, the thyroid glands and remaining para-
thyroid glands were removed. The liver contained
multiple nodules of varying size. Both kidneys were
gray, slightly tougher in consistency than normal, and
were moderately shrunken. The skeletal system was
grossly normal with exception of the cranial and facial
bones, which were easily sectioned with a saw blade but
not a knife.

Histologic lesions were conﬁned to the liver, bones,
and kidneys. There was marked resorption of bone and
replacement of ﬁbrous tissue within cranial bones. The
same changes, to a lesser degree were found in long
bones, ribs, and vertebrae. The kidneys had extensive
nephrocalcinosis due to calciﬁcation of the tubular
epithelium and basement membrane (Fig. 5). There
was moderate interstitial ﬁbrosis and focal inﬁltration
of lymphocytes and plasma cells. The liver contained
multiple sites of a bile duct carcinoma. Other organs
and brain were normal.

Pathophysiology

Primary hyperparathyroidism is usually accompanied
by pathologic changes in the skeleton characterized by
increased resorption of osseous tissue and its subsequent
replacement by ﬁbrous tissue.

In the kidneys, hypercalcemia initially leads to a
functional rather than an organic change. The consis-
tently high concentration of calcium ions decreases the
permeability of the distal tubules (and possibly the
collecting ducts) to water and thus reduces medullary
hypertonicity due to loss of sodium.19 These factors

result in a tubular inability to absorb solute-free water
during osmotic loading, With the diuretic effect occurring
irrespective of .the glomerular ﬁltration rate (GFR).
The net effect is usually polyuria that is unresponsive
to antidiuretic hormone. Hypercalcemia also affects the
GFR- In experimental dogs, calcium infusions suﬂicient

associated initially With an Increased GFR and increased
urine production. The (:FR subsequently decreases to a
normal or depressed value.‘~"H When infusions raise
plasma calcium valucs to 20 mg./100 ml. or greater,
circulatory depressmn occurs, leading to a marked de-
crease in GFR.“

Prolonged. hypercalcemia often induces diffuse
nephrocalcinosrs, which leads to an insidious progressive
insufficiency due to proportional decreases in the GFR
and the renal blood flow."-" Such changes are usually
suﬂiciently severe to lead to increased BUN and creatinine
concentrations and decreased excretion of paraamino-
hippurate and phenolsulfonphthalein. These changes in
function often occur before nephrocalcinosis is suﬂiciently
extensive to be diagnosed by radiographic techniquesﬁ’23

Hypercalcemia increases myocardial contractility,
shortens mechanical ventricular systole, and decreases
myocardial automatieity.15 The electrocardiographic
changes include a prolongation of the P-R interval and

caICium concentration was detected after prednisolone
therapy, during which time some of the si
. , gns of hyper-
calcemia (P01yuria and anorexia) had abated. Though
1the hypercalcemia of most hyperparathyroid human pa-
ients is reSistant to cortisol or equivalent corticosteroid
SUppression, a few have a normocalcemic response.14 Per-
haps a Similar corticosteroid suppression occurred in the
dog of this report. Normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism
in human patients is not uncommon and normocalcemia
of randomly collected samples is common even among
patients who usually have increased calcium values.23
However, other investigators state that 99% of all con-
ﬁrmed hyperparathyroidism patients have hypercalcemia,
and a diagnosis of this disease without it is precarious?8
Laboratory error would be a 3rd possibility of a normo-
calcemic value.

After abnormally high concentrations of circulating
parathormone are detected, 3 etiopathologies must be
considered: parathyroid hyperplasia, parathyroid neo-
plasia, and pseudohyperparathyroidism. Antemortem
distinction between primary hyperparathyroidism and
pseudohyperparathyroidism may be difficult, especially
if there are no clinical signs of neoplasia.20 If clinical
signs do not suggest an underlying neoplastic condition,
exploration of the parathyroid glands is warranted. The
surgical approach is easily performed and quickly done,
presenting little risk even to severely ill patients. A com-
parison of all 4 glands should be made before a surgical
diagnosis is attempted. If doubt exists as to whether
generalized hyperplasia exists, one gland may be re-
moved for histologic examination, or as is frequently
done in human medicine, 3 to’3 1A; glands can be removed.

In the dog of this report, one grossly enlarged,
obviously neoplastic gland was found and surgically
removed. Histologic examination conﬁrmed the diagnosis
of parathyroid adenoma. The other parathyroid glands,
when examined after the dog’s death, were conﬁrmed
to be normal histologically.

The ﬁnding of a 2nd pathologic condition along with
primary hyperparathyroidism is not uncommon. InOman,
54% prevalence of accompanying diabetes mellitus17
and 10% prevalence of accompanying thyroid neoplas1a28
have been reported. In the dog of this report, a bile
duct carcinoma presented a severe diagnostic problem.
If the increased serum GPT activity on December 11 had
been considered signiﬁcant, PSGUdOhypeTParathym“113T“
might have been diagnosed. The sustained decrease in

After the source of parathormone overproduction has
a rapid decline in serum calcmm content
decline is usually detectable by
the 16th postoperative hour in human patients and,
indeed, was evident in the dog of this report Within that
period. In one human patient, however, a postsurgical

followed by return to hypercalcemia 2 days later.17

The rapidly progressing nature of hypercalcemic
nephropathy is vividly demonstrated in the dog of this
report. Initial examination (Dec. 11) revealed only
minor increases in serum BUN and creatinine. Thirty-ﬁve
days later the GFR had decreased dramatically, resulting
in increased BUN, serum creatinine, and serum phosphorus
values. A concurrent decrease in tubular function was
manifested by reduced secretion of contrast dyes and
thus decreased renal visualization by intravenous
pyelography.

Postsurgically, the BUN values increased rapidly in
spite of attempts to maintain adequate renal function
via administration of balanced electrolyte solutions and
furosemide during surgery. Similar problems have been
reported among human hyperparathyroid patients.
Within 48 hours after removal of chief cell adenomas, 9
of 14 hyperparathyroid human patients with presurgical
impairment of GFR reportedly had further deterioration
in renal function; in 2 of these 9 patients, deterioration
of renal function occurred in spite of measures to prevent
postoperative oliguria.23 The factors leading to this
complication are not clear. .

Although magnesium values were not determined at
any time during the course of disease, the role of this
cation in hyperparathyroidism needs to be investigated.
The electrocardiographic changes seen in December were
not characteristic of increased myocardial excitability,
as found in experimentally induced hypercalcemia, but
were characteristic of the depressed conduction associ-
ated with hypermagnesemia. On the other hand, hypo-
magnesemia could account for the postsurgical muscle
fasciculations and convulsions. Postsurgically, calcium
content never did reach values that could be expected
to cause convulsions. Indeed, hypomagnesemia has been
reported among hyperparathyroid human patients 5 to
10 days after parathyroid surgery.1

Although primary hyperparathyroidism is a seldom
seen entity in veterinary medicine, its recognition is pos-
sible with little diagnOstic expertise. Surgical correction
is quickly and easily performed, necessitating no special
instrumentation. Rapid surgical correction is imperative,
otherwise initial functional nephropathy rapidly pro-
gresses to an insidious organic nephrocalcinosis.

Brucellosis in Jrhe United States—I972

In 1972, 184 cases of brucellosis in man were reported to the Center
for Disease Control, 6 fewer than in 1971. Only 4 of the cases involved
veterinarians. In 1972, California, Iowa, and Virginia accounted for 44%
of the reported cases, compared with 34% in 1971 and 51% in 1970. The
greatest increase in total case-s (15) was reported by Virginia, whereas
Texas reported the greatest decrease (18).

Contact with swine resulted in 88 human cases (49%) and was the
most common source of human infection. Direct contact with cattle was

responsible for 33 cases (18%); 15 other patients had contact with cattle
and swine—CDC Vet. Pub. Health Notes (Jan., 1974): 2.

Drug Development Program

Parke, Davis & Company, a sub-
sidiary of Warner-Lambert Company,
has received a $1,660,000 government
contract for an anti-cancer drug devel-
opment program. The 3-year contract,

' subject to renewal, and supported by

the National Cancer Institute (NCI) ,
Department of Health, Education and
Welfare, covers 3 areas of research:
a soil sample screening program to ﬁnd
novel antibiotics which will be effective
in the treatment of cancer; production
through fermentation of antibiotics for
clinical study; and development of
product formulations for clinical study.

The program will begin immedi-
ately, with the screening of approx-
imately 2,000 new soil samples from
swamp areas in southern United
States. Each soil sample should yield
approximately 20 to 30 culture ﬁl-
trates, each of which will be screened
in 3 separate laboratory tests—2
against cancer cells and 1 against a
Virus.

Initially, the novel active agents
will be produced by fermentation on
the laboratory scale to conﬁrm antitu-
mor activity and then on a larger pilot
plant scale to enable the chemists to
isolate sufﬁcient material for chemo-
therapeutic studies in animals. Sam-
ples of the most active antibiotics will
be submitted to the NCI for clinical
study. A second phase of the research
program will be to take known anti-
tumor compounds and microbiolog-
ically alter their formula to make them
more available at the site of the cancer
in humans beings.

Since 1946, Parke-Davis research
has been involved in the search for new

L...‘

products isolated from soil samples
gathered from all parts of the world.
The program resulted in 3 possible
anticancer agents in the mid-1950s,
which were tested in the clinics.

Equine Gym, Health Facilities
Otter Top Medical Care
To Track's Horses

A Health Maintenance Organization
for horses? It almost seems like it at
The Meadows, the harness racing track
near Washington, PA, where the pacers
and trotters in residence have access to
whirlpool baths, routine physicals,
x-ray examinations, and a swimming
pool

The track takes good care of its
horses with its peeple-like facilities and
the services of Drs. R. Dean Scogglns
(MSU ’60), E. Wesley Parry (COR
‘68), Jeffrey R. Miller (COR ‘72).
More than 1,000 of harness racing’s
big name horses board here and then
owners see to it that the pre01ous
sulky-pullers take advantage not only
of the medical care but also of the
“Therapeutic Spa,” consisting of the
whirlpool bath and a 50 ft. swimming
pool

If a diagnosis is muscle strain or a
cramp, the horse is recommended for
the whirlpool bath. The whirlpool {1180
is used like human beings use it—-—JuSt
to make the horse feel better.

Although radiology is employed at
the track to diagnose equine mal-
functions, x-rays are also made to
determine if a new horse is mature
enough to commence training.

What about the swimming p001?
Because showers aren’t in use hereaS
yet, after the horse works out, 1t 5
“Everybody into the pool” for a relax—
ing few laps around the 155,000-331-
pool. The horse is led by a long tether
from the trainer who paces around the
edge trying not to get pulled in.

a lot of factors besides price. Here’s how the dog foods on ~ .

Soft—Moist —The Canned Dog Food Without The cans® burgers ’9
Protein: the protein of each is digestible at 9¢
a rrnnimum level of 95%. Nutrition: unlike
some canned dog foods, Gaines provides a
completely balanced diet for all physio—
logical states, including gestation and lacta-
tion. Volume: Gaines low volume (602. vs.
14- 16 for a regular can) makes it possible
for a hospitalized dog with a reduced
appetite to eat less and still get his full
supply of nutrients.
And since Gaines Soft—Moist doesn’t have a can, nobody
has to open cans. Scoop out cans. Throw away cans.
Or deal with garbage cans full of cans.’Gaines cellophane
packages are easy to open and sanitary to dispose of.
Cans? If you don’t need them, why pay for them?

METHODS OF MEDIA PREPARATION FOR THE BIO-
LOGICAL SCIENCES by Joyce A. Stewart, Univ. of
Tennessee, Knoxville. “In—between-the-lines” knowledge of
quality-controlled media is usually learned by trial and
error methods. The techniques and aids offered in this book
go beyond the simple-sounding formulas and directions for
the preparation of media and various related solutions; they
eliminate chances for errors, saving time and waste of
materials. This reference book brings together all the
so—called “standard” formulas in one book and includes
formulas for buffers, stains, reagents and indicators. ’74,

How do you answer these
, questions, doctor ?

We just lost our

  D u c h e s s af t e r

_ whelping 7 puppies.
What in the world

I should they

befed?

Esbilac® is better than cow’s milk for orphan or rejected puppies
because It provides the same ratio of calories from protein, fats and
carbohydrates that puppies would receive from the dam. This replace-
ment for bitch’s milk is also recommended for supplementing the diet
of pregnant and lactating bitches, studs and show dogs.

l\/ly dog’s coat is so dull and dry.
Can you recommend something
to help make it shinier?

Dull, dry coats are sometimes caused by nutritional deficiencies.
Mina-Coat"! nutritional food supplement helps provide the nutrients
needed to maintain a glossy coat and normal, pliable, moisturized
skin. Mirra—Coat contains polyunsaturated fatty acids and vitamins
A, E and Be, in a good-tasting powder to sprinkle over food.

She has completely rejected the
kittens and won’t even nurse them.
What should I feed them?

KMR kitten milk replacer is scientifically patterned after the nutrient
composition of queen’s milk, so it’s the answer when kittens can’t
nurse. Also recommended for supplementing the diet of pregnant and
lactating queens, studs and show animals.

EUSPENSION (Vale! muyx

 

®

,4, calphosan SUSPENSION

(Calcium Glycerophosphate/Calcium Lactate)

FOR LARGE ANIMALS

For dairy cattle, 30 to 60 ml. by deep intramuscular injection is highly
effective in the supportive treatment and prevention of uncomplicated
milk fever, grass tetany, wheat poisoning, ketosis and eclampsia. It
may be used in conjunction with intravenous calcium in more severe
milk fever cases. At calving time, 15 ml. of Calphosan Suspension
serves as an effective pr0phylactic measure.

For horses, 30 ml. of Calphosan Suspension by deep intramuscular
injection (daily for four days) followed by 50 ml. of Calphosan B-12
Solution (intramuscularly for the next four days) usually provides
rapid and complete recovery from muscular stiffness and inflamma-
tion, lassitude, altered vitality, anorexia with loss in weight, and night
blindness. In the treatment of the “tied-up” syndrome, 60 ml. of Cal-
phosan Solution by intramuscular injection (once every two hours) is
highly effective.

For sheep and swine, 15 to 30 ml. of Calphosan Suspension, by deep
intramuscular injection, is highly effective in the treatment of milk
fever, ketosis and eclampsia in ewes and sows.

Availability: Vial of 30 ml., bottle of 240 ml.

Contraindications: Hypercalcemia.

®
Calphosanm...

(Calcium Glycerophosphate/Calcium Lactate)

FOR SMALL ANIMALS

Highly effective in the treatment of canine or feline eclampsia, allergic
manifestations, dermatoses, poisoning, canine distemper, posterior
paralysis and other conditions associated with subnormal serum

levels of calcium.

It may be given intramuscularly, subcutaneously or intravenously.
Intramuscular injection, which produces a longer lasting effect, is
recommended for best results. For immediate therapy in the treatment
of eclampsia or milk fever, use an intravenous injection, supported

with an intramuscular injection.

Recommmended Dosage: 5 to 10 ml.

Availability: Vial of 60 ml., bottle of 125 ml., bottle of 250 ml. Cal-
phosan Solution with 8-12 is available in vials of 60 ml., 10 ml. ampuls
in boxes of 10 or 25 containing 300 mcg. of 8-12 per 10 ml.

Contraindications: Hypercalcemia.

Air Travel Guidelines for Dogs

T An article in the March issue of Consumer Reports, “Should Your Pet
.ravel By Air? implied that, when animals are ﬂown, their chances of sur-
ViVing .the trip are slim.
lUnited All‘lll’leS,.WhiCh carries more pets than any other airline in the
wor d, says that is Simply not true. And any airline that carries about 1,000
pets a week should know.
ach of United’s 362 jets has at least one cargo compartment speciﬁcally
heated and pressurized for the carriage of live animals. The inﬂight tem-
peratures in the compartment vary from 40 to 90 F with a norm of 50 to

peratures ﬂuctuate in unheated
not carried in them.

United offers these tips for safe, comfortable air ﬂight of animals:

. A dog’s, number-one enemy is heat. Heat problems are encountered when
aircraft are subject to long delays on the ground during hot days. Outside air
Will cool the compartments during ﬂight, but there is no way of cooling them
on the ground. During hot summer months, choose late evening or early
morning ﬂights to avoid such a heat build-up problem.

Be certain the. kennel is large enough. United has both purchase and
rental kennels available, but none which will accommodate an animal heavier
than 80 lb. Shippers of larger animals must provide their own kennels.

. Know your dog. Like people, they have different temperaments. An easy-
going dog will usually take a ﬂight well, whereas a nervous dog may become
agitated and try to escape the kennel, harming himself in the process. In con-
sultation with their veterinarians, owners may want to tranquilize an excitable
animal before the ﬂight.

A health certiﬁcate is required, primarily for each animal’s safety, but also
for the protection of any other animal with which it might come into contact.

Pups should not be shipped before they are 6 to 8 weeks old—and only
after weaning. They should also have their distemper inoculations before
shipment.

If possible, let the pet get acquainted with his shipping kennel several
days in advance.

Don’t feed your pet for 6 to 12 hours before departure, but some water
is all right.

Notify the reservations (if the owner is traveling with the pet) or air freight
(if the owner is sending the pet unaccompanied) oﬂice as far in advance of ship-
ment as possible. They will help with details.

Check the pet in early—45 minutes before departure when he is traveling
with the owner, 2 hours before departure when he is traveling as air freight.
When picking up a pet shipped as air freight, allow between 1 and 11/; hours at
the air freight ofﬁce after his ﬂight arrives.

Be certain that names, addresses, and telephone contacts for people who
will be responsible for the pet at both origin and destination cities are clearly
indicated and that those who are to receive the animal have been apprised
of its time and place of arrival.

At the airport, never take a leashed dog on an escalator. Use an elevator
or the stairs. . . , t

Stop and allow the pet to exermse a bit on the way to,. mat, the airpor .

For the pet’s comfort and safety, the owner must place him in the kennel at
the airport and take him out—or arrange to have this done—at the destination.

After the trip, help your pet quietodown. Keep his food and water at a
minimum for at least 2 hours.——Mamlmer (UAL), October , 1973-

Yes. You can recommend
ALPO as a complete and

balanced cl’
lei.
Hem’s Why: Every ALPO product is formulated to pro-

vide a nutritionally complete diet for normal

dogs. And we can prove it. In the laboratory. And in the kennels. By all acceptable
nutritional standards, ALPO is shown to be both complete and balanced. And here’s
who helped us prove it:

2.

3.

THE NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL (NRC), OF THE
NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES.

Every ALPO variety is fortified to meet the nutrient requirements for maintenance and
growth of dogs, as established by the NRC Committee on Animal Nutrition.

THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN FEED CONTROL
OFFICIALS (AAFCO).

ALPO’s substantiation under the AAFCO Protocols, which provide for adequate
testing of nutritional claims, shows that all ALPO products are complete and bal-
anced for dogs...for reproduction, gestation, lactation, growth of puppies, and

maintenance of adult dogs.

INDEPENDENT UNIVERSITY STUDIES.

Long-term nutritional research conducted at independent university laboratories show
that hand-feeding of fortified meat-based formulations as the only source of nourish-
ment over several generations provides satisfactory canine maintenance, growth and.

reproduction.

4. OUR OWN KENNEL TESTS.

At the ALPO Center for Advanced Pet Study, generations of puppies have already
grown to active, healthy maturity. Living proof of ALPO as an exclusnve diet.
