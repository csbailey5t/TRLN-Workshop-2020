0 magnum mysterium, et admirabile “ And suddenly there was . . . a
sacramentum, ut animalia viderent multitude of ‘ the heavenly host
Dominum natum, jacentem in praesepio. praising God. . . . ”—Luke 2, 13.

Fougasse’s earliest Christmas card,
without actually portraying the nativity,
suggests it by the radiance proceeding
from the stable door. The legend under
the drawing may be translated : “ Oh
great mystery, and wonderful sacrament,
that animals should see the Lord born
and lying in a manger.”

The idea of this card was suggested
by the sudden appearance of starlings
at sunset in Trafalgar Square.

All cards are double-fold on good quality white card, size Sin. x 4in.

Miss Rosalind Hill, lecturer in history in the University of
London, describes charmingly the quaint but instructive
thoughts which mediaeval monks, lawyers and others enter-
tained about animals, the queer sort of justice dealt out by
the ecclesiastical courts to fleas and ﬁeld-mice, and saints who
were on the friendliest terms with the most improbable
creatures.

Fougasse has enriched the volume with no fewer than
nineteen new drawings which are deftly harmonized with

the subject matter.

Printed on cartridge paper in stiff boards with coloured
cover, 16 pp. octavo, price 23. 6d., post free. '
