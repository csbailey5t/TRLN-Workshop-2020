The ancient owls’ nest must have burned.
Hastily, all alone,

a glistening armadillo left the scene,
rose-ﬂecked, head down, tail down,

and then a baby rabbit jumped out,
short-cared, to our surprise.

So softl—a handful of intangible ash
with ﬁxed, ignited eyes.

Too pretty, dreamlike mimicry!

O falling ﬁre and piercing cry
and panic, and a weak mailed ﬁst
clenched ignorant against the sky!

Mountain Lion

Climbing through the January snow, into the Lobo canyon
Dark grow the spruce-trees, blue is the balsam, water sounds still
unfrozen, and the trail is still evident.

Men!
Two men!
Men! the only animal in the world to fear!

They hesitate.
We hesitate.
They have a gun.
We have no gun.

Then we all advance, to meet.
Two Mexicans, strangers, emerging out of the dark and snow and

inwardness of the Lobo valley.
What are you doing here on this vanishing trail?

Something yellow.

He smiles, foolishly, as if he were caught doing wrong.
And we smile, foolishly, as if we didn’t know.
He is quite gentle and dark-faced.

Lift up her face,

Her round, bright face, bright as frost.

Her round, ﬁne-fashioned head, with two dead ears;

And stripes in the brilliant frost of her face, sharp, ﬁne dark rays,
Dark, keen, ﬁne eyes in the brilliant frost of her face.

Beautiful dead eyes.

Hermoso es!

They go out towards the open;

We go on into the gloom of Lobo.

And above the trees I foundher lair,-

A hole in the blood-orange brilliant rocks that stick up, a little cave.
And bones, and twigs, and a perilous ascent.

 

 

So, she will never leap up that way again, with the yellow ﬂash of a
mountain lion’s long shoot! '

And her bright striped frost—face will never watch any more, out of the
shadow of the cave in the blood-orange rock,

Above the trees of the Lobo dark valley-mouth!

Instead, I look out.
And out to the dim of the desert, like a dream, never real;

To the snow of the Sangre de Cristo mountains, the ice of the
mountains of Picoris,

And near across at the opposite steep of snow, green trees motionless
standing in snow, like a Christmas toy.

 

 

And I think in this empty world there was room. for me and a mountain
lion.

Hemoso :51] It is beautiful!

 




D. H. LAWRENCE 359

And I think in the world beyond, how easily we might spare a million
or two of humans

And never miss them.

Yet what a gap in the world, the missing white frost-face of that slim
yellow mountain lion!

In the northern hemisphere
Life seems to leap at the air, or skim under the wind

Like stags on rocky ground, or pawing horses, or springy scut-tailed
rabbits.

Or else rush horizontal to charge at the sky’s horizon,
Like bulls or bisons or wild pigs.

As foxes, stoats, and wolves, and prairie dogs.

Only mice, and moles, and rats, and badgers, and beavers, and perhaps

Seem belly-plumbed to the earth’s mid-navel.

Or frogs that when they leap come flop, and flop to the centre of the

But the yellow antipodal Kangaroo, when she sits up,

Who can unseat her, like a liquid drop that is heavy, and just touches
earth.

The downward drip
The down—urge.
So much denser than cold-blooded frogs.

Delicate mother Kangaroo

Sitting up there rabbit-wise, but huge, plump-weighted,

And lifting her beautiful slender face, oh! so much more gently and
ﬁnely lined than a rabbit’s, or than a hare’s,

Lifting her face to nibble at a round white peppermint drop which she
loves, sensitive mother Kangaroo.

Her sensitive, long, pure-bred face.
Her full antipodal eyes, so dark,

So big and quiet and remote, having watched so many empty dawns in
silent Australia.

Her little loose hands, and drooping Victorian shoulders.

And then her great weight below the waist, her vast pale belly

With a thin young yellow little paw hanging out, and straggle of a long
thin ear, like ribbon,

Like a funny trimming to the middle of her belly, thin little dangle of
an immature paw, and one thin ear.

Her belly, her big haunches
And, in addition, the great muscular python-stretch of her tail.

There, she shan’t have any more peppermint drops.

So she wistfully, sensitively sniffs the air, and then turns, goes off in
slow sad leaps

While something stirs quickly in her belly, and a lean little face comes
out, as from a window,

Peaked and a bit dismayed,

Only to disappear again quickly away from the sight of the world, to
snuggle down in the warmth,

Leaving the trail of a different paw hanging out.

Still she watches with eternal, cocked wistfulness!

How full her eyes are, like the full, fathomless, shining eyes of an
Australian black-boy

Who has been lost so many centuries on the margins of existence!

She watches with insatiable wistfulness.

Untold centuries of watching for something to come,

For a new signal from life, in that silent lost land of the South.

Where nothing bites but insects and snakes and the sun, small life.
Where no bull roared, no cow ever lowed, no stag cried, no leopard
screeched, no lion coughed, no dog barked,

But all was silent save for parrots occasionally, in the haunted blue
bush.

Wistfully watching, with wonderful liquid eyes.

And all her weight, all her blood, dripping sack-wise down towards the
earth’s centre,

And the live little-one taking in its paw at the door of her belly.

Leap then, and come down on the line that draws to the earth’s deep,
heavy centre.

And I wish that the baby would tack across here to me
Like a wind-shadow running on a pond, so she could stand
With two little bare white feet upon my knee

And I could feel her feet in either hand

Cool as syringa buds in morning hours,
Or firm and silken as young peony ﬂowers.

Piano

Softly, in the dusk, a woman is singing to me;

Taking me back down the vista of years, till I see

A child sitting under the piano, in the boom of the tingling strings

And pressing the small, poised feet of a mother who smiles as she sings.

In spite of myself, the insidious mastery of song

Betrays me back, till the heart of me weeps to belong

To the old Sunday evenings at home, with winter outside
And hymns in the cozy parlor, the tinkling piano our guide.

So now it is vain for the singer to burst into clamor

With the great black piano appassionato. The glamour

Of childish days is upon me, my manhood is cast

Down in the ﬂood of remembrance, I weep like a child for the past.

A snake came to my water-trough
On a hot, hot day, and I in pajamas for the heat,
To drink there.

In the deep, strange-scented shade of the great dark carob-tree

I came down the steps with my pitcher '

And must wait, must stand and wait, for there he was at the trough before
me.

He reached down from a fissure in the earth—wall in the gloom '

And trailed his yellow-brown slackness soft-bellied down, over the edge of
the stone trough " - - 1

And' rested his throat upon the stone bottom,

And where the water had dripped from the tap, in a small clearness,

He sipped with his straight month, »

Softly drank through his straight gums, into his slack long body,

Silently. .

Someone was before me at my water-trough,
And I, like a second comer, waiting. '

He lifted his head from his drinking, as cattle do,

And looked at me vaguel , as drinking cattle do, .
And ﬂickered his two-forked tongue from his lips, and mused a moment, "
And stooped and drank a little more,
Being earth-brown, earth-golden from the burning bowels of the earth .
On the day of Sicilian July, with Etna smoking.

Snake

The voice of my education said to me
He must be killed,

For in Sicily the black, black snakes are innocent, the gold are venomous.

And voices in me said, If you were a man
You would take a stick and break him now, and ﬁnish him off.

But must I confess how I liked him,

How glad I was he had come like a guest in quiet, to drink at my water-
trough

And depart peaceful, pacified, and thankless,
Into the burning bowels of this earth?

Was it cowardice, that I dared not kill him?
Was it perversity, that I longed to talk to him?
Was it humility, to feel so honored?

I felt so honored.

And yet those voices:
If you were not afraid, you would kill him!

And truly I was afraid, I was most afraid,
But even so, honored still more

That he should seek my hospitality

From out the dark door of the secret earth.

He drank enough

And lifted his head, dreamily, as one who has drunken,

And ﬂickered his tongue like a forked night on the air, so black,
Seeming to lick his lips,

‘And looked around like a god, unseeing, into the air,

And slowly turned his head,

And slowly, very slowly, as if thrice adream,

Proceeded to draw his slow length curving round

And climb again the broken bank of my wall-face.

And as he put his head into that dreadful hole,

And as he slowly drew up, snake-easing his shoulders, and entered farther,
A sort of horror, a sort of protest against his withdrawing into that horrid

black hole,

eliberately going into the blackness, and slowly drawing himself after,
vercame me now his back was turned.

I looked round, I put down my pitcher,
I picked up a clumsy log
threw it at the water-trough with a clatter.

I think it did not hit him,

And I thought of the albatross1
And I wished he would come back, my snake.

For he seemed to me again like a king,
ike a king in exile, uncrowned in the underworld,
Now due to be crowned again.

And so, I missed my chance with one of the lords
Of life.

And I have something to expiate;

A pettiness.

Elemental

Why don’t people leave off being lovable
Or thinking they are lovable, or wanting to be lovable,
And be a bit elemental instead?

Since man is made up of the elements
Fire, and rain, and air, and live loam
And none of these is lovable
But elemental,
an is lop-sided on the side of the angels.

I wish men would get back their balance among the elements

And be a bit more ﬁery, as incapable of telling lies

I am sick of lovable people,
Somehow they are a lie.

Self-Protection

When science starts to be interpretive
It is more unscientiﬁc even than mysticism.

A nightingale singing at the t0p of his voice

Is neither hiding himself nor

He is giving himself away in every sense of the word;
And obviously, it is the culminating point of his existence.
A tiger is striped and golden for his own glory. "

He would certainly be much more invisible if he were gray-green a

Green Snake, when I hung you round my neck
and stroked your cold, pulsing throat
as you hissed to me, glinting
arrowy gold scales, and I felt
the weight of you on my shoulders,
and the whispering silver of your dryness
sounded close at my ears——

Green Snake—I swore to my companions that certainly
you were harmless! But truly
I had no certainty, and no hope, only desiring
to hold you, for that joy,
which left
a long wake of pleasure, as the leaves moved
and you faded into the pattern

I, Sylvia, tell you, my piglets:

it has been given me _

to spend a whole day up to my snout
in the velvet wetness that is mud:

and to walk undriven, at dusk,
back to the human-house
and be welcomed there:

welcomed by humans and cats and dogs,
not reproached for my mantle
of graying mud:

welcomed, and given to eat

a food of human magic, resembling mud
and tasting

of bliss: and its holy name

is chocolate.

I, Sylvia, your mother,
have known
the grace of pig-joy.

Come into Animal Presence

Come into animal presence.

No man is so guileless as

the serpent. The lonely white
rabbit on the roof is a star

twitching its ears at the rain.

The llama intricately

folding its hind legs to be seated
not disdains but mildly

disregards human approval.

What joy when the insouciant
armadillo glances at us and doesn’t
quicken his trotting

across the track into the palm brush.

What is this joy? That no animal

falters, but knows what it must do?

That the snake has no blemish,

that the rabbit inspects his strange surroundings
in white star-silence? The llama -

rests in dignity, the armadillo

has some intention to pursue in the palm-forest.
Those who were sacred have remained so,
holiness does not dissolve, it is a presence

of bronze, only the sight that saw it

faltered and turned from it.

An old joy returns in holy presence.

A POEM FOR TRAPPED THINGS

This morning with a blue ﬂame burning

this thing wings its way in.

Wind shakes the edges of its yellow being.
Gasping for breath.

Living for the instant

Climbing up the black border of the window.
Why do you want out.

I sit in pain

A red robe amid debris,

You bend and climb, extending antennae.

I know the butterﬂy is my soul
and weak from battle.

A giant fan on the back of

a beetle.
A caterpillar, chrysalis that seeks
a new home apart from this room.

And will disappear from sight

at the pulling of invisible strings.

Yet so tenuous, so ﬁne

this thing is, I am

sitting on the hard bed, we could

vanish from sight like the puff

off an invisible cigarette.

Furred chest, ragged silk under
wings beating against the glass

no one will open.

The blue diamonds on your back
are too beautiful to do
away with.
I watch you
all morning
long
With my hand over my mouth.

 




 

This is the time of year

when almost every night

the frail, illegal ﬁre balloons appear.
Climbing the mountain height,

rising toward a saint

still honored in these parts,

the paper chambers ﬂush and ﬁll with light
that comes and goes, like hearts.

Once up against the sky it’s hard

to tell them from the stars-

, planets, that is—the tinted ones: *
Venus going down, or Mars,

 

 

or the pale green one. With a wind,
they ﬂare and falter, wobble and toss;
but if it’s still they steer between

the kite sticks of the Southern Cross,

receding, dwindling, solemnly
and steadily forsaking us, i

or, in the downdraft from a peak,
suddenly turning dangerous.

Last night another big one fell.

It Splattered like an egg of ﬁre

against the cliE behind the house.

The ﬂame ran down. We saw the pair .

of owls who nest there ﬂying up

and up, their whirling black-and-white
stained bright pink underneath, until

NOT A DEAD-MOUSE POEM

Moving a dresser in my
half-done home, I met

the md%e who'd been munching
my bread and granola,

in the bottom drawer.

She was curled in a nest

of fiberglass insylation;

her three furry infants

dangled from her nipples

when she dashed away from light.

In my mind were poems

about mother mice in drawers
leaving or eating their babies:
I tried to catch them all

but the mother ran away,
across the floor out a hole.

I put the now squealing
blind ones in a pan

under the house with cheese
to tempt the mother back.

I heard her come and go,

went outside to look.

She jumped out of the pan,
empty except for cheese.

She'd already moved the babies
and was coming back for a meal.

CARL MILLER

 




THE BABY BIRDS

Six weeks the baby birds

quuatted in their nest,
COmfortable as pillows
While mama disappeared

‘ And reappeared, .

Her beak thick with worm.

Down the stretched throat

She tWeezered each piece.

Not until every fluted mouth had silenced
.And every blueberry eye had closed

Did she sleep,

Feather overlapping feather

Over the ugly birthcoats of her children.’

But today is different.

Her eyes bulge like the jewels of idols.
Her talons tuck under her, -

Two empty meatnhooks. .

She swoops from branch to branch~

‘ While her children cower.l ._
'They bunch against each other like kittens.
They squeal like pigs. -

_ Their mother has become a strange god.
.-She brings them the sky.

The lamb mi used breeds.public strife
And yet forgives the butchers knife.
He who shall hurt the little wren
Shall never be beloved by men.
He who the OX to wrath has moved
Shall never be by women loved.
The wanton boy who kills the fly
Shall feel the spider's enmity.
Kill not the 10th or Butterfly
For the Last Judgement draweth nigh.

Where are my people
where are they all

did they get lost

to disease did they fall

I have no brothers

no people at all

but you knew this before
for I am a vhale

The harpoon shoots

it explodes on touch

they may stop killing later
by then it won't matter much

The song of the whale

a swimming song

listen to it now

for you won't hear it long

Epilogue-- future voices:
"Once my children

es swimming in the sea
magnificent

 




HUDSON’S GEES

. . I have, from time to time, ‘related some incident
of my boy/100d, and these are contained in various
chapters in The Naturalist in La Plata, Birds and
Man, Adventures among Birds. . . . "

W. H. Hudson, in Far Away and Long Ago.

Hudson tells us of them,
the two migrating geese,
she hurt in the wing
indomitably walking

the length of a continent,
and he wheeling above,
calling his distress.

They could not have lived.
Already I see her wing
scraped past the bone

as she drags it through rubble.
A fox, maybe, took her

in his snap jaws. And what
would he do, the point

of his circling gone?

The wilderness of his cry
falling through an air
turned instantly to winter
would warn the guns of him.
If a fowler dropped him,
let it have been quick,
pellets hitting brain

and heart so his weight
came down senseless,

and nothing but his body
to enter the dog’s mouth.
