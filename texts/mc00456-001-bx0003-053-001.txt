TRAPPED RABBITS.

“ Thousands 'of Rabbits. are caught in steel traps
during the evening,” writes .a correspondent to a
well known Newspaper, “ their limbs are shattered
and all night they linger in agony.”

 

 

You can help to put an end to this cruelty.

REFUSE TO EAT OR‘BUY
TRAPPED RABBITS.

Animals whose broken or lacerated limbs,
swollen ’heads or bulging eyes tesrify to the
agony which, they have endured while caught
in the steel-toothed traps or ordinary wire
snares. -

 

 

People eat game that has been shot, yet
some have a foolish prejudice against shot ~
rabbits-whose ﬂesh must be more wholesome
than that of a Creature , caught and killed in
agony.

Tell your Poulterers that you will no
longer encourage the cruelty, get your
friends to do so also, and the present barbarous
methods of supplying the poulterers. will
soon cease.

Use your inﬂuence with landOwners, farmers
and others only to use a Humane Snare such
as is advertised overleaf.
