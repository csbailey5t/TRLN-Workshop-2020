Centennial Celebrations Set High
Mark in Public Relations

The 100th Annual Convention of the
AVMA climaxes a year of nationwide fes-
tive centennial celebrations.

Local and state associations, together
with the national Association in Chicago
conducted throughout 1963 an array of
versatile activities and programs to pay
special tribute to the 100th anniversary
of the AVMA. Luncheons and dinners,
conventions, special exhibits, radio and
TV programs were among the major proj—
ects successfully undertaken by the pro-
fession in observing a century of progress
in veterinary medical science.

- National, state, and local government
leaders called attention to the achieve-
ments of veterinary medicine with procla-
mations and congratulatory messages.

- Leading newspapers and magazines
throughout the nation proclaimed veteri-
nary medicine’s 100 years,of achievement
through editorials and feature stories.

0 Radio and television stations brought
before the public the dynamic proﬁle of a
dedicated profession.

- Leading medical and scientiﬁc publica-
tions commended veterinary medicine for
its signiﬁcant contributions to the scien-
tiﬁc contributions to the scientiﬁc commu—
nity.

But this did not just happen—Early in
1962, the staff at AVMA headquarters,
the local arrangements committee in New
York, the AVMA’s Centennial Planning
Committee, and local and state associa—
tions throughout the country began plan-

AVMA Favors Modiﬁed Version

of Fogarty-Roberts Bills

If legislation concerning humane treat-
ment of experimental animals proves
necessary, the House of Delegates voted
Sunday, July 28, to support a modiﬁed
version of the Fogarty and Roberts bills,
H.R. 4840* and H.R. 4843. These identi‘
cal bills are the most constructive of any
introduced, the Executive Board reported,
because speciﬁc responsibility for pro-
duction of standards of animal care» and
compliance is placed upon two scientiﬁc
agencies of the government, the National
Institutes of Health and USDA. A weak-
ness of the bills is their lack of provision
for ﬁnancial support for training re-
search personnel and for physical facili-
ties for humane care of experimental
animals. The AVMA voted to support a
version of the bills which would include
these provisions.

In further action on the subject of hu-
mane treatment of experimental animals,
the delegates voted that support be ex-
tended for the Self-Accreditation Pro—
gram of the Animal Care Panel and the
training program of the American Col-
lege of Laboratory Animal Medicine.
They voted to oppose the bills S. '533
(Clark, Neuberger, and Young), S. 1041
(Randolph), H.R. 4620' (Ashley, former
Grifﬁths bill). and H.R. 4856 (Randall,
former Moulder bill).

 

New AVMA Foundation

A gift grant totaling $215,000 was pre—
sented to the new AVMA Foundation by

tennial Convention, Tuesday, July 30. In

nor, representing the Merck & Company,
Inc.,, said the money will be provided in
the amounts of $5,000 a year for the next
5 years and may be used for postgraduate
fellowships for potential teachers, summer
research fellowships, or other fellowships
related to veterinary medicine.

The Merck 'Co. Foundation, which gave
the grant, is the philanthropic agency of
the Merck & Company, Inc.

Public Relations—from page 1

ning in earnest for the Centennial year.

The national ofﬁce prepared a Centen—
nial kit to help constituent and local vet—
erinary medical associations conduct a va—
riety of Centennial projects. The kits were
mailed to all state secretaries, veterinary
publications, selected individuals, and pub-
lic relations ﬁrms representing veterinary
medical associations.

Other activities included the develop-
ment of a three-color Centennial sticker
designed to be used on members’ station-
ery; the planning of a Centennial exhibit;
the selection of a souvenir medallion; and
the production of 4 one-minute public
service spot announcements for showing
on television stations across the country.

In 1963, the AVM’A’s department of
public information began distributing a
series of news releases and feature mate-
rial intended to acquaint local and na-
tional communications media with the
story of veterinary medicine. As time for
the Centennial convention drew near, per-
sonal contact was made with newspaper,
television, radio and other media repre-
sentatives in New York to insure maxi—
mum coverage of convention activities
during the meeting.

Climax of public relations activities
were the proclamations by President Ken-
nedy and Governor Rockefeller naming
the week of July 28-August 2, Veterinary
Medicine Week.

 

Excerpts from Dr. Anderson’s Address to the House of Delegates

0 I recommend that we take immediate steps to remunerate
the president. . . . We have now reached the point in development
where . . . the duties of the president as chief administrative
ofﬁcer of the Association will of necessity become broader and
more exacting. . If adequate remuneration. were provided,
more people would be willing to serve.

0 The Board of Governors recommends establishment of. . .
a Department of Veterinary Economics. We hope this Will be
accomplished before Jan. 1, 1964.

0 Policy in many instances may be a little hard to establish,
but in most instances it can be . . . recorded. . . . When someone speaks in Wash—
ington or Fort Worth or Miami or anywhere and says they are speaking for AVMA.———
that is our policy—let’s make sure it is.

0 I recommend that arrangements be made for a team consisting of a pharma-
cologist, large animal practitioner, and small animal practitioner be sent to the AMA.
annual convention to study the scientiﬁc exhibits . . . and to screen and recommend
newer drugs, information, instruments, etc., that might well be applicable to veteri—
nary medicine.

0 In regard to housing, I recommend that . . . we remain in Chicago and continue
to rent.
0 I recommend further study be made of publishing a newspaper. . . . Papers thT-ji

do not meet the standards of the Journals, such as clinical evaluation of dr‘ugfsi.
practice tips, new techniques, and many others, might be of great interest especially
to practitioners. These could be used in the newspaper.

- I recommend the ofﬁce of vice-president be eliminated.

Excerpts from Dr. Knowles Address at the Plenary Session

0 Continuing Education—I think it is signiﬁcant that of three
papers read at the AVMA’s ﬁrst convention 100 years ago, two dealt
with veterinary education. The improvement of veterinary educa-
tion was the major concern of the men who founded the AVMA.
The continuing education of the graduate veterinarian is the only
satisfactory solution to the problem of keeping up with the
wealth of new scientiﬁc material that almost daily becomes avail-
able. . . . We must provide postgraduate education courses on an
organized basis . . . in places easily accessible to men who ﬁnd
it difficult to get away from busy practices. . . . It .is my hope
that you will assist me and the AVMA to achieve concrete results in our efforts to
make continuing education an integral part of the activities or organized veterinary
medicine.

0 Specialization—We should encourage any trend and all efforts that lead to in-
creasing specialization within the profession. We have grown in 100 years from a
profession preoccupied with the treatment of one animal species to a profession
legitimately concerned with problems such as the effects of radiation on living beings;
interpretation of space ﬂight data; air pollution; the feeding of astronauts; the
standard of developing nations . . . even the health of man.

0 Career Recruitment—I am happy to note that we have made substantial
progress in our recruitment efforts. We are not only continuing these efforts, but we
are also trying new approaches aimed primarily at the junior high school level.

0 Veterinary Economics—Anticipation of future requirements is not irresponsible
guesswork. It is based on the sober evaluation of available facts and ﬁgures. . . . The
requirements of a changing economy, which deeply affect the basic concepts of our
traditional free enterprise system, make it mandatory that the AVMA here and
now provide its membership with a better understanding of modern veterinary eco—
nomics. . . . I believe that the adequate management of veterinary economics requires
that We set up a department of veterinary economics at AVMA headquarters.

0 Budget—To restrict Association affairs in order to ﬁt the requirements of a
rigid, unﬂexible budget would eventually put us into a strait-Jacket that .would
leave no room for expansion and progress to meet the needs of the membership and
the demands of society on organized veterinary medicine.

 

Excerpts of Governor’s Address at the Plenary Session

Recognition of the veterinarian’s role has reached deep into our society because he
contributes to public health—to the strength of our economy—to the advancement
of pure and applied research—and, at the level of private practices, because hls
activities are close to the human heart.

The veterinarian is not only concerned with the 581 million head of livestock and
poultry in the United States and with its 62 million pets. He also is deeply involved
in protecting the health of our nation’s 188 million men, women, and children.

In reviewing the program for this 100th anniversary meeting, I was impressed
by the emphasis that is given to research. I consider it signiﬁcant that 4 of your 16
sessions are devoted exclusively to research, that research is stressed in the other
sessions, that the affiliated groups meeting with you also have comprehensive research
programs.

Research is one of the strong foundations of the veterinary tradition. In 1863,
when you held your ﬁrst meeting, research was beginning to recognize that some
diseases were common to animals and man.

In 1884, one of your great veterinary pioneers, Frank S. Billings, published a
text in which he gave serious attention to the relationship between many animal
diseases—anthrax, tuberculosis, glanders, and others—and public health problems.

French veterinarians discovered tetanus and diphtheria toxoids. The discovery that
cattle fever was transmitted by ticks was a forerunner to the conquest of three
terrible scourges of the 19th century—yellow fever, malaria, and tick-borne typhus.

A veterinarian solved the mystery of botulism food poisoning, leading to improved
standards in the canned food industry.

A veterinarian discovered that carbon tetrachloride was a practical treatment for
hookworm .in man as well. as in animals.

I thank you for asking me to be with you and—vastly more important—thank you
for your contributions to our society.

 

Association, I wish to extend a cordial in—
vitation, to the AVMA, its officers, and its
membership to the First Congress of Vet—
erinary Medicine of Central American
and Panama to be held in Panama City,
March 4-7, 1964.

I share the hopes of our panamanian
friends that many of our North Ameri—
can. convides will take this opportunity
to visit Panama—C. A. Gleiser, Lt. COL,
V.C., Veterinary Ari/visor, US. Army
Mission to Panama.

Animals, May 25, in Chicago. Dr. L. Meyer
Jones (ISU 39), d11ecto1 of scientiﬁc activi-
ties of the AVMA, 1ep1esented the AVMA,
and Dr. W. T. S. Thorp (MSU ’35), dean of
the University of Minnesota College of Vet-
erinary Medicine, represented the Associa-
tion of State Universities and Land-Grant
Colleges.

The 3 other medical organizations that
sent representatives to the Task Force
meeting at the invitation of the AMA were:
American Hospital Association, Association
of American Medical Colleges, and National
Society for Medical Research. The mission
of the organization, as delineated by the
AMA, was discussed and clarified by repre-

sentatives of the 6 medical groups.

This mission is: (1) to consider legislative
proposals currently before Congress on the
subject of humane care of animals used for
experimental purposes, (2) to insure pres-
entation of testimony that will be effective
at Congressional hearings in preventing pas-
sage of undesirable legislation, and (3) to
stimulate formulation of a report (“white
paper”) that will describe progress being
made voluntarily by institutions toward
improvement of animal care and will, there-
fore, indicate that federal regulation is not
needed.

Members agreed that a valuable function
of Task Force, which distinguishes it from
the National Society for Medical Research, is
to offer an opportunity for an exchange of
information among representatives of key
organizations interested in animal care. A
2nd meeting was scheduled for this summer.

North Dakota V.M.A. Holds 58th
Annual Meeting on Historic Day

Starting its 58th annual meeting on June
9 in Minot, N. Dak., the North Dakota
V.M.A. was reminded by Dr. Dan Anderson,
president of the AVMA, of the historical
signiﬁcance of this date to veterinary med-
icine. “You are meeting on the very birth-
day of organized veterinary medicine,” he
said. “It was on this date exactly 100 years
ago that a group of veterinary surgeons
met in the stately Astor House in New York
to establish the American Veterinary Medi—
cal Association.”

Dear 811‘:

Your item ”Researchers Warned about AW? has come to our

4 attention. ‘We Saw this item when it firSt came eat in one of the

National Society for Medical Research publications but did not pay

, much attention to it as the N. S. N .R. so frequently makes false

‘- charges against us. However, your publication has not, _to my ~
‘knowledge'made such charges before, and se*Ne assume that you Nant'

to publish facts rather than f1ction. For this reason, I am an-

closing a copy of the sopplement to our manual llComfortable

Quarters for Laboratory Animals”, to which the N. S. N .R. Narning

wrefers. In order to get the material for this supplement, Ne

-obViously have to write to laboratories for information on new

-animal quarters. I trust that you will agree this is a useful

-group of plans and pictures to make available without charge to

laboratories. The whole manual is considerably more extensive,'

and if you are interested in having the whole thing, we'll be

glad to send it to You, and I hope that you will be fair enough

to explain to your readers the error you made in printihg the

'N S. N. R. warning. , . , _

, For your information, I am also enclosing the  listing of
-other materials made available free or atI cost to scientivfic~ institutions.‘

I In addition to our educational work, Ne support legis-
lation.for the humane treatment of eXperimental animals which the

N .S. M.R. Opposes.- They have a right to oppose the legislation if

they want to; They do not have the right to spread false State-u

" ments about the Nork of the Animal Welfare Institute. If you

~_Nould like to have full information abodt the lIegislation which

is Sound and moderate and which is strongly approved by scientists
who work under similar legislation in. Britain, Ne will be glad to
send it to you. ‘ '

I hope this Nilnl' make it possible for you to clear up the
record and to free your readers of the mortﬂdly suspicious and
frequently inaccurate statements  0£ the N. S. N.R.

AVMA A call _f_‘_g_r__ closer ties between Specialized veteri—
Stresses nary groups and the AVMA was issued by Dr. H. E.
Unﬂy Kingman, AVMA executive secretary at the annual
meeting o_f the American Association g_f_ Eguine
Practitioners in Chicago on December 3.

Dr. Kingman proposed a degree of integration
among specialty groups and AVMA which leaves spe-
cialty groups with the full responsibility and
freedonlto do what they'are best qualified to do,
while letting the AVMA assist them in matters a
national association is best qualified to handle.

 

 

Profession T__he Animal Welfare Institute slapped the veterinary
hwuhed profession full Ln the face when they branded the
testimon ny10fL Dr. L_ Meyer Jones of the AVMA staff
before a hearing on —experimental animal legislation
as pseudo— scientific and patronizing.

Appearing before an investigating group headed
by Representative Kenneth Roberts, pertinent to
H.R. 1957 and H.R. 3556, Dr. Jones said that persons
utilizing animals in experimental work must be
permitted to conduct their experiments as they
feel proper. In heaping personal abuse on Dr.
Jones, this antivivisectionist group automatically
challenged the integrity of the veterinary pro—
fession and must be dealt with accordingly.

Dear Mrs. Bailey:

It is in fact unlawful to treat animals cruelly. It is also unlawful
to treat children cruelly. It is probable that there is as much
cruelty to children by parents as to animals by experimenters. It
depends on how you define cruelty. An exasperated parent strikes the
child with the intention of hurting it. The experimenter operates on
the animal with intention of finding out something about disease or
normal physiology, but protects the animal from pain as much as he can,
because: (1) the animal’s suffering "gets under his skinn and (2)

the animal's physiological reaction to pain makes it by that much ab—
normal and could conceivably influence the outcome of the experiment.
Those statements are by conviction on the basis of everyday experience,
but I have no scientific observational statistics to give you.

In order to insure that children are humanely treated (using your
words), we'd have to put an inspector in every home. In order to
insure that animals are humanely treated, some tender-hearted persons
are ready to fill every experimenter's life full of paper work and
maybe go to the trouble and expense of inspectors as well. Animal
experimentation is hard enough work as it is.

Sincerely,

‘~__

Why AVMA Says No to Proposed Federal

Legislation on Humane Care of Laboratory Animals

Proponents of legislation to establish
federal supervision of research projects
using laboratory animals are intensifying
their efforts to obtain widespread support.

The 87th Congress having failed to act
on three nearly identical bills dealing with
the humane care of experimental animals, it
seems certain that the bills will be reintro-
duced in the current congressional session.

Typical of the campaign methods is a
circular published by'the Society for Ani-
mal Protection Legislation, an agency of
the Animal Welfare Institute-speciﬁcally
created to publicize and promote federally
legislated care of experimental animals.

Addressed “To Humanitarians,” the cir-
cular of Oct. 16, 1962, contains the follow-
ing request: » ,

“Next time you have an opportunity to
talk with a veterinarian, ask him if he does

.not think that laboratories should be in—-

spected and persons experimenting on ani-
mals licensed, so that decent humane stand-
ards can be enforced. If he would like addi-

.-tional information about-the legislation, let

us know.”

Humaneness—Yes; Federal Regulatione—No

If a humanitarian 'should ask you these
questions, the AVMA suggests that you
express your unqualiﬁed agreement with
those provisions in the legislation which
advocate humane care of experimental ani-

UFebruury l, 1963

mals and, at the same time, express your
unqualiﬁed objection to the provisions call-
ing for federal regulation of animal experi-
mentation and the establishment of a fed-
eral agency (headed. by a nonscientist) to
supervise and enforce humane care.

The provisions which every veterinarian
can and must support deal with matters
such as adequate housing, sanitation, light-
ing, feeding, the use of anesthetics, and
record keeping. These acceptable provisions,
however, were only one half of the proposed
legislation; it was the other, objectionable,
half which made the entire legislative
proposal unacceptable to the profession.

What the Bills Proposed

Because apparently many veterinarians
are inadequately informed about the issues
at stake, a review of the bills and AVMA’s
position concerning federally legislated hu-
mane treatment of animals seems appro-
priate.

The purpose of the three bills, on which
the controversy over the humane treatment
of experimental animals centers, was “to
provide for the humane treatment of animals
used in experiments and tests by recipients
of grants from the United States and by
agencies and . instrumentalities of the
United States Government and for other
purposes.” . ' -

Two of the bills—known to the profession
as the Cooper-Griffiths bills—were ﬁrst

293

 

 

 




 

 

 

 

introduced at the 2nd session of the 86th
Congress in 1960. In 1961, two similar
bills were introduced in the House of Rep-
resentatives by Morgan M. Moulder (D.,
Mo.) and Mrs. Martha W. Griffiths (D.,
Mich). A companion bill was introduced in
the Senate by Joseph S. Clark, Jr. (D., Pa.)
and Mrs. Maurine B. Neuberger (D., Ore.).
Under Mrs. Griffiths’ bill, no scientist
could obtain funds from any government
agency for research in which experimental
- animals are to be used unleSs he held a
certiﬁcate issued by the Secretary of
Health, Education, and Welfare. The bill
stipulated that the Secretary would, pursu-
ant to such rules and regulations as he may
prescribe, issue certiﬁcates of compliance to
persons applying for them provided the
applicant’s proposed methods and proce-
dures in the use of live animals were in ac-
cordance with those recommended in the
bill, and that his personnel and facilities
were adequate and appropriate to enable
him to comply with the bill.
’ Here is a summary of the major methods
and procedures the bill would have required
scientists to comply with:

1) Adequate housing, sanitation, light-
ing, temperature control, ventilation, and
exercise facilities shall be supplied for ex-
perimental animals.

2) Animals shall receive adequate food
and water and shall not be caused to suffer
unnecessary or avoidable pain through neg-
lect or mishandling. ‘ .

3) Animals used in an experiment that
would cause pain shall be anesthetized, ex-
cept' to the extent that the use of anes-
thetics would frustrate the object of the
experiment. Animals suffering severe and
prolonged pain shall be painlessly killed,
unless the project-plan on ﬁle with the
Secretary speciﬁes a longer period during
which animals must be kept alive for essen-
tial purposes of the experiment or test.

4) An accurate record 'shall be maintained
of all experiments and tests performed.

5) No experiment on, living animals
shall be conducted unless a project-plan is
on ﬁle with the Secretary describing the
nature and purposes of the project and the
procedures to be employed.

6) An annual report and such additional
reports 0r information as the Secretary
may require by regulation or individual re-
quest shall be submitted to the Secretary.

294

7) Authorized representatives of the
Secretary shall be given access to the ani-
mals and to the premises and books and
records of the research workers to admin-
ister the bill, and these representatives shall
be authorized to destroy or require the
destruction of animals in accordance with
rules, regulations, or instructions issued by
the Secretary. .

Mrs. Griffiths’ bill also gave the Secre-
tary of Health, Education, and Welfare
authority to reject any project-plan that he
determined did not conform with the bill.
However, the Secretary was to provide a
reasonable opportunity for the person ﬁling
the plan to submit its justiﬁcation.

The bill introduced by Representative
Moulder was similar to Mrs. Griffiths’ in
most respects. However, instead of dele-
gating responsibility for the administration
of the program to the Secretary of Health,
Education, and Welfare, Representative
Moulder’s bill aimed to create an Agency
for Laboratory Animal Control. The com-
missioner (a nonscientist) of this agency
was to be appointed by the President, with
senatorial approval, for a period of ﬁve
years. ,

The Senate bill, introduced by Senators
Clark and N euberger, was identical to Mrs.
Griffiths’ bill in the House.

How Valid Is the, Issue?

The supporters of such proposed legisla-
tion are the Animal Welfare Institute, a
New York-based organization devoted to
securing passage of the bills, and the
Humane Society of the United States,
Washington, D.C., which should not be con-
fused with the American Humane Associa-
tion in Denver, Colo.

These groups contend, and widely publi-
cize their contention, that care given to
animals in research laboratories is careless
and negligent, and that research methods
practiced on these animals are cruel.

They ignore the fact brought out by Dr.
William Dolowy (D.V.M.), administrator of
the University of Illinois Medical Research
Laboratory, in a recent issue of All Pets
Magazine that, “We (scientists) go to such
lengths to care for our animal subjects cer-
tainly for humanitarian reasons, but also
for good practical scientiﬁc reasons. The
success of our work depends upon prevent-
ing extraneous factors from misleading our

research. It is actually more economical to
have excellent laboratory animal care be-
cause it increases the efficiency and produc-
tivity of our search for new knowledge with
which to save lives.”

They also ignore the lack of unanimity
within humane organizations on the ques—
tion of how legislation or even if legislation
could achieve their goals. As recently as last
September, the American Humane Associa—
tion at its annual convention stated that no
action shall be taken by AHA at this time
regarding the legislation; and that a stand-
ing committee should be appointed to ex-
plore all phases of this subject. This action
was taken after an AHA committee had
met with the chief proponent of the legisla-
tion and recommended certain changes in
the bill. The proponent would not accept
any changes recommended by AHA.

The Animal Welfare Institute’s efforts to
obtain testimony in favor of the bills from
veterinarians seem to have been effective.
A veterinarian recently wrote a letter to the
AVMA containing the following paragraph :

“I am sure that you are aware of the fact
that certain humane organizations and
other interested humanitarians have intro-
duced legislation in the US. Congress to
insure humane treatment of laboratory ani-

‘ mals. I was rather shocked to ﬁnd that the

AVMA is opposed to H.R. 1937 (the
Griffiths Bill). I have searched for the real
reason for the opposition and have come up
with only two reasons: (1) that ‘one cannot
legislate humaneness’ and; (2) that ‘this
would require licensing all laboratories that
use animals «. experimentally.’ ' Neither of

’these reasons are valid enough to warrant

opposition by'the AVMA. Surely the AVMA
believes in humane treatment of all animals
including laboratory animals.”

AVMA’s Position

Following are parts of AVMA’s reply to
this letter:

“The legislation proposed in Congress

during the last session is opposed by the '

AVMA because it would place laymen in the
position of dictating to medical scientists
the nature and extent of their research with
animals. The proposed legislation would
dangerously limit and, in some instances,
curtail the activities of health scientists,
including veterinarians, in their use of ex-
perimental animals for research.

February l, 1963

“The true issue is whether scientists in
general can promote humane care and use
of experimental animals by education and
cooperation, rather than by regulation and
policing proposed in the recent bills. We
ﬁrmly believe that humaneness to animals
is a philosophy of mind and that it cannot
be legislated.

“Actually, the AVMA is not against hu-
mane care of experimental animals, al-
though we are opposed to the legislation
which was introduced in the recent Con-
gress. All of our professional colleagues are
opposed to inhumane care of animals either
in a community or in a laboratory. All of
our professional training and activity is
directed toward maintenance of good health
in experimental animals by proper nutrition
and management, provision of suitable
physical facilities, and the prevention of
disease. Our veterinary oath is not and,
hopefully, never shall be treated lightly by
any member of the profession.”

AVMA’s Testimony

Just before the last Congress adjourned,
hearings were held on the “Humane Treat-
ment” bills. AVMA testiﬁed before the
Subcommittee on Health and Safety, Com-
mittee on Interstate and Foreign Com-
merce, House of Representatives, to which
the bills had been referred.

In its testimony [given by Dr. Jones],
the AVMA stated that it does not accept the
basic premise of these bills—that animals
in scientiﬁc laboratories in the United
States are routinely ill-housed and mis-
treated and, therefore, that restrictive
legislation is required.

The Association pointed out that the bills’
proponents are erroneously presuming that
pain and treatment of animals can be in-
terpreted in terms of man’s response to the
same conditions. “Animals possess a differ?
ent level of intellect and different sensorial
patterns from that of man,” AVMA said.
“The problems of interpreting the animal’s
intellect and biological needs are best left
to the veterinarians and other biological
scientists who specialize in the care of ex-
perimental animals.”

AVMA told the Congressmen that the
AssociatiOn is opposed to the enactment of
H.R. 1937 and H.R. 3556 because the
AVMA is irrevocably opposed to federal
licensing and policing of scientiﬁc investi—
gators and laboratories.

295

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 




 

 

“These bills would require federal licens-
in the
United States, and inspection of their labo—

ing of most biological scientists

ratories,” the testimony continued. “In
addition, prior approval of scientiﬁc re-
search plans and procedures would be neces—
sary by a federal bureaucracy administered
by nonscientiﬁc personnel. .

_ “These ‘red tape’. requirements would
smother the personal originality, initiative,
and liberty which has enabled American
scientists to lead the world in medical
knowledge,” AVMA said.

Furthermore, the AVMA suggested that
“some agency, perhaps this Committee,
should consider formulating a resolution
authorizing the existing governmental

HUMANENESS -— 'YES ,

agencies such as the National Institutes of
Health to provide from present funds ﬁnan-
cial support for, and advice on, the care of
experimental animals used in the health
sciences.” -
AVMA said that if these governmental
granting agencies are officially given re—
sponsibility for the humane treatment of
laboratory animals, there would be no need
for creating new regulatory agencies as
requested in the proposed legislation. “The
government agencies and health sciences
could support training programs for animal
care personnel, and provide suitable physi-
cal facilities for animals used in the health
sciences,” the Association suggested.

Fromm. REGULATION —- No

Here is AVMA’s position concerning maior provisions in the proposed leg-
islation on human-e care of experimental animals.

YES

) Adequate housing-sanitation, lighting,
temperature control, ventilation, and exer-
cise facilities shall be supplied for experi-
mental animals.

) Animals shall receive adequate food and
water and shall not be caused to suffer un-
necessary or avoidable pain through neglect
or mishandling.

) Animals used in an experiment that would
cause pain shall be anesthetized, except to
the extent that the use of anesthetics would
frustrate the object of the experiment.
Animals suffering pointless and prolonged
pain shall be painlessly killed.

) An accurate, record shall be maintained of
all experiments and tests performed.

 

NO

b No experiment on living animals shall be

conducted unless a project plan is on ﬁle

with the Secretary describing the nature
and purposes of the project and the proce-
dures to be employed. ‘

> An annual report and such additional re-
ports or information as the Secretary may
require by regulation or individual request
shall be submitted to the Secretary.

) Authorized representatives of the Secre-
tary shall be given access to the animals
and to the premises and books and records
of the research workers to administer the
bill, and these representatives shall be au—
thorized to destroy or require the destruc-
tion of animals in accordance with rules,
regulations, or instructions issued by the
Secretary.

} An Agency for Laboratory Animal Con-
trol shall be established in the executive
branch of the United States Government.
The Agency shall be headed by a commis-
sioner who must have been admitted to
practice law in the Supreme Court of the

United States.

Modeler-Griffiths Bill
January 3, l963
Dear Sir:

Doctor L. Meyer Jones, speaking ~‘for the AVMA,”
did not speak for all its members when he said be-
fore a congressional subcommittee hearing on HR
1937 and llli 3556 that the AVMA is “irrcvm-ably
opposed to federal licensing and policing of scientific
investigators and laboratories.” He goes on to say
that "We do not accept the a priori premise of these
bills, i.c.. that animals in scientific laboratories in the
United States routinely are ill-housed and mistreated
and, therefore, that corrective legislation is neces-

' saiy."

I do not accept the premise that all research-
minded M.D.’s, Ph.D.’s, 'or D.V.M.’s are a priori
kind, decent, and possessed of higher motives and
sensitivities, nor that all the animals they use all
are well housed and humanely treated. Is it not true
that disclosures have been made (and were made
at the above hearing) that animals used for research
paid for by US. funds have actually' been horribly
ill-housed and maltreated? What about the Frank-
lin (Mass) case in which dogs, for which funds for
housing and care were provided by the N.I.H., were
in fact subjected to heart surgery, and when re-
covered from anesthesia just put out-of-doors in a
Massachusetts winter, with a few boards tacked on
trees as shelter, and with garbage or a few dead
chickens their only food, unless they ate each other?
(They did!) These dogs were seized by Massachu-
setts state police and brought to this hospital. for
care. The pleurisy, pericarditis, and endocarditis
present in 2 of them exceeded anything I have ever
seen in spontaneous disease.

I'have very great respect for the medical profes-
sion, and both friendship and deep regard for many
physicians, but I have been witness to most indif-
ferent “care” given laboratory animals in highly
respected medical schools for many, many years. I
cannot understand the reason for “irrevocable op-
position” to the feelings of a rather large segment
of the population who want to insure humane and
decent care for animals that must be used in re-
search and, in fact, want to exert some control over
research which causes pain and death to .living
creatures. Defense of the stand taken by the AVMA
now seems mainly to take a position “against regu~
lation of research by laymen.”.In rebuttal to this,
it should be pointed out that “regulation” would
apply only when tax money is used and that it .is
concerned mostly with housing of animals and pre-
vention of repetitious and unnecessarily cruel experi-
mentation.

Money and effort is being expended to create a
public image of the veterinarian that is favorable to
him. While I am sure the image of the AVMA
membership created by opposition to these bills is
favorable to the A.M.A., I wonder if the general
public who knows about such opposition is favorably

CORRESPONDENCE—continued ing committees or organizations on a local level to
offer suggestions or ideas on areas in animal re-
search where improvement needs to be done. I am
sure that such a committee, made up of interested
and informed citizens on a local level, could be a
very effective force in this field.

The federal government has become a ieal force
in medical research with the funds that it has had
available for this purpose. Let us all strive to keep.
it in its proper perspective. .

been tarnished during the past decade or so and we
should think carefully and fully—before teaming with

the medical and veterinary professions is undoubted-
ly the proper course to our foreseeable ultimate goal,
we should feel free to express independent thought
on matters concerning ozlr patients. With all the
AVMA members’ money that is being spent for
somewhat nebulous “public relations,” it seems to
me that higher regard might be gotten from much

It is a paradox that the clarion call of those

Postdoctoral Veterinary Education

December 7,

1962
Dear Sir:
The article by Dr. Pritchard regarding postdoctor-

al veterinary education (INA V..MA., 140, June 15,
1962:1298) met with most enthusiastic reception in

these quarters. We have for some years been ad-

474

vm'ating just such programs for the more adequate

training of those who wish to specialize in a par-

opinion,
function.

Dr. l’rier’s letter (].A.V.M.A., 141, Oct. 1, 1962:
774) seems to us to be written from an extremely
limited point of view. While it may be quite accept-
able for some scientists to approach all sick animals,
human or otherwise, as “specimens,” it is not pos-
sible for a successful practitioner to so regard them
unless he be a very prince of hypocrisy; thus it is
that most of us regard the dogs presented for our
care as patients. It is perhaps well that this is so,
for we feel that such an attitude not only contributes
to better care for our sick friends but also helps to
maintain the sort of client relationships which are
necessary if we are to pay the taxes essential to the

support of the educational institutions and their
staffs.

no program extant which performs this

While we have the greatest respect for the type
of postdoctoral training which leads to the MS. and
Ph.D. degrees, and for the essential and basic knowl-
edge provided thereby, we feel that the subject mat-
ter is usually too circumscribed to be of great value
to the practicing clinician and are, therefore, at a
loss to understand the charge of the creation of un-
employable specialists leveled by Dr. Prier at Dean
l.’ritchard’s proposed program. If Dr. Prier could
be troubled to acquaint himself with the world out-
side his institutional ivory tower, he would ﬁnd that
openings abound for exactly the sort of practicing
veterinarian Dean Pritchard is Striving to create. A
shorter look at girlie artist Capp and a longer look
at the broader aspects of veterinary medicine and
economics is obviously in order for Dr. Prier.

Russian “Scientists”

January 11, 1963
Dear Sir:

I was most interested in the Jan. 1, 1963, JOURNAL
item describing the visit of the Russian “scientists”
to this country, especially the AVMA offices. How-
ever, there are a few well-known facts that should
be passed on to our readers. As with all things the
Communists involve themselves in, the Cultural Ex-
change Mission plays an important function in the
international Communist conspiracy. The Commu-
nists have polluted this 'program with agents skill-
fully trained for their program of propaganda and
espionage. As former Congressman Judd has said.
“We send scientists and they [the Russians] send
agents.”

It is high time that we veterinarians utilize our
educational and influential potential to awaken
others to the many facets of the Communist menace

ri‘he Profession Meets a Challenge '

In 1960, the ﬁrst of the bills designed to enforce humane care of laboratory
animals was introduced in the Congress. Several others have been introduced since.
All were based on the principle of federal control to assure humane care.

The proponents of these bills were always reluctant to admit that the worst
offender, the laboratory not operating under a federal grant, would net be aﬁected
by such legislation, that federal inspection to enforce the bills would necessitate
an extensive and expensive national effort, and that to some degree thehealth
and welfare of the nation's citizens would be placed in jeopardy because of the
depressing effect on research such bills would create. The proponents of such
legislation, however, were able to uncover by diligent searching or by accident
a few “horrible” examples in which experimental animals, if not treated inhu-
manely, were certainly victims of neglect.

Most organizations representing the scientiﬁc community, including the
AVMA,‘ objected to the proposed “humane” legislation because of the restrictions
it would impose"on scientiﬁc experimentation. The scientists seemed to know what
they did not want, but it was difficult for them to formulate a positive program
outlining what they did want and how they could eliminate substandard care,
even if it did occur only sporadically. Fortunately, some dedicated scientists were
willing to face the problem head-on and, at the expense of considerable time and
effort, hammer out. some countermeasures that would make federal legislation

gunnecessary.

As a result, the Guide for Laboratory Animal Facilities and Care was created. .
It was prepared by the Animal Facilities Standards Committee of the Animal
Care Panel, a committee of 7 veterinarians* (6 of whom are members of the
American College of Laboratory Animal Medicine, an AVMA-recognized specialty
group) extremely well versed on laboratory animal care. It was supported ﬁnan- V
cially by the National Institutes of Health. Assisting them were a corps of ad-

'visors representing a variety of institutions. Among the 16 advisors‘*“* were 5

other veterinarians, a liberal sprinkling of prominent physicians and Ph.D.'s, and

a dentist. .
While the Guide does not purport to provide solutions for all problems of

laboratory animal care, it is a sincere and concrete example of willingness on the
part of the scientiﬁc community to clean house when necessary “and institute
humaneness on the best possible basis—a voluntary one. As stated in the foreword,
“This Guide is intended to assist scientiﬁc institutions in providing the best
possible. care for laboratory animals. The recommendations are based on scientiﬁc
principles and on expert opinion and experience with methods and practices which
have proved consistent with high quality care.”

Publication of the Guide is not likely to seriously forestall the efforts per se
of the proponents of humane legislation, but it could do a whole lot toward proving
to legislators that scientists are as much in favor of humane treatment of labo-

ratory animals as are their critics.

'Some veterinarians with an otherwise good style of writing
lapse into the repeated use of the phrase were present when they
describe pathologic changes. Here are some examples and sug-

gested alternatives.

In these examples, the redundancy is obvious, for the verb

of publication, and repetition of the phrase detracts from the

quality of the writing.

Disapproval of CIark-Neuberger Bill Expressed by 70 Groups

Representatives of 70 national organiza-
tions met February 5 under the sponsorship
of the National Society for Medical Research
to plan ways to advance lab-oratory animal
care and maintain a maximum rate of scien-
tiﬁc progress. The group cited the contribu-
tions of laboratory animals to the health
and welfare of the public.

Dr. Hiram E. Essex, president of the Na-
tional Society for Medical Research, pointed
out that the accuracy, efficiency, and pro-
ductivity of research depends upon elaborate
and costly care of animals used for study.
“Good care of experimental subjects limits
the number of conditions that could produce
misleading results,” Dr. Essex said.

Among the organizations represented in
this planning session were: The AVMA,
the American Medical Association, Ameri-
can Hospital Association‘, American Public
Health Association, and American Nurses
Association.

The representatives of health and science
organizations expressed unanimous disap—
proval of legislation before Congress that,
in the name of humaneness, would erect seri-
ous obstructions to research aimed at saving
life and preservation of health. Speciﬁc
criticism was directed at the Clark-Neu-
berger Bill introduced early in 1963 to limit,
license .and police research in biology, medi—
cine, and agriculture.

The scientists and health workers called
for Constructive programs to develop better
methods, programs to spread information on
better methods, pro-grams to train more spe-
cialists in laboratory animal care, and pro—
grams to build ever better laboratories for
research in the preservation of life and
health.

The delegates agreed to utilize the facilities
of their organization to build support for

constructive programs and to oppose the.

destructive efforts of antivivisectionists.

biological defense is currently being offered
once a month at Fort McClellan, Ala., by the
United States Public Health Service, Division
of Health Mobilization. The course, which
will be repeated through June, is designed
to train public health and medical personnel
in developing chemical and biological de—
fense programs within states, counties, and
principal municipalities.

There is no tuition fee and no security
clearance is required. The next courses are
scheduled to begin Monday, April 22, May
13, and June 17. Requests for application
forms and further information should be
addressed to: Deputy Chief, Training Branch,
Division of Health Mobilization, Public

cation, and Welfare, Washington 25, DC.

African Mouse a New Laboratory
Animal

An African mouse that is one of the few
animals besides man which develops stomach
tumors has been imported from Johannes—
burg, South Africa, to aid U.S. research
workers in their study of cancer. “Intermedi-
ate” between a mouse and a rat, the animal
is kept in security conﬁnement in only two
places in the United States to prevent it from
becoming a rodent pest in this country: the
Roswell Park Memorial Institute, Springville,
N.Y., and the National Cancer Institute,
Bethesda, Md. Research workers must ob-
tain a license to use the mouse for a project.

’lllinois V.M.A. Adopts Resolution /

Opposing Clark-Neuberger Bill /

At the 8lst annual convent—ion of the
Illinois State Veterinary Medical Association,
February 18—20, in Chicago, 111., a delegation

Dr. Glenn |. Case Dr. Herbert L. Marsh

of 400 members voted that the I.S.V.M.A.
support the stand of the AVMA in its oppo-
sition to the Clark—Neuberger Bill, regulat—
ing the use of laboratory animals. The reso-
lution urged the Senators and Representa-
tives from Illinois to oppose such proposed
bills as may be introduced and to recom—
mend nonregulatory federal support which
will effectively contribute to the improve-
ment in the care of laboratory animals. A
copy of the resolution was sent to each of
the Illinois Senators and Representatives and
to the Subcommittee on Health and Safety of
the Committee on Interstate and Foreign
Commerce to which this legislation is as-
signed.

In other business transacted by the con-
vention, the dues of the Association were
increased to $35.00, effective in 1964, and
the following officers were elected: Drs.
Glenn I. Case (KSU ’40), Kewanee, presi-
dent; Herbert L. Marsh (ISU ’43), Princeton,
president-elect; and Roger P. Link (ISU
’34), College of Veterinary Medicine, Uni-
versity of Illinois, treasurer. Dr. C. B. Hos-
tetler (KSU ’43), Des Plaines, was re-elected
executive secretary.

Dr. C. M. Rodgers (OSU ’34), Blandins—
ville, was presented with the Illinois State
V.M.A. “Veterinary Service Award” in rec-
ognition of his service to his community and
the health professions.

The scientiﬁc sessions of the convention
were divided into three sections covering
major areas of veterinary interest. Dr. Paul
B. Doby (KS-U ’49), assistant director, State
Division of Livestock Industry, Springﬁeld,

793

 




was chairman of the section on general prac—
tice. Dr. Charles Paul (KSU ’54), county
veterinarian, DeKalb, was chairman of the
section on sanitary science which discussed
veterinary aspects of public health and civil
defense, animal regulatory programs, and
animal disease eradication programs. Dr. D.
S. Darlington (ONT ’49), Lansing, was
chairman of the section on small animal
practice. A feature of this section was a
demonstration of anesthesia for parakeets.

Guest speaker at the convention banquet
was Dr. Dan J. Anderson, president of the
AVMA, spoke on “Removing Roadblocks to
Veterinary Medical Progress.” Five major
problems which Dr. Anderson foresaw as
possible roadblocks to the profession’s ad-
vancement unless veterinarians strive earn-
estly for their solution were: (1) The need
for stronger organization, nationally and
locally; (2) the need to grow in numbers;
(3) the need for vigorous participation in the
legislative life of our nation; (4) the need
to grow in scientiﬁc competence; and (5)
the need to improve public attitudes toward
the profession.

Total registration for the convention was
710.

Veterinarians Combine Slalom Racing
with Scientiﬁc Meeting

Aspen, Colo., was the setting for an in—
formative and fun-ﬁlled week for approxi-
mately 35 members, wives, and guests of the
Sierra Veterinary Club, February 10-16. A
varied and interesting scientiﬁc program was
held daily from 4:00 pm. to 7:00 p.m. High-
lights of the week—long program were pres—
entations by Dr. Stuart Patterson, radiologist
from Colorado State University, and Dr.
Eric Barnes of Anchorage, Alaska, Who is
currently at Colorado State University.

Dr. Patterson presented radiographs for
diagnostic interpretation and discussed tech-
niques involved in taking ﬁlm. Dr. Barnes
discussed a veterinarian’s practice in Alaska,
describing problems caused by the inclement
weather.

The annual slalom race for beginners, in-
termediates, and advanced skiers was held
the last day at Aspen Highlands. Winners
were awarded pins at the annual banquet
that evening.

Elected as president for 1964 was Dr. War-

794

ren Walker (COL ’45), a small animal practi—
tioner in La Cresanta, Calif. Dr. Joseph
Wayne (CAL ’56), Hawthorne, Calif, is the
incumbent president. The group voted unani-
mously to hold next year’s meeting at Mam—
moth, Ariz.

Colorado State University Receives
Grant for Cancer Research in Animals

A $10,000 grant from the American Cancer
Society to “seed” cancer research has been
made to Colorado State University. Under
the program, the $10,000 will be administered
by a faculty committee for projects designed
to encourage new areas of cancer research in
animals.

Research workers at Colorado State Uni—
versity have for several years conducted
cancer studies among ﬁsh and have investi—
gated the growth of deer antlers, a rapid
growth not too unlike cancer. Dr. M. Lloyd
Hopwood, associate professor of chemistry
and head of the endocrinology section, will
be chairman of the committee to direct utili-
zation of the grant. “The purpose of the
grant,” said Dr. Hopwood, “is to direct cancer
research into further studies among animals.
The studies are expected to observe cellular
growth and metabolism of animal cells with
the hope that ﬁndings may be applicable to
the attack on cancer as a human problem.”

Veterinarians named to the committee are:
Drs. Rue Jensen (COL ’42), dean of the
College of Veterinary Medicine; J. R. Collier
(OSU ’41), pathologist; F. X. Gassner (COL
’37), endocrinologist, and N. H. Booth (MSU
’47), physiologist.

Missouri V.M.A. Holds 71 st Annual
Meeting

The responsibility of veterinary medicine
toward the economic and scientiﬁc life of
the nation has grown tremendously in the
100 years since the profession’s founding,
Dr. Dan J. Anderson, president of the AVMA
told veterinarians attending the 7lst annual
meeting of the Missouri V.M.A., February
8—10, in St. Louis.

Vol. 142, No. 7 April 1, 1963

Humane Treatment of Animals '
February 7, 1963
Dear Sir:

This is a letter of commendation. It is written as
a personal missive by a member of the AVMA. The
subjects of it are matters pertaining to Bills HR.
1937 and lift. 3556 introduced in the federal legis-
lature. by Representatives Griffiths and Moulder, re-
spectively. '

These two bills'endeavor to legislate the lmmane
treatment of animals used in research.

The basic problem is not complex. The solution-

is attainable, but not by these bills. Humane treat-

ment of experimental animals, however bruited
' about as a source of income for some segments of

society and the. press, or twisted by the callous to

represent the end of our “pre-eminence” in medical

research, is a project in the ﬁeld of veterinary medi.
‘ cine. .

The AVR’IA House of Delegates, by resolution,
opposed these bills in the light of their obvious moral
and legal ineffectiveness.

To this end, the House instructed the officers of
the AVMA to state our opposition as the occasion
might demand. It further instructed the officers to
take those steps necessary to implement the solution
by composing whatever liaison or legislative works
were needed.

An emergency was created by a subcommittee of
the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce
of; the House of Representatives of the 87th Congress.
It suddenly called a hearing on these matters to be
held on September 28 and 29, 1962, in Washington.
By some strange chemistry of prescience, the propo-
nents for these bills had the advantages of the
needed witnesses from foreign countries being right
here on U.S. soil! Illustrative material had been
prepared. Petitions bearing pages of signers from
many walks and many lands were presented, etc.,
etc. Let me state in all fairness, however, that they
were not led by 76 trombones. '

The opponents of these bills were at some disad-
vantage. This might best be pictured by a Biblical
isomer, “Many answered, but few received a call.”
In fact, so shortwas the “advance” notice, that some
of these people had to ask for time to prepare formal
presentations after the hearing for inclusion in the
minutes. One key veterinary witness apparently had
about 24 hours’ notice to pack and fly from Califor-
nia in order to appear. You don’t have to ask about
which end of the federal eagle they sat under dur-
ing the proceedings.

The AVMA was very fortunate.

Dr. L. Meyer Jones, director of scientific activities,
AVMA, acted as our spokesman. In his testimony
he presented a short, direct‘statement of our princi-

ple that morality in this area is a matter of educa-
tion and certiﬁcation rather than legislation; of the
construction of proper facilities with sufficient funds
made available to that end; of direction by quali-
licd, professional people who have been found moral-
ly committed to humane care of animals, and of the
function of such a facility with the advice of experts
now in the employ of NIH.

'l‘hese experts are, in the main, veterinarians. This
area of practice is new to our profession in time. not
performance. In their time, so were meat inspection,
tuberculosis eradication. brucellosis control, rabies
control and, now, hogr cholera eradication. The num-
bers of challenges we have successfully met are' un-
equalled in medical history.

We need three things: the assignment of the re-
sponsibility, the delegation of commensurate author-
ity, and the appropriation of proper funds in order
to perform. Given these, the veterinary profession
can meet this challenge today. ‘

I wish to thank Dr. Jones for his masterful testi-
mony and highly professional conduct at the hear-
ings. It was a source of light in the midst of much
heat and wind.

On Yawning

Yawning, a long, deep inspiration With
the mouth wide open, followed by a slow
expiration, is a trait found in all primates
and probably is widely distributed among
mammals generally.

Yawning usually occurs when there is a
lowered state of critical consciousness, a
state in which the active awareness of the
individual to his environment is below nor-
mal. Reduced critical consciousness is often
associated with an increased 002 saturation
of the blood. Yawning, by its massive inspi-
ration of oxygen and exhalation of 00,,
serves to restore the depleted oxygen content
of the blood. The wide opening of the mouth
tends to compress the carotid vessels opening
into thejugular veins, possibly inﬂuencing
the carotid bodies which contribute to the ac.-
celeration of cerebral oxygenation and ve-
nous drainage. Virtually all cephalic struc-
tures are in consequence stimulated. All of
these changes tend to contribute to the
heightening of consciousness, and this. is
probably the principal function of yawning.
Yawning warns one of reduced critical con—
sciousness and suggests that either sleep or
activity is needed—J. Am. M. A., 182,
(Nov. 17, 1962): 732.

Giant research complex, once thefund-favored pet of Congress,

is coming under closer scrutiny as budget mounts toward the billion-donar mark

 

 

 

 

 

 

REP. FOUNTAIN (r), chairman of House subcommittee hearing
testimony on alleged NIH laxity, confers with group's counsel.

 

 

 

 

‘ "m1 . #4.. ,. .4 . i. 44‘

 

CRITIC Basil O'Connor claims NlH gets more from Congress
than it asks for, spends more than it can wisely handle.

42

'ﬁ'he long honeymoon is over for Congress and the Na-
tional Institutes of Health. Signs are increasing that
Congress no longer ﬁnds the research agency totally en-
chanting. Some legislators, once completely captivated,
have begun asking questions—and even voicing criti-
cisms. ,

Only this month, the Fountain subcommittee in the
House has launched a series of hearings aimed at expos-
ing alleged NIH laxity in managing nearly $1 billion in
research funds. Formerly wary congressional budget-.
cutters now ﬁnd that operation of the vast research center
is no longer immune to their activities. .

No one is more aware of the develOping new mood
than the men most concerned with NIH’s destiny—Dr.
James A. Shannon, NIH director, congressional health
spokesman Sen. Lister Hill (D-Ala.) and Rep. John E.
Fogarty (D-R.I.). Behind the scenes, they are already
busy with strategies to counter the trend and maneuver the
new NIH budget safely through Congress.

So far, most of the criticism has been limited or vague,

and rather sporadic. It has centered on NIH’s so-called

laxness in handling grant funds. It has been stimulated by
awareness of the fact that NIH has‘become a big spender,
like other major agencies traditionally more subject to
congressional scrutiny. And it has been prodded by some
anxiety even in the scientiﬁc community ever the govern-
ment’s growing role in medical education and research.

Compared to the acid words continually showered on
agencies such as the State and Defense departments, cur-
rent criticism of NIH is almost gentle. Nevertheless, it has
shaken NIH leaders for, mild though it may be, the crit«

'icism could foreshadow a deep new trend involving the

national research effort. It suggests that Congress is mov-

. ing totighter control of NIH spending and operations.

So long as NIH was relatively small, and therefore
somewhat removed from the public° gaze, Congress. was
content to “leave it to the experts”'——Fogarty and Hill. .
But as its appropriations climbed toward the magic $1
billion mark, it inevitably attracted more public attention,
and other congressional groups began to get interested.

The ﬁrst ripple of trouble in the NIH’s snug harbor
was stirred up by a. subcommittee headed by Rep. L. ‘H.
Fountain (D—N.Car.), which in 1961 began investigating

 




the agency's grant practices. The ripples swelled when the
subcommittee pursued its investigation last year. ”Con-
the group reported, “has been overzealous in ap-
propriating money for health research.”

Then, during the 1962 debate on NIH’s budget, Rep.
H. R. Gross (R-Iowa) raked NIH for approving such
grants as $89,000 to study “behavioral cocktail parties.”
Meanwhile, in the Senate, Sen. Hill for the ﬁrst time found
himself faced with a major drive to cut back his usual rec-
ommendation to give NIH more than the Administration
recommended—$900 million last year instead of $780
million asked by the White House. Both Hill and FOgarty
beat back the challenges, and Congress ultimately voted
$880 mill ion. But the questioning of policy continued.

A major attack came

work. Perhaps most important is the fact that NIH has
become a big item in the national budget—just at a time
when many lawmakers are concerned about increased
spending, large deﬁcit and a proposed tax cut.

Moreover, the core of NIH’s congressional support——
even after more than a decade—remains restricted to a
handful of men. Dr. Shannon and his colleagues have
dealt almost entirely with Sen. Hill and Reps. Fogarty,
Melvin R. Laird (R-Wis.) and a few others. Although
NIH theoretically falls within the jurisdiction of the
House Commerce Committee, the agency has virtually
ignored this powerful group for some years.

Even in the health community, NIH’s position has

. remained weak. ‘Its leaders have maintained close contacts

 

from Basil O Connor, Na-
tional Foundation presi-
dent, who assailed the
, congressional committees’
habit of voting‘more than
NIH asked for, and of
following the advice of
scientists who, he main-
tained, were beneﬁting
from NIH grants them-
selves.

Sen. Paul Douglas (D-
Ill.), a liberal, also raised

 

the question" of whether
Congress should go be-
yond the Administration
proposals on funds for NIH. Taking Douglas’ cue, the
Chicago Sun- Times recently attacked NIH for urider—
writing such esoteric studies as “A Stereotactic Atlas of
the Beagle Brain” and “Red Tuna and Yellow Fat Dis-
eases in the Cat.”

Under the impact of the Fountain investigationand of
publicity over a few cases of loose management uncov-
ered by the General Accounting Office, NIH tightened its
grant procedures. Among other things, it decreed that
grant-paid salaries had to be in line with those generally
provided by the sponsoring institution, and that NIH
speciﬁcally had to approve trips abroad and purchase of
any equipment that cost more than $1, 000.

In analyzing the causes of the current new mood
toward NIH, Administration health leaders are aware
I that a variety of forces are at work. The greatest is time.
Immediately after World War II, the American public,
already fascinated by the ﬁrst‘ ‘wonder drugs,” saw no
limit to the possible accomplishments of research.

The result was a phenomenal expansion of medical
research and drug development, which has proceeded
without let-up for more than a decade. But now that many
of the most urgent ﬁnancial needs of biological scientists
have been met, public pressure is leveling off.

To a certain extent this leveling off may also be due
to the fact that the great expectations raised by vast Out-
lays of funds have. not been realized. The great‘killers—
heart disease and cancer—remain unconquered.

In Congress, other and more tangible factors are at

with key medical scientists and with inﬂuential research
spokesmen. But they have not cultivated a continuing
relationship with the general medical community or with
such national organizations as the AMA. Signiﬁcantly,
only one scientiﬁc group rose to defend NIH when it was

'under attack by the Fountain committee, although pri-

vately, many research leaders deplored the new restric- '
tions on grants brought about by the activities of the
subcommittee.

Virtually the only favorable comment came from
Science, official journal of the American Association for
the Advancement of Science.

Editorially, it praised the “increasingly liberal” poli-
cies of NIH. As a result of these policies, it declared, “the
good scientists were supported. There was almost no
bureaucratic interference. Paper work was held to a min-
imum. As a result, we are in the midst of tremendous
fundamental progress in biology and medicine.”

Science said that researchers'will bow to the new con-
trols forced by the Fountain subcommittee. But it voiced
concern over added steps that Congress may take “to
alter or to channel activities of the academic scientiﬁc
establishment.”

All of these factors help to account for adjustments
NIH is having to make. The honeymoon is over. But
this isn’t to say that the marriage is on the rocks. On the
contrary, many observers predict that the relationship
between NIH and both Congress and the public will con-
tinue to ﬂourish—but in a cooler climate. I

MEDICAL RESEARCH FACES RESTRICTIVE IEGISLATION
IN NEXT SESSION OF CONGRESS

.According to the National Society for
jMedical Research some of the objectionable
features of the bills introduced into the
last session of Congress (H.R. 1937 and
H.R. 3556) are as follows:

ZTQe Griffiths and Moulder Bills re-
quire that scientists file project plans_
desﬁribing experimental procedures to be
employed. Government approval would be
required before changes could be made.
EXploratory research would be made more
difficult because of the need to clear with

Washington at each turn'in the road.

1. Elaborate record-keeping and re-
ports would be required. The records and
reports would be in addition to those
needed for scientific purposes and grant
administration.

2. Government inepectors would be au-
thorized to stop research and destroy ani-
mals-if, in the Judgment of the inSpectors,
plans outlined and approved in advance have
not been followed accurateLy.

3. The Moulder Bill provides that any
scientist convicted of cruelty to animals or
knowingly violating any provisions of the
Moulder prOposal can never again receive a
certificate to conduct studies with animals.

 

A. The.Moulder Bill would require that
anesthetics be administered only by licensed
veterinarians or by doctors of medicine
specializing in anesthesiology. No nurse
anesthetists here."

In addition the MDulder Bill provides
that an administration agency of the federal
government be set up with a Commissioner to
be paid the same salary as a federal Judge

who is not a scientist and has never had
anything to do with medical research.

Such legishation would inevitably re-
tard medical progress and.further divert
the scientist from his main task. It imr
poses upon him.an outside regulatory agency
thus placing him.under restrictions unique
among professional groups. It has always
been accepted that professions should regu-
late and police themselves, that no one is
better able than they to Judge whether their
own members are guilty of imprOper or un-
ethical conduct. ‘Why should medical re-
searchers be made an exception especially
when through their own efforts such organ-
izations as the Animal Care Panel and Insti-
tute for Laboratory Animal Resources exists.

There is not the slightest doubt that
these bills or their counterparts will be
introduced into the next session.of Congress
which convenes in.January. Judging from the
reSponse at the hearings on H.R. 1937
(Griffiths Bill) and H.R. 3556 (Moulder 13111)
on September 28, 1962 there is a strong
sentiment backed by powerful groups to bring
about the passage of these bills. There is
no question but medical research has a tough

 

fight on its hands and it is up to every
friend of medical—progress to exert all in-
fluence possible to defeat such legislation.
If you have not already done so, write‘your
Congressmen now.
Also write for free copies of the

printed report of recent hearing on Mbulder
and Griffiths Bills to W. E. Williamson,
Clerk, Committee on Interstate and Foreign
Commerce, House of Representatives, Congress

REPORT ON NATIONAL SURVEY OF.ANDNAL FACILITIES*

A.preliminary report has now been com-
pleted on the national survey of laboratory
animal facilities. The report is based on
site visits during 1961 to 58 nonprofit,
nonfederal medical research institutions in
an effort to determine the present status
of the field of laboratory animal care.

Funds for the survey came frOm.a grant from
the Division of General Medical Sciences,
National Institutes of Health. The informa-
tion gathered by the ten members of the team
and'the chairman, Dean W. T. S. Thorp of the
University of Minnesota College of Veterinary
jMedicine, will.make it possible to estimate
future requirements and to determine where the
greatest emphasis is needed. The details of
the report were made available by Dr. Bennett
J. Cohen, a member of the survey team.

.Although the survey determined that ani-
mal care facilities in the institutions stud—
ied were not organized uniformly, it was found
that many institutions had "animal facility
committees" with membership drawn from those
departments using most of the animals. The
committee acts as an advisory body to the Dean
and to the director of a central facility; or
in some instances where there is no profes-
sional director it manages the Operation of
the animal colonies.

Research workers in all Of the institu-
tions surveyed were found to have accepted the
concept that prOper care of laborato animals
is essential to the subcess of their investiga—
tions. Recognizing that the adequacy of ani-
mal care is determined by the competence and
training of reSponsible professional and non-
professional personnel, investigators are sup-
porting efforts by national professional and
scientific organizations to promote a more
adequate Opportunity for these personnel.

In the experience of the site visitors,
the present over-all performance of animal
care is greatly superior to that practiced as
recently as 5-10 years ago.. In many of the
institutions professional personnel with ex-
cellent training and eXperience now direct or
supervise animal care; the training of animal
technicians has improved, and this has re-
sulted in improved sanitary conditions, dis-
ease control, and better.handling and manage-
ment of animals. However, certain problems

*Reprinted in part from the Reports

related to personnel are hindering some
institutions from achieving the best
possible standards. Recommendations
by the survey team for dealing with
these problems were made.

The report points out that in some
instances inefficiencies in animal care
could be attributed to inadequate train-
ing of animal care personnel. "Proper
training is not simply a matter of
association of technicians with labora-
tory animals. It requires systematic
presentation of a specific body of in-
formation, as well as the acquisition
of manual skills." The report urges
all research institutions to take ad-
vantage of the availability of animal
technician courses through the Tech-
nical Guidance Committee of the Insti-
tute of Laboratory Animal Resources,
and through the.Animal Care Panel and
its local branches.

The Survey substantiates that con-
siderable progress is being made in im-
proving animal care through improved
personnel performance. However, not all
institutions have yet achieved the best
possible standards. There is need for

 

*additional professionaIIy trained

dirgaom for
better status andt training“of‘animal care
personnel and for informing administra-
tors of research institutions and in-
vestigators themselves of these needs.

 

 

 

The recommendations are based on
the findings summarized in the complete
report, and on the Opinions of the site
visitors regarding the further progress
of laboratory animal care. It'was recom:
mended that, in an institution providing
animal care services on a centralized
basis, the administration of the depart-
ment be directed by an individual pro-
fessionally qualified in laboratory
animal medicine. In addition to his
primary responsibility for directing
animal care activities, this person should
also serve as a consultant to the pro-
fessional staff on laboratory animal
problems, teach in areas in which he has
professional or academic competence, and
engage in appropriate research.

THE SOCIETSE AND THE NATIONAL
' SOCIETY FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH ‘.
WORK CIOSELY TOGETHER /

 

 

This office is frequently queried re-
garding the relationship between the Mary-
land Society for Medical Research and the
National Society for Medical.Research.
Although the aims and objectives of the two
are identical, one working at the state and
the other at the national level, there is
no formal affiliation” The MSMR is an inde-
pendent corporation chartered under the laws
of Maryland and is not in any sense a chap-
ter or branch of the NSMR and does not
financially support its work either in the
form of dues or contributions.

The MSMR does have an official relation-
ship with the national society by virtue of
the fact it is entitled to one member on the
Advisory Council of the NSMR along with the
other state societies and numerous national
scientific societies and institutions. The
Advisory Council is responsible for recom-‘
mendations concerning the overall policy of
the national organization and meets once a
year to take up current problems.

In addition to the MSMR several other
state societies have been in operation for
a number of years. They are the Illinois
Society for Medical Research (ISMR), The
Medical Research Association of California
(MRAC) and the New York State Society for
Medical Research (NYSSMR). Recently the
Connecticut Society for Medical Research has
also been formed as an outgrowth of the
effort to obtain favorable legislation on
dog procurement for medical research insti-
tutions in that state. All of these state
societies are active within their own areas
and have essentially the same goal, to create
an understanding of the problems of medical
research and to create an atmosphere favor-
able for its pursuit.

A recent example of how the NSMR works
is its activity in coordinating the efforts
to defeat the bills before Congress which
would impose federal regulations on medical
research supported by federal funds. In
this as in other matters the MSMR works
closely with the national organization.

 




MEMBERS ARE URGED TO PAY
ANNUAL DUES PROMPTLY

Bills for annual dues are being sent
with this number of the Bulletin and mem-
bers are urged to reply as promptly as
possible. Active members pay $2 and Sue-
taining members $5 per year. All dues and
contributions are tax deductible.

The Society Operates on a very small
budget and all expenses are kept to a mini-
mum. Only one part time employee is on the
payroll, all other income being devoted
directly to furthering the Society's educa-
tional program the purpose of which is to
inform the citizens of Maryland of the needs,
methods and goals of medical research.

This year eXpenses have been particu-
larly heavy because of the necessity to in-
form.members regarding impending federal
regulations which would seek to regulate and
police medical research supported by federal
funds. As a result of this certain other
features of the program have been restricted.
There is no reason to believe that expendi-
tures for this purpose will decrease in 1963
and every reason to believe they will increase.

Aside from informing members regarding
legislative action the Society circulates a
number of films on medical research and careers
in medicine which are in continuous demand
throughout the country and also actively car-
ries on its Small Animal Classroom proJects
in Maryland schools.

SOCIETY ACTIVE IN ARRANGING
TOURS DURING PAST MONTHS

During the spring and summer of this
current year the Society arranged for
eleven tours through the research labora-
tories and hospital of the university of
Maryland School of Medicine. .All of them
were from.Maryland High Schools except
for one group of adults from Baltimore
County who, because of their interest in
cancer, visited Dr. Figge's cancer re-
search laboratory in the Bressler Building.

The average size of such a group was
about 25 although larger groups up to 50
have been accommodated. However such num—
bers are not recommended as groups of this
size are awkward to move about and it is
also difficult for all members of the group
to see what is going on.

For the most part the groups were from
Baltimore City and County although one came
from as far away as Easton, Maryland. Dur-
ing the summer two science centers were
accommodated as well as a group of Candy
Stripers from UniVersity Hospital.

The Society feels this is one of the
most effective ways to interest young people
in the medical sciences ami to bring about
an understanding among them.of the problems
of medical research and how it is done.
Hopefully some of these visitors will some
day be in the research.laboratories them:
selves.

These are the hard—core anti—vivi—
sectionists who would ban or restrict

laboratory experimentation with
animals, thereby severely limiting
nearly all medical research. Quies—
cent for a decade, the AV movement
is gaining new momentum.

In principle, a1'1ti—vivisectionists
oppose any animal experimentation
—-—even the use of mice in diet stud—
ies. Total victory for them would
mean that the surgical student
would have to learn his skills on
human beings, not animals. Re—
search on drugs which are tested
and standardized on animals would
56

come to a halt. Even the limitation
and regulation of medical research
with animals, as urged by most
AV’ 3, would, 1n the opinion of the
medical profession, seriously ham~
per all work toward a solution of
such problems as cancer, heart dis—
ease and mental illness. Observed
the late Dr. William Mayo, co—
founder of the Mayo Clinic, “To re,
move animals from experimental
medicine would be a calamity not
only to mankind but to lower ani—
mals themselves.” Animals have
beneﬁted quite as much from re-
search as humans, with the conquest
of such deadly maladies as hepatitis,
cholera and rabies.

Such observable fact leaves most
AV’s unmoved. Notes one extremist
with remarkable candor, “I am
ready to see not only science but the

General Trygve Lie started on sum—

in Administration councils on the
side of prompt US. military inter—
vention in Korea. His viewpoint
prevailed, and the following day the
United Nations, under US. leader—
ship, embarked on a history—making
venture in collective security.
When the Rockefeller Founda—
tion set about looking for a new
president, John Foster Dulles and
Defense Secretary Robert A. Lovett,
both trustees of the foundation, con—
vinced their fellow trustees that
Dean Rusk was the best man for the
job. In mid—1952 Rusk moved his
family to suburban Scarsdale, N. Y.
He disappeared from public View
into the comparatively calm harbor
of the Rockefeller Foundation to
preside over the spending of some
250 million dollars in world—wide

projects over the course of eight
years.

Now he has emerged from that
harbor into what he himself once
called an “almost impossible ofﬁce.”
The greatest problem to face him
will be, of course, the continuing
conﬂict with Communism. To pre—
vail in that struggle, Rusk believes
the United States needs only remem—
ber, in effect, that the eagle has two
claws. This nation, he says, “is not a
raft tossed by the winds and waves
of historical forces over which it has
little control. Its dynamic power,
physical and ideological, generates
historical forces; what it does or does
not do makes a great deal of diﬂer—
ence to the history of man in this
epoch.

“When the emphasis of discussion
falls too heavily on the limitations of
policy, I recall from early childhood
the admonition of the circuit preach—
er: ‘Pray as if it were up to God;
work as if it were up to you.’ ”

THE QUIET NEW MAN AT STATE 55

W

Forever Irish

AN OLD-FASHIONED Irish nationalist orator was in the habit of starting
his addresses as follows: “My friends, it’s a matter of great pride that
in all my years of service to'Old Ireland I’ve never uttered one unkind,
uncharitable word, not even about Britons and Orangemen—tyrants

and reactionaries though they be.” —T/ze Freeman

SOME YEARS ago a group of Irishmen were invited to march in a
civic parade in my town, and the question was raised whether they
should march under the Union Jack or the Irish Hag. It was ﬁnally
settled by one vociferous member. “Let there be no bigotry in this
matter,” he said ﬁrmly. “We’ll march under the Irish ﬂag or we’ll

nOt march at all.” —Contributcd by Florence Donahue

 




VIVISECTION~AN EXPLOSIVE ISSUE AGAIN 57

whole human race go to destruction
before I would resort to animal ex-
perimentation.”

The anti—Vivisectionists are rather
loosely organized into local societies,
but they are vocal and active. Sev—
eral years ago, for instance, they
sought repeal of a municipal ordi—
name in. Baltimore which made
available to research laboratories the
stray animals about to be gassed in
the city pound. Medical men fought
back. Among their witnesses at a
hearing: Drs. Alfred Blalock and
Helen Taussig of Johns Hopkins,
who worked on dogs to perfect their
famed blue—baby operation, which
has saved thousands of lives. .As
evidence of the value of this surgery
they presented a lively child who
ran across the stage. Prior to surgery
the child could hope for no more
than a few months of life—he
couldn’t walk across a room with—
out gasping for breath. Some AV’s
actually hissed the child.

In a similar hearing in Detroita
medical student, a former Marine,
confronted a vocal AV. “1 was a
medic,” he told her. “On the battle—
ﬁeld in Korea I gave transfusions—-
transfusion Was deVeloped by animal
experimentation. I saw dying men
come back to life. If you could have
been with me I believe you would
be on our side.” The AV, a middle-
aged woman, was unmoved. “I wish
you all had died,” she said.

The antivvivisectionists thrive on
Wild distortion in their talk and in
their publicity. To them, research
men are “cannibalistic Charlatans”;

surgeons are “sadistic monsters.”
Lifesaving vaccines are “pus.” They
repeatedly charge “torture” and
“monstrous cruelty” in research lab—
oratories—yet every state has hu-
mane laws, and no research man has
ever been convicted of violating
them. During the Baltimore hear—
ings, AV’s charged that visitors
were barred from Johns Hopkins
because of “horrid torture of ani~
mals.” Dr. Philip Bard, head of the
physiology department, invited vis-
itors to come at any time, unan—~
nounced, to see for themselves.

To the AV, laboratory animal
rooms are “ﬁlthy, crowded, vermin-
infested.” As a reporter, I have vis—
ited hundreds of them. Without
exception, conditions are much bet-
ter than those provided most home
pets—steam-sterilized pens, bal—
anced rations, maximum care and
consideration.

The more rabid AV’s even deny
the existence of microbes and the
value of vaccines. The conquest,
through the use of vaccines, of such
scourges as smallpox, polio and
diphtheria is ignored or disputed.

Observes Dr. Morris F ishbein in
Medical World N was: “The per-
sistence of the antivvivisectionists
makes one despair that education
has any permanent value. Again and
again our scientists must hie them—
selves to Washington, to state legis—
latures, to county boards, to city
councils, and present arguments to
defeat proposed legislation that
would inhibit research.”

Not long ago I visited the Chicago

 




58 THE READER’S DIGEST

oﬂice of Clarence E. Richard, man—
aging director of the National Anti—
Vivisection Society, and one of the
most vocal spokesmen for the move—
ment. He asked if I objected to a
tape recording being made of the
interview, and mentioned that a
prominent AV had recently won a
libel action against a national mag—
azine. The implications were clear.

I already had looked up Richard’s
background. He had been arrested
in 1955 and charged with embez—
zling $6000 of funds of his own
organization. At his trial in 1958 he
pleaded guilty, promised partial res—
titution and was placed on proba—
tion for ﬁve years.

The court records also showed
that he had had a bout with tubercu—
losis and that in the course of his
illness he had had a lung operation.
I mentioned that this operation was
developed from experiments on dogs

and asked if he felt justiﬁed in

availing himself of the fruits of this

research.

“I had no choice in the matter,”
Richard replied. “I wanted to live.”
Then he added, “When we are
sick, 90 percent of us go to doctors.”
Later in the interview he asserted,
“I would not deliberately kill any
animal.” How, then, could he in—
dulge a self—confessed fondness for
steak? There was no satisfactory
reply.

If AV’s were convinced that ani—
mal experimentation was immoral,
why didn’t they establish their own
medical schools and hospitals to
practice what they preached? “We

...

could never get doctors to staff
them,” Richard replied—despite the
fact that AV literature constantly
quotes “prominent” physicians who
supposedly support their views.
Several years ago Dr. Virgil H.
Moon, then of Jefferson Medical
College, Philadelphia, checked up
on some of these “prominent” phy—
sicians. One had been barred from
using the mails to peddle a fraudu—
lent venereal—disease remedy; an—
other had been convicted for the
illegal practice of medicine.

In the main, AV’s object to ani—
mal experimentation on the
ground that it is immoral, since
animals cannot give consent; that it
is painful; that results achieved are
valueless.

It is true that animals do not give
consent. Neither, for that matter,
does a chicken consent to its can—
didacy for the frying pan; nor the
pig to be rendered into pork. Is it
kinder, more moral, as the AV’S
profess, to gas a pup to death in a
city pound than to permit its use in
testing vitamin D—which prevents
children’s bones from being twisted
by rickets?

In presenting their case AV’s re—
lentlessly stress cruelty. They cite
dogs which have had one kidney
removed as “living in agony and
ﬁnally dying.” Actually thousands
of humans are living with one kid—
ney in no discomfort whatever. The
AV’s state that only ﬁve percent of
research animals are given anes—
thesia. This is true—but misleading.
I n the vast majority of experiment:

 




C.

no pain is involaea’. Recently, Texas
A. & M. used 18,000 rats to test
foods preserved by irradiation—
with no discomfort to the rats what—
ever. For the millions of mice and
other animals used to test anti—can—
cer and other drugs, pain is limited
to the jab of a hypodermic. In ex-
perimental sargery, ana7 in surgical
teaching, the animal gets the same
anesthesia as the haman patient,
and the best veterinary care.

The third charge of the AV’s—
that medical research with animals
has been without value—hardly
merits discussion. Virtually all
medical advances—antibiotics, vita—
mins, hormones, vaccines, new sur—
gical procedures—trace directly to
animal experimentation. Tetanus
(lockjaw) was a horror in the Civil
War, killing 95 percent of the
stricken. In World War 11, there
were only ﬁve American deaths
from tetanus. In the Civil War, 90
percent of soldiers who got pene—
trating wounds of the abdomen
died. Then a research man, working
with dogs, developed. surgical tech—
niques for repairing intestines and
other internal organs. Largely as a
result of this pioneer study, 80 per—
cent of soldiers so wounded in
World War II survived.

At the turn of the century, some
30,000 people a year died one of the
most horrid of all deaths—strangled
with diphtheria. Thanks to preven—
tive measures developed by animal
research, there are now no more
than 150 deaths a year. Pneumonia,
once a deadly disease, has, thanks

VIVISECTION—AN EXPLOSIVE ISSUE AGAIN 59

to antibiotics, become less serious.

The activities of the anti—vivisec—
tionists Cannot be dismissed as
harmless or ineﬁ’ectual even though
they make little sense. Restrictive
legislation has been a consistent goal
of the AV movement. In 1945 ﬁve
states had passed laws prohibiting
the use of animals for scientiﬁc re—
search in state—supported schools.
Many city councils required that
stray dogs and cats be gassed in city
pounds, and not be turned over to
laboratories which sorely needed
them. Until corrective legislation
was passed in 1957, Massachusetts
medical schools had to pay $10 to $20
each for dogs from dealers—money
sorely needed for research—at a
time when Boston was destroying
3000 animals a year!

Today many animal—welfare so—
cieties insist that they are not op—
posed to animal experimentation.
Yet even while insisting, some of
them make every possible effort
to impede the progress of medical
research.

The Humane Society of the
United States—not to be confused
with the American Humane Assn.
-—is a case in point. To a great de—
gree this organization is a creation
of its executive director, Fred Myers,
a former newspaperman. Employed
in the early 1950’s by the American
Humane Assn., he made a futile
attempt to gain control of that
wealthy and highly respected organ-
ization, which is devoted primarily
to maintaining shelters for un—
wanted animals. He resigned under

 




60 THE READER’S DIGEST

pressure, and in 1954 he set up his
present organization.

To assure its growing affluence,
Myers constantly urges supporters
to make bequests to his HSUS; an
elderly lady in Boulder, Colo., re
cently obliged with $135,000. To
keep members interested, and to
keep cash ﬂowing into the till,
Myers uses his ﬁnely honed sense of
press—agentry. He once protested to
Mrs. Richard Nixon that her cat was
having too many kittens! Such an—
tics assure HSUS a golden harvest
of publicity.

A chief activity of the HSUS is
harrying research men.- For this
purpose it employs “investigators”
who go about the country seeking
employment in animal rooms of
medical schools and other research
organizations. Sometimes they file
voluminous “reports” of “bad con—
ditions,” to which harassed doctors
must reply. Recently, Myers’ opera—
tives gained employment at the Col
lege of Medical Evangelists in Los
Angeles, and at the Stanford Medi—
cal School in San Francisco. In each
case an effort was made to gather
evidence that would force the state
health department to revoke the cer—
tificates of the two schools—which
would be an effective way of. halting
laboratory research at both institu-
tions. The state health department
investigated, found no evidence of
ill treatment of animals.

More diﬁ‘icult to cope with, doc-
tors feel, are the well—meaning but
misguided eﬂorts of the Animal
Welfare Institute and its associated

D

Marc/2

lobbying organization, the Society
for Animal Protective Legislation,
to ensure the humane treatment of
animals that are used in medica
research. “

Christine Stevens, president of
the AWI and wife of Roger L.
Stevens, a real—estate broker and
former ﬁnance chairman of the
Democratic National Committee,
has been the most ardent promoter
of a bill introduced in the last session
of Congress by Sen. John Sherman
Cooper, Republican of Kentucky,
and co-sponsored by 12 Democratic
senators. The bill failed to get out
of committee during the last Con—
gress, but is slated for hearings this
spring.

On the surface the bill seems rea—
sonable enough, but medical scien-
tists fear what lies under the surface.
Says one, “It is an effort to torpedo
medical research at the federal
level.”

As originally introduced, the bill
provides that the federal govern
ment shall, in effect, license all
laboratories receiving federal funds
——and virtually all large hospitals
and university research laboratories
do. It lays down rules for animal
care, requires research men to have
federal licenses and provides that
animals subject to experimental sur-
gery “shall be killed without being
allowed to recover consciousness”—
thereby preventing a student in
surgery from observing} whether his
operation is a success or a failure.

The bill further requires that ex—
act records be kept for all animals

‘used. Consider what is involved
here: the cancer—screening program
alone, which is searching for chemi—
cal cures for cancer, is at present
utilizing two million" mice a year!
Under the proposed bill, also, re—
searchers would have to ﬁle “proj—
ect plans,” a provision scientists
particularly dislike. A researcher,
they note, is much like a gold pros—
pector—he doesn’t know in advance
where his search is going to lead
him.

Says Dr. Lester R. Dragstedt of
the University of Chicago, inventor
of the vagotomy, the surgical treat-
ment for peptic ulcers, “The Cooper
bill, if enacted, would inevitably
strangle with red tape research in
medicine, biology and agriculture.”

Dr. Frederick S. Philips of the
Sloan—Kettering Institute for Can—
cer Research makes an estimate of
speciﬁc results that might be ex-

VIVISECTION—AN EXPLOSIVE ISSUE AGAIN 61

pected from passage of the bill: “It
would waste at least ten percent of
the researchers’ time and cost the
government at least ten percent
more money for the same research.
Last year the federal grants for
medical research cost over 200 mil—
lion dollars. Ten percent of that is
20 million.”

Almost to a man, researchers
consider the Cooper bill as the
opening wedge for more stringent
legislation. It is based, they con—
tend, on the insulting notion that
medical-research men are cruel and
need watching. ‘

Everyone has a stake in this dis—
cussion—and will have so long as
problems like cancer, heart disease,
mental illness remain unsolved.
Congress will resolve the issue. It
may well be one of the most fateful
decisions ever to come before tha

legislative body. '

Satelltes Track Animals

Penguins and geese carrying tiny radios will soon re-
veal the mystery of their migration paths by relaying their exact
whereabouts by means of satellites, Barbara Tufty reports.

* NEW’ FACTS on ancient migration
habits of birds and beasts may come from
satellites in the sky.

A special instrument is being developed
in Minneapolis, Minn., for satellites to re—
ceive signals transmitted from tiny radios
strapped to the back of a deer, the chest of
a goose. the wing of an albatross. The sig—
nals would be relayed from the satellites
to ground stations to learn where the pen—
guins of Antarctica go after their mating
season, or where the Canadian geese ﬂy on
their annual voyage from the Arctic to
Texas.

“We hope to have our transmitter riding
‘piggyback’ on a research polar—orbiting
rocket next year,” stated Professor Dwain
W. Warner of the Museum of Natural His-
tory at the University of Minnesota at Min—
neapolis. Government ofﬁcials are now con—
sidering a proposal for space on a satellite
for a 30—day pilot study.

Animal movements and habits have been
surveyed closely for the last three or four
years by means of small radio transmitters
inserted on or in the animals. These trans—
mitters, weighing less than an ounce with
batteries included, can transmit a signal
for weeks without noticeably disturbing
the animal.

mals have been located and studied by scien-
tists carrying portable receivers in the ﬁeld.
But these short individual studies end when
the scientist goes home, or the bird ﬂies
over the horizon and disappears, Prof.
Warner pointed out.

With the satellite instrument, it will now
be possible to keep a round—the—clock vigil
on animals, no matter where they wander
on land, sea or air. ,./

About six or more animals of a herd ,a'r
ﬂock could each carry a transmitter ,a‘ind
power supply as they start on their migra-
tions, Prof. Warner said. The individual
groups could be identiﬁed by their own
special radio frequency. Their signals would
reach a satellite traveling 18,000 miles an
hour (approximately 5 miles a second) at
an altitude of 200 miles in an orbit over
both North and South Poles about once
every 103 minutes. Signals from the satellite
could reach a ground station from 1,200
miles.

Twenty-four of these receiving stations
could “cover” the earth, and an area 1,600
miles across could be scanned on each orbit.
Thus the track of the great north—south
migrations could be followed and correlated
with information on physiological and en—
vironmental factors that influence an ani—
mal’s behavior.

Planned Animal Care
Necessary for Research

> REPRESENTATIVES of 70 national or-
ganizations are planning ways to advance
laboratory animal care and maintain a max— ‘
imum rate of scientific progress, and con-
tinue the contributions of laboratory animals
to the health and welfare of the public.

Dr. Hiram E. Essex, president of the
National Society for Medical Research, em-
phasizes that the accuracy, efﬁciency, and
productivity of research depend upon elab-
orate and costly care of animals used for
study. Good care of experimental subjects
limits the number of conditions that could
produce misleading results.

Among the organizations represented in
current planning are: The American Medi-
cal Association, American Hospital Associa—
tion, American Veterinary Medical Asso—
ciation, American Public Health Association,
and American Nurses Association.

The representatives of health and science
organizations have expressed unanimous dis-
approval of legislation before Congress that,
in the name of humanity, would erect seri-
ous obstructions to research aimed at the
saving of life and preservation of health.
Speciﬁc criticism was directed at the Clark— ,
Neuberger bill to limit, license and police
research in biology, medicine and agri—
culture.

The scientists and health workers call for
constructive programs to develop better and
better methods, programs to spread infor—
mation on better methods, programs to train
more specialists, in laboratory animal care,
programs to build ever better laboratories
for research in the preservation of life and
health, and Opposition to the destructive
efforts of antivivisectionists.

As the end of another year approaches nothing seems to us so important in our industry as a steady purpose, without
regard to the howling of the popular press against what they see as “wrongs" in our industry. Reﬂecting on this, we
have devoted this issue of CAPSULES to a statement of our opinion, with a suggested course of action. We would,

needless to say, like to have your comments.

 

CAN WE AFFORD OUR PAST INACTION -

When any segment of an industry that touches the lives
of most of us comes under attack, as did US. Steel
last spring, most of the news media follow the same
course: over-emphasis on a particular feature that will
appeal to the mass audience, usually with an attitude
or opinion the editors wish to pursue. The results are
predictable: the public infers that there was some
gigantic business conspiracy afoot which, had it not
been exposed, would have cost it dearly.

Through the super-abundance of TV westerns, the
public has been “condition-reflexed” to equating bad
with black hats and good with white hats. Publishers
and editors have noted this fact, and so have politicians
who probably discovered it before the cowboys. Today,
the great mass of Americans cannot see grey at all,
whether it is in cowboy hats, politics, or most other
things. It reacts best to overstatement. Editors know
this. Politicians know it. We in the drug industry
should recognize the facts of life, too.

These are the facts:

We live in an era of press releases and counter press
releases, each developed and timed to make a particu-
lar point - however exaggerated. People have dis-
covered that it is not wise to try to explain their
positions, for the other side is waiting to take a sentence
out of context and whip them with it. Maybe this is
why you never catch politicians being “candid": they
have long since learned that candidness is twisted
and shaped by the press for the good of its own
editorial positions. “Informing the public" is sopho-
moric, except as a slogan.

We mean no criticism of the working press, that body
of astute men and women who go out to get the news,
whatever it may be. Reporters who are worth their
salt, and there are plenty of them, are surprisingly
unbiased in their work. The critical point comes after
they turn it in.

The best editorial work today is still being done by
editors whose audience is less than a quarter million,

each. THE ATLANTIC, HARPERS, THE REPORTER,

IN THE FUTURE?

I
n

and THE SATURDAY REVIEW are the more prom- " if;

inent general magazines which are noted for their
fairness and their thoroughness. 30 strong are their
reputations for fair play that there is hardly a news-
paper or mass circulated magazine editorial office in
America that can afford to ignore a single issue. They
have found these magazines a source of information
that is factual.

Publishers and editors occupy a singular position in
America. They have as much freedom as any press in
the world, yet they do not always show a fair measure
of responsibility to their publics. Late last year a
gynocologist-turned-writer had published a book,
CALORIES DON’T COUNT, without its controversal
parts being submitted to outside experts for comment.
The facts about this runaway best seller are now out,
and they show an almost fraudulent carelessness with
the facts - all with the hope of selling more copies by
telling readers what they want to hear, without re-
course to the facts.

Right , now, we’re going through a similar experience
with “Silent Spring".

Judgements must be based on all the facts:

It all boils down to the fact that the mass public is not
always able to make soundly based judgements if it
wanted to, on the basis of information presented to it
by TV, radio, newspapers, newsweeklies, and now
hard cover books. The facts simply aren’t there. The
late Elmer Davis, whose reporting was of the highest
calibre, suggested that the problem with information
dissimination was not in the reporting so much as the
editing. In his little book, “But We Were Born F ree",
published about ten years ago, he pointed up the
eroding of many of our personal freedoms, most of
which could be accounted for - at least in part - by not
living up to the responsibilities that go along with free-
dom of the press.

Unfortunately, the woes of the drug industry - which 'f'

has been practically frozen with a whiplash of adverse
public opinion in the past 18 months - will not vanish
with a series of corrective news releases, speeches, or
articles. They won't see the light of day, unless in
mutilated form, for the publishers are committed to a
more popular course.

A star to steer by:

What can we do? First, we should recognize that we
can do something. We should make it a policy to dis-
prove fantasy with fact, every time fantasy is presented
as fact. We should do it as many times as necessary
to get the facts across. We should do it in the same
media that allow news columns to present fantasy as
fact, regardless of the sources. We should do it with
the same space, or larger. We should do it as soon as
possible. We should buy the space that's needed, and
use it straight forwardly, forgetting all the gimmicks
in favor of the big truth.

When it is alleged (the public reads “proved”) that
the drug industry is knowingly selling unproven drugs,
we should counter with the facts. When Congress
rushes through a new drug bill and flys home before
election day to say how it has saved the electorate from
possible sudden death, we should counter with the
facts. Not once, not twice, but as many times as is
necessary to get them across.

We have neglected to tell our story in a forceful man-
ner, and so we are to blame for the public believing
what it heard against us. We have an important,
dramatic story to tell. It has all of the ingredients of a
best-selling novel. We should use these facts to full
advantage. Factually. Fast. Fearlessly.

Editorial:

As this year draws to a close it seems fitting that we in
the regulated food, drug, and cosmetic industries
pause for a moment to reflect on those happenings in

1962 that affect our industry.

We have seen the passage by Congress of new legisla-
tion spurred on by one or two unfortunate drug
incidents. This legislation attempts to accomplish by
formal prescription a set of ground rules already in
use by the responsible members of industry. It is in-
conceivable that those responsible for the production
and marketing of drugs would compromise safety for
profit. It is doubtful that the new legislation would
have prevented those unfortunate incidents that: have
occurred. May we not become so occupied with ful-
filling the letter of the new laws that we forget that
only through continued research and experimentation
can we really achieve safety in drugs.

We have also been affected by an aroused public 0-
pinion resulting from Rachel Carson's “Silent Spring”.
Pressures have been put on regulatory agencies that
have been reflected in increased demands for more
and more data. Here again, we wonder if the new
pressures will really guard against the doom predicted
by Miss Carson. Much research effort is being sub-
verted to provide the increasing demands of more and
more conventional data. Would the world ‘not be better
off if this research effort were devoted to a more basic
understanding of how to cope with man’s competition
with insect for his food? There is ample evidence that
with the limited scientifically trained manpower avail-
able, one does not accomplish one goal without neg-
lecting the other. Which goal, then, is more important?

Perhaps in future years we can look back on 1962 and
be thankful. Perhaps we can be thankful that 1962
was the year when we were forced to again look to
basic research to lead us out of the pathways that led
to restrictive legislation and “Silent Spring”. It is
characteristic of American industry that in the face of
adversity, it rises best to challenge. The year 1962 has
been one of adversity. The year 1963 will see the be-
ginning of a new era in life sciences arising from this
adversity; a new emphasis on basic research; a new age
in conquering disease, malnutrition and discomfort.

A STATEMENT CONCERBING ANIMAL CARE LEGISLATAIQ‘

Thai-Executive Faculty‘of the University of ‘Oregon Medical School has
discussed-at some length the implications of certain legislative prOposals

-which we re introduced at the last session of Congress. Even though HR l937

(Griffiths), HR 3556 (Moulder), and S 3088 (Clark) were not debated on the
floor. there is every reason to believe that essentially the same proposals'

will be brought before the Congress again at its current and future sessions.

' Since the provisions of these bills would have a profound effect upon the opera-

tionrof research activities at your state's institutions of higher education, we
think it might be of interest to you .to know the reactions of this faculty.

All of these bills seek to attain laudable objectives. They are directed
it. improving the treatment-and care of animals .used in. biological and medical
research by recipients of research grants from federal agencies. This is a
goal which is actively sought by eve r'y biological and medical scientist. Every
’scientist knows that the condition of his experimental mate rial, whether it be.
living ornot, is of critical importance to the success of‘ his experiments. In
addition to humane considerations and respect for life, it is in the interestof
the biomedical investigator to provide for the optimum care. comfort and
health of his living experimental subjects. Thus. from the point of View of
objectives and goals,’ we 'are in basic agreement with the authors of these bills.

When we examine the. specific provisions of these bills. we find many
that describe standard practices vin'animal care 'operations. We find some
which we believe would establish police actions which would be dangerous in '
their implications., We find some which would appear to be incompatible with
existing laws. We find some which we believe would be simply impractical.
We believe that the imposition of some of the regulations described in these

'prOpOped bills would seriously limit the exercise of scientific and professional

Judgment. The frequent use in the bills. of such w‘ords.as "adequate". "appro-
priate”. "unnecessary","severe", "prolonged". ”maximum". "substantially

_ equal" require the exercise 'of value judgments. many of which cannot be made

outside of the detailed scientific context of the situation, and must be made by
the scientist himself with the help of his colleagues. The bills provide for the
establishment of a group of inspectors-who would be required to make the
kinds of value judgments indicated above. Considering the number of unfilled
faculty positions in educational institutions. and the vigor with which industrial
organizations are recruiting biologists, it is probable that all capable. trained
scientists. experienced in making the judgments required of the inspectors
called for in these bills. are-already employed-in various scientific capacities.

The refore. when we go beneath the primary aimswand examine the philosO-
phies, the attitudes and the assumptions underlying the provisions of these
bills, we find a great deal of cause for concern. in general. the orientation of
these bills is retrospective; they look backward in time over a period during
which rapid changes have been taking place. The philos0phy expressed seems
to us to be a restrictive, directive. and controlling philosophy based upon
implied assumptions which we believe. are inadequate and inaccurate.

of Oregon Medical-School. and at other institutions as' v'aiell‘, that failure to ‘
achieve ideal conditions has not been the result of inadequate m‘Ot'iv‘atiioh 8r
effort. Rather; .it is our opinion that deficiencies in the care of(eitperime(iital
animals have stemmed from three sources: (1) from lack of hnowledge about

how to' define and to achieve the conditions {or the best possible carei'iZl'f‘rom

 




. lack of facilitiee and epace for adequate enirrfel houaing end meintenance: '
(3) and.frorn leek of funde to provide both the facilitiee endthe treined pereon-

COWTS-Ol ”A STATVMERT CONCENIM'ANIMAL CARR LEGISLII'IM”

In.his statenent Dean Baind says that the bills to require hmnne
,‘Wyatmenb. of animals used in experiments and tests “seek to attain
.laudable objectives," but he expresses blanket apposition to the
. legislation. He does not distinguish between the different bills nor
does he discuss their provisions except in gemral terns.

l'e analyse the statement paragraph by paragraph:

- 1) It is stated that the lqislation under discussion will‘ be ,
brought before the Congress, and this has now been done in the Clark.-
.leuberger bill, so 533. ‘ . _ . . ' , -

. 2) It is stated that' the: goal or ' roving the treatment and oars
or animals used. in biological and nedica research by recipients of
research. grants from federal agencies“ ts ”a oel which is actively

- sought by every biological and medical soient st.‘ Oar visits te
laboratories show this statement to be erroneous. Some scientists are
interested: others are not. . . '

3) A series or generaliiations without reference to the proviaions
. «of any bill are presented. t is not stated what is meant by ”miles
actions which would be dangerous in Mr imlications" nor what
provisions would be ”incompatible with existim leis" nor which would
be “simply iapraoticalJ' It is not possible to cement on the“
allegations other than to state that, in our opinion, wey in ne way
apply ta 3- 53’s - ' . . ‘

'WJeotion is made to ”value Judnents", and to the difficulty er
filling the posts or inspectors. Binoe 1876 such value judgments have
been nude in Great Britain b able inspectors all or Ito. have medical
qualifications. We'do not be ieve that the United States is interim-
te Great Britain and incapable of accomplishing the humane objectives
which have been so well carried out in the Bri ish Lot upon whose
principles 8. S33 is based. ’ -

h) It is stated that the. "philosophy, of the legislatia is ”based
upon implied assumptions which we believe are inadequate and inaccurate.”
As shown below, Dean Baird has made assmlptial's based on assumtims
which are untrue. " . . - }

‘

S) It is ~stated that there is an ”implied assumption”. that ”the
biomedical investigator operates in the couplets absenee of any ethical
structure to guidehi- in the conduct of his experiments.” Ii'hat is not
true, and an examination ‘or the Information Reports e! tb Anise).
'elfare Institute will show, ‘for example, "The Guiding Principles“ of
the Anerican Physiological Society given first'page pronine’nce when
they were, drawn up: rules adopted in a' Mr of individual institutions
have been reprinted inlfi‘erent issues or the Internation Repertr ‘l'ne '
hinl lelrare Institute has never assumed any of the things clai-ed
in paragraph 5 of Dean Baird's statenent. We know fro- first-hand
observation, however, that voluntary ethical standards have not been
successful in preventing gres's abuses of the privilege of using ’
experimental animals. . .

 




-2-

' 6) Reference is made to various voluntary codes and to the
Animal Care Panel. Representatives of the Animal Welfare Institute
have attended every annual meeting of the Animal Care Panel since
1952 and have frequently commented on the activities of this
organization in the pages of the Information Report. Some ef its
activities are helpful; on the other hand, it is in the pages of
the Proceedings of the Animal Care Panel that we find reference to
keeping monkeys in monkey chairs (devices similar to the stocks)
for five months without ever being removed. Or we observe ale
unanesEEetized mouse after_another being slowly killed by an. .
incompetent person trying to stick a glass tube into the corner of
the mouse's eye to draw blood at the Do It Yourself" session ef
the Animal Care Panel. Or we observe an unanesthetiaed rabbit being
tied tightly down on its back, its paws pulled back by leather thongs,
its head'wedged in a V~shaped notch, and we listen to the recommendation
that irritating substances be placed in the rabbits.’ eyu'while they
are thus immobilized. These and many similar observations lead us to
believe that those who, according to Dean Baird's statement, 'share
in§the Animal Care Psnel'sjdevotion to the improvement of practices
in the use and care of research animals? need other guidance which
would be effectively provided by-enaetment of 8. 533.

.7) It is stated that'biomedical investigators are as concerned
about the condition and care of their animals as physicians are about‘.
their human patients.” How does this statement agree with the
statement of a veterinarian at a local Animal Care Panel meeting.that
he had to buy twice as many cats as sand be called for, as there_was a

505 mortality? Or what of our observations of dogs that had undergone.
~ such severe surgery that they could not arise and so were hosed .
along with their cages and were dripping wet and shivering? Or what
of dogs with great clusters of ticks on their heads, dogs confined to
cages too small to stand or lie in normal position? I could go on
for pages, but there is so much material in the hearings that it
seems unnecessary to take more space here to comment on this statement
of Dean Baird‘s. ‘ . -

. 8) It is stated that failure ‘to‘schioeve the ideal in the treatnmt
of experimental animals comeszfrqm”labk*of-knowledge, lack of
facilities, and lack of funds. While any or‘all of these factors can
contribute to a bad situation, the provision of funds and information
is not enough to correct the present situation in our country. It
know this from observation over a period of eleven years. lb have
made strenuous efforts during.that time to provide information on
care and housing of laboratory animals. Our 68-page illustrated manual.
"Basic Care of Experimental Animals," has been available free to all
scientific institutions, and more‘than 17,000 copies have been supplied
to them. Our loose-leaf manual, "Comfortable Quarters for Laboratory
Animals," (109 pages) for which four different supplements have been
prepared and sent out, gives plans, drawings and photographs of the
best existing quarters. t, too,-is free to laboratories and is very
widely distributed. ‘ ‘, . '

As for funds, more money has been spent in the past few years
to build and run laboratory animal quarters than ever before in history.
Nevertheless, poorg bad, and sometimes ghastly conditions continue to
exist. Most discouraging is the fact.that the newest animal quarters

 




-3- ’

are, not infrequently, the most uncomfortable forthe animals. Over
and Lver again, millions of dollsrs have been spent on buildings in
which the experimental dogs are confined for life to small, allometel

_ cages in windowless rooms. In c number of instances which we have
observed, the older quarters provided decent space for exercise and

a comfortable resting'placc forJ t-hesc'animals, while the new quarters,
however, costly, eliminated both these basic requirements. It will be
recalled, too, that the Feed and Drug Administration requested
025,000,000 for a'building in which it planned to keep dogs permanently
’oaged without exercise, until Congress wisely intervened to change

_ 9) It is stated that' funds ,have been used st the Oregon medical
School to improve conditions. Io are glad to hear this. We have never
visited this School. . - u .

_ 10) Dean Baird assumes in thisparagruph that the proposed
legislaticm deals with care and housing only, but this is not so.
8. S33 deals with all 'hspec'ts of preventing needless suffering to
these animals, including the humane design of experiments. is .
stated above, it has been clearly demonstrated that funds alone are
no guarantee of humane care and housing. Further, care and housing
constitute one part only of the provisions of the bill.

. 11) It is stated that ”The Congress can insure" the achievement e
and neintenance of acceptable conditions by creating a guidim
omission of scientists and government officers to supervise the
conduct of these programs in a manner which does not infringe upon
scientific and professional judgnent." This probably refers to i
counter-proposal being circulated by Ir. Ralph Romeder, Executive
.Gecrctary of the National Society for ledical Research, whose
testimonyst- the House hearings on the legislation asserted that
laboratory enimals are ”more pamered than pets." His proposal and
his testimony appear to be of approxiutely equal value.

. 8. 533, based on the British Act of 1876, should have the
'support of American scientists. The British Act is the result of

Itch tins and care expended by first-rate scientific and legal brains
who developed first its principles and then itt practice. British
scientists workim under its provisions have a high regard for the
Act. It does not discourage them. from doing first-rate research. It
mly discourages cruel and ill-planned research, at! it is difficult

to see why the tax-payer should be asked to encourage research which
falls into that category. ~ .

P . .

12) It is stated that the bills "would increase tremendously.
the cost of the nation's biomedical research effort.” 8. 533 giVOI
(limit to the cost, n-ely, $500,000 annually. This is a very small y
amount of money to expend to ensure decent treatment of t nillions
of animals used annually in .laborutories in our country. t is a
very small proportion of money spent on research involving living

s

animals which provided by the tax-payer, and itwould, without 4
question, save money as well as suffering by cutting down onthe
sickness and death of laboratory animals resulting from causes other
than experiments to which they have been mbjected. Finally, it would
increase the quality of research. ' ' ' .

Mrs. Christine Stevens

Society for Animal Protective
Legislation

745 Fifth Avenue

New York 22, New York

Dear Mrs. Stevens

Thank you for writing me about the federal legislation
pertaining to the use of animals in research.

I am sure that the American Hospital Association is not
now and never has been opposed to the humane treatment

of animals. In fact, quite to the contrary. we have
continued to urge every effort be made to insure that
animals used in medical research be adequately housed,
properly fed and humanely treated. We have been a parti-
cipant in a group to develop a voluntary program which
might accredit facilities and which would establiéh a set
of standards as a basis for such accreditation.

I believe you are mistaken in your opinion of the Asso—
ciation's position. We simply do not believe this is an
area for federal action and for federal control. Certainly
state laws should be fully inforced and we are hopeful that
an effective voluntary program of accreditation will be
undertaken.

I certainly enjoyed seeing Mr. Glancy in Washington a few
weeks ago. He, too, thinks you are a wonderful person.
