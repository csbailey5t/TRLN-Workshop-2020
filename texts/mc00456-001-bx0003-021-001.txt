A THOUGHT FROM RUSKIN

I will not hurt or kill any living thing needlessly,
Nor destroy any beautiful thing,

But will strive to save and comfort all gentle life
And protect all natural beauty.

51w Wen 0! England

efﬁN the beginning God made a Garden, and, to
jthose who love her, this England of ours has

1/.) always been the most beautiful of all gardens.

' L—Ijlgggln fact, we know the whole world to be the
czauizzGarden of God, and we venerate and love it
more than we do our own poor little gardens that are so

jealously tended.

(L Let us respect the countryside and preserve its beauty,
for some day God will come again to His Garden, and we
shall be speechless with shame when we suddenly realize
what we have done to it.

(L For we have picked the ﬂower: and uprooted the form,
torn the branches 03’ the trees, caught the little mom
in torturing traps, robbed the oirds’ nests, set ﬁre to the
gorse and heather, and left broken bottles and dirty paper
everywhere.

(L Let us consider whether we can restore its beautv
again to this Garden. We have but to stop our wanton
destruction and Nature will do all the rest for us.
