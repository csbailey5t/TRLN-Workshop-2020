The Humane Education Society

 

(I

By HUMANE EDUCATION we mean the awakening and fostering,
particularly in the mind of the child, of those principles of justice,
fair play and kindness towards every form of life capable of suffering.”

The Objects of Humane Education Circles are:

1. To stop all forms of cruelty to human beings; to birds and animals.

2. To this end to quicken in our colleges, schools and elsewhere that
Spirit of chivalry and humanity which shall ﬁnally end warfare.
prevent lawlessness, cruelty and crime.

3. To awaken and sustain interest in Humane Education in homes
and schools.

4. To meet together for discussion and mutual help.

5. To supply to those interested, lists of books, stories, poems, plays,
pictures, and other useful information.

 

SUGGESTIONS FOR TEACHERS

Make sure that the subject is included in the syllabus, but if not,
see that appropriate lessons are given, e.g.:

((2) HISTORY. Include the life of various eminent men and women
who did kindly and good deeds.

(b) LITERATURE. Choose poems and stories illustrative of the
subject, and point out that practically all great writers are
sympathetic towards Humane Education.

(6) NATURE STUDY. See that animal life as well as plant life is
included in the scheme. Give deﬁnite instruction concerning
the care of animals. The Animals’ Friend Publishing Dept..
The National Council for Animals’ Welfare._and the School
Nature Study Union, publish very useful leaﬂets, etc.

(d) PICTURES. These are of great use .in teaching if. carefully
chosen. Take down from the walls pictures inculcatlng cruelty
in any form. Use constructive ideas.

(6) SCRIPTURE LESSON. This lesson provides innumerable oppor-
tunities for instruction in the subject.

Contributions, no matter how small, to provide instructive Litera—
ture and Lectures, will be gratefully acknowledged. Kindly note

THE ROYAL JIUBlllLlEE 19104935

The Prince of Wales has truly said that :—

“There is in the heart of practically every man, woman
and child in our nation to— day, a real desire to be a
friend towards animals. Kindly deeds react upon our
own character and make us better citizens.”

We print below, extracts from an Act of Parliament, passed
in the early period of His Majesty’s reign. We hope that 1935
will witness the passing of all Humane Bills now in readiness.

The 1911 Act covers a veryiwide range and, if administered in
the right spirit by’all concerned, it could easily lead to the ending
of many forms of cruelty and neglect which still exist.

THE PiR'OTiEClTION O'F ANIMALS ACT, 1911.

If any person shall cruelly beat, kick, ill- tréat, over- -ride,
over- -drive, over- -l,oad torture, infuriate, or terrify any animal,
or shall convey or carry any animal in such a manner or
position as to cause suffering, or underfeed or expose to
weather without sufﬁcient food and shelter any animal, or
shall cause any animal unnecessary suffering before or While
killing it for food; such person shall be guilty of an offence
of cruelty, and liable to .a ﬁne [not exceeding

£25 and/or Six Months’ Imprisonment with or
without hard labour.

If it be considered by the court, through evidence as to
previous conviction or the character of the owner, that an
animal is likely to be exposed to further cruelty, the court
may deprive such person of the ownership of the animal and
dispose of it as they think ﬁt under the circumstances.

The word “animal” applies to any animal or bird.

Citizens and Police Officers have power to take proceedings
under the Act.

SPECIAL N OTE.-—-PLEASE REMEMBER: That dogs and
cats, and other creatures, if badly treated, or kept in small rooms
and cellars without prOper exercise and friendship, may go mad
and attack people, thus causing disease and death. People
responsible for such things have a lot to answer for.

Humane Education is the Best Way to Eliminate
Ignorance, Cruelty and Warfare.

EDUCATION AND UNIVERSAL KINSHIP

“It is the Hope of the world to establish Goodwill between
Nations. The future of a League of Nations can be
guaranteed only by a League of Human Hearts and Minds,
bound together by the Golden Chain of Justice, Friendship
and Compassion for all creatures.”

—-J. .R. NICHOLS, (Congress of Teachers’ and Parents’).

“The essential principles of true education are not just Mathe-
matics, Language-s, Science, all good in their way, but the
development of Character, and the working out of the savage
still in us, and the evolution of those qualities which enrich
and beautify life here and now, in all our relationship with

others.” -
——ERNEST BELL, M.A.

REPORT FOR 1934
.3 ﬂ Brief Record of Work

A great thinker has well deﬁned Education as

“The unfolding and development of our individuality,
to the best of purposes, in all direction-s.” This is
the principle upon which we work—emphasising the
connection between Humane Education, Goo-d Citizen—
ship, Peace and Goodwill to all.

The Committee and Ofﬁcers have pleasure in presenting
their Report for the past year. Sound, practical work has been
accomplished with the valuable aid of many teachers, journalists,
speakers, welfare workers, and the splendid co—operation of
members and friends in all parts of the country and abroad.

Sincere and grateful thanks are given to all who have helped
forward the Movement in so many directions. We regret that
we cannot publish a full record of their kind and practical work
so freely given, often at great sacriﬁce of time, energy and
money. Reasons of space and cost in printing compel us to
keep within well-deﬁned limits.

ﬂ Tribute of Remembrance

We record with deep regret the passing of many good
friends who, in their quiet kindly way, gave of their best in the
interests of all creatures in need of friendship and protection.
Their inﬂuence and example live on to inspire and encourage
us in our difﬁcult task of making life better and happier for
others.

Our Policy

Our policy of concentrating upon educational work in Schools,
Colleges, Homes, Youth and Adult Centres, has been amply
justified by results. Petitions, Public Meetings, Parliamentary
Deputations, have been tried for many generations. Progressive
Members of Parliament have done their best, only to see their
efforts and those of many earnest people defeated.

The need for better and quicker action

Consequently, the Humane Education Society concentrates
upon work of a constructive nature that brings quicker and
better results. It has been well said that less Party Politics and
more practical kindly deeds, building up Character and Friend-
ship, are the best ways to overcome cruelty and warfare. We
do not, of course, relinquish our efforts to speed up Parliamentary
action concerning wise legislation. Our representatives in Parlia-
ment are in constant touch with us on Humane affairs. They
are desirous of bringing about better conditions.

Directors of Education and Teachers

As a result of interviews, correspondence, and practical
work, we have secured the co—operation of many Directors of
Education, Local Education Authorities, Head Teachers and
Assistant Teachers. Letters and reports received testify to the
value of our methods.

Work amongst young people

Our Secretary has received many requests to submit outlines
of Humane Education. He has been invited to many Schools,
also Youth and Adult Centres where assemblies of children,
parents, teachers, have listened with much interest to illustrated
talks and lectures concerning the welfare of animals and birds,
Nature Study, Citizenship, Peace, Protection of the Countryside,
and the wider issues of life and duty.

The Manchester Guardian, in a paragraph concerning our
educational work, has stated that :————

“The Humane Education Society is an instance of an
organisation with Headquarters in Manchester, and
groups of workers in London and elsewhere. Afﬁliated
to it are Teachers’ Groups throughout the country, incul—
cating humanitarian principles on the broadest lines.

 

 

 

 




 

8

“Thus the fellow-feeling which recognises the rights of
cats and dogs and birds, is linked to the Peace and
Progress Cause so popular in Youth Movements, while
love of natural beauty for its own sake has its corollary
in the care and protection of plants and ﬂowers and the
countryside. Humane Education lecturers blend the
subject with Nature Study, Citizenship, and other subjects
for which school curricula provide. This is a point worth
stressing, for while there are many well—intentioned people
who are ready advocates of kindness to animals and birds,
there is a shortage of those who can ﬁt the subject with its
natural setting of the study and love of Nature and life
as a whole.”

Films and Lantern Lectures

On behalf of the National Council for Animals’ Welfare,
and in co—operation with our Northern Groups, Mr. Harper
Cory and Miss Dorothy Barrs arranged a series of Film and
Lantern Lectures in various Schools and Picture Houses during
‘ February and March. Thousands of children, and many
hundreds of teachers and parents were thus introduced to Nature
Study and Welfare Teachings.

All the Manchester papers and numerous local journals in
Lancashire and Cheshire gave generous reports of the proceed—
ings. “The Manchester Guardian” stated that :—

“His (Mr. Harper Cory’s) lectures are familiar in style
and packed with material personally collected like his
writings, some of which have appeared in ‘The Manchester
Guardian.’ ”

The Editor of “ Our Circle ”———the well-known 'Co—operative
Society journal—attended one of the Film Lectures in the
Rivoli Picture House, Manchester, and gave a most interesting
report, illustrated with ﬁne photographs.

The area covered by the lectures was a large one, including
Liverpool, Manchester, Widnes, Warrington, Swinton, Stret-
ford, Stockport, Bacup, Rochdale, and other places, then through
the Midlands and on to the South. The National «Council record
their sincere thanks to The Humane Education Society and the
Secretary and Committee for valuable service willingly given.

Blood Sports and Warfare

We have taken part in‘the active Campaign against all forms
of cruel and debasing sport, and have emphasised the fact that

 




 

9

to take boys and girls to the hunting ﬁeld to engage in killing
hares, foxes, stags and other creatures, for pleasure, and to
smear the cheeks of young people with blood from the victims,
is a violation of Ethical and Christian Teachings. Many journa—
lists have rendered valuable service in setting forth the truth of
Hunting.

We note that claims are made that hunting animals makes
young men ﬁt for warfare. It is of importance to note that
several Ministers of State and Politicians participate. in Blood
Sports—in some cases, even when on Peace Missions. Can we
be surprised at the failure of efforts concerning Peace and
Disarmament. There is here a direct connection between cruelty
and warfare.

ﬁn Opinion Worth Noting

A Master in a Public School, and a Vice-President of The
Humane Education Society, has well said that :—

“It is useless to hope that warfare, which is but one of
many savage survivals, can be abolished until the mind
of man is humanised in other respects also . . . Let
those who have been horriﬁed by the spectacle of a terrible
war resolve to support the Peace Movement more than
ever; but let them also support the still wider and deeper
Humanitarian Movement of which paciﬁsm is but a part,
inasmuch as all Humane Causes, though seemingly sepa-
rate, are ultimately and essentially one.”

The Rights and Welfare of Horses

During the year we have been constantly active amongst
horse-owners, drivers, transport companies, and public authori—
ties concerning the welfare of horses. Many improvements in
stabling, feeding, harness, shoeing, and general treatment are
recorded. There is now a much higher standard than formerly,
yet much remains to be done. Our experience proves that the
vast majority of cases of cruelty and neglect are due to ignorance
and bad economic conditions. Practical Humane Teachings are
of vital importance for the welfare of horses, ponies and donkeys.
We are very pleased to report that the Home of Rest for Horses
at Norbury Hall, near Manchester, has been taken over by Mr..
W. H. Hancock, a real lover of horses. Many old and unﬁt
horses, ponies and donkeys are now enjoying the remainder of
their days under the kindly care of himself and helpers.

Worn—out Horse Traﬁ‘ic

The Government still delay the passing of the Bill to end
this miserable Trafﬁc. We have co—operated with The Inter-
national League for Horses and The International Bureau in
bringing this matter before successive Parliaments and The
League of Nations. In the meantime, whilst doing all we can
to get the Government to protect our old and faithful friends,
by prohibiting their export for butchery and further work
abroad, we are striving our utmost toovercome the dealers in
this vile, ungodly business. Our appeals have led to numbers of
owners refusing to sell to dealers, and having their horses
humanely killed in their own district. Several dealers have now
gone out of the business, and the number sold for export is
dwindling. In 1924, 25,000 horses were shipped to the Con-
tinent ; the Campaign against the Trafﬁc, so ably carried forward
by Miss A. M. F. Cole and others, led to the number falling to
7,000 in 1926, and to 3,179 in 1933. Of course, economic factors
also had their inﬂuence in certain directions in bringing about
this striking reduction.

The Trafﬁc is now at a low ebb, and it would be quite easy
for the Government to pass the Bill to stop this odious Trafﬁc
entirely. Owing to splendid efforts of Sir George Cockerill and co—
workers, over 400 Members of Parliament have agreed to support
the Bill, yet for some reason unexplained, this urgent Measure
of reform is held up time after time. Mr. E. A. Radford, M.P.,
and Mr. Henderson Stewart, €M.P., have rendered good service
to our movement.

ﬂnotber Urgent Need

The licensing and training of persons engaged in buying and
selling of horses, and all kinds of living creatures, is long over—
due. There are many dealers who have no conception of the
feelings of the animals they deal in. It has been found necessary
to test drivers of motor cars regarding their qualiﬁcations with
a View to reducing the sad toll of life on the roads; it would be
wise and just to test and license all dealers in living sensitive
creatures, and thus bring about better and happier conditions in
this department.

Pit Ponies

We are pleased to record the fact that steady progress is
being made concerning this section of reform. Lancashire stands
high in the list as one of the counties where few ponies are
employed in the pits. The Manchester Collieries, a large group
of owners, have done away with ponies and horses below ground.
There are, however, certain coal-ﬁelds where much remains to
be done.

Captive and Performing flm'mals

Regarding shows in various places, we have continued our
efforts to end the business. We are pleased to note increasing
alertness on the part of the public, and especially amongst young
people, concerning the silliness, cruelty and waste in training
wild or domesticated animals to perform foolish antics or even
clever tricks day after day, at Matinees and Evening Shows, for
the sake of profits and entertainment.

Whilst it is only fair to state that most of the big shows
are well conducted, and the animals regularly fed and kept clean,
etc., it yet remains true that the whole business is based upon a
wrong conception of Justice and Fair Play.

Teachers’ Resolution

We note with pleasure that many assemblies of Teachers
have now passed resolutions protesting against these shows, and
the taking of children to see them.

No properly educated man, woman or child can admit that
it is right to make pleasure and proﬁt out of the misery and
exploitation of any creature.

Cruelty to Cats

A number of cases of revolting cruelty to cats and kittens
in various towns have been investigated by our representatives.
Inquiries reveal the fact that most of these crimes are committed
by certain types of youths who have not had the advantage of
proper training in early years.

Many of the offenders live in bad social environment. Many,
on being questioned, state that they have witnessed scenes in
slaughter—houses and killing dens where lambs, calves, sheep,
cows, poultry, etc., are done to death. Others have witnessed
Blood Sports and have imitated their elders of the hunting ﬁeld
and coursing grounds.

Head Teachers, in various places where cruelty has been
reported, have readily co—operated with us in wise action to
overcome these tendencies.

Vivisection and Cruel Research Experiments

We are pleased to note that as a result of Humane Teach-
ings, along with Healthy Life Principles of moral and social
hygiene, there is a marked tendency against this cruel and
unnecessary practice which involves the exploitation of thousands
of defenceless creatures.

 

 




 

 

12

Dr. Beddow Bayley and other medical writers have pub—

lished many striking articles on the subject, showing that it

violates moral, scientiﬁc, and spiritual principles. The poison
gas experiments have aroused deep indignation.

RESCUE AND CARE OF STRAYS
Unwanted Dogs and Cats

We cannot speak too highly of our many voluntary workers
in all districts who constantly help in this important section. Not
only do they feed the outcasts, but they restore the ill and injured
animals to health and happiness whenever possible, and help us
to ﬁnd really good homes for these victims of man’s inhumanity
and thoughtlessness. We would like to publish the names of
these friends in letters of gold if it were possible. They work
on quietly and steadily behind the scenes, amid the stress and
poverty of large industrial areas.

Saving the dog friends of people in need

Year after year our members come to the aid of many old
and unemployed people who can no longer pay for a Licence
for their faithful dog friend. We have thus been able to bring
happiness to many by preventing the unjust destruction of their
dog because of inability of the owner to pay the tax of 7 5. 6d.

We again urge upon the Authorities the urgent need of
making some concession in such cases. It is most unjust that
the life of a happy dog, a friend of the family or of lonely people,
should be demanded when owners can no longer pay the tax.

_ Furthermore, all Dog Licences should date from the month
1n \'.'h1Ch a dog IS taken into any home and not from January lst.

BALANCE OF NATURE
Mass shooting of Wood Pigeons and other Feathered Friends

. We endeavour year by year to teach something of the great
prlnciples of the Balance of Nature. Thousands of beautiful
birds are being shot in various parts of the country, the slaughter
being arranged by groups of farmers for various reasons, and
by those who ﬁnd pleasure in killing for sport.

It is the old story of “ The Birds of Killingworth ” so well
set forth long ago by Longfellow, concerning the conceit, selﬁsh—
ness and ignorance of mankind.

 




 

13

It is said by the advocates of these methods of destruction
that many species of birds are injurious to agricultural interests.

It cannot be too often emphasised that creatures of the
countryside have their rightful place in the scheme of nature
and do useful work, even though it be not apparent to those of
narrow perception.

In any case, it ill-becomes mankind to talk of birds and
animals being destructive, whilst through wrong thought and
action we have warfare, and even in time of peace destroy food
because of a foolish unscientiﬁc system of dealing with national
affairs. Scientiﬁc investigation reveals the fact that ruthless
methods of destruction are wrong. We must endeavour to ﬁnd
out the causative factors underlying the problem of life and
nature.

Expert Opinion

The late T. A. Coward, a clever and careful observer of bird
life, and a scientiﬁc writer of some distinction, long ago pointed
out that “organised shoots ” and other scare actions will have
little permanent effect. Man is responsible in the largest degree
for the difﬁculties of over—abundance and for destruction.

These urgent questions concerning bird and animal life, the
Balance of Nature and methods of adjustment, cannot be left
to the crude, ignorant methods of people with guns, traps and
hounds

Scientists, students of Nature, are pointing out the impor—
tance of right teachings and wise methods.

Musk Rats—Wearing of Furs

Already several counties are paying heavily for allowing
Musk Rats to be imported. Severe damage has been done to
public property by these hardy and proliﬁc fur—bearers. Disease,
destruction and death constantly follow in the wake of man’s
disobedience to Nature’s laws. Wrong methods in dress and
diet levy a heavy toll. Beneath most of these problems we ﬁnd
human selﬁshness and commercialism.

Year by year we endeavour to spread the truth of these
things amongst all classes of the community. Our special talks
and leaﬂets have been of great service.

Dissection of ﬂnimals in certain Schools

This question was raised at the Conference on New Ideals
in Education at Oxford. One speaker stated that “dissection
was an essential part of the teachings of Biology.” He went on

 

 

 

 




 

 

14

to say that “ reproduction, including that of the mammals, ought
to be studied in full.” Then, after other remarks, he admitted
that there are many arguments against dissection in schools, and
that “ his own boys began cutting up animals—as a regular part
of the course—at the age of thirteen. If, at this age, a boy had
a particular objection to dissection, he was, of course, exempted
from doing it.” He could see no danger of children losing
reverence for life through dissecting animals.

With due respect to this man and to those who support his
point of view, we can give instances of children being adversely
affected by this method of instruction, especially where animals
have been shown alive to the class, then killed and dissected.

The important question is this: Have we any moral right

to deprive animals of their life simply in order to give lessons
to children? Lessons in biology can be given, and are given,
in a far better and more effective way. The use of special ﬁlms,
models and illustrations, render unnecessary this exploitation of
animals. _
Evidence from reliable sources reveals that the exhibition
of dissected animals to young people has caused mental and
nervous distress. In one case where a dissected cat was shown
to the class, much feeling was displayed. Many clever teachers
consider such methods unnecessary.

ﬂnimals’ Welfare Weeks

The Animals’ Welfare Groups working in co-operation with
The Humane Education Society, have pleasure in reporting a
very successful time throughout many counties.

Thanks are due to Directors of Education, especially the.

Chief Director for Lancashire, who so kindly sent out a special
memorandum to Head Teachers calling attention to the value of
Humane Teachings. Applications for supplies of literature were
received from all quarters. Children have responded excep—
tionally well to the lessons and talks. They take home the special
hints and leaﬂets, thus handing on the ideas and knowledge
embodied therein to parents, relatives and friends.

Special Meetings

Her Grace The Duchess of Hamilton and Miss Lind-af-
Hageby addressed a Public Meeting in the Memorial Hall on
May 16th, over which Sir John Mathewson Watson, ].P.,
presided. ‘He reCounted several interesting incidents in which
he had been concerned with pit ponies and other creatures. Sir
John is a man of broad sympathies, and is one of the workers
in the North for poor children and blind babies.

15

A most inspiring Address was given by The Duchess of
Hamilton and Miss Lind-af—Hageby, who emphasised the prac-
tical value of Humane Education in all departments of life. We
owe a deep debt of gratitude to these gifted ladies who give
their time, money and energy to this great Cause. Their work
is known throughout this country and many others.

Teachers, Journalists, Scouts and Guides co—operated with
us during the Special Weeks devoted to this Nation-wide effort,
so ably organised by The National Council and workers in every
town and city.

Mr. J. E. Dorsett presided at the Business Meeting held on
the same day, when reports were read and approved.

After many years service as Chairman of Committee, Mr.
Dorsett has now resigned. We place on record our sincere
appreciation of his services; we shall miss his help in various
ways, and trust that he will have health and happiness in all
that he is doing for the welfare of others.

We are pleased to record that Councillor George Grimshaw
has most kindly consented to become our Chairman in response
to a unanimous invitation, even though so busy in the religious
and social life of the community. We are also fortunate in
having Mr. Ernest Cadman, another of our active workers in
civic life, as Deputy-Chairman.

The Committee express sincere thanks to Mr. A. C. Robin—
son, who for many years helped forward our Campaign and
acted as Hon. Treasurer during 1933 and 1934.

More Literature and Posters needed

We are in great need of more money for printing of leaﬂets
and posters. These accomplish splendid work when wisely and
systematically dealt with. We express grateful thanks to our
Vice—President, Alderman J. C. Grime, J.P., M.B.E., for his
generous help with posters, also for his Daily Message to the
people on all the advertising stations of his large and well—
organised company. These Messages cause thousands to think
more kindly and deeply.

Slaughter House Victims

Disgraceful scenes are constantly witnessed in connection
with the transport and slaughter of bullocks, cows, calves, sheep
and lambs. Our workers have made observations at railway
sidings, markets and slaughter-houses. We have records of
many cases similar to the following.

 

 

 




 

 

 

16

A young Hereford bullock became terriﬁed in the municipal
slaughter—house of a great city. It scattered the slaughter men
right and left in its frantic efforts for life and liberty. An
exciting and a disgraceful scene took place as the poor creature
dashed out into the main streets amid the trafﬁc. Drovers,
butchers and others chased the frightened animal. Motor cars
and tram cars were held up as it ran along various thoroughfares.
Finally, after three hours’ chase, wounded, bleeding and dazed,
this poor sensitive creature was roped down on a railway wagon
and killed.

Humane Exhibition and Bazaar

A large number of parents, teachers, children, Scouts and
Guides visited this interesting event in Manchester during
November. I

Mlle. Yvonne Arnaud was unfortunately prevented by special
engagements from being present. She sent a most encouraging
and cheery message, stating how very much she admired our
practical work.

Madame Elisabeth Kenyon, President of The Speech
Fellowship, presided. Her ﬁne opening remarks aroused much
enthusiasm. The Humane Education Society, she said, merited
the support of all progressive people, those who desired to make
life brighter and happier for creatures in need of friendship and
protection. The Society stood for good citizenship, character,
courage, justice and fair play in life and conduct. Madame
Kenyon paid a sincere tribute to the school children and teachers
concerning the ﬁne array of Drawings and Handicrafts bearing
on Humane Work.

Pioneers

Miss Jessey Wade, Editor of “The Little Animals’ Friend,”
one of the oldest workers in the Movement, spoke of the work
of various pioneers, and of the progress made amid many difﬁ—
culties during the years when Ernest Bell and others were active
in the Campaign.

Miss Constance E. Andrews, Minister of The Church of
The New Age, paid a tribute to the practical work being done
by The Society through its President, Ofﬁcers and Members,
and-especially the Secretarial and Lecture activities.

“Mickey”

Councillor George Grimshaw, in a delightful address, made
reference to the great services of “ Mickey,” the faithful little

 

 

 




 

 

 

 

 

17

dog who passed away a few months ago. “ Mickey ” had been
at each Humane Exhibition and Bazaar selling and collecting,
along with his mistress Miss Mathews. He is greatly missed.

ltjerry’)

Another little friend, who from time to time came to our
events, has also passed away very peacefully, after a happy life
with his friends, Mr., Mrs. and Miss Dorsett. Many other
animal friends have also gone; we remember their friendship
and service.

Stalls, Cafe and Whist Drive

The Stall-holders and helpers in the large hall, also our lady
waitresses and workers in the Café and at the Whist Drive, are
deserving of the highest praise for their splendid help and
generous gifts of articles, whist prizes, and service. Many
expressions of appreciation concerning their kindness and tact
have been received, and we must not forget those who did the
preliminary and ﬁnal work of erecting stalls and clearing away.
These happy events live on in our memory.

The Secretary was kept exceptionally busy during the after~
noon and evening, giving brief talks to groups of visitors, con—
cerning the Worn Horse Trafﬁc, Captive and Performing
Animals, Humane Methods of Food and Dress, Cruel Sports,
Cruel Experiments, Strays, and Methods of Teaching Young
People.

Humane Drawings— Furs—Handicrafts

“The Manchester Guardian,” in its report of the event,
stated that:

“The most interesting section of the Exhibition was the
collection of Drawings and Essays by school children,
among whom the Society does much work.”

It also made reference to the delightful articles of wear, made
out of Furreen, derived from yarns, rayon, wool, etc. This
Humane Fur is making rapid progress nowadays in public
favour—it provides employment in our own country and is free
from the injustice and cruelty too often associated with trapping
and fur farming.

Entertainment by School Children

By kind permission of the Head Teacher of a large Muni-
cipal School, a number of girls gave delightful and appropriate
songs, recitations, also children’s, dances, and a play poem.

Results

A lot of valuable educational work was accomplished, many
new members enrolled, and the ﬁnancial results were better than
previous years. Amount realised £168 55. 4d.

A. full list of names of all who helped in various ways is set
forth in the report, this includes those ﬁrms who kindly sent
supplies of their specialities for various stalls.

Humane Education in Hawaii

Archdeacon James Walker, a Manchester man, one of our
Vice-Presidents, continues his practical Christian work in the
Island of Hawaii, 10,000 miles away. His letters to The
Humane Education Society tell of good deeds accomplished for
the welfare of children and animals.

Press references are very encouraging, showing that the
Editor of “The Honolulu Star Bulletin” and other papers, are
keenly interested in the Humane Campaign. A recent leading
article is full of vigorous condemnation of Fashion Cruelties.

Hiawatha

Then the little Hiawatha
Learned of every bird its language,
Learned their names and all their secrets,
How they built their nests in summer,
Where they hid themselves in winter.
Talked with them whene’er he met them,
Called them “Hiawatha’s Chickens.”

Of all beasts he learned the language,
Learned their names and' all their secrets,
How the beavers built their lodges,
\Nhere the squirrels hid their acorns,
How the reindeer ran so swiftly,
Why the rabbit was so timid.
Talked with them whene’ere he met them,
Called them “Hiawatha’s Brothers.”

——LONGFELLow

Warfare and ﬂnimals

The Society has representatives on several Peace Councils
and Committees. Warfare, with all its misery and suffering to
men, women and children, brings its full measure of suffering to
animals, especially horses and mules, and those victims of
Poison Gas Experiments.

but of small things, in which it is the smiles, and
kindly little acts, given habitually, that win and hold
the heart, and bring peace and happiness to all.”

THE NEED FOR HUMANE
EDUCATION

Extracts from spea'alpamp/zlet éy ERNEST BELL

VIDENCE is accumulating that the need for more systematic
instruction in humaneness in our schools is becoming more and
more realised on all sides. ’

Children are naturally much in sympathy with animals and birds.
The beneﬁcent effect of the teaching of kindness and justice has, we
think, been amply shown by the work of various Societies, and by
evidence from teachers, welfare workers, police and others.

Our “ Chief Scout” with his wide experience of young minds, has
also given his testimony that “ the love for animals is easy to inculcate
at this impressionable age and becomes a lifelong attribute. Moreover,
it develops, as the adolescent grows up, the kindred Spirit of love for
others instead of the selﬁshness that is too prevalent a vice among us
to-day.”

If humane teaching out of school hours, organised and carried
on by private enterprise, has been shown by those who have tried
it to have such valuable results to the taught, besides saving untold
suffering to sensitive creatures committed to our charge—and so
often thoughtlessly ill-used—-—may we not reasonably ask that our
education authorities shall set apart a little time each week for the
inculcation of humane principles in the minds of young people ?

 

Teachers. Parents and all Progressive People are
Cordially Invited to become Members of
The Humane Education Society
Our Policy is Constructive, accentuating the positive side of
Humane Work.

We seek to develop Character and a Love of Beauty, Fair Play
and Good Citizenship.

Contributions, no matter how small, to enable us to carry forward
our practical educational work will be gratefully acknowledged.
