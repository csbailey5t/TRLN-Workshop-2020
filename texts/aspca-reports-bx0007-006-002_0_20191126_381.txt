Early in the session of the last Legislature a bill was intro-
duced to amend the laws relating to animals, so as to permit the
baiting of rabbits with dogs. The promoters of the measure,
assuming the questionable guise of “ sportsmen,” had advocated
the passage of the bill at the preceding session without success
The undersigned opposed these attempts to enact this pernicious
scheme by personal appeals, and by memorials addressed to each
member of the Senate and Assembly, and it is gratifying to
report that the bill was defeated.

Another iniquitous bill was also introduced to legalize the in-
ﬂiction of unjustinable physical pain on milch cows and other -
cattle, under the name of “ dishorning.” This abominable phase
of brute torture cannot be so described in a few words, as to give
even a vague idea of the torturing the helpless creatures undergo
during the operation, Which is nothing more or less than the saw-
ing off of the horns of full-grown cattle close to the head. The
advocates of the measure were stock-dealers, and they urged the
passage of the bill on the ground that hornless cattle took up less
space, and submitted in substance the audacious plea that by
destroying a member of the body which nature designed to
serve a purpose, other functions of the animal would be beneﬁted .
thereby. There is no doubt that a mercenary motive was the
only incentive. Like its predecessor, it failed to become a law.

It was deemed advisable to purchase the plant of the Society’s
ofﬁcial organ, Our Arzz'ma/ Friends, which heretofore had been
published by private individuals, and to edit, publish, and mail
it directly from Headquarters. This has been accomplished, and
now, clothed in a new form, the publication takes its place with
the recognized humane literature of the country.

- I have only to add that my thanks are due to numerous mem-

bers and friends of the Society for their words of encouragement

and kindly approval of new methods that have been introduced
for facilitating the more immediate and complete protection of
our dumb and defenceless animals.

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE
COMMITTEE.

The Executive Committee, in view of the fact that the reports
of the Treasurer and Superintendent of the Society give ample
details of the work done in their several ofﬁces during the past
year, will but brieﬂy allude to matters coming particularly within
their jurisdiction.

Several amendments to the By-laws were made ; among them,
ﬁxing the yearly dues at the uniform rate of Five dollars; also
admitting minors to membership.

Mr. Park Godwin resigned as a member of the Executive Com-
mittee, but will continue to serve the Society as one of its Vice—
Presidents.

To ﬁll the vacancy caused by the resignation of Mr. Godwin,
Mr. William Fahnestock was elected a member of the Executive
Committee.

A new Ambulance, specially designed by President Haines,
has been built for the transportation of disabled animals.

Eighthy-two new members joined the Society during the past
year.

During the year the Society has lost by death several devoted
friends of the cause, whose names will be found inscribed in the
obituary record.

GEO. G. DEWITT,
Secretary.

duty of reforming the abuses. It is safe to report that by reason
of the Vigorous crusade carried on during the past year against
the proprietors of so-called milk dairies, cattle sheds, and pig-
geries, many of them were compelled to give up the business,
while others have erected more commodious buildings, and have
adopted measures for the better care and comfort of the animals.

' S’I‘I'ABLES.

Much attention has been devoted to accommodations furnished ‘
.to horses housed in underground stables, and those situated in
the rear of alleyways ; and while much has been accomplished to
better the condition of the equine inmates, more remains to be
done in the same direction.

The absence of adequate means of escape in case of ﬁre has
in many instances resulted in the destruction of hundreds of
horses in a most horrible manner.

Several unusual cases of cruelty have been prosecuted during
the past year, notably, the killing of a horse with a cart rung, the
stabbing of another to death with a pitchfork, the poisoning of
several horses and dogs, pushing a sick mule over a precipice, and
others, the details of which if described would only tend to shock
the sensibilities of right—thinking people.

DOG-, COCK-FIGHTING, AND RAT-BAITING.

Owing to the constant vigilance of the Society and police
ofﬁcers, the dog-, cock-ﬁghting, and rat-baiting fraternity have
not had many opportunities to indulge in those brutal pastimes.
Thinking, however, to bafﬂe the efforts put forth to suppress such
unlawful sports, the promoters, with their followers, have hied
themselves to isolated barns and road-houses, in adjacent counties,
far away from ofﬁcial jurisdiction. To these places have they
been pursued, and on several occasions, while assembled around
the dog-pit, unconscious of danger, intently gazing at dumb
brutes ﬁercely tearing each other, the human brutes have been
panic-stricken at the sudden entrance of the ofﬁcers of the law.

 

 

 




 

 

 

12

The labor and time attending that department of the work have
been very great, necessitating the ofﬁcers keeping watch many
nights in succession, while exposed to the inclemency of the
weather, long journeys, and other hardships.

STOCK-YARDS AND SLAUGHTER—HOUSES.

Stock-yard duty is another special feature of labor which
has been attended to. Many a case of neglect to feed and water
live-stock on their arrival here would have occurred but for the
vigilance of our ofﬁcers detailed to attend the cattle sheds. Let
me cite an instance : A young calf was found lying on the ﬂoor
of a car almost dead from starvation. Its piteous bleating at-
tracted the attention of our ofﬁcer. i No one claimed the animal,
and all refused to care for it. The foreman of the yard was
found, and given ﬁve minutes to furnish food for the starving
animal. In less than that time the famished creature was pro-
vided with a warm mash of bran and milk, which it partook of
ravenously. But for the presence and prompt action of the ofﬁcer
the poor creature would no doubt have died from hunger. Many
other cases could be reported, but the one above will be sufﬁcient
to Show the necessity for constant vigilance.

Several cases of abuse of animals awaiting slaughter were
found It was thought that the cruelties which formerly pre-
vailed 1n slaughter- houses were things of the past, but the arrest
of a butcher for thrusting his ﬁngers into the eye of a bullock,
while preparing the animal for death, might lead to the belief that
such was not the case. The prompt arrest and punishment of
the offender made a deep impression on the minds of his fellow-
workmen, and it is safe to say that such an atrocity will not occur
again.

PATROL AND AMBULANCE SERVICE.

These departments of the work have proved to be of the most
invaluable assistance for ﬁrst aid ’to injured animals and their
careful transportation to veterinary hospitals. The ofﬁcers con—

 




 

13

nected with the patrol have attended to over ﬁve hundred cases
of injured and sick animals found in the streets of the city.

Another ambulance specially designed by President Haines has
been added to_the present equipment. The new vehicle is pro-
vided with rubber springs, so as to minimize jolting; a brake of
new pattern has also been added. The sides of the ambulance
are padded so as to prevent the patients being bruised. A
thick mattress, a padded head protector-for cases of blind
staggers—have also been provided. In fact, everything pertain-
ing to the vehicle is most complete for the care and comfort of
injured or sick horses and other large animals while being trans—
ported to veterinary hospitals.

The ambulance built last year for the transportation of small.
animals has been in almost constant use, and many cases of
animal suffering have been mitigated by its prompt arrival and

service.
POULTRY.

It is to be regretted that the original shippers of live poultry
cannot be reached. Thousands of such animals have been brought
to this city weekly, by rail and boat, packed like sardines in coops
and crates. On their arrival, however, extra coops, food, and
water were at once provided. But for the presence of our officers
the animals would have been loaded on trucks and taken to other
cities in the same condition as when they arrived. This is
another special feature of the work which requires constant

attention.
CANALS.

The horses and mules employed towing boats on the several
canals were found to be in much better condition than formerly.
The ofﬁcers detailed for canal duty had occasion, however, to
make several arrests of boatmen for driving decrepit animals,
and many teams were suspended from labor owing to their
being lame or otherwise disabled. The animals were placed
under the care of veterinary surgeons and their owners warned
not to use them again until in proper condition. This department
of the work requires constant attention during the towing season.

 




 

 

 

 

 

I4
INSTRUCTING DRIVERS.

In addition to their other duties, our ofﬁcers have, been instruct-
ing drivers how to properly harness their horses. I might say.
that ﬁfty per cent. of drivers do not know how to harness their
teams ; in fact, do not know the names of the different parts, and
more horses are ruined by incompetent drivers than almost any-

thing else. On one occasion a driver was told to loosen out the"

crupper strap, it being so tight as to chafe the skin nearrthe tail
of the horse, but instead of the crupper he started to unbuckle
the hames. He frankly admitted he. knew the name of but
two parts of the harness, Viz.: the saddle and bridle. Hun-
dreds of such cases could be mentioned, showing the incom-
petency of persons entrusted with the care of horses. What can
be more tormenting to a horse than a loose blinder? Yet Over
three hundred such cases have been remedied during the past
year. “ Don’t you see how your horse’s eye is being cut by the
flapping of the blinder?” a driver was asked. “ I did n’t think
that hurt him,” was the indifferent answer. He was given a les-
son on the subject of harnessing, which will no doubt be of
service to him in the future, and the broken blinder cut off.
Loose bridles, tight throat latches, traces too long or too short,
breeching straps improperly fastened, high checking, and many
other irregularities too numerous to mention are among the
evils that have been remedied.

INDIFFERENCE.’

It would be almost impossible to describe in detail the many
cases of indifference, wilful neglect, and abuse of animals that
have been remedied during the year, without resorting to prose-
cutions. Indifference to the sufferings of animals is not conﬁned
to any particular class of society. The aristocratic coachman,
mufﬂed to his ears in costly furs, will sit on the seat of his
vehicle and stolidly watch his clipped horses shivering from cold,
although blankets for their protection may be found tucked under
his feet. The “ night-hawk ” may be-found in the early hours of
the morning, half drunk, dozing by the ﬁre of some all-night bar-

 




 

15
room, while his equine bread—and-rum earner is patiently waiting
his coming out into the open, unblanketed and hungry. The gentle-
man of leisure sits behind his blooded trotter, gazing with utter
indifference on the torture the animal is undergoing through the
medium of the overhead check rein drawn to the last notch. The
equestrian seems to think it necessary to have all the modern
implements of horse torture, curb, spurs, and whip, employed at
the same time. Railroad and stage-coach corporations are
indifferent to the woes of their living motive power. The butcher
and grocer boy imagine it to be part of their mission on earth to
torment in divers ways the animals placed in their charge. And
so on through the whole category of commercial or worldly inter-
ests, where animals are employed, could the story be continued
of mankind’s indifference to the suffering of the brute creation.

LOCAL AGENTS.

Reports from special agents, resident in counties other than
New York and Kings, indicate that the work of animal protec-
tion is vigorously conducted in those localities. “ The fact that
I am here to prosecute cases of cruelty,” writes one of our agents,
“ is sufﬁcient in itself for those inclined to violate the humane
laws to take warning.” -

Under the able management of Inspector Clark, the Brooklyn
department of our work has been most efﬁciently carried on.
Considering the small force of ofﬁcers engaged there, the work
accomplished has been very great, showing that the onerous
duties pertaining thereto have been intelligently and faithfully
attended to. '

THE FOLLOWING ARE SOME or THE MORE IM- 1
PORTANT CASES PROSECUTED DURING I
THE PAST YEAR. 1‘:
1891. i
Jan. IO. Henry Unload is an engineer by occupation, and was employed as !
such to run the engine in a mineral and soda-water factory on the ‘
west side of the city. His employer owned a horse, which, owing no 1
doubt to improper handling, had become somewhat balky. Unload l1
declared that he was competent to cure the animal of its acquired 1
habit, and to that end, unbeknown to his employer, or any one con- 1
nected with the stable department, applied oil of vitrol to the animal’s-
body. The poor creature was burned in a fearful manner, and for
several days suffered great agony. Unload was arrested by an ofﬁcer
of the Society, and was tried and convicted in the Court of Special
Sessions, and ﬁned twenty-ﬁve dollars by Judges Kilbreth, Hogan,

and O’Reilly.

 

Jan. 12. John Gallagher was found driving a horse attached to a heavily
loaded wagon while suffering from several sores on the body, unpro-
tected from the harness. The offender was ﬁned twenty-ﬁve dollars
by Judge Walsh.

Jan. 19. Patrick Tully, for compelling a horse to drag a loaded wagon while
in a disabled condition, was ﬁned ﬁfteen dollars by Judge Goetting.

Jan. 27. Patrick Sheridan, the owner of a disabled horse, was prosecuted by
the Society for causing and permitting the animal to be dragged by a
rope attached to its jaw, thereby causing several of the teeth to be
pulled out, and otherwise lacerating its mouth. He was such an
ignorant-appearing person as to excite the sympathy of the Court, who
gave him the beneﬁt of the doubt as to having wilfully caused the
cruelty, and sentence was suspended.

Feb. 2. William Blackhan was arrested while driving ahorse attached to a
loaded coal cart, the animal suffering at the time from sores on the
back, three by. three inches, unprotected from the harness. The
offender was ﬁned ﬁve dollars by the Court of Special Sessions.

Feb. 5. Thomas Gordon, for carrying poultry in a cruel and inhuman man-
ner, namely, by their legs with the heads hanging downwards; also
throwing others from a wagon to the pavement in a violent manner.
Fined ﬁfteen dollars by Judge Goetting.

Joseph Potter, for beating a horse over the head with the butt end
of a whip, simply because “he felt like it." Fined ﬁve dollars by
the Court of Special Sessions.

Abraham L. Danzer was arrested for compelling a lame, sore, weak,
and feeble horse to draw a loaded wagon. The poor creature had
but one sound leg with which to bear the weight of its body. Fined
ﬁve dollars by the Court of Special Sessions.

While Joseph Brunner, Louis Heider, James McCabe, Frederick
Mel], and Frederick Liehl were intently gazing upon two dogs ﬁercely
tearing each other in an improvised dog-pit, erected in the upper part
of a stable, 651 West 52d Street,
they were surprised and captured
by the police of the twenty-second
precinct. The dogs, the pit, and
the prisoners were taken to the
twenty—second precinct station for
the night. One of the dogs was
badly cut up (see engraving), and

 

showed signs of having been ﬁghting for some time before the en—
trance of the police upon the scene. » ~

The prisoners were subsequently tried at the Court of Special Ses-
sions, and ﬁned ten dollars each on a charge of having instigated,
promoted, and witnessed a dog-ﬁght. The dogs and pit were for-

feited to the Society, pursuant to chapter 97, Laws of I875.

The Society’s local agent, resident at Utica, N. Y., Mr. William
Blaikie, assisted by a squad of police, made a descent on a gang of
cock—ﬁghters, who were assembled around a cock-pit, erected in a
room of a well known sporting house of that city. There were at
least 100 persons present, who, on the entrance of the police, broke
through windows and doors in their efforts
to escape. Forty-one, however, were cap-
tured and arraigned before Judge Beardsley,
of the Utica City Court, the next morning,
but owing to the failure on the part of the

 

ofﬁcers to identify all of the persons arrested,
only the following named were convicted :
John Shay, James Wagner, John Davy, Peter Simon, William
Brocket, J. Frank Miller, William Wagner, who were each ﬁned ten
dollars on the charge of witnessing a cock-ﬁght.-

STEEL GAFFS.

The occupant of the premises, Charles Guldback, was charged on a
separate complaint for having permitted the ﬁght to take place on his
premises, and ﬁned twenty-ﬁve dollars.

 




 

I9

Also John Cohen, one of the principals, who likewise claimed some
of the birds, was convicted and ﬁned twenty dollars.

March 2. Isaac DeGraff, in a ﬁt of anger, commenced to beat his horse (one
of a team) over the face and head with his whip. On being remon-
strated with for his cruelty his only excuse was that he “ thought the

9

horse was going to bite him.’ Fined ﬁve dollars in the Court of

Special Sessions.

March 3. Robert VVedell, for cruelly beating a cat with a whip, then throwing
the animal from the roof of a three-story building, was ﬁned ten dol-
lars by the Court of Special Sessions. VVedell offered as an excuse

V

for his cruelty, the “ cat annoyed him.’

March 10. Patrick Quinn was arrested for working a horse to a loaded ash-
cart. The animal was in a most deplorable condition, having ulcer-
ated sores on the neck, back, and breast, measuring three by three,
one by one, and two by two inches. He was ﬁned ﬁve dollars by the
Court of Special Sessions.

March IO. John VVample of Ellicott, N. Y., was arrested and charged with
having committed an atrocious act of cruelty upon a horse. It consisted
of fastening a chain to the under jaw of the animal, the other end
being attached to a log ; while in this condition the horse was made
to pull the block of wood with his mouth, which resulted in the loss of
several teeth, anda lacerated jaw. He was ﬁned twenty—ﬁve dollars
by Justice Yates, of Jamestown.

March 20. Frank Mahoney was arrested for carrying sheep in a cruel and in-
human manner on a truck. The poor creatures were ’so crowded as
to make it impossible 'for them to move. Several of the animals were
lying down on the bottom of the
vehicle, and were being trampled upon
by the others. Two were found with
their legs broken. The defendant was
ﬁned ten dollars by the Court of Special
Sessions.

March 20. Henry Bayler, of Flatbush, L. 1., was
convicted for having attached the end
of airope to a horse’s tongue and pulling
a portion of it off (see engraving). Fined
ﬁve dollars by Justice Bornkamp.

 

March 23. Andrew Weisbord, for kicking a w
horse six times in the breast, stabbing it three times in the body, and
actually biting it on the nose, was ﬁned ﬁve dollars in the Court of
Special Sessions.

 




 

 

 

20

March 27. Louis Hallock, of Brooklyn, was prosecuted for allowing a sick
horse tolie on the street for several hours without care or food. His
only plea was “ ignorance of the law.” Judge Kenna imposed a ﬁne
of ten dollars for cruelty to the horse.

April 6. Thomas Reynolds, Utica, N. Y., was arrested and charged with
having promoted and carried on cock-ﬁghting. On his plea of guilty,
he was ﬁned one hundred dollars, and imprisoned for thirty days, and
to be “ committed until the ﬁne was paid at the rate of one dollar for
each day, not to exceed one hundred days,” by Judges Jones and
Beach, of the Utica Court of Sessions.

April 8. Geo. Gee, of Brooklyn, was arrested while in the act of beating his
horse over the head and body with a whip. The latter weapon not
appearing to the mind of Gee as one of sufﬁcient severity, he put it
aside, and seizing a whiffletree, continued to belabor the animal. On
being arraigned before Justice Kenna, he gave as an excuse for his
cruelty that “ the horse was balky.” The magistrate imposed a ﬁne
of twenty-ﬁve dollars.

April 13. Michael Lane, for driving a horse to a wagon while suffering from
sores on the back and neck chafed by the harness. Fined ﬁve dollars
by the Court of Special Sessions.

April 15. Irwin Karl, for cruelly beating a horse with a trace chain. He
claimed the animal was balky, and for that reason struck it ﬁfteen
vicious blows. Fined ﬁve dollars by Court of Special Sessions.

April 22. C. H. Thorn was arrested for driving and beating a decrepit old
' horse, and ﬁned ﬁve dollars by Judge Higbie, of Jamaica, L. I.

April 30. Henry Ulstch, the owner of a weak and sore mule, was arrested for
causing and permitting the animal to be driven attached to a heavy
truck while in the condition described. The defendant was ﬁned ten
dollars by Judge Goetting.

April 30. John Killey, of Brooklyn, not having a whip handy, seized a piece
of iron and beat his horse on the body most cruelly. He was ﬁned
ﬁfteen dollars for the offence by Judge Walsh.

April 30. William Lavench, Peekskill, for omitting and neglecting to provide
necessary sustenance, food, water, and shelter, for his horse was ﬁned
ten dollars by Justice Baseties.

May 7. Morris Schaikavitch, for twisting, or, as it is termed, “locking,” the
wings of several ducks and geese, and then throwing the animals in a
violent manner to the stone pavement, was ﬁned ﬁve dollars by the
Court of Special Sessions.

James Lyons, Brooklyn, for compelling ahorse to drag a cart loaded
with sand while suffering from two large sores on the back, unpro-
tected from the harness, was ﬁned ten dollars by Judge Goetting.

Herman Beyer was employed as stableman and night watchman in
a large stable on the west side of the city, and was informed by his
employers that his services would be no
longer required after a certain date.
It was alleged he was a man of violent
temper, and when one of the horses
was found dead between two stalls,
with its skull crushed, suspicion pointed
to Beyer as the person who struck the
blow. The case was reported to Presi-
dent Haines, who at once commenced
an investigation. A hammer covered
with blood was found in a locker of
which Beyer only had the key, and all

 

other evidence, although of a circum-
stantial nature, conﬁrmed the suspicion that Beyer committed the

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT.

It is again my privilege to submit a report of the general work
accomplished during the past year, not only with regard to the
enforcement of the laws for the prevention of cruelty to animals,
but likewise a brief statement of What has been done to mitigate
the sufferings of numerous unfortunates of the animal creation.
Many cases of abuses investigated have been traced to ignorance
on the part of the offender, while others were attributable to
indifference or wilful neglect. To particularize each case would
require more space than can be accorded in this report.

It must not be taken as evidence either, that, by reason of a
larger number of prosecutions and other ofﬁcial interferences
herein presented, than on previous years, cruelty is on the
increase ;i it is owing solely to the untiring vigilance exercised
in following up and correcting the many phases of abuse that
have been discovered from time to time. Only those directly
associated with the general work of the Society know its char-
acter and magnitude.

The good that has been accomplished both from a sanitary and
humane point of View, tending to the improved condition of the
many cows and cattle conﬁned in barns and sheds in the several
adjacent counties, might, in itself, be taken as a satisfactory con-
clusion to a year’s labor.

These reforms, however, have not been accomplished without
persistent and incessant action. Spasmodic efforts to suppress
cruelties, to which the swill-fed milch cow and the hotel-refuse-
fed bullock have. been subjected to for many years, brought about
results for the time being only. The condition of many of the
pest holes referred to has been, to a certain extent, described
from time to time in the daily newspapers, but the real condition
of the places is only known to the owners and the Society’s ofﬁ-
cers, who have been detailed from time to time for the special

ADDRESS OF THE PRESIDENT.

Ladies and Gentlemen .-

Again the agreeable duty devolves upon me of presenting to
you my Annual Report, which brings to ,a successful conclusion
the twenty-sixth year of our existence as a Society.

Although the history of the past cannot be brieﬂy related, it
is a source of satisfaction to even cursorily reﬂect upon the fact
that our organization has always kept steadily in view the great
humane principles it was established to promote. It also affords
us pleasure, as we cast a retrospective glance over the ﬁelds of
our struggles and triumphs, to know that through us, the Parent
Society of America, all other humane institutions in this coun-
try drew the inspiration that gave them their existence.

There are many people who. while admitting it is a great
wrong to ill-treat a horse or dog, deny to other creatures of the
animal world the same consideration. Such sentiments I assume
are not shared by the members and friends of our Society, and
for that reason I have vigorously carried out the spirit and letter
of the statute which legally deﬁnes the word “animal ” to “ in-
clude every living creature except man.” Let me reiterate, there
is no animal too insigniﬁcant for the protection of this Society.

It is most gratifying to realize that the record of our Society’s
usefulness, as time grows apace, bears evidence of the wisdom
and benevolence of those who long ago called it into being.

That cruelty will ever cease while the world lasts, is beyond
human prediction, but it is certainly within the power of all right-
thinking people to at leastysupport in every possible manner all
efforts which are put forth to lessen the evil.

As in the past, so in the present, attempts have been made to
abridge the usefulness and authority of this Society by appeals
to the Legislature. I will not take time or space to criticise the
motives of those who have sought to restrict the power conferred
upon our Institution, but will proceed to submit for your consid-
eration some of the proceedings of the past year.

Dec. 23. Near midnight the ofﬁcer patrolling \Vest Sixty-second Street, near
the Boulevard, was informed that a rat-bait was in progress in the
rear of a stable on his post. Hastening to the
place, and looking through an opening in a wooden
partition, he saw twenty-two men around a pit, in
which a small dog and a number of rats were ﬁght—
ing. He sent a messenger to the Twenty-second
Precinct Police Station, and a squad of police ofﬁ—
cers were sent to his assistance. Bursting into the
apartment, the entire gang of rat-baiters, with the
pit, four dogs, and other paraphernalia, were taken
into custody and lodged in the station—house for
the night. On being arraigned before Justice
}rady in the Fourth District Police Court the next
morning, but nine of the offenders could be iden-
tiﬁed by the ofﬁcers. These were held for trial,
RAT'BAITER,S TONGS- and subsequently pled guilty in the Court of
Special Sessions, and were ﬁned twenty dollars each.
The maximum penalty upon conviction for such offences is a ﬁne of
one thousand dollars, or one year in the Penitentiary, or by both ﬁne

 

and imprisonment.
