Ms. Dorothy Nagel

Dear Ms. Nagel:

Thank you for your letter concerning the Marine Mammal Protection Act of
l972 as it pertains to the incidental taking of dolphins by tuna fisher—

men 0 M...

As you know, the goal of the Act is the reduction of the incidental marine
mammal death and serious injury rate to insignificant levels approaching
zero. This requirement would rule out the use of purse seine nets and

the "on porpoise" method of tuna fishing. The Act did, however, give the
industry two years to comply with these provisions.

After the Act's grace period expired in l974, the Department of Commerce
extended the moratorium on compliance by the industry by regulation. In

a recent court decision, however, U.S. District Court Judge Charles R. Richey
ordered that the moratorium be declared void as a violation of the l972 Act,
and gave the industry until May 3l to discontinue "on porpoise" fishing.

A subsequent U.S. Court of Appeals ruling stayed this decision for at least

a month.

Legislation is now moving through the House of Representatives which would
extend the moratorium through the end of the year. While similar legisla-
tion is not yet under consideration by the Senate Commerce Committee, let me
assure you that I will keep your views in mind if the Committee addresses

this issue. ~w' -~mw~m~wMemmmm
With best wishes.

Sincerely,

Subcommit ee on th Environment

Dear Ms. Nagel:

Thank you for letting me know of your support for H.R. 5808, the "Animal
Welfare Act Amendments of 1976".

As you know H.R. 5808, which was recently passed by the House of Represen-
tatives, has been given a new number, S. 1941, in order to correspond with a
similar Senate bill which was approved last December. Both bills amend the
Animal Welfare Act to provide the Secretary of Agriculture with the authority
to promulgate standards for the humane treatment of animals in transit.
Unlike the Senate bill, however, the House bill contains other provisions
designed to prevent the practice of animal fighting, particularly those
fights involving dogs and cocks. Thus, members of the Senate and House

will be meeting shortly in a conference committee to resolve this and other
differences between the two bills. When this has been done the legislation
will be sent to the White House for the President's signature.

Although I will not be a conferee, I will be sure to pass your views along
to Senators Magnuson, Ford and Heicker, who will be representing the Senate
in the conference, and will ask that they give them every conSideration.

Again, I appreciate your taking the time to contact me about this matter.
With best wishes.

Sincerely,

Chairman

Dear Ms. Nagel:

Thank you for your letter concerning the need to ban leg hold traps.
Measures which would have severely restricted or completely prohibited

the use of these devices were before the Senate Commerce Committee‘s
Subcommittee on the Environment during the last Congress. Unfortunately,
the Subcommittee was never able to give active consideration to the bills,
due to the press of other legislation. Hopefully, however, we will be able
to conduct hearings on similar legislation during the present Congress.
Your interest in this issue is sincerely appreciated.

Best wishes.

Dear Mr. Dewolfe:

Thank you for your letter expressing concern over the Army's black bird
control project at Ft. Campbell, Kentucky. As you know, the birds were
sprayed with the chemical tergitol, which robbed them of their protective
skin oils and caused them to succumb to exposure. One application of

the chemical was made, and at this time it is uncertain whether additional
applications will be carried out.

To my way of thinking, not all of the facts are in yet on this project, and
there are still many questions which must be answered before it is possible
to make an informed and impartial judgement about it. Some of the very basic
questions which I feel have not been addressed definitively are: How much of
a threat did the birds' presence pose to the health and economic well-being
of the area's residents; Was the application of tergitol the best means of

dispersing these so-called pests; Did the Army adequately examine other
means of dispersal; Did the Army go to every effort to seek out impartial
scientific advice on the environmental impact of the project, particularly
possible adverse effects posed by decaying carcasses? Will communities with
a similar problem become "tergitol happy" rather than attempting to develop
an alternative method of pest control? As you can see, this is not an easy
issue to come to grips with.

Because the Ft. Campbell projeCt may produce repercussions which go beyond
the Army base and its environs, I feel it behooves us to look into it very
carefully, Therefore, I have directed my staff to make a full investigation
of the project over the next few weeks and report their findings and
recommendations to me, including suggestions for possible future Subcommittee
action. Let me assure you that I share your concern and am determined to
know the full facts of this matter.

Best wishes.

Utica, Mich. 48087

Dear Mr. Deholfe:

Thank you very much for your recent letter supporting the Department
of Interior‘s proposed amendments to the Lacey Act. It is certainly
refreshing to receive favorable comments such as yours.

Most of the opposition to these proposed regulations seems to stem

from a misunderstanding of the Department's intentions. Many indi-
viduals fear that these regulations would severely restrict the
interstate transportation of animals, particularly pets. However, as
you know, the Department of Interior in proposing these regulations

is not attempting to control the interstate shipment of pets, but rather
to control the importation of injurious wildlife which may be harmful

to human beings or the environment.

The Department has released a draft version of the environmental

impact statement assessing the effects of these regulations. The public
has until September l4 to make their views on this report known to

the Department. After the close of the comment period, public hearings
will be held. Then after considering public comments and other pertinent
data, the Department will promulgate final regulations.

Again, let me express my appreciation for the time you have taken to
inform me of your views on this matter.

Sincerely yours,

Dear Mrs. Sokolowski:

Thank you for writing to me in support of regulations to provide
better treatment of laboratory test animals. The issue of the
humane treatment of these animals is certainly one that should
concern us all.

While the Animal Welfare Act of l970 required that certain minimum
standards be met to insure humane treatment of test animals, it did
not specifically provide standards for either the size of the
animal's cage or for any period of exercise. However, the Animal
and Plant Health Inspection Service of the Department of Agriculture
is now in the process of formulating regulations to require a
minimum cage size and a minimum exercise period. Officials within
the Inspection Service have assured me that these regulations will
be ready for publication in the Federal Register in the near future.

Since the Inspection Service began to study the possible alternatives
in formulating these regulations, this issue has been a subject of
much controversy. While many people would like to see better treat-
ment of test animals, there are others who feel that additional
standards are unnecessary for the health of the animals involved.

I certainly feel that it is our duty to require necessary standards
of comfort for the animals that provide such a vital service to us
in scientific research. I can assure you that I will review the
new regulations carefully when they are published and assist in

any way that I can to make them as effective as possible.

Thank you again for writing. Your concern is very much appreciated.

Dear Ms. Nagel:

Thank you for expressing your support of legislation to ensure more
humane treatment of wild animals. The issues of predator poisoning,
cruel trapping of fUrbearing animals, and the threatened extinction
of many species of wildlife, are indeed important environmental
concerns.

Bills dealing with these matters are currently before our Committee.
S. 819, the predator control bill which called for severe restriction
of the use of poisons, has been revised to include provisions from

S. 1637, which would cut back the use of steel-jaw traps. This bill
and the Endangered Species Conservation Act, on which we have been

holding hearings this week, will be discussed soon in executive ses—
sion, and we hope to report them out as soon as possible.

Your concern about our work is much appreciated, and I will remember
your views as we discuss the bills and when they come up for a vote.

session would have authorized predator research and financial aid to
the States for predator control and continued the ban on poisons now
required by Administration policy. Our hearings indicated that at
present there seems to be little information which would warrant re-
instating the use of poisons or engaging in the greatly increased
use of other predator control techniques.

Many have argued for an integrated predator management program which
takes into account livestock protection needs and control of excessive
predator populations (without the use of harmful poisons). This

seems to make sense. Legislation which we plan to consider this session
would help verify livestock losses and determine predator populations

so that an equitable national policy can be formed.

Thank you for your interest and concern for this issue. I can assure
you that your views will be considered as we work to find remedies
to this problem.

With best wishes,

Dear Ms. Wood:

   

Thank you for your support of the important environmental legislation
presently before the Subcommittee on the Environment.

 
 

We are presently working to report legislation which will both limit
the abuse of toxic chemicals and mechanical devices in predator control
activity and which strengthen existing law designed for the protection
of endangered species. This work is part of our continuing effort to

design strong and effective environmental protection legislation.

The Subcommittee welcomes and will fully consider your views as it works
on S. 3334, S. 3818 and similar legislation.

Sincerely yours,

Dear Miss Griffin:

You will be pleased to know that on July 26 the Senate completed
action on its Ocean Mammal Bill, S. 2871. A summary of the
provisions of the bill is enclosed.

In the Schommittee and full Committee, and again on the Senate
floor, I offered an amendment to give the Secretary of the
Interior authority over all mammals covered by the bill, instead
of splitting the jurisdiction between Interior and the Commerce
Department's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. I
felt that this change would result in stronger emphasis on wild—
life protection and conservation. Unfortunately, my amendment did
nmcmmy.

The Senate bill represents a sincere effort to reconcile the con—
flicting points of view. The need for legislation in this area is
unquestionable. On that, there is virtual unanimity, and I hOpe we
have produced a generally satisfactory measure.

With best wishes,

Sincerely,

PROCEEDINGS A-ND DEBATES OF THE 92d CONGRESS, SECOND SESSION

No. 116

 

Senate

Mr. HART. Mr. President, length is
not a necessary element in the discussion
of this amendment. It is in truth a very
simple proposition. The amendment
would give to, the Secretary of the In-
terior the authority over all species of
marine mammals as described in the bill
we are considering. As the bill comes
to us from the committee, the jurisdic-
tion is split between the Secretaries of
Commerce and Interior.

Those of us who have joined in of-
fering the pending amendment believe
that the approach by the committee is
wrong. I am joined in the offering of the
amendment by Senators BAY-H, CASE,
CHURCH, CRANSTON, GRIFFIN, HUGHES,
NELSON, SPONG, STEVENSON, JAVITS, HAR-
R13, and WILLIAMS. _

What is the reason that we seek to
persuade the senate to put all of this
authority in the Interior Department? It
is because the Interior Department tradi-
tionally has been a wildlife-oriented de-
partment; ,

Commerce, naturally enough, has fa-
vored the development and enhancement
of commerce.

What do we set in the pending bill to
be our speciﬁc, primary purpose? ’

The bill states: -

It is the sense of the Congress that . . .
[marine mammals] should be protected and
encouraged to develop to the greatest extent
feasible . . . [consistent] with sound poli-
cies of resource management and that the
primary objective of their management
should be to achieve an optimum sustain-
able population keeping in mind the opti-
mum carrying capacity of the habitat and
the health and stability of the marine ecosys-
tern.

If that is not Interior, I should be sur-
prised. ~

Commercial use of these animals is
clearly not the primary goal of. this leg-
islation. If the populations can tolerate
a harvest, ﬁne, but that decision should
be made by an agency which is wildlife
oriented rather than one whose mission
is to promote commerce. -

The conﬂict is. especially clear in the
case of the porpoises taken in the course
of tuna-ﬁshing operations. It is gener-

' ally acknowledged that the most efﬁcient

ﬁshing methods are those which take
porpoises with the desired catch. Will
NOAA, which houses the old Bureau of
Commercial Fisheries and is in turn

housed by the Department of Commerce,
feel responsible chieﬂy to the ﬁshing in-
dustry or to the porpoises? While it may
be that NOAA would perform its function
without interference from the commer-
cial interests within the department, why
preserve the possibility of such interfer-
ence?

It has been argued that placing all
ocean mammals under Interior would
result in a great duplication of effort.
Since NOAA would retain its ﬂeet to
monitor ﬁshery Depulations and carry
out other duties, the. prospect of dupli-
cate ﬂeets and personnel has been noted.
Yet there would appear to be no obstacle
to Interior’s entering into agreements
with NOAA for the use of its personnel,
facilities and expertise. In light of this,
I feel conﬁdent that Interior, with the
addition of a few marine mammal scien-
tists and the cooperation of NCAA, would
be able to administer the act effectively.

Mr. President, that is the argument.
What is the primary purpose of the bill?
It is clearly to achieve an optimum sus-
tainable population keeping in mind the
optimum carrying capacity of the habitat
and the health and stability of the ma-
rine ecosystem.

Is not this as clear an example of the
purpose for which Interior was created
and is this not clearly a function that
should be assigned to Interior? That is
the purpose of the amendment.

SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS OF THE OCEAN MAMMAL BILL (S. 2871)

As passed by the
Senate, July 26, 1972

(1) establishes federal control over the marine mammal, such
control to be exercised by the Administrator of the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the case of whales,
dolphins and seals, and by the Secretary of the Interior in the
case of all other ocean mammals;

(2) establishes a Marine Mammal Commission to oversee the ac-
tivities of the two agencies;

(3) establishes a perpetual moratorium.on the taking of marine
mammals by U.S. citizens and on the importation of marine mammals
or marine mammal products, but grants the Secretary and the Admini-
strator leeway to waive the moratorium in certain cases in the
interest of the animals;

(h) ' provides that American tuna fishermen who participate in the
porpoise-related fishery would be granted a maximum.2h-month waiver
of the permit procedure so as to work with scientific researchers

on ways to protect the porpoise;

(5) grants Alaskan aboriginals virtual exemption from the bill,
but only so long as their taking of marine mammals is done in the
creation of arts, crafts, clothing or for subsistence, and is not
wasteful or does not lead to expanded commercial utilization of

marine mammal products.

Dear Senator Hart,

This is to wish you success in obtaining enactment
of your amendment to place jurisdiction for the Marine
Mammal Protection Act in the Department of the Interior.
We believe this to be the most important of all the
strengthening amendments to be offerred, with the firm
fiveeyear‘moratorium and the dolphin amendment following
immediately after, vitally important, too. The attached
letter and excerpts from.the hearings, being delivered
to Senators today, may be of interest to you.

we are deeply grateful to you for the great efforts
you made and continue to make to see that the jurisdiction
goes to an agency which has a genuine interest in marine
mammals for themselves. ,

Best of luck!

Sincerely,

Dear Senator

When strengthening amendments to the Marine Mammal Pro»
tection Act, 8. 2871, are offerred on the Senate floor we hope
you will support them.

Senator Hart with Senator Case, Senator Cranston, Senator
Griffin and Senator Spong introduced an amendment Re. 1302 to
put full jurisdiction for administration of the Act in the
Department of the Interior, rather than dividing the jurisdic~
tion between Interior and the Commerce Department's National
Oceanic and Atmospheric.Administration.

a series of amendments were introduced by Senator Harris
and Senator Williams, authors of two of the stronger bills on
the subject. They are joined by Senator Case, Senator Cranston,
Senator Percy, Senator Stafford, Senator Stevenson and Senator
Taft. '

These amendments Numbers 1274, 1276, 1277 and 1278 would
accomplish the following: 1) Eliminate the possibility of
waiving the moratorium ﬂor the first five yeans. Provide Con—
gressional veto power for any waiver of the moratorium for the
subsequent ﬁen years. 2) Require that incidental killing of
marine mammals in commercial fishing be reduced to "insignifi~
cant levels approaching a zero mortality and serious injury
rate" within two years of enactment. Ban importation of commer—
cial fish caught by any means which results in marine mammal
mortality in excess of U.S. Standards. 3) 'Increase penalties
to include seizure of both cargo and vessel for violation of
the.Act; provide up to $2,500 reward (half the fine) for informa«
tion and services concerning a violation of the Act. A) Stop
the United States portion of the taking of Pribilof seals during
the moratorium.

Attached are quotations from the 837 page hearings entitled,
"Ocean Mammal Protection" held by the Subcommittee on Oceans
and Atmosphere of the Committee on Commerce, February 15, 16,
23 and March 7, 1972. These quotations relate to the need for
the amendments noted above.

The Society for Animal Protective Legislation will be glad
to be of assistance in providing any additional information or
documentation concerning the vital importance of the Hart, Harris
and Williams amendments.

 




The concern yuu have expressed in letters to your con~
stituents on the plight of the ocean mammals is greatly appre~
ciated.

Sincerely,

Christine Stevens
Secretary

 




The following material in quotes is from
Hearings on Ocean mammal Protection before
the Subcommittee on Oceans and Atmos here,
Committee on Commerce. S. 685,11313; 2375, EEBS, 2371, 3112, 3161
and Amendment lone. Ocean Mammal Legislation, Serial ﬁg; 92~§6. Park‘l.

The Hart.Amendment would eliminate the divided jurisdiction of
the Committee bill, placing administration squarely in the hands of
the Secretary of the Interior. There are several compelling reasons
for this.

The Commerce Department both in written comments and oral testi~
mony stated that there is no need for a Marine Mammal Protection Act.
It claims that S. 3199, the "Endangered Species Act of 1972" is all
that is needed. On page 155 of the Hearings, Karl E Baker, General
Counsel of the Department of Commerce wrote, February 28,1972, "It
is our firm belief that this Administration proposal, if enacted in
its present form, would obviate the need for legislation aimed only
at the protection of marine mammals.“ '

On page M33, Howard w. Pollock, Deputy Administrator, National
Oceanic and.Atmospheric Administration, Department of Commerce, makes
this identical statement in his oral testimony. Under questioning,
he admits (Page uh2), "We certainly are in a department which is
industry oriented, and we make no apologies about that " Mr. Pollock
also volunteered when the questions turned to the polar bear (a spew
cies whose decline led the Russians to prohibit its killing from 1957
onwards) "I happen to be a hunter and I have hunted the polar bear in
years past I haven't done it in the past few years so I can't talk
about what the situation is in the last few years. But at the parti»
cular time when I was out hunting each year they were getting larger
and larger."

Such testimony can leave no doubt that NCAA and its parent Depart~
ment of Commerce see no purpose in the protection of any animal that
is not about to become extinct. The Deputy Administrator actually
regards the severely depleted polar bear as somehow becoming ”larger
and larger" though statistics show the opposite. In short, NCAA and
the Commerce Department believe a bill to protect marine mammals 53"
5e unnecessar . Nevertheless, the Senate Commerce Sommitt tee Eas‘"iyen
most of the jurisdiction and most 0W mono mthemi Tﬁe'hillb must
be amended to prevent this clear moonfligt Bot%‘aft Basic belief and of
interest.

The Department of the Interior understands the need for protection
of marine mammals. 0n Pages 197-202 Deputy Assistant Secretary of the
Interior for Fish a Wildlife a Parks, Curtis Bohlen, said:

"At a meeting held last week in Merges, Switzerland, scientists
from.five countries drafted a protocol which.would ban the hunting of
polar bears on the high.seas except for traditional taking of bear for
subsistence by local people. . . . The Department needs additional
authority and means to protect marine mammals and to enter into coopera-
tive agreements with the States covering management and research."

 




Much.more could be quoted from the testimony of the Department
of the Interior and the Department of Commerce ~ all of it shows the
sincere interest in the protection of the marine mammals by Interior,

‘<nontrasted starkly with the NCAA denial of need for protection of any
except those threatened with extinction.

It has been argued that aces has the "expertise" necessary to
administer the Marine.Mwwmal Protection Act, and this is urged as a
reason for giving it moat of the jurisdiction, leaving only about a
third of the jurisdiction to the Department of the Interior. Actually
on the crucial matter of porpoises and dolphins caught in tuna fisher-
men's purse seines, the Department of Commerce's NCAA had to contract
with the U. 8. Navy to come up with information demanded in connection
with the House hearings on the pending Marine Mammal Protection Act.

On Page h09, NOAA's only genuine expert in the field,‘William.Perrin,
Fishery Biologist, National Marine Fisheries Services, NCAA, Department
of Commerce, stated under questioning, "Yes, we cooperate very closely
with the Navy or they cooperated with us rather, in this last big re9
search cruise we had. We contracted two of their people to actually
run it for us. We used their equipment, their technicians and their
advice.r Clearly, Interior can contract with the Navy just as easily
as Commerce can, and their conclusions are less likely to carry a com-
mercial bias.

IF THE.CONGRESS SINCERELY DESIRES TO PROTECT MARINE MAMMALS, IT
MUST PLACE FULL JURISDICTION FOR THEIR MANAGEMENT IN THE DEPARTMENT OF
TEE INTERIOR. SENATOR HART' 8 AMENDMENT MUST BE PASSED.

What kind g£_creatures are E§_proposing4§g legislate about?

Specifically, the cetaceans (porpoises, dolphins and whales) have
larger, more complicated brains than men. The figure on Page 616 shows
the brain of the beluga whahe, Delphinapteras leucas, on the right and
man on the left. Most of what you see is the highly folded cerebral
cortex. The surface area of the cortex of the beluga whale and, in
fact, of all Cetacea is more highly convoluted than in man. . . . In
the ascendancy of land mammals and leading to primates and culminating
in man an increasingly greater percentage of the total cerebral cortex
is neocortex. To illustrate this neocortical increase in a few land
mammals, 69% of the total cortex of the kangaroo is neocortex, while

eThe almost total lack of knowledge about porpoises and dolphins is
clearly stated by the same witness (Page not) with respect to the
five minor species in terms of involvement in the fishery. . . . The
species with the exception of the bottlenose porpoise are all very
poorly known. The last three were not previously known to occur in
the eastern tropical Pacific. Fraser's porpoise had not previously
been seen in the flesh; its external appearance was unknown until it
was in the fishery. Subsequently, it has turned up in other parts
of the world. We don't know how many porpoises there are of any of
these species in the eastern Pacific."

 

 




93% is neocortex in the macaque monkey and.man's cortex is 96% neocortex.
In one of the dolphin species, Delphinas dolphis, 98% of its cortex is
neocortex an even greater proportion than is found in man}. . . The
cerebral cortex oftman contains approximately 1h billion neurons, the
majority of nerve cells in his brain. The number of nerve cells in

the cetacean cortex is even greater." '

inexcusable drowning‘gg dolphins and porpoises by tunafish purse~seiners

Numbers: Page 3&5, Marine Mammal Newsletter (Publication of Marine
Mammal Program,‘U.S. International Biological Program, February, 1972)
"In the U;S. Pacific tuna fishers alone, it is estimated that from
loozooo‘ggyeootooo porpoises (mostly Stenella) have been accidentally
drowned each year when trapped in tuna nets; Porpoises, which often
travel with tuna schools are used by the fishery to locate schools and
then are captured with the fish when a set is made with a purse seine

mat c SI

On Page 833 a table Shows numbers of porpoises trapped in indie
vidual "sets.” They range from h,hlh to h3,026. The lowest number of
porpoises killed per set is over so, the highest over 700.

Page h80. "Until about 1959 the bait boat was a dominant element
in the fleet. There was no porpoise mortality incurred. They just
approached the school of porpoises, chumed it with live bait and fished
it until the tuna went back to the porpoise school and the bait boat

would repeat the sequence."

There is no doubt that porpoise mortality can be eliminated if there
is the will to do so. the Harris-Williams Amendment would require the
tuna industry to use fishing methods which reduce in ury and death to
dolphins and porpoises to a point "approaching zero.’ It should be
passed.

Meratorium

The Committee bill's 15~year moratorium contains a loophole which
must be closed: that is, the authority given to the Administrator of
NCAA, Department of Commerce, to lift the moratorium for any species
under his jurisdiction and for the Secretary of the Interior to do the
same with regard to those species in his jurisdiction. The Harris-
Williams Amendment would remove this authority for the first five years
(except where it affects treaty obligations, native rights and special
scientific investigations). Five years without commercial pressures
for the killing of animals is urgently needed. Following are quotations
from‘soientista and from national organizations that agree on the need
for such a moratorium,

Page 367, Dr. Roger Payne, Rockefeller University, New York Zoologi~
cal Society, the scientist who recorded the now famous-Son 9‘33 the
Humpback Whale: "I heartily endorse the lOuyear moratorium propo§§d

y some of the bills under consideration here (inasmuch as it applies

 




to whales - I can only speak for whales) on two grounds. First, it
will give time to accumulate the sort of badly needed data ~ particu—
larly for some of the least known, or unknown stocks and Species.

"Second, because it would seem to give a clear example to foreign
governments and foreign peoples to dry up their own whale products
markets."

Page 375, Dr Daniel Hartman, leading student of the endangered
manatee: "A 10 year moratorium on the killing of various species of
marine mammals is regarded by some as protectionist and by others
as a management tool. I think it's unfair to assume that we will turn'
our backs on the protected populations during a moratoriwm, as Dr.
Norris has implied. The purpose of the suggested moratorium.or mori-
toria is not only to protect End to provide biologists with an opporw
tunity to study.

"Nor do I think we necessarily remove ourselves from international
debate by legislating moratoria. we may even stimulate increased debate
by setting a new moral tone. Where management is concerned I think
the emphasis should be controlling man and his byproducts, not on con«
trolling populations of marine mammals.

“With regard to most marine mammals I feel that we are boobed into
antiquated, anthropocentric concepts such as sustained yield and har~
vestable surplus which I fail to see as applicable to pelagic creatures
for whose products we no longer have any need and Whose populations do
not lend themselves to or require management.“

Dr. Hartman, in the course of his testimony, described the fate
of Steller' a sea cow: ”Discovered in 17ul, off two islands in the
Bering See, this toothless 3~5 ton leviathan was thoughtlessly killed
for meet by fur sealers. The last one was her oonsd and clubbed to
death.a.mere.ngyearsm after the discovery of tge species. " 1m phasis
sup pl'iedi '

Pages 536 and SAC, Progessor George Small, author of "The Blue
Whale," winner of the 1972 National Book Award for science: "Nearly
all scientists concerned with the problem would probably agree that
a moratorium on all species of whales would be extremely beneficial.
In the case of certain species a moratorium is imperative if they are
to survive at all.

". . .ﬂhen you consider the advantages of a moratorium, I think
they far outweight the disadvantages. What happens, for example, if
you declare a moratoriumwwlet me just state for a moment what has
happened in many commissions. ‘You have a situation where you have sci~
entific advisers and some modicum.of management. They say, 'Well,
let' s not out down, let a keep studying,‘ and the stocks go down and
down and down. This happened in the International Whaling Commission
repeatedly, I repeat, repeatedly, and they did not stop until they
couldn't find another whale.

"I am very much concerned with.the'whales of the high seas because
the population of the world is rising and we have within the last 10
years rendered two valuable species virtually extinct. We have two more
on the way down. We can't make people see daylight on this. There is
only one way to stop and that is to stop."

 




’//’ ‘ Page 620, National Audubon Society, Charles H. Callison, Execu-
tive ViceuPresident: "I believe a ten~year moratorium is unnecessarily
long. Five years would be reasonable. ac the end of five years, if
Congress is not too stingy in funding the needed research, the Secre~
tary of the Interior should have at hand some hard facts upon which to
decide where, how, and if, commercial harvests should be permitted. I
say this with a question.in the hack of my mind. The question is, '
would not humanity and the marine ecosystem.be better off if no commer»
cialization of these essential and appealing animals were ever permitted/"

Page 259, Friends of the Earth, Tom Garrett: "Senator Williams has
a lguyear moratorium.on killing in his bill, which would help insure
conditions for meaningful studies.

"a particularly cogent argument for at least a lO~year moratorium
resides in the poisoning and ecological disruptions noted. The PEPPO*
ductive interference showing up in California sea lions and possibly
in Stellar sea lions and Pribilof seals may yet oarallel the situation
which has developed in brown pelicans and certain other avians, and
now seriously threatens their survival.

"We must permit all of these mammals to retain maximum genetic
variability to meet such threats, while monitoring the populations care~
fully to detect increasing pollutant concentrations.

" We strongly support a ban on imports of all marine mammal products.
It would he astonishingly hypocritical to restrict U.S. citizens from
killing marine mammals, while permitting U.S. commercial interests to
subsidize such activities on the part of foreign nationals. Burgeoning
U.S. markets have helped bring about the depletion, and even extinction,
of many Species over the past two centuries."

Page 26h, Sierra Club, Robert Hughes, Wildlife a Endangered Species
Committee: "We feel the knowledge of marine mammals is so slight and
everybody, I believe, has agreed to that, that we should at this point
declare a moratorium until such time as we know enough about the various
populations and species to make sound judgments on whether or not taking
should be resumed.

”We believe that to take the opposite approach of allowing the tak~
ing of marine mammals to continue until the proof indicates that it should
stop may lead to taking of action too late.

"We would further want to see a ban on import of marine mammals
products."

 

Page 50h, Humane Society of the United States, John Hoyt, President:
"we believe that any marine mammal bill which would be effective and
guarantee protection must contain at least the following five provisions.
. . . 2) A1minimnm of a ten year moratorium.on the taking of marine
mammals. 3) A ten~yeer ban on the importation of all ocean mammal pro-
ducts into the United States."

Page 619, National Parks a Conservation Association, John Grandy,
Administrative Assistant: ". . . the National Parks and Conservation
Association, without directing its comments to any specific ocean
mammglilbill, heartily supports the following minimum provisions in
any :

 




“ "(1) A tenayear moratorium.on the killing of all ocean mammals

‘ excluding those presently covered by the Pribilof Fur Seal Treaty,
and excepting the traditional rights of natives. This provision
should hopefully allow depleted stocks to replenish their numbers.

"(2) A ban of similar duration on imports of all ocean mammals
products to reduce economics which foster the killing of ocean mammals."

Page 673, Defenders of Wildlife, Mary Hazell Harris, Executive
Director and Editor: "We realize that there are several bills under
coneideraticn by you. However, we feel strongly that the final bill
reported out of your committee should, at a bare minimum, do the

following:

"(1) Place a moratorium.of at least ten years, and hopefully
longer, on the killing, capturing, or otherwise 'taking' of all species
of marine mammals, with exceptions for Our treaty obligations under
the Nerth Pacific Fur Seal Convention and nonewaeteful native hunting

of nonuendangered species."

As you may know, the Oceans and Atmosphere Subcommittee of
The Senate Commerce Committee held hearings on a number of ocean
mammal bills. After very thorough consideration, the full Com-
mittee on June 7 ordered reported 8. 2871, Senator Williams' bill,
with amendments. A summary of its provisions is enclosed.

In the Subcommittee and again in the full Committee, I offered
an amendment to give the Secretary of the Interior authority over
all mammals covered by the bill, instead of splitting the juris-
diction between Interior and NCAA. I felt that this change would
result in stronger emphasis on wildlife protection and conservation.
Although my amendment did not carry in Committee, I will try again
on the Senate floor (Amendment #1302 to S. 2871).

As reported, the bill represents a sincere effort to reconcile
the conflicting points of view. The need for legislation in this
area is unquestionable. On that, there is virtual unanimity, and
I hope we have produced a generally satisfactory measure.

With best wishes,

Sincerely,

fr

SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS OF THE OCEAN MAMMAL BILL (S. 2871)

As reported by the
Senate Commerce Committee

(1) establishes federal control over the marine mammals, such
control to be exercised by the Secretary of the Interior in the
case of land-based mammals and by the Administrator of the Na-
tional Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the case of
oceanpbased mammals;

(2) establishes a Marine Mammal Commission to oversee the ac-
tivities of the two agencies;

(3) establishes a 15-year moratorium on the taking of marine
mammals by U.S. citizens and on the importation of marine mammals
or marine mammal products, but grants the Secretary and the Ad-
ministrator leeway to waive the moratorium in certain cases in the
interest of the animals;

(h) provides that American tuna fishermen who participate in the
porpoise-related fishery would be granted a maximum 28-month waiver
of the permit procedure so as to work with scientific researchers

on ways to protect the porpoise;

(5) grants Alaskan aboriginals virtual exemption from the bill,
but only so long as their taking of marine mammals is done in the
creation of arts, crafts, clothing or for subsistence, and is not
wasteful or does not lead to expanded commercial utilization of

marine mammal products.

No. 100

 

OPPOSITION TO OCEAN MAMMAL
'- PROTECTION ACT

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, in a
speech delivered to this body on June 4,
1971, I expressed strong opposition to
S. 1315, the Oceaﬁ‘“‘Mamma1 Protection
Act, and similar legislation now pending
in the House. In this speech, I contended
that the enactment Of S. 1315 would be
extremely unwise from both an ecological
and an economic point of view.

» In my remarks, I also mentioned that
my staff had contacted Mr. Tom Kimball,
director Of the National Wildlife Fed-
eration, and Mr. Dan Poole, president of
the Wildlife Management Institute, both
Of whom oppose S. 1315 in that it pro~
hibits prudent management on the
Pribilofs and requires the termination of
the North Paciﬁc Fur Seal Convention.

This view is also held by the leaders of
many other prestigious and knowledge-
able conservation groups. In separate
letters to President Nixon and to all
Members of the'House and Senate, these
leaders stated that programs for the
protection and scientiﬁc management of
marine mammals are being threatened
by well publicized, but misguided efforts
which, if successful, would destroy the
Operation of biologically sound activities
conducted by the State and Federal con-
servation agencies. The letters made clear
that the “hands Off” policy proposed in
S. 1315 and similar House bills would
severely jeopardize the efforts of respon-
sible ﬁsh and wildlife agencies to manage
their marine mammals programs In a
scientiﬁc manner. Thus, the ability of
these mammals to survive. and prosper
would be adversely affected.

The conservationists signing the letter
to the President were Mr. William E.
Towell, executive vice president of the
American Forestry Association; Spencer
M. Smith, secretary of the Citizens Com-
mittee on Natural Resources; Chester F.
Phelps, president of the International
Association of Game, Fish, and Conser-
vation Commissioners; Joseph W. Pen-

Society; ‘Ray A. Kotrla, Washington
representative of Trout Unlimited; Dan-
iel A. Poole, president of the Wildlife
Management Institute; and Ira N. Ga-
brielson, president Of World Wildlife
Fund.

The letter to House and Senate Mem—
bers, which was accompanied by a com-
prehensive fact sheet, was signed by
Harold J. Coolidge, honorary chairman
of the American Committee for Inter-
national Wild Life Protection; Robert F.
Hutton, secretary of American Fisheries

In order that the contents of these .

letters can be shared with the Members
of this body and all those who read the
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, I ask unanimous
consent that they be printed in the
RECORD. ’

There being no objection, the letters
were ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
as follows:

s 10259 —- s 10262

JUNE 18, 1971.
To all Members of the House and Senate:

An organized press and television campaign
is underway to solicit support for banning ‘
the taking of certain marine mammals. .
House and Senate bills to accomplish this ;
are HR. 6554, S. 1315, and others.

The undersigned national conservation or-
ganizations believe such a step would inter-
fere with the needed scientiﬁc management
of these interesting and valuable animals.
Some of these highly migratory animals can
be man-aged only through international .
agreements. Others come under the various
jurisdictions Of federal and state government.

Total protection, as is being urged, would
halt a number of management programs,
some of which have been remarkably suc-
cessful. The application Of science, not emo-
tion, has brought back the fur seal and the
sea otter from the shadows Of extinction to.
their thriving and productive population

levels Of today’.

Total protection also would make it im-
possible tO manage any population Of marine
mammals even though, under future circum-
stances, a culling may be desirable in the in-
terest Of man or to reduce local overpopula-
tions. that usually are detrimental to the
species itself. In some cases, protection also
would eliminate urgently needed sources Of
income to Eskimos, Aleuts, and Indians and
revenue for state and federal treasuries, as
wel .

We believe that adoption Of such a nega-
tive policy would be a serious mistake. We
believe the government should strengthen
its management authorities, including pro-
viding more funds and manpower, and Should
explore new and more effective international
agreements. We believe that there is no sub-
stitute for scientiﬁc fact when it comes to
assuring the perpetuation Of any species.

The accompanying fact sheets provide more
detailed information on the Status and man-
agement Opportunities for marine mammals.

THE HARVEST on THE PRIBILOF FUR SEALS

.The northern fur seal is a creature of the
high seas, the open water. It comes ashore
only to breed and bear its young.

Each year the fur seals leave the mist-
shrouded rookery islands of the North Pa-
cific to migrate as far south as California, as
far west as Japan. And each year their mys-
terious homing instinct draWS them back
across the ocean to the same rocky nursery
isles.

The adult male, or bull, may weigh 500
pounds or more and the female about 100
pounds. Harems are composed of one bull
and as many as 100 females, although the
average harem has about 40 females. The
pups are born in the early summer and
weigh about 10 pounds at birth. By the time
they depart for the sea in the late fall,
the pups may weigh 30 pounds or more.

The seal is a commercially valuable ani-
mal. Its furs are.prized for coats; the meat
is consumed both by humans and by ani-
mals. The annual fur- seal harvest on the
Pribilof Islands is virtually the sole source
of gainful work for the 600 Aleuts who live
in its two communities.

The seal herd of the Pribilofs today is
thriving, its number estimated at 1%; million
animals. Its return from a dangerously low
level of 200,000. in 1911 is a historic story
in the annals of man’s effort to conserve
wildlife.

That story began when the indiscriminate

. slaughter of northern fur seals on the high
seas was ended.

In the 18th century, the seals’ rich fur
made them targets of intensive hunting in
the Northern Hemisphere.

'I'he_Russians discovered the Pribilof Is-

“ lands in 1786. In the ensuing years Russian
hunters reportedly took 2.5 million seal pelts.

”Initially, harvesting was uncontrolled, breed-
: ling females were unprotected in the Pribi-

lof herds were reduced to remnants. In 1834:,

‘ when the seals had been almost annihilated,

the Russians stopped killing females and
the herd began to increase. By 1867, when

I the US. purchased Alaska, (including the
, Pribilofs) the Pribilof herd had recovered to
f the point that it sustained an annual har-
, vest of 100,000 males for many years.

i
|

The United States began its jurisdiction
by permitting a number of independent
companies to operate, In the ﬁrst season
300,000 skins were taken. To protect the fur
seals, Congres in 1869 set aside the Pribilofs
as a special reservation. During the next 20
years, sealing on the Pribilofs‘was conducted
under a leasing arrangement, with some 2

million sealskins taken. A second 20-year,

lease produced only 343,000 skins, and in
1910 the Federal Government assumed di-
rect management of the. approximately 200,-
000 fur seals that survived.

During this 40-year period, killing at sea
had continued. American, Canadian, and
Japanese sealers had shot and speared fur
seals from ships. They could not tell the sex

or age of the animals, many of which were‘

lost through wounding or sinking. When a

, nursing mother was killed it often meant

slow starvation for her pup. '

From 1879 to 1909, almost one million fur
seals were taken at sea. No one knows how
many more were wasted.

The open sea killing was halted by interna-
tional agreement in 1911, when the United
States, Great Britain, Japan, and Russia con-
cluded a convention for the protection of
the North Paciﬁc fur seal. In exchange for
the ban on pelagic sealing, the United States
and the Soviet Union, under the agreement,
provide Japan and Canada each with 15
percent of the harvest from the Pribilofs and
15 percent of the harvest from those islands

is under Jurisdiction of the Soviet Union.
\ In addition tO’the conservation of the seal -

Alaska, which by the Alaska Statehood Act
obtains 70 percent of the net proceeds from
the sale of Alaska sealskins.

The majority of sealskins are presently
utilized by the_ European market. A ban
placed on the importation of seal pelts into
the United States would have little, if any,
effect on world seal harvests.

In theUnited States,.the Fur Seal Act of
1966 charged the Secretary of the Interior
with management of the fur seals. This re-
sponsibility was transferred to the Secre-
tary of Commerce on Oct. 3, 1970. The Na-
tional Oceanic and Atmospheric Admin-
istration’s National Marine Fisheries Service
supervises the harvest of an average 50,000
fur seals each summer on the Pribilof Islands.

There are now seal rookeries under US.
jurisdiction on Alaska’s Pribilof Islands of
St. Paul and St. George in the Bering Sea,
on Robben Island, and on the Kurile Islands
in the Seal of Okhotsk. There is substan-
tial intermixing between the herds of the
eastern and western Paciﬁc Ocean.

The harvest is restricted largely to 3- and
4-year old bachelor males that congregate on
the edges of the rookeries. Baby seals, or
pups, are not harvested. Females are taken
only when it is necessary to keep the number
of animals at the most productive level the
Pribilof environment can support. Over-
crowding brings higher mortality among the
pups. The battle for living space causes
injuries and leads to disease and starvation.
Such mortality, in the past, has taken up to
20% of the pups before they are sufﬁciently
mature to leave the rookeries.

One concern has been the length of the

.aths along which seals are driven from the -

Shore to the harvest. To reduce discomfort,
the drive paths have been shortened by ap-
proximately one-half. Experiments 'are
planned with other ground cover to deter-

‘ mine whether the drive can be further im- ~

proved.
Seals are harvested with clubs. They are
dispatched quickly with a blow to the head.
For several years, the Fisheries Service has
been experimenting with alternative methods
including drugs, gases, electricity, shooting,

- and others to dispatch seals. At this point,

despite extensive effort, none has been found
which accomplishes the task as quickly and
as humanely. The Service’s position is that it
cannot cause increased suffering, and intro-
duce an element of danger to the men em-
ployed in the harvest, simply to provide a
cosmetic death. Meanwhile, the quest for a
more humane method will be vigorously pur-
sued.

The Service has cooperated closely with
representatives of humane societies who ob-
serve the seal harvest annually. It will con-
tinue this cooperation. Further, the coopera-
tion of the American Veterinary Medical As-
sociation’s Research Committee is being
sought in the Service’s continuing search for
the most humane way in which to conduct
the harvest.

Should the fur seal harvest continue? When
the alternatives are considered, the answer
must be afﬁrmative.

Should the present managment scheme
be unilaterally halted by the United States,
other nations would, in all probability, re-
sume the harvest at sea, a wasteful and in-
humane process. -

If the Pribilof fur seal herd is not managed ‘

properly and excess numbers removed, many
will succumb to other environmental controls
such as parasites, diseases, and physical in-

jury magniﬁed by overcrowded conditions.-
Their illnesses and deaths, in many cases.

would be lingering, with pups suffering the
greatest losses. It is a rare occasion when
“natural” mortality is as humane as cur-
rent harvest methods.

population in its ancestral home would dis-
appear, with nothing in View to replace it.

As the barrest continues, with its opera-
tion under constant review within and out-
side of the government, the Pribilof fur seal
herd will be kept at a level of high, produc-
tive abundance, and the resource which has
been saved by careful conservation methods
will be preserved for the future.

STATUS AND MANAGEMENT OF MARINE
MAMMALS

The marine mammals are a varied group
of animals representing four orders of. the
class Mammalia: Cetacea (the whales, dol-
phins and porpoises); Carnivora (the sea
otter); Pinnipedia (the seals, sea lions and
walruses); and Sirenia (the dugongs and
manatees). Most of the species'are wide-
ranging animals which travel extensively
through international waters. Due to their
extensive movements and distribution and
their restriction to a marine environment,
with many species breeding in the far north,
research on this group has proven to be quite
difficult. In recent years, however, there has
been an' intensiﬁcation of research effort,
with international COOperation in some cases,
and man’s knowledge of this group is now
expanding.

Management needs of the marine mammals
vary With the species concerned, as would be
expected. In many cases, management is
complicated by the animals extensive move-
ments within international waters. With re-
spect to these species, sound management
depends on international cooperation.

The following discussion presents current
information on the status of the various
species, the opportunities for management,
present management measures, and the needs
for management.

WHALES AND OTIIER CETACEANS

Estimates of the population size of the
commercially utilized species of Whales indi-
cate that the populations are low and that
they are being taken at near or over the
maximum sustainable level, mainly by coun-
tries other than the United States. Those
previously utilized and which are now fully
protected as endangered species are, of
course, also at a low level. However, the fed-
eral government through the Departments of
the Interior and Commerce has prohibited
after December 1971, both the impo'rting of
products from whales and the taking of them
by US. citizens. This is the ultimate uni-
lateral protection possible by this nation.
Additional protection must come from other
countries. ‘-

Other cetaceans such as the dolphins, por-
poises, killer whales, and belugas appear to
be at about the optimum population size.
They are little utilized by US. citizens. Small
numbers are being taken mainly for live dis-
play in aquariums or research purposes. A
few beluga and bowhead whales are taken
for local use by the Eskimos in Alaska.

The approximate world population of
whales, but based in some-cases on limited
data, are as follows: '

Blue, 8,000.

Fin, 100,000+.

Sei, 120,000+.

Humpback, 4,000.

Right, 2,000.

Bowhead, 1,000.

Gray, 11,000.

Sperm, several hundred thousand.

Killer, 10,000.

The population size of dolphins and por-
poises is not known but probably ranges.
from 10,000 to 1,000,000 for, most species.

FUR SEAL

The Pribilof Islands fur seal population is
about 1.3 million which is near the number
which produces the greatest yearly surplus.

seas. See attached fact sheet 01 fur seals.

ELEPHANT SEAL AND SEA LION

,ﬁll‘he northern elephant seal is thought to
number about 20,000 while the California
sea lion population is about 50,000. Neither
of these species is utilized except for the cap-
ture of a'few sea lions for zoos and aquari-
ums. The Stellar sea lion numbers about
i 500,000 of which about 5,000 a year are taken
by natives in Alaska for food and the hides.

‘~ Sea lions are resident species under state

jurisdiction. .
HAm SEALS

Paciﬁc hair seal populations which include
the ribbon, ringed, bearded, and harbor seal

' appear to have stable populations with the

exception of the ribbon seal which has de-
creased in number through excessive kills by
the seal ﬂeet of the USSR. in the Chukchi
Sea. Population estimates for these seals are:
bearded—300,000,' ringed—250,000, ribbon——
150,000», harbor—200,000. It is estimated that
about 25,000—30,000 hair seals are taken an-
nually in Alaska for food and clothing and
sale of pelts primarily by Eskimos, Indians,
and Aleuts.
' SEA OTTER ,

~- g In the early days of this century the sea
otter population had been reduced by ex-

, ploitation to scattered remnants (a few hun- '

’gdred) at a number of diﬁerent islands. Un-
der a policy of complete protection which
began in 1911, the population spread and is
today in a phase of rapid growth. Studies by
the US. Fish and Wildlife Service in the
1950’s and early 1960’s showed that at that
time they had increased to at least 25 to
30 thousand animals and were rapidly spread-
ing into new areas. Aerial surveys have been
continued by the State of Alaska, and today
it is estimated that the population has grown
to about 40 to 50 thousand animals. The rate
of population growth in uncrowded areas is
at least 10 percent per year. In crowded pop-
ulations there is approximately a 4.percent
rate of increase and at islands where the
populations “exceed carrying capacity of the
habitat (i.e. more than 10 to 15 otters per
square mile of habitat) a population de-,
crease has been observed. Scientists believe
that stress mortality such as starvation, as
well as emigration accounts for the declining
populations in such cases. The annual rate
of reproduction is about 14.percent. Modern
population surveys are in accordance with
these ﬁndings.

The information presented above indicates
that where populations are crowded the sea
otter resource could easily be cropped to the

beneﬁt of the habitat and the health of the '

population. Present management in Alaska
is attempting to determine whether this is
actually the case. This management program
consists, basically of three approaches:

1. Experimental harvests are being con-

ducted at Amchitka Island. This population '-
has exceeded the carrying capacity of the.

habitat and has suffered large juvenile and
aged adult die-offs. Approximately 300 otters
have been harvested annually since 1965 in

an attempt to determine the level of harvest

that will beneﬁt the population. All harVest-

' ing is done by game biologists and only sin-'

gle, adult otters are taken. No females with
young are harvested. Some harvesting from

other crowded populations is also being per- .

formed by biologists. To date there has been
no observable decline in those populations
subjected to annual harvest.

2. Transplants of live otters have been.

made in southeastern Alaska, Washington,
Oregon, and British Columbia in areas hav-
ing suitable habitat but presently lacking
otter populations. There is evidence that
some of the transplants in southeastern
Alaska are being successful; pups have been
seen in these areas where otters previously
were not seen. Also, otters are still observed

on the Washington coast a considerable pe-
riod'of time after release. More time is need-
ed to fully evaluate the success of these at-

tempts, however. ,Further transplants are .'

planned as these attempts have the double
beneﬁt of, reducing pepulation pressure in
the crowded areas from which the animals
are taken and offering the potential for re-
establishment of the sea otter in areas from
which it had been extirpated. Natural spread
of the otter over its former range would
take 'a very long time as this species does not
emigrate to new areas until placed under
considerable population pressure and nat-
ural mortality is occurring. Even then, nat-
ural dispersion is slow and limited.

3. Complete protection is given to sea ot-
ters where their populations are below the
carrying capacity of the habitat and popula-
tion growth can be expected.

Management of the» sea otter, at present,
is under state jurisditcion, except where the
otters‘occur on land within a federal refuge
or where they occur on high seas outside the
3—mile limit. The sea otter now occurs on
the California coast off Monterey, possibly in
the transplant areas off Washington, Oregon
and British Columbia, and primarily along
the southern coast of Alaska, the Aleutian
Island, Medny Island, Kamchatka, and cer—
tain Kuril Islands, the latter three locations

being under the jurisdiction of the Soviet

Union.
' WALRUS
By the end'of the 19th century, the walus
population was greatly reduced. This reduc-

tion was due to the fact that Whalers, after

reducing northern whale populations (the
bowhead in particular), turned to walrus
hunting, using Eskimo laborers and guides.
When the populations of walrus became
greatly reduced, around the turn of the cen-
tury, commercial hunting of walrus ceased.
The harvest of walrus today ,consists of those
takenl by natives for food and ivory and
those-taken by trophy hunters. It is estimat-
ed that 2 to 3 thousand walrus have been

taken annually by the natives; actually few-

er are being taken every year. In 1970 the
UnitEd States native harvest amounted to
1,304 and an additional 23 walrus were taken
as trophies; of these 850 were adult males,
37.4 Were adult females and 103 were calves
The walrus also is under state Jurisdiction.
Alaska now limits the harvest by natives de-

, pendent on walrus for food to 5 adult females

or subadults of either sex per season. There
is no limit on adult males, and orphaned
calves may be taken without contributing to
the bag.

The decline in numbers of walrus harvested
by natives is primarily the result of two fac-
tors. The natives are moving into larger
towns, such as Nome, and few return to hunt
walrus. This trend will probably continue.

In addition, non-natives are now permitted ,

to take one adult male (trophy) by purchas—

‘ing a‘ $100 permit. Trophy hunters must be .

taken out by teams of native guides and the
natives may not harvest walrus While ac—
companying trophy hunters. These teams, if
harvesting walrus on their own rather than
accompanying trophy hunters, might kill
more than 100 adult male walrus per day.
The trophy hunter will pay at least $2,000
for the services of these natives. Thus, trophy
hunting has multiple beneﬁts; it reduces the
annual harvest of walrus and at the same
time permits economic utilization of the
walrus resource by the native population.

Management of the walrus in Alaska has
consisted of the following measures;

1. The only major hauling ground 'regu-
larly used by Walrus in Alaska, Round Island
of the Walrus Islands in northern Bristol Bay,
has been designated as a refuge and complete
protection is provided-there.

2. The annual harvest of walrus is con-

trolled and the regulations governing the 1
harvest favor the taking of adult males. Since

the walrus is polygamous, taking of adult

3

males, within limits, is not detrimental to
the population. .

While it is impossible to make any ﬁrm
estimate of walrus numbers because they are
widely scattered, aerial surveys indicate that
there are at least 60 to 100 thousand in the
Bering Sea population. Walrus are not yet

' overpopulated, but present evidence indi-_

cates that the populations are growing and
that the walrus are repopulating areas from
which they were extirpated. .

The Paciﬁc walrus population occurs in
international waters and in territorial waters ‘
of the United States and the USSR. Proper
management and regulation of the harvest
of this species, therefore, is dependent on in-
ternational cooperation. At present there is
no international agreement governing har-
vest of walrus.

HAWAIIAN MONK SEAL

Monk seals are the only tropical-water
seals in the world. In the 1,000 mile-long
chain of Paciﬁc Islands on which it breeds
'(Kure Island to French-Frigate Shoals) the
species was reduced by commercial exploita-
tion in the mid—19th century to a very low
level. The present population is not more
than 1,500 animals. Since 1909, when the
Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge
was created, the monk seal has been afforded
protection by the Federal Government. The
monk seal today breeds on only four islands;
all within the conﬁnes of the refuge.

There are indications that the monk 'seal
populations on the refuge are declining. At-
trition by shark bite is quite high and this
species will not tolerate human disturbance.
Therefore, management consists of complete
protection for this species, even to the ex-
clusion of disturbances from visitors. The
population is visited only about twice a year
to determine current status. This species is
presently classiﬁed as rare by the US. De-
partment of the Interior. ‘

POLAR BEAR -

The distribution of the polar bear is cir-
cumpolar and coincides with the Arctic ice
pack. This ice pack is in constant motion, cir-
culating with the ocean currents and it is
presumed that this motion affects movements
of the bears. Due to the adverse climatic
conditions present within the range of this.
species, research has been lacking. There has,
however, been an'intensiﬁcation of investiga-
tions on this species in recent years. -

A cooperative study of polar bears cur-
rently is being conducted by Canada, Den-
mark, Norway, the'U.S.S.R. and the United
States. This study was initiated following an
international meeting held in Fairbanks,
Alaska in 1965. Since then two working group
meetings were held in Morges, Switzerland,
Areas of needed research were outlined,
agreements were reached on standardizing
research methods and procedures and cer-
tain research problems assigned to individual .
specialists in attendance.

A review of harvest data reported by the '
involved countries indicates the arctic-wide
harvest of bears is now at least 1,250 an-
nually. In 1969, th harvest by country in-
cluded 128 for Greenland, 346 for Norway, 406
for Canada, 298 for the United States and a
few for the USSR. The harvest in Alaska is
controlled by that state which restricts the
number of permits issued to 300. It is illegal .
to harvest females with cubs.

Hunting parties originating in Alaska are
required to submit all skins and skulls of
polar bears to the Game Commission so that
age data may be obtained. Data from bears
harvested in Alaska show that theaverage age
of males has been declining since .1966. This
means that younger and smaller bears are
being taken, but not necessarilybthat the
population has been harmed. The survival of
young bears is thought to be enhanced by
the removal of older males since they are
known to be cannibalistic. Consideration

 




should be given to. reducing the kill, how-
ever, in order to maintain a better balanced
age ratio.

Management of the polar bear is compli-
cated by the fact that ﬁve nations have direct
interest in this species. Individual bears
range extensively over the arctic and it is not
known whether any nation has truly a resi-
dent population of polar bears. Any man-
agement program, to be successful, must be
based on international c00peration between
the nations concerned.

MANATEE

The manatee is given complete protection
as an endangered species by both state and
federal governments.

DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: Programs for the pro-
tection and scientiﬁc management of marine
mammals are being threatened by well-pub-
licized but misguided efforts which, if suc-
cessful, would destroy the conduct of biologi-
cally sound activities of state and federal
conservation agencies.

Conservation of this varied group of ani—
mals has been a long and arduous battle in
the face of indifference ' and exploitation.
Their management has been made more dif-
ﬁcult by the international movements of sev- ‘
eral of the species involved and insufﬁcient
knowledge concerning their habitat require-
ments. Progress has been and is being made,
however.

Some animals, such as the fur seal and sea
otter, have been restored to productive num-
bers. Research is underway into the life his-
tories, habitats, and movements of others.

Much more can be done. This will require
the understanding and support of the Ad—
ministration, support which no Administra-
tion heretofore has seen ﬁt to cenfer in any
degree commensurate with the need. Your
Administration could gain much support and
commendation by requesting adequate au~
thorities and funds to bring federal programs '
for marine mammals up to necessary levels
and by seeking new and more effective in-
ternational understanding.

Should these many past years of progress
be undermined by a complete “hands off”
policy forced upon responsible ﬁsh and wild—
life agencies, such as proposed by’S. 1315 and
similar House bills, marine mammals under
scientiﬁc management would suffer a serious
set back. '

In essence, the issue is whether natural re—
sources will be protected, managed and used
on a scientiﬁc basis or whether they are to be
regarded as something apart from and un-
aifected by man.

As has been amply demonstrated by the
successful management and restoration. of
other wildlife resources, the latter course is
unacceptable. Decisions regarding the well-
being of any wildlife resource must be based
on fact, not on emotion. ’ '

The following national conservation or-
ganizations respectfully request that you
support programs to improve domestic and
international management of marine mam-
mals. Further, we urge the Administration
to opposes. 1315 and similar House bills as('
being a negative response to a resource mange. ‘;
agement responsibility that should be ’
accepted by the Federal and State Govern;-
ments. '-. fl

in this matter, I agree it would be well for the Congress
to look into it.

Legislation to deal with this problem has been introduced
in the Senate and referred to the Commerce Committee, of
which I am a member. It is expected that hearings will
be held in the not too distant future.

However, as is often the case, there are two sides to the

OPPOSITION TO OCEAN MAMMAL
PROTECTION ACT

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, in a
speech delivered to this body on June 4,
1971, I expressed strong opposition to
S. 1315, the Ocean Mammal Protection
Act, and similar legislation now pending
in the House. In this speech, I contended
that the enactment of S. 1315 would be
extremely unwise from. both an ecological
and an economic point of view.

» In my remarks, I also mentioned that
my staff had contacted Mr. Tom Kimball,»
director of the National Wildlife Fed-
eration, and Mr. Dan Poole, president of
the Wildlife Management Institute, both
of whom oppose S. 1315 in that it pro—
hibits prudent management on the
Pribilofs and requires the termination of
the North Paciﬁc Fur Seal Convention.

This view is also held by the leaders of
many other prestigious and knowledge-
able conservation groups. In separate
letters to President Nixon and to all
Members of the House and Senate, these
leaders stated that programs for the
protection and scientiﬁc management of
marine mammals are being threatened
by well publicized, but misguided eiforts
which, if successful, would destroy the
operation of biologically sound activities
conducted by the State and Federal con-
servation agencies. The letters made clear
that the “hands off” policy proposed. in
S. 1315 and similar House bills would
severely jeopardize the efforts of respon-
sible ﬁsh and wildlife agencies to manage
their marine mammals programs in a
scientiﬁc manner. Thus, the ability of
these mammals to survive and prosper
would be adversely affected.

The conservationists signing the letter
to the President were Mr. William E.
Towell, executive vice president of the
American Forestry Association; Spencer
M. Smith, secretary of the Citizens Com-
' mittee on Natural Resources; Chester F.
Phelps, president of the International
Association of Game, Fish, and Conser-

representative of Trout Unlimited; Dan-
iel A. Poole, president of the Wildlife
Management Institute; and Ira N. Ga-
brielson, president of World Wildlife

The letter to House and Senate Mem-
bers, which was accompanied by a com-
prehensive fact sheet, was signed by
Harold J. Coolidge, honorary chairman

of the American Committee for Inter-,

national Wild Life Protection; Robert F.

In order that the contents of these

There being no objection, the letters
were ordered to be printed in the RECORD,

JUNE 18, 1
To all Members of the House and Senate.

An organized press and television cam
is underway to solicit support for ba
the taking of certain marine mam '
House and Senate bills to accomplish
are HR. 6554, S. 1315, and others.

The undersigned national conservatio
ganizations‘ believe such a step would int
fere with the needed scientiﬁc manageme
of these interesting and 'valuable animal
Some of these highly migratory animals can
be managed only through international
agreements. Others come under the various
jurisdictions of federal and state government.

.Total protection, as is being urged, would
halt a number of management programs,
some of which have been remarkably suc-
cessful. The application of science, not emo-
tion, has brought back the fur seal and the
sea otter from the shadows of extinction to-
their thriving and productive population
levels of today'.

Total protection also would make it im-
possible to manage any population of marine
mammals even though, under future circum- .
stances, a culling may be desirable in the in-' ‘
terest of man or to reduce local overpopula- '
tions that usually are detrimental to the
species itself. In some cases, protection also
would eliminate urgently needed sources of
income to Eskimos, Aleuts, and Indians and-
revenue for state and federal treasuries, as
well.

We believe that adoption of such a nega-
tive policy would be a serious mistake. We
believe the government should strengthen
its management authorities, including pro-
viding more funds and manpower, and should
explore new and more effective international
agreements. We believe that there is no sub-
stiturte for scientiﬁc fact when it comes to
assuring ,the perpetuation of any species.

The accompanying fact sheets provide more
detailed information on the 'status and .man-
agement opportunities for marine mammals,
should you have the time or need to read
them.

THE HARVEST OF THE PRIBILOF FUR SEALS

The northern_fur seal is a creature of the
high seas, the open water. It comes ashore
only to breed and bear its young.

Each year the fur seals leave the mist—
shrouded rookery islands of the North Pa-
ciﬁc to migrate as far south as California, as
far west as Japan. And each year their mys-
terious homing instinct draWs them back
across the ocean to the same rocky nursery
isles.

The adult male, or bull, may weigh 500
pounds or more and the female about 100
pounds, Harems are composed of one bull
and as many as 100 females, although the
average harem has about 40 females. The
pups are born in the early summer and
weigh about 10 pounds at birth. By the time

they depart for the sea in the late fall,

the pups may weigh 30 pounds or more.

The seal is a commercially valuable ani-
mal. Its furs are prized for coats; the meat
is consumed both by humans and by ani-
mals. The annual fur seal harvest on the
Pribilof Islands is virtually the sole source
of gainful work for the 600 Aleuts who live
in its two communities.

The seal herd of the Pribilofs today is.

thriving, its number estimated at 1%., million
animals. Its return from a dangerously low
level of 200,000 in 1911 is a historic story
in the annals of man’s effort to conserve
wildlife. '

That story began when the indiscriminate

slaughter of northern fur seals on the high
seas was ended. ‘

In the 18th century, the seals’ rich fur
made them targets of intensive hunting in
the Northern Hemisphere. '

The Russians discovered the Pribilof Is-
lands in 1786. In the ensuing years Russian
hunters reportedly took 2.5 million seal pelts.
Initially, harvesting was uncontrolled, breed-
ing females were unprotected in the Pribi-
lof herds were reduced to remnants. In 1834,
when the seals had been almost annihilated,
the Russians stopped killing females and
the herd began to increase. By 1867, when
the US; purchased Alaska, (including the
Pribilofs) the Pribilof herd had recovered to
the point that it sustained an annual har-
vest of 100,000 males for many years.

The United States began its jurisdiction
by permitting a number of independent
companies to operate. In the ﬁrst season
300,000 skins were taken. To protect the fur
seal-s, Congres in 1869 set aside the Pribilofs
as a special reservation. During the next 20
years, sealing on the Pribilofs'was conducted
under a leasing arrangement, with some 2
million sealskins taken. A second 20-year
lease produced only 343,000 skins, and in

1910 the. Federal Government assumed di--

rect management of the. approximately 200,-
000 fur seals that survived. ‘

During this- 40-year period, killing at sea
had continued. American, Canadian, and
Japanese sealers had shot and speared fur
seals from ships. They could not tell the sex
or age of the animals, many of which were
lost through wounding or sinking. When a.
nursing mother was‘ killed it often meant
slow starvation for her pup.

From 1879 to 1909, almost one million fur
seals were taken at sea. No one knows how
many more were wasted. ‘

The open sea killing was halted by interna-
tional agreement in 1911, when the United
States, Great Britain, Japan, and Russia con-
cluded a convention for the protection of
the North Paciﬁc fur seal. In exchange for
the ban, on pelagic sealing, the United States
and the Soviet Union, under the agreement,
provide Japan and Canada ‘ each with 15
percent of the harvest from the Pribilofs and
15 percent of the harvest from those islands
under jurisdiction of the Soviet Union.

\ In addition to'the conservation of the seal
herd made .poss1ble by this agreement, there
is now an economic 'gain for the State of

Alaska, which by the Alaska Statehood Act
obtains 70 percent of the net proceeds from
the sale of Alaska sealskins.

The majority of sealskins are presently
utilized by the European market. A ban
placed on the importation of seal pelts into
the United States would have little, if any,
effect on world seal harvests.

In theUnited States,.the Fur Seal Act of
1966 charged the Secretary of the Interior
with management of the fur seals. This re—
sponsibility was transferred to the Secre-
tary of Commerce on Oct. 3, 1970. The Na-
tional Oceanic and Atmospheric Admin-
istration’s National Marine Fisheries Service
supervises the harvest of an average 50,000
fur seals each summer on the Pribilof Islands.

There are now seal rookeries under US.
jurisdiction on Alaska’s Pribilof Islands of
St. Paul and St. George in the Bering Sea,
on Robben Island, and on the Kurile Islands
in the Seal of Okhotsk. There is substan-
tial intermixing between the herds of the
eastern and western Paciﬁc Ocean.

The harvest is restricted largely to 3- and
4-year old bachelor males that congregate on
the edges of the rookeries. Baby seals, or
pups, are not harvested. Females are taken
only when it is necessary to keep the number
of animals at the most productive level the
Pribilof environment can support. Over-
crOwding brings higher mortality among the
pups. The battle for living space causes
injuries and leads to disease and starvation.
Such mortality, in the past, has taken up to
20% of the pups before they are sufﬁciently
mature to leave the rookeries.

One concern has been the length of the
paths along which seals are driven from the
shore to the harvest. To reduce discomfort,
the drive paths have been shortened by ap-
proximately one-half. Experiments ‘are
planned with other ground cover to deter-
mine whether the drive can be further im-
proved. -

Seals are harvested with clubs. They are
dispatched quickly with a blow to the head.

For several years, the Fisheries Service has
been experimenting with alternative methods
including drugs, gases, electricity, shooting,
and others to dispatch seals. At this point,
despite extensive effort, none has been found
which accomplishes the task as quickly and
as humanely. The Service’s position is that it
cannot cause increased suffering, and intro-
duce an element of danger to the men em-
ployed in the harvest, simply to provide a
cosmetic death. Meanwhile, the quest for a
more humane method will be vigorously pur-
sued. \

The Service has cooperated closely with
representatives of humane societies who ob-
serve the seal harvest annually. It will con-
tinue this cooperation. Further, the coopera-
tion of the American Veterinary Medical As-
sociation’s Research Committee is being
sought in the Service’s continuing search for
the mostphumane way in which to conduct
the harvest.

Should the fur seal harvest continue? When
the alternatives are considered, the answer
must be afﬁrmative.

Should the present. managment scheme
be unilaterally halted by the United States,
other nations would, in all probability, re-
sume the harvest at sea, a wasteful and in-
humane process.

If the Pribilof fur seal herd is not managed
properly and excess numbers removed, many‘
will succumb to other environmental controls
such as parasites, diseases, and physical in-
jury magniﬁed by overcrowded conditions.

Their illnesses and- deaths, in many cases.

would be lingering, with pups suffering the
greatest losses. It is a rare occasion when:
“natural” mortality is as humane as cur-
rent harvest methods.

If proper‘managem-ent harvests are stopped,
the single source of employment for the Aleut

population in its ancestral home would dis-
appear, with nothing in view to replace it.

As the harvest continues, with its opera-
tion under constant review within and out-
side of the government, the Pribilof fur seal
herd will be kept at a level of high, produc-
tive abundance, and the resource which has
been saved by careful conservation methods
will be preserved for the future.

 

STATUS AND MANAGEMENT or MARINE
MAMMALS

The marine mammals are a varied group
of animals representing four orders of. the
class Mammal‘ia: Cetacea (the whales, dol-
phins and porpoises); Carnivora (the sea
otter); Pinnipedia (the seals, sea lions and
walruses); and Sirenia (the dugongs and
manatees). Most of the species are wide-
ranging animals which travel extensively
through international waters. Due to their
extensive movements and distribution and
their restriction to a. marine environment,
with many species breeding in the far north,“
research on this group has proven to be quite
difﬁcult. In recent years, however, there has
been an‘ intensification of research effort,
with international cooperation in some cases,
and man’s knowledge of this group is now
expanding. .

Management needs of the marine mammals
vary with the species concerned, as would be
expected. In many cases, management is
complicated by the animals extensive move~
ments within international waters. With re-
spect to these species, sound management
depends on international cooperation.

The following discussion presents current
information on. the status of the various
Species, the opportunities for management,
present management measures, and the needs
for management.

WHALES AND OTHER CETACEANS

Estimates of the population size of the
commercially utilized species of whales indi-
cate that the populations are low and that
they are being taken at near or over the
maximum sustainable level, mainly by coun-
tries other than the United States. Those
previously utilized and which are now fully
protected as endangered species are, of
course, also at a low level. However, the fed-
eral government through the Departments of
the Interior and Commerce has prohibited
after December 1971, both the importing of
products from whales and the taking of them
by US. citizens. This is the ultimate uni-
lateral protection possible by this nation.
Additional protection must come from other
countries.

Other cetaceans such as the dolphins, por-
poises, killer whales, and belugas appear to
be at about the optimum population size.
They are little utilized by US. citizens. Small
numbers are being taken mainly for live dis-
play in aquariums or research purposes. A
few beluga and bowhead whales are taken
for local use by the Eskimos in Alaska.

The approximate world population of
whales, but based in some cases on limited
data, are as follows:

Blue, 8,000.

Fin, 100,000+.

Sei, 120,000+.

Humpback, 4,000.

Right, 2,000.

Bowhead, 1,000.

Gray, 11,000.

Sperm, several hundred thousand.

Killer, 10,000.

The population size of dolphins and por-
poises is not known but probably ranges
from 10,000 to 1,000,000 for most species.

FU R SEAL

The Pribilof Islands fur seal population is
about 1.3 million which is near the number
which produces the greatest yearly surplus.
These seals are taken only on the Pribilof
Islands under the direct supervision of the

mHHnCAmH‘ﬁﬁﬁHhﬁHI-dh AﬂﬁH-H—IAA-L AHAH4.1.Arnn_u__.|_a_a--.sn.n..-._..n-..

dmmmnH‘ﬂH




federal government. International treaty

forbids the killing of fur seals on the high

seas; See attached fact sheet oh fur seals.
ELEPHANT SEAL AND SEA LION

The northern elephant seal. is thought to
number about 20,000 while the California
sea lion population is about 50,000. Neither
of these species is utilized except for the cap?
ture of a few sea lions for zoos and aquari-
ums. 'The Stellar sea lion numbers about
500,000 of which about 5,000 a year are taken
by natives in Alaska for food and the hides.
Sea lions are resident species under state
jurisdiction.

HAIR SEALS

Paciﬁc hair seal populations which include
the ribbon, ringed, bearded, and harbor seal
appear to have stable populations with the
exception of the ribbon seal Which has de-
creased in number through excessive kills by
the seal ﬂeet of the USSR. in the Chukchi
Sea. Population estimates for these seals are '
bearded—300,000, ringed—250,000, ribbon—
150,000, harbor-200,000. It is estimated that
about 25,000—30,000 hair seals are taken an-
nually in Alaska for food and clothing and
sale of pelts primarily by Eskimos,- Indians,
and Aleuts.

SEA OTTER

. In the early days of this century the sea
otter population had been reduced by ex-
ploitation to scattered remnants (a few hun-
dred) at a number of different islands. Un-
der a policy of complete protection which
began in 1911, the population spread and is
today in a phase of rapid growth. Studies by
the US. Fish and Wildlife Service in the
1950’s and early 1960’s showed that at that
time they had increased to at least 25 to
$0 thousand animals and were rapidly spread-
ing into new areas. Aerial surveys have been
continued by the State of Alaska, and today
it is estimated that the population has grown
to about 40 to 50 thousand animals. The rate
of population growth in uncrowded areas is
at least 10 percent per year. In crowded pop-
ulations there is approximately a 4 percent
rate of increaSe and at islands Where the
populations exceed carrying capacity of the
habitat (i.e. more than 10 to 15 otters per
square mile of habitat) a population de-
crease has been observed. Scientists believe
that stress mortality such as starvation, as
well as emigration accounts for the declining
populations in such cases. The annual rate
of reproduction is about 14 percent. Modern
population surveys are in accordance with
these ﬁndings.

The information presented above indicates .

that where populations are crowded the sea
otter resource could easily be cropped to the
beneﬁt of the habitat and the health of the
population. Present management in Alaska
1s attempting to determine whether this is
actually the case. This management program
consists, basically of three approaches:

1. Experimental harvests are being con-
ducted at Amchitka Island. This population
hasexceeded the carrying capacity of the
habitat and has suifered large juVenile and
aged adult die-oﬁs. Approximately 300 otters
have been harvested annually since 1965 in
an attempt to determine the level of harvest
that will beneﬁt the population. All harvest-
mg is done by game biologists and only sin-
gle, adult otters are taken. No females with
young are harvested. Some harvesting from
other crowded populations is also being per-
formed by biologists. To date there has been
no observable decline in those populations
sublected to annual harvest.

2. Transplants of live otters have been
made in southeastern Alaska, Washington,
Cregon, and British Columbia in areas hav-
lng suitable habitat but presently lacking
otter populations. There is evidence that
some of the transplants in southeastern
Alaska are being successful; pups have been
seen in these areas where otters previously
were not seen. Also, otters are still observed

on the Washington coast a considerable pe-
riod'of time after release. More time is need-
ed to fully evaluate the success of these at-
tempts, however. .F'urther transplants are
planned as these attempts have the double
beneﬁt of. reducing population pressure in
the crowded areas from which the animals
are taken and Offeringmhe potential for re-

establishment of the sea otter in areas frOm

which it had been extirpated. Natural spread
of the otter over its former range would
take 'a very long time as this species does not
emigrate to new areas until placed under
considerable population pressure and nat-
ural mortality is occurring. Even then, nat-
ural dispersion is slow and limited.

3. Complete protection is given to sea ot-
ters where their populations are below the
carrying capacity of the habitat and populas
tion growth can be expected.

Management of the ‘- sea otter, at present,
is under state jurisditcion, except where the
otters occur on land within a. federal refuge
or where they occur on high seas outside the
3-.mile limit. The sea otter now occurs on
the California coast off Monterey, possibly in
the transplant areas oil‘- Washington, Oregon
and British Columbia, and primarily along
the southern coast of Alaska, the Aleutian
Island, Medny Island, Kamchatka, and cer-
tain Kuril Islands, the latter three locations
being under the jurisdiction of the Soviet
Union.

WALRUS

By the end’of the 19th century, the walus
population was greatly reduced. This reduc-

tion was due to the fact that whalers, after

reducing northern whale populations (the
bowhead in particular), turned to walrus
hunting, using Eskimo laborers and guides.
When the populations of walrus became
greatly reduced, around the turn of the cen-
tury, commercial hunting of walrus ceased.
The harvest of walrus today consists of those
takenl‘by natives for food and ivory and
thosetaken by trophy hunters. It is estimat-
ed that 2 to 3 thousand walrus have been
taken annually by the natives; actually few-
er are being taken every year. In 1970 the
United States native harvest amounted to
1,304 and an additional 23 walrus were taken
as trophies; of these 850 were adult males,
374 Were adult females and 103 were calves

e walrus also is under state jurisdiction.
Alaska now limits the harvest by natives de-
pendent on walrus for food to 5 adult females
or subadults of either sex per season. There
is no limit on adult males. and orphaned
calves may be taken without contributing to
the bag.

The. decline in numbers of walrus harvested
by natives is primarily the result of two fac-’-
tors. The natives are moving into larger
towns, such as Nome, and few return to hunt
walrus. This trend will probably continue.
In addition, non-natives are now permitted
to take one adult male (trophy) by purchas-
ing a: $100 permit. Trophy hunters must be
taken out by teams of native guides and the
natives may not harvest walrus While ac-
companying trophy hunters. These teams, if
harvesting walrus on their own rather than
accompanying trophy hunters, might kill
more than 100 adult male walrus, per day.
The trophy hunter will pay at least $2,000
for the services of these natives. Thus, trophy
hunting has multiple beneﬁts; it reduces the
annual harvest 01' walrus and at the same
time permits economic utilization of the
walrus resource by the native population.

Management of the walrus in Alaska has
consisted of the following measures;

1. The only major hauling ground regu-
larly used by Walrus in Alaska, Round Island
of the Walrus Islands in northern Bristol Bay,
has been designated as a refuge and complete
protection is provided there.

2. The annual harvest of walrus is con-
trolled and the regulations governing the
harvest favor the taking of adult males. Since
the walrus is polygamous, taking of adult

3

males, within limits, is not detrimental to
the population.

While it is impossible to make any ﬁrm
estimate of walrus numbers because they are
widely scattered, aerial surveys indicate that
there are at least 60 to 100 thousand in the
Bering Sea population. Walrus are not yet
overpopulated, but present evidence indie
cates that the populations are growing and
that the walrus are repopulating areas from
which they were extirpated.

The Paciﬁc walrus population occurs in,
international waters and in territorial waters
of the United States and the USSR. Proper
management and regulation of the harvest
of this species, therefore, is dependent on inr
ternational cooperation. At present there is
no international agreement governing har-
vest of walrus.

HAWAIIAN MONK SEAL

Monk seals are the only tropical-water
seals in the world. In the 1,000 mile-long
chain of Paciﬁc Islands on which it breeds
'(Kure Island to French-Frigate Shoals) the
species was reduced by commercial exploita-
tion in the mid-19th century to a very low
level. The present population is not more
than 1,500 animals. Since 1909, when the
Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge
was created, the monk seal has been aﬁ’orded
protection by the Federal Government. The
monk seal today breeds on only four islands;
all within the conﬁnes of the refuge.

There are indications that the monk seal
populations on the refuge are declining. At-
trition by shark bite is quite high and this
Species will not tolerate human disturbance.
Therefore, management consists of complete
protection for this species, even to the ex-
clusion of disturbances from visitors. The
population is visited only abOut twice a year
to determine current status. This Species is
presently classiﬁed as rare by the US. De-
partment of the Interior.

POLAR BEAR

The distribution of the polar bear is cir-
cumpolar and coincides with the Arctic ice
pack. This ice pack is in constant motion, cir-
culating with the ocean currents and it is
presumed that this motion aﬁ'ects movements
of the bears. Due to the adverse climatic
conditions present within the range of this
species, research has been lacking. There has,
however, been an intensiﬁcation of investiga-
tions on this species in recent years.

A cooperative study of polar bears cur-
rently is being conducted by Canada, Den-
mark, Norway, the U.S.S.R. and the United
States. This study was initiated following an
international meeting held in Fairbanks,
Alaska in 1965.‘Since then two working group
meetings were held in Merges, Switzerland.
Areas of needed research were outlined,
agreements were reached on standardizing
research methods and,procedures and cer-
tain research problems assigned to individual
specialists in attendance.

A review of harvest data reported by the
involved countries indicates the arctic-wide
harvest of bears is now at least 1,250 an-
nually. In 1969, th harvest by country in-
cluded 128 for Greenland, 346 for Norway, 406
for Canada, 298 for the United States and a
few for the USSR. The harvest in Alaska is
controlled by that state which restricts the
number of permits issued to 300. It is illegal
to harvest females with cubs.

Hunting'parties originating in Alaska are
required to submit all skins and skulls of
polar bears to the Game Commission so that
age data may be obtained. Data from bears
harvested in Alaska show that the average age
of males has been declining since 1966. This
means that younger and smaller bears are
being taken, but not necessarily that the
population has been harmed. The survival of
young bears is thought to be enhanced by
the removal of older males since they are
known to be cannibalistic. Consideration

 




should be given to reducing the kill, how-
ever, in order to maintain a better balanced
age ratio.

Management of the polar bear is compli-
cated by the fact that ﬁve nations have direct
interest in this species. Individual bears
range extensively over the arctic and it is not
known whether any nation has truly a resi-
dent population of polar bears. Any man-
agement program, to be successful, must be
based on international cooperation between
the nations concerned.

' MANATEE

The manatee is given complete protection
as an endangered species by both state and
federal governments.

JUNE 9, 1971.
Hon. RICHARD M. NIXON,
The White House,
Washington, DC.

DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: Programs for the pro-
tection and scientiﬁc management of marine
mammals are being threatened by well-pub-
licized but misguided efforts which, if suc—
cessful, would destroy the conduct of biologi-
cally sound activities of state and federal
conservation agencies.

Conservation of this varied group of ani-
mals has been a long and arduous battle in
the face of indifference ’and exploitation.
Their management has been made more dif-
ﬁcult by the international movements of sev-
eral of the species involved and insufﬁcient
knowledge concerning their habitat require-
ments. Progress has been and is being made,
however.

Some animals, such as the fur seal and sea
otter, have been restored to productive num-
bers. Research is underway into the life his-
tories, habitats, and movements of others.

Much more can be done. This will require
the understanding and support of the Ad-
ministration, support which no Administra—

tion heretofore has seen ﬁt to confer in any
degree commensurate with the need. Your
Administration could gain much support and
commendation by requesting adequate au—
thorities and funds to bring federal programs
for marine mammals up to necessary levels
and by seeking new and more effective in-
ternational understanding.

Should these many past years of progress
be undermined by a complete “hands oﬁf”
policy forced upon responsible ﬁsh and wild-
life agencies, such as proposed by'S. 1315 and
similar House bills, marine mammals under
scientiﬁc management would suffer a serious
set back.

In essence, the issue is whether natural re-
sources will be protected, managed and used
on a scientiﬁc basis or whether they are to be
regarded as something apart from and un-
affected by man.

As has been amply demonstrated by the
successful management and restoration. of
other wildlife resources, the latter course is
unacceptable. Decisions regarding the well-
being of any wildlife resource must be based
on fact, not on emotion.

The following national conservation or-
ganizations respectfully request that you
support programs to improve domestic and
international management of marine mam-
mals. Further, we urge the Administration
to oppOSe S. 1315 and similar House bills as
being a negative response to a resource mans»
agement responsibility that should be
accepted by the Federal and State Govern-
" ments.

Sincerely,

William ~oE. Towell, Spencer M. Smith,
Chester F. Phelps, Joseph W. Penfold,
Charles H. Callison, Maxwell E. Rich,

iel A. Poole, and Ira N. Gabrielson;

SHOOTING ANIMALS FROM AIRCRAFT

 

NOVEMBER 2, 1971.——-Ordered to be printed

 

Mr. HART, from the Committee on Commerce,
submitted the following

R E P O R T
together with

SUPPLEMENTAL VIEWS

[To accompany H.R. 5060]

, The Committee on Commerce, to which was referred the bill (H.R.
5060) to amend the Fish and Wildlife Act 1956 to provide a criminal
penalty. for shooting at certain birds, ﬁsh, and other animals from an
aircraft, having considered the same, reports favorably thereon with
amendments and recommends that the bill as amended do pass.

The amendments are as follows: ‘

On page 2, line 10, strike the period and insert the following:

, and each such person so operating under a license or permit
shall report to the applicable issuing authority each calendar
quarter the number and type Of animals so taken.

On page 2, line 21, strike “and”.
On page 2, between lines 21 and 22, insert the following:

(C) the number and type of animals taken by such
person to whom a permit was issued; and

On page 2, line 22, redesignate “(C)”, as “(D)”.

PURPOSE OF THE LEGISLATION

The bill, subject to certain exceptions, would make it unlawful for
anyone while airborne to shoot or attempt to shoot for the purpose Of
capturing or killing any bird, ﬁsh, or other animal or to harass any
bird, ﬁsh, or other animal, or to knOwingly participate in using an
aircraft for such purposes. Exceptions would be made for Federal

and State employees, agents, or permittees authorized to conduct
suchactivities to protect land, water, wildlife, livestock, domesticated
animals”, human life, or crops. ’ ' ‘ j . '

It is not the purpose of this legislation to infringe upon the tradi—,
tional responsibility of the States to manage fish and resident wildlife
within State boundaries. Rather, this bill would regulate the airspace
of the United States to prohibit the type of activity described above.

Violators would be subject to a $5,000 penalty or 1 year imprison-
ment, or both. In addition, violators holding an airman certiﬁcate
would be subject to having their "certiﬁcate" amended", medified, sus-
pended, or revoked at the discretion of the Administrator of the Federal
Aviation Administration. . _

LEGISLATIVE BACKGROUND

H.R. 5060 passed the House on May 17, 1971, and was referred to
the Senate Committee on Commerce the following day.

There were two-senate companion..proposals—~<—S:.z78’ (identical to
H.R. 15188 of the 9lst Congress, which passed the House December 7,
1970, but failed to pass the Senate), which was introduced in the
Senate by Mr. Nelson, withcosponsors, on January 25, 1971; and S.
1563, indentical to H.R. 5060 ’as‘iintroduced in the House, which was
introduced in the Senate by Mr. Schweiker on April 19, 1971.

The House passed version of Hit. 5060 differs from S. 1563 in the
following 3 respects: (1) (it extends the exemptions to the prohibition
against shooting animal’s'from aircraft "to those "protecting livestock,
domesticated animals, human. life, and crops, in addition to protecting
land, water and wildlife; (2) it requires the report to the Secretary of
the Interior on permits issued to contain not only a description of the
animals. to be taken but also the area .from‘whicih, they are authorized
tobe taken and the number of animalsauthorized; and (-3) it changes
the effective. date Of the Actto‘take into account thoseStates which
do not, now have the administrative machinery .130 issue permits and
which must wait until the next session of the State legislature to set up
a permit program. S. 78 differs from S. 1563 only in that it does not
include thesection requiring a report to theSecretary of the Interior
on all permits issued. ‘ .

In his reports on the companion measures, S. 78 and S}. 1563, the
Comptroller General made no recommendation. The Department of
Agriculture in its report on S. 78 and the Department of the Interior in
a combined report on S. 78 and S. 1563 opposed the legislation mainly
on the grounds that its obj ectiveic0uld best be attained by the enact-
ment of uniform State laws and because of the rights of states to reg-
ulate the taking of resident species; In addition, the Department of
the Interior expressed concern that the legiSIation would hamper their
use of aircraft in the cOntrol of animals which constitute a threat to
livestock, agriculture, or human health. The De artment of Trans-
portation in its report‘on S. 1563 deferred to t e Departments of
Interior and Justice on sections 1 and 3 of the bill. With regard to
Section 2, the Department of transportation declared it unnecessary
becauSe of existing regulations dealing With hunting from airCraft as an
aviation safety problem. The Department of Justice found both bills
of doubtful constitutionality. " '

- COMMITTEE AMENDMENT

The Amendment of the Committee on Commerce provides that any—
one receiving a permit authorizing the hunting Of animals from aircraft
shall report quarterly to theissuing authority the number and type of
animalstaken. When that issuingauthority is a State orstate agency,
it will be required in turn to include such information: in itsannual re—
port t’othe Secretary. This amendment is designed'to give both the
Department of the Interior and thosestate agencies which iSsue permits
a better knowledge of exactly how ,many animal's._and what kind of
animals are being taken from. aircraft, thereby providing an, effective
means of. oversightand evaluation of the administration of the Act.

lNEED FOR THE LEeISLA'rION . .
'_ ln Nevemberj of ‘1969,’_ the 'NBC‘television netwOrklsliowed adOCu-
mentary ﬁlm entitled “TheWolfMenf? Several scenesfrom the ﬁlm

, depicted the huntingofHWOlves frOm aircraft and presented: an interest—

ing account of, the Status of the North American wolf._ 7
Two species of Wolf, the eastern wolf and the Texas red wolf, are
listed by, the Department of the Interior as endangered species. 1970
statistics from the Department of'the Interior indicatea total count
of all species‘of wolveslin the Unitengtates to be aboutf5,80’0, of which
approximately 5,000 are found in.'Al’askaf, 750 in Minn‘esOta, 25 in Isle
Royal National Park, 12 elsewhere in Michigan, 12 in Yellowstone
National Park, and occasional numbers in Washington, State and in
Glacier National Park. Over theyearsthe red‘wolfihas been thought
to be more numerous than it aetua‘lly is beCause Of its close resemblance
to the coyote. F iguresfrom’ the'DepartmentOf the Interior indicate
that in 1969, the mest recent year for Which ﬁgures are available, 1008

were killedinAla'ska,’ 40% Of them'from aircraft; . 3

. Many States have already enacted l we to regulate the use of air-
craft for hunting. No State now permits the shootingof game animals
from airplanes, and 35 st’ates'have eXtended the prohibitiOn to include
nongame animals as well. . ‘0 _ . ' " , ‘

This year the killing; Of over 500 eagles from helicopters in Wyoming
and Colorado indicated the need to curb this practice; It is most un-
sportsmanlike to hunt frOmlaircraftt Not only would the bill prohibit
the hunting of endangered species, but all species of ﬁsh, birds, or
other animals. ‘ ' ' '

WHAT THE BILL DOES: SECIION-BY-SECTION. ANALYSIS

The bill would amend the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956 to add at
the end thereof a new section 1-3 and the Federal Aviation Act of 1958
to add a new subsection (b) to section 509. There follo WS asection-by-l

section analysis” of H.R. 5060, as amended.

SECTION 1_ ‘

Subsection (a) Of this section would make it unlawful for anyone
while airborne in *an’aircraft (1) to shoot or attempt to shoot for the
purpose of capturing or killing any bird, ﬁsh, or other animal, or (2)
to use such aircraft to harass any bird, ﬁsh, or other animal. In

 

 




 

 

4

addition, it would be unlawful for anyone to knowingly participate
in using an aircraft for such purposes. . .

Violators would be subiect to a ﬁne of $5,000 or 1 year imprisonment,
or both.

Subsection (b)(1) of this section would make the prohibition inap-
plicable to any person carrying out his duties to administer and
protect, or aid in the administration and protection of land, water,
wildlife, livestock, domesticated animals, human life, or crops if such
person is an employee or authorized agent, or is operating under
permit of any State or the United States provided that those who
operate under such permits report quarterly to the issuing authority
how many animals they have taken. The language of subsection (b)
attempts to satisfy the concern expressed by the Department of the
Interior.

It should be made clear that ranchers using aircraft to carry out
general management operations would. not be in violation of the act.
It is not intended that the prohibition in subsection (a) be extended
to include domestic or domesticated animals nor is it the intention to
prevent ranch operators or their agents from using aircraft in ranch
management operations, except when such aerial operations may
affect wild animals as speciﬁed elsewhere in the act. The necessity of
working or moving cattle or other forms of livestOck, domesticated
buffalo and other forms of privately owned and managed wildlife, is
necessary and should be allowed. In addition, it is clearly not intended
that aircraft be restricted in any way from use as a means of trans-
portation for hunting, provided no hunting nor harassment takes
place from the aircraft while airborne as provided in subsection (a).

Subsection (b) (2) of this section would establish a reporting pro—
cedure to be followed in any case in which a State or any agency
thereof issued a permit under the authority of subsection (b)(1).
Required to be included in the report to the Secretary of the Interior
on an annual basis would be (A) the name and address of each person
to whom a permit was issued; (B) a description and number of animals
authorized to be taken and a description of the area from which the
animal is to be taken; (c) the number and type of animals actually
taken by those persons to whom permits were issued; and (D) the
reason for Issuing such permit. It is to be hoped that the States will
utilize the permit authority cautiously when issuing permits in order
that the obiectives of this legislation can be successfully accom plished.

Subsection (0) of this section would deﬁne the term “aircraft” as
used. in this section .to meanany contrivance used for ﬂight in air, in—
cluding but not limited to airplanes and helicopters of any sort.

SECTION 2

Subsection (a) of this seetion' would amend ° '

. . . section 609 of the
Federail AZiatio&éAct of $953019 U.S.C. 1429) to designate the exist-
ing su sec ion as su section (a and t f a

regarding the use or operation of any air-craft. This would, of course, be
subject to the defense that the activity was permitted pursuant to
subsection (b) of the ﬁrst section of the bill.

Section 609 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1968 authorized the
Federal Aviation Administrator, among other things, to revoke or
modify an airman certiﬁcate if safety in air commerce or air transporta-
tion and the public interest require it. Hunting from aircraft or dis-
charging ﬁrearms from aircraft and harassing and chasing wildlife at
low altitudes would certainly produce a safety hazard. Acting under
the powers of the Congress to regulate interstate commerce, which
would include licensing of aircraft operators, it would be appropriate
to authorize the Administrator to regulate the performance and be—
havior of aircraft and their pilots and operators. Accordingly, the
Federal Aviation Act of 1958 would be amended to give the Adminis-
trator the authority to amend, modify, suspend, or revoke any airman
certiﬁcate upon the conviction of such holder of any violation under
section 1 of the reported bill.

Subsections (b)(1) and (2) of this section would appropriately
amend the section heading of section 609 and the table of contents of
the Federal Aviation Act of 1958. ’

SECTION 3

Section 3 would provide that the amendments to the Fish and Wild—
life Act of 1956 made by the ﬁrst section of H.R. 5060 would take
effect 30 days after the enactment of that section. However, with
10:51:)ch to any State that is not now authorized to issue any permit
referred to in the ﬁrst section of the bill, such amendments would not
take effect until 30 days after the expiration of the next regular session
of such State’s legislature convened on or after the date of the enact—
ment of this Act.

CONCLUSION

The absence of a constitutional basis for the legislation has been
suggested by the Department of Justice on the ground that its criminal
provision would apply whether an oﬁense is committed over or on
Federal, State, or private lands.

In the Federal Constitution the Congress is granted the power to
regulate commerce among the several States. By virtue of this clause,
it is held that the Congress has the paramount power of control over
air just as it has over navigable streams and interstate commerce on
land; that is, the sovereignty of the Federal Government in airspace
above the United States, like that over navigable waters, is complete.

This parallel between the sovereignty over airspace and navigable
waters was asserted as the constitutional basis of the Air Commerce
Act of 1926. Under this assumption, the Congress, in the Civil Aero—
nautics Act of 1938, asserted that “the United States of America is . .
to possess and exercise complete and exclusive national sovereignty in
the airspace above the United States. . . .”

Case history has indicated that exclusive national sovereignty was
not intended to mean, and is not the same as, exclusive ownership.
Just as in the case of navigable streams—with respect to which the
Congress acts by virtue of its commerce power—wherein the title to
the beds and banks are in the States and riparian owners subject, in

 




 

6

their use, to the Federal power over navigation, so it is in the case of
the navigable airspace; that is, the use and title to the air space remains
in the States and landowners subject to the paramount Federal power
over air commerce and navigation and the instruments thereof. .

By virtue Of this paramount power,it is held that this legislation—
which in essence prescribes the use and operation Of aircraft for the
purpose of hunting animals, and prescribes a criminal penalty upon
conviction for a violation has a constitutional basis in the commerce
clause of the Federal Constitution. This is the same basis which supports
the presumption by the Federal Government of the power to regulate
the use and operation Of aircraft in the Nation’s airspace, safety and
registration requirements for pilots and operators, and in addition,
civil and criminal punishment for crimes related to the use and opera
tion of an aircraft. H.R. 5060 conforms to this regulatory concept in
that it proposes the further exercise and extension of this preempted
power to the regulation Of the use and operation of aircraft for hunting
pruposes.

 

COST OF THE LEGISLATION

In the event the legislation is enacted, it is anticipated there would
not be any additional cost to the Federal Government, except for any
enforcement or surveillance activities undertaken by the Federal
Government, which at this time is an unknown quantity impracticable
Of estimate.

DEPARTMENTAL REPORTS

Departmental reports received on the Senate companion bills tO
H.R. 5060 (S. 78 and S. 1563), are as follows:

UNITED STATEs DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY,
Washington, D.C., April 29, 1971.
Hon. WARREN G. MAGNUSON,
Chairman, Committee on Commerce,
US. Senate,
Washington, DC.

DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: This responds to your recent request for
our comments on S. 1563 and S. 78, similar bills “To amend the Fish
and Wildlife Act of 1956 to provide a criminal penalty for shooting
at certain birds, ﬁsh, and other animals from aircraft.”

Because we favor the enactment of uniform State laws to regulate
the killIng of Wild animals for sport from aircraft, this Department
recommends against the enactment of S. 1563 and S. 78.-

S. 1563 and S. 78 would amend the Fish and Wildlife Act Of 1956,
as amended (16. U.S.C. 742a et seq.) by adding a new section 12 to
establish a crImInal penalty for shooting from an aircraft at any bird,
fish or other animal. Proposed subsection 12(b)(1) would exempt
from this prohibitlon any employee or authorized agent of the United
States or, any State, and any person operating under permit of any
State or the United States, in the discharge'of duties relative to the
admimstration or protectionpf land, water or wildlife. Subsection
(b) (2) Of‘ S.‘ 1563 would require that any ‘State issuing such permits
ﬁle an annual report Contalning information prescribed by the Secre-
tary Of the Interim; - ‘ " = ' 2? 't . . '

 




 

7

Section 2 Of both bills would amend the Federal Aviation Act of
1958 (49 U.S.C. 1429) to authorize suspension, modiﬁcation, Or amend-
ment Of an airman’s certiﬁcate upon conviction for a violation Of the
prohibition against shooting from aircraft.

While in agreement with the basic objective Of this legislation, we
are concerned, ﬁrst, that Federal regulation such as that anticipated
by S. 1563 and S. 78 would be deemed an interference'with States’
rights to regulate the taking Of resident species. It is generally accepted
that a State’s jurisdiction is derived from its police power and status
as sovereign. Fish and game, including migratory birds, may not be
taken except in full compiance with State law and regulation. It should
be noted, in this connection, that many States have enacted laws to
regulate the use Of aircraft for hunting. NO State now permits the
shooting Of game animals from aircraft, and many have extended that
prohibition to include non-game animals as well.

In addition, these bills as drafted would not provide clear exemption
for Federal employees engaged in duties other than those associated
with the administration or protection Of land, water or wildlife. Our
Bureau Of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife, for instance, makes use of
aircraft in its control Of animals which contitute a threat to livestock,
agriculture or human health.

This Department believes that the killing Of wild animals for sport
from aircraft should be prohibited on Federal, State, and private lands.
It is our opinion that this objective can best be attained, and the
question Of jurisdiction most easily resolved, by the enactment Of uni—
form State laws.

The Ofﬁce of Management and Budget has advised that there is no
objection to the presentation of this report from the standpoint Of the
Administration’s program.

Sincerely yours,
HOLLIS M. DOLE,
Assistant Secretary of the Interior.

DEAR SENATOR: This is in response to your request for the views
Of the Department of Justice on S. 78, a bill “To amend the Fish and
Wildlife Act Of 1956 to provide a criminal penalty for shooting at
certain birds, ﬁsh, and other animals from an aircraft.”

The bill would add a new section to the Fish and Wildlife Act Of
1956 to provide that whoever while airborne in an aircraft shoots at
or harasses any bird, ﬁsh or other animal, or knowmgly participates
in using an aircraft for such purpose, shall be ﬁned notOmore than
$5,000 or. imprisoned not more than one year, or_both. Thls prov1s10n
Would be: inapplicable to an ind1v1dual dlscharglng duties as an em-
ployee or permittee Of the United States or Of a. state. The blll would
also amend the Federal Aviation Act to pI'OVlde for suspension or

 




 

8

revocation of any airman. certiﬁcate upon conviction of the holder
thereof of a violation of the bill. ‘ . ‘

This Department is of the view that the blll as proposed 1s of doubt-
ful constitutionality. The criminal provisions Would apply whether
the offense is committed over or on federal, state, or private lands
and we can ﬁnd no basis for asserting federal criminal jurisdictlon
in this broad context. .

The Department is not aware of any precedent for a conservation
measure of this breadth. The Endangered Species Act amendments,
83 Stat. 282 (16 U.S.C. 668aa et seq.) rely on the commerce and treaty
powers and are limited in their impact to interstate and foreign com-
merce and preservation of species on federal property. They do not
reach purely intrastate activities. The Bald and Golden Eagle Act,
54 Stat. 250, as amended (16 U.S.C. 668—668d) does extend to purely
intrastate activities but it is premised on the unique nature of the-
bird as a national symbol rather than on the conservation of a bio-
logical species. In the Department’s view it would not serve as a.
statutory precedent for a measure as broad as S. 78.

Existing federal statutes concerning hunting and ﬁshing violations
are related either to federal property, to interstate commerce, or to
the effectuation or implementation of treaties. See 18 U.S.C. 41—47',
16 U.S.C. 703. The one provision similar to this bill, 18 U.S.C. 47,
dealing with hunting from aircraft, is limited to public land or ranges,
that is, federal property. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C.
703), which applies to “any migratory bird,” has been upheld under
the power of Congress to implement treaties.

It is also doubtful whether such legislation could be based upon
federal jurisdiction over airspace. Section 1108 of the Federal Aviation
Act, 72 Stat. 798, 49 U.S.C. 1508, asserts exclusive national sovereignty
over the airspace of the United States. However, this assertion of
jurisdiction is in the context of the country’s relations with other
nations and has not been used as a basis for exclusive federal criminal
jurisdiction.

Until recently the federal statutes concerning crimes aboard
aircraft were cast in terms relating solely to interstate and foreign
commerce. See 49 U.S.C. 1472, 18 U.S.C. 31—35. Last year Congress
broadened the criminal provisions on air piracy and related oﬁenses
to extend to the “special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States,”
and this jurisdiction is deﬁned to include all civil aircraft, military
aircraft and other aircraft within the United States while in ﬂight.
PL. 91—449, 84 Stat. 921. This legislation was enacted 'to implement
the Tokyo Convention (TIAS 6768) ,' Article 3 of which states that
each party to the Convention is competent to exercise criminal
jurisdiction over acts on board aircraft over its territory and should
take necessary steps to establishthat jurisdiction. The recent legis-
lation, accordingly, extends jurisdiction in hijacking and similar caSes
to any aircraft in United States’ airspace. Obviously there has not
been an opportunity for a court test on the validity of this extension
of jurisdiction, but in light of Missouri v. Holland, 252 US. 416 (1920),
it seems likely to be upheld as a valid" implementation of the treaty
power. S. 78, however, is far removed from the purpose of the Tokyo

Convention and seems too unrelated to be considered an implementa—
tion of 1t. . . '

Other than the Convention and PL. 91—4449, the federal government
has never asserted general Criminal jurisdiction over acts committed
on aircraft. It has, of course, undertaken to regulate air safety,
register aircraft and certify airmen, but this is based on the need to
provide safety in interstate air commerce, not on federal ownership
of navigable airspace. Cf. Braniﬁ Airways, Inc. v. Nebraska Board,
347 US. 590, 596 (1954:). It is doubtful that the conduct covered by
this bill relates sufﬁciently to air safety to warrant the assertion of
criminal jurisdiction. .

Since Congress has not asserted such general criminal jurisdiction,

there has been no opportunity for a determination as to whether it
might constitutionally do so. But it is difﬁcult to see what legitimate
federal power might be involved, for example, in making it a federal
crime for the owner'of a large ranch t-o shoot 1')re(‘lators on his property
from. aircraft ﬂying solely over his property. Yet the bill purports to
reach such conduct; ‘
. The provision of the bill providing for the revocation of the cer—
tificate of an airman convicted. of using a plane for hmiting in violation
of the bill depends on the power of Congress to prohibit fainting from
aircraft. If the criminal provision is beyond that power, there could
be no conviction for a violation and hence no basis for revocation
action. ‘ .

The Department of Justice recommends against enactment of this
legislation. ' '

no objection to the submission of this report from the standpoint of the

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY or TRANSPORTATION,
Washington, D.C., May 17, 1971.
Hon. WARREN G. MAGNUSON,
Chairman, Committee on Commerce,
US. Senate, Washington, DC.

DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: Your Committee has asked for the views of
the Department concerning 8. 1563, a bill ‘ .

To amend the Fish and WildlifeAct of 1956 to provide a
criminal penalty for shooting at certaln birds, ﬁsh, and
other animals from an aircraft.

This bill would add a new section 12 to the Fish and Wildlife Act
of 1956. Under new section 12(a), shooting or harassing an animal from
an aircraft, or knowingly participating in either act, would be a
crime punishable by a $5,000 ﬁne, or one year in prison, or both.
New section 12(b) would except persons who administer or protect
land, water or wildlife, and would require States to report to the
Department of the Interior as to licenses issued to persons who are
excepted. New section 12 would be effective on the 30th day after
enactment of the legislation. With respect to sections 1 and 3 of S.
1563, the Department of Transportation defers to the views of the
Departments of Justice and Interior. ,

The bill also would amend section 609 of the Federal Aviation Act
of 1958 to authorize the Administrator to amend, modify, suspend or
revoke the airman certiﬁcate of a person convicted of a violation of
new section 12(a) of the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956. The Depart—
ment of Transportation recommends againsttlie enactment .of section
2 of S. 1563. . . ,

The Department of Transportation shares a growing concern over
the survival of wildlife in this country. Until recently, we all have
shown little concern with the quality of our environment. The exist—
ence of man. has terminated hundreds of species of wildlife, and many
others are threatened. Although today, hunting and ﬁshing are sport
for many Americans, we doubt that any of us needs to add the air-
craft to the arsenal of weapons we use for hunting. As experts in
transportation who are concerned with the quality of our ecology, we
endorse the basic purpose of the legislation. But, we also recognize
that matters involving the preservation of our, ﬁsh and wildlife are not
within our expertise. Therefore, as to sections 1 and 3 of this bill, we
defer to the views of the Departments of Interior and Justice.

This is not the case as to section 2 of this bill, which would, in
effect, use the aviation safety regulatory and enforcement mecha—
nisms in Title VI of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to supplement
the criminal sanctions of another, wholly unrelated bodyof law. In
Senate Report N 0. 91—1482, a similar provision is discussed: “Hunt—
ing from aircraft or discharging ﬁrearms from aircraft and harassing
and chasing wildlife at low altitudes would certainly produce a safety
hazard.” The Department of Transportation has no information to
support the conclusion that hunting from aircraft automatically and
in every instance compromises aviation safety or that this activity
is a general safety hazard.

If we ﬁnd that this activity endangers aviation safety, then existing
regulations would apply. Existing regulations provide:

 




 

L3

§ 91.9 Careless or reckless operation.
N 0 person may operate an aircraft in a careless or reckless
manner so as to endanger the life or property of another.

Thus, should these actions endanger persons or property on the
ground, the Department now can initiate enforcement action under
existing regulations. Accordingly, the Department believes that sec—
tion 2 of S. 1563 is unnecessary to provide for any aviation safety
problem that might arise from the activity that proposed section
12(a) would prohibit.

The Ofﬁce of Management and Budget advises that from the stand—
point of the Administration’s program there is no objection to the
submission of this report to the Committee.

Sincerely,
J. THOMAS TIDD,
Acting General Counsel.

DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: As you asked, here is our report on S. 78,.
a bill “To amend the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956 to provide a
criminal penalty for shooting at certain birds, ﬁsh, and other animals.
from an aircraft.” ‘

S. 78 would amend the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956, as amended
(16 U.S.C. 742a) by adding a new section which establishes a criminal
penalty for shooting from an aircraft at any bird, ﬁsh or other anlmal.
Section 12(b) exempts State and Federal employees whlle dischargmg
Ofﬁcial duties in the administration or protection of land, water, or
wildlife. This new section should be renumbered as Section 13 Since
the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956 already has a Sectlon 12. .

All States now prohibit the shooting of game anlmals from alrcraft,
and many States include nongame animals also. State laws on these
matters generally apply to the National Forest and .other lands
administered by this Department. We believe that the lulhng of wlld
animals for sport or bounty from aircraft should be proh1b1ted nation—
Wide On Federal, State, and private lands. . .

While we fully appreciate the need for control of shooting from
aircraft, we believe it could be'better achieved by the enactment. of
uniform State laws. This would avoid disruption of the authority
and established procedures of the many States who already effect1vely
prohibit the shooting of both game and nongame spec1es from alr-
craft. This is in accord with this Department’s longtlme View that
the States have the general responsibility to protect, regulate and
control wildlife and ﬁsh. . . ' .

The Ofﬁce of Management‘and Budget adv1ses that thereols no
Objection to the presentatiOn of this report from the standpomt of
the Administration’s program.

AMENDMENT, SUSPENSION, AND REVOCATiON OF CERTIFICATES

 

PROCEDURE

SEC. 609. (a) The Administrator may, from time to time, reinspect
any civil aircraft, aircraft, engine, propeller, appliance, air navigation
facility, or air agency, or may reexamine any civil airman. If, as a
result of any such reinspection or reexamination, or if, as a result of
any other investigation made by the Administrator, he determines.
that safety in air commerce or air transportation and the public
interest requires, the Administrator may issue an order amending,
modifying, suspending, or revoking, in whole or in part, any type-
certiﬁcate, production certiﬁcate, airworthiness certiﬁcate, airman
certiﬁcate, air carrier operating certiﬁcate, air navigation facility
certiﬁcate, or air agency certiﬁcate. Prior to amending, modifying,
suspending, or revoking any of the foregoing certiﬁcates, the Adminis—
trator shall advise the holder thereof as to any charges or other reasons.
relied upon by the Administrator for his proposed action and, except
in cases of emergency, shall provide the holder of such a certiﬁcate an
opportunity to answer any charges and be heard as to why such
certiﬁcate should not be amended, modiﬁed, suspended, or revoked.
Any person whose certiﬁcate is affected by such an order of the
Administrator under this section may appeal the Administrator’s
order to the Board and the Board may, after notice and hearing,
amend, modify, or reverse the Administrator’s order if it ﬁnds that
safety in air commerce or air transportation and the public interest do
not require affirmation of the Administrator’s order. In the conduct of
its hearings the Board shall not be bound by ﬁndings of fact of the

Administrator. The ﬁling of an appeal with the Board shall stay the
effectiveness of the Administrator’s order unless the Administrator
advises the Board that an emergency exists and safety in air commerce
or air transportation requires the immediate effectiveness of his order,
in which event the order shall remain effective and the Board shall
ﬁnally dispose of the appeal within sixty days after being so advised by
the Administrator. The person substantially affected. by the Board’s
order may obtain iudicial review of said order under the provisions of
section 1006, and the Administrator shall be made a party to such

proceedings.

VIOLATION OF CERTAIN LAWS

(b) The Administrator, in his discretion, may issue an order amending,
modifying, suspending, or revoking any airman certiﬁcate upon conviction
of the holder of such certiﬁcate of any violation of subsection (a) of section

13 of the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956, regarding the use or operation of
an aircraft.

 

 




 

 

SUPPLEMENTAL VIEWS OF MR. STEVENS

I concur with the Committee report generally. However, I believe
many forms of wildlife are seriously endangered by persons utilizing
vehicles other than aircraft. These vehicles include various forms of
motorized transportation traveling on land and in the air.

Congress should act to provide comprehensive protection in this
area, which. includes many forms of transportation, capable of traveling
in interstate commerce. Many of the proscribed hunts take place over
several states. The vehicles themselves are manufactured and sold in
interstate commerce.

Therefore, I would substitute the following language in the ﬁrst

Dear Mrs. Merkley:

Thank you,for your recent letter in which you urge me to support

“‘dsimilar bill has been introduced in the Senate by Senator
"8 would amend the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956 to provide a

criminal penalty for shooting at certain birds, fish and other animals

from an aircraft. This bill has been referred to the Committee on

Commerce, where it will be considered by the Subcommittee which I

chair. Let me assure you that it will receive the attention it

deserves. The threat which aerial hunting poses to this Nation's

vanishing wildlife is an urgent matter.

I appreciate your taking the time to write and share your
concern with me.

10incerely yours,

PHILI A. HART, Chairman

On this one I am with you and have joined Senator Case in
introducing a resolution requiring specific Congressional
approval of plans to build the pipeline. In addition, I

joined a number of other Senators and Representatives in
requesting the Secretary of the Interior to delay indefinitely
its construction.

HOpefully these actions - added to your active concern - will
encourage the Secretary to extend his postponement until the
environmental questions can be satisfactorily answered.

Dear Miss Moffitt:

Many thanks for your letter of support for S h3hh, a bill to strengthen
the provisions of the Laboratory Animal Welfare Act. On this one I am
certainly in your corner ~ man's inhumanity to animals has for too long
resulted in needless suffering. Public Law 89-5hh, the original act,
which I supported and for which I worked, was a step forward. Now

we need to take another.

In all hones y, I must tell you that, despite the conviction of many
of us that this is good and necessary legislation, chances for its
assagc in this Congress are dim. We are in recess forgthe campaign
and election period, and when we reconvene on November 16 we will be
faced with a list of tep—priority bills, including a number of appro—
priation bills.

The Subcommittee on Energy, Natural Resources and the Environment,
which I chair, has several important pieces of legislation before

it which also must wait for the 92nd Congress: pesticide legislation,
citizen (class-action) suits, technology assessment, and several fish
and wildlife measures. Hopefully these and the Laboratory Animals
bill will be re—introduced promptly when the 92nd Congress convenes
in January, so that swift action on them can follow.

Mrs. Forbes K. Merkley

5265 Davison Road
Flint, Michigan

Dear Mrs. Merkley:

Many thanks for telling me of your concern over the nomination of
Governor Hickel to be Secretary of the Interior. As a staunch con-
servationist, I can say frankly that I too have been concerned over
certain of his activities and views, and I gave his nomination

very serious thought. However, my position has always been that a
President - any President - is entitled to have as his close
advisors men of his own choosing, absent overriding questions of
integrity and principle.

In the case of Governor Hickel, I satisfied myself that considera—
tions of this kind are not overriding. Also, during the course of
the Interior Committee's hearings, he repeatedly gave assurances
that he would follow the example of Secretary Udall in conservation
matters insofar as he is able. Certainly he has now been warned,
by the length of the hearings and the opposition on the Senate
floor, that his preformance as Secretary is going to be closely
watched.

Therefore, when the Senate voted by 73—16 on January 23 to confirm
Governor Hickel, my vote was cast for confirmation. My reasoning in
reaching this conclusion is set forth in the enclosed excerpt from
the Congressional Record for January 23, when I spoke on the floor
of the Senate during debate on the nomination.

With best wishes,

Sincerely,

Honorable Spessard L. Holland
Chairman

Subcommittee on Agriculture
Senate Appropriations Committee
Washington, D. 0.

Dear Mr. Chairman:

There are three items to which I would like to add this ‘
written word as you meet to mark up the Agriculture Appropriations
bill:

l.h National School Lunch Program.: We have, in Michigan,
some 2800 schools in 650 public school school districts serving
approximately 5&0, 000 lunches per day and about 90 million total
lunches for the year. For the past six years, the total lunches
served has increased over each previous year at about 10 percent
per year. This year, 1966-7, this increase will drop to about 2
percent. This is due, primarily, to increased costs of both labor
and food which have caused a corresponding increase in many schools
of 5 cents per lunch to the children. A reasonable estimate sets
the average increase at about 3 cents per lunch. We believe that
nearly 20,000 of Michigan's children were cut out of the program
merely'because of these price increases. Clearly, a'boost is
needed here to keep the program going. Funds for State Administra-
tion are also desperately needed. ‘

2. Animal Welfare Funds CE.L. 89-5hh): As a member of the
Senate Committee Which authorized this program - and we thought we
had reached.a compromise that essentially met-all concerns. I have
been very distressed.by the lack of funding of this program and am.
particularly puzzled'by the House action. I would urge that the
Senate Committee provide the $1.5 million requested so that we could
get on with this Job which Congress has said should.be done.

 

 




3. erpland Adjustment Program: This is a.program which
has'been very effective in Michigan, We have additional acreage
that could go out of agricultural production and into develoPment
and.conservation of soil and water and into wildlife and recreation
uses without high cost. I would h0pe that the Senate Committee
would provide the full amount - $90 million ~ requested in the 1968
Budget. -

Thank you, Mr. Chairmano

Sincerely,

Indeed I agree with you that this is a most desirable aim, and I
would certainly support any legislation which can bring about the

maximum care and comfort of these animals while at the same time

interfering least with the tremendously important research programs
being carried out.

You were kind to flag this one for me.
With best wishes,

Sincerely,

Dear Mrs. McKenney:

Thank you for your views on the "animal" bills. The
Committee on Commerce recently held hearings on two of
them, 8 2322 and S 3059. Testimony was taken from
members of the scientific community and representatives
of animal protective groups. Obviously there were dif-
ferences of opinion as to the best kind of legislation
to enact, and I was interested to hear all sides. Many
points of View were brought out in the hearings.

As I see it, we must evolve in the Committee a bill that
will give animals every possible protection without

interfering with the important experiments which depend
on them. It will not be easy to arrive at the precise
point where these two principles balance out, but we will

try.

When further action is taken I will of course be writing
you again.

With best wishes,

Sincerely,

J

them.

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Catarenchuc:

Thank you for your views on the "animal" bills.
The Committee on Commerce has devoted an enormous

amount of time and consideration to this legisla-
tion and has scheduled one more day of hearings on
May 25 on the Monroney amendment.

Hopefully, after the testimony on this amendment, we
can get down to the business of developing a bill
that will give animals every possible protection.
Certainly this is what I will continue to work for.

With best wishes,

Dear Mr. Hammett:

Thank you for your thoughtful letter. On June 7,
the Committee on Commerce favorably reported an
amended.hill providing for the humane treatment
of animals, and I hope the Senate will soon act
affirmatively on the legislation.

In my opinion, this is a good bill - the best we
could get in the Circumstances — and I believe it
will do much to improve conditions which we all
deplore.

With best wishes,

Thank you for telling me of your interest in the
"animal" bill. You will be as glad to know as I
am to tell you that on June 22 the Senate passed
its version of HR 15881 by a record vote of 85 to

Now a House-Senate conference committee must meet
to iron out the differences in the two versions of
the bill. My hunch is we will get a good: pill,
