Every year millions of furbearing animals struggle for hours or days in the agonizing grip of the
steel jaw trap. Sometimes they gnaw off their own limbs to escape. Family pets, songbirds and
countless other creatures are also caught and maimed in this archaic, barbaric device which
causes slow death from gangrene unless the affected limb is amputated.

We protest the use of the cruel steel jaw leghold trap and ask that this brutal device be outlawed.
More than ﬁfty countries have banned the leghold trap, and we want our country to prohibit its
use NOW.




 

We the undersigned respectfully petition the Congress of the United States
to pass the Dole bill 8.657 to prevent needless pain for laboratory animals.

Dear Adele Schoepperle;

Here is the petition you sent me. I hope it helps your organization in saving our
wonderful whales. I have also Written letters to the Ambassadors of the country's
who still support commercial whaling. I love these creatures very much and if there

is anything else I can do to help in support of your organization, I would very much

like to be involved. You can write to me at: 140 Allen Street
Hackensack, N.J. 07601

I wish you great success and a happy healthy whale of a New Year!

Best regards,

In.

the senseless sl ughte of whales continues under the pretense that it is being done for research.
However, in actu lity, the carcasses are being sold on the Japanese market for millions of dollars.
We must stop the kiliing of these magnificent mammals. And when we do, we will have demonstrated
our ability to manage the future with intellegence and grace. We must not permit the whales to be
exterminated by the short-term needs of a dying industry. We call upon the human citizens of the
world to stop the destruction of the world's remaining whales. We, the undersigned , demand the

governments of Japan, the Soviet Union, Norway, and all other countries engaged in whaling, to put

an immediate end to the needless massacre in the seas. We urge the government of the United States of
America to enforce the ban on whaling and insist on compliance by all nations.
