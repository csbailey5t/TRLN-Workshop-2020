owner’s agent, or a veterinarian, then such officer, acting in good faith and upon
reasonable belief, may immediately destroy such animal by shooting the animal or

At his option, prosecutor could invoke either
forgery or uttering statutes, but not both, in

Information which tracked language of for-

28. — Sufﬁciency of evidence

Defendant could not be found guilty of forg-
ing three state pay warrants, where although
defendant’s ﬁngerprints and palmprints were
found 0n the warrants, there was no evidence
that the prints had been put there while defend
ant had allegedly signed the warrants. Gaskins .
v. State, App, 347 So.2d 474 (1977). ’

Evidence that, inter alia, defendant forged the
signature of the payee on a check payable to
another party was sufﬁcient to support convic-
tion of forgery. Barry v. State, App, 330 So.2d

Comment (Laws I972, c. 72-724):
Subsection (1), provides two alternate
sentences for capital crimes which
will be mandatory according to the
findings of fact made in a separate
sentencing proceeding. A distinction
between life imprisonment under
subsection (1) and that contemplated
under subsection (4)(a), relating to
life. felonies should be noted. In the
former case, there is a minimum pe—
riod to be served on a life sentence
before eligibility for parole. In the
latter, there is no such minimum but
only a minimum term of years which
must be imposed if life imprisonment
is not the sentence. There is no min-
imum sentence for felonies of the
first degree. Thus, each category
contemplates a descending degree of
severity according to the classifica-
tion of the crime.

22. Review

Appellate review is always available where a
court has imposed an illegal sentence, even if
judgment and sentence have resulted from a
guilty plea. Robbins v. State, App, 413 So.2d
840 (1982).

(1) A person who has been convicted of an offense other than a capital felony may be
sentenced to pay a fine in addition to any punishment described in s. 775.082; when

punishment described in s. 775.082. A person who has been convicted of a noncriminal

violation may be sentenced to pay a fine.
inal violations shall not exceed:

Fines for designated crimes and for noncrim°

(a) $15,000, when the conviction is of a life felony.

an admmistrative agency to impose a penalty
other than imprisonment. Op.Atty.Gen., 079—16.
Feb. 2'7. 1979.

1. Excessive fines

Trial court erred with respect to imposition of
fine in amount of $272,000 against defendant for
possession of methaqualones. Comparato v.
State. App, 419 So.2d 1131 (1982).

Fine of $10,000 and sentence to ten-year pris-
on term for offense of importation of marijuana,
possession of more than 100 lbs. of marijuana.
and possession of marijuana with intent to sell
were excessive and would be reversed. Carvajal
v. State. App, 392 So.2d 287 (1980).

Following convictions of criminal conspiracy to
possess more than one hundred pounds of canna-
bis with intent to sell or deliver, possession of

“more 'than‘one' hundred pounds 'of 'cannabiswitl'r'"

intent to sell or deliver, and importation of con-
trolled substance, it was error for trial court to
impose ﬁne exceeding aggregate amount of $20,-
000 and. on remand, court could impose separate

fines not exceeding $5,000 for two offenses and
fine not exceeding $10,000 for remaining of-
fense. Arbuckle v. State, App.. 379 So.2d 134
(1979). .

1.8. Indigents

That defendant was indigent did not preclude
imposition of fine as part of sentence, in view of
fact that a defendant is not without recourse if
he is unable to pay fine promptly. Nash v.
State. App. 2 Dist., 434 So.2d 33 (1983) review
denied 438 So.2d 833.

1.9. Parole and probation

Where defendant served, as a condition of
probation, period of incarceration which was
maximum term of incarceration prescribed for
offense of second-degree misdemeanor of tres-
pass in a structure, court could not sentence him
to a term of incarceration any greater than that
already served should defendant violate his pro-
bation; however, court could properly require
payment of a fine which it could have imposed in
addition to the incarceration. Smith v. State,
App. 1 Dist., 448 So.2d 20 (1984) approved 484
So.2d 581.

 

Payment of a fine renders a case moot so as to
preclude any review of an attack upon such a
conviction. Curtis v. State, App.. 350 So.2d 1142
(1977).

775.0835. Fines; surcharges; Crimes Compensation Trust Fund

(1) When any person pleads guilty or nolo contendere to, or is convicted of, any felony
or misdemeanor under the laws of this state which resulted in the injury or death of

another person, the court may, if it finds that the defendant has the present ability to pay~ _

the fine and finds that the impact of the fine upon the defendant’s dependents will not
cause such dependents to be dependent on public welfare, in addition to any other penalty,
order the defendant to pay a fine, commensurate with the offense committed and with the
probable impact upon the victim, but not to exceed $10,000. The fine shall be depomted 1n

the Crimes Compensation Trust Fund.

(2) In addition to any fine, civil penalty, or other penalty provided by statute, ordinance,
or other law, there shall be imposed, levied, and collected by the courts of this state the
5-percent surcharge on all fines, civil penalties, and forfeitures, as established and created
in s. 960.25, which surcharge shall be deposited in the Crimes Compensation Trust Fund

created by s. 960.21.

(3) The additional $20 obligation created by s. 960.20 shall be collected, and $19 of each
$20 collected shall be credited to the Crimes Compensation Trust Fund, prior to any fine

or surcharge authorized by this chapter.

Laws 1971, c. 71—1256, § 5. .

This section, as it appeared In

“(1) Unless otherwise specifically

In general
Assessment of fine against defendant convict-
ed of conspiracy to traffick in cannabis and
attempted trafficking in cannabis. pursuant to
this section allowing Optional fine for crimes

defendant was convicted of felonies which did
not result in injury or death of another person.
Easterly v. State, App.2Dist., 445 So.2d 1110
(1984) review denied 462 So.2d 1106.

Where defendant was convicted of a felony
which did not result in personal injury or death
of another person, court was not authorized un-
der this section to order optional fine payable to
Crimes Compensation Trust Fund. King v.
State, App. 2 Dist., 445 So.2d 1108 (1984).

Because defendant had been adjudged insol-
vent, trial court erred in ordering him to pay

costs of ten dollars to crimes compensation trust
fund and two dollars to law enforcement train-
ing and correctional officer training trust funds;
in addition, because offenses to which defendant
pleaded nolo contendere did not result in inj

or death, it was error to impose ten dollar fine
under this section providing for such payment

under certain circumstances when injury or
death results from crime. Pass v. State, App. 2
Dist... 429 So.2d 1349 (1983).

Defendant’s plea of nolo contendere to a
charge of possession of a controlled substance
was a plea to a felony which did not result in
personal injury or death of another person so
that court was not authorized to impose fine
payable to the crimes compensation trust fund.
Moore v. State. App, 422 So.2d 1069 (1982).

The 5 per cent surcharge on bail bonds, fines,
and civil penalties prescribed by law, imposed in
Laws 1977, c. 77—452 (this section and § 960.25)
can be ﬁived by the courts if it is deemed by
the court to impose a severe financial hardship.
Op.Atty.Gen., 078—4, Jan. 10, 1978.

The amendments to §§ 142.01 and 142.03, by
Laws 1977. c. 77452, operate to exclude from
the fine and forfeiture fund only those additional
fines imposed under § 775.083(3), which fines
are required by Laws 1977, c. 77—452, § 3, (this
section), to be deposited in the crimes compensa-

1. Validity

 

Habitualeffendersmmperseded
by sentencing guidelines and is no longer viable.
Harvey v. State, App. 5 Dist, 497 So.2d 996
(1986).

This section governing procedure for deter-
mining whether extended sentence should be
imposed on habitual offender facially satisfies
due process requirements. Adams v. State,
App, 376 So.2d 47 (1979).

2. Construction and application

 

This section does not manda'. or authorize-the
reclassification of offenses; omy the imposition
of sentences which exceed normal statutory
maximum are authorized. Cuthbert v. State,
App. 1 Dist, 459 So.2d 1098 (1984) review denied
467 So.2d 1000.

4. Purpose

Purpose of this section is to allow enhanced
penalties for those defendants who meet objec-
tive guidelines indicating recidivism; enhanced
punishment is only incident to the last offense.
Eutsey v. State, 383 So.2d 219 (1980).

4.5. Due process

Habitual offender proceedings were not re-
quired under due process to include full panoply
of rights afforded a criminal during his trial as
to guilt, and procedural safeguards afforded de-
fendant under this section were adequate :lf‘fl in
accordance with due process requirements. Eut-
sey v. State, 383 So.2d 219 (1980).

5. Previous convictions—In general
Findings, after prosecution for attempted burs
glary of dwelling, that defendant committed in—
stant offense less than one month after release
from prison, was sufficient justification for sen-
tencing of defendant to extended term for pro-

(b) This Code section does not apply to the killing of animals raised
for the purpose of providing food nor does it apply to any person who
hunts wild animals in compliance with the game and fish laws of this
state. The killing or injuring of an animal for humane purposes or in the
furtherance of medical or scientiﬁc research is justiﬁable. (Code 1933,

§ 27-5-6.

JUDICIAL

Dogfighting provision constitutional.
— While this section makes it a misde-
meanor for anyone to subject any animal
to cruel treatment, § 16-12-37 ($5,000.00
ﬁne, with optional year in prison, for dog-
fighting) does not violate equal protection,
because the legislature acted within its dis-
cretion in mandating that those who par-
ticipate in a dogﬁght organization for
sport or gaming purposes should be dealt
with more harshly. Hargrove v. State, 253
Ga. 450, 321 S.E.2d 104 (1984).

Section does not limit offense to killing
animals; it is enough to cause them unjus-
tifiable suffering. Smith v. State, 160 Ga.
App.“ 26, 285 S.E.2d 749 (1981).

Malice and intent are not elements of
the offense of cruelty to animals. Miller v.
State, 179 Ga. App. 217, 345 S.E.2d 909
(1986)

Wilfulness is not an element of the of-
fense of cruelty to animals. Miller v. State,
179 Ga. App. 217, 345 S.E.2d 909 (1986).

DECISIONS

Motive for infliction of injury and issue
of justiﬁcation is for jury consideration.
—— Motive of defendant in inflicting injury
upon animal, and whether same wasjusti-
ﬁable under circumstances, are generally
questions for solution by jury. Rushin v.

-~ State, 154 Ga. App. 41, 267 S.E.2d 4.73

animal was, under circumstances, justifi-

cruelty to a gamecock therefore is pm
scribed conduct. Brackett v. State, 142 L33.

by this section. Brackett v. State, 14?! Ga.

Indictment substantially in words of stat-

was incorrectly designated as a misdemeanor
instead of a felony. State v. Farnsworth, 51
Idaho 768, 10 P.2d 295(1932).

Intent.

To constitute malice, it is not necessary
that defendants know owner of animals.
State v. Farnsworth, 51 Idaho 768, 10 P.2d
295 (1932).

Motive.

State does not need to prove that there was
a motive or what the motive was. State v.
Farnsworth, 51 Idaho 768, 10 P.2d 295

Sentence.

Under this section, sentence is within the

abuse the appellate court will not interfere.

1. In general

Allegation that plaintiff association of breeders

and fanciers of gamefowl owned “animals" within
scope, meaning, intent and application of prohibi-
, tions in Humane Care for Animals Act (1,! 701 et
seq. of this chapter) and that ownership raised
threat of potential criminal prosecution was sufﬁ-
cient to entitle plaintiff to challenge constitutional-
ity of Act by bringing a declaratory judgment

Association of breeders and fanciers of game-
fowl demonstrated a sufficient interest to maintain
action to declare provisions of Humane Care for
Animals Act (11 701 et seq. of this chapter) un-
constitutional by alleging that association owned
gamefowl which were, admittedly, “animals"
within prohibitions of Act. Id.

the animal in a facility which will provide the elements of good care as set forth in
Section 3 of this Act,2 where such animals shall be examined by a licensed
veterinarian.

(b) A notice of impoundment shall be given by the humane investigator to the

notice shall be retained by the humane investigator and a copy forwarded immediate-
ly to the Department. The notice of impoundment shall include the following:

ment. If the hearing cannot be held prior to the expiration of the 7-day impound-
ment period, the Department shall notify the humane society that it cannot sell, offer
for adoption or dispose of the animal or animals until a final decision is rendered and
all of the appeal processes have expired.

ed and must be discharged before the animal is released from the facility. When the
animal is not claimed by its owner and all impoundment costs satisfied within 7 days.
it may be sold at public or private sale for fair consideration to a person capable of
providing care consistent with this Act, with the proceeds of that sale applied first to
discharge the lien and any balance to be paid over to the owner. If no purchaser is
found, the animal may be offered for adoption or disposed of in a manner not
inconsistent with this or any other Act.

Law Review and Other Commentaries

Legislation 1979, David J. Heinemann, 48
J.B.A.K. 121 (1979).

§ 21-4310. Cruelty to Animals

(a) Intentionally killing, injuring, maiming, torturing or mutilat-
ing any animal;

(b) abandoning or leaving any animal in any place without making
provisions for its proper care; or

(c) having physical custody of any animal and failing to provide
such food, potable water, protection from the elements, opportunity
for exercise and other care as is needed for the health or well-being of
such kind of animal.

(2) The provisions of this section shall not apply to:
(a) Normal or accepted veterinary practices;
(b) bona fide experiments carried on by commonly recognized

WWJesearch facilities;

(c) killing, attempting to kill, trapping, catching or taking of any

(e) the humane killing of an animal which is diseased or disabled

such owner residing outside of a city or the owner thereof within a
city if no animal shelter, pound or licensed veterinarian is within the

ch. 157, § 1; July 1.]

PROHIBITED CONDUCT Art. 43

AUTHORS” COMMENTS

The 1974 amendment achieved two changes. First, it added veteri-
narians, animal shelters or other appropriate facilities to the list of
persons or agencies authorized to take charge of abandoned or diseased
or disabled animals. Second, it clariﬁed the authority of those persons in
such cases to take action with respect to such animals, and added those

animals clearly showing evidence Of cruel neglect to those which may be»

taken.

:""-The 1975 amendment added the penalty clause, inadvertently omitted
in the original section and 1974 amendment.

The 1977 amendment substantially expands and clarifies conduct
which falls within the statute, and further expands and clariﬁes the
conduct to which the statute expressly does not apply.

This section was twice amended in 1980. The first amendment added
local or state health ofﬁcers to the list of those excluded from operation
of the statute in the case of humane killing of animals under subsection
(2)(e). The second amendment deleted former, section (l)(b), which was
vague and ambiguous.

dant had been discharged from probation or
parole for the felonies for which he was last
convicted, since each element of the offense
prescribed by the legislature is equally essen-
tial to support a conviction. Newton v.
Commonwealth, 558 S.W.2d 167 (Ky. 1977).

30. —Appeal.

Where a defendant who was convicted and
sentenced under the habitual criminal law
attacked the act on the ground that it' was
unconstitutional, his remedy was by appeal
from his conviction rather than by a petition
for habeas corpus. Hampton v. Whaley, 313
Ky. 611, 233 S.W.2d 273 (1950).

Under former habitual criminal law, one
convicted as a habitual criminal who did not
raise the issue on direct appeal could not
thereafter base a collateral attack on that con-
viction upon an assertion that one of the prior
convictions upon which the habitual criminal
conviction was based was void. Canary v.
Bland, 583 F.2d 887 (6th Cir. 1978).

31. Sentence.

Where defendant was convicted of aiding
and abetting armed robbery and of being an
habitual offender, the trial court erred in
imposing sentence for the principal conviction
in addition to the habitual offender conviction
since only the penalty prescribed by the habit-
ual criminal statute could be imposed.

KENTUCKY PENAL CODE

480

Newcomb v. Commonwealth, 531 S.W.2d 489
(Ky. Ct. App. 1975).

Rules for the sentencing of an habitual
criminal fell within the province of the leg-
islature and the state was largely free to
determine the amount of time that the
recidivist would be isolated from society; thus,
defendant’s life imprisonment following his
third felony conviction as mandated by the
former recidivist statute was not so
disproportionate as to be cruel and unusual
punishment where defendant had been
convicted of detaining a female against her
will with the intent to have carnal knowledge,
robbery and uttering a forged instrument
while on probation for the robbery conviction.
Hayes v. Bordenkircher, 621 F.2d 846 (6th
Cir. 1980).

‘32. Double Jeopardy.

Inasmuch as the former habitual criminal
statute did not establish an independent crim-
inal offense, but rather deﬁned a status and
thereby served to enhance punishment for a
crime committed by a person who was an
habitual criminal, a defendant was not sub-
jected to double jeopardy where the same prior
felony convictions were twice used to enhance
his punishment as an habitual criminal.
Montgomery v. Bordenkircher, 620 F.2d 127
(6th Cir.), cert. denied, 449 US. 857, 101 S.
Ct. 155, 66 L. Ed. 2d 71 (1980).

Regardless of title to land itself. when-

2. Purpose of law

Acts 1912, No. 36, which made it a crime
to “desecrate, injure, deface, mutilate, or
destroy, any grave, tomb or monument
erected to the dead,” was aimed exclusively
at misdeeds of vandals and ghouls and
could not have been made to cover the acts
of persons proceeding within their lawful
and contract rights. Reichelt v. St. Vin-
cent’s De Paul Cemetery Ass’n, 1913, 10
Orleans App. 100.

3. - Abandoned cemeteries

Mere fact that abandoned cemetery was
within a legally dedicated subdivision of
town, would not justify town in disinterring
bodies and burying them in another ceme-
tery. Op.Atty.Gen., 1948—50, p. 68.

Amended by Acts 1982, No. 431, § 1.

Reporter’s. Comment

Louisiana statutes covered:
R.S.1870, § 815; Acts 1916. No. 209, § 1;

1926, No. 313, § 1 (maliciously killing do-

mestic animals).
R.S.1870, § 816; Acts 1879, No. 24, § 1
(beating, maiming or mistreating animals).
Acts 1880, No. 44 (cruelty to animals).

Interference with property rights:

The question of whether such a statute
interferes with the private rights of proper.
ty and the liberty of enjoying ownership
was decided in the case of State v. Karsteno
diek, 49 La.An.n. 1621, 22 So. 845 (1897),
wherein the Supreme Court of Louisiana
said that animals have rights, which, like
those of human beings, are to be protected.
And that a horse, under its master’s hands,
stands in a relation to the master analogous
to that of a child to a parent.

Then an individual should not use his
property in such a manner as to annoy his
neighbors, and thus if his treatment of his
animals is so inhuman as to shock the sensi-

bilities of his neighbors, it is within the
legislative power to regulate such treat-
ment. See Comm. v. Higgins, 277 Mass.
191, 178 NE. 536, (1931). Thus it has been
held that such a statute is in the interest of
public morals. It is directed against acts
which may be thought to have a tendency to
dull humanitarian feelings and to corrupt
the morals of those who observe or who
have knowledge of those acts. See Comm.
'v. Higgins, supra.

Acts 1938, No. 51, prohibited the distribu-
tion of poison in a place accessible to dogs,
and ﬁxed a penalty for a violation of its
provisions. This act has not been incorpo-
rated in the 1950 revision, because super~
seded by R.S. 14:102.

Acts 1942, No. 352, § 1, has not been
incorporated in the 1950 revision. This Act
prohibited the distribution of poison in a
place accessible to domestic animals. The
act also prescribed a penalty for violation of
its provisions. This act has been supersed—
ed by R.S. 14:102.

History and Source of Law

Source: ,

Acts 1942, No. 43, § 1, Art. 102.

The 1982 amendment rewrote the section,
which previously read:

:‘Cruelty to animals is the intentional or
criminally negligent mistreatment of any
animal by any act, or omission whereby
unjustifiable physical pain, suffering or
death is caused to or permitted upon said
animal.

“.‘Whoever commits the crime of cruelty to
animals shall be fined not more than one

hundred dollars, or imprisOned for not more
than ninety days, or both.”

The 1982 amendment also changed the
section heading from “Cruelty to animals”
to “Definitions”. In the section heading, “;
cruelty to animals” was added on authority
of RS. 24:253. On the same authority, in
the introductory paragraph, “RS. 14:102.4”
was substituted for “RS. 14:102.5”.

Acts 1982, No. 431, § 1 also enacted R.S.
14:102.1 to 14:102.4. ‘

1983 Amendment

Acts 198.}, [st E.r.Sess., No. 6’. § 1 enacted a new RS.
14:10].1(C) and § 2 of that ‘Act repealed RS. [4:102:2(67).
There was, however, no RS. 14:101.1(A) or (B), and, according-
ly, the “enacted” section was treated as a remedial amend—
ment to RS. 14:102.1(C) on authority of RS. 24:253. The
second sentence of 14:102.1(C) was redesignated as subsec. D
of that section and contained the same language as the
subsec. D enacted by Acts 1982, N0. 431, § 1.

History and Source of Law

Prior to the enactment of this section by
Acts 1982, No. 431, § 1, the general subject
matter of this section was found under RS.
14:102. .,

On authority of RS. 24:253, subsection
designation D was added and a comma was
added following “mutilates” in par. A(?.) of
this section as enacted by Acts 1982, No.
431. '

In this section as enacted in 1982. the
phrase “, herding or domestic animals," in
subsec. C was amended into Senate Bill 180,
1982 Regular Session (which became Acts
1982, No. 431) by the House Committee on
the Administration of Criminal Justice at its
meeting on June 24, 1982. A review of the
transcript of the committee minutes indi-

cates that the intention was to exclude the
herding of cattle, hogs, or other domestic
animals from the provisions of Senate Bill
180.

The 1983 amendment in subsec. C, substi-
tuted “RS. 1421021” for “This Section”,
substituted “herding of” for “herding or”,
and added a second sentence which read:
“For purposes of this Section, fowl shall not
be defined as animals.” On authority of
RS. 24:253, “This Section" was substituted
for “RS. 14:102.1”, a comma was added
following “practices”, and the second sen-
tence was redesignated as subsec. D. Sub—
sec. D, as redesignated, contained the same
language as subsec. D as enacted by Acts
1982, No. 431, § 1.

The offense denounced by Acts 1870, Ex.

animal, the property of another, with intent
to steal, and was distinct from larceny, and
was not dependent on the value or the as-

§ 102.2. Seizure and disposition of animals cruelly treated

A. When a person is charged with cruelty to animals, said person's
animal may be seized by the arresting officer and held pending final
disposition of the. charge. The seizing officer shall appoint a licensed
veterinarian or other suitable custodian to care for any such animal.
The custodian shall retain custody of the animal for the purpose of
evidence upon the trial, subject to the order of the court. All costs
incurred in‘ the boarding and treatment for any seized animal pending
disposition of any animal cruelty charge, upon conviction of the accused,
shall be borne by the person so convicted. If a seized animal is unable to
humanely survive the final disposition of the animal cruelty charge, the
court may order that such animal be humanely put to death, but only
upon the certification of a licensed veterinarian either that the animal is
‘not likely to survive or that in his professional judgment, by reason of
the physical condition of the animal, it should be humanely euthanized.
The owner of an animal which is euthanized without an order of the
court upon certification of a licensed veterinarian, as herein provided,
shall have a right of action for damages against the department or
agency by which the arresting or seizing officer is employed.

B. Upon a person’s conviction of cruelty to animals, it shall be proper
for the court, in its discretion, to order the forfeiture and final determi—
nation of the custody of any animal found to be cruelly treated as part of
the sentence. In the event of the acquittal or final discharge, without
conviction of the accused, the court shall, on demand, direct the delivery
of any animal held in custody to the owner thereof.

§ 102.3. Search warrant; animal cruelty offenses

If the complaint is made, by affidavit, to any magistrate authorized to
issue search warrants in criminal cases, that the complainant has reason
to believe that an animal has been or is being cruelly treated in violation
of RS. 1421021, in any building or place, such magistrate, if satisfied
that there is reasonable cause for such belief, shall issue a search
warrant to any law enforcement officer authorized by law to make
arrests for such offenses,» authorizing any such officer to make. a search
of said building or place, and to arrest any person found violating RS.
1421021. Said warrant may also authorize said officer to seize any
animal believed to be cruelly treated and to take custody thereof. This

Notes of Decisions

1. In general

Conviction for aggravated criminal damage to
property and unjustifiably killing animal was
supported by sufﬁcient evidence, including evi-
dence of motive and opportunity, and defend-
ant’s statements. State v. Ortlepp, 1985, 363

 

1986. Section 3 of Laws 1986, c. 444, provides N.W.2d 39.

343.22. Investigation of cruelty complaints

Subdivision 1. Reporting. Any person who has reason to believe that a violation of
this chapter 343 has taken place or is taking place may apply to any court having
jurisdiction over actions alleging violation of that section for a warrant and for investiga-
tion. The court shall examine under oath the person so applying and any witnesses the
applicant produces and the court shall take their affidavits in writing. The affidavits
must set forth facts tending to establish the grounds for believing a violation of this
chapter 343 has occurred or is occurring, or probable cause to believe that a violation
exists. If the court is satisfied of the existence of the grounds of the application, or that
there is probable cause to believe a violation exists, it shall issue a signed search warrant
and order for investigation to a peace officer in the county. The order shall command the
officer to proceed promptly to the location of the alleged violation, along with a doctor of
veterinary medicine.

Subd. 2. Police investigation. The peace officer shall search the place designated in
the warrant and, together with the veterinary doctor, shall conduct an investigation of the
facts surrounding the alleged violation. The peace officer may retain in custody, subject
to the order of the court, any property or things which are specified in the warrant,
including any animal if the warrant so specifies. The warrant shall contain the names of
the persons presenting affidavits in support of the application and the grounds for its
issuance. Service shall be made in accordance with the provisions of sections 626.13,
626.14, and 626.16. The warrant must be executed and returned to the court which issued
the warrant within ten days after its date; after the expiration of that time the warrant,
unless executed, is void. The officer executing the warrant shall promptly return the
Warrant to the court, and deliver to it a written inventory of the property or things taken,
Verified by the certificate of the officer. The warrant and order for investigation issued
pursuant to this section and section 343.23 shall have the same force as a warrant issued

{pursuant to chapter 626.

Subd. 3. Disposal of certain animals. Upon a proper determination by a licensed

doctor of veterinary medicine, any animal taken into custody pursuant to this section may

he immediately disposed of when the animal is suffering and is beyond cure through

:Easonablev care, and treatment.

Editor’s Note-— '

Ch. 471, Laws, 1981, as part of a continuing overall legislative design to replace justice of the

ace courts with justice courts and justices of the peace with justice court judges, amended
numerous sections of the Mississippi Code of 1972 affecting justices of the peace and justice of
the peace courts. Although ch. 471 did not speciﬁcally amend this section, attention is directed
to Miss. Constn., § 171, amended 1975, which provides, inter alia, that "All reference in the
Mississippi Code to justice of the peace shall mean justice court judge. ” - .. . ,

SectiOn 15 of Chapter 491, Laws 1981, provides as follows:

SECTION 15. Prosecutions, convictions and penalties for violations which occurred prior to
the effective date of this act under laws amended or repealed by this act, or suspensions or

denials of driver’s licenses or permits made pursuant to laws amended or repealed by this act,

shall not be affected or abated by the provisons of this act.

Ch. 560 FINES § 560.016

Any imposition of fines is also governed by the provisions
of § 560.026.

Subsection 1(2) places an upper limit on the amount of the
“gain” fine for an individual. See 28 U.S.C.A. ~§ 201(e) which
contains a similar limit in bribery cases.

560.0 1 6. Fines for misdemeanors and infractions

1. Except as otherwise provided for an offense outside this
code, a person who has been convicted of a misdemeanor or in-
fraction may be sentenced to pay a fine which does not exceed:

-

(1) For a class A misdemeanor ' . 2 x .;
(2) For a class B misdemeanor, 1ve un o r

d (3) For a class C misdemeanor, three hundred dollars;
(4) For an infraction, two hundred dollars.

2. In lieu of a fine imposed under subsection 1, a person who
has been convicted of a misdemeanor or infraction through
which he derived “gain” as defined in section 560.011, may be
sentenced. to a fine which does not exceed double the amount of
gain from the commission of the offense. An individual offend-
er may be fined not more than twenty thousand dollars under
this provision. '

.(L.1977, S.B.No._60, p. 662, § 1, eff. Jan. 1, 1979.)

Comment to 1973 Proposed Code

The dollar limits for Class A and B Misdemeanors are con-
sistent with the usual limits fixed in misdemeanor statutes
that remain outside the Code. When the authorized imprison-
ment is one year, the maximum authorized fine is usually $1,-
000; when the maximum imprisonment is six months, the
. maximum fine is often $500.

Subsection 2 may be useful for the misdemeanors and in-
~fractions for which fines are most apt to be used—the eco-
nomic offenses.

ain'; la, urn-non unie "
Cruelty to Animals Act, that the
marshal was not guilty of violating
that act, was supported by the evi-
dence. Society for Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals v. Whitney, 84
N.J.L. 136, 86 A. 61 (1913).

In this case the Supreme Court
said: “The court of common pleas on
hearing the evidence found that de-
fendant had not been guilty of cruel-
ty as charged. He was a borough
marshal, and stopped a dog fight in
the street by shooting and wounding
one of the dogs. The complaint was
for thus shooting the dog. On the
hearing of the appeal, the evidence
was directed to showing that after
the dog was wounded defendant had
been requested to shoot him again
and kill him, and declined, thereby
inﬂicting needless pain on the dog.
It appeared, however, that the dog
had recovered after being attended by
a veterinary. It was quite compe-
tent for the court to find on this evi-
dence that the defendant did not (to
quote the pertinent words of the
act) torture, torment, cruelly beat or
abuse, or needlessly mutilate the ani-
mal. His act in shooting one dog
was reasonably ascribable to a de—
sire to prevent unnecessary suffer-
ing to the others involved in the
fight; and his refusal afterwards to
kill the dog, if provable under the
complaint, was fully justified by the
recovery of the dog.”

Assembly Economic Development and Agriculture Committee Statement
Assembly, No. 412—L. 1986, c. 89

This bill authorizes and specifies the conditions under which receivers
may be appointed for animal pounds and shelters by the courts. Presently,
if an owner or operator of a pound or shelter is arrested for cruelty to
animals, there are no provisions for the interim care of these animals. As a
result, the animals are often left in the care of the person already suspected
of cruelty. The bill protects the animals by permitting a court to appoint a
receiver to operate the animal facility following the arrest. The court is
required, however, to hold a hearing giving the operator the opportunity to
contest the initial imposition of the receivership unless the court finds that
immediate and irreparable harm may occur to the animals.

Once the receivership is imposed, the court may, upon a ﬁnding that the
conditions that led to the original charge have been abated, terminate the
receivership, subject to any conditions it deems necessary to prevent a
recurrence.

The ' committee amended the bill to modify procedures regarding the
receiverships as follows: a

1. The petition to put the animal shelter under receivership may be ﬁled
. only by the person making the arrest or by officers and agents of the New
" Jersey Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals other than the one
:- who made the arrest. Previously, the bill also permitted members of the
" Q society other than the one who made the arrest to file the petition.

2. The petitioner is required to serve a copy of the petition to the owner
or operator in addition to serving it to the Department of Health and the
local board of health as previously required.

3. The receiver is held liable for any costs of the receivership which
result from the gross negligence, incompetence, or intentional misconduct of
the receiver.

The other amendments are technical in nature.

5. Sick animals . ._ ,
In prosecution for violating this sec‘
tion, the evidence in the record was suf-
ficient to support the conclusion that
limping horse, used ‘to pull a hansom
cab, was not given proper medical atten-
tion to alleviate its- pain. People v.
O'Rourke, 1975, 83- Misc.2d 175, 36.9
N.Y.S.2d 335, motion denied 83 Misc.2d
51, 371 N.Y.S.2d 603. ,
Permitting a limping horse to continue
to work without supplying necessary
medical attention constitutes “neglect”
1 under this section. Id. 2 -

Owner of horse used to pull a hansom
cab was obligated, upon receiving ”notice
of the horse’s lameness, to call a veteri-
narian in order that the horse "might
receive proper medical attention. ' 1d.

Defendant’s guilt of failing to provide
proper sustenance to an animal was
proven beyond a reasonable doubt, since,
regardless of the possible culpability of
the owners of gelding in question, it was
clearly established that defendant was in

charge of feeding the gelding fer the '

three months prior to its demise, that he
was aware-of its loss of weight,‘and that
he gave it back to its Owners in such'a
state of malnutrition that it was merci-

fully destroyed. People v. Arcidicono, '

Where defendant charged with failure
to provide prOper sustenance to a horse
testified that he knew that diet supplied
was inadequate but failed to provide
more or return the horse to its owners,

defendant was guilty of violating this

section even though by following the
bailors’ instruction defendant might
avoid civil liability for resulting injury to
the horse. Id. . ~

12. Elements of offense

In order to convict a defendant under
this section, he must have a culpable
state of mind, even though this section
does not contain words requiring culpa-
bility. People v. O’Rourke, 1975, 83
Misc.2d 175, 369 N.Y.S.2d 335, motion
denied 83 Misc.2d 51, 371 N .Y.S.2d 603.

A culpable state of mind is notneces-
sary for conviction under this section
providing that person who neglects or
refuses to furnish an animalwithisus-
tenance or drink or causes or permits
any animal to be deprived of necessary
food or drink is guilty of a misdemeanor.
People v. Arcidicono, 1973, 75 Misc.2d

CASE

This section is for the protection of
animals. Belk v. Boyce, 263 NC. '24,
138 S.E.2d 789 (1964).

It is not for the protection of tres-
passers or mere licensees. Belk v.
Boyce, 263 NC. 24, 138 S.E.2d 789
(1964).

Hence, Unlawful Shooting at Dog
Is Not Negligence Per Se. —— Where
plaintiff, who was struck by a bullet
ﬁred by defendant, was at best a mere
licensee, the fact that defendant ‘was un-
lawfully shooting at a dog did not render
the act negligence per se, nor impose on
defendant absolute liability. Since this
section is not for the protection of the
class to which plaintiff belonged, its vio-
lation did not impose liability in the ab-
sence of a showing that defendant knew,
or in the exercise of reasonable care

tuted "of up to one thousand dollars
($1,000) and imprisonment for up to one
year” for "not to exceed ﬁve hundred dol-
lars ($500.00), imprisonment for not
more than six months, or both” in the
ﬁrst sentence.

ence in the vicinity. Belk v. Boyce. “.363
NC. 24, 138 S.E.2d 789 (1964).

The word "willful” as used in crimi-
nal statutues signiﬁes more than the
mere intention to do a thing, and means
the commission of the act "without just
cause, excuse, or justiﬁcation.” State v.
Dickens, 215 NC. 303, 1 S.E.2d 837
(1939); State v. Fowler, 22 NC. App.

Unnecessary suffering knowingly
and willfully permitted constitutes
the offense. State v. Porter. 112 N

Finding Required for Conviction.
— In order to convict there must. be a

Where a crime was by statute a felony,an

imposition of a jail sentence or fine did not

reduce the charge to a misdemeanor as of the
time of presentation and trial, so as to give a
county court jurisdiction. Ex parte Stricker

ﬁrestored to civil rights, was a crime punish-
able with death or imprisonment in the peni-

Generally where the statute did not state a
crime was a felony or a misdemeanor, or clas-
sify it by fixing the place of imprisonment,
and doubt existed as to whether it was to be
punished by imprisonment in the state peni-
tentiary or the county jail, the defendant
would be given the benefit of the doubt and
the offense would be deemed a misdemeanor,
punishable by confinement in the county jail.

3. In general

Conducting dog fight could not be
punished under cruelty to animals (this
section) since there was specific statute
(former version of § 1682 of this title)
prohibiting instigating fights between
animals. Maloney v. State, Okl.Cr., 532
P.2d 78 (1975). ‘ '

Express malice against owner is not
necessary to constitute offense. It is
sufficient if there was intention to injure
cattle of another. Territory v. Crozier, 6
Dak. 8, 50 N.W. 124 (1891).

4. Killing dogs

Defendant who shot and killed some
trained wolf hounds, which were run-
ning across lands of others and along
country road chasing wild deer, and who
did not take time to, see if they had been
killed outright was guilty of cruelty to
animals. Laner v. State, Okl.Cr., 381
P.2d 905 (1963).

Defendant charged with cruelty to ani-
mals had no inherent right to kill dogs
because of imminent danger to wild deer
they were chasing. Id.

In a prosecution for killing a domestic
animal, direct proof of death by violence

If eockfighting constitutes cruel mis-
treatment of animals, then the practice
itself being against the law, the similar
practice necessary to breed birds suitable
only for this particular use could not logi-
cally qualify as good livestock husbandry

suant to subsection (6) of that statute.
Oregon Came Fowl Breeders Association
v Smith, 15 Or App 487, 516 P2d 499
(1973).

Theexception created by CBS 167 .8ﬂ)(8)
is apparent recognition of the problems
faced by shippers of animals. The effect
of the exception is to exempt shippers
from their otherwise negligent cruel mis-
treatment of animals under ORS 167 .860.
Because the exception does not apply to
ORS 167.850, it does not exempt shippers
from any intentional or reckless cruel mis-
treatment. This exception has a rational
basis and is not grounds for declaringORS
167 .860 unconstitutional. Oregon Came

word “animals.” The legislative history of
ORS 167.860 indicates that this was speci-
fically done for the purpose of including
cockfighting within the scope of that stat-
ute. These cruelty to animal statutes can
therefore be construed to prohibit cock-
ﬁghting in Oregon despite the fact that it is
not explicitly outlawed. Oregon Came

ORS 167.850 and ORS 167.860 do not
simply provide different penalties for the
same offense. The two statutes differen-
tiate penalties on the basis of the culpable
mental state of the actor. For example,
OBS 167 850( 1 ) (a) prohibits the intentional
or reckless subjection of an animal to cruel
mistreatment, while OBS 167 .8&l(2) pro-
hibits the criminally negligent subjection
of an animal to such treatment. Also, in

ferent. The relationship of the two statutes

ther deterrence of similar crimes, and
protection of society and public. Id.

In prosecution resulting in conviction
of murder of third degree. imposition of
sentence of three to ten years’ imprison-
ment was not excessive. Com. v. Moore,
412 A.2d .549. 488 Pa. 361. 1980.

Although en'dence was insufficient to
support convictions for both aggravated
assault and robbery. remand for resen-
tencing was not required where defend-
ant was sentenced to 11" 2 to 23 months’
imprisonment on the aggravated assault
and robbery convictions and to five
years’ probation for criminal conspiracy
and possession of instrument of crime
generally. with the four sentences to run
concurrently, since aggravated assault,
conviction of which was vacated, is a
misdemeanor of the first degree while
robbery is a felony of the ﬁrst degree;
sentencing on invalid conviction did not
influence sentencing on the other counts
prosecuted simultaneously. Com. v

ANALYSIS

Cruel killing.
Evidence.

. Constitutionality.

Read in the context of the entire statute
the term "cruelly kill” is not unconstitution-
ally vague. State v. Tweedie, —- R.I. —, 444
A.2d 855 (1982).

2. Nature of Offense.

» Offense provided by this section was not an
infamous crime within the meaning of former
R.I. Const., Art. I, § 7 (see now R.I. Const.
Art. I, Sec. VII), so as to require presentment
.or indictment. State v. Nichols, 27'R.I. 69, 60

A. 763 (1905).

3. Complaint. “
Complaint charging that defendant in-
“;..t I It 4 ' '

to provide proper food, drink, shelter and pro—
tection from the weather for such animals
was fatally defective since it did not charge
that defendant had the charge or custody of
such animals. State'v. Spink, 19 R.I. 353, 36
A. 91 (1896).

4. Cruel Killing.

Killing a cat by placing it in a microwave
oven and turning on the oven was a cruel
killing prohibited by the language of this sec—
tion. State v. Tweedie, —- R.I. —-, 444 A.2d
855 (1982). ‘ '

5. Evidence.

“here a defendant was charged with ne«
glect of dogs, evidence of the poor physical
condition of another dog in his custody on the
day preceding the date of the offense was not
probative of the precise issue but was harm-
less where other admissible evidenoe was
present as a basis for a verdict of guilty. State
v. Douglas, 78 RI. 60, 78 A.2d 850 (1951).)-

DECISIONS i'XDER FORMER LAW

Malice.

The trial court properly refused an
instruction that defendant must have mai-
ice against the owner of the cattle and cor-
rectly charged that it made no difference
whether defendant knew who was the
owner of the cattle. Territory v. Crozier
(1887) 6 Dak 8, :30 NW 124.

In order that a defamatory statement
respecting the killing of a hog be actionable
as accusing one of committing a crime. the

statement must impute a malicious killing
of the hog. Furr v. Foulke (1934) 62 SD 15,
250 NW 667. .

In a prosecution for willfully and mali—
ciously killing and injuring cattle, the trial
court correctly instructed the jury that it
was not necessary to find that the defend-
ant acted with malice toward some known
person, but that it was sufficient if he acted
with malice toward some person, known or
unknown. State v. Audiss (1945) 70 SD 634,
20 NW 2d 400.

40-1-22. Killing or injuring animal other than livestock as mis-
demeanor. Every person who maliciously kills or injures any animal,
other than those specified in 1340—1-21, belonging to another, or any
animal whatever belonging to himself, is guilty of a Class 1 misde-

meanor.

ANALYSIS

"Domestic animal” and "beast" construed.
Indictment — Sufficiency.

Requisite malice.

Defenses.

"Domestic Animal” and "Beast”
Construed.

The word "beast” formerly appeared in this
section in lieu of the words “domestic animal.”
and a dog was held not to be a "beast” within
the meaning of the section as it then stood.
State v. Phillips, 1 Shannon’s Cases 34 (1850).

It is reasonable to conclude that in
substituting the words "domestic animal” for

_ the original word "beast,” the codiﬁers of the

1932 Code intended to enlarge the statute so as
to embrace within its terms any kind of a
domestic animal which had a monetary value
and thus to include a dog as being a domestic
animal. White v. State, 193 Tenn. 631, 249
S.W.2d 877 ( 1952).

Statute making it misdemeanor willfully,
wantonly and knowingly to kill another’s
domestic animal "of any value” was obviously
enacted to protect useful and valuable property,
and since dogs generally are useful and
valuable and are kept on the premises of people,
a dog is a "domestic animal” within meaning of
statute. White v. State, 193 Tenn. 631, 249
S.W.2d 877 (1952).

2. Indictment — Sufﬁciency.

An indictment founded on the act of killing
“one horse beast” of a designated value was
sumciently descriptive of the property

Myed. State v. Pearce, 7 Ten. 66 (1823).

It was unnecessary to conviction that indict-
ment charge the manner and means of killing.
White v. State, 193 Tenn. 631. 249 S.W.2d 877
l, 1952).

Although killing of domestic animal was not
an offense unless animal had some value, an
indictment merely alleging the animals to have
been "coon dogs” imported a value to the dogs
killed and met the requirements of the law as to
sufﬁciency of allegation. White v. State, 193
Tenn. 631, 249 S.W.2d 877 (1952).

3. Requisite Malice.

Under an indictment of defendant for mali-
cious mischief in stabbing a horse, it was not
necessary to prove malice, since act of stabbing
implied malice. State v. Council, 1 Ten. 305
(1808).

To constitute the offense of malicious
mischief, malice against the owner and not
towards the animal is required. State v. Wilcox,
11 Term. 278, 24 Am. Dec. 569 (1832).

An indictment must charge that the
disﬁgurement of the beast was done mali-
ciously. Boyd v. State, 21 Ten. 39 (1840).

Cutting off the hair of the tail or mane of a
horse, if done maliciously and of purpose, is
within the statute and indictable as malicious
mischief. Boyd v. State, 21 Ten. 39 (1840).

4. Defenses.

Under jury ﬁnding that defendant wantonly
and willfully killed two coon dogs, the fact that
these dogs were trespassing upon defendant’s
property did not bar the owner from a recovery
of their value. White v. State, 193 Tenn. 631,
249 S.W.2d 877 (1952).

39-3-104. Cruelty to animals. —- If any person shall overdrive, overload,
torture, torment, deprive of necessary sustenance, or cruelly beat, or needlessly
mutilate, or kill, or cause or procure same to be done, as aforesaid, any living

Nothing herein shall prohibit the purchase of animals by humane societies,
incorporated under the laws of this state, for the purpose of humanely killing
the same. [Acts 1881, ch. 169, § 1; 8mm, § 2857; Acts 1917, ch. 55, § 1; Code

PRACTICE COMMENTARY

By Seth S. Searcy III and James R. Patterson
of the Austin Bar

This section is substantially simpler than existing laW. Former
Article 1373 of the Penal Code proscribed the willful maiming,
wounding, or disfiguring of any horse, ass, mule, cattle, sheep, goat,
swine, dog, or other domesticated animal. It then provided sepa~
rately for the wilful killing, malming, wounding, poisoning, or dis. ,
figuring of any dog, domesticated bird, or fowl of another. Article '
1373a contained an elaborate penalty provision that required a de—
termination of the monetary harm done by the defendant. Article
1374 concerned, among other things, the overdriving, wilful over-
loading, driving when overloaded, overworking, or needless killing
of any animal. See also Penal Code arts. 618, 1875.

The squabbles and disputes of a frontier society came to life'in
the former Penal Code’s provisions on animals, but the code's
elaboration did not yield precision. By contrast, this section de.
scribes in simple, understandable terms the conduct that virtually
all statutes in this area seek to proscribe. ' -

The protection of this section is limited to domesticated animals
(pets and livestock) and to captured wild animals. Inhumane meth-
ods of hunting, trapping, or capturing other wild animals are prop-
erly the subject of the game laws rather than this code.

This section in the 1970 proposed code used the “without legal
privilege” concept of Section 42.03. “Authority” may be treated
as the equivalent of “privilege” in Subsection (a)(5), although
“privilege” or “authority" were used in Section 42. 03 ("authority"
having been added to the proposed code), but its ordinary meaning
is narrower than the concept of tort privilege. The substitution be-
comes critical when it is noted that this section as enacted elimi-
nates the proposal’s defense, included in Subsection (b), for vet-
erinarians. Recognized veterinarian practices often injure stray
animals, and although the injury is privileged in the law of torts it
may not be “legally authorized. ” The absence of the privilege doc-
trine may also prove embarrassing in the animal attack situation.
Self-defense and the other principles of justification in Chapter 9
are not written to shield necessary violence against animals, with
the displeasing result that one willing or injuring an attacking dog,
for example, may be defenseless under this section.

ANNOTATIONS

1. Intent. The language of subsec. (a) did not in terms or by implication
make intent or maliciousness an element of offense created, and therefore such
need not be shown in order to justify conviction. State v. Vance (1956) 119 Vt.
268, 125 A.2d 800.

2. Snﬁciency of information. In a prosecution under subsec. (a) for cruelty
to animals the information was sufﬁcient if it stated that respondent unneces-
sarily failed to provide animals with proper food and drink. State v. Persons
(1946) 114 Vt. 435, 46 A. 2d 854.

§ 404. Abandonment of inﬁrm animals

I. Intent. “Wilfully” means intentionally, and “maliciously” means a de-

' - liberate and evil intention to injure owner by destruction of his property in.

malevolent deﬁance of right of ownership. State v. Muzzy (1913) 87 Vt. 267,
88 Atl. 895; State v. Sylvester (1941) 112 Vt. 202, 22 A.2d 505. .

In prosecution for poisoning colt, evidence that respondent attempted to
poison certain persons was admissible to show motive, plan or purpose. State
v. Sal-good (1904) 77 Vt. 80, 58 Atl. 971.

2. Suﬁciency of indictment. An indictment for wounding “a steer, ” without
an allegation, that a steer was “cattle, or beast,” within words of statute, was
Went. State v. Abbott (1848) 20 Vt. 537.

It was a suﬂicient description of mode of killing to say that it was “with
and by means of poison.” State v. LaBounty (1891) 63 Vt. 374, 21 At]. 730.

Words “Paris green” in and of themselves import a poisonous substance. Id.

A count charging the respondent with exposing a poisonous substance with

intent kaill in certain cow was not bad because it used word “deposit" after

, , j'e,” nor. because it failed to aver that amount exposed was suﬁ-

The 1985 amendment added the language
beginning “as shall any owner” at the end of the
second sentence of the ﬁrst paragraph. J

This section is intended to cover dogs
killing or injuring poultry, and any person
ﬁnding a dog killing fowls has the right to kill
such dog on sight. Willeroy v. Commonwealth,
181 Va. 779, 27 S.E.2d 211 (1943).

When a dog, which had previously killed
some of defendant’s chickens, ran across
defendant’s lawn and charged against the
chicken-wire fence surrounding his chicken
yard, with every prospect of breaking it down
this was a depredation mentioned in this sec-
tion, and defendant did not have to wait until
the dog had bitten a chicken before killing it.
Willeroy v. Commonwealth, 181 Va. 779, 27
S.E.2d 211 (1943).

Possession of sheep-killing dog not
unlawful. — Neither this section nor any other
section of the Code makes it unlawful to possess
a sheep—killing dog. Laing v. Commonwealth,
203 Va. 682, 127 S.E.2d 142 (1962).

The warrant prescribed by this section is
a warrant requiring the owner or custodian of
the dog to appear at the hearing of evidence as
to whether the dog was guilty of the
depredations mentioned in this section. Its

purpose is to give notice to the owner or
custodian of the time and place of the pro-
ceeding against the dog and an opportunity to
be heard in its defense. Laing v. Common-
wealth, 203 Va. 682, 127 S.E.2d 142 (1962).

The purpose of the provision pertaining to the
issuance of a {warrant is for the court to deter-
mine if the deg is a killer of livestock, and the
warrant is designed to require the owner or
custodian, if nown, to appear and make his
defense in be Jalf of the dog, if he is so disposed.
Laing v. Commonwealth, 205 Va. 511, 137
S.E.2d 896 (1964).

Dog need ' at be in possession of warden
when appl J g for warrant. —-— There is no
language in this section which requires the dog
to be in the physical possession or control of the
game warden or other person when applying for
a warrant requiring the owner of the dog to
appear. Laing v. Commonwealth, 205 Va. 511,
137 S.E.2d 896 (1964).

Nor in possession of court at time of
hearing. —— This section does not require that
the court have the actual custody or possession
of the dog at the time of the hearing. Laing v.
Commonwealth, 205 Va. 511, 137 S.E.2d 896
(1964).

§ 29-213.86. Dog killing other domestic animals other than livestock

or poultry. -— The governing body of any county, city or town may adopt an
ordinance to provide for the conﬁnement of dogs which kill other dogs or
domestic animals other than livestock or poultry. The ordinance shall provide
that any animal warden who has reason to believe that any dog is killing other
dogs or domestic animals other than livestock or poultry shall ap 1y to a
magistrate of the county, city or town wherein the dog may be loca for the
issuance of a warrant requiring the owner or custodian, if known, to appear
before a general district court at a speciﬁed time. The animal warden or owner
shall conﬁne the dog until such time as evidence shall be heard and a verdict
rendered. If it appears from the evidence that the dog has habitually killed
other dogs or domestic animals, the court may order the dog killed in accor-
dance with the provisions of § 29—213.88 of this Code. (1984, c. 492.)

§ 29213.87. Compensation for livestock andﬁpoultry killed by dogs. -——-
Any person who has any livestock or poultry kill or injured by any dog not

his own shall be entitled to receive as com nsation the fair market value of

such livestock or poultry provided that: (i) t e claimant has furnished evidence
within sixty days of discovery of the quantity and value of the dead or injured
livestock and the reasons the claimant believes that death or injury was ca

by a dog; (ii) the animal warden or other ofﬁcer shall have been notiﬁed of the
incident within seven -two hours of its discovery; and (iii) the claimant first
has exhausted his 1 remedies against the owner, if known, of the dog doing
the damage for whic compensation under this section is sought. Exhaustion

shall mean a judgment against the owner of thedog upon which an execution.

has been returned unsatisﬁed. A . , J _ .. , . J A J
Local jurisdictions may by ordinance waive the requirements of (ii) or (iii) or
both provided that the ordinance adopted requires that the animal warden has

conducted an investigation and that his investigation supports the claim.Upon J .. J , _

(a) If any person shall cruelly, unnecessarily or needlessly beat, torture,
torment, mutilate, kill, or overload, overdrive, or willfully deprive of neces-
sary sustenance, any horse or other domestic animal, whether such horse or
other animal be his own or that of another person, or shall impound or conﬁne
any such animal in any place and fail to supply the same with a sufficient
quantity of good, wholesome food, and water, or shall carry in or upon any
vehicle, or otherwise, any such animal in a cruel or inhuman manner, or
knowingly feed a cow on food that produces impure or unwholesome milk, or
shall abandon to die any maimed, sick, inﬁrm or diseased animal, or shall be
engaged in or employed at cockﬁghting,dogﬁghting, bearbaiting, pitting one
animal to ﬁght against another of the same 0r different kind, or any similar
cruelty to animals, or shall receive money for the admission of any person, or
shall knowingly purchase an admission, to any place kept for such purpose, or
shall use, train or possess a dog or other animal for , e purpose of seizing,
detaining, or maltreating any other domestic anima , he shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor, and, upon conviction, shall be ﬁned no “ess than ﬁve nor more
than one hundred dollars, and in the discretion of the court or magistrate,
may be imprisoned in the county jail not exceeding six months”; ,

(b) Any person who knowingly and willfully administers or causes to be
administered to any horse, mule, donkey or pony participating in any pulling
contest any controlled substances or any other drug for the purpose of altering
or otherwise affecting said animals’ performance shall be guilty of a misde-
meanor, and, upon conviction thereof, shall be ﬁned not less than one hundred
dollars nor more than one thousand dollars. .

For the purpose of this section the term “controlled substance” shall have
the same meaning ascribed to it by subsection ((1) [§ 60A-1-101(d)], section
one hundred one, article one, chapter sixty-a of this code. (Code 1849, c. 196,
§ 14; Code 1860, c. 196, § 14; Code 1868, c. 149, § 14; 1875, c. 74; 1882, c. 123,
§ 14; 1897, c. 32; Code 1923, c.149, § 14; 1988, c. 40.)

Effect of amendment of 1988. ~—- The overruled on other grounds, 51 W. Va. 282, 41

amendment substituted “magistrate” for "jus-
tice” in (a); added (b); and made minor stylistic
changes.

This section creates seven separate and
distinct offenses of a similar character. State
v. Gould, 26 W. Va. 258 (1885), overruled on
other grounds, 51 W. Va. 282, 41 SE. 133
(1902).

Detailed statement of offense need not
be alleged. -— It is sufﬁcient in describing in
an indictment any ﬁve of these offenses to use
the words of the section "overdrive, overload,
deprive of necessary sustenance, unnecessarily
and cruelly beat, or needlessly mutilate and
kill,” as the case may be, without adding the
Circumstances or manner in which the act was
done. State v. Gould, 26 W. Va. 258 (1885),

SE. 133 (1902).

But this would not be sufficient in describing
the other two offenses, torturing or
tormenting; the circumstances and the manner
of the torturing or tormenting, as the case may
be, must be stated, as for instance, "killed a
domestic animal known as a mule by breaking
its hind leg by shooting it with a ball ﬁred from
a pistol held in the hand of the accused.” State
v. Gould, 26 W. Va. 258 (1885), overruled on
other grounds, 51 W. Va. 282, 41 SE. 133
(1902).

Neither the ownership nor value of the
domestic animal need be stated in an indict-
ment under this statute. State v. Gould, 26 W.
Va. 258 (1885), overruled on other grounds, 51
W. Va. 282, 41 SE. 133 (1902).

In an indictment it was unnecessary to al-
lege that the mule was a domestic animal, as
the court will take judicial notice that all
mules in this State are domestic animals. State
v. Gould, 26 W. Va. 258 (1885), overruled on
other grounds, 51 W. Va. 282, 41 SE. 133
(1902).

Willfulness is an element of some, but not
all, of the offenses enumerated in this section.
Anderson v. George, 160 W. Va. 76, 233 S.E.2d
407 (1977).

Liability for boarding expenses. -— It is
possible for an owner to be charged and acquit-
ted of a violation of this section without that
acquittal releasing the owner from liability for

boarding expenses as ﬁxed in § 7-10-4, assuml 3'

ing the offense charged did not include the ele-
ment of willfulness. Anderson v. George, 160
W. Va. 76, 233 S.E.2d 407 (”1977).
Gamecocks. - Absent express statutory
authority providing for the humane destruc-
tion of gamecocks seized as a result of illegal
cockﬁghting in violation of this section, such
gamecocks‘ ordinarily must be returned to the
owners thereof. Ray v. Mangum, 346 S.E.2d 52

If complaint is made to a court or magistrate which is authorized to issue
warrants in criminal cases that the complainant believes, and has reasonable
cause to believe, that the laws relative to cruelty to animals have been or are
violated in any particular building or place, such court or magistrate, if satis-
ﬁed that there is reasonable cause for such belief, shall issue a search warrant
authorizing any sheriff, deputy sheriff, constable or police officer to search
such building or place; but no such search shall be made after sunset, unless
specially authorized by the magistrate upon satisfactory cause shown. (1923,

Notes of Decisions

New trlai 2
Sufficiency of evidence i

l. Sufficiency of evidence

Evidence including, inter alia, testimo-
ny of one veterinarian that cattle found
in defendant’s barn had died of malnu-
trition and testimony of another veteri-
narian that kidney infection found in
dead animal could have contributed to
but was not sole cause of its death was
sufficient to sustain conviction of cruel-
ty to animals, despite evidence that de—
fendaut recently purchased feed for cat-
tie and contention that cattle died of
kidney infection. Wildman v. State
(1975) 230 N.W.2d 809, 69 Wis.2d 610.

2. New trial

Supreme court would not exercise its
discretion and reverse and grant new
trial on the ground that trier of fact in
prosecution for cruelty to animals was
presented with lopsided case without
benefit of expert testimony demonstrat.
ing that death of cattle was attributable
to kidney disease rather than starva-
tion, where claim of right to reversal in
interest of justice was no more than at
attack upon competency of trial counsel
and review of record established that
defendant’s conviction was supported by
evidence. Wildman v. State (1975) 230‘
