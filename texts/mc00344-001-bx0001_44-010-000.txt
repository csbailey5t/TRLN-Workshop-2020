Dear Harriet Van Horne,

Thank you for your column "Abuse of Animals". You covered
a remarkable amount of ground in a short space (I wish 223.
would write a book on the subject) and made the reader nea—
ﬁize the appalling breadth of the subject ~~ the extent of
the evil that has to be dealt with.

The recently passed amendments to the Federal Animal welfare
Act should help in reducing suffering of the puppies shipped
from.puppy mills in Kansas and otherIMidnwestern states to

the east and west coasts and in stopping the dog fighting rack-
et, but experimental animals need more protection by law. So.
do those raised on "factory farms" for meat.

The hideous agony that trapped animals go through must be curb-
ed. As you didn't mention this ghastly abuse, I'm enclosing a
leaflet which shows the suffering. Congress is too close to ad-
journment to act on a pending bill this year, but we hope for
action early in 1977 and would deeply appreciate your support.

The beautiful dolphins drowned in tuna purse seines desperateyyy
need help too. I enclose reprints of some editorials on the sub-
ject. Please let me know if you would like more details.

Again, heartfelt appreciation for speaking out for the animals.

Sincerely,

Christine Stevens,
Secretary

Dear Ms. Stevens:

Enclosed is my check for $15 to help your organization in
its campaign to save the whales. I wish it could be more. Please
keep it anonymous.

I graduated from Indiana University in may and I read in
the Indiana Daily Student this fall of an extensive whale
symposium which was held there.

This was particularly gratifying to me because while I was
attending Indiana University I also worked on the Indiana Daily
Student. When I was a layout editor in the spring of 1974 I
lobbied for an editorial to be written on the plight of the whales.
When I became opinion page editor the following semester I
assigned the opinion again.

Now I am employed as a reporter on the Aurora Beacon-News
and I see the opportunity to write another editorial on the
subject.

I asked for nothing from your organization except some more
current information on the status of congressional legislation
and any information you might have on what is happening on a
world-wide basis.

Thank you for your cooperation. Your materials will be
most helpfull in my research.

Sincerely,

Dear Miss Kellems,

I am writing this on...a
very cruel situation in Ston—
ington. A member of our
Animal League recently
checked and found dogs in
cages, a puppy in a wooden
box-tied in it with no air -
no air in the shed. Nearby
chicken innards lay decaying.

If anyone’s. dog is picked up I

its chances . of being found
alive-are small. For a like
situation exists in Ledyard.

in small cages in a dark
shed with only a broken win-

puppy is also in a wooden
box in that" " place. Iwent up
there and the wife of the dog

warden wouldn’t let me in'

A DOGS LIFE

While we appreciate Miss Kellems’v expression of
faith that we have “the way and knowehow” to do
something about the problem of our local dog. pounds,
or any other problem, we have learned through sad
experience that our function is less rewarding than
the ability to see problems through to a final and
just conclusion. Based upon five years experience the
best. we have been able to do - not withstanding the
election of certain candidates we did endorse - is ‘
irritate a few, prick the conscience of a few more,
plant the seed of an idea in the minds of handful of
others, and perhaps suggest a few constructive ideas
which uncredited, promptly became the exclusive
property of those who decided the ideas were with merit.

DeSpite this singular lack of success in the field
of final realization, we are just hardheaded and thick-
skinned enough to intend to keep hammering away,
irritating some annoying others, planting ideas in ~

the minds of a few.

We think that the general situation in our dog pounds
is atrocious. We further think that our Town officials,
dog wardens, and citizens share a collective respon-
sibility and should hang their heads in deep shame at
the conditions we are permitting to exist. Few dogs can
speak for themselves and most articulate deg lovers
are considered some kind of nuts. This being the
situation, it takes a brave public official to publicly
announce that he favors spending the money necessary
to provide decent facilities for dogs. When we quibble
over the cost of educating our children. paying. our

policemen or repairing our roads, how muCh chance

do our dogs stand in the perpetual race for the tax buck?
But, if you really want to know what a dog’s life

 

« . is like we suggest a trip to the local pound You may not
“be aroused to action on behalf of your pup, but Off m..- _

I the o. 3r hand you just might come up with as. little

righteous indignation, a commodity which is vastly

misused theSe days.

In BosWell’s “Life of John-
’an episode is described
where Dr. JOhnson is con-
versing with his friend Bos-
well about death and more

which a man could enter into
the feelings of a friend who
was about to be hanged.

. “Would you eat your dinner
'that daY?

asked Boswell.
“Yes Sir; and eat it as
though he were eating it
with me. He goes on and dis-

cusses a famous case of his _

time where a man who was
about to be tried for his life
had remarked that even
though so many friends had
stood up for him and had
thrown their lot in with their
friend, they would not eat any
less than as if nothing at all
had happened. Dr. Johnson
felt strongly that God had
given to man a great deal
of“fellow- feeling’ to prompt
us to do good, but not so
much that our sympathy
would only be “misery to no
purpose.

And good it is that our
powers of feeling are limit-
ed. Can you imagine the hor-
ror of life if you felt every-
one’s toothache and heart-
acheas painfully as your
own? But there is a power
deeper and wider than feel-

. ing---—_Sympathetic imagina-

2-WAY DOG STORY _

"'v’h’ﬁ' I‘u'.’"""“”"""'-““""' 1 J..7

 

 

The recent revelation that
unwanted dogs are being used ' “
for medical research has
caused a wave of indignation
among “canophiles.”

As a person who has been

charged by critics as showing
more fondness for dogs than
for people we’ll have to say
we do not share in the feeling
of revulsion.

Intact, we find the idea of

 

FRANK

 

 

medical research much more

 

 

 

 

acceptable than the regular
practice of incineration of these stray animals

which has been practiced for a number of
years.

We do not approve of all forms of research.
For example, we feel that experiments in
malnutrition and psychology can be among
the cruelest fates that could befall a dog.
Reading between the lines of Jim Heavey’s
story of last Thursday, it is apparent that
firms and organizations other than Wilson
Memorial Hospital are experimenting in other
. fields.

If there is any criticism in the arranges

ment between the Board of Supervisors and
the hospital it is in contracting to supply

- “. . . five large dogs or six small dogs each
week.” Somehow this commitment seems to
threaten the pet, which may be very much
wanted by an owner who might be hard-
pressed to get it back in the urgency to
fulfill this contract.

We are sure, however, that in the range of
common sense among the members of the
supervisors Conservation Committee, fairness
will prevail.

And because three iriends of ours are
. assured of longer life because of recent
heart surgery, we feel that if these experi-
ments will increase the skills and techniques
of men learning the operation, these un-
wanted dogs could not come to a better end.

IN ADDITION TO THE BROOME County
Sportsmen’s Association hunter training pro-

. k... ,._-_, H-.~...._..

gram, another organization has announced
dates for a hunter training class.
It is the Endicott Square Deal Rod and

Gun Club, where a class will begin Friday
night, Sept. 13 at 7:30. Under a plan which
the Square Deal instructors have preferred
the class will be given in two sections. Two
hours will be given Friday evening and two
hours on the following day. The starting time
for the second session will depend on the
will of the majority attending the Friday
night class. Instructor for the sessions will
be George Anthony.

The Broome County Sportsmen are also
giving hunter training classes. Pro-registra-
tion is necessary and simple —- just call
RA 2-9533 and they will register you and
assign you to the first class which is open.

lBM Gun Club also has arranged several
classes. Those needing the qualifying instruc-
tion (needed for a first hunting license) can
register by calling the IBM Country Club
(SW 7-2381). Art Plummer and Bob Cole are
the instructors.

Homeless dogs from the
Broome County Dog Shelter
are aiding the cause of ad-
vanced ’heart surgery in the
county. .
...Q~The dogs -— four to six of
them each week. — provide
blood for a heart machine
used by an in-training heart-

The county’s participation
in the project was revealed
yesterday by Supervisors
‘ Thomas Patton, Sr., of Wind-
sor,.~chairman of, 'the Agricul-
tual and Conservation Com-
fmittee Of the Board of Super-
visors, and Raymond H.

DeSpite its name, the Bain-

Instead, its operators raise

The center is located about
. two miles outside the Village

The Windsor supervisor said
the county’s role in the Wil-
. son medical project has been
unannounced " by the County
Board committee for the last
year because physicians in—
volved in the work anticipated
criticism of the use of the
dogs in research.

l MR. 'PATTON said that
‘ dogs are chloroformed before
their blood is taken for the

die in the process. 1

0n cruelty to animals

By Bill Fripp, Globe Staff

The voice of the silent lobby is loud
and clear in Congress this Fall.

The silent lobby consists of those ani-
mals which have suffered needless tor~
tures in experimental laboratories, in pet
shops. and zoos, and in the horse show ring.

Supported by humanitarian groups and
sympathetic legislators, two separate bills

seek protection from inhumane, practices.

for the animals. The chances of their pass—
age’in this session appear to be good.

One of the measures Would empower
the Secretary of Agriculture—to set stan-
dards for the care and transportation of
warm blooded animals used in research,
for exhibition and for sale by pet dealers.
The other calls for, a halt to the practice
of maiming Tennessee walking horses to
force them to prance with a prize-winning
gait

It is common practice for many breed-
ers and exhibitors to “sore” Tennessee
walkers’ front pasterns, the area- between
hoof and ankle. To achieve this, the pas-1
terns are pricked with nails, chafed with
chains or blistered with chemicals to the
point where it is agony for the horse to

put his weight on his front legs.

The sored area is covered during ex-4
hibitions with a three-inch boot which
serves the double purpose of concealing
the wounds and increasing the animal’s
agony. ‘

Separate but similar bills offered by
'_ Sen. Joseph Tyd‘ings (D-Md.) and Rep.
G. William Whitehurst (R-Va.) would
impose penalties of six. months in prison

and/oi a, $500 fine for shipping such,
horses across state lines or for exhibiting
them in shows. The bills have the back-
ing of the American Horse Show Assn.
and the Society for Animal Protective
Legislation.

The other measure, aimed primarily
at ending abuse to animals in shipping,
was filed by Rep. Whitehurst. This bill
also seeks to stop the sale of diseased
and crippled petsand exotic animals by
unScrupulous dealers.

Mounting evidence indicates wide-
spread carelessness-ﬁend in some cases
downright cruelty-—on the part of animal
dealers and caretakers.

Scores of dog buyers who have pur—-‘
chased their pets sight unseen from deal-
ers have complained of receiving diseased
and malformed puppies.

A Miami zoo dealer recently charged
that in a single shipment of monkeys,
ocelots and birds from South America, 109
of the specimens were dead. Veterinarians
certified death due to thirst, heat, pros-s»
tration and starvation.

Witnesses sympathetic to the White-
hurst measure have testified thatat road~
side zoos operators “terrorize” animals
into performing by using whips, electric
hooks and shocks.

.i All of these animal protective meas— ‘
ures come' in the wake of passage of New
York’s model endangered species law,
which is stronger than the Federal law
in safeguarding threatened species. Con-
gress seems to be listening to the silent
lobby.’

A Senate committee may Open hearings next month
- into charges by animal protection groups that the NiXon
' administration is failing to enforce adequately four major
federal humane laws.

 

The measures in question —- and several related but.
" weaker ones -- were passed in the last six years as A

an outgrowth'of the ecology movement and the increasing
public sensitivity to the treatment of animals. 'hhey rep-
. resent the first time in history that the federal govern-
. ment has assumed broad reSponsibility to protect animals
' from cruelty under ce1 tam ciicumstances.

There are now more humane orgamzations lobbying .
and active in other ways than ever before, and Congiess -

has been feeling their political clout. Sen. Henry Jackson

(D —Wash. ), for instance, received 45, 000 letters on behalf .

of a bill to pretect the survival of the approximately
17, 000 last remaining vuld horses on public land —- more
letters than he has gotten on any other subject, including

Vietnam. (The bill, with, his summit, passed two yeais '

380.)

The humane groups are currently enraged by a round-
up in February of nearly 60 mustangs in the mountainous
Lemhi—Challis area of Idaho The horses weie' mysteriously
killed or shipped to a pet food company, despite the law

'that provides penalties for harassing, capturing, killing ~
or selling wild horses Sen. Frank Church (D- Idaho) had‘
been warned by a constituent in advance of the roundup” . g.

7 ‘and appealed to the Bureau. ‘of Land Management (BLH)
and the Forest Service (F8) to protect the mustangs.
' The agencies ignored him.

When the bodies of some of the horses weie discovered,
the BLH and FS conducted a secret investigation of the
incident. But no further administration action has yet been
..,.taken

 

 

The American Horse Protection Ass 11. and the Humane ’
5‘1. Society of the United States angrily filed a civil action
, in Washingtgn last week to force the government not to

 

    
 
 

~Wmsma 1

let the matter drop. The suit Charged that federal authori- -

. ties “maliciously gave oral permission” for the illegal ,
»'~'.removal of the horses from the public range It asked
that the Departments of AgriCulture and Interior enforce
.. the wild horse protection law and in addition set up a.

special $600,000 trust fund for Such enforcemeunt

, The Senate Commerce Committee, chaired by Warren; '
Magnuson (D— —Wash.), plans to probe the Idaho rOundup
.and complaints of federal indifference to other humane
ilaws as well. . '
1. Humane gioups have recently protested that the
Agriculture Dept. is ignoring a 1970 law that prohibits

1.11119. soring of Tennessee walking horses. That is a painful
‘iplOCCSS by which sores are produced by Chemicals on
.._;'a hoise’ 3 foot to prompt him to lift his foot higher when
5,111.1 wa alks than he would normally do Horses can be trained
V to walk in that highstepping fashion without sores but

1 it is more difﬁcult.

llore ptotection advocates contend that Agriculture

'. loilicials attend shows in which many hmses are obviously
‘_""soied but do nothing about it. ' - -

The two other major humane laws that 1equire enfor-
_- cement involve the slaughtering of market animals and

the care of laboratory experiment animals. The first re»
quires that the animal be knocked unconscious before it

«is killed. The second sets standards of humane treatment
f and sanitary quarters for animals used in scientific
; - research. 1 '

Three ‘w‘om‘en {ifith hearts of gold and an over-

The three are Miss Dottie Bartell of 110 Onon-

It all started when Miss
Bartell noticed the mother

about in the cold looking for
her pups. She followed the

She then enlisted the aid of
her friends and was given
permission by the occupants
of the. house to go after the
.puppies. However, they
couldn’t reach them and they

call a friend, Leo DeFoster of,

Miss Bartell crawled in and
retrieved the nearly frozen

The three women took them
and the mother dog to the
SPCA animal shelter where
they were treated and then to
Dr. C. Barry Quinn where all
were given shots and he re-

They spent $45 for the treat-

Then, what to do With
them. Again friends came to
the rescue and the mother

‘ Loving Pets

Weave-Ho

By BRUCE RGBERTS

A pretty, long haired black'cat with white ruffled trimming
was tossed out of a car at a small farm on North. Road in North
Yarmouth Monday, together with her two white and. black kit-

' tens. "

A hungry black dog was thrown out of an old blue Buick car
on Fiokett Street, South Portland. A youngster tool: the license
number.

Two puppies abandoned recently on East Bridge Street, West-
brook, stirred up the neighborhood when one of them. was hit by
a. car. Five helpless little black puppies were abandoned in Port-
land’s Deering Oaks. A black cat was put out of a car at Wash—
ington Avenue and Canco Road. A frightened little dog waited
several days by the side of theroad after it apparently was
dropped, of all. places, at the pet cemetery in North Saco.

And the list goes on with hundreds of unwanted dogs and
rats, puppies and kittens left heartlessly‘ on woods roads, town
dumps, at crossroads and beside busy highways.

A favorite dumping place is “in the country” where, presum-
ably, there are homes for all unwanted dogs and cats.

“Please tell the people that all the good homes in the country
are getting filled up,” said a woman in Windham. She has been a
frequent receiver and worked hard to find homes for dogs and
cats that were discarded on her grounds. Not everyone feels so
much concern.

There are alternatives. One is spaying the females and alter-
ing the males when they’re young - to avoid proliferation. Own-
ers can try themselves to find new homes for their pets. They
can have them put to sleep, which is more humane than aban-
doning them. After that, there is guidance available from veter-
inarians, public animal shelters, humane agents and humane so»
cieties. There is absolutely no excuse for irresponsibility, cruelty
or name.

Back to the black cat and her kittens thrown out at North
Yarmouth. They’re available for adoption. The mother cat is eli—
gible for spaying under the Cleo Spaying Fund program spon-
sored by this column, This should make her eligible for a good
home. The kittens are cute and should be adopted, too. The phone
is 846-3381.

\ Nu Nikki,

I was horrified, a few days ago, to see on television, in a
documentary, dogs made to chain smoke cigarettes to aid
research on the probable harmful effects of smoking on human
beings. I’m sure that anyone who loves animals, and saw this
awful sight, felt as I. It showed anumber of dogs, confined in a
box-like arrangement, with only their heads showing. Attached
to their mouths \and noses was what looked like a cigarette
smoking, machine. The dogs were kept at this continuously for
a long period of time. Imagine! ! !

The commentator, with no show of indignation or care for
the animals, (it was as though he was narrating a puppet show)
stated that after a period of time, the animals are killed and
dissected to determine the harmful effects of the chain smoking
on their lungs and other areas.AI hope that some animal-loving
agency gets after this.

To me, it is a terrible waste of time, as well as the horror
of sacrificingthe dogs. Regardless of how m 10h proof is found
that chain smoking is harmful, human beings are not going to
stop. They have already been warned of the danger to their
health, and those who want to, try to stop; others just won’t
regardless of any dire predictions.

I was a chain smoker from the time Iwas 18 until I was
in my early 40’s. _I had tried, unsuccessfully, to stop many
times, but when I finally did, it was adrupt and final. I would
start smoking Camels early in the morning and by noon, had
consumed at least one pack. I began feeling very logy, and it
wasn’t long after that that I had trouble pulling myself together
to get to work. Then one day (and this was before research
found that smoking was a health hazard) I got really bad chest
pains. They scared the h o . . . out of me. I have never smoked
a cigarette since, nor have I ever felt a desire for one.

You can’t persuade a smoker to give it up because it doesn’t
agree with a dog, or with another human being, for that matter.
We all know that we aren’t furnaces: that our bodies are not
built with flues, and that if we smoke we must be prepared to
face the consequences. I can’t see why an animal has to be
brought into this picture. *

And another thought about these captive animals. Where
did they come from? Were some of those I saw on television
any of those that were dognapped from around here in the
past couple of years? ’

recently a black market in

In our own county we are
getting closer and closer to
having a safe and sanitary dog

dogs can be cared for until
death or adoption or being
found by their owners. The
local Humane. Society is

.ﬂourishingwith a lot of new

members of all ages and
occupations. Their tattooing
program has gone forward.
There are hopes for the
training and bonding of a
part- -time humane ofﬁcer to
answer cruelty calls on
animals of all sorts. (At

present, our dog warden takes

care of cruelty cases involving
dogs but we haVe had reports

of cruelty to rabbits, ccats,

Humane Society also
continues its educational
program to ' encourage the

animals to

The kindest thing you can
do, for your pet dog or cat is

1 to prevent it from breeding.

The hard fact is that there are
too many dogs and cats in the

of them are doomed as they

wants them. To breed a pet
type dog or cat, even it it is
pedigreed, is usually a form
of ego trip. You think yhou
have something extra special
and you should reproduce it.
Very few pet animals, even

pedigreed ones, are needed to

satisfy the demand for pets.
Many of the doomed dogs in
animal shelters and pounds
are purebred dogs-not just«
mixed breeds and strays.

‘Many of them are there

because indifferent owners
become bored with their pets.
You would be amazed at the
number of people who get
bored with pets and try to
sell or give them away. In
most cases such owners
should never have obtained a
pet in the first place but gave
no thought to the feelings of
a live animal ’ about being
passed around from home to »

4 .0 How Kind Are You

(Continued from Page 1A)
losing your valuable mother
animal, and there is a good
chance that you may be stuck
with the babies and unable to
sell them. This is particularly
true in the case of rare cats
and dogs. There is no market
in this area for expensive
pets. Every now and then
someone makes a profit on a
breeding operation and we
contend that this is the
exception to the rule. We
raised a litter of
champion -bred, rare dogs and
did not sell one pup. The
only money we made was
from an article \in a dog
magazine on why you should
not breed your dog. With the
$400 we lost, we could have
. bought the best pup in the
kennel from which we get
our female dog.

We are all for people
owning pets--dogs, cats,
ponies, horses, fish, hamsters
‘ or gerbils. But remember
these creatures are luxuries,
not necessities. If you have
bought a can of dog food
lately or a bag of dried cat
food, you don’t have to be
told what inflation is doing to
pet costs. Our horse expenses
have jumped about forty
percent the past year. You
cannot beat the inflation by
cutting ’down on food and

pet, don’t get one. We’ve said«
._it often before, but we’ll say

it again. Purchase price is
meaningless. The care of an
animal over a period of years
can run into hundreds of
dollars. Recently a letter to
the editor of this paper
related the case of a poisoned
pet dying a cruel death. Pet
poisoners are sick people.
There is absolutley no need
to poison an animal which is
bothering you. Talk to the

owner if you can find him,
talk to the law, capture it and
take it to a humane shelter if
it is an abandoned animal. It
is small comfort to those who
have lost pets this way, but
the Roanoke Valley S.P.C.A.
can put you in touch with a
national organization which
pledges $50 to anyone who
posts a reward for the arrest
and conviction of a pet
poisoner. In a neighborhood
where we lived some time ago,
we had an animal torturer at
work. We raised a couple
hundred dollars in pledges,
gave it full publicity. We did
not get our torturer but we
scared him away for good.
Another form of sadistic
behavior which bafﬂes us, is
the act of deliberately
running over an animal on the

animal deaths on the highway
are unavoidable. We will ’
reluctantly go so far as to say
that one should not risk his
life in order to avoid an
animal on the road. But when
we see seven dead ’possums in
a four mile stretch on a single

. day where there were no dead

animals the day before, we
cannot believe that all seven
animals were victims of
“accidents.” maybe you don’t.
like cats, skunks, ’possums or
groundhogs, but if these
creatures are not bothering
you, why not let them live
and breathe? They enjoy the
world as much as you do.
They hurt, they bleed, and
they suffer when they die.

We would enjoy a phone
call from Martha Mitchell but
the ones we get from our
readers describing incidents
of cruelty are simply
heartbreaking. It is not hard
to believe that man is the
most vicious of animals and
we struggle to maintain faith
in humanity but every now
and then we get a “nice’.’ call
as we did the other night
from a lady who has rescued
dozens of unwanted cats and
dogs and taken them into her
heart and home. She had just
rendered aid to one more
neglected animal, and in so
doing had given us a ray of

Humphrey hails humane pet plan

A H ello folks.

My name is Humphrey Horse, better

’ known as “Humph” at the Opekiska

Riding academy, where I am dean of
horses. '

That nice girl who runs PANORAMA
magazine has given me the honor of
announcing something new for Hootnani.
This is important news to all our friends
in the animal kingdom, so don’t go ‘way.

Here’s the big scoop: ‘

At least once a month, and it could be
more .often, there will appear on this page
the photo of an animal that is looking for a
home.

Did you ever hear Tex Ritter singing
about the boll weevil “lookin’ for a
home?” Well, that’s the predicament of
some of our little animal friends.

Sometimes people get pets for their
children and then they get tired of looking

. after them and they drop them‘off along

r—-————-——"

the highway near some farm house or just
anywhere.

Those people ought to be ashamed of
themselves, but it happens all the time
and some of those little dogs or cats end
up in the custody of the Humane Society.

Of course, you know the Humane
Society can’t keep all the little animals
that are brought to them. It really shakes

'me up to have to say this, but some of

these pets are put to sleep if no home can
be found for them.

You may think that is more humane
than letting the animals run around the
country half starved, or worse yet, to get
the habit of killing chickens or sheep in
order to survive.

Us folks in the animal kingdom don’t
look at it that way. We feel that if you
human folks have pets, you should be
human enough to take care of them.

NOW thgzgweﬂhave preached this little _

sermon, we just want to remind you that
you will be seeing pictures of these little
orphan animals on this page. If you would

like to have a pet and will take good care

of it, or if you know some little boy or girl
who deserves to have a pet for a
companion, keep watching this page. of
course, you don’t need to wait until you
see a pet’s picture. you can call the
Humane Society anytime if you have a
hankering for a pet.

We really take this matter to heart
because your friend Humph didn’t always
have wall-to—wall alfalfa in his stall like I
now have at the Riding Academy. ‘

It was only after I got on the payroll of
The Dominion-Post that I was able to.
enjoy such luxury. I still haven’t forgotten
that life looked pretty bleak to me when I
was retired as a mine horse and was put
out to pasture.

Is it any wonder that I shed a few tears

j when I think of these poor little animal '
critters that are looking for a home?

Well, it’s been good visiting with you
and keep that fan mail coming in.

Affectionately yours, Humphrey H.
Horse.

Animals Do Need Help

Frigid weather, a layer of long-lasting snow and the plight of
animals have resulted in expressions of considerable concern
"iﬁ'”ir‘éEEﬁT'days to this newspaper, along with interests in the
formation of a humane society for Scotts Bluff County.

The organization of such a non—profit group is an obvious
need in this county. The dog pounds in the cities of Scottsbluff
and Gering are far from adequate, Lyman and probably other
smaller communities have had dog problems, and a situation
and vague state laws alledgedly have allowed a number of
cattle to suffer and die from mistreatment and neglect.

Recent reports of possible starvation of cattle has alarmed
some individuals, who have had their holiday atmosphere
dampened by the incident. One woman, acting on her own
when county officials decided they could take no action,
ordered a load of feed delivered to the herd.

Concern about the welfare of animals in general is well
known in this region, as evident by the widespread response to
the “Help the Zoo” campaign only a couple of months ago.

The bitter cold which all of us have endured lately is
especially bad on our four-footed friends. Dogs in the pounds
without enclosed shelters and no heat undoubtedly have
suffered, as have livestock unless they received the usual
attention of responsible ranchers. Wildlife probably has not
fared too well, and even the common birds are suffering. The
birds have been seen to seek the warmth of chimney tops in the
mornings and are alert to any sprinking of seed or crumbs by
concerned families. ‘

This newspaper supports any efforts to form a responsible

humane society and will lend all assistance possible.
. Towards this end, in cooperation with the Scottsbluff-Gering
United Chamber of Commerce, we have called a meeting for 7
pm. Wednesday, Jan. 9, in the Chamber’s conference room for
interested persons.

 

. is, e"

CONDITIONS AT THE Scottsbluff dog pound, part of
which is shown here, are not adequate, especially during
the cold winter months. Similar conditions exist in
Gering. A meeting has been called for Tuesday night to
discuss the possible formation of a humane society
chapter in Scotts Bluff County, to help deal with such
situations. — Star-Herald Photo.

When we moved into our farm in 1935—3 sprawling
,18-room colonial clapboard with 40 acres bought for
1_.$8,000-—the first thing we did was remove the stuffed
“ ,owl from. the newelpost on the front stairs. The second
thing we did was install an AGA stove.

Outside of Sweden, England and a few New York
.‘hotels, it is hard to find anybody today who has heard
flof the AGA, which according to its own legend was
invented by a blind Swede and contained over a ton
of mica insulation. In its time it was a sensation.

For one thing, it ran on two pocketsfulof coal 2 day.

“Once a year the AGA went out. I wa s given to understand it was my fault,
since I was the stove’s private janitor. I always thought it had something
to do with the swallows who nested in the flue.”

Stove for Chicks but Not Turkeys

i The brilliant and crotchety AGA Stove.

was full of chicks in various
stages of illness: the shiver-
ers on the table, the hud-
dlers inthe oven, and the
convalescents who tumbled

out 'to scamper,‘ peeping,
around'the kitchen. We had
to keep all seVen doors
closed (it was a very central
kitchen) and take care not
to let any of the cats slither
between our feet on our
comings and goings.

'T We only lost four chicks,
as I remember.

Once a year the AGA
went out. I was given to un-
derstand it was my fault,
since I was the stove’s pri-
vate janitor. I always
thought it had something to
do with the swallows who
nested in the flue, but my
complaints were considered
an esoteric form of malin-
gering...

When the stove went out I
had to empty its ashes from
the narrow passage below
the firebox. Then I had to
build a new fire at the end

I of the passage, reaching in

to my shoulder. to blindly
set and tend a miniature
blaze of two-inch shavings
upon which, 'vVith endless
pains, I laterset chunks of
pea~coal followed-by pieces

and eventually pocketsful of '

chestnut ceal. The process
took three hours.

I think it was 1940 when
the AGA went out-on av’

ThanksgiVing morning. .(One ,

of the worstthings about an

AGA going out was that it »
was hours before you knew -
for sure.) Two of my aunts.

were there for dinner: Aunt
Plowden, a Miss, who wore a
Wonderful bushel-size red
wig, Thad ringed fingers,
wrote poetryfor the Prairie
Schoonerand always played
program music for us on the
piano,_.expla_ining it as she
went; and Aunt Grace, a
widow with a pince- nez and
a tongue. '

They arrived at noon; the

dinner was for 2, and the
turkey was already in the

Inn—-

 

Correction

An extra ingredient inad-
vertently appeared in the
Cranberry Sherbet in. last
Thursday s Food section.
Two cups of cranberry juice
cocktail is the only amount
of'liquid needed in the rec-
ipe. The directions for usage
were correct.

oven. Shortly after 1, Wanda
appeared at the library door
to whisper that the turkey
had made no progress what-
ever and the stove must be
out. It was still warm, how-
ever, and we decided to
hope it would come back
rather than shake it out and‘
start over.

“Have some more sherry,”
my father said.

By 1:30 Plowdie and
Grace were red of nose,
Plowdie growing ever more
fey, Grace ever more acid.
At 2 we mqved to the dining
room and;° began cracking
walnuts. Plowdie liked to
crack a large supply of nuts
and then eat them all at
once

By 2: 30 the turkey was
still tepid. We ate the celery
and radishes and winter
squash and Brussels sprouts
and broke out some terrible
New York State champagne
of which we kids got a half-
glass each.

3:10. We kids had finished

our champagne and were
making the glass rims sing
with our fingertips.

3:25. Aunt Plowden
started eating her walnuts.

3:43. Grace delivered her
self of afinal home-truth,‘
and my mother suggested
that she go upstairs for a
nap.

It was past 4 when Wanda
came in, unannounced, bear-
ing a vast omelette that
stood three inches high in
the silver dish, light as a
frivolous thought, bejeweled
with macadamias and mush-
rooms retrieved from the
stuffing. Cheerful talk broke
out. More walnuts .were
cracked. Another bottle of
the terrible champagne ap-
peared.

I always liked to think, af-
terward, that surely at least
a few of the eggs in the om-
elette came from the very
chickens whose lives had
been saved by the good old
AGA, that brilliant and
crotchety invention.

, Duke is dead, but his name will live on on a bronze plaque
at the new shelter that the Animal Welfare League of Arling-
. ton plans to build.
'7 Duke’s late mistress, Mrs. Erna Uiberall of Arlington left
a $10,000 in his name to help the league continue its work. The
' league received the check last week, and decided to use it as
"the starting donation for their projected $100,000 shelter.
._ The boxer, who was Mrs. Uiberall’s beloved dog for 10
._ years, was a stray adopted from a Maryland shelter.

f‘Mrs. ' [Uiberall believed in our humane policies,” Mrs.
Margaret V. McHale, president of the league, said.
“She used to come‘by here to bring in stray cats and dogs.
She especially believed, as we do, that neutering is the only
way to alleviate cruelty to animals. No pet should be born
‘ unwanted.”

AS A DONOR of between $100 and $20,000, the late Mrs.
Uiberall has qualiﬁed Duke for a bronzed niche in history.

The Animal Welfare League of Arlington is a private
volunteer organization with. some 800 members, which sur~
vives on membership fees, donations and legacies. “We don’t
get too many of those,” Mrs. McHale said. ,

The league was founded in 1945, and four years later the
present shelter was built.

Since then, 190,000 homeless dogs, cats and, occasional
exotic creatures have passed through the building, which Mrs.

‘, McHale describes as “several rooms 0f cages, and obsolete.”

' At the ' moment, the shelter’s director, William R. Meade

III, is on a tour of model animal shelters, getting ideas for the
new one in Arlington.

THE LEAGUE MEMBERS already know that the new
shelter will he soundproofed.

“Getting several calls 'a night from a nearby apartment
house is standard operating procedure,” Mrs. McHale said.
“You get one barker in a group of dogs, and they all start.” . .

PITY THE POOR WHALE;
BUT THE PEOPLE EVEN
MORE

The Nashville Tennessean:

The International Whaling Commission
conference in England has to be regarded
by many as a failure since efforts to ban
whaling got nowhere and a proposed mo-
ratorium had the same fate. ‘ ,

The overall quota was dropped by 2,000,
which was small comfort. Even the pro-
posal to vote a ban, on hunting sperm
whales failed. ~

Very probably most countries believed
that a complete ban could not be effec-
tive. The 10-year moratorium might have
, caused the two largest whaling nations ——-
Japan and the Soviet Union -— to pull out
of the commission and decide their own
quotas.

Some thought...U.S. leadership seemed
not prepared to make the kind of all-out
fight it has made from 1972 to 1977.

Whatever the reason, the conference
didn’t change things much and that is a
sad commentary on the nations which
ought to be far more concerned with the
survival of the whale.

 




Can a . at’ﬂs s i a

It makes one cross. Why in heaven’s name would Canada
vote against a ban on all commercial whaling and side,
instead, with whale-killing countries like Japan and the
USSR which are notorious for plundering the seas with utter
disregard for international responsibility?

It isn’t important that Canada’s vote means nothing,
because only 13 of the member nations on the International
Whaling Commission favored a ban. Even if Canada had
voted for the ban that would have only brought the number to
14 —— four short of the necessary 18 votes needed for passage.

It is not as if there was a whaling industry left in Canada.
And the whale is such a splendid, vanishing species that it
seems immoral and obscene to keep hunting them down
when it is no longer economically necessary.

Canada and eight other nations voted to continue killing
whales: Japan, USSR, South Korea, Peru, Chile, lceland,
South Africa, Spain. Makes you feel kind of proud to be a
Canadian in such illustrious company, chi Countries
favoring a ban — friends of the whale, so to speak — include
all the other English speaking countries, plus most European
members. Why, at least, didn’t Canada abstain from voting,
as Brazil and Norway did? Odd...

It is not as if Canada were traditionally an upfront nation
when it comes to standing by principles. Remember when
Canada wouldn’t raise the Biafran war issue at the UN
simply because it wouldn’t be popular among African coun-
tries, most of whom repress their own peOple and crush}
anything resembling free or democratic political choice.

Possibly Canada felt because it kills harp seals so
vigorously every spring despite international. dismay, that to
be consistent it should also favor killing whales with
abandon. Surely that can’t be the case? There really is no
parallel between whale-killing and seal pup-killing.

Seals are so numerous that if left “unharvested“ they’d
jeopardize other marine life, notably fish which we like to kill
too. And the seal pup doesn’t suffer when hopped on the
head — unpleasant, sure, but death is quick even if it does.
seem. barbaric to kill pups in front of mothers!

When harpooned the whale dies slowly and terribly. And it
is so intelligent, inoffensive, benign. It is beyond comprehen-
sion why a country like Canada would vote to continue the.
unnecessary search and destroy mission against whales. l,"

Biii'GHTON, England -— The flags
of Canada, Japan and the Soviet Union
were smeared with red dye -—-_..repre-
senting the blood of endangered
:in M by save-the-whale demon-
strators outside an international con-
ference here.

Although Canada no longer takes
part in commercial whaling, it was

lumped along with the two largest '

whaling nations because it voted
against a total ban on catching the
mammals at the International Whal-
ing Conference yesterday.

As a result, Canada became one of
the “bloody handed” nations whose
policies could lead to the extinction of
whales, according to conservationists,
including Greenpeace leader David
McTaggart of Vancouver.

Canada, as it has consistently in the
past, voted in support of the commie
sion’s scientific committee recommen-
nations to impose whaling quotas.

The Canadian delegation voted.
against a resolution, sponsored by the‘
United States and France, calling for a
world-wide ban on commercial whal-
ing until depleted stocks are increased

sufficiently to save the Various species
from extinction. .

The proposal is expected to lose at a
full session of the commission, where
it requires a three-quarters majority, ‘
later today. ~

Three hundred demonstrators -- in-
cluding six frogmen who emerged
from the sea bearing banners reading"
“Let whales live” -- staged noisy pro-
tests outside the conference.

Forty of them tried to storm the
conference centre and, when thwart’
ed, began a sit-in outside. One man.
was arrested.

Japan, the world’s leading whaling
country and the largest consumer of
whale meat, threatened to quit the;

The whaling nations of the
world made only slight progress
last week toward providing
stronger protection for the en-
dangered whale in its ages~old
struggle to survive. The. inter-
national Whalin A ,
regrettably faile to approve a
ban on the commercial hunting
of the giant sea mammals. Nor
could the 24 member nations at
the commission even agree to a
roposed moratorium two years
ram now that would give those
relatively few countries with
segments of their po ulation
economically depen ent on
whales time to phase out the in-
dustry and develop new jobs for
workers involved in whaling;

But in voting to reduce the
worldwide quota of whales
allowed to be killed from this
year’s 16,000 to 14.500 next year,

mission also reinforced an
almost total ban on the factory-

The dam er of extinction is still
.very real or some larger whale
species in particular. The
gradually mounting recognition
of the need to preserve these
magnificent creatures is en-
couraging. But the whaling
nations themselves still have to
show greater willingness to
adapt to the changing demands
of a shrinking world if whales
are to be around for future
generations of us land-based
mammals to study and admire.

TheMWhale Hangs On

The Kansas City Star
The‘ whale has not yet been spared from
extinction, but every time the International

 

Whaling Commission meets, as it did the other
day in Brighton, England, there are reasons for

encouragement. World'opinion seems to be
shifting toward support of that endangered
species and a total hunting ban seems inevi-
’ table. Conservationists can only hope that the
giant aquatic mammals can hold on long

enough.

While the Japanese and the Russians, who are
responsible for much of the slaughter, refuse to
give up the quest, they have agreed to
reductions in the annual toll. The quota for 1981
is__about 14,500, only slight reduction from the
16,000 kills allowed this year. A better compari-

son is with the mid-197OS when some 46,000 ;

whales were harvested annually.

' In the interim, the vast Indian Ocean has been
established as a sanctuary and the factory ships,
which cause so much havoc worldwide, seem on
the way out, if for no other reason than that they
have become uneconomic as the number of

whales has dwindled. g
' One sad note at Brighton was the failure—by a
single vote—to win a moratorium on the sperm
whale. Canada spelled the difference between'
, success and defeat and it is believed its vote/
, against the whale was provoked by a failuregofl

\ ,AM'W‘P ,,

the U.S. Senate to ratify a new fishing treaty for
the waters of the northwest Atlantic. The two
issues have absolutely nothing in common.

The big problem is that three-quarters of the
24 participating nations must agree to a policy
before it can be adopted- One or two swing votes
can be crucial, as in the case of Canada. When it
went against the sperm whale, that settled the
issue for 1980. In the meantime, the Whale
continues to survive by the slimmest of threads.
Unlessldecisive action can be obtained soon, it
will be swept from the seas, breaking the
ecological balance of the oceans forever. That is
too grave a price to pay because a few greedy
nations refuse to call in the fleets .and stop the

‘ slaughter before it’s too late.

Dear Sir:

Your editorial of May Zne, ”Research animals have some rights,” has
come to our attention, and I wish to congratulate you on your soune
analysis of the situation.

Because of your understanéing of the importance of effective,
moderate legislation, I hope you will decide to give editorial
support to S. 657 sponsoreé by Senator Robert Dole ans 18 other
members of the U. S. Senate. Enclosed is a summary of the bill
prepared by Senator Dole‘s staff, and I will be happy to sens you
additional background material at your request.

Pain infliction can be substantially reduces if this bill is passed.
The numbers of animals used can also be reduced without in any way -
harming medical research. Indeed, better treatment of animals

and more thought and’consioeration can be expected to lead to
improved research results.

Again, thank you for writing as you did, and I hope yovaill
support 3. 657 specifically so that the goals you approve can be
promptly achieved.

Sincerely,

Christine Stevens
Secretary

P.0. Box 3650,

washington, DC. 20007.

Dear Christine Stevens,

As a nature columnist for the Star I have in
the past been the grateful recipient of material from AWI.
Although Nature Trail is a column about natural history, I am,
in fact, an animal protectionist, with all that that implies.
In my writing I try to reflect my concern that the overall
approach by which we "manage" wildlife is based on a false
premise...that is, that our "resources" attain worth only to
the degree that they are of value to our species.

I've just finished a column about grizzly bears
and in researching the Alaskan situation as it pertains to that
species I became interested in G. Ray Arnett. While attending

the CITES conference in Botswana, I had one after another American
point to Arnett and tell me stories about him. How many were true
I don't know, and as a journalist I can't use any of them (nor, til
now, had any reason to) withhut printed substantiation. The story
that intrigued me the most was the ”one about Arnett shooting an
endangered west Indian parrot. At the time I did not realize
Arnett's connection with the Wildlife Legislative Fund. Now I'm
more intrigued than ever. I am planning some columns wherein I
hOpe to (again) disprove some of the rationals behind sport and
trOphy hunting and fur trapping, and the connection that seems to
emerge between Watt and Arnett and the American hunter is worth
exploring. watt is considered a figure of ridicule in Canada, and
I have enough information on him, but Araett I know very little
about. WOuld it be possible to send me any material you might have
on Bay Arnett? Confirmation of the parrot incident would be most
valuable.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

Barry Kent MacKay

casket, already assembled or in kit form,.from
St. Francis Burial Society in Washington DC.
The kit costs $130 and assembled casket $185
plus $10-$25 for shipping. The Burial Society

which turn the casket into a wine rack or
bookshelf until it’s needed for burial.”

QUESTIONS without answers: Why are
peOple said to go bananas? Doesn’t anybody
ever go kumquats? Loquats? Have you ever
been driven tangerine by a village queen? The
banana is an excellent piece of fruit, give or
,take a slippage or two, and I do not like to see it
downgraded . . . Such loose talk drives me up
the wall if not down the tubes. What drives me
.down the wall are non-Italians who say “Ciao,”
pronouced cheeeyowww . . . Why has “turkey”
become a term of denigration? Turkeys are
ugly but useful and really go around, which
“turkeys” don"t. Why not call a bad Show or
dumb person a wombat instead of a turkey? Or
a cassowary‘? Ever seen a cassowary‘? Cassowary
funny looking bird, not to be confused with the

LET US CAENTINUE: Artist Charles
Surendorf claims the only thing he has against
women is that they always put a new roll of
toilet paper on the roller backwards. That‘s
generally true, but why? Women don’t under-
stand gravity, being filled with levity? May the
Centrifugal Force be with them . . . Remember
the tabletop “test” for masculine vs. feminine
traits? You were asked to strike a paper match,
look at your fingernails, sip a drink. If you
struck the .match away from you, examined
your nails with all fingers extended (rather.
than cupped into your palm), and gazed over
the rim of the glass while sipping instead of
looking into it, you were definitely feminine.
This was considered hotztuff in the .heydays
and nights of cafe society, along with wetting a
finger and rubbing it around the rim of a glass
to produce an eerie ringing noise . . . Why do
women button their jackets and shirts the
“wrong” way -— right to left ~— or are the men
wrong? Don’t tell me it has something to do
with nursing an infant; if so, that has to be a
very old wives’ tale.

"Our aim: To fear God. tell the truth and make money. "
H C. PADDOCK. 1852 - 1935

Some proposals
for regulating
animal research

(N 0 less a biologist that
Charles Darwin had a firm opin—
ion on the use of animals for ex-
periments In a letter to a
friend, Darwin wrote:

"Physiological experiment on
animals is justifiable for real in-
vestigation, but not for mere
damnable and detestable curios-
ity.”

The fact that the tension be-
tween “real investigation” and
curiosity remains in science was
clearly pointed out last week in
a series of articles on animal re—
search published by The Daily
Herald. _

The series from. the Christian
Science Monitor detailed the
serious ethical questions that
are raised by current scientific
practices, particularly those
that inflict pain on animals.

Scientists themselves differ on
the need for experiments that 1n-
flict pain And many argue that
animal testing is the only way to
ensurethat some substances are

3 not harmful to humans.

It may be that animal ex-
, perimentation will always be
inece ssary, but the Monitor
1 writers made five recommenda-
’ tions for ways to improve the

present situation.

0 Enforcement of the Animal
Welfare Act, which governs
housing and sanitation for labo-
ratory animals, should be tight-
ened. Veternarians who are
knowledgeable about lab-oratory
animals should be used as in»
spectors, and the program

, should include all vertebrates.

0 Public involvement in the
scientific review process should
be increased as an additional
check on inhumane practices.

0 Students should be taught
humane avenues of animal. re-
search, and colleges and univer»
sities shOuld develop courses
dealing with the moral. and eth~
ical principles involved in ani-
mal experimentation. Illinois al»
ready has a strong and reason-
able law prohibiting high school
and elementary school students
from conducting experiments.
with living animals or from con-
ducting procedures in which ani-
mals are killed in the classroom.

0 Th e federal government
should allocate research money
to promote research on alterna-
tive methods for screening
harmful substances.

0 The Office of Toxic Sub—
stances of the US. Environmen-
1'tal Protection Agency should
guse currently available short-
‘term bacterial testing as much
as possible to determine the ef—
gfects of exposure to chemicals
on humans.

The relationship of animals to
,1 man has been the subject of sto
[ries , poems and, too
1frequently, abuse. Science has a
[responsibility to avoid when at
I all possible inflicting pain and
i suffering on creatures that can
, neither understand nor defend

nun——

/ themselves.

Implementation of these rec-
ommendations would help to
limit the suffering animals en/
dure for the sake of man. ’

- I'Gwe The Pig A
”ﬂaw/Break; H arass

Somebody Else

" ' The‘bro‘thers at ChiPsi fraternity at
Georgia Tech had this terrific idea for

) the Greek Week celebration on campus.

.'. They were going to have a greased pig
contest.‘ ' ,, ’ ‘

The idea in a greased pig contest is
to catch a greasy pig. The contestant

who. camaccomplish that feat the ,

r-quickest is the winner. .

.7, I havefi’t seen a greased pig contest

-since the7one. themen’s Bible class at 1

my hometown ch rch gave, to. raise

_ ~ money for a piano. t was a bust.

.1 The first contestant was Lucille Gar-

; field,"Wh0 bore a strong resemblance to
" the p18, as I recall. Lucille went a good
240, even without her boots. v .

. Lucille chased the pig around for a.

couple of minutes and. then . became;

angry and frustrated becauSe .each
-«tame she apparently had the pig in her
, clutches, it would squirm away, the
, greasy little booger.

‘ When Lucille Garfield became angry ;
"and frustrated, it was not safe tobe in" 7'

her vicinity. What she finally did was a
belly-first dive onto the pig. End of pig.

End ofﬁcontest. ,

\ when .One'of the membersof the '
dine}! S Blble class scolded Lucille for
.what he termed an unfair tactic, she

; hit him in the mouth.

1li‘ffj‘Vot’hirzg’8" Simple? I

ChiPsi was all set for its contest. A
beencompany had agreed to provide.
:gthekrefreshments. And all the arrange-
ments had been ,made for a pig ' ‘

_%But these are not simple times. The

.. tlanta Humane Society heard about
Chi Psi’s idea and reacted strongly.

“‘"From what I could get,” said one 0‘

vwmmmmmmwml

alive .held the contest we’d all "
- . ,. . . et
gthrown Into-jail.” ~ ~ g _ .-

is: . He was overreacting a bit, of course,

' ibut when I talked to the Humane Soci-

'ety about the matter, a spokesperson
made it clear greased pig contests are
considered cruel and unusual treatment
0.! pigs. ' . '

".-1_“A lot of people,” said the spokesp-
erson, “think pigs are dumb animals.
Well, they aren’t. Pigs are very intelli-
gent. .

' “First, you run the risk of injuring
the pig. If somebody fell on a pig
wrong, you could break a pig’s leg.”

~That much I already knew from the
Lucille Garfield incident. If Lucille
Garfield fell on a horse wrong, the
horse would probably never recover.

I“Also,” the spokesperson continued,
"such 'a contest is veryltr-aumatic to a
pig because it can scare a pig nearly to
death. It is simply a cruel thing to do

- to any, animal.”

The F irst Touch '

"So what would happen if Chi Psi
ignored all that and went ahead with
its greased pig plans? _ . -

“ ,“The first person to touch the pig,” I
-Was told, “would be arrested.”
such an arrest could lead to a $200
fine. It’s the law. '
_j The brothers at Chi Psi think all this
is a little Silly. They saythe Atlanta
Braves baseball team held a greased ~
pig contest once as a promotion and
nobody got-excited.
“'7 They say would-be contestants the
size of Lucille Garfield would not be
“allowed to enter, thus protecting the '
.pig from bodily injury.
.‘ They also say they planned to cook
and eat the pig afterwards anyway, so
”maybe getting chased around by some
fun-loving college kids would take its
mind off the inevitable.
The Atlanta Humane Society says
none of that makes any difference.
Hold the contest and~you’ve got trou-
ble, was the society’s last word. The
pig could not be reached for comment.
My advice to Chi Psi is forget it. I
think the pig might even enjoy a good
afternoon romp, but people who are in
the business of protecting animals
mean well,‘ and they deserve support-
and c00peration. -
3* Besides? there are a lot of other
ways to celebrate Greek Week. I sug-
gested Chil Psi hold a Lucille Garfield
look-alike contest, >-0pen to any 240«
”pound, campus coed with a mustache
and a deep voice.
Incidentally, they never held another
ﬁre-ased pig contest at my church. They .
did have a bear-wrestling event later,
however.

I? Lucille won that, too, with a flying
drop-kick 38 seconds 'into thewfirst
round. The bear announCed its retire-
ment from the ring immediately after
she match.

Underwriter eorns $300 for anecdote

By Barney Brantingham
News-Press Columnist

Tommy Greig, local insurance man,

made this month’s issue of Reader’s
Digest and collected a cool $300 as’ a

result.

TOm-my, of 1118 N. Patterson Ave,
who’s with Manchester Insurance, sub—
mitted the following anecdote to the
magazine’s department, “All in a
Day’s Work.”

“Iwork for an insurance brokerage .

firm that places unusual risks many
underwriters will not assume.

“One day I had two such requests, so.
I called Lloyd’s of London.
' “Would they insure a show cat for an

airplane trip, and would they insure a

parrot against any physical harm?
“There was a pause and then a
woman responded in a clipped British
accent, ‘Yes, we can insure a bird, or
we can insure a cat, but certainly not

‘ the both together.’ ”

1/ 1/ 1/
The other day Off the Beat talked
about how the word tip --‘ as in restau-

 

OFF THE BEAT;

 

rant tips —— comes from To Insure
Promptness.
Well, a reader sent a COpied page

from the Dictionary of Word and
Phrase Origins, by William and Mary
Morris, Harper and Row, publishers.

“Tipping: Most dictionaries dodge

behind the label ‘uncertain’ as far as

this common word is concerned.

“A popular theory is that it is made
from the first letters of To Insure
Promptness posted on coin boxes of
tables in the coffeehouses of Dr. John-
son’s day.

. “This is one of those derivations that
is just a bit too pat to be believable.
More probably tip is a corruption of
stipend, a small payment of money,
from the Latin Word stips, meaning
‘gift.’ ” '
‘ But get a load of something I noticed
on the same page.

“One of the pleasanter and more

civilized of our customs is toasting the

, continued good health of a friend.

“There is nothing new about this

‘- practice, for in all likelihood it began
in ancient times, long before the Chris-
; tian era.’

‘ In those days the common practice
was to pour-a hit of the guest’s wine

linto the host’s glass and vice versa

before either“,drank. The reason?

“Simply that few people trusted any—
one outside the immediate circle of
their family and one way to be sure the
host hadn’t poisoned your cup was to
see to it that hedrank some himself.”

11mm. I’m kind of sorry 1 read that.
Somehow, drinking toasts may never
be the same.

1/ 1/ 1/

Dear BarneyzéﬁHow sad that we can’t
ever let our dogs‘irun loose in the back
country because of the traps belonging
to the heartless appers.

Because of so much land develop-
ment the poor ani. als and people have
less and less land [to roam.

If the people tat buy the clothes

with the fur trim could see the pain a g,

suffering the animals go through wa‘itl‘"!
ing for the trapper to come shoot‘ them

or club them to death, 1 am sure they
wouldn I buy any clothes with fur on
them.

The trappercig and the buyers that
didn’ t want their name or address used
in your article would be out of busi-
ness. And then the animals both wild
and domestic could run‘free. -- W.I.1

Dear W.I.: You also sent along a
brochure full of news stories and pic:
tures of pets caught intraps, all too
often losing a paw in the process. The
brochure was put out by Thewgggﬁiety
for Animglfmtectix’e Legislation Box
3719 Georgetown Station Wash, DC
20007.

1’ ve aiso talked to - a Santa Ynez
Valley trapper, who feels just as
strongly if not more so about his right
to trap without V having his traps
trashed by vandals or those who oppose
what he is doing.

I've asked him to write explaining
his views but he was reluctant.

Furthermore, each agent must

The boycott message apparently

looks nicer to many people, partly

becauseit is a bit more economical.

A COLUMN OF COMMENT
by Dr. Robert J. Ulrich

Animal Trapping

The Aiiiriial Protection Institute of America, head-
quartered in Sacramento, Calif” regularly publishes
newspaper ads which carry photos of trapped ani-

mals, along with the text: “It’ s only an animal. .
Dying in a steel-jaw, leghold trap. An animal that
feels pain much like we do. Imagine having your fin-
gers crushed in a car door. Nobody opens the door for
24 hours . . .” The institute’s stated purpose is to out-
law the steel-jaw trap. “It is the only decent thing to do
—- for the animals. Please help.’

Hearings have recently been held' 1n Washington on
House of Representatives Bill 66, and, as expected,
trappers, the fur industry and the trap industry rath-
er warmly opposed legislation regarding trapping.
H. R. 66 would establish a committee to determine
which traps are humane and would make it illegal to
use unapproved traps 'on federal lands. The interstate
sale of inhumane traps would be prohibited, and all
traps would have to be checked every 24 hours to pre-
vent suffering and starvation.

It appears that considerable numbers of animals
are left to starve to death in traps by trappers who find
it inconvenient to check their traps frequently. Hence
the 24-hour limit of H. R. 66 and laws requiring such
checking in about half of the states.

Fourteen countries, including Chile, England, Ger«
many and Switzerland, have banned the leghold trap
and report no increased animal predator problems,
but the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service opposes ban-
ning the traps precisely because it believes predator
problems will increase if it may not be used. Thus the
experts disagree on that point, although hardly any-
one at the hearing disagreed with the contention that
the leghold trap is an inhumane device.

John Reid, speaking for Woodstream Corporation,
one of the country’s largest trap manufacturers did
say, however, “We prefer to think that this type of pro-
longed suffering (death by starvation, death by thirst,
animals chewing off their own legs to escape, or being
eaten alive by predators while caught in the trap) is
the exception rather than the rule.” We suppose Mr.
Reid has the right to prefer to think as he wishes.

The hearings made it evident that monetary loss
was an important concern not only to the trapmak-
ers, but also to trappers and the fur industries. John
Poser, vice-president of the American Fur Merchants
Association said, “This bill would result in bankrup-
tcy and forced closing of many fur-related business-
es." Mr. Poser estimated there are some 32,000 people
in the fur manufacturing areas and another 250,000
who retail for articles.

But Rep. Glenn M. Anderson (Dem. Calif) indicated
he wasn’t trying to force anyone into bankruptcy when
he proposed HR. 66. He simply wants leghold traps
either made more humane by wrapping their jaws in
weatherstripping or outlawed so that trappers will
have to use traps already on the market which kill the
animal instantly.

Congressional support for the bill does not appear
strong enough to assure its passage, but the debate is
bound to continue as conservation groups and societ-
ies for the prevention of cruelty to animals become
better organized and get adequate contributions to
support their advertising and lobbying efforts.

Most certainly it will spur research which may br-
ing forth better Ways of obtaining wild pelts. . ,4

Dear Hr. Helsig,

On receipt of your kind letter, we sent you some of our
published information on whales. Just recently we had the
enclosed article faom The Toronto Star reorinted, and I
thought you would be f55§f§§f€3”fﬁ"f€7

Although.moet gray whales are protected, 125 are killed
each year for native peoples in the Soviet Union, and
occasionally Alaskan Eskimos kill a gray_whale. I hope
Nacho isn't too friendly for his own good. If you should
want pictures of Nacho, they’re available from George Bryant

of the Toronto Star.

The International Whaling Commission will be meeting in
London, June 21w25. I hope you will be able to focus attention
on the whales at that time. It is vitally important that
further major reductions in the numbers of whales killed be
agreed at this meeting. As you know, there has been a coma
sol§datéon of whaling in Japan. A short article on this is
one oee . ~

Let me know if there is anything else =ou would like us
- to send. Extra copies of the petition are lug sent under
separate cover, as I am.afraid they may not have been sent
before. Thanks for your most valuable help fer the whales.

Sincerely,

_ Christine Stevens
’ President
