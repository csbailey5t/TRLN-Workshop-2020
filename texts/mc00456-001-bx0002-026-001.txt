THE COUNTRYSIDE

This royal throne of kings, this sceptred isle,

This other Eden, demi -paradise,

This happy breed of men, this little world,

This land of such dear souls, this dear dear land,

This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England . . .

—SHAKESPEARI£, King Richard H

Cats of a good ratting strain are the most effective means for

keeping down rodents, but in the western counties the trappers
take a heavy toll of them.

 




 

 

THE COUNTRYSIDE OF BRITAIN

is dishonoured by the use of the gin trap, which crushes the limb by means of
powerful steel jaws. Trapped animals suﬁer thirst, pain and exhaustion as
in cruciﬁxion.

While humane traps would be useful in a minor role, much harm has
been done by propaganda which would assign to them a. major role in the
solution of the problem.

Trapping is chieﬂy used in the rabbit-trapping industry, which is parasitic
on agriculture in Cornwall, Devon, West Wales, and elsewhere. Trappers no
more aim to get rid of rabbits than butchers aim to get rid of sheep, and the
introduction of. rabbit—trapping into (Iarmarthenshire after the ﬁrst world-war
led to a persistent plague of rabbits. The stock on which the rabbit—trapper
thrives is being fed free of charge at the expense of genuine agriculture.

To abolish the practice of treating wild rabbits as an. annual crop it is
necessary to allocate labour and funds to schemes of rabbit-clearance, to deal
thoroughly with areas large enough to prevent reinfestation, to use methods
which do not leave a breeding stock behind, to employ men who do not stand
to gain by leaving such a stock, and to ensure perseverance in follow—up treat—
ment. Humane methods are detailed in UFAW’s pamphlet Instructions
for Dealing with Rabbits (price 3d.)

For rats, traps are very little used by experts, breakback traps are pre~
ferable to gin traps, and eﬁicient cage traps are humane when regularly
inspected. UFAW has published a leaﬂet entitled The Humane Destruction
of Rats and Mice.

Game-keepers use the gin trap for catching stoats, weasels, poaching cats
and sometimes foxes, and also trap rabbits for proﬁt, but wholesale destruction
of predators upsets the balance of nature and encourages the increase of rodents.

UFAW’S Policy in Relation to Rabbit-Trapping

1. Rabbits should be eradicated by the methods described in Instructions for Dealing
with Rabbits.

2. All practicable steps should be taken to bring the commercial exploitation of rabbits
to an end.

3. (i) Area schemes for the elimination of rabbits should be organized whole-heartedly
in conjunction with general land—improvement;

(ii) such schemes should be radical and not, therefore, ex11)ected to pay for themselves
except by the increased productivity of the land;

(iii) farmers who cannot afford to pay for the whole, cost of rabbit-eradication should
receive help from county pest-control staffs on subsidized and/or defm‘red-payment terms.

4. The Minister of Agriculture’s legal powers should be wholeheartedly used against
owners and occupiers of land who harbour rabbits. Legislation giving power to insist on the
destruction of rabbit-harbour, prohibiting the sale of trapping rights and possibly also re-
moving conies from the ambit of the game laws, should be seriously considered.

5. (i) The practice of torturing an animal all night for any purpose is morally wrong;

(ii) hence the gin trap ought to be abolished by law without further delay.

(iii) The fact that initial gin~trapping can pay the cost of a subsequent rabbit-clearance
campaign. though indisputable, does not afford a moral justiﬁcation of that expedient.

HOW A GIN TRAP WORKS
The lower photograph shows the trap set to catch an animal (in
practice it is bedded in and hidden by a sprinkling of earth). It can be
set off by any light pressure (even a stone dropped on it) applied to the
square plate (A), when the jaws will snap together and grip anything
in their way.

A gin trap of the type normally used in Britain.

HOW TO RELEASE AN ANIMAL FROM A GIN TRAP

The upper photograph shows the trap as it is when it has been
sprung by an animal. The cane represents the animal’s leg.

Zlf the animal is a cat, dog, or fox, lay a coat over its head to prevent
it from biting.

Put one foot on the curved spring (8) and throw your weight on it.
You can then lay the jaws apart with your fingers and lift the animal
out. Be careful not to put your ﬁngers between the jaws afterwards
when you take your weight off the spring.
