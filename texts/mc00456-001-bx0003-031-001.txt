HOW TO FREE
_ YOUR CAGED WILD BIRD

; Please, consider that
A CAGED WILD BIRD IS A PRISONER SERVING
A LIFE SENTENCE FOR NO OFFENCE ! ! !

and that allthe care and attention that may be given to it does not make
up for the happy natural life with mate and young ones, free as air,
constantly and happily busied with providing for its family, of which

it has been deprived.
[P.TD.

 




Cages are not Homes, but Prisons.

How would you like to be taken from your home to live in a cage?
If you would not, then-———~——-set your little prisoner free!

Perhaps a few simple hints as to the best way of releasing your

bird may be of use.

(.1) Always take the bird out to open country; never release it
in the town, Where it might have difﬁculty in ﬁnding its natural
food, Or fall a prey to cats.

Do not release it in bad weather.

Make certain that it is sufﬁciently strong on the wing to be
released—birds which have been long caged (especially in small
cages) cannot always use their wings fully at ﬁrst. You can
exercise the Wings by allowing the bird to fly about the room
until it is strong enough to be released.

Do not fear that other Birds will
attack the Released Prisoner

The greatest of naturalists, W. H. Hudson, declares that this does not
happen, after he had given the matter the most careful study, watching

released birds.

If your bird is from the Tropics, and cannot be freed in this country,
you can always bring a certain amount of happiness into its life by letting
it ﬂy about in the house, and making of it

A Companion instead of a Prisoner. ’

AND PLEASE RESOLVE NEVER
TO BUY ANOTHER BIRD.
