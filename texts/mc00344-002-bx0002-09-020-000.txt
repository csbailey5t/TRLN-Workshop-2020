Dear Ms. Diklich:

Thank you for letting me know of your interest in the
Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA).

As you know, reauthorization of the MMPA will be con-
sidered this year. In the Senate, the Committee on Commerce,
Science, and Transportation held hearings in early April
to provide interested witnesses an opportunity to express
their views. As a member of the National Oceans Policy
Study of the Senate Committee on Commerce, I have been
following the Senate hearings closely. In fact, I wanted
to be sure that the hearing record reflected the concerns
expressed to me by many people from Washington State. To
be Of assistance to our State, I included a statement in the
Commerce Committee hearing record that reflected these con-

cerns. I have enclosed a copy of these comments for your
information.

You may also be interested to know that legislation to
reauthorize the MMPA is being-considered in the House of
Representatives. This bill, H.R. 1672, has been referred
to the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee where
it is now pending.

I am pleased that you contacted me about the MMPA at
this time so that I will know of your concerns before this
legislation comes before the full Senate for consideration.

with best regards,
Sincerely you

STATEMENT OF SENATOR HENRY M. JACKSON
TO THE
COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION‘
MARINE MAMMAL PROTECTION ACT

 

The upcoming reauthorization of the Marine Mammal Protection
Act gives Congress an opportunity to look with a comprehensive
eye at the merits of the conservation program established and
and coordinated by the Act. The Commission established by the
Act is known for its work in supporting research into endangered
and threatened species. The information developed through this
research has been necessary to monitor the viability of marine
mammal stocks.

In addition to these aspects of the program established by
the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), I want to be sure
that sufficient attention is given to that part of the research
coordinated under the MMPA that supports the ongoing harvest
levels of domestic commercial fisheries. The continued economic
viability of some fisheries is dependent upon accurate informa—
tion about the populations of marine mammals travelling with
commercially harvestable stocks.

An example of this important function conducted under the
MMPA can be found in the fisheries of the North Pacific off the
coasts of Washington and Alaska. The United States has negotiated
a fishing agreement with Canada and Japan whereby these competing
fishing nations have agreed to forego portions of their potential
harvest of stocks outside our ZOO-mile territorial seas: Stocks
of harvestable fish are allowed to pass through these open waters
and into our domestic fishery. The competing nations, for their
part, are allowed to harvest selected species within our ZOO-mile
zone. '

This agreement is beneficial to our fishery. But we must
monitor closely the incidental harvest of marine mammals in our
waters by these foreign fisheries and seek to determine the impact
on the population of marine mammals in our ecosystem. Currently,
'we monitor and gather information about the marine mammal popula-
tion under the provisions of the MMPA. In this respect the MMPA
provides a vital and useful process. Without it, our agreement
in the North Pacific with competing nations could disintegrate,
and foreign fisherman would be able to decimate our commercial
stocks outside our territorial waters.

We must not overlook the broad applications of the research
coordinated under the MMPA. The research being done on marine
mammal pOpulations in the North Pacific is one example where the
benefits of the MMPA are accruing to our commercial fishing
agreements. As Congress considers the reauthorization of the
MMPA, I will continue to work for a comprehensive review of the
economic benefits that result from the MMPA's coordinabaﬂresearch.

Dear Mrs. Franklin:

Thank you for letting me know of your concern with
the incidental killing of porpoises by tuna fishermen.
I want you to know that I share your concern for the pro-
tection of these mammals.

As Chairman of the Senate Interior and Insular Af-
fairs Committee, I worked hard for the enactment of the
Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, which was designed
to help insure the preservation of the porpoise and other
marine mammals.

As you may know, U.S. District Court Judge Charles R.
Richey has ruled that the existing regulations and general
permits allowing the unlimited killing of porpoise while
purse seining for yellowfin tuna are in violation of the
Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972. I am hopeful that
improvements in fishing technology and new regulations will
provide the necessary protection these mammals need and
deserve.

You may be sure I will continue my efforts to preserve
and protect our wildlife population. I appreciate having
your views on the protection of the porpoise.

With best wishes.

Sincerely yours

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Nicklin:

Thank you for your kind words of support for
w efforts regarding the protection and preservation of
endangered Species. Your interest in our wildlife is
sincerely appreciated.

As you may know, I strongly supported passage of
the original Endangered Species Act and have continued my
efforts in behalf of wildlife in general. For example, I
was the author of the legislation enacted to provide for
the protection of wild free-roaming horses and burros on
the public domain and also lent my support to measures for
the protection of whales and other mammals.

On July en, 1973, I was pleased to join ninety-one
of my colleagues in unanimous support of S. 1983, the En-
dangered Species Act of 1973. The House of Representatives
passed the bill on September 18, 1973. Because of the dif-
ferences in the Senate and House-passed versions of this
legislation, a conference committee was convened to iron out
those differences. On December 19, 1973, the Senate approved
the conference report and the House did the same on December
20. s. 1983 then became law on December 28, 1973.

Thank you again for your letter. I certainly
share your enthusiasm for the progress of this legislation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —SENA r.

Wash—the site of Expo” ’74 before it

closes next November.

. This is the ﬁrst international sym—
posium ever held on the subject of main-

taining a quality. environment.

Thousands have already visited the
Expo site and the ﬁrst discussions on the
environment have already been held.

It was my good fortune to visit the
fair on May 19 and address a symposium
on the environment at Gonzaga Uni-
versity. ' ,

My message on that occasion was
simply this. At the heart of the environ-
mental problem we face is how to deal
with the basic resource—land. Land is
the premise on which we make. all moves,
and unless we get. that house in order ,we
cannot do all of the other things we need
to do to maintain a quality environment-
logically and reasonably.

I am proud that the Senate has taken
prompt and early action to provide na-
tional land use legislation. Hopefully

House action on this measure will come

before the end of this Congress.
Because of the importance of bringing

' about a broad understanding of this issue

I ask unanimous consent that my re-

marks on land use delivered on that oc- .

casion be included in the RECORD at this
point.

In addition I ask unanimous consent
that my remarks published recently in
Passages magazine on the subject of
Expo ,’74 be printed in the RECORD.

There being no objection, the remarks
were ordered to be printed in- the RECORD,
as follows: ‘ '
REMARKS BY SENATOR HENRY M. JACKSON

It is altogether ﬁtting. that the ﬁrst inter-
national exposition- with the environment. as
its theme is being, held here in the Paciﬁc
Northwest. Certainly nowhere: on this con-
tinent is there a more. impressive environ-
ment than ours. And nowhere on this con-
tinent are these citizens more sensitive to
the necessity of, protecting. environment

quality. Statutes such as Washington's ‘-

Shorelines Management Act, .1133 State En-
viron-mental Policy,.Act, and Oregonfs Land
Use Law, attest, to. our environmental con-

cerns. Initiatives . such as the: rehabilitation;
of Lake WashingtOn and the Willamette-

River in Oregon demonstrate. this region’s
commitment. to back legislation With strong
action. ',

It was, as you know,» the. signing. of the Na-
tional Environmental Policy Act. on January
1, 1970, that 'uShered inanew era of national
environmental consciousness. This Act had
three major purposes:

' It provided a mandate. to all Federal agen-
cies to protect the quality of our environ-
ment.

It created a. Council on Environmental
Quality to insure that the mandate is. car-
ried out. .

It established a set of “action forcing"
administrative procedures which require an
environmental impact. statement on any
proposed major Federal action which would
adversely affect the environment.

As the author of that Act, I take pride in
its proven strength. However, if we are truly
to protect our environment, we cannot rest
on past legislative achievements.

To meetthe environmental mandate which
NEPA provides requires more than case-by-
case decisionmaking—no matter how bal-
anced it is, no. matter how environmenally
sound it is. We must have decision-making

which is based on planning. Before we can.

make speciﬁc decisions on various uses of
any resource, particularly a ﬁnite resource,

we must know all of the competing demands
on that resource—economic, social, and en-
vironmental—and we must attempt to bal-
ance these demands. This can only be done
by planning. .

NO ﬁnite resource is more important from
an environmental standpoint than our
LAND. 0n no other resource are the demands
more severely. To preserve the environment
quality of land we must plan its use.

As Chairman of the Senate Interior and
Insular Affairs Committee, I have devoted a
great deal of time to land use questions.
Since 1964, my Committee has approved and
the Congress has enacted legislation to set
aside over 14 million acres of land and. water
for the use and enjoyment of all Americans.

These were “National” land use policy de-
cisions. They were made in the belief that
the dedication of a part of America’s land
base for recreational, scenic, historic, cul-
tural, and wilderness purposes is. a high pri-
ority national goal.

Important as these past decisions are to
our national well-being, they fall short of
what is required to meet the emerging na-
tional land use crisis.

Let no one be mistaken, we are faced with
a national land use crisis. Our advanced
technology, our growing economy, and our
expanding and more mobile population are
placing truly unprecedented demands on our
land base. We simply are not making any
more land; yet, we are demanding more and
more of it to house, feed, school, transport,
and supply the material. and recreational
needs of our people.

To meet this land use crisis—to reverse
the‘tide of environmental deterioration, ur-
ban blight, and suburban Sprawl, and to pro-
vide for the timely siting of critcally needed
development—we must wisely plan the land’s
use.

We can delay no longer. The pressures
upon- Our land are nearly overwhelming.

Over the next 30 years, the. pressures upon
our ﬁnite land resource. will result in the
dedication of an additional 18 milliomacres
or 28‘ thousand square miles of undeveloped
land to urban use. a

‘ This urban sprawl will consume an area
equal to all the urbanized land within our

majofcities, the equivalent- ofuthe total area-‘7

of New Hampshire, Vermont,. Massachusetts.
and Rhode Island. , ‘ . . -‘

Each decade, new, urban growth will. con-
sumer an ‘area greater than the. entire State"

than 140,000 acres of potential prime. indus-
trial sites for over two hundred. new major
generating stations, and will require im—
mense acreages of land to be disturbed by
strip mining. for coal.

In summary, by present projections—abe-
tween now and the year 2000—»we must. build

. again all that we have built. before. We. must

build as many homes, schools, airports, and
hospitals in the next three decades as we.
built in the previous three centuries. ~ '

Our nation’s economy and environment
can no longer bear the burden of the chaotic,
ad hoc, case-by-case, crisis—to-crisis, land
use decisionmaking which all levels of gov—
ernment have indulged in the past. We can

'no longer countenance a situation in which

many critical land use decisions are the ex-
clusive province of those whose interests are
selﬁsh, short-term and private. In the fu-
ture, in the face of immense pressures on. our
limitedland resources—these land use deci—
sions must be long-term and public.

The Federal government- can and must
assist the states and localities to reform
their institutions and procedures in- order to

S 10027

improve their land use decisionmaking. Fed-
eral ﬁnancial assistance is, of course, mOst
critically needed. State and local govern-
ment, confronted with the funding de-
mands of programs to’ solve immediate prob—
lems, are seldom able to segregate sufﬁcient
funds to conduct planning—even when such
planning could result in avoidance of num-
erous future problems. But—let me be frank
with you-federal assistance. is also needed
to provide much needed political muscle.
Without federal legislation requiring reforms.
and offering funds to do so, most states
could not move the necessary enabling leg.-
islation. Numerous governors have told me

privately how much they are counting on

federal legislation to place them in a
stronger position with their own legislatures.
Otherwise, it takes a crisis—a Santa Bar-
bara oil spill, a'threat of a. reﬁnery on the
Maine coastline, massive destruction of _
scarce open space in Hawaii—to precipitate
state action. In my view, state action should"
be taken before the crisis, not in panicked
reaction to it. 7 .
With this in mind, I have introduced and
fought- for a National Land Use Policy Act.
My bill was ﬁrst introduced in 1970. It. has.
been reported by the Senate Interior Com-
mittee three times and has twice passed the

Senate by wide margins, most recently on: .

June 21 of~last year,
My bill would— .
Encourage the states, which have the.

police power and the basic constitutional

authority for planning and management. of
non-federal lands, to take'the initiative in

developing state land use programs;

Provide $800 million in grant funds. to the.-
states for staﬂing, data gathering and analy~
sis, and development of the land use.- pro--
grams; . ‘ ~

Encourage passage of the necessary state
enabling legislation to insure implementa—
tion of, the state land use prograins;

Direct federal agencies to comply'with apa-
proved state land use programs; _ and

Put the federal “house” in.- order by provid-

ing, for interagency' coordination of federal:

programs \which. have signiﬁcant land use ' ‘

impacts. '

The bill does not ask the states‘to- do

It is my hope that this very reasonable,“ '

THE ENVIRONMENT or Expo ’74
(By Senator Henry M. Jackson)

Between rMay and November of this year,
an estimated ﬁve million people will discoVer
the Paciﬁc NorthwestThey will be attracted
to this remarkable land by Expo ‘74——the
ﬁrst international exposition ever held on
the environment.

The central theme on Expo is "Celebrat—
ing Tomorrow’s Fresh, New Environment,”
and the purpose of the Spokane World’s
Fair is to offer to people throughout the
world a program for the improvement of
man’s physical environment.

The exposition will demonstrate how the
air, water’ and land can be used to benefit
man without pollution. Exhibitors include
Russia, the Republic of China, Japan, Mexi-
cox Australia, Korea, Iran and several
European nations, among the many foreign
participants; and the United States and
several state, institutional and industrial
pavilions are expected to attract much
attention.

Planning for this great enterprise began
in early 1970, and construction on the 100-
acre exposition site in downtown Spokane
started in the fall of 1972.

The site, including Havermale and Cannon
Islands and the north and south banks of
the cold and clear Spokane River, is crowned
by the spectacular Spokane River Falls, 3
Splashing attraction usually found only in
remote Alpine areas.

Most of the Expo visitors are expected to
ride a gondola that will whisk them down
the Spokane River goi go and across the face
of the falls.

It won’t be quite like tumbling ovei
Niagara Falls in a barrel, but it will be
an exciting trip 'over crashing water.

Spokane is 290 miles east of Seattle, and
ninety-ﬁve miles south of the Canadian prov-

ince of British Columbia The Rockies begin '

only a short drive east 01’ Spokane, on the

way through Idaho and into Montana

struction of the U ..S Pavilion which will be

., located on a four- acre site Within the Pa-

vilion, the visitor will be able to walk from
the theatre area, through a central courtyard.
en route to the multi—media Environmental
Action Centei -—all undei the pavilion’ s huge
translucent roof.

The purpose of the US. Pavilion, expressed
in ﬁlm, garden and exhibits, is to present
environmental and ecological issues for pub-
lic scrutiny, and suggest alternatives to help
maintain a quality environment.

The Japanese will demonstrate a model of
a pollution-free, industrial complex and an
innovative city trafﬁc system.

Pollution control and ecological safeguards ,
are topics of sei ious discussion in the t>Sovieté“

Unio-,n and Russian representatives say their;

exhibit will feature the Soviet approach to;

these problems.

The people of Washington are solidly be.-
liiiid Spokane’s ambitious undertaking. They

J zone ‘17,

remember fondly the glowing success of the ‘

Seattle World’s Fair of 1962—a jewel in the
great succession of world expositions during
the early sixties. The Seattle fair was the
only World’s Fair, to that point in time, to
end in the black. Good management and a
good show paid oﬂ’. The visitors loved it.

Washington’s state legislature actually
topped the federal government, by approving
an $11.9 million exhibit for Expo ’74, includ-
ing a 2700—seat opera house and a gallery to
show major American landscape art dating
back to colonial times. Originals byw John
Audubon, Andrew Wyeth, Charles Russell
and others will draw the crowds.

Industry will play a major role in the sue-V

cess of Expo. -

A Ford Motor Company spokesman has
“We hope our exhibit at Spokane
will portray some exciting new concepts in
recreation vehicles and their utilization by
the growing numbers of people who want to
travel and live outdoors.”

General Motors displays could range from
a full-scale Lunar Rover and the General
.Motors Experimental Safety Vehicle, to latest
advances in gasoline-powered and electric
cars and operating cutaways of automobiles
and engines.

A permanent outdoor theater to serve as a
setting for concerts musical and dramatic
events and public ceremonies is being de-
veloped by Boeing It will adjoin the Soviet
and European pavilions on the quiet eastein
frontage of Havermale Island. The Smith—
sonian Institute, with its huge 1976 Bicen—
tennial festival scheduled on the Mall in
Washington, D. 0., will establish a miniature

« of the ’76 national show of Spokane. The

Institute’ 5 four acre riverfront park on the
north shore is expected to come up with some

of the most popular events of the six— month

run.

Geared to the cultural and ethnic oiigins
of the Paciﬁc Northwest, the Smithsonian
Theme Park (“The Northwest: A Gift of the
Earth”), will provide a continuously chang-
ing program. One day, American Indians will
present a show or activity—part of the on-
going Expo series of self-proposed and di—
rected American .Indian events. On another
day, perhaps the Northwest’ s Scandinavian
population will be featured displaying their
cultuie. It is the ﬁrst time that the Smith-
sonian has participated in a World’s Fair. .

There will be a feast of some of the World’s

' greatest entertainers.

Already booked into the Fair are the Los
Cleveland Philhar-

Villella of the New York City Ballet, Roberta
Pe tors, the Carpenters, Gordon Liwghtfoot

‘Liberace, Disney on Parade, the King Fam-

ily, Jeffrey Ballet and more.

With people from all over the world ex-
pected to converge on Spokane for Expo ’74,
the community is making ﬁnal preparations
to accommodate the inﬂux. A downtown pro-
gram of beautiﬁcation has paid off, giving a
pleasant, tree-shaded appearance to the city
center.

The big fair has also provided an object
lesson in conservation.

Spokane s ﬁrst families are actually a

colony of yellow-bellied marinots~small

furiyV animals somewhat larger than their
woodchuck cousins who have lived on the
fair site for longer than man.

When construction was announced, Mau-
rice Vial, Spokane architect and member of
the Spokane chapter of the Audubon Society,
expressed concern for the safety of the issi-
dent marmots in a letter to King F. Cole,

The theme of the Republic of China (Tai- % President of Expo ’74. “These animals saw

Because of Vial’ 8 concern, the animals are

Area youth are getting an ecological object
lesson, forming search parties for abandoned
automobile hulks destinued for the scrap
pile. The Goal of The Expo ’74 Youth‘Task

Force, “Operation Carcase." is to remove all

abandoned automobiles from the Spokane

area and to recycle them through the scrap-
metals market. It is a clean-up activity so
visitors to the city of 200,000 will view an
environment unspoiled by. the litter of rust-
ing automobile bodies. In the ﬁrst few weeks,
more than 500 unsightly automobile hulks
were identiﬁed for removal by the primarily

high school-age search party. .

The exposition will, in a major way, be
\ an environmental event in itself. The area,

once a tangle of railroad tracks and derelict

; buildings, will become a massive redevelop-

. ment and rehabilitation project which will

§ restore the river and surrounding terrain

:- to its former natural beauty. With thousands

of trees to be planted, and the many areas

3 or grassy walkways and quiet pools to be

', installed, the site of the world's ﬁrst en-

; vironmental exposition ‘will be both daz-

zlingly beautiful and tranquil.

Spokane is gearing up for the visitors.
Expo has established its lodging and infor-
mation services: Hospitality Services, PO.
Box 1974,'Spokane, Washington 99210,. (509)
456—1974. Accommodations with-in 100 miles
; of Spokane are being categorized and listed,
‘ and reservations are now being accepted.
' Information on Northwest touring is also

available, as well as a comprehensive enter-

\ tainment guide for Expo’s duration.

f Local universities are helping out, too,
with hostel programs at Gonzaga, Whit-
worth,‘ Eastern Washington State College,
Fort ~‘Wri-ght and Washington State Uni-

, versity. '

p In the: area of eastern Washington, camp-

‘ grOunds, state parks, national parks and re-’

had written. to" help the city of Spokane
tell the world about Expo ’74.

r I ask unanimous consent that Mrs.
Bellfs letter and lyrics be included at this

There being no objection, the letter

in the RECORD, as follows: -

OAK HARBOR, WASH.,
April 14, 1974.

DEAR MR. Bmc CROSBY: First, let me thank
you for the delightful reply you sent us to
the get well card I sent. ‘

Spokane claims you for its own. Spokane
is having a Fair. I don’t think they have a
song for it. So I wrote this lyric:

The FAIR-est words
- You've ever heard
Are spoken in Spokane,
They’re asking you
To come and View
New wonders if you can.

You’ll sigh your sighs

And realize

Your dreams could all come true.
So join our song

And come along, -
Spokane’s in love with‘youl

This is a better song than Seattle had for
its Fair. It could catch on and sell the
"74, Fair, put Spokane on the map and do a
lot of good. ,

I 'used to live in Spokane, and I Want to
give Spokane these song words. I have not.
copyrighted them. I ask no proﬁt for myself.-
I only ask someone pass them to the. proper
authorities. Maybe your agent would think
you should sing this song as a promo for the
Fair in your home town.

You receive so much mail you can't. pos-
sibly read it all so perhaps this letter will
never come to your attention. So I’ll send
copies of “it to various oﬁ‘lcials, media, and
Gonzaga University. As one former resident
of Spokane to another, I had to reach out. to
you and‘ask-i-f you could pass this. song, along
to. someone who can help, Spokane. with it.
Can someone help? ,

Thank you for. your kind considerations». ~-.

Sincerely yours, ‘

   

Mrs. Jonnviilg Benn. ‘ ..

Dear N . Hobaek:

Thank you for letting me know of your support for a continue3
ban on the use of poisons for predator control on public lands.

i understand and appreciate your views on this matter as
I share your concern for our wildlife. As you know, the present
ban is a result of a Presidential Executive Qrder iss ned last
year. Legislation has been introduced in the 93rd Songress 25° .wi h
would inc: rporate the President's Executive Qrder into law.
You will recall that similar legislation was also introduced in
the last Conrress and was approved by the Hoes e of Representatives
but was not considered by the Senate.

In my View a re—examination of the methodology and goals
of the Federal predator control program has been long overdue.
The controversy surrounding the Executive Drder wil3 hopefully
be e3ari.fied during consideration of the related lenis.lation
by the Congress and I am look ing forward to action h; the Senate
Commerce Committee and the Senate this ‘ear.

You may'he sure that because of my own interest in our
wildlife and my continued support of the Endangered Sp eies
program I will hawe your views uppermost in my mind

you know, this legislation is designed to conserve and
protect marine mammals and to establish a Marine Mammal
Commission which.will have the responsibility of reviewing

The bill passed by the Senate on July 26 contained
several provisions not included in the House bill. There-

Dear Friend:

Thank you so much for your support of my efforts to
provide for the protection of the remaining wild horses
and burros on the public lands. Please excuse my use of
a form letter, but it is the only way that I can extend
my gratitude to the thousands of concerned citizens who
have written to me.

I know that you will be pleased to learn that my bill,
S. 1116, which provides for the protection of these animals,
was signed into law by the President on December 15, 1971.
I introduced the bill on March 4, and it was passed by the
Senate on June 29th. On October 4, the House of Representa—
tives passed an amended version of the bill. I then request-
ed a meeting of a joint Senate-House Conference Committee in
order to reconcile the differences between the two versions
of the measure. A compromise was worked out, approved by
both Houses of Congress and is now Public Law 92—195.
I firmly believe that this new law will provide the
protection that these animals so much need and deserve.

I would like to thank you again for your support.
The many letters which I received, particularly from our
young people, have meant a great deal to me.

Best wishes.

Sincerely,

Vol. 117

 

Senate

. By Mr. JACKSON (for himself
and Mr. HATFIELD) : _
S. 1116. A bill to require the protec-

tion, management, and control of wild

free—roaming horses and burros on pub-

lic lands. Referred to the Committee on

Interior and Insular Affairs.
'WILD HORSES LEGISLATION

. Mr. President, on be- . ‘ .
Mr. JACKSON . program that is acceptable to all inter- ,

half of the senior Senator from Oregon

(Mr. HATFIELD) and. myself, I introduce
today a bill designed to protect the last
of the wild horses and burros of the
United States—the living symbols of our
historic pioneer spirit and the nobility of
freedom. Thousand of Americans of all
ages and all sections of this country have
come to value these courageous animals
as an important part of‘ our national
heritage and are deeply concerned for
their welfare and preservation This bill
provides protection for these bands of
horses and burros which once roamed
the West in lavish numbers but are now
in peril of total extinction. In calling for
_ their protection as a national heritage

these animals are thus removed from the
designation of “feral, ” a categorical

limbo that is neither wild nor domestic, ,

and relieves us of the semantical debates
which have plagued protection efforts in
the past.

During this century the wild horse and
burro population, now scattered through-
out 11 Western States, has been reduced
from over 2 million to less than 17,000 in
number. They have been cruelly captured
and slain and their carcasses used in the
production of (pet food and fertilizer.
They have been used for target practice
and harassed for “sport” and proﬁt. It
is the purpose 'of my bill to end this
senseless slaughter and. to provide these
descendants of the animals which played
, such a major role in the exploration and
settlement of the Great Plains and the

Far West with the' refugesand sanctu- .

aries they need and to place these ani-
mals under the protection of the Secre-
tary of the Interior. ,

Hundreds of schoolchildren through-
out this country, as well as scientists,
conservationists, and humanitarians,
plead for and demand Federal protection
for all» existing bands of wild horses and
burros doomed to vanish from our land
in less than. 10 years without immediate
and adequate congressional action to
provide for their welfare and safekeeping
in a balanced ecological habitat.

My bill requires the Secretary of the
Interior to establish and maintain a
minimum of 12 refuges with the advice
of a 'board of qualiﬁed scientists. Prece-
dent has‘ already been set with the ap-
pointment Of the Special Wild Horse Ad-.
visory Committee for the Pryor Moun-
tain Range, and the committee has func-
tioned most successfully in developing a

ests involved. Should these animals over-
populate, their existing habitat, the bill
allows the Secretary of the Interior, in
agreement with his advisory board, to

remove excess animals for sale to priVate '
individuals. However, no animals shall .

be disposed of inhumanely. .
Continuing development 0f the West
has forced the wild horses and burros
further and further into the most deso—
late parts of that vast area to escape the
increasing pressure of man. They have

WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, MARCH 4, 1971.

come into conﬂict with the livestock in-'

dustry which quite naturally wishes to
protect the forage on Federal land. The
bill provides a means of legal protection

for private or Government leased land- '3’

holders from intrusion on their property
by unWanted wild horses and burros
These landholders may Call the nearest

Federal marshal or appropriate oﬂicial,

of the Department of the Interior to

have the animals removed. Only these;

ofﬁcials are vested with the authority to
dispose of them. My bill also permits the
Secretary of the Interior to enter into

cooperative agreement with landowners ‘

and with State and local government;.
agencies to protect, manage, and con-
trol these specific animals on public
lands. The bill also speciﬁcally forbids

establishment of wild-horse ranges on ,
la d where these animals do not cur- ‘

re tly live. We are not attempting to
diminish forage for ranchers but simply
to protect the few wild horses and burros
which remain of the 2 million that
roamed the West at the turn of the
century.

The bill stipulates a fine of not more
than $2, 000 or imprisonment for not
more than a year, or both, for violations
of this act.

Time is running out for the vanishing
free- -roaming horses whiCh inhabit our
public land—~1and which belongs to all

the American people—a large segment

of whom have responded to the con-
tinuing plight of these majestic animals.
The voices of many in this country have
became loud and increasingly impatient

in their demand for strong Federal leg—
islation to protect these wild creatures
from certain extinction. I earnestly hope
that Congress will act without delay.
' I ask unanimous consent to have
printed in the RECORD a section-by-sec-
tion analysis of the bill. _
There being no objection, the analysis
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
as follows:

 

ANALYSIS OF BILL
SECTION 1

Section 1 states the various purposes Of the
Act. Speciﬁcally, it states that it is the sense
of the Congress that the few remaining free-

by the designation or establishment by the
Secretary of Interior of specific sanctuaries
on federal land for these animals.

SECTION 2

Section 2 deﬁnes “Secretary”, “wild free-
roaming horses and burros”, “ranges”,
“band”, and “herd”.

SECTION 3

horses and burros under the jurisdiction of
the Secretary of Interior, and directs him to
designate, establish, and maintain a mini—
mum of twelve sanctuaries for the protection
and preservation of existing bands of wild
horses and burros. It also provides means for
humane thinning of the herds where neces-
sary, and it speciﬁcally prohibits the killing
of these animals on the ranges by private
individuals.

ti-on, management, and
ee-roaming horses and
burros on public lands.

 




March 1,, 1971

(Mr. HATFIELD) and myself, I introduce

today a bill designed to protect the last _

of the wild horses and burros of the
United States—the living symbols of our
historic pioneer spirit and the nobility of

freedom. Thousand of Americans of all;

ages and all sections of this country have
come to value these courageous animals
as an important part of our national
heritage and are deeply concerned for
their welfare and preservation. This bill
provides protection for these bands of
horses and burros which once roamed
the West in lavish numbers but are now
in peril of total extinction. In calling for
their protection as a national heritage,
these animals are thus removed from the
designation of “feral,” a. categorical
limbo that is neither wild nor domestic,
and relieves us of the semantical debates
which have plagued protection efforts in
the past.

During this century the wild horse and
burro population, now scattered through—
out 11 Western States, has been reduced
from over 2 million to less than 17,000 in
number. They have been cruelly captured
and slain and their carcasses used in the
production of pet food and fertilizer.
They have been used for target practice
and harassed for “sport” and proﬁt. It
is the purpose of my bill to end this
senseless slaughter and to provide these
descendants of the animals which played
such a major role in the exploration and
settlement of the Great Plains and the
Far West with the refuges and sanctu-
aries they need and to place these ani-

mals under the protection Of the Secre—.

tary of the Interior. .

Hundreds of schoolchildren through-
out this country, as well as scientists,
conservationists, and humanitarians,
plead for and demand Federal protection
for all existing bands of wild horses and
burros doomed to vanish from our land
in less than 10 years without immediate
and adequate congressional actiOn to
provide for their welfare and safekeeping
in a balanced ecological habitat.

My bill requires the Secretary of the
Interior to establish and maintain a
minimum of 12 refuges with the advice
of a board of qualiﬁed scientists. Prece-
dent has already been set with the ap-
pointment Of the Special Wild Horse Ad-
visory Committee for the Pryor Moun-

tain Range, and the committee has func- ,

tioned most successfully in developing a
program that is acceptable to all inter-
ests involved. Should these animals over-_
populate, their existing habitat, the bill
allows the Secretary 'of the Interior, in
agreement with his advisory board, to
remove excess animals for sale to private
individuals. However, no animals shall
be disposed of inhumanely.

Continuing development of the West

has forced the wild horses and burros
further and further into the most deso-
late parts of that vast area to escape the
increasing pressure of man. They have
come into conﬂict with the livestock in-
dustry which quite naturally wishes to
protect the forage on Federal land. The

bill provides a means of legal protection

for private or Government leased land—
holders from intrusion on their property
by unwanted wild horses and burros.

These landholders may call the nearest

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —- SEN AT 1.

Federal marshal or appropriate Official
of the Department of p the Interior to
have the‘animals removed; Only these
officials are vested with the authority to
dispose Of them. My bill also permits the
Secretary of the Interior to enter into
cooperative agreement with landowners
and with State and local government
agencies to protect, manage, and con-
trol these speciﬁc animals on public
lands. The bill also speciﬁcally forbids
establishment of wild-horse ranges on
land where these animals do not cur-
rently live. We are not attempting to
diminish forage for ranchers but simply
to protect the few wild horses and burros
which remain of the 2 million that
roamed the West at the turn of the
century.

The bill stipulates a ﬁne of not more
than $2,000 or imprisonment for not
more than a year, or both, for violations

. of this act.

Time is running out for the vanishing
free-roaming horses which inhabit our
public land—land which belongs to all
the American people—a large segment
of whom have responded to the con-
tinuing plight of these maj esticanimals.
The voices Of many in this country .have
become loud and increasingly impatient
in their demand for strong Federal leg-
islation to protect these wild creatures
from certain extinction. I earnestly hope
that Congress will act without delay.

I ask unanimous consent to have
printed in the RECORD a section-by-sec-
tion analysis of the bill.

There being no objection, the analysis
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
as follows: 7

ANALYSIS OF BILL
SECTION 1

Section 1 states the various purposes Of the
Act. Speciﬁcally, it states that it is the sense
of the Congress that the few remaining free-
roaming wild horses and burros be given
protection as part of our national heritage.
It states that this end shall be accomplished
by the designation or establishment by the
Secretary of Interior Of speciﬁc sanctuaries
on federal landfor these animals.

SECTION 2

Section 2 deﬁnes “Secretary”,
roaming horses and burros”,
“band”, and “herd”.

SECTION 3

Section 3 places all wild free-roaming
horses and burros under the jurisdiction of
the Secretary of Interior, and directs him to
designate, establish, and maintain a mini-
mum Of twelve sanctuaries for the protection
and preservation of existing bands of wild
horses and burros. It also provides means for
humane thinning of the herds where neces-
sary, and it speciﬁcally prohibits the killing
Of these animals on the ranges by private
individuals.

SECTION 1 1

Section 11 provides the periodic reports by
the Secretary of the Interior to Congress ”with
respect to the administration of the Act ‘

By Mr. MAGNUSON (for himself

and Mr. JACKSON):
S. 1117 A bill to provide for regula-
tion of public exposure to sonic booms,

and for other purposes. Referred tothe _

Commi tee on Commerce.

Mr. GNUSON. Mr President, I in-
troduce for appropriate reference a bill
to provide for regulation of public ex-

posure to Sonic booms and to provide , _ i

that any future production models - of

American SST’S will comply with exist- -

ing noise standards applicable to new
subsonic jets. .

This bill is almost identical to S. 4547
which was passed by the Senate On
December2, 197.0 4

On April 15, 1970, the Department Of
Transportation ﬁled a notice of prO-'
posed ritlemaking to ban civil supersonic
ﬂight 0 ,er land. This proposed regula-
tion was published in the Federal Regis-
ter on April 16,1970—35 FR 6189. In
addition to \the ﬁling of this proposed

amendment to the Federal Aviation Reg- -

ulations the President of the United
States, the Seci‘etary of Transportation,
and other representatiVes of the admin-

istration have stated that commercial- ’

supersonic ﬂight OYCI‘ land will riot be
allowed. In spite of these assurances,

some critics have cantended that the v.

regulation might be changed or revoked
when commercial supersonic ﬂight be-
comes a reality. ‘~

To dispel these unjustiﬁed fears and

to assure the American peOple that there ‘
will be no overland ﬂights in this coun- ;
try by supersonic aircraft at Speeds caus- '

ing a sonic boom which could reach the
earth, in bill would adopt the language

of the D artment of Transportation’ s-r '

proposed regulation as legislation.

The prohibition, by law, of sonic booms
caused by ciVil supersonic aircraft over
land will not have any effect on the eco-
nomic viability Of the US. civil super-
sonic transport. The prototype program
has proceeded upon the assumption that
commercial supersonic ﬂight over land.
would not be allowed and all marketing

and economic projectibiis have been '

based on this assumption.

Once the two prototypes of the civil : .

supersonic aircraft have been developed;
and tested, a decision must be made by
the manufacturers of the aircraft and

the airlines as to whether commerc1al

tional interest. I am cOnﬁdent that the,

United States “fly before you buy” proto-
type program_will lead to the develop-
ment of a supersonic transport which
will be a technical, economic, and en-

. vironmental success. The US. supersonic

aircraft program has had the beneﬁt of
years of careful research and analysis
which will result in 'a product which is
far superior on all scores to those now
under production in England, France,
and Russia.

While I have the greatest conﬁdence in
the program and in the capability of the
manufacturers to produce a superior
aircraft, I feel that the decision of the
manufacturers and the airlines to enter
into commercial production after the
testing of the two prototypes is a deci—
sion in which the public has an interest.
Because of the public’s interest in this
decision, the bill would require the Sec-
. retary of Transportation to submit to
the Congress and to the public a report

covering all aspects of the prototype-

program upon the completion of the pro—
totype development and testing program.

The report shall include a detailed
analysis of potential environmental, eco-
nomic, and international consequences
that may result from production or non-
production of a US. civil supersonic air-
craft.

The report shall also make available
data on all other civilian supersonicair-
craft programs—including the Concorde
and the TU—144—which are in develop-
, ment or in commercial operation at that
time.

_ The report shall also set forth any rec-
ommendations for legislation or interna-
tional agreements which the Secretary
feels are necessary to insure a balanced
national transportation policy which is
efﬁcient, productive, economically and
environmentally sound. The Secretary’s
recommendations are not to be limited

' to the US. ciVil supersonic program but
shall include recommendations, where
appropriate, for any necessary regula-
tion of all civil supersonic aircraft that

, may have any effect on the United States.

I believe that such a report, with legisla-

tive recommendations will go far to as-

sure the American people that super-
sonic aircraft operations will be conduct-
ed under conditions which will insure
that such operations are compatible with
this Nation’s environmental standards,

that they are economic, and that they ‘

will result in important beneﬁts to the
Nation’s economy, to a balanced national

transportation policy, and to the Ameri- f

can people.

Mr. President, last year when S. 4547
‘was being debated on the ﬂoor of the
Senate, I offered an amendment to it
which was adopted which provides even
further environmental safeguards to the
public from noise problems which could
result from' commercial operations of
US. supersonic transports.

I believe the most important feature.

of this legislation is the incorporation of
this amendment. Basically, the amend-
ment of last year, which is inGOrporated
'in this bill in nearly identical fashion,
requires the Department of Transporta-
tion to modify its contracts with the con-
tractors producing the SST prototypes to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —'— SENATE

provide that those contracts willnot be
satisfactorily completed until the con-
tractors can demonstrate that all pro-

duction models of the US. SST devel-

oped from the prototype can comply with
the noise level standards which must be
met by the new generation of subsonic
aircraft soon to go into service such as
the McDonnell-Douglas DC—lO and the
Lockheed L—1011.

This means that the contractors must
proved that the production models of the
US. SST will be able to meet the same
noise standards, measured on takeoff,
descent, and at the sidelines, which are
being imposed upon new subsonic air-
craft. In more readily understandable
terms, it will mean that the contractors
must demonstrate that production
models of the US. SST will be quieter
than current jets now in service includ-
ing the Boeing 747‘which is at present
the quiestest of the large turbo jet trans-
ports.

Mr. President, in the past several
months signiﬁcant, noise reduction
breakthroughs have been made in the
SST developmental program. While in
November the Department and the con-
tractors expressed skepticism about de-'
veloping SST production models which
would meet the new noise standards, re-
cent new technological achievements now
make it apparent that the US. SST
can and will be as quiet an airplane as
any being developed today. While in
November the Department and the con-
tractors were opposed to the features
of this legislation because at that time
they did not believe the technology was
available to satisfy these noise standards,
today the Department and the industry
will support this bill because they are
conﬁdent that the production models of
the American SST will be able to meet
the requirements imposed by the legisla-
tion.

Mr. President on February 8, the Sec-
retary of Transportation, in a statement
prepared for a technical symposuim,
stated ﬂatly that noise problems associ-
ated with the SST could be solved before
any commitment would be made for com-
mercial production. I ask at this point
in the RECORD a summary of the Secre—
tary’s remarks, as released by the De-

partment of Transportation, be printed.

There being no objection, the summary
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
as follows:

STATEMENT FROM SECRETARY OF
TRANSPORTATION

Secretary of Transportation John A. Volpe

today said he believes the noise problems
associated with 'the US. supersonic trans-
port can be resolved before the plane goes
into commercial , production.

He pledged that the noise problems would
be solved before any commitments are made
for commercial production. '

The Secretary’s pledge came as'he key?

noted the Conference on Aircraft and the
Environment, sponsored jointly by the So-
ciety of Auto-motive Engineers and the De-
partment of Transportation.

“I would also like to emphasize that be-
fore we make a production commitment we
will demonstrate that the capability exists
for the commercial SST to achieve noise

'levels consistent with those required for

certiﬁcation of new four-engine, inter-con-
tinental, subsonic transport aircraft. I am

sure it can be done. I, for one, have faith
in. American technology and ingenuity,” Sec-
cretary Volpe said.

“Let me make it absolutely clear that I
will see to it that the production program
will not proceed—period—if tests of the pro-
totypes indicate serious damage to the fabric
of the natural world, or social problems that
we Can’t treat and assimilate.”

The Secretary based his statement on re-
cent testing which has revealed three signif-
icant breakthroughs in noise improvement,
resulting in a “dramatically improved out-
look” on the (SST noise posture.

The three developments, as described by
the Department’s Ofﬁce of SST Development,
are as follows:

Actual ground tests on the prototype en-
gine and detailed ﬂight performance analy-
sis have revealed signiﬁcantly less effective
perceived noise than was estimated initially.

Wing ﬂap tests in the NASA wind tunnel
have shown an improvement in lift and a
marked reduction 1 takeoff distance, there-
by improving the 'ltitude of the airplane
over the community during climbout.

Recent tests of advanced suppressors are
en-rcou aging in their acoustic and perform-_
ance characteristicsﬂ"

The combination Of these features, charac-
teristics and suppressor developments will
result in- achieving? a marked reduction in
SST engine noise. Through the aggressive
noise research and technology program be-
ing conducted by The Boeing Company and
General Electric, the capability to achieve
sideline noise levels well below those pre-
dicted a year ago vgalready has been demon-
strated. Airport (sideline) noise levels con-
sistent with those; required for new subsonic
jets are now a reasonable Objective, accord-
ing to Secretary Volpe.

,8. 11.19. A bill to authorize the Score-
tary of the Interior and the Secretary of
Agriculture to protect, manage, and con-
trol free- -r nd burros on
public lands. Referred to the Committee
on Interior and Insular Affairs.

CONTROL OF FREE-ROAMING HORSES AND
BURROS ON PUBLIC LANDS

Mr. MOSS. Mr. President, many in-
dividuals in this country are enormously
concerned about the protection and man-
agement of the many wild horses and
burros Which roam our Western States.

‘ I am one of them. They are part of our
natural heritage—a colorful, exhilarat-
ing part which I do not wish to lose.

A few of these horses carry traces of
the blood strains of the mustangs who
escaped from early Spanish explorers.
Many more of them are domestic stock
who have strayed from ranches and
farms, and now run wild with the herds
they joined. Not all of them are owner-
less, but cannot be identiﬁed by their
owners, and are claimed and branded
from time to time.

Whatever their origin, however, there
are probably some 25,000 of them in our-
10 Western States, and they- are vari-
ously considered as marauders who
threaten our domestic herds, as swift and

, colorful accessories of Our western scene,
or as nuisances who eat forage intended ’
for other livestock.

Last session I introduced a bill which

 




-5 fit/J3
'March 4,1971 '-

would have V protected—as an endan- -

gered species—any of the horses which

had a strain of mustang blood in them.

More study into the subject since the

. introduction of that bill has convinced A

me that' my approach was too limited,
and that a broader-based bill is needed.

I am, therefore, introducing today, for -

appropriate reference, a bill to author-

ize the Secretary of the Interior and the

Secretary of Agriculture to protect, man—
age, and control all free-roaming horses
and burros on public lands.

It is a very short bill, and I ask that

it be carried in full at the close of this.

statement. It would simply put under
the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the
Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture

all free-roaming horses .and burros on

public ' lands they administer, and di-

rect them to establish and maintain .-

ranges for the protection of those con-
sidered worthy of preserving as a na-
tional heritage. ' 4 ‘ ‘ '

In so doing, each Secretary would be
required to manage the ranges in such
a way that an ecological balance is
achieved among all fauna and ﬂora
and a free-roaming environment for the
horses and burros. Management may in-
clude measures necessary to
water and food for the animals.

Furthermore, each Secretary may en-
ter into cooperative agreements with
each other, (and with other local and
State agencies, as well as private land-

owners to carry out the provisions of'

the act, and would have the advice of a
advisory board in so doing. ‘
Mr. President, I, am under no illusion

that this bill is the ﬁnal answer to the '
problem of our free-roaminghorses and ~

. burros. I am sure itvwill not contain all
of the provisions some groups want, and
will contain provisions other groups can-
not approve. -
I am anxious and willing to listen to
those who share my concern about the

welfare of these animals, and also the—

welfare of the ranchers whose forage

they eat and the farmers whose crops .

they molest, and who are genuinely seek-
lmg a satisfactory solution to the prob-
em.

There being no objection, the bill Was
ordered to be printed-in the RECORD, as
follows:

Ms. Toni Ann Gardiner

Dear Ms. Gardiner;

Thank you for sending me your views regarding the
Alaska National Interest Lands issue.

As you know, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee
is presently considering the various options and programs
proposed by the President and others to deal with the ongoing
energy crisis. This consideration has been very time-
consuming, and the Committee has spent the bulk of its time
on these proposals. Because of this unanticipated workload,
the Committee's consideration of the Alaska lands issue will
be somewhat delayed.

I continue to feel that a legislative solution to the
Alaska lands situation is in the best interests of all
concerned. In this regard, I will urge the Committee to
report legislation which will balance the national interest
in preserving large areas of Federal lands in Alaska as
units of various conservation systems with the need to meet
the country's increasing demands for energy and renewable
resources. , '

I appreciate your interest in the work of the Committee.

Mrs. Erma L. Huebner

Dear Mrs. Huebner:

. Thank you for your recent communication concerning the
Alaska National Interest Lands bill.

On October 30, the Senate Committee on Energy and
Natural Resources ordered H.R. 39, as amended, reported to
the full Senate.

The Committee's version of H.R. 39 is very similar to
S. 9, which I introduced early this year. As ordered re-
“ported, the measure would designate approximately 103 million

acres of Federal land in Alaska for inclusion in various
conservation system units such as national parks, Wildlife

refuges, national forests, conservation areas, recreation
areas, and wild and scenic rivers.

In my View, the bill ordered reported by the Committee

strikes a reasonable balance between the need to protect
Alaska's superb scenic and wildlife values and the need to

tap the State's abundant natural resources.

Sincerely yours,

/:enry h. ,ff;£'
