ANIMAL WELFARE ACT
As Amended
(7 U.S.C.” SS..2131-2157)

Section 1. (a) This Act may be cited as the ”Animal Welfare Actl'f )

(b) The Congress finds that animals and activities which are regulated under this Act
are either in interstate or foreign commerce or substantially affect such commerce or the
free ﬂow thereof, and that regulation of animals and activities as provided in this Act is
necessary to prevent and eliminate burdens upon such commerce and to effectively regu-
late such commerce, in order—

(1) to insure that animals intended for use in research facilities or for exhi-
bition purposes or for use as pets are provided humane care and treatment;

(2) to assure the humane treatment of animals during transportation in
commerce; and

(3) to protect the owners of animals from the theft of their animals by pre-
venting the sale or use of animals which have been stolen.

The Congress further finds that it is essential to regulate, as provided in this Act, the
transportation, purchase, sale, housing, care, handling, and treatinent of animals by carri-
ers or by persons or organizations engaged in using them for research or experimental
purposes or for exhibition purposes or holding them for sale as pets or for any such pur-
pose or use. The Congress further finds that——

(1) the use of animals is instrumental in certain research and education for
advancing knowledge of cures and treatment for diseases and injuries which
afﬂict both humans and animals;

(2) methods of testing that do not use animals are being and continue to be
developed which are faster, less expensive, and more accurate than traditional
animal experiments for some purposes and further opportunities exist for the
development of these methods of testing;

(3) measures which eliminate or minimize the unnecessary duplication of
experiments on animals can result in more productive use of Federal funds; and

(4) measures which help meet the public concern for laboratory animal
care and treatment are important in assuring that research will continue to pro-

gress.

dealer, exhibitor, or operator of an auction sale subject to section 12 of this Act, has vio-
lated or is violating any provision of this Act, or any of the rules or regulations or stand-
ards promulgated by the Secretary hereunder, he may suspend such person’s license tem-
porarily, but not to exceed 21 days, and after notice and opportunity for hearing, may sus-

(b) Any dealer, exhibitor, research facility, intermediate handler, carrier or operator
of an auction sale subject to section 12 of this Act, that violates any provision of this Act, or
any rule, regulation, or standard promulgated by the Secretary thereunder, may be
assessed a civil penalty by the Secretary of not more than $2,500 for each such violation,

alleged violation, and the order of the Secretary assessing a penalty and making a cease
and desist order shall be final and conclusive unless the affected person ﬁles an appeal

good faith, and the history of previous violations. Any such civil penalty may be compro-
mised by the Secretary. Upon any failure to pay the penalty assessed by a final order
under this section, the Secretary shall request the Attorney General to institute a civil
action in a district court of the United States or other United States court for any district in
which such person is found or resides or transacts business, to collect the penalty, and
such court shall have jurisdiction to hear and decide any such action. Any person who
knowingly fails to obey a cease and desist order made by the Secretary under this section
shall be subject to a civil penalty of $1,500 for each offense, and each day during which
such failure continues shall be deemed a separate offense.

of an auction sale subject to section 12 of this Act, aggrieved by a ﬁnal order of the Secre-
tary issued pursuant to this section may, within 60 days after entry of such an order, seek
review of such order in the appropriate United States Court of Appeals in accordance
with the provisions of section 2341, 2343 through 2350 of Title 28, United States Code,
and such court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to enjoin, set aside, suspend (in whole or
in part), or to determine the validity of the Secretary’s order.

(d) Any dealer, exhibitor, or operator of an auction sale subject to section 12 of this
Act, who knowingly violates any provision of this Act shall, on conviction thereof, be sub-
ject to imprisonment for not more than 1 year, or a fine of not more than $2,500, or both.
Prosecution of such violations shall, to the maximum extent practicable, be brought ini-
tially before United States magistrates as provided in section 636 of Title 28, United States
Code, and sections 3401 and 3402 of Title 18, United States Code, and, with the consent of
the Attorney General, may be conducted, at both trial and upon appeal to district court, by
attorneys of the United States Department of Agriculture.

CHAPTER IV
.LABORATORY ANIMAL WELFARE

by Christine Stevens

Not until the end of 1985 when Senator Robert Dole
attached his bill, "Improved Standards fOr Laboratory
Animals," to the Farm Bill by unanimous consent of Senate and
House, did the United States achieve legislation comparablec\\
to that already in effect in 14 western EurOpean countrie l
for protection of animals used by scientific institutions.
The Farm Bill was signed by President Reagan two days before
Christmas, making the Improved Standards provisions ?ffi5tive
December 23, 1986, a year from the date of enactment.2

More than twenty years of intensive work was required to
reach the point at which the American Physiological Society,
major experimentalists, withdrew its Opposition to
legislation sought by animal protective organizations. The
Association of Professors of Medicine, too, accepted the
bill's provisions in the closing months of the struggle for
its passage.

Efforts which began in 1880 to regulate animal
experimentation in the United States are described in detail
from 1945 onward.

NINETEENTH CENTURY LABORATORY ANIMAL
PROTECTIVE PROPOSALS REBUFFED

In 1880, a bill to regulate animal experimentation in

the District of Columbia was introduced in Congress. Its

provisions were roughly similar to the British Cruelty to

 




OZ

Animals Act of 1876 which provided substantial protection

for experimental animals for more than a ceifgi> with the

approval of the British scientific communit . But American
scientists who were asked for their Opinions Opposed and
easily defeated this initial effort.

Between 1828 and 1898, nearly every st Texand territory
in the Union passed an anti—cruelty statut;:§/;>Fourteen of
these laws exempted animal experiments. Even the crusading
Henry Bergh, an outspoken anti—vivisectionist, agreed to the
exemption of experimental animals when he revised the New
York anti-cruelty law in 1867.

No prosecutions for cruelty to laboratory animals are
known during this period in states without such exemptions.
Not until the latter half of the twentieth century
(Massachusetts in 1958 and Maryland in 1982) were
anti-cruelty laws invoked on behalf of laboratory animals.
In the first case, the Massachusetts SPCA successfully
prosecuted a research scientist and animal caretaker for
cruelty in maintaining and transporting post—surgical dogs
outside the institution (the Overholt Clinic).

In Maryland Dr. Edward Taub was found guilty of 17
counts of cruelty to experimental monkeys at the Institute
for Behavioral Research. On appeal, the judgment was

reversed on grounds that the Maryland law was superseded by

the federal Animal Welfare Act.

LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY IN THE POST-SECOND WORLD WAR PERIOD

Virtually all bills relating to laboratory animals from

 




1945 to 1960 were inspired by the National Society for
Medical Research or one of its affiliates. Founded in
Chicago in 1945 by Dr. A. J. Carlson, Dr. Andrew C. Ivy, and
Dr. George Wakerlin, the NSMR devoted most of its efforts to
enactment of state laws requiring both humane society
shelters and public pounds to surrender dogs and cats on
request from scientific institutions for use in any type of
experiments or tests, no matter how painful and prolonged.
The first forced surrender law was passed in Minnesota
in 1948. Humane societies were unaware that the bill had
even been introduced before it had gone through both Houses
and been signed by the Governor. This law required release
of impounded animals from humane society shelters that
receive funds from taxes, as well as from municipal pounds.
In 1949 in Wisconsin, an even more severe seizure law was
passed, requiring any stray animal to be made available on
request to a scientific institution. Thus, shelters Operated
wholly by charitable funds were also compelled to supply
animals for experiments, regardless of the degree and

duration of pain and suffering inflicted. An attempt was

made to paSs similar legislation in Illinois, but here it

failed, and the individual communities were left in control
of local policies with respect to disposition of stray dogs

and cats.

Procurement laws passed in New York, South Dakota,
Oklahoma, Connecticut, Ohio, and Iowa did not attempt to

enact such far—reaching legislation.

 




6’

Robert Sellar, the President of the American Humane
Association, the national federation of humane societies, saw
the grave danger to the movement, whose organizational
structure in the late 1940's was especially susceptible to
demoralization through animal seizure legislation. Virtually
all the well-established humane societies centered their work
around shelters for lost or unwanted dogs and cats. If
forced to surrender animals for painful experiments, the
entire structure would lose its moral basis as a sanctuary
for animals where they would be safe from inflicted
suffering. These were dark days for organized animal
protection.

Mr. Sellar sought to reason with the National Society
for Medical Research in h0pes of finding a solution to the
demand for research dogs without undermining the morals of
the humane movement. A small AHA group met with an NSMR
group with the understanding that the preliminary talk would
not be publicized. But Mr. Ralph Rohweder, the Executive
Secretary of the NSMR, immediately sent out an announcement
calculated to inflame anti-vivisection societies and
anti-vivisectionist members of the American Humane
Association. Mr. Sellar lacked the power to resolve the
crisis manufactured by the NSMR, and henceforth, battles
raged in state after state to pass legislation compelling
humane societies to surrender dogs and cats to the
laboratories on demand and without controls on pain

infliction.

 




\5’

With the death of Robert Sellar came the end of real
efforts to face the problem and solve it. The influence of
a coterie of professional humanitarians-—the paid employees
of large societies who had a vested interest in the
continuance of their jobs——was not conducive to firm resolve.
They felt that they must avoid offending either anti—
vivisectionists, from whom their organizations might receive
large gifts and bequests, or scientific and medical groups,
whose powerful influence they feared. Thus it was that the
American Humane Association, normally eager for
contributions, declined an offered gift of $10,000 to study
and prepare a concerted plan for obtaining humane treatment
of research animals and a solution to the problem of supply
to laboratories.

Before his death, Mr. Sellar had appointed a new
director of the Hatignal Humane Beyiew, Fred Myers, a
newspaper man who was a reformer and an effective writer. He
attacked the NSMR for its policies of indiscriminate
procurement and use of animals. So telling were his
arguments that he was forbidden by AHA management, which was
heavily weighted against any energetic action, to use the
words "National Society for Medical Research" in any article
published in the National Humane Beyiew. Unwilling to submit
to such an arbitrary stifling of truthful reporting, Mr.
Myers resigned, together with two of the other three major
staff members: Helen Jones, Director of Education, and Larry

Andrews, Director of Field Services. All were appointees of

 




Robe t'Se lar, who had been replaced after his death by Mel

The National Humane Society was founded by the dissident
trio. The American Humane Association promptly sued them
to force them to change the society's name, which, it
claimed, was too similar to Eatignal Humane Review. The
result was the renaming of the new organization as the Humane
Society of the United States.

Nor was this the only legal action taken in the reform
effort. The first attempt to change the passive attitude of
the AHA came at the election of directors at the 1954 annual
meeting. The three reform candidates, Professor Roland Smith
of the Department of English, University of Illinois, Miss
J. M. Perry, an attorney from South Carolina, and Mr. Raymond
Naramore, a high school teacher who became the director of
the Rochester and Monroe County Humane Society, were promptly
elected by a delighted membership that had never before
exercised its prerOgatives. The controlling group of AHA
directors was dismayed. The following year they fought back,
first naming a meeting point in the Northwest where the
expense of travel would discourage the bulk of the
membership, concentrated in the East, from attending. Forced
by injunction to name a more central location for the

meeting, they resorted to bringing in large numbers of

persons never before associated with animal welfare work who

voted as a bloc on signal. The "in" group won and, not long

after, Miss Perry died, and Professor Smith resigned.

 




7

Mr. Naramore, limited to work on humane education for
schools, died a few years later.

Due to the failure of these and other attempts to bring
purpose and life into the AHA establishment at that time,
several new organizations were formed. The Animal Welfare
Institute was founded in 1951, its aim the advancement of the
welfare of all animals, with special emphasis on the research
animals so long neglected by humane organizations. Its
charter was drawn by Herbert Brownell, the distinguished New
York lawyer who served as Attorney General under President
Eisenhower.

The Humane Society of the United States was founded in
1954; and in 1959 one of its founders, Helen Jones, left the
parent body to found the National Catholic Society for Animal
Welfare, later renamed the International Society for Animal
Rights.

In 1952, after years of controversy, the Hatch-Metcalf
Act was passed. The Act amended an existing New York
laboratory animal care statute into a procurement law,
requiring all dog pounds and all humane societies receiving
public funds to surrender animals to scientific institutions.
The New York State Humane Association actively fought
enactment of the law; but its biggest, oldest member
organization, the American Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), whose board was dominated at that
time by research interests, refused to take a position. Its

president was Samuel Milbank of the Milbank Foundation.

 




The New York State Society for Medical Researc ,6 rcponents
of the law, dismissed all the other organizations as
anti—vivisection groups, thus ensuring passage of the law.
Both the Erie County Humane Society and the Humane
Society of Rochester and Monroe County immediately gave up
their pound contracts so that it would not be necessary for
them to release animals from their shelters to laboratories.
Only two organizations, the ASPCA and the Syracuse SPCA,
continued to accept tax funds and were thus required to send
d0gs and cats to scientific institutions. Between 1966 and
1974 when the Hatch—Metcalf Act was repealed, the Syracuse
SPCA delivered 14,000 dOgs and cats to Bristol-Myers, a
company with annual sales of more than a billion dollars.
Such was the power of the biomedical establishment at
the time that the ASPCA even went so far as to Oppose an
amendment offered just before the Hatch-Metcalf Act was
passed which would have authorized a representative of the

New York State Humane Association to accompany Health

Department inspectors on the rounds of laboratory animal

rooms. The ASPCA was a member of the New York State Humane
Association, but it joined the New York State Society for
Medical Research in fighting the humane inspection, which, it
was claimed, "would emasculate the bill." The amendment was
defeated, ensuring that inspection under the Hatch-Metcalf
Act was a whitewashing Operation. A few examples:

1953: A Health Department inspector took AWI

representatives through Cornell Medical School
explaining how excellent the care for the animals

 




7

was while passing by a dog whose incision had
Opened allowing his internal organs to fall onto
the floor of the cage.
AWI was called to inspect the animal quarters at
St. Vincent's Hospital where gross filth and
massive infestation of ticks, roaches, and other
insects were found.
AWI was called by a secretary in New York
University Dental School about epizootics which
were running through the animal colonies due to
the fact that wild rodents were fouling the
cages, and cleaning was put off for so long that
there was scarcely a clear spot to set foot in
the dog runway.

All these institutions received dogs from the ASPCA and
were inspected and certified by the Health Department and
also by ASPCA employees who visited at the invitation of the
laboratories. When the federal Laboratory Animal Welfare Act
was passed in 1966, the ASPCA ended even the gesture of
sending inspectors to laboratories but continued to supply
them with dogs and cats until 1971.

In 1976, a reform movement swept the ASPCA, permanently
ending the supply of dOgs and cats from its shelters to
laboratories. In 1977, the New York Assembly voted 126—14 to
repeal the Hatch—Metcalf Act. Connecticut and Ohio also
repealed similar acts.

This type of legislation has proved itself a failure.
The claims issued for its enactment, to the effect that dog
dealing and stealing would cease if animals were available to
laboratories from humane societies and pounds, were proven
false in the most dramatic way by the very case which set in

motion the enactment of the Laboratory Animal Welfare Act. A

dog was bought by a New York hospital from a Pennsylvania dog

 




dealer, although the hospital was entitled to free dogs from
the ASPCA. In other states, too, which passed animal seizure
legislation, laboratories often have not taken advantage of
the law, preferring to buy from dealers.

Thirteen states PEthDiE the release of impounded

animals to research facilities: Connecticut, Delaware,

Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New

Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina;>

u"... —-v~ awn,

‘ W...— .W

Vermont, and West Virginia. Of these, Massachusetts is the
only state which specifically prohibits the sale of pound
animals brought in from other states as well: "No person,
institution, animal dealer, or their authorized agent shall
transport . . . any animal obtained from any municipal or
public pound, public agency, or d0g officer . . . into the
commonwealth for purposes of research, experimentation,
testing, instruction or demonstration" (Ch. 140, Sec. 174D,
1983).

Release of impounded animals for research purposes is
ggggiggg in the District of Columbia, Iowa, Minnesota,
Oklahoma (by pounds only; shelters may release animals for
research), South Dakota, and Utah.

Release of impounded animals for research use is allowed
in Arizona, California, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio,
Tennessee, and Wisconsin.

Recent efforts to repeal Minnesota's law requiring
release of animals from pounds to research facilities have

been unsuccessful. However, a law was enacted in 1987 which

 




provides for inspections of animal dealers by the Minnesota
Board of Animal Health as well as the U. S. Department of
Agriculture, requires dealers to post signs informing the
public that they sell animals to laboratories, and Opens
dealers' premises to the public to enable pet owners to
search for lost or stolen pets. A fine of $1,000 will be
imposed on any individual selling a d0g or cat to a research
facility without the permission of the owner.

The State of Washington enacted a law in 1989 to prevent
pet theft. Research animal dealers who sell stolen dOgs or
cats to scientific institutions or who pose as ad0pters of
animals responding to "free to good home" classified ads may
now be punished by a fine of $10,000 and 5 years in jail.
Research facilities are required to maintain a file on each
dog and cat, including certification of the animal's origin,
a photograph, and a physical description of the animal,
available for public inspection.

REGULATORY PROPOSALS STALLED IN COMMITTEE
BY MEDICAL LOBBYISTS

Between the years 1960 and 1966, a great deal of effort
was devoted to unsuccessful attempts to pass legislation
based on the principles of the British Act of 1876. But

public interest in the treatment of laboratory animals was

growing, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) decided

to contract for a study by Dr. David N. Ruth and Mr. Robert
W. Cox on "The Care and Management of Laboratory Animals Used

in the Programs of the Department of Health, Education and

 




/a2/

Welfare" (DHEW). Submissions were widely solicited, and both
the Animal Welfare Institute and Society for Animal
Protective Legislation presented documentation on visits to
laboratories. AWI's "Critical Review of Conditions in
Institutions Receiving Funds Under DHEW Auspices" documented

the following:

1. Cages too small for animals to stand or
lie in normal position.

2. Failure to administer pain-relieving drugs
after surgery.

3. Failure to destroy suffering, moribund
animals.

4. Failure to supervise animals after surgery.

5. Failure to provide a comfortable resting
place for animals.

6. Repeated use of the same animal for painful
procedures.

7. Failure to provide water.

8. Failure to identify animals.

9. Immobilization of unanesthetized animals.
10. Filth.

A 210—page volume was produced, but NIH, dismayed by the
extensive evidence of mistreatment and neglect of laboratory
animals and the obvious need for regulatory legislation
revealed by the study, quickly withdrew it. Hundreds of
c0pies were secreted in a storeroom. Senator Clark, however,
demanded and got a c0py.

The first bill ever introduced in the United States
Congress to regulate animal experimentation was sponsored by

Senators John Sherman C00per, Mike Mansfield, E. L. Bartlett,

 




/3

Robert C. Byrd, Frank Church, Estes Kefauver, wayne Morse,
William Proxmire, Jennings Randolph, Ernest Gruening, Pat
McNamara, Harrison Williams, and Joseph S. Clark. The bill
was written by Abe Fortas and introduced at the request of
the Society for Animal Protective Legislation. As soon as
this bill was introduced, the National Anti-Vivisection
Society and National Society for Medical Research, normally
at each other's throats, found themselves in agreement:
there must be no regulation of animal experimentation. When
hearings were held two years later in the House of
Representatives, Major Charles Hume, founder of the
Universities Federation for Animal Welfare of Great Britain,
emphasized the fact that, poles apart though they were, these
two groups actually corresponded with a view to helping each
other defeat regulatory legislation.

Opponents thought they had buried regulatory
legislation, and in that Committee they had. But they
reckoned without the disappearance of a Dalmatian dog named
Pepper and the response of the House Agriculture Committee.

The Humane Society of the United States, under the
direction of Fred Myers, insisted that the British Act was
not sufficiently strong and gave its support to the Moulder
bill. The American Humane Association remained silent and,
when pressed, said it was studying the matter. When
Congressman Kenneth Roberts held two days of hearings on
Griffiths and Moulder bills, the AHA sent no one to testi ~

Medical research groups and anti—vivisection groups

 




/%

Opposed the bills; the National Catholic Society for Animal
Welfare said it would support the Moulder bill if it were
amended to eliminate all pain infliction. Significant
statements were made by scientists and medical men who
supported the Griffiths bill (identical to the Clark—
Neuberger bill in the Senate) based on the principles of the
British Act, and also by knowledgeable Britons who had worked
under the Act and could testify from firsthand experience as
to its workability and effectiveness in preventing animal
suffering without hampering research.

The American Medical Association felt differently,
however, and editorialized about what it termed "humaniacs."
An objective and authoritative voice was heard from England
when the Report of the Departmental Committee on Experiments
on Animals was presented to Parliament by the Secretary of
State for the Home Department, April 1965.

The Committee, under the chairmanship of Sir Sydney
Littlewood, held hearings over a two—year period to review
the working of the British Act, giving every individual and
group who desired to be heard an Opportunity. The resulting
"Littlewood Report," a remarkable testimony to fairness and
good judgment, surveying every aspect of animal
experimentation, of the treatment of the animals, and of
procurement, recorted the views of scientists, of the public,
and of group. as d verse as the Universities Federation for
Animal Welfar- 8 w ose scientific approach is well known, and

anti—vivisection organizations seeking abolition of all

 




/5

experimentation on animals. The most widely quoted paragraph
in the 255—page Report is the first of the General Findings:
"Animal experiment is a complex and highly Specialised
subject. It is also a moral and social problem of the first
magnitude and one that does not exclusively concern the
expert."

The "Littlewood Report" was referred to repeatedly by
two distinguished medical men who flew to the United States
to testify at hearings held September 30, 1965, before the
House Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee:

Dr. Lawrence Abel, former Vice President of the Royal College
of Surgeons of England and Consulting Surgeon to the
Institute of Cancer Research, Royal Cancer Hospital, and Sir
Graham Wilson, former Director of the Public Health Service.

Speaking of the inspectorate under the British Act, Sir
Graham said:

The Act is administered by the Home Office

and is enforced by specially appointed inspectors

possessing a medical or veterinary qualification.

Their main purpose is regulatory and educational

rather than disciplinary. In their visits to the

laboratories they satisfy themselves about the

suitability of the conditions under which the

animals are kept and of the general well—being

of the animals themselves; they may assure

themselves that the license holder is fully

aware of what he is permitted and not permitted

to do; and they make useful suggestions for

overcoming difficulties of one sort or another.

Dr. Abel, speaking of the three principles--licensing,
inspection, and the pain rule-—said:

The third British Principle is the Pain Rule.

This sets the limit to the amount of suffering which

may be inflicted. We do not commit the atrocities
which are reported from time to time in some other

 




/é

countries. We do not allow the extravagant cruelty
committed by some investigators of stress and shock.
We have proved that the desired results can be
obtained by less inhumane methods. We are convinced
that the freedom of all and sundry to use animals
indiscriminately would not improve the value of
research.

The hearings of the Health Subcommittee o the House

Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee t whi h Sir Graham

and Dr. Abel testified were never published cheduled as

two-day hearings, they were abruptly canceled the morning of
the second day and never rescheduled by Chairman Paul Rogers,
now a consultant for the National Association for Biomedical
Research (NABR). The biomedical establishment apparently
considered it dangerous to expose the public to facts about

successful regulation of animal experiments.

RESNICK BILL BYPASSES THE HEALTH COMMITTEES

On July 3, 1965, Fay Brisk, a long—term campaigner for
reform of the big Pennsylvania dog dealers, called the Animal
Welfare Institute for help to try to get Pepper back to her
owners, the Lakavage family. Mr. Lakavage, in the hospital
with a heart attack, saw Pepper's photograph together with
seventeen other dOgs and two goats that had been temporarily
unloaded from a Pennsylvania dog dealer's overcrowded truck.
Mrs. Lakavage and the three young Lakavages set off in
pursuit of Pepper, who, allegedly, had been taken to a big
New York State dog dealer, Nersesian. When the exhausted
family arrived, Nersesian refused them entry.

Senator Clark of Pennsylvania, a well-established

fighter for animal protection and chief sponsor of pending

 




/7

legislation to require humane treatment of experimental
animals, was out of town, but Sara Ehrmann, his Legislative
Assistant, responded to the AWI call for help by telephoning
Congressman Resnick's office in the District where
Nersesian's dog farm was located. Even Congressional
intercession failed, however; and Resnick, angered by
Nersesian's high—handed refusal to admit the family to find
their missing pet, decided he would introduce a bill to
prevent such wrongs.

Meantime, pressure by the State Police brought an
admission from the Pennsylvania dog dealer that he had taken
his load not to Nersesian, as he first had said, but directly
to Montefiore Hospital in New York. Immediately, Fay Brisk
telephoned the hospital, could hear the rattling of the dog
tags at the other end of the phone, then the news: the dOg
had died on the Operating table the day before and already
had been incinerated. The dog dealer insisted the dog was
not Pepper——the evidence was incinerated-—but the call for
female Dalmatians, put out by the hospital to dealers rather
than to breeders, had led to introduction of the Resnick bill
on July ninth. The Resnick bill, written by attorneys of the
United States Department of Agriculture, required that
dealers in dogs and cats and the laboratories that purchased
them be licensed, inspected, and adhere to humane standards
set by the Secretary of Agriculture. A companion bill was
introduced in the Senate by Senator Warren G. Magnuson,

Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, and Senator Clark,

 




/00

who came to the Senate floor at the same moment to introduce
identical bills. In a brief colloquy they agreed to
co—sponsor, and Senator Daniel Brewster of Maryland joined
them.

On September fifth, Congressman W. R. Poage of Texas,
Chairman of the Livestock Subcommittee of the House
Agriculture Committee, held hearings on the Resnick bill. He
was the first American legislator to hold hearings on
laboratory animal legislation with a view to enacting it. He
had won passage of the Humane Slaughter Act in 1958, and was
destined to win again for laboratory animals. Not easily,
however. The bill was immediately attacked as
anti-vivisectionist by the National Society for Medical
Research, which described it as a "pincers movement" to cut
off the supply of animals for laboratories.
Anti-vivisectionist groups, however, took but little interest
in the matter. The demand for action came from the general
public, outraged by the article in Life magazine showing Stan
Wayman's photographs of the shocking abuse of dogs in the
dealers' hands.

The Life article was set in motion by Henry Luce after he
looked over a collection of photographs supplied by the
Animal Welfare Institute, many of them taken by photographers
accompanying AWI Laboratory Animal Consultant, Dorothy Dyce.
Under the supervision of Life's Nature Editor, Pat Hunt, the
article was completed and published February 4, 1966. More

mail was received by Life on this article than on any other

 




W

in the history Of the magazine, and Congress received more
mail on the pending bills than on civil rights or Vietnam.

In the face of such demand, the Opponents began to
modify their Opposition. When Congressman Poage introduced
the Committee bill, extending coverage to all vertebrate
animals, and Senator Hugh Scott Of Pennsylvania introduced an
identical bill in the Senate, the Opponents concentrated on
exempting scientific institutions from the humane standards
and on cutting back the number Of Species covered. The Poage
bill came unscathed through the Subcommittee, but the full
House Agriculture Committee cut it down to dOgs and cats in
dealers' premises only. Laboratory interests thus won a
temporary victory and, no doubt, believed they could continue
to keep the Objective veterinary inspectors Of the U. S.
Department Of Agriculture out of scientific institutions.

After the House passed the weakened version Of the Poage
bill, a Senate Commerce Committee staff draft accomplished a
comparable weakening of the bills introduced by Senators
Magnuson, Clark, Brewster, and Scott. Again, laboratory
interests made a stab at getting themselves exempted, but
they had reckoned without Senator Monroney, who, as soon as
he read the draft, prepared an amendment restoring coverage
Of animals inside scientific institutions. Newspapers
throughout the country supported the Monroney Amendment in
emphatic terms. SO hotly debated was the issue that a second
set Of hearings was scheduled in the Senate Commerce

Committee on May 25, 1966.

 




30

For six years the National Institutes of Health and its
parent Department of Health, Education and Welfare had
Opposed all moves toward effective legislation for humane
treatment of research animals. Suddenly, when it became
clear that such Opposition could no longer stem the demand
for action, NIH asked Senator Lister Hill, Chairman of
the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, to introduce a
bill written by NIH itself providing a self-policing system
for laboratories. Meanwhile, its representatives urged
exemption of laboratories from the straightforward, humane

Senate Commerce Committee bill.

 




02/ ”048,02 "

Neither the Committee nor the Senate as a whole could be
brought to support this maneuver. The Washington Evening

Star stated editorially:

THE ANIMAL CRUELTY BILLS

Congress at last is headed toward enactment of
a law to require humane treatment of animals used in
laboratory research and to halt thefts of pets by
dealers supplying this market. At the eleventh
hour, however, a snag has been encountered in the
Senate Commerce Committee. Medical researchers,
hostile to government supervision, (but not
government grants, it should be added), are
attempting a switch play. A bill introduced by
Senator Hill of Alabama would head off federal
inspection of how laboratories treat animals
awaiting experiments. Instead this authority would
be given to a private group.

The medical men, in fact have such a group all
ready and waiting. Set up last year, it is called
the American Association for Accreditation of
Laboratory Animal Care. Its members are of the
establishment; and are staff members of medical
schools and research institutions. And, as the
association's brochure suggests, the 'inspections'
would be rather friendly affairs.

There would be no surprise audits, such as
those routinely carried out now in the banking
industry, for example. Instead a visit would be
scheduled by 'mutual convenience.‘ It would not
come distressingly often——no more than once every
five years. The inspectors, according to the
brochure, would charge fees ranging up to $1,000
for their trouble.

If the laboratories are in fact treating their
animals humanely, they should have nothing to fear
from a pr0posal by Senator Magnuson of Washington
that such inspections be made by the Department of
Agriculture after standards have been published. His
bill has nothing to do with the anti-vivisectionists;
the government would not interfere with any laboratory
tests or Operations.

Certainly the public should not be deluded into
thinking the Hill prOposal represents any kind of
adequate substitute for impartial inspection of such
institutions.

 




0202

Senator Magnuson had made plain his determination to
report a bill out of his Committee. The National Society for
Medical Research and National Institutes of Health,
therefore, concentrated on trying to get the laboratories
exempted from compliance with humane standards set by the
United States Department of Agriculture and inspection by its
representatives. Glowing references to the American
Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care
(AAALAC), for whose existence Dr. Maurice Visscher, President
of the NSMR, took credit, were a stock in trade; and at the
final Senate Commerce Committee hearings, representatives of
the NIH and NSMR strongly supported the NIH bill and Opposed
the Monroney Amendment. Testimony was limited to medical
witnesses at this hearing; and two courageous physicians, who
had been associated for years with efforts to obtain humane
treatment of laboratory animals, came to Washington to
testify for the Monroney Amendment: Dr. Nicholas Gimbel,
Chief of Surgery at MetrOpolitan Hospital and Associate
Professor of Surgery at Wayne University Medical School, and
Dr. Bennett Derby, Head of NeurolOgy at Veterans
Administration Hospital in Manhattan and Assistant Professor
of Neurology at New York University Medical School. Dr.
Gimbel and Dr. Derby urged the Senate Committee to provide
for humane care and housing of animals in research
institutions. They emphasized that the Department of
Agriculture is the ideal agency to administer such

requirements. Dr. Gimbel, who had devoted considerable time

 




(7’25

to getting better treatment for experimental dogs in
different institutions, brought the question down to earth by
stating that if he were a dog, he would prefer to have the
Department of Agriculture administer the law. He said the
"welfare of animals should be the responsibility of a body
which is primarily interested in them . . . the Department of
Agriculture," and he added: "If the scientists and
organizations represented in AAALAC had done their job
prOperly, we would not be holding hearings here today. The
time has come to bring in independent auditors." The NIH
bill did not come to hearings.

The Senate Commerce Committee bill, under the leadership
of Senator Magnuson and Senator Monroney, received unanimous
endorsement by the Senate. Eighty—five Senators came to the
floor to vote for it, and each of the fifteen who were absent
and unable to vote stated in The gngrgssigna; Beggrd that
they would have voted for it had they been present. The
bill's sanctions were strengthened at the insistence of
the House Conferees. They agreed to accept the Senate
amendments restoring humane care and housing of animals
inside laboratories and increasing the number of Species of
animals covered, on condition that the stronger House
enforcement clauses be adOpted.

Regulations were promulgated by the Secretary of
Agriculture February 24; and the law went into effect for

animal dealers May 25 and for scientific institutions August

24, 1967.

 




02%

Congress broadened and strengthened this first federal
law to prevent abuses of test animals in 1970, 1976, and
1985. The 1966 Laboratory Animal welfare Act (fiercely
contested by medical and pharmaceutical interests and the
associated industries that sell animals, cages, and equipment
to scientific institutions) set humane standards for doqs,
cats, primates, rabbits, hamsters, and guinea pigs in animal
dealers' premises and in laboratories prior to experimental
use of animals. In 1970, the coverage was extended to the
entire stay of animals in laboratories where they must be
maintained according to minimum standards set by the
Secretary of Agriculture. The veterinary care required
includes "apprOpriate use of anesthetic, analgesic, and
tranquilizing drugs." All warm—blooded animals designated by
the Secretary are covered, but neither birds, farm animals
used in research, nor those species that constitute the large
majority of the millions of experimental animals used each
year-—mice and rats——have yet been designated. Because
inadequate apprOpriations have had to be stretched to cover
inspections of thousands of sites in laboratories, licensed
animal dealers, licensed exhibitors, registered exhibitors,
and carriers under the Act as amended, no Secretary has been
willing to include more animals for inspectors to check;
however, in 1986 the Animal Legal Defense Fund prepared a
brief contending that the Act requires him to do so.

The important requirement for pain-relieving drugs and

reporting on their use or lack thereof was added in 1970.

 




£5

Reports by registered scientific institutions on use of
animals are filed with the U. S. Department of Agriculture
and are available for public scrutiny under the Freedom of
Information Act. Many institutions have failed to honor this
section of the Act, necessitating additional legislative and
enforcement action.

Under the 1976 amendments sponsored by Agriculture
Committee Chairman Thomas Foley, research institutions were
moved to the same category as exhibitors and dealers with
respect to the imposition of fines for violations.
Previously, research facilities were subject to a cease and
desist order which they would have to violate before a fine
could be imposed. The 1976 amendments also include a
requirement that agencies of the federal government submit
proof that they are in compliance with the standards which
private institutions must meet under the eyes of veterinary
inspectors of the U. S. Department of Agriculture's Animal
and P1 ealth Inspection Service. Representative Margaret
Heckle 10 prOposed and was successful in obtaining this
essential advance on the floor of the House.

The Animal welfare Act now constitutes a solid,
broad—based structure whose 1976 amendments, sponsored in the
Senate by Senator Lowell Weicker, cover transportation of
animals for research, exhibition, the pet trade, by common
carriers and intermediate handlers. Its anti—dog fighting
and cock-fighting provisions are detailed in Chapter IX.

The 1970 reporting requirements on painful experiments

 




2960

focused on the responsibility of the institutional
veterinarian to prevent suffering through humane experimental
design or through use of drugs to relieve pain or anxiety.
However, enforcement in this area has been virtually nil.

The 1985 amendments, which should have gone into effect
December 23, 1986, remain to be tested in practice because of
the long delay, caused by anti-animal lobbyists, in the

promulgation of final regulations to implement the law.

COMMERCIAL DEALERS AND BREEDERS

The laboratory animal industry, supplying millions of
animals to institutions at ever increasing prices, is
intensely Opposed to regulatory legislation that affects them
and their clients. In 1979, it Spawned the National
Association for Biomedical Research (NABR) and the Foundation
for Biomedical Research (FBR) to rival the National Society
for Medical Research, which they entirely absorbed and
supplanted in a few years. NABR now orchestrates Opposition
to all laws and regulations for laboratory animal welfare.
Formation of the organizations was, according to executive
Frankie Trull, conceived in her living room. Henry Foster,
the veterinarian who built a two-room rat breeding business
into the multimillion dollar international laboratory animal
production corporation, Charles River Breeding Laboratories,
and his son, an attorney, wrote the necessary legal papers.
Ms. Trull, an employee of Charles River, set about lining up
support among commercial and academic laboratories.

Meanwhile, Charles River was sold to the big Optical

 




£7

company, Bausch and Lomb, netting Dr. Foster about $38
million personally, according to press reports. The pun—
filled, full—page ads offering monkeys, guinea pigs, rabbits,
and other animals for sale have become more sober and
strait—laced, but the intensive campaign to market the
maximum numbers of animals for experimentation continues
under the new ownership. Charles River has installations in
France, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom.

Breeding animals for sale to laboratories is big
business, and corporations change hands in transactions based
wholly on financial considerations. One of the largest dog
breeders, LRE, which houses several thousand dogs on its
premises, was recently sold to Hazelton, which conducts
toxicity tests on contract for other institutions as well as

breeding dogs and other laboratory animals.

ALTERNATIVES TO LABORATORY ANIMALS

As numbers of animals used in experiments and tests grew
by the million, a countervailing philos0phy was increasingly
advocated by animal protective organizations. The first
serious contribution to the field was The Bringiples of
Humans Experimental Teghniguer by W- M- 8. Russell and
R. L. Burch, produced under the aegis of the Universities
Federation for Animal Welfare in 1959, with some modest

assistance from AWI. This pioneering book established the

Three R's—~Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement-—which are

now generally recognized as fundamental elements necessary to

prevent large-scale unnecessary suffering by laboratory

 




300

animals. While Russell and Burch stressed the scientifically
feasible, others advocated "Alternatives Nowl", claiming that
substitutes for animals already existed for all experiments
and tests. Bills introduced in Congress reflected different
views of the subject, but they made up, if not a critical
mass, solid evidence of public concern and hOpe.

By 1981, seven bills on alternatives and/or regulation
of animal experiments were pending in the Subcommittee on
Science, Research and TechnolOgy of the House Committee on
Science and Technology. On October 13 and 14, 1981,
Subcommittee Chairman Doug Walgren of Pennsylvania held
hearings, which drew unexpectedly wide media attention
because Maryland police had removed 17 monkeys just days
earlier from a Silver Spring laboratory. There they had
been experimented on by Dr. Edward Taub under grants from the
National Institutes of Health. Dr. Taub and an associate
were charged with 17 counts of cruelty for failing to supply
veterinary care. Alex Pacheco, who had worked at the
Institute for Behavioral Research as a volunteer and had
alerted police to conditions there, showed horrifying
pictures of the monkeys and their quarters at the hearings.

Drafting of a composite bill containing some features
from each of the seven pending pr0posals was undertaken by
the Subcommittee staff. Advice was sought from the many
organizations which had testified pro- or con- the different
bills. On August 4, 1982, Congressman Walgren prOposed the

new bill, which was approved by his Subcommittee and its

 




0??

parent Committee. The bill was referred to the House
Committee on Energy and Commerce, Subcommittee on Health and
the Environment, and hearings were held by Chairman Henry
Waxman of California on December 9, 1982.

Senator Robert Dole introduced a bill based on the
principles deve10ped in the October hearings. Senator John
Melcher of Montana, the Congress' only veterinarian, joined
him. Together, they appeared at the Waxman hearings and
testified for the Walgren bill, an unusual tribute to the
importance of the legislation. However, no action was taken

before the 97th Congress adjourned.

THE DOLE—BROWN AMENDMENTS

When Senator Dole reintroduced his bill in 1983, he had
it redrafted as an amendment to the Animal Welfare Act, thus
broadening its coverage to include all Registered
Research Facilities (over 1,200) inspected by USDA.

This wise decision encouraged consideration by
scientific groups who began a slow move from point—blank
Opposition to demands for a variety of modifications in the
language of the bill. At hearings of the full Senate
Agriculture Committee, chaired by Senator Dole July 20,
nearly every witness had scientific qualifications. Humane
groups were represented by Bennett Derby, M.D., Ph.D., who
had appeared at the crucial hearings which led to unanimous
Senate passage of the original Act.

Senator Dole's masterful handling of the hearings paved

the way for action, but it was not to come in the 98th

 




50

Congress. Opponents tried a new tack, questioning the need
for the Dole bill. The Society for Animal Protective
Legislation prepared two thick binders of documentation
outlining the urgent need for all the bill's provisions for
minimizing pain and distress and strengthening the authority
of Agriculture's veterinary inspectors.

Congressman George E. Brown, Jr. of California, well
known for his successful sponsorship of the 1978 humane
slaughter amendments (see chapter III), introduced a bill
based on the Dole bill, H. R. 5725. On September 19, 1984,
he chaired hearings in his Subcommittee on Departmental
Operations, Research and Foreign Agriculture which drew a
standing—room—only crowd with long lines waiting outside the
hearing room. Interest in the legislation had been
heightened by revelations of severe mistreatment of
experimental baboons at the University of Pennsylvania
Medical School. Sixty hours of self—incriminating videotapes
taken by a research team as a record of their experiments
showed virtually every rule of aseptic surgery being
violated. Injured baboons were painfully dangled and
ridiculed by groups of laughing students.

The tapes were stolen by a group known as the
Animal Liberation Front and given to PeOple for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals. They made a 25-minute version to show
the public. It was run repeatedly in a nearby church on the
day of the hearings.

Henry Mitchell's column in The WQShiDgLQQ Egg; September

 




21, 1984 notes: "Savagery is very much part of the nature of
all humans I have ever known, and that is one reason
civilized nations have gone to such efforts to restrain it or
redirect it." Citing the evidence and characterizing it as
sickening, he wrote: "Legislation is needed, and those who
do not wish to concern themselves with what amounts to
flamboyant sadism should at least have the grace not to
obstruct the long hard thankless labors of those who have not
shied from the evidence and who have at last come up with
reasonable and moderate legislation." Describing his
feelings in watching five minutes of the tapes in St. Mark's
Church, he concluded: "I left thinking it probably an
esthetic error to vomit in a church."

Documentation of neglect and abuse in laboratories
throughout the entire country was derived from official
reports of USDA veterinary inspectors obtained under the
Freedom of Information Act and presented by the Society for
Animal Protective Legislation in the form of a 6'x10' chart.
A heartening message of support from Dr. Jean Mayer,
President of Tufts University, was delivered by Dr. Frank
Loew, Dean of the College of Veterinary Medicine, but most
testimony from scientific groups was severely critical.
Congressman Brown asked his staff to analyze all the

criticisms. His bill did not emerge from the Subcommittee.

Meantime, in the Health and Environment Subcommittee,

Congressman Walgren had succeeded in getting some provisions

of his bill included in the NIH reauthorization bill which

 




302/

was passed by the Congress but vetoed by President Reagan.

In the 99th Congress, the bill, after some modification and
entitled the Health Research Extension Act of 1985, was
passed again and Congress overrode the President's second
veto. The animal welfare provisions are less stringent than
the Dole—Brown legislation, and they apply only to NIH
grantees; nevertheless, the two were destined to fit together
well and reinforce one another in a practical manner.

Senator Dole, elected Majority Leader of the Senate,
reintroduced his bill at the same time as Congressman Brown.
This time the bills were identical, the heroic work of
staffers Sara Rasmussen for Brown and Mark Scanlan for Dole.
They produced a final draft still containing every major
animal protective provision, phrased in the manner least
objectionable to the legion of Opponents and unremitting
critics.

The New ngg Iimee editorialized on July 31, 1985 in
support of the Dole—Brown prOposals, and in the following
months, neWSpapers in every part of the country followed
suit.

The debate on the 1985 Farm Bill was continuing when the
Majority Leader brought his bill, Improved Standards for
Laboratory Animals, to the Senate floor, October 25.

Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, Chairman of the Committee
on Labor and Human Resources, expressed reservations. The
bill then went into an intense discussion by the staffs of

Senators Dole, Hatch, and Melcher and representatives of the

 




j;

National Association for Biomedical Research (NABR), the Feed
Manufacturers Association, and the Society for Animal
Protective Legislation. A bill calling for 16 different
changes in Senator Dole's bill had been prepared for Senator
Hatch by an NABR attorney. Every point had to be fought
through. Senator Dole appeared from time to time to ask what
prOgress was being made. At one point, Senator Melcher took
part in the arguments, explaining the reason for his
language, "a physical environment adequate to promote the
psychological well-being of primates." He had seen
laboratory chimpanzee cages which, even though unoccupied at
the time, he characterized as "extremely efficient, extremely
expensive, and extremely cruel."

A second series of amendments, this time consisting of
no less than 32 changes, even including a $500 reduction in
the fine, was prOposed. A night meeting in the Dole office
was called to resolve the differences. It appeared that
although academia was somewhat grudgingly resigned to the
legislation, the pharmaceutical industry was not willing to
stop fighting. Indeed, it fought to the end. Disagreement
about the content continued, and Senator Melcher offered a
substitute bill on October 29th. This passed the Senate
unanimously.

The House had already passed the Farm Bill without the
Dole—Brown amendments. Fortunately, Majority Whip Tom Foley
of Washington proved himself a powerful friend of animals

during the House-Senate Conference. Congressman Foley, as

 




r3171

noted earlier, was the author of the 1976 amendments to the
Animal Welfare Act. House Agriculture Committee Chairman
Kika de la Garza of Texas gave his blessing to the
legislation in Conference. Lobbying to kill the Improved
Standards for Laboratory Animals continued to the very last
moment.

The Farm Bill, an enormously lengthy piece of
legislation, was in Conference for days. The Conferees met
in a small room in the Russell Senate Office Building, and
dozens of lobbyists from each of the special interests that
stood to gain or lose from some part of the complex bill
lined the hallway outside the room, waiting for news on
decisions of the Conferees as staffers came in and out. At
4:00 p.m. on December 12, it appeared that action on the
laboratory animal section was imminent. Weakening amendments
were being urged by the National Association for Biomedical
Research, and Senator Dole had not yet returned from out of
town.

The sight of the Senate Majority Leader striding down
the hall reinvigorated the weary Society for Animal
Protective Legislation lobbyists waiting for the outcome.
"You're next," he said to us. Then he was engulfed by a mass
of farm lobbyists. It was nearly eleven that night when we
heard the good news from Congressman Foley. The Improved
Standards for Laboratory Animals Act had come through the
Conference unscathed!

The Conference report was approved by the House on

 




:35

December 16 and two days later by the Senate. The Improved
Standards for Laboratory Animals amendments establish an
information service in the National Agricultural Library in
cooperation with the National Library of Medicine to provide
data on alternatives to laboratory animals, help prevent
unintended duplication of experiments and tests, and provide
information to institutions for instruction of scientists and
other personnel in humane practices as required by the new
law. Each Registered Research Facility must appoint an
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, including a
veterinarian and a person not affiliated with the
institution, to represent the general community interests in
the prOper care and treatment of animals. The committee must
inspect the animal laboratories twice a year and report
deficiencies to the institution for correction. If not
corrected promptly, the U. S. Department of Agriculture must
be notified for enforcement action, and any funding agency
involved informed for a decision on whether the grant should
be suspended or revoked.

Investigators are required to consider alternatives and
to consult with a veterinarian before beginning any
experiment which could cause pain. They must adhere to
standards set by the Secretary of Agriculture for pre- and
post—surgical care, use of pain—relieving drugs or
euthanasia, against use of paralytics without anesthesia, and
unnecessary use of the same animal for more than one major

Operation. Exceptions to the standards may be made only when

 




549

specified by a research protocol and an explanation given for
any deviation. Fines for violations were raised from $1,000
to $2,500, and for violating a cease and desist order, from
$500 to $1,500. Each animal may count as a violation, as may
each day of failure to obey a cease and desist order.

Interest in protection of laboratory animals has grown
worldwide, and two countries made significant improvements in
their national laws in 1986: The United Kingdom and the
Federal Republic of Germany. The full text of these laws
appears in the Appendix. Of particular note in the new
British Act is recognition of gradations of stress or pain
and justification thereof. This begins with the stress
caused by putting an animal in a cage and progresses to the
point of procedures prohibited because of extreme
painfulness.

In issuing project licenses, the British Secretary of
State is required to "weigh the likely adverse effects on the
animals concerned against the benefit likely to accrue."

Both project licenses and individual licenses are mandatory
under the new law. As in the 1876 Act, if an inspector
considers that an animal is undergoing excessive suffering,
he may require it to be immediately killed.

The new German law was introduced by Minister of
Agriculture Ignaz Kiechle. It forbids, with provision for
special exceptions, the use of animals for tests on weapons,
tobacco, washing powders, and cosmetics. Authorization for

experiments are to be supervised by advisory commissioners.

 




.37

Animal protection organizations may nominate up to a third of
the commissions' members. The law covers all experiments

leading to pain or injury of an animal.

APPROPRIATIONS FOR ENFORCEMENT

The struggle for protection of laboratory animals has
had to be fought on many fronts. When passed in 1966, an
apprOpriation of $300,000 was barely achieved. Slowly,
annual apprOpriations were worked up to $4,865,000 and
remained at the same level despite attempts by the Office of
Management and Budget to reduce them. In both 1985 and 1986,
the Administration recommended that no money whatever be
allocated to administer the law and inspect the 1,219
Registered Research Facilities, the 3,414 licensed dealers'
premises, the 1,386 exhibitors' premises, or the 374
intermediate handlers Operating during those years.

In 1985 the Congress simply restored the funds, but in
1986, following passage of the Dole-Brown amendments,
Congress voted an increase to $5,878,000, specifying that
$750,000 be used for the information service designated by
the new legislation at the National Agricultural Library in
cooperation with the National Library of Medicine. The
Senate ApprOpriations Committee report stated:

For enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act

the Committee concurs with the House in providing

$5,878,000 over the budget request. This is also

$1,902,000 more than the 1986 adjusted level.

Included in this apprOpriation is $750,000 for

creation of an information service at the National

Agricultural Library which will include information

on available alternatives to the use of live animals
in research. The remainder of the increase is for

 




.994?

the general expansion of the program.

On the House floor, Congressman Bob Traxler of Michigan
said: “We restore funding for the Animal Welfare Act
once again, rejecting the notion that enforcement of the act
should be turned over to other authorities. That prOposal is
simply not sensible in today's interstate economy."

In 1987, the Office of Management and Budget again
recommended zero funding for the Animal Welfare Act; however,
for the first time, the Department of Agriculture protested,
and the budget figure emerged as $4.947 million, a figure
from which the $750,000 apprOpriation for the information
service at the National Agricultural Library had been
subtracted and which could not cover the requirement for
continued inspection of research facilities until all
deficiencies were corrected. Congress apprOpriated $6.125
million for Fiscal Year 1987. In 1988 and 1989, the budget
figure again was $4.947 million, but $6.197 million was
apprOpriated; and the budget request for Fiscal Year 1990 is
$7.567 million. Animal protective organizations and
scientific groups are requesting $10 million for enforcement
of the law. Citizen demand for sufficient funds to enforce

the law continues to be necessary.

REGULATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT

In October 1988, a reorganization of the Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service took place. It created a new
division, Regulatory Enforcement and Animal Care (REAC).
Enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act has been removed from
Veterinary Services and placed with REAC. REAC inspectors
are assigned on a full-time basis to enforcement of the Act,
but their numbers are inadequate to make the frequent
inspections necessary to enforce the law. In some cases, it
is expected that Veterinary Services personnel will have to
be called on to help make inspections.

Citizen complaints concerning research facilities,
animal dealers, animal auctions, and other entities covered
by the Animal Welfare Act, including circuses, zoos,
airlines, and the wholesale pet industry, should be directed
to the nearest REAC office or to the central office at
Hyattsville. For names and phone numbers, see the Appendix.
Citizen complaints are important in protecting animals
because of REAC's staff limitations. It is the policy of
REAC to investigate all complaints.

Having failed to prevent enactment of the Improved
Standards for Laboratory Animals amendments by Congress,
Opponents transferred their efforts to the agencies and
succeeded in delaying the regulations which must be
promulgated before the legislation can be enforced. Proposed
regulations for Parts 1 and 2 were first issued by the

Department of Agriculture in March 1987. The National

 




x/p

Association for Biomedical Research (NABR) inspired thousands
of letters of protest against these well-prepared
regulations. The result was that, rather than being made
final, they were withdrawn, and two years passed before
rewritten regulations for Parts 1 and 2 were reprOposed and a
pr0posa1 for Part 3 regulations finally appeared.

An even more intensive effort by NABR and its
constituents followed. However, a lawsuit filed by the
Animal Legal Defense Fund against the Secretary of
Agriculture, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and
the Director of the Office of Management and Budget was
viewed favorably by Judge Richey, who heard the case in the
U. S. District Court. A timetable was set up with the
Justice Department, and on August 31, 1989, final regulations
for Parts 1 and 2 were published in the Eederal Register.

Part of the campaign against Part 3 regulations is the
issuance of inflated figures on compliance costs. As we go
to press, an extended delay is expected with respect to the
requirements for exercise for laboratory dogs and an
environment adequate to promote the psychological well—being

of primates.

ANIMAL WELFARE ACT
As Amended
(7 U.S.C. SS 2131-2157)

Lil) Section 1. (a) This Act may be cited as the "Animal
Welfare Act".

(b) The Congress finds that animals and activities which
are regulated under this Act are either in interstate or
foreign commerce or substantially affect such commerce or the
free flow thereof, and that regulation of animals and
activities as provided in this Act is necessary to prevent
and eliminate burdens upon such commerce and to effectively
regulate such commerce, in order--

D6(l) to insure that animals intended for use in
research facilities or for exhibition purposes or for use as
pets are provided humane care and treatment;

(2) to assure the humane treatment of animals
during transportation in commerce; and

(3) to protect the owners of animals from the theft
of their animals by preventing the sale or use of animals
which have been stolen.

The Congress further finds that it is essential to regulate,
as provided in this Act, the transportation, purchase, sale,
housing, care, handling, and treatment of animals by carriers
or by persons or organizations engaged in using them for
research or experimental purposes or for exhibition purposes
or holding them for sale as pets or for any such purpose or
use. The Congress further finds that-—

(1) the use of animals is instrumental in certain
research and education for advancing knowledge of cures and
treatment for diseases and injuries which afflict both humans
and animals;

(2) methods of testing that do not use animals are being
and continue to be develOped which are faster, less
expensive, and more accurate than traditional animal
experiments for some purposes and further Opportunities exist
for the develOpment of these methods of testing;

(3) measures which eliminate or minimize the unnecessary
duplication of experiments on animals can result in more
productive use of Federal funds; and

(4) measures which help meet the public concern for
laboratory animal care and treatment are important in
assuring that research will continue to prOgress.

Reverence For Life

—
Perspective

As a psychiatrist who has treated drug and alcohol addicted patients in both my
practice and my volunteer work at a shelter for homeless women 1n Washington, DC,
I would like to comment on the inappropriate and wasteful nature of the use of
animals in drug addiction studies.

Nearly $400 million are spent annually on addiction research on animals. At the
same time, drug treatment programs are chronically underfunded and yearly face staff
and budget cuts.

Of the approximately 1.4 million intravenous drug abusers in the nation, only
150,000 are in treatment programs. No accurate estimate is available regarding the
number of cocaine addicts, but at least 22 million Americans have tried the drug.
Drug abusers on waiting lists for available treatment programs number in the
thousands in each of our metropolitan areas.

The need to improve our drug treatment system is all the more critical under the
dark and growing cloud of the AIDS epidemic. Indeed, the Presidential Commission
on the Human Immunodeﬁciancy Virus recommended that $1.4 billion be allotted
nationally for drug treatment programs. But, only $643 million was put into the
budget for ﬁscal year 1988 — funding sufﬁcient to treat only 10 percent of the
nation’s drug abusers.

In the face of these overwhelming statistics, the continued expenditure of hundreds
of millions of dollars each year on addiction research on mice, dogs, cats, horses,
primates and other animals is simply a national tragedy. The agony to which these
animals are subject during such research is appalling. Yet even more appalling is the
total irrelevance of these experiments. Human desires and responses to drugs can
never be recreated in animals who have been force-fed the substances. Information
gained from 200 years of alcohol and drug addiction studies on animals cannot even
approximate the effect that Alcoholics Anonymous and drug treatment programs have
had on breaking the cycles of addiction.

If the money wasted on addicting animals to drugs and alcohol were redirected into
treatment and education programs, we could approximate the level of funding
necessary to abate this tragic problem.

Any rational approach to the nation’s drug problem must certainly rectify this blatant
mlsuse of funds.

Challenging
Cat Experiments,
And Winning!

Last November, animal rights activists claimed victory
in separate campaigns as two cruel experiments, both of
which inﬂicted suffering on cats for over a decade, were
brought to an end. The Animal Rights Community (ARC)
in Cincinnati successfully halted cat skull-crushing
experiments at the University of Cincinnati. And in New
York, Trans-Species Unlimited (TSU) led a campaign that
resulted in a researcher returning already granted funds
for her drug addiction experiments with cats.

Since these two campaigns were Victoriously concluded,
other experiments involving cats have come to the atten-
tion of animal rights activists.

According to the North Carolina Network for Animals,
students and a faculty member with no surgical training
are mutilating the eyes of cats at the University of North
Carolina at Greensboro. Vivisector Walter Salinger has
been using cats in ablyopia experiments (lazy eye) for at
least 15 years. Some cats are blinded and others have
their eyes sutured shut. Animals are immobilized in
stereotaxic devices for up to 24 hours while the mutila-
tions occur, and pedestals are attached to the cats’ heads
with screws cemented to the skull to allow for handling
during these procedures. The University funds the
experiments, but admits that the research is not applicable
to human beings. Letters opposing these experiments can
be sent to Chancellor William E. Moran, UNC-
Greensboro, 303 Mossman Building, Greensboro, NC
27412. For further information on this campaign, contact
the Network for Animals at PO. Box 7593, Greensboro,
NC 27407.

In Canada, researchers at the Vancouver General
Hospital Eye Care Center are blinding both young and
adult cats, rats and rabbits. According to the animal
rights group Lifeforce, plans call for the use of monkeys
in the near future. Like the North Carolina experiments,
the animals are restrained for extended periods of time
and are partially or totally blinded. To help end these
experiments, contact Lifeforce at Box 3117, Main Post
Ofﬁce, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, V6B 3X6.

And at Louisiana State University, Dr. Michael Carey
has received $2 million from the Department of Defense
to conduct ballistic research on cats shot in the heat with
a helium gun. These experiments are being conducted

4

despite a 1983 directive by then Secretary of Defense
Caspar Weinberger banning the use of cats and dogs in
such experiments.

This new wound lab was exposed by Animal Peace of
Louisiana and an effort is being made to close the lab
with the help of the Physicians Committee for Respon—
sible Research (PCRM). Ample information on brain
injury caused by projectiles already exists, PCRM notes,
and these experiments probably do not approximate
battleﬁeld wounds which would be the concern of the
Department of Defense. In addition, substantial differences

exists between cat and human responses to such injuries.

To protest the experiments, write to your Represen-
tative and Senators in Congress (See addresses, page 12)
requesting that they terminate funding for the wound lab
at Louisiana State, and contact the Secretary of Defense
expressing opposition to the use of animals in wound
labs. Write to Secretary Richard Cheney at The
Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301.

Louisiana residents and LSU alumni should also
express disapproval to Chancellor Perry Rigby, LSU

Medical School, 433 Bolivar St., New Orleans, LA 70112.

Between 50,000 and 60,000 cats are used in
laboratories in the United States each year, according to
the Department of Agriculture. The experiments that were
halted at the University of Cincinnati and Cornell
University attest to the cruelty these animals must endure.
An analysis of these Victories could help activists succeed
with other anti-vivisection campaigns.

Invalidity Of Research
Key Factor In Ohio Campaign

In Ohio, ARC sought the help of medical professionals
and animal rights groups around the country in ending
the 14-year, federally-funded experiments which involved
crushing the skulls of cats with a stunning device. The
Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM)
contacted more than 20 neurosurgeons, emergency
medicine physicians, and other specialists to evaluate the
experiments. All unanimously condemned the research
based on scientiﬁc invalidity and ethical concerns.

Christopher Smith, an emergency medicine physician in
Los Angeles, called the experiments “a series of non-

Reverence For Life

 

 

 




 

 

 

 

  

 

results, clinically irrelevant observations, and bizarre and
inhumane protocol.” Concern was expressed about the
lack of standardization and controls in the experiments,
the effect of anesthesia on experimental results, and the
difﬁculty of extrapolating information obtained from
research on cats to human beings.

Last September, university ofﬁcials claimed that the
experiments offered “hope for limiting destructive effects
of head trauma and for restoring injured citizens to pro-
ductive lives.” Less than two months later, the experiments
were called off. Future experiments will involve tissue
studies, according to PCRM. “This is a clear victory for
the animal rights community,” said Neal Barnard, M.D.,
chairperson of PCRM. “It sends a clear message that
society will not tolerate this kind of cruelty, and that
non—animal study methods can be used, if researchers
would take the time to investigate their availability.”

Diligence Pays Off
For Trans-Species At Cornell

Trans-Species Unlimited ﬁrst launched its campaign
against the barbituate addiction experiments on cats at
Cornell University in April 1987. The experiments,
which had received approximately $250,000 annually for
13 years, involved forcibly addicting cats to massive
doses of drugs. TSU released information which showed
that the animals were then abruptly denied the drugs,
causing severe withdrawal resulting in seizures and death.
TSU noted that the withdrawal processes were “already
well-known through clinical experience with human drug
addicts.”

The group picketed the university, and the issue
received attention from Congress and the national media.
In August 1987, the university indicated to TSU that the
eXperiments were over. Dr. David Friedman of the
National Institute on Drug Abuse, the agency funding the
experiments, wrote that cats would no longer be used

Elise of “continuing protests by animal rights
actrv1sts.” Cornell conﬁrmed these statements to
legislators who had been examining the controversy,
members of the public, and the media.

January~June 1989

This cat awaits its fate in a
laboratory cage at Harvard Univer-
sity. Recently exposed research
projects using cats document the
cruelty these animals must endure.

However, TSU uncovered plans to resume the
experiments in the university’s 1988 grant request. The
group immediately organized large protests at the univer-
sity and initiated a nationwide letter-writing campaign. In
response, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)
pressured the researchers to continue using cats. The
Cornell researchers suggested focusing primarily on
review of already-generated data to eliminate pressure
over the use of cats.

But Lynda Erinoff, Project Ofﬁcer for NIDA, wrote
the researchers that “given the animal rights protests and
negative attention focused on the cat studies, it would
seem best to focus on getting these studies into the
literature as a further validation of the worth of your
ongoing research.” Erinoff sent another letter stating that
“it seems likely that your research will continue to be the
focus of protests by anti-animal research groups . . . we
feel that the most effective action for you to pursue is to
resume doing cat experiments as soon as possible.”

As public pressure grew, support from the Cornell
administration for the experiments began to wither. In a
September 20, 1988 internal government memo, NIDA’s
Deputy Director of Preclinical Research stated that
“Cornell has decided to terminate this grant because of
pressure from the animal rights movement.” The
researchers, for the ﬁrst time ever, returned already-
granted funds as the result of a well organized animal
rights campaign.

TSU and the ARC are to be congratulated for this
excellent anti-vivisection work. Both campaigns focused
solely on the merits of the research using animals and did
not even mention laboratory conditions. Focusing on the
experiments themselves served to illuminate the lack of

One rat passes out While another, given the same amount of alcohol, doesn’t. Why? Because scientists have

 

developed an anti-drunkeness drug that would actually permit people to drink more alcohol.

animal research has no human
application; therefore, research
monies would be more effectively
applied to non-animal experi-

Hidden behind locked doors at the
Psychology Department of The
University of Washington campus in
Seattle, John Wenger and his
research team occupied the year of

6

1981 training rats to run a treadmill
— not unusual in psychology circles.
But Wenger’s rats were different.
They were forced to tolerate injec-
tions into the abdomen of what they
— as all non-human animals —
abhor: alcohol. His “alcoholic” rats
were trained to walk a treadmill to
avoid a foot shock to test the theory
that a person who drinks regularly
will automatically become more adept
at functioning under the inﬂuence.
Will they, or will they not, “learn”
to “tolerate” alcohol?

Wenger’s premise and results were
“scientiﬁc” enough to make full
research article status in the
prestigious journal Science under the
title, “Ethanol Tolerance in the Rat
is Learned.” The popular consumer
magazine Science 8] also picked up
on Wenger’s research, and in their
October 1981 issue quoted him
frivolously stating, “The implication
is that if you want to do something
well when you’re drunk, you ought
to practice doing it while you’re
drunk.” But better not test the theory
while driving, it was ﬂippantly added.

Rats

This is not a particularly lurid or
outrageous study — compared to the
cat brain experiments, the monkey
isolation studies, or the “drunken”
ﬁsh taught to swim mazes — a few
of the thousands of alcohol research
experiments we entered into our data
base. We counted over 3,496
published studies since 1960 and 284
current government—funded research
projects in 1986, amounting to an
expenditure in 1986 alone of almost
$24 million.

The Wenger experience does show
us, however, that in the case of
alcohol research — as in all research
using animals — the generally
accepted belief is that only animal
research is the truly “scientiﬁc”
method. The simple expedient of
questioning a few alcoholics taught to
do a simple task before and during a
few full evenings of drinking, com—
pared to the trials on the same task
done by volunteers unaccustomed to
drink, would probably never make
the scientiﬁc journals; yet such
observations would tell more about
the human condition without the

nuisance, biases and inaccuracies of
attempting to extrapolate from animal
ﬁndings. Such simple human obser-
vations also don’t usually command
the big federal grant dollars.

The really big money goes to
animal research. In addition to
funding individual research grant
projects, the federal government sup-
ports nine alcohol research centers —
all but two of which do animal
research: the University of Connec-

ticut at Farmington; the University of

Colorado at Boulder and Denver;
Washington University School of
Medicine at St. Louis. Missouri; the
University of Florida at (iainesville;
Hahnemann University School of
Medicine in Philadelphia; Scripps
Clinic and Research Foundation in
La Jolla; and Mount Sinai Hospital
in New York. ()nly the Medical
Research Institute in San Francisco
and the Pacific Institute for Research
and Evaluation in Lafayette. Cali-
fornia. are —-— more appropriately —

blems in humans and attempting to
seek innovative treatment and preven-
tion programs.

Animal Models
Of Alcoholism Flawed

The scientific method relies heavily
on the use of animal models. often
requiring many years to develop. and
sometimes resulting in failed attempts.
More often. however. animal models
continue to be used which do not
typify the human disease in question.
and which must either finally be
abandoned after much work and
money. or are simply disregarded by
most researchers. although continuing
to be used by some. Alcohol
research is one of the best examples
of this use of deeply flawed models.

The ﬁrst stumbling block in
developing a model of human
alcoholism or alcohol abuse . . . is
that animals do not like alcohol.
They Object strenuously to taking it.
It 1s not quite certain whether it is
the taste or smell. or both. which
animals despise; but experimenters
have had to ﬁnd "involuntary” or

sem1—voluntary” models to circum—
vent the animals‘ preferences. whiCh
are so unlike our own.

Other problems in using liquid

January/411m 1989

diets is that animals will decrease
their diet intake considerably if the
alcohol content becomes too high.
Since the percentage of alcohol con-
tent in the diet cannot be increased
very rapidly, the diet’s useful alcohol
concentration range is rather limited.

A serious problem with these
animal models was expressed by
researcher Harold L. Altshuler of
Baylor College of Medicine in
Houston, Texas, who himself received
over $145,000 in federal grants in
1986 for primate studies of
alcoholism. In a scientiﬁc paper
published in 1981 in the journal
Currents in Alcoholism, Altshuler
wrote that a major ﬂaw in much
alcoholism research is that alcohol
has caloric as well as pharmacologic
effects; thus (as is rarely done),
studies should contain two controls,
since the caloric effects of alcohol
can alter an animal’s nutritional state
in important ways.

Others have raised more general
criticism of animal models of alcohol
dependence and alcohol related
diseases. The first and most basic
objection is that animal models can-
not reproduce human motivational
factors in alcohol abuse.

One of the first motivational
factors in the human use of alcohol,
according to researchers D. Lester
and E.X. Freed (in Pharmocology,
Biochemistry and Behavior, vol. 1.
pages 103—107. 1973) is “expectancy”
of the first drink. Well before a
person takes that first drink, he or
she has already learned to expect that
it will relax. soothe, free inhibitions,
and so forth. When the first drink is
finally taken the person experiences
the expected effect, say Lester and
Freed. and fulﬁllment of this expec-
tancy is reinforcing, leading to a
repetition of the behavior.

Other motivational factors such as
peer pressure, cultural or religious
rituals. self—destruction, and retalia—
tion against others also cannot be
reproduced in animals.

Genetics Or Breeding
Experiments

Genetic research is a good example
of a prevailing structure which we

will call the “human-to—animal—to—
human research triad,” which 1s the

progression of most research. Genetic
research has ﬁrst evolved out of both i
anecdotal and formal observations in j
humans. In 1977 NS. Cotton 1
reviewed 39 studies on the heredity
of alcoholism published over the
preceding 40 years, and summarized
ﬁnding on the families of 6,251
alcoholics and 4,083 non-alcoholics.
The combined data showed that
alcoholics were more likely than non-
alcoholics to have an alcoholic father,
mother, sibling or distant relative.
Almost one—third of any sample of
alcoholics had at least one parent
who was also alcoholic. -

Human observations such as those
above usually then lead to animal
research to prove what had ﬁrst been
seen in humans. Should animal
research bolster human ﬁndings,
more human research will usually 4
follow. (Sometimes human studies ‘
will even be reinstituted if animal
research fails, along with the
admonishment that they were “only
animal studies”)

Behavorial Research

Behavorial research, which concen-
trates on alcohol’s effect on learning
and memory, social and sexual
behavior, emotionality and aggres—
sion, and on patterns of drinking, is
perhaps the easiest to refute since the
very basis of the research is debat-
able on the grounds of anthropo—
morphism (the ascription of human
characteristics to animals).

Behavioral researchers, however,
want to have it both ways: they set
up their experiment to follow the
rules of “pure” science, yet they
draw anthropomorphic conclusions
about the feelings and behavior of
the animals.

Other behavioral research projects
of alcohol use disorders not only
draw anthropomorphic conclusions,
but also could be thought of as
research for its own sake, since the
original intent of the research ~—
treatment or cure of alcoholic
humans —— has been neglected or
forgotten. James Appel at Yale
University, in 1981, under a grant
from the Distilled Spirits Council of
the US. (DSCUS) presented a snake
to monkeys to frighten them to see
whether their preference for alcohol
increased. (It didn’t.)

 




 

 

Problems In Extrapolating
From Animals

In all research, there are varying
degrees of difﬁculty in making
analogies from animal ﬁndings of use
to humans. With alcohol research,
motivational factors and the animals’
strong aversion to alcohol are impor-
tant stumbling blocks. But even in
more solidly based research, there
are certain basic ﬂaws in animal
experimentation; there are just too
many uncontrollable variables.
Although most researchers take great
pains to detail the species, strain and
sex of the animal used, they rarely
cite — or even note — other factors
that may inﬂuence the results.
Laboratory animals live in an
extremely stressful world — with
conﬁnement, handling, sudden visual
and auditory stimuli, loneliness and
abnormal ambiance. Sometimes
humidity, temperature in the room,
materials in the cage, time of the
year, season, microbes, sometimes
even age, types of devices used,
social factors, number of animals per
cage, circadian rhythms and nutri—
tional or fasting state are factors that
are disregarded or overlooked by
researchers.

With all of these factors set aside,
the basic ﬂaw in animal research is
simply that animals are not humans
and do not react like humans; there—
fore, extrapolating is always risky.

Alternatives To Animals

Even in the most well-designed
animal studies of potential value to
humans, non-animal alternatives may
exist, which are invariably quicker,
less costly, less cumbersome, and
which yield more scientiﬁcally valid
and reproducible results. However,
these modern technologies must sup—
plant a deeply entrenched tradition;
for many laboratories, grants for
animal research projects have con—
tinued 15-20 years, and the knack of
“grantsmanship” has been a gain
difﬁcult to achieve and too easily lost
by the use of new, untried — albeit
superior — methods.

Some of the major non—animal
alternatives include in vitro methods
(those performed in the test tube as
opposed to in the intact animal).
Such methods include the use of

8

placentas and other organs, tissues
and cells. They also include the use
of lower organisms, such as
Salmonella bacteria, as in the Ames
test used to screen chemicals for
mutagenicity.

Our review has revealed that vir—
tually all progress in understanding
and treating alcoholism and alcohol
abuse has evolved from either anec—
dotal or formal clinical observations
of human experience. The most . _
effective treatments, such as
Alcoholics Anonymous and various
psychotherapeutic techniques, did not
develop out of animal research.

Diagnostic imaging techniques such
as CAT, PET and NMR scans now
make it possible to view the inner
structure and mechanisms of the
human body without a scalpel, and
the availability of other sophisticated
technologies such as computer and
mathematical modeling now make
animal research a costly diversion

from the true aims of alcohol

research.

After reviewing over 3,496
abstracts and published papers of
alcohol research using animals, and
abstracts of 284 current projects, we
found that such studies did little to
further our knowledge about human
alcohol disorders. In some cases the
conﬂicting results and confusing data
of animal experiments resulted in
faulty information which served
instead to retard progress. For
example, because of animal ﬁndings,
for several years we questioned our
observations in humans that cirrhosis
of the liver is directly caused by
alcohol; the same is true of the rela-
tionship of alcohol to heart disease.
Such confused ﬁndings only served
to postpone essential prevention
programs, which should be our ﬁrst
line of attack.

We found that the treatment of
alcoholism and alcohol—related
diseases was most positively inﬂuenced
by the formation of Alcoholics
Anonymous in 1935, and by the
current use of behavioral and motiva-
tional therapies. The lack of gains
from animal research, and the exist-
ence of less costly, more efﬁcient
and more humane non—animal metho—
dologies, now renders animal
research of alcohol use disorders
obsolete.

West Virginia is the fourteenth state to prohibit pound
seizure. Other states which do not allow pound seizure
are Connecticut, Delawai’e, Hawaii, Maryland,
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York,
Maine, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and
Vermont. Five states currently have laws mandating
pound seizure — Minnesota, Utah, Oklahoma, South
Dakota, and Iowa. Other states leave the decision up to
individual counties or municipalities.

Georgia Hess, president of West Virginia’s Kanawha
Action for Animals, believes that pound seizure “under—
mines the conﬁdence of the public and makes the purpose
of an animal shelter totally ineffective.” Indeed, a
Washington DC. survey showed that people were less
likely to bring strays to a shelter when the shelter gave
these unwanted or lost animals to researchers.

According to Dr. Martin Stephens, of the Humane
Society of the United States, the ready supply of pound
animals also discourages innovation in alternatives to
animal research.

Some researchers argue that pound animals are far less
expensive than purpose—bred animals. They also fear that
without pound seizure, the additional expense of acquiring
purpose-bred animals would shut down many of their
laboratories and halt research. However, hidden costs
practically negate the claim that pound animals are
inexpensive. Pound animals must undergo expensive
conditioning which often includes a month-long
quarantine period. They are also more likely to become
sick or die prematurely which causes the overall cost to
escalate. Concerning the matter of research, Dr. Neal
Barnard, a NEAVS board member states, “Pound
animals are the worst possible research subjects because
we don’t know their age, we don’t know what diseases
they may be harboring, or their history of treatments. We
don’t even know what genetic illnesses may be in their
ancestry.”

The ﬁght to end pound seizure in West Virginia began
in 1982. It was ﬁrst initiated by members of the
Kanawha-Charleston Humane Association and the
Kanawha Action for Animals. As time went on, other
shelters became involved. According to Hess, “The
controversy was brought up in the legislature every year

J anuary-J une 1989

 

until the momentum became stronger and stronger.” How
did West Virginians ﬁnally end pound seizure? Hess
believes that it took an in-depth learning process to get
the ball rolling. “You have to learn to lobby effectively,
know what buttons to push, and understand the politics.”
Last year, the group beneﬁtted from the volunteer
services of a professional lobbyist.

At ﬁrst, the activists considered making concessions.
But, as time went on, they realized that they didn’t have
to accept a compromise. “If you’ve got enough power
behind you, you can do anything,” stated Hess. The
power grew as hundreds of West Virginians bombarded
the state legislature with phone calls. Others wrote letters
to local newspapers, and/or passed out thousands of ﬂiers.

Finally, in December 1988, the Kanawha Action for
Animals held a workshop to bring unity to the move-
ment. “It was the ﬁrst time we were all together,” says
Hess. “The point was to get a contact person in every
county. The contact person would call 10 people and
those 10 people would call 10 more, and so on.” The
phone tree was perhaps the most effective method used.

There was only one group lobbying against the passage
of the bill. West Virginia University fought it “tooth and
nail” according to activist Patricia Prowse. They argued
against the bill, stating that they only used about 70 dogs
per year. “They had their own lobbying group and they
falsely accused us of trying to stop all research,” says
Prowse.

What advice would West Virginians give to other states
and localities? Hess concludes that they won by sticking
to a single goal. “We’re not big enough to ﬁght
everything, so we just kept it to one issue,” says Hess.
“Even when we made phone calls to the legislature, we
would tell everyone exactly what to say so that the issues
would not get confused.”

Virginia, Minnesota, Ohio, Colorado, New Mexico, and
Oregon are now staging ongoing campaigns to end pound
seizure. Many more campaigns take place at the local level.

A bill, HE. 777, has been introduced in Louisiana to
mandate pound seizure. The bill is backed by the univer-
sity community and the sponsor is the Chairman of the
committee with jurisdiction over the bill. Activists fear that
the bill may very well pass. NEAVS members interested in
helping to defeat this bill should contact Nita Hemeter,

Healy, 1870 King Highway, Shreveport, LA 71103,

seizure was in 1984 in Wisconsin. It was voted down 98-1.

State Of West Virginia
14th To Ban Pound Seizure

This year West Virginians made pound seizure — the
term used when shelter animals are released for
laboratory experimentation — one of the biggest issues in
their state’s legislature. Their efforts were rewarded on
April 12, 1989 when Governor Gaston Caperton signed a
bill stating that pound animals may not be used for
scientiﬁc research. Although pound seizure was never
mandated in West Virginia, shelter animals were being
used in research at West Virginia University in Wheeling.

West Virginia is the fourteenth state to prohibit pound
seizure. Other states which do not allow pound seizure
are Connecticut, Delawar’e, Hawaii, Maryland,
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York,
Maine, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and
Vermont. Five states currently have laws mandating

Protests Continue At U.S. Surgical

Protests at United States Surgical Corporation in
Norwalk, CT, have attracted hundreds of animal
rights activists since it was discovered that the com-
pany has paid people to infiltrate the animal rights
movement and may have set up Fran Trutt, the
woman alleged to have planted a radio-controlled
bomb at the company’s headquarters last November.

The protest pictured was held on Jan. 13, another
on April 21. And on May 2, activists demonstrated at
New York City’s Chase Manhattan Plaza while the
company held its annual shareholder meeting inside.

The New England Anti—Vivisection Society introduced
one such resolution at the annual shareholders meeting of
the U.S. Surgical Corporation on May 2. The intent of
the resolution was to ban the use of “dogs or other
animals in any of its business and sales operations except
and unless speciﬁcally required to do so.” Aaron
Medlock, Executive Director of NEAVS, explains the
reason this resolution was introduced. “We have been
displeased with the company’s use of more than a

10

 

 

  

thousand dogs each year to train its sales personnel in the
use of surgical staplers. We decided to take this matter to
the shareholders in an attempt to end the institutionalized
animal cruelty at U.S. Surgical.” Medlock spoke at the
annual meeting and read testimonies from several doctors
which were consistent with NEAVS’ position that it is
not necessary to incorporate the use of live dogs in the
training process.

The U.S. Surgical Board of Directors, in its Notice of
Annual Meeting of Shareholders, “unanimously °
(recommended) a vote against this proposal.” In its J
objection to the resolution, “U.S. Surgical has called our .
proposal ‘false throughout’ which is outrageous and ,
irresponsible of the company’s officials.” Medlock said. .
“U.S. Surgical also used the term ‘live tissue’ when
referring to ‘live dogs” in a classic attempt to remove all
compassion from the discussion by clouding the matter in
misleading, clinical terms,” added Medlock. NEAVS
countered by filing suit against U.S. Surgical for issuing
a false and misleading proxy solicitation in violation of
federal regulations. While the U.S. Court Judge did not
rule that U.S. Surgical’s recommendation was false and
misleading, he did proclaim that the language was
“clumsy” and “foolish”. NEAVS has appealed the ruling.

Although the proposal did not acquire enough votes to
be on the ballot next year (3% as designated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission). Medlock said
NEAVS will be back at U.S. Surgical. He believes that,
in light of U.S. Surgical’s poor handling of the proposal,
the interests of the shareholders were not served well.
“More than a quarter of a million of shares were voted in
our favor,” Medlock said. “That’s a very promising start.

The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals
(PETA) reintroduced a different type of resolution to
eight major corporations this year: American Home
Products, Avon, Bristol Meyers, Colgate—Palmolive,
Greyhound, Gillette, Johnson & Johnson and Shering—
Plough. This resolution is designed to make information
regarding the use of animals in product testing readily
available to the shareholders. It requires “management to
report to shareholders concerning progress made towards
reducing the use of animals in product testing, and to
further disclose the numbers of animals, by species, used
for testing both in—house and in contract laboratories, and
numbers of animals used in procedures involving pain
and performed without anesthesia.”

This spring, many proponents of the proposal, from
organizations as diverse as the Association of
Veterinarians for Animal Rights and the International
Network for Religion and Animals, spoke at the annual
meetings of these eight companies. Doctors and scientists
also provided supportive comments. Scott Van Valken—
burg of the New England Anti—Vivisection Society spoke
at the Gillette meeting and stressed the counter—
productiviness of animal testing. NEAVS also picketed
Gillette World Headquarters in Boston during World Lab
Animal Liberation Week.

In all instances but one (American Home Products) the
resolution acquired enough votes (6%) to be on the ballot
for the third year. The percentage of votes for the

 

 

99

 

Reverence For Life

  

 




 

 

 

 

proposal were as follows: American Home Products
(5.23%), Avon (10.1%), Bristol—Meyers (6.5%), Colgate
(7.3%), Gillette (9.9%), Greyhound (11.4%), Johnson &
Johnson (6.7%), and Schering-Plough (7.5%). Of the
seven resolutions voted on for the second year, four
received a larger percentage of yes votes than in the
previous year. Even in cases where the percentage of
votes decreased measurably (as with Gillette from 16.1%
last year to 9.9% this year), there is no cause for alarm.
Votes can change from year to year due to increase/
decrease of voters, sales of stock, or even hostile
takeovers within the corporation. “Our average of 8% of
the vote in favor of this proposal is very respectable as
far as social concerns go,” said Susan Rich, Compassion
Campaign Director for PETA. For example, in 1988, the
average vote for any of the companies voting to divest in
South Africa was about 12%. “We are just dealing with
a very conservative group,” concluded Rich, referring to
corporate investors.

Mrs. Linn Pulis, a member of NEAVS, submitted a
similar shareholders resolution to IBM. If adopted, the
proposal would allow shareholders access to information
on the numbers of animals used in research and testing.
It would also provide the “sources from which all
research animals are obtained” and “the names of
government agencies requiring that IBM products be tested
on animals”. The IBM proposal, which received 7.9% of

the shareholders vote, will be on the ballot again next year.

A mysterious omission of the animal rights proposal
occurred in some of the proxies solicited by IBM. Ms.
Margaret Tuttle, a NEAVS member who owns shares in
three accounts, noticed that two of her three proxy
solicitations did not include the proposal on animal
experimentation. After contacting IBM with NEAVS
assistance, Ms. Tuttle learned “that Merrill Lynch (which
buys IBM stock for investors) had run out of proxies
from IBM. When they reprinted them, the last proposal
was left off the proxy.” Because of Ms. Tuttle’s
diligence Merrill Lynch had to reprint all of the proxies
immediately in order that the omitted animal testing
resolution be included.

The syntax of animal rights shareholder resolutions can
vary considerably. Yet, whatever the proposal, the resolu-
tions force the companies to deal with these problems
from the inside. Top management can no longer walk
quickly away from the picket lines. When they go inside,
they will still have to face the issue of animal testing.

Noxell To Use Alternative
In Some Cosmetics Testing

The Noxell Corporation, which makes Noxzema skin
creams and Cover Girl cosmetics, has announced that it
will begin using a tissue culture to screen substances for
safety. According to a Noxell spokesperson, 38 cosmetics
tested with a tissue culture method achieved results
comparable to the Draize eye irritancy test which uses
rabbits.

The tissue culture method, known as agorose diffusion,
has been widely used in testing safety of plastic medical
devices which are to be inserted into the human body.

J anuary-J une 1989

This is another example of already—proven alternatives that
industry is slow to use as a replacement for animal tests.

Noxell announced that the tissue culture test would
reduce the use of rabbits used in the Draize test. The
company refused to state how many animals would be
affected, or guarantee that the Draize would not still be
used as a follow-up test to the tissue culture. Noxell will
continue to use animals in other tests as well.

 

NEAVS Joins Suit Against
Navy’s Dolphin Research

On April 3, NEAVS joined with 14 other animal
protection organizations in ﬁling suit against the US.
Navy to prevent the use of Atlantic bottlenose dolphins as
nuclear submarine guards at a naval base in Bangor, WA.

The Navy plans to capture the dolphins in the warm
waters of the Gulf of Mexico, train them with food
deprivation, house them in solitary pens only three times
the length of their bodies, and deploy them in the frigid
waters of Puget Sound.

The suit charges that the proposed Navy program
violates provisions of the Marine Mammal Protection
Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, and the
Administrative Procedures Act.

The Progressive Animal Welfare Society of Lynnwood,
WA, is spearheading the animal protection effort and has
been joined in its efforts by former Navy dolphin trainer
Rick Trout and the original “Flipper” trainer, Ric
O’Barry. Trout, who triggered a federal investigation last
year with allegations of animal abuse in the Navy marine
mammal program at San Diego, said, “What I saw
happen to dolphins in the warm waters of San Diego was
bad enough. Now the Navy wants to push them to the
brink of death in the cold water of Washington.”

A number of deaths have been conﬁrmed among
dolphins involved in the Navy’s program, including the
death of one eleven days after transfer to Puget Sound
from Hawaii last October. Contrary to initial Navy
statements that only four dolphins have died since 1986,
records show that at least 44 have died in the Navy
program, 13 since 1986.

Kenner, Benetton Join List
Of Cruelty-Free Companies

Thanks to campaigns inaugurated by People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals, both Kenner and Benetton
have vowed to stop all animal testing of their products.
Kenner, which had tested its “Play-Doh” on animals,
joined a list of more than 50 manufacturers of children’s
products in pledging to eliminate animal suffering.

Bennetton, which had begun to market cosmetics tested
on animals, agreed to go cruelty-free after an inter—
national campaign expressed the consumer dissatisfaction
over product tests which use animals.

Activist’s Alert

By Scott Van Valkenburg

Action Needed Now
On LD50 Legislation

NEAVS and other organizations are developing multi—
faceted campaigns to support federal legislation that
would end use of the notorious LD50 test. The Consumer
Products Safe Testing Act (8.891, HR. 1676) would
prohibit federal agencies from accepting data obtained
from this archaic and painful test. This legislation is
necessitated by the failure of industry to use alternative
methods and the continued acceptance of lethal dose
testing data by agencies. Activist pressure in support of
this bill can bring about the end of what a leading
toxicologist has described as a “ritual mass execution of
animals.”

The policies of two agencies that accept product testing
data, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), exemplify the
problem. In response to a petition ﬁled by the ASPCA
and cosigned by NEAVS and other organizations, the
FDA issued a statement that the LD50 “is not an FDA-
required procedure for determining safety, and its use is
not part of agency testing policy.” Unfortunately, the
agency refused the petition request to announce that infor-
mation obtained from the LD50 would be unacceptable to
prove product safety.

The EPA statement went further in that it stated that
the agency plans “to accept only newly generated
industry data that conforms with our revised guidelines
unless an adequate rationale for using the LD50 accom-
panies the submission.” The revised guidelines list four
lethal dose tests which use a reduced number of animals.

Both agencies’ policies, like that of the Consumer
Product Safety Commission, allow industry to submit
such data. Although the cosmetic industry has largely
shifted to other lethal dose tests as a result of public
pressure to abolish the LD50, other industries point to
government regulations as “mandating” or implying
support for the test.

The Consumer Product Safe Testing Act would effec-
tively eliminate the excuses of industry by making
opposition to the LD50 federal policy. The Act took a
major step forward when it received a hearing in the last
session of Congress and for the ﬁrst time has a Senate
companion bill this session.

Every Congressperson should hear from constituents in
support of the Act. Write to your Representative and two
Senators asking them to cosponsor the Act, and send
responses you receive to NEAVS. In the House the
legislation is HR. 1676, in the Senate the bill is S. 891.
Letters should also be sent to sponsors Representative
Barbara Boxer and Senator Harry Reid thanking them for
their action in sponsoring the legislation.

NEAVS has designed a new ﬂyer, “Animal Death

12

Tests,” which describes the LD50 and why all lethal
dose tests should be ended. The ﬂyer and our petition
calling for Congresspersons to cosponsor the Consumer
Product Safe Testing Act can be used to generate support
for an end to this cruel test in your community. Contact
the NEAVS Volunteer Coordinator for the new “lethal
dose” action packet today!

When Writing To Congress . . .»

If you don’t know who your Representative and
Senators are, contact the League of Women Voters
in your town. Make your letters short, polite, and
be sure to mention the bill number. Send responses
to NEAVS.

Letters to Representatives should be addressed:
The Hon. , US. House of Represen-
tatives, Washington, DC 20515.

Letters to Senators should be addressed: The Hon.
, US. Senate, Washington, DC 20510.

NEAVS Standing Bill
Reintroduced In Congress

Legislation initiated by NEAVS that would allow
citizens to sue to bring about enforcement of the Animal
Welfare Act has been reintroduced to the US. Congress.

The agency responsible for enforcing the minimal stan—
dards for laboratory animals care contained in the Act,
the United States Department of Agriculture, has often
acted to correct violations only after lengthy, extensive
pressure from animal protection groups.

HR. 2345, sponsored by Rep. Charlie Rose, would
give citizens the right (standing) to sue the USDA to
compel enforcement of the act. In the past, several court
cases concerning improper care of animals in laboratories
have been dismissed by courts ruling that animal protec-

tion groups have no legal standing to bring suit to protect "

the animals involved.

Please write to your Representative and ask for
cosponsorship of HR. 2345. Also write to your Senators
asking that they support legislation that would give
citizens standing in cases involving animals in laboratories.
Letters of appreciation can be sent to Congressman Rose
for continuing to sponsor and support this bill.

Cosmetic Companies
Get Dose Of Reality

The “Bloom County” comic strip recently focused on
the issue of product tests on animals. The strip’s creator,
Berke Breathed, called the series focusing on cosmetic
and soap tests “reality comics.” The cruel lethal dose,
Draize eye irritancy, and dermal skin irritancy tests were
all portrayed. Signiﬁcantly, some corporations who
continue to use these cruel and outdated tests were also
named in the series. These companies quickly issued

‘Medical Turning Point’
Video Available From NEAVS

A new half—hour video entitled “A Medical Turning
Point,” which features three prominent doctors discussing
the use of animals in research, is now available from
NEAVS. Produced by NEAVS Board member Esther
Mechler, the video received widespread airplay during
World Week for Laboratory Animals in late April.

“A Medical Turning Point” is hosted by veteran actor
Lew Ayres (“All Quiet on the Western Front,” “Dr.
Kildare”) and features Dr. Henry Heimlich, developer of
the Heimlich Maneuver; Dr. John McDougall, author of
the bestselling books “The McDougall Plan” and
“McDougall’s Medicine;” and Dr. Neal Barnard,
NEAVS Board member and founder of the Physicians
Committee for Responsible Medicine.

Dr. Heimlich discusses current research at his institute
in Cincinnati where he is testing an alternative treatment
for cancer as well as treatments for emphysema and p
cystic ﬁbrosis. He also discusses the politics of animal

13

 




 

research and how it affects his work and that of his
colleagues.

Dr. McDougall takes the viewer on a shopping trip for
good health, giving clear guidelines for prevention of such
speciﬁc diseases as breast cancer, heart disease and stroke.

The issue of using chimpanzees in AIDS research is
addressed by Dr. Barnard who questions the validity of
such research in the face of the growing epidemic.

During World Week for Laboratory Animals, NEAVS
arranged for the video to be broadcast via satellite
transmission to approximately 800 television stations
throughout the country. Many ran the video in whole or
in part. NEAVS also broadcast via satellite an edited
news release featuring comments by Drs. Heimlich and
Barnard. An estimated 220 television stations used the
release during their news broadcasts. This was the ﬁrst
time that satellite telecommunications had been used to
transmit the animal rights message, and none too soon.
During World Week for Laboratory Animals, the
biomedical research community arranged its own satellite
transmission featuring interviews with doctors promoting
the continued use of animals in experimentation.

“A Medical Turning Point” is available from NEAVS
for purchase in one—half inch video format, or for rental
in both one-half and three-quarter inch (the format
required by television stations for broadcast). The
purchase price is $30. Rentals are $40 with $30 refunded
upon return of the video tape. Contact NEAVS Videos,
333 Washington St., Suite 850, Boston, MA 02108-5100.

New Magazine Focuses
On Animal Protection Efforts

“The Animals’ Voice” is a new bi—monthly publication
examining animal protection issues. Animal rights
philosophy, particular cases of animal abuse, and
activities of animal protection groups are all covered in
this beautiful, glossy magazine.

Sample copies or subscriptions ($36 annually) can be
obtained by writing to The Animals’ Voice, PO. Box
1649, Martinez, CA 94553.

Network Forms To Support
Disease Research Without Animals

Many persons opposed to animal research also are
concerned about diseases affecting humans. Whether to
contribute to an organization that focuses on some
speciﬁc human ailment when that group also supports
animal research is a major decision for animal rights
act1v18ts.

The Health Care Consumer Network has been formed
by Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine,
Incurably Ill for Alternatives to Animal Research, and
others to address this conﬂict. The Network will include
people afﬂicted with disease, members of their families,
physicians, and others concerned about advancing human
health and ending abuse of animals in laboratories.

The Network will keep members informed about inno-
vations in research technology, public policy issues at the
state and national levels that need attention, and will
work with research—sponsoring organizations on such

14

issues. Interested persons should contact the Network at
P0. Box 6322, Washington, DC 20015.

Call 1-800-922-FROG,
The Dissection Hotline

Jenifer Graham catapulted the issue of a student’s right
not to dissect into the national media when she refused to
participate in her frog dissection class. Her suit against
the school, and media attention on her moral decision,
resulted in a California law permitting students to choose
alternatives to dissection.

In order to help students who are considering ﬁghting
forced participation in dissection labs, Jenifer’s mother,
Pat Graham, has established a toll-free hotline. Ms.
Graham informed NEAVS that over 100 calls from 37
states came into the hotline in May. The hotline provides
callers with information on how to deal with teachers,
school administrators, and others who affect the rights of
students in this growing debate over the killing of
animals. The number is 1-800-922-FROG.

Also, watch for a CBS “Afterschool Special” in
October 1989 dramatizing Jenifer’s struggle.

READING THE TRUTH
ABOUTANIMALTESTING WILL
TAKE 5 MINUTES.

ANDAVERY STRONG S'IOMACH.

A recent Reader’s Digest article by Dr.
Robert I. White claimed to state the
“facts" about animal research. But Dr.
White stated more propaganda than fact.
He failed to mention how useless, mis-
leading, costly, and cruel animal experi-
ments 0 e11 are.

Dr White also failed to mention that he
spent nearly 20 years conducting contro
versial head transplants sewing the living
severed heads of dogs or monkeys onto the
headless bodies of other dogs or monkeys
with no practical results Says Dr.
Catherine Roberts, “The details of his
experiments are so horrifying that they
seem to reach the limits of scientific
depravity A fellow brain surgeon says
White 5 work has‘ “a practical value of
/.ero.' 'The American Medical Association

says ‘little or no scientific justification for
this kind of experimentation” exists and
the British Medical Association says
White's research goes “too far." Yet we've
had nearly twenty years of head trans
plants by Dr. White!

It's not surprising that a man who says
that “animals, iii my judgment, have no
rights" is speaking out iii favor of the
unregulated use of animals in experi
ments, particularly when his employer,
Case Western Reserve iii Cleveland, Ohio,
has just announced pliUlS to build a $00

The use of nonhuman animals to

nonhuman animals respond similarly to
treatments in some cases but most often
they do not It is probable that drugs and

2. “Viable alteniatives to animal
research do not yet exist.”

There are many alternatives to animal
research, the most obvious being the study
ofillness in human beings under controlled
conditions [clinical studies) and the study
of naturally occurring disease patterns in
human populations (epidemiology). People
in need of immediate health care currently
are denied the opportunity to help them
selves and to advance medical knowledge
at the same time.

Clinical and epidemiological studies,
cadavers, tissue cultures, cell cultures
from human organs. and sophisticated
computer simulators (like “HUMTRN,”
which can process 10 million intricate
pieces of information about the effects of
substances on the human body} are just a
few of the cheaper, much more reliable
alternatives to animal research. We can
now test irritaiicy on egg membranes,
produce vaccines from human tissues and
perform pregnancy tests using blood sam

4.‘ Animal research is acceptable
because 90 percent of the animals used
are rats and mice; only a small percent
age are cats dogs or monkeys."

Alex Pacheco

Anyone with even a basic knowledge of
the biology of guinea pigs, rats, squirrels,
and mice knows that they have nervous
systems and social bonds virtually identi
cal to those ofdogs,cats,.'u1dpriinates,1n1d
yet the Animal Welfare Act does not cover
rats and mice. This allows researchers to
use them like paperclips, tossing millions
of them into experimentsiarid then into
the trash - each year. A11 animal 's ability to
suffer is unrelated to his or her popularity
or the perceived "inferiority" of his or her
species

When you hear percentages of animal
totals quoted instead of actual numbers,
remember that when you're talking about
()0 to 100 million animals. even a “small
percentage" translates into millions of siif
feririg individuals.

NABR State Laws Book

INTRODUCTION

The controversy surrounding the use of animals in biomedical research and
testing is by no means a new social issue. Indeed, the current animal rights
movement in this country has its roots in the 1800’s, when intense opposition
to the new methods of experimentation on animals that were being used by
the “modern men of science” was expressed.

The fact that opposition to the use of animals in research has been
translated into legislation is also not new. As early as 1900, bills were
introduced in the US. Congress that addressed the subject of laboratory
animals. Today, legislation to further regulate or limit the use of animals in
research continues to be introduced at the federal level.

What is new concerning the research animal use controversy is the increase
in activity on the state level concerning this issue. Particularly in the last ﬁve
years, there has been a signiﬁcant increase in the number of bills ﬁled on the
use of laboratory animals, an increase in the number of states that are
grappling with such bills, and, perhaps most importantly, the potential threat
to the conduct of biomedical research that these state bills pose through
increasingly restrictive requirements.

This publication has been prepared to assist individuals who will be affected
by these new state legislative initiatives. By gathering in one place many of the
state laws concerning the use of research animals, those in research establish-
ments, the media, state legislative bodies and the animal welfare community
should be better able to assess the current status of state laws concerning
research animal use. It is hoped that this publication will provide more
complete information on the current status of these laws so that the debate in
the states can be more enlightened and informed.

HOW TO USE THIS BOOK

Summary of Information Provided

Through the publication STATE LAWS CONCERNING THE USE OF
ANIMALS IN RESEARCH, the National Association for Biomedical Re-
search (NABR) has attempted to compile a synopsis of all state laws that
directly affect the use of animals in biomedical research. The following
general areas are covered:

1. access to pound animals for research;

2. animal cruelty statutes and their application to researchers;

3. state licensing or regulation of research facilities using animals; and
4.

other state laws governing research animal use, such as restrictions on
importing or exporting research animals.

The state laws in each of these areas for all states are provided in chart form
from pages 5 to 7. Following the chart, summaries arranged according to each
area of concern are provided. Each state is then listed individually with all
relevant laws in each of the areas.

State laws concerning the ability to use pound animals are categorized as
follows:

1. those states that PROHIBIT the use of pound animals for research;

2. those states that REQUIRE pound animals be made available to research
institutions;

3. those states that ALLOW the use of pound animals for research, by
either explicitly stating this allowance in state law or by inferring this
permission, for instance, through a requirement that pounds display a
Sign stating the possible disposition of their animals; and

4. those that have some OTHER state law concerning the use or disposition
of pound animals.

 

 




 

 

 

NABR State Laws Book

If an exemption is afforded for research from state animal cruelty statutes,
a synopsis of the exemption is provided. Those states that do not have such an
exemption are categorized as having NO M ENTION of such an exemption in
the state law.

Where applicable, a synopsis of state laws concerning the licensing/regula-
tion/registration of research' facilities that use animals in research is also
provided.

To Obtain Full Text of Laws

Rather than provide the entire text of each state law concerning animals in
research, only the key portions of each state’s laws are provided in this
publication. In most instances this synopsis of the law will provide the reader
with sufﬁcient information to understand the state requirements or prohibi-
tions concerning research animal use. However, should it. be necessary to
review a law in it’s entirety, it may be obtained from several sources.

The National Association for Biomedical Research (NABR) has access to the full
text of the state laws provided in this publication and will provide this information
to NABR members on a complimentary basis. Non-members of NABR may
obtain copies of these laws for a nominal fee. Please contact NABR at:

THIRTEENTH STATE PASSES POUND
RESTRICTION BILL

On April 12th, the Governor of West Virginia
signed state bill 564 making West Virginia the
13th state to prohibit the use of abandoned ani-
» mals obtained from pounds within the state in
biomedical research. The bill indicates that
”the disposition of impounded dogs or cats
may only be by adoption as pets or humanely
destroyed". The penalty for violation of the
provision is a misdemeanor fine of not less
than $450 and not more than $2000. The bill
specifically states that any dog or cat im-
pounded may not be sold, given, transferred,
or otherwise made available directly or indi-
rectly to any person, institution, corporation,
or other entity for use in education or scientific
research or related activities.

AMARILLO, TEXAS PLACES RESTRIC-
TIONS ON RELEASE OF POUND ANI-
MALS FOR RESEARCH

The recommendation of the Animal Control
Board of the city of Amarillo to Amarillo city
commissioners was recently overturned as the
city commissioners voted to restrict the release
of animals from the Amarillo city animal shel-
ter. The ban on release of animals from the
Amarillo pound is not absolute. “Rather, the
city commissioners decided to limit the release
of pound animals to research facilities that are
located within the Amarillo area. In a subse—
quent election of city commissioners within
Amarillo, several of the commissioners partici-
pating in the pound animals decision lost their
seats on the city commission and further action

ERATION WEEK

_The week beginning Monday, April 24th

marked the World Laboratory Animals Libera-
tion Week. The National Association for Bi-
omedical Research's, Washington DC. offices,
were picketed by animal rights activists. Early
on the day of Monday, April 24th, prominent
members of the People for the Ethical Treat-
ment of Animals (PETA) were seen at a fast
food restaurant located adjacent to the office of
the National Association for Biomedical Re—
search and the Foundation for Biomﬁdical
Research. At about 9:00 a.m., twenty animal

activists started handing out leaﬂets entitled

”Meet the vivisectors at 818 Connecticut
Avenue”. After picketing the offices and
chanting slogans one protestor repelled down
the building across the street in an unsuccess-
ful attempt to display a banner reading ”Ani-
mal Research is a $cam". A fire truck with an
extension ladder was used to remove the
building climber who was subsequently ar-
rested. After about an hour the group dis-
persed without further incident.

USDA PROPOSED IMPLEMENTATION
or THEANIMAL WELFARE ACT

The proposed regulations implementing Part
III of the changes enforcing the Animal Welfare
Act and the final regulations of Parts I and II of
the Act were published March 15th to allow
public comment up until May 15th. The legal
basis of the USDA proposed rules has recently
been the subject of question. The American
Council on Education in cooperation with the
National Association of Biomedical Research
has been involved in a legal analysis of USDA
statutory authority which was completed by
Meyerson, Kuhn, and Sterret. The analysis that
was produced by this law ﬁrm concludes that

SPRING 1989

 

POUND SEIZURE BAN FINALLY PASSES BOTH HOUSES OF THE LEGISLATURE!!!

Both Houses of the WV Legislature passed the bill to end pound seizure. S.B.
564 provides for the removal of a dog or cat from an owner charged
with cruelty. Sen. Si Boettner attached the pound seizure ban as
, an amendment to S.B. 564 and it passed the Senate 27—7. The
House passed S.B. 564 on April 5th with a vote of 94-6. The
Bill becomes law September 1, 1989 and provides fines of
$450.00-$2,000.
KAFA is thrilled (after working on this bill for years)
and truly grateful to all of you who worked so hard - to those
who phoned, wrote letters, visited legislators, and prayed for
this bill. Our phone tree was wonderful and the phone captains
worked very hard. Humane groups from all over the State joined this
effort and did a great job of getting to their legislators — Marbhall
County Delegate Tribbett got 1500 phone calls on H.B. 2274! Special
thanks to Delegate Sharon Spencer who has introduced the bill for
years, to co-sponsor Jim Humphreys who was so helpful in Judiciary,
to Rudy Seacrist who helped get the bill on special calendar. Thanks
also to Senators Sondra Lucht for introducing 564 and Si Boettner who saved our bill
by putting it into 564. All Kanawha County delegates and senators voted for the bill.
In other animal matters, S.B. 152 has hopefully died in House Political Sub—
divisions. This disastrous bill placed a bounty on coyotes and wild dogs and would
have meant open season on anything moving in the woods. The determination of a
"wild" dog was by jaw measurement, obviously not measured till the animal was dead.
The bill was introduced by Senators Tucker, Hawse, and Spears.
One bill which should have died and didn't was the bill allowing dog and horse
racing on Sundays. But the bill to allow hunting on Sundays was defeated.

MEETING APRIL 27

Our next general meeting will be Thursday, April 27 at 7:00 p.m., at Trinity
Lutheran Church, 1600 Kanawha Blvd. B. We hope to get a copy of the videotape of
Viewpoint from Sunday April 2. It had an interview between Senator "Buffy" Warner
(chief proponent of pound seizure) and Donald Barnes of the National Anti—Vivisection
Society. (If any of you taped it, please let us know.) We will also discuss the up-
coming Mutt Show and schedule a tattoo clinic. -

TAGS

County dog tags are due July lst. Please renew yours for your animal's
protection (and make sure he/she wears them!). The money from these tags goes into
the dog and kennel fund and helps our public shelters, which are sorely underfunded.

IS CRUELTY ON YOUR SHOPPING LIST?

14 million animals suffer and die each year due to tests by cosmetic and house‘
hold product companies. Your shampoo, perfume, and laundry soap were probably dropped
into rabbits' eyes or force fed to a large group of animals till they died. These
animal tests ARE NOT required by law and do not protect the consumer. During the
Draize test, solutions are dripped into the eyes of conscious rabbits, immobilized
in stocks from which only their heads protrude. Their eyes are often held open with
clips on the lids and many animals break their necks or backs trying to escape. Re-
actions to the irritants include inflammation, swelling, bleeding, blindness. Pain—

relieving drugs are usually not given. During an LD-SO test, a
substance (such as your shampoo) is forced into animals' throats
or pumped into their stomachs by tube, causing death by stomach
rupture or chemical dosage. No painkillers are given and the test
measures the amount of substance that will, in a single dose, kill
50% of the animals in the test group. 5 million dogs, rats, monkeys,
rabbits, pigeons, and other animals die in the LD-SO test annually in

 

the U.S.

Allowing animals to suffer for the sake of vanity is unconscionable, especially
when there are alternatives. Say NO to your AVON and MARY KAY ladies and educate
them about product testing and send us a self—addressed stamped envelope and we will
send you a list of 100's of companies that do not test on animals. One example is Paul
Mitchell, who makes excellant hair care products that you can order through your
hairstylist. Nutrimetics cosmetics are available locally. Ask your local stores to
carry cruelty-free products. Write to companies that test on animals and ask them

to stop such testing and don't buy their products until they do. It will happen
if YOU THE CONSUMER make cruelty unprofitable.

INTERNATIONAL NETWORK FOR RELIGION AND ANIMALS

Religion counsels mercy and kindness to those weaker than ourselves. In spite
of the fact that most of mankind is nominally religious (organized or not), we sub—
ject animal species to horrible cruelties - trapping, hunting, poison, shocking in
the name of science, harpooning, clubbing, mutilating. Most world religions fail
to speak out for animals. INRA seeks to raise the consciousness of religions and
enlist their aid in engendering respect for the life of all sentient beings who
share our planet. Gail Adkins is starting a local chapter of INRA and plans to meet
once a month. If you have more questions or are interested in becoming a member,
please call her at 776—6059 (Veterinarian Michael Fox was instrumental in starting

this group).

Massachusetts—Legislation on pound
seizure is currently pending but there is
little hope that a good strong bill will be

passed. In the meantime, Bay State ani-
mal activists have decided to put the is-
sue of pound seizure before the public,
in the form of a referendum on the bal-
lot in 1984.

1686 - 34th St. NW The Min/2650M Pet Owners
Washington, DC 20007 145506121170]?

Dear Ms. Stevens:

 

PAL INC gratefully acknowledges your very, very
generous donation of $200.00 toward Minnesota's efforts
to repeal this state's pound seizure law. As you know,
Minnesota was the first state to pass such a law (1949)
and remains one of only six states to retain mandatory
seizure of impounded pets.

In 1985 and 1986 PAL attempted to win the prohibition

of this practice. The '85 bill lost in its House hearing;
in '86 the bill made it through the House committee but
did not get beyond that. This year PAL lowered its
sights to local option. The bill got through its Senate
committee hearing but was then tossed into the Rules
Committee and then into another committee where the odds
were stacked against any change. Here the Senator from
Rochester amended the bill to replace the mandate. This
form passed the Senate by a 66—0 vote. The legislation
never reached the House floor, however, for a vote.

PAL's 1987 efforts centered around a bill to giVe the
Minnesota Board of Animal Health additional control over

state animal dealers. The objective was to curb the

rampant pet theft going on here, as you well know from

your 1983-'84 work with Carol Kough of Austin. This

bill was signed into law by Governor Rudy Perpich and took
effect on August 1, 1987 (see write-up in enclosed PET SCOOP).

The new law provides for inspections of animal dealers by

the Minnesota Board of Animal Health as well as the USDA,
requires dealers to post their premises letting the public
know that they sell animals for research and experimentation,
and opens their premises to the public so that pet owners

(OVER)

-- PAL, inc.

can search for their lost or stolen pets there.

In addition to PET SCOOP, we are also enclosing a copy
of the 1988 ad which was prepared for PAL INC by the
Campbell—Mithun advertising agency in Minneapolis. It
was awarded first place in international competition
in the non-profit category.

PAL INC is greatly encouraged by your interest and
support, and we thank you for caring.

CARS AREN'T THE ONLY THINGS SOLD FOR THEIR PARTS
Membership Meeting Announcement

 




October l, 1988

Dear Pal:

The excellent response PAL INC received from its

 

membership to the recent appeal for funds, has
been encouraging and both the officers and The MnneSOta Pet owners
directors extend their gratitude for your ASSOaaﬂO/Z
cooperation. They also thank you for your calls and

letters to legislators during the 1988 legislative session. From

'information trickling from the Capitol, we can assume that constituent

communication during the past session was right in keeping with national

statistics showing that lawmakers receive more correspondence about

animal issues than any other issue, including taxes!

 

Why, then, does Minnesota still have mandatory seizure of private pets?

To understand the answer to this question, consider the fact that most humane
work, especially in the area of animal concerns, is left to volunteer organi—
zations. These organizations, while highly motivated, are totally dependent
upon volunteer donations to carry out their missions. What can be achieved
is always dependent upon financial resources.

PAL INC, being totally volunteer, suffers from the same high motivation—low
funding as other groups working to alleviate the suffering of the helpless.
During the last legislative session PAL abilities to achieve were augmented

by the donation of CAMPBELL—MITHUNJ Advertising Agency's creative genius in
preparing the very effective advertisement CARS AREN'T THE ONLY THINGS SOLD
FOR THEIR PARTS. Space costs to run the ad in both the ST. PAUL PIONEER
PRESS DISPATCH and the ROCHESTER POST-BULLETIN were contributed by VIDEO LEASE
of St. Paul.

Members and supporters, through dues and donations, paid for the space to
publish the ad in the MINNEAPOLIS STAR TRIBUNE, postage, printing, etc.

PAL had no lobbying expense. It was volunteers who prepared the infor—
mation presented to legislators (as it appeared in the resume letter). You
and thousands of others, through letters, calls, and personal talks with
representatives and senators, overwhelmingly told Minnesota legislators
that their constituents wanted pound seizure repealed.

It is disappointing that PAL INC did not achieve its goal in 1988, but PAL
can be proud that its efforts in 1987 played a vital role in the passage of
the dealer bill. Because of this law, Minnesota pet owners are now able to

 

search for lost or stolen pets on dealer premises. Also animal dealers in
Minnesota.amanow required to post the fact that they sell to research.

 

To you, our members, to our supporters, and to all pet owners, PAL INC pledges
its continuing efforts to win property ownership rights for pet owners and
to work for the prevention of cruelty within its financial limits.

On Monday, November 7, PAL will hold its annual meeting at HOpe Lutheran Church
in South Minneapolis. If you have fund-raising skills or ideas, if you have a
talent or skills you are willing to put to work for PAL, please bring them

with you to this meeting.

FUR RALLY, DEMONSTRATION ON OCTOBER 8

 

FATE (Friends of Animals and Their Environment) will hold a rally and protest
march on Saturday, October 8, 11:00 a.m., at Peavey Plaza, Minneapolis, "to
protest the taking of fur bearing animals for fur coats".

The principal speaker will be Dr. John Grandy, wildlife biologist and vice
president of the Humane Society of the United States. He will include a

discussion of the antifur movement in Europe in his talk.

"We will rally at Peavey Plaza, llth St. and Nicollet Mall, at 11:00 a.m.,"

FATE has announced. "Bring signs and posters if you can. After the rally we
will all march to a downtown furrier to protest the sale of fur coats."

Speaking of the "side effects" of the fur trade, PAL president, Sharon Filia-

trault, points out that the so-called trash catch (those non—furbearers caught
in the traps) is comprised of any unsuspecting animal that may walk into these
devices. Endangered species are no exception. Neither are domestic pets.

"There are no records available as to the number of household pets who have died
in traps, been killed by trappers to clear their traps, or the many, many who

have lost limbs as a result of traps," she said.
For more details call FATE at 690-4997.

PETA TO CONDUCT DAY-LONG SEMINAR IN MINNEAPOLIS

On Saturday, October 15, PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) will
conduct a one—day basic skills seminar in Minneapolis "for the beginning animal
rights activist". The agenda will cover such topics as how to help animals

even if one's on his/her own, how to get needed information, how to spread the
message of animal liberation, how to "go vegetarian", resources available, and
how to build confidence to work more effectively for animals.

The seminar is scheduled to run from 9:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.. Its cost is $20.00.

Participants will receive PETA's GUIDE TO ANIMAL RIGHTS ORGANIZING, the seminar
workbook, a fact sheet pack, and a free Video of participant's choice:

BRITCHES (blinding experiment), UNNECESSARY FUSS (head injury lab at the Univ-
ersity of Pennsylvania), BREAKING BARRIERS (psychological suffering of pri—
mates), DOG LAB (callousness of medical school "dog labs").

PAL members interested in attending are advised to fill out the following
registration form and mail to PETA directly before October 10.

The seminar is designed to enable participants to project a more professional
image to the public and media, to stand up to confrontations with animal
abusers with more confidence, and to enable each to use his/her time more

effectively to help animals.

"If you are letting a lack of organizaing skills, and confidence hold you back
from brining the message of animal rights to the public, let us help,"
PETA's announcement of its ANIMAL RIGHTS lOl seminar.

Monday, May 18, 1987, 11:57 p.m.

The 1987 legislative session had been
a hard one for PAL Inc members in the
respect that victory could be touched, felt
— all but taken home.

A piece of legislation was the target of
the organization’s hopes; a bill which
would subject Class B animal dealers to
state as well as federal inspections, force
compliance with the animal welfare act,
open dealer premises up to the public, and
would demand that animal dealers come
clean with the public in terms of telling
the true nature of their businesses, when
the business is the collection and sale of
animals for research.

Carol Kough, Austin animal activist and
wife of former mayor Tom Kough, had
impressed legislators with her recountings
of visits to animal dealers in southern
Minnesota. Committee members appeared
stunned as Kough recalled incident after
incident regarding her dealings with indi-
viduals licensed by the federal government
to supply dogs and cats to research
laboratories; the cramped kennels, lack of
evidence of food and water, dog auctions,
her own beating at the hand of a dealer.

Lawmakers also listened to other wit—
nesses from the Twin Cities and outstate
areas who had lost cherished family mem-
bers at the hands of thieves. After hearing
the testimony, there seemed little doubt
left among committee members that the
pets were being turned in to dealers for
quick cash, to be resold to research for

even more money.

While witnesses presented evidence to
lawmakers, residents from across the state
were keeping legislators’ mailboxes filled.
Hundreds of pleas poured into the state
capitol from constituents asking that
Minnesota animal dealer operations be put
under greater control.

Most of the letters came in answer to a
“Flash Alert” put out in mid-March in
which PAL Inc explained the animal dealer
issue to members, and urged them to write
in favor of changing the law.

So affected was one legislator by the
amount of mail he had received on the
animal dealer issue. he told a hearing audi-
ence, “Any organization which has the
power to generate the number of letters
which have been ﬂooding into our offices
on this issue, should also have some means
of ensuring that these atrocities stop. We
cannot count on a piece of paper to put
an end to these crimes. I hope you see to
it that the provisions are enforced, and tell
us if more needs to be done.”

The dealer regulation bill got the nod
of approval from four separate committees
in all. In the House, alone, the bill had
withstood two Governmental Operations
hearings and another before the Appropri-
ations committee. By late April, the dealer
regulation bill sat on the House ﬂoor just
waiting for the final OK to be granted by
the total body.

In the Senate, things were going almost

Movers and Shakers of
the ’87 session a

PAL Inc wants to turn the spotlight on
a number of Minnesota legislators who
made this legislative session a success for
pet owners throughout the state.

The first round of thanks goes to two
hard-working and committed legislators
from the Twin Cities —— Representative
Rich O’Connor of St. Paul, and Represen-
tative Wayne Simoneau of Fridley.

Representative O’Connor signed onto
the first line of the animal dealer regulation
bill in January after hearing the facts on
the issue. Simoneau was right behind him.

O’Connor did an outstanding job of in-
troducing the bill to House committee
members, having done his homework
well. Simoneau, as chair of the Gov-
ernmental Operations committee which
heard the bill, lent the strength of his pos-
ition and reputation to seeing that the bill
left his committee in good shape.

 

O’CONNOR

On the Senate side, Senator Lawrence
Pogemiller of northeast Minneapolis took
chief authorship of the bill, with Senator
Jim Ramstad of Plymouth/Wayzata taking
one of the co-author positions as Republi-
can support to its passage. Ramstad has
been a three straight year supporter of PAL
Inc legislation.

as well. The measure was approved quick-
ly by the committee on General Legisla-
tion, and forwarded on to Senate Finance
to grant the money which would pay for
added inspections of dealer premises.

Come the last week of session, however,
the bill had still not been scheduled in
Finance, and tax issues quickly filled any
remaining holes on that committee’s hear-
ing agenda. PAL Inc workers were told
they had the Senate’s sympathy, probably
its support, but not its time.

Grass rooters gave up hope for a last—
minute miracle and left the capitol only
72 hours before the final bell would call
adjournment of the 1987 legislative ses—
sion. They had suffered legislative defeat
before, but never had victory been so
close. The day when a pet owner could
walk onto dealer property to reclaim his
lost or stolen pet, when state investigators
would demand proof of ownership by per—
sons turning animals over to dealers, when
inspectors would make routine random in-
spections of dealer operations — was so
close it had seemed like tomorrow.

Now, that day was at least a year away,
maybe more.

But not every PAL Inc worker went
home that Saturday. One member stayed
behind. Joe Beaton, PAL Inc general coun—
sel and volunteer lobbyist, set up camp at

Representative Gerald Knickerbocker of
Hopkins.

PAL Inc takes top honors

PAL Inc has been chosen as one of seven
organizations in the country to receive top
honors and a monetary grant from the New
England Anti-Vivisection Society
(NEAVS) in Boston.

NEAVS, one of the oldest animal wel-
fare organizations in the world, has pro-
vided advice and support to PAL Inc dur-
ing the organization’s efforts to end pound
seizure in Minnesota. NEAVS’ current
president, Aaron Medlock, has visited the
Twin Cities on several occasions to meet
personally with PAL Inc members.

Dr. John McArdle, previously of the
Humane Society of the United States and
now with NEAVS, has been a close ally

of the PAL Inc organization for years. Dr.
McArdle has ﬂown to testify before the
Minnesota legislature on three occasions
at the request of PAL Inc. Last November,
Dr. McArdle gave a lecture at the organi-
zation’s “Know Us” seminar.

This year, NEAVS directors reviewed
candidate organizations throughout the
country for financial grants. Grants are
given to continue work toward ending un-
necessary use of animals in research.

PAL Inc was very pleased to be chosen
as one of the seven determined to be most
worthy of NEAVS endowments.

Authors come forward

for 1988

It is with great pleasure that PAL Inc
announces it has already signed chief au—
thors to its pound seizure prohibition bill
for the 1988 session. Without meaning to
appear boastful, it’s difficult not to when
announcing the individuals who will take
responsibility for the issue next year.

Representative Wayne Simoneau, chair-
man of the House Governmental Opera-
tions committee, seven-term member of
the legislature and highly-respected DFL
leader will guide the pound seizure meas-
ure through the House of Representatives.
PAL Inc expects a rough ride on pound
seizure as it is a highly controversial issue
involving the medical community. The bill
will require someone of Simoneau’s
strength and knowledge to convince
fellow legislators that the day for sending
privately—owned pets into research is long
past.

One of the most prestigious positions
which can be granted a Minnesota legis-
lator is chairmanship of the Senate Finance

MERRIAIJI Sis/ii ONEA U

Committee, a group of senators holding

tremendous responsibility for seeing to '

state fiscal policy.

Senator Gene Merriam holds that posi-
tion for the 1987-88 biennium, and Sena—
tor Merriam has agreed to lead pet owners
in prohibiting pound seizure next year.
Senator Merriam has been a long—time ad-
vocate of ending the inhumane practice in
this state. PAL Inc members will be kept
advised as work toward the pound seizure
effort for 1988 ensues.

the capitol for the next two days and
nights. With years of legislative experi-
ence behind him, he knew there was still
a chance; not much of a chance, but he
was going the distance.

The distance, in this case, meant living
through amendment time.

Amendment time, those hours before
Minnesota sends its lawmakers home for
the year, is every legislator’s, every lobby-
ist’s, every corporation and organization’s
last chance to get what they failed to get
during the past 140 days. The political
“process” has nothing to do with events
from hereon. It’s all ad lib —- politics at
open throttle.

If you commit to playing the amend-
ment game, you’d better be willing to
make the sacrifices. You aren’t going to
see home until it’s over. You’re going to
live on cold coffee from stained styrofoam
cups and Friday’s doughnuts. You’re going
to put undue faith in your deodorant.

remain for amendment time, and only
those who know that the game is most
often lost despite the sacrifices need stick
it out.

 

The late-night caller simply says,
“We’re on our way to the Governor”.
The PAL Inc director looks again at the
clock and realizes that, in three minutes,

the 1987 legislature would be history.
“Don’t ask how, we’ll talk about that to-
morrow, ” says an exhausted Beaton.
“Just know this for now — We won.”

With that, Beaton goes home to sleep,
the rest of the active committee wakes up
as call after excited call follows well into
the night. Joe Beaton had won the amend-
ment game, but as he quickly points out,
the victory would not have come had it
not been for the months-long eﬁorts of all
who urged the bill’s passage from day
one. It was because the public had given
the issue such wide visibility and had so
heavily impressed legislators with the im-
portance of the bill, that Beaton decided
that the issue had that one last chance.

Very special thanks go to Carol Kough
for playing a detrimental role in passing
the bill, and to Janet Lee for her equally
important appearances at the capitol. Ap-
preciation also goes to all of the organi-
zation’s active members who pressed for
each hearing, constructed exhibits, as-
sembled brieﬁngs, and made countless
trips to the capitol to discuss the animal
dealership issue with individual legis—
lators.

And thanks to you. If you wrote or
called on behalfof the I 98 7 animal dealer
regulation bill, just know this —

lbu won.

Our heartiest c'orzgratulations.

 




We’re
looking
bigger and
better!

The PAL Inc organization was founded
in 1983 by a half dozen Twin Cities resi-
dents concerned about laws and practices
1n the state which placed privately—owned
pets at jeopardy of falling victim to a host
of inhumane systems.

By 1984, the group had become about
30 volunteers with a number of profession-
als representing various areas of the busi-
ness world. The organization was also be-
ginning to draw supporters and was scrap—
ing by on small donations.

It was in 1985 that things began to move
for PAL Inc. That year, a separate commit-
tee was established to monitor conditions
at the Minneapolis animal pound, an effort
which eventually led to members of that
committee testifying before the city coun-
cil as to deplorable circumstances for lost
pets. Due largely to that committee’s ac-
tions, the city took control of its pound
operation from the former contractor and
turned the operation around.

Also in 1985, PAL Inc made its first
legislative bid for an end to pound seizure.
It did not go well and it was obvious that
the organization needed professional legis-
lative guidance.

Through independent lobbying firms,
and by the addition of Minneapolis attor-
ney Joe Beaton to the volunteer commit—
tee, members learned enough about the
legislative process to pass the pound seiz-
ure issue through the House committee on
General Legislation in 1986. That same
committee had almost unanimously voted
the pound seizure prohibition bill down
just one year before.

A Senate committee finally vetoed the
pound seizure bill that year, but the loss
was only one vote short of a win for PAL
Inc.

Toward the end of 1986 the board moved
to expand on its name, adding “The
Minnesota Pet Owners Association” to
PAL Inc. They also moved to begin solicit-
ing official memberships in the organiza-
tion. With those changes came added re-
sponsibilities toward serving the member-
ship.

January, 1987, brought a complete pack-
age to interested pet owners; discounts on
pet services and supplies, the “Second
Chance” program, efforts to gain better
protection measures for pets and owners,
news of the area’s and the nation’s actions
toward animal welfare. The organization
solicited its first official memberships. “A

This offer exclusive to PAL Inc members showing their current membership card
at the time of purchase

When you join PAL Inc, the Minnesota
Pet Owners Association, you are automat-
ically enrolled in the “Second Chance”
program which puts the organization on
call as a back—up contact should your pet
become impounded in one of the area’s
several animal pounds.

The program works like this: As soon
as you join the organization, you are fur-
nished a pet tag which bears the same
number as your membership number. This
tag gets affixed to your dog or cat’s collar
along with any other ID already on the pet.

If your pet becomes lost and is im-
pounded, and should other ID on the ani-
mal be outdated or non-existent, pounds
are instructed to call the PAL Inc office

and report the animal’s “Second Chance”
number.

PAL Inc then gets to work immediately
to cross-reference the pet’s tag number
with your file, and locate you to inform
you of your pet’s whereabouts and cir-
cumstances.

If you own more than one pet, sub-

ditional pets enrolled in the Second
Chance program for a cost of $3 .50 each.

An important aspect of the Second
Chance program is that the bright blue
Second Chance tag reads in bold letters,
“Not For Research”. According to the 1979
amendment to the state’s pound seizure
law, it is illegal to release an animal to a
research institution if it bears identification
with the “Not For Research” wording.

Take the ‘bored’ out of

boarding

by Judy Kamerud
Pets Are Inn

How will my pet behave in a strange
home? Will he eat? Will she act up? Will
he miss me? Be sad?

These are the most frequent questions
asked by pet owners who use Pets Are Inn
for the first time. Of course, your pet will
miss you, but as a rule, the adjustment
period is very short and they do amazingly
well. When they are placed with people
who love pets and pay attention to their
needs for affection, they settle right in.

We take great care in matching your
pet’s personality and environment to the
caretaker, thus minimizing any adjust-
ments the pet may have to make.

We of Pets Are Inn would like to make
a few suggestions for those pet owners
who are going to be away from their pets
for a time:

Try to minimize the “hustle and bustle”
—— pack their belongings “in secret”. Tell

them they are going to be going to a loving
home, but don’t lavish them suddenly with
affection that is out of the norm.

Don’t take them to the vet or groomer
the day before unless necessary. That can
be traumatic for them in and of itself.

Don’t change their diet, schedule or
sleeping habits at the last minute. It just
confuses things.

Try to write a note about their special
likes and dislikes that can be helpful to
the care-giver. And, most of all, don’t
worry about them! If we think your pet
might be ill, we will follow up.

We will do our best to see they have a
good time while you are having one, too.

If you have any specific questions about
pet behavior, or our service, we will be
glad to try to help you. Please write Judy
at Pets Are Inn, PO 27485, Minneapolis,
MN 55427, or call (612) 623-2056.

 

Editors note: I personally used the Pets Are Inn boarding service for the ﬁrst time last August. I ignored
Judy’s advice and worried. My dog’s personality is one that I thought only a masochist could love. My
dog ﬂunked the obedience school entrance exam.

Surprised was I when my doggy delinquent returned from a week’s boarding with a note that described
his behavior as, “charming” and “special”. They had played ball until the caretaker said her “arm
fell 01?”, and when it was time to cozy in for the night, my dog took the cozying very literally. “We ﬁt
in bed nicely —— backside to backside,” the caretaker reported.

Reading the note, I kept checking the dog to make sure they hadn’t pulled a switch or performed
an exotic surgical procedure, but we were deﬁnitely discussing the same A] “Canine” Capone. I still
have the note, and when Capone pilots a non-stop ﬂight directly from a backyard mud puddle onto the
sofa, I immediately scan to the references of “charming”, “special”.

I called for the Pets Are Inn service again this spring. This time, I was not worried, maybe just a
little concerned about how much my loyal friend would miss me. Surprised was I to ﬁnd a suitcase
already packed with 13 balls, Pound Puppy jammies and a note that read, “Dear lois, did you remember

We thank Dr. Fleming for sharing his
understandings about a growing problem
to cat owners — feline leukemia. Dr.
Fleming suggests that, if you have particu—
lar questions regarding "‘fe-luke” not
answered in this article, you contact your
veterinarian, or you may write to Dr.
Fleming at the Plymouth Heights Pet H os-

pital, 3401 County Rd. #18, Plymouth,
MN, 55441.

Feline leukemia. What is it?

Feline leukemia is a disease of cats
which has been studied and researched ex—
tensively by veterinarians, but our under—
standing of the viral infection still leaves
some to be desired.

As new information comes in, we have
to change our views of diagnosis, treat—
ment and prevention to fit the latest avail—
able data. It is small wonder, then, why
misconceptions arise about the disease
among cat owners. Even veterinarians can—
not agree on certain aspects. I will try to
clarify our current understanding of the
disease in order to help you make edu-
cated, rational decisions about your cat,
and feline leukemia.

The feline leukemia virus (FeLV) is a
contagious virus which is spread between
cats most commonly in the saliva by lick-
ing, biting and sneezing, but can also be
shed in the urine and feces. Kittens may
become infected in the womb, or by nurs-
ing milk of an infected queen (mother cat).

The FeLV virus is very unstable off the
animal; it can survive only two to three
minutes in air and one to two days in a
moist environment. It is easily killed by
any household detergent and it is highly
improbablethat the virus can be carried
between cats on the skin or clothing of
humans.

Once exposed, 40% of healthy cats will
reject the virus and recover from the infec-
tion. About 30% of cats will be unable to
rid themselves of the virus and will
develop a persistent infection. The disease
may progress many different ways.

Feline leukemia. What does it do?

Leukemia, a cancer of blood cells, is
only one of many outcomes. A more com-
mon result is lymphosarcoma which is a
malignant tumor that can occur in almost
any tissue or organ and is virtually always
fatal.

By far the most common result of the
FeLV virus is the associated diseases
caused by impairment of a cat’s immune
system, hence the misnomer —— Feline
AIDS. The FeLV positive cat will have
limited ability to fight off even the most
common bacterial and viral infections.

Feline leukemia. What are its signs?

One of the most common questions I
am asked is what are the signs of feline
leukemia. The important thing to re-
member is virtually any clinical sign of
disease in the cat may be attributed to a
FeLV infection. Anemia and its accom-
panying lethargy are the most common
signs. Other signs are recurring infections,

by Dr. Pierce Fleming, D.V.M.
Plymouth Heights Pet Hospital

skin sores, chronic gum disease, an un—
kept, rough coat, loss of appetite and
weight.

So, if 40% reject the virus, and about
30% show symptoms of being affected by
the disease, what happens to the other
30%?

These are potentially the most danger-
ous because they are unable to reject the
virus from their systems, but they do not
develop disease from it. These are the “la-
tent carriers“ which look normal, but are
potential shedders of the virus to cats they
come into contact with. Without testing,
it is impossible to determine which cats
fall into this category.

Feline leukemia. What do we do?

How can we prevent our cat from being
exposed to the FeLV and the possibility of
contracting feline leukemia? At present,
there are only two alternatives.

First, keep your cat away from all other
cats and their environments — not always
an easy task. Do you ever board your cat?
Do you bring him into an animal hospltal?

The second alternative is vacc1nat10n.
What you may not know is that we are
unsure as to how effective the vacc1ne 1s.
Depending on whose field trials you wish
to believe, somewhere between 70% and
90% of the cats vaccinated will be pro-
tected. In other words, if you go through
the recomended vaccination procedure,
there is roughly a one in five Chance that
your cat still isn’t protected. .

However, regardless of efficacy, it IS
still the best —— the only —— form of pro—
tection we can provide. The decision to
vaccinate, then, should be based on health
of the animal, exposure risk, and afforda-

bility.

 

It is strongly recommended to test your
cat for the disease before vaccinating it.
Vaccination of a cat which is FeLV—positive
will provide no protection and could be
potentially harmful.

Feline leukemia. The diagnosis.

This leads us to the difficult area of
diagnosis. The first question is, which cats
should be tested?

Ideally, all cats in an individual environ—
ment should get tests. But testing is not
always feasible or affordable. So which
cats are at the highest risk?

First comes those cats living with
known FeLV-positive cats.

Next, strays and outdoor cats will have
the highest exposure risk. Then comes
multi-cat households with risk factors
doubling for each cat.

Of course, a single cat that never goes
outside is at minimal risk but there is al—
ways the potential of exposure from the
kitten’s mother.

Once the decision to test has been made,
we must decide which test to run. This is
where a lot of misconceptions are formed.

Basically, there are two kinds of tests
for FeLV. The test run in town by your
veterinarian is what is known as an ELISA
(as in Dolittle) test. A positive ELISA test
confirms the cat has been exposed to the
FeLV virus at some point, but does not
confirm the presence of active FeLV dis-
ease. The cat may have been exposed but
its immune system has not had time to
eliminate the virus from its body.

The other test has to be sent to one of
a number of laboratories out of state. These
are I.F.A. tests and they look for the FeLV
within the host’s blood cells. A positive
I.F.A. test confirms that the cat has been

exposed to the FeLV, has contracted the
disease, and is probably shedding the
virus. Therefore, it follows that any posi—
tive ELISA test should be followed with
an IRA. test.

Have you followed so far? Unfortu-
nately, it gets no simpler from here.

Feline leukemia. Test results.

I will now try to explain what is meant
by getting a “false positive”. Most ELISA
tests are very sensitive (some would say
too sensitive), and protocol used must be
meticulous because there are factors in-
volved which can cause an inaccurate posi-
tive test result.

The good news is, if you get a negative
result with this test, you can be reasonably
sure your cat is negative.

The bad news, of course, is if you get
a positive result, without retesting you will
not know for sure whether it is a true or
false positive.

To muddle things up a little more, there
is a new ELISA test on the market, the
CITE test. With this test, you can be
reasonably sure a positive result is posi—
tive.

The problem? With this test we have
found it is easier to get false negatives!

If your head is spinning, I apologize,
but it is a complex problem and explana—
tion cannot be handled simply.

Feline leukemia. A doctor’s advice.

The point I am trying to make is — Do
not make any drastic decisions regarding
your pet based on one positive ELISA test!
Discuss how to interpret your results and
how and if you should retest with your
veterinarian.

In the last couple years, our clinic has
used four different ELISA tests and after .
comparing different test results on the
same cats, I feel it is very common to
have false positives. Our clinic currently
uses the CITE test (with reservations) be-
cause we feel it is the most accurate ELISA
test available.

However, I also feel it is completely
justified to skip the ELISA test altogether
and just run the LEA. test.

After all, our primary concern is —
Does this cat have the disease and is it a
potential risk to other cats? Our only prob—
lem with this course of action is that the
cat may have been exposed to the FeLV
and is a latent carrier or has not yet come
down with the disease.

To summarize, in my opinion, the only
test results you can be sure of at this point
are:

Negative ELISA
CITE) is negative.

Positive CITE is positive for expo-
sure.

Positive LEA. is positive for dis-
ease.

(other than

All other results should be suspect, and
if feasible, retested at a later date, prefer-
ably with a different test.

You will certainly find other veterina-
rians who disagree with my recommenda-
tions and I will not say they are wrong.
My opinions are based on personal re-
search, observations, comparative testing
and consultations, but other private prac-
titioners will have different experiences.

New information changes from month
to month with testing and vaccination pro-
cedures. It would be so much easier for
veterinarians and our clients to make deci-
sions regarding our cats if everything was
black and white, but unfortunately, there
is a lot of grey.

I would be happy to answer any ques—
tions you have regarding feline leukemia
in your next newsletter.

 

 




 

Animal dealerships

and the new law

There are 43 “Class B” animal dealers
in Minnesota. “Class B” is simply a code
given these dealers by the USDA to distin-
guish them from other types of animal
handlers such as humane societies and
pounds which are also licensed by the gov—
ernment.

Individual dealers operate differently
and specialize in the collection and sale
of different animal species. Some are en-
gaged in the breeding and sale of labora—
tory rodents , and others in dogs and cats.

It is only some dealer operations which
has drawn the attention of PAL Inc, but
those few operations have kept the organi-
zation busy. Those few have additionally
been the subject of USDA suspicion and
investigation.

The animal dealer regulation bill just
passed in the 1987 legislative session will
put dealer operations under the authority
of the state’s Animal Board of Health in
August. Until that time, however, dealers
have been subject only to federal inspec-
tions of the United States Department of
Agriculture (USDA).

Some dealers have used the weak en-
forcement procedures to operate at will,
and the will has often been to make money
regardless of who pays.

Photographic exhibits of dealer prem—
ises showed lawmakers this year that some
dealers advertised their operations as ani—
mal “Shelters”. Enlarged newspaper ads
gave legislators evidence that some deal—
ers were offering to “find good homes”
for pets forfeited to their care. Testimony
further proved that “good homes” to some
dealers meant the research laboratory.

Many pet owners willingly relinquished
pets to dealers with the idea that the ani-
mals were on their ways to new families.

Dealer premises have been considered
under the law as “private property”. Own—
ers searching for lost and stolen pets were
routinely prohibited from entering onto
dealer property to view a dealer’s animal
inventory.

Record—keeping by some dealers has
been scarce, at best. In testimony by Carol
Kough this year, she explained that she
requested to see the records of one dealer
who may have been holding a number of
family pets. The dealer told Kough that
the dogs had eaten all the records. This
dealer, upon a later visit by Kough, struck
her in the back as a warning to discontinue
her investigations.

Lawmakers heard from a number of
eyewitnesses to pet theft. Only one dog
thief is known to have actually been prose—
cuted in Minnesota thusfar. That indi-
vidual told a Rochester court that he had
a drug habit which the dog theft trade
helped support.

Kough told legislators of talking person-
ally to a group of youths who pulled up
with a truckload of dogs. The youths told
Kough that there was a big party that night,
and that the dog sales would finance their
party needs.

An attorney and a high school teacher
were among those ready to tell their stories
to legislators, and a Lake City postal em-
ployee reported how she had been robbed
not once, but twice. The second time she
caught the thief and pursued him in a car
chase. The Lake City woman was finally
forced to let her dog go with the thief
when she broke the axel of her truck run—
ning at high speed over rough terrain.

Janet Lee, a blind Minneapolis woman,
told how she let her three trained dogs into
her fenced backyard, only to find them
missing a few minutes later. Lee followed
the voices of her dogs coming from within

temporarily unattended.

Lee was fOrced to break theig-carswmdow’

and released what she estlmates as about
eight anxious neighborhood dogs from the
locked vehicle.

Kough also reported that Withln the
month, she had received a call from a re—
search facility just over the Wlsconsm bor-
der. The facility had just accepted a
truckload of dogs from a Minnesota dealer.
The dogs, they told Kough, were so well
cared for, so well trained, many were
purebreds, that they feared using them in
experimentation. They ordered Kough to
do all she could to find the legitimate own-
ers quickly.

Provisions of the animal dealer bill will
become law beginning August 1 of this
year, and those provisions will place the
following regulations into effect:

 

- Dealers must post signs in all places
where they conduct the exchange of
animals from owner to dealer, and at
a place upon their property adjacent
to public postal delivery. Large signs
must inform all concerned that the
business involves the sale of animals
for research purposes. Some dealers
operate a good share of the time out
of vehicles, and have been known to
accept animals out of public buildings
like auction barns. Wording on some
vehicles and posted at public sites has
been misleading as to the true intent
for collecting animals. The 1987 bill
should correct this impropriety by de-
manding notiﬁcation at the point of
exchange of animals.

Dealers are called to present upon
notice by an authorized state or fed-
eral official, records of all individuals
having relinquished animals to dealers
for monetary consideration. The bill
will not prohibit the gift of an animal
to a dealer in which no money was
exchanged. Regulations will require
dealers to keep records of any indi-
viduals who exchanged their own ani-
mal for money, but will not prohibit
such an exchange from taking place.

Dealer premises will be held open to
any and all members of the public for
at least four hours a day on a minimum
of four days a week. During those re-
quired hours, a dealer may not pro-
hibit any law-abiding citizen from en-
tering onto his or her property to view
all animals held on that property. The
bill does not require that the four
hours on any of the four days be con-
secutive, and therefore, the public will
need to contact the dealer to find out
which hours will be held open for pub-
lic review.

effect until that time. Until the effective
date of new regulations, an owner who
believes that his or her pet is being held
on dealer property may call local enforce—
ment officials to help gain entrance to the
property. Or, they may call the USDA of-

Andria Shaine

In the last issue of Pet Scoopl, we re-
ported the success of KARE, Channel
#11’s weekly series on dogs and cats
awaiting adoption at the Minneapolis ani-
mal pound. The Friday night editions of
“Pet Savers” has accounted for new leases
on life for literally hundreds of orphaned
dogs, cats, puppies and kittens.

Following is an interview with Andria
Shaine, Channel #11 news reporter and
one of the originators of the Pet Savers

series and weekly host of that part of the
station’s 5 pm. news.

- Andria, whose idea was Pet Savers?

“This was an idea that my boss, Tom
Kirby, and I had. After doing several
stories at the Minneapolis pound when
it was under such scrutiny for its condi-
tion (the pound has since changed man-
agement and corrected matters of former
complaint) we wondered what we could
do to improve the situation. There was
some concern that fellow journalists
would not respect the idea, butTom gave
the OK. Now, it is the most popular
ser1es we a1r.”

° What keeps KARE management con-
vinced of the validity of running the
series each week?

“Audience response. All we care about
is what the viewers think. Thank good-

ness they call and leave messages for

° Have you ever fallen in love with your
featured pet?

“Yes. One day I walked into the pound
and saw something that looked like a
little black mop. I knew I had to have
it. I proceeded to get kicked out of two
apartment buildings and finally had to
buy a house. He loves it here and I love
him.”

0 What rewards do you get from doing the
Pet Savers series?

“Every Monday I call the pound to find
out what happened to the dog or cat
(featured on TV the previous Friday).
When I find out that it got a home, I am

very bad days

Active committee members experi—
enced dramatic mood swings this spring.
It seemed they were either conspicuously
joyous due to a recent legislative win, or
obviously saddened.

The sadness was very personal to those
who knew Bob Carlson and Marge Heino—
nen, two individuals who had been with
PAL Inc for years. In April, Bob died un—
expectedly from heart failure. Less than a
month later, Marge was killed when a
youth in a stolen car sped through an inter-
section in south Minneapolis.

Bob’s role in the organization was to
head fundraising events. He helped take
charge of garage sales, and it was at such
a sale last fall that a photographer wan-
dered back and forth, inspecting Bob from
all angles. He took Bob to his studio where
some test shots were performed. The
photographer had made quite a find at the
garage sale —— he’d discovered the perfect
Santa.

Of course, Santa is more than a white
beard and blushing cheeks. Certain qual-
ities must transcend the costume, and it
was those qualities which had made the

PAL Inc takes to the airwaves

In May, PAL Inc completed production
of its first Public Service Announcement
(PSA). The PSA, called “Bring Him
Home”, is a 30—second spot which speaks
to responsible pet ownership.

The message tells owners to keep pets
confined, to always have identification on
pets, to know where the pounds are, and
informs them that there are 26 animal col-
lection units in the Twin Cities which must

photographer’s discovery so priceless —
for Bob Carlson had the gentle attitude
and generosity of St. Nick himself.

Perhaps the commercial world of Christ—
mas hype has lost one Santa look-alike,
but the much smaller sphere of people and
animals whom Bob touched personally,
has lost the real thing.

From her daytime job as senior social
worker, Marge Heinonen would return to
her Plymouth townhome to tend to her
three cats and one dog, most of which had
been rescued from a previous life of neg—
lect or cruelty. Just weeks before her death,
Marge had said yes to taking one more
cat; or so she thought.

The Calico which had been pulled from
a dumpster, did not travel alone to Marge’s
house. Uncanny luck brought Marge a
total of six with the birth of the dumpster
cat’s five kittens

Knowing how Marge felt about animal
welfare and the work PAL Inc was trying
to accomplish, her family requested all
memorials to the organization. PAL Inc
received more than $500 in contributions
from Marge’s friends. We thank those con—

be checked in the event of a lost pet.'The
spot concludes by offering the public a
free copy of PAL Inc’s guide to the Twin
Cities-area pounds.

The spot has been selected for airing
on several Twin Cities stations.

PAL Inc wants to take this opportunity
to thank Gannett productions for their ex—
cellent work in producing the video, and
the number of extras which Gannett pro-
vided.

cared for correctly. Then I realize that I
can only do so much. Sometimes we do
follow-ups to see (how the animal is
doing)”

What was your response, and that of
management’s, to receiving the PAL Inc
PIP award last year? (PAL Inc awarded
Andria Shaine and the Channel #11
news team with one of five “Promoting
an Informed Public” (PIP) award at its
1986 annual dinner for outstanding
coverage of animal-related issues by the
local media.

“They were very proud . . . so proud
that they took the plaque away from me
and put it in a showcase.”

0 Do you have any stories regarding inci-
dents that have happened while you were
shooting Pet Savers?

“The first time we decided to take a dog
outside and tape it, it ran off. We all
took off in different directions, hoping
to catch him. I ended up in a snow bank
covered with mud. The photographer
shot it and aired it that way.”

“Fund” celebrates
20th anniversary

  

by Barbara Zell,
Minnesota chairman
The Fund for Animals

PAL Inc congratulates The Fund for
Animals on its 20th anniversary.

The Fund for Animals was founded in
1967, by author and well-known personal—
ity, Cleveland Amory. The organization is
one of the largest anti—cruelty societies in
the world, backed by over 300,000 mem-
bers.

The Fund combats cruelty to animals
locally, nationally and internationally. It
works on the scene, behind the scenes, in
the courts and in the media with direct
activism. Our tools are legislation, litiga—
tion, education and confrontation.

Thousands of volunteers make up the
Fund and they’re located from Nome to
Minnesota to Nairobi. We don’t study ani-
mal problems because animal problems,
like the animals themselves, have been
studied to death. Instead, we do something
about the problems.

Our Black Beauty Ranch in Texas is
over 700 acres of “heaven on earth” for
rescued animals. Living there are the res-
cued San Clemente goats, pigs, burros,
horses, COnga the elephant, Nim the
chimp and a multitude of other critters
who now live their lives with dignity and
love.

Oh where , oh where
has my little dog gone?

Finding a lost pet in Minnesota can
throw a pet owner into days of frustration.
The number of facilities in which lost pets
can be held is great, and the number of
ways by which lost pets can enter facilities
is equally endless.

Then there is the time element when
searching for a lost pet. Pounds are only
required to keep a pet five days, after
which time it may be euthanised, sold to
a dealer, sold directly to a research facility,
or if the pound has such a program, it may
be adopted out. Most pounds do not have
adoption programs. The city of Min-
neapolis does, St. Paul and many suburban
operations do not.

Even given the adoption option, most
owners of lost pets will choose “none of
the above”. The only acceptable altema-
tive is having the pet back home.

Where does an owner begin looking for
a lost pet?

There is no easy answer, but there is a
course of action for the responsible owner
to take —— before the pet becomes lost.

Be prepared with the names and addres-
ses of pounds, humane societies and shel-
ters in your broad area. Know how those
individual facilities operate and what their
policies are as to handling of pets taken
1n.

There are 26 municipal animal collec-
tion agencies and almost as many holding
facilities for lost pets in the Twin Cities
area. PAL Inc is the only organization
which has researched the location of all
Twin Cities pounds, and a brochure listing
of these pounds is available free of charge.
This brochure is your starting point to find
out where the pounds are in your district.

There are additionally 38 humane
societies in the state, not all of which have
facilities for holding animals. The Animal
Humane Society on Meadow Lane in
Golden Valley is the most well-known so-
ciety — but not the only one. Other ani—
mal-holding societies are located in St.
Paul, Afton, Coon Rapids, Delano and
elsewhere in the seven-county area.

Any pound or humane society can be
holding your lost pet.

Humane societies generally do not col-
lect animals from the streets, but rather
accept animals brought into them by own-
ers or finders of lost animals. Where
pounds are tax—supported, most humane
societies are privately funded through do—
nations.

Now, for the exceptions, and there are
enough to make the complicated job of
finding a lost pet an almost superhuman
task.

A few humane societies d0 hold munici-
pal contracts to act as pounds. Two exam-
ples of this dual function are the St. Croix
Animal Shelter, and the newly-opened
Anoka Humane Society. Both of these
facilities are members of the state’s Feder-
ation of Humane Societies and adopt their
names from that side of their role in animal
handhng.

Yet, both are licensed by communities
to collect lost pets from the street and hold
them under state law. Anoka Humane
holds the animal collection contracts in
Coon Rapids and Spring Lake Park. The
St. Croix shelter is hired by the com—
munities of Bayport, Hastings, Lakeland,
Lake St. Croix Beach, Oak Park Heights,
Stillwater, Vermillion and Woodbury to
collect dogs and cats on the loose.

Throw in yet another confusing ingre—
dient the pound which holds a Class B
dealer’s license to act as an independent
business in the sale of animals to research.
Such is the case of at least two Twin Cities
pounds — Oak Crest Kennels in Inver
Grove Hts, and McAllister Kennels which
collects animals for the communities of
Jordan, Lakeville, New Prague, Savage
and Shakopee.

If you are surprised by the various twists
and turns which could face you should
you leave a gate or door opened, you will
want to know where to begin the search
for your family member. Only you can
prepare yourself for that day, and it is re-
commended you begin your preparations
today.

The Animal Humane Society in Henne—
pin County has begun a new service to
help persons who have lost or found pets.

A computerized lost and found service
has Society staff on duty 57 hours a week
to match owners with lost pets. The pro-
cess is based on owners, or finders, of
lost pets calling the lost and found service
number to report missing and found dogs
and cats.

Society personnel take extensive infor-
mation from callers, including a complete
description of the animal lost or found,
the location at which the loss or find took
place, ID attached to the animal if any,
and any other data which might aid staff
in helping to locate the animal or owner.

Society staff additionally calls each list—
er of a lost or found animal in the daily
newspaper to gain necessary information
on the pet, and each animal brought into
the Society by finders are also registered
with the service.

When an owner calls the service to re-
port a lost animal, Society workers begin
an electronic search for possible matches
with a found pet.

It’s a fairly sophisticated tracking sys-
tem but the story lies in the fact that the
system is working.

“We are currently getting an average of
15 calls per day to report either lost or

 

ordinances and facility policies. Receive
your Second Chance tag(s) to put a backup
system in motion should you lose your pet.

Be prepared. Waiting until it’s neces-
sary, is very often too late.

Humane Society Director of Operations.

“We are returning lost animals to their
homes at the rate of three to four per week.
It isn’t an outstanding record, yet, but
much of the program’s success depends
upon the public knowing that the service
exists and using it.”

Phones are staffed between the hours
of 9:30 am. and 6:00 pm. Monday
through Saturday, and from noon to 6:00
pm. on Sunday.

The phone number to call if you lose
or find a pet is: (612) 522-7130, or you
can call The Animal Humane Society and
ask to be transferred to the lost and found
department.

{centinaeé}

Over the past three years The Fund has
rounded up, rescued and adopted out over
two—thirds of all the wild burros in the
country. More than 200 of themeautiful
animals live with families in Minnesota.

Man has an infinite capacity to ration-
alize his cruelty to animals. It is the weak
who are cruel. Gentleness can only be ex-
pected from the strong. The Fund will con-
tinue to declare that all animals shall enjoy
freedom from fear, pain and suffering,
whether in the name of science, sport,

fashion or food. .
One of our local fundralsers 1s com1ng

up at State Fair time. Our booth will once
again be in the Grandstand Building at the
fairgrounds. We will have literature for dis-
tribution and T—shirts to sell. Volunteers
are needed to help at the booth.

REPORT OF 1987 ACTIVITIES

The Secretary of Agriculture reports
annually on the enforcement and
administration of the Animal Welfare
Act (AWA) (7 0.5.0. 2131 et. seq.),
as required by section 25 of the
Act. That section states "This
report as well as any supporting
documents, data, or findings shall
not be released to any other
persons, non-Federal agencies, or
organizations unless and until it
has been made public by an
appropriate committee of the Senate
or the House of Representatives."

This report covers Fiscal Year (FY)
1987, which began October 1, 1986,
and ended September 30, 1987.

Summary

U.S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA) officials inspected 6,732
licensed or registered facilities
(8,244 sites) at an average rate of
1.6 times per site in FY 1987 to
enforce compliance with the AWA.
When inspections disclosed
deficiencies, USDA inspectors
advised owners or managers of what
corrections were necessary to bring
their facilities into compliance.

Facilities with repeated
deficiencies or critical or flagrant
violations required formal action.
After thorough investigations, 145
apparent violation cases were
forwarded to the USDA's Office of
the General Counsel for
consideration of administrative
prosecution. Forty-four cases were
settled through procedures resulting
in the imposition of license suSpen-
sions or revocations, cease-and-
desist orders, civil penalties, or a
combination of these sanctions.

USDA settled an additional 180
less serious violations by
implemented Notice of Warning.

An annual report of research
activities (VS Form 18-23) was
submitted by 1,260 public and
private research facilities and
160 Federal research facilities.
These reports show that 58.2
percent of laboratory animals
protected under the AWA were not
exposed to painful or distressing
procedures. Another 35.2 percent
of the animals were administered
anesthetics, analgesics, or
tranquilizers. For 6.6 percent of
the animals, facilities did not
provide pain relief because it
would have interfered with test or
research results.

ApprOpriation for FY 1987

The appropriation for animal
welfare enforcement foerY 1987

"6§§:§31382m11i1od1 Of this sum,

$750,000 was allocated to the
National Agricultural Library for
the deve10pment of an information
system. The information system
was established under the 1985
amendment to the Act (Public Law
99-198) to help prevent unneeded
duplication of animal experi-
ments, and to provide information
on improved methods of experiments
so as to reduce pain.

Legislation

 

Animal welfare legislation enacted
in 1966 (Public Law 89-544)
regulated animal dealers who were
raising dogs and cats for
laboratory research, as well as
laboratories conducting research
on dogs, cats, hamsters, guinea
pigs, rabbits, and nonhuman
primates.

About the Author

After a two-year term as
Chairman of the Animal
Welfare Committee of the
British Veterinary Associa-
tion, Dr. John Seamer is
now the official nominee to
become Honorary Secretary
of the EVA in September
1983. He has played a lead-

internationally. He has

‘ erinarian makes a solemn declaration and a promise that

‘ “my constant endeavour will be to emure the welfare of
animals committed to my care.” All full members of the
EVA are members of the RCVS. Thus, although many
people and professions play a part in animal welfare in
Britain, veterinarians have a particularly important role to
play by virtue of their solemn promise. T

The interest of British veterinarians in animal experi-
mentation goes back at least into the latter half of
the nineteenth century when experiments on animais be—
came a matter of public‘concern. Veterinarians were
particularly disturbed that in FrancefullyFQnscious
animals were being used for physiological experiments
and for surgical practice. This general concern led to the
passage in 1876 of the Cruelty to'Animals Act, which
has dominated British thinking-and practice for 100

» years despite the enormous advances that have been

made in science, and particularly in biology and zine;-
thesia, during that time.

The Cruelty to Animals Act was intended to permit
experiments on vertebrate animals—that is to say, it
permits the infliction of pain on animals for scientific
purposes but with safeguards. The term experiment is
not defined under the act, but it has come to mean a
procedure that is calculated to cause pain when carried
out on a living vertebrate animal to test a hypothesis or
to provide unknown information—in other words, to
answer a scientific question. Demonstrations on live
animals, mostly undertaken to instruct undergraduates
in physiology, also are covered by the act. Experiments
on animals are usually permitted only in universities,
research institutes, and on the premises of commercial
firms, although provisions exist for experiments to be
conducted on farms or under natural conditions where
necessary. About 600 places are registered for the con-
duct of experiments.

LICENSING PROCEDURES

To carry out an animal experiment a scientist must have
a license from the Home Office, which is the Depart-
ment of State responsible for administering the act.
Licenses are given only to scientists or senior technicians
and are obtained by applicatiOn to the Home Office.
The application must be recommended by a professor of
certain medical Sciences and also by a president of one

of several learned societies. The license permits only ex-
periments that are carried out completely under anes-
thesia, in which the animal is killed before it recovers
consciousness. In some experiments an anesthetic is un-
necessary or‘would conflict with the purpose of the ex-
periment. An exemption from the use of anesthetics is
granted in these cases by obtaining a Certificate A.
There are occasions when it is necessary to anesthetize
an animal and to allow it to recover. Exemption from
the requirement to kill an animal before it regains con-
sciousness is granted by obtaining a Certiﬁcate B.
Authority to use animals for demonstrations is granted
with a Certiﬁcate C. Cats, dogs, and Equidae have
always had a special position, and experiments on these
animals require separate permission, which also is
granted by certificates. All of these certificates, which
contain limitations on the procedures that may be done,
are obtained by application to the HomeOffice in a sim-
ilar way to the application for licenses. Holders of
licenses and certificates are required to declare annually
to the Home Ofﬁce the number of experiments they
have undertaken, and an analysis of these statistics is
submitted to Parliament and published each year. ' ’

The act is administered by 15 inspectors who have.

medical or veterinary qualiﬁcations. Inspectors inter-
view existing and prospective license holders; discuss
new procedures with them; and check premises, animal

12

husbandry practices, and the animals under experiment
to ensure that the welfare of the animals is safeguarded
and that legal provisions are met. Although the inspec-
torate has legal powers, it is not a police force; inspec-
tors are administrators and advisers to the Home Of ficc
and to the scientific community. The Home Secretary
also receives advice from the Advisory Committee on
Animal Experiments. This committee, which was re-
formed in 1979, has, among others, two members with
veterinary qualifications.

Although there are about 20,000 persons licensed to
perform animal experiments in Britain today, only
about 12,000 are actively engaged in this work. In 1981,
the last year for which figures are available, there were
4,344,843 animal experiments (Command 8657, 1982).
Most of these (80 percent) were carried out with rats and
mice; 6,186 monkeys, 13,459 dogs, 8,016 cats, and 434
equine animals also were used. Many animals are used
in association with the pharmaceutical industry, and in
1981 more than half the experiments reported were per-
formed by one-fifth of the license holders, working for
commercial concerns.

HISTORICAL BASIS FOR BVA POLICY
General Information

A number of problems arise in applying the 1876 Cruelty
to Animals Act today. For example, the system of licens-
ing, which worked well in a small scientific community
where most 0f the members were known to each other,
is no longer appropriate. The act contains no definition
or evaluation of pain—a problem referred to later in
this paper. There is also no definition of what consti-
tutes an experiment, and the deﬁnition that has evolved
is not entirely satisfactory. There are a number of scien-
tiﬁc procedures that cause pain in animals, but since
they do not ask a question they are not considered
experiments under the act. ’An example of this is the use
of animals for the passage of viruses and tumors. In
1876 most animal experiments were a surgical or physio-
logical nature. Animals were not used to test drugs and
vaccines, and the LDso test, which has recently caused
so much concern, had not been devised. Thus, although
it was contemplated at the time that most experiments
would be done under anesthesia, the vast majority are
now done without it.

Control animals, which accompany the experimental
animals throughout the procedure but which may them-
selves receive no painful treatment whatsoever, are not
included under the terms of the act nor does the act ap-
ply to the breeding and supply of animals for experi-
mental purposes. Protection of these animals is ac-
corded under the Protection of Animals Act of 1911,
which excludes anything lawfully done under the Cruel-
ty to Animals Act. Lastly, in their concern to protect

ILAR NEWS

 




 

animals from those who would want to practice surgery
on them, the legislators of the nineteenth century specif-
ically prohibited the use of animals for the acquisition
of manual skill. Thus, the use of animals by surgeons to
become proficient in such techniques as microsurgery,
which will save human lives and restore bodily function,
is prohibited.

The number of animal experiments increased from
about 480 in 1878 to 46,073 in 1906, and public concern
grew. A Royal Commission on animal experiments was
set up in 1906 under the chairmanship of Sir John
McFadyean, Principal of the Royal Veterinary College,
London. The commission reported in 1912. Among its
recommendations was the proposal that the Home
Secretary should be advised by an advisory committee.
The most important recommendation referred to pain,
and as a result new wording was added to each Home
Office license to the effect that if an animal on experi-
ment is suffering severe pain that is “likely to endure” it
shall be painlessly killed, even if the object of the experi-
ment has not been attained. The wording “likely to en—
dure” is important. Three of the eight members of the
commission had reservations; they thought that animals
suffering severe pain should be killed at once (Hume,
1947).

In line with the expansion of science, the usage of
animals steadily increased, and in 1943 the total number
of animal experiments passed the 1,000,000 mark. At
this time scientists recognized that the uniformity and
quality of animals available for research was not satis-
factory and a Conference on the Supply of Experimen-
tal Animals was set up. The conference included repre-
sentatives from several learned societies, including the
Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons and the National
Veterinary Medical Association, the forerunner of the

EVA (Anonymous, 1947). The conference reported to _

the Agricultural Research Council and the Medical
Research Council, and in 1947 the latter established the
Laboratory Animals Bureau, later to become the Labo-
ratory Animals Centre, with the general aim of improv-
ing the quality of laboratory animals and advising and
assisting commercial animal breeders.

The rapid postwar increase in the use of animals for
experiments led to greatly increased interest in their
husbandry and welfare by scientists and others. A land—
mark was the enunciation of the 3 R’s by Russell and
Burch (1959): replacement of animals by nonsentient
systems wherever possible, refinement of experimental
procedures to obtain humanely the best possible results,
and reduction of numbers of animals used to the very
minimum that will serve a useful purpose.

Littlewood Committee

In the early 19608 public concern led the government to

CStabliSh a departmental committee to consider animal

experimentation. This, the Littlewood Committee, had

/a terinarian as a member and received evidence from
,‘th BVA. The committee pondered the question of pain
in animals and proposed that within the concept of pain
three states of suffering should be recognized:

I. Discomfort (as may be characterized by such nega-
tive signs as poor condition, torpor, and diminished ap-
petite).

2. Stress (i.e., a condition of tension or anxiety pre—
dictable or readily explicable from environmental
causes, whether distinct from or including physical
causes).

3. Pain (recognizable by more positive signs, such as
struggling, screaming or squealing, convulsions, and
severe palpitation).

Although these points can be criticized, they have the
considerable advantage of simplifying and clarifying
what the legislation should be about. The use of a single
word such as pain or suffering clearly defined in the law
would greatly facilitate its interpretation and adminis-
tration. Although the Littlewood Committee concluded
in its report (Command 2641, 1965) that nothing was
seriously amiss, it recommended improvements it
wanted to achieve by new legislation.

The law remained unchanged, but many of the Little-
wood recommendations were effected administratively
by the Home Office. This was possible because the 1876
Cruelty to Animals Act is loosely drawn, and so the
Secretary of State for Home Affairs can exercise his dis-
cretion by administrative means. This useful lesson
should be remembered when new legislation on animal
Cx-perimentation is drafted. The law should be suffi-
ciently flexible to meet both present and future re-
quirements, requirements that may change rapidly with
scientific progress.

LDs'o Test

More recently there has been concern about the greatly
increased numbers of animals used in potency, toxicity,
and safety tests on drugs and other chemicals. In 1977
the Home Secretary asked the advisory committee to
look into the LDso test. Carefully planned and properly
executed, this test can provide useful information in
numerical form. Various national and international reg-
ulatory bodies have, therefore, come to require an LD50
test of substances before issuing iicenses for their use.
The authority of these bodies is such that their re-

- quirements, although not always legally mandatory,

tend to be regarded as such. In fact a cynic has con-
trasted the 3 R’:-. of Russell and Burch with the 4 R’s of a
regulatory authority, which recommends prOcedures,
requests them, and then requires them; and, ﬁnally, if
the requirements are'not met, rejects (the data sub-
mitted. l f 1 ’ ” -

l

The advisory committee reported (Repo ~; 1979) that
properly conducted LDso tests should cont \ue"; but it
urged closer liaison between authorities regulating the
potency and safety of drugs and the Home Ofﬁce so
that the welfare of animals might receive more consid-
eration. In this the committee reﬂected views advanced
earlier by the BVA and the Laboratory Animal Science
Association (Seamer, 1977). The committee also recom-
mended that experiments on primates be subject to the
same safeguards as those for dogs, cats, and Equidae,
and, again, because of the flexibility of the 1876 act, the
Home Office has effected this recommendation admin-
istratively.

Parliamentary Activity

During the last 10-15 years there have been a number of
attempts, mostly by way of private members’ bills in
Parliament, to change the legal status of animal experi-
ments. Most of these bills were very restrictive, if not
completely abolitionist, and all failed to reach the
statute book. The two most notable and most recent
were the Halsbury Bill introduced into the Lords and
the Fry Bill introduced into the House of Commons in
1979. Although both bills failed to pass, it is noteworthy
that there was a shift from the extreme views of aboli-
tionists and experimentalists, so that a redrafted version
of the Halsbury Bill received support from both groups.
Before the 1979 general election the three major polit-
ical parties included in their manifestos proposals to
revise the law on animal experiments; these were also a
feature of the 1983 election manifestos. After the 1979
election the Conservative Government repeatedly af-
ﬁrmed its intention to introduce new legislation, and the
Home Ofﬁce advisory committee made proposals for
changes in the law (Report, 1981). However, the govern-
ment decided not to act until the Council of Europe
Convention on the Protection of Animals used for Ex-
perimental and Industrial Purposes had been ﬁnalized.

Western European Activity

The legislation on animal experimentation in 21 West-
ern European countries (all member states of the Coun-
cil of Europe) has been summarized by Erichsen (1982).
Lichtenstein does not permit animal experiments, while
in six other member states regulatory legislation is mini-
mal or nonexistent (Cyprus, Greece, Malta, Portugal,
Spain, and Turkey). The remaining 14 states (Austria,
Belgium, Denmark, Federal Republic of Germany,
France, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, The Neth-
erlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United
Kingdom) all have regulatory controls. The law in
Ireland is essentially the same as that in Britain. Apart
from the Italian law, which dates from 1941, the legisla-

tion current in the remaining 11 countries was enacted

or revised after 1960.

I4

 

  

.
d

In all 14 states permission or a license is necessary to
conduct animal experiments. In some countries an ex-
periment is deﬁned as any scientiﬁc or industrial pro-
cedure performed on a live animal, regardless of
whether pain, suffering, or other harm results. In other
countries only those procedures that cause pain or suf-
fering are considered experiments. In nine countries the
legislation applies only to vertebrates, while in others all
animal species are included.

In France, as in Britain and Ireland, a system of indi-
vidual licensing for experiments is in force. In Norway,
Denmark, The Netherlands, and some other countries,
licenses are granted to institutions. Institutional licenses
usually require the presence of a specially competent
person within the organization who may delegate
authority to other persons to conduct animal experi-
ments under his supervision and guidance. A third type
of license, the project license, is issued by authorities in
the Federal Republic of Germany and Switzerland for
each experiment or series of experiments. In Austria and
West Germany a system of authorization for certain
types of experiments is contained in the law itself, and
these can be conducted without further formality. In
Sweden all animal experiments are appraised by ethics
committees with scientific and lay members before they
are sanctioned. All states that have a licensing system
also operate some form of inspection.

Federation of Veterinarians of the European Economic
Community

The Federation of Veterinarians of Europe (FVE) of the
European EcOnomic Community represents a wide
range of professional interests of veterinarians at na-
tional and European levels from those countries that
form the Community (Belgium, Denmark, Federal Re-
public of Germany, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy,
Luxembourg, The Netherlands, and the United King-
dom). Other Western European countries send ob-
servers to FVE meetings. At its meeting in Rome in Oc-
tober 1982, the FVE accepted the principles set out in
the BVA policy document on animal experimentation.
The F VE has had observer status at meetings of the Ad
Hoc Committee of Experts, whichis drawing up a
Council of Europe Convention on animal experiments.

Council of Europe Convention

The Council of Europe represents 21 Western European
countries. It aims to safeguard the European heritage
and improve economic and social progress. In 1971 its
Consultative Assembly produced Recommendation 621 ,
which proposed the formation of an Ad Hoc Committee
of Experts “to study problems arising out of the use of
live animals for experimental or industrial purposes.”
The committee has worked to produce a convention.
Progress has been very slow,- ,butit now (June 1983) ap—

pears to be almost ready for approval by the Council of
Ministers. The BVA has provided evidence to the British
national delegation to the Committee of Experts and
was also represented at a Public Parliamentary Hearing
at Strasbourg 1n December 1982. When the convention
is accepted by the Council of Europe each member
country will be obliged to adopt legislation that is no
less stringent.

BVA POLICY ON ANIMAL EXPERIMENTATION

It is against the background outlined above that the
BVA has in recent years given much thought to the
problems arising from animal experiments and their
control. Initially a brief policy statement was produced,
but this was considerably expanded in 1980, and some
further revisions have also been made. The full current
policy, as approved in March 1983, is attached to this
article as an appendix.

Need for Animal Experiments

The BVA recognizes the need for animal experiments to
advance biological knowledge, to improve human and
animal health, and for essential safety and potency
tests. Nevertheless the BVA supports the principles of
the 3 R’s, refine, reduce, and replace, and would
welcome the replacement of animal experiments when-
ever this can satisfactorily be done. In a departure from
the present legal requirements the BVA would require
all experimental or scientiﬁc procedures that are likely
to cause pain to animals to be legally controlled, for ex-
ample, the production of antisera. Clinical veterinary
procedures would of course be excluded. The BVA has
not expressed a view on control animals, but to this
writer it would seem illogical if these animals, which are
frequently in cages adjacent to those on experiment,
were not protected by the same legislation that covers
animals on experiment. The use of anesthetized ani-
mals, which are not allowed to recover, for demonstra-
tions in higher education should continue to be per-
mitted but should be rigidly controlled and kept to a
tminimum. In a departure from current practice the
BVA believes that in exceptional circumstances it should
be permissible to use animals for the‘acquisition of
manual skill, as in the case of surgeons practicing micro-
surgical techniques for use in man. This would mean
that the animals would be anesthetized and allowed to
recover. However, the BVA does not believe that nor-
mal living animals should be used by veterinary students
to acquire or practice surgical skills. Rather, these skills
should continue to be acquired as at present by the use
of cadavers and later by supervised instruction on sick
or injured animals that require treatment.

Apart from the foregoing the BVA has not expressed
views about what sorts of experiments should be al-
lowed. Proposals to conduct experiments should be ac-

Volume XXVll, Number 1, Fall 1983

  

cepted or refused by the Home Office aided by advice
from the advisory committee. This committee is re-
garded as the keeper of the public conscience and should
reflect what is or is not publicly desirable or acceptable
at any given time, particularly in terms of new and unus-
ual procedures and the numbers of animals used in tests.

Experimental Animals

Although not stated, the BVA believes in the equality of
all animal species and would not, therefore, offer the
current special treatment for cats, dogs, horses, and
monkeys. Rather, it feels that all species should be
treated according to their own particular physiological
needs and that the conservation of wild species must be
taken into account. Recognizing the concern frequently
expressed in Britain that pet dogs and cats should not be
stolen for use in research (even though this is believed to
be a rare occurrence), the BVA would require that dogs
and cats taken from the streets never be used for ex-
periments. As a general principle it believes that animals
to be used for research should be bred for that purpose.
Exceptions to this general rule should be made in the
case of farm animals and for scientific purposes, such as
the study of disease in wild animals, but financial
grounds alone should not be a sufficient reason for such
an exception to be made. The BVA believes that a code
of pracrice should be drawn up to maintain satisfactory
standards for the husbandry and welfare of animals
bred, supplied, transported, and used for experiments.
Experimenters, animal technicians, and others should
be legally obliged to meet the provisions of this code.

Registration of Facilities

Premises where animals are bred, kept for supply, or ex-
perimented on should be registered. As a condition of
registration it should be necessary to demonstrate that
proper facilities, management, and trained staff are
available as well as the services of a full- or part-time
veterinary surgeon. The veterinarian’s duty would be to
ensure the proper care and welfare of the animals. He
would thus act as the “animals’ friend” and as such
would be responsible to the senior manager of the labo-
ratory, who in turn would be identified to the Home Of-
ﬁce as the person responsible for the conduct of the
registered premises. The identiﬁcation of an animals’
friend could, if required, replace some or all of the func-
tions of an ethics committee. .,

The BVA believes that the law must safeguard the
welfare of animals but that its provisions and adminis-
tration must recognize the value of science and of the
work that experimenters carry out. Theexperimenter
must be accountable for his conduct, but he should not,
as has recently and regrettably been the case, be sub-
jected to harassment and molestation from extremist
groups. ' '

  

 




Pain

In practical terms the problem is to evaluate, in the liv-
ing animal, pain and other unpleasant sensations, such
as discomfort and distress, and to determine and regu-
late what is acceptable. All animals, even the most sim-
ple, are sensitive to some external stimuli. Progression
up the evolutionary tree increases the range of stimuli to
which animals are sensitive, and in higher animals there
is consciousness rather than mere sensitivity. In-
telligence and memory, in addition to consciousness, ex-
ist in the very highly developed species. Somewhere
along this scale certain stimuli can be recognized, by the
recipients at least, as painful. Humans recognize that
some stimuli are more painful than others, and this
almost certainly holds true for higher animals. Similar-
ly, pain can be of long or short duration, and who is to
say whether short but severe pain is worse than milder
pain of longer standing? It is paradoxical that so little is
known about the interpretation of pain and suffering in
animals, although in a recent book Dawkins (1980) in-
dicates areas in which scientific progress is being made.
Perhaps our understanding of pain may increase sud-
denly and rapidly, as it occasionally does in other areas
of science.

In these circumstances the BVA had adopted as a
yardstick the Littlewood categories of discomfort,
stress, and pain. The BVA believes that anesthesia,
analgesia, or other measures designed to alleviate pain,
consistent with the standards of contemporary veteri-
nary practice, should be applied in experimental pro-
cedures unless they are more distressing than the ,pro—
cedure itself or unless they would conflict with the
purpose of the procedure. if a procedure is likely to
cause pain, suffering, or distress of more than momen-
tary duration of trivial intensity, which cannot be allevi-
ated, prior authorization from the Home Office should
be required. Such authorization should be given only
when the procedure is judged to be of exceptional im-
portance in meeting essential needs of man or animals.
All licenses should contain provisions to ensure that any
animal that suffers severe pain or severe distress that
cannot be alleviated should be killed painlessly, even if
the object of the experiment has not been achieved. It
should be recognized that the criteria proposed by the
BVA'are more restrictive than those currently in force
and that certain experiments currently undertaken
would no longer be permissible.

AGREEMENT WITH OTHER ANIMAL WELFARE
GROUPS

As a result of public discussion on animal experimenta-
tion, the BVA held consultations with other interested
organizations, notably CRAE and FRAME. The prin-
cipal aim of FRAME is suggested by its name: the Fund
for Replacement of Animals in Medical Experiments.

l6

CRAE-the Committee for the Reform of Animal EX-
perimentation—is a loosely knit group representing
parliamentarians and science, medicine, and animal
welfare societies. During the course of discussions it
became apparent that the BVA’s policies were substan-
tially acceptable to CRAE and FRAME. (The policies
contained in the appendix to this article, which were ac-
cepted by the BVA Council in March I983, have also
been approved by CRAE and FRAME.) This is a sig-
nificant advance because, for the first time, a large pro-
portion of the British animal welfare community has
adopted a common policy. A joint policy statement was
sent to the Secretary of State of Home Affairs and to all
members of Parliament, where it has been welcomed
not only by the government but also by press, radio, and
television commentators.

WHITE PAPER ON ANIMAL EXPERIMENTATION

Just before the June 1983 election the Conservative
Government produced a white paper on animal experi-
mentation (Command 8883, 1981). (A white paper is the
recognized means by which the British Government an-
nounces, for consultation, proposals for legislation on a
given topic.) The government proposals include the
establishment of a new animal procedures committee of
12 members, two-thirds of whom would be drawn from
medicine, veterinary science, and the other biological
sciences. The committee would perform the general func-
tions of the present advisory committee, considering
matters referred to it by the Home Secretary, including
questions of policy, practice,_procedure, trends in ex-
perimental and scientific work, the development of al-
ternatives to animals in experiments, and proposals for
revision in the law. It will also have an enhanced role in
advising on the administration of the new controls. The
Home Secretary will consult with the committee on the
standard conditions to which all licenses will be subject
and on specified areas of work, such as cosmetics, that
the Secretary regards as giving rise to special concern.

The proposals include the extension of controls to the
breeding and supply of animals for experiment. The
controls will extend to all living nonhuman vertebrates
in accordance with the draft European Convention and
will apply to any experimental or scientific procedure
that may cause pain,"suffering, distress, or lasting harm.
The present British pain clause, prOhibiting severe pain
that is likely to endure, would be maintained. However,
there is a categorical statement that no exceptions to this
condition would be permitted, even though these are
provided for in the Council of Europe Convention. The
prohibition on the use of animals for the acquisition of
manual skill for microsurgery will be lifted. Work on
primates, but no other species, would continue to re-
quire special authorization. ‘

The controls would be administered and supervised ‘

by a strengthened inspectorate with medical or veteri-
nary qualiﬁcations. Individual scientists would continue
to need a license to carry out experiments, and a system
of project licenses would be introduced. Applications
for a personal license would require sponsorship from a
senior license holder with personal knowledge of the an
plicant. A project license would require sponsorship
from a professor in a relevant discipline, or some similar
person, who would be asked to pass an opinion on the
likelihood of success of the project; the possibility of
success of an alternative, nonsentient method; the type
of animals to be used; and the adequacy of the proposed
use of anesthesia or analgesia.

Establishments at which experiments are to be per-
formed would continue to require registration. The
Home Secretary would be empowered to attach general
or particular conditions to certificates of registration.
Conditions would be attached to all certificates to en-
sure that (l) a named person or persons would have day-
to-day responsibility for seeing that the conditions of
registration were being fulﬁlled; (2) a veterinary surgeon
would be available and responsible for advice on animal
health and welfare; (3) adequate staff would be avail-
able for animal care; (4) care and accommodation
would be appropriate for the animals; and (5) environ-
mental conditions would bechecked daily. Fees would
be payable for licenses and registration.

The government welcomed the joint submission from
the EVA, CRAE, and FRAME and noted that there was
a large measure of agreement between their joint pro-
posals and those of the government itself. This 15 indeed
so. Many of the EVA proposals have been met, al-
though not necessarily in the way envisaged in the policy
statement. However, on the all-important subject of
pain the government’s proposal to maintain the existing
pain clause is not as restrictive as the EVA, CRAE, and
FRAME would wish, and these organizations will
doubtless continue to press for the achievement in full
of their proposals in new legislation that the newly
returned Conservative Government is expected to in—
troduce.

APPENDIX
BVA Policy on Animal Experimentation

INTRODUCTION

Experiments on animals to advance biological knowledge,
to improve human and animal health and welfare and for
essential safety and potency tests have led, and continue to
lead, to significant beneﬁts for man and animals. Such experi-
ments should continue provided that the new legislation safe-
guards the welfare of animals used in experiments by incor-
porating the provisions detailed below.

1. PROCEDURES AND ANIMALS

A procedure, for the purposes of the legislation, should be
defined as any experimental or scientific act involving in-
terference with or departure from the normal condition of
well-being of an animal, which may cause pain, suffering,
distress or lasting harm. All procedures should come within
the scope of the legislation and it should be an offence to
carry out a procedure without authority. There must be suit-
able exemption for the performance of veterinary procedures
carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Veteri—
nary Surgeons’ Act of 1966 and amendments.

The legislation should apply to all non-human animals in
the sub-phylum Vertebrata including the foetuses of animals
and the embryonic or larval forms of other classes that have
attained a stage of development capable of discrete existence
outside the egg or maternal tract.

2. ACCEPTABLE PURPOSES

Procedures should be allowed only for one or more of the
following purposes: —

(a) The avoidance, prevention, diagnosis or treatment of
disease, ill-health or other abnormality, or their effects in
man, animal or plant. This purpose includes the production
and safety testing of medicinal products and other substances,
the quality control of foods, and the development of surgical
techniques.

(b) The assessment or detection of physiological condi-
tions, including the diagnosis of pregnancy.

(c) The prolongation of life of man, animal or plant.

((1) The protection of the natural environment.

(e) The breeding of animals.

(1) The advancement of biological knowledge.

(g) Some educational and training purposes. The use of
anaesthetised animals which are not allowed to recover con-
sciousness for the acquisition of manual skill should be per-
missible under strictly controlled conditions. SurvivaLsurgery
for the acquisition of manual skill should be permitted only in.
exceptional circumstances such as training in micro-surgery.
The use of recorded material for demonstration in higher
education should be extended.

5. LICENSING OF PREMISES AND PLACES

All procedures under the legislation must be carried out on
premises or places licensed for the purpose. The licence for
the premises or places should specify the types of procedures
which may be carried out. The licence should identify two or
more people by name: -

(a) The person or persons ultimately responsible for the
care of the animals in the premises or places; and

(b) the veterinary surgeon, either from the staff of the
establishment or employed on a part-time basis, responsible
for advice on animal health and welfare.

A legally enforceable Code of Practice should lay down re-
quired standards for premises, places and facilities available
for the care of the animals and for the carrying out of the
licensed procedures.

The Code should specify that a sufficient number of compe-
tent staff are available at all times to care for the animals,
especially those that have undergone surgical interference.
The Code should also specify that an animal used or intended
for use in a procedure is provided with suitable and adequate
accommodation, an environment, sufficient freedom of
movement, and food and water appropriate to its health and
well-being. The environmental conditions should be checked
at least daily and the state of health of all animals in licensed
premises or places should be observed sufficiently frequently
and in sufficient detail to ensure their well-being in the context
of the procedure. The Code of Practice should specify condi-
tions for the transfer of animals between licence holders, or
between licensed establishments during the course of, or at the
end of, a procedure.

Legislation should permit the performance of procedures in
open spaces and natural environments.

4. LICENSING OF PERSONS AND PROCEDURES

Licences for individuals to carry out procedures should be
issued by the Secretary of State on application by the prospec-
tive licensee. The application should be counter-signed by two
sponsors. The ﬁrst sponsor should be the holder of a senior
appointment in the biological sciences at the establishment of
the applicant, who is familiar with the applicant and the facil-
ities available. He should certify that the applicant is a suit-
able person to hold a licence, and that he is competent in the
handling of the animals to be used in the procedures specified
in the application, and is competent to perform the specified
procedure or procedures and any anaesthetic or analgesic
techniques to be used. The first sponsor should also certify
that the procedure or procedures conform to the provisions of
the legislation, with particular reference to the acceptable pur-
pose for which the procedures are to be performed. The appli-
cant and first sponsor may wish to consult with a non-
statutory local ethical committee before forwarding the
application to the second sponsor.

The second sponsor should be an independent biological
scientist from another establishment whose name is listed in a
register of sponsors approved by the Secretary of State. The
second sponsor should certify that, in his opinion, the pro-
cedure or procedures conform to the legislative provisions,
and that they are justified in the circumstances, after having

considered the possibility of using alternative techniques ‘

which do not involve the use of animals. In any application in-
volving the use of primates, the second sponsor should certify
additionally that the use of primates is essential.

Strict control should be exercised over the procedures and
animal species permitted on licences. When procedures are to
be carried out on unanaesthetised animals, or on anaesthe-
tised animals which are to be allowed to recover, the licence

18

should specify such—species as may be used and should define
the permitted procedures.

The recipient of a first licence should be subject to the direc-
tion and supervision of an experienced licensee, irrespective of
the qualifications and training of the recipient. This first
licence should normally be valid for one year only, and a
report from the Supervisor to the local Inspector should be
submitted and considered before the licence is renewed with-
out the supervision condition. There should be provision for
the issue of licences with longer-term supervision conditions,
provided that there is always an assessment of competence
after the expiry of the first year.

Variations of any licence should be made either at the re-
quest of the holder, or of the Secretary of State.

Licences should be available for inspection at all reasonable
times by an Inspector.

An undergraduate or postgraduate student of any biolog-
ical science should be permitted to carry out procedures on
licensed premises without being the holder of a licence, pro-
vided that it is under the direct supervision of and in the
presence of a licence holder, and that the animal is anaes-
thetised throughout the procedure and is humanely killed at
the end of the procedure without regaining consciousness.

5. CONDUCT OF PROCEDURES

A procedure starts when an animal is first prepared for use
in that procedure, and ends when no further observations are
to be made for the purpose of the procedure.

It is reasonable to allow the re-use of animals under certain
conditions. It must be decided at the end of any procedure
whether the animal shall be kept alive or humanely killed,
provided that it shall not be kept alive if it is likely to remain
in lasting pain or distress. At the end of a procedure animals
which are to be kept alive must continue to be kept subject to
the conditions of the procedure and must be placed under the
supervision of the veterinary surgeon identiﬁed on the licence
of the premises. An animal may be exempted from these eon-
ditions if, in the opinion of the veterinary surgeon, it would
not suffer as a consequence of such exemption. It may be
necessary for the purposes of the procedure to set non-
domesticated animals free or return domesticated animals to
their normal (i.e. non-experimental) environment. This
should be permitted by the licence provided that the Secretary
of State is satisfied that. the. maximum practicable care has
been taken to safeguard the animal’s well-being.

When an animal is not to be kept alive, it should be
humanely killed without avoidable delay.

6. PAIN, ANAESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA

The problem of deﬁning pain, suffering or distress has not
been resolved satisfactorily. However, it is possible to recog-
nise various states of discomfort, stress or pain, both in the in-
tensity and the duration of the suffering. For example, a very
brief painful stimulus such as the insertion of a sharp needle
through the skin is probably inconsequential; on the other
hand, the stress imposed in the restraint and immobilisation
of the animal prior to the insertion of the needle may be
severe. Thus it is the recognition of the response of the animal
to a stimulus that should be the criterion of suffering, rather
than the nature of the" stimulus itself. It is possible also to
recognise differences in the Origin of the‘suffering, whether it
be from wilful neglect or incompetence, whether it be inciden-
tal to or unexpected within the procedure, or whether it be a
necessary component of the procedure.

The following provides a useful guide to the recognition of
the various states of suffering, based on paragraph 181 of the
Littlewood Report. Discomfort may be characterised by such

negative signs as poor condition, torpor and diminished ap-
petite or by positive signs such as avoidance. Stress is a condi-
tion of tension or anxiety which may be predicted or readily
explained by environmental causes whether distinct from or
including physical causes. Pain 15 recognisable, but not neces-
sarily quantifiable, by positive signs such as struggling,
screaming or squealing, convulsions and severe palpitations
or by measurement of chemical changes within the body.

During any procedure, suitable anaesthesia, analgesia or
other measures compatible with the standards of contem-
porary veterinary practice, and designed to alleviate pain, suf-
fering or distress of whatever origin occurring during the pro-
cedure, should be applied at any time, unless they are more
distressing for the animal than the procedure itself or unless
they would conflict with the purposes of the procedure. If a
procedure is likely to cause pain, suffering or distress of more
than momentary duration or trivial intensity, which cannot be
alleviated, prior authorisation by the Secretary of State
should be obtained. Such authorisation should only be given
when the procedure is judged to be of exceptional importance
in meeting essential needs of man or animals.

All licences should contain provisions to ensure that any
animal that is suffering severe pain or severe distress which
cannot be alleviated should be killed even if the object of the
procedure has not been achieved.

The use of curariform drugs should be prohibited, except in
conjunction with anaesthesia of sufficient depth to produce
loss of consciousness.

7. ACQUISITION OF ANIMALS

Animals for use in experiments should be bred for the pur-
pose, although exceptions should be permitted for scientific
reasons and in the case of farm animals. The use for experi-
mental purposes of cats or dogs taken from the streets should
never be permitted. Exceptions to the purpose breeding rule
for cats and dogs should be stringently controlled: financial
grounds alone should not be a sufficient reason for an excep-
tion to be made.

Animals of the species listed below which are intended for
use in procedures should be obtained only from registered
breeding establishments, except: -

(a) That exemptions from this requirement may be given
for specific reasons or procedures; and

(b) that free-living varieties of the listed species may be
used in a procedure where the main object of the procedure is
the study of the free-living variety.

Animals of species other than those listed below should be
acquired from registered establishments wherever possible. In
reaching a decision to use wild animals for experimental pur-
poses the welfare of the animals, the survival of the species
and the quality of the experimental material should be taken
into account: financial grounds alone should not be a suffi-
cient reason for an exception to be made. The general source
of animals intended for use in procedures which will not be
acquired from registered establishments should be stated
when application is made for the licence to carry out the pro-
cedure.

Listed Species
Mouse Mus musculus
Rat Rattus norvegicus
Guinea Pig Ca via porcellus
Rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus
Dog Cartisfamiliaris
Cat Felis catus
Hamster Mesocricetus auratus and
Cricetulus griseus

Volume XXVII, Number 1, Fall 1983.

Other species, and particularly primates, should be added
to this list as soon as there is reasonable prospect of a suffi-
cient supply of purpose-bred animals.

8. REGISTRATION OF BREEDING AND SUPPLYING
PREMISES

Control of the breeding, keeping, supply and transport of
animals intended for use in procedures is essential. Establish-
ments which breed or supply animals should be registered by
the Secretary of State, and a legally enforceable Code of Prac-
tice should lay down the required standards for premises
breeding and supplying animals for experimental purposes.
The Code should specify the standards of premises, and the
facilities required before registration is granted. The numbers
and competence of staff should be specified. The certificate of
registration should identify the person or persons ultimately
responsible for the care of the animals in the establishment
and the veterinary surgeon responsible for advice on animal
health and welfare in the establishment.

9. RECORDS AND RECORDING

In order to facilitate the keeping of records of animal move-
ment and usage, canidae, felidae, ungulates and primates in-
tended for use in procedures, should be individually identified
at the earliest practicable time after birth or after being taken
into a licensed or registered establishment. The identification
should be in the most permanent form available for the spe-
cies and nature of the individual. Full records of the identity
and origin of each member of the families listed above should
be kept by all licensed or registered establishments.

Records of the movement of other species should be re-
corded by total number only.

The records should be in such a form as to show, as far as
practicable, the origin, lifetime movement, usage in pro-
cedures and disposal of all animals, either by group or indi-
vidually, as described above.

All persons licensed to carry out proceﬁ:
records of movements of animals inte'm-
own procedures and of the usage 0‘1
dures. Records from all licensed or ‘
be submitted annually to the Secretar;

IO. ANNUAL REPORT

The Secretary of State should present to Parliament, an-
nually, a report which should include at least:

(a) The total number of procedures carried out during the
previous year.

(b) The purposes for which the procedures were carried
out.

(c) The number and species of animals used.

(d) The number of exemptions from the basic pain condi-
tion granted during the year.

(e) A statement of any infringements of the legislation, and
the consequences.

(f) The subjects on which the Advisory Committee had ad-
vised during the year.

11. INSPECTORS ,_ i j . ‘ 7 ,

Inspectors should continue to be recruited from mature per-
sons holding registered medical or veterinary qualifications.

Their statutory duties should include: .

(a) The scrutiny of applications for licences in regard to the
nature and purpose of the procedures to be carried out, and
the assessment of the suitability of the applicants to perform
such procedures.

 




 

    

 
 

(b) The unannounced periodic inspection of licensed and
registered establishments and the inspection of those for
which application has been made.,Refusal of entry to an
authorised, inspector at any reasonable time should be an of-
fence. ' . , -

(c) Advising the Secretary of State as to the exercise of their
duties. '

Inspectors should have absolute discretion to order the kill-
ing of any animals considered to be suffering unduly at a
licensed or registered establishment.

12. ADVISORY COMMITTEE

An Advisory Committee should be established and should
consist of a Chairman and twelve members, all appointed by
the Secretary of State in a personal and not in a representative
capacity.

The Committee should:

(a) Keep under continuous review (i) the extent to which
animals are used in procedures which may cause pain, suffer-
ing or ill-health and (ii) other matters relating to the welfare of
animals used or for use in procedures.

(b) Provide the Secretary of State with such other relevant
advice and guidance as they think he requires, particularly
with reference to the use of alternative techniques.

(c) Consider particular procedures which come to their
notice or are referred to them by the Secretary of State and ad-
vise whether or not, and subject to what conditions, such pro-
cedures are justified. ,

(d) Advise the Secretary of State on any relevant matters
which he may refer to the Committee for their opinion.

The Committee should be composed of persons qualified by
their knowledge and experience to render competent advice to
the Secretary of State on any or all aspects of the matters
referred to in (a) to (d) above. The members should include
veterinary surgeons, biological scientists, representatives of
the medical profession and lay persons.

13. APPEALS ~

There should be an adequate statutory procedure for ap-'
peals against a decision made by the Secretary of State, con-
cerning licences for procedures, licences for premises and
places, or registrations for establishments.

14. PUBLIC EXHIBITION

Exhibition to the general public of visual recordings of pro-
cedures on living animals should be permitted where the
recordings of procedures were originally made for an accept-
able purpose as defined in Section 2.

Exhibition to the general public of procedures, or record-
ings of procedures, on living aimals made speciﬁcally for ex-
hibition, should not be permitted except:

(a) Where the prior approval of the Secretary of State has
been obtained; or

(b) where the audience consists entirely of students or
workers in the biological sciences.

15. RESTRICTION ON RIGHT TO PROSECUTION

To protect licensees or holders of certificates of registration
from malicious or vexatious prosecution, a prosecution
against a person licensed or registered under the legislation for
an offence under the legislation should not be begun except on
the instructions or with the consent of the Director of Public
Prosecutions. ‘ ‘

Proceedings should be commenced within two years of the
commission of the offence or within six months of the discov-
ery of the offence.

animals for experiments, regardless of the degree and
duration of pain and suffering inflicted. An attempt was
made to pass similar legislation in Illinois, but here ehe

~attampt failed, and the individual communities were left in

D

control of local policies with respect t disposition of

stray dogs :nd cat .

ll

.1

Procurement laws passed in New York, South Dakota,
Oklahoma, Connecticut, Ohio, and lowa did not attempt to
enact such far-reaching legislation.

Robert Sellar, the President of the American Humane
Association, the national federation of humane societies, saw
the grave danger to the movement, whose organizational
structure in the late 1940's was especially susceptible to
demoralization through animal seizure legislation. Virtually
all the well~established humane societies centered their work
around shelters for lost or unwanted dogs and cats. If
forced to surrender animals for painful experiments, the
entire structure would lose its moral basis as a sanctuary
for animals where they would be safe from inflicted
suffering. These were dark days for organized animal
protection.

Mr. Sellar sought to reason with the National Society

for Medical Research in hopes of finding a solution to the

demand for research dogs without undermining the morals of

the humane movement. A small AHA group met with an NSMR

group with the understanding that the preliminary talk would

  




  

 

not be publicized. But Mr. Ralph Rohweder, the Executive
Secretary of the NSHR, immediately sent out an announcement
calculated to inflame anti-vivisection societies and

the emerican Humane

U}

raged in state after state to pass legislation compelling

U

humane societie- to surrender dogs and cats to the
laboratories on demand and without controls on pain
infliction.
With the death of Robert Sellar came the end of real
attempts to face the problem and solve it. The influence of
a coterie of professional humanitarians--the paid employees
of large societies who had a vested interest in the
continuance of their jobs--was not conducive to firm resolve.
They felt that they must avoid offending either anti-
vivisectionists, from whom their organizations might receive
large gifts and bequests, or scientific and medical groups,
whose powerful influence they feared. Thus it was that the
American Humane Association, normally eager for
contributions, declined an offered gift of $10,060 to study
and prepare a concerted plan for obtaining humane treatment
of research animals and a solution to the problem of supply

to laboratories.

Before his death Mr. Sellar had appointed a new director

the National Humane Review, Fred Myers, a newspaper man

 
 




  
 

 

who was a reformer and an effective writer. He attacked the
NSMR for its policies of indiscriminate procurement and use
of animals. So telling were his arguments that he was

forbidden by AHA management, which was heavily weighted

U!

l

.gain-t any energetic action, to use the words ”National
Society for Medical Research” in any article published in the

National Humane Review. Unwilling te submit to such an

 

arbitrary stifling of truthful reporting, Mr. Myers resigned,
together with two of the other three major staff members:
Helen Jones, Director of Education, and Larry Andrews,
Director of Field Services. All were appointees of Robert ﬂ
i4riu

Sellar, who had been replaced after his death by Mel Morse.

The National Humane Society was founded by the dissident
trio. The American Humane Association promptly sued them
to force them to change the society's name, which, it
claimed, was too similar to National Humane Review. The
result was the renaming of the new organization as the Humane
Society of the United States.

Nor was this the only legal action taken in the reform
effort. The first attempt to change the passive attitude of
the AHA came at the election of directors at the 1954 annual

meeting. The three reform candidates, Professor,Roland Smith

f the Department of English, University of Illinois, Miss

 

”Q?! Mr. Morse, who fought the reform efforts of the founders
”of the Humane Society of the United States as chief executive
of the American Humane Association, became president of the
Humane Society of the United States from 1967-1970.

 

  




 

 

J. M. Perry, an attorney from South Carolina, and Mr. Raymond
Naramore. a high school teacher who became the director of

the Rochester and Monroe County Humane Society, were promptly

ﬂ]

lected by a delighted membership that had never betore

l

l
d-

rci ed it prerogu ives. The controlling group of AHA

tl‘
it
u

m

directors was dismayed. The following year they fought back.1
éirst naming a meeting point in the Northwest where the
expense of travel would discourage the bulk of the
membership, concentrated in the East, from attending. Forced
by injunction to name a more central location for the
meeting, they resorted to bringing in large numbers of
pe*sons never before associated with animal welfare work who
voted as a bloc on signal. The ”in“ group won and, not long
aTter, Miss Perry died. and Professor Smith resigned.

Mr. Naramore, limited to work on humane education for
schools, died a iew years later.

Due to the {ailure of these and other attempts to bring
purpose and life into the AHA establishment at that time,
several new organizations were formed. The Animal welfare
Institute was founded in 1951, its aim the advancement of the
wel¥are of all animals, with special emphasis on the research
' animals whiehwhad so long been neglected by humage
organizations. Its charter was drawn by Herbert Brownell,
the distinguished New York lawyer who served as Attorney
General under President Eisenhower.

The Humane Society of the United States was founded in

  




       
   
   
    
     
    
    
  
     
     
   
  
    
 
   
   
   
  
  
  
   

1954; and in 1959 one of its iounders, Helen Jones, leFt the
parent body to found the National Catholic Society for Animal

Nellare, later renamed the International Society ior Animal

Rights.
In 1952, atter years of controversy, the Hatcthetcalf
Act was pass

.wed. The Act amended an existing New York
laboratory animal care statute into a procurement law,
requiring all dog pounds and all humane societies receiving

public {unds to surrender animals to scientific institutions.

The New York .

L

tate Humane'Associatian actively fought
enactment oi the law; but its biggest, oldest member
organization, the American Society {or the Prevention oi
Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), whose board was dominated at that
time by r search interests, reiused to take a position. Its
president was Samuel Milbank of the Milbank Founda ion.
_ X“
y//:7 The New York State Society for Medical Research, proponents
4’
of the law, dismissed all the other organizations as
anti-vivisection groups, thus ensuring passage of the law.
Both the Erie County Humane Society and the Humane
Society of Rochester and Monroe County immediately gave up
their pound contracts so that it would not be necessary for

them to release animals from their shelters to laboratories.

Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Islandq‘Vermont, and
West Virginia. Of these, Massachusetts is the only state
which specifically prohibits the sale of pound animals
brought in from other states as well: "No person,
institution, animal dealer, or their authorized agent shall
transport . . . any animal obtained from any municipal or
public pound, public agency, or dog officer . . . into the
commonwealth for purposes of research, experimentation,
testing, instruction or demonstration" (Ch. 140, Sec. 174D,
1983).

Release of impounded animals for research purposes is
required in the District of Columbia, Iowa, Minnesota,
Oklahoma (by pounds only; shelters may release animals for
research), South Dakota, and Utah.

Release of impounded animals for research use is allowed
in Arizona, California, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio,
Tennessee, and Wisconsin.

Recent efforts to repeal Minnesota's law requiring
release of animals from pounds to research facilities have
been unsuccessful. However, a law was enacted in 1987 which

provides for inspections of animal dealers by the Minnesota

Board of Animal Health as well as the U. S. Department of

Agriculture, requires dealers to post signs informing the
public that they sell animals to laboratories, and opens
dealers' premises to the public to enable pet owners to
search for lost or stolen pets. A fine of $1,000 will be
imposed on any individual selling a dog or cat to a research
facility without the permission of the owner.

The State of Washington enacted a law in 1989 to prevent
pet theft. Research animal dealers who sell stolen dogs or
cats to scientific institutions or who pose as adopters of
animals responding to "free to good home" classified ads may
now be punished by a fine of $10,000 and 5 years in jail.
Research facilities are required to maintain a file on each
dog and cat, including certification of the animal's origin,
a photograph, and a physical description of the animal,

available for public inspection.

 




emphasized the fact that, poles apart though they were, these
two groups actually corresponded with a View to helping each
other defeat regulatory legislation.

Opponents thought they had buried regulatory
legislation, and in that Committee they had. But they
reckoned without the disappearance oi a Dalmatian dog named
Pepper and the respons oi the House Agriculture Committee.

The Humane Soci ty of the United States, under the

direction of Fred Myers, insisted that the British Act was

’ not sufficiently strong; and theiSociety asked Representative

Houlder towintroduce a deeadedly restrictive bill. The
American Humane Association remained silent and, when
pres ed, said it was studying the matter. When Congressman
Kenneth Roberts held two days of hearings on the Bri¥¥iths
and Moulder bills, the AHA sent no one to testify.7

Medical research groups and anti-vivisection groups
opposed the bills; the National Catholic Society for Animal
Welfare said it would support the Moulder bill if it were
amended to eliminate all pain intliction. Signiiicant
statements were made by scientists and medical men who

supported the Briniths bill (identical to the Clark-

Neuberger bill in the Senate) based on the principles oi the

hearings were called by Congressman Poage on the Resnickgﬁ
bill, September 2, 1965. At subsequent hearing52theerrf‘~
representatives testified against inclusion of laboratories

under the Act and could testify from firsthand experience as
to its workability and effect"eness in preventing animal
suffering without hampering researc

The American Medical A' ' ' felt differently,
n

however, and editorialized about what it termed ”humaniccs.

An objective and authoritative voice was heard from England

when the Report of the Departmental Committee on Experiments
on Animals was presented to Parliament by the Secretary of
tate for the Home Department, April IBBS.

The Committee, under the chairmanship of Sir Sydney
Littlewood, held hearings over a two-year period to review
the working of the British Act, giving every individual and
group who desired to be heard an opportunity. The resulting
“Littlewood Report,” a remarkable testimony to fairness and
good judgment, surveying every aspect of animal
experimentation, of the treatment of the animals, and of
procurement, reported the views of scientists, of the public,
and of groups as diverse as the Universities Federation for

8
Animal Welfare, whose scientific approach is well known, and

anti—vivisection organizations, wbemmould~abolish all

experimentation on animals. The most widely quoted paragraph

in the ESE-page Report is the fi*st of the General Findings:

For example, Nobel laureate, Sir Peter Medawar, was
Chairman of UFAW's Scientific Advisory Committee. He
repeatedly sent statements on the value of the British Act
for quotation at Congressional hearings.

 




        
    
   
  
  
  
  
  
    
  
   
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
  
  
  
    
  
 

  

”animal experiment

   

is a complex and highly specialised
subject. It is also a moral and social problem of the first
magnitude and one that does not exclusively concern the
expert.”

The ”Littlewood Report” was referred to repeatedly by
two distinguished medical men who flew to the United States
to testify at hearings held September 30. 1965. before the
House Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee:

Dr. Lawrence Abel, former Vice President of the Royal College
of Surgeons of England and Consulting Surgeon to the
Institute of Cancer Research, Royal Cancer Hospital, and Sir
Graham Wilson, former Director of the Public Health Service.

Speaking of the inspectorate under the British ﬁct. Sir
Graham said:

The Act is administered by the Home Office

and is enforced by specially appointed inspectors

possessing a medical or veterinary qualification.

Their main purpose is regulatory and educational

rather than disciplinary. In their visits to the

laboratories they satisfy themselves about the

suitability of the conditions under which the

animals are kept and of the general well—being

of the animals themselves; they may assure

themselves that the license holder is fully

aware of what he is permitted and not permitted

to do; and they make useful suggestions for
overcoming difficulties of one sort or another.

 

Dr. Abel, speaking of the three principles—glicensing,

inspection, and the pain rule—~said:

 
 

The third British Principle is the Pain Rule.
This sets the limit to the amount of suffering which
may be inflicted. we do not commit the atrocities
which are reported from time to time in some other
countries. We do not allow the extravagant cruelty

committed by some investigators of stress and shock.
We have proved that the desired results can be
obtained by less inhumane methods. We are convinced
that the‘freedom of all and sundry to use animals
indiscriminately would not improve the value of
research.

W
Committee at which Sir Graham and Dr. ﬁbel testiiied were
never published} Scheduled as two—day hearings, they were
abruptly canceled the morning oi the second day

rescheduled.

vNEN BILL BYPQSSES THE HEQLTH COMMITTEES

: On July 3, 19é5, Fay Brisk, a long—term campaigner for

reform of the big Pennsylvania dog dealers, called the Qnimal
welfare Institute ¥or help to try to get Pepper back to her
owners, the Lakavage family. Mr. Lakavage, in the hospital
with a heart attack, saw Pepper's photograph together with
seventeen other dogs and two goats that had been temporarily
unloaded from a Pennsylvania dog dealer's overcrowded truck.
Mrs. Lakavage and the three young Lakavages set off in
pursuit of Pepper, who, allegedly, had been taken to a big
New York State dog dealer, Nersesian. When the exhausted
family arrived, Nersesian refused them entry.

Senator Clark of Pennsylvania, a well-established
{ighter for animal protection and chief sponsor of pending
legislation to require humane treatment of experimental
animals, was out of town, but Sara Ehrmann, his Legislative

Assistant, responded to the ANI call for help by telephoning

 




   
    
 
    
 
   
   
   
  
    
  
  
    
  
    
  
   
  
  
  
   
  
   
   
  
  
 

Iongressman Resnick‘s office in the District where

U

Nersesian's dog farm was located. Even Congressional
intercession ¥ailed, however; and Resnick, angered by
Nersesian's high~handed refusal to admit the family to find
their missing pet, decided he would introduce a bill to
prevent such wrongs.

Meantime, pressure by the State Police brought an
admission trom the Pennsylvania dog dealer that he had taken
his load not to Nersesian, as he first had said, but directly
to Montefiore Hospital in‘New York. Immediately, Fay Brisk
telephoned the hospital, could hear the rattling of the dog
tags at the other end of the phone, then the news: the dog
had died on the operating table the day be¥ore and already
had been incinerated. The dog dealer insisted the dog was
not Pepper—-the evidence was incinerated-~but the call for
female Dalmatians, put out by the hospital to dealers rather
than to breeders, had led to introduction of the Resnick bill
on July ninth. The Resnick bill, written by attorneys of the
United States Department of Agriculture, required that
dealers in dogs and cats and the laboratories that purchased
them be licensed, inspected, and adhere to humane standards
set by the Secretary of Agriculture. Q companiog bill was
introduced in the Senate by Senator warren G. Magnuson,

Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, and Senator Clark,

who came to the Senate floor at the same moment to introduce

    

identical bills. In a brief colloquy they agreed to




 

  

 

co-sponsor, and Senator Daniel Brewster o¥ Maryland
them.

On September tifth. Congressman N. R. Poage of Tex

fa
U1

Chairman o¥ the Livestock Subcommittee oi the House
agriculture Committee. held hearings on the Resnick bill. He
was the ¥irst American legislator to hold hearings on
laboratory animal legislation with a View to enacting it. He
had won passage of the Humane Slaughter Qct in 1958, and was
destined to win again +or laboratory animals. Not easily,
however. The bill was immediately attached as
anti-vivisectionist by the National Society for Medical
Research, which described it as a ”pincers movement” to cut
off the supply of animals {or laboratories. enti-
vivisectionist groups, however, took but little interest in
the matter. The demand for action came from the general
public, outraged by the article in Elie magazine showing Stan
Wayman‘s photographs of the shocking abuse of dogs in the
dealers' hands.

The Elie article was set in motion by Henry Luce after he
looked over a collection of photographs supplied by the
Animal welfare Institute, many of them taken by photographers
accompanying ANI Laboratory Animal Consultant, Dorothy Dyce.
Under the supervision of Elig‘s Nature Editor, Pat Hunt, the

article was completed and published February 4, 19é6. More

mail was received by Life on this article than on any other

in the history of the magazine, and Congress received more

 
 




  

  

 

mail on the pending bills than on civil rights or Vietnam.

In the face of such demand, the opponents began to
modify their opposition. When Congressman Poage introduced
the Committee bill, extending coverage to all vertebrate
animals, and Sehator Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania introduced an
identical bill in the Senate, the opponents concentrated on

exempting scientific institutions from the humane standards

and on cutting back the number of species covered. The Poa'

I‘JJ
ll]

bill came unscathed through the Subcommittee, but the full
House égriculture Committee cut it down to dogs and cats in
dealers“ premises only. Laboratory interests thus won a
temporary victory and, no doubt, believed they could continue
to keep the objective veterinary inspectors of the U. S.
Department of Agriculture out of scientific institutions.
after the House passed the weakened version of the Poage
bill, a Senate Commerce Committee staff draft accomplished a
comparable weakening of the bills introduced by Senators
Magnuson, Clark, Brewster, and Scott. Again, laboratory
interests made a stab at getting themselves exempted, but
they had reckoned without Senator Honroney, who, as soon as
he read the draft, prepared an amendment restoring coverage
of animals inside scientific institutions. Newsgapers
throughout the country supported the Monroney Amendment in

emphatic terms. So hotly debated was the issue that a second

set of hearings was scheduled in the Senate Commerce

Committee on May 25, 1966.

last is headed toward enactment of
- , ire humane treatment o? animals used in
laboratory research and to halt theTts o? pets by
dealers supplying this market. ﬁt the eleventh
hour, however, a snag has been encountered in the
Senate Commerce Committee. Medical researchers,
hostile to government supervision, (but not
government grants, it should be added), are
attempting a switch play. 9 bill introduced by
Senator Hill of ﬁlabama would head off federa
inspection of how laboratories treat animals
awaiting experiments. Instead this authority would
be given to a private group.

       
           
      
        
     
   
    
 

 
  

The medical men, in fact have such a group all
ready and waiting. Set up last year, it is called
the ﬁmerican ﬁssociation for Accreditation of
Laboratory Animal Care. Its members are of the
establishment; and are staff members of medical
schools and research institutions. ﬁnd, as the
association's brochure suggests, the 'inspections'
would be rather friendly a¥¥airs.

 
   
    
        
    
   
   
   
  
    
  
   
 
 

There would be no surprise audits, such as
those routinely carried out now in the banking
industry, {or example. Instead a visit would be
scheduled by 'mutual convenience.‘ It would not
come distressingly often--no more than once every
¥ive years. The inspectors, according to the
brochure, would charge Fees ranging up to $1,000
for their trouble.

If the laboratories are in fact treating their
animals humanely, they should have nothing.§o fear
from a proposal by Senator Magnuson of Nashington
that such inspections be made by the Department of
agriculture a§ter standards have been published. His
bill has nothing to do with the anti-vivisectionists;
the government would not interfere with any laboratory
tests or operations.

 
       
   
   

Certainly the public should not be deluded into




 

 

 

     

thinking the Hill proposal represents any kind of
adequate substitute for impartial inspection of such
institutions. ;

     
 

Senator Magnuson had made plain his determination to

-\

report a bill out of his Committee. the National Society tor
Medical Research and National Institutes of Healthy
therefore, concentrated on trying to get the laboratories

exempted from compliance with humane standards set by the

United States Department of ﬁgriculture and

inspection by its
representatives. Slowing references to the ﬁmerican 4 )

anDClathﬂ +or Hccreoitation of Laboratory animal Care‘ +or

whose existence Dr. Maurice Visscher, President of the NSMR,
took credit, were a stock in trade; and at the final Senate
Commerce Committee hearings, representatives of the NIH and
NSMR strongly supported the NIH bill and opposed the Monroney
amendment. Testimony was limited to medical witnesses at
this hearing; and two courageous physicians, who had been
associated for years with efforts to obtain humane treatment
of laboratory animals, came to Washington to testify for the
Monroney Amendment: Dr. Nicholas Gimbel, Chief of Surgery at
Metropolitan Hospital and Associate Professor of Surgery at
Wayne University Medical School, and Dr. Bennett Derby, Head
of Neurology at Veterans administration Hospital‘in Manhattan
and Assistant Professor of Neurology at New York University
Medical School. Dr. Simbel and Dr. Derby urged the Senate
Committee to provide for humane care and housing of animals

in research institutions. They emphasized that the

  




  

 

Department o? Agriculture is the ideal agency to administer
such requirements. Dr. Bimbel, who had devoted considerable

time to getting‘better treatment for experimental dogs in

[IL

iTTerent institutions. brought the question down to earth by
stating that if‘he were a dog, he would preter to have the
Department of agriculture adminisier the law. He said the
”welfare of animals should be the responsibility o? a body
which is primarily interested in them . . . the Department o+
agriculture.” and he added: ”I? the scientists and
organizations represented in AAQLAC had done their job
properly, we would not be holding hearings here today. The

time has come to bring in independent auditors.” The NIH

bill did not come to hearings.

 

The Senate Commerce Committee bill, under the leadership
of Senator Magnuson and Senator Monroney, received unanimous
endorsement by the Senate. Eighty-{ive Senators came to the
¥loor to vote for it, and each of the fifteen who were absent
and unable to vote stated in The Congressional Record that
they would have voted for it had they been present. The
bill's sanctions were strengthened at the insistence of
the House Conferees. They agreed to accept the Senate
amendments restoring humane care and housing of-animals
inside laboratories and increasing the number of species 0?
animals covered, on condition that the stronger House

enforcement clauses be adopted.

As numbers of animals used in experiments and tests grew
by the million, a countervailing philosophy was increasingly
advocated by animal protective organizations. The first
serious contribution to the field was The Principles _i
Humane Experimental Technique, by N. M. 8. Russell and
R. L. Burch, produced under the aegis of the Universities
Federation for Animal Welfare in 1959, with some modest
assistance from AWI. This pioneering book established the
Three R's—-Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement-~which are

now generally recognized as fundamental elements necessary to

prevent large-scale unnecessary suffering by laboratory

seven bills on alternative' andfor regulation

oi animal experimen s were pending in . Subcommittee on
Science, Research and Technology of the House Committee on
Ucience and Technology. Dn October 1a and 14, 1981,
Subcommittee Chairman Doug Nalgren of Pennsylvania held
hearings, which drew unexpectedly wide media attention
because Maryland police had removed 17 monkeys just days
earlier from a Silver Spring laboratory. There they had
been experimented on by Dr. Edward Taub under grants from the
National Institutes of Health. Dr. Taub and an associate
were charged with 17 counts of cruelty for failing to supply
veterinary care. Al x Pacheco, who had worked at the
Institute for Behavioral Research as a volunteer and had
alerted police to conditions there, showed horrifying
pictures of the monkeys and their quarters at the hearings.

Drafting 0% a composite bill containing some'features

organizations which had testified pro- or con~ the different

bills. On August 4, 1982, Congressman Nalgren proposed the

nearly every witness had scientific guali¥ications. Humane

groups were represented by Bennett Derby, M.D.,

      

Ph.D., who

 




 

    

had appeared at the crucial hearings which led to unanimous
Senate passage of the original Act.

Senator Dole's masterful handling of the hearings payed
the way for action. but it was not to come in the 98th
Congress. Uppohents tried a new tack, questioning the need
for the Dole bill. The Society {or Animal Protective

Le-i

lation prepared two thick binders of documentation

f

outlining the urgent need for all the bill‘s provisions for
minimizing pain and distress and strengthening the authority
of ﬁgriculture‘s veterinary inspectors.

Congressman George E. Brown, Jr. of California, well
known for his successful sponsorship of the 1978 humane
slaughter amendments (see chapter Ill), introduced a bill
based on the Dole bill, H. R. 5725. On September 19, 1984,
he chaired hearings in his Subcommittee on Departmental
Operations, Research and Foreign Agriculture which drew a
standing~room-only crowd with long lines waiting outside the
hearing room. Interest in the legislation had been
heightened by revelations of severe mistreatment of
experimental baboons at the University of Pennsylvania
Medical School. Sixty hours o4 self—incriminating videotapes
taken by a research team as a record of their exgeriments
showed virtually every rule of aseptic surgery being
violated. Injured baboons were painfully dangled and

ridiculed by groups of laughing students.

  

The tapes were stolen by a group known as the




~ gJL/Freedom of Information éct and presented by the $ociety for

Animal Liberation Front and given to People for the Ethical

Treatment of Animals. They made a au-minute version to show
the public. It was run repeatedly in a nearby church on the
day of the hearings.

Henry Mitchell‘s column in The Washington Post September

21, 1e34 note : ”Savagery is very much part of the nature of

all humans I have ever known. and that is one reason
civilized nations have gone to such efforts to restrain it or

do not wish to concern themselves with what amounts to
flamboyant sadism should at least have the grace not to
obstruct the long hard thankless labors of those who have not
shied from the evidence and who have at last come up with
reasonable and moderate legislation.” Describing his
feelings in watching five minutes of the tapes in St. Mark‘s
Church, he concluded: ”I left thinking it probably an
esthetic error to vomit in a church."

Documentation of neglect and.abuse in laboratories
throughout the entire country was derived from official

reports of USDA veterinary inspectors obtained under the

Animal Protective Legislation in the form of a é'xlO’ chart.

 

A heartening message of support from Dr. Jean Mayer,

K

deantime, in the Health and Environment Subcommittee,

O

Conrressman Walgren had succecded in getting some provisions

"of his bill included in the NIH Reauthorization Bill which

was passed by the Congress but vetoed by President Reagan.

In the 99th Congress, the NIH—Reauthorization.Bill, after
some modification, was passed again and Congress overrode the
President's second veto. ‘The animal weliare provisions are
less stringent than the Dole-Brown legislation, and they
apply only to NIH grantees; nevertheless, the two were
destined to fit together well and reinforce one another in a
practical manner.

Senator Dole, elected Majority Leader of the Senate,
reintroduced his bill at the same time as Congressman Brown.
This time the bills were identical, the heroic work of
stafTers Sara Rasmussen for Brown and Mark Scanlan for Dole.
They produced a final draft still containing every major
animal protective provision, phrased in the manner least
objectionable to the legion of opponents and unremitting
critics. .,'

The New York Times editorialized on July 31, 1985 in
support of the Dole-Brown proposals, and in the following

months, newspapers in every part of the country followed

suit.

   
     
   
     
   
    
   
   
  
  
  
   
   
  
     
  
  
  
   
    
  
     




    

 

The debate on the 1985 Farm Bill was continuing when the
Majority Leader brought his bill, Improved Standards for
Laboratory Animals, to the Senate floor, October 25th.-

Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, Chairman of the Committee

bill then went into an intense discussion by the st

enators Dole, Hatch, and Melcher and representatives of the

AWE???

National Association for Biomedical Researcé, the eed

U}

Manufacturers 'ssociation, and the Society for Animal
Protective Legislation. A bill calling for is different
changes in Senator Dole’s bill had been prepared for Senator
Hatch by an NAER attorney. Every point had to be fought
through. Senator Dole appeared from time to time to ask what
progress was being made. At one point, Senator Helcher took
part in the arguments, explaining the reason for his
language, ”a physical environment adequate to promote the
psychological well~being of primates.” He had seen
laboratory chimpanzee cages which, even though unoccupied at
the time, he characterized as “extremely efficient, extremely
expensive, and extremely cruel."

A second series of amendments, this time consisting of
no less than 32 changes, even including a $500 reduction in
the fine, was proposed. A night meeting in the Dole office
was called to resolve the differences. It appeared that
although academia was somewhat grudgingly resigned to the

legislation, the pharmaceutical industry was not willing to

 




 

stop fighting. Indeed, it fought to the end.
Disagreement about the content continued, and Senator Melcher
o++ered a substitute bill on October 29th. This passed the
Senate unanimously.

The House Had already passed the Farm Eill without the

J

Dole~Brown amendments. Fortunately, Majority Whip Tom Foley
of Washington proved himseli a poweriul friend o? animals
during the House—Senate Conference. Congressman Foley, as
noted earlier, was the author of the 1976 amendments to the
animal Welfare Act. House agriculture Committee Chairman
Hika de la Garza of Texas gave his blessing to the
legislation in Conference. Lobbying to kill the Improved

Standards for Laboratory Animals continued to the very 1a t

U]

moment.

The Farm Bill, an enormously lengthy piece 0%
legislation, was in Conference for days. The Conferees met
in a small room in the Russell Senate D++ice Building, and
dozens of lobbyists from each of the special interests that
stood to gain or lose from some part of the complex bill
lined the hallway outside the room, waiting for news on
// decisions of the Conferees as sta¥+ers came in and out. At
L/igigiﬂp.m. on December 12tp§¢it appeared that action on the
laboratory animal section was imminent. weakening amendments

were being urged by the National Association for Biomedical

Research, and Senator Dole had not yet returned from out of

 
   

town.

APPROPRIQTIDNS FDR ENFORCEMENT
The struggle for protection of laboratory animals has
had to be fought on many fronts. When passed in 1966, an

appropriation of $300,000 was barely achieved. Slowly,
annual appropriations were worked up to $4,865,000 and

remained at the same level despite attempts by the Office of

Management and Budget to reduce them. In both 1985 and 1986.

the Administration recommended that no money whatever be

In 1985 the Congress simply restored the funds, but in
1986, following passage of the DolefBrown amendments,

Congress vo ed an increase to $S.o?8,000, specifying that

$750,000 be used for the information service designated by
.h- w legislation at the National Agricultural Library in
ooperation with the National Library of Hedicine. The
Vanate Appropriations Committee report stated:

For enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act
the Committee concurs with the House in providing
$5.8?B.000 over the budget request. This is also
$1,?02.000 more than the lQBo adjusted level.
Included in this appropriation is $?50,000 for
creation of an information service at the National
Agricultural Library which will include information
on available alternatives to the use of live animals
in researc . The remainder of the increase is for
the general expansion of the program.

On the House floor, Chairman Bob Traxler of Michigan
said: ”we restore funding for the Animal Welfare Act
once again, rejecting the notion that enforcement of the act
should be turned over to other authorities. That proposal is
simply not sensible in today's interstate economy.”

In 1987, the Office of Management and Budget again
recommended zero funding for the Animal Welfare Act; however,

for the first time, the Department of Agriculture protested,

and the budget figure emerged as $4.94? million, a figure

‘t
from which the $750,000 appropriation for the information

service at the National Agricultural Library had been
subtracted and which could not cover the requirement for

continued inspection of research facilities until all

ANIMAL EXPERIMENTATION LEGISLATION IN EUROPE

Further to your telephone call last week I have pleasure in
enclosing the documents promised.

On a general note, I am enclosing a summary which I prepared
earlier in the year outlining some of the major pieces of
legislation on animal welfare in the Member States of the
Council of Europe. I have up—dated this slightly to include

some additional information on animal experimentation laws.

I am also enclosing an extract from the minutes of the Plenary
Session of Eurogroup last October in which Dr Judith Hampson
outlines the developments in Member States in terms of complying
with the EEC Directive on animal experimentation which is due to
enter in force in November this year.

As regards specific legislation I enclose:

(in French) the Belgian framework law on the protection and
welfare of animals, 1986 [we intend to get this translated

later in the year];

(in French) a press article concerning the new French Decree
on animal experimentation, 1987;

English translation of the Danish Act of 1977 (currently
under review);

Rough translation of the new German Animal Protection Act of
1986 [I apologise for the poor quality of this - these
translations are carried out by our panel of volunteers];

Brief notes on the Luxembourg Law on the Protection and
Welfare of Animals, 1983;

Brief notes on the Netherlands Experiments on Animals Act,

ANIMAL WELFARE LAWS IN EUROPE
A Summary of some of the Principal National Laws

 

BELGIUM
Loi relative a la protection et au bien-étre des animauxpil4 August 1986

The "law on the protection and welfare of animals", which entered into force on
lst August 1987, lays down general provisions for the protection of domestic
farm animals, companion animals, wild animals and experimental animals.

Chapter II requires any person keeping an animal to take the necessary measures
to provide it with the necessary food, care and accommodation in keeping with
its nature, its physiological and ethological needs, its state of health and
its degree of development, adaptation or domestication. Article 2 states that
no. person keeping or caring for an animal may restrict its freedom of movement
to the extent of exposing it to avoidable pain, suffering or injury. An animal
which is frequently or constantly tethered or shut in must have sufficient
space and mobility in accordance with the physiological and ethological needs
of its species. Article 4 provides for the King to issue additional decrees
for different species and categories of animal, but no such decrees have yet
been promulgated.

Chapter III covers trade in animals; Chapter IV provides for the King to fix
detailed conditions for the transport of animals according to their species and
the mode of transport. No detailed provisions have yet been forthcoming.

Chapter V covers the importation and transit of animals; Chapter VI establishes
general provisions on the slaughter of animals and requires the stunning of
animals before slaughter (this does not apply to religious slaughter). Article
2 provides for the King to determine methods of stunning and slaughter
appropriate to circumstance and species and to require religious slaughter to
be carried out only in authorised slaughterhouses and by appointed
slaughtermen. No such detailed provisions have yet been introduced.

Chapter VII governs surgical operations; Chapter VIII lays down general
provisions relating to experiments on animals. Detailed provisions have yet to
be introduced by means of Royal Decree to comply with the EEC Directive on the
protection of animals used for experimental purposes, which Member States are
required to implement by 24th November 1989.

Chapter IX prescribes the institution of a Council on the welfare of animals,
consisting of representatives of national or regional animal welfare
associations, scientific and medical research and those involved in animal

husbandry.
Penal provisions are laid down for violations of this law.

Detailed regulations concerning the transport of animals and the provision of
an international transport certificate are contained in the Arrété Royal of 22
July 1983. This conforms with EEC Directive 81/389 on the protection of
animals during international transport.

Animal Welfare Laws in Europe — A Summary

FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY

Tierschutzgesetz 1987

 

A new Animal Protection Law was adopted in 1986 to amend the West German Animal
Protection Act of 1972. This law, which came into effect on lst January 1987,
contains a number of general provisions as well as empowering the Minister of
Agriculture to issue detailed regulations in a number of areas, including the
housing and care of individual species, the transport of animals and slaughter,
based on the conditions laid down in the European Convention on the protection
of animals for slaughter. Ritual slaughter is permitted only for animals
destined for domestic consumption.

The law introduces detailed regulations governing the use of animals in
experimental research and stipulates that experiments involving animals may
only be carried out if they are essential for health reasons, for the
identification of risks to the environment or for the purposes of "fundamental
research", and cannot be undertaken by alternative methods. The use of animals
for testing certain products, such as decorative cosmetics, detergents and
tobacco, is prohibited.

The only detailed regulations so far to have been approved are the regulations
on battery hens, designed to conform with the EEC Directive laying down minimum
standards for the protection of laying hens kept in battery cages. The Poultry
Keeping Order, adopted on 27th November 1987, in several respects exceeds the
requirements of the EEC Directive, one of which the provision of an increased
space allowance for large birds. Regulations on the welfare of pigs have been

drafted.

A detailed commentary on the new law and how it compares to the 1972 Act has
been produced by [the German animal welfare society, Deutscher Tierschutzbund.
Published in German and entitled "Das Tierschutzgesetz aus unserer Sicht — Band
2", this explanatory booklet can be obtained from the Deutscher Tierschutzbund,
Baumschulallee 15, 5300 Bonn 1, West Germany.

The transport of animals is governed by the Verordnung (Order) of 29 March 1983
on the protection of animals during international transport, which implements
EEC Directives 77/489 and 81/389.

GREECE

Law 1197 concerning the Protection of Animals (1981)

Article 4 of this Law requires the licensing of experiments that could cause
pain, harm or disturbance of animals' physical condition. Anaesthesia is
required for painful surgical operations on vertebrates.

Greece, like all other EC Member States, is required to introduce the necessary
measures to comply with the Directive on animal experimentation by 24th
November 1989.

DENMARK
Protection of Animals Act 1950

The main piece of animal protection legislation in Denmark is the 1950
Protection of nimals Act. The Government is currently holding consultations
with a view to a detailed review of this legislation.

The Act lays down general conditions requiring the proper treatment of animals,
including the provision of food, water and adequate care and accommodation, and
lists a number of prohibited practices, including force—feeding for the purpose
of fattening. The law lays down legal penalties for cruelty to animals and
empowers the Minister of Justice to issue special regulations on transport and

slaughter.
Law No. 220 of 18 May 1977 on Animal Experiments

This law was adopted by the Folketing (Danish Parliament) at the 3rd reading on
13th May 1977. It covers the protection of vertebrate animals and requires
individuals to be licensed by the Experimental Animals Board. New provisions
on animal experimentation, to comply with the EEC Directive, are being
considered in the review of the Protection of Animals Act. These are expected
to include strict provisions on the supply of animals and to require the
setting up of local ethical committees.

FRANCE

Decree No 80—791 of 1 October 1980 regarding the application of Article 276 of
the Rural Code

 

(amended by Decree Nos 81—606 of 18 May 1981, 83—57 of 27 January 1983 and
86—635 of 14 March 1986)

This Decree is based on a number of pieces of legislation including the
European Convention for the protection of animals during international
transport, the European Convention for the protection of animals kept for
farming purposes, the EEC Directive 74/577 on the stunning of animals before
slaughter, the EEC Directive 77/489 on the protection of animals during
international transport and the French Rural and Penal Codes.

Chapter I lays down a number of general provisions for the keeping of animals,
forbidding any person in charge of an animal to deprive it of food and water,
veterinary care and apprOpriate accommodation or to tie it up or restrain it in
any way likely to cause it injury or suffering.

Chapter 11 covers the transport of animals and prohibits the transport of any
animal unfit to travel unless this is necessary for health reasons or emergency
slaughter. Vehicles and containers must be appropriately constructed for the
species to be transported and, when the length of the journey justifies it,
arrangements must be made for the provision of food and water. It furthermore
requires inspection by officials or representatives of the veterinary service
of any consignment of farm animals or captive wild animals destined for another
country or in transit from another country.

 




Page 4.
Animal Welfare Laws in Europe - A Summary

Chapter III lays down detailed provisions concerning slaughter. All animals

must be restrained before slaughter and, in the case of ritual slaughter,

before sticking (bleeding out). No animal, other than poultry, rabbits and

small game, may be hung up before stunning or, in the case of ritual slaughter,

before bleeding out. Ritual slaughter may only be carried out in an abattoir

and must be performed by a suitably qualified person whose name must be
communicated to the Minister of Agriculture.

The final Chapter prohibits live pigeon shooting and the use of goads and lays
down penalties for infringements of the Decree.

Additional measures regarding the rearing and keeping of animals are laid down
in an administrative order (Arrété) of 25 October 1982. Based on the European
Convention for the protection of animals kept for farming purposes, the order
sets out detailed provisions for the keeping of farm animals, companion
animals, animals kept in open enclosures and parks and draught animals.
Detailed conditions are laid down in respect of animals in fairs and markets,
competitions, shows and places of sale.

The provisions of the European Convention and the EEC Directives on the
protection of animals during international transport are implemented by an
administrative order (Arrété) of 1 December 1982. Detailed conditions are laid
down for the transport of different species of animal by rail, road, sea and
air. The administrative order of 8 December 1982 requires all consignments of
imported animals to be accompanied by an appropriate animal transport
certificate.

An administrative order of 24 February 1983 on the protection of laying hens
stipulates the requirement for a minimum available cage floor space of 400 cm2
per hen (The EEC Directive, subsequently adopted on 25 March 1986, lays down a
minimum cage space of 450 cm2).

Decree No. 87—848 of 19 October 1987 introduces new provisions to comply with
the European directive of 24 November 1986 on animal experimentation.

 

A compendium of French animal protection law, entitled "Protection de la Nature
— Protection de l'Animal", is produced by the Direction des Journaux Officiels,
20 reu Desaix, 75727 Paris Cedex 15, France.

ITALY

Italian Vivisection Act No. 924 of 12 June 1931 amended by the Act No. 6L5 of
1 May 1941 -

This law includes certain basic provisions on the protection of animals used
for experimental purposes, however Italy is now bound to introduce new
legislation to comply with the EEC Directive on animal experimentation.

The transport of animals in Italy is governed by the Decree of the President of
the Republic No 624 of 5 June 1982. This implements EEC Directive 77/489 on
the protection of animals during international transport. This was followed by
the Decree of 20 July 1983 regarding measures necessary to implement the Decree
No 624 and requiring international consignments of animals to be accompanied by
a transport certificate. The Decree contains special provisions for the
transport of different species of animals by road, rail, sea and air.

IRELAND
i \
Protection of Animals Act 1911

 

The protection of animals in Ireland is governed by the United Kingdom
Protection of Animals Act 1911 and the Irish Protection of Animals (Amendment)
Act 1965. A number of detailed Acts and Orders cover the transport of animals,
slaughter, livestock markets, the control of dogs and the protection of
wildlife.

NETHERLANDS

 

Draft Animal Health and Welfare Act

 

Animal protection is currently covered by a law in force since 1961. In 1985
the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries presented a draft bill to the Dutch
Parliament to expand the existing Health Act for Animals into a new "Animal
Health and Welfare Act" to replace a number of existing pieces of legislation,
including the Livestock Act, the Bird Diseases Act and the Animal Transport
Act. The new law will cover the welfare and protection of animals as well as
veterinary rules relating to the health of livestock.

The Dutch Animal Welfare Society advocates a separate new framework act for the
welfare of animals and has drawn up its own detailed proposals covering the
welfare of companion animals, farm animals, laboratory animals, wild animals
and pest species.

Law of 25 June 1984 on minimum requirements for the keeping of laying hens

The so—called "Tazelaar—Van Noord Act" requires the preparation by lst January
1990 of an administrative order containing regulations for the keeping of
laying hens after lst July 1994. The ultimate aim of this Act is a total ban
on the battery system of egg production and research is therefore being
undertaken into alternative systems.

A report on the current position and future prospects has been produced by the
Study Commission on Intensive Livestock Farming established by the Dutch SPA.
The Report, entitled "Alternatives for the battery cage system for laying
hens", can be obtained from the Dutch Society for the Protection of Animals,
Post Box 85980, 2508 CR The Hague, Netherlands.

Experiments on Animals Act (Wet op de dierproeven) 1977

This law was adopted by the Parliament on 12th January 1977 but did not enter
fully into effect until 1 January 1986. It is supplemented by the Experiments
on Animals Decree (Dierproevenbesluit). The Netherlands now has all the
administrative machinery necessary to implement fully the provisions of the EEC
Directive on animal experimentation, including a system for registering
premises, authorising persons involved in the use and supply of animals,
undertaking inspections and compiling statistics.

Animal Welfare Laws in Europe - A Summary

LUXEMBOURG

Animal Protection 5nd Welfare Act 1983

 

The Act of 15th March 1983 aims to safeguard the existence and well—being of
animals. Unnecessary killing or causing pain, maiming or injuring animals is
prohibited. The Act introduces requirements for keeping animals, particularly
in intensive farming and, where non—domestic animals are concerned, in farms
and other establishments for educational or scientific purposes. Transport and
slaughter are also controlled. Animal sales and shows are subject to
ministerial authorisation. .Practices such, as hunting with dogs, doping and
force—feeding are prohibited. Experiments on live animals are allowed, but all
experimental procedures require the advance approval of the Ministers of Health
and Agriculture. The authorisations, which have a time limit and may be
revoked at any time, are only granted if there is no alternative method for
conducting the experiment. The 1983 Act replaced the Protection of Animals Act
1965.

The transport of animals is regulated by the "réglement grand—ducal" of 23rd
September 1983 concerning the protection of animals in international transport.
This regulation translates pinto national law the EEC Directives 77/489 and

81/389.

 

PORTUGAL

Animal welfare in Portugal is currently governed by two Decrees dating from
1919. Decree No 5650 of 10 May 1919 makes any form of violence towards animals
a punishable act. Decree No 5864 of 12 June 1919 specifies seven forms of
cruelty which are considered violent and should be punished: beating animals,
subjecting animals to pulling or carrying heavy loads where it is obvious they
are unfit to do so, deliberately pushing animals to their limit, using force to
make an animal carry on when it falls down, using whips or any other instrument
that may harm a hunting animal, and stoning animals.

 

A new comprehensive bill on the protection of animals has been drafted and is
expected to be debated by the Portuguese Parliament in the near future. This
bill incorporates the provisions of the existing decrees and adds to the list
of prohibited acts the abandonment of animals, the use of animals in cruel
forms of training and the organisation and practice of cruel sports, with the
exception of the Portuguese form of bullfighting.

The bill furthermore requires any person in charge of an animal to provide it
with proper care, including adequate food, water and accommodation. Animals
kept in captivity, particularly animals kept in modern husbandry systems, must
be provided with appropriate space according to their physiological and
behavioural needs and appropriate heating, lighting and ventilation.

Detailed provisions are laid down concerning the transport of animals, covering
general conditions for veterinary inspection, design of vehicles and
containers, feeding and watering, loading and unloading and special conditions
for the transport of different species by road, rail, sea and air. Detailed
provisions are also laid down for the slaughter of animals, including the
treatment of animals in slaughterhouses and the requirement for pre—slaughter

stunning.

The bill also contains a series of articles governing experiments on live
animals. Persons carrying out experiments on live animals must be authorised

Animal Welfare Laws in Europe — A Summary

SPAIN

Animal welfare in Spain is governed by a series of decrees on specific
subjects. No general animal welfare law exists.

The Royal Decree Circular of 26 December 1925 makes it an obligation to protect
domestic animals; the Royal Decree Circular of 31 July 1929 prescribes
sanctions for any person who cruelly beats, burdens with excessive loads, kicks
or inflicts any kind of torture on an animal or causes its violent death; the
Decree of 14 June 1976 and the Decree of 16 December 1976 establish penalities
for those who inflict serious harm or commit acts of cruelty or mistreatment of
domestic or wild animals kept in captivity. A number of decrees also exist on
the protection of animals in traditional fiestas. '

A Decree was adopted in 1988 to comply with the EEC Directive on the protection
of animals used for experimental purposes.

A new Law on the Protection of Animals was approved by the Regional Parliament
of Catalunia on 17th February 1988. This is the first comprehensive piece of
legislation on animal welfare in Spain, although applicable only to the region
of Catalunia. The law contains general provisions prohibiting the
ill—treatment of animals and lays down a number of specific provisions,
including regulations on companion animals and animal shelters; capture of and
trade in wild animals; zoological establishments; and the prohibition of the

use of animals in fiestas.

AUSTRIA
Act No. 184 of 7th March 1974 concerning experiments on living animals.

This Act, which entered into force on 1 July 1974, lays down regulations for
experiments on live animals for the purposes of higher education, trade and
industry, medical or veterinary science and dietary research, including quality
control of foodstuffs. This includes research and development, scientific
education and medical diagnosis, and the testing and checking of sera,
medicines, basic or luxury food and drink, toxic plant protection products,
pesticides and cosmetics. Experiments must be authorised and must be carried

Tierschutzgesetz of 9 March 1978

The Animal Protection Law is a comprehensive piece of legislation which aims to
ensure the protection and wellbeing of vertebrate animals. It requires all
animals to be properly treated and forbids the deliberate infliction of pain,

suffering or injury on an animal.

The law provides for detailed provisions to be issued on the keeping of
animals, covering minimum space allowance, lighting, ventilation and stocking
density. It prohibits methods of keeping animals which do not comply with the
fundamental principles of animal protection, namely certain types of cage
systems and keeping animals in the dark.

Other sections of the law cover trade in animals, transport and slaughter,
surgical operations and experiments on animals. The law prohibits certain
practices and lays down penalties for infringements.

The Tierschutzverordnung (Animal Protection Order) of 27 May 1981 sets out
detailed provisions on the care of domestic animals (cattle, pigs and poultry),
dogs and wild animals, trade, transport of animals and animal experimentation.
Annexes to the Order specify the conditions to be fulfilled for the design and
size of cages and enclosures and stocking densities for different species.
Pigs may no longer be tethered by the neck and battery cages for hens will be
phased out by the end of 1991. In the meantime existing battery cages must
provide a minimum floor space of 500 cm2 per hen.

The Welfare of Animals Act of 20 December 1974, No 73

This Act replaces the Animal Welfare Act of 7 June 1935 and the Slaughter of
Domestic Animals and Tame Reindeer Act of 21 June 1929. It was brought into
force on 1 January 1977 by Royal Decree of 19 November 1976.

Chapter I contains general provisions relating to the treatment of animals,
animal housing, 'supervision and care, aid, medical and surgical treatment,
prohibited ways of treating animals, killing of animals and emergency
slaughter. Chapter II lays down special provisions concerning domestic animals
and tame reindeer and includes prohibited ways of treating animals, disposal of
horses, and prohibited operations (including tail—docking, de—horning,
de—breaking, and de—vocalisation). Chapter III lays down special provisions
concerning fish and crustaceans. Chapter IV covers the exhibition of animals.

Chapter VI sets out detailed provisions on the use of animals in education and
research. It is forbidden to use live animals for educational purposes except
as a necessary part of professional training. No person may carry out
biological tests on animals without special permission and such permission may
only be granted for the purpose of diagnosing animal or human disease, for
research or the production or safety testing of medicines, medicaments,
preparations, poisonous substances or the like for use in man, animals or

plants.

Chapter VII provides for the appointment of animal welfare boards by local
authorities. Penal provisions are laid down for violations of this Act.

The Norwegian Animal Welfare Society has brought a lawsuit against the
Norwegian Government in an attempt to prove that the keeping of laying hens in
battery cages is a contravention of Section 4 of the Act, which requires
"persons owning or having in their care any domestic animal, pet or animal held
in captivity in any way" to "ensure that the animal has fully suitable quarters
with sufficient space, suitable warmth, enough light and access to fresh air
etc. as appropriate to the needs of the species of animal in question".

Regulations on Electric Pre—Stunning and Slaughter of Domestic Animals were
issued by the Ministry of Agriculture on 8th November 1982 pursuant to the
Welfare of Animals Act of 20th December 1974. These Regulations replaced the
Regulations of 20th March 1971 on electric pre—stunning of domestic animals and
tame reindeer for slaughter.
