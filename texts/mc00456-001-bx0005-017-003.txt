COMMITTEE INCORPORATED 1923

August, 1944.
Dear Madam,

Owing to the generosity of our supporters we were able to help
many thousands of animals during the Raids of 1941 - and in the many
Raids since that time. And now, once again, a great demand is being
made for our Rescue Squads in London and other bombed areas in Southern
England. I will not cause you distress by telling you our experiences
in rescuing the trapped and buried animals since the Flying Bombs
began their diabolical Raids.

As you may remember from accounts I have sent you about the
work of the Squads, our Staff willingly face danger to themselves,
long hours and incessant toil to search for the animals.

We are now faced with the dreadful problem of curtailing our
Rescue Squads unless we receive financial aid; for our need for money
is urgent and immediat

If you can possibly send us a donation, how very grateful we
shall be. May I add that I trust you may be spared the ordeal that we
and the animals are enduring at the present time in Southern England.

I am, Yours very si erely,

4m} '

Founder and Hon. Director.

.8. Should you have been good enough to send a donation recently
will you pardon this lett r? Our clerical staff is so badly depleted
that an oversight in checking our lists may have occurred. If so,
.culd you further help us by kindly sending this appeal to another

animal lover.
