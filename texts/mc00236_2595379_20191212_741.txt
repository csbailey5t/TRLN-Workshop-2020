at the con- . . . . .
Philosophy has always tacked between the disparate ideals of integrity and

utility. The interminable regress of rational analysrs may result in little more than
irrelevant embrOIdery. Alternatively. the quest for power through philosophizing
may corrupt the rational absolutes and produce only polysyllabic cant. Any
philosophical work. especially those designed for introductory purposes. may~
serve the aesthetic standards of "pure" philosophy at the risk of irrelevance. or it
may follow the standards of advo acy. seeking to win causes and influence
readers at the risk of sophistry.

Even during the last thirty years. when some philosophers have turned from
limning metaphysical signs to portraying the practical dilemmas of “medical
ethics." the usual posture has still been non-directive and non-partisan. With few
exceptions (Fletcher, Ramsey. and. cfttimes. Veatch). the aims were not shaping
answers but sharpening questions. not revealing truth but refining reasoning. not
conversion but clarification. not narrowmg vision but expanding options. Like
intellectual octopi. they reveled in always being able to produce an on-the-other-
hand (and also being able to produce clouds of ink to confuse their pursuers).

As Kierkegaard noted. going to a philosopher for practical answers is like the
plight of a man lost in the midst of a wilderness. Almost overwhelmed by hunger
and weakness. he chances upon a hut with a sign in the window saying ”Bread
For Sale." Desperate. he drags himself inside. only to discover it is a sign maker‘s
shop.

The ideal observer posture carried over from linguistic philosophy—assumed
by objective, unbiased. and (purportedly) value-free non-combatants—was
reinforced by the facilitator role most of these phil050phers played in the liberal
arts classroom from whence they sprang. And even when they traded in the ivy
for the iv. the awful complexity of the "real" problems and the awesome burden

of real responsibility evoked in many humility and fear as additional motives for
indecisive objectivity. Personally. i am still tilted by the memory of the intern who
first tried to turn a tidy. theoretical debate about truth-telling into a trip to a room
on 3-West to tell a real person that she was really dying.

But. is that all there is? Clarifying and multiplying options in order to sharpen
the horns of dilemmas may be stimulating intellectual exercise. However. as
Gilbert Ryle observed. we don't learn to run better by studying our toes. When it
comes to deciding real questions. such as whether this person should be kept
ignorant. Or alive, running things better becomes really important. Using intellect
and argument only to make things more difficult (another Kierkegaardian view of
philosophers) may then be not only personally unsatisfying. but also morally
irresponsible.

At least as far back as 367 BC. when Plato tried (and failed) to train the
young king Dionysius in his ideals. philosophers have been trying (and. often.
failing) to transform the understanding and management of practical affairs.
During the last decades. health care problems have been the primary focus for
these ediiying efforts of the therapeutic intellectuals.

Allured by the intensity and complexity. the sensitivity and significance (not
to mention the raw drama) of critical medical decisions. a new group of educa-
tional activrsts has emerged. united in the belief that through the power of
disciplined reason. the forces of myopic emotion. manipulative politics. and
exploitative gurlds can be overcome. and greater power will be exercised by
those of greater virtue. -

These tnree books are works of advocacy. using philosophical techniques
and teaching to advance causes. Each addresses a particular audience. identifies

.Specitic wrongs that need redressing. and demonstrates both theoretical and
practical pioys deliberately intended to reform the reader in order to reduce
abuse. The authors are invested participants in causes of high purpose. They
summon their readers to join with them in learning how to use the weapons of
analySis and argument to strengthen their causes.

 

When it comes to deciding real questions, such as
Whether this person should be kept ignorant, or
alive, running things better becomes “really
important.

 

Phi!030phical Medical Ethics by Raanan Gillon is the least successful at
ﬁnding a respectable balance between philosophizing and proselytizing. Written
originally as a series of articles in the British Medical Journal. Gillon's targets are
his fellow physicians. particularly those Schleiermacher would have called ”the
cultured despisers" of medical ethics. instead of critically analyzing the complex
ethical problems. their responses are either pontification. abstention, or
skepticism. The last. with their preemptive denial that logic and evidence play
any part in ethical judgments. are Gillon's focal concern. Building upon ”four

and justice. Gallon promises to olter rigorously worked out lines of reasoning to
demonstrate that systematic moral judgment is possible and productive.

Unfortunately. Gillon. a sellodescribed “philosophically trained practicing
general practitioner." offers not balanced comprehensive reasoning but what
might be called "anatomistics." Each once vital. complex whole is dissected
down to a series of minute steps. Point alter tidy point is noted and numbered.
and each collection of sharpened points is then quickly injected into his reluctant
colleagues. In his eagerness to teach the bastards. Gillon imposes philosophy-
byothe-numbers. Everything has three parts or live points. and they're all "major."
"basic.” “essential." or ”local." With chapters averaging eight pages trying to
cover such topics as utilitarianism. autonomy. paternalism. deontology. and
justice. it is no wonder there is almost always a certain breathiness and often a
'stridency to his expository crusading. One example (fortunately. the most
extreme) presents thirty-eight “premises" in less than three pages as a post-
mortem report on deontology. consequentialism. commission versus omission.

Mill or provocative paragraph on Rawls is left with a disclaimer of responsibility

For the :hilosophically aware reader. this book is frustrating and, finally.
aggravating. For the intelligent medical skeptic. it must be much the same. as

Gillcn tries to use too many pornts too quickly to treat skeptic shock. He ends
up producing not an initiation but an inoculation. virtually guaranteeing that the

physicians he's treating will never catch a serious case of philosophy.

VanDeVeer and Regan. professors at philosophy at North Carolina State
University. offer a much more traditional introduction to Health Care Ethics.
Indeed. the question must be raised as to why another introductory anthology is
needed- This in some ways seems the sort ol book that is created not so much by
an author. as for a market. The market here seems to be an introductory one-
semester philosophy seminar meeting for twelve weeks (i.e.. twelve chapters).

Nonetheless. this is an excellent work of its type. it may never take best—ol-
show. but it is a leading candidate forbest-ol-breed. To be specific. I would
suggest that an,introductory work in moral philosophy should: 1) sharpen
hunger. 2) define issues. 3) expand options. 4) demonstrate tools. and 5) point
beyond itself. On all of these. except too olten the third—expand options—this
introduction does very well indeed. Health Care Ethics begins with a fifty-live-
page introduction not only to basic ethical issues and positions. but also to some
of the iundamentals of philosophical reasoning.

While unavoidably overstuffed. the objective of introducing the reader to the
significance and power and pleasure of argument is well served by an argumenta-
tive. discursive classroom style ol writing. Positions are presented and judged.
Points are made. and counterpointed. Objections are anticipated. Answers are
questioned. and (usually) questions are answered. The reader‘s overall sense is

engaging. demanding educational exercise that encourages the student-reader

to venture on to the more substantive essays that follow.

The body of this anthology consists
some first-rate thinkers with serious commitments to their subjects. These
include issue-focused chapters on topics such as euthanasia. informed consent.
experimentation, and abortion. as well as more'analytical chapters on "justice.”
“value of tile," "responsibility," and "health."

 

Like intellectual octOpi. they reveled in always being
able to produce an on-the-other-hand (and also
being able to produce clouds of ink to confuse their
pursuers).

 

The most striking element is that almost all these essays eschew the traditional
impartial observer posture. lf they are facilitators, they are very directive facilitators
of what they quite openly espouse as the right and the true. For example, Regan
writes as a hot-hearted and hard-headed advocate of animal rights. Bruce Miller,
in a marvelous essay. argues through an intensive analysis of experimentation to
a compelling moral judgment against random clinical trials. It is advocacy at its
finest. with a serious issue fairly presented. fully debated. and finally judged
(though not. of course. quite closed).

Essay after essay strives not for balance and a studied paralysis. This is real
bread for hungry minds and medicine for moral ills. When this is gm
' Wh'en‘ragree With the purposes and premises),Tt is very good. But there are
times when argument surges towards polemic, and reasoning is allowed to
proceed without rejoinder. For example. when Michael Bayles moves from a
solipsistic dismissal of vitalism to an exclusion of the "unsalvageable" from
scarce treatment. I begin to worry at how well advocacy has respected the
arguments and kept open all the options that the novices need to explore before
being able to create their own consistent, coherent. and comprehensive
conclusions. This anthology is unusually exciting, stimulating. and demanding.
But. at times it does run perilously close to replacing liberating education with
limiting indoctrination. '

Winslade and Ross, on the other hand, are quite open about their dedication
to partisan advocacy and reform. Choosing Life or Death is subtitled "A Guide
For Patients, Families and Professionals." But, including the last group conflicts
with the clearly stated tactical purpose of this book. which is to help patients and
families exert more control over the decisions traditionally made about their lives
by professionals. Specifically, this adversarial guide to greater patient autonomy
is designed to strengthen patients and families in the battle against medical
paternalism and institutional tyranny.

They devote a chapter apiece to many of the critical situations demanding
tough choices: kidney dialysis, euthanasia. genetic screening, reproductive
technology, and organ transplantation. For each situation they promise to provide

four specmc aids to help the health care amateurs compete with the professionals.
First. they Will explain the forces arrayed against the “uppity” patient. Second.
they will discuss the psychological factors that may impair decision-making
capacity. Third. they promise to outline the legal. ethical. and medical aspects of
these problematic situations. And, lourth.. they olfer practical management
strategies. All of these are designed to give lay persons better understanding of
themselves. of caregivers. and of institutions in order to have better control and
thus make choices that better serve their own desires and values.

As an insider's guide to patient defense (and offense). the book is powerful
and effective. It exposes caregivers‘ and institutions’ potential for conflicts of
interest. It gives glimpses of the often imperfect reality behind the professional
masks and institutional policies. And it offers sound. sensible advice. For instance.
the chapter on lite-extending decisions advises families to get united. get allies.
get.the facts and policies. and get tough.

The last injunction is. unfortunately. too pervasive. There is no real sense of
how a more constructive partnership might be developed between patient and
professionals. 'Almost all the tactics are weapons to use against the Papa Doc's.
This adversarial and rather sensationalistic spirit is italicized by their extended
case histories. which tend towards tabloid confrontations between victimized
patients and exploitive physicians. At times they almost seem to be trying to
generate the antagonistic indignation and distrust that would make'their defense
manual necessary.

This excess is unfortunate. Since Choosing Life or Death serves an important
purpose and could have been an even more effective introduction for patients
and their families. The purported paradigmatic situations are too exotic and too
extreme- For every one person considering organ transplantation or surrogate
parenting, there are thousands trying to decide whether to “follow doctor's
orders" on blood pressure medicine. diet. or alcohol use. For every confrontational
tyrant. there are hundreds of subtle (and benevolent) seducers. And. most
important. for every patient who will really benefit from guerilla training. there are
so many more who could benefit from a serious introduction to such decision
analysis techniques as risk-benefit and cost-benefit reasoning, and utility analysis.
As good as this book is in advocating patient power and in training patients how
to use such power to manage others. it might well have helped more by
deveiOping persons rational and critical capaCities to manage their own thinking
and cooperate with others in making choices about their lives.

In different wayS'each of these books comes down from the objective.
analytical perspective to committed advocacy. These are not purely academic
works. but books that use academic tools and tactics to serve. in the fullest
meaning of the term, political purposes. Whether directed at physicians or
students or patients. they continue a venerable practice of philosophers who
would be kings. However, while their causes are worthy and their commitment
honorable, it is well to remember Kant's warning in Perpetual Peace that "the
possession of power is inevitably fatal to the true exercise of reason."

Department of Obstetrics and
Gynecology, University of Illinois
Hospitals, 840 S. Wood, Chicago, IL

The authors survey the incidence of
such court-ordered obstetrical procedures
as cesarean sections, hospital detentions,
and intrauterine transfusions and the
attitudes of selected obstetricians toward
imposing medical treatment on pregnant
women who refuse it. They discuss the
impact of their ﬁndings on obstetrical
pracnce and maternal and infant health
and the legal validity and advisability of
courrordered interventions. George
Annas‘s accompanying editorial
“Protecting the Liberty of Pregnant
Patients" (pp. 1213-14) addresses the legal
and moral implications of their ﬁndings.

The authors explore the legal aspects
of existing public health policies to
control the spread of AIDS, legal liability
associated with AIDS transmission, and
the involvement of public health experts
in discrimination-based cases against
persons with AIDS or suspected of having
AIDS. A review of AIDSrelated legislation
and litigation and its potential impact on

of human disease, with its overreliance
on technology and undervaluation of
caring for patients and alleviating pain

In the midst of so many introductory medical ethics texts that have hit the
market in recent years, Health Care Ethics stands above its competitors in two
ways: it has a very interesting and new selection of essays, and, more importantly,
it has a very good introduction.

Some of the relatively new topics addressed include personal responsibility
for illness, autonomy in nursing, and health care institutions. These topics are
complemented by the more traditional ones, including euthanasia, abortion,
informed consent, allocation of health care resources, experimentation, to name

a few. One shortcoming is that some classic essays are not included (e.g., “The
Myth of Mental Illness” by Thomas Szasz, “Active and Passive Euthanasia” by
James Rachels, and “A Defense of Abortion” by judith jarvis Thomson). Of
course, not every article can be included in every anthology, and, as the editors
point out, the text can be easily supplemented. A second problem is that since
the number of articles is quite limited (thirteen), some views on a given issue are
not represented. However, in many cases, the author presents various views, so
this problem is to some extent mitigated.

The introduction by VanDeVeer is very good. His overview of moral claims,
basic logic (validity, soundness, fallacies), and major ethical theories (utilitarianism,
Kantianism, rights, Rawlsianism) eliminates the need for selections on these topics
which students often ﬁnd too abstract and unintelligible. My only complaint here
is that more of the examples could be related to issues in medical ethics so that
students can see the point immediately. A. M. S.

Health Care Ethics: An Introduction J

his book adds to the expanding

ﬁeld of texts on health care ethics.
A lengthy (SO-page) introduction to
traditional ethical theories and criteria
of ethical argumentation is followed
by 12 self-contained chapters. Each
chapter addresses a separate issue:
euthanasia, informed consent, human
experimentation, abortion, the treat-
ment of mentally disabled persons,
the treatment of animals, the value of
life, health care and social ju'stice,
personal responsibility for illness,
concepts of health, ethical autonomy
in nursing, and health care institutions.

As an introduction to health care

ethics, the book succeeds but doesn’t
shine. With one exception, the edi-
tors and the authors are all philoso-
phers. The exception is Joy Curtis, a
nurse, who coauthored the chapter on
ethical autonomy in nursing. The
major strength of these authors, who
are well known in their ﬁeld, is their
ability to summarize the conceptual
and philosophical issues of health
care ethics. However, they tend to ig-
nore many of the ethical concerns
and issues that affect professionals in

the allied health ﬁelds. They focus on

ethical issues in the physician—patient
relationship. Such issues are certainly
important and relevant to the allied
health care professional, but their dis-
cussion is not new. More helpful
would be chapters on ethical issues
that arise for professionals in their in-
teractions with one another (such as
medication cover-ups, or the profes-
sional division of labor and its impact
on client care). Such omissions,
though, do not detract from the valu-
able work that is offered in this book.
Without being too simplistic, the in-
troduction and the chapters are acces-
sible to nonphilosophers. They do
not avoid technical philosophical ter-
minology and sophisticated argumen-

62

tation but they ever lose sight of the
reader and discuss the issues in an ap-
proachable and helpful manner. As an
overview of some important ethical
issues within and about health care,
this book does a ﬁne job. What
“sins”it has are those of omission, not
commission.

The Effectiveness of Early
Intervention for At-Risk and
Handicapped Children

arly intervention for children is
E now a prominent feature of our
service delivery system. In the past 2
decades numerous programs have
been designed and preliminary re-
search has been conducted to assess
the effectiveness of current programs
and to determine appropriate strate-
gies for optimal development in this
population.

This book provides an organiza-
tional framework for understanding
current research and issues of early
intervention for children who are at
risk or have documented disabilities.
The book begins with a description of
the rationale and evidence for early
intervention. It also explains general
approaches used in planning early in-
tervention programs and the role of
primary care professionals. Next, the
book analyzes the effectiveness of
early intervention programs for envi~
ronmentally at-risk children and for
infants at increased biological risk.
The following section explores re-
search and programs for children with
documented disabilities.

The chapters discuss the effec-
tiveness of early intervention for chil-
dren with cognitive and general de-
velopmental delays, motor handicaps,
language and communication dis-
orders, autism, Visual impairments,
and hearing impairments.

Each chapter is organized in a
consistent format and describes the
classiﬁcation, incidence, and charac-
teristics of a speciﬁc disability. The
book also includes descriptions of the
early intervention programs pertinent
to the speciﬁc population and the
theoretical constructs on which the

studies are based. Studies are summa-
rized in tabular format, with the same
subheadings (i:e., nature of interven-
tion, parameters, outcome measures,
and results) being used in each
chapter to compare and contrast infor-
mation from various areas. These
tables summarize current research
and the outcomes of the preliminary
programs. An extensive list of refer-
ences is provided at the end of each
chapter.

The ﬁnal section of the book ex-
amines current and future perspec-
tives for early intervention, by focus-
ing on the role of parents, outcome
expectations, practice models, and
the training of professionals. At the
end of the chapter is a brief section
on biomedical and nonstandard ap-
proaches to early intervention. The
authors mention patterning as advo-
cated by Doman and Delacato, sen-
sory integration according to Ayres,
and developmental optometry as ex-
amples of popular, controversial ther-
apies. Unfortunately, the authors
group these approaches together and
criticize all of them as being of lim-
ited effectiveness without substantial
evidence or references to back these
claims.

This book is a notable attempt at
summarizing the existing research on
the effectiveness of early intervention
for at-risk and handicapped children.
It would be especially beneﬁcial for
occupational therapists who are inter-
ested in program development or re-
search in this area. The authors have
acknowledged the shortcomings of
the current research and challenge
the readers to build on the work of
the ﬁrst generation of early interven-
tionists.
