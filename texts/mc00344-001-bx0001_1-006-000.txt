P. 0. Box 3492-Grand Central Sta.
New York, N. Y. 10017

Dear Miss Stevens:

Thank you very much for returning the two copies of the application
along with your check in the amount of $425.00 to cover exhibit
space at our 106th Annual Meeting in Minneapolis this July. As you
will note from the copy we are returning to you, the Animal Welfare
Institute has been assigned booth #911.

2::::::
Exhibit space has been assigned on a basis of one (1) point for each
$500 of advertising in AVMA publications in 1968, and five (5) points
for each year of participation in an AVMA exhibit. Obviously, under
this system, not all companies will receive the specific space re-
quested. In such instances, every effort has been made to assign
space of a substantially similar area in another location.

Complete information about booth furniture, electricity, labor and
drayage will be mailed to you by our official contractor, Manncraft
Exhibitor Service of Kansas City, Missouri. Meanwhile, please note
the enclosed bulletins concerning the change in exhibit hours and
new shipping information.

Thank you for participating in our 106th Annual Meeting.

Cordially,

MINNEAPOLIS

 

House Acts on
Nine Resolutions

Nine resolutions were presented to the
House of Delegates this year. Of these,
the delegates adOpted one, voted not to
ad0pt two and approved a substitute
motion for the remaining six.

AdOpted as amended, was Resolution
5, which requested the appointment of
an ad hoc committee to study and pro-
mulgate guidelines providing for vertical
membership for all constituent associa-
tions of the AVMA, with recommended
changes in AVMA Bylaws to be prepared
for presentation to the House of Dele-
gates in 1970.

Not adopted were Resolutions 4 and 9.
Resolution 4 requested an amendment to
last year’s Resolution 3, which granted
the reimbursement to both delegates
and alternate delegates for their air
fare and an additional $80 to cover other
expenses related to their attendance at
the annual meeting. The 1969 Resolu-
tion 4 would have granted this reim-
bursement to the delegate only.

Resolution 9, which was not adopted,
required that -3 candidate for president-
elect of the AVMA must have served a
minimum of 4 years in the capacity of a
member of the House of Delegates or the
Executive Board of the AVMA, or both
in the 10 years immediately preceding his
candidacy.

Resolutions 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 8 per-
tained to constitutional changes and had
basically the same intent: to institute a
mail ballot for the election of AVMA
officers. Following an hour-long discus-
sion in which the pros and cons of a mail
ballot were thoroughly and frankly de-
bated, the ‘delegates approved the fol—
lowing substitute motion to the recom-
mendation of Reference Committee 4,
which had been assigned to study the six
resolutions:

We request the Executive Board to
draft appropriate Constitution and Bylaw
amendments for consideration at the 1970
annual meeting to provide for the follow-
mg:

1) Nominations by the House of Dele—
gates for the president-elect, vice presi-
dent, and president, if necessary.

2) That the nominations be restricted
to three men for each office.

3) That the election for these offices
be conducted by mail.

4) That guidelines be established to
govern the conduct of the campaign.

”Good Government Begins with You,”

Veterinarians Told

Speaking to approximately 2,000 veterinarians and visitors at the AVMA Plenary
Session, July 15, in the Minneapolis Auditorium, Dr. Earl L. Butz, former Assistant
Secretary of Agriculture, pleaded with veterinarians to take pride in their profession
and in America’s incentive-oriented system of economy. “The system,” he said,
“has made it possible for America, among all other nations of the world, to achieve

 

Special-Interest Groups

Seated in House

The House of Delgates approved the
seating of representatives from the Am—
erican Animal Hospital Association at its
opening session Saturday, July 12. Rep-
resentatives for the AAHA were Drs.
Ray L. Russell, Mesa, Ariz., delegate;
and Franklin Gruesser, Jacksonville,
Fla., alternate delegate.

Representatives from the American As-
sociation of Equine Practitioners were in-
vited to attend as auditors, with the ex-
pectation that full membership in the
House would become effective at the 1970
annual meeting. Representing the AAEP
were Drs. R. K. Shidler, Reno, Nev.,
delegate; and D. L. Proctor, Lexington,
Ky., alternate delegate.

Other special-interest groups that al-
ready have membership in the House
are the Industrial Veterinarians Associ—
ation and the American Association of
Bovine Practitioners.

 

Only One Tour of
Veterinary College

There will be only one tour of the Uni-
versity of Minnesota College of Veteri-
nary Medicine in St. Paul on Thursday,
July 17. It will leave Minneapolis at 8:30
a.m., returning about 12:00 noon. Passen-
gers will be picked up in the Auditorium
area of the Convention Hall.

the Communist goal—plenty for everyone
in a classless society. This,” he said,
“is worth standing up for and fighting
for.”

Dr. Butz, who is currently dean of
continuing education and vice president
of the Purdue Research Foundation,
Purdue University, delivered the keynote
address of the AVMA’s 106th annual
meeting, on the topic “Good Government
Begins With You.”

“Those who don’t participate in gov-
ernment, don’t have the right to criti-
cize those who do,” he said. “All of us
have the obligation to participate.” Stat-
ing that government is big business, the
biggest single enterprise in America,
and that it is going to keep on growing,
Dr. Butz said the question we face is
“what will be the relationship between
your government and you?” To preserve
an economic and political structure
which at one and the same time pro-
vides an adequate level of security and
welfare for all people,=‘and yet provides
a strong incentive for individual excel-
lence and advance, is the overriding
challenge we face, he said. “We must
never let the state of our national wel-
fare be placed in jeopardy by unwise
and unbridled manipulation of our na-
tional welfare state,” he warned.

In conclusion, Dr. Butz said, “We
need to create in all our people a fun-
damental understanding of the high role
played in the American economic sys-
tem by profit.

Inaugural Address

In his inaugural address, Dr. John B.
Herrick (ISU ’46), president-elect of the
AVMA, directed the thinking of veterin-
arians to the future of veterinary med-
icine and problems within society and
the profession which they must help
solve. He challenged the profession to
tailor veterinary education, research, and
practice to help work out solutions to
the worldwide problems of hunger and
environmental pollution. Immediate prob-
lems within the profession needing solu-

Swine Practitioners
Form National Society

Thirty veterinarians met at the Min-
neapolis Municipal Auditorium Monday,
July 14, 1969, to establish a national so-
ciety representing the nation’s 2,600
swine practitioners. Dr. John B. Herrick,
AVMA President-Elect, acted as chair-
man of the initial conference, which re-
sulted in the election of Dr. V. D. Lad-
wig, practitioner from Sac City, Iowa,
as the first president and Dr. James H.
Bailey, extension veterinarian from South
Dakota State University as secretary.

Attending the meeting were swine prac-
titioners principally from Iowa, Indiana,
Minnesota, and Missouri. Their expressed
intention was to form an organization
that would serve the needs of swine
practitioners from all parts of the coun-
try. A temporary slate of board mem-
bers was designated so that the busi-
ness activities of the organization could
commence immediately. Bylaws to gov-
ern the conduct of the organization were
also proposed, based on the bylaws
adopted by the American Association of
Bovine Practitioners.

Dr. D. A. Price, assistant executive
Vice president of the AVMA offered the
assistance of AVMA’s legal counsel to
deal with matters of incorporation, since
the group intends to require that all its
voting members be AVMA members. Dr.
Arthur Freeman, editor of J.A.V.M.A.,
offered the services of the AVMA pub-
lications staff to assist in publicizing the
new organization.

A second meeting has been planned
for Feb. 25, 1970, to be held in conjunc-
tion with the Iowa VMA meeting. A ten-
tative program was proposed which will
be organized under the direction of the
newly designated progam chairman,
Dr. Thomas J. Keefe, St. Louis, Mo.

Interested persons are invited to con-
tact the secretary, Dr. James H. Bail-
ey, extension veterinarian, South Dako-
ta State University, Brookings, S. Dak.

The Brothers and the Sisters Featured at Entertainment Tonight

It’s different. It’s exciting. It’s for you
— the entertainment tomorrow night,
Wednesday, July 16, at the social high-
light of the AVMA convention in the
arena of the Minneapolis Auditorium.

First there’s the impressive ceremony
at 8:00 p.m. when all the new officers

 

of the AVMA and the Women’s Auxiliary
will be installed.

After that, comes the entertainment.
Starting off will be two comedy tram-
poline performers, Chase and Parks,
whose acts have been the “top click”
at all major TV, sport shows, fairs, in-
dustrial shows, and hotels that use en-
tertainment today.

After their act, come “The Brothers
& Sisters,” the evening’s feature.

The clean-cut singing group of 19 boys
and girls, ranging in age from 17 to 21,
was founded by Robert Simpson, one of
the country’s top theatrical producers.
The group has played at such well-
known night clubs as Caesar’s Palace
and the Flamingo in Las Vegas, and the
Cork Club in Houston. In the Nugget in
Reno, they shared the billing with Sand-
ler & Young.

They have just cut a commercial for
Pontiac, which is scheduled for near fu-
ture release. “The Brothers & Sisters”
have played before convention audiences
all over the United States and Canada
and have appeared with Tennessee Ern-
ie Ford, Bobby Vinton, and Alan King.
For 2 months this summer, they will
play at state fairs in Maine, Kansas,
Minnesota, Wyoming, Michigan, and A1-
abama.

This is an exciting group. Wholesome
in appearance and with outstanding sing-
ing voices, they will perform in many
beautifully choreographed n u m b e r 5.
Their repertoire includes numbers from
musical shows “Music Man,” “Mame,”
“Hello, Dolly,” and “Fiddler on the

7ém¢é Wm afdwuozg Committee

Many people contribute to the success of that Annual Production
that we call the Annual Meeting of the AVMA—the convention man-
ager, the section officers, AVMA officers, the hotels and their staffs,
the chamber of commerce—and the Convention Advisory Committee.
This year, that means Dr. Ben Pomeroy and his staff. They have
done a terrific job, and their planning and hard work have paid off
——this has been a good convention. And we appreciate their cheerful
help on the many details that have
made this an instructive, happy time
for those more than 4,000 persons
who came here.

Seven Veterinarians Receive AVMA Awards

Seven veterinarians were honored
with awards Tuesday, July 15, during
the Plenary Session of the 106th annual
meeting-of the AVMA, held in the
arena of the Minneapolis Auditorium.
The awards, presented annually at the
AVMA convention, in recognition of out-
standing contributions of veterinarians
to the veterinary medical profession, in-
cluded two new ones this year, the Pub-
lic Service Award and the American
Feed Manufacturers Association Award.

The 1969 award winners were:

 

Dr. N. M. Konnerup Dr. M. W. Allam

Dr. Konnerup received the XIIth In-
ternational Veterinary Congress P r i z e
for his “outstanding contributions to the
international advancement of veterinary
medical science. He is a livestock di-
sease specialist in the Office of Techni-
cal Cooperation and Research of the
US. Agency for International Develop-
ment. Previously, he served as acting
chief of the Health Data Department,
Walter Reed Army Institute of Research,
and as a veterinary analyst for the Ec—
onomic Research Service of the US.
Department of Agriculture.

Dr. Konnerup is a member of, or con-
sultant to, many committees concerned
with animal health and conservation.
He is a diplomat of the American
Board of Veterinary Public Health and
chairman of a committee on foreign ani-
mal diseases of the US. Animal Health
Association and of the Task Force on
International Disease Problems of the
National Research Council.

He has been awarded the US. De-
partment of Agriculture’s Certificate of
Merit and its cash award for Superior
Service, the U.S.D.A.’s Unit Award for
Superior Service, and the US. Army’s
Commendation for Outstanding Per-
formance.

Dr. Allam received the AVMA Award
for his “significant contributions to the
advancement of veterinary medicine in
its organizational aspects.” He is dean
of the University of Pennsylvania School
of Veterinary Medicine, director of the
University’s Interdisciplinary C a n c e r
Research Unit, and a member of the
Board of Managers of Philadelphia’s
Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biol-
ogy.

He has been professor of veterinary
surgery at the University since 1951 and

6

is noted for his research in surgical
asepsis, peripheral nerve regeneration,
and cancerous tissue transplants.

Dr. Allam has been honored twice as
“Veterinarian of the Year”: in 1957 by

the American Animal Hospital Associa-
tion and in 1964 by the Pennsylvama

 

Dr. F. L. Frye

Dr. Frye was the recipient of the
Practitioner Research Award for his
“outstanding research activities w hile
engaged in private practice. A small
animal practitioner, he is a partner in
the Berkeley Cat and Dog Hospital.

Dr. Frye earned a BS. degree in Ani-
mal Science at the University of Cali-
fornia, majoring in endocrinology and
was pursuing an MS. degree in animal
husbandry when he was accepted into
its school of veterinary medicine.

After obtaining his D.V.M. degree, he
spent over a year as a veterinary epi-
demiologist for California’s Cancer Field
Research Program in its Department of
Health before turning to private prac-
tice.

His research has examined the ef-
fects of protein stress on skeletal for-
mation, the pathogenesis of rabies, and
the application of cardiovascular surg-
ery to clinical veterinary practice. He
has authored or co-authored almost 40
publications.

Dr. A. B. Hoerlein

Dr. Hoerlein was presented the Bord-
en Award for his “research contribu-
tion to dairy cattle disease control.” He
has been professor of microbiology in
the College of Veterinary Medicine, Col-
orado State University, since 1959. In
addition to teaching, his recent and
most significant research deals with the
pathogenesis, diagnosis, and control of
bovine genital vibriosis. While the di-
sease is of special interest in range
cattle, it is also an important cause of
infertility in dairy herds, especially in
replacement heifers naturally bred to
bulls.

Dr. Hoerlein’s earlier research was on
respiratory diseases of cattle, particular-
ly the infectious diseases in calves col-
lectively known by cattlemen as “ship-
ping fever.”

Presenting Dr. Hoerlein with the Bor-
den Award was Mr. Stephen E. Kor-
sen, president of the Borden Foundation.
