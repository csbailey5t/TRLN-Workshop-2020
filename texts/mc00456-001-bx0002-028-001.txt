Cats of a good ratting strain are the most effective means for
keeping down rats, but in the western counties the trappers take
a heavy toll of them.

 

 




 

 

THE COUNTRYSIDE OF ENGLAND

is dishonoured by the extensive use of the gin trap. This will,
however, be abolished if the Gin Traps (Prohibition) Bill passes
into law. The opposition to that measure rests partly on genuine
difﬁculties, but mainly on prejudice, limited knowledge and
confused thinking.

It is not true that the gin trap is a good means for keepng down
rabbits. Commercial trappers have worked up an excess of rabbits
which are doing great harm to agriculture in West Wales and
elsewhere, and the humane Australian method of fumigation
with cyanide dust is incomparably more efﬁicent.

It is not true that the gin trap is an effective means for dealing
with rats and mice in bulk. Quite other methods are recom—
mended by rat experts. Moreover, where trapping is applicable
the Brailsford trap is more efﬁcient, and the break—back trap
hardly less efﬁcient than the gin.

On the other hand, game- -keepers at present prefer to use the
0 in for poaching cats, birds and other predators. Humane
ineans for predator— —control are available but the gin is favoured
by custom and habit, and perhaps by convenience.

It 1s also true that, in some types of country, t1app1ng yields a
larger proﬁt to the commercial rabbiter than does any other
method of catching rabbits, though 1n other districts such means
as the long net yield a satisfactory proﬁt It 1s further true that,
as a corollary to the abolition of the gin in England, the importa—
tion of trapped rabbits from Australia must be considered in due
course. It is further true that there exists a widespread though
irrational prejudice against eating shot rabbits. On the other
hand, wild rabbits as stock do not pay the farmer, and pastures
are being sacriﬁced for the beneﬁt of the trapping industry.

You are asked to consider whether for the sake of the advan—
tages offered by the gin trap, and in spite of its disadvantages,
any person possessed of self—respect and decent feeling can be a
party to the continued use of this instrument in England.

Detailed information will be supplied by the following society,
which is promoting the Gin Traps (Prohibition) Bill with the
support of many humanitarian and public bodies:
