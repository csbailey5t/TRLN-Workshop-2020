men ANIMALS,

’ An Anglican clergyman, the
Reverend V. A. Holmes-Gore
wrote a book, THESE WE HAVE
NOT LOVED. He tells how
Lecky in HISTORY of European
Morals made a grave charge: “On
the whole Christianity has done
very little to inculcate humanity
to animals.” This was said near-
ly a hundred years ago. “It is
surprising that there is so little
teaching in the Gospels inculcat-
ing kindness to animals. . . . As
Lecky says, ‘The animal world be-
ing altogether external to the
scheme of redemption, was beyond
the range of duty, and the belief
that we have any kind of obliga-
tion to its members has never
been inculcated by theologians.”

. In the 19th century, Anna
Kingsford wrote: “The great
need of the popular form of
Christian religion is precisely a
belief in the solidarity of all liv-
ing things. . . . Who can doubt it
who visits Rome —— the city of
the Pontiff —- where now I am,
and witnesses the black-hearted
cruelty of these ‘Christians’ to
the animals who toil and slave
for them. Today I saw a
great, thick-shod peasant kick his
mule in the mouth out of pure
wantonness. Argue with these
ruffians, or with their priests,
and they will tell you “Christians
have no duties to the beasts that
perish.’ Their Pope has told them
so. So that everywhere in Catho—
lic ‘Christiandom —— and alas, in
Protestant Christendom’ —
poor, patient dumb creatures en—
dure every species of torment
without a single word being ut-
tered on their behalf by teachers
of religion. It is horrible—damna-
b-le. 'And thetrue reason of it

’f ‘ all is=,_;b,ecause the beasts are pop-

Schiller: In the Christian R
ligion I find an intrinsic dispos

expression of that highest.”

J. Howard Moore: “Man is
savage. He has always carrieoi
on his activities on the assump
tion that there was nobody else
in the world to be considered. . . .
Live and let live. Do more, live
and HELP LIVE. Do to beings be-
low you, as you would be done
to by beings above you.”

Miss Lind-af-Hageby, a tall and
beautiful Swedish girl of an
artistocratic family, went to
England many years ago to give
her entire life to the cause of anti—
vivisection. “During all the years
that I have fought vivisection I
have worked side by side with my
friends in the medical profession.
There is organized international
COOperation between medical op-
ponents of vivisection.

“The last twenty years have
witnessed a steady increase in
surgical operations and in vivi-
section experiments more or less
openly associated with surgery.
The Rockerfeller Institute of New
York has set the pace with its ex—
altation of experiments to the
level of religion.

“Rockerfeller (J. D. Rocker—
feller Jr.) gives, as every one
knows, large sums of money for
vivisection research. But it is a
curious thing that he has engag-
ed a personal physician — the
curious part of it is not that he
has a physician attached to his
person for, being a ‘king in his
own sphere of life’ he can well
afford it —— the strangeness of the
circumstance lies in the fact that
this personal physician of.his is
both a homeopath and a very
pronounced anti-vivisectionist, as
was his last physician. Dr. Ham—
ilton Fisk Biggar.

“Vivisection has now become
a fashion which pervades all or—
thodox medical thought; nothing
can be accepted or believed which
has not been tested on animals.
As the belief in God and surviv-
al cannot be tested on labratory,
animals, the belief is cast aside
as futile and uninteresting by the
guardians and governors of the
labratory school of medicine.” '

Holmes-Gore~ who described th- 1
historical Christian indifference

We say, and all the animals were-to cruelty to animals, for Chris—
gentle servants to us. Well, the tian theology declares that they

world would yet be a place of

have no souls, that they are a

peace if W9 were all peace—mak- kind of machine, I wanted to tell

ers, and gentle Service should we
have of its creatures if we gave
them gentle mastery. 'But so long
as we make sport of slaying a
bird and beast, so long as we
choose to contend rather with our
fellows than with our faults, and
makebattlefields of our meadows
instead of pastures — so long,
truly, the flaming sword will still
turn every way, and the gates of
Eden remain barred close enough
till we have sheathed the sharper
flame of our own- passions, and
broken down the closer gates of
our own hearts.”

But here I must say that there
have always been great fore-run—
ners of the world who saw it
otherwise — like Pythagoras liv-
ing seven hundred years before
Christ, and Plutarch and among
pre-Christian pagans or among
the old Testament prophets,
Isaiah and others, and among the
mediaeval saints, like St. Fran-
cis, and among all the greatly
gifted souls who have ever lived
there isthe most vehemently ten—
der and passionate love for ani-
mals, a feeling of the most loving
fellowship with all animals. In
fact it has been and is now such
an inevitable part of all‘the ex—
traordinary and lofty persons who
have trod this earth that it is a
way of judging and classifying
ourselves. Is there a tiny spark-
let of something first rate in us?
Or not?

of some most endearing letters
in this month’s ANIMAL DE-
FENDER from London. A cer-
tain Mr. Tester had written that
animals were entirely soulless and
had no future life. Here are a
few answers:

Dear Sir: In reply to Mr. J.
A. Tester that “There is no reun-
ion with animals after death.” I
am not a theologian but I know
that Christ taught us that God
is LOVE and that we shall be
happy with HIM for all eternity
(inasmuch as we really wish for
this.)

This gives me the assurance
that anybody and anything we
may love here on earth, we shall
possess to a far greater degree
hereafter; and this is a measure
which we cannot eVen imagine '
with" our present, imperfect knowl-
edge.- For the same reason we
cannot know, of course, in what
way we shall be reunited with
the animals we loved.

As a Christian I have not the
slightest doubt, however, that
this will be the case. Yours sin-
cerely, Charlotte M. M. Sacher,

Hon. Treasurer of the Catholic
Study Circle For Animal Wel-
fare.

 

 

Dear Sir: , ,

interested in lots of things, but
especially babies and puppies.
Several times I have seen him
‘stand up to a pram and peep at
the occupant.

l A few months ago, my lady
friend’s Aunt died suddenly. Be-
fore the day was out, her not
young, but healthy cat had died.
I have heard of other cases with
dogs and cats.

Insects were mentioned in this
article. I had an experience this
last summer. I was busy typing
at home, when I noticed a bee
trying to find its way outside. I
thought, “You’ll have to wait un-
til I finish this sheet Bee, and
then I will open the window.” The
bee didn’t wait for me to com—
plete my immediate task, but
flew across to me, danced in front
of my face, and then went back
to the window, which I opened
immediately, and the bee flew
outside.

 

Yours sincerely,
Aubrey Senior.

Dear Sir:

Mr. Tester states that there is
no reunion with animals after
death. I happen to be the author .
of a book containing a wealth of
evidence to the contrary. Its title
is “When Your Animal Dies” and
it has recently gone into the sixth
edition. Sylvia Barbanell.

And the Editor adds to all this:
“Lady Dowding asks us to say
that she KNOWS from her own
experience that animals survive
and can make known their pres-
ence to those whom they love.
She affirms that where there is
love there CAN be no permanent
separation.”

On Friday April 6th Victor Co-
hen had a long article, with a
— huge picture, on the front page of
' the Morning Tribune and what is
astonishing is that it covered the
2 TOP HALF OF THE FRONT
PAGE. This is pro—vivisection pro-
’ paganda, necessary all the time
.to persuade people that it is al-
’ right, and okay, and fascinating
' and really awe-inspiring, because
' it is so scienterrific. The thick,
black headlines said: DOG’S OR-
GANS ARE REMOVED, THEN
REPLACED. “U” DOCTORS SEE
APPLICATION TO MAN.
. And the huge photograph was
of the affectionately smiling
young Dr. Richard C. Lillehei
“And” (says the caption) “HIS
. RESEARCH HELPER,” i.e. a sad
litle dog leaning against his knee
. and pathetically happy, as always,
to be patted.

Here followeth Victor Cohen:

“Out of such studies, too, may
come facts that one day will help
surgeons transplant stomach and
intestines from one human being
to another.” (My question: From

From a living person to a living

be for surgeons —-— the skill! the
excitement! the interest of it and
the jubilations over it all!).““Lil-

“Here, step by step, is what
these men have done in the past
three years 4— in a shabby labra-
tory in a converted white house
on the rim of the medical campus,
just off Washington Avenue.

“Their first interest was the
study of irreversbile shock -— a
condition of the body that kills
many accident‘victims and some
weakened patients on the Operat-

Ved halt in blood supply to the in-

to find this out?) “Fifteen dogs

“These dogs, so far, have never

would be to take (and give) fewer

sume food and water not -—- as

From THE MEDICAL TIMES,
England: Students are trained to

believe that a knowledge of the _

results of animal experiments is
a sine qua non to successful prac-
tice. As a matter of fact, such ex—
periments are more frequently
misleading in their results than
otherwise. No, it is clinical (hu-
man beings) and practical know-
ledge that counts when the former
student goes out into the world to
deal with patients.”

REPORT ON THE
POOR ANIMALS

I now have to write another
terrible column on Vivisection,
which is an enormous, invisible,
unspoken practice, and so un-
bearable that those who practice
it are afraid to let it be known.
And so terrible that the rest of
us cannot bear to hear about it
or even to know what is happen-
ing. We have a state law now
that allows animals “saved” by
the Animal Rescue League to be
sold to the University and hos-
pitals and Mayo labratories, for
Vivisection.

 

The kindly public assumes that
the animals are all nicely ana-
esthetized, that there isn’t very
much of it anyway. And even to
mention the word “Vivisection” is
a cause for great emotional ex-
citement and indignation and
chest—heaving. This is because the
public believes it accomplishes
medical wonders, saves lives hand
over fist. What REALLY hap-
pens is so terribly wounding to
the ordinary human conscience
that nobody can bear to hear
about it, and least of all about
what is done to the animals;
and about how it is done not to
thousands but to millions, mil-

Hence the anger when you
mention the word, “Vivisection”,
the protest the chest-heaving.

But it IS true. And you don’t
have to study medicine, or to
see the experiments. One sim-
ple way to comprehend the whole
business is to see, say, one or two
brochures, the advertisements
put out by those companies who
make the instruments for the ex-
nerimenters. The pictures show

Its functions are minutely ex-
plored, and, the nerves which
come from it traced with scalpel
and forceps. In the eyes are in-
serted powerful and bitingacids,
and through their transparent
media the effect of painful in—
noculations is watched. . . . Can
the animal eat? It is to be kept

will take to starve. Can“ it
drink? It must be subjected to
experiments with fluids. It has
blood; it must be all removed
and pumped in again, that some-
thing may be learned from that.
It breaths; it shall have poison-
ous gases to inhal. Can it per-
spire? It shall be varnished and

burn? It shall be baked alive. Can
it be scalded? It shall be boiled

fened to the consistency of wood.
Is there a new disease discovered

 

chow t.

Since nobody believes me on
this subject -— a haughtily un-
scientific rhapsode (and there-
fore extraordinarily healthy),
herewith are some statements
made by physicians and scien—
tists:

 

Professor Hastings Gilford,
F.R.C.S. (In “The Lancet”):
‘ “That research into the causes
and nature of cancer is making
no headway is obvious to every-
one who has followed its drift
since the movement began with
the beginning of this century.

“And now, after sixty years of
research, all that it has to show
is a prodigious heap of facts and
inductions got by much industry
from animal sources, but, so far
as man is concerned, no better
than a tumor an innocent
tumor useless to man and
most decidedly of no use to mice

Labratory cancer research
has gone on for so many years
contentedly grinding out data
and spinning inductions without
attention being drawn to the fact
that it never produces any use-
ful results. And now, after a
half century of research, we can
see to what a deplorable waste
of energy and ability and money
this academic, aimless toil may
lead. One useful, if negative in-
duction, however emerges, which
is that the problem of the causa-
tion of human cancer is not to be
solved by experiments on lower
bacteriological animals in labra-
tories.”

Dr. George Wilson, M.D., LLD.:

“I am prepared to contend that
the indiscriminate maiming and
slaugther of animal life with
which these bacteriological meth-
ods of research and experimenta-
tion have been inseparably asso-
ciated, cannot be proved to have
saved one human life, or lessen-
ed in any appreciable degree the
load of human suffering.”

Dr. Doyen: “It is precisely be-
cause they kill so uselessly masses
of animals in all the labratories,
that therapeutical research is
now so sterile.”

 

- Dr. Edward Berdoe, M.B.C.S.:

“There is not an organ of the
animal body, not a function, not
a sensation which has not been
or is not being investigated and
experimented upon by the physio-
logists. Is
plough it with red hot instru-
ments; they pick and slice and
{galvanize it. Is it the spinal cord?

 

it the brain? They

by the facrlty” It shall ‘be com:

pelled to contract it if possible,

not. Is there any degree of agony
which just stops short of death
and no more? Nail by nail shall
be driven carefully into its limbs
till no more crucifixion can be
born.

“This

is Vivisection.”

Note: The Animal Rescue
League (such a beautiful name!)
under a recent Minnesota law,
sells the animals that are un—
claimed after five days to the Uni-

tals and the Mayo clinic for ex-
periments. There is a great, a
ravening demand for them by
these grandly scientific men.
They don’t like to have us know
it or to talk about it or think about
it much. Think rather, they say,
of the wonders of Science.

of the MEDICAL NEWS:

“The practices carried on by
conceited jackanpes to prove
over and over again already as-
certained facts, to minister to
egotism, for didactic purposes, are
not necessary and must be for-
bidden.”
Professor
M.D., LL.D.:

“ Vivisection beyond any
other pursuit, involves the inflic-
tion of torture to little or no
purpose. . . . There can be no
doubt that in this relation there
exists a case of cruelty to ani-
mals far transcending in its re-
finement and in its horror, any-
thing that has been known in
the history.of nations. There
will come a time when the world
will look back to modern vivi-
section in the name of science
as they do now to burning at the
stake in the name of religion.”

Dr. Arnold, M.B., B.Ch.,
M.B.C.S.:

“Sir Charles Bell, the discoverer
of the distinct function of the
nerves said: ‘Experiments have
never been the means of discov-
ery.’ George Granville Bantock,
the noted gynecologist and ob-
stetrician, stated that he had
never seen an experiment; Prof.
Lawson Tait, the formost surg-
eon of his day, said that vivisec-
tion had often led him astray; it
had not helped a bit. Sir Fred-
erick Treves found his experi-
ments on dogs unfitted him to
deal with the human intestine—

“I believe that medicine and
surgery have gained nothing by
vivisection, that it is, consid—
ered as a method of research, ut-
terly barren and misleading and
‘ bound in the nature of things al-
ways to be so. I am, however,
not putting forward an opinion,
butstating a fact, when I say
that there is not one of the
‘triumphs of vivisection’ such as
the antitoxin of diphtheria,
Pasteurian innoculation for an-
thrax, hydrophobia, etc., whose
utility is not strenuously denied
by eminent physicians and surg-
eons, who are themselves sup-

 

porters of vivisection. Vivisec-l

tion, that is to say, has produced
absolutely nothing whose utility
to ‘suffering humanity’ is unani-
mously affirmed, even by the vi—
visection fraternity itself.”

George Hoggan, M.D.: (Stu-
Ident under the famous French
vivisector, Bernard):

“After having related what I
saw, it is not necessary for me
to add: That I am willing to let
not only Science, but the entire
human race perish, rather than
use such means to save it.”

There are over 9000 medical
hospitals in the United States,
containing over two million beds,
and 153,000 physicians and sur-
geons, and yet there is a daily
sick population of over two mil-
lion. Where has vivisection been
of any service to the multitude:

A Nemesis lurks in it. As some-
body said: “God permits. But not
loreverf’

Report On Poor Animals

Dr. Maurice Visscher answer-
ed! a letter that Mrs. Aaron Moses
'rote to the Morning Tribune
with one of his own. She had
inveighed against the cruelty of
animals in the University’s labra-
tories and elsewhere. Dr. Vissch-
er benignly said that “the way
in which people like her make
general accusations without nam-
ing a specific perpetrator of a
cruel act is a demonstration of
the falsity of their claims.”

Well all I say is take a look
into any copy of the American
Journal of Physiology. Plenty of
names, dates; descriptions! And
federal grants of tens of thou-
sands of dollars! (Our taxes) Dr.
Visscher is head of the Depart-
ment of Physiology at the Uni-
versity.

   
 
 
   
   
  
     
  
  
   
   
  
  
  
  
  
  
       
  
  
    
  

But let that pass to more
thoughtful and in t e r e s ting-
, thi_.ngs

  

In England recently there was
a Brains Trust Program on

 
   
  

5 was a discussion of this ques-
tion: "‘If as a result of exxperi-
ments carried outon human be-
. ings in concentration camps dur-
ing-the war, a cure for cancer
had been found, how would the
Brains Trust reconcile the means
and the end —- and would the dis-
covered deserve the Nobel
' Prize?”

One member of the Brains
Trust that evening was an emi-
nent scientist, Jacob Bronowski,
M. A. Ph.D., Director-General of
the Process Development Depart-
ment of the National Coal Board.
His comments are interesting in
View of the vivisector’s comment
that “even if it be conceded that
it is morally wrong, it is a scien-
tific necessity and so is justified
' by the end justifying the means.”
Dr. Bronowski said this:

“We do object to experiments
of a certain kind, whether on
human beings or on animals. We
object to them because they de-
base the man who does them so
that he does not remain capable
of making an, objective judge-
ment. Some of the people from
whom I got a sense of science
were men of enormous humanity
-—they were men in whom the
'love of nature Was a sense of
love, a sense of devotion, a sense
of dedication. You cannot cut up
human beings and think that you
are investigating anything at all,
because you are becoming just
a machine carrying out experi-
ments. No great scientific dis-
covery has ever been made by a
machine. It has been made by a
man who has been immersed in
the miracle of nature.”

He was challenged by another
member of the team, saying that
a cure for cancer MIGHT come

   
  
   
 
  
   
 
  
  
  
  
 
  
  
  
   
 
  
   
  
 
   
   
   
   
  
  
  
 
 
 
   
   
    
    
    
  
  
   
  

 

 
  
  
  

case of ANIMALS one would tol-
erate it.” . .

Dr. Bronowski answered:

“I don’t tolerate it. I object to
cutting up human b s for ex-

actly the same reason that I ob-
ject to cutting up animals and,
in the last analysis, to cutting up
beetles and, if you like, to cut-
ting up tape worms and cheese
maggots; because in the end that
way of treating the sacredness
of life is essentially inhuman, is
desecrating the sense of life, the
sense of unity of all living
things.”

And I could add— the calcu-
lating cuttings up, though you
may fill a thousand medical li-

‘braries with them—are useless

and add nothing to knowledge.

And in the general discussion,
Dr. Bronowski remarked that it .
was a striking thing that “they
could only get third-rate scien—
tists to go into the concentration
camps to carry out these experi-
ments because only third-rate in-
tellects are emotionally so dead
as these people have to be.” '

When another member of the
Brains Trust commented that “it
was quite apparent that none of
us find any reconciliation and it
seems this conflict is the big

conflict . . .” the last word from
Dr. Bronowski was:
“The reconcilation remains

that there has never been A SIN-
GLE FIRST-RATE SCIENTIST
TO CARRY OUT THESE EX-
PERIMENTS.”

At this point people will shout
“Pasteur! Pavlov!” But
I can shout back at them: “Be-
champ,! Lamarck! Swedenborg!”
Bechamp, that infinitely greater
scientist from whom Pasteur
stole his ideas and deb-ased them
—with a flare for that newly de-
veloping menace in the world,
publ1c1ty —— made himself famous
as Well as 1niam0us. f

But let us not shout and argue.
I pass now to what Tolstoy wrote
about Pascal, the great French
scientific genius of the 17th cen-
tury. Here is a deeper andtruer
explanation of what I am always
trying to say about the limita-
tions of science and the. limita-
tions of the SOULS of scientists.
. First Tolstoy points out: “No
passion holds men so long in its
power, or hides so continuously
the vanity of temporal mundane
life or so completely keeps men
from understanding the signifi-
cance of human existence and of
its real beneficence, as the pas-
sion for worldly glory, in what-
ever form it may manifest it-
self. petty vanity, love of glory,
ambition. ‘

“Every overweening desire in-
volves its own punishment. . .
Moreover, every overweening de-
sire grows feebler with the pas-
sage of time; ambition, however,
flares up more and more with
the years. The main thing is that
the solicitude for human glOry
is always coupled with the
thought of service to men, and
a man, when he seeks the appro-
bation of others, is easily deceiv-
ed into thinking that he is living
not for himself but for the good
of those whose approbation he
seeks to obtain. And therefore
this is the most insidious and
dangerous of passions and more
difficult than all others to ex-
terminate. Only men of great
spiritual powers deliver them»
selves from this passion.

“Great Spiritual pewers give
these men the possibility of
quickly attaining great glory and
these spiritual powers likewise
give them the possibility of rec-
ognizing the nothingness of it.

“A man of this quality was
Such a man alsorwas our

quickly attained that glory which
they passionately desired; both

(Continued from Page Two)

I! having once attained it, immed-
iately recognized all the worth-_
lessness of what had seemed to
them the highest advantage 1n
the world and were terrifled by
that delusion. They exerted all
the power of their souls 1n order
to prove to men the.complete
horror of that delus10n from
which they had managed to es-
cape. . . . Both Gogol and Pascal
found this in a passionate devo-
- tion to religion. Only that one.
thing was important: what that
was was obscured by worldly de-
sires for glory. . . . They strlve
to snatch from the hands of
men this screen which, as Pas-
cal says, men hold before them
while they are. running to de-
struction.” .

When Pascal was dying he
wrote “the marvellous book,
PENSEES, made up of scattered
fragments of paper on whlch the
great dying Pascal Jotted down
his thoughts. .

“He showed that men W1thout
religion are either animals or
madmen; he led them by the nose
into their deformity, into their
senselessness, he. proved to them
0 science could take the

' ' . But Pascal be-
t lieved in God, rinity, in
, the Bible and therefore 1 was
to them” — the scientists ,the
rationalists, the “practical” ones,
the adders-and-subtrators —— ”a
settled fact that what he said to
them about the senselessness of
‘ their lives and about the vanity
of science was false. . . . This
very science, this Very senseless-
ness they considered as real life,
. as tI‘Uth, while they considered
' Pascal’s reasoning to be the fruit
of his sick abnormality. It Was
impossible to them to understand ‘
the force of the thought of this
man and, while they numbered
him among the classics, the sub-
ject—matter of his book was not
appreciated. It seemed to them
that they stood immeasurably
higher than that higher Spiritual
state 0f relig'ious consciousness
on which Pascal stood,vand con-
sequently the significance of this
marvellous book was hopelessly
hidden from them. .

“Yes, nothing is so pernicious,

so destructive to the true pro-
gress of humanity as these argu- 7
ments, adroitly adorned with .
every- contemporary ornament,
but put forward by men qui
croyent slavoir —- who think they
know — and who in Pascal’s
opinion bouleversent le monde,
upset the world.”

Sir Francis Bacon said that
“Religion is the spice which is
meant to keep life from corrup-
tion.” A return to what is seri-
ous, divine, noble and sacred is
becoming more and more diffi-
cult because of the influence of
modern scientific thought and its
increasing worldly teaching. The
inner life of religious faith (I
mean by that in case you will
misunderstand, love, compassion,
mercy, truth, understanding, in-
sight, nobility, courage, beauty)
is the only means whereby we
may oppose. the claims of scien-
tific materialism.

I often think of the great
myths of Adam and Eve and the
Serpent and the Tree of Knowl-
edge; of Lucifer who was in-
tellectual pride (the scientists,
the medical profession) battling
with God; of the dwarfs in Wag-
ner’s Niebelungen Lied — squat,
short, ugly and evil, working in
the dark underground and claw-
ing at gold. I think of them too
as “scientists”, as those know-it—
alls with thick glasses, weak
legs, pulling off flies’ wings in
labratories and feeling so useful
and important.

As for eating the Apple of the
Tree of Knowledge;- this too was
just cold-hearted curiosity with-
out love —- flies wings again,
electrodes in cats’ brains, two-
headed dogs in Russia! This was
Adam and Eve’s delicious self— _
indulgence in curiosity divorced
from love, and it led straight
down through millenium after
millenium to Hiroshima, to H-
Bombs and to our present, happy,
'contented, self-admiring scien-
tists working on nuclear murder.

And then another fantasy of
mine —— knowing what I do of the
suffering and fate of tens of
millions of poor animals, includ-
ing rats —-— and feeling and, in-
deed, KNOWING in a childish.
but also in an utterly sensible
and even inspired way that Jus-
tice exists, that Karma, that
Nemesis exist in the Universe —-
I think, and I wring my hands
at the knowledge of it: “Oh if
don’t stop it! if we don’t be-
come better, more decent! God
will get thoroughly sick and dis-
couraged with us and he’ll have
to bomb us.”

" ST, 1962

IN THIS WEEK magazine an
article tells how the chemical
companies are paying children to
collect fireflies:

“To keep the nation’s fireflies
burning in the myriads of labor-
atories now clamoring for them,
the Schwarz BioResearch firm of
Orangeburg, N. Y., has been qui-
etly organizing the children in the
country in bug brigades. The rate
this summer for firefly tails
shipped in dry ice has been 500
per hundred. This year’s quota
of a mililon neon tails has been
surpassed, thanks to a bonanza
harvest by children living around
Oak Ridge, Tenn. In two weeks
the children of Oak Ridge bagged
455,000 pyrotechnical bugs and
air-expressed them to the firefly
tail headquarters at Schwarz’s
lab. The Oak Ridge firefly cru—
sade, sparked by banners, 'raido
announcements and articles in
newspapers, resulted in a $2000
haul for the kids and their group
fleadersf’

So there is another way of mak-

ing monsters of nice little child-
ren, besides the tranquillizer
drug, thalidomide!
‘ Lovely firflies! More beautiful
and beneficient on summer nights
than stars and music, than clouds
and fountains, than flowers and
meteors! Our remote faraway an-
cestors, close to Nature, who
were still capable of love and
admiration and who were charged
with “the Poetic Genius which is
the Lord”, as William Blake ex-
pressed it, believed that fireflies
were celestial and from the Land
of Faery, as indeed they are.

about “The Philosophy of Com-

grateful if you could bring it to

for I believe the women of Amer-
ica are more capable of accepting
it than most English people. I
would be most grateful if you
would let me have a copy of your
paper, POSTEN.

Actually the value of my writ-
ing is that I first practice before
I preach. I was pacifist and veg-
etarian before I began writing
on these subjects, and through the
integrated obedience to the great—
est of all commandments, loving
GOOD with ALL the heart, soul,
mind and strength (not through
asceticism) I was able to be—
come a brammachari like Ghandi
at the age of 30. And I would say
that real—impersonal, impartial
love is only understood when one
has risen above the personal and
fleshly sense of it. But that, I
agree, depends on the approach.
The ascetic approach, taught and
practiced by those. dreadful Rom—
an Catholic monks, would lead, as
you say, to an extinction rather
than purification of “heart”.
Ghandi did it the right way and!
the next issue of WORLD FOR—
UM is to be dedicated to him.

So many thanks for your en-

shows how far you have progress-
ed on the evolutionary path.

with sinus trouble, and staring
through their bifocals at slides
with germ smears on them——
these have come to the conclu-

anyone would be fool enough, a

of diabolical cruelty for the sake
of what he calls science can be

 

expected to tell the truth about

Report On Poor Animals

You remember Dr. Visscher’s
letter to the Minneapolis Star
telling of the benevolence and
kindness of the experimenters on
animals in the research labra-
tories and rebuking Mrs. Aaron
Moses for her exaggerations?
Mr. Clarence E. Richard of the
National Anti-Vivisection Socie-
ty in Chicago has sent a letter to
the Star about the. matter, and a
copy to me. He says to me: “My
thanks for your article in the
Minnesota Posten. You handled
Dr. Visscher with neatness and
dispatch and what followed your
brief dismissal of him and his
arguments was very impressive.”

Now, his letter to the Star —
I am sure they will not print. So
I will tell you what he says in it.

 

  

 

Editor of the Minneapolis Star:
Sir: The underhanded albeit
skillful way that apolOgists for
vivisection, like Dr. Maurice B.
Visscher of the University of
Minnesota, seek to squirm out of
proven charges of subjecting ani-
mals to suffering so acute and
prolonged that it well warrants
use of the word “torture,” is
amazing. In your issue of April
3, Doctor Visscher has the af-
frontery to attack Lucille Moses
by charging her "with “false”
statements in language so slip-
7 pery and so calculated to deceive,
that he does his fellow-vivisec-
tors a distinct disservice. Unlike
Dr. Visscher, I use plain lang-
‘uage. _
1. His statement that “kind-
ness to animals is the rule in all
animal research labratories” is
completely true, AS FAR AS IT
GOES. What he doesn’t say is
how often the rule is broken, and
that every labratory director
HAS. A. RIGHT “TO SUSPEND
THE RULE AGAINST EX-
TREME AGONY IF HE
WISHES, AND IF “KINDNESS”
DEFEATS THE PURPOSE OF
THE EXPERIMENT.

2. He challenges us to “prove
our case in court.” This double-
talk is unworthy of even a Dr.
Visscher. He knows perfectly
well that state humane laws
SPECIFICALLY EXEMPT VIVI-
SECTORS from their provisions,
and that an act to a dog done by
a man on the street that would
send him to prison, may be done
in any labratory with absolutely
immunity.

3. With tongue in cheek, Dr.
Visscher talks of us “hiding be-
hind impersonal charges which,
if made against an individual,
would be basis for a slander or

  
 
       
          
  
   
     
      
      
      
         
       
         
         
   
       
  
  

  

  
  

  

   
 
  

 
 
  

  

 

vised challenge. Enclosed are a
number of leaflets issued by our
society (incidentally we are fi-
nancially sound and well able
to pay any damages for libel)
which name individuals in which
experiments were made and give
book, chapter and verse for the
accusations Doctor Visscher says
we cannot sustain. These leaflets
have been circulated for years,
through the mails and in paid
advertisements in newspapers.

no pain connected with vivisec-
tion; but in making this state-
ment they overlook many things,
including such labratory experi-
ments as the ones which are con-
ducted for th‘é’fp‘ﬁfp’ésﬁif‘invest‘i?
gating pain itself. And it gives
an account of the work of four
eminent Vivisectors at North—
west Medical School, Chicago.
They are named and the report
appeared in the Journal of ,
Neurophysiology, Vol. 12, No. 1,
January 1949, Pages 1-15.

Leaflet No. 31 is entitled “A -
SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS TO .
PRODUCE FATAL SHOCK BY
MEANS OF THE “Blalock
PRESS,” A FLESH-CRUSHING
MACHINE. (Among Vivisectors ,
the “Blalock Press” is called in
order to honor its inventor. It is
as though the Nazis proudly
named an invention, “the
Schmittbauer Eye Gouger.”) This

ed in the Journal of Clinical
Investigation, Vol. 24, No. 2,,
March 1945, Page 127-151. In

these pages the slow deaths of
literally hundreds of animals are
described by the Vivisectors,
Renato Ricca, K. Fink, Leonard
I. Katzin and Stafford L. Warren,
all of the Department of Radiol-
ogy, University of Rochester
School of Medicine and Dentis-
try, Rochester, N. Y.

These scientists set forth that
changes in ordinary room temp-
erature alter the speed at which
dogs die under the Blalock
Press; and they say that these ‘
changes in temperature “in-
fluence or control the outcome.”
Throughout the eXpe-riments, the
Vivisectors are intent on this
point "— that room temperature
changes the times at which an-
imals die of torture and shock.
They were little. interested in
making any other point. They
report that at a temperature of
83 degrees Fahrenheit, a five-
hour ordeal in the. Blalock Press
will kill 90 percent of the dogs
subjected to it —— but at a temper-
ature of only 61 degrees, only a
few animals expire. Thus, the
Vivisectors seem to “prove” that
an animal body in shock is better
off in an atmosphere that en- ;
ables it to keep its own inner
temperature as nearly normal as
possible. Apparently the vivisec—
tors, (as Mr. Richard says), “felt
unable to arrive at their con-
clusion by means of the strenu-
ous exercise of common sense.”

The Blalock Press is a mech-
anical jaw “scientifically” clamp-
ed together at measured press-
ures ranging from 500 to 4,000
pounds. In general, the vivisec-

and of course none was given
in the later hours when the an-
imal lay dying as a, result of the
ordeal. Some of the dogs remain-
ed alive as long as 24 hours after
the removal of the press. But
the vivisectors state that death
usually came in from 514 to 1214
hours after release from the
press. In the first experiment
reported 69 dogs were used.

In another report (Page 140-
145) the vivisectors crushed the
legs of more than 300 dogs to
check on room temperature
again, and to illuminate the.
often-discussed data (those won-
derful scientists must be terrib-

January 1947, pages 98-123.
During the first World War
doctors treating human patients
noticed a reduction in blood vol-
ume during the development of
shock. It was this observation
Which caused doctors to realize
that transfusions should be giv-
en in shock cases. However,
Gregorson and Root decided that
it would be interesting to watch
the blood volume drop in dogs
as a. result of shock. It Should
be noted that they knew at the
OUTSET that blood volume could
be expected to drop in shock
cases. Gregerson and Root were
NOT searching for a means of
shock.
NOT searching for any details

 

as to-the proper administration”

of plasma. They were NOT
seaching for a cure for anything
in particular. They were intent
merely upon shocking dogs by
means of procedure which
neither man nor dog very well
could be expected to encounter
in ordinary living.

The “surgical” part of this ex-
periment was very simple. The
dog was strapped down. He was
given a very light administration
of ether -— apparently enough to
make his struggles ineffective ——
but according to Gregerson and
Root, not enough to blot out his
sense of “feel.” To use their own
words: “Although we were able
to produce fatal shock consist-
ently in a high percentage of the
animals, we never eliminated the
element of ‘feel.”

dogs’ hind legs was removed with

Report On Poor Animals

Dr. James T. MeHorter of the
University of Vermont, spoke at
the annual meeting of the Hu—
mane Society of the United
States. Remember that we are
the Minnesota Branch of this
society.) Here are some of the
things he said:

“The National Science Teach-
ers Association, a department of
the N.E.A. published and pre—
sumably endorsed, statements by
a high school biology teacher who
had spent three months in a can-
cer research institute. The teach—
er described how various cancers-
iwere induced in mice and pro-
posed that school-age children
should ‘acquire an impersonal and
objective attitude’ towards the an-
imals used in classroom ‘re-
search.’ He said that ‘surgical
procedures are especially thrill-
ing to pupils.’ The teacher' said
. that pupils in his classrooms are
prohibited from giving names to
_ animals, be they mice, dogs or
_ cats, lest these immature boys

and girls lose their impersonal
objectivity.” .

Dr. MeHorter went on to say:
“I am profoundly concerned with

the pschological effects that this
‘ sort of public school ‘experimen-
' tation’ has on the developing
child. I am persuaded that it
will continue significantly to the
mounting incidence of mental
illness in our young people.

“The psychopathic personality
manifests these symptoms: he is
destructive, quarrelsome, sulky,
defiant, boastful, cynical, affec-
tionless, selfish, restless and
purposeless. He lacks a super-
ego or conscience, shows a gener-
al moral and ethical bluntness,
and a noticeable lack of sympathy
and affection. The pain and suf-
fering of humans and animals
do not touch him. Quite the con-
trary, his behavior is frequently
aggressively cruel. He may take
a sadistic pleasure in inflicting
pain or in seeing pain inflicted.

“The child who is conditioned _
by either parent or teacher, to in—
difference and apathy toward the
suffering of any sentient crea—
ture——taught to repress his emo-
tions, particularly love, affection
and compassion —— tends to de—
velop the psychopathic behavior-
al pattern. And I submit that
there is a cause-effect relation-
ship between impersonal, objec—
tive, emotionless behavior and
mental illess. I believe that this

could be experimentally validat—
ed.”

He said that pershaps this is
an instrumental factor in why
there are more men than women
in mental hospitals, why men die
sooner than women. Men, as the
stereotype would have it, are
supposed to be “strong,” “virile,”
“objective,” and “unemotional.”
“I suspect that it is because men
strive to assume this “masculine”
type of role that they crack up,
physically and mentally, several
years ahead of time. The human
male would be a far happier,
healthier (and may I add, an im-
measurably braver creature) if
he would simply cry more and
give vent to his integrative emo-
tions, particularly affection and;

Minneapolis 10, Minn.

I have been in New York and
hastened back to attend our first
meeting of the Animal Protec-
tive Association, Inc. This is the
society that I have told you about.
Mr. Peter C. Neilsen of Lake
Elmo, Minn., is the inspiration
,and founder of it. He has given

phone number in Lake Elmo is

ident (WAlnut 2-4977), Mar-
guerite Morrison is the secretary
(FEderal 9-3571) and Mrs. Helen
Moelter of Lake Elmo is the treas-~
urer. One of our directors is Mr.
Roy W. Larsen. There will be
others. . '

But now I want to tell a very
important thing that happened at
the meeting on Friday evening.
(It was at the Branch YMCA,
1725 University Ave., St. Paul).
About seventy people were there.
All 'of us have long been disturb-4
ed and angered by the situation
in Minnesota. Our laws against
cruelty to animals are all right
but our behavior as a state, is
lamentable. Never has one sin-
gle person been prosecuted. . Yet
cats and dogs are thrown out of
cars and abandoned. Cattle suf-
fer horribly in transit to the
slaughter houses. Dogs are stol-
en by racketeers and sold in
other states. Hundreds of dogs
and cats are sold—without men-
tion or comment to labratories

came way out here just to attend
our meeting on Friday. And now
Mr. Peter Neilsen and the rest
of us of the Animal Protective
Association are happy to say that
we have become instead the fol-
lowing: The Minnesota Branch
of the HSUS.

Fed Myers told us how HSUS
would help and strengthen us and

to become a strong, sensible, na-
tional truly humane movement.
He told us —just what has made
HSUS cohesive and integral and
vigrous for twenty years. He
told us how, in spite of the fact
that 20,000 members were against
vivisection and only 120 for it,
HSUS has been able to transcend
all energy-swallowing controver-
sy and bitterness and march for-
ward on a solid front and ac-

 

for vivisection. Dogs used for
hunting, and not wanted around
the house, are tethered Out of
doors all winter in fifteen be-
low zero weather. There are
many dreadful commercial ken-
nels like that of Jake Mennes
near Anoka. And so on.

Now there exists what is call-

ed “the Minnesota Humane So-
ciety” but it is so inactive that
it is almost moribund. Moreover]
its board and membership is
packed with doctors and medical
school veterinarians whose sec-
ondary purpose may be kind-
ness to animals but whose pri-
mary purpose is to see to it that
no “humane” society ever gets,
' out of hand so that it can exert
the slightest pressure or inter-
ference with uncontrolled labra-
tory experiments. And the Ani—
mal Rescue League sells its su-
perfluous animals to the Univer-
sity Medical school and, I am
told, can show a splendid record
of profit rather than loss. But
people and children who happily
trust in its beautiful name, “Ani-
-mal' Rescue”, don’t knew this.

Now this same hypocritical sit-
uation has overtaken the‘immense
humane societies in the East like
[the great S.P.C.A. with its en-
dowment of millions of dollars.’
It has become a procurer of a
stream of animals for the pow-
erful drug companies and medi-
cal schools and the commercial
labratories.

But there is at least one hon-
est, open and most effective hu-
mane society in the country ——
that is the Humane Society of
the United States (HSUS) with
headquarters in Washington, DC.
3,",HSUS — remember those letters
and make a note of it!) Its Ex-
ecutive Director is Mr. Fred
Myer and its Director of Organ-
ization is Mr. William O’Grady.

Now in the discouragement of
Peter Neilsen and the rest of us
about the situation in Minnesota,
we have long ago turned to
HSUS in Washington for advice.

complish a great deal.~ This is
because it has “one single under-
lying moral principle” viz: to be
against cruelty, wherever it is
found. Yes, the ‘single purpose
is to mitigate cruelty and to
wipe it out. The work is to build
into the conscience of the entire
American public the feeling and

how we, in turn, can help them'

 

knowledge that cruelty is wrong

   
   
 
   
  

and unnecessary. It is' wrong for
those who suffer from it. It is
just as wrong, as terrible, as
maiming, for those who perpe-
trate it.

Mr. O’Grady spoke and answer-
ed questions. It was then voted
that all of us at the meeting
would become members of the
Minnesota Branch of HSUS.

Of all these things I will write
in detail next week.

' Report On Poor Animals

My daughter and I have that
piercing, accurate feeling (wom—
an’s intuition which Prof. Ashley
Montague says “is the highest in-
telligence on earth”- that there
is something intrinsically noble
and grand and utterly trustwor-
thy about people who like cats.

‘ an IQ. test or an aptitude test or
' a lie test, we would just submit
7 them to a Do-you—like cats test.
7 If they pass, there is absolutely
' nothing to fear. Know that you
' are in the preesence of an honor-
‘ able, compassionate, immensely-
- talented, artistic, merry, joke-see—
' ing and heroic person.

' Conversely, a person who does
not like cats—Say your future
husband or wife—look out! Look
out particularly for those men
who say, ‘I like dogs but not cats
——they’re so sneaky —” with a
self-admiring shudder of repul-
sion. There is bound to be some-
thing ungenerous and hard-hand-
ed about him or her. Probably
the man likesdogs for his hunting
purposes (and you can hardly
say that he likes the things he
shoots) and he likes the process
of training berating and forcing
the dog.)

_ / If you watch carefully for some
time you will observe that such
people do not really like dogs,
that they don’t even like their
wives and children or those whom
they designate as “friends.” I
mean, it is not the real, true, gen-
erous living feeling of liking, that
golden, alternating current
true delight and Welcoming,
laughing affection.

Now a man may say and think
that he loves his wife or child,
but he loves them as he loves his
own hand or arm; that is to say,
it is just a kind of extended ego-
tism, of self-love. And the mo-
ment wife or child (or dog) do
not act exactly as he thinks 'fthey
should, he is in an awful temper.
_ He is astonished, unbelieving!
’ Note how such men give presents
’that they want their wives to
i have. Say that she likes books or

travel, he gives her pearls:
“These pearls, dear, wear them
—” meaning: “It shows people

I am that kind of a wonderful
fella who wants his dear little
wifeykins to be radiantly happy
with pearls.” ~

his last quiet breath, a manof

to me that “all cats are artists.”

daughter and her husband have

little fox terrier off the beach.
His owners get quite indignant
and shout, ‘Call off your cat!!’
And when Bernie and Nancy go
in for a swim, she follows them
right down to the water and
watches them anxiously until
they come out. She’ll turn around
and cry at us, —— the wind catches

Tuesday we had a meeting of
the directors of the Humane So-
ciety of the United States
(HSUS), Minnesota~Branch. Mr.
,Peter Neilsen came from Lake
' Elmo and Mrs. Helen Moelter, our

hundred feet long, are being con-
constructed in a field, and the
animal hospital, ’nearer the house,
is inhabited and. almost finished.
Dr. Gysland has”been supervis-
ing everything. He often works
there from nine o’clock in the
evening until one am. He sees
to it that there are the highest
standards as to sanitation and nu—
trition, that sick dogs are treat-
ed, that all dogs and puppies are“
wormed, given shots for distemp-
er, rabies, and that cats and dogs
are spayed ad castrated if it is
the right thing to do; for it is

' the opinion of HSUS that to con-

trol the dreadful overpopulation
of dogs and cats is the basic es-
sential way to prevent cruelty ——
the homelessness and the dread-
ful misuse of animals.

Parker Shaw has had two years
of training as a veterinarian and

 

treasurer, from Stillwater.-_ The
‘ others were Marguerite Morrison,
“Mr. Morgan Wilson and Dr. V.
‘ M. Gysland, who is our vigorous
helpful young veterinarian from
Hopkins. It was a hot night, like
molten brass.

we talked about the following:
We will soon mail a thousand
letters to you. (Hundreds of you
have been working for a. first-
rate humane society for Minne-
sota for years!) We will ask for
members at $5.00 a year. We’ll
askfor contributions and for vol—
unteers. And we will tell you of
the new Animal Adoptive Center
near Lake Elmo. ‘

This is the creation of Peter
Neilsen—the idea, the work and
the money. He’bought an 80-acre
farm with a large rambling old
farm—house on it and many barns.
He-has now remodelled the house.
It is divided into two solid good
dwellings, one for Parker Shaw
and his family (he takes care of
all the animals) and the other
for Mrs. Moelter, our treasurer.
- Already there are 110 dogs
there. This includes sick dogs,
. abandoned dogs (the word “aban-
don-ed” doesn’t give the right im-
pression —— they are beautiful
dogs), seventeen cats, Parker
- Shaw’s own private dogs, Helen
Moelter’s five dogs and her many

not think Mr.
him: anyWay he—--made'_.no com-
ment): “Pete must have put at
least seventy-five or a hundred
thousand dollarsin the place.”
Mr. Neilsen asked for a motion
stipulating that he will now turn
over the Animal Adoptive Center
entirely, to HSUS, Minnesota
Branch.

And that is why we must have
a wide, large and Vigorous mem—
bership. Remember that the na-
tional HSUS, with headquarters
in Washington, D. C., is back-
ing us with its immense member-
ship, its experience, good sense
and financial strength, and most
of all with the ability of its presi-
dent, Mr. Robert Chenoweth of
Kansas City and Fred Myers, the
Executive Secretary.

Thursday afternoon Marguer-
ite Morrison and I drove out to
the Animal Adoptive Center. This
is the way you go: Drive to St.
Paul and cross the Mississippi
River bridge. Take Highway 12
which goes to Hudson. Drive 12
miles beyond St. Paul. Then
watch for the Viking motel on
your left. Then drive on, to the
first crossroad on your right.
Turn there and drive due south
for about three miles. You will

 

come to Highway No. 95. Turn

left on Highway 95 and drive
east for a mile or two. Watch for
an octagonal barn on your right.
When you see the barn, watch
for the next farm house on your
left. That is the place. The mail-
box says: “Animal Adoptive
Center.”

At present it is in magnificent
chaos, butuse your imagination
and see how splendid it will be
presently, not only scientific and
shipshape but rural, comforting
and beautiful. There is a slop-
ing lawn with a huge ancient
tree and a long old farm-house
of that endearing architecture of
the 1880’s (“A grandma house”
I call it) with many gables and
a long wooden porch and delicate
wooden pillars and clusters of
bay windows. ’

 

But to return to the director’ S}
meeting: ‘ Dr. Gysland said (I do

tell me, “Oh no! He wouldn’t do
that! He is dying for effection.”
So we pat him and console him
and rub his ears and muzzle, to
his great happiness, and when
we move beyond the radius of

After an hour of labor, sweat
pouring out of our hair into our
eyes, we even had got a bed set
up in the\ sitting-room, avtable
beside it and even a clock plug-
ged in. At least she could sleep
that night.

Then I went out and talked to

Parker‘Shaw. He is a lean young
man with hair blacker than coal,
a handsome nose like a Norman
knight and fiery light blue eyes,
very startling that countenance of
black brows and touselled hair.
He said, yes, he is Irish —— Gael
if there ever was one! He want-
ed, me to see every dog, to pat
and feed them. (He bemoaned his
busyness: “They all need more

affection—”. He showed me “the

get ”out—e?” He fed the vicious
dog biscuits and showed me “how
you must give them‘your fingers
too, with the biscuit, then they
won’t bite you by mistake
snapping at it in their excite-
ment, you know.”.

“The vicious dog” ate biscuit
after biscuit, delicately extract-
ing each one out of a mouthful
of Parker Shaw’s fingers.

They showed me the dog that
was learning —— with the help of
Shirley and "Jan—to be friendly
and joyful. This was a hand-
some black and white farm dog.
He wagged his tale and smiled
and was délighted when they pat-

shook his paw. And then, when
small hands were withdrawn, he

 

remembered to snarl and snavel

learning years of cruelty and
maltreatment.

Parker Shaw says that already
pEople are leaving dogs .and'kite
tens out in front by the mail-
box—alas; people without much 7.
character, apparently.

Now if youuhave a sick or aban-i
doned cat or dog or one that you;
must. give up, go to the Animal
Adoptive Center and, like a per-
son of honor and responsibility, .
give it to Parker Shaw and Mrs. *
Moelter. And talk to them fora '
little while. And then, like a.
gentleman (male or female). be-

come a member of HSUS Minne- t

On Friday we went, to a hear»
ing at the Capitol on the Senate
bill, SF .1171. This is to pass a
law insisting that. commercial
dog kennels be licensed and
obey humane regulations. I
have told you about. the terrible

iO’Malley kennels at LeCenter,

 

 

tended the hearing were pre-
pared. to give reports. To name
a few of us: Olav Wallo, Mrs.
Aaron Moses, Dr. Gysland, the
veterinarian, Mrs. W’alker Wil—
t liams, Mrs. Rose Albrecht, Jenm
; ny A. Johnsen, Mrs. Peter Neil~

 

sen. Peter Neilsen who is the
president of the iV'lII'IDESOiLa

Branch, HSUS was ill and could
not be there.

At. the hearing such a heart.—
e'ning thing happened! Senator
D C. J. Benson, a quiet, blond man
from. Ortonville, spoke up. He
described the cruelty, the offen-
siveness, the filthiness, t he
crookedness of commercial dog
kennels in. his own countryside.
The dog—racketeers will give a
dollar to anyone (it. is
stricken Indians) who bring in
a dog. The dogs, of course, are
strays, starving, stolen. These
commercial. kennels then adver~
tise in newspapers in large
Eastern cities, offering trained
dogs of many varieties—wshep--
herd. dogs, mink dogs, hunting
dogs. The Eastern buyers send
money. The dogs are shipped.
Needless to say the buyers are
outrageously cheated. But, far
more important~~~~ imagine the
fate of the poor dogs. i

We earnestly hope that
bill. will be passed. You can
write to Senator Donald Sinm
Clair {chairman of the commit~
tee) or to your legislators. The
; bill is SF 1.171. W’e also hope to

the

 

necessary humane bills: HF
936, HF 9:337 and HF 99].. For
this “purpose Marguerite Mori-
son. of Pet: Haven, Inc. has writ--
ten, all the legislators the fol-
lowing:
'Yr ,. .

“Gentlen’ien: The humai‘ie
cause is Constai’itly bombarded.
by the animal research men.
They are still trying to have
you. believe that. any and. all
who do not. believe exactly as

pots.” Read the enclosed. Views

imented. on tens of thousand of
animals. It did not harm the
animals. Then they passed out
pills by the millions rrrrr at a
splendid profit~—~-~-to people who
took them. Ten thousand mal—
formed babies were born!

“As to the good of mankind,”
‘ she says, “they, the vivisectiom
ists tell you a lot about this.

And we have not. even touched
upon ANIMAL agony, just hu—
man agony.

“How much of the vaunted
‘good of mankind’ will it take
to offset this one little mistake
of the animal researchers? How
many OTHER such tragedies
have there been, of. which the
public knows nothing. or which

“Our Society,Pet Haven, Inc.
of Minnesota, has" a credo as
simple as the Golden Rule. It. is:
Any ethical, any WHOLE per—
son protects NATURALLY that
which is small or weaker than
he, be it child, an. aged person
or an animal. When anyone or
any body of men gets so power-
ful, so callous that they forget
or belittle-weven for one second
-~-1f'€V€I‘€nC8 for the life of any
living thing, then take care to
be watchful. Would you turn
your loved ones over, in illness,
to an uncompassionate person? 4
Remember compassion has no
dollar sign, no angles. It, is
there or it is non—existent.”

Now, she says, and I say, let
us tell you. what three great
medical scientists say about Vi-
visection. First Dr. Arthur V.
Allen, chief surgeon of th e
Commonwealth Edison Com~
pany, a former professor in the
Illinois Graduate S c h o 01 of
Medicine:

“Few persons seem to realize
that yivisection is a business.
Men enter this business for the
same reason they enter any
other business: to make money
and. to further their own in-
terests. It is not only the large

 

laboratories, or the fees for
testing various products that.
make this business attractive;
it, is also the publicit.y~mthe
self-advertising through news~
paper stories, magazine articles
and radio talks. Without this
publicity, stemming d i r e c t l y
from yivisectionai experiments,
a well-known vivisector
would have remained engulfed

and financial mediocrity.”

Dr. Robert Gesell was chair~
man of the department. of Phy«
sioiogy at the University of
Michigan. He said: “We are.
drowning and suffocating un—
ai'iaesthetized animals-~«—~~-in. the
name of science. We are deter-.
mining the amount of abuse
that life will endure in. unan~

science. With the aid of the halo
supplied by the faith of the
American p e op 1 e in medical
Science, the National Society
for Medical Research converts
sanctuaries of mercy into ani-
mal pounds at the beck and call
of experimental laboratories,
regardless of how the animals
are to be used. What a travesty
of humanity! This may well
prove to be the blackest spot in
the history of medical science.”
Let me call your attention
here to the Animal Rescue
League of Minneapolis. It sends
its unclaimed animals to the
University for vivisection. A
monstrous law passed a few
years ago allows them to do
his. If you don’t like it don’t
llow them to capture your ani-
. anal. And by all means, rescue
“it from. the Animal Rescue
iLeague—although it will cost
you a good deal of money. (In
my case, $14.) Moreover, do not
support th e Animal Rescue
League w i t h benevolently-in—
tended money. Rather join Pet
Haven, Inc. (I am glad to say
that at the annual meeting the
other evening I received the
great honor of being elected
vice—president.)
This is what Dr. Henry J.
Bigelow said, professor of sur-
gery at H a r v a r d Medical
School: “There will come a time

mals, uselessness to man, and
obstruction on the path of real
knowledge.”

So much for the passionate
beliefs of great doctors. Now I
will. add .what three laymen
‘have said:

George Arliss: “The cure of
human ailments is being re-
tarded and the human body is
being vitiated by the poison
‘ arising from animal experimen-
tations. If you doubt this, I
would ask you to think whether
. it seems possible that God ever
intended that animals be tor-
tured in order that we might be
cured of disease. If I believe
that, I could have no religion at
all. I certainly would not wor-
ship such a God.”

George Bernard Shaw: “The

 
 

  

   
 

 

natural abhorrence of sane
mankind for the vivisector’s
cruelty, and the contempt of

able thinkers for his imbecile

by the most popular spokesmen
of humanity. If the medical pro-
fession were to outdo the anti-
vivisection societies in a gen—
eral professional protest
against the practice and prin-
ciples of vivisectors, every doc-

substantially by the immense
relief and reconciliation which
would follow such a reassur-
ance of the humanity of the
doctor . . . Atrocities are not
less atrocities when they occur
in laboratories and are called
medcial research.”

And Mahatma Gandhi said:
“Vivisection, in my opinion, is
the blackest of all black crimes
that man is at present commit-
ting against God and His fair "'
creation. It ill becomes us to in-
voke in our daily prayers the
blessings of God, the Compas-
sionate, if we in turn will not
practice elementary compassion
towards our fellow creatures.”

sky, the airplane’s yellow light
blazed like an en01mous star,
“making the rash gazer, wipe his
, eye.’ I thought: “It’s like an
Archangel coming down!”

As for the Board meeting, Peter‘

Neilsen of Lake Elmo (that kind—
hearted man beyond compare) is
the president. His wife Hazel
Neilsen (equally kind-hearted),
Mrs. Aaron Moses (blazing eyes,
excellent intellect), Miss Pat Kil-
‘day' (handsome and a lawyer),
.and several others are working
'on the. newly revised Criminal
. Code relating to cruelty to ani—
' mals. I will tell more of this later

. on.

The hundreds and hundreds of
wild ducks on Lake Harriet have
sailed away. It is really a miracu-
lous sight. They come in great
flying clouds and more of them
’ every year, and they stay happily
-—'—fed by faithful neighbors—un-
til the last: watery inch of the lake

, has frozen solid. Now all summer

_ long I have talked to the most
endearing little group of them,
a little “bunch,” a “clique.” of
' four wild mallards and four white
' domsetic ducks. These eight have
stayed together (all happily mar-
ried couples) in a sociable, inti—
mate bunch, mildly disdaining the
‘ crowds of wild ducks. I have wat-
. ched them every. morning. They
circle tog-ether near shore, cozily
quacking to each other, as soci—
able and affectionate as four sub-
urban couples, enough for two
bridges tables.

I have worried about them be-
cause though the malllards can
' pack their suitcases and go south
at any time, the four domestic
ducks, large and white, cannot.
They can’t fly. They get air sick.
About three weeks ago I was

walking there early in the morn—

ing and I saw a large, tall man in
a huge ovel'coat feeding them. I
went over to talk to him and to
say that We should both implore
the Park Board to pick up the
white ducks and take good care
‘ of them in the winter.

He is flying to India this month
for a few weeks to see the Mas-
ter. Perhaps I can tell more about

’Colonel Berg when he returns.

The annual meeting of scien—
tists at Philiadelphia noted that
the primitive mental trait called
“denial” has caused Americans
to erase from their minds the
threat of nuclear obliteration.
They know it is true but they

 

 

just won’t think about it. Also,
they just do not think about vi- '
visection. *

Now here is an item. I wish I ‘
could say there was news in it. ’
There is no news in it at all be-
cause it is as universal, as every
day, as commonplace as falling
snow in a snow storm. Multiply
it by——say~—three million.

It is entitled A Study In Im-
mobilsation. (American Journal
of Physiology, Jan. 1961.) “This
was an interesting experiment us—
ing the combination of stimula—
tion with physical restraint on un- l
anesthetized cats. The first ani-
mals were'restrained by means of
a wide leather collar. This method
was unadequate since some head
movement was possible, and also
because struggling soon commenc-
ed and prevented adequate re-
cording. Plaster casts were indi-
vidually fitted for all succeeding
cats. The plaster casts were cut
along the midline to provide two
,close-fitting shells and, prior to
each testing, the animals were
placed in the casts. Infrequently,
a brief period of anesthesia was
required for re-casting untamed
cats. Cats in this eXperiment as—
sume a sleeplike state and arousal
is difficult to maintain. The ap-
plication of shocks through the
series of trials should have in-
sured arousal but did not. Severe
measures are taken to maintain
arousal”'

In addition to the above proce-
dure, these cats also had had sets
of electrodes implanted in their
heads and were being rotated in
the dark. Having both hind legs

Report On Poor Animals

One of the monstrous problems
in the United States is how to cur—
tail money-making when it does
harm. This is something that po-
' litical candidates cannot debate
or even mention. Because money-
' making is holy. Now words like
“freedom”, “free enterpriSe,”
are beautiful and sometimes refer
to beautiful and precious things
3 in our country. But they also in-
clude enormous forces that do
horrible, steady, insidious, con—
tinuing harm to millions of peo-
ple.

Russia from the stand-point of
' anti-tobacco education, is a few
sputniks ahead. An official medi-
cal mission from our U. S. Pub-
lic Health Service reports that
there is no commercial advertis-
ing of tobacco and smoking in
the USSR and the Ministry of
Health in that country warns peo-
ple: “It is fully clear that smok-
ing is more than a mere anti-
hygienic habit—it is a dangerous
form of chronic poisoning of the
system which can lead to serious
things.”

And it is not only with regard
to smoking that Russia is getting
ahead. Due to a government cam-
paign, the consumption of vodka
was greatly reduced. In 1958 the
Russian people bought 29,832,000
fewer gallons than in 1957.
Drunkeness has become, by leg-
islation, a crime against the state.
The law says the following very
sensible thing to everybody. “The
liquidation of such a survival of
the past as drunkeness will facil-
‘itate the improvement of the
health of the people, strengthen
family life, and improve public
manners.”

All this is showing up in their
, longevity. The number of deaths
. per thousand in Russia in 1958
was 7.2. In the United States it
was 9.2. We are dying at a rate
of 32 per cent higher than the
Russians.

Of course the arguments most
often presented against drinking
and smoking, to wit, that they
shorten life, are the least import-
ant ones. The point is that we
should try to be alive when we
are alive, and not self-indulgent-
ly stumble along in a state of
sickish irritability, with a great
handicapped imagination and in-
telligence (alcohol and tobacco
does that), so that all the hours
of your life you can express your-
self as you should—at your lofti-
est, bravest, kindest and best.

Mr. Clarence E. Richard, that
alert and forceful man! says that
the International Anti-Vivisec-
tion Society of Chicago has is-
sued leaflets entitled: “FEDER-
AL GRANTS AND THE AMERI-
CAN TAXPAYER: SOME EX-
PENSIVE FEEDERS AT THE
PUBLIC TROUGH.” These let-
ters tell how medical research
has cost American taxpayers well
over a quarter of a billion dol-
lars in one year (1959) and then
go on to detail cruel and futile
experiments in all parts of the
country. They tell the amounts1
granted to researchers, one of ‘
whom received the incredible sum;
of $509,070 in the 6-year period?
from 1954 to 1959. His project?‘
Smog in Los Angeles. The result
of all this time and money?
“Nothing definite,” the solemn
answer is of the researcher.

I saw another photograph the
other day. It is a picture of an
endless line of white rabbits ex-
tending indefinitely. Each fluffy
poor little rabbit is clamped down

to his body. They are arranged
(“scientifically”) about 2 inches
apart, like piano keys, all heads
pointing in one direction for the
convenience of those efficiency
fiends, the researchers.

It seems that there is a new
cosmetic that paints tan on your
skin even if you never have the
gumption to go out-of—doors. It ,
is very popular and enormously
advertised. It is for men and
women. And the U. S. Food and
Drug Administration, you know, .
insists that every new cosmetic
like that (containing coal tar and.

 

other things ahﬁ”""t)‘fiiET‘rmﬁftil'%€~-r

causing) must be proved by the
company to be fairly harmless.
BUT—the irony is—under the
present law, the company only has
to prove it AFTER the cosmetic
has been freely used by the public,
and not before.

So they are testing this fake
tan on the rabbits. Some of the
rabbits are clamped down for only
a month or two, some for six
months, some until they are dead.
Some receive faint, diluted doses
of the cosmetic; some receive
powerful caustic doses of it, just
to see what happens. Yes, all
that endless suffering for voice-
less little rabbits in immeasur-
able numbers, for the fool peo-
ple who want to look tanned and
healthy without being so. Free
enterprise! Money—making is holy.

 

“We must strive in our think-
ing,” wrote Dr. Albert Schweit-
zer, “to bring out the inner na-
ture of the ethical. We come in
this way to define this ethic as
devotion to life, which is inspir-
ed by reverence for life. Though
the phrase, reverence for life,
may sound so general as to be
rather lifeless, nonetheless its
meaning is something that never
leaves a man into whose thought
it has once penetrated. Sympa—
thy and love and in genelfaLEEQI’Xa
precious enthusiasm are contain-
ed Within it. With an unresting,
vital force, reverence for life
works upon the mind it has en-
tered and throws it into the dis-
quietude of a response which
never ceases. Reverence for life
drives a man as a churning screwI
drives a ship through water. '

“The world is a cruel drama
of the will-to—live divided against
itself. One existence prevails at
the expense of another; one de-
stroys another. One will-to—live
merely exerts its will against an-
other, without being conscious of
other wills-to-live. A longing to
attain unity within itself and to
become universal is not found
in it. . . . 5

“There is no answer to these
questions. It remains an enigma
to me for I must live with rever-
ence for life in a world ruled by p
a creative will which is at the

by a destructive will which is at -
the same time a creative Will. I
cannot do otherwise than cling to

the division of life within itself ‘
is removed. When I rescue an in-
sect from the puddle, then life
has given itself to life, and the
division of life within itself has ‘
ceased. When my life devotes it-
self to another life in any way '
whatever, my finite will-to-live
communes with the infinite will
in which all life is one. I find

Report On Poor Animals

Now is the time of year when
there appear in the newspapers
adulatory photographs of men
with rifles, holding up dead ani—
mals and birds. There was one
in the Tribune the other day of
a youngish doctor, a handsome
man with a hard eye, and around
him were these dead bears and
two deer and a moose. His hard
eyes glinted self-admiration. He
had done it all with arrows, and
these cause a. pecularly prolong-
ed cruel death. I would tell you
the doctor’s full name it begins
with H -- but I find,\there is a
Dr. William A. H. i in the
classified directory, and also a
Dr. William B. H , so I don’t
know: which one it is. I should
think that if you are sick or have
a sick child, he would be the one
doctor especially to avoid. Un-
compassionateness cancels out
that most delicate, subtle magi-
cal of all gifts, that divine sixth
sense, the ability to save, to heal,
,to bless.

In the old days so many doc-
tors seemed to have it. Indeed,
it was what pulled them into that
once most difficult, self-sacrific-
ing, generous, tender arduous pro-
fession. There has been a deteri-
oration, I really believe. I think
it may be due to the ocean of Vivi-
section that they snuff up and
breathe for seven years of medi-
cal education. And another rea-
son may be that the profession
has stream-lined itself (by means
of the American Medical Associa-
, q- Laintg '9‘ Manama:
tlonal and tremendously profit-
able affair, regarded with an
almost holy awe by the poor pub-
lic. Another thing: except for
public health officials, there is
among doctors almost no inter-
est in how to prevent sickness

. (except by shots -— “ten dollars”)
. and how to attain exuberant
health, which is quite possible.
This is inevitable, even among
the most well-intended and hon-
est men, because of the fact that
the more sick patients there are,
the better the doctor’s income.
Just consider what would happen
if all judges incomes increased
with every verdict of guilty. I’m
afraid there would bean awful
lot of hangings.

 

 

 

  
  
 
 
 
 
   
   

 

 

I heard the other day of a lady
who wanted to buy a new house
and the real estate agent found
one that she liked tremendously.
But when they explored around
in the back yard, on the garbage
pail there was a little bear cub,
recently shot. “I won’t buy this
house!” said the lady. “No.
Don’t talk about it! Imagine the
horrible people who live here!
Who would kill a little bear to
throw in the garbage?”

 

 

I often think of What Laurits
I'usten used to say. “The Hindus

ay :' ‘Those who love cats will
e rewarded: they’ll get more
ats.”’ "

This reminds me of 'what my
caughter said when she was ten.
omeone had told her of the
heory of Reincarnation of the
ransmigration of souls after
death. She was delighted with
the idea; She felt in her very
bones that it must be true “Oh,
good! After I die I can become
a Scotty!”

Laurits Rusten also told me
that the Hindus believe that if
an animal loves its owner very
much, after death it may make
the jump and become a human
being. I often think of that.

Report On Poor Animals

Our Humaane Society of the
United States (HSUS) has won
the first round against a terrible,
invisible and fashionable cruel-
ty. You know what a Tennessee
_ Walking Horse is. You see them
. in all the horseshows—beautiful

manes, who prance and go send-
ding around the ring, with blow-
ing red nostrils and champing
foamy bits, their arched tails

violent hooves very high, almost
to their eyes, in a nervous earth-
Spurning tread. The American
Horse Shows Association spon-
sors exhibitions of Tennessee
. Walking Horses and awards rib-
bons and cash prizes to the high-
est steppers. The owners are us-
ually very rich people.

Now orginally the horses’ beau-
tiful cavorting was attained by
breeding them for it, but that
takes a long long time. So they
have discovered a quicker way
to get the hooves in the air. The
front parts of horses’ hooves are
sensitive. Tacks are driven in
there. The poor horse then—in
exquisite anguish ——- will try to
walk without touching the ground
at all! This gives him that splen-
did high-stepping prize-winning
gait. Another way is to blister
the horse’s hooves with a mercury
ointment. These festering blisters
also make the horse dance beauti-
fully. And some ingenious train-

from the United States. . .”

Well Mrs. Stevens has been
sending me all the reasons for
her passionate belief in the bill.
Out of admiration for her, and
gratitude for her work, I have
longed to blow a golden bugle
for the bill. But there has also
come earnest material from the
HSUS office in Washington, D.C.,
from Mr. Clarence E. Richard of
Chicago, and others, and from
many societies in England who
think the bill is a mistake. They
give their reasons. I am afraid
I have to agree with them.

The humanitarians in England
say that just such a bill became
a law in Englannd in the 19th

HSUS ha? been fightmg this thinking that the problem has
for a long tlme but it IS not easy, been legally tended to: __ “0114
for “big money”, and fashion, and that’s good! Now there is a law
calloused familiarity, are all on against cruelty in experiments!
the side of the horse show peo- They get anaesthetics”. And so

 

ple. The HSUS managed to get
a conviction in a case in Lynch-
burg, Va., in May this year, but
the fine paid by the horse’s own-
er——-a very rich man—was $25.00.
(Never mind. We will persevere.)

Earlier this year there was a
show in Texas. One Tennessee
Walking Horse was so maddened
with pain that he had to be led
from his stall by two grooms in
front, pulling his bridle, and
three grooms behind, lashing him
with riding crops. Our agents
tried to inspect the horse but
were told to get a search-warrant.
By the time that could be done,
the evidence was well concealed.

 

 

There is a wonderful, gener-
ous, kind-hearted woman in New
York, Mrs. Christine Stevens. She
is the head of the ANIMAL WEL-
FARE INSTITUTE. I am told
that her father was a world-fam- .
ous surgeon who had been deep-
ly troubled all his life by the:
terrible fact of vivisection, held
‘to be so absOlutely essential (I
don’t agree) in medical educa-
tion and research; and to ease-
his deep unhappiness about it, he
lspent his life and fortune to miti-
gate the sufferings of animals.
His daughter, Christine Stevens
continues his work. Recently she
has sponsored a new organzation,
the SOCIETY FOR ANIMAL
PROTECTIVE LEGISLATION. It
has drafted a bill and Senator
Cooper of Kentucky has introduc-
ed the bill (S. 3570) in the Sen-.
ate. The purpose of the bill “is
to provide the humane treatment
of animals used in experiment and
tests by those who receive grants

on. (Thousands of the experi-
ments are to see how much cruelty
an animal can endure.) '

Now the HSUS (we are the '
Minnesota Branch( is opposed to

sons. Here is what our president
Mr. R. J. Chenoweth of Kansas
City; writes:

“ . . . The HSUS holds that
cruelty is immoral, regardless of
the pretext for it. . . . The funda-
mental HSUS policy is to oppose
and to seek to prevent all uses
of animals that cause pain, suf-
fering and fear. . . . “The practi-
cal application of these principles
is that the HSUS would support
S. 3570 if the law actually would
prevent or decrease cruelty and _
suffering, but the bill does not

satisfy these requirements. '

. The HSUS is aggressively

fighting cruelty in research lab-

ratories. This Society has spent

tens of thousands of dollars in

the last three years on investiga-

tions behind the ‘iron curtain’

that is fiercely guarded by most

labratories where animals are

used, on court action against

labratories, and on educational

activities designed to give the

facts to the public. . . . It is

largely our experience that S.

3570 would be an ineffectual law

and might even PROTECT those

who are guilty of cruelty rather

than CONTROL them.”

Then he tells how the state of

California “where the HSUS kept

an investigator inside labratories

for many weeks and is prosecut-

ing two medical schools, has a law
designed to protect labratory ani-
mals that is in many respects,:
stronger than S. 3570. Yet, al-
though it has been a law for-ten
years, it NEVER HAS BEEN EN-
FORCED. The law never has
saved a single animal from suf—
fering. The fatal flaw is that en-
forcement is the responsibility
solely of the California Depart-
ment of Heatlh. This is headed,
' of course, and controlled by men
who are the allies of the labrator-

Even granting that they are hon-

abide by the law, they are all.

as ‘normal’ and unobjectionable.

the California law. In practice
it would place all of the enforce-
ment machinery in the hands of
the animal-using workers.

“Such laws can and do PRO-

ate to assure the public that an-
imals are being protected from
cruelty. The assurance is false
but the laws make ordinary anti-
cruelty prosecution virtually im-
possible. S. 3570, in our opinion,
would have the same effect.”

And Mr. Clarence E. Richards
’ writes me the following: “At-
tempts to cure the evils of Vivi.-
section by legislation are nothing
new. Twenty-nine years ago the
same scheme reared its ugly head
———and we fought it —— success-
fully. Here is a cablegram dated

world’s greatest thinkers and

Report On Poor Animals

You remember that I told you
some time ago about the appall-
ing commercial kennels of Jake
Mennes in Anoka county: Some-
thing has happened and things
may improve. In Blaine Village,
where the Mennes Kennels are,
the Mayor, Mr. Bernstein and
his councilmen have become dis-
turbed about it and want a better
reputation for the community, so
they had a meeting Friday night.
About fifteen of our Minnesota
Humane Society members
(HSUS) were there, among them
Peter Neilsen, our president,
Marguerite Morrison, our secre-
tary, Dr. V. M. Gysland, the vet-
erinarian, Mrs. Esther Fros-
heiser (she had bought poor
starved diseased dogs from the
Mennes kennels), Dick Fudali and
many others. Jake Mennes was
present also and spoke only once,
bitterly: “I am ‘the gentleman’
you have been talking about -——-
if I am a gentleman.” He then
left. '

The new situation is that a
veterinarian (whose name I do
not know at present) has bought
the Mennes kennels. He also spoke
earnestly and said that he has
instituted reforms and promises
more.

Peter Neilsen spoke to Mayor
Bernstein and the councilmen
earnestly, and with his absolute—
ly transcendental kindness, about
the situation and told how we
can improve the lot of animals
in this state. The young lawyer,
Dick Fudali, also spoke. He has
, just graduated from law school
. and now begins his practice in
St. Anthony Village. He is now
a member of HSUS and is very
very helpful.

In this connection I must tell
you an interesting thing and you
. may find it useful later on.
Marguerite Morrison, our secre~
tary (she lives at 2209 Harriet
,_ Ave., Minneapolis, and her tele-
phone is (FEderal 9-3571) has
for many months been following
up all those people who advertise
in the daily newspapers that they
have lost or found animals, or
that they have a pet to give away.
1 In this way she has not only dis-
covered scores of sympathetic
pe0ple who not only like animals
but who care very much about
what happens to them. And she
. has discovered interesting things, 1
i.e. that so many animals are‘
permanently lost in Northeast
' Minneapolis, that it may mean
there is a dog-stealing racket
working there.

And she has, in this way, found
new members for HSUS. Mr.
Fudali is one of them. One of
the useful things that Miss Mor-
rison is able to do is to tell these
people that the Animal Rescue
League sells cats and dogs to the
University and hospitals for vivi-
section. (Few people seem to
know this.) And she is able to
tell these people who advertisg
that they want to give away a
pet to surely investigate prospec-
tive owners thoroughly. For there
are people who sell animals to
the University and hospitals, and
there are people who will use a
dog for hunting and, when the
season is over, abandon or kill
him. The usual procedure is to
‘drive out of town and throw the
dog overboard. Sometimes we
find them with their legs broken.

rewarded: they will get more
cats.” I wrote that last week and
sure enough it happened: I have
another cat. Now I have a dear
and an especial friend, Bruce
Colin, who is ten years old. Last
summer he and I were co-own-
ers of Fluffums (he named the
inexpressibly charming gold-and-
white kitten). This is how it hap- .
pened: Jenny Johnsen and I
rescued Fluffums from the Ani-
mal Rescue League (we formed

ground Kitty Railway Station”).
But this was our predicament.

because she is away from home
all day and much of the evening
and she has an especially sav-
age cruel neighbor, who killed her
other cat and another old-man
neighbor who likes to set traps
illegally. And Bruce could not
keep Fluffums because there are
six small children in his family
and it is just to hard for his
mother. Then, I found that I
couldn’t keep Fluffums because.
my neighbors, two sisters, threat-
en to give him to the Animal
Rescue League if he wanders on
their yard and threatens to eat
a bird. (Immediately after this
threat Miss X went into her'
house because, as she said, they
were having chicken for dinner.)
Well of course we found a fine
home for the kitten. . Bruce comes
over very few days —— “How’s
Fluffums?” — to get a report.
One morning last week, it was
the day the teachers were at the
M.E.A. convention, the doorbell
rang and there in that diamond
sunlight, was Bruce and his
younger brother, Charlie. Bruce
carried a half—grown cat —- a Pic-
ture Book kitty—black and white,
with mittens. A deserted, starv- _
ing frightened little cat, Bruce
said. So we fed him parboiled
kidney and milk. Bruce named
him Pun’kins and he immediately
became one of the nicest, friend-
liest, cutest cats you ever saw,
his happy motor always going,
stretching out in the rectangle '
of sunlight on the floor like a
lion.

When I told Marguerite Morri-
son, she said: “Wait —— let me
look up my cross references. Yes,
there are three black-and-white
cats lost, but they are all in
North Minneapolis.” You see? I
could find Pun’kins a good home
immediately. But already I am
too desperately fond of him to
part with him. Just as the winter
sunlight transfigures a house,
and as some Bach or Mozart on
the piano suddenly makes even
the furniture look prettier, as the
smell of soap and fresh bread
does wonders for a house, even
more than all that a cat makes
it almost celestially cozy and
charming. And winter is coming

there remains entirely undimin

Report On Poor Animals

Records of Vivisection. I will
quote a few from the scientific
journals and then if readers will
multiply these by tens of mil-
lion-s he will see what our pres-
ent world is really like. I will not
speak of the cats and’dogs and -
horses now, and monkeys, but go
to the lowly and much hated rats
and mice. A lethal amount of
drug or poison is measured in
“LB units” or the amount need-
ed to produce death in experi-
mental animals. LD is a lethal
dose. LD 50‘ is the symbol that
stands for a dose which kills 50
percent of the animals. These
units are used to compute the safe
or unsafe amounts of the mater-
ial in question for humans. The
method has been questioned as to
accuracy. Nevertheless it is the
method used.

Another method of evaluating
drugs seems even more primitive
and unspecific. In this method
the intensity of pain is measured
by the number of “writhes” of
rats and mice (and other animals
also.) I

A pain procuring drug is given
to the animals and the writhing
,begins. In an article from the
3Schering Drug C orporation,
Brookfield, N. J., this writhing 1
from pain i described as follows:
“The endpoint, indicating pain, is '
a distinct severe contracting of
the abdominal musculature, ac-
companied by writhing of the
bodv and backward extension of
the hind limbs.”

The Miles—Ames Research
Labratories of Elkhart, Indiana,
describe the animal writhing in
pain as follows: “The pattern
of the. symptoms are: (1) inward
rotating of one foot with turn-
ing twisting of the hips; ('2)
r ~ immiihe belly, (3) elon-
gation of the body, (4) arching
ofthe back, (5) turning.” Rats”;
guinea pigs, cats and dogs were
used in this test. Reaction in all!
was somewhat different. Rats
and guinea pigs writhed and suf-
fered in silence. Cats and dogs\
cried out from the pain.

These experimentors removed‘.
parts of the brain and injuredi
other areas in rats; cut nerves,
transected the spine, and remov-
ed the stomach and intestines—
all in an effort to see just What
makes an animal writhe.

The Dow Chemical Company of

Midland, Mich., writes that their
experimenters found that not only
individual rats differ in the re-
~ actions to pain and drugs to re-
lieve it, but that rats from dif-
ferent colonies differed. Some
rats refused to writhe at all.
IThese investigators d e c i d e d,
'though, that in spite of its “lack
of specificity” the “Writhing
test” might “still be useful.”
‘ From Purdue University an ac-
count of starving rats is publish-
ed, written by V. H. Denenberg
and Robert D. Myers. Rats were
taught to press a bar to obtain
a daily ration of food. After in- - ‘
jection of drugs to make the thy-
roid gland hyperactive, and other
drugs which had the opposite ef-
fect, some of the animals were
tested in a starvation experiment
too see what motivated their ac—
tivity in bar pressing — thy—
roid glands or the desire for food,
called the “hunger drive.” The
experiments were continued with
15 minutes testing every day un—
til all the rats had died of star-
vation. The first death was on the
eleventh day.

At Harvard Phillip Teitel—
baum and David Williams surgi-
cally injured the hypothalmic
area of the brain in rats. They
chose the area which controlled
appetite and thirst and the result
was that the animals so injured
would not eat nor drink. The
authors state that this fact was
well known and had been demon-
strated in experiments before.
They found that a certain kind
of liquid diet was sometimes
eaten, or drunk. However when
returned to ordinary food and
water diet they refused to touch
it and “they lost weight steadily
and starved to death.” Survival
time: “from seven to ten days.”

Even when injected with saline
solution which dehydrated their
bodies and which ordinarily pro-

vokes an insatiable thirst, the
rats would" not drink. When

of strong electric shocks, they
still refused to eat and drink
when returned to the cage for
the labratory chow and water
available. The “starvation syn—
drome was unchanged and they
starved to death.” (These records
are all published in solemn
physiological and medical jour-
nals.) '

There is an account of starv—
ing rats from the Research In-
stitute of the Jewish Hospital of
St. Louis in c00peration with
Washington University. 196 rats
were used. The abdomen was
opened and the viscera taken out
of the body for one hour, then
put back and the wound closed.
Then the rats were fed nothing
but sugar cubes till death. Sur-
vival time—113 to 126 days.

From the U. S. Radiological
Defense Labratory, San Fran-
cisco, experiments described by
John Garcia and Donald K.
Kimeldorf. They blinded rats by
removing their eyes totally. Not
content with this horrible multi—
lation, these men irradiated the
rats also. Some seeing animals
were irradiated also. The authors
wanted to see which animals, the
blind or the seeing, drank the
most saccarine flavored water be-
fore and after radiation sickness.
The blind rats drank more sweet—
ened water than other rats and
it was thought to be a kind of
compensatory action—to recom—
pene themselves in some way for
being blind. After irradiation had
made them sick, the blind rats
drank less for a while, associat-
ing the saccharine flavor. with
the experience of the radiation
sickness.

Under a grant from the US.
Government Public H e a l t h
Service (and financed by every
one of us whether we like it or
not) Syracuse University experi-
mented with blind rats also. I
take the following from publish-
ed accounts: The eyes of the
rats were surgically excised 40
days before the beginning of the
experiment. Then the rats had
to learn to grope their way
through an elevated maze in or-
der to get a drink (after long
water deprivation.)

Once they had learned this
lesson they were given strong,
painful electric
convulsiOns for "10 days. This,
the authors found, “almost com-
pletely disrupted the learnning
of the 14-unit maze.”

In order to continue his exper-
iments one of the authors, M.
Wayner, was granted $13,282.00
for the year 1959. (From the
official records of the U. S.
Health Department.)

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This starts up meditations in
one. Now so many rationalistic,
“scientific” and anti-religion
people (like. Mark Twain and
others) take pleasure in pointing
out the cruelties of God and
Jehovah. They point out the
cruelty of Nature to people and
animals, in (excusing their own)
the latter all coming to violent
deaths. “If God is omnipoteent
as well as merciful, why doesn’t
He stop it?” is their argument.

But in view of the above ac—
count of what is happening all
the time to a billion animals, how
merciful and kind is Nature
and/or God, in taking us over
the boundary from Life to
Death! Even a lion killing a
zebra is fairly quick and merci-
ful; and indeed Death itself may
not be a hard thing after all, for
we really do not know.

But observe what our “scien—
tists”——-learned, admired, honor-

A doctor, a friend, and his wife
came to dinner the other night.
We talked of the American Medi-
cal Association’s strenuous and
grotesque objections to Presi-
dent Kennedy’s Medicare bill. And
we marvelled at it. “Why, for
Heaven’s sakes, do they take on
like that?” The doctor agreed
with us and went on to say:

“It’s a funny thing ——- the med-
ical profession now. Take X ——
Hospital in St. Paul. There are
300 beds and there are always in
those beds 200 people who
shouldn’t be there, who aren’t
sick. They are in there because
they think they are sick, or their
doctors tell them they are sick,
or for tests, Observations, check—
ups, rest cures and such things.
-HOW can I say such a thing?
Well during the Holidays only a
hundred people are left in the
hospital. Now THEY are really
sick, aren’t they? But the 200
others who go home fer the Holi-

days. cannot, be really Sick, can.

they?

“So I say to the Staff: Why
don’t you discourage people from
being sick, admonish them to cut
it out. Then you could reduce the
cost of Blue Cross (they are all
using Blue Cross of course and
the doctors are making money
out of iti so thousands of poor
people could really afford it’.”

Encouraged by our fascinated
attention, the doctor went on:
“Some of the doctors— Well now
let me just tell you of two pa-
tients of mine who have come to
me recently. One is a 35—year-
old woman who had a coronary.
Her doctor had told her so. Well
she didn’t have a coronary. No
35—year-old woman has a coron-
ary. A man, yes, —— a man of 35
can have a coronary but not a
woman. She had just been in the
hospital for two months (Blue
Cross) and she was kept from
working for a year and more. And
think of it! This doctor gave her
an x—ray examination every week
for more than a year. Now that’s
dangerous! “—a speculative look
came into his blue eye and he
said, as though to himself: “Why
she could bring suit against him
for all those x—rays! Very dan-
gerous. Very harmful you know.

“And he went on: “But as a
matter of fact I don’t think he
gave her the x-rays—” That is
to say, he ,just pressed a button
and made the burring noise and
there were. no dangerous rays at
all. “He probably pretended it
was x-ray and charged her for it,
of course. ’

“Then there is another patient
of mine,” he said. “She had been
in an automobile accident. Oh
two years ago, and. had jerked her
neck and her doctor had been
treating her for the injured neck
for all that time. She was told
not to work and so she didn’t —-
no wage—earning for all that time.
She needed to work too. Well,
there was nothing wrong with
her neck. I said to her, ‘What’s
wrong with it? ‘Well there is a
lump,’ she said putting her hand
at the back other neck. Well,
everyone’s got a bump there. I’ve

, got one there. You’ve got a bump

there. This poor girl —— her doc—

t6?) kept her coming for treat-

’ intents for-Va, year—~_ Hospital ex;
penses, Blue Cross, his fees. He
had lamed her mentally —— abso-
lutely curesd her with the notion
of helplessness, illness, the ina—
bility to work and be well.”

And finally, he said, roughly
guessing: “Most doctors are
honest, of course. I’d say 90
percent are honest. But ten per-
cent are terrible.”

We talked about the fact that
the public is now in a most un-
wholesome silly state of deep
obsorption and belief in its own
infinitely variegated illnesses and

What could He do? Well since

what could happen?‘ (The Diety,
if he is a Deity, is most certain-
ly kind and does not punish and
revenge his outraged feelings).
Well the thing to be hoped NOT

proach, of self-revulsion.
that by accident we ourselves H-
bombed Cincinnati or some rather
large city. —— a missile going
awry or a pilot falling asleep. Or
two cities. That might do it. The
national horror, the national self—
hatred, the self—loathing, the
agonized repentance that we, the
U.S.A., would experience would
cause us to rise up and terminate
the assassine, murderous program
in twenty-four hours. Or say
there was (and there will be) a
sudden plague of millions of child-
deaths from leukemia—that would
do it. Remember that we never
repent (change) until we despise
ourselves.

And then I think how war is
the history of the alternation of
the powers of attack and the de-
fense. Armor developed as a de-
fense against swords, battle axes,
and arrows. The submarine was
invented and became, for a time,
an unanswerable attacking power.
Then the depth bomb was invent—
ed and the destroyer convey sys—
tem. Trench warfare meant that
every attack became. the total
slaughter of a hundred thousand
men butchered daily in mud. Then
the armored tank, invented by
Swinton, appeared and ploughed
over all trenches. And so on.

I think of the Battle of Foron-
ovo, July 5th, 1494 when Charles
the VIIIth of France came with
his army invading into Italy. The
strength, the perfection, the
costliness, the imperviousness of
flashing, embossed armor was at
its peak. But in this battle, to
the horror and consternation ’of
huge Herculean knights and dukes
in their shining steel helmets and
behind their visors, puny low-
born little fellows wearing mere-
ly cloth, had pistols, and these
weaklings, cowards, “poltroons”
could shoot down a huge encased
knight with battle axe and sword,
with merely an airy press of a
forefinger on a trigger, and at
a far, safe distance. Gunpowder
had arrived! It was a terrible
shock to the world and it was to
make the great feudal castles in-
defensible, to introduce infantry
and to place importance on com-

Well today, with missiles and
H-bombs and jet planes at this
horrid peak of their development,
I had such a good thought: Why
does not some inventive. young
man, American or Russian, or say
Norwegian, invent some delicate

that it takes only 4 watts to send

THINGS FOB PRAISE

Note that in. the newspaper
now there is regularly a large
pict111e 0
child with a dog; or (as in the
Minneapolis Star of March 5,)
tVso young men (kindly faces)
lifting a golden retriever in the
air to study him lovingly.
These, it says, are Drs. Scott
Claik and James C. Pierce of
the University of Minnesota. It
is the laborat01y of the Univer-
sity Hospital They have trans-
planted in the neck of the dog a
large kidney———a great lump.
They use drugs on the happy
doggi.er-..(there are doubtless
hundreds of them given the
same happy experience) “to
study the body’s natural rejec-
tion of a transplatned organ.
The aim is to improve the
chances of kidney-diseased hu-
mans.”

Now such. pictures you will
see regularly. In the case of the
tenderly smiling child with the
dogwthe caption says the dog
has been dubbed “a dog- hero”
because his heart was taken out
and put back. This dogmhis
mouth wide open—«seems to be
full of"merriment and pride at
the accolade; they have con—
feired a kind of knighthood on
him.

I just wish to tell you this is
an immense nation-wide pub-
licity campaign by the Medical
Research Society, This is a pow-
erful organization whose sole
purpose and immense expendi-
tu1es are to keep the public
from hating vivisection.

Some hopeful things

Mr} J a. m e s D. Koerner is
P1es1dent of the Council for
Basic Education He w1ites in
the ATLANTIC Monthly the
folloWing: “Let us have teach~
‘e1s instead of educators” " By
“educators” he means th 0 s e
niggling, fussy-mussy unimagi-
native people Who know almost

» ndthing at all (haying noafeele

ing or insight) but who have
years of training in methods of
teaching How the bright people
of the world (I include myself)
have suffered. from such peo-
ple! And the main trouble is
that now they all have diplo—
mas. (Aforetimel they wer e
pleasant honest farmers and
red-cheeked housewives). And
nothing gives a person a kind
of dry, arthritic self-confidence
and a peremptory certainty like
a diploma. My belief is that this
accounts for the thing they now
call “art’l—ethose acres, those
square miles of mindless mud—
pies. Observe that the breeding
grounds of most of the artists
are the Universities. (Did you
happen to hear on Channel
Two, John Rood and the head
of the Art Department of the
University expatiating on the
nationwide absurdity?)

Just as millions of diplomas
have made persons who are to—
. t a l l y unoriginal ki‘iow—it-alls
feel that they are teachers, so
have idiplOmas made thousands
of untalented people believe
they are artists. To have talent
means to have a vision as well
as a fancy for beauty. There
was a long tape—recorded inter—
view in a magazine with Ben
Sh ahn, a large loosely-gar—
mented man who is a leading
modern artist and who teaches,
I believe, at Berkeley. It inter-
ests me that he did not once say
the word “beauty”. And yet
beauty is, the whole point.
Beauty is the Lord.

But to go baCk-to Mr. Koer-

ner and his article in the AT-
LANTIC: This is what he says.
(I will try, not to fly up into

AND BLAME

angry exaggeration.) The reme—
dies for the faults of education
are clear. When admission
standards are low, they should
be raised. If work in courses is
sterile, it needs revitalizing. If
the faculty is weak, new facul-
ty-hiring policies are necessary.
The real question is not what
needs doing, but how to get -
what needs doing, done.

What are some of the reforms
to be made now?

1. The time given. to teacher-
training courses should be di-
minished. Keep them way down
to the smallest state require—
ments.

2. At least two- thirds of the
work for all graduate degrees
in. “education” shOuld be in the .
liberal arts. Students here 1
should measure up to the usual
graduate standards i.e. be just '
as intelligent as students who
are not going to teach.

3. The remaining teachers
colleges in the United States
should be shut down or con«
verted to general purpose insti—
tutions. Those that have al—
ready been converted in NAME
should move faster toward con~
version in fact. Removing. the
word “teachers” or “education”
from the name of the school
does not make the school a lib~
eral arts institution. ‘

4. Under graduates who mas
jor in “education” should be
eliminated. All teachersw-even
for the elementary grades-w»
should be requiredto major in
an academic subject i.e. philo-
sophy, history, ~ literature, phy~
sics, biology, etc. and not in. ed~

tion courses would make this
possible.

5. Education. courses such as
in education psychology, in the
history of education, etc. should .
be taught only by persons fully
qualified to teach in the aca-
demic departments of the same
”instﬁutromT'hismommon sense '
idea would mean that 90 per-
cent of the people new teaching
these courses would cease to ,
teach them. So it is a bit Uto-
pian: but it is a goal toward
which we should be vigorously
moving.

6 If competent faculty can-
not be had to teach method
courses—«and most such
c o u r s e s are incompetently ,
taught now—"formal cohrses in
the subject should be elimi-
nated.

7. Persons whose graduate
t1 ainin'g has been in education
and who have no other qualifi-
cations in an academic field's
(history, philosophy, phys1cs, ,1
etc.) should NOT be allowed to!
teach academic courses.

Report On Poor Animals

Mrs. Christine Stevens is pres-
ident of the Ainmal Welfare In-
stitute in New York and the
daughter of the Dr. Gesell I told
you about, who felt so deeply
concerned about the cruelty of
animals in experimentation that
he did all he could to eliminate
it. The Animal Welfare Institute
has a bill now before Congress
sponsored by Senator Cooper of ‘
Kentucky. Mrs. Stevens has writ-
ten to me:

Dear Miss Ueland: I was glad
to read your article complaining
about the unfair and erroneous
statements in ‘Animal Bill Im-
perils Research.’ (N.B. By Jay
Edgerton in the Morning Tri-
3’bune.) I know that you .too,’ op-
pose this bill (the Cooper Bill)
for you have written against it
in your columns. I regret this
but appreciate, n e. v e r t heless,
your interest in the protection
of animals and your constant ef-
forts in their behalf.

In your February 23rd column,
referred to above, you make ref-
erence to my father, Dr. Robert
Gesell. He was not a surgeon but

a physiologist. I enclose a copy,
of our Information Report in
which the exact text of his re-
marks to the American Physio-
logical Society. is quoted, for I
note that you apparently did not
have what he said available at
the time you wrote the column.
My father’s remarks have some-
times been taken advantage of
by anti-vivisectionists. This is
one of the reasons why so many '
medical men remain silent when
they should be speaking out
against cruel treatment in labra-
tories. They fear that their re-
marks will be misinterpreted and
used for a purpose for which
they were not intended.-

“My father thought that the
British Act of 7157.6..st-‘vev

however, that he or other hu-
man scientists would support

that was attacked in the article

(My note: Mrs. Steven’s Coop-
er Bill.) Sincerely, Christine
Stevens.

  

 

Here is the letter that I wrote
to Mrs. Stevens and I quote it
'not because it is an eSpaecially
good letter or because there is
any controversy between myself
3 and Mrs. Stevens. But it may
give an insight into what we are
all trying to do.

 

Dear Mrs. Stevens:

I must explain things that are

complicated and the explanation
at the moment is not worth tak—
ing too much of your time or
.mine, since We are both very
busy and myself, horribly so and
always struggling under a hay-
.stack of omissions.
But here it is: Thanks for tell-
ing me that it is Dr. Robert”
Gesell and not Dr. “Arnold”
Gesell and that he is a physiolo-
gist. I seem to have deserted you
and gone against you. But that
.is not really so. Golden bless—
ings on your head for all your
work and the efforts of the Ani-
mal Welfare Institute. I will
never write AGAINST your bill
directely and vociferously, but I
don’t think I am FOR it. After
hearing the arguments from
England and Calrence E. Rich-
ard of the National Anti-Vivi-
section Society and HSUS, I am
I find by temperament totally an-
ti-vivisectionist and cannot help
it. But then I am a Shelleyan,
a Golden Ager or whatever we
should be called. But I think
we must all (pro-Animal people)
help and be greateful for each
other, no matter how we differ
in degree. There is such a temp-
tation to lose divine energy point-

Res.:

 

 

I
was disappointed to note that
you never gave your readers the

‘Animal Bill Imperils Research’.-

belabor points. That would bore
and confuse readers. But I be-
lieve that everything we do (the
anti-cruelty people, even our
controversies, are helpful, for it
sets mental Wheels going in peo—
:pale’s heads. Lbelieve in discus-
sion, discussion, discussion.

I have not yet had time to
study your bil with pains, but as
time goes on I will do so.

My affection and painful sym-
pathy for animals has existed
since the day I was born. My
column and violent feelings and
vehemence came into existence
when I went to the animal meet—
ing of the Humane Society of
Minnesota (a branch of the. Amer-
ican Humane Society) two years
ago. It Was “packed”--—- I use
the word advisedly — with doc—
tors almost to the exclusion of
any other kind of person and vet-
erinarians from the University
and procurers of animals for the
hospitals. You see? All cram-
ming the Humae Society and
ONE KNEW WHY. They are ter-
ribly afraid of their supply be-
ing cut down or curtailed by an-
ti-vivisectionists. The meeting
reminded one forcibly of Robert
Louis Stevenson’s story, “The
Body Snatchers.” One brave
woman got up and read a state-
ment saying that the name of the
Minnesota Humane S o c ie t y
should be changed to “the Vivi-
section Society”, for so it really
is. Even the speaker for the eve—
ning was a sickly young doctor
from the Medical School (re-
search) with boils on his neck,
showing slides of achievement in
massaging hearts (they need
large dogs to practice this) and
he threw on the screen pictures
of a few poor, blue-lipped pa-
tients who had actually lived a
few months longer than seem-
ed possible, because of this
world-shaking feat. And that
evening sprang into existence my
state, of ferocity, my intransige-
ance.

And so now we have seceded
from the Ameriman Humane So-
ciety and have become the Min-
nesota Branch of the Humane
Society of the. United States
(HSUS) and have a dear and
wonderful president, Peter Neil-
sen, a manufacturer-farmer kind
om man. Whatever we do to help
animals is out in the clear, we do
not supply labratories. I hope.

Report On Poor Animals

For one dollar a year you
can be a member of the Amer-
ican Anti—Vivisection S o c iety
(1903 Chestnut St., Philadelphia
- 3, Pa.) and you will also receive
every month an excellent maga-

zine, “A-V”. Here is their
statement of principle, much
abridged. It will give. you an

historical insight into this slow,
slow effort to get rid of cruel—
ty in this polite but most ter-
rible world.

“We are part of the humane
movement. The purpose of the
movement is the abolition of
cruelty, both to human beings
and so-called lower animals. An
interesting sidelight is thrown on
our civilization by the fact that
although kindness and the over-.
coming of cruelty has been prac-
ticed for thousands of years, pub-
lic movements to adVocate this
purpose have come into being
only within the. past century.

“The wiping out of cruelty to
children was the first to be met
with a measure of success. Al-
though such cruelty still occurs
from time to time, it is not near-
ly so prevalent as it once was.
Organizations which have done
nobly in bringing about this vic-
' tory now have the mass of pub-
lic opinion on their side.

“It is an interesting bit of his-
tory that Henry Bergh, one of
the best known pioneers in the
movement to outlaw. cruelty to
children, was also a founder of
the first societies for the preven—
tion of cruelty to animals.
a time when brutal beating and
other horrors were frequently ap-
plied to children, the treatment]
of animals could not be expected

 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 
 
 

were applied to animals defy
description. . . . They could not,
and cannot speak for themselves.
and so needed‘cour‘ageous men:
and women to speak up for them. .

“We must point out that our
activities are mainly in the field
of education —— we try to dis-
tribute knowledge so that great
numbers of people may, sooner
or later, come to know the hid-m
den truths about vivisection ——-—- ;
I that it is against morality and the ‘
principles, of law. As for child-e
ren, education and legislation,
have to a measurable degree
overcome the evils which humane
people have so nobly assailed. No»
one would rise in public today;
and advocate cruelty to children.

“But vivisection has numerous
and powerful defenders —— the
American Medical Association,
and its many branches and sub-~ ‘
_ sidaries, the huge drug compa.n—~1
E‘eis, now one of the largest sec~ '
1 tions of industries in this counw
try with gross sales of more than
four billion dollars a year.
Science has become a cult, with
findings which the. lait‘y are ex—
pected to accept without ques-‘
tion.”

‘the great medical discoveries
have come about without

their claims ——- most interesting

me that she has some free cop-
ies of the book. If you want. one,
write to her.

A-V Magazine gives always a
few instances of experiments on
animals. I must pass them, on
to you from time to time. Alas!
Nobody else will. You think I
am one of thosepeople who likes
to astound and draw attention to
themselves by recounting dread-
ful drama. But this is not true.
It is terribly sad, depressing to
me, all the time. And I despise
the delicious sensuality of anger
and righteousness indignation, in
myself or anyone else. Wish I
could write Spring poetry for a
change.

But here goes. (Multiply the
following experiment by ten thou-
sand):

There has been a merciless
search for the “vomiting center”
in the brain, and even though
such research began in 1865 it
still goes on. S. C. Wang, an in-
vestigator on this subject, has
been experimenting in this line
since 1939. In an experiment on
cats in 1939 he seemed to have
been satisfied that he. had found
the “vomiting center” in the

HAVE CONTINUED THROUGH
YEARS. (Under U,‘ S. Grant B

In 1954 the AMERICAN JOUR-
NAL OF PHYSIOLOGY reported
some of his continued experiments

 

in Vol. 178, P. 111. (Dogs were
used this time.) In 1955 he was;E
still exploring the brains of cats;

In 1956 he was hunting a‘
“vomiting center” in dogs. Some
of the details follow, as pub-
lished in the AMERICAN JOUR-

:NAL OF PHYSIOLOGY, Vol.
{185, No. 3, page 617.

Dogs were swung in a 120 de-
gree arc till they were vomiting

(from motion sickness. They were
subjected to surgery. The inter-

nal ear canals were complete-
ly removed. (This affects the

and their eyes moved uncontroly
ably.) In other animals, partsl
of the. brain were totally remov-
ed. After surgery they were
given drugs which induce vomit-
ing and were swung in an arc
to test for motion sickness. The

According to the chart which
accompanies the article,‘ at
least 33 dogs were used in this
horrible mutilating experiment.

In 1957 21 more dogs were
subjected to motion sickness ex-
periments, except that this time
the chain of nerves serving the
viscera (stomach, bowels, etc.)
were partially severed or remov-
ed entirely.

The author decided after the
experiment —- AFTER the tortur-
ing of many many dogs, that the

JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY,
Vol. number 3, page 578.

Another instance (multiply by
ten thousand): The work of an
anatomy student at the Univer-
sity of Illinois, was much admir—
ed by his instructor, S. R. Rey-
nolds, who was able to give him
U. S. grants to go on with his
interesting work:

The student chose 14 dogs as
his victims and used them in an
experiment which he himself ad—
mitted had been done as early
as 1896. “Horse, dogs, cats,
rabbit, monkey and goat” had
been used. This experiment was
published the PROCEEDINGS
OF THE SOCIETY FOR EXPER-
IMENTAL BIOLOGY AND MED-
ICINE, Vol. 103, No. 3, March
1960.

The student experimenter cut
the arteries that furnished the
blood to the head of the 14 dogs.
In seven of them it was shut off
partially, in the other seven it
was SHUT OFF COMPLETELY.
The results were not surprisingf

“Tongue and mucuous mem—
branes of the mouth became pro-
gressively more pale as each
artery was tied. Following Oc—
clusion of the last vessel, mouth
and tongue were strikingly anem-
ic and cool to the touch. During
2-3 weeks following, animals re-
mained markedly lethargic and
apathetic. Stimulation with pin
pricks, pinching or loud noises
failed to arouse. them.”

(Bright fellow! Smart as
whip!)

After the third week the dogs
began _to walk but remained
apathetic and subnormal in reac-
tions. “Their condition was strik-
ng,” writes the student. “They
were markedly emanciated” (af—
ter 6 months) “with decreases
in amount of hair over the en.-
tire body, with a few denuded
areas — the remaining hair was
harsh, dry and brittle —— the skin

Gandhi said: “Vivisection, in
my opinion, is the blackest of all
black crimes that man is at pres—
ent committing against God and
His fair creation.”

George Bernard Shaw said:
“From Shakespear to Dr. John-
son to Ruskin and Mark Twain,
the natural abhorrence of sane
mankind for the vivisector’s
cruelty, and the contempt of able
thinkers for his imbecile casuis-
try, have been expressed by the,

Report On Paar Animals

. Axel Munthe, the famous Swed-
lSh physician said: “The smaller
the victim the greater the crime.”
Yes, it struck me the other day
that what disturbs and outrages
me most about the. use of animals
for sport, hunting, vivisection,
; etc. is not only the creatures’ ter-
j ror and suffering but that we —-
f human beings —— so much bright-
l er and (usually), far stronger and
l bigger, and always equipped with
excellent tools against the an-
imals, such as chains, traps, pinc-
ers, guns, whips, should, from our
vantage point of superior strength
and intelligence, kill and torture
these voiceless ones. It is so mon-
strously ungallant of us, so un-
chivalrous, so grossly unfair, un-
sportsmanlike, un-knightly! Just
to think of it fills me. with the
same fury and misery that I would
g experience if I saw a man attack-
% ing a little girl. (I would try
to kill him immediately and with
, pleasure.) It seems unbearable to
belong to a species that can be-
have so, and with such complac-
ency!

 

The medical school at the Uni-
versity has now very much en-
larged its animal quarters for
dogs, cats and other animals for
experiment. These new quarters
now extend far underground
where, in smallish cages piled
tier above tier above each other
and in the dark. The dogs are
de-barked, that is to say their vo-
cal cords are cut so they cannot
make any noise. When they do
that the scientists and medical
men are made nervous and ir-
ritable. My lands! we can’t have
that!

Victor Reinaecker writes on
\‘he Elevation of Science” in
.g- _.“‘n_m°al Defender” publish-
e7" "mOn . “ in EnglanT’ﬁom"
his literary style and the things
he says, he seems to be a pro-
found, gifted and very learned

 

man. Now I hope to show you in
time, in some of these columns

that to be against vivisection
springs not merely from a com-
passionate feeling, but that there
is also a great body of first-
rate opinion, —opposed to vivi-

section—historical and scientific ' '
—and expressed in the work and
lives of the greatest physicians
and scientists

In our day we
are the victims of mass publicity.
Therefore we are living through a,
period when there is supersiti-
ous assini ne adoration of
“science” and doctors. However
there is already a rift and a doubt
about it in people’s minds. And
nothing is hastening this sensi-
ble doubt as much .as the arrogent
superficiality and meretricious-
ness of the medical profession
itself. .

But to return to Victor Rien-
He says:

“The vivisector has sophistries
and to spare to justify his cruel
practices: the sacred rights of

him, weeping, and he gently,!
humorously, reproves them forl
their gloom and sorrow. He be-
gins telling about the swans.

“It is a mistake to think that
swans before dying sing because
of grief. Because of the fear men
have of death they speak falsely
of the swans, saying that when
they are singing their last song,
they are wailing aloud with sor-
row at having to die. But men
forget that no bird sings when
it is hungry or cold or suffers

or the swallow or the hoopoe, and ‘
these are the birds which, they
say sing long laments of grief.
But neither these birds nor the 7‘
swans sing for grief. On the con
trary the swans‘i bei' , --
have a prophetic power and, ha

ing foreknowledge of the good
things they will find in the next
world, on the day of their death
they sing and rejoice much more
than in the days gone before it.

u

“Now I beleive I am myself a
fellow servant with these swans
and censecrat’ed to the same God
. and therefore I think that I
shall be able to leave this life
with not less gladness than they.”

science, the supreme good of man-
kind, etc. are. flaunted in justifi-
cation, but this must be said
bluntly: no man has the right
to interfere with the lives of ani-
mals, except to save them suffer-
ing. The dignity and honour of a
man forbids him to gain his own
good at the expense of another’s
pain. There is nothing more
mean-minded than this scientific
cult of bogus necessity. People
use words and arguments without
sense of responsibility. They re-
gard cruelty as unavoidable; and
its condemnation as an expression
of emotional shallowness. But to
be compassionate is more import-
ant than anything else in the
world, except to love, which comes
to the same thing. Here is the
heart of the matter; Christ com-
manded mercy, yet each hour of
the day vivisection causes suf-
fering to thousands of helpless
creatures, who are tortured on the
entirely false pretext of the good

of mankind.

Report On Poor Animals
In the SATURDAY REVIEW
OF LITERATURE there is this

’ comment:

“The most unfuriating story of
the month was the story of the
American Legion of Harmony,
North Carolina, who have taken
to hunting rabbits by flushing
them into the open and then beat-
ing, bashing and flailing them to
death with clubs, sticks, jagged
rocks, etc. Some of the more ded-
icated to this sport. go after the
rabbits with their bare hands.
The American Legion officers call
this their ‘annual sticks-and—
stones hunt.’ ” Heroes! Patriots!
He-men!

In a letter to the American Le-
gion Mr. Fred Myers, our execu-
tive director of the Humane So-
ciety of the United States (HSUS)
said: “We have noted the date
and if anyone attempts to repeat
this cruelty during the coming
year, we will be on hand.”

 

 

  

Peter Neilsen of Lake Elmo, the
president of our Minnesota
Branch, HSUS, has asked us all
to read the draft of a proposed
bill to control labratory exper-
iments on animals. He wants each
one of us to tell him what we
think of it so that he can report
our decisions to Mr. Myers in
Washington. This is my letter
to Peter Neilsen. I show it to
you because it‘may give you a
clearer idea of what we are try—
ing to do:

 

Dear Pete: I have read the.
HSUS bill, RR. 3556, and have
discussed it with Mrs. Irving
Putnam and Marguerite Morri—
son. Marguerite (our secretary)
will write you her final discision.
She is for it she believes, think- 7
ing that it will help bring the :
whole problem of vivisection out
into, the light, help educate the
public, so overawed by “science”,
so skillfully kept in the dark. She
also thinks that we can’t get TO-
TAL abolition in our lifetime, and
that the bill is so framed that it
will NOT do what the famous
English bill of 1876 did, i.e. pro-
tect the viviseCtionists only and
not the animals.

This is what Mrs. Putnam
thinks and myself: We came to
the same conclusion separately.
There is one bad place, a terri—
ble weak link in the chain. It
is Section 12, Part B: “Animals
used in any way that would cause
pain shall be anesthetized so as
to prevent the animals from feel-
ing pain during or after the ex-
periment UNLESS (the italics are
' mine) the projected plan approv-
ed by the Commissioner states
that anaesthetics would frustrate
the purpose of the project.

Right here the full power of the
vivisectors comes in and controls
the whole. matter. Their say—so
is ALWAYS untrustworthy be-
cause of the very fact that they
are persons CAPABLE of vivi-
sectioning, which to my mind puts
them in a category of the irra-
” tional, the sub-human and the
insane. !
synes Mrs. Putnam and I have these
f¢1ge comments to make: She says:
LY cg “Take operations for peritonitis
” or —- I have seen the experimental
operations on dogs -—— they can-
nke not be anaesthetized for weeks
and weeks and the experiments
take that long.

And I think of the experiments .
on animals in mazes, where they
are continually frustrated so
that the accumulated anguish of

anxiety and disappointment ac-
tually causes death. There is
mental pain too, we must remem-
ber, which seems so excruciat-
ingly interesting to the experi-
menters. There are experiments
in astronomical numbers that
are. just for the purpose of study-
ing how much pain can be en-
dured before death, how long a
creature fed in such-and-such a
manner can swim before drown-
ing, compared with a creature fed

in some other way.

For these reasons Mrs. Putnam
thinks she is against the bill.

I think I am for the bill if they
will take out and Strongly bolster
. Section 12, Part B. I am for it
principally because of the fact
that it will bring the whole sub-
ject into the light. As soon as
the public knows these things
(about a billion animals are thus
used and tormented) they will be
passionately with us. In fact I
am convinced that the public are
so indignant at us for even men-
tioning anti-vivisection (notice
how nice. people will not listen
to us and assume that we are all
cranks) is due to a dreadful un—
conscious inner guilt. They can-
not bear to know such things ac—
tually happen. They pull a sweet
hopeful blanket over it. When
they are compelled to know it, to
take a look at it, they will put
an end to it.

I have also this thought: The
bill provides for a Commissioner
of the Agency of Labratory Ani-‘
mal Control, appointed by the
President and it says so Wise-
ly, “No person who is or ever has
been connected with any labra-
tory shall be. eligible for appointi
ment as Commissioner.” That
sounds fine. But Peter, in View
of the colossal vested interests
involved — the tens of. millions
of dollars" in Federal grants to
“research” (our taxes), the huge
drug companies and their fan—
tastic profits, the American Med— ,
ical Association, we must think
of what happened to Dr. Harvey
Wiley who so magnificently and
bravely and idealistically start-
ed the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration in the early 1920’s,a grand
man. In ten years he was out!
The food processors, the Coca
Cola companies, those who put
coal tar dyes in food) cancer-
causing), and DDT on fruit and _ ’
vegetables and poison spray whole
counties —— saw to that.

To conclude, Mrs. Putnam is
opposed to the bill as it stands,
fearing that it will (1.) just pro-
tect the vivisectors and (2.) lull
the public into believing that
something is being done. I am
for it if Section 12 Part B is taken
out, and if HSUS Will consider
again the fact that the Commis—
. sioner appointed by the President
may be the wrong person.

Yours always,
Brenda.

Anne Moffet writes from Flor-
ida about her“ beautiful German
police dog, Edo.

‘ “I have just returned from the
frozen north. Edo is going to be
down here on the Florida circuit
with his trainer and handler,
Winnie Strickland. She is a top
trainer and the only one in the
U. S. to be noticed and actually
honored by the Germans. Her
methods are extremely humane.
She believes in the low voice and
much praise. She says Edo is such
a nervous dog that any rough
stuff would completely ruin him.
She has been training him since
September. He got his first ‘leg’
on his Companion Dog title in
Philadelphia, Dec. 19,‘at his first
Obedience Trial with a score of
195 out of a possible 200. I was
up there. Winnie deserves a lot
of credit for this, because Edo
is ten times as hard to train as
a "normal dog. He was made shy
and nervous by being left two
years in a kennel, without love
or guidance. Dogs can get infer-
iority complexes too, from being.
ignored and neglected. Edo does-
n’t know how to play. He is mag
-nificent but doesn’t know it. No-
body ever told him he was a king.

“He is four years old, in his
prime now, but very backward.
He is like a person who has spent
half of his life in jail. However,
he has at last been getting some
education. He adores Winnie and
follows her everywhere in the
house.”

This is so interesting to me.
How many children and people
are like this - magnificent but
don’t know it, “never to be told
you are aking!” And it happens
—_—__ “ignored and ne—
é dull unkind parents
guidance.” And Winnie Strick-
land’s method (we should all.
make a note of it) “—-—a low voice
and much praise.”

Pastor Neilsen of Lake Elmo,
our president of the Minnesota
Branch of the Humane Society
of the United States (HSUS) is
like that. One of his passions is
the Obedience training of dogs,
though‘I think a more descrip-
tive word for it would be Com-
pionship Training. The other
night at our director’s meeting
in Lake Elmo he let in his huge
dog, Whitey, whose happy tail can
knock chairs oven and send
children sprawling. Such perfect
:manners! such serenity and calm!
‘Whitey sat among us, listening
to the discussion, as quiet and
noble as a carved lion before a
library.

’ Pete says that if he loses his
car keys in a meadow Whitey will
find them with ease. He says that
he can train any dog that is not
too very very old. He can train
a very vicious dangerous dog. He
has an especial~ chain and if the
dog tries to bite him the chain
increasesxits pressure with the
increased savagery but releases
itself when the dog becomes calm-
er. The method is always lov-
ing praise and appreciation for
doing the. right. thing. It is not
fear for doing the wrong thing.
The most important and touch-
ing thing about a trained dog is
the dog’s happiness in the use
of his intelligence, his ability, and
his generosity and helpful; re-
sponse to his human friend. How
a dog loves being very bright

and useful and working hard! ——
as all the first rate people do.

This is education in its true
sense. The word, “e-ducere”
means a “leading out.” It is
therefore a leading out of the
magnificence in us, the king in
us. To many it means the beat—
ing cramming in of something ——
facts, fears and sterile anxieties
—— by unpleasant persons. (1 have _
seen men training their dogs that
way.) ’

This makes me think of the
great; Russian writer Chekhov,
who told how a professor wanted
to teach a kitten to catch mice.
When first presented with a
mouse the kitten ran. The. pro-
fessor hauled it back again and
again, pushed the mouse into its.
nose and beat it soundly. When
the kitten became a huge tough
ferocious cat he ran when he saw
a mouse, maddened with terror.

Peter Neilsen is a very religi-
ous man though of no particu-
lar faith. He has given all the
spare time of his life to prision-
ers at Stillwater, to delinquent
boys and to animals. He says that
in his long experience he has
never known a boy who loved a
dog who became -a delinquent, or
who could remain so.

He. has a dream which may
not be possible but I will tell it
because it shows what a remark-7'
able man he is. In Stillwater (as
everywhere else) there are tragic
children whom nobody wants,

stall in the large farm-house at
our Animal Adoption Center.
Then have them take in ten trag—
ic incorrigible children. “And
the children’s duty would be for
each to take care of several of
our abandoned dogs.”

At our Adoption Center (it is
three miles this side of Afton-
on-the—St. Croix on Highway 95)
we have over a hundred dogs,
many cats and kittens, a few
goats, some sheep and Mrs-Helen .
Moelter’s eleven horses and Palo-

HS'US). It is an interesting place

going on. The fine new board—;
ing kennels will presently helpi
to support all the abandoned ani—l
mals. _

Peter Neilsen says that he
wants to train all the dogs. Only
very old and decrepit ones can-
not be trained.) He says: “With
training a mongrel dog that no-»
body wants can become sudden-
ly worth $400. This is done in
England all the time,” he says.

But in most instances, he says,
the dogs that are abandoned, mis-
used, lost and must be picked
up by the dog catcher and taken
to the usual “humane” seciety’s
pound, can only be sold for vivi—'
sedation or put to sleep. “So the
.pound can really only be a
lslaughter house,” he says.

He thinks there is not enough
lvision in this.

POOR ANIMALS . .. .

The following I find in the writ-
ings of Dr. Albert Schweitzer
and it is the basic key to his phil-
OSOphy about our relation to an-
imals.

 
 

“Wherever we find the love
and sacrificial care of parents
for offspring we find ethical pow-
er. Indeed any instance of crea-
tures giving aid to one another
reveals it. Moreover, there are
probably more proOfs than we
might think. Let me tell you of
three instances which have been
brought to my attention.

“The first example was told me
by someone in Scotland. It hap-
penedin a park where a flock of
wild geese had settled to rest on
a pond. One of the flock had been '
captured by a gardener, who had
clipped its wings before releas-
ing it. When the geese started to '
resume their flight, this one tried
frantically, but vainly, to lift it-
self into the air. The others ob-
serving his struggles, flew about
in obvious efforts to encourage
him; but it was no use. There-
upon the entire flock settled back
on the pond and waited, even
though the urge to go away was
strong within them. For several
. days they waited until the dam-
aged feathers had grown suffic-
iently to permit the goose to fly.
. Meanwhile, the unethical garden-
er, having been converted by the
ethical geese, gladly watched
them as they finally rose togeth-
er, and resumed their long
flight.

“My second example is from
‘ my hospital in Lambarene. I
have the virtue of caring for all
stray-monkeys that come to our
gate. (If you have had any exper—
ience with large numbers of
monkeys, you know why I say it isl
a “virtue” thus to take care of
all comers until they are old
enough or strong enough to be
turned loose, several together, in
the forest —- a great occasion for
them and for me!) Sometimes
there will come to our monkey
colony a wee baby monkey whose
mother has been killed, leaving
this orphaned infant. I have to
find one of the older monkeys to
adopt and care for the baby. I
never have any difficulty about
it, except to decide which candi- ....
date shall be given the responsi- gre
bility. Many a time it happens ray
that the seemingly worst-temper- his
ed monkeys are most insistant ligi
upon having this sudden burden W;
of foster- parenthood given to phi

helping man is God.” Schweitzer
would enlarge the statement to
say that man helping not only
man but all creatures and all life
is God. In fact it is his grave
criticism of the philosopher Kant
and others whose ethics and ben-
evolence extended only to man
and not to animals at all.

 

“That sympathy toward unfor-
tunate creatures can be awakened
in even the most savage of be-
ings I learn while the piles (for
the hospital are being driven. Be-
fore the pile is placed in the hole:
I always look to see if any ants,
toads, or other creatures have
fallen into it, and if so I take
them out with. my hands, so they
may not be crushed by the pile
or later killed by the pounding
down of earth and stones. I ex-
plain my action to those who
who are working with me. Some
of them are puzzled and smile,
others let the words they have
heard so often pass over them
indifferently. .

“One day a real savage who
was setting out piles with me was
detailed to Mrs. Russell, with
others, to cut down underbrush.

it, and his neighbor started to

Jmt Protestants, in that age-

(Note Ernest Hemingway’s two
articles in LIFE on the glories
and charms of bull-fighting. As
a man of foremost literary emi-
nence in this country, he presum-
ably expresses the highest senti-
ments of American he-manhood.)

Phyllis McCoy of Newcastle-on—
Tyﬁe writes in THE ARK about
this idea that animals are solely
and especially for man’s use and
misuse: “I certainly do not
assent to this idea, which I con-
sider contrary to common sense.
Millions of creatures have lived
and died and still do so—for-
tunately for them I—without com-
ing into contact with human be-
ings. Man has only recently pene-
trated to new depths in the ocean
and there found creatures that
have presumably lived from the
beginning of time without hither-
to conferring any benefit on man.l
No doubt this will soon be recti-
fied!”

As a matter of fact, Darwin and
his followers who rejected the old
orthodoxies for the theory of Evo-
lution, were the ones who began
to feel that the animals are our
relatives, our brothers, and no
doubt just as dear to God as we
-re.

Well, it may be that at last a

-ntle light is spreading over this
.. pid earth to the effect that
Perhaps animals are not made for
man any more than black Afri-
Cans are made for White Afri-
Cans, or laboring people for em-
ployers and investors. I hope so.

 

 

 

 

 




Brenda Ueland

Report On Poor Animals

I have been at Rainy Lake for
; two days. My sister and I went
in an open boat with an Indian
about forty miles north up into
Canada to Wild Potato Lake and
then to the northern end of Bad
‘ Vermillion Lake. On the Wild
- Potato Lake Reservation we saw
‘ thin, beautiful Indian boys, in
‘ the flimsiest of tattered cotton
rags (they are certainly poor)
playing baseball. We spoke to In-
dian men and women and felt
alarmed respect for their immense
shyness. There is a long silence
' after one’s questions—a painful
blank reserve. Is it bashfulness,
or the inability to speak English,
- or a dislike, a distrust of white
people —— (for good reasons)?
' Probably it is all these.

The Indian men are more com-
municative than the women. Pete,
our guide, was a nobly handsome
man and full of the greatest gen-
tleness, kindness and skill. The
women and girls stayed in the
background trying not to stare.
Many of them have the clearest!

and most beutiful features the
line of their lovely noses are llke

After speaking to the men I al-
ways walked straight up to the
Indian women and girls, hang-
ing back and shook hands heart-
ily and firmlv with each one.
astonished them but it pleaseId
them I think. I found that In-
dians have a great deal of humor

them. The best way to break
them down into easiness is to be a . .
little jokey. Tney could not help;
but laugh, look askance an. . '
widely.

Now for our explorations and‘
insight into these Indians and
lCanadian forests and waters. I
[have to thank a most remarkable
and wonderful man, a friend, Mr.
Ernest Oberholtzer, whose whole
life has been devoted to the wild-
'erness, to the Indians, and the
Wild creatures. He has lived on
an island in Rainy Lake ever since
he graduated from Harvard. That
was long ago when he was “a rash
bold and hazardous young man”
of the very same ilk as Nansen
and Amundson and the explorers.
a scholarly and distinguished
man, the friend of the most imi- .
nent natural scientists and con-
servationists in the world.

It has been a cheerful, dogged
fight every day of his life to save
and help that country and those
1creatures and Indians. Who are
the enemies? Well the immense
lumber companies, the pulp com-
panies, the concrete highways, the
politicians and those masses of
roughnecks who crowd in there
every year by the tens of thous-
ands each with his $200 rifle;
‘ . those big-shot business men from

Chicago and elsewhere who come
up in planes for the sole purpose
of boasting the astronomical num-
ber of fish caught and not eaten.

The Indians call him loving-1
ly, “Ober.” “Is Ober coming?”
they all say at once. Pete, our, .
guide, would point at his own
temple with an ‘
whirling it, and would say: “Obersj
—very MUCHI. ’” meaning brains. E
The Indians told of the ten thous-
and books he had in his house on
his island. And the day after we
' left, Ober and a young Indian,
Johnny Johnson, started on his .
annual canoe trip. It would take
one month. They would paddle
500 miles, going up into the re-

motest bays and rivers to see
what the Predatators, the lum—
ber companies, etc. were up to——-
what laws they were breaking,
what unnecessary commercial
havoc was going on.

He does this every year. Then
when he goes to Washington for
some hearing before senators,
some angry industrialist will
shout at him: “How do YOU know
how many cubc feet of water went
over that dam in 1959?” And
“Ober” will say, a sunb u rs t
of a smile in a sunburned counte-
nance, “I don’t know, but I can
look it up in that book there, just
as you did. But also I have been
there this year, I’ve seen what you
are doing!”

As for the birds and wild ani-
mals, I spoke of how there are
scores of miles of shore line, but
there is really nothing to look
at. Why there is hardly a dragon

' fly ,a squirrel even. Ober says
yes they are now gone, nearly all
of the animals. When he first
came there the forests, marshes,
thickets, glades, lakes were teem-
ing with lovely animals—birds,
thrushes, herons, hawks, warb-
lers, deer, moose, dancing fawns,
bobcats, bears, beavers, wolves.
Yes, the forest was inhabited and I
alive then, in the happiest, most
interesting way. There was some-
thing to look at, to live with! Not
so now. It is empty, vacant, a
desert.

 

“You see the lumber compan—r
ies raise and lower the water lev-
els and it kills the trees and suffo-
cates all the wild rice. No food
for the wild creatures.” He said:
“All along these miles of shore
you see tall woods and it looks
very fine. This is because there
is now a law that says that the
lumber companies must leave the
forest standing for 600 feet from
the lake shore. But if you could
be lifted up above the trees, you
would see it is all a bald waste.
All has been shaved off for pulp!

And so it goes. “Ober” and the
conservationists. have achieved
one splendid thing —- the Queti-
co-Superior National Forest. (It
is interesting that their staunch
and fierce friends and partners
int his effort were President
Roosevelt and Ickes and Governor
Floyd Olson, but Stassen and
the Republicans have always
blocked them for the sake of the
Big Money boys.)

“Ober” continues to save at
least some of that country, the
primitive magnificence of our
continent, for our descendants. It
is a long, lonely and day-by-day
fight for him, this ruddy, laugh-
ing athletic, benevolent, splendid
septuagenarian whose sword nev—
er sleeps in his hand, whangin
it against the Guaragantuan, hide
ous, venal, uglifying monster w.
mistakenly call “civilization.’
Jack the Giant Killer indeed!

Report On Poor Animals

Jay Edgerton of the Minne—
apolis STAR wrote an article on
February 8 entitled: ANIMAL
BILL IMPERILS RESEARCH. It
was an appalling article and kept
me awake, with the generalized
untruthfullness of it, for half a
night. I know Jav Edgerton.
Moreover I have talked to him
about the horrible, “respectable”
cruelties to nearly a billion ani-
mals a year. It seemed to me that
he agreed; at least his silence
lseemed to express sympathy. But
behold! here is this article. I
was going to telephone him but
could feel my voice. rising, my
chest heaving in choked protesta-
tions. There Was too much to say.
So now I answer the article in
completeness. I will mail it to him.

How to account for his writing
this? He is seemingly a
thoughtful. erudite and sensitive
man. "It must be that the pres—
sures on him —— from his news-’
paper, the medical schools, the
drug companies, all the solemn
press-created stereotypes about
“science.” have drowned out his
soul entirely.

The scientific communitv, he
writes. is concerned about a bill
now before Congress. “It has
every right to be,” he says unc-
tuouslv. “This measure would set
American biological and medical
science back a thousand years—m-
would, in fact, make this nation
a tenth—rate power, scientifically
speaking.

a vein. Fascinating! all the man-
ifold varieties and happenings
from that!) ..
“The proposed law,” says Jay
Edgerton, “would set up special
policing of scientists to see that
they are not misusing animals.
And then he tells in his article
what Dr. Visscher says, the head
of the Department of Physiology
at the University. (What an over-
powering argument!)

“Cruelty to children is and
should be a crime. However, we
do not and I hope will not set up
governmental licensing bureaus
to regulate which families may
have children, and to snoop on
all homes to catch those infin—
itisimally few parents who beat
their babies. We, who love child-_
rn, know that such an espionage
system would destroy more values
than it would salvage.”

Jay Edger-ton again: “Dr.
Visscher pointed out that all 50
states have laws prohibiting
cruelty to animals and in every.
instance these aws apply to::
scientists as well as others. ITi
1rS A MATTER. OF RECORD,
THAT NO SCIENTlST IVER;
HAS BEEN CONVICTED OF,
l‘l’lAlfl‘REA’l‘lNG ANIMALS.”
And here is Jay Edgerton?

 

again. How grand it sounds!
leffersrmian really! “The medi~r
val researchers say, -and cor—

 

 
 
 
  

{an named Dr. Lester R. Drag—
stedt, president of the National
Society For Medical Research.
Here I must explain something.
This solemn, awesome appellation
is given to a thing organized for
one purpose i.e, to be the paid
mouthpiece of the experimenters.
Dr. Gesell, a great surgeon now
«dead, said of it: “They have no
true interest in science but seek
only to provide an inexhaustible
number of animals for vivisec—
tion,” and he concluded his scath—
ing indictment by characterising
their position as a “travesty of
humanity” and predicting that
“this may well prove to be the
blackest spot in the history of
medical science.”

Well, what does the imposing
Dr. Dragstedt say? “This bill
would stop all medical and bio-
i logical research except on plants

and microbes for thousands of
years.” And now listen to Jay
Edgerton: “If adopted this would
be another form of thought-con-
trol, another “erosion of liberty.’
For it seeks to thwart the free
play of ideas. It would effec-
tively stop the far-i_'anrring intel—
lectual inquiries that have made
nossible the epochal advances our
in the biological
and medical sciences.”

“The. stringent regulation prof
nosed” (Dr. Dragstedt is talking)
lge “would stifle exploratory re-
en_lsearch and favor more perfunc—
O litory technological exercises

lar known in advance.” (How they

great achiever
ments of the American people in
science and technology since the;
founding days of the republic ’
have been due ‘more to the free
political environment of the
United States than to any other
factorf’

“Here” (it is now Dr. Drag-
stedt talking) “u n r e g i m ented
minds have been free to create,
and they have created more new
things than any society that ever
has existed on this earth. It is
important to understand how
closely the scientific leadership
of the United States is tied to
American’s historic abhorrence
of regimentation”.

“The question now is,” (Edger-
ton again) “whether the would—
be thought controllers will be
permitted to deal a death blow
to scientific advance.”

Well first, to answer Dr.
Visscher on the kindliness of
“scientists” (those child-loving

free, creative people!) to animals
the following is a. report of the
Department of Surgery of the Uni-
versity of Minnesota, by Stanley_
R. Friesen and Owen H. Wangen—
steen. '

Proceedings of Society of Ex-
nerimental Biology and! Medicine,
Vol. 63; Nov. 1946, Pages 245-
248. .

Necheles and Olson studied
gastric secretion in dogs with
gastrostomized stomachs follow-
ing torch burns to the hind leg
of the animal. They noted that
such burns augmented gastric se-
cretions if infusions of the fluid
were given at the time of study.
Hartman was unable to confirm
these findings and found that
both the free hydrochloric acid
and the total acid were reduced
following burns. Hartman, em-

 

 

to 60 per cent burn in dogs, in a
period of observation extending
up to 13 days, observed ulcera-
tion in the duodenum and stom-
ach of the animals.” (My note:
a 60 percent burn is a burn of 60
percent of the. body surface.)

It is the” purpose of this study
to determine whether experi
mental burns accelerate the oc
curance . of the histamine-in

dogs, Hays and his associates not-3
ed that 40 days were necessary;
to p1oduce ulcers with regularity;
in all dogs injected. j
METHODS. These. experiments;

 

were carried on in dogs and rab-
bits in three series. The method
of burn used in each series con—
sisted of immersion in water at

100 degrees C the body surface
‘ area and period of exposure vary-
,ling in the 3 series. Immersion
was found to be a satisfactory

method of producing burns. . . .
All animals were anaesthetized
with sodium pentobarbital. . . .
The hair was closely clipped prior
to scalding. No postoperative
treatment of the burn was insti-
tuted. Histamine-in-beeswax mix-
ture . . . was injected intra-mus-
cularly . . . each evening, the first
injection being given 3 hours
prior to the burn.

Experiments: Series 1. Fifteen
dogs were used in this series
Each dog received a 40 percent
third degree burn by immersion
in 160 degrees C. of water for
10 seconds. Eight of these dogs
received daily injections of the
histamine-in-beeswax mixture.

Results: Series I. All of the 8
dogs receiving a 40 percent ten-
second burn accompanied by his-
tamine-in-beeswax administration,
developed ulcers within five days.

DISCUSSION: It is apparent
from these experiments (page
248) that ulcers are provoked
more readily and quickly with his-
tamine in the presence of gastro-
intestinal congestion resulting
from experimental burns.”

 

Well children, I do not mean
7 1to suggest that there is anything
theatrical, sensational in all this.
‘ When you multiply it by hundreds
of thousands of instances it be-
comes most every-day, most com-
monplace. You are allowed (by
law) to go to the University, that
lcenter of Light and Culture, and
see for yourself. But you will
not be allowed to see the cats
.' neurological experiments. Thev
' have shut the doors on that abyss,
for some. reason.
, As for Dr. Visscher, a few yeais
ago before a hearing (the scien—
tists, doctors, experimenters are ,u
always there ,ominous,.-alert,.im— ‘, 7
portant to the point of sanctifi-
cation-—to block any possible work
of anti-vivisectors). He protest-
ed in a speech at the hearing,
saying how badly they needed -
MORE animals. My friend, Mrs.
Irving Putnam (very spirited)
arose and said: “Well if you find 1
it so hard to get animals, why
didn’t you burn only five dogs
instead of fifteen?” .
Now to relieve you from my .
feelings which are so strong that .
you will discount whatever I say,
here is a statement of our HSUS
(Humane Society of the United
States) in Washington, D. C.

“‘The fundamental fact is that .
. millions of animals are being sub-
jected to painful procedures in
American labratories every year.
Some are burned with blow
torches or submerged in scalding
water, some are beaten with mal-‘
lets until they die of shock and
internal injuries, some are innoc-
‘ ulated with cancer cells and forc—
ed to die lingering agonized
death, hundreds of thousands un-
dergo major surgery and are
cruelly neglected while they re-
cover or die. Millions of animals
a1e kept for long periods —— years
in cramped, dark and unclean ‘
cages that deform their bodies
and make them mentally abnor-
mal. '

“Anaesthetics sometimes are
used, sometimes are not used. In
any case, almost all animals sub-
jected to acute procedures under
anasthetics, suffer severely in
the post-anaesthesia period.

“This suffering, we repeat, is
the fundamental fact in this sit— ‘
uation. “The HSUS is sure 0f
the facts. For five full years, the
HSUS has determinedly, patient-
lv gathered facts for itself. Our
staff investigators have worked
inside labratories, all over Amer-
ica. as labratory technicians and
animal caretakers. Our files hold
hundreds of detailed reports from

hese investigations. We have

nndreds of photographs of the
abratory animals —— on operating
ables, in cages, chained to walls-

lsed has rocketed upward in

Report On Poor Animals

The protagonists of vivisection
have to work very secretly and
hypocritically for they know
the public could not endure it if
, they knew what really happens
in labratories. And there is such
wild emotion whirling about the
whole subject—guilt (on the part
of the perpetators, though seal-
ed off and repressed) and such
floods of propaganda for it that
hardly any one dares speak of
the subject, pro or con, aloud.
It is also so weird, so especially
upsetting, so out of character, to
have our great Universities Min-
nesota, Leland Stanford, Cornell,
Columbia, all of them, working
under cover, hiding, pussyfoot-
ing, pretending, when it comes
to their insatiable procuring of
animals and to their research lab-
ratories, for in all other things
these universities shine clear and
bright and transparent like Mr.
Valiant-for—Truth in Pilgrim’s
Progress and they are supposed
to be suns of detached truthful-
ness in our society.

Mr. Clarence E. Richard is
managing director of the Nation-
al Anti—Vivisection Society in
Chicago, and the Rev. Robert A.
Russell is its president. There is
a constant flood of soothing pro—
vivsection propaganda of course.
Here is Mr. Richard’s answer to
a letter that appeared in the Den-
ver Post:

 

To the Editor: You permit one
Lee Szynskie, sex and occupatidn
uknown, to use your ‘letters to
the Editor’ column to inflict
statements on the unsuspecting
public which are no less ridicu-
lous than would be adolescent
criticism of the work that made
possible the atom bomb.

. “statement that “the“ only
pain felt by any specimen is the
1same momentary pain felt by any
human being when he receives an
injection,” shows such an abys—
mal lack of knowledge of the
subject.

Any officer of any anti—vivi-
section society in the country
could fill a page of your paper
by experimenters themselves on
work undertaken for the specific
purpose of producing pain -——
either to study shock or in sur-
vival tests.

One such experiment done at
Columbia, involved the smashing
of the legs of 30 dogs by repeated
mechanical blows with a rawhide
mallet. (of the thirty dogs so
treated, 25 died—but first they
lived) from a period if a bit
less than one hour to nine hours
and twenty—one minutes. Th e
other five were brought back
the next day to be beaten again,
and three of them died of terror
the minute they were fastened to
the board.

“This experiment was so shock-
ing in brutality that it was con-
demned, by vivisectors themselves.
Is this what “Mr.” or “Dr.” Szyn-
skie calls a mere injection? Clar—
ence E. Richard.

And here is the sad thing a—
bout regularing vivesection, see-
ing that the animals suffer as
little as possible, that they are
anesthetized (this the experi-
menters always claim but there
is little truth in it. There is now
drafted an Act to regulate ex-
periments on living animals in

laboratory animals. It gives pro-
tection, not to the animals, but
to the experimenters, in that it
exempts them from the provi-
sions of other humane laws de-
signed to make illegal the inflic-
tion of suffering on animals.

“The American Bill will re-
quire the constant presence in
eXperimental laboratory
of at least one inspector (“author-
ized representative of the Secre-
tary”), and in large laboratories
there would have to be several
inspectors. And as inspectorship
on this scale is obviously out of
the question, your Bill, in its
present form, will be almost to-
tally ineffectual. It will therefore
lull the public into thinking that
laboratory animals have reason-
able protection whereas in fact
they have virtually none. This
will make the struggle to end viv- ‘
isection much more difficult. To
sum up briefly: Minimal protec—
tion, maximal soothing of the
public conscience.” M. Beddow

“But I have been regaled at my

I can tell them accurately, also,
for many of them I have heard a

Dear Mrs. Stevens:

I must explain things that are complicated and long-drawn-
out , and the explanation at the moment is not worth taking too much of your
time or mine-«since we both--and I just horribly~~are overworked and struggling
under a haystack of omissions.

H ,But here it is: Thanks for your letter and telling me it is

Dr. 'Eobert Gesell and not Dr. ArnoldJ‘I seem to have xnsxlnudxymnxnx deserted
you( your bill) and gone 512x against you. But that is not really so. Golden
blessings on your head for all your work and the efforts of the Animal ‘
welfare Institute. I will never write AGAINST your bill, directlydluniifnUbﬁwé%i>
vociferously, but I dont think 1 am FUR it, hearing arguments from England

and Clarence Richard arld n-V, and cannot help it. But then I am a Shelleyan ,
a Golden Ager or whatever we should be called. I havent a doctor and hope to die
without one within miles-~that describes the excess of my eccentricit .

#3.

(W “WWWLL Inf: $15.4
But I also think we must a1 help and be grateful for each other,

, now matter how we differ in degree about cumelty to animals.

Now about my column: I write it without pay for this small
Norwegian-American newspaper which has 5000 circulation , though it is
probably read carefully by 10,000 people. Minnesota is a very cruel state
as yet-~good enough laugh but no prosecutions ever: The University Medical
School; the Mayo Clini and alla- as well as dog racketeering, commerzgal
kennels of the worst kind, animals thrown out and abandoned . I have only
about three hours to give to my column a week; my purpose is to open peoples'
eyes somewhat. They still know almost NOTHING about the TOTAL situation. So I
do not go into detail about this or that bill, or belabor points. That would bore
and confuse them. It is not time to do that yes; Perhaps it will be, later. I
think that all of us-- your Cooper bill especially and even the controversy is
with HSUS and Richard is helpfuluuto set mentad wheels going in peoples' heads.

ULQQAJN4D mwcbwmawmf», awim~jgﬂﬂaﬂwqw-€* Annuuuoiy%1,cnvwmuc.

have not yet had time to study your bill with pains,
as I should, but accept the hpinion of A-V, Mr. Chenoweth and others who seemﬂﬂn—
—-from my emotional point of view-oright. As the time gets nearer and the
controvsery more pin-pointed I will study everything more carefully.

You speak of my column on the Tribune article "Animal
Bill Imperils Research"y-I was utterly horrified by my colleague and friend, Jay
ndgerton, writing so ignorantly and (I think) so falsely, and by the dreadful
Dr+ Visschepw, so much esteemed hereabouts and/always present like a dark
ghoul 'wheﬁ any bill comes up, or hearing that threatens to block ANY
vivisection. (Like myself, he is a Unitarian,damn him). So of course I defended
your Cooper bill in that column stgutiy because to begin to niggle about

lﬂits difference from HSUS billWGOuld just confuse people, at least my

few readers.

My affectiohmand“painful sympathy for animals exist since the
day I was born. My column and violent ~~~~~ Mfeelings and vehemence came into
existence when I went to the annual meeti of éhe Humane Society of Minnesota
(of the American Humane Societydl It was ﬁﬁasked with doctors, almost to the
exclusion of everybody else-~ erm the University, especial precurers for the
hospitals-~cramming the board, mealymouthed and ONE KNEW WHY. Then there is our
Animal nescue League, always in the black, most respectable, efficient but
supplying the Uhinersity and not with simple h en honesty, but with
xxxnxnsxyxx a certain secrecy, impalpable and emggassing. Ihe meeting reminded one
forcibly of Rxﬁxxsnnnnnaﬁﬁﬂsnxn Robert Louis Stevenson's "The Body Snatchers."
One bra e woman got up and r ad a statement that saying that the name of the
Humane Society be changed to the Vivisection Society‘for so it really is. Egan the
speaker for the eveni was a sickly young doctor fgom the ﬁbdical school (research)
with boils on his necﬁf showing slides of achievements in massaging hearts (learged

from large dogs) . From that evening sprang into existence my state of ferocity,

my intransigeance.

So now we have become a branch of HSUS and have a dear and
wonderful president, Peter Neilsen, a manufacturer-farmer kind of man. I hope that £ﬁ0"
we are all also gentle and reasonable peeple, and working hard and achieving something.

. Please never believe that 1 dont wish you well in everything,
Strength to your sax sword arm! I do indeed, with all my heart. I will continue to
be watching and learning all that I can.
Yours sincerely,

June 8, 1960 Wednesday
Dear Mrs. Stevens:
Forgive this reprehensible delay in answering you

kind, generous letter. I received it and immeuiately had to leave for
the East, for three weeks. I hoped to answer you , but there was no
opportunity. Now I am at home. Kndkjthat hereafter I will respond
immediatelyé

Thank you for all the material that you send. Now I will
read it with care. I will use it as fodder for my column in the
Minnesota Posten.

And as soon as I have a little repnse, and have star
worked my way through this haystack of omissions, I will write you agao.

Thank you for your generous, tender-hearted work, in this
nervous pre—occupied world. God lead you by the hand.

Yours sincerely,
