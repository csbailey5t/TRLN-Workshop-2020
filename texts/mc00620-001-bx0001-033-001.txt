The Cry of the Little Brothers.

(The good St. Francis of Assisi called all animals
his little brothers and sisters.)

We are the little brothers, homeless in cold and heat,
Fourfooted little beggars, roaming the city street.

Snatching a bone from the gutter, creeping thro’
alleys drear, , '

Stoned and sworn at and beaten, our hearts con-
sumed with fear.

You pride yourselves on the beauty of your city fair
and free,

Yet we are dying by thousands in coverts you never
see.

You boast of your mental progress, of your libraries,
schools and halls;

But we who are dumb denounce you, as we crouch
beneath their walls.

You sit in your tinselled playhouse and weep o’er a
mimic wrong.

Our woes are the woes of the voiceless; our griefs
are unheeded in song.

You say that the same God made us. When before
His throne you come

Shall you clear yourselves in His presence on the
plea that He made us dumb?

Are your hearts too hard to listen to a starving kit—
ten’s cries?

Or too gay for the patient pleading in a dog’s be-
seeching eyes?

Behold us, your little brothersustarving, beaten,
oppressed,—

Stretch out a hand to help us that we may have food
and rest.

Too long have we roamed neglected, too long have
we sickened with fear.
The mercy you hope and pray for, you can grant us
now and here.
