NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT

OF

“ THE AMERICAN SOCIETY

FOR THE

PREVENTION OF CRUELTY T0 ANIMALS.’

1885.

HEADQUARTERS OF THE SOCIETY, g

)

COR. FOURTH AVENUE AND 220 STREET,
NEW YORK, JAN. 1ST, 1885.

ADDRESS OF THE PRESIDENT-

LADIEs AND GENTLEMEN:

The nineteenth anniversary of the existence of our Society
. ends to-day. It is a source of profound satisfaction to know
that the record of its usefulness, as the years roll by, exhibits a.
deeper and more widespread testimony to the wisdom and benevo-
lence of the noble-hearted men and women who initiated the
civilizing movement. ,

Pére Hyacinthe, who visited our headquarters once, uttered
these signiﬁcant and comprehensive words: “ Les hommes seront
justes envers les hommes, quand ils seront charitable envers les
animaux.”

If it be “impossible to serve two masters,” it is equally so to

 




 

 

  

6

. be cruel to the lower half of the animal creation, and at the same
time be just and humane to one another. Mercy to the meanest
creature that lives means mercy to mankind.

That crime and cruelty will ever cease _on earth ispmore “than
problematical, althOugh it is “certainly in‘ the power of ’i’philan-
thropy to ameliorate their terrible consequences. Our labors
during the past year proved this truth. The sum of pain, ne—
glect, and abuse of the humble beings given to mankind for
their proﬁt and happiness, can only be realized through the
watchful agency of your Society, by a daily familiarity with its
operations.

At the present moment, the earth is covered with snow, and
the cutting blasts of the north wind speak in unmistakable tones
of the necessity of protection for man and beast. The citizen,
as he passes along the ice-bound streets, often beholds that price-
less servant of our race, the horse, lying prostrate and disabled
upon the frozen highway. One cannot help thinking what was
its fate ere your institution lived, and before its ambulances, with
merciful dispatch, tenderly raised and transported it to shelter
and protection. In a moral point of View, moreover, do not these
spectacles, unhappily so frequent in our great city, preach a lit-
tle sermon to the spectators, who, young and old, ever pause to
witness the dexterity of'the kind-hearted agents of the Society in
their labor of love ? Let us hope so.

The recollection of that affront to civilization which was offered
a few years ago here by some Spanish adventurers, in an attempt
to establish bull-ﬁghting among the national sports of our people,
was offensively recalled to mind last July in Dodge City, Kansas,
by the ﬁrst exhibition of the kind that ever stained the history
of our nation. As soon as the purpose became known, I com—
municated by telegraph and letter with the Governor of the State,
but it was too late to‘avert the disgraceful spectacle. As if to-
humiliate the American people as much as possible, the 4th of

J uly—the nation’s birthday—was chosen for that assassination

of civilization I Subsequently a letter was received from the

Governor belittling and whitewashing the crime as well as he

was able. If I make allusion at this time to this discouraging

 

 

  




 

 

‘7

incident, it is only with a view to impressing on your‘minds the
undeniable fact that the existence of your Society, on the occa-
sion of the ﬁrst attempt, alone prevented the adoption of a so-
called “sport,” than which no effort of malevolence and national
hate could be devised which would so certainly and completely
rupture, in the American mind, its allegiance to the civilizing
policy and patriotism taught by the noble founders of the Re-

public.
U. S. MAIL SERVICE.

The U. S. Mail service, so far as it relates to this Society,
is conducted with the same disregard of humanity to horses as
has heretofore characterized it. Its dilapidated vehicles are most
unworthy the department which they serve. Arrests and ﬁnes
seem to exercise no influence, and our reluctance to delay the con-
tents of the mails is taken advantage of. It is consoling to think,
however, that the term of the present contractor is drawing to a
close, when. it is hoped that a more judicious qpntract will be
made by the Government.

OAR HORSES.

The mercenary practice of selling worn—out horses by the rail—
road companies for a few dollars, thereby dooming them to a
still more inhuman servitude, meets with the universal condem-
nation of all just and reasonable people.

FASHIONABLE ORUELTIES.

An erroneous opinion exists as to the character and condition
of offenders against the rights of the lower animals. Many per-
sons prefer to believe that cruelty is almost exclusively an instinct
and habit of. the poor and humble. The uncomplaining animals
which are seen to drag the equipages of the rich along our
thoroughfares, shorn of that protection which Nature provides
them against the cutting blasts of winter; the barbarous nicking
of the tails of horses, the ponderous bits and checks, and vari-
ous pastimes of the race-course, whereby deliberate cruelty is in-
ﬂicted, unredeemed by any plea of necessity, attest its fallacy.

It is difﬁcult to resist the just indignation one feels at the sight

of horses standing bef01e the shop- doors of the city by day, and
the mansions of fashionable 1"eveliy by night, shiveiing from the
intense cold of an Arctic winter, while the stupid and indiffer-
ent coachman sits enveloped in furs to the top of his head, and
the blankets designed for the freezing” animals snugly wrapped
around his own legs. These are c1uelt1es of neglect on the one
hand, and selfish unconcern on the other.

CAROLINE JOSEPHINE WELTON.

The memory of this devoted friend of animals while living,
and her fur'the1 benevolence to them when dead, invites a pecu—
lia1 recognition. In speaking of the melancholy event of her
decease, I took occasion at the time to give utterance to the fol-
lowing imperfect tribute to he1 cliar'actei, which I have thought
p1 ope1 to 1'ep1oduce here.

 

MISS CARRIE J. WELTON.

It is not often that the grim monarch, Death, has so
shining a. mark for his fatal arrows as in the person of
the lady whose name stands at the head of this para-
graph.

Born in the pretty town of Waterbury, Ct., of Ameri-
can parents, their sole offspring, as well as the sole ob-
ject of their aﬁection, she was carefully reared, and no
sacriﬁce was deemed too great to render her, what she
consequently became, one of the most reﬁned, cultivated,
and attractive ladies of her time. The beauty of her
person also was remarkable, suggesting to the beholder
a superb diamond set in a frame of delicate gold. The
features of her face, which was of the rarest regularity,
were illumined by the intellectual eXp1ession of her ﬁne
blue eyes, augmented by the dar-k brown color of her
luxuriant hair, a combination as rare as it is beautiful.

. ,

 

   

 

 




 

But exceptional as were these personal attractions, her
soul and mind, by their brilliancy, outshone them all.
The writer of this imperfect sketch was permitted the
honor and happiness of knowing her, and enjoying her
conﬁdence and esteem. It has been his privilege through
life to have met numerous examples of human excellence
and reﬁnement within the cultivated spheres of social
life, at home and. abroad,'but nowhere, and in no other
person has he beheld those graceful and enviable quali-
ties more perfectly possessed and illustrated than in her.
Her instincts and her actions were blended so nicely
that her charity, while it embraced the unfortunate of
her own race, extended its protecting inﬂuence to the
lower animals as well. Her religion was not ostentatious,
but was most fervent within the silent precinct of her
chamber, and in presence of her God.

Rightly believing that a perfect humanity includes
also within its sacred circle every creature which can feel
and die, she gave liberally of her ample fortune toward
the support of institutions having charge of those hum—
' ble beings, which contribute s0 immensely to the proﬁt
and well-being of mankind. Her superior admiration
was for the horse, which she rode and managed with
consummate skill. One beautiful creature was her pet,
and her affection for it seemed to be returned by a de—
votion almost human. When it ﬁnally died—as the wri-
ter is informed of a disease of the heart,» a disorder from
which its mistress was a sufferer—she caused a shoe,
along with the bits, to be gilded and preserved in a taste-
ful and artistic fashion, and presented to the New York
Society. But her gratitude to her noble, though infe-
rior friend, did not end here, for in a conversation with
the writer, she one day feelingly uttered her desire to
have a life—size bronze statue of it erected in her native

 




 

 

. ‘ “town, in commemoration of their mutual aﬁection when

«she should be no more. .

" So likewise did Lady Burdette-Ooutts, when about to

if . ‘present a town in England with a work of art, have re-
course to the lower animals for a model to illustrate the
‘quality of Fidelity, choosing the faithful dog for that
purpose.

To die, we know, is the lot of all who live, but to few
'is reserved an end so terrible and so rare as hers. It
may be truly said that she sacriﬁced her life to her un-

.: "bounded admiration for the Works of Nature. She was
a worshipper of the stupendous beauties which sit en-

. ‘throned upon the mountains of our Western World, and

" I to behold them she heeded no obstacle in her path,
either of physical endurance, distance, or atmosphic con-
ditions. She was as brave as she was ardent in the in-
dulgence of her boundless love of the awful grandeur of
nature, and her enthusiasm was really heroic.

Never before has the scenic majesty of the Rocky
Mountains been a spectator of an episode of human eX—
‘istence more touching and affecting than the death of
“this admirable being, far away from home and friends,
and high up among the eternal snow of that inhospitable
region. '

But rest and peace have ﬁnally settled down upon her,
and now, at the foot of a noble statue, representing Re-
ligion consoling the suffering—erected by her in the
Cemetery of VVaterbury—What is mortal of this excellent
lady reposes, while her virtues live ever in the memory
of all who knew her.

TRE ASURER’S REPORT.
NEW YORK, January 1st, 1885.
To “ The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.”

In submitting my report for the year ending December 31st, 1884, I share in those feelings
of satisfaction, enjoyed by all who are interested in the better treatment of animals, on account
of the prosperous condition of your Society.

From December 31st, 1883, to December 31st, 1884, its income, exclusive of the balances
brought forward from the previous year, was $30,025.95. .

The total amount of disbursements during that time, including $16,181.50 expended in the

erection of a new building, was $35,556.78 leaving a balance in the Union Trust Company of
$9,811.50, and Petty Cash Drawer of $58.33, a total of $9,869.83.

Your Society has invested, exclusive of its Real Estate, the following:

$11,000 on Bond and Mortgage on the premises 161 West 27th Street, New York.

$4, 000 in 40 shares of New York Central and H. R. R. R. Co. Stock.

$2,500 in First Mortgage Bonds of the Burlington, Cedar Rapids and Northern R. R. 00.

$2,000 in Bonds of the City of Poughkeepsie Asylum.

The wise policy, of so administering the ﬁnancial affairs of your Institution as to never per-

mit its ordinary expenditures to exceed its income, has been productive of the natural result that
it is now free from debt.

All of which is respectfully submitted. .
CHARLES LANIER, Treasurer.

ﬂ NEW YORK, Jan. 6th, 1885.

We, the undersigned, have this day examined the accounts of “ The American Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals,” as exhibited to us by books and vouchers, and find them

correct and in accordance therewith. _
WILLIAM LAIMBEER, . . .

 

 

 




 

REPORT OF SECRETARY

AND

SUPERINTENDENT.

 

The season has once more arrived when it is usual for us to
take a retrospective view of the labors of the Society during the
past year, and present to its members, and to the public as well,
a statement of the work accomplished in our errand of mercy
to the brute creation, during that time. ,

It is gratifying to be able to report that the humane movement
has continued to make steady progress in this as well as foreign
lands, and We feel assured that a vast amount of suffering to de—
fenceless animals has been averted through the instrumentality.
of this and kindred associations. On the other hand, we are
compelled to record acts of cruelty towards innocent dumb
creatures in various sections of this State ; many of which would
call the blush of shame to the cheek of the unfeeling savage, by
reason of their atrocity, thus indicating how much remains to be
done in the way of a more general enforcement of the laws, as
well as in the humane education of thelpeople.

The records of the Society show that its roll of members cOn—
tains 511 names, and that 67 were elected during the past twelve
months. It is our painful duty to announce the decease, during
that time, of eleven valued members, among them our late
honored Vice-President, Royal Phelps, Esq., and the Society’s
generous friend, the late Miss C. J. Welton.

An extensive correspondence has been conducted during the
past year with those interested in the good work, and numerous
letters have been received from sister States, as well as foreign

lands, embracing such remote countries as Brazil, Japan, New
Zealaud, the Sandwich Islands, etc., either asking for informa-
tion in regard to the organization of similar societies, or request-
ing advice in regard to the operation of those already estab—
lished.

AUXILIARY SOCIETIES AND AGENCIES.

Your Society has greatly extended its ﬁeld of operations dur-
ing the year, through the organization of two new branches in
Jefferson and Niagara Counties, and the appointment of forty-
two additional special agents throughout the State.

There are now ﬁfteen branches of your Society in active opera-
tion, and the total number of special agents, not including the
ofﬁcers attached to these Headquarters, is two hundred and
sixty-ﬁve.

WORK ON THE CANALS.

The canals throughout the State have been patrolled by the
Society’s ofﬁcers and a large number of cases, involving intense
suffering to the animals employed to draw the boats, received
their attention. Many arrests were made, and thedisabled ani-
mals were relieved from work till the wounds on their shoulders,
occasioned by the friction of the collars, had healed sufﬁciently
to enable them to resume their labors.

AMBULANCE WORK.

The ambulances, of which your Society owns three, have been
kept busy in the removal from the streets of horses and other
animals which had become disabled to such an extent as to ren-
der the use of these vehicles necessary. They were called into
requisition on four hundred and one occasions during the past
year, and were thus instrumental in saving the lives of many
valuable animals. '

THE DERRICK AND SLINGS.

These useful additions to the life-saving equipment of your
Society have been the means of rescuing many animals from the
rivers and excavations into which they had fallen.

VARIOUS PHASES OF ORUELTY.

It would occupy too much space to relate in full the numerous
instances where the laws for the protection of animals have been
violated, and the offenders prosecuted. Indeed the. details, in
many cases, would be almost too revolting for publication ; but,
in order to convey an idea of the different phases of cruelty which
have come under our notice during the year, we might mention
as examples the following cases. The intentional burning to
death of a horse by securing a bundle of straw to its tail, and
then igniting it; dogand cock ﬁghting; bleeding calves for
several days before depriving them of life, in order to give the
ﬂesh a white appearance; stabbing a horse with a pitchfork;
skinning a calf while alive ; maliciously driving nails into horses
feet, resulting in lock—jaw and death ; knocking a horse down by
striking it on the head with a brick ; knocking out a horse’s eye
with a club; exposing animals while suffering from contagious
diseases, known as glanders, farcy, and pleuro-pneumonia; mali-
ciously mutilating a dog by almost severing its nose with a razor,
etc., etc. The poisoning of Prof. Burton’s performing dogs is
another illustration of the infamy of which some men are ca-
pable ; but although the Society offered a large reward and had
detectives working on the case night and day for a long time, the
perpet 'ator of that dastardly crime escaped his well-merited pun-
ishment. '

DOG AND COCK FIGHTING.

Owing to the constant surveillance kept over places where dog
and cook ﬁghters congregate, no opportunity is given them to
indulge their brutal instincts within the precincts of this county.
Thinking, however, to evade the law, and bafﬂe the Society’s
efforts to suppress the demoralizing pastime, gangs of ruﬁians
assemble in isolated barns and hostelries, located in the woods of
Long Island and Westchester County, far away from police juris-
diction. To these'haunts they have been followed by our ofﬁ-
cers, who on many occasions have arrested the offenders and
seized the paraphernalia used for these unlawful purposes.

These raids are made at great risk to the officers, who are thus
brought in conﬂict with large gatherings of desperate men.

Several of these out-of—the-way dens have been recently com-
pletely broken up. ,

The labor and time required to that end has been very great,
necessitating keeping watch many nights in succession, while
exposed to the inclemency of the weather, long marches, and
‘other hardships.

BLEEDING OALVES.

Owing to the close watch kept over places Where calves were
bled, the cruel practice is almost suppressed. The prosecution
and conviction of one John McGill, who was caught in the act,
and for which he was ﬁned $100, serves as a warning which

others of his class are not inclined to disregard.

DOOKING AND NIOKING.

The practice of docking and nicking the tails of horses is done
so secretly that it is difﬁcult to obtain the necessary evidence to
warrant an arrest and secure conviction.

NIGHT WORK.

Occasional raids are made on the many hack stands and other
places frequented by “night owls,” especially during the winter
months, and where horses are found not properly cared for,
owners or drivers are compelled to take their animals home, or
provide such covering as may be necessary. This work is most
laborious, necessitating walking many miles and loss of sleep,
after the ordinary days’ work is done. Theatres, fashionable
gatherings, balls, etc., etc., are attended ofﬁcially, and drivers
compelled to blanket‘their horses or keep them moving about.

ROUTINE DUTY.

The Headquarters are always open, so to speak, for business, and
at any hour of the day or night ofﬁcers and ambulances are avail-

able.

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
   
   
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
    
 

 

 

 




 

 

1'7

Every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, ofﬁcers
are sent to the stock yards and other landing depots for cattle,
cows, sheep, and other animals, as early as live o’clock A.M. It
is needless to say that everything is done for the protection of
the animals. The cruel practice of keeping mileli cows for many
hours, with their udders too greatly distended with milk, in order
to enhance their apparent value, has been almost entirely sup—
pressed. Ere the animals are landed from the vessel, the ofﬁ-
cers compel the drovers to allow calves their natural food, also to
feed and provide water for the cows.

30,720 steers, \
785,719 calves and sheep,
and 17,900 milch cows, have been inspected by
your officers during the year.

TRANSPORTATION OF LIVE STOCK.

An ofﬁcer is detailed to every vessel carrying live stock, leav-
ing this portfor foreign countries. It is his duty to see that sufﬁ-
cient food and water of good quality, and also the proper amount
of space is provided for each animal. He is also instructed
to prevent cattle being penned on the outer deck, during the
Winter months.

Over 40,000 head of cattle have been inspected as above.

POULT {Y.

Much trouble existed with regard to ﬁxing the legal responsi—
bility for sending poultry to this city, in a crowded condition.
To avoid legal complications which would arise if the wrong per—
sons were prosecuted, the consignces were compelled to feed,
water, and provide larger coops forﬂthe fowls as soon as received.

WORK ACOOMPLISHED.

From the following summary, some idea may be gained of
the amount of work accomplished by your Society during the
nineteen years of its existence:

 

 

Cases prosecuted in the Courts . . . . . . . . . . . . .. ..... . ............ 11,324

ACCIDENT TO OFFICER CARPENTER.

Through a deplorable accident, which resulted in the death of
ofﬁcer Higbie Carpenter, the Society was deprived of the services
of a most reliable and efﬁcient agent.

THE BROOKLYN AGENCY.

The efﬁciency of this Agency is demonstrated by the fact that
during the past year it has been instrumental in causing the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 




    

f - 24:

 

i; arrest of 124persons, and the removal from harness of 394 ani-
mals that were temporarily unﬁt for work. The Agency’s Am-
bulance transported 84 horses, and, in order to terminate their
:1 surferings, its ofﬁcers destroyed 668 more that were disabled past
«is ‘ recovery.

. The Superintendent, Mr. J. R. Pye, has been actively engaged
° in obtaining subscriptions from the citizens of Brooklyn, the
whole amount of which is applied by President Bergh towards
the maintenance of this Agency.

 

 

Respectfully submitted,
HENRY BERG‘H, JR, Secretary.
i. CHARLES H. HANKINSON, Superintendent.

PUBLICATION S._

“OUR ANIMAL FRIENDS.”

This Journal, published under the auspices of the Society, is
now in the eleventh year of its existence, and its increasing sub-
scription list is the best guarantee of its success. During its
publication it has steadily kept in view the cause it advocates,
and in its columns the more important proceedings of the Society
have been given to the public. Short stories, sketches, and other
interesting miscellany, appropriate to the character of the paper,
have tended largely to increase its circulation, and make it val u-
able as a household journal.

Annual subscription for the paper, ONE DOLLAR.
‘ Ofﬁce of Publication, 5 & ’7 E. 4th Street, New York City.
