IT has long been known to a few, and suspected by many, that
hOSpitals are used both abroad and at home as places wherein
doctors may try new experiments, and also may " get their hands

’ by performing as many operations as possible on the patients,
even when those operations are not needed, 211' the patient is certainly
dying. But since the publication of that brave book “ 8t. 13231121221115 ”
and its key, “ Dying Scientiﬁcally,” there is no doubt about the

1121tte1" for we haxe here scores of such sl1211n2'111 1121s21s 1111111112

Jus‘tnow (June, 1890) a ﬂaﬁrant exposure has tat on place, and it has
been pioved that both 111F121nce and Germany doctors have 21212:. mall 1y

experiments appeared in 2111 English medical paper three years 211,521 g
and they had been publicly described at a meeting of the Berlin
Medical Society, so far back as November 2nd,1887. But none
of the doctors of Encland or Ger many who lead 211 hi1: 1rd of
them raised the smallest outcry till Assessor Leidif1 (who is 21‘
lawyer, and not a doctor) called attention to them Here is
the descupnon 111 pl 21in Enelish:

“ In the l12'2l2'2221 P1211 s for December 21th, 1888,11. 5835, we have a
shameful. story of some experiments in cancer graftinzr, p21foinied
by l’IAI—IN, on the person of one of his patients. This unhappy
creature, afﬂicted with the most painful and terrible of all the 2l1s2as2
to which we are subject, ‘had been attacked 111t1 recurrent car.»
cinema (cancer) in the left breast, which did not admit of surwical
interfe ercnce;’ but it 21111/1ears to have admitted of patholodical
211211211111211111 for we are told that three pieces of skin we re remov 1d,
111 which cancerous inﬁltration W: .s well marked 2-1.1 1d these were
act rally transplanted to the healthv 111Ul1t br212-st. The doctors
could not relieve or cure the unhappy patient but they could make
her worse; they could not extirpate her disease, but they could
transplant it, and this they did that they 1111011t havct he satisfaction
of2 seeingr how well it had taken. 1 not 111‘l1en,i11 some ten weeks time,

‘the patient died" 110111 the extension of the disease.’ ”-~/2121[1122212.~:Z .,
January, 1889, p. 1542.

And he re is the chm?“ ge which has been proved against the
French doctor .—

“ The President of the Rheims Hospital Medical and Surgical
Society has 111ve stioated the matter, and sent in his report to the
D1 21f22 of the Marne Department, who has forwarded it to the
Minister of the Interior. The President of 23110 abovementioned
medical society scertained from the testimony of seven eye-
witnesses that M. Doyen grafted on the healthy 11 casts of patients

a fragment of cancerous tissue removed from the Opposite breast.
He made a slight incision in order tO introduce the fragment, and
closed the wound with sutures. M. Doyen, in a letter published a
week or two ago, admitted having grafted fragments of cancerous
tissue, which had been rendered less virulent in order to act as a
vaccine. The President, however, has obtained proof that the
" fragments grafted on to the healthy breasts of cancerous patients
had not been submitted to any process calculated to attenuate their
virulence. The patients on whom these experiments were made
were under the inﬂuence of chloroform.”-——Br'iti.s'h Ilfedical Journal,
August 29th, 1891.

NOW we have actual evidence that, in Germany, these most cruel
andtreacherous experiments on suffering and helpless women, instead
Of being presented by experiments on animals, were actually caused
by them. The Bergen Courier, of Berlin, July, 1891, gives the
exact history of the case as follows :—

“The affair dates back to the cancer bacillus which, in 1888, a
young assistant at Leyden, Dr. v. Scheurlen, thought he had dis-
covered. Very soon, however, Dr. Senger, of Crefeld, pointed out
to the Verein fii'r imzere 111 edioin the error of taking that bacillus to
be the cause of cancer; and said that further researches into the
question of infection could only be made by experiments on animals.
He himself made a number of experiments in this direction. THESE
GAVE PROFESSOR HAHN THE IDEA OF EXPERIMENTING ON MAN, about the
results of which he told the Congress of Surgeons on April 25, 1889,
as follows :——“ Assuming that up to now in inoculations unsuitable
stuff had been used at wrong places, about two years ago I removed
single nodules from a patient, suffering from cancer Of the breast,
with disseminated nodules, and grafted these nodules on healthy
parts, covering the diseased parts with healthy skin.”

Need anyone doubt, after this, that the pretence Of using (or
mfg-using !) animals for experiment “ instead of human beings,” is
only one more Of the deceptions practised by this merciless gang on
the public ‘2 SO far is the vivisection of dogs and monkeys from
hindering experiments on men and women that the worst case Of
such experiments yet detected has confessedly been led up to and.
suggested by the vivisection Of animals !

When men gather grapes Of thorns and ﬁgs of thistles, then will
they learn sympathy with human suffering by cruel usage of
the brutes; and acquire the Divine gift of Healing by the devil—like
method Of creating agony and spreading disease. '
