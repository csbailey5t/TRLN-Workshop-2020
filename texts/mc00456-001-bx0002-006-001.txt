to be reliable and also generally humane in outlook. It is intended"

for the use of teachers, students and all who are concerned about the

ﬂ right treatment of animals by man. In the case of kindred subjects

83‘ such as Natural History, Nature Study, etc., which border on Animal
Welfare, only a few books have been chosen. For a fuller treatment

of these subjects, see the N.B.L. Book Lists on Natural History,

Agriculture and British Country Life. Space does not permit the

inclusion of ‘animals in literature’, as this varied and interesting subject would require a book
list of its own. ANIMAL WELFARE has been illustrated by Fougasse, Hon. Artist to UFAW.
