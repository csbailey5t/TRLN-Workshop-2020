TO: VETERINARIANS
FROM: THE ANIMAL WELFARE INSTITUTE

The Animal Welfare Institute is a non-profit char-
itable organization founded in 1951 to promote humane
treatment of all animals. Particular emphasis was placed
by its founders on advancing the welfare of research ani-
mals, for twenty years ago there was no organized charity
working to improve conditions for these animals.

Two pioneer publications in this field, Basic Care of
Experimental Animals (now in its fifth edition) and Comfort-
able Quarters for Laboratory Animals (now in its sixth edi-
tion), are available free to veterinarians and to persons
employed in scientific institution?“ They are for use in

these institutions only and arghn ; redistribution to
' ownership of such
Q!

sense of pride and

 

} o
manuals has been found to create a., l
a belief by untrained youths that theyiare justified in in-

flicting pain on animals in the name of qpience.

gg’f
high school teachers or students, 12*

Manuals prepared for use in high schools and grade
schools are available from the Ahi welfare Institute, and
veterinarians are invited to take free copy of each to give
to a local teacher - Humane Biology Pro'ects, as its name
indicates, is intended to assist high school students in
devising humane projects for science fairs and to assist
teachers in developing humane teaching programs. First Aid
and_Care‘2£_Small Animals gives information on the rescue
and management of small wild animals and birds in distress.

 

The attached listing describes all the materials avail-
able from the Institute. The order blank at the end may be_
used to obtain literature, much of which is free to veteri-‘*g
narians, and/or to apply for membership. You would be most
welcome as a member of the Institute.

Dear Miss Bemelmans:

Reference is made to your letter of December 16 to Dr. Brodsky in re-
gard to his request for 500 copies of Basic Care 9f_§§perimenta1
Animals. These books have been received; however, we are not budgeted
to pay $250.00 for these publications.

 

 

Over the past two or three years, members of our staff have received
supplies of this publication free of charge for distribution to veterinar-
ians in various training courses sponsored by our organization. It

is a fine publication and we have been able to place it in the hands of
research veterinarians, public health veterinarians, instructors from
the veterinary schools and military veterinarians from all sections of
the country, as well as, third and fourth-year veterinary students

from colleges and universities in the Southeast. Three hundred and
seventy-one veterinarians attended courses here last year. Over 200
veterinary students also participated in our programs. You see the
publication is receiving wide distribution and our interest is much
broader than providing care for the research animals here at our
Center.

We would like to continue to include your book in the selection of
materials we provide veterinary personnel who engage in our continuing

education programs; however, we can not reimburse you in the amount of
$250.00 for the books.

 




The books have arrived. Please advise us if we should return them
to you.

LABORATORY ANIMAL TECHNOLOGY
AT
MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY

A Technical Training Program for high school graduates who
are interested in preparing for a career in the field of laboratory
animal care.

This program is also designed to provide additional training for
persons currently employed in the laboratory animal field.

PROGRAM OF STU DY

The program includes one year (four quarters) on campus with
instruction in:

Environmental requirements of laboratory animals.
Life cycles

Housing, equipment and handling requirements
Laboratory animal diseases and their control
Nutritional needs

Animal physiology

Surgical room techniques

Plus:
Six months on-the—job training in private industry to put
classroom experiences to use in learning situations.

ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS

1. Be a high school graduate
or

2. Have work experience in the laboratory animal industry and
approval of the course coordinator.

CAREER OPPORTUNITIES

The field of laboratory animal care is growing very rapidly
and young men and women with specialized training are urgently
needed. At this time, very few people with formal education in this
field are available. Colleges, universities, drug companies, research
firms, hospitals, animal breeders, zoos and veterinary hospitals are
all hiring people to care for their animals. The number and variety
of job opportunities will continue to increase rapidly during the
coming years. MSU is one of the few schools in the country offering
training in laboratory animal technology. Graduates can plan on
finding employment readily, and make advancements rapidly.

AVMA Meets July 21 - 25

A goodly portion of the nation’s vet-
erinarians will be Boston-bound come
the waning days of July. Some 5,000
strong, they will descend on the Massa-
chusetts metropolis for the 105th an-
nual meeting of the AVMA for July
21-25. For five days the corridors and
meeting rooms of the Boston-Sheraton
Hotel, the nerve center of the conven-
tion, as well as the vast spaces of the
War Memorial Auditorium, where the
exhibitors will hold sway, will be awash
with veterinarians intent on learning,
conducting official business, greeting
each other, or just “seeing the sights.”

Before the final gavel is rapped and
the last exhibit dismantled, national of-
ficers will be installed, Association
policy for 1968-69 worked out, scores of
scientific papers read and appraised,
and approximately 170 commercial and
educational exhibits inspected by the
veterinarians and their families. Under
the guidance of AVMA President Dr.
Robert J. Schroeder, section officers
have been planning the scientific por-
tion of the program for more than two
years.

OSU Veterinarians Study
Kidney Disease In Dogs

 

 

 

Dr. Robert Candon

An animal foundation is sponsoring
studies at Ohio State University into
aged dogs, who, like people, are prone to
suffer from diseases of the kidney.

Frequently, kidney diseases in dogs
result in a progressive loss of the ability
of the kidney to clear the blood of cer-
tain substances at the normal adult rate.
Studies of humans indicate that infant
kidneys are unable to clear the blood of
some substances at an adult rate, but do
achieve such a rate within12 to 18
months.

The roles of maturation and aging in
these kidney problems are the subjects
of a continuing study being made by
Drs. T. E. Powers and R. A. Candon at
the College of Veterinary Medicine, The
Ohio State University, under the spon-
sorship of Morris Animal Foundation,
Denver, and The Seeing Eye, Inc., Mor-
ristown, N. J.

To date, they have tested puppies of
35 days to 7 months of age and have

June 1968 °

 

 

found no great changes in kidney func-
tion. This leads them to believe that the
major changes occur in the first 4 to 5
weeks of puppyhood.

Further research should ascertain the
specific ability of the kidney to conserve
and eliminate certain substances at dif-
ferent ages, and thus show whether
changes associated with aging are due
solely to a reversal of the maturation
process or if they are due to other more
complicated disease processes.

They hope their study will lead to
better prognosis, prevention, and treat-
ment of kindney diseases.

A by-product of the Ohio State proj-
ect is the development of a procedure
using radio labeled chemicals to deter-
mine what is happening inside young
puppies whose organs are too small for
conventional means of examination. [:1

 

NOTICE

As a result of an investigation of
the use of chloramphenicol in ani—
mals the FDA recently requested
veterinary publications to remind
their readers that although chlor—
amphenicol has been approved for
use in dogs, cats, and horses, FDA
has not cleared the drug for use in
food-producing animals. By using
chloramphenicol in food-producing
animals the veterinarian assumes
certain responsibilities. The safety
of the animals and his responsibil-
ity to the owner must be carefully
weighed since he is using the drug
in a way for which it is not recom-
mended in the labeling. If such use
results in drug residues in edible
products derived from the treated
animal, he has caused such prod—
ucts to become adulterated. The
interstate shipment of adulterated
food is a violation of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

Livestock Market .
Veterinarians Organlze,
Affiliate With OVMA

A new association known as the Ohio
Livestock Market Veterinarians Associ-
ation was formed at the annual Ohio
Veterinary Medical Association’s meet—
ing.

The objectives of this association as
presented in its Constitution are as fol-
lows:

1. To elevate and improve the quality
and efficiency of all phases of veteri-
nary medicine as related to livestock
markets in Ohio.

2. To cooperate with State and Fed-
eral regulatory agencies in an effort to
establish a higher degree of uniformity
in regard to interpretation and execu-
tion of market regulations.

3. To establish uniform and mutually
acceptable fee schedules regarding mar-
ket procedures involving licensed mar-
ket veterinarians.

4. To promote understanding, good
will and cooperation among the mem-
bers of this organization and between
members of this organization and prac-
titioners in other phases of veterinary
medicine through the State of Ohio and
neighboring states.

There is a tremendous opportunity
for progress through cooperation be-
tween market veterinarians and private
practitioners which will be mutually ad-
vantageous to both groups.

The officers and membership of this
new organization wish to take this op-
portunity to inform the profession
thl‘.0ughout Ohio that this association
solicits the suggestions and cooperation
of all phases of veterinary medicine in
an effort to produce progress and im-

provement in livestock market activities
throughout the state.

June 1968 ° The Ohio

Heinz Kuehn Leaves AVMA

Heinz R. Kuehn, respected and cap-
able director of public information for
the American Veterinary Medical As-
sociation, has resigned that post to join
the American College of Surgeons in
Chicago as administrative associate and
director of the College’s communications
division.

Mr. Kuehn served with the AVMA
since 1961 and was a frequent Visitor
to Ohio and offered invaluable assis-
tance and advice in programs here.

In 1964 the AVMA won the public
relations profession’s highest honor, the
Silver Anvil Award of the Public Rela-
tions Society of America, for its effort
to gain national recognition for the
AVMA Centennial Year. Mr. Kuehn
also received the Public Relations
Award of the American College of Lab-—
oratory Animal Medicine.

A native of Bern, Switzerland, Mr.
Kuehn came to the United States in
1951. He entered the public relations
field in Chicago in 1956 as publications
editor for the Portland Cement Associa-
tion.

In announcing Mr. Kuehn’s resigna-
tion, Dr. M. R. Clarkson, AVMA’s eX-
ecutive secretary, said, “Mr. Kuehn’s
absence will be keenly felt by all mem—
bers of this profession which he has
served so well. He has been a key mem-
ber of our staff. The AVMA Executive
Board voted a special commendation for
him. We think the American College
of Surgeons is most fortunate and our
best wishes go with Heinz in his new
work.” E]

Issue Warning 0n
Student Practice

Dr. M. S. Phillips, president of the
Ohio Veterinary Medical Board, has
warned veterinary students that they
are not allowed to practice veterinary
medicine in the state until they have
received written notice of successfully
passing the Ohio Veterinary Medical
Board.

This means they may not conduct a
licensed veterinarian’s practice in his
absence.

Dr. Phillips said the warning was is-
sued to maintain highest ethical stand-
ards in the practice of veterinary medi-
cine in the state and to protect students
from any legal action that might stem
from illegal practice.

The Board continues to encourage
students to gain experience in their pro-
fession by work performed under the
direct supervision of licensed veteri-
narians. E]

 

Lab Facility Seminar

A two-day seminar on the planning
and design of animal laboratory facili-

Medicine. The session was attended by
biomedical administrators, architects,
engineers, physicians and veterinari-

ans. E]

No Tularemia
In Ohio In ’67

Animal Disease Trends reports there
were no known cases of Tularemia in
Ohio during 1967. There were three
cases in 1966. The disease is trans-
mitted to man through handling in-
fected animals or by the bite of such
arthopods as deer flies or ticks.

There were 21 cases of Rocky Moun-
tain Spotted Fever, no cases of Rick-
ettsialpox, and 15 cases of Malaria.

Man is the only important reservoir
for malaria, which is transmitted by

certain species of the Anopheles mos-
quito. Two of the most important mem-
bers of this species are found in Ohio.

Malaria had been eradicated from the
United States. but has been re-intro-
duced within the past five years by
servicemen returning from the Far
East.

In addition to transmission by mos-
quitoes, there are instances of the dis-
ease being transmitted through blood
transfusions and by donors to blood
banks.

The report has not been completed
on the incidence of arthropodborne
encephalitis. Cl

Animal Technology Program
Announced at Michigan State

A new program, Animal Technology,
has been announced by Michigan State
University’s Institute of Agricultural
Technology and College of Veterinary
Medicine.

Applications are now being accepted
for the program which is designed to
meet the unprecedented demand for
technically trained specialists in labora-
tory animal care and pet health. Courses
begin September 23.

 

////

“Colleges, universities, drug compa—
nies, research firms, hospitals, animal
breeders, zoos and veterinary hospitals
are hiring people to care for their ani-
mals,” commented Robert LaPrad, co-
ordinator of the agricultural technology
programs. “The number and variety of
job opportunities will continue to in-
crease rapidly during the coming
years.”

Experimental use of small animals by
industry and health service institutions
has grown at an annual rate of 15 to
20 per cent over the past ten years,
LaPrad said.

Training in the MSU program will
take one to two years, depending on the
curriculum followed. Some of the spe-
cial courses to be offered are biochem-
istry, pathology and animal physiology.
During the spring and summer terms,
students will receive actual on-the-job
training in private industry, offering
them an opportunity to earn while
learning.

Dear Mrs. Stevens:

Thank you for your letter dated September l8, 1968. I am planning to arrive in
New Orleans for the USLSA on October 6. I will look forward to speaking with
you during the meeting.

In the course in Laboratory Animal Medicine which I am teaching here in the
University again this fall I have 9h students enrolled. I would like, if at
all possible, to use those 3 excellent pamphlets which have been prepared by
the Animal Welfare Institute and which are listed below. They provoke much
favorable comment and were very useful in the instruction in Laboratory Animal
Medicine. The pamphlets are:

g/l. "Comfortable Quarters for Laboratory Animals"
2. ”Studying Our Fellow Mammals"
3. ”Animal Expressions"

I would like to distribute one copy to each of the students who are enrolled
in that course.

As a matter of interest,h of the students who were enrolled in the class last
fall plan to undergo post doctoral study when they receive their DVM degree in
June 1969. Their studies will be in the area of Laboratory Animal Medicine. I
know that you will be encouraged to hear that such a percentage of our group

are interested in pursuing advanced work to increase their proficiency and
confidence in this particular area. I know such training will be both beneficial
to the research community as well as to the efforts which you are expending in
connection with humane treatment of our fellow mammals.

I look forward to seeing you in New Orleans in October.

Sincerely,

Dear Mrs. Stevens:

During the 105th Annual Meeting of the American Veterinary Medical Association
in Boston, July 21—25, 1968, I had an opportunity to visit your excellent

continue to show leadership in this area of humane treatment, along with
my other duties here in Auburn.

If at anytime you are coming this way, I do hope that you will so advise

Dear Miss Stevens:

Attached are two 8 x 10 photographs, one of which was used on the
cover of the Purina "Laboratory Animal Digest". The other is a
similar View, but from a different angle that I thought you would
be interested in. You have our permission to use either one. We
would appreciate a credit line, either, "Photo courtesy Ralston
Purina Company," or "Courtesy Purina 'Laboratory Animal Digest'."
However, a credit line is not absolutely necessary.

Any time we can be of further assistance to you, please let Dr.
Moreland any myself know.
