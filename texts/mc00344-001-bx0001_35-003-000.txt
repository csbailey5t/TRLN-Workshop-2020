From 4 Corners of the Earth

RARE-BIRD COLLECTOR AND BREEDER Dr. Carl G. Heller, head of the
Division of Reproductive Physiology, Paciﬁc Northwest Research Foundation, and
practicing endocrinologist of Seattle, is a ﬁrm believer in thorough prenatal care for
his feathered charges. Dr. Heller, of course, provides the birds with proper and
adequate food. Their housing is special, since, as the photos indicate, it is as much
like the natural environment as possible.

 
 
 
 

THE AVIARY is a substantial distance from the disturbances of heavily p0pulated
areas, free from smoke and fog and noise, and partitioned so as to isolate the bird
species. The aviary has a 12—by—32—ft., heated, enclosed area containing a sectiOn
where food is prepared—complete with water, a freezer, and a worktable. A center
aisle runs between the cages. Each cage has its own water and drain and doors to
the outside ﬂight cages. There are 10 ﬂight cages, each 6 by 24 ft.

 
 

Aviary interior, which is heated and lighted at night, is in-
spected by Dr. Heller, left, and his associate, Dr. Allan Lobb.

Two OTHER FLIGHT CAGES provide an additional 24 by 52 ft. A11 cages contain
real trees, brush, stumps, and vines and perching limbs. Dr. Heller’s wife, Meta,
assists him, obtaining most of the food for the birds. She is a member of the Animal
Welfare Institute, which is devoted to the promotion of humane treatment of lab-
oratory animals. Among the birds in the collection are the alpine chough (Switzer-
land), hunting cissa (Thailand), Peking robin (China), and royal starling (Kenya).
Among difﬁculties facing Dr. Heller and his associates is that it is almost impossible
to determine the age and difﬁcult to determine the sex of the birds.

THE DOLPHINS WIN OUT: In response to news reports last
spring alleging that porpoises were being trained for Kamikaze duty
against enemy submarines, the head of the Navy's Marine Sciences
Division at Point Mugu, Calif, gave these assurances to the Ammal
Welfare Institute. (1) Humane considerations aside, the Navy can '
conce1ve Of no USe 'to which a porpoise might lend itself that would
necessitate blowing up the animal." (2) Although, in training, a
porpoise receives fish when it responds correctly and no fish when it
doesn't, every animal still receives its full ration of food every day.
In any case, "porpoises are relatively not highly motivated by food,
and it serves no useful purpose to starve them." (3) The last people
in the world who would turn Point Mugu's porpoises into "unwitting
Kamikazes" are the men and women who work with them— ~for "after
months of training their porpoises, feeding them, learning from them
and coming to recognize them as individual personalities, they have '

become quite attached to them."

In a nationalisur‘vey of 104
instltutions, the J ewish “Hos-

two given a top rating for
“proper care and treatment

The designation was made by
the Animal Welfare Institute of
New York City, whose findings
were inserted in the Congression-
al Record. Congress is consider-

 

‘ing legislation to regulate the
use of animals in laboratory re»
search.

Found Conditions Poor

The institute said that, in gen-
eral, it found load. conditions in
animal laboratories throughout
the nation.

Besides the Jewish Hospital of

‘ Brooklyn, the ony other exception
was the research lab at Dart-
mouth College in Hanover, N.H.

Dear Christine:
This bell really rolled!

I don't understand Dr. Kesow's statement,
"The hospital raises its own animals for
experimental work."

She told Mrs. Brookings, Eelene Artssy and
I that she bought the dogs from a dog dealer.
(see my report).

Anyway, she could have been misquoted.

TYPICAL

COMMENTS

. . . about tbe Animal Welfare Institute

 




 

PROMINENT leaders in the ﬁelds of scientiﬁc research
and animal protection have commented most favorably
on the establishment of the Animal Welfare Institute.

Some typical observations:

CONFIRMING THE NEED FOR THE INSTITUTE

”I bane been greatly interested in tbe prospectus of tbe

Animal Welfare Institute. Your plans seem to me to be

sound and well worked out. Tbere is need for sucb an

institute. In particular, I like your constructive approacb

to'tbe problem of tbe bumane bandling of laboratory

Institute of Human Biology,
University of Michigan,
Ann Arbor, Michigan.

"I have great hopes that the Animal Welfare Institute
will be able to obtain some constructive suggestions for
solving our research problems and wish you all success
with this project.”

Rutherford T. Phillips, Secretary,

Pennsylvania Society for the Prevention

of Cruelty to Animals,
Philadelphia, Pa.

"I was mucb interested in your outline for a prospectus for
tbe betterment of tbe status of small animals in the role
tbey play in tbe ﬁeld of buman and veterinary bealtb work.
It is certainly time tbat tbe opposing factions are united
in an eﬂort to bring about bumane but continued use of

small animals in tbis ﬁeld.”
D. B. Meyer, D.V.M.,
. Division of Laboratories,
" Michigan Department of Health,
Lansing, Michigan.

"You are to be congratulated for setting forth so clearly
your aims and plans and when the program is brought
to fruition, it will be a real contribution to all con-
cerned.”

Gerald R. Dalmadge, Superintendent,

The Palo Alto Humane Society
Palo Alto, California.

”Tbe outline indicates tbat you bane given tbe subject
tbougbt and tbat tbose responsible for its preparation bane
made a good approacb.”

“It seems to me very well organized and certainly con-

tains the basis for the Animal Welfare Institute to

begin sound operation. Its purpose and scope should

be of extreme interest to everyone in the humane ﬁeld

as well as those using animals for experimentation.

The whole ﬁeld of animal experimentation and control

—including the source of supply—~needs a study that will -
be based on facts.”

Carlton E. Buttrick, President,

The Animal Rescue League of Boston,
Boston, Massachusetts. ‘

ENDORSING THE OBJECTIVES OF THE INSTITUTE

"Animal welfare societies in the United States should form
an organization comparable to the Universities Federation
for Animal Welfare in England, thus givin a service that
would assist in the care and treatment of l animals used
In ”26‘1““! "wank" Albert H. MacCarthy, President,
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty

to Animals of Anne Arundel County,
Annapolis, Maryland.

“I cannot help but voice commendation for the practical
and ambitious aims of the Institute in its endeavor to
promote the welfare of all annuals.”

Tom Justice, .

The Humane Soaety of the City of Columbus,

Columbus, Ohio.

"The aim as outlined in your prospectus to promote the
welfare and reduce the total pain of all animals is well
taken", Harry G. Herrlein (Breeder),

Rockland Farms,
New City, N. Y.

“We will follow the development of your Animal Wel-
fare Institute with much interest. The objectives seem
clearly deﬁned and very worth while.”

C. M. McCay, Professor of Nutrition,

Department of Animal Husbandry,

New York State College of Agriculture,

Cornell University,
Ithaca, New York.

”I suhscrihe one hundred per cent to your outlined ohiec~
tives. You seem to have comprehensive knowledge of the
problem and your approach to resolving this frohlem
should have the support of all humane people an organi-
zations and also should receive the consideration of the
J't'tentlsts.” B. P. Sook, General Manager,

Mohawk & Hudson River Humane Society,
Albany, New York.

 




“In my opinion your basic principles for the Institute
are sound and thoughtful, and I do not know a sc1entist
who would take serious exception to this statement of
them.”

Ray D. Owen,

Kerckhoff Laboratories of Biology,
California Institute of Technology,
Pasadena, Calilornia.

APPROVING THE PROGRAM OF THE INSTITUTE

"An excellent iob has been done in developing an outline
for the Institute. You have implied at several points the
need for conference: with all of the diﬂerent interests
”wowed", Sydney H. Coleman, Executive ViceoPresident,
The American Society for the Prevention

of Cruelty to Animals,

New York, N. Y.

"As long as the two factions sit with their backs to each
other, and call each other nasty names, they will remain
where they have been for years and make no progress
toward solving the real problem. But, if, as, and when
they will face about and gather around a conference
table, they can and will make progress which will beneﬁt
all animals as well as mankind.”

Dr. W. A. Young, Managing Director,

The Anti-Cruelty Society
Chicago, Illinois. ’

"I am in sympathy with any organization which seeks to
promote the humane treatment of animals while at the
same time recognizing the essentiality of animal experi-
mentation in biology and medicine.

”I believe that laboratories engaged in animal experimenta-
tion should be required by law to meet intelligent require-
ments as to housing the animals and as to humane care.
I believe that all individuals who are trained to do animal
experimentation should be taught to give the animals the
best possible care and to avoid pain where possible.”

Dr. Dwight J. Ingle,
The Upjohn Company,
Kalamazoo, Michigan.

“We are much interested in the prospectus for The
Animal Welfare Institute. There has been a great deal
of guesswork about the extent to which animals suffer
and deﬁnitive data is highly desirable.”

Richard W. WeStwood, President
American Nature Association,

Editor, NATURE Magazine,
Washington, D. C.

CRAWFORD DOR-SEAL

Save as much as $700 per door, per year

WHAT DOR-SEAL IS. Crawford Dor-Seal is a system of
compressive polyetherfoam bolsters, encased in weatherproof,
practically wearproof, material installed around door openings
where trailers and trucks are loaded or unloaded.

WHAT IT DOES. Dor-Seal provides a “pillow” which
receives the rear end of the trailer or truck and, through com-
pression by the vehicle body, forms a seal which locks in
heated, cooled, washed, filtered or other expensive processed
air and locks out wind, rain, exhaust fumes, dust and other
air-borne contamination.

3 BENEFITS. Virtual elimination of loss of expensive processed
air can save more than $700 per year when Dor-Seal is mounted
on a 10’ x 10’ truck loading door; $300 on an 8’ x 8’ door. Other
savings include reduction in employee absenteeism due to
sickness resulting from cold and drafts; steadier production
due to better working conditions; better product quality control
due to exclusion of air-borne contaminants, including insects;
lower operating costs through elimination of damage to trailer
and truck doors and hinges.

FOR MORE INFORMATION call your local Crawford
dealer (look in the Yellow pages under DOORS) and ask for
Dor-Seal illustrated brochure CD-31968 or write us direct.

In a report to the Animal Wel-
fare Institute of New York City,
Dr. Harry Lillie expresses shock
over what he has found to be the
excessive slaughter of seals in
the area of Baffin Island and
Greenland, in the Northwest Ate
lantic.

 

As a member of the Humane ‘

Society of the United States and
a conservationist, I became in—
terested in possible protection of
seals when the Canadian Federal
Government reported the slaugh-
ter of 300,000 annually. Dr. Lil-
lie is convinced the destruction
of seals is closer to 400,000.
.. A biological survey made in

1950 revealed,

VpOpulation was about 3,000,000.
"Since that time, it has beenfound
that an estimated two-thirds of
this population has been wiped
out.

As you know, seal pups and
adult seals are taken for the fur
'trade, for the leather trade, for
their fat, for the manufacture of
margarine, soap and oil for lub-
ricants.

Dr. Lillie said the attacks come
during the March and April
breeding season in the Newfound-
land area on pack ice drifting
with the southbound Artic current
down the coast of Labrador.

. “The baby seals, helpless on
the ice, are knocked on the head
with gaffs, rough cut wooden
staffs," Dr. Lillie said. “This,
properly done, involves no suf-

 

isfactory humane method, but
young .seals with a kick before
cutting the bodies out of the fat
and skin."

When the adult seals gather on
the ice to moult, Dr. Lillie said
they're shot from a diStance with
rifles, “involving great cruelty
and waste, many escaping badly
wounded to die under the ice."

Attempts to remedy the situa-
tion have been made in meetings
of the International Commission
for the Northwest Atlantic Fish-
eries. Meetings have been held

in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and else-
where. “

Pressure to stop the slaughter
is being brought by France,West
Germany, Iceland, Italy, Poland,
Portugal, Spain and Russia. In_
England, the Survival Service
Commission of the International
Union for the Conservation of
Nature urged that a sanctuary
area be designated.

These are not attempts to do
away with the sealing industry.
They are only attempts to cut'
needless slaughter in order that
the seal will not become extinct.
Dr. Lillie warned that the same
thing can happen to the sealing
industry as happened to the whal-
ing industry. . -

An intrepid conservationist,
Dr. Lillie has walked across the
pack ice to personally gather
evidence of the “overkill"meth-
ods of the sealers.

From what he has seen of the
losses through callous shooting
and careless handling of pelts,
he feels etter methods could!
entail the 'lling of 100,000 in
order to satisfy the demands of
the induStry. And this, he added,
is still a heavy slaughter.

During his treks across the
pack ice, Dr. Lillie said he has
seen a loss of two seals for each
one secured. “I have seen as .
many as five blood trails off

 
   
     
         
     
     
       
       
       
     
     
 

seal recovered,” he said.

    
    

“I have seen mother seals,
after the sealers had passed,
clamber back on the ice andwon-
der why little bleeding carcasses
could not suck milk from them. .

 
   
     
       
     
 

“Far out from- the nearest
sealing ship, I have lain down
beside a Harp seal stricken with
a bullet through the lungs. As
its surroundings began to dim
perhaps it wondered what it
had done to deserve it. Aslgen-
tly stroked the beautiful head
there seemed no long to be any
fear. Then as my arm went.
round it, ,it pushed its nose into
my windproof jacket and died."

Last 02‘ Year, Attracts 1,304

By JOHN RENDEL

- HE Bronx County Kennel
, Club has startled the dog
fancy, including its own. offi-
cers, by coming up with the
largest entry in. memory for
its show next Sunday. The
total is 1,304 for a remark-
able increase of 467 over last
year. Mrs. Debbie-Lynn Bow-
den of Riverdale, the club
secretary, for one,
could not remem-
ber when the entry
had touched even
1.000 before. The
event will be in

News
of
Dogs

' the huge Kingsbridge Armory

at Jerome Avenue and Kings-
bridge Road in the Bronx.

The club accepted the date

with trepidation as being too
close to Christmas after it
was compelled to abandon the
show’s customary October
date. Military exercises that
could not be postponed made
the armory unavailable and
James J. Kermath's show
committee faced a. problem.

Was it. better to drop the

. show entirely this year, seek.

another location or accept; one

, of several alternate dates in
the Kingsbridge Armory?

Mrs. Bowden said there was
reluctance to cancel the event
after it had been in Operation.
for 42 years. A search of the
Bronx disclosed that there
was no place else in the bor-
ough that was large enough.

Except for Dec. 20 and Dec.
27, the alternate dates con-
flicted with. other shows. N CV.
29, for example, was open, but
it came directly after the
Baltimore show and it ap-
peared unlikely that exhibi—
tors would travel to the
Bronx, too, because of the
distance.

0

Dec. 27 was, of course, .in
the middle of the holiday sea-
son, so it was. discarded. Dec.
20 was only five days before
Christmas and thus a gamble,
but it was accepted.

The last all-breed show of
the year always has been the
Worcester County Kennel
Club event, which will be
held today. The remainder of
the month had been consid—
ered unsuitable for canine
competition because of the
many other activities that
occupy exhibitors. The Bronx
now has proved that a desir-

able date has been ignored

too long.

Mrs. Bowden said that she
was amazed when she heard
the final entry. She couldn’t
account for its size, but
thought that many exhibitors
who were coming to New
York anyway decided to Show
their dogs. Some of the
breeds have really Solid en-
tries. They include 74 German
shepherds, 72 dachshunds, 79
poodles, 64 rough collies and
eight of‘ the seldom seen
smooth variety, and 29 St.
Bernards, which is good in
the breed.

A first-class judging slate
undoubtedly has helped. It
includes Elsworth S. Howell
as the best-in-show judge,
William L. Kendrick in the
sporting group, Alva Rosen-
berg for the hounds and
workers, Henry H. Stoecker
for the terriers, Mrs. Edith
Nash Hellerman for the toys
and Iris de la Torre Bueno for
the non-sporting dogs.

The American. Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals offers. several sug—
gestions to those who are
considering dogs and other
pets for Christmas. Here are
some:

‘llIf you are giving a pet to
a child outside your own
family, be sure the child
wants and is ready for a pet
and the parents approve.

(lIf for yourself, get a good
book on pets and their care
beforehand.

tllAs a rule, children under
five are not ready for a live
pet. Handling of pets by
older children should be su—
pervised.

‘llTake into consideration
the size, breed and disposition
of the animal, the size of the
home or apartment and the
age of the children.

(llDon’t hang the animal in
a stacking or even pack him
in a box under a tree.

‘llDogs make ideal pets for
children, but young puppies
can’t fend for themselves.
Gilt a dog at least six months
01 .

‘lTell the children a tail is.
not a. leash. .

COVER: Beautifully exemplifying the
French Flair in New York is Mme. Le-
gendre, wife of the French Consul Gen-
eral, seen here in a salon of the Fifth
Avenue consulate. Her evening gown is
a Jacques Heim creation in heavy tur-
quoise silk with crystal strips deﬁning
the neckline and dropping in horizontal
lines to the ﬂoor. With it, she wears Car-
tier’s magnificent necklace of 52 round,
47 marquise and 43 pear shaped dia-
monds, with matching earclips and a
tapered bracelet. (For more about this
best-dressed hostess in New York and her

gance” by Edward M. Seay, P. 27.)

French Flair Promotes
Return to Elegance

By EDWARD M. SEAY

UNTIL World War I, it was the accepted,

entirely traditional thing for distinguished
entertaining to be done in the replicas of
French Chateaux and English manor houses,
then dwelt in at least part of the year by
New York’s golden set. Hosts and hostesses
invariably gave minute attention to all details
of the food, Wine and décor for their dinners
and balls. The hurly-burly era of the speak-
easy, the subsequent craze of younger adven-
turous socialites for dining and dancing in
public cafés, and, ﬁnally, the wholesale de-
struction of town house-s, were some of the
forces that brought about the decline of enter-
taining in an elegant manner. Buffet dinners,
catered by outside help, became popular after
World War II, with dinner dances taking
place in smart hotels. But too many cocktails,
a hodgepodge of guests, mediocre food and
casually chosen wines caused lacklustre par-
ties, which would have dismayed the fashion-
able world before 1914.,

All this is a preface to the happier news
that, in recent years, leading hosts and host-
esses are once again giving painstaking care
to their guest lists, and planning parties for
the exchange of ideas in beautiful settings,
while not trusting to chance where the food
and wines are concerned.

Many frequenters of the social circuit feel
that the renascence of civilized entertaining
can be signiﬁcantly attributed to distinguished
foreign diplomatic hostesses, whose specialized
éclat has influenced party giving all over

America.

Cnpitni ts tinct‘ion

In Washington, best-dressed Mme. Hervé
Alphand, wife of the French Ambassador,
has won wide acclaim as an outstanding
hostess Whose carefully planned dinners,
receptions and balls are the acme of taste
and imagination, delighting the guests and
effectively promoting the prestige of La Belle
France. Furthermore, Mme. Alphand, who
never passes up an opportunity to fete visiting
French officials, artists, and designers, also
makes powerful American friends for her
homeland by lending her time and specialized
support to their own cultural programs.

A stellar symbol of this exceptional co-

operation was the 1964 Opera Ball at the

November 196-4

plomat '

Eden of Forezgn Horterrer

Hm Notable Inﬂuence on

Entertaining in A mem'cu

French Embassy. Hundreds enjoyed the ter-
race-and-garden gala that swelled the coffers
of the Washington Opera Society and made
history as one of the most successful beneﬁts
ever given in the capital city. And currently,
Mme. Alphand is busy on another big-league
American fund raiser. She is honorary chair-
man of the 1964 National Symphony Ball.

In the meantime, the soignee diplomatic
hostess who negotiates the most active party
calendar on Embassy Row has launched a
series of dinners, dances, luncheons and cock-
tail parties that will keep the French Embassy
in the social forefront all season.

Just to give you an idea—her October
calendar included a cocktail party for French
designers of accessories carried in the new
Saks Fifth Avenue store in Chevy Chase, a
small dance following the October 9 perform-
ance of Zizi Jeanmaire’s Ballets de Paris at
the National, another small dance on October
23 after a presentation of Guy Laroche’s most
recent Paris collection, and a similar show the
next day to beneﬁt theéﬂniﬁrgﬂaﬁlaWelfarglnsti-

.Jt‘lIEz. 16 dinners and luncheons, and four more

cocktail parties.

In New York, meanwhile, UN diplomats
and the foreign consular contingent have had
a noticeable effect on the social picture, and
Mme. Legendre, wife of the French Consul
General, is effectively following Mme.
Alphand’s example as a foreign hostess in
America Who does her nation and her hus-
band credit by her ﬂair for promoting the
haute couture with her own wardrobe and
also by entertaining with distinction.

Curious to learn how Mme. Legendre had
so quickly attained her place as one of the
city’s outstanding hostesses, and whether this
position was achieved at personal sacriﬁce
or was a happy state rather than a burden,
we were glad to have the opportunity of meet-
ing the consul general’s wife in the private
quarters of the Fifth Avenue consulate, where
the Legendres have resided for less than two
years.

Wearing a Nina Ricci ensemble, a white
shantung blouse and pleated skirt, with cuffs

at the hem “like a man’s trousers,” the dark-
eyed hostess was the epitome of chic as we
chatted in the drawing room, the predominant
color of which is beige with cinnamon and
apricot gradations. Magniﬁcent bouquets of
ﬂowers, personally arranged by the hostess,
and chairs upholstered in pale blue satin
(“generally becoming to a brunette,” said
Mme. Legendre), enhanced the setting of
French antique furniture and a catholic selec-
tion of French art. The valuable furnishings
and art of the consulate came from France
but were personally chosen by her; 'and a
number of especially attractive objects were
inheritances from either her husband’s family

or her own.

Splendor in New York

Entertaining on a scale in keeping with her
husband’s position naturally is a challenge,
but an interesting one, cheerfully conceded
our vivacious hostess. “It’s a privilege to
have friendly Americans in to meet important
visitors from France and to lend support to
F rench-American charitable and cultural
efforts. But whether the party is large or
small, I do the marketing, choose the wines,
arrange the flowers and supervise place cards.

“It is not an easy task, because we have so
many receptions and dinners. We entertain
for Americans, visitors from France and mem-
bers of the French colony in New York. When
La Jeanne D’Arc was in port, for example,
we gave a reception for 800 in honor of the
ship’s ofﬁcers and cadets. When the Theatre
de France company opened on Broadway last
season, we gave supper parties for 350 to
400 guests after the opening night of “Le
Mariage de Figaro” and after the perform-ance
of “La Vie Parisienne.”

Mme. Legendre gayly dismissed the fame
of these supper parties, the splendor of which
has exceeded anything New York society has
witnessed since the epoch of Mrs. Astor, Mrs.
Cornelius Vanderbilt and associate society
queens. For “Le Mariage de Figaro” party,
three ﬂoors of the consulate were lighted by
candles and the reception rooms were hung
with rare tapestries and paintings by such
eighteenth century French artists as Boucher
and Greuze, many borrowed from notable col-
lections for the evening. The costume designs
for the play, the work of Yves St. Laurent,

decorated the spiral stairwells.

For the party following the performance
of “La Vie Parisienne” the paintings of nine-
teenth century artists, Bonnard, Toulouse-
Lautrec and Boldini, to name a few, added
interest to the scene. Mme. Madeleine Renaud
and Jean-Louis Barrault and their associates
in the French acting company could not have
been introduced to some of the city’s leading
ﬁgures in a more distinguished manner. Mme.
Legendre’s renown as a hostess was ﬁrmly

established.

One is easily aware that acclaim for her
taste in entertaining and in dress—~she’s
“mostly dressed” by Jacques Heim, but some-
times by Cardin and Nina Ricci—hasn’t
turned the head of this sensible young woman.
Such recognition is taken seriously only to
the extent that it contributes to world esteem

for French taste.
Despite pressing ofﬁcial duties, Mme.

Legendre ﬁnds time to be with her three
children as much as most mothers. Her
dark eyes glowed as she described Patrice
(“ten years old and so naughty and rest-
less”), Véronique (“seven, and a dear”),
and Laurianne (“our sweet little one of two
years”).

They had had a happy summer in France,
she said, spending one month in their eigh-
teenth century home in Burgundy, between
Sens and Auxerre. “An old priory, built in the
eighteenth century, its architecture is more
of the seventeenth century,” she said “and
the Louis XIII furniture we inherited from
our families suits it well. Our children were
so happy there. The rooms are large and
there is a mysterious attic for the children
to explore. There they could ‘dress up’ and in
the ﬁeld they could pick ﬂowers or ride. The
children also enjoyed the seaside with their
grandmother in Brittany, and so did we.”

Asked for her formula of combining a
successful public life with a happy family
life, the beautiful Chatelaine said, “It is neces-
sary to know the goal one wishes to reach,
and I am fortunate in being able to make
quick decisions on most matters. For example,
once a week, accompanied by our butler and
our cook—she’s from the Basque country and
superbly capable—l do all the marketing for
the consulate. l have to make up my mind
quickly. I can’t afford mistakes.”

It also is apparent that Mme. Legendre
had no difficulty deciding whom to marry.
She met M. Legendre at a ball in Morocco
and fell in love at once. “After twelve years
of being wedded, it’s not so had,” was her
softly spoken understatement, as her eyes

sparkled mischievously. W

Dear Mr. Elwood:

Thanks for sending us a copy of LADY'S CIRCLE with
the article about Miss. Havoc. I am sorry that your editor
did not send me the article for checking as she promised to
do on both occasions when I spoke to her by ‘ phone. We
feel it is extremely regrettable that mothers should have been
told to punish their children severely. This negates the whole
humane approach, and we certainly would not make such a
recommendation.

We are disturbed, too. by the fact that some of ”the
quotations are not accurate. I know that your editor rewrote
the article so I am not blaming you for these things, and I hepe
that the article may do some good by calling attention to the
problems. I am only sorry that it was so difficult to work with
your editor, for now we cannot work to call attention to the
article as we had planned to do.

I hope you won't be discouraged by this. but we have
no alternative. Your kind interest in humane; treatment of
animals is appreciated very much.

Sincerely ,

Christine Stevens
President

Humane Legislation Gets a Boost

 

Animalsi Tale Going to the Top

MILLIONS of animals en-
dure needless pain in the
course of so-called scientific
experiments and their
plight will be taken to the
President and the Vice Pres-
ident of the United States.

Mrs. Roger Steven's, wife
of President Johnson’s Spe-
cial Assistant on Cultural
Affairs, urged women at-
tending a meeting yesterday
at the Women’s City Club,
to write directly to Presi—
dent Johnson and Vice
President Humphrey in sup-
port of humane legislation
now pending before Con-
gress, notably S 1071, known
as the Clark Bill.

"Animals need the pro-
tection of law even more
than we do,” said Mrs.
Stevens, who is president of
the Animal Welfare Insti-
tute 1n ew or 1y.

Mrs. Stevens is also see-
retary of the Society for
Animal Protective Legisla-
tion in New York.

“THE PLIGHT of animals

unprotected by law is des~
perate because they cannot
even speak,” Mrs. Stevens
added. “I want to appeal to
all of you here today to help

bring an end to terrible
and completely needless
abuses that are taking place
in laboratories throughout
our Nation even as I speak
to you.”

She said that 89 years ago
Great Britain took the step
which Congress is only now
contemplating in the Clark
Bill. The bill would regulate
animal experiments, license

experimental biologists, pro- .

vide for unannounced in-
spection, introduce ' pain-
curbing provisions and in.”
s'ist upon humane "care and
housing of experimental
animals. .

SHERRY REED, who re-
signed as a teacher in Be-
thesda, to enter the humane
movement, is new writing a
manual to be used in Amer-
ican public schools to teach

children to treat animals
with kindness. ’

Mrs. Reed presented some
staggering statistics on the
number of unwanted tabbies
and homeless. Rovers how
roaming America._

She said that there are 90
million dogs and cats in the
United States for the 48 mil-
lion human families. There
are 25 million homeless cats,
and 50 million kittens are
being bred each year. There
are 15 million homeless
dogs. and 15 million puppies
are being born annually.

“THE ROOT of most
cruelty to animals is in 'per-
mitting dogs and cats to
breed needlessly year after
year,” she said. '

Mrs. Reed assailed rodeos
as a source of animal cruel—
ty, too. The so-called “wild

"animals” in such shows are

as mild and tame as any cow
or riding horse until the
cruelty of the bucking strap
inflicts excrutiating pain
upon them, she said.

Water pollution which can starve sea
birds by the thousands and kill ﬁsh by
the millions is not beyond the power of

1 individuals to combat. What follows is
quoted from the 13th annual report of

the Ammal‘ﬁtemaalasmyts 22 E. 17th
St., New York: ' ‘

“A major conservation discovery with
important humane implication-s is a chem-
ical that separates oil from salt .water. Its
use was begun this year by three of the
biggest oil companies. Formerly, ballast
water was pumped overboard before tak-
ing on a new oil cargo. Now it is treated
with a demulsiﬁer, and the oily residue
which has caused the death of . . . sea
birds when dumped into the sea, is re-
tained on board.”

What" could the individualdo, to compel
all oil transpOrters to adapt this practice?

 

For Cleaner Wafers

 

  
     

Write your congressman, insisting: “It
ought to be made a law.”

“In the ﬁeld of water pollution,” the ‘
Institute report continues, the U. ‘8. Dept.‘
of Health, Education & Welfare identiﬁed

. the chemicals responsible for the
killing of millions of ﬁsh in the lower
Mississippi . . Though the individual
citizen is powerless to prevent agricul-
tural use of these dangerous pesticides
. . he can contribute to the general
effort by refusing to buy detergents which
contain alkyl benzene sulfonate (ABS) the
most toxic and long-lasting component of
about 85 per cent of all detergents. There
is no known way to remove ABS from
water once it has entered a stream.”

In other words, we can keep our waters
clean; we can help restore waters which
now are polluted, if enough of us, as in-
dividuals, will lend Our hands to the task. -

Chicago 11, ILL,

Dear Sir: I have on my desk a letter to Mrs. Marion Parks
Grey, in which you say that you will forward c0pies of her
letter to those ”in a position to influence public thinking".

I wonder if you would also see fit to do the same with a letter
of mine? I am drafting a reply to a silly letter that Mrs. Grey
sent to me dated December 15th (a carbon cepy) in which she
made ridiculous mis- statements about what was discussed on
a program of mine the morning of November 14th.

I called Mrs. Grey to discuss this matter, and she twice hung
up the phone on me. She only said that she listened to two-
fifths of the program, decided in her omnipotent fashion that
she knew the contents of the rest, and switched off. Her letter
is full of lies and half—truths, and I am demanding an apology
from her. How a silly woman like this can ever take on a pos-
ition with any organization is beyond me. She is so filled with
hate and prejudice that she cannot operate on a logical basis.

It is a pity that such an organization is represented by such a silly
woman, and that alone would keep me from ever joining or ever
again attempting to assist said organization. All I demand of
anyone on my program is integrity, and Mrs. Grey has exhibited
such a lack of this quality that I find I am necessarily opposed
to allowing her or anyone like/hereto appear on my show.

Sir:

Your letter of December let concerning correspondence with Mrs . Marion
Parks Grey is somewhat puzzling for two reasons:

l--l have no recollection whatever of any recent correspondence with Mrs. Gray:
our files do not show c0pies of any correspondence with her, and I assure you
that we keep accurate and complete records on everything . (I have to make
one qualification: December is our busiest month; we handle approximately
25, 000 pieces of mail in about 20 days, employing temporary help, not
always the most efficient. I could have forgotten and letters could have
been misfiled, but that seems to stretch the long arm of coincidence too much.)

2--If any TV or radio show is so offensive to us we feel moved to protest, and
especially if we ask our members to join in that protest, it seems unlikely
I would not remember it. I am sorry to be so unflattering, but the truth is
(living in Chicago and having no radio or time to listen) I do not recall ever
hearing your name or anything about your show . l

The fact remains, however, that you say you have on your desk a copy of a letter
I wrote Mrs . Grey, presumably about your show. I am certain your office must be
well equipped with copying machines . Could we not solve the mystery by the simple
expedient of making a copy of my letter to which you refer and sending it to me?

This society acts as a sort of clearing house of information for all anti-vivisection
organizations in the country. We provide them with current information on matters
of importance to the movement, such as reports of new and horrible experiments,
introduction of and action on, state and national legislation affecting animal
welfare, etc. Occasionally, when the subject is of tremendous importance, we
do mimeograph certain letters and send copies to a selected mailing list of
editors, radio and TV commentators, legislators, ministers and educators . But
when we do so we always make a number of permanent photostat copies for our
files, one of which is submitted to our attorneys before the original is mailed.
This special file shows nothing has been sent out under Mrs. Gray's signature

or on the letterhead of the. organization she heads . I await some further word

from you and you have my assurance that we, too, believe in “equal time . “

Yours sincerely,

KWC WM

I believe the cause of humane treatment of animals
has been helned verv much here, because don club members have
at last been aiven a correct insight into the nroblem.

I am enclosing two conies of mv Thursdav last dog

I think half the staff came over vesterdav to ask-~in an
aside-~how I managed to get that last column through.
09 course, I had advance aareement that l could report as
news what vou had to sav. But also, the citv editor, who
is detailed to censor mv column, was too busv with the election
to check it. (It went through at a time When the naner was
using all its facilities to ﬂat a Final result on the Young-
Taft race. Youna won, and I am happy about that. You won't
have to convince the Ohio senator over again. v

Again, I thank vou more than I can sav, or write.

Dogs’ and cats’ best friends are

by Evelyn E. Smith

HE United States, according to ‘
recent reports, is going to th
dogs—and the cats and the parake
and the tropical ﬁsh. We’ve beco
a pet-conscious nation, where
proximately a billion and a half
lars a year are spent on our fu .
feathered and ﬁnny friends. Every
thing from ﬂavored animal treats to
pet toiletries has become very big
business.

While pet lovers are busily laying
out the cash for the rhinestone col-
lars and the scratching posts, a whole
group of organizations, usually no
further away than the Yellow Pages,
are thereto aid with the more vital
problems. What are the animal—aid
societies, and what do they do? Ar
they, like so many anti-pet people
think, social societies directed by
dowagers, or cult groups inhabited
by wild-eyed fanatics?

Fanatical they’re not, though soc-
ial status might be enhanced by
membership in the one society that
most Americans seem to think is the
only humane society—the American
Society for Prevention of Cruelty to

CORONET

 




people who have organized societies to prevent cruelty to animals

Animals. But in recent years the
A.S.P.C.A.—a local organization,
' hartered by New York State, but
niting its sphere of Operations
7)» to New York City—~has radi-
1y declined. Once the standard
er of the humane societies, the
'.C.A., according to the Bulletin
_. e Humane Society of the United
states is at this time, “preeminently
‘a tax collector,
pound master.”
. What the H.S.U.S. means is that
if you happen to live in New York
. City and own a dog, the dog’s license
-. is bought from the A.S.P.C.A. The
A.S.P.C.A. keeps all the money ac-
jcumulated'from licenses, a tidy sum
of approximately $1.3 million dol-
ars .a year, and in return runs the
local pounds for the City.
“However, the A.S.P.C.A.—which
h=asialso been charged with incidents
of neglect by other humane societies,
notably the Animal Welfare Institute
———does notexemplify the animal-aid
groups. For help with his pet prob—
lem, the average owner can still turn
with assurance to almost any one of
the humane societies.
The history of humane organiza-

DECEMBER 1964

dog catcher and,

tions is a long one, with the
A.S.P.C.A.—founded in 1866—be-
ing the oldest. In 1867, the Pennsyl-
vania S.P.C.A. was formed and in
1868 the society that is held as a
model for other humane groups, the
international Massachusetts S.P.C.A.
came into being.

Most celebrated of the M.S.P.C.A.’s
early activities were the Bands of
Mercy, taken over from the English
idea of enlisting children in the bat-
tle against animal mistreatment. The
children were given identiﬁcation
cards to lend them authority, and
the impression left with us of little

golden-haired tots ﬁercely demand-

ing that brutal men stOp beating ani-
mals is based on fact. Today, the
Bands of Mercyhave become Junior
Humane Leaguesand are under the
auspices-of the M.S.P.C.A.’s allied
society, the American Humane Edu-
cation Society. The eﬂ‘icient little
citizens of yesteryear can now, how-
ever, back up their demands, not
with tears, but with the law.

In addition to operating several
animal hospitals, advising the local
pet owner on pet problems and in-
vestigating complaints of cruelty, the

107

 




M.S.P.C.A. houses stray pets and
unwanted animals. Anyone who
wants to obtain a dog just tunes in
to the M.S.P.C.A.’s Saturday morn—
ing radio program and listens to the
descriptions of the dogs up for adop-
tion. The M.S.P.C.A. also operates
a rest farm for animals and a pet
cemetery, while internationally it
runs a shelter in Fez, Morocco—one
especially designed for the relief of
mistreated mules. Also, in South
America, the M.S.P.C.A. is cooper-
ating with the Dutch government in
trying to save the wildlife in Dutch
Guiana, threatened by the construc-
tion of a dam.

While the A.S.P.C.A. is a local
society, and the M.S.P.C.A. an in—
ternational society, the ﬁrst national
society was the American Humane
Association, founded in 1877. This,

along with the American Humane
Education Society, were the only na—
tional organizations until after World
War 11. At that time a number of

other societies were established.
While it is impossible to describe
each of the many humane organiza-
tions’ activities, most of them are
dedicated in principle to the same
general objectives. These include:
humane education; restricting the ex-
cess animal pOpulation; improvement
of local pounds and shelters; humane
handling and sl-Eughtering of food
animals; protection of animals in
show business; wildlife protection;
protection of animals in transit; and
humane treatment of animals used
in laboratories.

Whenever man meets animal, at
least one of the humane societies is
there to see that the man doesn’t mis—

108

4-,».

use the animal. When it comes to
sports such as hunting and trapping,
for example, the humane organiza-
tions recognize that man is going to
take to the wilderness with gun and
trap, whether they approve or not.
But they feel that brutal methods of
catching wild animals can be elimi-
nated. The American Humane Asso-
ciation has a standing reward for a
trap that will eliminate animal suffer-
ing without reducing the trap’s effec-
tiveness or putting it beyond the
means of most trappers.

Not all Americans catch their
meat on the hoof, but most of them
do eat meat. And, for half a cer
tury, the humane societies have be ‘
attempting to get legislation pas.
that would provide for hum
slaughtering. In 1958, they
most of their ﬁght and a bill ..
passed which became effective in‘
1962. The Federal law applies just
to those packers who deal with
the Federal government or who en-
gage in interstate commerce. A num-
ber of small packers don’t come un-
der the Federal regulations, only j
state regulations—~—which, so far, have
been passed by only 15 states. (Inci-'
dentally, in 1964, France followed
our lead by passing a humane slaugh
ter bill, which is known as the “Brig-‘
itte Bardot Bill” because of the ﬁlm
star’s intensive efforts in its behalf.)

For the average animal owner who
stays at home, pets the cat and walks
the dog to the nearest ﬁre hydrant,
the' humane societies are a fountain
of vital information. The American
Humane Education Society, for ex-
ample, specializes in various educa-
tional activities.

Friends of Animals, a national
society, is the place to ask for help
if you want to have a female dog or
cat spayed. If the animal is a mixed-
breed, Friends of Animals will offer
ﬁnancial assistance. They have ar-
ranged a program in cooperation
with 250 veterinarians throughout
the country, who accept reduced fees
as their contribution to the humane
movement. In cases of purebreds, the
society can only, however, offer in—
formation and encouragement.

The stated purpose of this unique
society—sponsored by such people
s Cleveland Amory, June Havoc,

annie Hurst and James Mason—is

make America “a nation without a

le homeless cat or dog.” One of

ooals is to get legislation passed

will allow tax-supported shelters

.ting under contract to city or
county governments to spay female
animals.

Even show business comes in for
its share of scrutiny from the hu—
mane organizations. Stop worrying
the next time you see a Western and
the hero’s horse tumbles in a chase
across the prairie. According to a
‘ provision of the Motion Picture
Code, the American Humane Asso—
ciation—a society that has probably
done more than any other to improve
the lot of show business animals—-
must be consulted whenever a script
calls for animal participation. And
an A.H.A. representative must be on
hand whenever animal action is
ﬁlmed. As one Hollywood stunt man
wistfully put it: “I only wish there
were an organization to take as good
care of us.”

The show biz—conscious A.H.A.

DECEMBER 1964

doesn’t stop with the movies, though.
It also has a Nationwide Inspection
Program for traveling animals—es-
pecially those in carnivals and cir—
cuses. And each year it awards a
“Patsy.” This “Performing Animal
TV Star of the Year” award goes to
outstanding animal thespians.

Besides the “Patsy,” the A.H.A.
gives an award for people who have
risked their lives for animals, as well
as an award for animals who have
risked their lives for people. This
type of award is fairly common
among the societies, but the A.H.A.
was the ﬁrst to offer one, and its
award is probably the best known.
Their very ﬁrst award was given in
1901 to John Doerﬁinger, for risk-
ing his life to save a dog trapped on
the New York City el tracks. A more
recent award went to Gretchen, a
California Weimaraner for “devotion
and bravery in defending her crip-
pled master from wild animals” dur-
ing a seven-day ordeal in the Mojave
Desert.

All the humane organizations are
anti-cruelty organizations, and the
real “hot potato” in recent years
when it comes to cruelty to animals,
is the use of animals in laboratories.
Except for the anti-vivisection soci-
eties—notably the National Anti—
Vivisection Society—all the humane
societies accept the use of animals
for scientiﬁc purposes. Recognizing
the need to experiment on animals,
the organizations’ objections are to
certain methods of obtaining the
animals and their treatment in the
laboratories.

Already the demand for laboratory
animals has grown so great that the

 




traﬁ‘ic isn’t always in strays. In 1963,
the New York State Police recovered
18 “dog-napped” animals in Oneida
and Herkimer counties. According
to the H.S.U.S., “There is a highly
organized complex of dog thieves
operating in Maryland, Virginia,
West Virginia and Pennsylvania, with
edges of the traﬂic reaching out into
Ohio, Kentucky and New York
State.” ,

As for how the animals are treated
by the laboratories, what the public
doesn’t realize, according to the soci-
eties, is the appalling conditions in
which so many research animals are
kept unnecessarily.

Testimony as to the treatment of
laboratory animals comes not only
from inspectors of the animal-aid or-
ganizations, but from the scientists
themselves. For example, Dr. Robert
C. Bay, formerly veterinarian in
charge of a group of dogs at the Uni-
versity of 'Utah’s College of Medi-
cine, resigned after being refused
permission to give mercy killing to
dogs “needlessly suffering great pain
from irradiation.” Dr. Bay said he
found it “extremely disgusting . . .
that some animals are so needlessly
wasted in biological teaching demon-
strations and in actual research
simply because the condition of the
animal is so deplorable . . . at the
time it is used.”

Experiments are often needlessly
cruel. Anesthesia is carelessly admin-
istered and far too much use is being
made of curare, which paralyzes the
animal, making it unable to move or
cry out while still able to feel pain.

Thus the humane societies are
working for improved treatment of

110

laboratory animals. The H.S.U.S. is
especially active in this area. In the
1950’s, still another organization,
the Animal Welfare Institute, was
founded, and this society, according
to its president, Mrs. Christine Stev-
ens, has “devoted 'the major part of
its resources to studying the treat-
ment of experimental animals in this
country and to improving that treat—
ment by the means now available.”
What the societies hope to achieve
is the passage of humane legislation
—similar to that enacted in England
in 1876. Humanitarians all over the
world are in favor of such legislation. .,
Albert Schweitzer, for example, ha
stated that he gladly gives his “su
port to the law for compassion L
ward laboratory animals. The e ‘
of Reverence for Life obliges
be watchful always to treat ani
with compassion, and all the more
so when it concerns those creatures
that serve medical research.”
Another sponsor of humane legis-
lation was the late Rachel Carson
who said that, “Our national con-
science demands that standards be
set up for prOper laboratory condi-
tions, for avoiding unnecessary ex—
periments and for the humane con-
duct of experiments actually carried
out.” 1,
Actually, the humane societies d‘b
not seem to be asking for very much
in the way of regulation. Of the ten
bills before Congress only four are
considered adequate—the Clark-
Neuberger, the Ashley, the Rhodes
and the Randball. What these four
would call for is: unannounced in-
spection by qualiﬁed inspectors; 1i-
censing of all scientists by the gov-

ernment—with the right to remove
said licenses for inhumane treatment;
pain-curbing provisions; humane
care and housing; the keeping of
identiﬁcation records and brief an—
nual reports; and the distinction be-
tween the work of qualiﬁed scientists
and that of students—which must be
painless.

This last provision seems strange
until it is realized that recently the
high-schoolers have donned white
masks and gowns and consider them-
selves scientists. Students in a New
Jersey school were injecting live can—
cer virus into a chicken, while a bio-
gy teacher in the Midwest a few

,ars ago dissected a half-anesthe—

ed and screaming kitten before his

ss.
hile Federal regulation would
,' be applicable to high schools, it

would do away with much of the
ﬂagrant mistreatment of animals. As
for the teen—agers, the humane soci-

eties have in some instances been
able to halt youthful experimenta-
tion. As a result of their efforts, for
example, surgery on live dogs in the
Texas public schools was stopped.

The American who-owns a dog or
a cat or a bird or any species consid-
‘ ered animal should not hesitate to
"call a local animal-aid society for

help. Accustomed to dealing with
two-legged owners, the humane peo-
ple are sensible and unﬂustered by
any query or situation.

Not long ago a young couple
wanted to mate their wire—haired
terrier. Having located the proper
male and computed the exact time
almost down to the hour, the two
dogs were placed together. The fe-
male promptly laid down in one cor-
ner and the male sat in the other. As
the owners of the male, the female,
the upstairs neighbor, and the down-
stairs neighbor waited for the dogs
to do the expected, the canines simply
sat.

Finally, in desperation, the local
humane society was called. After lis-
tening to the rather embarrassing
problem, the woman at the other
end offered a simple suggestion—
privacy. She was right—the young
couple now have three puppies!

The animal-aid organizations are
performing a service and attempting
to fulﬁll a real need in our society.
It should be remembered that—as
the Christian Science Monitor stated
in an editorial: “Man’s inhumanity
to man is not so separate from his
inhumanity to animals that he can
afford to ignore the latter. Mercy is
not divisible.” 3

FRENCH TYPICAL

A French teacher had a young student who was laboriously learn-
ing to speak the language. One day she asked the student, “What is the
difference between madame and mademoiselle?”

The hopeful reply was: “monsieur?”

RACHEL CARSON AWARDED ALBERT SCHWEITZER MEDAL

Courtesy, INFORMATION REPORT, Animal Welfare Institute

The Schweitzer Medal for 1962 will be awarded to Miss Rachel Carson,
author of Silent Spring, in recognition of her contribution to the protection of
vertebrate animals from needless suffering and death resulting from excessive
use of dangerous insecticides. The medal will be presented at the annual meet-
ing of the Institute on january 7, by Dr. Robert Bushman Murphy.

Miss Carson’s previous books, The Edge of the Sea and The Sea Around
Us, expressed great understanding and appreciation for nature, and in Silent
Spring she shows why nature, including man, must be protected from the most
massive, deliberate poisoning the earth has ever received.

Those who would like to continue and even increase the wholesale spread-
ing of the chlorinated hydrocarbons and other highly toxic substances have
tried, by a variety of means, to counteract the powerful effect that Silent Spring
has had on readers. In a speech before the Women’s National Press Club,
December 5, Miss Carson replied to her critics and has given permission to
reproduce her speech in full below.

The reports by the National Academy of Sciences Committee on pesti-
cides were characterized, in the pages of the Atlantic Naturalist, as represent-
ing an American type of Lysenkoism, an unscientific distortion presented in the
guise of a responsible report. Miss Carson makes reference to this, and we have
quoted a second well-informed source, The Wilson Bulletin, on the same subject
immediately following the text of her speech.

* * 9:

MY text this afternoon is taken from

the Globe Times of Bethlehem,
Pennsylvania, a news item in the issue
of October 12. After describing in de-
tail the adverse reactions to Silent
Spring of the farm bureaus in two
Pennsylvania counties, the reporter
continued: “No one in either county
farm office who was talked to today

PAGE 6

had read the book, but all disapproved
of it heartily.”

This sum-s up very neatly the back-
ground ‘of much of the noisier com-
ment that has been heard in this
unquiet autumn following the publi-
cation of Silent Spring. In the words
of an editorial in the Bennington Ban-
ner, “The anguished reaction to Si-

NATURAL FOOD AND FARMING

 




Those who favor the widespread use of pesticides
have attempted to discredit Miss Carson and her
book. Here is her reply in the form of a speech to
the Women’s National Press Club, December 5.

Replies To Her Critics

By RACHEL CARSON

lent Spring has been to refute state—
ments that were never made.” Wheth-
er this kind of refutation comes from
people who actually have not read
the book or from those who find it
convenient to misrepresent my posi—
tion, I leave it to others to judge.

Early in the summer—as soon as
the first installment of the book ap—
peared in the New Yorker—public
reaction to Silent Spring was reflected
in a tidal wave of letters—letters to
Congressmen, to newspapers, to Gov-
ernment agencies, to the author. These
letters continue to come and I am
sure represent the most important and
lasting reaction.

Early Reaction

Even before the book was pub-
lished, editorials and columns by the
hundred had discussed it all over the
country. Early reaction in the chemi-
cal press was somewhat moderate,
and in fact I have had fine support
from some segments of both chemical
and agricultural press. But in general,
as was to be expected, the industry
press was not happy. By late summer
the printing presses of the pesticide
industry (and their trade associations
had begun to pour out the first of a
growing stream of booklets designed
to protect and repair the somewhat
battered image of pesticides. Plans are
announced for quarterly mailings to
opinion leaders and for monthly news
stories to newspapers, magazines, ra—

MAY 1963

dio and television. Speakers are ad—
dressing audiences everywhere.

It is clear that we are all to receive
heavy doses of tranquilizing informa-
tion, designed to lull the public into
the sleep from which Silent Spring so
rudely awakened it. Some definite
gains toward a saner policy of pest
control have been made in recent
months. The important issue now is
whether we are to hold and extend
those gains.

Pattern of Attack

The attack is now falling into a def-
inite pattern and all the well known
devices are being used. One obvious
way to try to weaken a cause is to
discredit the person who champions
it. So the masters of invective and
insinuation have been busy: I am a
“bird lover—a cat lover—a fish
lover”—a priestess of nature—a de-
votee of a mystical cult having to do
with laws of the universe which my
critics consider themselves immune to.

Another well known, and much used,

device is to misrepresent my position
and attack the things I have never

said. I shall not belabor the obvious.

Anyone who has really read the book
knows that I favor insect control in
appropriate situations, that I do not
advocate complete abandonment of
chemical control, and that I criticize
the modern chemical method not be-

seem that these algae to a marked de-
gree govern the quality of the protein
that correctly grown produce carries

Invisible Friends

So, when we are working our soils,
whether in a small garden or on a
large field, let us not forget those
invisible little friends down there un-
der our feet. Though we cannot see
them easily, together with the soil
fungi they continuously radiate a
rich, challenging aroma that is out-
standingly evident once we learn to

because it controls them badly and
inefficiently and creates many danger-
ous side effects in doing so. I criticize
the present methods because they are
based on a rather low level of scien—
tific thinking. We are capable of much
great-er sophistication in our solution
of the problem.
Public Reassured

Another piece in the pattern of at-
tack largely ignores Silent Spring and
concentrates on what I suppose would
be called the soft sell, the soothing reas—
surances to the public. Some of these
acknowledge the correctness of my
facts, but say that the incidents I
reported occurred some time in the
past, that industry and Government
are well aware of them and have long
since taken steps to prevent their re-
currence. It must be assumed that the
people who read these comforting re-
ports read nothing else in their news-

papers. Actually, pesticides have fig-
ured rather prominently in the news
in recent months: some items trivial,
some almost humorous, some definitely
serious.

These reports do not differ in any
important way from the examples I
cited in Silent Spring, so if the situa-
tion is under better control there is
little evidence of it.

Pesticides in the News

What are some of the ways pesti-
cides have made recent news?

(1) The New York Post of October
12 reported the seizure by the Food
and Drug Administration of more than
a quarter of a million pounds of pota-
toes—346,000 pounds to be exact—
in the Pacific Northwest. Agents said
they contained about 4 times the per-
mitted residues of aldrin and dieldrin.

(2) In September, Federal investi-
gators had to look into the charge that
vineyards near the Erie County thru-
way had been damaged by weed-killer
chemicals sprayed along the highway.
Similar reports came from Iowa.

(3) In California, fumes from
lawns to which a chemical had been
applied were so obnoxious that the
fire department was called to drench
the lawns with water. Thereupon the
fumes increased so greatly that 11
firemen were hospitalized.

(4) Last summer the newspapers
Widely reported the story of some 5000
Turkish children suffering from an af—
fliction called porphyria, characterized
by severe liver damage and the growth
of hair on face, hands and arms, giving
a monkey-like appearance to victims.
This was traced to the consumption
of wheat treated with a chemical
fungicide. The wheat had been in-
tended for planting, rather than for
direct consumption. But the people
were hungry and perhaps did not un-
derstand the restriction. This was an
unplanned occurrence in a far part of
the world but "it is well to remember
that large quantities of seed are simi-
larly treated here.

(5) You will remember that the
bald eagle, our national emblem, is

seriously declining in numbers. The
Fish and Wildlife Service recently re-
ported significant facts that may ex-
plain why this is so. The Service has
determined experimentally how much
DDT is required to kill an eagle. It
has also discovered that eagles found
dead in the wild have lethal doses of
DDT stored in their tissues.

(6) This fall also, Canadian papers
carried a warning that woodcock being
shot during the hunting season in New
Brunswick were carrying residues of
heptachlor and might be dangerous if
used as food. Woodcock are migratory
birds. Those that nest in New Bruns-
wick winter in the southern United
States, where heptachlor has been used
extensively in the campaign against
the fire ant. The residues in the birds
were three to 3.5 ppm. The legal tol-
erance for heptachlor is ZERO.

(7) Biologists of the Massachusetts
Fish and Game Department have re-
cently reported that fish in the Fram-
ingham Reservoir on the outskirts of
Boston contain DDT in amounts as
high as 75 ppm, or more than 10 times
the legal tolerance. This is, of course,
a public water supply for a large num-
ber of people.

(8) One more item—an Associated
Press dispatch of November 16: a sad
commentary on technology gone
wrong. A Federal Court Jury awarded
a New York State farmer $12,360 for
damages to his potato crop. The dam-
age was done by a chemical that was
supposed to halt sprouting. Instead,
the sprouts grew inward.

Inaccurate Statement

We are told also that chemicals are
never used unless tests have shown
them to be safe. This, of course, is not
an accurate statement. I am happy to
see that the Department of Agricul-
ture plans to ask the Congress to
amend the FIFRA to do away with
the provision that now permits -a com—
pany to register a pesticide under pro—
test, even though a question of health
or safety has been raised by the De—
partment.

We have other reminders that un-
safe chemicals get into use—County
Agents frequently have to amend or
rescind earlier advices on the use of
pesticides. For example, a letter was
recently sent out to farmers recalling
stocks of a chemical in use as a cattle
spray. In September, “unexplained
losses” occurred following its use. Sev-
eral suspected production lots were
recalled but the losses continued. All
outstanding lots of the chemical have
now had to be recalled.

lnaccuracies in Reviews

Inaccurate statements in reviews of
Silent Spring are a dime a dozen, and
I shall only mention one or two ex-
amples. Time, in its discussion of Si-
lent Spring, described accidental poi-
ssonings from pesticides as very rare.
Let’s look at a few figures. California,
the only state that keeps accurate and
complete records, reports from 900 to
1000 cases of poisoning from agricul-
tural chemicals per year. About 200
of these are from parathion alone.

Florida has experienced so many poi-
sonings recently that this state has at-
tempted to control the use of the more
dangerous chemicals in residential
areas. As a sample of conditions in
other countries, parathion was respon-
sible for 100 deaths in India in 1958
and takes an average of 336 deaths
a year in Japan.

It is also worthy of note that during
the years 1959, 1960 and 1961, air—
plane crashes involving crop—dusting
planes totaled 873. In these accidents
135 pilots lost their lives. This very
fact has lead to some significant re-
search by the Federal Aviation Agency
through its Civil Aeromedical Unit
—research designed to find out Why
so many of these planes crashed.
These medical investigators took as
their basic premise the assumption
that spray poisons accumulate in the
pilot’s body—inside the cells, where
they are difficult to detect.

Two Significant Facts

These researchers recently reported
that they had confirmed two very
significant facts: (1) That there is a
causal relation between the build—up
of toxins in the cell and the onset of
sugar diabetes. (2) That the build—up
of poisons within the cell interferes
with the rate of energy production in
the human body.

. I am, of course, happy to have this
confirmation that cellular processes
are not so “irrelevant” as a certain

 

scientific reviewer of Silent Spring has
declared them to be.

This same reviewer, writing in a
chemical journal, was much annoyed
with me for giving the sources of my
information. To identify the person
whose Views you are quoting is, ac-
cording to this reviewer, name-drape
ping. Well, times have certainly
changed since I received my training
in the scientific method at Johns Hop-
kins! My critic also profoundIy disap-
proved of my bibliography. The very
fact that it gave complete and specific
references fOr each important state-
ment was extremely distasteful to him.
Thi was padding to impress the unini-
ated with its length.

Purpose of References

Now I would like to say that in
Silent Spring I have never asked the
reader to take my word. I have given
him a very clear indication of my
sources. I make it possible for him—
indeed I invite him—to go beyond
what I report and get the full picture.
This is the reason for the 55 pages of
references. You cannot do this if you
are trying to conceal or distort or to
present half truths. ,

Another reviewer was offended be—
cause I made the statement that it is
customary for pesticide manufacturers
to support research on chemicals in

the universities. Now, this is just com-

mon knowledge and I can scarcely
believe the reviewer is unaware of it,

because his own university is among
those receiving such grants.

Widespread Practice

But since my statement has been
challenged, I suggest that any of you
who are interested make a few in—
quiries from representative universi-
ties. I am sure you will find out that
the practice is very widespread. Actu—
ally, a Visit to a good scientific library
will quickly establish the fact, for it
is still generally the custom for au-
thors of technical papers to acknowl—
edge the source of funds for the in-
vestigation. For example, a few gleaned
at random from the Journal of Eco-
nomic Entomology are as follows:

(1) In a paper from Kansas State
University, a footnote states: Partial
cost of publication of this paper was
met by the Chemagr‘o Corporation.

(2) From the University of Cali-
fornia Citrus Experimental Station:

The authors thank the Diamond Black-
FLeaf 'Co.,
grants-in—aid.
(3) University of Wisconsin: Re—
search was also supported in part by

Richmond, Virginia for

grants from the Shell Chemical Co.,
Velsicol Chemical Corporation and
Wisconsin Canners Association.

(4) Illinois Nat. Hist. Survey: This
investigation was sponsored by the
Monsanto Chem. Co. of St. Louis, Mo.

Industry Replaces Family

A penetrating observer of social
problems has pointed out recently
that whereas wealthy families once
were the chief benefactors of the Uni—
versities, now industry has taken over
this role. Support of education is
something no one quarrels with—but
this need not blind us to the fact that
research supported by pesticide manu-
facturers is not likely to be directed
at discovering facts indicating unfa-
vorable effects of pesticides.

Such a liaison between science and
industry is a growing phenomenon,
seen in other areas as well. The AMA,
through its newspaper, has just re—
ferred physicians to a pesticide trade
association for information to help
them answer patients’ questions about

PAGE 42

k

the effects of pesticides on man. I
am sure physicians have a need for
information on this subject. But I
would like to see them referred to
authoritative scientific or medical lit-
erature—not to a trade organization
whose business it is to promote the
sale of pesticides.

"Sustaining Associates"

We see scientific societies acknowl—
edging as “sustaining associates” a
dozen or more giants of a related in-
dustry. When the scientific organiza-
tion speaks, whose voice do we hear
—that of science? or of the sustaining
industry? It might be a less serious
situation if this voice were always
clearly identified, but the public as-
sumes it is hearing the voice of science.

What does it mean when we see a
committee set up to make a suppos-

edly impartial review of a situation,
and then discover that the committee
is affiliated with the very industry
whose profits are at stake? I have
this week read two reviews of the
recent reports of a National Acad-
emy of Sciences committee on the
relations of pesticides to wildlife.
These reviews raise disturbing ques-
tions. It is important to understand just
what this committee is. The two sec-
tions of its report that have now been
published are frequently cited by the
pesticide industry in attempts to re-
fute my statements. The public, I be-
lieve, assumes that the Committee is
actually part of the Academy. Al-
though appointed by the Academy, its
members come from outside. Some
are scientists of distinction in their
fields. One would suppose the way to
get an impartial evaluation of the im-
pact of pesticides on wildlife would
be to set up a committee of completely
disinterested individuals. But the re-
view appearing this week in The At-
lantic Naturalist described the com-
position of the Committee as follows:
“A very significant role in this com-
mittee is played by the Liaison Rep-
resentatives. These are of three cate-
gories. (A) Supporting Agencies. (B)
Government Agencies. (C) Scientific

Societies. The supporting agencies are
presumably those who supply the hard
cash. Forty-three such agencies are
listed, including nineteen chemical
companies comprising the massed
might of the chemical industry. In
addition, there are at least four trade
organizations such as the National Ag-
ricultural Chemical Association and
the National Aviation Trades Associ-
ation.”

’Pulolic Relations’ Style

The committee reports begin with
a firm statement in support of the use
of chemical pesticides. From this pre-
determined position, it is not surpris—
ing to find it mentioning only some
damage to some wildlife. Since, in the
modern manner, there is no documen-
tation, one can neither confirm or
deny its findings. The Atlantic Natu-
ralist reviewer described the reports as
“written in the style of a trained pub—
lic relations official of industry out to
placate somersegments of the public
that are causing trouble.”

PAGE 46‘

(Continued from Page 42)

All of these things raise the question
of the communication of scientific
knowledge to the public. Is industry
becoming a screen through which facts
must be filtered, so that the hard, un-
comfortable truths are kept back and
only the harmless morsels allowed to
filter through? I know that many
thoughtful scientists are deeply dis-
turbed that their organizations are be-
coming fronts for industry. More than
one scientist has raised a disturbing
question—whether a spirit of lysen-
koism may be developing in America
today—the philosophy that perverted
and destroyed the science of genetics
in Russia and even infiltrated all of
that nation’s agricultural sciences. But
here the tailoring, the screening of
basic truth, is done, not to suit a party
line, but to accommodate to the short
term gain, to serve the gods of profit
and production.

These are matters of the most seri—

ous importance to society. I commend
their study to you, as professionals in
the field of communication. 0

Needless Torture of Animals

In Washington and in Albany several bills
bottled up in committees are designed to protect
animals from the cruelty of man’s hand or neg-
lect. Animals that are to be slaughtered, or
used in medical experiments, or in science labora-
tories or in classrooms can be saved from un-
speakable pain and torture through proposed
Federal and state law.

The Clark-Neuberger bill pending in the
United States Senate and a companion bill in
the House would insure decent treatment of
laboratory animals, including adequate rest and
exercise areas, proper feeding and sanitation. 7
Where subjected to painful tests, animals would
be anesthetized—now not always the case.

The existing Federal Humane Slaughter Act
covers about 80 per cent of the animals slaugh-
tered in this country; but the rest can be cov-
ered only by state laws. The McEwen-Feinberg
bill in Albany would outlaw cruel practices such
as shackling and hoisting of conscious animals.
Another state bill would bar indiscriminate ex-
periments with animals in high school class-
rooms. And the problem of homeless and starv-
ing dogs and cats—posing a health hazard in
many communities, especially in New York City
wWOuld be covered by a law encouraging the
spaying of domestic animals.

None of these bills is anti—vivisection legisla-
tion. Medical and scientific research must con-
tinue for man’s health and benefit. But human
carelessness and cruelty to animals are always-
present—and always unnecessary.

Ask Support Bill
For Humane Care
Of Lab.-.Animals

Kindness to animals was stress-
ed during the spring convention
of the Florida Federation of‘Hu-
mane Societies, held in Orlando.
Some 20 member societies met
with the general theme being
“Better Functioning H u m a n e
Societiesto Care- for Unwanted
Animals.”

A strong supporter of legislation
concerning humane treatment of
laboratory animals, Mrs. Christine
Stevens, president of the Animal
Welfare ‘l'nstitute, New York City,
was a principal speaker.

She said cruelty is being con-
cloned in research laboratories
throughout the United States and
that while much valuable informa-
tion is gained by exterimentation
it must be done in a more humane
imanner.

She advocated strong support of

the Clark- Neuberger bill and that
humanitarians everywhere should
“fight for the‘bill and not accept
any kind of whitewashing that
opponents try to fob off on us."
"This ‘bill, ”now pending in the
Senate, if passed would insure de-
cent treatment of laboratory ani-
mals, including anesthetizing those
subjected to painful tests. She said
most large laboratories employ no
means of rending animals insensi-
tive to “painful and terrifying ex-
periments.” Interested p e r s o n s
can write Senators Holland and
George Smathers and Cong. James
‘Haley at the U. 5. Congress, Wash-
;ington, D. C., in support of the
,above bill.

iconsideration to children in hand-

IN OUR MAILBOX
Mr. Tom Ethridge
. c son, "' "'in
Dear Mr. Ethridge:

Your column of September
24th on National Dog W e e k
has come to our attention,
and with one exception, we
wish to congratulate you on
it. The exception, however, is
an extremely serious one for

. it states that Dr. W a ts o 11
Davis is the director of th e
Animal Welfare Institute and
then goes on to attribute to us
the very things we have so
strongly criticized in Dr. Dav-
is’s organization.

Dr. Davis has no connec-
tion whatsoever with the Ani-
mal Welfare Institute. So that

there can be no mistake about

this, I am enclosing a copy of
the Information Report from
which your material doubless
came.

We request that you correct
this defamatory error which
would leadreaders to suppose
that the AWI is encouraging
cruelty. We would appreciate
receiving from you a copy of
. . your column when it is cor-
rected, so that we can refer
to it if inquiries are made.

The Executive Secretary of
the AWI is Miss Estella Drap-
er. Her experience in news-
paper work leads her to be-
lieve. that the error may have
occurred through the removal
of a. line or two of type— a
matter over which we realize
you have no control.

CHRISTINE
President of the
Animal Welfare League
22 East 17th Street
New York 3, N. Y.

(NOTE; We deeply regret
this unintentional error, ap-
parently due to lost or trans-
posed lines somewhere along
the way. Our column of Sept.
24 reprinted a local speech by
Lewis W. Scott of Jackson,
Chairman of the Dog Week
observance in Mississippi, who
praised groups such as Mrs.
Smith’s. We have the highest
regard for the Animal Wel-
fare Institute and other hu-
mane organizations working
on behalf of dumb animals.
Our thanks to Mrs. Smith for
. her letter, and best wishes for
AWI program. --T. E.)

SNAPPY RETORT

Dear Mr. Ethridge:

Allow me to take issue with
the Jackson choir singer
who identified herself (or him-
self) as “Concerned A b o u t
Dieters,” and who ridiculed
those not wishing to become
plump. Obese persons are
naturally jealous of tr i m,
neat figures.

Beauty is not the reason for
my careful diet. Health is the
main consideration with me. .
The sarcastic choir singer is
probably digging her (or his)
grave with her (or his) teeth.

“TOWER OF RABBLE”
Dear Mr. Ethridge:

Thinkin Americans should
Mtemation an AP

item from the U. N. Tower of
Rabble, on New York’s East
River that the 111-nation gen-
eral assembly “jubilantly ap-
proved” 106. to 1 an- Asian-
African resolution condemning
racial segregation in S o u t h
Africa.

But they “greeted withdead ‘

silence” the declaration by
Hilgard Muller, the S outh

African delegate, that the as-

sembly was violating the U. N.
Charter by attempting to
interfere with his country’s ju-
dicial processes.

Kennedy’s Scummunists are

preparing the way for the
same rabble to take over our
country with, of course, a
commie-dominated UN milia
tary force after the U. S. is
totally disarmed.

It’s later than you thought.

DEAR TOM:

I notice, from reading the»

Voice of the People column,
that some of our most broad-
minded “moderates” live in
swanky neighborhoods far re-

moved from the interracial to- -
‘getherness they favOr for the '
- common herd.

Why not let them prove '

their sincerity by selling their

colored neighborhoods? There
are some comfortable dwell-

set an example by practicing ’

what they preach.

ACTIVE PIONEER
Dear Mr. Ethridge:

While in Jackson some time
ago, I read your column about
the worst tornado in Missis-
on
May 7, 1840, from the Missis-
sippi History book by your
father, the late George Ham-
ilton Ethridge who stated that
the original report was by
Henry Tooley of Natchez, a
meteorologist.

Henry Tooley was my great
grandfather. He was a doctor,
a Methodist minister who,
I believe, endowed aMethod-
ist church at Natchez and out-.

lived the church. He was also -

of”
-l

the first Grand Master
Masons in Mississippi.

g THIS IS National Dog Week
and our friend Lewis W. Scott
of Jackson, Chairman of Mis-
sissippi’s Dog Week observance
for 14 consecutive years (a na~
tional record), has voiced this
sentimental reminder:

“Just remember that the dog
is the most unselfish living
thing: the most grateful and
friendly animal, the most for-
giving and most loyal creature.
The world like-s dogs because
dogs are the nearest to mortal
perfection of all living things.”
Chairman Scott this week,
for the second time in his 14
years as State Dog Week Chair-
man, was g’iven a National Dog
Week Award to a Mississippi
winner. The co’veted 1963 cita.
tion goes to Patricia Vaughn
Jackson “for her all-out ef-
forts in all fields of dogs —
shOws, obedience, trials, train-
ing and all other activities.”

The other national award for'
a Mississippian was presented
at Biloxi by Chairman Scott
to Clyde Morton, “greatest of
all Field Trial handlers whose
records have never been
broken.”

DOG OWNERSHIP translat-

Big Business. Total retail sales
of commercial or readymade
dog food is over $375 million.
Dog food sales in supermarkets
today is more than sales of
baby food, coffee, sugar or
practically any other item. For
collars, leashes and other sup-
plies, about $6 million is spent
annually, and another $3 million
goes for dog Medicnie, soaps
and remedies sold aver the
counters.

Veterinarians fees total about
$18 million yearly. Some
2,200 doctors in $,1800
small animal hospitals
gross an annual average of
$10,000 each. Expenses in hold-
ing 650 championship shows,
500 match events and 800 field
trials - bird, spaniel, beagle,
retriever, coonhound and fox-
hound trials —— cost another
$3 million. Expenditures by dog
breeders average $300 each or
$24 million and six guide dog

was Dr. Ben E. Sheffy, assis-

rus Institute at Cornell Univer-
sity. At this special meeting,
which honored veterinarians
and local dog people, Chairman
Scott made some interesting
and informative remarks from
which we quote.

IS THE US. NOW, leading
a dog’s life isn’t exactly what
the old adage has implied. Ev-
ery day is now dog’s day rath-
er than those set aside on the
calendar from July 3 through
August 11, commonly knvown
as Dog Days. He even has his
special week, National Dog
Week, each year during the
month of September. . .this is
its 36th annual observance.

The US. has from 20 million
to 25 million dogs, one for ev-
ery nine persons or an average
of one dog for every three fam-
ilies. Of these, about 20 per

'per cent are pedigreed or pure-

bred. The others are “just

mutt -— but all-dog and 100 per

barking when fire occurs,
prowlers come around, etc; as
a friend and leader of blind
persons; as a soldier in war-
time, as a companion to the el-
derly o‘r lonely.

Of some 60,000 species of an—
imal life, the dog is the only
one who chose to live with man
and voluntarily give friend~
ship, loyalty and protection.
The dog did this wiithout a
whip, harness or lash. He was
and is perfectly satisfied to be
man’s friend and servant.

Some types of people should
not own dogs: all The family

is fashionable to own a pet. (2)
The owner who opposes vacci-

lets his dog run at large. (3)
The lady owner who never
grooms his dog or takes it out
for a run, or fails to water or
feed.it properly. (4) The incon-

dog to bark incessantly at all
hours of the night. (5) The Prea
tender who makes a big Show

neglects or mistreats the ani-

A MEMO from the desk of
Jess Gork-in, editor of Pa-
,rade Magazine distributed
each Sunday with this and
other newspapers from coast
to coast, takes notice of this
corner’s criticism of Parade’s
article some weeks ago on

(“What Really Happened In ..

Korea.”

Our point was that Mr.
Anderson is an associate-em-
ployee of Drew Pearson,
Washington columnist who den
spises General MacArthur. It
seemed, to us that Mr. An-
derson’s “inside” version of
Korea put the General in an
unfavorable light.

Editor Gork-in’s memo says,
' “This story created a great
deal of reader interest and
editorial comment. I thought
you would be particularly in-
terested in the enclosed note
from Maj. Gen. Charles A.
Willoughby, who was MacAr-
thur’s Chief of Intelligence
from 1941 to 1951.”

(General Willoughby’s note
lauded portions of the Parade
article as deing “a splendid
and courageous job to unravel
some of the lies and myths
about the Korean War.” Wil—
loughby added that “MacAr-
tlgr’s upcoming Reminiscen-
c may shed further light
on” the controversies”)

JOIN THE MAU MAU?

Dear Mr. Ethridge:

,f’I have just read Newsweek
Magazine’s unfavorable men-
tion of you and your column
(issue of Dec. 16) but my im-
pression is that many intelli-
gent Americans agree with
your statement quoted by
Newsweek that “John F. Ken-
nedy would probably be alive
today if his brother had Spent
less time rounding up minori-
ty-bloc votes and more time
rounding up dangerous sub-
versives.”

I notice that Newsweek’s
edition ridiculing you and
other Southern conservatives
features a cover picture of the
notorious mass murderer Jo-
mo Kenyatta, organizer and
leader of Mau Mau terrorists,
who this month became Prime
Minister of Kenya.

Perhaps if you joined the
Mau Mau and championed its
cause, you might get sym-
pathetic treatment from
Newsweek, which is owned by
the left-wing Washington Post.
This vicious combine should
be named “Brainwashers,
Inc.”

CAPITOL FREE ENTERPRISE

 

Dear Voice Editor:

Walter Trohan was again inspired in his week-end Tribune 'Report From Washington'
when he wrote: ”There are occasional rewarding flashes of lightning in the Congressional Record,
which is commonly regarded as the dullest publication in America in content as well as appear-
ance.”...

Your brilliant washington Chieftain then reported on California Congressman Hosmer's
recent insertion in the Record Appendix of the revealing exchange of letters between Dr. Bernard
T. Feld, professor of physics at MIT, and Dr. Stefan T. Possony, director of the Hoover Institu-
tion on War, Revolution and Peace at Stanford University. The interesting correspondence concerns
the right of Dr. Edward Teller, H—Bomb Father, to testify on Capitol Hill against ratification of
the nuclear test ban treaty.

It is quite true the Congressional Record may appear dull in content and appearance.
However, in reality it is a veritable never-ending diamond—in-the—rough as a repositoqwof vital
but little—known facts and information. Like many strange persons and places it is unique in
scope and understanding. Perhaps it is best described as THE WORLD'S MOST INFLUENTTAL DAILY
COMPENDIUM.

No organizations in washington recognize this clearer than certain progressive
foreign embassies.... That's why these diplomats, your pioneering Bell Telephone Company, the
First National City Bank of New York, American Petroleum Institute, Animal Welfare Institute,
World Health Organization, a few Government agencies, trade associations and obscure religious
and educational sects or groups keep our tiny enterprise afloat just to obtain for them those
especial ”occasional flashes of lightning" -- and a bit plus -- mentioned by your Mr. Trohan.
Our sole task is specific monitoring of the Capitol Hill Record each legislative day line-by—
line, cover-to-cover —- simplifying, correlating, newsvertising according to the individual
subscriber's reading requirements. In a word The Record is made readable! A survey of the
first five months of this session revealed CRC read or extracted dynamically by individual
coded subjects no less than 23 million words from the difficult Record format!

 

IMIing this current international crisis it seems a real pity that certain in-
formed foreigners and a few members of the American elite are the only persons having knowledge
of the availability of this unique but obscure service. Knowledge still is power.. We now be-
lieve the public interest demands that all interested in the right to know fully all sides of
any topic --- especially the Nation's scholars, scientists, educators and high school and col-
lege students —-- should be apprized of our existence. Therefore, we are appealing to the Trib-
une's Voice columns to help spotlite—focus the 'amazingly dull' Congressional Record so to im—
plement the ”flashes of lightning” revelations of your perceptive Washington chief.

from a humanitarian point of view. Her comments were submitted
to the producers of the treatise and met with a friendly reception.

Miss Norma Armstrong represented UFAW at meetings of
the Co-ordinating Group of the International Youth Federation
for the Conservation of Nature. The objects of the Group are to
co-ordinate the activities of Natural History Societies and
encourage the attendance of. British representatives at international
camps.

Through the medium of the National Council of Women
copies of Mr. Volrath’s three books have been sent free to the
Southern Transvaal for placing in school libraries.

Mr. Porter. Mr. Clegg and Professor Warmington gave
valuable educational lectures on UFAW’s behalf.

UFAW-LIKE SOCIETIES OVERSEAS, AND OTHER
. OVERSEAS CONTACTS

United States. of America.

During the past year UFAW has co-operated closely with
the Animal Welfare Institute, whose President is Mrs. Christine
Stevens.

Anyone less brave than Mrs. Stevens would quail before the
opposition which she meets in her efforts to improve conditions
for laboratory animals in the United States. The Animal Welfare
Institute is in a position similar to that in which UFAW was some
thirty years ago when it was being violently attacked both by
vivisectors and by anti-vivisectionists. The problem in the United
States is, however, worse than it has ever been here because there
has been protective legislation here since 1876 while there is still
none in the States. '

We have been glad to learn from Dr. Lane-Fetter that in
some research establishments there has been great progress.
especially in the husbandry of laboratory animals. Unfortunately,
however. these establishments do not appear to be typical, as will
appear from the following information supplied by the Animal
Welfare Institute.

For ten years now veterinary and other representatives of the
Animal. Welfare Institute have been visiting animal houses and
laboratories in the States. Very many abuses have been reported.
of which only a small number have been rectiﬁed. Two common
causes of needless suffering are overcrowding and failure to
provide animals with water. Great carelessness has also been
noted. for instance there is often lack of planning and recording

21

 




and failure to label cages. It is unusual to give experimental
dogs any exercise, many are kept for years conﬁned in small cages
ranged in three tiers ; unfortunately this sets the sort of example
which spreads all too readily to other countries such as Japan.
Thanks to the Laboratory Animals Centre of the Medical Research
Council we have in Britain a system of accredited animal dealers,
but in the States the list of dealers issued by the Institute of
Laboratory Animal Resources is entirely unselective, and many of
the animals which enter laboratories are already sick. As regards
the actual experiments the most terrifying and painful procedures
are undertaken without any safeguards.

Could this state of affairs be dealt with by voluntary co-
operation or is legislation essential? Mrs. Stevens points out that
promises of voluntary co-operation delayed slaughter reform in
the USA. for more than a quarter of a century. It is understand-
able that US scientists should be hesitant about the introduction
of legislation, but although the nefarious may have good reason to
fear it the genuine need not, be hampered by a wise law.
Eminent scientists, including many fellows of the Royal Society,
have expressed strongly to UFAW their View that the British law
of 1876 prevents unjustiﬁable experimentation but permits that
which is worth while. The legislation proposed by the Animal
Welfare Institute is based fundamentally on the British Act; it is
contained in a bill HR 1937 which is sponsored in the House of
Representatives by Representative Martha Griﬂiths, to whom all
honour is due. A companion bill S 3088 is being introduced into
the Senate by Senators Clark and Neuberger, who also have
UFAW’s best wishes. While there is much opposition to the
suggested measures there are points of hope in the support, for
instance, of The Washington Post and the New England Federa-
tion of Humane Societies. It is encouraging too that new kennels
with runs are being built for the hundreds of test beagles belonging
to the Food and Drug Administration which have been for years
in a semi-basement ; provision is also to be made for better post-
operative care and for euthanasia. The US. Department of
Health, Education and Welfare, Public Health Service, in a revised
issue of its pamphlet The Dog in Medical Research, recOmmends
the provision of runs ; the State-wide Animal Care Committee of
the University of California recommends runs for dogs, monkeys
and farm animals.

Experiments on animals by school children continue in the
United States; they are specially encouraged by the National
Science Foundation whose Science Projects Handbook starts with
the words “ Nearly a million teenage boys and girls throughout
the world are having fun discovering science ”. The fun described

22

 




includes induction of cancer, shocking of pregnant mice and rats,
and tying the ureters of a rabbit. The Foundation provides not
only so-called fun but also prizes and publicity. The Dean of the
College of Veterinary Medicine of Michigan State University is
one of those who have spoken against this degradation both of
young people and of science. Fortunately there is some opposition
to this evil and many teachers are glad to avail themselves of the
Animal Welfare Institute’s excellent booklet Humane Biology
Projects.

The Animal Welfare Institute’s annual award of the
Schweitzer medal was made in 1961 to Mr. W. H. A. Carr,
reporter and columnist for the New York Post, whose articles
opposing cruelty and callousness have been outstanding.

It has been estimated that the Humane Slaughter Act, which
came into force in the summer of 1960, had, within a year,
ensured the humane slaughter of a hundred million animals,
80 to 90 per cent of the total kill. By this Act all meat
packers wishing to have a contract with the Federal Government
are obliged to kill all the animals in all their plants humanely.
The animals not covered are those killed by small ﬁrms and kosher
butchers. Supplementary State laws are therefore needed to
ensure the humane killing of all animals for non-Jewish con-
sumption, and to prohibit all shackling and hoisting of conscious
animals by the leg. Such hoisting is no longer justiﬁable; in
Britain the use of a revolving pen is obligatory for Jewish slaughter
of cattle, and a similar pen has been developed in the United
States. Fourteen states have now passed the necessary additional
laws, these are : California, Connecticut, Florida, Kansas, Maine,
Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire,
Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Wisconsin. The legislation
has not yet been passed in New York. '

There is much concern in the United States over the transport
of food animals, especially of those sent by road. An important
publication has been issued by the Farmer Co-operative Service
of the ‘U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, 25, DC,
entitled Loss and Damage in Handling and Transporting Hogs
(Rickenbacker, January, 1961). It has been estimated that 50 per
cent of all food animals in transit are improperly handled.

A struggle is going on over a Wilderness Bill which would
protect from exploitation parts of the virgin forests already owned
by the State; representatives of mining, oil and lumber interests
are trying to draw the teeth of this bill. Another bill, the Marine
Mammals Bill, aims at prohibiting the shooting of polar bears,
walruses and sea otters from aeroplanes.

Japan

The Japan Animal Welfare Society is slowly earning recogni-
tion in Japan. Its membership has increased considerably and,
for the ﬁrst time, a member of the Imperial family showed
patronage by attending a ﬁlm premiere which was given for the
society in Tokyo and raised approximately £1,000.

The ﬁeld of work is being extended. In Kyoto great advances
have been made since a branch of JAWS was started there last
year. An enthusiastic and efﬁcient committee has improved the
conditions under which experimental animals are kept both by
building new kennels and by providing anaesthetics to the Univer-
sity and hospitals. In Yokohama a start has been made on
the same work by another active committee. In Sendai it has so far
been difﬁcult to arouse suﬂicient interest to maintain the work
adequately, but it is hOped that improvements are in sight.

An important programme is in hand for teaching children to
love and care for animals. Essay contests have been arranged and
talks given in schools.

Good co-operation is being obtained from veterinarians and
municipal authorities. There is a movement to establish a centre
where spaying can be carried out by veterinary surgeons. If
this materializes a vast amount of suffering will be eliminated
During 1961/62 over 46,000 dogs were collected up into dog
pounds in Greater Tokyo; of these 20,000 were destroyed and
12,000 were sold for experimental work.

One of the greatest needs is an increase in. the strength of
trained, salaried staff. Unless there are suﬂicient capable and trust-
worthy inspectors to visit the pounds and experimental centres the
improvements that have been achieved at such cost in labour and
money will be lost. The work is too much in its infancy for
supervision to be relaxed in any way.

It is hoped that it may be possible to provide and run a
mobile dispensary as soon as a veterinary surgeon and driver can
be obtained.

Although the money raised in Japan is increasing in amount
the Society is still mainly dependent on funds coming from foreign
sources. Contributions will be most gratefully received by the
Japan Animal Welfare Society, 179 Gloucester Place, London.

LIGVEIGHG Amory

Animal Welfare

By AMELIA YOUNG
Star Staff Writer
Social historian [Cleveland
Amory, director of the Hu-
mane Society of the United
States, spoke out Saturday

- against the “moral cripples”

and the “humaniacs” ostens-
ibly devoted to the cause of
animal welfare.

In a luncheon address to
the National Catholic Society
for Animal Welfare, which
was holding its fourth an-
nual meeting at the May-
flower Hotel here, Mr. Amory
accused certain institutions
and groups of having be-
trayed the benevolent pur-
poses of their founders.

They collect funds under
the guise of humanitarian-
ism, he said, while actually
aiding and abetting the re-
verse.

The speaker singled out
especially two New York es-
tablishments—one, a society
which he said no longer up-
holds its goal of preventing
cruelty to animals, and two,
an animal medical center,
founded to serve the pets of
the poor, which he described
as being new “merely an
adjunct of its animal-ex-
perimentation neighbors. . . .”

“Ironic”

It is “particularly ironic,”
he said, that one wealthy
woman, “a devoted humani-
tarian, was deceived or duped
into leaving her entire life
savings” to these two groups.
“She left everything to that
which she had fought against
all her life.”

Mr. Amory also criticized
the sentimental extremists
who unwittingly reduce the
cause of animal welfare to
the absurd.

Distinguishing b e t w e. e n
“the humane and the hu—
maniac,” he said, “The anti-
vivisectionists have been al-
most as hard to fight, for

 

 

 

‘ . treatment of animals

 

 

 

those of us in the humane
movement, as the inhumane
people, because they have
tarred us all with the brush
of being ‘people haters.”’

The author-lecturer de-'
voted most of his talk to
the “present plight” of some ~
laboratory animals and the
treatment of livestock in cer-
tain slaughter-houses.

After describing in, detail _
shackling and hoisting tech-
niques used in slaughtering
conscious animals, with a
vivid account of how the ani-
mals react, Mr. Amory called
the amendment tacked onto
the Humane Slaugher Bill,
to allow this treatment, “a
phony compromise.”

Such “‘torture” is not re-
quired .by Kosher law, as sup-
porters of - the amendment
claimed, and has in fact been
denounced by Orthodox Jew-
ish spokesmen, he said.

Of laboratory animals, he
said, “They are being used
not alone in medical schools
and hospitals . . . (but) in
every conceivable, and in
m a n y cases inconceivable,
kind of research project
which comes under the head
of today’s worship of the
great god Science.”

Referring to the ‘six bills
on animal welfare now before
Congress, he observed that
the testimony at committee
hearings from “even the
most reputable places of re-
search caused such specu-
lation as to what went on at
lesser places as to beggar the
imaginaion. ”

The cause of humani-
tarianism has a power of its
own, Mr. Amory said. “There
is a kind of army, The Army
of the Kind, which ranges
from Maine to California and
which stands ready . . . to
fight—in person, by tele-
phone and telegraph and,
above all, by mail.”

Mr. Amory praised as
“most encouraging” the lead-
ers of “this army.” Outstand-
ing, he said, are Mr. Fred
Myers, executive director of
the Humane Society of the
United States in Washington;

 

New} yolk,“ and Miss Helen

Jones, executive director 01
the National Catholic Society
for Animal Welfare, also in i;
Washington. ’

Monk Speaks

At the afternoon session
following Mr. Amory’s talk,
Dom Ambrose Agius. O.S.B.,
spoke to members of the so-
ciety on “Animal Welfare and
the Ecumenical Spirit.”

Pointing out that Pope
John XXIII and the three.
Popes who p1 eceded him were

all concerned with charitable
the

Mlss Carson

/ Rachel Carson, native of Spring-
dale and distinguished naturalist
and author of “Silent Spring,”
“The Sea Around Us,” and “The
Edge of the Sea” has been named
V to receive the 1962 Albert Schweit-
zer Medal of the Animal Welfare
Inst1tute in recognition of her con-

tribution to the protection of ver-
tebrate animals from needless suf-
fering and death resulting from
excessive use of dangerous insect-
icides.

'In. “Silent Spring,’ her latest
best - selling book, Miss Carson
shows why nature, including man,
must be protected from the most
massive, deliberate poisoning the
earth has ever received.

The Albert Schweitzer medal,
which is awarded annually in rec-
ognition of an outstanding contri-
bution to the welfare of animals,
will be presented to Miss Carson
at the annual meeting of the In-
stitute this afternoon. The presen-
tation will be made by Dr. Robert
Cushman Murphy, noted naturalist
and emeritus curator of birds of1
the American Museum of Natural
History.

The Animal Welfare Institute
created the Albert Schweitzer
medal in 1954, at which, time a1
gold replica was presented toi
Dr. Schweitzer. The institute works
to reduce suffering of animals in
laboratories, in slaughterhouses
and on. traplines, and to develop
humane attitudes in the coming
generations. The institute is a non--
profit, educational. organization
which gives thorough study to pre-
sent - day cruelties, making first~
hand investigations of the condi-
tions under which animals are
used and killed for human benefit.
It also supports needed ligislation
for the prevention. of cruelty. ,

The institute published educa-
tional literature for the guidance
of animal users, as well as two;
manuals “First Aid and Care of
Small Animals” and “Humane Bi-
ology Projects,” which are distri-i
buted to tens of thousands of school;
teachers throughout the United
States for classroom use.

Humane Law Advocate
Tells lobbying ‘Secrets’

Some tips on lobbying from Chris-
tine Stevens, president of the An—
imal Welfare Institute, New York
City, are contained in an article on
“That Mrs. Stevens, the Animals’
Best Friend” in the July issue of
Harper’s magazine. Much of the
article is devoted to Mrs. Stevens’
description of efforts leading to the
passage of the federal Humane
Slaughter Act in 1958.

After emphasizing the importance
of Visiting senators and representa-
tives to distribute literature and an-
swer questions, the AWI president
says: “You see, the secret of lobby-
ing is to wear the man down. Keep
on. Don’t let an issue die.”

Mrs. Stevens tells how she stim-
ulated “hundreds and hundreds of
editorials on our side” at a crucial
legislative stage by sending tele-
grams to every neWSpaper in the
country and explains:

“The real secret, and there’s only
one, is to get people to write to
their Congressman or senator. That
is what works. That’s our real se-
cret, but you know what our main
strength is? Never exaggerate to
get a person excited, and never be
wrong. You lose your usefulness.
Our literature may be boring, but
it’s accurate.”

CINCINNATUS

 

In Which We Seem of Some Use

BY ALFRED SEGAL .

THREE PEOPLE AT THIS DESK. . . .
Yes, this lady, who lives upon Glencoe
avenue in Mt. Auburn and her two fine-
igniting kid nephews. Cincinnatus can’t
turn ’em away -

She says, maybe Cin-
cinnatus can be of some
help to her toward look-
ing after these nice boys.
She has taken them to her
own heart . . their moth—
er is elsewhere. To sup-
port them in her house
she needs some work to
do at home. .addressing .
envelopes and jobs like
that to do in her own house. . . “Yes,”
she says, “I ve taken them in and I want
to keep on bringing them up toward being
decent people.”

Cincinnatus has her name and address
to hand on to anyone who would like to
be of help to her purpose to raise them
is worthwhile manhood, by help of a pay
ing job to do at home!

MORE FOR THIS COLUMN. . . . Well,
Cincinnatus could feel thankful to the
Glencoe avenue lady, who had brought
this column to some use for the moment,
and then along comes a letter from a man
in the 2000 block of Harrison avenue who
hopes this column may serve his wife.

He says: “My wife has a rheumatic
heart condition for which she has already
undergone surgery. The doctors at Gen-
eral Hospital tell me that for her to go on
living she needs further surgery. How-

e,r before they can operate she must
h1ve 20 pints of blood.

“Although I have been a resident of
Cincinnati for several years, I do not have
any relatives or friends here who-*can‘fur-
nish, this amount of blood. We have two
small boys and we wonder if you can help
us in this matter. If you are able to obtain
any donors they can donate their blood in
the name of Jean Lay to the blood bank
at General Hospital” (Yes, as Cincinnatus
well knows, blood if it has to be paid for,
costs $30 a pint, and how many can
afford it?)

AND MORE USEFULNESS. . . . Then
after Cincinnatus had written about the
lady who wants some work at home toward
the support of her young nephews and
about the man who hopes for 20 pints of
blood for his wife, Cincinnatus heard from
Robert Millard, who is assistant adminis-
trator of St. Mary Hospital.

Mr. Millard was directing this column
to further usefulness with some 40 phone-
graph records which were placed on the
Cincinnatus desk. The records are titled
“Xavier Talking Book.” Manufactured by
the Xavier Society for the Blind, 154 East
23rd street, New York. They all speak
and sing out of the New Testament for
the comfort of the blind. _

Mr. Millard was hoping Cincinnatus
could find some one to whom to give all
these recOrds and their Biblical inspira-

 

tion So, this afternoon Cincinnatus, with
all these records is driving over to 932
Dayton street, which is the home of then
Negro Sightless Society. .to hand ’em
to director George Martin . . . in hope“
that maybe they can be of some comforts-1
to the blind there. b y singing to them
in the darkness. _ _

WE ANSWER SOME SCOLDINGS.
Yes, by telephone, Cincinnatus has been}?
getting scoldings out of Mercer streetf”
Mercer street runs from 1324 Vine, east;
to Walnut street. Yes, Mercer street is"

.....

where the Raoul Stanfield died recently?
in his residence on a third floor. He left;
behind, typewritten, a long, long story of:
his life which had to do with all his...”
troubles as labor leader and polit1c1an
among the Democrats. 1

In the c0urse of his autobiography he
suggests that Mercer is a slum street and
thus this column quoted him several
Weeks ago. Now all those scoldings from
Mercer street ladies who have been calling”.
Cincinnatus. No, no, they’re protesting,“
no slums on Mercer street, even theagi:
we aren’t rich. Mercer street is a com-
munity of peeple who work hard at jobs
and do their social best to bring up their
children right. “There’s no slums at
al-, ” they say, “where people try to make
the best of their lives.” .

Cincinnatus thanks them for their.
scoldings; it’s good for a column to be let
down every so often.

CINCINNATUS SIGNS UP. Yes,
glincinnatuﬁ his inst signed an application
an o t e nimal mmgnggt, m
which he off§f§“'liimse1% up for medgical'
college experiment in place of dogs, ,_

monkeys, mice and guinea pigs.

The Animal Welfare Institute in a
letter is saying: “Each year thousands of
our animal friends are tortured and put
to an ignominious end under the euphe-
mistic name of science. .What can you
do about this slaughter, this wanton de-
struction of life? We offer each and every-
one of you the opportunity to save the
lives of these poor, mistreated creatures.”

Yes, this Animal Welfare Institute tells
Cincinnatus that by offering himself up to
the medical college he can save the lives
of “at least 50 mice, rats, guinea pigs,
rabbits and monkeys from the horrors of
cancer and cerebral palsy experiments.
Save our animal friends. Fill out the"
coupon at the bottom of this page and
mail it to your local chapter of the Animal
Welfare Institute at once. Do not let an-
other life be lost.”

Well, Cincinnatus who has applauded
dogs which give their lives for our good,
is willing to hand on his own poor body-
for medical experiment. . and, really
how much will the readers of this column
miss if his body goes that way? And how
noble it will be for Cincinnatus to hand
over his life for experiment, say, against

cancer. He feels the same way about pro-
moting dogs, monkeys and guinea pigs to
n1bility through experiment in the Medi-
cal College of the University of Cincinnati.

‘\l
BY RICHARD GEHMAN

I In June 1962, roughly about the time that Edward
M. Gilbert was making headlines by ﬂeeing to Brazil,
with $1,953,000 that formerly belonged to the E. L.
Bruce Company, the newspapers here in the com-
munity sometimes called Wonderland, D.C., were de-
tailing a ﬁnancial coup that made Bruce’s alleged
theft seem like the act of a little boy stealing pennies.
Gilbert, it would seem, had been wasting his time in
that piddling little lumber and hardwood company.
He should have gone where the big money really is—
to the Congress of the United States. Instead of ply-
ing Wall Street, he should have become a Washington
lobbyist. Then he could have stolen legally.

On June 23, while Gilbert was sitting down there
wondering where his next million was going to come
from, a Senate Committee was revealing that lobbyists
for foreign and domestic sugar producing interests
were quietly conspiring to
take you and me and all the
rest of us in this country
for around $600 million in
1962 alone.

That’s a lot of sugar,
but it’s only a small part
of the whole bowl. During
the past 15 years, said Sen-
ator Paul Douglas, acting
chairman of the Finance
Committee, U.S. consum-
ers have footed the bill for
more than $4 billion in
“subsidies” to foreign and
domestic sugar men, mainly
due to the efforts of lobby-
ists to get subsidy bills
passed. And, added the
senator indignantly, a bill
approved in the House
of Representatives, intro—
duced through the efforts
of lobbyists and unques-
tionably passed as a result
of their pressure, was plan-
ning to add $2,500,000,000
to that sum during the
next ﬁve years. Lobbyists
for nearly 30 foreign countries were conspiring to
sell sugar to the US. at prices nearly three cents per
pound above the world market, Senator Douglas said.

Several fairly well-known names were mentioned
in the investigation: the law ﬁrm of Oscar L. Chap-
man, former Secretary of the Interior, representing
the sugar producers of Mexico; the law ﬁrm of Donald
Dawson. one-time White House aide to Harry S. Tru-
man, representing the sugar producers of Mexico:
and the consulting ﬁrm of A. S. Nemir Associates,
representing the sugar producers of Brazil. (“It’s not
enough they hide our thieves,” said one \Mashington
wit, “they got to come up and steal from us, tool”)

All three of the lobbyists questioned admitted that
their ﬁrms were paid huge yearly retainers—up to
$99,000 a year, plus as high as $15,000 expenses, for
their lobbying work. Also, they were to be paid “con—
tingent” fees if the importing quotas on sugar were

raised. Chapman, for example, testiﬁed that his opera—
tion was paid a retainer of $50,000 a year, plus “a
small percentage” as a contingent fee. Under ques-
tioning, he admitted that the contingent fee was 25¢
per ton for any increase in Mexico’s quota that might
be engineered. Under the House—passed bill, this
would have amounted to 107,000 tons, or $26,750 out
of all of our pockets.

What makes this most incredible and outrageous
to the outside observer is the fact that, despite their
knowledge of other lobbyists actively trying to boost
quotas (including those working for Haiti, Ecuador,
Peru, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Australia,
Mauritius, the Republic of China, Fiji, both the Brit-
ish West Indies and Honduras, Columbia and the
Philippines) none of the senators seemed especially
angry, let alone incredulous.

Lobbying in Washington is accepted, like the lazy
stupidity of the cab drivers or the witlessness of the

telephone operators. It has
been going on since the
days just prior to and dur-
ing the Civil War, when
Big Jim Fisk, perhaps the
ﬁrst of the well-known lob-
byists, set up a suite in the
Wardman Park Hotel and
began selling blankets from
New England textile fac-
tories by putting pressure
on senators and represen~
tatives.

Most of us on the out-
side have Fisk in mind
when we think of lobbyists
—-we see them as dispensing
cigars, booze, women, free
rides, free hotel accommo-
dations and the lot, as he
did; we think of them as
scheming, bribing, disrepu-
table characters, standing
in the social structure some-
where between chicken
thieves and the likes of
Edward M. Gilbert. Which
is exactly what many of
them are, despite the fact

that some operate in the open. These slick, experi-
enced, knowledgeable, totally ruthless and self-inter-
ested pirates reach into all areas of our lives. They
regulate our transportation, determine how much we
will pay for electricity and telephone service, jack up
or lower taxes, decide what we will eat for dinner,
ﬁx prices on guns and ﬁshing rods and cameras, and
make up our minds about how much we are going
to spend for health insurance, care of the aged, schools
and hospitals, defense, and other vital matters.

Astoundingly enough, there are lobbyists actually
on the government payroll. President John F. Ken-
nedy has a lobby that works on Congress whenever
he wants a bill passed. The head of it, Larry O’Brien,
is a “special assistant to the President.” He has a
staff of four. He spends his time “working” with the
leaders in Congress, especially heads of committees
and their administrative assistants, plugging away

TRUE THE MAN'S MAGAZINE

 




for JFK’s proposals; the staff tries to keep in touch
with congressmen on lower levels. The Pentagon also
has a lobby in the form of its Public Information
ofﬁcers, who help “clear up misunderstandings” about
our poor, perpetually misunderstood Armed Forces;
there also are legislative liaison ofﬁcers, who try to
“educate” the lawmakers. They “educate” them by
inviting them to come along for nice, well-lubricated
rides on aircraft carriers, submarines, and jet planes,
so that they can be better-informed about how well
our Armed Forces are protecting us. As one Washing-
ton reporter has observed, we would all be a sight
better off if the congressmen ﬁgured out a way of
protecting us from our protectors—for guess who is
paying for all that lubrication?

The Kennedy administration is so lobby-oriented
that one lobbyist, Mike Daniels, a 32-year—old lawyer
who is registered to lobby in behalf of the US-Japan
Trade Council, recently said. “Yeah, people who
think like we do are in
power now. I guess you
could say Kennedy is our
god. He’s our archtype. A
lot of people are com-
pletely romantic about pol-
itics and power. We’re not.

We know how power works
and so does Kennedy—he
knows exactly how it works.
There are no bogey men.
Politics works on a system.
The older lobbyists under-
stand this but they cover
it with b.s. Maybe they
don’t understand it. I don’t
think they understand it
like we do.” By “we” he
meant the members of the _
New Frontier and those
who petition, or pressure

former newspaperman

...ARE THEY ELECTED oF-
. FICIALS? NOT BY A LONG Farmers Union, National

When I asked one lobbyist about his expenditures
in the pursuit of congressmen’s happiness, he ﬁrst
winced at my use of the word “lobbying” (all lobbyists
hate the word) and then admitted that he had re-
ported expenditures of around $13,000, but in reality
—“And this is off the record, p1ease”—had spent nearly
$35,000. The $13,000 was down on his report-sheet
as having been spent “for public relations and ad-
vertising, for printing of persuasive materials, for
travel and lodging and entertainment, for ofﬁce over-
head.” The remaining $22,000? “Oh, well . . . uh . . .
for entertainment, at cocktail parties to introduce
manufacturers to people in Washington, at lunches
with ‘important people’ from whom I wished to get
information . . . that kind of thing.” In other words,
for inﬂuence; for pressure-peddling.

Big lobbying groups spend in the hundreds of thou-
sands. In the ﬁrst half of 1961, the 10 champion
registered spenders were: the American Medical As-
sociation, the AFL-CIO,
American Farm Bureau
Federation, American Le-
gion, American Trucking
Associations, Inc., National

Education Association, US.

many Mike Danielses there Wry and knowing smiles

are operating in Washing- , appear on the faces of mem—

ton today, although a bers of the Washington

named Sam Stavisky, him-
self an admitted former
lobbyist, estimated to me that there are more than
6,000 engaged in the trade, more or less openly. The
Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act of 1946 requires
that all lobbyists shall register with the Secretary of
the Senate and the Clerk of the House, and that if
they spend any money in lobbying they must tell how
much and what for. But only a small percentage of
individuals and organizations who technically are lob-
byists ever comply with this rule—and some of those
who do comply swear that they are not really lobbyists
but have just registered “to be on the safe side.”
The Congressional Record of June 5, 1962 printed
nearly 27 ﬁne—print pages of the names of lobbyists
registered with the Congress, or around 900. Yet only
280-odd organizations reported that they had spent any
money for lobbying which means, says one Washing-
ton newspaperman, “There are about seven hundred
liars on that list.”

such ﬁgures, for they know

that for every lobbyist or
organization reporting expenditures there are at least
20 that do not feel the necessity of registering. These
include public relations ﬁrms, “research” organiza-
tions, polling operations and others engaged in the
dissemination of information calculated to persuade
or change minds. Also, nearly all foreign governments
maintain ofﬁces in Washington which keep in touch
with legislation that affects them or may affect them
in the future. The representatives of these govern-
ments circulate freely among US. government people,
making no pretense of not strongly advocating their
own interests. They do not have to register, but what
they are doing is most certainly lobbying.

It is hard to think of a single group of people
banded together to promote an idea or sell a product
that does not have a lobbyist working in its behalf
in Washington. There are lobbies for automobile
manufacturers and for apes [Continued on page 108]

 




 

The Pressure Peddlers

[Continued from page 45]

(the anti-vivisection groups), for biscuit
makers and bowling ball manufacturers,
for church organizations and for crap—
shooters (peOple trying to get federal
laws legalizing gambling), for dogs
(ASPCA) and diamonds, for—well, it
would be possible to go all through the
alphabet and list at least a dozen cate-
gories under each letter.

The efforts of. lobbyists have caused
some goofy bills to be introduced into
Congress, some that seemingly would be
beneath the attention of the Olympics
body. Last year one of the most world-
minded members of the Senate, ]. W. Ful—
bright, chairman of the Foreign Rela—
tions Committee, provoked a certain
amount of mirth when he introduced
a bill to remove the excise tax on croquet
balls and mallets. Previously, pressure
on the part of manufacturers of football,
basketball and baseball had caused the
excise taxes on those items to be re—
moved. But the manufacturers of cro-
quet equipment, pool cues, curling stones
and other items used in less popular
sports had never used a lobbyist—until
a manufacturer in Arkansas, Fulbright’s
home state, pointed this out to the Sen-
ator. The manufacturer could be called
a lobbyist. And so, loosely speaking,
could Senator Fulbright, who inciden-
tally was one of the loudest speakers
against the sugar—producer lobbyists
mentioned in the ﬁrst paragraphs of this
piece. The bill went to the Senate Fi-
nance Committee.

Nearly every Indian tribe employs a
lobbyist to take up the tomahawk for
it in Washington. A law ﬁrm called
Strasser, Spiegelberg, Fried, Frank and
Kampelman represents The Blackfeet
Tribe of Browning, Montana; the Hual-
pai Tribe of Peach Springs, Arizona; the

 

 

Nez Perce Tribe of Lapwai, Idaho; the
Oglala Sioux Tribe of Pine Ridge, South
Dakota; the Salt River Pima-Maricopa
Indian Community, Scottsdale, Arizona;
and the Tuscarora Nation of Indians of
Lewiston, New York. There are no In-
dians in the ﬁrm of Strasser, Spiegelberg,
Fried, Frank, and Kampelman, and the
man there to whom I spoke could not tell
me exactly how he and his fellow attor-
neys attracted so much redskin trade.
“One Indian must have told another, I
guess,” he said. ,

This man distinguished himself by ad-
mitting that his ﬁrm did lobbying work.
The best way to tell the average lobbyist
in Washington is to wait for him to deny
that he is one. “Lobbying is a tent term,”
said Steve Walter, who used to be a regis-
tered lobbyist but now writes speeches
for presidents of power companies (he
once was registered for the National As-
sociation of Electric Companies).“Lobby-
ing covers a whole multitude of sins and
virtues,” he went on. “There are all
kinds of guys who practice lobbying——
public relations men, lawyers—and they
all call themselves ‘Washington repre-
sentatives.’ There was one guy not too
long ago who called himself a ‘legislative
engineer.’ He was almost laughed out of
Washington.”

During 1961 and 1962 I made 13 trips
to Washington; there was a new, brisk
air there, brought on by Mr. Kennedy.
Only the lobbyists remained unchanged.
They were as silent as ever.

A lobbyist named Michael Deane, at
the time of one of my visits, represented
American Finance Conference, Inc., and
a number of other clients. He agreed to
see me one week and called long-distance
the following week to cancel our date.
“It wouldn’t be practical for me to dis-
cuss my work,” he said, nervously. Don-
ald Dawson, ex—Air Force ofﬁcer, ex-
Truman aide, and current defender of
the sugar producers, whose ﬁrm, Dawson,
Pickens, Grifﬁn and Riddell was regis-

“She’s probably got a face that would st0p a clock.”

 

 
   

tered as representative for CIT Financial
Corporation, DC Transit System Inc.,
Hilton Hotels Corp., two life insurance
companies, the Air Transport Associa-
tion of America, the American Industrial
Bankers Association and other groups,
said he “might” see me.

“So you’re going to expose me, are
you?” he said, jauntily. “I’ve been ex-
posed so many times. . .

But he was not in the mood for it
just then; he was busy every time I called
him; he may have been ﬁguring out how
to explain to Congress what he was try-
ing to do for the sugar men.

Clinton M. Hester was another lobby-
ist recommended to me. Hester is a wool-
gatherer of the ﬁrst order: he represents
the Boston Wool Trade Association, the
National Association of Wool Manufac-
turers, and other woolly bunches. He
also stands for the National Football
League and the US. Brewers’ Associa-
tion. He was out every time I called! I
had made the mistake of telling his secre-
tary I was a reporter.

After a while, I was ready to give up.
In 10 years of writing for TRUE I never
had encountered such reticence. Even
Otis T. Carr, The King of the Non-Fly—
ing Saucers (january, 1961) was more
voluble than any lobbyist. Currently-
active lobbyists are reluctant even to
speak of such old-timers as Sam V‘Vard,
who operated until the 1890’s and used
to say, “The way to a man’s ‘Aye’ is
through his stomach.” Ward spent hun-
dreds of thousands of dollars in behalf
of bankers and railroad men, and once
gave the Speaker of the House a loving
cup engraved as having come from Rex
Vestiari, or King of the Lobby. Henry
Adams, whose autobiography, the famous
Education, is regarded as a classic, was
also a lobbyist for civil service reform;
he gave breakfasts and dinners for con-
gressmen regularly. The railroad lobbies
in the years just after the Civil War were
so powerful that Senator I. S. lVIorrill
once stood up near the end of a session
and mentioned that the president of the
Pennsylvania Railroad was in the lobby,
and that the Senate ought to ﬁnd out if
there was anything else he wanted before
adjournment.

The old—timers actually did work in
the lobbies—hence the word—and were
called “bagmen” because of the black
bags of money they carried. Some con—
gressmen, according to Steve \Valter, had
receptacles for the contents of the bags:
one was known as Umbrella Mike be-
cause he carried same unfurled, rain or
shine, so that lobbyists could shove
money into it as he walked through the
lobby.

Whether or not they have worked in
lobbies, these diligent exercises of the
right of petition have accomplished some
spectacular feats. The reason that you
and I are prevented by law from return-
ing whisky bottles to manufacturers is
not because there is anything harmful
in a distillery reﬁlling them, but because
years ago a glass lobby convinced Con-
gress that we needed a law against re-
ﬁlling. This, of course, meant that more
bottles than were needed would have to
be made. The law is still in effect. Simi-

larly, there is a, law that says that bonded
bourbon must be aged in brand-new bar-
rels. There is no good reason for this,
distillers say—except in the eyes of the
barrel manufacturers and lumbermen,
whose lobbies put the law on the books.

The three major television networks-
.-\B(l, CBS, and NBC—have spent an esti-
mated 35500,000 to keep pay-TV from be-
coming a reality. ()1in a small part of
that sum ever has been reported to Con-
gress. ()ne lobbyist told me that “the
most massive lobbying efforts in recent
years” occurred when CBS threw a party
for its affiliated stations at the Sheraton-
Park Hotel. 'l‘hey planned a dinner; they
flew in Art Linkletter to be m.c. and had
other stars on hand. Each afﬁliate had a
”hospitality suite" to welcome his home
congressman. “There were more congress-
men at that banquet,” said this lobbyist,
“than there were when Queen Elizabeth
visited and addressed the combined
houses.”

During the Eisenhower administration,
when there was a shameful need for
schools all over the nation (a need that
still exists, by the way) , the school—build—
ing program was minimized down to a
point of virtual non-existence. while the
road-building program was pushed and
passed. “The schools had no eﬂ'ective
lobbyists,” one representative from Penn-
sylvania told me. “There were no big
organized groups behind them, except
labor—and labor lobbies for everything
that may beneﬁt its members. But it
lobbies on so many issues it can’t put
out a real hard campaign against legis—
lation that isn’t intimately connected
with labor laws. ()n the other hand, look
who lobbied for roads. The truckers.
Manufacturers who shipped things from
state to state. Concrete companies. Heavy-
equipment manufacturers. And even the
military—they were concerned with more
roads for better troop movements. Roads
took priority. However,” he added, “we
have one consolation. It’s a hell of a lot
easier, with all these new roads, to get
our kids to the schools that aren’t there
. . . but just might be, some day.”

Every time one piece of military equip-
ment is passed up in favor of another,
one lobbyist told me, it is a safe bet that
the civilian manufacturer, ope ‘ating on
a cost-plus basis, has used lobbyists, both
his own and those in the military lobby
he has been able to reach. It does not
matter if the passed-up piece is better
than the one that is selected. \Mhat does
matter is whether the lobbyists have
handcuffed enough votes in, ﬁrst, the
committees, and then in the two houses.

Even when lobbyists ﬁght each other,
as they often do, the rest of us sitting
out here in the hinterlands wind up los-
ers. The reason we pay more today for
poultry than we did prior to 1957 can
be laid partly to inﬂation, but only
partly. Arnold Mayer, a Yale man (there
must be something about th‘ air in New
Haven that spawns lobbyists), working
as a lobbyist for the /-\malgamated Meat
Cutters Union, believed that people
might buy more meat if poultry cost
more. He got health experts to testify
that poultry ought to be inspected, and
planted warning articles in the gullible
women’s magazines claiming there was

danger in eating poultry that was not
inspected. The result was the ﬁrst com-
pulsory poultry inspection law—passed in
spite of opposition from two other power-
ful lobbying groups, the American Farm
Bureau Federation and The National
Grange.

The size of a lobby is not important.
The tinier groups can be effective if they
set their minds to it. Heaven alone knows
why your wife might want an imported
clothespin, but if she should take that
odd. notion into her head, she would ﬁnd
that the Clothespin Manufacturers’ lobby
against tariff reduction has rendered it
all butﬁirnpossible for her to my one.

//" An individual also can be effective in]
obbying. Mrs. Christine Stevens, wife
of a New York real estate man, took up
the fight against inhumane slaughter of
meat animals and ﬁnally succeeded in
having a bill passed outlawing it in
1958. Senator Hubert H. Humphrey re-
marked, “Man, I’ve never seen anything
like it . . . 35, 4-5 thousand letters.” Sena-
tor Allen J. Ellender of Louisiana added
that he never had seen so much pressure
for a bill’s passage in 22 years on the Hill.
All Mrs. Stevens did was muster the ani-
mal lovers of America, and then go to
see every last one of the members of
Congress personally. Once she sent in a
note to Senator Bourke B. Hickenlooper
of Kansas and had him called off the ﬂoor
so that she could state her case against
inhumane slaughter.

Mrs. Stevens used both direct pressure
on her victims, and indirect in the form
of letters from their constituents. There
are three methods of lobbying in use in
W :ishington: direct pressure, indirect
pressure, and pressure by bribery and
entertainment. It cannot be denied, not
even by the most pious lobbyists who
claim that they are not lobbyists, that
all three work against the interests of
some segment of the public; for every
pro there is a con. Here is how the thre%

'mct Pressure: There is a famous
story about the late Senator Henry F.
Ashurst, who after railing against a cer-
tain bill for days suddenly got up on
the floor and made a speech in favor of
it. “I see you’ve seen the light,” a friend
said. “No, I’ve felt the heat,” the senator
said.

The direct heat is turned on these
days mainly by younger lobbyists. “W e’re
like applied political scientists, we know
Congress so well,” one bragged recently.
“It’s not a matter of back-slapping and
selling inﬂuence or bribery. It’s a matter
of knowing. Hell, we know a congress-
man’s district as well as he does—we’ve
made studies of every congressman’s dis-
trict in the nation. We know what his
problems are with his constituents and
how he gets his major support. He’s only
got one thing in his head. He wants to
be re-elected. If we can show him that
his constituents want the same thing
we’re trying to persuade him to vote
for, we’ve got the guy where we want
him. Of course he’s going to vote for
our program. Of course he’s going to get
others to vote for it. . . .”

One such applied political scientist is
the aforementioned Mike Daniels, who is

 

)rimaril concerned with tr ino~ to Oct

tariff rates reduced so that stuff from
Japan can come in at lower rates. “When
we want to introduce legislation we go
to the right congressman to do it be-
cause we know his interests will be in
line with ours,” Daniels has said. “We
work with his staff people and sometimes
we even help draft the bills. We have to
know where the Whirlpools of interest
are—that is, the groups who might be
interested in our bills. And we go for
them. Sometimes we go for the congress-
men’s assistants.”

Another legislative importuner is Jack
Golodner, 29, who represents Actors’
Equity. In behalf of his mummer clients
he is trying to get various legislation
through—government support of the
arts, lower taxes, that sort of thing. Go-
lodner also is a practical politician.

“It’s a hell of a lot easier to work in
the House than it is in the Senate,” he
told me. “The Senate is made up of in-
dividualists and each senator votes more
on his own. In the House there is more
voting by blocs, and if you get the right
congressman to support your bill he can
get others to go along. Congressmen don’t
have time to read every bill, or even most
bills. They never know what the hell’s
in them, speciﬁcally. A lot of the time we
go for the assistant, too. Sometimes he
will draw up the bill and present it to
the congressman.

“The ideal situation is to have the
representative introduce your bill exactly
as you have written it. . .

The badgercd congressmen’s assistants
spend a good portion of their time listen-
ing to lobbyists. “I’m always being ap-
proached,” said Jim Taylor, assistant to
Rep. James C. Corman (D.), California.
“No congressman has time to be up on
every bill, and it’s my job to keep my
man informed. All I do is present the
facts.

“Because he’s on the Space Commit-
tee, the lobbyists from A.T. 8c T. are
pretty interested in him. They, of course,
want the communications satellite pro-
gram to be under their jurisdiction. They
don’t exert any undue inﬂuence, but they
do come and present their arguments. I
don’t have any trouble with the tele-
phone company any more,” Taylor con—
tinued, thereby becoming one of the few
men in the United States able to make
that claim. “If we want another phone
put in, all I have to do is call and I get
three nicely-dressed young men over here
to put in one phone.”

Some lobbyists do not talk to congress-
men themselves. They are more delicately
forceful. They take in one of his con-
stituents with an ax to grind, knowing
full well the lawmaker cannot refuse to
see him; they get paid for opening doors
—which, by the way, the constituent most
certainly could open himself, simply
with a letter or a telephone call, thereby
saving his lobbyist’s fee. Other lobbyists
put pressure on congressmen from their
constituents’ home fronts by organizing
letter-writing campaigns, making speeches
and urging the public to act, visiting
newspaper editors, and the like. Many
lobbyists, representatives of such big
public relations ﬁrms as Carl Byoir, a
registered lobbyist, actually have gone

into congressmen’s home district and‘run
their campaigns for them.

Some congressmen, seeing the easy
money that is made by men putting the
screws to them, resolve to become lobby-
ists themselves in the event of defeat or
retirement. Former Senator Scott W. Lu—
cas, of Illinois, is on record as of June,
1962, as representing such clients as the
National Association of Chain Drug
Stores and the Mobile Homes Manufac-
turers Association. Former Representa-
tive Andrew J. Biemiller is listed as
representing the AFL-CIO.

“Ex-senators are the worst lobbyists,”
says one of the young Turks, “because
they dupe their clients into thinking
they can rely on old friendships. They
say, ‘Sure, I’ll talk to Lyndon about that’
but what’s Lyndon going to do? He isn’t
going to draft a bill. And if a piece of
legislation is big enough for him to take
a personal interest in, nobody’s friend—
ship with him is going to help a client.”

Strangely, congressmen do not appear
to mind the methods of the far-from-
hidclen persuaders. In 1956, the Con-
gressional Quarterly, an independent
publication that tells congressmen what
they themselves are doing and periodi-
cally reports on lobbyists, surveyed con-
gressmen to ﬁnd out how they felt. The
majority said they felt “little unreason-
able pressure” from lobby groups; this
was like Frank Sinatra saying he feels
little unreasonable pressure from a pretty
face and a delicious ﬁgure. Some said
they often received valuable information
on complicated subjects from lobbyists;
they did not add, and perhaps were not
even aware that, the information always
was one-sided and on the side of the lob-
byists’ clients. Forty-three percent said
lobbyists helped them “to legislate with
maximum intelligence,” whatever that is.
Only ﬁve percent of those polled said
that Congress would be better off with—
out lobbyists. Presumably this could
mean that 95 percent were confessing to
relative ineptitude.

Indirect Pressure: Paul A. Porter was
pointed out to me by several congressmen
and an ex-president of the National Press
Club as the most effective lobbyist in
Washington. At 58, Porter has a long,
distinguished record of Government serv-
ice—Chairman of the Federal Communi-
cations Commission, OPA Administrator,
jobs like that. He is married to Kathleen
Winsor, who wrote Forever Amber. Now
a member of the ﬁrm of Arnold, Fortas
and Porter, he is a thickset, broad-shoul-
dered man with a scholarly air (he lec-
tures on the law in universities) and an
amiable, gregarious disposition. The
Congressional Record of June 5, 1962,
lists the ﬁrm as representing the Na-
tional Retail Merchants Association and
the Commissioner of Baseball. Previously
the Record had listed Porter as acting
in behalf of the California “line Insti-
tute.

Porter told me that his main function
was “advising his clients how to conduct
themselves in Congressional hearings”
and interpreting the law to them. He
handed me a pamphlet entitled Organ-
ized Baseball and the Congress. During
the past 10 or 12 years, some members

FEBRUARY 1963

of Congress, principally Representative
Emanuel Celler of New York, have been
insisting that organized baseball ought
to come under the jurisdiction of the
anti-trust laws. There have been six
formal committee hearings on the sub-
ject. Porter’s job, he told me, has been
to help Commissioner Ford C. Frick pre—
sent his side against this in an orderly
and logical fashion, well-grounded in
legality. As a result, baseball still has not
been made subject to the anti-trust laws.

A man like Paul Porter can be a lobby-
ist—or, as he insists, a non-lobbyist—
without going directly to a congressman
and stating his case. He can do it simply
by being Paul Porter. It has been esti-
mated that there are over 40 cocktail
parties per day in Washington. Porter
ﬁnds a stack of invitations 011 his desk
every morning. He is in demand because
of his relaxed personality and his quiet
humor, as well as the air of integrity he
exudes, and he is listened to with respect
because of his background of government
service. Simply by speaking his mind
while standing around at a party having
a drink with a senator or two, he can
inﬂuence opinion as effectively as if he
were to go directly to the man in his
ofﬁce and buttonhole him. Also, it can-
not be said that the beautiful Mrs. Porter
is a handicap in his work. After a talk
with her, Senator Barry Goldwater con-
ceivably might vote for a pro-labor bill.

Another man often regarded by many
VVashingtonians as a high-level lobbyist
is George E. Allen, the ex—Presidential
Friend, who after being an intimate com-
panion of Presidents Roosevelt, Truman
and Eisenhower was retired by President
Kennedy. Allen currently is a member
of the boards of 34 corporations. Some
time ago, when I wrote a piece about him
for TRUE (July, 1960), I spent months
trying to ﬁnd out ways in which he
might have used his friendship and
board membership together to influence
legislation favorable to his companies.
Several veteran Washington reporters
had been working on Allen for years,
trying to “get” him. We compared notes
and ﬁnally came to the conclusion that
Allen was clean.

Yet the rumor persists that Allen has
only to pick up the telephone and talk
to one of his scores of friends in Con-
gress in order to inﬂuence legislation in
favor of one of his many companies.
Everybody knows old George.

Allen declared to me that not only
had he never been registered as a lobby-
ist but also that during the entire eight
Eisenhower years he never had spoken
to one member of Congress except to
pass a friendly greeting.

“Oh,” he said, “I might, if it was a com-
pany I was on the board of, go to a man
and say, ‘Look, our company sees this
situation as unfair and we hope you will
see it that way too,’ because I have the
right of petition . . . but I’ve never been
paid as a lobbyist and I’ve never acted
as. one. They had me in Fortmte some
years ago as a lobbyist. That’s hogwash.
What a really good lobbyist does is be
a lawyer, keep abreast of things, advise
his clients.”

Sometimes, Allen might have added,
a good lobbyist—if indeed there is such

“Of course you can have a raise,Hurley—see me about it ﬁrst thing Mondaymorning

a thing—can affect international rela-
tions. If he had not known of one who
had done just that, he could have looked
in his own building, in Suite 500, the lair
of Charles Patrick Clark, lobbyist for
Spain and the Franco government.
Clark says he is not a lobbyist; he is a
legal counsel, he declares. However, he
was registered as of June 5, 1962, but not
for Franco. He said recently that in 1962
he would “take in” over $200,000 from
Spain, or double the amount he got in
1948, when he ﬁrst began working for
Franco.

“Everybody was against Spain when
we ﬁrst started working,” Clark said, as
though puzzled that the free world
should be against Fascism. “The Jews
were against her, the Protestants were
against her, the President—Truman—
was against her. But we told Spain’s
story. She was not a part of the Marshall
Plan. In 1949 a resolution was intro-
duced to give Spain $100 million and it
was voted down. Then it was voted down
again, but this time by less of a margin.
Both times Senator Pat McCarran, of
Nevada, introduced the bill.”

Clark did not indicate speciﬁcally that
he had asked McCarran to introduce it,
but it is inconceivable that he did not.
“I said, ‘Pat, let’s go again,’ and he said,
‘No, we’ve been licked twice.’ Well, I
talked him into going once again during
that Congress and we got it through on
August 1, 1950, and then it passed the
House on August 25.”

How much had Clark done to get this
done? “Well, I played a part in telling
Spain’s story,” he said, “but the story was
there to be told.” To whom he told it,
apart from the dead senator, Clark would
not say. On the walls of his ofﬁce are auto-
graphed pictures of Truman, President
Kennedy, various other high oﬂicials and,

112

naturally enough, Francisco Franco.

Countries other than Spain have been
known to pay well to have their stories
“told,” too. Free China’s tab to an Ameri-
can ﬁrm ran to $150,000; Portugal’s was
$207,000 for one six—month period.

Pressure by bribery and entertainment:
Sam Stavisky told me that he had heard
of congressmen who had been offered
between $7,325,000 and $30,000 to vote a
certain way. “Of course, I couldn’t prove
it,” he added, hastily. In the past, there
have been many scandals over bribing
by lobbyists. A famous one occurred in
1913, when Col. Martin M. Mulhall, the
National Association of lVIanufacturers’
man in Washington, confessed that he
had a number of congressmen on his pay—
roll. The ensuing investigation, accord-
ing to one Washington reporter, opened
up ”an almost incredible history of in—
trigue. intimidation, bribery and solicita-
tion by the NAM’S high-pressure lobby-
ists.” (Today, by the way, the NAM does
not ﬁle a spending report; it claims that
its “principal purpose” is not to inﬂuence
legislation.)

When I asked one lobbyist acquaint-
ance if he could recall any instances in
recent years of bribes or attempted bribes,
he appeared to be shocked. “IA/11y, the
easiest way for a lobbyist to undo some-
thing he was trying to do would be to
attempt to put in the ﬁx in a big way,”
he said.

He did not deny the fact that big
companies and pressure groups often
send presents to legislators and heads
of bureaus and their staffs at Christmas
time “just as reminders that they’re on
the scene.” And Paul Porter told me how
Mike V. DiSalle, when he was head of
the Ofﬁce of Price Stabilization, dealt
with the problem of these presents that
kept coming into his staff. “Mike issued

‘1
an ukase that said that his people could,
keep anything they could eat or drink
inside of 48 hours.” "

Entertaining is still the principal form
of attempted inﬂuence. In March 1962,
Charles Patrick Clark gave a huge party
at the Mayﬂower Hotel and welcomed
President Kennedy to it. It was the twen-
tieth anniversary of the old Truman
Committee, for which Clark had worked
and had been given a commendation by
the former President. Chief Justice Earl
Warren, Vice President Johnson and the
late Sam Rayburn, Speaker of the House,
were on hand.

Before Rayburn died, he was the guest
of honor at a huge annual party given by
Dale Miller, who represented many
Texas oil companies and interests. The
party was one of “the” social events in
the Washington year. Yet Miller, al-
though registered as a lobbyist, reported
that he had not spent any money for en-
tertainment. He says that he is in “public
relations.”

Few lobbyists in Washington have to
resort to the use of call girls, all the
lobbyists 1 spoke to assured me. For
one thing, most congressmen are mar-
ried, and those who do go in for extra-
curricular activities can ﬁnd plenty of
local free talent. Single congressmen have
no problem whatever; there are too many
secretaries and other government girls
who are dying to marry into ofﬁcial so-
ciety. The only time a lobbyist acts as a
procurer is either when a client asks him
to ﬁnd him a girl or when he is asked to
do a favor by someone who might help
him later on. One ex-lobbyist told me,
“One of my favorite stories about lobby-
ists and call girls happened when there
was a delegation of guys from the Middle
East—Arabians or some such—over here
and they hadn’t brought along a harem,
as they usually do. One of the lobbyists
for one of our oil companies was asked to
get call girls for the delegation. They ﬂ-
nally imported a covey from New York,
sure they were doing a favor. The only
trouble was our ambassador to that coun-
try called up next day ﬁlled with ire. The
delegation was incensed. he said, because
the lobbyist had no knowledge of their
customs. The girls he sent them were not
shaved.”

The three areas of lobbyist pressure
overlap each other. No lobbyist uses one
exclusively. All lobbyists—especially the
big ones~use any means at hand to get
their legislation passed. And there are
some big ones. The labor lobby, for ex-
ample, is regarded as perhaps the most
powerful in Washington. In March, 1961.
its chief lobbyist, a dynamic fellow named
Hyman H. Bookbinder, was said to have
a budget of over $100,000 to spend. That
was not what made him powerful, how-
ever. Behind him were the more than
17 million members of the AFL-CIO, all
ready to exert pressure on their congress—
men to get what the organization was
interested in getting.

“A postcard to a congressman from a
man in his home district is more impor—
tant than money spent or than a polished.
convincing speech by a professional lob-
byist,” Bookbinder said.

Still, he does not take chances. When

TRUE THE MAN'S MAGAZINE

 




hé’y is instructed to put 011 the pressure

by George Meany and other labor chiefs,
he nmsters his storm troops of 35 full-
time personal contact men, who are sup-
plemented by over a hundred part— time
workers.

Similarly, the American Medical As-
sociation also depends not so much on
money spent as 011 support from the
ﬁeld. There are around 177,000 doctors
on its rolls. They see 2 million patients
each day, perhaps many more than that.
Each doctor is assumed to be—or hoped
to be—talking against the AMA’s .chief
abominations, what it calls “socialized
medicine” and other attributes of the
“welfare state,” such as free medical
care for the aged and inﬁrm.

Thus far the AMA has prevailed. The
President’s social legislation program has
fared badly. This is not the only instance
in which a lobby has prevailed. .An i11-
cident that took place in August, 1961,
in Washington illustrates 110w a com-
bination of lobbyists can work against the
public interest.

At Hanford, \Mashington, the govern-
ment is building a huge plutonium re—
actor to manufacture ﬁssionable material
to be used for atomic bombs. This plant,
when it is completed late in 1962, will
release tremendous surplus energy in the
form of heat which can be converted
into steam, which in turn can produce
900,000 kilowatts of energy, or twice that
of Grand Coulee Dam. Houses, ofﬁce
buildings and factories all over the Pa-
ciﬁc Northwest will beneﬁt if this project
materializes. .It probably never will. In
the atomic energy authorization bill, a
budget of $95 million was set aside for
the construction of the electric power
plant. This, of course, threatened the
proﬁts of the private companies in the
area, and they began putting their lobby-
ists to work. Those lobbyists were joined
by other lobbyists for private power
companies scattered all over the country,
operating on the theory that if public
power is bad for one, it’s bad for all. On
July 13, 1961, the House turned down
the power plant proposal by 176 to 140.
Then the Senate put the plant back in
the bill by a vote of 54 to 36. The two
bodies had to adjust their differences,
but by then the private power lobby
was working at full steam, if the pun will
be pardoned. A motion was made in the
House to instruct its conferees to stand
ﬁrm against the power plant while the
differences were being worked out. This
passed by 285 to 164. Senator Clinton P.
Anderson of New Mexico, immediately
called for an investigation. He said that
the maneuvers of the private power in-
terests had been‘ ‘one of the most out-
rageous lobbying efforts I have ever wit-
nessed.” At this date the investigation has
not come off, and presumably the names
of the lobbyists responsible will not come
to light for a long time, if ever.
Another immensely powerful Washing-
ton lobby is that maintained by muni—
tions manufacturers, made up of a
number of organizations which, on the
surface at least, have no formal connec-
tion, although all of them have one in-
terest: selling ammunition, aircraft, mis-
siles, etc. to the Defense Department.

FEBRUARY 1963

 

A Washington reporter has estimated
that more than 800 retired ofﬁcers are
employed by the 50 biggest contractors
who are selling to the Pentagon. The
Aerospace Industries Association, a lobby
group for those who make rockets and
missiles, is headed by a retired general,
Orval R. Cook. The armed forces de-
clare piously that the retired ofﬁcers have
no inﬂuence with those still wearing uni-
form. This is nonsense; old friendships

do not die as soon as ofﬁcers retire, and

there is nothing in the world as clannish

as a group of ex-regulars. Speciﬁcally, S

My love Affair With a
Tarantula

[Continued from page 53]

as a goldﬁnch.” He went on to express
his conviction that the tarantula will
soon displace the canary and the goldﬁsh
as a household pet, although if the pro-
fessor is interested in making a little side
bet on the probability of this event I can
get him some very attractive odds. He
points out that tarantulas are more in-
telligent than goldﬁsh (which is damning
with faint praise if I ever heard it) and
unlike birds they don’t mind being kept
in captivity. The reason is that tarantulas
are almost blind and don’t know they’re
in captivity; they even have to touch
their prey before they know it’s there.

“If a grasshopper touches a front leg,
the tarantula rears up on his four hind
legs and strikes with great swiftness,”
the professor says. “One can observe this
reaction by touching a hungry tarantula
on. the front leg. It is well to use a little
caution here for the tarantula bites soon
after striking.” I’ll take his word for it.

But what ﬁnally decided me to invest
in a few tarantulas were childhood mem-
ories of the notorious Dr. Fu-Manchu
who, as described by Sax Rohmer, would
have as soon appeared in public without
his pants as without a few tarantulas to
drop down his enemies’ coat collars.
What with income-tax examiners, bill
collectors and people who ring my door-
bell trying to get me to contribute to
the Home for Underprivileged Homici—
dal Maniacs, I felt that I could use a few
tarantulas.

As, according to Professor Baerg, all a
tarantula needs is a little sympathetic
love and kindness and he will follow you
around like a dog—pausing only to eat
its nearest relations—I decided that per-
sonally I wouldn’t have to worry. Of
course, there remained the problem of my
wife and children, but they’re a bunch
of lazy slobs anyhow, and being chased
around the house by a pack of hungry
tarantulas would probably do them a
world of good. So with an easy conscience
I dropped into our friendly neighbor-
hood pet shop and asked them to wrap
up a couple of their ﬁnest.

V’Vell, you’ll never believe it, but they
were fresh out of tarantulas. Claimed
they had very little demand for them.
But I wasn’t discouraged, and it wasn’t
until two years and several dozen letters
to animal dealers later that I had to
acknowledge that the bottom had in-
deed fallen out of the tarantula market.

Then I went to Argentina. South
America is the home of the biggest taran-
tulas in. the world, and through the good
graces of the Buenos Aires Natural His-
tory Museum, I was able to meet Dr. Ad—
dalberto H. lbarra—Grasso of the National
Institution of Microbiology. The doctor
is a slender, quick-moving man who feels
about tarantulas the way most people
feel about Elizabeth Taylor. He has a
collection of over a hundred which he
keeps in little wire cages about two feet
square. Although the doctor loves taran-
tulas for their own sake, he has an ul-

terior motive. He milks them of th’tir
venom and manufactures serums which
have saved the lives of many thoughtleSS Q
Indians who made the mistake of slip—’
ping on their boots without shaking them
out ﬁrst.

“Milking a tarantula is quite simple,”
the doctor said in a matter-of—fact way.
“You merely pick one up—taking care,
of course, that she doesn’t waste her
venom by biting you—and hold her fangs
over the edge of a small glass. You then
touch the last segment of her abdomen
with two electrodes and turn on the cur-
rent. The venom comes flying out of her.”

“Yes, I can imagine that it would,” I
said. “I can also imagine that if she man-
aged to get hold of the man manipulat-
ing the electrodes, 21 lot of stuff would
come flying out of him too. How do you
avoid that possibility?”

“Actually most spiders are very reluc—
tant to bite. There are exceptions, of
course. For example, in this cage I have
a specimen of the so-called ‘jumping
spider,’ or as she is better known maﬁa
homicida. This spider is particularly in-
teresting as her venom is both neuro-
toxin and hematoxin; it affects both the
nervous system and blood stream. She
will often jump 011 a man, bite him, and
then escape.”

“Not on me she won’t, doctor,” I said
ﬁrmly. “She couldn’t jump far enough.”

“In contrast, here we have one of the
wolf or hunting spiders, known as Gram-
moslola pulchripes.” The doctor opened
a cage and disclosed a gigantic monster
about 10 inches long, covered with long,
reddish hair, legs sprouting in all direc-
tions. When the door opened she reared
back on her hind legs, brandishing her
front legs in the air like a boxer leading
with his left. Under her devil’s face I
could see the horizontal, sickle-like fangs
moving suggestively back and forth as
though she were sharpening one on the
other.

Then to my horriﬁed amazement, Dr.
Ibarra-Grasso casually reached into the
cage and put his cupped hand around
the monster. The tarantula tested the
doctor’s hand with her forelegs and, ap-
parently recognizing him as an old and
tried friend, relaxed. The doctor care-
fully folded her legs against her furry
body and lifted her out. Then he opened
his hand and allowed the creature to sit
on his bare palm.

“Perfectly tame, as you can see,” said
the doctor proudly. “Curious about the
eyes, isn’t it? She has eight pairs yet we’re
reasonably sure that a tarantula can
barely tell dark from light. But they
know their friends. Here, hold her your-
self.”

Before I could do more than emit a
shrill scream, the doctor had placed the
hairy horror in my hand. Some people
might have been nervous but—beyond
bursting into a cold sweat, developing a
curious paralysis and feeling my hair
stand on end—I was perfectly calm. The
giant spider tapped my hand experimen-
tally with her forefeet a few times, as
though calculating the best place to take
a nip, but ﬁnally she settled down.

“What do you feed them?” I asked,
hoping it wasn’t human flesh.

“WISH YOU WERE HER—”

Dear Editors:

Thanks to your timely red tuna warn-
ing’s I was able to make dietary changes
in time to ward off a serious illness of
my neutered male, Charles. He is thirteen
and is the boss.

Since he is a poor traveler and a very
unhappy boarder, we supply him with a
'live-in’ cat-sitter while we vacation.

MAIL FOR CONGRESSMEN

Dear Editors:

Florence Harrison’s letter (CATS, Au-
gust 1962) echoes my own thoughts and
feelings. I do hope your staff can do
something to help the poor animals in
laboratories, and certainly bringing the
current activities in Congress on these re—
forms to your readers’ attention would
help.

Many people who would act are unaware
of the situation and your magazine certainly
reaches a group of most interested persons.
The Animal Welfare Institute, 22 East
17th St., New York 3, N. Y., would be
glad to send informative literature to any-
one interested enough to write, as would
most any of the humane societies.

EMck
WE HELP HIM!

Dear Editors:

I don’t know how I got on your cir-
culation list in the first place, since I
don’t remember subscribing to the maga-
zine. Still: CATS Magazine is of immense
help to me in telling people where they
can register cats, where the shows are and
in answering all the other questions cat
owners ask.

I am sending you a check for a two-
year subscription.

START AT THE TOP

Dear Editors:

I sent you a clipping about the city
cat ordinance we are battling. I also wrote
to President Kennedy and in less than two
weeks received a letter from the U. S.
Department of Justice and the Attorney
General’s office. At least the President
thought it important enough to refer it to
two top offices.

The letter was all in favor of the cat
in general and quotes law cases and where
to find them in law records. Our attorney
was amazed to think the federal govern-
ment would have gone so into detail in
answer to my letter.

We are asking that the cat ordinance
be rescinded and will be interested in
noting the reaction at the council meet-
ing when this letter from the Department
of Justice is read. It appears the ordinance
is way out of line. I wonder if others
who have such a ruling realize it.

Dear Editors:

This is Rusty sunning himself on the
back porch. Last winter he was very ill.
The doctor diagnosed it as intestinal virus
and bronchitis; an incidental finding was
a congenital heart leakage which we were
told could cause death at any time. Within
two weeks he had recovered from the
virus and bronchitis.

At this time, he appears very well and
is quite active. We hope he stays that way
and will be with us for a long, long time.

AMMUNITION DEPOT

Dear Editors:

My gatito has derived many benefits
from the many suggestions in CATS. He
is now a healthy, sleek, black six-year-old.

Armed with logic gleaned from your
pages, we are constantly gaining converts
for catdom.

BETTER LATE
THAN NEVER

Dear Editors:

A belated assurance of our deep grati-
tude to CATS Magazine and its wonderful
readers for the overwhelming response to
our request for discarded greeting cards
used in our hospital project.

My boss, Ed Lally, has put me to work
answering the mail, but being an elder
citizen of ten summers, I am not as spry
as I used to be, so please, bear with me.

RENEW THAT GIFT
SUBSCRIPTION!

Dear Editors:

I have thoroughly enjoyed your delight-
ful magazine for the past year. Last year’s
subscription was a Christmas present from
my niece and I am certainly indebted to
her for many hours of enjoyment. I have
waited to hear hints from her about an-
other subscription this year, but haven’t
as yet heard anything. So, since the time
is running sort of close now, I thought
I’d better not wait another single day!

MANY MILES

Dear Editors:

Another show season started and it
has set me wondering about records for
last season. I checked my records and
found to my own amazement that my cat,
Ferdnand, and I. traveled 13,212 miles
and attended a total of twenty-one shows.

There was no show that I shipped or
agented my cats.

It would interest me, and perhaps others,
to know if any other breeder has bettered
this record.

UFAW-LIKE SOCIETIES OVERSEAS, AND OTHER
OVERSEAS CONTACTS

United States of America

During the past year UFAW has co-operated closely with
6 Animal Welfare Institute, whose President is Mrs. Christine
tevens.

Anyone less brave than Mrs. Stevens would quail before the
opposition which she meets in her efforts to improve conditions
for laboratory animals in the United States. The Animal Welfare
Institute is in a position similar to that in which UFAW was some
thirty years ago when it was being violently attacked both by
vivisectors and by anti-vivisectionists. The problem in the United
States is. however, worse than it has ever been here because there
has been protective legislation here since 1876 while there is still
none in the States.

We have been glad to learn from Dr. Lane-Fetter that in
some research establishments there has been great progress.
especially in the husbandry of laboratory animals. Unfortunately.
however. these establishments do not appear to be typical, as will
appear from the following information supplied by the Animal
Welfare Institute.

For ten years now veterinary and other representatives of the
Animal Welfare Institute have been visiting animal houses and
laboratories in the States. Very many abuses have been reported.
of which only a small number have been rectiﬁed. Two common
causes of needless suffering are overcrowding and failure to
provide animals with water. Great carelessness has also been
noted. for instance there is often lack of planning and recording

2]

 




and failure to label cages. It is unusual to give experimental
dogs any exercise, many are kept for years conﬁned in small cages
ranged in three tiers ; unfortunately this sets the sort of example
which spreads all too readily to other countries such as Japan.
Thanks to the Laboratory Animals Centre of the Medical Research
Council we have in Britain a system of accredited animal dealers,
but in the States the list of dealers issued by the Institute of
Laboratory Animal Resources is entirely unselective, and many of
the animals which enter laboratories are already sick. As regards
the actual experiments the most terrifying and painful procedures
are undertaken without any safeguards.

Could this state of affairs be dealt with by voluntary co-
operation or is legislation essential? Mrs. Stevens points out that
promises of voluntary co-operation delayed slaughter reform in
the USA. for more than a quarter of a century. It is understand-
able that U.S. scientists should be hesitant about the introduction
of legislation, but although the nefarious may have good reason to
fear it the genuine need not be hampered by a wise law.
Eminent scientists, including many fellows of the Royal Society,
have expressed strongly to UFAW their view that the British law
of 1876 prevents unjustiﬁable experimentation but permits that
Which is worth while. The legislation pr0posed by the Animal
Welfare Institute is based fundamentally on the British Act; it is
contained in a bill HR 1937 which is sponsored in the House of
Representatives by Representative Martha Grifﬁths, to whom all
honour is due. A companion bill S 3088 is being introduced into
the Senate by Senators Clark and Neuberger, who also have
UFAW’s best wishes. While there is much opposition to the
suggested measures there are points of h0pe in the support, for
instance, of The Washington Post and the New England Federa-
tion of Humane Societies. It is encouraging too that new kennels
with runs are being built for the hundreds of test beagles belonging
to the Food and Drug Administration which have been for years
in a semi-basement ; provision is also to be made for better post-
operative care and for euthanasia. The US. Department of
Health, Education and Welfare, Public Health Service, in a revised
issue of its pamphlet The Dog in Medical Research, recommends
the provision of runs ; the State-wide Animal Care Committee of
the University of California recommends runs for dogs, monkeys
and farm animals. " ‘

Experiments on animals by school children continue in the
United States; they are specially encouraged by the National
Science Foundation whose Science Projects Handbook starts with
the words “ Nearly a million teenage boys and girls throughout
the world are having fun discovering science ”. The fun described

22

 




includes induction of cancer, shocking of pregnant mice andrats,
and tying the ureters of a rabbit. The Foundation provides not
only so-called fun but also prizes and publicity. The Dean of the
College of Veterinary Medicine of Michigan State University is
one of those who have spoken against this degradation both of
young people and of science. Fortunately there is some opposition
to this evil and many teachers are glad to avail themselves of the
Animal Welfare Institute’s excellent booklet Humane Biology
Projects.

The Animal Welfare Institute’s annual award of the
Schweitzer medal was made in .1961 to Mr. W. H. A. Carr,
reporter and columnist for the New York Post, whose articles
opposing cruelty and callousness have been outstanding.

It has been estimated that the Humane Slaughter Act, which
came into force in the summer of 1960, had, within a year,
ensured the humane slaughter of a hundred million animals,
80 to 90 per cent of the total kill. By this Act all meat
packers wishing to have a contract with the Federal Government
are obliged to kill all the animals in all their plants humanely.
The animals not covered are those killed by small ﬁrms and kosher
butchers. Supplementary State laws. are therefore needed to
ensure the humane killing of all animals for non-Jewish con-
sumption, and to prohibit all shackling and hoisting of conscious
animals ‘by the leg. Such hoisting is no longer justiﬁable; in
Britain the use of a revolving pen is obligatory for Jewish slaughter
0f cattle, and a Similar pen has been developed in the United
States. Fourteen states havenow passed the necessary additional
laWs, these are : California, Connecticut, Florida, Kansas, Maine,
Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire,
Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Wisconsin. The legislation
has not yet been passed in New York. ‘

There is much concern in the United States over the transport
of food animals, especially of those sent by road. An important
publication has been issued by the Farmer Co-operative Service
of the US. Department ‘of'Agriculture, Washington, 25, DC,
entitled Loss and Damage in Handling and Transporting Hogs
(Rickenbacker, January, 1961). It has been estimated that 50 per
cent of all food animals in transit are improperly handled.

A struggle is going on over a Wilderness Bill which would
protect from exploitation parts of the Virgin forests already owned
by the State; representatives of mining, 'oil and lumber interests
are trying to draw the teeth of this bill. Another bill, the Marine
Mammals Bill, aims at prohibiting the shooting of polar bears,
walruses and sea otters from aeroplanes.

Japan

The Japan Animal Welfare Society is slowly earning recogni-
tion in Japan. Its membership has increased considerably and.
for the ﬁrst time, a member of the Imperial family showed
patronage by attending a ﬁlm premiere which was given for the:
society in Tokyo and raised approximately £1,000.

The ﬁeld of work is being extended. In Kyoto great advances:
have been made since a branch of JAWS was started there last
year. An enthusiastic and eﬂicient committee has improved the
conditions under which experimental animals are kept both by
building new kennels and by providing anaesthetics to the Univer-
sity and. hospitals. In Yokohama a start has been made on
the same work by another active committee. In Sendai it has so far
been diﬂicult to arouse sufﬁcient interest to maintain the work
adequately, but it is hOped that. improvements are in sight.

An important programme is in hand for teaching children to:
love and care for animals. Essay contests have been arranged and
talks given in schools.

Good co-operation is being obtained from veterinarians and.
municipal authorities. There is a movement to establish a centre
where spaying can be carried out by veterinary surgeons. If
this materializes a vast amount of suffering will be eliminated
During 1961/62 over 46,000 dogs were collected up into dog
pounds in Greater Tokyo; of these 20,000 were destroyed and

12.000 were sold for experimental work.

One of the greatest needs is an increase in the strength of
trained, salaried staff. Unless there are sufﬁcient capable and trust-
worthy inspectors to visit the pounds and experimental centres the
improvements that have been achieved at such cost in labour and
money will be lost. The work is too much in its infancy for
supervision to be relaxed in any way.

It is hoped that it. may be possible to provide and run a
mobile dispensary as soon as a veterinary surgeon and driver can;
be obtained.

Although the money raised in Japan is increasing in amount
the Society is still mainly dependent on funds coming from foreign
sources. Contributions will be most gratefully received by the
Japan Animal Welfare Society. 179 Gloucester Place, London.

Testimony in favor of H.R. 1937 and S. 3088 for the humane treatment of experimental
animals by Christine Stevens, President, Animal Welfare Institute, New York

For the past decade the Animal Welfare Institute has devoted the major part of
its resources to studying the treatment of experimental animals in this country and
to improving that treatment by the means now available. In the course of this effort,
we have visited scientific institutions throughout the nation and have provided advice
and information to thousands of scientists, administrators and technicians. For ex==
ample, more than 17, 000 copies of this manual, ”Basic Care of Experimental
Animals, " have been requested from us by institutions in 48 states and 43 foreign
countries, and we have provided them in all cases free of charge in an effort to help
animals and science.

Here is another manual provided by the Animal Welfare Institute free to scienm
tific institutions which are planning new animal quarters or remodelling old ones .
It is entitled "Comfortable Quarters for Laboratory Animals" . Architects' floor
plans and photographs of existing good quarters are collected together, and new
supplements are brought out to keep this publication ---=- the only existing one of its
kind -~ up to date . We put these together by hand with the help of volunteer workers,
and are just now completing the filling of requests from over 600 laboratories as a
result of the new supplement. We provide at cost the film, "Handling Laboratory
Animals", and the 951=page text, ”The UFAW Handbook on the Care and Manage=
ment of Laboratory Animals", published by the Universities Federation for Animal
Welfare, "An Introduction to the Anesthesia of Laboratory Animals", by Dr.Phyllis
Croft, and until recently, "The Principles of Humane Experimental Technique", by
Russell and Burch. We send our bi-monthly Information Reports to all the 7, 000
members of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology and to
many other scientists and medical men. We have provided speakers (for example,
an expert on animal technician training) and specific advice on request. In short,
our educational effort has been arduous and continuous, and we often find the ma=~
terials we distribute in evidence in the course of laboratory visits.

Why, then, since our educational work in animal care seems to have had such
an encouraging reception from scientists do we urge enactment of mandatory federal
law to require humane treatment of these animals ? The answer is simple: our ins
spections of the actual animals in laboratories and examination of published l.itera==
ture on their use reveals great cruelty, callousness and neglect in laboratory after
laboratory throughout our nation. Further, it has been disappointing to find that a.
rational and courteous approach to obtaining decent treatment of animals so often
fails, whereas on those occasions in which adverse publicity was brought to bear,
the needed changes were made . This is disappointing because we would all like to
believe the claims, so often put forward by opponents of H. R. 1937, of unfailing wisa
dom, kindliness and responsibility of laboratory directors with respect to the animals
in their institutions . It is regrettable that we cannot simply put our trust, as the
opponents urge us to do, in all Deans and Directors of laboratories, and I would
like to give some examples from our experience typifying the situation. as it exists
today - without mandatory legislation for the protection of experimental animals ..
showing why in so many instances voluntary control by these men has not prevented
and will not prevent cruelty in laboratories.

The first problem is unreliability. Let me give you examples from some well-
known institutions . (Names of institutions and individuals will be provided on request
if the Chairman desires them.) I) In more than one instance, doctors in charge of one
hundred or more laboratory dogs stated that they were exercised regularly in runways
which they showed us. Check-ups revealed that the runways were not used. 2) The
Director of a large medical school about whose treatment of animals we have been
complaining for six years, wrote to an individual who requested permission to visit
the animals, “I can assure that we extend ourselves to the utmost to make sure that
animals used for research in our Medical Center are given the very best and most
humane care. We are proud that we have met the strict requirements of the ASPCA
as well as those of the Animal Welfare Institute. Beyond the two organizations men-=-
tioned above, we do not encourage visitation to our animal quarters since we are
careful to protect them from exposure to unaccustomed people or possible contamina-
tion. Your interest in our animals, however, is deeply appreciated." To give you
some idea of this particular doctor's idea of extending himself to the utmost, let me
read you the notes we published on a visit to his laboratory (Information Report, Vol. ll,
No. 1.) "All dogs caged, never released for exercise.

Three emaciated dogs curled up and uninterested even though most of the dogs were
barking furiously . A grey poodle with incredibly matted f‘ur, with food and filth
stuck in it. said he had trimmed it once, so it must have been there
for a long time . The dog did not respond in any way but stood mute and motionless
in its cage . A black and tan mongrel was too tall to hold its head normally. When
standing, the dog’s back was rubbing against the top of the cage . The university rem
fused to build cages any bigger despite urgent requests to do so when the building
was first constructed. . .Post-Operative dog room: many were too sick to rise, some
had had two operations . One heart surgical case was emacipated, had a tremor and
lacked one eye from which red flesh extruded. first explained dog‘s
condition as brain surgery, but later decided the dog had lost his eye and developed
chorea before coming to . Apparently, this did not deter its use for
heart surgery. The dog drank water almost continuously. No attendants in any of the
dog rooms . Asked if dogs as sick as those we had seen can get up for hosing of cages
said they could. He said none of the dogs we saw had been given any
sedation ..... Many rabbits, like some of the dogs, were in cages too small to stretch
oru in normal resting position. Two rabbits quite often were squeezed into one such
small cage . Their noses were running in many instances and there were sounds of
coughing. The room was very hot and ammonia prickled the observer’s nostrils.
Rats were generally better housed though some were extremely overcrowded despite
the presence of empty cages, and some had been blinded by radiation till their eyes
actually disappeared, Mice had the most comfortable cages of all the animals."

 

 

 

 

Naturally, ,we lodged a strong protest against the use of our good name to whitewash
these conditions, and we received a letter admitting that our name had been used in
error. When I requested permission a few weeks ago for a visiting British scientist
and animal welfare worker to visit, I was referred to the Public Relations Department
and was told, "Send her to Cornell or somewhere, but not here ." According to the
"Summary Tables for the Total Extramural Program" 5Tthe Public Health Service
Grants and Awards by the National Institutes of Health, this institution received more
than seven million dollars of the tax—payers' money in 1961 . For that amount of mone-
ey, I think we can expect to have at least such obvious desiderate as a few pens to
which dogs can be taken for exercise.

To complete this group of instances, I would like to read the testimony prepared
by Mrs. Frank Wilson who is unable to be present in Washington.

STATEMENT OF MRS. FRANK WILSON IN SUPPORT OF H.R. 1.937 and S. .3088

I would like to put on record my experience of visiting the animal quarters of
a well=known New York City hospital in the summer of 196.1. I went there as a rep:
re sentative of the Animal Welfare Institute, which has access to the animal. quarters
of the hospital under the terms of a legal agreement entered into by a lady who sold
her home to the hospital.

The Institute set out to investigate after seeing a newspaper report that a dog had
fallen off the roof of the hospital, smashing through the windshield of a car parked in
the street below. The hospital was quoted in the paper as saying that the dog had
squeezed through a hole in a wire fence surrounding the exercise area on the roof.
When I arrived I found that there was no fence . The dogs were simply turned loose
on the roof, round the edge of which. there was nothing but an obviously inadequate
knee=high concrete ledge which was part of the original structure of the building.

No attempt had been made to adapt the roof for use as an exercise pen.

I found. that the experimental dogs were kept in small, dirty, meshubottom cages
with no bedding, in a dark, dirty, smelly little room that was so infested that not only
the animals but the floor and walls were alive and crawling with various kinds of ver-u
min, These vermin were breeding in a heap of excrement; they were so thick; on the
floor that they were walking over my feet as I stood there. This in the same building
as s supposedly sanitary hospital area!

The dogs were to be used for heart surgery and blood donations and. some were
sick: yet they were left without water on a hot summer day, because the water pans
designed to fit the cages had rusted through so they would not hold water and nothing
had been done about it.

Having seen these conditions, the Animal Welfare Institute complained to the hos-2
pital authorities. We were told that little could be done because the ticks and vermin.

 




-3-

had become immune to insecticides, and in any case, Dr. A who was in charge of the
animal quarters was on vacation in Europe.

At this point a reporter on the New York Post investigated the situation and a
very critical story about conditions in the hospital appeared.

1 then paid a second visit to the animal quarters and found that the heaps of excrem
ment had been removed and the 'un—killable' vermin exterminated. I also saw hanging
on the wall a certificate licensing these animal quarters under the New York State
HatchaMetcalf act. I had not seen this certificate before and it is my belief that it was
not in its place at the time of my first visit. The certificate.“ stated that Dr. B. was
in charge of the animal quarters. Dr. B. was not the Dr. A. we were told was on van
cation in Europe: so far from that, Dr. B. was working in the hospital the whole time
and receiving a federal research grant of approximately $60,000.

In my opinion this laboratory was being run in an irresponsible way. It is doubts
ful whether research on animals kept in grossly insanitary conditions after major sure»
gery, without sufficient drinking water, is sufficiently conclusive to merit the expendi»
ture of large sums of public money on it. Furthermore, to allow such a heavy
infestation of vermin to deve10p in a hospital, and to allow dogs to run on an open roof,
seems to me to show a culpable disregard for the health and safety of the public . 1 also
believe that the conditions in the hospital caused considerable unnecessary suffering to
the experimental animals .

I understand that H. R. 1937 would curb such abuses as I have described, and I
sincerely hOpe such legislation will be ad0pted.. (End of Mrs. Wilson's statement)

The attitude of the progressive educator has invaded research laboratories in a
form that often paralyzes any action against cruelty by individuals . For example, one
medical school Dean assured me that cruel people ”could get off in a corner and do it
anyway." He seemed to take the side of these sadistic characters when he spoke about
the pending legislation and with apparent relish remarked, "If I wanted to 1 could hide
everything away and fool the inspector through the whole Medical Center ." One wonm
dered what he felt needed hiding in this institution which last year received $22., 000, 000
from the U. S. Public Health Service.

Another laboratory director exemplifies a different aspect of the same problem.
He lacks the courage to stop cruel experimentation in his own institution even though
he personally disapproves of it. All humane scientists are concerned about the im~
proper use of the drug curare and the many synthetic substitutes for this paralyzing
drug now available. As you know, these muscle-relaxants cause a human. being or
animal to lie limp, motionless and completely helpless without the power to move or
cry out no matter hbw terrible the pain being suffered. So concerned did the officers
of the American Physiological Society become over misuse of these drugs that in 1959.
Dr R. F. Pitts in the President' 3 Message published in “The Physiologist", recoma
mended that the members of the editorial board of the”American Journal of Physiology”
act as arbiters of humane experimental design. He said this task would not be re=
lished, but "my personal view is that each editor must be exactly that (an arbiter) in
as impartially a scientific sense as he is the arbiter of the scientific adequacy of the
man's experimental design and the validity of his conclusions . The American Physiw
ological Society could scarcely concone by publication results obtained in experiments
violating our accepted code for the humane care and use of animals ." Subsequently
the Society adopted the policy whereby papers could be refused for publication if they
did not meet the editors' humane standards. Two such cases have come to my atten-=
tion. In one, the director of the laboratory referred to above did not approve of the
experiments on curarised dogs, yet he permitted these and other painful experiments
to be done and left it to the editors of the ”American Journal of Physiology" to say in
effect, "This is too cruel. We cannot condone it, and we will not publish it. ”

The National Society for Medical Research, chief Opponent and organizer of sci-=
entific opposition to H.R. 1937, sent out a survey to the editors of 4:65 scientific
journals to ask them "how they feel about censorship of scientific reports on humane
grounds ." They gleefully reported that less than one percent of those who replied
would refuse to publish on these grounds. In short, the view of the NSMR and such
editors as wrote to it, is that no torment is too frightful, no agony too prolonged to
be inflicted in the name of science - or as Dr. Maurice Visscher put it, "There can
be no cruelty in the pursuit of knowledge.‘

These are chilling thoughts, but they must be faced squarely, for this ruthless
ideology has adherents in many laboratories, and its proponents are seeking to de-
velop it wherever they can, in high school and even, sometimes, in grade school
children, by teaching them to perform painful experiments on animals .. experiments
which can provide no useful knowledge but which create callousness and offer fera-
tile ground for any, sadistic tendencies to grow.

Men who wish to indoctrinate untrained youths in useless pain infliction cannot be
expected to be concerned about unplanned and improperly conducted experiments in=
side scientific institutions . Many such experiments are not even submitted for publi=
cation, much less published. Such work involves none of the "burdensome record
keeping” to which some opponents of H. R. 1937 have so passionately objected, I will
mention just one of the reports we received, in which a student cut legs off frogs and
put the still living animals in various fluids to see if the legs would regenerate. No
one hindered this crude parody of a scientific experiment.

Here is a report we received on student surgery in a leading veterinary college:
”Whenever dogs were to be operated on, they were by many surgical teams allowed
to come so far out of their anesthesia that they actually made attempts to rise and
walk. It is unnecessary to describe, is it not, just how unpleasant a series of sen»
sations must have been felt by these victims, with the tops of their skulls chopped
off, their carotid arteries exposed and cannulated and several nerves exposed?"

I have seen dogs in medical schools upon which a series of major operations has
been done, pitiful, cringing, emaciated creatures . Let me show you a picture from
a, scientific journal that will give you an idea of how some of the dogs in laboratories
look. Fortunately, there is some tendency away from this type of practice surgery
course, for example, the University of Florida Medical School recently eliminated
this course from the curriculum. However, others still cling to the practice. That
it leads to grave abuses even beyond the long-drawn-out pain caused by the series of
operations will be testified to by another witness, and I would quote from a letter from
a student who writes that ”Veterinary students at do survival. surgery
on dogs. They do a series of operations such as Opening the stomach, removing the
spleen, removing parts of the intestine and joining it together again, routine castra=
tion and spaying, and other operations . The dogs become thin and pitifulmlooking and
if they become ill as a result of the operations, they receive no treatment because
they are going to die anyway. The doors of the kennel are closed at 5:00 P.M. so
that if the operation is done late in the afternoon, the student cannot see that the dog
comes out of the anesthetic all right. It is stated that dogs are hard to get. Owned
dogs which owners have asked to have destroyed and which have been left at the vets—4
erinary college with that understanding are sometimes used for the surgery classes
and kept alive for a series of operations by students . The owners are not aware of
this . "

 

Opponents of H .R. 19.37 will tell this Committee that even larger amounts of
money than they are now receiving from the government is all that is needed. It is
oru experience that in visiting new laboratories it is common to find large amounts
of money spent on stainless steel and shiny tile, but these are far from being a
guarantee of. decent treatment of the animals. In a medical s'chool fitted out with
long stretches of gleaming corridors we found cats being kept in cages with nothing
but wide=spaced one =way wires for floors . There were two cats in each of these
cages, and in every case, one of them was perched on the feeding bowl. to keep off
the wires that pressed into their sensitive paws . In this same institution we saw a
big jar full of White mice, piled on tOp of each other, upon which it was proposed to
pour a bottle of liquid ether in order to kill them, the burning qualities of the liquid
being disregarded. Here, too, we learned that large numbers of mice were dying
of what the highly paid research worker thought was a mysterious disease but which
turned out to be his failure to see that the animals upon which his research depended
were given food that they could get their teeth into. They were being starved to death
by ignorance and irresponsibility. What of the dogs in this institution? One lay dead,
not yet observed by anyone, despite the endless assurances by the National Society for
Medical Research of which I would like to give just one example. "Research Dogs are
More Pampered than Pets, Kid-Gloves in the lab. If a Texas millionaire wanted to
give his pet hound the world's finest care, he would be hard put to equal the kidu-gloves
treatment which thousands of dogs receive today in modern animal research laboratom
ries throughout the nation." This wildly untrue release was used, according to the
NS‘VMR by 200 publications . How does this jibe with a manual gotten out in the NSMR's
home state and recommended by one of its most active board members ?

Here is the University of Minnesota's recommendations on. ”How to Clean a
Dog Cage ., .. ,After feeding all of the dogs in the area assigned to y u, go back and
remove any dead dogs from their cages .” On the next page it shows how to hose
a dog cage with the dog in it: "Open the door slightly, holding it so the dog cannot
jump out. Run the nozzle over the top of the door as shown in the drawing at the
right. Washzzthe walls and bottom grate. Then run the nozzle under the door to
flush out the catch pan :” incidentally, these quarters are new, less than two years
old, so the decision to house dogs in basement cages three tiers high without prom
vision for exercise and to hose the cages with the dogs inside was deliberate
According to the St, Paul Dispatch, February 16, 1.961, 700 dogs are housed thus,
and a spokesman for the medical school was quoted as saying, "Research is big
business at the university In fact, goi'l’ernment and foundations last year backed
our medical re esearch with more than three million dollars in grants .” Business
is a lot bigger this year with a total of $9, 1520, 965 of the taxmpayers8 money given
this university by the National Institutes oi Health in 1961 ..

In a far western medical school with the same glossy corrido s and expensive»
ly equipped operating rooms more than one hundred dogs cower ed and yelped in a
steaming windowless room which had just been hosed, dogs and all. Most pitiful
were those whose painful and debilitating surgery prevented them from rising and
who were soaking and shivering in the bottoms of the wet cages from which they
would never be taken again unless it were for further experimentation or as carcases ,

All but a handful of the many millions of animals that enter our laboratories
each year, dogs, cats, monkeys, rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters, rats and mice
are, of course, killed in the laboratory, Some are lucky, They are anesthetized
and never brought back: to co onsciouwsness Somentoolurnay talieiupartoin a painless
test and be anesthetized and. killed at the concluswn But there are uncounted
myriads of others whzs) e death is inflicted in. a slow and pain-.111 ma iner, and there
is an enormous variety of ways in which they may be made to suffer and, die in the
laboratory. Many involve far more agony and terror than the methods Congress
has outlawed for the slaughter of animals that provide us with food. For example:
exposure of rabbits to microwaves "produces an extremely violent reaction,
Within ﬁve minutes desperate attempts are made toe escape from the cage, Perim
pheral engorgement of all Vessels yields and acrocyanotic picture ., The ears
develop a 'fried' or ”cooked" appearance. Forty minutes of exposure results in
death." Or starving dogs to death, sometimes in conjunction with. Inajor opera»
tions, for example, in one experiment the dogs were subjected to two separate
operations in which the surgical mortality was so high that "the animals were not
studied or standardized before surgery," ("Complete bilateral paravertebral
ganglionectomy and denervation of. both adrenal glands .") It is reported. that "one
dog died during the first fast and another during the first realimentation with
casein. " For when the dogs were finally allowed food, it was not a balanced diet,
One was calculated to "show many features characteristic of a rather seve re
alarm reaction." The authors report that ”Selye states that fasting is an alarming
stimulus and sensitizes the animal to other alarming stimuli," The dogs, now
having been subjected to two major Operations, starvation up to six weeks, and
feeding with. an improper diet, “dermatitis, cutaneous ulcerations and alopecia"
in the sympathectomized dogs "were much more frequent and often intense .“ The
authors show their familia r'1ty with starving dogs, s tating: ”Normal, healthy dogs
tolerate prolonged fastu 1g surprisingly well, During the first 2 or 3 weeks they fre=
quently appear stimulated. and are unusually playful and lively, later their reactions
are slowed but they are usually in good. condition for as long as 5qu weeks .11

It should be recognized, iowever, that the layman's idea of; “good condition” and
that of some scientists are iazrtlie er apart thatt the inexperienced person, could believe
possible , The fact is well demonstrated. by the photographs of the dogs in the Overm
holt Clinic case. Dr. Frederick Panico who did major surgery on these dogs, using
the heartulung machine on them, described them as in ”good condition“ as the court
record shows Other witnesses emphatically contradicted this For example, " ,we
found eleven. lite dogs and the remains of a dead dog Just 01.. uside me gate that en=
tered the shelter, there was a thin black mongrel lying on its side Part of its chest
area had been clipped, and there was an open. running wound about midwa ay to the
clipped area." At autopsy, this dog was found to have more than a litre of pus within
the heart sac and. between 600 and 700 cubic centimetres of pus free in the chest cavi=~
ty. So much. for ”good condition,”

Other photographs may help to demonstrate other kinds of suffering . For exam-
ple, these white rats have been forced to swim to complete exhaustion. Some have
sunk, and others are sinking . Once they have gone through this desperate attempt to
keep from drowning, they are taken from the tank, and "After a specific period the
animals must again swim to exhaustion." (emphasis supplied) A report on a com—
mercial drug in ”The American Journal of Medicine" April, 1962,, glibly refers to the
"rat swim"test which is used as a standard measurement.

Here is an illustration of another standard device advertised in scientific jour-
nals: "This low cost restraining cage and holder, " the ad runs, "for rats permits
rapid and safe immobilization of animals . It can be used for extended housing of
rats during nutritional studies, when animals must be kept from attacking tubes and
other fixtures ." As the illustration shows, the rat cannot turn or stand because the
so=called "cage" fits him more snugly than a coffin fits a human body. Note the in-
vitation to use it for ”extended housing ."

Here you see a monkey in a monkey chair . His brain has been stimulated with
electricity. With him is Dr. John Lilly who wrote in a popularization of laboratory
activities*,"electrical stimuli placed by mean of fine wires in specific portions of
the brain can cause either intense rewarding or intense punishing experiences in a
particular animal and in humans . This has been demonstrated in rats, cats, mon-
keys, and in later years, dolphins.” One method is described as follows: "The
crescendo-stimulus method was worked out with the macaque (monkey), One puts in
a train of stimuli that starts at zero intensity and'during the next fifteen seconds is
gradually built up beyond the level at which the animal can stand it. A sophisticated
animal will push the switch in order to stop the gradually increasing stimuli. before
they reach an unbearable level. . .A monkey will miss and allow crescendo to go
through its peak until he is so strongly stimulated that he is in a state of panic, -
when he cannot possibly shut. the current off."

The monkey chair now being more and more widely used as standard equipment,
thanks to Dr . Lilly and others at the NIH and Walter Reed. Army Institute of Research,
is now considered a ”living unit" according to a paper in The Proceedings of the Ani-
mal Care “Panel, Vol.7, No. 2. Speaking of the old days before monkeys were kept
in the equivalent of the stocks for months at a time, the paper states, ”The chair
and strap arrangement allowed so much freedom of movement that the monkey often
struggled for long periods of time to free itself and was often injured in the process ."
In the newer models "It is usually necessary to grasp the hair on the monkey's head
to guide it through this opening while the lower plate is raised still further. The
lower plate is raised to the point where the monkey is effectively pinned between the
seat and the upper plate, thus restricting his activity. . . .At this point the panels may
be a little tighter than they will be for final adjustment since. the tight panels serve to
quiet the monkey. . . .It is necessary to check the monkey frequently for several days
until it becomes accustomed to the chair .. During this period its activity may loosen
some of the adjustments or require that others be made . After the monkey has
adapted to the chair, a regular inspection is required to check for decubitus which .
may occur at the neck and waist panels but is much more likely to occur in the region
of the callosities ." The author in an apparent burst of magnanimity states that since
it only takes five or ten minutes to do "there is no reason why the monkey should not
be taken out of the chair occasionally and put into a cage. This would help to main-
tain muscle tone, prevent decubitus (bed sores) and allow grooming ." However, he
states that he has maintained monkeys in the chairs continuously for periods of two
to five months, and "spinal preparations" that is, monkeys whose spinal cords have
been severed, for weeks in a slightly modified chair.

For additional examples, I should like to place in the record those included in
this recently published information Report of the Animal Welfare Institute .

It needs to be emphasized that a very substantial proportion of the actions being
taken in a majority of animal laboratories would constitute pros ecutable cruelty were
they done by a private citizen outside the laboratory. Laboratories are specifically
exempted in a number of states from the provisions of the anti-cruelty lac/s which
apply to all other citizens. Even where there is no specific exemption, the ordinary
antimcruelty laws are not equipped to deal with this vast field any more than they were
equipped to deal with slaughterhouse cruelty, to prevent which Congress so wisely in-
tervened. Federal legislation is even more needed for laboratories than it was for
slaughterhouses .

To take a few homespun examples, if a man took his cat and gave it electric
shocks so strong that it stiffened out as if poisoned with strychnine, then when it had
recovered from that he slapped it, shook it, held it by one leg - "carried this kind
of treatment of the extreme and prolonged (it) over many minutes" till the unfortu-
nate cat (and I am quoting from a scientific paper) presented the following picture,
"explosive autonomic discharge was seen, including panting, piloerection, defeca-
tion, urination, batting and clawing all at onec ." If one saw this taking place, any
decent citizen would call the police if he had not the courage to intervene personally.
However, all this is published as a matter of course inigthe pages of "Science”.
Admittedly, it is much less painful than many of the procedures being carried out
every day in hundreds of laboratories .

' Again, in the simple matter of housing, here is a picture of a breeder's kennel.
He was prosecuted and fined for breeding dogs in thse cages .* Yet I have repeated-
ly seen mOther dogs with nursing puppies in even more crowded conditions in lab-
oratories; such breeding has even been reported in scientific papers and the high
mortality of the pups recorded.

Many more examples might be given, but these should suffice to show that a
double standard exists, even at the lowest level.

The privilege which our civilization has extended to scientists is being abused.
The uninformed believe that animals are used for experiments only when it is really
necessary, that they are decently housed and cared for and that avoidable pain is
prevented with care and assiduity. If H.R. 1937 is enacted into law and its provi-
sions properly administered, this belief will be correct, but at the present time, it
is very far from the case.

How can H.R. 1937 bring animal experimentation in our country up to civilized
standards ? '

First, by careful inspection of laboratories by men whose character and training
fit them for the work, As you are, aware, H.R. 1937 is based on legislation which has
been successfully in effect in Britain since 1876, and in the administration of this bill,
we would urge a careful study of the means whereby the British Act has accomplished
so much good for animals and for science too. All inspectors under the Act in Britain
have medical qualifications. Medical training alone is not enough, however, the in-
spectors must have humane regard for animals and firm, moral character .

Second, by placing individual repponsibility on each scientist who uses animals .
This is accomplished by licensing, and it should be emphasized that individual licens-
ing is one of the most important, perhaps the most important reason why the British
Act, though so moderate, is so effective. There would be no purpose in passing any
bill in our country for the purpose of requiring humane treatment of experimental an-
mals if the bill does not include individual licensing. Opponents wish to dispense with
this vital provision knowing that the bill cannot be enforced without it. We have had
long experience in observing the Operation of state laws, most of them passed at the
behest of the NSMR fro the purpose of procuring animals. These laws provide for the
licensing of institutions, and, in theory, the license might be withdrawn for cause,
but an infraction of the law calling for suspension or revocation of license would put
a halt to all animal experiments throughout the institution. The result of such legal
draughtmanship is that the innocent must suffer with the guilty or the law is never en-
forced. The latter is generally the case. Clearly, Congress ought not to follow this
highly unsatisfactory pattern. ~

Third, by the limitation of pain infliction amounting to torture . In England, every
license carries with it a series of conditions, among them those known as the Pain Con-
ditions which provide that animals that are suffering must be painlessly killed as soorr
as the main result of the experiment has been achieved and that if an animal "is found
to be suffering severe pain which is likely to endure, such animal shall forthwith be
painlessly killed." Further, if an inspector finds an animal suffering considerable pain
and directs that it be destroyed this shall be done at once . These principles have been
incorporated in H. R. 1937. ' "

Fourth, minimum standards of care and comfortable housing are required.

Fifth, student work, as distinct from research conducted by qualified scientists,
must be painless .

Sixth, records adequate to allow the inspectors to enforce the law are required.
Because an issue has been made on this subject by opponents of H. R. 1937, the
allegations of”red tape” and "burdensome record keeping” should be carefully exa
amined. To be a modern scientist and not keep records is obviously unthinkable .
The greater the emphasis on the statistical approach the more records necessarily
have to be kept. This is not the fault of H. R. 1937 which asks no more, so far as
records and identification of cages or animals than every responsible scientist now
keeps. The false rumor has been spread that each individual animal used (for ex-
ample, a thousand mice in a single experiment) would have to have a separate piece
of paper filled out for it and that that is what British scientists are now doing! It
should be obvious to any thinking person that this is not the case a as one British
scientist now working in the United States put it, ”Reading some of the propagan—
dist literature circulated to me recently by the scientific societies of which I am a
member, 1 have had a feeling of unreality about the whole affair, engendered by my
inability to recognize, in their descriptions of the restrictions and burdens under
which their British colleagues labour, the system under which 1 worked for so many
years; sometimes 1 have wondered what cloudacuckoo land they have confused with
Great Britain.” H. R. l937 is in no way more demanding than the British Act upon
whose principles it is based. The record in question would show what the responsi-
ble research worker must know if his work is to have any meaning: how many ani-
mals, what procedure was used on them, what happened to them. All well==run
laboratories have cages or animals or both marked so that they do not get mixed up.
H. R,. 1937 would require all laboratories that receive federal funds to come up to
proper standards in this respect. 1 have been in many laboratories where cages are
unmarked or have old marking unrelated to their current occupants . In one hospital,
1 observed dogs whose cages were identified with the name of a doctor who had not
used dogs for two years .

Another aspect of the soacalled "red tape" which has been attacked are the pro=
jectoplans. Every scientis who gets a grant from the federal government has to
present his experimental plans in far greater detail than anything called for in H.R .
1937. He has to wait considerable periods before he learns whether his grant has
been accepted or not. Unscrupulous Opponents of H. R. 19.37 have~ deliberately mis—
led many scientists into believing that the Same" would hold true with regard to the r
submission of promectaplans in this bill. The truth is kthat the bill was most care—-
fully drawn to prevent any possible delay. Project=plans must be preafiled, not
prewapproved. There can be no delay because the scientist is at liberty to proceed as
soon as his plan is on file . Supposing that he later finds a different promising avenue
of approach, will his original projectaplan cover him legally? If there were no dif—
ference in the procedures relating to animal suffering, it probably would. If, on the
other hand, he decided to change foom an experiment involving no pain to one involv-
ing pain, he would clearly have to let the Secretary know of this change . I have some
plans as used under the British Act if the Committee wishes to examine them. As
you can see they are brief.

What is the purpose of filing project=plans ? From the moral standpoint, to en-
courage the most humane design of experiments. From the practical standpoint, to
make possible effective enforcement of the measure without needlessly wasting the
time of the scientist or the inspector. 1f inspectors had to start from a basis of com-=-
plete ignorance of the experiments being carred on, they would have to ask a great
many questions, get corroboration from others, and end up perhaps, with a confused
report, aggravating to all concerned. But when the inspector has the facts in hand,
the projectwplans clearly in mind, and finds the cages properly marked, he can do an
efficient job of inspection within a short time, and, if all is in order, be on his way
again.

H.R. 1937 would not in any way hamper humane and responsible scientists. An
even stricter law in England has not hampered them. In England the experimental
plans must have prior approval from the Home Office . Under H.R. 1937 the potenc-
tial delay which conceivably might occur in our much larger country, has been elimi-
nated by placing the burden on the Secretary to disapprove if he believes the law is
being violated, but not to require prior approval.

At the end of the year each licensee would send to the Secretary of Health,
Education and Welfare reprints of his work published during the year and a brief re-
port on the numbers of animals used, procedures used, and names of co-workers.
Thus the previous records are annually confirmed. Here is a sample of the onen-
page form for the animal report under the British law. As you can see, it is not
demanding . No more than half an hour would be required to fill it out.

 




-9-

To conclude the list of basic principles of the bill, it should be noted that it
applies to all vertebrate animals. These are the animals whose central nervous
system is more or less similar to our own, who have brains and spinal cords
and nerves which, among the mamals especially, closely follow the human pattern.
It is clearly essential that all these:creatures be treated with humane consideration.

I would like to place in the record a letter from Dr. P. L.C. Carrier, recently
retired Chief Inspector carrying out the provisions of the British Act of 1876 . . .I
hope that we may have a man of equal stature working directly from the Secretary's
Effice, not and I wish to emphasize this point, from the National Institutes of Health
or the PUB-lie Health Service, to administer H. R. 1937.

H. R. 1937 is a very moderate bill. It is opposed both by those who say it is
too strong and those who say it is too weak. It is not a bill that aims to punish,
rather it provides a strong incentive for humane design of experiments and humane
care of animals. At present, there is virtually no incentive for scientists to plan
experiments humanely-~the only one I know is that I mentioned earlier by the
American Physiological Society, and it is weak and variable . But if a scientist
were aware that his project-plan might not be accepted if his planning were need—
lessly inhumane, he would take the trouble to devise a more humane method. If
he knows his license might be suspended or even revoked for failure to comply
with the humane requirements of the law he would take the trouble to see that his
animals were decently cared for and not abused. Other proponents of this legis-
lation will, no doubt, emphasize the waste of funds that is a concomitant of the
irresponsible attitude with respect to animals which is so widely seen in labora-
tories today, so I will merely point out that while the cost of administering H.R.
1937 would not be great, the amount of tax-payers'funds it would save would be
bery large indeed. And in saving these funds it would simultaneously be saving
something much more important-—a thing which it is essential to save if we are
to call ourselves civilized-mthat is needless suffering of animals being used for
2113. benefit to protect 93‘. against the sickness and annihilation that 2/: fear.

Dear Miss Stevens:

Thanks for your note. I checked our catalogs
and have found that we do not have a copy of the
book you mentioned,"First Aid and Care of Small An~
imals," although the type of pictures mentioned
sound as though they would do very well. Please go
ahead and select the ones you feel would be best.

I can't tell you how much we appreciate the
effort you are making, but I trust that this article
will be beneficial to your project. Thanksagain.

"Sweethea rt”

BY RICHARD H. HOFFMANN, MD.

HERE COMES a time in life
T when it is a bit anachronistic

to use the appelation of “Sweet-
heart” to a human being. When
I was young I would ﬂing the term
at any fascinating female, just like
a grapefruit squirts juice, in all di-
rections without any speciﬁc aim or
intention. It is a word that is de-
leted from one’s vocabulary when
arteries harden and amatory pursuits
are untimely pretensions.

But “Sweetheart” is a beautiful
and endearing term. I hated to drop
it from my lexicon. And, I remem-
bered that King Lear called one of
his dogs “Sweetheart”——why
shouldn’t I? So I called by little
Yorkshire terrier “Sweetheart,” and
it was something like the recall of
my youth every time I called her.

My wife has raised four Yorkshire
terriers who supply an interest in
her life. She gives them the scrupu‘
lous care that they demand, and
they repay her with affectionate
loyalty. We wanted another female
for breeding and bought “Sweet-
heart.” She was, however, not ac-
cepted by the others.

They snarled and bit at her and
kept her at a distance. She was an
unwelcome intruder into the family
circle. They were like a biblical tribe
who refused to accept a stranger into
their midst.

So Sweetheart was ostracized and
I adopted her. She was separately
groomed and fed and she slept in
my bedroom. She became my per-

6

(Presidem 0f the Imzitm‘e for
H ”mare-Animal Relationship :)

sonal friend—my “Sweetheart.”

She is a beautiful animal with
a golden face and a silver body. She
would venture into my ofﬁce at times,
sit on my desk and kiss my hand in
gratitude for my attention. Many of
my patients would ask for her when
they came for treatment.

And one day the widow of my
dear friend Norman Bel Geddes,
the celebrated artisr and designer,
came to see me. She is a charming
and talented woman who at the time
revealed the sorrow of her bereave-
ment. She saw “Sweetheart” and
there was an immediate empathy
between them. She fondled and
petted the little dog and “Sweet-
heart” reciprocated her affeCtion.

I could read a yearning in the eyes
of my friend. “Would you like to
have her?” I asked.

“More than anything I can think
of,” she replied.

And so I IOSt “Sweetheart”, but
I brought happiness to a human
being and cemented a warm friend-
ship. We now have something in
common that transcends the aver-
age relationship between friends. I
have given her a living thing that
I loved, and that I know she loves
as well.

Animal Lovers On
Watch For Cruelty

To keep alerted and informed, all
who desire can help by making their
voices heard against cruelty.

All animal lovers should: 1) request
their local theatre to show the grand
Walt Disney Epic, “Greyfriars Bobby”
greatest of dog pictures showing un-
swerving fidelity of man’s best friend,
the dog.

2) See “All Living Things” black and

3) Get Animal Welfare Reports, 22
E. 17th St., N. Y. 3, N. Y. issue of
March—April, 1961, which reveals
among other important facts the fol—
lowing letter directed to the President
of the National Parent Teachers Con-
gress, Mrs. James C. Parker, on the
subject of humane education.

A LITTLE DOG LEAPS FOR LIFE

“The instinctiveness in all creatures
for self preservation is an admitted
fact.

“Though man gradually destroys
himself by unnatural living habits long
before his time, if forced with extreme
torture or death, with all his strength
he will try to save himself.

“His closest friend in the animal
kingdom, the dog, is equipped with the
same shield of self preservation.

“But one would scarcely expect that
our four footed friend would have to
protect himself against man to whom
he attaches himself; But he does!

“Of all iniquities, none is greater,
more demoralizing or more bestial than
vivisection, men and women do not
acknowledge this because they do not
know. They have been brainwashed
into believing that the Vivisectors
chamber produces advances in science
and medicine. In this they are fooled.

“The Vivisectors can produce only
two things —— demoralizing and de-
spiritualization of the Vivisector and
fear in his fellow creatures who he

sears, scalds, scathes, gouges, maims
and finally kills.”

An example of this horrendous fear
which grips animals is seen in the
following story which formed the Epi—
logue of the gorgeously beautiful Grey—
friars Bobby 1961 memorial Booklet
issued by the Scottish Society For the
Prevention of Vivisection, 10 Queens—
ferry St., Edinburgh 2, Scotland. Here
it is.

EPILOGUE
A LITTLE MIRACLE IN 1960

“Shortly before the Walt Disney
studio re-created Greyfriars Bobby in
an epic film, a little miracle happened.
A dog jumped from the roof of a
twelve-story hospital, crashed through
the windscreen of a stationary car, and,
except for a few cuts on his paws and
legs, was unhurt. The little miracle
occurred in New York City, on Twelfth
Street, fifty feet east of Seventh Ave-
nue.

A hOSpital attendant caught the dog
and hauled him back to the labora-
tory. It would have been a bigger
miracle if a friendly dog had escaped
from that unfriendly place.

The hospital doctors marvelled that
the dog was not seriously injured; vet-
erinary surgeons from the A.S.P.C.A.,
New York (the American S.P.C.A. that
sends homeless dogs to the vivisection
laboratories under the Hatch-Metcalf
Act), certified the dog as fit. The hos-
pital authorities refused to discuss the
nature of the experiments to be per-
formed on the dogs in their possession.

The fate of the one little dog who
wanted to get back home epitomizes all
laboratory animals everywhere.

Today many pe0ple who do not know
the history of vivisection plead for a
compromise with all who perform pain-
ful experiments on animals. Their
stated case that “half a loaf is better

FOR IM‘IEDIATE RELEASE ALBERT SGE’IEITZER MEDAL
AWARDED T0 AUTHOR PAUL
KEARNEY BY ANIMAL WEL-
FARE INSTITUTE

 

NEW YORK - The 1957 Albert Schweitzer medal of the Animal Welfare In-
stitute, awarded annually in recognition of an'outstanding contribution to the
welfare of laboratory animals, has been presented to Paul W. Kearney, new3paper~
man and freelance writer for his article "The Case For Humane Vivisection'f ap-
pearing in the current issue of Coronet magazine.

The Animal Welfare Institute created the Albert Schweitzer medal in
195,4 at which time a gold replica was presented to Dr. Schweitzer. The Insti-
tute works for the welfare, humane treatment and correct housing of laboratory
animals. It Opposes unnecessary and cruel experimentation, as well as the
growing tendency toward painful and senseless eXperiments conducted on living
animals by school children.

In his Coronet article, Kearney reveals some of the shocking abuses
and haphazard eXperimentation conducted in the field of animal research. He

contends that there is today, virtually no limitation on what anyone with a

kitchen knife can do to an animal as long as he wraps it in the protective

cloak of scientific research. Kearney further deplores unrestrained animal
experimentation in high schools, and the approval of fatal feeding tests on

living animals for students in the primary grades.

 




In.making the presentation to Mr. Kearney, Christine Stevens, Presi~

dent of the Animal’ﬁelfare Institute stated that ""The Case For Humane Vivi-

section' published in the new issue of Coronet is a most powerfu1 blow in the

ANIMAL WELFARE INSTITUTE

The Animal Welfare Institute works to reduce suffering of animals in labora-
tories, in slaughterhouses and on trap-lines, and to develop humane attitudes in
the coming generation. The Institute is a non-profit, educational organization
which gives thorough study to present-day cruelties, making first-hand investi-
gations of the conditions under which animals are used and killed for human

beneﬁt. It also supports needed legislation for the prevention of cruelty.

The Institute publishes educational literature for the guidance of animal

users, including two manuals, “First Aid and Care of Small Animals" and “Hu-

mane Biology Proiects”, which are distributed to tens of thousands of school

teachers throughout the United Sates for classroom use.

The Albert Schweitzer Medal of the Animal Welfare Institute carries the words
of Dr. Schweitzer which express our belief: “Reverence for Life" and “We need

a boundless ethics which will include the animals also.”

friend; of animalr, inc.

The action program of Friends of Animals is based on these vivid statistics:
America's pet-owners each year permit some 33 million puppies and
kittens to mature, but permanent homes exist for only 8 million of
them. The rest — some 25 million dependent creatures —— face
abandonment and starvation or — at best — destruction.

To reduce this cruel surplus our volunteers work to promote the spaying of fe-

male pets and thus to prevent the birth of the unwanted, the little-valued, and

eventually homeless animal. In effect, we repair the leak in the boat instead of
constantly bailing it out. Ours is a non-profit organization that educates pet-
owners to prevent the birth of puppies and kittens they cannot personally keep,
that subsidizes the costs of spaying for lower-income pet-owners, that assists
animal shelters in a program of controlling animal births through spaying. Our
goal is A NATION WITHOUT A SINGLE HOMELESS CAT OR DOG.

Dear Miss Draper:

Thank you for your inquiry of September 20th. regarding
an article for Pet Life Hagasine dealing with your Institute.

I am enclosing a letter from Eloise Keeler, Editor of Pet Life
Magazine which answers your inquiry in detail.

The Simian Society, though in a sense is also an humane society,
deals more with Pets, as does the above magazine, the care of
these pets and the joy of their company.

I am returning your information am! article in the hope that
you will find some other magazine interested in this which would
print the article.

With best wishes ,

Sine ere 1y yours ,

Dear Dorothy Eradford:

~The enclosed material was.sent to me from our publisher's
office in Oakland. I was atont to answer the letter when
I saw that it was addressed to you.

Regarding material of this type ~~ we avoid most material
about laboratory animals, humane slaughter etc. While we are
in deep sympathy site these movements and all organizations
which attempt to halo and better the lot of animals, we feel
that PET LIFE should be slanted toward loving and caring for
pets in the positive ~~ not mentioning the negative side of
the picture except when absolutely necessary. Also, we are
interested in PETS, not laboratory, work or meat animals. I'm
sure you will understand.

If you would like some copies of PET LIFE containing your
article for the Simian Society, let me know and I‘ll send them
to you.

You may enclose tais letter to Estella Draper of the Animal
Welfare Institute if yon like.

And thank you.

PET LIFE is the official consumer magazine of the National Retail Pet Supply Association, Inc. and the Western Wholesale Pet Supply Association, Inc.

 




The Animal welfare Institute, a non-profit national organization founded
in 1951 to promote the welfare of all animals, is particularly interested in
reducing the suffering and improving the care, housing and treatment of animals
used in experimental laboratories. Through visits to laboratories throughout
the country, complaints about the many shameful abuses observed in the course of
such visits, and offering of practical advice on how to correct them, the
Institute works directly with scientists. It provides to scientists, upon request
and free of charge, two comprehensive illustrated manuals entitled "Comfortable
Quarters for Laboratory Animals" and"Basic Care of Experimental Animals".

The Institute favors the enactment of national legislation similar to the
British Act of 1876 for the protection of laboratory'animals. It supports H.R.
1937, new pending before Congress, which provides for the humane treatment of
laboratory animals used in research institutions receiving Federal grants and in
departments and agencies of the Federal.Government.

To help prevent cruel experiments by school children and.youths, the
Institute publishes two other illustrated manuals "First Aid and Care of Small

Animals" and "Humane Biology Projects"; these are distributed free upon request

to teachers and others in the educational field.

The Institute since 1953 has awarded annually the Albert Schweitzer Medal
in recognition of outstanding humane achievements. The award for 1960 was made
to two humanitarians in Africa: Chief A. S. Fundikira and.Mrs. Isobel Slater,
President and.Executive Director respectively of the Royal Society for Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals, Tanganyika'Division, which has approximately h0,000 African
members, with nearly 800 branches and smaller centers throughout the country. It
works actively to protect both wild and domestic animals from.cruelty and.needless
destruction.

The Institute also devotes its efforts to helping animals used for food and
fur; it was active in securing passage of the Federal Humane Sﬁaughter Act of 1958

and.is working with other humanitarians in the interest of more humane methods of

 




trapping.

ZMeMbership in the Institute is $10.00 (for individuals and organizations)

and $2.00 (for individuals only). These fees, plus donations, pay the operating
costs of the Institute. Persons interested in joining, or in receiving more
information concerning the Institute's work, are invited to write to Animal

welfare Institute, 22 East 17th Street, New York 3, New York.

THE PASSING or ERNEST HEMINGWAY has removed from our midst not only
one of the greatest of writers but one of the kindest of men, especially when
it concerned animals. At their former home outside of Havana, he and his wife
‘Miss Mary’ kept countless cats and dogs, all strays. His favorite, according to
columnist Earl Wilson, was on old dog, blind in one eye. Hemingway washed its
eye daily. And when Papa bathed himself, he always used the same brand of
soap and lotion -— because the blind dog followed him by scent, and he didn’t
want to confuse the animal.

When we observe the annual National Dog Week (in September) and then
National Cat Week (in November), let us not fail to say a little prayer for one
who let nothing interfere with utmost consideration for his pets.

SLOWLY BUT SURELY the battle on rabies is taking a turn for the better. Total
incidence of rabies in the U. S., as reported by the Animal Research Service
at the Federal Department of Agriculture, has dropped from 7,288 cases in
1940 to 3,428 cases in 1960—thanks largely to the efforts of veterinarians
and public health officials. Rabies cases in dogs in the entire year totalled
only 697 and in cats 288. On the other hand, there was an increase in cases
in non-domesticated animals, with foxes at the top of the list with 910. You
can help win the ﬁght by keeping your pet from running loose (and coming
in contact with infected wildlife) and/or having him vaccinated.

V F rom a checklist prepared by
Animal Welfare Institute

The cage in which you’re tak-
ing this delicate creature home is
merely a “carrying cage.” It should
not remain in so small an enclosure
for more than a weekend at the
most.

9 A regular cage should have
perches and a swing, as well as
water and seed-trays.

The cage should be placed in
a high, light place in the room
away from excessive heat, away
from direct sun-light, and away
from drafts or cold.

8

b"

6 At night, cover your pet’s
cage lightly with a dark cloth. It

will make the bird feel secure.

9 The cage at all times should
be stocked with fresh, clean water,
gravel (without which the bird is
unable to eat), parakeet seed, con-
ditioner food and, occasionally,
“treat” seed. Cuttle-bone and a
mineral cake should also be pro-
vided in the cage.

Be sure to keep cleaning out
the leftover shell and replenishing
the fresh seed. Do not mistake left-
over shell for uneaten seed.

0 Your bird is a baby and may
be unable to ﬁnd the Seed trays.
Therefore, sprinkle seed — along
with gravel—on the floor of the
cage.

8 Cleanliness is essential to bird-
keeping. “Gravel paper” on the
ﬂoor of the cage will also make
your pet more comfortable.

0 Your bird should be given
small quantities of “greens” (let-
tuce, etc.) several times a week.
Luke—warm bath water in a
shallow dish should be provided

several times a week.

m In getting acquainted with
your bird, move slowly and speak
softly. They are delicate and are
easily frightened.
