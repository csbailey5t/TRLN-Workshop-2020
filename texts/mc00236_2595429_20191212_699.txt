GREY FOX

 
   
 
 

Jonathan London

 

 
 

I
I saw a fox
dead, in the middle of the road
grey fox, laid out across the center line
I scooped up the still warm body
—so supple yet, the head lolling
and the tail, the body bending toward earth
with an awesome weight——
and laid her gently in the back of my car
no bone protruding, eyes
still open, ears
pricked for sound: a life caught
in the heart’s eye

driving thru dawn down River Road——
the bare trees lifting ghost arms
through the drifting mist layers—

I think of where to leave her

I think of ﬁelds, some open place with wild grass
where turkey vultures wheel . . .
maybe down by the river:

I know a place

I will go there now

lay down softly this part of me

to some quiet I don’t yet know

give back this part of me

to what

left it for life
jays squawking from a nearby tree
knelt in grass and sd a little prayer

grey fox, may your spirit run free
may it do what it likes
may itﬁnd its new home, sd

BIRDFOOT’S GRAMPA

The old man

must have stopped our car
two dozen times to climb out
and gather into his hands

the small toads blinded

by our lights and leaping,
live dr0ps of rain.

The rain was falling,

a mist about his white hair
and I kept saying

you can’t save them all,
accept it, get back in
we’ve got places to go.

But, leathery hands full
of wet brown life,

knee deep in the summer
roadside grass,

he just smiled and said

they have places to go to
too.

Coincidence

 
 

The instant the owl flew into the car windshield
my grandfather died. And that was coincidence.

   

0n the same day, a year later, the pipes froze

   

and the dog died. That too was no more than coincidence. But now

   

two years later I am sitting in the kitchen alone

 
 

and a hunter in a black and red jacket is knocking

 
 
     
 

on the front door. He wants to hunt
on my land. When I tell him something will die

 
 

he says, ”A deer, my friend. Just a deer.” Crossing the back lawn

  
  
 

  

he climbs over the stone wall at the wood's edge
and tosses his cigarette into the wind. It is morning. Clouds

 
 

are passing and the shots that echo through the valley

  
 
 

 

are followed by the apprOpriate cries. The animal
playing it just right is taking long strides into the open field

   

where she caves in

  
      

the chest still pumping blood
the head still pulling as if the legs will follow. And here he comes

 
   
 
 
 
 
 
  
   

to slice her from rectum

to Adam's apple. And the coincidence? The second death?
It has nothing to do
with me. At the window, in my T-shirt,

I am watching his tight fist heave entrails
back at the woods. The woods are a dark green.

We have all had enough.

WIDENING THE ROAD

No one I know was asked

If he wanted the shores of earth
Cut back

Beneath three new feet of blacktop,
if he wanted commerce edged nearer
His door.

If anyone asked me

I'd tell him

How these shoulders arc in August,
Electric with thistles

And chicory's Christly blue,

That nothing he pours could match
Such gravel-throated songs.

I'd say how aSphalt means the deaths
Of animals scrounging salt or grit,
And in my dreams

Huge carcasses hang glowing

From the roadside limbs of trees.
I'd say how earth needs all the places
Where winds bed down

With the darkness and weeds sleep
In only their thin, black shawls—-
Where animals,

Fast in those urgent waters,

Are climbing into the moon.

I'd tell him this is the corridor

I walk in, that leads me home.

That like these others

I too need luck

And a wide berth on a narrow road.

ROBERT GIBB

 




 

 

A TRILOGY FOR THE CREATURES

 

Furry pelts lie limp beside the road.

They are the coats animals lost

crossing in heavy traffic. The surrounding

woods did not push these creatures

into streets, but that bloody encroachment

of rampant develOpment urged these little relatives
into tattoos on skin of dark asphalt.

*

Do not ask the traveler why he hurries.
(He does not know.)

A timeclock of business runs his body.
He's long since forgotten nature

& how the measure of seasons, the earth's own

impliment of instruction

grants repose in the face of growth.

To know how death accosts the innocent

I ram my hand into the chest of a doe lying beside the road.

She is still warm with the fire of the forest running inside her.
I pull out a rib, smearing myself with blood.

I want to become grotesque by the side of the road;

I want to frighten death into a corner, so that

measure of heart meets measure of growth'

& all animals can cross over

like Christ walking water.

Something in the Road

I brake

hard, know

I can't stop in time
line up the bird
between the blackwalls
check the rearview see
the head tucked down
the bird still

on its feet.

What was it?
deaf, distracted,
too scared to move?

.Bird, my car

passes over

like the hand of God

or some dark cloud.

You are chosen.

All are chosen.

In the road untouched

you wing and lift my heart

TURTLE ON THE ROAD V"

As I drove past the stone

I saw it was a turtle

hauling himself across the highway
in the burning summer sun.

I pulled onto the shoulder

and ran back hoping

not to see him go under;

a truck rammed past—-

but he was still crawling

far out in the center.

I reached him and carried him
to the side he was aimed at:
painted turtle, tapered disc,
pale orange underplate

marked with faint scratches.

I carried him the hundred yards
to the bank of the river

and set him on a rock-shelf
inches above the water.

But he stayed all drawn into himself.
The ancient brain that sent him
out of the lake

across the long dryness

told him to go nowhere,

not to loosen his clench now.

I was in a hurry,

so I picked him up and held him
down into the water,

and lifted him out

all gleaming and dripping,

and looked into his heavy, blinking eyes.

I held him again

under the water,

and this time he quickened,
as if he had suddenly

 

-. “ugh" ~,- .

 

 

 

 

 

h ' Va DA‘. *Wra .‘~“-\.~ “‘_ .. -. M‘ -‘

 

 

 

remembered the bottom,
the mud, the wavering weeds. . . .
The long, curved, slender claws
of his feet spread out,

his head stretched out,

and he struggled to swim.

I opened my hand,

straining turned to gliding,

and I watched him slip down
and disappear,

paddling wildly,

into the cold, green

country of the river.

FREEWAY DRIFTER

Young airedaTe, you Iope anng—-
Strong easy strides, you sweep
The factory streets, by broken gIass
And gritty cardboard
And pause,
Investigating . . . Listening . . . Sniffing . . . .

Up and off again, trotting in rhythm, head roating high,
You jag to the right,
Drift across scattered pebees,
And your gait is easy and sure -- you're a drifter.

You round a corner,
The traffic roar grows . . .
(No shouIders on the freeway here, just a fence)
Don't go round that offramp post!
Don't go round that fence!

Your woon head bobs in the backwash of the river road,
Dazing scream and whoosh . . .
A biting cIoud invades your nose,
Storms of grit sting your bobbing eyes and head . . .
Look out! Look out!

You dodge a roaring demon on oId highway 17.
Look out! Look out!

Lone drifter, you danced a few Tong moments there --
In the roaring madness you pIeaded.
Mute and anne,
Too soft and slow --
HeIpIess
In the river rush of empty metaI cans.

BTood oozes from your smashed bones,
The freeway beIIows and churns, sucking in and spewing out.

Where have you gone?

OPOSSUM QUESTIONS

There's something dead,

struck by a car on Webster,

near the sunken railroad tracks, on the street
where all the junked car parts are sold.

Curled up on itself,

around the last beat's pulse,

eyes open, and a bald, pathetic curlicue
of a tail, headed in its own direction.

No naturalist,

I don't immediately know what it is:

it could be a cat or else racoon, but isn't,
it has the fuzziness of porcupines,

a fox's skinny nose, but finally the tail
gives it away for an opossum.

It was struck just once, no blood is visible.
In the still untampered morning,

the buses and the semi's,

all the used and new cars drive around it,

so unlikely and past help a sight.

Is there a family? Do opossums live

in families? Do they know?

Would they have tried to drag it off,

down by the railroad tracks, to the unkempt fescue
and the runaway weeds? What do opossums eat?

Who could even answer questions like these?

An hour later, driving by again,

it's as I feared——

there's no sign of it having been there.
The opossum's disappeared.
