Dear Friend of Whales:

Thanks so much for writing. You can help save the whales by
writing new to Secretary of State Alexander Haig, who is well
disposed towards Whales. Thank him for his support in the past
and ask that he use the authority of the State Department to
reduce fish allocations to Japan in our 200~mile zone.

The enclosed leaflet reports on the objections to International
Whaling Commission decisions taken by Japan on the killing of
sperm.whales and on the use of the cruel cold harpoon to kill
minke whales. Nerway and Iceland, too, have filed objections to
the change in method of killing minke whales mandated by the IWC
for the next whaling season. Please ask Secretary Haig to support
prompt action under the Pelly Amendment to the Fisherman's Protec-
tive Act to embargo fish products from all of these nations unless.
they withdraw their objections. Secretary Haig may be addressed
as follows:

The Honorable

Alexander M.'Haig, Jr.
The Secretary of State
Department of State

You can help, too, by writing to the Foreign Ministers of the three
countries that have filed objections, urging that these objections
be withdrawn. In both Norway and Japan there is a division within
the government itself. The Agriculture Minister for NOrway has
written to the Fisheries Minister complaining about the agony
caused the whales by use of the cold harpoon. We suggest that you
write to the Agriculture Minister thanking him for his humane stand
and urging him to persuade the NOrwegian government to withdraw

the objection. The address is:

Here are some facts you may wish to use in your letters: .Whaling
nations have been on notice for four years that the cold harpoon
would have to go. It was banned for large whales at the 1979 IWC
meeting, and the necessity for development of a humane method has
been discussed at every meeting of the IWC since 1974 when Mr. Fujita,
the Japanese Commissioner, blocked discussion of the anti-cruelty
issue on a technicality: namely that it had not been placed on the
agenda of the meeting 60 days in advance. All whaleekilling methods
developed to date are painful. They would not meet the standards of
any nation's humane slaughter laws. But the cold harpoon is the
most agonizing of all, and it is used on the small minke whales

to prevent loss of meat. Because the whalers have reduced the
populations of larger whales to the vanishing point, it is the

small minkes who now must bear the brunt of the dying industry's
greed. As Professor Derek Ovington, Australia's Commissioner to

the IWC, pointed out, the sum total of pain inflicted on whales

has actually increased in recent years because of the large number
of minke whales being killed for the Japanese market.

Dear Friend of Whales,

Thanks for writing. If we all work together, protesting the
killing of whales, these large-brained creatures can be saved from
extinction.

made an appeal for an end to commercial whaling. We will soon be
sending out the tapes of Mr. Baryshnikov's televised public service
announcements, which were filmed by NBC on August 6.

sent, and we will dispatch them to the person you indicate in your
letter. The tapes are 10 seconds, 20 seconds, and 30 seconds long,
very beautiful and moving as Baryshnikov's love for whales, and
indeed all animals, comes through strongly. A young whale anui its
mother swim gracefully in the badkground as he speaks for them.

There are many other ways, too, in which you can help to bring
the necessary pressure on the whaling countries to persuade them
to stop. The three countries that kill the most whales are Japan,
the Soviet Union, and NOrway, in that order.

Here are some suggestions for action:

1) Phone 3 local gutomobile'degle; who gellg Japanege egg;
and ask him to relay to the manufacturer in Japan you: opposition
to the harpooning of whales. You may wish to use information in
the enclosed leaflet to make your points.

2) Boycott products from Jgpan, Russia gnd Nogpgy. write
or phone manufacturers to tell them you are boycotting and why.

3) Fast-food chains use fish from whale killers. Much of
the fish sold in American fast~food restaurants comes from Japan,
Iceland and Norway. You cgn help put pressure on the whalers py_

ygiting to the fgst-food compgnies gnd urging them to stop buying
fish from the whaling countrieg.

the whale products. Virtually none of the whaling by the Soviet
Union. Norway. Iceland, Spain. Brazil, Peru or South Korea would
continue without the Japanese market. The Japanese government not
only subsidizes the Japanese whalers, but also the foreign whaling
operations through purchase of the whale meat at artificially—high
prices. Most of the whale meat consumed in Japan is fed to convicts,
soldiers and schoolchildren. three groups who have no choice in what
they eat.

Tell the Japanese foreign minister that it is time to put this
bankrupt industry out of business before they put the whales out of

Dear Friend of Whales: 9/28/78

The next meeting of the International Whaling Commission is sche-
duled for Tokyo in December. No doubt the politically powerful All
Japan Seamen's Union will be out in force to demand that the Commission-
ers vote high quotas allowing more whales to be killed. At last year's
IWC meeting in Tokyo, hundreds of union picketers carrying signs in
favor of whaling, stood or marched outside the Foreign Ministry while
the meeting was going on, frequently shouting in unison. Although there
are less than 800 seamen still employed on the whaling ships, and though
each worker who loses his job in Japan receives a substantial subsidy,
still this big union irresponsibly urges more whale killing - killing
that inevitably will eliminate the very jobs it claims to want to save.

To try to combat this situation, a friend of the AWI has made a
suggestion that we believe you will want to support. That is, to con-
tribute money for the express purpose of changing the employment of these
last few whalers and training them for other more humane and ecologi-
cally sound means of making a living. If each person who receives this
letter would mail a dollar bill to the Prime Minister of Japan with a
request that it be used for this purpose, a substantial amount of money
would be available. Those persons who have a vested interest in killing
whales would be non-plussed, while the many Japanese who would like to
stop whaling (as indicated by a recent survey) would be solidly backed
up by this demonstration of our good faith in the struggle to save the
whales from extinction.

Please send your dollar, to help Japanese whaling crews learn other
trades, to Prime Minister Fukuda. Tell him what you want the money to
be used for and why it is so urgent that commercial whaling end. Please
write your own letter, or if you are too pressed for time, clip off the
coupon at the end of page three and mail it with your dollar to the
Prime Minister.

Following is background information you can use in writing.

The save-the-whales campaign has forced the Japanese whaling indus-
try into virtual bankruptcy by steady quota reductions from 1973 to 1977.
Once Japan had seven whaling fleets scouring the oceans in search of
the ten species of great whales. Last spring, they were forced to scrap
two of their last three fleets. Once there were more than 10,000 work-

ers in the Japanese fleets; today, fewer than 800 remain. Japan's catch
of whale meat this year is less than 3% of the peak tonnage 1n 1964.

Now, Japan's last whaling fleet survives only with a $10 million
annual subsidy from the Japanese government. That is more than $12,000
per worker! The money would be better spent training the workers for
other skills.

While the Japanese whaling industry disintegrates, the Japanese
whalers are insidiously expanding outlaw whaling Operations around the
world. These unregulated whaling stations and pirate ships now kill more
than 5,000 whales, most from highly-endangered stocks and many from "pro-
tected" species.

For example, the Japanese whalers last year exported a modern stern
trawler fishing boat to Chile, where it was converted to a combination
factory/catcher boat. It was renamed the Palmy Star III and given a
permit by the Chilean government to take 500 whales per year. According
to the Chilean government, the boat is being leased by Japanese interests
to a Chilean company that has close ties to Japan's giant Taiyo Fishery
Co. The whale meat is shipped to Japan.

The transfer of the ship to a non-IWC country and the purchase of
whale products from an unregulated whaler is in violation of two resolu-
tions adOpted by the IWC in 1977.

The Japanese whaling company Nippon Hogei owns the whaling station
on the north coast of Peru, another non-IWC nation. There, 1800 whales
are killed annually, including the rare blue whale, reports famed con-
servationist Felipe Benavides. The whale meat is shipped to Japan.

Japanese whaling interests support the whaling stations on the
north coast of Spain, where hundreds of whales die each year, including
blue and humpback whales. Japanese meat merchants oversee the butcher-
ing so that only the best cuts of meat are sent home to Japan. Japan
also buys most of the whale meat from the South Korean whaling stations
that kill more than 1000 whales outside any regulation.

For years, the notorious pirate whaling ship Sierra has roamed the
South Atlantic off the African coast, slaughtering thousands of whales
in an area totally off limits to IWC whalers. Entire herds of whales,
including nursing mothers and babies, are wiped out. Japanese on board
direct the butchering.

Earlier this year, the Sierra moved its base of operations to the
Canary Islands, off the coast of North Africa. A second rogue whaling
ship, the Tonna, joined the Sierra to increase their massacre of whales

to 80 per month. The Tonna was another former Japanese boat, the Shun-
yo Maru.

The ownership of the Sierra Operation has been hidden through a
dummy corporation in Lichtenstein, Beacon Sierra Ltd. But now there are
reliable reports that the pirate operation is owned 75% by Japanese
whalers and 25% by Norwegian interests.

Fortunately, the Sierra's sister ship, the Tonna, sank in July. It
was sunk by a whale! The incident occurred 200 miles off the coast of
Portugal. The Tonna had already killed nearly 100 whales and was hea-
vily laden with 450 tons of frozen whale meat.

The Tonna harpooned a huge fin whale and, as the carcass was being




winched onto the deck through the stern slipway for butchering, it rolled
over, pitching the ship on its side. The engine room flooded through
open portholes and hatches. As the Tonna began to sink, the crew of 42,
including several Japanese, scrambled into lifeboats.

The crew reported that the 52-year-old captain, a Norwegian named
K. Vesprhein, refused to leave the ship. He was last seen clinging to
the bridge with a beer bottle in his hand as the Tonna went under.

The fact that the Sierra and the Tonna have been captained by Nor-
wegians and used Norwegian harpoons places Norway in clear violation of
IWC resolutions against aiding or supplying unregulated whalers.

Because of Norway's open subversion of even the IWC's own meager
whale conservation quotas (Norwa also sells its harpoons to the outlaw
whalers in Spain, Peru and Chile{, the Animal Welfare Institute has de-
cided to expand its boycott campaign to include Norwegian products.

We urge you to turn your economic pressure against Norway just as
you have against Japan and the Soviet Union. The Japanese business com-

munity is desperately seeking to end Japan's whaling and get us off their
backs.

Write a strong letter to Norway's Prime Minister Odvar Nordli

c/o Embassy of Norway
2720 34th Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20008

demanding that Norway halt its commercial whaling -- it is the third
largest whaling nation after the Russians and the Japanese -- and that
Norway halt the manufacture and sale of the deadly harpoons that are
driving the great whales to extinction. Norway is an oil-rich nation
that has no need for this bloody business.

Since we wrote to you in May, the last Australian whaling station
has decided to close. Your letters to Prime Minister Fraser helped to
bring this about. But it was barely in time for the whales that sw1m
past the Australian coast. Studies released last month show alarming
figures for a pOpulation of whales that Australian scientists had, as
recently as the last IWC meeting, been claiming was quite normal. It
is essential that this pOpulation, in the region the IWC designates as
"Area V" not be attacked by Russian and Japanese whaling fleets, now
that the Australians have given up. And it is essential that the popu-
lations of whales in the WeStern North Pacific not be decimated. The
big male sperm whales were so intensively hunted there ten years ago that
the p0pulations are expected to continue to go down even‘if'no whales
are killed in certain parts of this huge expanse of ocean. Nevertheless
the zero quota which should have been voted at last June's INC-meeting
was not set, and the outlook for the Tokyo meeting is grim.

YOUR LETTERS ARE OF ENORMOUS IMPORTANCE AS WE APPROACH THIS FINAL
PHASE OF THE CAMPAIGN TO SAVE THE WHALES. After you have written and

sent your dollar to Japan and written to the Norwegian Prime Minister,
please let us know if yOu want to continue to be kept informed on the
progress of the fight for the whales. we must remove from our mailing
lists those who may no longer be interested. So please use the enclosed

and we'd like to know what responses you receive from your letters.

UPDATED SUGGESTION December 1, 1978

It would be especially helpful at this time to send an airmail
letter directly to Norway's Minister of Environment:

Mrs. Gro Harlem Brundtland
Minister of Environment
Post Box 8013 DEP

Oslo 1, Norway

Mrs. Brundtland is sincerely concerned about wildlife and the
environment, and it is important that she know of the great desire
throughout the world that Norway should take a leading role in pro—
tecting the vanishing whales. Our last circular letter gives the
necessary background information. Respectful, supportive letters
to the Minister are vitally important now. An airletter may be
purchased at the Post Office for 22¢, or 31¢ worth of stamps may be
affixed to an ordinary envelope. This effort is worthwhile in the
battle to save the whales. Thanks for your help!

Dear Friend of Whales,

This editorial from the Los Angeles Times tells the sorry tale
of events at the Tokyo meeting of the International Whaling Commis-
sion (IWC), December 19-21.

 

Please let the governments of Japan, Norway and Russia know how
you feel about the results of this meeting. Let them know you will
not buy anything imported from their countries until they stop com-
mercial whale killing.

In writing to Japan and Norway, ask how they justify the subver—
sion even of the IWC's inadequate regulations? Ask them why the Whal-
ing Commissioners they sent to the meeting voted against a binding
resolution which would have prevented a continuance of the sordid
dealings with outlaw whalers? (see column 2 of the editorial) You
may wish to send this editorial to Mrs. Brundtland or Prime Minister
Ohira at the following addresses:

A Whale Swims ToWard Oblivion

The decision of the International Whaling

Commission to reduce the 1979 sperm- -whale catch
in the North Pacific to _,3 SOC—a 41% reduction from

this year’skill of 6,444—will do little to save the '

giant species from eventual extinction. .’ *1"
' More important than the lower overall quotas,
which merely reflect the obvious decline in sperm-
whale population, was the failure of the commission

to impose a zero quota on females of breeding age '.
- ' and on immature males. _
Only the irnposition of a size limit of 38 to 40 feet

could have guaranteed a reversal of the falling
birthrate, but, once again, Japan and the Soviet
Union—the world’ 3 major whaling countries— were
successful in blocking what would have been a
significant step toward conservation.

. Young males Will continue to be fair game in the

North Pacific, and the Whalers can slaughter up to ‘

427 females under the new quotas. - .

The commission 5 action, taken at a speCial
session last Week in T0kyo, was against the advice
of its own scientific experts, and speaks more to the
political power of Japan and the Soviet Union than
it does to the commission’ 5 determination to halt the
‘ decimation of the sperm whale. _

- The United States, which gave up all forms of
whaling under a 1972 act 0f Congress, led the fight

in Tokyo for a zero quota on females— and there —
. was the faintest of hopes that Russia, which intends -

to phase out its entire whaling fishery within five
. years, might not oppose the U. S. position *

But, again, the Soviet and Japanese delegations 3
stood together and were able to control a majority
on the 17- nation commission.

The United States lost on still another major issue

.-1n Tokyo—its appeal for a regulation to prohibit

commission members from subsidizing or servicing
the operations of whaling nations that do not belong
to the commisSion. -

Ships from nine countries not bound by commis.
sion quotas are taking an unacceptable toll of coast-
al species—including the blue, the right and the
humpback. Most of the vessels are under indirect
Japanese ownership, and that nation buys most of

‘their catches. Norway, also a commission member,

supplies them with harpoons and other equipment. ..
It is clear subversion of commission regulations to

', proﬁt from the operations of what conservationists

call the “outlaw” fleets. But the United States was
unable to push through an effective regulation to

- halt the practice. Instead, the commission could
agree only on a nonbinding resolution deploring
‘ such duplicity.

So it goes. Another session of the International ;
Whaling Commission, another failure to face up to
the reality that the excessive slaughter of the great -
whales portends their disappearance from the seas.

That this should occur while the sperm and other

species are under the protection of an international '

April 2, 1979

Dear Friend of Whales:

Now is the time for the biggest push yet in the campaign to

Save the Whales. At the December 1978 International Whaling
Commission meeting in Tokyo, sperm Whale quotas were reduced

4r%. At the July 1979 meeting in London, we should try to
eliminate all commercial or, at least, all whaling using the
monstrous factory ships with their attendant aircraft spotters,
sonar and fast chaser boats mounted with the vicious explosive
harpoons that spread their great metal claws deep in the victim's
body and then detonate with a delayed charge. These are the
instruments of the war on whales-~a war we must stop.

Here is the plan we hope you will join in effectively advancing:
(1) Letter writing campaign; (2) Radio Public Service Announce-
ments by stars of stage and screen; and (3) Demonstrations.

Katharine Hepburn, Jack Lord, Gregory Peck, and Jason Rebards
have most generously donated their great talents in recording
appeals for the whales: and the Animal Welfare Institute has
prepared tapes for distribution to more than 4,000 stations all
over the country. ‘3 g gag help §g_make sure your community has
an opportunity to hear these inspiring messages by phoning your
local station and asking them to play these public service tapes
often. If your station has not received the tapes and would like
to play them, let us know, and we will make sure a copy is sent.

Check the following schedule of John Perry and "F10," the 40-foot
hot-air balloon in the shape of a humpbadk whaleﬁk They will be
visiting a series of U. S. cities this spring following their
Japanese tour. "Flo“ flew in Tdkyo, Kyoto, Osaka, and Nagoya
with extensive media coverage informing the Japanese public of
the urgent need to end commercial whale slaughter.

*See last page for "Flo's" Schedule

"Flo" brings an instant focus on whales wherever she goes. A
film is being made of her travels. It may include her visit to
the town you live in. we hope you'll join in a demonstration

if she comes to the area where you live. A form is enclosed for
your convenience in letting us know if you can help.

CENTRAL TO THE WHOLE CAMPAIGN IS WRITING LETTERS TO SECRETARY OF
STATE CYRUS VANCE. It will be impossible to Obtain a favorable
vote at the July International Whaling Commission meeting unless
the State Department makes a serious concerted effort to help.
It is our diplomats who should be using their special skills to
persuade other nations to vote with the united States for a
moratorium on commercial whaling.

We are told that Secretary Cyrus Vance is sympathetic to the
whales. President Carter's most recent pronouncements on whales
commit the Administration to preserve them: "As you know. I mm
personally committed to protecting the world's whales" (January 2,
1979). "I have favored a ten-year moratorium on all commercial
whaling since I was a member of the united States Delegation to
the united Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stock—
holm in 1972” (February 12. 1979).

Now it is important that Secretary Vance hear from you urging
him 33 933 5113 resources 9_f__ 5115 State Department _t_:_g achieve _a_
moratorium 25 commercial whaling this year. The cause of the
whales deserves the best and the brightest efforts. the tact and
savoir faire of top State Department personnel. It deserves the
use of incentives. A respected diplomat of long experience,
Secretary Vance can achieve this goal. Friends of whales must
make it clear how vitally important it is to them that he give it
high priority. «Tell him what is happening in outlaw whaling.

JAPAN'S PIRATE WHALERS MUST BE STOPPED. Japan has allowed its
whalers to establish large-scale whaling Operations under foreign
flags around the world in recent years. In this manner, the
Japanese whaling industry is transferring its ruthless destruc-
tion of the last of the whales to unregulated nations.

Operating from coastal stations and small factory/catcher ships.
these outlaw whalers are decimating highly vulnerable coastal




 

-3-

whale populations along the coasts of Africa, South America
and Asia. The whale meat is shipped to Japan.

In Peru, the Japanese-owned Victoria del Mar Co. has three
catcher boats killing as many as 1,800 Whales each year. In
February, a rare blue whale was struck, but it tore away from
the barbed harpoon to die at sea. The 75-foot carcass washed
ashore at the popular beach resort of Conchan, a gaping wound
in its side. The Peruvian station also reportedly hunts down
humpback whales, another species that is supposed to be totally
protected.

In Chile, a combination factory/catcher ship, the Paulmy Star
No. 3, is now taking 500 whales a year, including the extremely
endangered right whale as well as humpback, blue, sperm and

fin whales. Formerly a Japanese stern trawler, the Paulmy Star
No. 3 was sent to Chile by the giant Japanese fishing company,
Taiyo Fishery Co., in 1977. Taiyo employees reportedly Operate
the ship and oversee the Operation.

In Spain, two coastal whaling stations owned and operated by
Japanese are wiping out hundreds of Whales in the Bay of Biscay,
including blue and humpback whales. '

'Over the past two years, the Japanese whalers have set up a large
whaling operation in Taiwan with two stern trawlers converted to
factory/catcher ships. Flying the Taiwanese flag, these Japanese-
manned ships have been taking hundreds of Bryde's and sperm whales
outside any quotas and shipping the meat and Oil to Japan. The
Japanese government’s compliance is such that the outlaw whaling
ships, the Sea Bird and the Tai Gon Goh, frequently Operate in
Japanese waters around the Bonin Islands.

In early 1978, the Japanese fishing boat Shunyo Maru was converted
into the factory/catcher ship Tonna and sent to the Atlantic Ocean,
where it joined the infamous pirate whaler Sierra. The Sierra has
roamed the Atlantic for more than a decade, wiping out thousands
of whales in waters where the IWC has all whale stocks under total
protection.

Ownership of the Sierra has been hidden through dummy companies

in Liechtenstein and Cyprus, but informed sources say that it is
owned 73% by Japanese interests and 23%‘by Norwegians. Flying
various flags Of convenience (first Bahamas, then Somalia, now
Cyprus), the Sierra has ruthlessly hunted down every species of
whale to be found, harpooning even mother whales and their babies.
It even kills orcas (killer whales)!

 




-u-

When the Tonna joined the Sierra, the two worked in tandem to
kill 80 whales a month off the coast of northwest Africa. But
last summer, the Tonna sank, dragged to the depths of the sea
off Portugal by the carcass of a huge fin whale. The Sierra
continues to whale, however, and send its catch of whale meat
to Japan.

Pressured by the American conservation community, the U. S. has
raised the issue of the outlaw Whalers with the government of
Japan and the IWC. The scandal is too big to be ignored.

Tell Secretary of State Vance to take all steps to halt Japan's
complicity, including trade sanctions under provisions of the
Pelly Amendment. Ask him to request the member nations of the
International Whaling Commission to vote for a moratorium on
commercial whaling. Ask him to emphasize the necessity Q£_§§.

-whale is chopped to pieces in a mere half hour, making it into
chunks of meat no longer identifiable as to species, age or
condition. Factory ships nearly exterminated the great blue
whale and the singing humpback whale. If allowed to continue,
the whales will become extinct. Secretary Vance may be addressed

Dear Friend of Whales,

Under pressure from friends of whales, six Japanese whaling
companies recently consolidated into a single firm, dropping 11 of
Japan' s 3H whaling vessels. It is vitally important that these
excess vessels and equipment not be transferred to other countries

for continued whaling.

Please write to Prime Minister Miki urging him to bring an end to
commercial whaling by his nation and to ensure that as excess harpoons,
boats and other equipment are phased out, they are never again used to
kill whales. He may be addressed. 1

Thanks to your efforts and those of a constantly growing army
of whale protectors, there are, at last, some real signs that the
whales can be saved, but countering these are powerful forces being
unleashed by the greed of the dying whaling industry. The campaign
to save the whales has reached a critical point. WE MUST PERSIST.
WE MUST CONTINUE TO INCREASE THE EFFECT OF THE BOYCOTT 0F JAPANESE

AND SOVIET GOODS.
THE CAMPAIGN SO FAR

276 demonstrations using AWI whale campaign materials have
been held in 176 different locations throughout the United States
and Canada. Many friends of whales have organized two or more demon-
strations. MORE ARE NEEDED.

The Animal Welfare Institute has run 13H half and full-page ads
in 115 newspapers including The National Observer, The New York Times,
The Los Angeles Times, The Miami Herald, The Wall Street Journal, The
Dallas Times Herald, The Portland Oregonian, Newsday, The Hartford
Courant, The Seattle Times, The San Diego Union, The Portland (Maine)
Sunda Herald, The ProvidenceﬁTRhode Island) Journal Bulletin, The
Honolulu Advertiser and Star Bulletin, The Detroit Free Press, The
§22_Francisco Bay Guardian, Parade, The Washington Post and The Japan

,Times in Tokyo. This last-mentioned ad was headed "An Appeal to the
Japanese People" and it elicited a quick response from the Japanese
Whaling Association which ran a rival half-page ad attempting to
persuade the reader that "whale populations are now on the increase"!

Dear Friend of Whales:

In response to your request for information, I enclose the reprint
of an article I wrote for Defenders of Wildlife magazine reporting
on the last meeting of the International Whaling Commission.

After the last meeting of the International Whaling Commission,
the Soviet Union attempted to increase its kill of sperm whales
by requesting a postal vote by all the IWC Commissioners. Russia
wanted to kill 1,500 more of these great-brained whales. Luckily,
the Commissioners voted the proposal down emphatically: 16 to 3
with 3 abstentions.

We believe the tide is turning for the whales, but we must keep
fighting hard. If you would like to become a member of the Animal
Welfare Institute and be kept informed of progress in the campaign
for whales and dolphins, just fill in the coupon below. You are
cordially invited to join.

Dear Friend of Whales: 9/28/78

The next meeting of the International Whaling Commission is sche-
duled for Tokyo in December. No doubt the politically powerful All
Japan Seamen's Union will be out in force to demand that the Commission-
ers vote high quotas allowing more whales to be killed. At last year's
IWC meeting in Tokyo, hundreds of union picketers carrying signs in
favor of whaling, stood or marched outside the Foreign Ministry while
the meeting was going on, frequently shouting in unison. Although there
are less than 800 seamen still employed on the whaling ships, and though
each worker who loses his job in Japan receives a substantial subsidy,
still this big union irresponsibly urges more whale killing - killing
that inevitably will eliminate the very jobs it claims to want to save.

To try to combat this situation, a friend of the AWI has made a
suggestion that we believe you will want to support. That is, to con-
tribute money for the express purpose of changing the employment of these
last few whalers and training them for other more humane and ecologi-
cally sound means of making a living. If each person who receives this
letter would mail a dollar bill to the Prime Minister of Japan with a
request that it be used for this purpose, a substantial amount of money
would be available. Those persons who have a vested interest in killing
whales would be non-plussed, while the many Japanese who would like to
stop whaling (as indicated by a recent survey) would be solidly backed
up by this demonstration of our good faith in the struggle to save the
whales from extinction.

Please send your dollar, to help Japanese whaling crews learn other
trades, to Prime Minister Fukuda. Tell him what you want the money to
be used for and why it is so urgent that commercial whaling end. Please
write your own letter, or if you are too pressed for time, clip off the
coupon at the end of page three and mail it with your dollar to the

Prime Minister.
Following is background information you can use in writing.

The save-the-whales campaign has forced the Japanese whaling indus-
try into virtual bankruptcy by steady quota reductions from 1973 to 1977.
Once Japan had seven whaling fleets scouring the oceans in search of
the ten species of great whales. Last spring, they were forced to scrap
two of their last three fleets. Once there were more than 10,000 work-

ers in the Japanese fleets; today, fewer than 800 remain. Japan's catch
of whale meat this year is less than 3% of the peak tonnage in 1964.

Now, Japan's last whaling fleet survives only with a $10 million
annual subsidy from the Japanese government. That is more than $12,000
per worker! The money would be better spent training the workers for
other skills.

While the Japanese whaling industry disintegrates, the Japanese
whalers are insidiously expanding outlaw whaling operations around the
world. These unregulated whaling stations and pirate ships now kill more
than 5,000 whales, most from highly-endangered stocks and many from "pro-
tected" species.

For example, the Japanese whalers last year exported a modern stern
trawler fishing boat to Chile, where it was converted to a combination
factory/catcher boat. It was renamed the Palmy Star 111 and given a
permit by the Chilean government to take 500 whales per year. According
to the Chilean government, the boat is being leased by Japanese interests
to a Chilean company that has close ties to Japan's giant Taiyo Fishery
Co. The whale meat is shipped to Japan.

The transfer of the ship to a non-IWC country and the purchase of
whale products from an unregulated whaler is in violation of two resolu-
tions adOpted by the IWC in 1977.

The Japanese whaling company Nippon Hogei owns the whaling station
on the north coast of Peru, another non-IWC nation. There, 1800 whales
are killed annually, including the rare blue whale, reports famed con-
servationist Felipe Benavides. The whale meat is shipped to Japan.

Japanese whaling interests support the whaling stations on the
north coast of Spain, where hundreds of whales die each year, including
blue and humpback whales. Japanese meat merchants oversee the butcher-
ing so that only the best cuts of meat are sent home to Japan. Japan
also buys most of the whale meat from the South Korean whaling stations
that kill more than 1000 whales outside any regulation.

For years, the notorious pirate whaling ship Sierra has roamed the
South Atlantic off the African coast, slaughtering thousands of whales
in an area totally off limits to IWC whalers. Entire herds of whales,
including nursing mothers and babies, are wiped out. Japanese on board
direct the butchering.

Earlier this year, the Sierra moved its base of operations to the
Canary Islands, off the coast of North Africa. A second rogue whaling
ship, the Tonna, joined the Sierra to increase their massacre of whales
to 80 per month. The Tonna was another former Japanese boat, the Shun-
yo Maru.

The ownership of the Sierra Operation has been hidden through a
dummy corporation in Lichtenstein, Beacon Sierra Ltd. But now there are
reliable reports that the pirate Operation is owned 75% by Japanese
whalers and 25% by Norwegian interests.

Fortunately, the Sierra's sister ship, the Tonna, sank in July. It
was sunk by a whale! The incident occurred 200 miles off the coast of
Portugal. The Tonna had already killed nearly 100 whales and was hea-
vily laden with 450 tons of frozen whale meat.

The Tonna harpooned a huge fin whale and, as the carcass was being




-3-

winched onto the deck through the stern slipway for butchering, it rolled
over, pitching the ship on its side. The engine room flooded through
Open portholes and hatches. As the Tonna began to sink, the crew of 42,
including several Japanese, scrambled into lifeboats.

The crew reported that the 52-year-old captain, a Norwegian named
K. Vesprhein, refused to leave the ship. He was last seen clinging to
the bridge With a beer bottle in his hand as the Tonna went under.

. The fact that the Sierra and the Tonna have been captained by Nor-
weglans and used Norwegian harpoons places Norway in clear violation of
IWC resolutions against aiding or supplying unregulated whalers.

Because of Norway's Open subversion of even the IWC's own meager
whale conservation quotas (Norwa also sells its harpoons to the outlaw
whalers in Spain, Peru and Chile§, the Animal Welfare Institute has de-
cided to expand its boycott campaign to include Norwegian products.

We urge you to turn your economic pressure against Norway just as
you have against Japan and the Soviet Union. The Japanese business com-

munity is desperately seeking to end Japan's whaling and get us off their
backs.

Write a strong letter to Norway's Prime Minister Odvar Nordli

c/o Embassy of Norway
2720 34th Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20008

demanding that Norway halt its commercial whaling -- it is the third
largest whaling nation after the Russians and the Japanese -- and that
Norway halt the manufacture and sale of the deadly harpoons that are
driving the great whales to extinction. Norway is an oil-rich nation
that has no need for this bloody business.

Since we wrote to you in May, the last Australian whaling station
has decided to close. Your letters to Prime Minister Fraser helped to
bring this about. But it was barely in time for the whales that swim
past the Australian coast. Studies released last month show alarming
figures for a population of whales that Australian scientists had, as
recently as the last IWC meeting, been claiming was quite normal. It
is essential that this p0pulation, in the region the IWC designates as
"Area V" not be attacked by Russian and Japanese whaling fleets, now
that the Australians have given up. And it is essential that the popu-
lations of whales in the Western North Pacific not be decimated. The
big male sperm whales were so intensively hunted there ten years ago that
the pOpulations are expected to continue to go down even‘if no whales
are killed in certain parts of this huge expanse of ocean. Nevertheless
the zero quota which should have been voted at last June's IWC meeting
was not set, and the outlook for the Tokyo meeting is grim.

YOUR LETTERS ARE OF ENORMOUS IMPORTANCE AS WE APPROACH THIS FINAL
PHASE OF THE CAMPAIGN TO SAVE THE WHALES. After you have written and

sent your dollar to Japan and written to the Norwegian Prime Minister,
please let us know if yOu want to continue to be kept informed on the
progress of the fight for the whales. we must remove from our mailing
lists those who may no longer be interested. So please use the enclosed
envelope to confirm that you wish to remain on the list, to give any
change of address or expected change of address in the near future, and
to send a contribution toward mailing costs if you can. Your part in
this work for the whales has been essential. We hope to hear from you

and we'd like to know what responses you receive from your letters.

I wish to add my voice to the multitude of others who hope
that your government will put an end to commercial whaling.

Enclosed is a statement and questions by a group which is
striving to learn more about the mental capacities of cetaceans.

I would appreciate your consideration of these questions and hope
you will favor me with a response.

Respectfully yours,

 




A STATEMENT AND QUESTIONS ON SPERM WHALES
FROM FRIENDS OF CETACEANS ADDRESSED TO RESPONSIBLE LEADERS AND
OFFICIALS IN COUNTRIES WHICH STILL ENGAGE IN COMMERCIAL WHALING

Sperm.whales (cachalots) have the largest and most complex
brains in the world. Their brains are six times larger than hu-
man brains and present similar characteristics of high develop-
ment such as a huge, convoluted neocortex. Scientists throughout
the world recognize their potentialities. For example, Dr. Alfred
Berzin, Director of the Cetacean Research Laboratory, TINRO Insti-
tute, U.S.S.R. has called them "THINKING ANIMALS CAPABLE OF DIS-
PLAYING HIGH INTELLECTUAL ABILITIES."

Dr. Peter Morgans, Senior Scientist, Worcester Foundation for
Experimental Biology, U.S.A., has called them "POTENTIALLY INTELLI-
GENT AND HIGHLY DEVELOPED FELLOW BEINGS."

Families of sperm.whales, known as nursery schools, are long-
lasting social groups of young and adults, mostly female, who co-
operate to raise and teach their young until puberty, (about eight
years) and who are devoted to each other in time of danger.

Do you not agree that it is cruel to pursue these family groups
to exhaustion and to kill the largest members with explosive har-
poons?

Do you not agree with Professor Peter Singer of the University
of Melbourne, Australia that the survivors may grieve for the deaths
of their relatives?

Considering their high mental development and their tight family
bonds, is it not unethical for human beings to inflict extreme pain,
fear, and, finally, death upon them and to do so for mere commercial
profit?

The sperm whale has the lowest known reproductive rate of any
mammal. Several other Species of whales have already been nearly
destroyed by commercial whaling: the blue, the humpback, the right
and the bowhead whales.

Is it not imprudent to continue to allow the killing by an in-
dustry which is now dying itself, brought to thisemate by its own
greed?

Should not that industry have been stopped in the 1960's when
it reduced the blue whales, the largest creature ever to live on
earth, to a few thousand individuals whose biological survival is
now doubtful?

Should not the industry be stopped before the same fate befalls
the cachalots, the creatures who have the largest and most complex

 




brains on earth?

The products of the sperm whale can be readily substituted.
For example, the U.S. Defense Department rid itself of stockpiled
sperm oil three years ago preferring a synthetic product. Sperm
whale meat is not used for human consumption (it has a high mer-

cury and myoglobine content) but is processed into mink, chicken
and pig food.

As man seeks to learn more about the depths of the oceans,
should not the governments of all civilized nations renounce the

needless destruction of these creatures endowed with gigantic

brains and turn, instead, to observing them and their small cou-
sins the dolphins?

November 3, 1977

Dear Friends of Whales,

Thank you for your tremendous response to our last action let-
ter, which helped put such pressure on the International Whaling
Commission member governments that the Commissioners meeting in June
in Canberra, Australia decided larger quota reductions than at any
other meeting in its history.

After analyzing evidence of collapse in the sperm whale popu~
lations of the North Pacific, the Scientific Committee of the IWC
recommended that quotas be slashed by 90%, from 7,200 to 763. These

quotas were voted by the Commission by a 3/h majority - a great vic-
tory for whales.

But now these low quotas are in danger UNLESS WE CAN KEEP THE
PRESSURE UP. Russia and Japan, the world's two major whaling na-
tions, demanded and obtained a special meeting of the Scientific
Committee of the IWC November 21-26 in Cronulla, Australia to re-
calculate the North Pacific Sperm whale quotas. A special meeting
of the IWC will follow December 6—7 in Tokyo.

In the meantime, the government of Japan, responding to these
quota reductions, acted to reduce the Japanese whaling fleet to a
single factory ship and its attendant catcher boats. This has
brought strong protests from the Japan Joint Whaling Company head-
ed by Iwao Fujita, former Commissioner to the IWC from Japan, and
from the union of Whalers. The government is having considerable
difficulty in containing the industry.

It is important that all friends of whales write directly to
Prime Minister Fukuda in Japan urging him to continue to reduce
Japan's whaling, and 2) to end all importation of whale products
from nations that do not even belong to the—International Whaling
Commission or adhere to its regulations. Japan is Still purchas~
ingwbaleen whale meat from the "pirate" Whaler, the Sierra, that
flew the Somali flag, has a Norwegian captain, South ZTrican crew,
and Japanese meat merchants aboard. Its registry recently was

 




 

-2...

switched from Lichtenstein to Cyprus. Its ownership continues to
be a closely guarded secret.

In addition, a former Japanese fishing boat, now flying the
Panamanian flag, was recently remodelled in Tahiti as a catcher-
factory vessel for use by whalers in Chile. Chile has authorized
the killing of 1,500 sei and sperm whales in the next three years
but refuses to join the IWC! It is expected that Chile will ex—
port whale products to Japan.

Other non—IWC countries that export whale meat to Japan in—
clude Korea, Peru and Spain. These countries should be urged to
stop whaling or, at the very least, to join the INC and obey its
regulations.'_Unless they do so, they are eIiBeﬁafely rejectiﬁg
’the treaty, and any nation that buys whale products from them is
encouraging them in this scofflaw type of activity.

 

According to U.S. law, these nations are subject to embargo
of any or all of their fish products under the Pelly Amendment to
the Fishermen's Protective Act whose sanctions apply to countries
that "diminish the effectiveness of an international agreement for
the protection of marine resources." Secretary of Commerce, the
Honorable Juanita Kreps has the authority to prepare and submit the
necessary documents to the Treasury Department and President Carter
to invoke the embargos. Mrs. Kreps is a friend of whales, and you
may wish to write her at the Department of Commerce, Washington, D.C.
20230. Please thank her, too, for the firm stand her Department took
on the bowhead whale issue. ‘

As you may have read, an intense campaign was mounted by North
Slope Borough Eskimos and their Washington lawyers to force the
United States to file an objection to the unanimous vote of the Coma
missioners at the Canberra meeting which set a zero quota for the
coming year on bowhead whales. Under IWC rules, a country that

files an objection rejects its responsibility to abide by an IWC
quota.

On October 20th, the State Department announced that no objec-
tion would be filed by the United States. This was a vitally imn
portant victory, for had our country, the acknowledged world leader
in seeking to save the whales from extinction,itself filed an ob-
jection, it is a virtual certainty that Russia and Japan, under in-
dustry pressure, would have filed objections, too, and all whales
would, again, have been killed at the pleasure of the wEETers. The
massive quota reductions achieved at Canberra would have gone for

naught, and hopes for ultimate success in preventing extinction of
the whales would have been dashed.

Having won this second battle of the year for the whales, we
are now heading for a third in Tokyo in December. Again, a letter—

writing campaign is needed before the meeting and a media campaign
during the meeting.

AGAIN, THE WHALES NEED YOUR HELP




What you can do:

1) Write to the governments of as many whaling countries as
possible. To make it easier for you, we have enclosed a list of
heads of state and of the government department that authorizes
whale killing. Also enclosed is a brief letter which you can use
or modify or completely rewrite as you think best. Original let-
ters will have the most impact.

If you have access to a photocopy machine, you can prepare nu-
merous letters in a very short time by writing in "Dear mr. Presi-
dent" or "Dear Hr. Prime Minister" or "Dear Mr. Doe" as the case
may be, signing your name at the bottom, makin sure to follow it
with your full address. Foreign air mail postage for_ElI countries
is 31¢ per half ounce up to and including 2 ounces.

We were asked by Friends of Cetaceans to send you the state-
ment and questions about sperm whales for submission to officials
of government in whaling countries, and you are free to make copies
of it to enclose in your letters.

If you cannot write to all of these many addresses, do what
you can in the following order of priority: Japan, Australia, Russia,
Peru, Korea, Spain, Chile, Norway, Iceland, Brazil. The suggested
form letter is appropriate for all countries except Japan (see first
page of this letter).

2) Please send contributions to use for advertisements and
campaign materials for the Tokyo meeting. The Canberra meeting
helped make the Australian public aware that Australia is the last
Commonwealth country with a whale—killing company, Cheynes. The
indignation of the Australians has resulted in a flood of some
20,000 letters to the government which,as a result, may decline to
re-issue Cheynes' license to kill whales next year.

The Tokyo meeting provides a similar opportunity to reach the
Japanese people, many of whom have been misinformed by the industry.

Advertisements in Japanese newspapers cost thousands of dol-
lars each, so please send as much as you can afford.

The survival of the whales depends on you.

Sincerely,
(if:%::é;2z:;‘c1§i2ijigwea

December 1981

Dear Friend of Whales:

Thanks so much for your kind contribution. It will be needed in
the struggle we now have to face owing to the intransigence of
Japan, Norway and Iceland. You can help save the whales by
writing now to Secretary of State Alexander Haig, who is well
disposed towards whales. Thank him for his support in the past
and ask that he use the authority of the State Department to
reduce fish allocations to Japan in our ZOO-mile zone.

The enclosed leaflet reports on the objections to International
Whaling Commission decisions taken by Japan on the killing of
sperm whales and on the use of the cruel cold harpoon to kill
minke whales. Norway and Iceland, too, have filed objections to
the change in method of killing minke whales mandated by the IWC
for the next whaling season. Please ask Secretary Haig to support
prompt action under the Pelly Amendment to the Fisherman's Protec-
tion.Act to embargo fish products from all sf these nations unless
they withdraw their objections. Secretary Haig may be addressed
as follows:

The Honorable

Alexander M. Haig, Jr.
The Secretary of State
Department of State
Washington, D.C. 20520

You can help, too, by writing to the Foreign Ministers of the three
countries that have filed objections, urging that these objections
be withdrawn. In both.Norway and Japan there is a division within
the government itself. The Agriculture Minister for Norway has
written to the Fisheries Minister complaining about the agony
caused the whales by use of the cold harpoon. We suggest that you
write to the Agriculture Minister thanking him for his humane stand
and urging him to persuade the Norwegian government to withdraw

the objections The address is:

In Japan, Hyosuke Kujiroaka, the Minister of State for Environmental
Affairs,said at a cabinet meeting, "It's about time to stop whaling
from the standpoint of nature conservation." This was reported in
the Yomiuri Shimbun November 6, 1981. Mr. Kujiroaka recently took

a different government post, and the new Minister of State for
Environmental Affairs is Bunbei Hara. Please write to him urging
him to continue the sound position of his predecessor and to make
his voice heard within the government to withdraw the objections:

we realize that this is a large number of letters to write, and
you may not have time to write them all. Even one letter will
help. The more you can do, the better. Because foreign airmail
postage, especially to Japan, is expensive, you may wish to pur—
chase airletters at the post office. They can be sent anywhere
in the world and cost 30¢ each. ‘

Here are some facts you may wish to use in your letters: Whaling
nations have been on notice for four years that the cold harpoon
would have to go. It was banned for large whales at the 1979 IWC
meeting, and the necessity for development of a humane method has ,
been discussed at every meeting of the IWC since 1974 when Mr. Fujita,
the Japanese Commissioner, blocked discussion of the anti—cruelty
issue on a technicality: namely that it had not been placed on the
agenda of the meeting 60 days in advance. All whale-killing methods
developed to date are painful. They would not meet the standards of
any nation's humane slaughter laws. But the cold harpoon is the-
most agonizing of all, and it is used on the small minke whales

to prevent loss of meat. Because the whalers have reduced the
populations of larger whales to the vanishing point, it is the

small minkes who now must bear the brunt of the dying industry's
greed.. As Professor Derek Ovington, Australia's Commissioner to

the IWC. pointed out, the sum total of pain inflicted on whales

has actually increased in recent years because of the large number
of minke Whales being killed for the Japanese market.

Please let us know what response you receive to your letters.

Sincerely

ANIMAL WELFARE INSTITUTE P.0. Box 3650 Washington, no. 20007

Dear Friend of Whales,

Thanks for writing.~ If we all work together, protesting the

killing of whales, these large—brained creatures can be saved from
extinction.

The great dancer and director, Mikhail Baryshnikov, has just
made an appeal for an end to commercial whaling. We will soon be
sending out the tapes of Mr. Baryshnikov's televised public service
announcements, which were filmed by NBC on August 6. You can help
spread the word by phoning one or more of your local television
stations and asking them if they would like to run the tapes as a
public service. Let us know who at the staaon wants to have copies
sent, and we will dispatch them to the person you indicate in your
letter. The tapes are 10 seconds, 20 seconds and 30 seconds long,
very beautiful and moving as Baryshnikov's love for whales, and
indeed all animals, comes through strongly. A young whale and its
mother swim gracefully in the background as he speaks for them.

 

There are many other ways, too, in which you can help to bring
the necessary pressure on the whaling countries to persuade them
to stop. The three countries that kill the most whales are Japan,
the Soviet Union and Norway, in that order.

Here are some suggestions for action:

1) Phone a local automobile dealer who sells Japanese cars

and ask him to relay to the manufacturer in Japan your opposition
to the harpooning of whales.

2) Boycott products from Japan, Russia and Norway. Write or
phone manufacturers to tell them you are boycotting and why.

3) Fast—food chains use fish from whale killers. Much of the
fish sold in American fast-food restaurants comes from Japan, Iceland
and Norway. You can help put pressure on the whalers by writing to
the fast:§pod companies and urging them to stop buying fish from the
whaling countries.

4) Organize a rally or demonstration to tell merchants why you
are boycotting for the whales. Or set up a table at a gathering to
distribute leaflets, petitions, posters and bumper stickers. (We can
supply these together with organizing plans on request.)

5) Write to the foreign minister of Japan, telling him that
the continued whaling killing by Japan and the intransigence of his
government toward even meager whale conservation measures are giving
Japan a bad image around the world. In fact, Japan is single—handedly
keeping the whaling industry alive because it imports almost all of
the whale products. Virtually none of the whaling by the Soviet
Union, Norway, Iceland, Spain, Brazil, Peru or South Korea would
continue without the Japanese market. The Japanese government not
only subsidizes the Japanese whalers, but also the foreign whaling
operations through purchase of the whale meat at artificially high
prices. Most of the whale meat consumed in Japan is fed to convicts,
soldiers and schoolchildren, three groups who have no choice in what
they eat.

Tell the Japanese foreign minister that it is time to put this
bankrupt industry out of business before they put the whales out of
existence. Let him know that you will continue to protest the massacre
of the whales until Japan halts it. Write now, today. Please.

The foreign minister may bg_add£gssed as follows: H.E. Sunao Sonoda,

‘—

Foreiqn Minister, 2-2-1 Kasumigasekiy»Chiyoda~ku, Tokyo 100, JAPAN.

 

Next year every effort must be bent to bring a final end to
commercial whaling. To do so, three quarters of the votes must be

cast for a moratorium. The United States has been seeking such a
moratorium ever since 1971 when the 0.8. Congress passed resolutions
requesting the Secretary of State to seek a worldwide moratorium on
commercial whaling. But the whaling countries have always been able
to block the vote so far. That means we must redouble our efforts
between now and the next IWC meeting.

If you would like to be kept informed of developments and of
how you can help, a membership in the Animal Welfare Institute will
bring you The Animal Welfare Institute Quarterly and special letters

on whales. A membership application blank is enclosed for your
convenience.

 

The fight to save the whales isnecessarily expensive, but it can
be won. The campaign has succeeded in reducing the killing to a third
of what it was ten years ago. The coming year is crucial. I look

forward to hearing from you again and thank you for all you can do
to help the beleaguered whales.

Sincerely,

agar. $4 ,

UfR G E N T June 18, 1982
Dear Friend of Whales:

The ultimate fate of the whales may be decided July 19-23 by the
36 member nations of the International Whaling Commission meeting
in Brighton, England. Ybur actions Egg.can play a critical role
in preventing the extinction of these great mammals.

The enclosed Readers Digest article brings home their desperate
plight and the untenable position of the countries that still
persist in killing them. Recent scientific reexamination of the
data proves what friends of whales have been contending: éll_
whales 2; every species ought to be protected.

 

As scientific knowledge about whales and their populations slowly
builds, it becomes increasingly apparent that commercial whalers

have grossly overestimated the numbers g§_whales again and again.
Only when a disastrous crash in a particular population has
occurred-—as, for example, with the sperm whales in Australian

waters just before Australia banned whaling in 1979-4has any whaling
nation acknowledged that the calculations were erroneous and previous
estimates hugely inflated.

In the North Pacific, sperm whales have been exploited so severely
by Japan and Russia that their numbers are expected to continue

to decrease for many years even if no more whales are killed.
Nevertheless, the Japanese Whaling Association is fighting ruth-
lessly to get the International Whaling Commission to give Japan

a quota despite the perilous state of these whales. It is vitally
important to write to the heads of states or other high officials
of nations represented on the International Whaling Commission
urging them 32 instruct their Commissioners Eg_vote £95 a cessation
'9; all commercial whaling.

Significantly, it is Australia, recently changed from a whaling
nation to a leader of anti-whaling forces, that has placed a
cessation resolution on the IWC agenda, supported by the United
Kingdom and France. The Australian government's extensive "Inquiry
into Whales and Whaling" conducted by a high court judge was con-
clusive in showing that all commercial whaling should cease.

 




 

-2-

Unfortunately, none of the countries that continue to kill whales
has been willing to mount such an inquiry or to follow its advice.

Public pressure ig essential to bring a cessation of commercial
whaling.

YOU CAN HELP BY WRITING LETTERS—~AS MANY AS YOU CAN. A brief

summary to assist you in writing is given for each country or

group of countries. Please choose the ones you feel most moved

.32 write pg. Praise for those who have worked to halt the whalers

is as important as letters of complaint to whaling nations, for it

is a hard fight and pressures from Japan are severe on many countries.

For example, the government of the Seychelles had to issue a press
release June 2, 1982 to correct reports in the Japanese press that
it had made an about—face and would "attempt to influence other
countries to vote against a moratorium." The Seychelles release
asserted: ". . . the Government . . . will continue to support

and campaign vigorously in favor of the protection of all endangered
species."

President Rene'has already demonstrated his courage in the face of
Japanese pressure. As stated in AWI's New York Times ad June 8, 1982:

In 1980, after the island nation of the Seychelles
won [WC approval of a whale sanctuary in the Indian
Ocean, the Japanese government threatened to cancel
a ﬁsheries development aid program. When Seychelles
President Albert René resisted the Japanese pressure to
stop saving the whales, Japan reneged on the agreement.
lhe Seychelles government retaliated by seizing and con-
ﬁscating a large Japanese tuna ship ﬁshing illegally within
the Seychelles' 200-mile zone. Taken aback by such
bravery, Japan backed down for awhile, but is now re-
newing its aim-twisting. To its credit, the Seychelles
continues to resist the pressure.

You can write to express your support of President Rene"s stand
and urge him to continue his ndble fight for the whales:

President France Albert René
The Seychelles
Victoria, Mahe, The Seychelles

Other third world countries that deserve praise and encouragement
for their efforts at the IWC to protect the whales and bring an
end to commercial whaling are Jamaica, gt. Lucia, Uruguay, Costa

 

Rica, St. Vincent, Oman, Dominica, Kenya and India. These coun—

The United States government is committed to vote for a moratorium
on commercial whaling, and President Reagan last year wrote an
excellent letter 52 the International Whaling Commission. Please
ask him to write again this year urging the Commission to adopt a
cessation of commercial whaling. A strong, determined stand by
the united States at the meeting is vitally important to success.

Please write to: The President

Thg_Nether1ands, formerly a ruthless whaling nation, became con-
servation minded but, at the special meeting of the IWC in March,
showed signs of dangerous weakening. An unfounded fear that Japan
would quit the IWC if commercial whaling is stopped has been
expressed.by Dutch officials. Although the Japanese Commissioner
has often threatened that this would happen, other Japanese officials
have stated that it would not. And, most importantly, the U. S.
Commissioner to the IWC testified at a Congressional hearing as
recently as June 9, 1982 that this country would invoke U. S. law
against nations defying IWC regulations. Two U. S. laws, the Pelly
and Packwood/Magnuson Amendments, call for economic sanctions by

the U. S. against the fish products and ZOO-mile fishing privileges
of offending nations. Please urge Prime Minister Van Agt to instruct
the Dutch Cammissioner to vote for a cessation of commercial whaling
and to support at all times the strongest conservation proposals put
forward at the meeting.

Japan, Russia, and Norway are the three biggest whale killers in

the world, in that order. It is very doubtful that letters can be
effective in influencing Russian policy; nevertheless, the names

and addresses of all three Foreign Ministers are given. Letters

to them should express outrage at their continued use of the barbaric
cold harpoon in contravention of the consensus vote at the last
meeting of the IWC against the cruelest method of whale killing.

The Chairman of the IWC is Hon. Eduardo Iglesias of Argentina.

He is a true conservationist and also a lawyer who scrutinizes

each proposal with legal caution. The complex political situation
arising from the battle of the Falkland Islands. called The Malvinas
by Argentines, makes letters particularly delicate at this time.
Because the head of state. President Galtieri, is unlikely to have
time even to realize that letters are reaching him on the subject

of whales, we suggest that you write instead to the IWC Commissioner.
Respectfully request him to take a firm position in support of the
strongest conservationist proposals put forward at the IWC meeting.

France has long been a leading fighter for the whales. New Zealand
and Sweden rejoined the IWC for the very purpose of protecting
whales and have been effective campaigners; the united Kingdom and
Switzerland are strong supporters of an end to commercial whaling;
West Germany is expected to join the IWC as a conservationist
country. The heads of state of each of these countries should
receive letters of support and encouragement before the July meet-

 ,Whales Live!

BY ANDREW JONES

Dying sperm whale thrashes in front of a Russian harpoon boat

There is no longer any economic reason to con-
tinue the bloody slaughter of these magniﬁcent
creatures. The time has come to declare a total
moratorium on whaling—before it is too late

N A SUMMER DAY in 1975 an
O 80—foot Canadian ﬁshing

boat manned by a crew
from Greenpeace, a Vancouver-
based environmentalist group,
came upon nine Russian harpoon
boats 150 miles off the California
coast. Harpooned whales lay dead
in the water, each rigged with a
radio transmitter and radar reﬂec—
tor so it could be picked up later by
a factory ship. Among the corpses
was one of a baby sperm whale,
well below legal kill size.

The Greenpeace sailors took to
outboard-driven rubber rafts and
positioned themselves between the
ﬂeeing whales and the harpoon
guns so as to block shots at the
quarry. It was a risky business—one
Soviet gunner ﬁred anyway, barely
missing the raftsmen—but it saved
the lives of at least eight whales.

Greenpeace’s dramatic action,
on this and other occasions, under—
scored a mounting worldwide con-
cern over the plight of this planet’s
largest animal. That concern has

LET THE GREAT WHALES LIVE!

now focused on a meeting this July
in Brighton, England, of the Inter—
national Whaling Commission
(IWC), whose member nations will
weigh the fate of the world’s whale
populations.

In the minds of most delegates,
these huge, gentle mammals have
been hunted and slaughtered by
man in too great numbers for far
too long. Since the turn of the
century, some three million whales
have been reduced to steaks, pet
food, corset stays, lubricating oil—
by rough count, a hundred com—
modities and special uses that are
now obsolete or can be replaced and
in some cases improved upon.

As at previous IWC meetings, the
United States will join other non—
whaling countries in urging that
the slaughter be stopped. “There is
no reason to continue commercial
whaling at any level,” said Rep.
Don Bonker (D., Wash.) in support
of his 1981 Congressional Resolu—
tion for a total commercial—whaling
moratorium. “Time is running out
for the whales.”

The United States ﬁrst called on
the IWC to stop all commercial
whaling in 1972. Last year, with
sentiment against the killing of
whales mounting like a spring tide,
the vote at Brighton was closer than
ever before: 16 yeas, 8 nays and 3
abstentions. Since a three-quarter
majority was needed, however, the
motion failed and the whaling
countries———organized and support—
ed by Japan—had a green light to

go on killing for another year.

Modern whaling dates from
1868 when a Norwegian, Svend
Foyn, invented a harpoon with an
explosive tip that was ﬁred from a
cannon. Next came steam—power
and “factory” ships, some as large
as aircraft carriers, that could haul
the catch on board and process it at
sea. During the 19305 whaling
soared. In 1931 alone, nearly 30,000
blue whales were harvested in the
Southern Hemisphere. This and
subsequent slaughters dealt that
population a blow from which it
has yet to recover, even under the
total protection it enjoys today.
In 1962, the peak commercial—
whaling year, ships of all nations
took more than 66,000 whales.

By this time, however, the dan—
gers to whale stocks had been rec—
ognized and the ﬁrst tentative steps
toward restricted hunting had been
taken. In 1946, delegations from 14
countries had met in Washington,
D.C., to form the IWC, put the most
seriously depleted species under
protection and set annual kill quo-
tas for whales in the Southern
Hemisphere. Legal whaling sea—
sons were established and motions
were passed forbidding the killing
of females with calves, or young
under certain lengths. Over subse-
quent years the commission gained
protection for six of the ten species
of great whales and placed limita—
tions on the use of factory ships. Most
important, its Scientific Committee
learned a great deal about whales.

But as an agency without en—
forcement powers, the IWC can do




LET THE GREAT WHALES LIVE!

nothing when member nations ex—
ceed kill quotas, hunt in proscribed
waters or otherwise operate outside
regulations. It has had to stand by
helplessly while “pirate” Whalers
slaughtered protected species, preg—
nant females and young—and sold
the meat to Japanese whale import—
ers. While whale populations were
declining in the world’s oceans, the
IWC too often has ignored the rec—
ommendations of its own scientists
and has rubber—stamped the swol—
len quotas demanded by whaling
interests.

Today the IWC presides over a
moribund industry. Whaling ships
must go farther and search longer
to ﬁll their holds, while burning
increasingly expensive fuel. More—
over, of all the original uses for
whale parts—bone, ﬂesh, cartilage,
011 and entrails—there remains
only a modest demand for whale
meat, preeminently in Japan where
1t 18 served in seafood restaurants
and is a staple in government food
Programs. Japanese whaling com—
panies, under protection of govern—
ment—supported price regulations,
market not only their own catch
but most of the whale meat harvest-
ed by Russia, Norway, Spain, K0—
rea and other nations.

At IWC conventions, Japanese del—
egates continue to ﬁght hard for the
fight to harvest what they consider a
renewable food resource. They sub—
mit scientific data that they claim
prove that species taken by Japan
are not in any danger of extinction.

hey insist that whale meat is a

necessary source of protein in the
national diet (actually, it makes up
less than one percent of Japan’s
annual protein consumption).
Why does the Japanese govern—
ment continue to ﬁght over a small
and disappearing resource? The
answer, in a word, is politics. Ja—
pan’s coastal prefectures have dis—
proportionate voting weight in the
Diet, and their representatives press
hard in behalf of whaling constitu—
ents. Labor unions, too, exert enor—
mous pressure. But the strongest
voice in the political chorus is that of
the whaling companies, who must
pay huge severance bonuses to laid—
off seamen; in the last cutback,
these averaged $30,000 per man.
Meanwhile, interest in whales
grows ever stronger. “Songs of the
Humpback Whale”~——a recording
of bull humpbacks making their
extraordinary music in the depths
of the 0cean—-——has sold more than
100,000 copies. Whale enthusiasts
crowd aboard ships on both US.
seacoasts to go offshore in the hope
ofseeing a spout or two. Says zoolo—
gist James Mead ofthe Smithsonian
Institution, “There’s a feeling that
whales are special animals. They’ve
become a symbol for the entire
environmental movement.”
Possibly the most popular species
is the gray whale, which migrates
annually along the west coast of
North America to its breeding
grounds off Mexico. Grays swim
8000 miles a year, the longest mi—
gration of any mammal on the
earth, and are observed by thou—

 




LET THE GREAT WHALES LIVE!

sands of whale watchers from Alas—
ka to San Diego. Although they
once plied the waters of the Paciﬁc
and the Atlantic by the tens of
thousands, they were all but wiped
out in the 19305. Killing grays was
prohibited at the ﬁrst IWC meeting
in 1946, and they have now come
back; their present number is esti—
mated to be about 15,000.

Besides the gray, there are ﬁve
other species of great whales on the
IWC protected list—blue, hump-
back, right, bowhead and sperm.
Hunting for the remaining four
species—ﬁn, sei, Bryde’s and
minke—is controlled by quotas
recommended each year by the Sci—
entiﬁc Committee at the Brighton
meeting. These quotas are derived
largely from data supplied by the
Whalers themselves based on num—
bers of whales sighted and killed
the previous year.

But as public interest in whales
has grown, so has the demand for
more and better information. How,
people ask, can we trust the ﬁgures
we get from Whalers? How do we
guard against cheating?

Scientists measure the catch
against how many boats were in-
volved over how many days. Then,
from that ﬁgure they estimate how
many whales were inhabiting the
area at the time. “It’s not a very
dependable method,” says Sidney

Holt, an IWC deputy commissioner
and scientiﬁc adviser. “But we have
to do the best we can in the absence
of more reliable methods.”

In Holt the whales have long had
a staunch champion. “Their brains
are the largest and most complex of
any of the earth’s inhabitants,” he
says. “They’re sociable and sensi—
tive. They have long memories and
strong tendencies to parental care
and mutual support within the pod.
I believe that they are likely, over a
period ten times longer than hu-
man history, to have developed a
mental culture, and that we are
almost certainly destroying it.”

IWC politics and haggling can be
extended almost-indeﬁnitely, while
the whaling ﬂeets are ﬁnancially
propped up on and on into a bloody
future until, suddenly, there may be
no more whales to study. The ques—
tion for today is: How long must
the killing continue? .

At Brighton in July, the question
should have an answer: No longer.
Let the killing stop. Iflapan is short
on protein, it can import beef from
South America or mutton from
Australia with the money it now
spends supporting the whaling in-
dustry. It is time to turn off the
rhetoric. The job of the IWC should
be to put itself out of business.

Dear Friend of Whales:

Good news! The Agriculture and Fisheries Commission of the
Spanish Parliament has voted to end Spanish whaling and to instruct
the Spanish Delegation on the International Whaling Commission to
vote for a moratorium on all commercial whaling. We are informed,
however, that the Spanish whaling company, which sends catcher
boats out from two shore stations in Spain, is trying to reverse
the Commission's decision.

The support of King Juan Carlos for the Commission's decision
is very important.We hope that you will wish to write a respectful
letter to His Majesty expressing your great pleasure at learning
of the action by the Spanish Parliamentary Commission and requesting
him to lend his support to the decision to vote for the moratorium
at the International Whaling Commission meeting and to end whaling
by Spain. In writing to King Juan Carlos, address him as Your
Majesty. The envelope should be addressed:

The news from Norway is not so good. Norway filed an objection
to the concensus decision by the International Whaling Commission to
end the use of the cruel cold harpoon on minke whales in the 1982-83
season which begins in late fall of this year. The long-drawn-out
agony inflicted by the cold harpoon would be completely illegal if
inflicted on a domestic animal in a Norwegian slaughterhouse. Please
write to the Prime Minister of Norway urging him to withdraw the
objection and to end this unnecessary cruelty promptly:

Iceland's objection to the cold harpoon ban. Urge him to with-
draw the objection and end the misery inflicted by this devastat—
ing instrument. Voice displeasure at the continued slaughter of
hundreds of minke, fin, sei and sperm whales. Almost all Iceland's

Whaling Commission decisions taken by Japan on the killing of
sperm whales and on the use of the cruel cold harpoon to kill
minke whales.- The Soviet Union, Norway and Iceland, too, have
filed objections to the change in method of killing minke whales
mandated by the IWC for the next whaling season. Please ask Sec-
retary Haig to support prompt action under the Pelly Amendment to

of these nations unless they withdraw their objections. Secretary
Haig may be addressed as follows:

Here are some facts you may wish to use in your letters: Whaling
natiOns have been on notice for four years that the cold harpoon
would have to-go. It was banned for large whales at the 1979 IWC
meeting, and the necessity for development of a humane method has
been discussed at every meeting of the IWC since 1974 when Mr. Fujita,
the Japanese Commissioner, blocked discussion of the anti-cruelty
issue on a technicality: namely that it had not been placed on the
agenda of the meeting 60 days in advance. All whale—killing methods
developed to date are painful. They would not meet the standards of
any nation's humane slaughter laws. But the cold harpoon is the
most agonizing of all, and it is used on the small minke whales

to prevent loss of meat. Because the Whalers have reduced the
populations of larger whales to the vanishing point, it is the

small minkes who now must bear the brunt of the dying industry's
greed. As Professor Derek Ovington, Australia's Commissioner to

the IWC, pointed out, the sum total of pain inflicted on whales

has actually increased in recent years because of the large number
of minke whales being killed for the Japanese market.

Good news! The Agriculture and Fisheries Commission of the Spanish
Parliament‘has voted to end SpaniSh whaling and to instruct the
Spanish Delegation on the International Whaling Commission to vote
for a moratorium on all commercial whaling. We are informed, how—
ever, that the Spanish whaling company, which sends catcher boats
out from two shore stations in Spain, is trying to reverse the
Commission's decision.

The support of King Juan Carlos for the Commission's decision is
very important. We hope that you will wish to write a respectful
letter to His Majesty expressing your great pleasure at learning

of the action by the Spanish Parliamentary Commission and requesting

We realize that this is a large number of letters to write, and
you may not have time to write them all. Even one letter will
help. The more you can do, the better. Because foreign airmail
postage, especially to Japan, is expensive, you may wish to pur-
chase Airletters at the Post Office. They can be sent anywhere

ANIMAL WELFARE INSTITUTE P.O. Box 3650 Washington, DC. 20007

July 26, 1982

Dear Friend of Whales,

The whaling ban is passed at last! 'On July 23rd the
International Whaling Commission meeting in Brighton, England
voted 25 to 7 to end commercial whaling. The whaling countries
are still being given quOtas for the next three years so they
can phase out their business. Then in 1990, the Commission has
agreed "to undertake a comprehensive assessment of the effects
of this decision." These concessions, which were necessary to
obtain the 3/4 majority vote required by IWC rules, do not alter
the fact that by 1986 all commercial whaling is prohibited by

the IWC.

Letters written by friends of whales played a valuable part
in the success of this long campaign, and we thank you. The
resolutions calling for a moratorium on commercial whaling which
were passed by the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives in
1971 and by the Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment in
1972 have finally materialized into international action. One
whaling country, Spain, voted in favor of the cessation and has
begun to phase out its whaling.

The seven whaling countries who voted "No" were Brazil, Iceland,
Japan, Korea, Norway, Peru and the Soviet Union.

Countries voting ”Yes" were Antigua. Argentina, Australia,
Belize, Costa Rica, Denmark, Egypt, France, West Germany, India,
Kenya, Mexico, Monaco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Oman, St. Lucia,
St. Vincent, Senegal, Seychelles, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom,
United States, and Uruguay.

Japan led the fight against the cessation, attempting even at
the last moment to head off the vote. Just before it was taken,
more than 20 members of the Japanese delegation walked out of the
conference room, showing the reaction of the whaling industry.
Japanese Commissioner Yonezawa and ten others of the delegation
remained and continued tough negotiations on quotas.

Under the terms of the treaty, member nations can file
objections and disregard even 3/4 majority decisions. They
have 90 days in which to file. In an attempt to head off
objections, the conservation countries reluctantly agreed to a
number of quotas on the day after the vote to end whaling in
1986. It remains to be seen whether the whaling countries will
abide by IWC decisions. If they do not, trade sanctions can
be inkaed under 0.8. law. The Packwoodeagnuson amendment
cuts off 50% of the fish which a nation may catch within the
U.S. 200~mi1e zone. If the nation persists in defying IWC
decisions, the cut-off moves to 100%.

Next year, quotas should be greatly reduced as the whaling
nations move towards the end of the whaling business. To en-
sure that this happens, the strong support of all the nations
she voted "Yes“ on the cessation will be needed. It would be
very helpful if you would write to as many of these nations as
possible. thanking them warmly and urging them to continue
their efforts to protect whales at next year's IWC meeting.
Names and addresses are listed on the enclosed sheet.

“Most important of all at this time is to write to the
Foreign Ministers of Whaling countries urging them to abide by

the IWC decision to phase out commercial whaling by 1986.
Letters to these Foreign Ministers should be polite and
encouraging. Please let them know that you lodk to them for
statesmanship in bringing about this change.

Until commercial whaling has come to a complete st0p, we~
will keep watching and alerting all friends of whales of
opportunities to help to head off back-sliding by the whaling
nations. Your contribution entitles you to membership in the

We realize that this is a large number of letters to write, and~

you may not have time to write them all. Even one letter will

help. The more you can do, the better. Because foreign airmail
postage, especially to Japan, is expensive, you may wish to purchase
Airletters at the Post Office. They can be sent anywhere in the
world and cost 30¢ each.

Here are some facts you may wish to use in your letters: .Whaling
nations have been on notice for four years that the cold harpoon
would have to go. It was banned for large whales at the 1979 IWC
meeting, and the necessity for development of a humane method has
been discussed at every meeting of the IWC since 1974 when Mr. Fujita,
the Japanese Commissioner, blocked discussion of the anti-cruelty
issue on a technicality: namely that it had not been placed on the
agenda of the meeting 60 days in advance. All whaleékilling methods
developed to date are painful. They would not meet the standards of
any nation's humane slaughter laws. But the cold harpoon is the‘
most agonizing of all, and it is used on the small minke whales

to prevent loss of meat. Because the whalers have reduced the
populations of larger whales to the vanishing point, it is the

small minkes who now must bear the brunt of the dying industry's
greed. As Professor Derek Ovington, Australia's Commissioner to

the IWC, pointed out, the sum total of pain inflicted on whales

has actually increased in recent years because of the large number
of minke whales being killed for the Japanese market.

Please let us know what response you receive to your letters.
Again, thanks for your support and help!

Dear Friend of Whales,

Thanks for writing. If we all work together, protesting the
killing of whales, these large-brained creatures can be saved from
extinction. ‘

The great dancer and director, Mikhail Baryshnikov, has just
made an appeal for an end to commercial whaling. We will soon be
sending out the tapes of Mr. Baryshnikov's televised public service
announcements, which were filmed by NBC on August 6. Ypu can help

spread the word by phoning one or more of your local television

stations and asking them igithey would like to run the tapes as a
public service. Let us know who at the station wants to have copies

sent, and we will dispatch them to the person you indicate in your
letter. The tapes are 10 seconds. 20 seconds, and 30 seconds long,
very beautiful and moving as Baryshnikov‘s love for whales, and
indeed all animals, comes through strongly. A young whale and 'its
mother swim gracefully in the background as he speaks for them.

 

 

There are many other ways, too, in which you can help to bring
the necessary pressure on the whaling countries to persuade them-
to stop. The three countries that kill the most whales are Japan,
the Soviet Union, and Norway, in that order. .

Here are some suggestions for action:

1) Phone a local automobile dealer who sells Japanese cars,
and ask him to relay to the manufacturer in Japan yomropposition

to the harpooning of whales. You may wish to use information in
the enclosed leaflet to make your points.

2) Boycott ppoducts from Japani Russia and Norway. Write
or phone manufacturers to tell them you are boycotting and why.

3) FaSt-food chains use fish from whale killers. Much of
the fish sold in American fast-food restaurants comes from Japan,
Iceland and Norway. You can help put pressure on the whalers py,
writing to the fast-food companies and urging them to stop buying
fish from the whaling countries.-

McDonald’s ~— The fish sandwiches served at McDonald's ape
made from fish purchased from Nitto Hogei Company,.a large Japanese
fishing company that operate§_several whaling ships along thngap-
anese coast that hunt down hundreds of whales annually. Nitto
Hogei is also part owner of the Japan Joint Whaling Company, which
sends a fleet to the Antarctic each year to harpoon thousands of
minke whales. Please write to the pregident of McDonald’s and
request that his company, the largest restaurant chain in the
world, stop buying Japanese fish ~- especially from Nitto Hogei ~-
or fish from any other whaling nation. ,

Arthur Treacher's, Long John Silver's and H. Salt-~
These three fish—and-chips chains buy huge amounts of fish from

Iceland, Norway and Japan. Ask the presidents of these companies
.to help send a message to the whaling nations by refusing to buy
their fish until all whale-killing is stopped.

4) Organize a.rglly or demgnstrgtign to tell merchants why you
are boycotting for the whales. Or set up a table at a gathering to
distribute leaflets, petitions, posters and bumper stickers. (We can
supply these together with organizing plans on request.)

5) Wr'te to the he ds of state of whgling countries in care
of their embassies uggigg an end to whaling.

‘ You can help, too, by encouraging nations who are working to
save the whales. At the week~long meeting 9; the International
Whaling Commission just cOncluded in BrightOn, England on July 26,
six new member countries voted to protect whales, .Lgtt§;§_gj

co

appreciation to their heads of state would be an en graggmggt :9
their continuing efforts. Conservation-minded countries who have

just joined the IWC include India, Costa Rica, Jamaica, St. Lucia,
St. Vincent, and Uruguay. They helped bring about the two major
forward steps that were taken at the recent meeting: the protection
of sperm whales in nearly all of the oceans of the world and a ban
to begin in the 198253 season on use of the cruellest of all of the
harpoons, the barbaric "cold" harpoon, against which thousands of
minke whales haVe to struggle in their death agonies just so the
whalers will have more of their meat to Sell than if they killed
them with explosives. Following are addresses you can use for
letters of thanks and encouragement.

.~ effo t m st be bent to brin a final end to‘
commercial whaling. To do so, three quarters of the votes must be
cast for a moratorium. The United States has been seeking such a.
moratorium every since 1971 when the U.S. Congress passed resolutions
requesting the Secretary of State to seek a worldwide moratorium on
commercial whaling. But the whaling countries have always been able
to block the vote so far. That means we must redouble our efforts
between now and the next IWC meeting.

If you would like to be kept informed of developments and of.
how you can help, a membership in the Animal Welfare Institute will
bring you our quarterly Information Reports and special letters on

whales. A membership application blank is enclosed for your convenience.

The fight to save the whales is necessarily expensive, but it can
be won. The campaign has succeeded in reducing the killing to a third
of what it was ten years ago. The ggging year is crucial. I lock
forward to hearing from you again and thank you for all you can do
to help the beleaguered whales. x

June 18 , 1981

Dear.Friend of Whales,

The meeting of the International Whaling Commission coming
up July 20-26 in Brighton, England offers the best chance to end
commercial whaling that we have ever had. We must seize the op-
pertunity for action.

The two new members of the Commission, India and China,
and Costa Rica, which may join before the meeting, are expected
to help the whales. Many countries have placed proposals for
whale protection on the IWC agenda. The most important ones
are underlined below.

The United States and the United Kingdom have proposed

an indefinite moratorium on commercial whaling. A fall-back pro—
posal, if the broad moratorium fails to pass, is an indefinite

ban on commercial whaling in the North Atlantic. A second fall-
'back United States/Australian proposal would totally prohibit the
use of the "cold" harpoon. This barbaric implement, which causes

a slow, anguished death, was banned for large whales at last year's
.meeting, but it.continues to be used in killing thousands of the small
minke whales. If commercial whaling is not ended this year, it is
eSsential at the very least to eliminate immediately the tor-
ture of these friendly, inquisitive whales who represent the

last in the ruthless chain of destruction which began with the
right whales, the blue whales and the humpback whales (all now
"commercially extinct") and continued with the fin whales, sei
whales, and Brydes' whales, that are now close to the same state,
leaving only the smallest of the baleen whales, the minke, l/lOth
the size of the blue whale, to bear the brunt of the industry.

 

France has proposed a phase—out of pelagic minke whalinq over
a three—year period and has joined the Netherlands, the Seychelles
and the U.K. in proposing a moratorium ontﬂma killing of sperm

 




 

-2-

whales. This is the proposal that would have passed last year if
Canada had not voted with the whaling nations to kill the sperm
whale moratorium.

Sweden will propose protection for all fin and sei whales.
This corresponds with action taken at the New Delhi meeting of
the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES)
this March. The fin, sei and sperm whales were listed on Appendix I
of the Convention, thus banning international commercial trade in
their parts and products. The overwhelming vote of 37-2 isolated
Japan and the Soviet Union, the only nations to vote against it.

(Japan has announced it will not abide by the CITES trade restric—
tions.)

At the coming IWC meeting, it is essential to prevent these
relentless whale—killers from gathering the support they seek
from countries susceptible to political or economic pressure.

Please write to President Ronald Reagan, requesting him per-
sonally to instruct the U.S. delegation to take leadership on all
whale protection proposals.

The President
The White House
Washington, D.C. 20500

THEN WRITE TO AS MANY OTHER HEADS OF STATE AS YOU CAN URGING
THEM TO SUPPORT THE INDEFINITE MORATORIUM ON ALL COMMERCIAL WHAL-
ING, AND IF IT SHOULD FAIL, TO SUPPORT ALL OTHER MORATORIUM AND
HUMANE PROPOSALS AT THE JULY MEETING. Your letters are important,
for they exemplify world public opinion, bringing it tangibly to
each government. Airletters for mailing to foreign countries save
postage. They may be purchased at the Post Office. Background on
key IWC member countries follows together with the names and ad-
dresses of their heads of state. ’

ICELAND is important in this struggle. Chairman of the IWC
is Thordur Asqeirsson. If he is instructed by his government to
vote for a moratorium, it would be virtually impossible for Japan
and Russia to prevent its adoption. However, the owners of the
Icelandic whaling station sell almost all of their whale meat to
Japan, and they have powerful influence in their country. If they
continue to exert this selfish influence to the detriment of whale§_
worldwide, it may be necessary to extend the boycott, already 23_
Japanese, Russian and Norwegian goods, to Icelandic products.

Much of the fast food chain fish sold in the United States is
imported from Iceland.

'Please write Prime Minister Thoroddsen urging him to instruct
Mr. Asgeirsson to vote for a moratorium on commercial whaling.
You may wish to tell him you will decide after learning of Ice-

land's actions at the IWC this July whether to begin boycotting
Icelandic products.

SPAIN. There is no international observer at the Spanish
whaling station, and it has repeatedly been charged with killing
many more whales than the IWC quota. Most of the whale meat is
sold to Japan. All nations should be urged to demand internation-
al observers on all whaling ships and shore stations.

Spain twice fikuiobjections to IWC regulations in the less
than two years it has been a member! Then, fear that the United
States would invoke the Pelly and Packwood-Magnuson amendments
against the Spanish fishing industry caused Spain to withdraw
these objections. These two invaluable U.S. laws provide major
penalties in the form of embargo of fish products or removal of
fishing rights within the U.S. ZOO-mile limit for a natiOn that
"diminishes the effectiveness of an international agreement" for
the conservation of marine resources.

 

Please write the King of Spain urging him to end the whaling
which is giving Spain a bad name internationally, bringing an
insignificant economic return, and jeopardizing the large Spanish
fishing industry. Urge him to reverse the Spanish Commissioner's
1980 voting record and, instead, support the moratorium and humane
proposals.

SOUTH AFRICA gave up whaling several years ago and, at the
CITES meeting in New Delhi, voted to place the sperm, fin and sei
whales on Appendix I (endangered). Please thank Prime Minister
Botha for this vote, and ask him to instruct the South African

Commissioner to vote consistently with this position at the IWC
meeting.

PERU's new President Belaunde Terry has a good reputation
for concern for animals. Please ask him to speed Peru's promised

phase-out of whaling and to instruct the Peruvian Commissioner to
vote for the moratorium and humane proposals.

NORWAY'S new Prime Minister Brundtland, a woman well-disposed
toward whales, was former Minister of the Environment. Please ask
her to put Norway in a leadership position as a protector rather
than destroyer of these magnificent animals. The first Norwegian
Whale Day was June 15th. Let Prime Minister Brundtland know that j
you have heard of the demands of Norwegian fishermen to continue
killing nearly 2,000 minke whales a year, but tell her you cannot
conceive of a country with such advanced animal protection laws
continuing to kill these sensitive, intelligent whales, particu-
larly with the barbaric "cold" harpoon. Urge her to use the
power of her office to end this terrible cruelty, preferably by
stopping all whale killing, but if the total moratorium does not
pass, request that-she instruct the Norwegian Commissioner to vote
for all the other moratoria, including the phase out of minke
whaling, and for banning the cold harpoon for all whales regard—
.less of their species.

DENMARK. Last year, for the first time, Denmark voted for
the moratorium on all commercial whaling. Please thank Prime
Minister Jorgensen for this enlightened vote. Urge him to instruct
the Danish Commissioner to vote for this broad moratorium again,

and, in the eventit does not pass, for each of the other morator-
ium and humane proposals.

Prime Minister Anker Jorgensen

JAPAN, the leader of the whale killers, has received so many
petitions and letters begging them to stop the carnage that it
might seem hopeless to write again. But if you have already writ-
ten the countries we've listed above, then do write a thoughtful

letter to Prime Minister Suzuki, who was elected last year. He ‘l
comes from a fishing family. Point out that the world's foremost _
fishing nation, Japan. has tarnished its image all around the world ’3

 

because of the policy it has adopted on whales. Third world na-
tions (off whose shores the giant Japanese fishing industry wishes
to operate) are committed to the protection of whales as demonstra-
ted by their votes at the CITES meeting in India in March. (See
page 2.) Remind the Prime Minister pOlitely but firmly of the

37-2 vote to prohibit international trade in any product of fin,

sei, and sperm whales. Urge him to bring Japan into line with
the rest of the free world.

BRAZIL'S President Figueiredo reversed the government edict
which would have ended whaling by Brazil January 1,1981. Japan-
ese pressure reportedly caused this sorry retraction which post-
poned the elimination of whaling till 1984 or perhaps indefinitely.
Brazilian friends of whales are pressing hard for an end to the
slaughter. Join them in writing President Figueiredo urging him
to instruct the Brazilian Commissioner to support moratorium and
humane proposals. Even if Brazil is determined to kill minke
whales for three more years, it can and should vote for l) France's
proposal to end minke whaling in three years 2) the U.K.'s proposal
to ban commercial whaling in the North Atlantic 3) a ban on killing
sperm whales and 4) a ban on “cold" harpoons.

SOUTH KOREA and CHILE kill whales primarily for the Japanese
market and they usually vote pro-whaler at the IWC. Their govern—
ments have shown minimal interest in public opinion. However, they,

proposals noted above under Brazil. Please ask them to do so.

tissue the Whales

Washington ‘
Cap’n Ahab is leading an adver-
tising campaign to save the whales.

Actor Gregory Peck, who por¥
trayed the fictitious Ahab in the
filmversion of the classic “Moby
Dick,” is being featured in televi:
sion advertisements sponsored by

‘ the Animal.-.lilsli§!sinstitute and
aimed at the whaling practices of
Japan. ' ~ '

A spokesman said Japan was .

singled out because it is one of the
last countries to provide a market
for whaleproducts and is also the
major killer of whales.

The ads, which also feature
television actor Jack Lord, will be
aired in the United States and
Canada-and have-been distributed

in Japan.

“A hundred years ago during
whaling’s romantic heyday, a three-
year expedition netted an average
of 37 whales. Today a modern
Japanese or Russian whaling fleet
can eliminate 37 whales in a day
with , brutal military precision,"
Peck says in the ad. “There are
cheap, plentiful substitutes for all
whale products. Unfortunately,
there are no substitutes for
whales.”

“These appeals .. . . are an alert
to all the people of. the world that
the great whales are being
slaughtered in a cruel and inhua
mane manner that would be out-
lawed everywhere if it took place
on land,” said Dr. John Beary, vice
president for science 0f the AW]-

ban on commercial whaling in the North Atlantic. A second fall-
back United States/Australian proposal would totally prohibit the
use of the "cold" harpoon. This barbaric implement, which causes
a slow, anguished death was banned for large whales at last year's
. «.mmeeting, but it continues to be used in killing thousands of the small ;
minke whales. If commercial whaling is not ended this year, it is
essential at the very least to eliminate immediately the tor-
ture of these friendly, inquisitive whales who represent the
last in the ruthless chain of destruction which began with the
right whales, the blue whales and the humpback whales (all now
"commercially extinct") and continued with the fin whales, sei
whales, and Brydes' whales, that are now close to the same state,
leaving only the smallest of the baleen whales, the minke, l/lOth
the size of the blue whale, to bear the brunt of the industry.

 

 

 

France has proposed a phase—out of pelagic minke whalinq over
a three—year period and has joined the Netherlands, the Seychelles
and the U.K. in proposing a moratorium ontﬂua killing of sperm

whales. This is the proposal that would have passed last year if
Canada had not voted with the whaling nations to kill the sperm
whale mOratorium.

Sweden will propose protection for all fin and sei whales.
This corresponds with action taken at the New Delhi meeting of
the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES)
this March. The fin, sei and sperm whales were listed on Appendix I
of the Convention, thus banning international commercial trade in
their parts and products. The overwhelming vote of 37-2 isolated
Japan and the Soviet Union, the only nations to vote against it.
(Japan has announced it will not abide by the CITES trade restric-
tions.) .

At the coming IWC meeting, it is essential to prevent these
relentless whale—killers from gathering the support they seek
from countries susceptible to political or economic pressure.

Please write to President Ronald Reagan, requesting him per-
sonally to instruct the U.S. delegation to take leadership on all
whale protection_proposals.

THEN WRITE TO AS MANY OTHER HEADS OF STATE AS YOU CAN URGING
THEM TO SUPPORT THE INDEFINITE MORATORIUM ON ALL COMMERCIAL WHAL-
ING, AND IF IT SHOULD FAIL, TO SUPPORT ALL OTHER MORATORIUM AND
HUMANE PROPOSALS AT THE JULY MEETING. Your letters are important,
for they exemplify world public opinion, bringing it tangibly to
each government. Airletters for mailing to foreign countries save
postage. They may be purchased at the Post Office. Background on

key IWC member countries follows together with the names and ad-
dresses of their heads of state.

ICELAND is important in this struggle. Chairman of the IWC
is Thordur Asgeirsson. If he is instructed by his government to
vote for a moratorium, it would be virtually impossible for Japan
and Russia to prevent its adoption. However, the owners of the
Icelandic whaling station sell almost all of their whale meat to
Japan, and they have powerful influence in their country. If they
continue to exert this selfish influence to the detriment of whales
worldwide, it may be necessary to extend the boycott, already on
Japanese, Russian and Norwegian goods, to Icelandic products.

Much of the fast food chain fish sold in the United States is
imported from Iceland.

‘Please write Prime Minister Thoroddsen urging him to instruct
Mr. Asgeirsson to vote for a moratorium on commercial whaling.
You may wish to tell him you will decide after learning of Ice-

land's actions at the IWC this July whether to begin boycotting
Icelandic products.

SPAIN. There is no international observer at the spanish
whaling station, and it has repeatedly been charged with killing
many more whales than the IWC quota. Most of the whale meat is
sold to Japan. All nations should be urged to demand internation-
al observers on all whaling ships and shore stations.

Spain twice fikuiobjections to IWC regulations in the less
than two years it has been a member! Then, fear that the United
States would invoke the Pelly and Packwood-Magnuson amendments
against the Spanish fishing industry caused Spain to withdraw
these objections. These two invaluable U.S. laws provide major
penalties in the form of embargo of fish products or removal of
fishing rights within the U.S. ZOO-mile limit for a nation that
”diminishes the effectiveness of an international agreement" for
the conservation of marine resources.

 

Please write the King of Spain urging him to end the whaling
which is giving Spain a bad name internationally, bringing an
insignificant economic return, and jeopardizing the large Spanish
fishing industry. Urge him to reverse the Spanish Commissioner's
1980 voting record and, instead, support the moratorium and humane
proposals.

SOUTH AFRICA gave up whaling several years ago and, at the

NORWAY's new Prime Minister Brundtland, a woman well—disposed
toward whales, was former Minister of the Environment. Please ask
her to put Norway in a leadership position as a protector rather
than destroyer of these magnificent animals. The first Norwegian
Whale Day was June 15th. Let Prime Minister Brundtland know that ﬂ
you have heard of the demands of Norwegian fishermen to continue
killing nearly 2,000 minke whales a year, but tell her you cannot 1
conceive of a country with such advanced animal protection laws
continuing to kill these sensitive, intelligent whales, particu-
larly with the barbaric "cold" harpoon. Urge her to use the
power of her office to end this terrible cruelty, preferably by
stopping all whale killing, but if the total moratorium does not
pass, request that she instruct the Norwegian Commissioner to vote
for all the other moratoria, including the phase out of minke
whaling, and for banning the cold harpoon for all whales regard—

JAPAN, the leader of the whale killers, has received so many
petitions and letters begging them to stop the carnage that it
might seem hopeless to write again. But if you have already writ-
ten the countries we've listed above, then do write a thoughth1
letter to Prime Minister Suzuki, who was elected last year. He '
comes from a fishing family. Point out that the world's foremost .
fishing nation, Japan, has tarnished its image all around the world ;“
because of the policy it has adopted on whales. Third world na-
tions (off whose shores the giant Japanese fishing industry wishes
to operate) are committed to the protection of whales as demonstra-
ted by their votes at the CITES meeting in India in March. (See
page 2.) Remind the Prime Minister pOIitely but firmly of the
37-2 vote to prohibit international trade in any product of fin.

TELEVISION STATIONS RUNNING "SAVE THE WHALES" SPOTS "

Cap'n Ahab dels
To‘Save the Whales

Washington

Cap’n Ahab is leading an adver-
tising campaign to save the whales.

Actor Gregory Peck, who por4
trayed the fictitious Ahab in the
film version of the classic “Moby
Dick,” is being featured in televie
sion advertisements sponsored by

- the Animal... Welfarelnstttnte and
aimed at the whaling practices of
Japan. ~ '

A spokesman said Japan was .
singled out because it is one of the
last countries to provide a market
for whaleproducts and is also the
major killer of whales. ,

The ads, which also feature
television actor Jack Lord, will be
aired in the United States and
Canada'and have been distributed

in Japan.

“A hundred years ago during
whaling’s romantic heyday, a three.
year expedition netted an average
of 37 whales. Today a modern
Japanese or Russian whaling fleet
can eliminate 37 whales in a day
with , brutal military precision,”
Peck says in the ad. “There are
cheap, plentiful substitutes for all
whale products. Unfortunately,
there are no substitutes for,
whales."

' “These appeals . . . are an alert
to all the people of the world that
the great whales are being
slaughtered in a cruel and inhul,
mane manner that would be out-
lawed everywhere if it took place
on land,” said Dr. John Beary, vice
president for science of the AWI.

standing spots by phoning the station nearest to you and request-

Dear Friend of Whales:

Thanks so much for your kind contribution. It will be needed in
the struggle we now have to face owing to the intransigence of
Japan, Norway and Iceland. These three countries have filed
objections to the ban on the cruel cold harpoon which was adopted
by consensus at the last meeting of the International Whaling Com-
mission. The cold harpoon causes agonizing, long-drawn-out death
struggles for the small minke whales on which it is used by these
three countries. They did not vote against the Resolution prdhibit-
ing its use in the 1982~83 season. Japan says it wants more time
to develop a quicker killing method, but a member of the Japanese
Delegation reportedly said that if they had to adhere to the IWC
Resolution, they could. ‘

All friends of whales should express their outrage. Please write
to the following:

Here are some facts you may wish to use in your letters: Whaling
nations have been on notice for four years that the cold harpoon
would have to go. It was banned for large whales at the 1979 IWC
meeting, and the necessity for development of a humane method has
been discussed at every meeting of the IWC since 1974 when Mr. Fujita,
the Japanese Commissioner, blodked discussion of the anti-cruelty
issue on a technicality: namely that it had not been placed on the
agenda of the meeting 60 days in advance. All whale-killing methods
developed to date are painful. They would not meet the standards of

any nation's humane slaughter laws. But the cold harpoon is the
most agonizing of all, and it is used on the small minke whales

to prevent loss of meat. Because the Whalers have reduced the
populations of larger whales to the vanishing point, it is the
small minkes who now must bear the brunt of the dying industry's
greed. As Professor Derek Ovington, Australia's Commissioner to
the IWC. pointed out. the sum total of pain inflicted on whales
has actually increased in recent years because of the large number
of minke whales being killed for the Japanese market.

Please urge the three whaling nations who have filed Objections

so that they can continue to use the cold harpoon in the 1982-83
season, to withdraw their objections. They have a whole year to
finish their research and development of a less cruel killing
method. What's the use of an international meeting of 24 nations
adopting a humane Resolution by consensus only to have it selfishly
disregarded by Japan. Norway and Iceland? Humanitarians should

not buy products from any of these nations.

Dear Friend of Whales,

The great whales are in terrible danger again! Xonr help is
nssdsd uzgsntly. Here is the situation:

Four Japanese whaling vessels have sailed, and they may
already have killed sperm whales in defiance of the votes at
the International Whaling Commission both in 1981 and 1984

We dared not wait to alert you till definite confirmation is
received because U.S.-Japan negotiations are scheduled to
begin November lst in Washington. Officials in the State
Department's Japan desk refuse to reveal their "negotiating
position." President Reagan said in a 1981 statement to the
International Whaling Commission "It is time to recognize the
errors of the past" and he urged the member nations of the
commission to "secure the protection of these magnificent
creatures“ by adopting a moratorium. Now bureaucrats at the
State Department are trying to undermine the U. S. position.

Please urge the President to invoke the Packwood—Magnuson
Amendment, a U.S. law with real teeth. If Japan is
"certified" by the Secretary of Commerce with the support of
the Secretary of State, 50% of the fish catch in U.S. waters
will be stricken from the Japanese fish allocation, and it
will rise to 100% if the killing continues. Please write,
too, to the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of State
urging them not to agree to any further killing of sperm
whales.

The massacre of the great whales has been cut back by more
than 80% over the last 12 years because the United States
has threatened unilateral economic sanctions against whaling
nations that ignore whale conservation measures.

 




Please tell the President that the Japanese shore-based
whalers hara.n9 inttrnatianal tharyers aboard their vessels.
There is no way even to know how many may be slaughtered!

The last American observer at Japanese shore stations
reported the same kind of gross failure to report correctly
that has been revealed in the fish catch off U.S. shores
where federal enforcement officers recently charged that
Japanese ships were underreporting their catches by as much
as 40% in an ingenious scheme that included secret codes and
an alleged conspiracy to evade Coast Guard inspections in the
U.S. ZOO-mile zone.

The International Whaling Commission's Scientific Committee,
calculating the terrible damage to sperm whale populations in
the North Pacific, estimates that even if no sperm whales are
killed for the next ten years, the populations will continue
to decline because of the massive overhunting of the big male
sperm whales.

Yet U.S. bureaucrats may accept Japan's demands for continued
killing of sperm whales, possessors of the biggest brains in
the world. Such a capitulation would reverse 12 years of
U.S. leadership in whale conservation, destroy the
credibility of the U.S. laws that enforced the reform of the
IWC, and encourage Japan and all other whaling nations to
demand special deals for their whalers. The six whaling
nations that have agreed to end whaling next year would be
emboldened to ignore the moratorium. And Japan, the Soviet
Union and Norway would be further encouraged to defy the
moratorium.

The four Japanese catcher boats that went sperm whaling last
week were called back this week Under pressure from the
Japanese pelagic fishermen, who fear U.S. sanctions. But it
is apparent that they plan to go whaling again as soon as a
"deal" is cut with the U.S. (The whalers reportedly took as
many as 7 whales, but may have dumped them at sea rather than
bring the evidence of their pirate whaling ashore at this
time.)

Please alert your Representative and Senators to the danger
of the situation, too. Ask them to contact The White House.

When you talk to your congressman's office, ask for support
of the Packwood—Magnuson sanctions. Japan catches around
$500 million worth of fish in U.S. waters, so it stands to
lose far more than the $5 million that 400 sperm whales are
worth.

The Japanese government "is trying to have its cake and eat
it, too" by exerting strong pressure on the State Department.
Your letters are of critical importance at this time. Please
ask your friends to write too, and if you can send a (tax
deductible) contribution to the Animal Welfare Institute' s
Save the Whales Campaign, it will be greatly appreciated.

This is a fight that must be won!

Dear Friend of Whales,

, Warm thanks for your kind donation for the continuing fight against
commercial whaling. Events which have occurred since we wrote you
this summer have worsened the situation and we must ask for your
help again. Here are the facts:

1) The Icelandic whaling company, after briefly halting its so-
called "scientific" killing of whales for "research," is out
killing whales again.

2) The Icelandic government is urging every citizen of the country
(population approximately 250,000) to eat whale meat to try to
comply with an admonition by the International Whaling Commission
that whale products obtained under "scientific permits" must be
"primarily" consumed at home.

3) Iceland is offering to sell 49% of this whale meat to Japan
where it is worth millions of dollars —- money that would keep the
Icelandic whaling company in business during the commercial whaling
moratorium that Iceland had promised to honor.

4) The U.S. State Department, far from using the sanctions
available to our government, has cabled Japan to say that "though
it is U.S. policy to discourage any activity which might stimulate
commercial aspects of whaling," the United States will take no
action against Japan if it buys whale meat from Iceland! This
would be gross violation of an agreement made between the U.S. and
Japan in 1984 that Japan would not import any whale products during
the moratorium.

5) Norway continues to kill minke whales using a technical
"objection" to the International Whaling Commission quotas to evade
the moratorium. The IWC Scientific Committee recommended and the
commissioners voted that minke whales in the North Atlantic be
classified as "protected" because their populations have fallen
precipitously under the pressure of intense whaling. Norway's
answer is to set up a new committee of its own choosing scheduled
to report findings next year. Meanwhile the slaughter continues,
and though Secretary of Commerce Malcolm Baldrige certified Norway
under the Pelly Amendment, President Reagan stated he would not
invoke sanctions "at this time." Both Norway and Iceland have
threatened retaliation against strategic NATO bases if the U.S.
should impose sanctions against them for outlaw whaling.

 




6) Japan has announced it will continue "research" whaling and
"subsistence" whaling, meaning commercial whaling under euphemistic
terms that take unfair advantage of 100pholes in the treaty.

What can we do to counter these grim happenings? WE CAN BOYCOTT
ICELANDIC, NORWEGIAN AND JAPANESE GOODS.

we can inform the embassy of each country that we will boycott
their.wares until they step all eemmertial trade in the graduate

ANIMAL WELFARE INSTITUTE P.O. Box 3650 Washington, D.C. 20007

January 5, 1984

Dear Friend of the Whales,

When President Reagan visited Japan in November, he took with him a strong
message: Japan must agree to abide by the 1986 moratorium on commercial whaling
established by the International Whaling Commission in an overwhelming 25 to 7
vote by the member nations.

Secretary of State George Shultz conveyed this firm policy of ending the
tragic slaughter when he met with his counterpart, Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe.
The Japanese were pressing for the U.S. to abandon its leadership in whale con—
servation, but Mr. Shultz rejected the pressure and informed Japan of the deep
commitment of the Reagan Administration to saving the whales.

Secretary Shultz warned that Japan would face further economic sanctions if
it does not make progress toward withdrawing its objection to the moratorium. In
response to Japan's defiance of the moratorium, the U.S. this year reduced Japan's
fishing allocations in American waters by 132,000 tons, worth more than $50 million.

Japan's fishing industry, which controls the whaling, is reeling from the
heavy sanctions and continuing pressure from the U.S. government and conservation-
ists. It now appears likely that Japan will agree to the whaling ban soon if we
keep the pressure on.

Norway's fishing industry, too, has felt the effects of massive public outcry
against its defiance of the moratorium and the consequent boycott of several big
fast food chains that use Norwegian fish. The Norwegian government is also consi-
dering a withdrawal of its objection.

Thanks to the dedication of you and other conservation and animal welfare
activists, we are on the verge of shutting down the international whaling industry.

 

Please help us keep the pressure on the outlaw whaling nations in the coming
weeks. Here's what you can do:

1) Continue boycotting Norwegian and Japanese fish. Call your local markets
and restaurants and ask the managers to stop stocking or serving fish from the
whale-killers.

2) Write a letter to President Reagan, praising his Administration's strong
policy against the whaling nations and urging him to resist the pressures to
compromise.

3) Support our campaign by making a tax-deductible contribution to the Animal
Welfare Institute. Your support has enabled AWI to reach tens of millions of
people worldwide and make the great whales the most popular conservation cause ever.

 

Here in Washington, we must contend with influential American lobbyists hired
by the whaling interests as well as the governments of Japan and Norway. The
Japanese are spending more than $1 million annually on four well-connected lobbyists
who are seeking to undermine the strong U.S. anti-whaling policy:

Richard Frank, U.S. Commissioner to the IWC and Administrator of the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration under President Carter, was hired personally
last year by the Japanese whaling commissioner, Kunio Yonezawa, to fight the U.S.
laws and policies on whaling. Frank, who has been paid more than $70,000 in the
past year, has been using his experience and contacts to organize counter-pressures.

 

Brock Adams, Secretary of Transportation under President Carter and a former
Congressman from the State of Washington, defends Japan's fishing within the U.S.
ZOO-mile zone by lobbying in the halls of Congress and the corridors of federal
agencies and the boardrooms of commercial interests. His law firm was paid more than
$450,000 by Japanese fishing associations in the past year.

 

1

 




Steve Perles, former aide to the powerful Senator Ted Stevens (R, Alaska)
lobbies in Washington for both the Japanese Whaling Association and the Japan
Fisheries Association. He is being paid more than $80,000 annually.

 

Alan Macnow, a public relations specialist as well as lobbyist, is being paid
about $450,000 annually to disseminate pro-whaling propaganda and to influence
Congress and the Administration.

 

The Norwegians are now emulating the Japanese. In early 1983, the Norwegian
Fishermen's Association hired as their Washington lobbyist Terry Leitzell, who
headed the National Marine Fisheries Service under President Carter. He is working
closely with the Norwegian government to counter the pressures of the U.S. govern-
ment and conservationists. Leitzell is being paid more than $30,000 annually.

A thorough check of U.S. Department of Justice files has brought this startling
information to light. The lobbyists are obliged to report under the Foreign Agents
Registration Act, and we have obtained copies of their reports.

The reason Japan and Norway are exerting such pressure on the U.S. government
is because U.S. law provides sanctions when nations refuse to abide by decisions
of the International Whaling Commission.

The Pelly Amendment to the Fishermen's Protective Act allows the President to
embargo the fishery products of nations that diminish the effectiveness of inter~-
national fishery conservation agreements. The Packwood—Magnuson Amendment to the
Fishery Conservation and Management Act automatically cuts the fishing allocations
of defiant nations by 50% within the U.S. ZOO-mile zone and can totally bar a nation.

Japanese fishermen catch more than $400 million worth of fish in U.S. waters,
and export hundreds of millions more to the U.S. Norway exports nearly $100
million of cod, salmon, sardines and shrimp to the United States.

The fishing industries of Japan and Norway could be severely crippled if they
do not agree to the whaling moratorium that becomes effective at the end of 1985.

The fishing/whaling interests of Japan and Norway are now fighting last-ditch
battles within their nations to preserve their obsolete industries. Public and
government opinion in both Japan and Norway are turning against them. Even the
fishing industries, impacted by the U.S. sanctions and boycotts, are realizing that
defending the whalers is becoming too costly.

A few more weeks of heavy economic and political pressure on Japan and Norway
should finally force them to withdraw their objections to the moratorium. Please
do whatever you can to hasten the end of the cruel massacre of whales.

 

 

 

Remember: Press the boycott of fish from Japan and Norway with your local
grocers and restaurateurs. And write a letter to President Reagan (The White
House, Washington, D.C. 20500).

The Animal Welfare Institute, established in 1951 to protect endangered
species and reduce the suffering of all animals, has been a leader in the save-
the-whales campaign. In 1972 we helped push through Congress the landmark Marine
Mammal Protection Act. In 1973 we launched an international advertising campaign
to alert the world to the plight of the great whales.

 

In May, 1983, columnist George Will addressed the cause of the whales. He
wrote: "The campaign to save the whales is a rare and refreshing example of in-
telligence in the service of something other than self-interest.” Last year's
moratorium decision by the IWC was "responding primarily to appeals to conscience
from groups like Greenpeace and the Animal Welfare Institute."

Enclosed is a contribution card and envelope for your convenience. With your
help, we shall make 1984 the year of the whale.

Sincerely,

[an 52:...

be said to have 'seen the elephant?' These are petty and accidental uses; just as

if a stronger race were to kill us in order to make buttons and flageolets of our bones."

ANIMAL WELFARE INSTITUTE m. a... 3650 Washington, Dc. 20007

August 17, 1983

Dear Friend of Whales,

The whales are in serious trouble again despite the gains
made at the last two meetings of the International Whaling Com—
mission (IWC). Here is a short run down of the situation:

Japanese and Norwegian commercial interests are spending
more than $1 million a year on high powered lobbyists in Washing-
ton to thwart congressional resolutions and the policy of the
Administration. They are seeking to discredit the Save the
Whales campaign, to undermine U.S. government policies against
commercial whaling and to protect their lucrative fishing within
the U.S. ZOO—mile zone and fish exports to the U.S.. These
lobbyists are orchestrating high—level pressure by the governments
of Japan and Norway against our government.

On July 18th, while the IWC was meeting, the U.S. Senate
unanimously passed a resolution calling upon the Secretary of
State and the Secretary of Commerce to ”continue to use all di—
plomatic and legal means to achieve worldwide compliance with the
International Whaling Commission moratorium decision."

But, when the Foreign Minister of Japan sent Secretary of
State Shultz a sternly worded letter demanding that the United
States stop penalizing Japan's fishing industry because of its
whaling, Secretary Shultz agreed to "set aside" fish allocation
cuts while Japan makes a ”study" of the economic and social ef—
rfects of the ban on commercial whaling.

  
      
       
 
  
    

U.S. law clearly links the protection of whales with fishery
allocations. In April, 100,000 metric tons were cut from Japan's
fish allocation within the U.S. ZOO—mile limit. The monetary

value is estimated at $55 million.

  
         
     
     

Japan still refuses to rescind its objection to the moratorium
(passed by a vote of 25—7 in 1982). Unless further cuts in allo-
cations are made, there is no hope of ending the commercial whaling
that has pushed species after species of great whales to the brink
of extinction.

We must mobilize all concerned conservationists to counter
the powerful effort by the whaling nations to overturn the pro-
gress we have made in saving the whales.

Please read this letter and take action! We cannot let the
ruthless whale—killers buy influence in Washington. Here is what
we are up against:

The Japanese fishing/whaling industry, working hand—in—hand
with the Japanese government, has hired well-connected Washington
lobbyists. This is how the million dollars a year they are spending
breaks down.

Richard Frank, U.S. Commissioner to the IWC and Administrator
of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration under Pre-
sident Carter, was hired personally last year by the Japanese
whaling commissioner, Kunio Yonezawa, to fight the U.S. laws and
policies on whaling. Frank, who has been paid more than $70,000
in the past year, has been using his experience and contacts to
organize counter+pressures, such as threats by Japan against U.S.
fishermen, who sell large quantities of fish to the Japanese.

Brock Adams, Secretary of Transportation under President
Carter and a former Congressman from the State of Washington,
defends Japan's fishing within the U.S. ZOO-mile zone by lobbying
in the halls of Congress and the corridors of federal agencies and
the boardrooms of commercial interests. His law firm was paid
more than $450,000 by Japanese fishing associations in the past
year.

 

Steve Perles, former aide to powerful Senator Ted Stevens
(R, Alaska) lobbies in Washington for both the Japan Whaling Asso—
ciation and the Japan Fisheries Association. He is being paid
more than $80,000 annually.

 

Alan Macnow, a public relations specialist as well as lobbyist,
is being paid about $450,000 annually to disseminate pro—whaling
propaganda and to influence Congress and the Administration.

 

The Norwegians are now emulating the Japanese. Earlier this
year, the Norwegian Fishermen's Association hired as their Wash—
ington lobbyist Terry Leitzell, who headed the National Marine
Fisheries Service under President Carter. He is working closely
with the Norwegian government to counter the pressures of the U.S.
government and conservationists. Leitzell is being paid more than
$30,000 annually.

A thorough check of U.S. Department of Justice files has brought
this startling information to light. The lobbyists are obliged to
report under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, and we have ob—
tained c0pies of their reports.

The reason Japan and Norway are exerting such pressure on the
U.S, government is because U.S. law provides sanctions when nations
refuse to abide by decisions of the International Whaling Commission.

Actions at the International Whaling Commission

Major victories for the whales were won at the IWC meeting in
July. Whale quotas were cut by more than 2,500 to less than 10,000
for the 1984 whaling season. Just ten years ago, the whalers were
slaughtering more than 50,000 whales annually. Peru agreed to
obey the 1986 moratorium on commercial whaling adopted by the IWC
last year, joining Iceland, Spain, Brazil, Chile and South Korea
in phasing out their whaling industries. Norway's quota of minke
whales was cut from 1,690 this year, to 635 for 1984.

These achievements have been won because of your efforts and
those of thousands of people like you who urged the United States
to stand firm against the whaling nations.

However,_three hard-core whaling nations are still defying
international opinion and the moratorium decision of the IWC.
Japan, the Soviet Union and Norway are bitterly declaring that
they will-not lay down their deadly harpoons.

These defiant whaling nations are counter—attacking the con-
servation community and the U.S. government, both of whom are
applying heavy pressure to win the cessation of whaling.

The boycott against the fish products of the outlaw nations
is proving costly to them particularly Norway which has already
lost large contracts. The whaling nations, angrily denouncing
these boycotts are making massive efforts to counter these actions.

Please Help Battle the Whaling Nations

We need your help now to defeat the whale killers. Here's
what you can do.

1) Please write to President Reagan praising the strong
policy he has pursued for whale protection, inclUding the April
cut in fish allocations to Japan. Urge him to instruct the De-
partments of State and Commerce to continue these cuts. The
President will visit Japan in November when he should demand com-
pliance with the 1986 moratorium. Please ask him to do so. His
address is:

The President
The White House
Washington, D.C. 20500

Then please write to Secretary of Commerce Baldrige urging
him to stand firm until Japan rescinds its objection to the IWC—
determined moratorium on commercial whaling. Secretary Baldrige
holds the key pg Japan's next cut ip_fish. Unless he releases to

to the State Department the remaining fish in what is known as the
TALFF (Total Allowable Foreign Fishing), State cannot provide an
estimated 140,000 tons of fish to Japan this September.

Senator Packwood, a foremost champion of the whales, is Chair—
man of the Senate Commerce Committee. Please join your voice with
his in strongly urging the withholding of these fish from Japan
until the Japanese government agrees to withdraw its objection.

2) Write letters to the presidents of the major tuna—packers,
who purchase tens of millions of dollars of tuna (as much as half
of all tuna sold in America) from the Japanese companies that kill
the whales. Ask them pg stop importing from the Whalers.

 

 

Three prominent U.S. corporations own the tuna—packers: Ralston—
Purina owns Chicken—of—the—Sea, H.J. Heinz owns Star~Kist, and
Castle & Cooke owns Bumble Bee.

3) Support the Animal Welfare Institute's efforts in battling
the whaling nations. We helped launch the Save the Whales campaign
more than a decade ago. Since then we have fought in Washington
and around the world to halt the slaughter of these magnificent
creatures. Our advertisements have reached into every nation and
sparked international outrage against the ruthless massacre. Whales
are perhaps the best known conservation cause in the world.

Columnist George Will wrote earlier this year: ”The campaign
to save the whales is a rare and refreshing example of intelligence
in the service of something other than self-interest.” Last year's
moratorium decision by the IWC was ”responding primarily to appeals
to conscience from groups like Greenpeace and the Animal Welfare
Institute,” stated Will.

SAVE THE WHALES!

Four Nations Defy Whaling Ban

Boycott

These whaling nations have declared they will not
abide by the ban on all commercial whaling, set to begin
in 1986, that was adopted by the International Whaling
Commission (IWC) last year.

Please help the international conservation com-
munity in the struggle against the greedy fishing industries
that have driven the great whales to the brink of ex-
tinction. Don’t buy fish from Japan, Norway, Peru or the
Soviet Union.

Teach the whale-killers an expensive lesson.
Ask your local restaurants and supermarkets to stop
purchasing fresh, frozen and canned fish from the out-
law whalin nations.

Aready, the largest seafood restaurant chain in
the US, Long John Silver’s Seafood Shoppes, has
declared it will not import from nations that do not abide
by lWC regulations. The company, with more than 1,300
restaurants, cancelled $5 million in orders from Norway.

The US. government is imposing economic sanc-
tions againstthe Japanese fishing industry for its defiance.
The Japanese fishing allocation in US. waters has been
cut by 100,000 metric tons, and more cuts are likely this
year if Japan does not agree to halt the slaughter.

What Scientists Say

Sir Peter Scott, the great naturalist, states: “In
light of our present knowledge of these magnificent mam-
mals, no civilized person can contemplate whaling
without revulsion and shame at the insensitivity of our
own species. Whaling is an affront to human dignity, a
debasement of human values and sensibility. "

Jacques Cousteau. the famed oceanographer,
Writes: “The only creatures on earth that have bigger—
and maybe better— brains than humans are the Cetacea,
the whales and dolphins. Perhaps they could one day tell
us something important, but it is unlikely that we will hear
it. Because we are coldly, efficiently and economically
killing them off. "

Fish fviom Japan, Norway, Peru and Russia

Please Support Our Campaign

In addition to putting economic pressure on
the whaling nations through the boycott, please help
increase the political pressure by asking your na-
tion‘s head of state to file a protest against com-
mercial whaling with Japan, NonIvay, Peru and the
Soviet Union. No nation has the right to wipe out these
great creatures of the sea. especially for such petty uses
as lubricating oil, cosmetics and animal feed.

We urgently need your help to battle the powerful
whaling interests. The Animal Welfare Institute will be
pressing the fight at the annual meeting of the IWC
next week (18-23 July in Brighton, England). We shall
continue to expose the cruel massacre until the last
harpoon is silenced.

Please contribute as generously as you can. A
major breakthrough is so close that your tax-deduct-
ible donation is more important than ever. Fora donation
of US. $20 or more, you will receive a beautiful, four-

ANIMAL WELFARE INSTITUTE PO. Box 3650 Washington, Dc. 20007

August 17, 1983

_ Dear Friend Of Whales,

The whales are in serious trouble again despite the gains
made at the last two meetings of the International Whaling Com—
mission (IWC). Here is a short run down of the situation:

Japanese and Norwegian commercial interests are spending
more than $1 million a year on high powered lobbyists in Washing—
ton to thwart congressional resolutions and the policy of the
Administration. They are seeking to discredit the Save the
Whales campaign, to undermine U.S. government policies against
commercial whaling and to protect their lucrative fishing within
the U.S. ZOO-mile zone and fish exports to the U.S.:- These
lobbyists are orchestrating high—level pressure by the governments
of Japan and Norway against our government.

On July 18th, while the IWC was meeting, the U.S. Senate
unanimously passed a resolution calling upon the Secretary of
State and the Secretary of Commerce to “continue to use all di—
plomatic and legal means to achieve worldwide compliance with the
International Whaling Commission moratorium decision."

But, when the Foreign Minister of Japan sent Secretary of
State Shultz a sternly worded letter demanding that the United
States stop penalizing Japan's fishing industry because of its
whaling, Secretary Shultz agreed to ”set aside” fish allocation
cuts while Japan makes a ”study” of the economic and social ef—
fects of the ban on commercial whaling.

U.S. law clearly links the protection of whales with fishery
allocations. In April, 100,000 metric tons were cut from Japan's
fish allocation within the U.S. ZOO-mile limit. The monetary
value is estimated at $55 million.

Japan still refuses to rescind its objection to the moratorium
(passed by a vote of 25—7 in 1982). Unless further cuts in allo-
cations aré made, there is no hope of ending the commercial whaling
that has pushed species after species of great whales to the brink

of extinction.

 




 

“2.

We must mobilize all concerned conservationists to counter
the powerful effort by the whaling nations to overturn the pro-
gress we have made in saving the whales. ~

Please read this letter and take action! We cannot let the
ruthless whale—killers buy influence in Washington. Here is what
we are up against:

The Japanese fishing/whaling industry, working hand—in—hand
with the Japanese government, has hired well-connected Washington
lobbyists. This is how the million dollars a year they are spending
breaks down.

Richard Frank, U.S. Commissioner to the IWC and Administrator
of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration under Pre—
sident Carter, was hired personally last year by the Japanese
whaling commissioner, Kunio Yonezawa, to fight the U.S. laws and
policies on whaling. Frank, who has been paid more than $70,000
in the past year, has been using his experience and contacts to
organize counter—pressures, such as threats by Japan against U.S.
fishermen, who sell large quantities of fish to the Japanese.

 

Brock Adams, Secretary of Transportation under President
Carter and a former Congressman from the State of Washington,
defends Japan's fishing within the U.S. ZOO—mile zone by lobbying
in the halls of Congress and the corridors of federal agencies and
the boardrooms of commercial interests. His law firm was paid
more than $450,000 by Japanese fishing associations in the past
year.

 

Steve Perles, former aide to powerful Senator Ted Stevens
(R, Alaska) lobbies in Washington for both the Japan Whaling Asso—
ciation and the Japan Fisheries Association. He is being paid
more than $80,000 annually.

Alan Macnow, a public relations specialist as well as lobbyist,
is being paid about $450,000 annually to disseminate pro—whaling
propaganda and to influence Congress and the Administration.

The Norwegians are now emulating the Japanese. Earlier this
year, the Norwegian Fishermen's Association hired as their Wash—
ington lobbyist Terry Leitzell, who headed the National Marine

Fisheries Service under President Carter. He is working closely
with the Norwegian government to counter the pressures of the U.S-
government and conservationists. Leitzell is being paid more than

$30,000 annually.

A thorough check of U.S. Department of Justice files has brought
this startling information to light. The lobbyists are obliged t0
report under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, and we have ob-
tained copies of their reports.

The reason Japan and Norway are exerting such pressure on the
U.S. government is because U.S. law provides sanctions when nations
refuse to abide by decisions of the International Whaling Commission-

July 1983
Dear Friend of Whales:

As I write this letter the meeting of the Commissioners to the
International Whaling Commission is about to take place in
Brighton, England. The United States and all the other countries
" that last*YPar voted 25 — 7 to end commercial whaling by 1986 will“’**trawﬁh
be working to consolidate that victory and to bring around the four
' recalcitrant countries who have filed objections to the decision:
Japan, Norway, the Soviet Union and Peru.

A resolution co-sponsored by 44 Senators was introduced July 14th
in the United States Senate which states in part: ”Be it hereby
resolved, that the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Com—
merce are urged to continue to use all diplomatic and legal means
to achieve worldwide compliance with the International Whaling
Commission moratorium decision, including use of the Pelly Amend-
ment to the Fishermen‘s Protective Act, the Packwood—Magnuson
Amendment to the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act
and any other appropriate legal tools."

Please write to President Reagan urging him to maintain the strong
stand his administration has taken in defense of whales. Urge him
to use the U. S. laws that empower him to exert effective economic
sanctions on nations that undercut international agreements by
filing objections. Japan, Norway, the Soviet Union and Peru should
rescind the objections they have filed. Thank the President for
all he has done to bring the battle for the whales this far. Let
him know you are counting on him to achieve victory.

Address him: The President
The White House
Washington, D. C. 20500

Inside this letter, we have reproduced for your information an ad-
vertisement in The Christian Science Monitor made possible by a
gift from a generous friend of whales. You may wish to pass it
along to someone who will help in the effort to end commercial
whaling. If we all continue to work together to help whales, this
brutal slaughter may finally end.

SAVE THE WH   LES!

Four Outlaw Nations Defy Whaling Ban

 

........

apan, Norway,

V
Peru and the Soviet Union

 

Japan. the Soviet Union. Peru and Norway have
announced they will defy the commercial whaling
ban voted last year by the International Whaling
Commission (lWC). The ban would take effect at
the end of 1985.

The defiant whaling nations are vowing to con-
tinue the cruel, unnecessary slaughter that has
driven the great whales to the brink of extinction.
These creatures. with brains larger and more com-
plex than our own. may disappear forever.

We need the help of you and all other concerned
citizens to defend the whales. Please jOin us in
bringing maximum political and economic pressure
on the whaling nations.

The best way to send a message to their greedy
fishing industries is to boycott their fish. They ex-
port hundreds of millions of dollars worth of fish
products to the US. annually.

International Condemnation

The outlaw whaling nations have arrogantly ig-
nored appeals by international governmental and
scientific bodies for a halt to the massacre.

o In 1972 the United Nations Conference on the
Human Environment. meeting in Stockholm.
called unanimously (53 to 0) for a ten-year mora-
torium on whaling. The whaling nations thumbed
their noses at the UN. and have harpooned
more than 300.000 of the giant marine mammals
Since then.

0 The International Union for the Conservation of
Nature. a prestigious SCientific body. has repeat-
edly called for the whalers to lay down their
deadly harpoons before the whales are extermi-
nated. The whalers instead continued their ruth-
less liqwdation of the whales. driVing to commer-
Cial extinction—too few to hunt anymort,Lthe
blue. right and humpback whales and devastat-

ing the remaining speCIes such as the sperm. fin
and sei whales.

‘In 1981 the Convention on International Trade in
Endangered SpeCies. a TS-nation treaty body.
banned trading in products from three endangered

whale speCies. The whalers continue to traffic in the .

meat and Oil of these endangered whales In April.
the treaty organization added two more whaie spe-
Cies to the list; the whalers are vowrng to defy that
ban as well

0 In 1982 the International Whaling Commission.

which presided over the destruction of the
whales for 35 years. decided the slaughter must
be stopped and voted by 25 to 7 to phase out
commercial whaling over three years. Now this
action is being ignored.

The “cold“ harpoon was outlawed by the lWC
because it causes prolonged. unnecessary suf-
fering. But Norway and the Sovret Union have re-
fused to abandon this cruel instrument of death.
The Norwegian government even owns the fac-
tory that makes the cold harpoons. and it is bit—
terly opposing a lawsuit by Norwegian animal
welfare groups. which charge that the cold har-
poon violates that nation‘s humane slaughter law.

Pressure Mounts on Whalers

The United States government. a leader in whale
conservation. is preparing to hit Japan with massive
economic sanctions in response to the Japanese
defiance of the lWC regulations. The Japanese
have been notified that their fishing allocation within
the US. 200—mile zone will be reduced drastically
this summer—by 100.000 tons and worth some $35
million—if Japan does not agree to abide by the
1986 whaling ban.

American conservationists have launched their
own campaign. urging all citizens to boycott fish
from Japan. the Soviet Union. Peru and Norway.
These nations export huge amounts of fresh. frozen
and canned fish to the US. each year. including
cod. tuna. salmon. caviar. shrimp and sardines.

Already. the largest seafood restaurant chain in
America. Long John Silver‘s Seafood Shoppes. has
pledged not to buy fish from nations that do not
abide by lWC regulations. The 1.300-restaurant
company. the largest buyer of cod fillets in the
world. recently cancelled 85 million in annual fish
imports from Norway.

Ask your local restaurants (espeCially fast-food
chains) to stop sewing fish from the outlaw nations.
and request'your local supermarket to stop stocking
frozen and canned fish from the four whaling nations.

 

 

 

 

X What Scientists Say

Carl Sagan writes in his best-selling book. Cos-
mos: “There persists to this day a traffic in the
dead bodies of whales. There are humans who

Hhunt and slaughter whales and market the products

for lipstick and industrial lubricant. Many nations
understand that the systematic murder of such in-
telligent creatures is monstrous. but the traffic con-
tinues. promoted chiefly by Japan. Non/vay and the
Soviet Union. We humans. as a species. are inter-
ested in communication with extraterrestrial intelli-
gence. Would not a good beginning be improved
communication with terrestrial intelligence. with hu-
man beings of different cultures and languages.
with the great apes. with the dolphins. but particu-
larly with those intelligent masters of the deep. the
great whales?"

Jacques Cousteau, the famed oceanographer.
states: “the only creatures on Earth that have big-
ger—and maybe better—brains than humans are
the Cetacea. the whales and dolphins. Perhaps
they could one day tell us something important, but
it is unlikely that we will hear it. Because we are
coldly. efficiently and economically killing them off.“

Dr. Peter Morgane, a neurobiologist at the
Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology in
Massachusetts and an authority on whale brains.
makes an impassioned appeal: “Now that hard sci-
ence has revealed such special brains in whales.
we urge all men and nations to go about the task of
learning ’more about them and what they may tell
us about ourselves and our own evolution. Destroy-
ing another entire species is the most unethical.
despicable outrage man can perpetrate against his
own planet. The holocaust perpetrated against
whales needs to be warred against with all the
tools. economic and otherwise. we can muster. "

Sir Peter Scott, the great naturalist. states: “In
light of our present knowledge of these magnificent
mammals. no civilized person can contemplate
whaling without revulsion and shame at the insensi-
tivity of our own species. Whaling is an affront to
human dignity. a debasement of human values and
sensibility."

Help Us Continue Our
Campaign to Save the Whales

We urgently need your help to battle the powerful
whaling nations. The Japanese and Norwegians
have hired influential lawyers. who formerly repre-
sented the US. on whale issues. to try to weaken
US. resolve for an end to commercial whaling.

Thor Heyerdahl, author of Kontiki, writes of "the peaceful breathing
of whales beside me both day and night while on the world's oceans"
and condemns his country's use of the cruel cold harpoon. ”If
Norway wants to be considered a modern, civilized country, we had
better show the numerous and quickly growing body of those who op—
pose the cold harpoon that we are as humane toward warm—blooded
fellow creatures in the sea as towards those that live on land." He
wrote these words to the Norwegian Animal Welfare Society which is
pressing its law suit against the Norwegian government for failure
to enforce the anti—cruelty law.

You can help end the agonizing slaughter by writing and boycotting.
As noted in the ad, Long John Silver's cancelled more than $5 mil—
lion in orders from Norway. This heartening demonstration of cor—
porate responsibility was followed by the decision by Burger King,
the nation's second-largest fast—food chain (3,500 restaurants), to
limit its purchases only to nations that abide by IWC regulations.
If enough citizens and corporations join in this effort, the whaling
nations will get a very expensive message: end the whale slaughter
or lose the lucrative U.S. market. The value of whaling is minis-
cule compared to their fish exports. Norway's annual kill of some
2,000 whales is worth much less than the contract lost with Long
John Silver's.

Here are the major fish exports to the United States by the outlaw
whaling nations:

JAPAN —- Tuna, cod, pollock, turbot, sardines, fishcakes and
fishballs, crabmeat, oysters, scallops and lobster.

NORWAY -- Fresh and frozen salmon, cod, shrimp and prawns,
haddock, fresh water trout, and canned sardines.

PERU -- Shrimp and prawns, abalone, and sardines.
SOVIET UNION -- Caviar.

Tell your friends about the boycott campaign. Ask them to join the
effort. Write a letter to your local newspaper, explaining the
issue and calling for all citizens to boycott the outlaw nations.
Write letters to the two leading supermarket and restaurant chains
that purchase large quantities of fish from the whaling nations:

Dear Friend of Whales,

Thank you very much for your contribution to the Save the Whales
campaign. Your support and personal efforts played a vital part
in bringing about two hard-won victories for the beleaguered whales
at the recent International Whaling Commission meeting.

1) The 25-1 vote for a nearly total ban on killing sperm
whales in 1982. The action by the Commission, Opposed only by
Japan, does not declare a moratorium as such. The Whalers keep
finding ways to block straightforward moratoria. Iceland will be
allowed to spread the quota it got in 1980 over two seasons instead
of a single one, and Japan won an "undetermined" quota in the Western
North Pacific pending a special meeting to be held in 1982. But
zero quotas have been set for all the other oceans of the world,
and it seems highly unlikely that any but zero quotas on sperm
whales will ever again be set by the IWC,

2) A total ban on the "cold" harpoon after next year's

. whaling season was adopted by consensus. This decision was cham-
pioned by acting U.S. Commissioner Tom Garrett, who has devoted

ten years to fighting for whales. He reminded the Commission that
"the present movement to protect the great whales derived its
initial impetus as much from outrage over cruel killing as from
concern over decimation of stocks...lt is time, " he said, "to
actwat last resolutely and honestly to insure that these beautiful,
sentient and probably highly intelligent mammals are killed, if
they must be killed, in a humane and efficient way." When this
ban is implemented in the 1982-3 season, the slow, agonizing deaths
now suffered by thousands of whales will be ended.

But next year 8102 minke whales are scheduled for annihilation--
1384 more than last year! And all will be killed with the cruel
"cold" Harpoon.

A total of 14,070 whales can be legally killed under IWC quotas
in the coming season--a reduction of only 453 from the previous
quotas.

Spain succeeded, by ruthless bargaining, in obtaining a quota
of 210 fin whales for the next whaling season despite clear evidence
that for the last five years Spanish shore stations have been
regularly killing young whales under the legal size. Scientists
fear this population may be on the verge of collapse.

We must.redouble our efforts to obtain a ban on ALL commercial
whaling next year. Here are some suggestions for action:

1) Phone a local automobile dealer who sells Japanese cars
and ask him to reIay to the manufacturer in Japan your Opposition
to the harpooning of whales.

2) The great dancer and director, Mikhail Baryshnikov, has
just prepared an appeal for an end to commercial whaling. 'We will
soon be sending out the tapes of Mr. Baryshnikov's televised’ﬁEETic
service announcements, which were filmedfby NBC on Augustlb. lYou
can hel spread the word by phoning one or more of your local tEIE-
Vision stations and asking them ifthey would like to run the tapes
as a puinc service. Let us know who at the station wants to have
c0pies sent, and we will dispatch them to the person you indicate in
your letter. The tapes are 10 seconds, 20 seconds, and 30 seconds
long, very beautiful and moving as Baryshnikbv's love for whales,

and indeed all animals, comes through strongly. A young whale
and its mother swim gracefully in the background as he speaks for
them.

3) Fast-food chains use fish from whale killers. Much of the
fish sold in American fast-food restaurants comes from Japan, Iceland
and Norway. You can help put pressure on the whalers by writing to
the fast-food companies and urging them to stop buying fish from the
whalihg countries.

 

 

McDonald's--The fish sandwiches served at McDonald's are
made from fish purchased from Nitto Hogei Company, a large Japanese
fishing company that operates several whaling ships along the
Japanese coast and kills hundreds of whales annually. Nitto Hogei
is also part owner of the Japan Joint Whaling COmpany, which sends
a fleet to the Antarctic each year to harpoon thousands of minke
whales. Please write to the president of McDonald's and request
that his compaﬁ?, the largest restaurant chain in the worId, stOp
buying Japanese tish--espec1a11y from Nitto Hoge1--or fish from
any other Whaling nation.

, Arthur Treacher's, Long John Silver's and H. Salt--These
three fish-and-chip chains buy huge amounts of fish from Iceland,
Norway and Japan. Ask the presidents of these companies to help
send a message to the whaling nations by refusing to buy their fish
until all whale-killing is stopped.

4) you can help, too, by encouraging nations who are working
to save the whales. At the week-long meeting of the International
Whaling Commission just concluded in Brighton, six new member countries
voted to protect whales. Letters of appreciation to their heads of
state would be an encouragement tohtheir continuing efforts. Your
Aletters can be addressed to their embassies in the United States
as listed below:

The four suggestions of ways to help end commercial whaling
are given with the hope you will do as many as you can. We would
be grateful to hear what response you receive to any and all calls
and letters. Thanks for all you can do.

Sincerely,

Christine Stevens
President
