 

 

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COM-
MITTEE.

IN presenting their thirteenth Annual Report, the Com-
mittee congratulate the members and friends of the Society
on the continued progress of the cause of humanity, and
the gradual decrease of the offences the Society was estab‘
lished to suppress. A wholesome apprehension has
engendered a disposition on the part of many persons to
show more compassion on their patient and uncomplaining
servants.

The Report of the Secretary gives in detail the work.
performed by the Society during the past year.

_Reports the passage of an “Act relating to Diseased
Animals.”

The thanks of the Society were voted to that most reliable
institution, the “ Safe Deposit Company of. New York,”
for again kindly extending to it the free use of a place of
safe keeping for its important documents.

Also the thanks of the Society to the Police Department
of the City of New York, and to the Western Union Tele-
graph Company for telegraphic facilities rendered.

Also the thanks of the Society to the American Bank

Note Company for a beautiful bound book of elegantly-
engraved checks for the use of the Society.

The reprinting and extensive circulation of an important
article on vivisection, from the “ Whitehall Review.”

That the city authorities had placed outside the head—
quarters of the Society a handsome lamp, free of expense.

place:

SECRETARY’S REPORT.

IT is gratifying to report that instances of wanton cruelty
are not so frequently witnessed as heretofore, and the pains
and penalties inﬂicted upon offenders have undoubtedly
mitigated the sufferings of defenceless animals ; but it is
obvious that were it not for the strict enforcement of the
laws through the agency of the Society, the worst brutali-
ties would reappear, and the rufﬁans who delight in torment“
ing dumb creatures would multiply.

Cruelty has now to be followed to be detected ; it exists
to a very large extent, but not so openly as formerly ; and
to discover offenders requires great vigilance.

Reports received from many of the branches and agenn
cies of the Society, state that the number of cases requir-
ing prosecution in their respective localities, are greatly
decreased during the past year. During 1878, the number
of cases of cruelty to dumb animals coming within the
jurisdiction of the Society, and which were investigated by
its special agents, was 3,660. In 821 of these cases the
offenders were arrested and convicted.

Since the organization of the Society in 1866, it has pros-
ecuted and convicted 6,809 offenders, and its agents in-
terfered and prevented the abuse of animals upon 16,857
occasions. ’

AJIIB ULANCE AN D DERRICK WORK.

The ambulances of the Society, which are kept ready for
service night and day, removed 203 disabled horses from
the streets, and the derrick and slings, made expressly for
the purpose, were the means of rescuing many horses and
other animals from excavations, etc., into which they had

fallen.

LECT U RES.

The President has delivered several lectures in the City
of New York and other parts of the State, the principal
ones being before the Farmer’s Club, at Cooper Institute, 1n
April last, on the subject of “ Milk and Swill Milk,” in the
Methodist Episcopal Church at Katonah, and the Free
Baptist Church at Laconia, New Hampshire, in August,
on the purposes and work of the Society.

TRANSPORTATION 0F CATTLE.

Notwithstanding the strenuous exertions of the Parent
Society, and of kindred institutions throughout the coun-
try, Congress has not yet passed adequate measures. to
remedy the shocking cruelties inﬂicted upon cattle during
transportation upon railroads.

The extensive trade of shipping cattle to Europe has
entailed upon the Society a large amount of labor. Ship-
pers were so often compelled to provide better ventilation
and accommodation, that a marked change is noticeable
_ in the system. ‘

Mr. John Colam, the able secretary of the Royal Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, reports that
cattle arriving from American ports, are found, on inspec—
tion, to be in better condition than those crossing from
other countries.

 

 

 

 




 

17

FOREIGN CORRESP 0NDENCE.

The Society has been in constant correspondence with
kindred societies in Europe and elsewhere, and has recent-
ly received interesting reports, diplomas, and. other com--
munications from Paris, Hanover, Naples, Bremen, Copen-
hagen, Mexico, Trieste, etc.

Respectfully submitted,

THOMAS W; HABTFIELD,
Acting Secretary,

: There is great need for additional hydrants in differ-
ent parts of our city. The Society has ﬁfteen already, and
continues to increase the number as often as its funds
allow. A most appropriate form of donation could be
made on. the part of the friends of animals, by the erec-
tion of fountains, under the direction of the Society, hear-

ing the name of the donors.

1879.

HEADQUARTERS OF THE SOCIETY,
COR. FOURTH AVENUE AND TWENTY-SECOND STREET,
NEW YORK, FEB. 28th, 1879.

' PRESIDENT’S REPORT. ,

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN :

This is the thirteenth Annual Report of the proceedings
of our Society; and with each succeeding year I realize
the inutility of troubling you with any prolonged remarks
on its past operations. I beg you to pardon me for
making so ambitious a simile as to declare that the
annual revolution of the earth in its orbit is not more
uniform and uninterrupted than are the duties and per-
formances of the Institution with which you are asso-
ciated.

The system upon which it is based, and lives, and
moves, deriving its authority from moral law and the

 




6

consent of alltwell—meaning persons, insured its gradual
emancipation from the perturbations which characterized
its initiatory being. What was at ﬁrst regarded as a
presumptive innovation and infringement of the rights of
property and persons, is now conceded to be as necessary
and important to human interests, as it is to those
defenceless creatures, whose lives and services minister
so vastly to every citizen of the Republic.

That this is so, its continuous growth in public favor, as
expressed by a more hearty acquiescence in the spirit and
practice of the laws, an augmented tenderness toward
every sentient being, and a consequent restraint over the

passions under real and supposed provocation, afford
unmistakable evidence.

As an humble instrument along with yourselves in
bringing about these humane and philanthropic achieve-
ments, believe me that I\share the gratiﬁcation which
each of you enjoys while contemplating such honorable

results.

FINANCES.

While the revenue derived from the property belonging
to the Society has considerably diminished during the
past year, consequent on the exceptional state of the

times, the Institution malntains its normal condition of
exemption from debt.

PARIS CONVENTION.

A Convention, to which all the kindred societies of the
world were invited to send delegates, was held at Paris
during the late Exhibition. Although this Institution
was not-personally represented, I nevertheless caused a
printed address to be prepared in French and English,
detailing the extent and character of our labors, and for-
warded to the Congress.

 

 

 

 




 

BALTIJII ORE CON V EN TI 01V.

An adjourned meeting was also held in Baltimore, on
the 13th of November, of the International Society of
America, having the subject of cattle transportation more.
particularly under consideration.

It was largely attended and productive of excellent
results, and was hospitably entertained during its sojourn
in that city by the generous and affable President of the-
Maryland Society, Charles P. Montague, Esq.

The President of the United States, in his message to
Congress, is pleased to make honorable mention of that
Convention.

OBITUARIES.

That omnipotent sovereign, Death, during the past
year has stricken down and removed from the sphere of
their humane inﬂuence, several of the devoted friends of
the cause we serve. The seats made vacant among your
ofﬁcers by the melancholy departure of the late Townsend
Harris and Thomas C. Doremus are a perpetual regret to
all their associates and the public at large.

These prominent losses were also followed by the
decease of Mrs. Philip Marett, of Connecticut, a most
estimable lady, and long a sincere and generous friend of
your Society.

LOUISA W. KING.

And, ﬁnally, the fell destroyer gathered into his moul-
dering storehouse a victim every way worthy of a Poten-
tate, receiving his authority from the Supreme Ruler of
life and death and every other created thing.

Louisa W. King is no more! This beloved and admi-
rable lady, the friend alike of the helpless brute and the
suffering human race, breathed her last on the seventh

 




 

8
of ’December last, in the home of her birth, Augusta,
Georgia, surrounded by her agonized parents and family.

It requires an abler pen than mine to do justice to the
transcendent worth of that exemplary being.

Constitutionally delicate and of medium stature, her
soul seemed ever too immense for its fragile tenement,
and hence its ﬂight at this time moderates, in a measure,
the surprise her friends experience. It is to her persever-
ing efforts that the State of Georgia this day enjoys the
proud distinction of having, inscribed upon its statute
books, the humanizing laws which give protection to those
humble creatures which serve mankind so faithfully.

Born and educated amidst the reﬁnements and luxuries
of the most polished society, she nevertheless acted as
though her sphere was among the suffering and the needy
of every race of beings more lowly and less fortunate than
herself. The kindred sympathetic heart of universal
nature has reason to mourn her loss.

If in heaven “the spirits of the just made perfect” are
ever recognized by name, surely the angels will know her
as “ Saint Louise.”

COURT OF APPEALS.

The highest tribunal of the State has lately rendered
its decision in the hog slaughterers’ case of Davis 7). The
Society, and the Court of Appeals, in an elaborate and
able report thereof, sustains the action of the Society and
its ofﬁcers ; and both enlarges its authority and commends
its policy and proceedings.

This is the ﬁrst instance, in this country or abroad, it is
believed, that a case simply involving the rights of ani—
mals has ever received the consideration of the supreme
tribunal of any State.
