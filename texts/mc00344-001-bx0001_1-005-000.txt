eizur Law

By MEL L. MORSE

Executive Director, American Humane Association

With state legislatures convening for a new season of law-
making all over the United States, it seems certain that the
commercial and public laboratories that back the National
Society for Medical Research are preparing to mount a new
and violent attack against the country’s organized humane
movement. The immediate objective of the anti-humane
forces will be an extension to new states of animal seizure
laws—the laws that compel humane societies and pounds
to provide animals for experimental uses.

Already such laws have been passed in ﬁve states. There
are indications that similar bills will be introduced this win-
ter in at least ﬁve other states.

The American Humane Association opposes this type of
legislation. The Board of Directors and several conventions
of the AHA have condemned the animal seizure laws. The
Chairman of the Board of the AHA, Kerns Wright, has just

named a national committee of humane-Work leaders to con-

HE animal seizure bills arise,
basically, from a contention by the

There are no dependable statistics, but
many millions of animals now are being

sult and cooperate with humane societies threatened by these
laws.

Despite the fact that the humane organizations of America
have for years been united in opposition to the animal seizure
laws, there are indications that some humanitarians do not
fully understand the critical threat to the future of humane
work that the seizure laws pose. And there is overwhelming
evidence that humane workers have not satisfactorily ex-
plained their position to legislators, the moderate and decent
majority of the medical profession, and to the general public.
Our earlier defeats in ﬁve states and some 30 municipalities
prove this failure.

To further unity within humanitarian ranks and to help
arm humanitarians with facts and arguments which, when
made available to legislators, will enable them to understand
why animal seizure bills should be defeated, the Review of-
fers the following discussion of the issues. '

medical profession and allied sci-
ences that the use of living animals in
laboratories and classrooms is necessary
to the advancement of medicine. Not
all medical people agree with this but
it must be granted that the majority be-
lieve that experimentation upon animals
is, at least, a necessary evil.

Demand for animals by commercial
pharmaceutical laboratories, medical
schools, and private medical research
workers has increased in the last few
decades to astronomical proportions.

used every year in research laboratories
and classrooms. The ﬁgure may run to
more than a half billion. A single drug
laboratory has reported that it uses 500,-
000 animals a year. These include dogs,
cats, horses, monkeys, cows, hamsters,
guinea pigs, rats, mice, and many other
species.

Some laboratories have begun to com-
plain, in recent years, that they are un-

able to get all the animals they want. -

Sometimes they have implied that there
is an actual shortage of animals. At

they want.

Then, a few years back, the animal-
hungry laboratories began to point out
that every year the pounds and the hu-
mane societies of the country administer
euthanasia to a great many homeless,
diseased, injured, and unwanted ani-
mals. Spokesmen for the laboratory in-
terests asserted that this humane ac-
tivity is ”wasteful.” They demanded
that the animals, instead of being given
a quick and painless death, be turned

over to the laboratories for experimental
use.

Some' commercial laboratories and
medical schools approached local pounds
and humane societies with requests for
a surrender of animals. But most city
and county pounds and virtually every
one of the humane societies of the coun-
try ﬂatly refused.

The ﬁnal step in development of the
situation that now endangers animal
protective societies everywhere was the
initiation of a heavily ﬁnanced campaign
by the laboratory interests to compel the
pounds and the humane societies by law
to do what they would not do volun-
tarily. The NationalrSociety for Medical
Research, a Chicago organization backed
money-wise by the proﬁt-seeking phar-
maceutical laboratories and given a re-
spectable front by nominally afﬁliated
medical schools and research organiza-
tions, took the lead. The NSMR calls
itself an "educational” organization.
The fact is that it is devoted to prop-
aganda for the extremists among the
animal experimenters and to campaign-
ing for legislation wanted by laborato-
ries that use animals. It spends very
large sums of money. It seems. obvious
that most of this money comes from in-
terests concerned with proﬁts.

The form of the attack upon the hu-

mane agencies has been a series of bills
in state legislatures and city councils,
aimed at compelling pounds and hu-
mane societies to surrender animals in
their shelters to the laboratories. These
bills usually require the laboratories to
make nominal payments for the animals
but the payment usually is far less than
the current market price for such an-
imals. If the fees charged laboratories
for the animals were many times what
these bills provide it would not alter
the feelings of the humane societies
about surrender of animals. Quite the
reverse is true of the laboratories. Their
objective is not just animals, which are
freely available to them now, but an un-
restricted source of cheap animals.

It must be noted—and never forgot-
ten by humanitarians if these bills are
to be successfully resisted—that the is-
sue they pose is not vivisection v5. anti-
vivisection. Animal experimentation is
already legal. The seizure bills do not
extend that legality.

The issue presented by these bills is
solely whether public pounds and pri-
vately operated humane societies should
and can be compelled by law to provide
animals for experimental uses.

The only argument by the laboratory
people that relates to the issue is their
contention that it is economically waste-

ful for humane societies and pounds to
administer euthanasia to animals that
the laboratories might use.

This argument is a demonstrable
fallacy. Knowing this, the National So-
ciety for Medical Research has in almost
every one of its campaigns attempted to
divert the attention of legislators to ir-
relevant issues. The medical rsearch so-
ciety lobbyists have brought respected
scientists before legislative committees
to tell of their search for a cure for can-
cer; they have wrung the hearts of the
legislators with stories of "suffering
children,” they have re-told the Story of
the discovery of insulin—in short, they
have campaigned most cleverly to keep
legislators, editorial writers, and the
public from thinking about the real pur-
pose of their bills.

Unfortunately, humanitarians have
too often risen to the bait. They have
sometimes seemed to agree with the
smart publicists of the NSMR that the
issue is vivisection v5. anti-vivisection.
And, since there is probably no legis-
lature in the United States in which the
legislators will at this time vote to pro-
hibit experimentation with animals, the
laboratory interests have been winning
battle after battle.

They will win more battles unless
humanitarians change their tactics.

ND now for the humane society
side of the story. To appreciate
why humane societies oppose the

animal seiZure bills, even though most
of them take no part in the years-old
argument over vivisection, and to un-
derstand how—“these bills can actually
destroy humane societies, it is necessary
to know a little about the history of these
organizations. '

The SPCA’s and humane societies are
private organizations of people who or-
ganized to ’protect animals from cruelty
and in other ways to save them from
suffering. The members of these organ-
izations have given tens of millions of
dollars of their own money to build an-
imal shelters, acquire and equip am-
bulances and veterinary clinics, train and
maintain a corps of humane ofﬁcers to
prevent cruelty, provide educational ma-
terials for public schools and. youth or-
ganizations, and conduct other humane
work. A survey conducted by the Na-
tional Humane Review, published in
August, 1952, revealed that these pri-
vate societies now are using more than
$10,000,000 worth of buildings and
equipment—all contributed by individ-
uals—in their activities.

The point to note is that these are

private organizations, privately ﬁnanced.
The animal shelters that they maintain

are private property.

In the course of time since Henry
Bergh founded America’s ﬁrst society
for the prevention of cruelty to animals,
governments of many icities and counties
have asked the humane societies to take
over the animal control and rescue work
formerly done by public pounds. The
old-fashioned pound was (and in some
communities still is) a disgrace to
American life. City and county author-
ities saw that the humane society shel-
ters, on the other hand', usually were
conducted by people who understood
animals and their needs and that in all
cases the motives of the private societies
were humanitarian. ,For both humani-
tarian and political reasons the local
governments have been happy to turn
their animal problems over to the pri-
vate societies. .

In only a very few instances have the
governmental units ever contributed to
the building or maintenance of the hu-
mane society shelters and clinics or to
the purchase of the vast ﬂeet of am-
bulances and other vehicles that the
private societies maintain, or to the sup-
port of any part of the societies’ basic
humane work. Where humane societies
have assumed the functions of public
pounds and animal control agencies—as

cost of their pound service—sometimes
for a very small part. The societies have
gladly contributed their own buildings
and equipment and the time and energy
of their members and administrative
staﬂfs.

The humane societies that operate the
shelters—regardless of whether they in-
clude public pound services—long ago
arrived spontaneously at a universal
code that governs the disposition of
animals that come into their shelters.
Humane societies agree that the only
courses possible are:

1. ‘If possible, return the animal to
its owner;

2. If the owner cannot be found
and the animal is suitable as a
pet, place it in a new home;

3. If no home can be found, give
the animal a merciful end.

No addition to these three alterna-
tives is porriale for a society organized
to protect animals from suffering. No
humane society worthy of the name ever
has voluntarily violated the code.

In their adherence to their code the
humane societies have not singled out
pharmaceutical or medical laboratories
for special strictures. The humane so-
cieties will release no animal for pur-
poses inconsistent with the animal’s wel-
fare. A humane society would not, for

example, release a dog for dog-ﬁghting,
a rabbit for use in training greyhounds,
or a dog to enable a begger to, arouse
sympathy.

It is notable that humanely conducted
city and county pounds—and there is a
constantly increasing number of pub-
lic pounds that are humanely operated
‘ ——have tended to move toward the hu-
mane society pattern. Many of them
have governed themselves by the hu-
mane society code.

Now the laboratory interests are at-
tempting to compel the humane societies
and public pounds to violate their stand-
ards and their consciences. In effect, this
is what the experimenters say:

"It is too expensive for us to get dogs
and cats in the ways that have been
open to us in the past. It may be true
that you would violate the principles
of year supporters by Surrendering an-
imals to us, and that we will save money
at the expense of people who have con-
tributed to year cause—but that’s your
lookout.”

In other words, the laboratory people
want the lawmakers to conﬁscate the
gifts made by humanitarians to humane
societies and use them for the beneﬁt
of other causes and even for the beneﬁt
of private commercial interests.

This proposal would be bad enough
if it afflicted merely the rights of the
humane societies and their contributors.
But the animal seiZure laws also trample
on the rights of the general public and,
if they become more general, these laws
will cause vast suffering among millions
of animals besides those that might be
requisitioned by laboratories.

Mr. and Mrs. john Publicé—the aver-
age Americans—take a friendly interest
in animals. The American Humane As-
sociation estimates that there are more
than 22,000,000 dogs in the United
States and an approximately equal num-
ber of domestic cats. Add the millions
of pet rabbits, canaries, guinea pigs, and
other animals and it becomes evident
. that only children pull harder on the
American heart strings than animals.

When the average man or woman has
a pet that can no longer be kept, the
idea of turning that animal over to a
laboratory for experimental purposes is
unthinkable. It makes little difference
whether the person believes in the ne-
cessity of animal experimentation. He

may believe it necessary but the thought
that his own pet may suffer on a lab-
oratory table is repugnant.

The psychology is like that which
permits the average person to read with-
out serious emotional upset about the
starvation of a million people in far-off
China but brings intense shock when a
single near relative dies.

The point is that people who turn
an animal over to a pound or humane
society want to feel secure in the knowl-
edge that the humane society will live
up to its trust—will protect the animal
and be guided solely by concern for the
animal’s welfare. .

Up to this time, most people have
had that security of trust in their hu-
mane society. Indeed, in many com-
munities this faith in the humane society
has made the old-fashioned "dog catch-
er” a thing of the past. It has virtually
ended the stray-dog and stray-cat prob-
lem. When kindly people ﬁnd a home-
less, ill, or injured animal they promptly
call the humane society to ask for an
ambulance. In many cities, more than
95 per cent of all animals received by
the humane society shelters are deliv-
ered to them by the public—a public
that knows it is doing the best possible
thing for the animals.

But what will the public feel and do
if the humane society shelters become
collection depots for experimental lab-
oratories—even though this is done
against the will of the societies?

No great imagination is required to
provide the answer.

The public would immediately begin
to resort to other and probably less hu-
mane methods of disposing of stray and
unwanted animals. It would make little
difference to the average person whether
the animal was his or a stray. Even. if
a dog is abandoned by its owner, the
persons who give it temporary shelter
or care are sure to regard it as a pet
and to feel the sense of personal respon-
sibility that develops in such a situation
in all decent men and women. Such an-
imals would seldom be turned over to
a humane society that might pass it on to
experimenters.

Pseudo-private animal shelters cer-
tainly would spring up in every com-
munity where a humane society or
pound was forced to surrender animals
to laboratories. This is not speculation;

this has already happened in New York '

City and in other cities where the animal
seiZure law is operative. Such shelters
are operated by well meaning people but
necessarily are poorly equipped and
often hardly humane.

It took years to convince many people
that turning an unwanted or stray an-
imal over to the pound was a more

-humane step than releasing it some-

where in the country "where some kind—
1y farmer no doubt will give it a home.”
If the pounds and the humane societies
are forced to become collecting stations
for laboratories and medical schools,
this method of disposing of animals will
again become widely practiced. The ani-
mals will suffer. Farmers and their
ﬂocks and herds will suffer. The wild
dog and rabies problems will be in-
creased.

That is why the California Wool
Growers Association in 1949 adopted
a resolution condemning the animal
seizure legislation as being adverse to
livestock and poultry interests.

Not all of these results are imme-
diately evident when an animal shelter
is brought under the compulsion of the
animal seizure laws. The humane so-
cieties and the better public pounds
have been building public conﬁdence for
three-fourths of a century. That con-
ﬁdence will not be killed overnight. But,
in the long run, humane societies and
pounds that violate the three-point code

, that heretofore has governed the dispo-

sition of sheltered animals—even if the
violation be involuntary—will lose the
public’s trust.

The public distrust of humane so-
cieties and pounds that would result
from animal seizure legislation would
increase the costs of pound operation.
At the same time it would diminish the
philanthropic gifts that now support the
humane societies and enable them to
perform their public services.

The alternative open to a humane so-
ciety confronted with animal seizure
legislation is to end its operation of the
pound and its community animal control
work. In such a case the cities and
counties must construct or buy costly
buildings and equipment and saddle tax-
payers with a reversion to the city
pound. This has already happened in

some cities where seizure laws are in.

effect.

 

It becomes apparent that the end re-
sult of a general application of the
seizure laws would be that the support-
ers of the humane societies and the tax-
payers would bear the ﬁnancial burden

of supplying experimental dogs that the.
‘ experimental laboratories now object to

bearing.

It also becomes apparent that the suf-
fering of animals would be vastly multi—
plied. .

Against the background of these facts
it seems proper to ask what steps the
laboratory people are taking to solve
their own problems. Remembering that
the experimenters have raised no issue
except their inability or unwillingness

to pay open-market prices for animals, .

a layman might reasonably ask:

Instead of spending hundreds of
thousands of dollars to propagandize
and lobby for, animal seizure laws,

would it not be wiser to use the money .

to establish cooperative animal breeding
farms? '

Could not such breeding farms be
operated in connection with veterinary
schools of medicine, thus serving to
teach breeding and genetics to veter-
inary students and training them in

treatment of animal diseases and animal

care?

What attempts, if any, are being
made to ﬁnd other sources for experi-
mental animals besides the pounds?

What attempts, if any, are being
made to ﬁnd substitutes for animals in
experimental work?

What percentage of the experimental
dollar is spent in obtaining animals? In
other words, precisely how much is at
issue?

What kind of facilities do the lab-
oratories provide for experimental an-
imals?

Are the laboratories willing to permit

_ inspection of their kennels and cages by

humane ofﬁcers, as other places where
animals are conﬁned are inspected, and
to abide by the anti-cruelty laws that
govern all other citizens?

The societies for the prevention of
cruelty to animals have never, in the
past, attempted any interference with
medical research. But in the present sit-
uation the SPCA’s and other humane
societies are being attacked; the greedy
fringe of the laboratories is endangering
the very foundation of a vast structure of
humane work on which humanitarians
have spent millions of their own dollars
and lavished three quarters of a century
of dedicated work. An attack of this kind
creates its own reaction.

The sole issue, when the laboratory
lobbyists present their animal seiz-
ure bills to new legislatures and city
councils, will be the allegation by the
laboratory people that it is "economic
waste" to administer euthanasia to home-

Re printed from

less animals. Humanitarians should in-
sist that this issue be kept clearly before
the legislators and the public. The med-
ical research lobbyists will try to confuse
legislators with their annual parade of
eminent doctors who will talk abOut
everything except the issue. The lobby-
ists will be delighted if humanitarians

‘ will co-operate with them in compound-

ing the confusion. Legislators should ask
these questions:

Are not the costly operations of the
National Society for Medical Research
and its» state and local afﬁliates an eco-
nomic waste?

Is it not economic waste to increase
the cost of pound operations by creating
public distrust of the pounds?

Is it not economic waste to pass legis-
lation that will vastly aggravate the stray
dog problem, with the attendant dangers
to public health and safety?

And, ﬁnally, is it ever ”economic
waste” for a government to encourage
the growth among its people of a hu-
mane sentiment? Even if a few paltry
dollars would be saved for one private
group (the laboratories), at the expense
of another private, group (the humane
societies), would this justify legislation
that would force a vast body of people
to violate their consciences or, alter-
natively, to end a humane work that is
onelof America’s glories?

The humane movement took another gigantic stride forward with the
recent announcement that NBC Television had asked the AHA to serve
as animal treatment consultant. This places the majority of animal action
in the film-TV world under AHA supervision.
In a way, the NBC agreement typiﬁes the vast—perhaps even surprising
-—cooperation between producers and the AHA Hollywood Ofﬁce.
The people of Hollywood, the producers, directors, animal handlers
and all the others, are very much like the people you meet from various
walks of life in any part of the country. They do not condone brutality;
they want no part of it. They are, for the most part, kindly and com-
passionate. And they realize, quite candidly, that they cannot afford to b
permit brutality because of the public opinion landslide which would “mane
crash down upon them.
So it is that the producers welcome AHA supervision as a sort of
protection against themselves, as a uniform and constant check that no
brutality is permitted to slip in, thoughtlessly, inadvertantly, or otherwise. ement
Certainly we recognize that many people object to trained animals, m09/
and to the use of animals for entertainment» purposes. And just as
certainly, we respect that opinion. But we also realize the fact that animals
will be trained.
Objections nothwithstanding, animal lovers (and this obviously includes moyej
the vast majority of all the population in one degree or another) may
rest assured that the animals which appear on TV and in the movies are

not being mistreated.
And friends of the AHA may take great pride in the part they play,

making this assurance a tangible reality. on
Screen action may at times appear brutal, but if the AHA has given its

acceptance, then 720 animal has been mistreated in that production. (See
page 10.)

So, hats off to NBC-TV! They have taken a voluntary step which brings
us all closer to the ultimate goal of proper humane treatment for all
living things.

. should you attend the 82nd Annual AHA Convention in Miami
Beach, Florida?

The Convention, opening Oct. 27, will combine a series of meetings
and sessions that will be of interest to everyone in the humane movement
Some of the subjects to be covered include public relations and fund
raising, humane education, problems of animal protective societies, child
l, p protective services, wildlife and many others. New directors of the AHA
w for the coming year will be elected at the Corporation Meeting. And
y . other highspots are the annual banquet and a tour of the Miami Beach area.

So do plan to be there. You should be!

The Hammer) Slaughter Bill, HR8308, was signed into law on August 27, 1958
by President Eisenhower.

This represents a ﬁnal victory, not only for the humanitarians per re, but also for
the many millions who believe that food animals deserve decent, humane treatment
before slaughter.

In theory, this action means that by 1960 all packers who sell to the government
will be using humane methods of slaughter. In practice this is assurance of a more
humane death for more than 90% of all food animals prepared for market by
packers in the United States.

The AHA ”Seal of Approval” for humane slaughter has been awarded to 21
packers and will continue to be awarded on an annual basis to packers who meet the
rigid standards in handling, stunning and slaughtering.

The AHA and its afﬁliate societies will now concentrate on state and local
regulations which will bring all food animal slaughtering to proper humane

 

 

standards.

 

 

Humane Slaughter
Becomes Reality

SEN. HUBERT HUMPHREY of Minne-
sota says that he has received
between 35,000 and 45,000 letters con-
cerning the humane slaughter bill.

Similar reports from other lawmakers
indicate that the humanitarians must
have had a vast legion of supporters in
what is apparently the all-time record-
breaker for public popularity and sup—
port of a basically humane issue.

The humanitarians—and many thou-
sands of others, who are not normally
identiﬁed with the humane movement——
have proven the old adage that the pen
is mightier than the sword. America
spoke. The lawmakers heard and hu—
mane slaughter has become the law of
the land.

A basic fact, which accounts for the
landslide of mail in favor of humane
slaughter, becomes quite apparent with
a trip through a packing plant Where
the old-fashioned knife-sticking and

ticed. The sights and sounds are enough
to “turn the strongest stomach.” Inhu-
mane slaughter is something, certainly,
which is in violent opposition to the
principles of the American way—~—some-
thing which offends the average citizen.

The story began many, many years
ago. Humanitarians have long wanted
to do something about inhumane slaugh-
ter, but they could do nothing. It was
a complicated problem which deﬁed an-
swering. There could be no request made
of packers, there could be no legislation
——at least not until a practical solution
was available.

Humane societies, united nationally
under the banner of The American Hu-
mane Association, instituted and encour-
aged study of the problem.

. By 1955 the elusive answer had been
pinned down; humane slaughter had
become practical.

Acting upon the AHA’s request, in
1955 Sen. Humphrey introduced the

THE NATIONAL HUMANE REVIEW—SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER,

ﬁrst humane slaughter bill. Senate sub-
committee hearings were held the fol-
lowing year and it became apparent that
there was considerable backing for hu-
mane slaughter although some interests
were opposed to legislation.

The opposition, in effect, stated that
”Yes, we are most certainly in favor of
humane slaughter, but it is not practical
and we are, therefore, opposed to legis-
lation at this time.”

Following the Senate hearings of
1956, a non-compulsory bill was passed
by the Senate, essentially designed to
encourage study of the problem——despite
the fact that organized study had been
underway at that time for no less than
27 years.

When congress reconvened in 1957,
numerous Representatives had toured
packing plants to see ﬁrst hand what
conditions were like. And, under the
leadership of Rep. W. R. Poage, the

House indicated that it was not satisﬁed
with a slaughter bill which lacked com-
pulsion.

Several bills were introduced that year
in both Houses, and a hearing was held
before the House Agriculture sub—com-
mittee.

By this time, humane slaughter had
become an important national issue; it
was a popular cause with the man in
the street. The nation’s press had picked
up the cry and countless newspaper col-
umns heralded the fact that if Congress
passed humane slaughter legislation,
much would be accomplished to curb
misery and suffering. The Boston Her-
ald typically commented: ”Across our
vaunted prosperity and liberty is written
an awful slogan: ‘After all, they’re only
animals.’

”But, are they, really?”

The House heard. In February 1958,
HR8308 was overwhelmingly passed on
voice vote—a modiﬁed version of the
bill which had been introduced at AHA’s
request in 1955 by Sen. Humphrey.

The legislation then traveled over
some rocky roads as it went before the
Senate Committee on Agriculture and
Forestry. The pros and cons testiﬁed
and, ﬁnally, the bill was reported out
on June 18 in amended formmas a
study bill, not too unlike the legisla-
tion which had passed the Senate two
years before! .

Through Sen. Humphrey’s excellent
captainship (and with 17 others co-
sponsoring) the bill was amended back
to the form in which it had passed the
House. The Senate agreed as compul-
sory legislation beat out the study bill
by a vote of 43-40; then the compulsory
bill was passed 72-9.

Actually, While the humane societies
refer to HR 8308 as a "compulsory”
bill, it is not that. There is no penalty
imposed for noncompliance. Packers
who do not meet the requirements after
June 30, 1960 may not sell their prod-
ucts to Uncle Sam. This becomes a very

potent weapon because the government
annually spends about $1.5 billion for
meat and packers presently selling to
the Federal government slaughter a
major part of all food animals.

Humane slaughter involves nothing
more complicated than rendering ani—
mals insensible to pain before they are
slaughtered. From the humane view-

point, Americans are the best fed people
in the world—but to feed us, an esti-
mated 150 million food animals each
year are stuck with a knife while hang~
ing, shackled by a hind leg, or beaten
with a hammer until unconscious.

Ample proof that humane slaughter
is practical lies in the fact that The
American Humane Association has
awarded its "Seal of Approval” for hu-
mane slaughter to a score of packers,
including seven of the nation’s largest.
The Association will continue to award
its Seal to packers who meet rigid stand-
ards in handling, stunning and slaugh-
tering. The Seal is awarded on a yearly
basis, following annual inspections and
the names of these packers are circulated
by AHA in its publications and on
wallet-size cards which are available on
request.

In addition, humane slaughter has
been the law of the land in many foreign
countries (among them Switzerland,
England, the Netherlands) for a num-
ber of years.

T126 National Provisioner, trade paper
of the packing industry sums it up "in
the word d—e-f—e-a-t” (for the industry.)

The editorial, appearing in the August
2, 1958 edition, goes on to say, "That
defeat did not come with the passage
of the House and Senate bills, but has
occurred over the past several years as
the meat industry has maintained an at-
titude which has been largely negative
and ineffective rather than seizing the
opportunity to offer a positive program
of its own i . We have not only
suffered a defeat; we have lost an oppor-
tunity for a great victory.”

And if, indeed, the packers did suffer
defeat——certainly the humane societies
have won a great victory. It has not
been a one-man or a one-organization
battle. Rather, it has been a victory for
many organizations and for many indi~
viduals. Ranking high on the list are the
General Federation of Women’s Clubs,
whoSe 11 million members worked val-
iantly for passage of the bill; the 500
humane societies working individually
and through their national federation,
The American Humane Association and
countless thousands of individuals—far
greater in number than the humanitar-
ians per sew—whose enthusiasm and
persistence convinced Washington that
this was the year for positive action.

Aunt Rosie

By PAULINE L. JENSEN

ROSITA and Lillith were sisters. As
kittens, they were identical in appear-
ance, but as they approached maturity
there were many changes in each.

Lillith, soon shortened to a simpler
”Lily,” was all gentle curves, whereas
Rosita, or “Aunt Rosie” as she soon be-
came, took on the proportions of a ma-
tronly ﬁgure.

Strange it was then that it was Lily
who was destined to motherhood, and
it was Rosie of the matronly figure who
went through life kittenless.

Rosie suffered no frustrations, how-
ever, because Lily, whose vanity grew
with the years, was happy to relinquish
the more boring chores of motherhood
into Rosie’s capable hands. And Rosie
welcomed pseudo motherhood.

From the very beginning, Lily showed
a strong inclination to disassociate her-
self from the more mundane things in-
volved in bringing up a family.

True, she would feed them, but
then, leaping lightly from the basket
she would seek a place in the sun and

Page 8

proceed to groom herself until her beau-
tiful fur fairly glistened. She would sit
for hours complacently waiting for ad-
miration that Would invariably be di-
rected her way.

Aunt Rosie would then slip quietly
into the basket and take over Lily’s un-
ﬁnished tasks. The kittens would be
polished until they met Aunt Rosie’s
critical inspection; they would be cud-
dled, loved and scolded, while Lily,
from the sidelines, looked on conde-
scendingly, as though. to say: “Look, I
have a nursemaid for my babies.”

Lily, by the time the kittens were
weaned, lost interest in them entirely.
It was as though she reasoned that the
task of training them was one that Aunt
Rosie loved, and since Lily’s interests
were elsewhere, there was no reason to
deprive Aunt Rosie of doing the thing
that gave her such great joy. So, with
clear conscience Lily returned to her
continual grooming and preening. After
this was completed, she would drape
herself fetchingly against a pillow or

chair whose background made an ex—
citing foil for her soft beauty.

The departure of the kittens to the
homes awaiting them stirred Lily mo-
mentarily, but it was Aunt Rosie who
grieved when they were gone, and
searched almost endlessly in quest of
them.

And then, one day, something went
wrong. Lily delivered three healthy,
sturdy little ones—and a small, frail one.
Lily herself seemed listless and showed
no interest in the kittens or in food. And
when she left the basket, turning her
offspring over to Aunt Rosie, she did
not primp and groom herself. Instead
she lay motionless in the sun.

We knew that something was very
wrong. Wrapping her carefully in a
blanket, we took her to the animal hos-
pital. The doctor diagnosed it as a kid-
ney infection, and in spite of antibiotics
and excellent care, Lily did not respond.
In just a week, Lily slipped quietly away.

Somehow we felt that Aunt Rosie
sensed the situation. She spent the time

(constantly with Lily’s babies, and even
when we fed them with doll baby bot-
tles, she hovered near as though to be
sure that we did things right. The care
of the frail one came ﬁrst in Aunt Rosie’s
line of duties. She cuddled it close to
keep it warm; talked to it coaxingly
while we struggled to get nourishment
into it and was careful that the bigger
kittens did not cro‘wd it or injure it in
any way. Then as they thrived and grew,
she watched anxiously to see that the
others did not tease or bother the little
one. The bigger kittens soon learned
that even a playful slap at the frail one
brought a sound cufﬁng and scolding
from Aunt Rosie.

There had never been any problem in
ﬁnding good homes for Lily’s kittens,
but this time it was with reluctance that
we watched them grow, knowing that
it would not be long until Aunt Rosie
would be bereft. Even the frail one had
been promised, and although shy and
timid, it had ﬁlled out and apparently

was on its way to normal kittenhood.

There was something about the rela-
tionship between the smallest kitten and
Aunt Rosie that puzzled us. There was
more than ordinary devotion on Aunt
Rosie’s part. It was evident that this
kitten was far dearer to Aunt Rosie’s
heart than all the others put together.
When Aunt Rosie sunned the family on
the lawn, she let the other kittens gam-
bol about, but when the wee kitten
strayed on unsteady feet, Aunt Rosie
would reach out and pull it gently back
to her side.

It was a beautiful kitten. From some
unknown Silver Persian ancestor it had
inherited long, silken fur. The pretty
little ﬂower face with its delicate shad-
ings reminded us of a pansy and that
is what we named her, hoping that the
family who was eager to claim her would
also see the ﬁtness of the name. Some-
times Aunt Rosie would bring Pansy to
us and lay her at our feet, looking up at
us as though she wished to tell us some-
thing. Pleadingly, she would nudge the
kitten closer to us. We decided that she
was trying to tell us that this one be-
longed to her and please would we let
her keep it?

There was no doubt that she had
spoiled small Pansy dreadfully. The
choicest bits of food were pushed aside
for Pansy and the other kittens quickly

THE NATIONAL HUMANE REVIEW—SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER,

learned that Pansy’s rights and wants
came ahead of theirs.

Giving Pansy away was not going to
be easy. Lily was gone and there would
be no more kittens for Aunt Rosie to
care for and love. Besides that, there
was this special feeling on Aunt Rosie’s
part toward this kitten. We found our-
selves offering one excuse after another
to retain possession of Pansy. She was
still too frail—she was not advanced
enough—she was still dependent upon
Aunt Rosie.

Aunt Rosie did not seem to minl
when the other kittens left. In fact at
times she almost seemed relieved, be-
cause now she could concentrate entirely
upon the care of Pansy. Pansy did not
answer to her name, nor come to us
when we called her. Yet she did not
wander far from Aunt Rosie’s protective
custody. She leaned upon, and seemed
to draw strength from Aunt Rosie, who
in turn showered love upon her.

One Saturday morning as we worked
in the yard, casting an occasional amused
glance at the cats, we were startled when
the kitten suddenly went into a convul-
sion. Quickly we wrapped her in a
blanket and headed the car in the direc-
tion of the animal hospital. By the time
we arrived, Pansy has returned to nor-
malcy, but lay listless in my arms. At
the suggestion of the doctor we left her
there for observation.

Aunt Rosie was watching anxiously
for our return. When she saw that we
did not have Pansy with us she set up
a piteous wailing. For the ﬁrst time in
her healthy life, she refused food that
evening. She paced aimlessly about the
house calling, coaxing, seeking con-
stantly for the baby that she loved. All
through the night we heard her calling.
Poor Aunt Rosie, denied motherhood
herself, and yet she had found such ra-
diant joy and comfort in the offspring
of another.

On Monday evening we went to the
animal hospital to see how Pansy was
and to bring her home if possible. We
chatted with the doctor a moment, and
then almost embarrassed as though
hating very much to tell us, he explained
the results of his examination and ob-
servation.

“We feel sure that the kitten is deaf,”
he said. “Every test that we have given
her points to that.” That explained the

kitten’s lack of response to our calls,
and her indifference to her name.

“In addition,” the doctor went on,
”we know that she has no vision what-
soever in the left eye. The right one
seems quite normal.”

We sat in silence for a few moments.
Poor little Pansy, so beautiful and yet
so handicapped.

“I don’t know how you feel about
this,” the doctor continued, ”but it is
possible under these circumstances that
you would wish to put her to sleep.”

”Put to sleep!” The words startled us.
My husband and I looked at each other
and through our minds the same thought
traveled and the same memories came
to life. Aunt Rosie, protecting this small
one against all others. Aunt Rosie seek-
ing out the things that would bring com-
fort to her baby. Aunt Rosie pacing
restlessly from room to room, calling
and searching for the one that was dear
to her heart.

Suddenly we both knew that there
wasn’t any decision to be made. Aunt
Rosie was not going to be deprived of
her charge. Pansy was going home with
us and there she would remain!

The doctor smiled when we made
known our desire and motioned the at—
tendant to bring Pansy to us. She cud-
dled close in my husband’s arms and
purred a symphony of happiness. The
doctor reached out and laid a gentle
hand upon her and let his ﬁngers slide
softly along the burnished fur. ”She‘s
such a beauty. I’m so glad that you’re
going to keep her.”

Aunt Rosie was sitting on the stoop
as the car rolled to a stop in the drive-
way. She came toward us slowly and
then she saw the kitten in my arms.
With a ﬂying leap she reached my side.
As I put the kitten down upon the grass,
she pulled it close and purred, murmur-
ing endearments all the while.

She sniffed the hospital odor which
still clung‘to Pansy’s fur and then im-
mediately began to bathe her, intent
upon removing every vestige of the
offending scent. We watched for a few
minutes, our hearts gladdened by the
evident joy of both cats at their reunion.

What did it matter if Pansy had but
partial vision and was completely deaf?
Pansy would get along all right, for
Aunt Rosie, with loving willingness,
would be her eyes and ears.

But today no one—not even the horse——
gets hurt! Here's the real story
on how the Movie and TV producers
keep you on the edge of your seat.

HE THEATER was dark, the air tense with excitement.
TOn the screen, a heavily-laden pack horse labored up a

narrow mountain trail. The horse, sure-footed and ex-
perienced as he was, had great difﬁculty in ﬁnding safe
ground. With almost every step, loose rocks broke free and
fell into the canyon below. The animal wanted to stop; the
man had to continue. It was obvious that one misstep would
mean a plunge, hundreds of feet into the snowy depths, to
violent death.

No one was really surprised when it happened, yet the
movie-goers gasped as one. Several women squealed as the
ground broke away and the horse tumbled, head-over-hoofs,
to a sad demise.

Shocking? Well—the horse didn’t mind a bit! After the
fall, he was observed calmly munching oats.

Obviously, the essence of the story is that the horse did
not fall hundreds of feet. In fact, by actual measurement, he
moved less than forty inches during his "fall.” The balance
of the action was achieved by the special effects department,
using miniature tie-ins.

Animals, as actors, are vital to motion pictures and tele-
vision. There are many animal actors—their names would
ﬁll several pages. And they are ”stars” in their own right.

Some animals are capable of doing anything: ”Tom ’n
Jerry,” or ”Mickey Mouse,” for example, where action is
limited only by the animator’s imagination.

Others—the teal animals—seem capable of doing almost
anything. Horses are ”shot,” and they fall; an alligator is
”stabbed” during a life-or-death struggle with a jungle man
and ﬁnally ﬂoats away on his back, his belly covered with
blood; animals "ﬁght”—bear against dog; dog against wolf;
wild horse against man.

The American Humane Association does not condone acts
of brutality, even when they can be depicted without actual
cruelty taking place. In one picture, the story of dog ﬁghting
was vividly told. It was ”acceptable,” because the general
tenor of the ﬁlm was in opposition to the brutality of the
dog pit. AHA representatives were on hand and they know
that there was no abuse, despite the fact that dog ﬁghts did
appear on the screen. At no time was there any physical
contact hetween the clogs in the pit.

But what about that reptile—the one we left "ﬂoating
away, bleeding”? Well, that alligator—his age is estimated
at more than 100 years—has been ”losing ﬁghts,” and ﬂoat-
ing away, “bleeding,” since the ﬁrst jungle picture, many
years ago. He enjoys romping and playing in the water with
anyone who will join him for a refreshing dip, and—talk
about your ham actorslwthis character loves to ﬂop over on

his back after he has been ”stabbed” and smeared with
”blood” from the make-up department.

When those animals ﬁght, almost anything can happen;
but usually it’s the special effects department again. In many
of the more savage-appearing battles, the combatants never
see each other! One side of the ﬁlm is exposed while the
ﬁrst animal goes through his act. Then the second animal
is brought on and the other side of the ﬁlm is exposed. Any-
one watching the ﬁlming, sees two well-trained animals, each
turning in a ﬁne solo performance: yet, when this action is
viewed by a movie audience a brutal battle seems to be taking
place. Hollywood calls it the ”split-screen.”

When the dog and the wolf ﬁght their battle, it’s more
than likely the actors are both dogs, wearing muzzles. A
larger animal, such as a bear, may be a man in disguise. When
the Indian shoots a horse, the animal that topples over is a
trained falling horse. (And the guns, incidentally, are loaded
with quarter— or half-charge blanks, so that the noise will
not frighten or deafen the animals.)

The humane-minded public (and this includes a vast ma
jority of the population) as well as humanitarians per se,
may well point with pride at the situation which exists today
with regard to animal actors. From the humane viewpoint,
it is indeed gratifying to know that animals are not being
abused, injured and killed to provide movie and TV action.
But, the by-product of humane treatment is also worth noting:
animal action is far more entertaining and more elaborate
animal stories are possible when four-footed actors respond
to please the trainers they love instead of through fear of
the brutal whip.

Time was, save a very few notable exceptions, when ani-
mals were nothing more than props or scenery. But these
animals were not actors—and strange things happened.

For this part of the story, we will have to go back to the
depression days of the thirties. Animals were killed, maimed,
mutilated, over-worked, underfed and abused in every con-
ceivable manner to provide the action called for in the movie
scenarios.

The American Humane Associationworked for many
years to correct the situation, but it was not until the late
Richard C. Craven went to Hollywood as the AHA’s ﬁrst
Western Regional Director, that any real progress was made.

The incident which is generally credited with igniting the

fuse came in 1938 and it gradually created a national furor.
One horse was killed and another injured on location in a
midwestern state. Both animals were pushed from a cliff,
high above a lake. Estimates placed the fall at from 40 to
100 feet.

The ﬁrst animal was pushed onto a greased slide: he shot
off into space, fell with four hoofs and hindquarters down,
and in a sitting position descended to his death in a watery
grave. The body was resurrected long enough to retrieve the
saddle which was placed on the second horse. The latter
animal fell close to the side of the cliff and was injured as
he scraped against jutting rocks; he was not killed in the
fall.

Witnesses were few and news of the incident was slow
in getting out. One amateur had taken movies from a dis—
tance; not good pictures, but enough to substantiate a story
which appeared in a small newspaper. A few eye-witnesses
were located. The word started to spread. Humanitarians
were up in arms but their outcries were not solo this time.
The man in the street thought it was ”too bad,” and that
“something should be done about it.” State and federal ofﬁ-
cials registered protest and disgust; the Governor said it
was too bad he had not heard about it before the crew had
left the state and his jurisdiction. The nation’s press took
an editorial stand against such unabashed acts of cruelty.
Apologies were circulated; top ofﬁcials denied knowledge
of the affair; and t/ae AHA wem‘ to Hollywood.

Falling horses were—and still are—important to some
movie scenes. Certainly, the AHA could not tell producers
to eliminate the falls, but it could say with emphasis that the
Running W (photo on page 10 from AHA ﬁles) would not
be tolerated.

The Running W was a system of wires, which yanked the
front feet from under the animal while it was racing at high
speed—forcing his thousand pounds of body weight to crash
to the ground. This cruel device frequently brought injury
and often caused death to the horse.

The American Humane Association did not want to be
cast in the role of censor; w/mz‘ went onto the ﬁlm was of no
direct concern—it was how that mattered.

In 1940, there was written into the motion picture code
provision that ”the producer shall consult with the authorized
representative ofThe American Humane AssociatiOn” on
pictures involving animals. It further provided that the AHA
representative "shall be invited” to be present during the
ﬁlming of such animal action.

The AHA does not ofﬁcially ”approve” or ”disapprove”
any motion picture; rather, the Association certiﬁes that ani-
mals appearing in a motion picture or TV shows were han-
dled in a satisfactorily humane manner.

Motion pictures which are to receive the MPAA Code
”seal of approval” must meet AHA standards if animals are
involved.

The television industry has no such code, however most
producers do request—and receive—AHA consultative serv-
ices when animals are being used. Recently, the two major
TV networks, CBS and NBC, both named the AHA as offi-

cial animal treatment consultant.

Canada Goose

Reprinted from The Reader’s Digest, by permimz'mz

By CHARLES T. DRUMMOND

Jane was a Canada goose. Her full
name, Calamity Jane, arose from her
strange and inauspicious birth: she came
into this world on the back seat of an
automobile, born prematurely as the re-
sult of a collision between that vehicle
and a roadside pine.

I had fallen asleep at the wheel while
returning from an expedition on which,
under government permits, we had gath-
ered ﬂooded-out goose eggs. A mael-
strom of ﬂying glass, snow and dirt was
followed by sudden silence; then came
a tiny, insistent ”peep, peep” from the
rear seat. I looked to see a broken egg
and a newly-hatched gosling, still wet.
To shelter it from the freezing tempera-

Jane ﬂourished, and soon graduated

When she wanted attention, she would
peep raucously. But once satisfied——
usually with either warmth or food—-
her protestations turned to the young

of nature’s most charming sounds. With
ﬁerce loyalty she attached herself to my
wife and me. Released from her pen,
she would follow us wherever we went,
a ball of olive-and-yellow fuzz toddling
along on jet-black legs and feet.

When she was half-grown we began
taking her with us about the ranch in
the pick-up truck, letting her graze on
grass while we inspected cattle or fences
or tended to irrigation. Periodically my
wife took Jane for a dip in the stream

ferent species (our place has always

it threw her off and we were able to-

In a moment we glimpsed Jane coming

gabbling in near-hysteria. We took her
in, moved almost to tears by the neck

The Husky Dogs

Of Toklat

THE FAMILIAR SIGHT of Sergeant Preston of the Yukon,
zooming across your television screen would seem incomplete
without a dog sled and its loyal team of Husky dogs. Per-
haps on occasion, while the show is unfolding its dramatic
story, you’ve wondered why the dogs are so expertly and
easily handled—and how they always know what to do.
Perhaps you’ve wondered who trains them and where.

In the high and beautiful Rocky Mountains, 10 miles
south of Aspen, Colorado is the fascinating Toklat Husky
Dog Kennels. Some 90 animals are kept here, eager and
anxious to do work for man.

Stuart Mace, the man responsible for creating this Husky
mecca, welcomes all who visit his kennels with an obvious
love for his animals. .

In stories about the far North, the Husky dog is pictured
as a ﬁerce, belligerent and unruly beast of burden, capable
of turning on his master at any time. This is wholly un-
true, says Mace. The words that most nearly characterize a

Page 14

Husky’s nature are servile, rugged, friendly and faithful.
Instead of being vicious and unruly, the Husky is, if any-
thing, overly friendly and ever eager for love and affection.

Mace’s interest in Husky dogs began quite by accident
during World War II when the United States government
formed a special group of snow climbers in anticipation of
the reinvasion of Norway. Snow vehicles would not do the
needed job—dog sleds would. Mace was put in charge of the
new operation. Although the reinvasion did not materialize,
the sled dogs became operational in carrying supplies to front
line troops in snowy areas.

There were many active sled dogs patrolling the Green-
land sea coast and other cold weather spots at the end of the
war. When the question of what to do with the no-longer
needed animals came up, Mace was granted permission to
purchase several.

Following his discharge, Mace organized the Rocky Moun-
tain Rescue Group in Boulder, Colorado as a hobby. It was

THE NATIONAL HUMANE REVIEVV—SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER, 1958

 

 

 




 

 

 

 

in 1947, after several rescues involving lost persons were
successfully performed, that Mace expanded his dog sled
program and moved to Ashcroft, near Aspen, where he was
able to build his lodge and life around dog teams. (One of
the most dramatic and difficult salvage operations in Colorado
history took place recently in the high country above Ash-
croft. Aided by two dog teams and a snow cat, Mace and a
ﬁve-man crew worked ﬁve days to haul a one-engine plane
down from a ridge where it had cracked up.)

"Toklat” is an Eskimo word for ”high glacial formations.”
Mace has, in the operation of his kennel, held intact the
principles of the arctic tundra areas. During the winter
months dog sled trips over the snowy grounds are a treat
for anyone.

Although a Husky has thick fur and is able to withstand
cold winter weather, this fact is no hindrance to their com-
fort and survival in warm-weather areas. In late spring a
Husky sheds his dense undercoat of fur and can be quite
comfortable through the warm summer months as long as
he has a shady, well-ventilated run and is not worked hard.

The Husky dog prefers to be conﬁned to a speciﬁc area
of land, in individual houses, rather than being caged. The
Toklat Kennels is spread out over a large area; the hillside
dotted with little homes and shade trees. The animals have
a ﬁerce pride in their own home and are anxious for visitors
to "come on up and see me sometime.”

There are three distinct breeds of Husky dogs. The heav-
iest, the Alaskan Malamute, weighs up to 135 pounds. The
Eskimo or Labrador weighs between 65 and 85 pounds and
the light and fast Siberian ranges from 35 pounds to, at the
most, 65 pounds. All three are necessary in a balanced sled
team and each has his particular place in the team.

A Husky is a hard-working dog; sOme inward drive makes
him feel that he I945 to work for man. This explains, in part,
the reason a Husky will ”act” so well.':Their willingness to
please makes them an easily trained animal.

When a team is taken out for any reason—to pull a tour-
ist over the grounds, to act in a film, or merely for exercise
—the other animals show their displeasure at not being se-
lected by pacing in front of their houses or by chewing on
the wooden entranceway to their homes.

Although normally a silent animal (they are so silent that
for the radio version of Sgt. Preston, a tape recording of
German Shepherds had to be used to simulate the passage
of a Husky team) they show their happiness with the world
every morning at dawn and again at dusk by spontaneously
bursting into song. This is not a barking or howling sound,
but a fascinating and melodic rhythm, almost reminding the
listener of a deep-throated male chorus.

Mace’s motion picture work began five years ago when
38 dogs were featured in ”Those Redheads from Seattle,”
an adventure ﬁlm set in the Yukon. Three summers ago he
began working with the Sgt. Preston show. When Husky
dogs are needed in a motion picture or for a television ﬁlm,
Mace will train and supply the animals.

A visit to Toklat is an adventure into a different world.
And in the high mountain country around Toklat, the Husky
is king.

CASE FILES

of a Child Protective Agency

HILD PROTECTIVE Services are a
community’s ﬁrst line of defense in
the bitter struggle to reduce neglect and
delinquency. It plays a major part in this
effort through the use of a "reaching-
out” technique which enables it to bring
help to children and families early
enough to correct conditions which breed
neglect and delinquency. Take for ex-
ample, the case of Donald Little.

Donald was just 12 years old. When
the Children’s Society was called to help
him he was at the police precinct where
he had been brought by an ofﬁcer at-
tached to the juvenile Bureau. Donald
and two other boys were caught stealing
several toy pistols worth about $2 from
a local hardware store.

They were caught red-handed, but
since this was Donald’s ﬁrst offense the
juvenile ofﬁcer called the Children’s
Society to see what could be done to
help him.

As usual in such cases the Children’s
Society worker assigned to the case
searched for the story behind Donald’s
stealing.

Donald never had a father; that is,
he never knew his father. Mr. Little
deserted his family just before Donald
was born.

His mother, an erratic woman, man-
aged to raise him and his older brother
and sister with help from the depart-
ment of welfare through an Aid to De-
pendent Children grant. They lived for
most of Donald’s life in a squalid two-
room furnished apartment.

Some six months before the stealing
episode, Donald’s mother decided she
was fed up with everything. She walked
out on her son and took a sleep-in do-
mestic job at the other end of town.

Donald was left in the care of the
brother and sister who were 20 and 21
years old, respectively. Both worked and
often had their meals out. Donald was
on his own—completely on his own all
day and most nights.

On her one day off each week, the
mother would visit. And although aware
of what little care Donald had she did
nothing to correct the condition.

OR THE FIRST time since Donald

was born his mother was living
under comparative ﬁnancial and emo-
tional security in her new found job.
She lacked the strength, however, to sur-
render this, even though deep down she
knew Donald was the victim of her
selﬁsh behavior.

Deprived all his life of a father’s in-
terest and protection, Donald now also
lacked a mother’s care and love. Left
to his own devices, without any adult
supervision or guidance, feeling un-
loved, unwanted and completely alone,
is it any wonder that Donald was moti-
vated to strike back at the world which
had done so little for him?

It took knowledge and experience to
restore Donald’s faith in people. How
his mother was made to see her behavior
toward Donald in its true perspective
and how ﬁnally and gradually Donald

was helped to gain a sense of security
is tribute to the perseverance and ability
of the Children’s Society social worker.

It would have been simple to ask the
Court to place Donald in an institution.
The mother could have been ordered
by the Court to go back home to look
after Donald.

But would either of these methods
have produced an adjustment based on
real understanding? People who are
ordered to do things respond negatively,
grudgingly and with many reservations.

Through the skilled services of the
qualiﬁed social worker, an adjustment
was made which appears to be perma-
nent. Both Donald and his mother were
helped to see and understand how much
they really need each other. And they
are happy with the new arrangement.

Donald not only has the adult super-
vision he needs, but he has the warm
affection and guidance of a mother
whose own frustrations have been re-
solved with the new-found knowledge
that she is not alone and that her little
boy wants her.

' HE CASE of Bill Franks is another

example of how Child Protective
Services reached a boy before he became
too deeply involved in delinquent be-
havior. As in the case of Donald Little,
the lack of adequate controls and super—

vision at home was responsible for Bill’s
ﬁrst steps toward delinquency.

Had not the Children’s Society been
called when it was, the neglect of Bill
and his two brothers could not have been
halted soon enough to prevent their
getting into serious difﬁculty.

This case illustrates also how frustra-
tions and discouragements, arising out
of misfortune and mismanagement, may
lead parents to irresponsible behavior——
to a state of mind which ignores the
rights and welfare of their children be-

cause of their need to ﬁnd release from

problems too great for them to face.

On a bleak winter night, neighbors
were awakened by the screams of a sick
child in the Franks’ two-room apart-
ment in a run-down tenement house.
They found 10-year-old Bill and two
younger brothers huddled under a torn
blanket on a small bed. The apartment
was cold and dark. The youngest child
was fever-ridden, crying because ”his
belly hurt and he was afraid of the
dark.”

Mrs. Rogers, a kind, motherly neigh-
bor, was about to call a doctor when the
parents came home. They had been
drinking and became furious with the
neighbors for not ”minding their own
business.”

The next morning Mrs. Rogers called
the Children’s Society to ask help for

the Franks boys. She said that what hap-
pened last night had happened before
and it was about time somebody helped
these kids. It made her ”crying mad to
see how those kids were treated.”

What the social worker from the
Children’s Society found was an old and
familiar pattern.

This had been a pretty good family
until Mr. Franks lost his job about six
months earlier. It was then that the

family started to fall apart.

R. FRANKS made a real effort to
ﬁnd other work. He exhausted his
unemployment beneﬁts and used up the
small savings they had put aside to use
for moving to a better apartment.

They were living on money borrowed
from friends and relatives—their rent
was past due—gas and electricity was
shut off—and the local stores had long
ago stopped giving them credit.

Mrs. Franks found temporary work
for a while but the work, became too
much for her because of _a chronic illness.

As so frequently happens, these dis-
couraged, miserable and desperate par-
ents compounded their problems and
difﬁculties by trying to forget them at
the local tavern.

What about Bill?

He began playing hookey from school
because he was ashamed of his shabby,
outgrown clothes. He rebelled against
having to take care of his younger
brothers when his parents were out at
night. He began associating with a teen-
age street gang and as the youngest in
the gang, he felt a constant pressure to
do things that would make the other
boys accept him as an equal.

The result: he was picked up for
shop-lifting at a dime store and was
brought before the Children’s Court as

a delinquent.

The Children’s Society studied the
situation carefully. The Franks were im-
mature and weak parents who collapsed
and failed when pressures became too
great. Essentially they wanted to be good
parents and until the ﬁnancial crisis
arose, they had been doing an acceptable
job as parents.

The important task ahead was to help
tide them over the present emergency.
Then, through counselling and guidance,
to lead them back toward self-respect

I Joe shifted his big body sidewise in
the lawn chair. In that way the sun
didn’t shine directly into his eyes. Funny
how good the sun felt on an August
day, but the breeze from the lake was
cool, almost sharp. That was how it was
in Minnesota; the winters plenty cold,
but the summers were wonderful.

Anyway, he wouldn’t have to worry
about the winters up here any more.
From now on it was Florida for him.
With Mary gone there wasn’t anything
to keep him up in the cold north. His
pension and savings were ample enough
so that he could
wanted to live. He didn’t have a single
tie to anything, except this lake cottage,
and he could always just close it up and
leave it for as long as he desired.

“I found my dog, Joe!” It was the
voice of Jim Hackett whose cottage was
down the beach a bit farther.

”Suzie?” Joe sat up. Silly! Of course
it was Suzie. Jim didn’t have any other
dog.

”Someone found her over in Minne-
tonka Township and turned her in to
the Animal Shelter,” Joe continued.
Then, ”Say, Joe, would you mind driv-
ing me over there to get her? Jan has
our car. Took the kids and went over to
her mother’s to spend the day. They
won’t be back until about six and the
Shelter closes about that time. The kids
would be mighty happy to have Suzie
home for Sunday.”

Joe eased his body out of the chair

and felt in his pocket for his car keys.
uSure,” he said. "I’ll take you over.”

He backed the station wagon onto
the highway. "I sure was glad when
the Shelter called me,” Jim chattered.
”Home doesn’t seem the same without
Suzie.” He paused a moment, then went
on. "Say, Joe, you ought to have a dog.
It would be lots of company for you.
I know you’ve been pretty lonely since
Mary passed away.”

Joe shook his head. "No, Jim, no
dog for me. I’ve been restless since I
lost Mary. I aim to do a lot of traveling
from here on out and I don’t want any-
thing to tie me down. No strings, you
know.”

"A dog is sure a lot of company,
though,” Jim ventured.

Joe nodded. "Yes, we’ve had them
and loved them and cried over them.
But right now I just don’t want any
responsibilities.”

Jim shrugged his shoulders. ”It’s your
business, of course. But I still think
that a man has to have something to
tie to and feel responsible for.”

They drove along in silence. In spite
of the heavy Saturday morning trafﬁc,
it didn’t take long to reach the Shelter.
Joe lumbered along behind Jim and the
attendant as they walked down the lane
between the fenced runways, each of
which almost invariably housed a wist-
ful~eyed occupant who pressed his face
eagerly against the wire and looked up
with pleading eyes. As Jim and Joe

THE NATIONAL HUMANE REVIEW—SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER,

passed, each one settled back to his pac-
ing or silent waiting. Joe felt a lump
in his throat and momentarily wished
he had stayed in the car.

The look in the eyes of those pawns
of fate was enough to melt even the
most hardened heart, he thought.

Suzie’s cage was near the end of the
lane. As they neared it, the attendant
stopped in front of another one and
stopped to pat the head of the mongrel
dog sitting patiently just beyond the
wire.

“Hi, Lucky,” he said kindly, and then
turned to Joe and Jim. “You fellows
probably read about this one. He got
quite a bit of publicity not too long
ago.”
Joe was looking at the dog. The eyes
were big and dark and solemn, follow-
ing every word the attendant spoke.
This, Joe thought, was no ordinary face-
licking dog. He had reserve and dignity
and there was a ﬁerce pride guarding the
fear in his eyes. This dog had suf-
fered. Of that, there was no doubt.

The attendant continued. "One of the
men who works here lives out near
Green Lake. One night when he was
going home he saw something bobbing
around in the water. He thought it was
an animal so he got out of his car to
check. Sure enough, it was Lucky.

"The dog had been beaten until he
was nearly dead, then weighted down
with a brick around his neck. Lucky for
him that Bill just happened to be pass—
ing at that minute. He couldn’t have
held out much longer!

"Our man turned around and rushed
the dog back here. We didn’t give him
one chance in a thousand to pull
through. But the doc just doesn’t give
up and he stayed right with the dog until
he perked up. That’s why we call him
‘Lucky.’ We ﬁgured that the name was
pretty appropriate.”

Joe remembered the story. He’d read
every word of the newspaper story and
had been so furious about it that he had
wished that he could have gotten his
hands on the one who had done it.
Even now Joe boiled inwardly.

He looked down at his clenched ﬁsts.
A fellow who’d do something like that
needed—well, Joe just wished he could
have the privilege of giving him exactly
what he needed!

The attendant was speaking again.

1958




"He's not so lucky right now. At ﬁrst
we had so many offers for him, but we
had to get him well ﬁrst. Now it’s late
in the year with holidays just around
the corner. People have been busy with
vacations and there doesn’t seem to be
much of a market for dogs right now.”
He patted Lucky’s head and sighed.
“We keep them as long as we can and
keep on hoping for each one of them.”

Joe felt Jim’s eyes upon him, but he
looked away. No siree! He wasn’t going
to do it no matter how much he felt
like a heel. He looked at the dog again
and noted that he had stoically resumed
his quiet waiting. For just an instant
though Joe saw panic in his eyes. Then
the head went up, erect in pride. Why,
that fellow had—Joe searched for the
word—ckamcter/ That’s what it was.
Character!

They walked on down to Suzie’s pen.
She was delighted to see them and was
apparently suffering no recriminations
for having chosen to go off on a lone
safari. But Suzie was an Irish Setter,
light-hearted and gay, and expecting
only the best out of life. Jim, patting
her head, offered a dual-barreled com-
ment: ”Seems to me that the luck of the
Irish is greater than that of a certain
dog named Lucky.”

Back home, Joe settled down again
in his chair. The Wind from the lake
seemed a bit chill and from time to
time the clouds, matching Joe’s spirits,
seemed to take on a darker hue.

His mind kept going back to the
Shelter and to Lucky. You had to ad-
mire a dog like that. Intelligence, pride
and dignity were written all over him.
That was the kind of dog any man
would be proud to have—a real he-man
dog!

Joe brought his mind sharply to order.
He wasn’t going to do it. What if every-
one did think he was selﬁsh. He was
free now and he intended to stay that
way. He would give everything he
possessed to have Mary back but since
that was impossible, he wasn’t going
to have any ties to anything. If he had
a dog he’d have to think of food for
it, and in traveling, lots of those motels
wouldn’t take dogs.

Of course, with canned dog food
feeding would be a simple problem and
the station wagon could easily be ﬁxed

so that it would make a comfortable bed
for anyone, even a man.

Traveling could be fun, taking a cot
along and sleeping under the stars as
he had not done since he was a boy.
Under those circumstances, a dog would
be a wonderful companion. Lucky was a
hardy dog. He couldn’t have survived
what he’d been through, otherwise. Poor
thing hadn’t had many breaks, but some-
one would take him. A dog like that
just had to ﬁnd a home.

He dozed a bit, then roused up,

chilled. The wind was really cold. He
glanced at his watch. Four o’clock. Guess
he’d clean up and go into town for
supper and a movie. That was what he
needed—a night in town. He'd been
staying too close to home. He’d been
alone too much, with no one or nothing
to talk to and sometimes a man just
had to have something to talk to. Now,
if he just had Lucky!

No! He wasn’t going to do it. Tie
him down. Maybe he’d start getting

What in the world does electronics
have to do with Friskies Dog Food?

This master control “brain”in a typi-

cal Friskies plant is just' one of the
reasons Why the goodness of Friskies
Meal never varies from package to
package . . . why every morsel is de-
licious, uniform, fully nourishing.
Of course, there is still the human
element, too. A dog can get only as
much nourishment from a Meal as
the manufacturer is Willing to put
into it.

Friskies Meal has only the best of
ingredients in it. ..b1ended in such
a way as to be most palatable to the
dog. All ingredients are precision-
weighed before blending to insure
the right proportions. All are pre-
cooked before the vitamins are
added so that none of their value
are destroyed by heat.
Finally, an anti-oxidant
is added to protect
Friskies Meal from
excessive oxidation.

The resulting product is
one you can feed and

recommend with utmost conﬁdence.
Friskies Meal has the meaty taste
and aroma dogs love. It mixes in—
stantly, never mushes in the bowl.
And it is a complete dog food —— no
supplements of any kind are needed.

Friskies Meal comes in economical
25- and 50-pound bags; also in handy
2-, 5-, 10— and 20-pound sizes. For
variety, feed 6-ﬂavor Friskies Cubes
and horse meat-rich canned Friskies.

Your pictures of the dreadful cattle

While the North Carolina Society for

photographs. At the top of this page is
a prayer which begins uHear our hum-

I would appreciate your letting me

I am so happy that someone was in-
terested in our Blessing of the Animals
enough to inquire about the prayer. It
is an old Russian prayer of many years
ago, long before the new Russia. We
found a copy when we ﬁrst organized
11 years ago and had copies printed.
We have distributed many copies
through the years.

You may be interested to know that
we will have the Blessing again in Oc-

and toward conﬁdence in their ability

to be good parents.

The family was started on the road
back through help with the most press-
ing needs. The department of Welfare
was asked for ﬁnancial assistance. Util-
ities bills were paid and service was re-
newed. Rent was paid up to date and
some new, as well as good, used clothing
was made available for the children.

The sick boy was temporarily hos-
pitalized for treatment of a bronchial
infection and for malnutrition.

Bill was placed on probation by the
Children’s Court. The juvenile proba-
tion ofﬁcer and the social worker from
the Children’s Society agreed to co-op-
erate in their efforts to redirect the boy’s
interest into more constructive activities.

Mr. Franks was encouraged to get
training in refrigeration mechanics, a
ﬁeld which had always interested him,
but he had never felt conﬁdent in his
ability to learn the trade. In the mean-
time he was helped to ﬁnd temporary
work so as to become self-supporting
and not dependent on public relief.

Attention was given to the mother’s
chronic ailment which had been largely
responsible for her failure to live up to

her responsibilities as a mother. She was
directed to an appropriate clinic and
when it was learned a major operation
was needed, she was helped to overcome
her fears and anxieties about it. While
she was hospitalized for surgery, the
Children’s Society brought in a home-
maker who provided day-care for the
children until Mr. Franks came home
from work.

The Children’s Society worker con-
tinued to counsel and guide the family
over about a six month period. During
that time the mother’s health was re-
stored—the father found permanent
employment in the refrigeration business
——and the family moved to a larger and
better apartment.

As for the boys, Bill did well in
school, joined the Scouts and found com-
panionship with a new group of boys in
his new neighborhood. Both he and his
younger brothers went to summer camp
for two weeks with the help of the Chil-
dren’s Society.

Dogs Can ’t Read

As highly intelligent as dogs are
known to be, they can’t read. So "no
trespassing” signs have no meaning for
them. Therefore it is up to the owner
to keep his dog out of trouble.

Suburbia’s dogs seem to be the worst
offenders, says Harry Miller, director
of the Gaines Dog Research Center in
New York. Many owners turn their
dogs out in the morning and rarely see
them for the rest of the day. Meanwhile,
the dog, in all innocence, becomes a
public nuisance by knocking over gar-
bage cans, digging up the neighbors'
shrubbery, soiling lawns or chasing cars.
This leads to hard feelings among the
neighbors.

Persons who don’t want their dogs to
get bad conduct records should ﬁrst see
to it that their own dogs are not al-
lowed to run loose, then act as vigilantes
in calling the attention of other owners
to the misdeeds of their pets. This is a
much better way to cement good neigh-
bor relations than bringing in the law.

Here’s a checklist to keep dogs out
of mischief. 1. Take time to train your
dog. 2. Keep him at home or within the
conﬁnes of your own yard except at
such times when a responsible person
can accompany him. 3. Assign the re-
sponsibility of feeding and walking the
dog to some member of the family in
turn. 4. If there is one available, attend
an obedience training class. 5. Don’t get
a dog unless you are prepared to take
care of it.

BOSWELL’S LIFE OF BOSWELL.
By Evelyn Leavens. Simon and

Once you meet Boswell, you’ll fall
in love with him! Boswell is a dog——
a purebred Philosopher and he tells you
all about the real meaning of theterm
a dog’r life. Evelyn Leavens has been
sketching Boswell since he was a puppy
and her artwork is wonderful. This is
a delightfully illustrated ”fun” book,
just made to be read and reread.

THE CEREBRAL-PALSIED CHILD
(A GUIDE FOR PARENTS.) By
Winthrop M. Phelps, M.D.; Thom-
as W. Hopkins, Ph. D., and Robert
Cousins. Simon and Schuster. $3.95.

A revealing book, not just for par-
ents but for anyone who is just inter-
ested in people. Wonderfully enlight-
ening for those who have always
thought of these children as feeble
minded and unable to respond to train-
ing. Particularly useful for the person
who expects to do work in Humane
Education.

You will learn the true facts of cere-
bral palsy—what it is and why it hap-
pens, the early signs and symptoms, the
types and the physical defects associ-
ated with cerebral palsy. You will be
pleasantly surprised to ﬁnd that you do
not need a pre-medical course to under-
stand the many useful suggestions on
emotional and personality problems,
the problem of the child at home and in
school and the very real problem of the
parents’ attitude and adjustment to the
realization that their child is a victim
of cerebral palsy.

Every cerebral palsied child can im-

Page 26

prove in line with his capabilities,
provided he receives proper physical
training and education. This book
should give parents and teachers a
greater awareness of and a deeper in-
sight into the problems involved in

Here are two books, each centering

THE NATIONAL HUMANE REVIE\‘(/—SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER,

In Paul Errington’s uOf Men and

marsh-dwelling animal societies in the

Middle West, the Far West and the
Southeast. Chapter after chapter leads
us through fascinating lands where liv-
ing things have been forced to adjust
to the changes caused by the coming of
man and his ambition. Here is a book
of memories and philosophy from
which the reader obtains a true and
vivid impression of marsh wildlife.

”A Book of Contemplation” is an
unusual volume of miscellaneous and
random thoughts on the tenets and ta-
boos of mankind, collected by the
author in an attempt to describe what
is good in man and nature. Although
many of the topics covered will force
the reader to pause and give thought,
others will arouse indignation because
of a violent departure from accepted
ideals. This work should be an in-
triguing addition to any library.

And the horse . . .

(Continued from page 12)

As a result, barring a few foreign
ﬁlms or independent productions, it
may be said that the AHA supervises
animal action in virtually 100 per cent
of all U. S. motion pictures and tele-
vision productions.

Mistreatment of animals, even before
AHA went to Hollywood, was never
sadistic: the directors were faced with a
job to do, and they did it to the best of
their ability. If the screenplay called for
a horse to tumble down a cliff, there was
little else for the director to do except
push a horse off a cliff.

Cruelty can also be totally inadvert-
ent. Producers and directors simply are
not, for the most part, animal experts
——even if many are animal lovers.

As a recent example, one lot of very
poor quality feed had been foisted off
on a producer who was ﬁlming action
involving hundreds of animals. The pro-
ducer was completely unaware of the
fact that his animal cast was being fed
inferior quality food, but the AHA rep-
resentative quickly spotted what had
happened. He notiﬁed the producer and
more feed was immediately ordered.

Today AHA representatives work
with producers and directors to help
achieve desired animal action; yet they
are independent agents, employees of
the AHA. They speak for the united
humane movement and they speak for
those ”actors” who cannot speak for
themselves.

The AHA knows no geographical
bounds and offers uniformity of super-
vision and service Wherever ﬁlms or live
shows are produced: at the studio lots in
California; on location anywhere in the
country and even on foreign soil.

There is much more to the story of
the AHA in Hollywood. Work begins
almost as soon as the script is prepared,
long before production begins. When
animals are involved, the AHA Holly-
wood Oﬂice staff reads advance copies
of the script.

This is a dull, time-consuming task—
but it pays big dividends in the long
run. From long experience, AHA su-
pervisors can anticipate trouble. Even on
the printed page, a difﬁcult situation
stands out to their trained eyes as a
ﬂashing electrical sign.

THE NATIONAL

The AHA immediately ﬁles a report
with the producing company, calling
attention to the difﬁcult situations and
suggesting changes. Conferences usually
follow and the trouble spots are altered
before the shooting ever begins.

In the most recent month for which
ﬁgures are available, The American Hu-
mane Association’s Hollywood Ofﬁce
worked a total of 91 days supervising
animal action in 25 television produc-
tions and 5 motion pictures; received 11
scripts for suggestions; participated in
3 conferences to properly program a
large amount of animal action and pre-
viewed 7 motion pictures. The action
supervised was ﬁlmed at California stu-
dios and ranches and on location in
Oregon and Colorado.

So, animal lovers, relax! Those four-
footed "actors” receive the best of care.

Recently, a well-known star—the two-
legged kind—sweltering under the blaz-
ing sun on a desert location, mopped the
sweat from his brow and glanced toward

 

an air-conditioned trailer. Inside, the
animal star of the picture was relaxing
in cool, air-conditioned comfort—wnot
due back before the cameras until late
afternoon, when the temperatures had
started to drop.

There was a call for a re-take. The
two~legged star sighed, looked longingly
at the animal’s trailer and slowly rose
to his feet.

”You talk about leading a dog’s life,”
he commented to a companion.

”Yeah. Isn’t it wonderful?” came the
reply. "Too bad we’re just people!”

Humane Act
Winner N omed

The winner of the 1958 AVMA Hu-
mane Act Award is Grace Elizabeth
Fainelli, Schenectady, New York.

Dr. W. A. Young (former director
of the AHA Hollywood Ofﬁce,) chair-
man of the committee on the Humane
Act Award, given yearly by the Amer-
ican Veterinary Medical Association,
said:

”This girl impresses me as being one
who personiﬁes that something which
we look for each year, but seldom ﬁnd
-——namely, an inate desire to be kind to
all living beasts, birds and animals and
then do something about that feeling
and be helpful to animals in a practical
way throughout the year.”

Phil Giordono said this in his letter
of nomination:

"An outstanding act of kindness to
some animal? I pondered over this word
”act” as there is no singular one in the
few 14 years of this girl whose name I
wish to place for nomination. Hardly a
week goes by that another adventure is
not chalked up in her behalf.

”Finally I thought of one that does
stand out as truly lovable. Walking
through a park last September, she hap-
pened upon ﬁve abandoned duck eggs.
So Grace brought home ﬁve ducks-to-
be; placed them in a basket lined with
wool; turned a lamp on and proceeded
to hatch them. She read and learned that
hatching ducks is a 31-day affair. So,
with the hatching of the ﬁve baby duck-
lings another act of kindness had been
born. But then I guess happenings of
all animal sorts will always comprise
Grace’s daily living.”

_ The Humane Act Award was estab-
‘ lished in 1944 to be given in recognition
of some outstanding act or work in be—
half of kindness to animals, not neces-
sarily a rescue, by a boy or girl not

‘MRS. JOHN DEAN, SR.

It was with deep sorrow that The Amer~
i‘can Humane Association learned of the
death of Carrie Slaughter Dean, 75, on
August 7, 1958 in Dallas, Texas.

Mrs. Dean for many years had symbolized
the spirit of humanitarianism toward chil-
dren. She ﬁrmly believed that neglected and
dependent children from broken homes
should never be conﬁned in a' detention facility for delinquent children.
In response to a plea that there should be adequate provisions made for
those children, Mrs. Dean designed and planned the Dean Memorial
Home for Children in memory of her husband and her son. It was

Canada "Goose

(Continued from page 13)

Within a few days Jane was ﬂying
alongside the truck wherever we went,
honking and gabbling co'mpanionably.
About 15 miles an hour seemed to suit
her best. .

We let her ﬂy freely through the
summer, but as the' shooting season drew
near we decided Jane would be safer in
the enclosure with the- other birds. So
we clipped her right wing and, one eve-
ning feeding period, walked her down
to the duck-and-goose pond. Seeing the
others, she clung to us like a child
being taken to school for the ﬁrst time.
When I picked her up and threw her
over the wire mesh fence, she paced
back and forth, trying to get back to
her human friends. 7

Ultimately she settled down content-
edly with the other Canada geese, and
spent the winter with them. But she was
always the ﬁrst to greet us at feeding
time, and she never gave up honking
disconsolately as we climbed the hill to-
ward her former home.

The next spring an especially large
wild Canada gander began to light daily
in the marsh, clearly interested in some-
thing within the fenced area. A lordly
chap, he was at first content to stalk the
marsh and honk in stentorian tones.
Then one day we spotted him inside the
three-acre enclosure, sitting with an-
other goose. His companion was Jane!
Although she was really too young, by
Canada goose standards, for the honor
and responsibility, her human parents
raised a toast that evening to her some-

what premature marriage.

We spied on the connubial pair
shamefully, ﬁrst with a pair of binoc-
ulars, later moving in for a closeup.
Jane, on the nest, would lower her head
and neck at our approach, but not to
the same extent as a wild. bird. The
gander would withdraw to a far corner,
ﬁxing us with outstretched neck and
beady eye.

Then one afternoon we came upon
both birds sitting together at a distance
from the nest. We had a premonition
of disaster. Sure enough, at the nest-site
we discovered scattered and mangled
eggshells, torn feathers and general di-
shevelment. No bird could have done it;

the gander was more than a match for
any of the feathered tribe. Some predator
must have leapt the fence to break up
the nest. _”Poor Jane!” we exclaimed,
but she eyed us calmly, sitting on one
leg in .philoSophical content.

Jane and "the Vwild One” remained
together—the Canada goose usually
mates for lifemand when Jane’s clipped
wing feathers were shed and replaced,
the gander lured her to far corners of
the ranch. We saw them frequently, and
invariably Jane would gabble and honk
in recognition and waddle toward us.
But the gander‘would sound warnings
and make off in the opposite direction.
Rather than cause domestic difﬁculties,
we went our human way.

With the coming of spring we no-
ticed that Jane was. acting strangely.
After eating grain at the back door, with
the gander looking on disapprovingly
from a distance, she would circle the
house on foot, gazing at it speculatively.

Then one morning at daylight my wife
and I were awakened by the sound of
measured footsteps on the roof.

”What in the world?”
gasped. She jumped from bed and ran

my wife

outside. - .
”It’s Jane!” she called.

That evening, seated in the living
room, we were astonished to see Jane’s
head and neck appear suddenly over the
edge of the roof. Her dark eyes were
directed not at us but at the space unde
the eaves. ‘ ‘

Of course! Her previous nest, fash-
ioned in the duck-and-goose enclosure,
had proved too vulnerable. Now she
was looking for the securest possible
spot, and what could be more secure than
the top of the house in which her people
lived? The idea apparently was not en-
tirely agreeable to "the wild one”; dur-
ing this house-hunting period he stood
at a distance and honked reprovingly,
but his wife merely talked back with
great cheer and conﬁdence.

”If she wants to nest on the roof, why
don’t we ﬁx her a place?” my wife said.
I found a wooden box, stuffed it with

marsh grasses and fastened it at a spot
where two roof lines converged—a site
which would offer maximum protection
from wind and sun. Next morning we
were awakened by honks and gabbles
and by the sound of Jane landing on
the roof. She walked here and there,
gabbling to herself. Suddenly sound and
motion ceased. ”She’s found the box!”
we exclaimed to each other.

After some seconds of silence Jane
ﬂew down to join her mate and gabbled
earnestly with him. This time he rubbed
necks with her, and the pair ﬂew to the
stream for a dip.

Early each day now both geese landed
on the hillside near the house, and the
gander assumed a watchful stance while
Jane ﬂew to the roof, entered her box
and stayed an hour or so. After each visit
I climbed a ladder, found that an egg
had been laid. When there were four,
Jane came for her "confinement.” For
four weeks all we could see of her was
head and part of neck projecting above
the nest-box. The gander spent this pe-
riod half a mile upstream.

There was one daily interruption of
this routine. About mid-morning Jane
would start honking, and immediately,
from half a mile away, would come the
gander’s answer. We learned from ob-
servation that at the same instant he
would start ﬂying. Jane would leave the
nest and ﬂy to the marsh where the two
birds arrived almost simultaneously.
Their meeting was transparently joyful:
they honked and gabbled, rubbed necks
and ”billed” each other in true lover
fashion. Jane then dipped and ﬂapped
in the water. A few minutes of sitting
together while she preened and prinked
concluded the morning’s reunion.

We, meantime, were marking each
day on the calendar. The eggs should
hatch 28 to 30 days from the beginning
of incubation. Jane had to get her babies
from the roof to the ground, a distance
of some 12 feet, and we didn’t want to
miss the event. It is not unusual for
Canada geese to nest in trees, but few
human beings have witnessed the descent
of the ﬂedglings.

At dawn on the morning of the 29th
day we heard Jane honk softly. This was
a break in the usual pattern. Surely it

signified something. I ran out to look,
and there, standing on Jane’s back, was
a mite of a gosling! While I stood watch,
my wife prepared breakfast and we ate
by separate windows. Another baby ap-
peared, and then another. Presently four
goslings were scrambling about in the
nest.

Suddenly Jane stood up and honked,
full voice. The gander answered from
the meadow, and soon he landed only
50 feet from the house. Spying Jane and
his offspring at the roof’s edge, he broke
into redoubled honkings. Jane answered
back. The result was bedlam.

Now Jane ﬂew to the ground, and
both of them walked close to‘the house,
looking up at the babies. These balls of
ﬂuff were running about in some dis-
traction, but it was evident that one of
them was a creature of decision. He
simply walked to the roof’s edge and
jumped off. He hit the ground with no
indication of shock. We realized that his
weight was so slight and his down so
thick that he probably hardly felt. the
impact. He scuttled under his mother’s
body, and that was that.

Three remained. One of them ap-
proached the edge, looked down, drew
back. He did this again and again until
he was inadvertently bumped by one of
the others and he had to go, quite un-
prepared. He hit the ground headﬁrst,
but quickly righted himself and hur-
ried to mama. The third gosling stepped
off purely by mistake. The fourth and
last was a showman. Stepping well back

and pausing dramatically, he made a run
for the precipice and launched himself
into space in a veritable swan dive—head
well up, tiny wings working madly. He
landed well, and walked sedately to join
the family group. A

It was done. Jane turned downhill
and .led for the water. The gander trailed
by several feet. Between them trotted
the four fu22y moppets, single ﬁle. It
was a touching tableau.

We saw Jane and the wild one and
their four youngsters on the lakes fairly
frequently through the summer. Toward
fall, we spied them ﬂying together sev-
eral times. Then the wild geese came in
from the north, and for several months
there were too many birds about to
distinguish our friends.

After the shooting season, Jane did
not reappear. That winter the wild one
came around alone. For a week or so
he sat with head under wing or stood
on some vantage point and honked.
Then one day we discovered his dead
body, unmarked by Violence, not far
from the site of Jane’s original marsh-
land nest.

His death is hard to explain; it is
possible that it was an affair of the
heart. But Jane, we feel sure, came to
grief through her divided personality.
She regarded humans as her friends and
protectors, and may well have ﬂown
within murderous range of a hunter’s
gun.

Since Jane, I have never shot at a
Canada goose.

Bulletin

PUBLISHED BY AMERICAN, HUMAN! ASSOCIATION. DENVER. COLORADO

August, 1967

Rep. Paul G. Rogers (D-Fla.) in the Congressional Record of
August 7, 1967, indicated that he will soon introduce his revised
bill to assure humane care and handling of vertebrates in medical
schools and laboratories.

 

The new legislation -— as the Rogers-McIntyre bills which were
introduced during the last Congressional session -- is designed to
éprovide a most practical approach for the protection of animals in
laboratories. The Rogers-McIntyre bills had the backing of prac-
tically all of the American humane movement.

The preposed Regers bill, once*again, has the broad, general
support of humane organizations. It has been endorsed by our
Animal Legislation Committee and by a significant majority of the
organized American humane movement.

We have worked closely with Rep. Rogers in drafting this new
legislation. For advice and guidance we have called upon many of
our people who are actually familiar with the problems and who are
thoroughly experienced in all phases of humane activity and with
legislative procedures. The consensus is that the new proposed
ROgers bill is a most practical approach for the protection of
animals in laboratoriesiand that it will effectively supplement
public law 89-544 (the "dog dealerw act) which wasppassed last year.

We went on record Some time ago in support of legislation which
would regulate the use of animals during experimentation and re-
-search -— not to hinder or interfere with necessary research —— but
to; 11m1nate unnecessary cruelty to animals during such activity.
The need today is just as great as it was then.

We feel that the new Rogers bill —- if passed and implemented -1
would provide a practical and effective answer commensurate with the

_needs of the age in which we live.

Our Washington representative, Jo V. Morgan, Jr., pointed out
at our National Convention last year that the existing legislation —-
P. L. 89— 544 —- "...does not really meet the needs for the care of
animals within the laboratory. Laboratory standards established
by the U.S. Department of Agriculture "...cannot be enforced under
*the present act," he emphasized.

"To be truthful about it," Morgan told Convention delegates,

(Over, please)

 




(Continued)

"...the research facility doesn't really have to do anything it
doesn't want to."

At our 90th National Convention -— held last October in New
York City -- a resolution was passed reiterating the American
humane movement's "...support of efforts to obtain adequate and
reasonable legislation for the protection and care of animals
used in laboratories throughout the United States..."

THE NEW ROGERS BILL IS THAT TYPE OF REASONABLE LEGISLATION.

This is important legislation, which will mean much for the
welfare and protection of animals.

WE WILL KEEP YOU ADVISED OF PROGRESS, AND ALSO IF (AND WHEN)
TO CONTACT CONGRESSMEN FROM YOUR AREA WHO ARE INVOLVED. At this
time, however, please DO g9: contazt any of your Congressmen with
regard to this matter.

At this writing, :w; new Rogers bill has not been introduced.
However, we think you will be interested in some of tne comments
already introduced into the Congressional Record by Congressman
Rogers. The text is included with this Bulletin for your infor-

mation and guidance.

In other words, the law does not deal
with animals in the laboratory in the
course of experimentation and research.
This is the area which my bill will cover
and which is not covered by Public Law

of the committee when it passed the bill.

ON

(Mr. ROGERS of Florida. asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
“and his remarks and Made extra-
means matter.)

Mr. ROGERS of Florida. Mr. Speaker,
last year, the Congress passed into law
Public Law 89—544, 8. humane animal
care bill which called for regulation gov-
erning the handling, care, and feeding of
animals, but excludes these laboratory
%‘s when they enter the research

This law sets up machinery to inspect
dealers of” animals, their premises, and
in general, is aimed at establishing bet-
ter conditions for animals in dealers’
care.

It is also known as the petnapplng bill
because it makes it a crime to kidnap
someone’s pet.

I supported this bill last year and I
supportjundlng of the law this year.
In fact, because I feel the $300,000 that
the House voted to appropriate for the
enforcement of this law is inadequate, I

 

have previously contacted Senator Sims-'3

3m HOLLAND, of Florida, who is on the
Senate Appropriations Committee, and
asked that he help to provide more ade-
quate funds. The Senate has voted to
appropriate $1,200,000.

garding the area where the law 1 r. Sillilj
does not cover laborabwry r s arch ani-

ﬁnd here is the important part:

The foregoing shall not be construed as

ards for the handling, care. or treatment of
animals during actual research or experi-

mentation by a. research facility as deter-.

mined by such research facility.

Secretary of Agriculture, but would not be
required to be licensed.

Then from section 13 comes this, as to
the intent of the committee:

The important determination of when an

. animal is in actual research so as to be ex-

empt from regulations under the bill is left
to theresearch facility itself. Research or ex-
perimentation is also intended to include the
use of animals as teaching aides in educa-
tional institutions.

The limits of this law are obvious and
the need to correct them are as obvious.
For that reason I clan to introduce a

in
I feel that it will be a reasonable bill
which will gain popular support, both
from the humane interests, as well as the
scientiﬁc and medical community.

Mr. Speaker, I have not introduced this
bill yet. The reason I am commenting
on it at this time is that I feel it is neces-
sary to explain to Members of Congress
and members of humane movements just
What is happening.

For not too long ago a special bulletin
was circulated by the Society for Animal
Protective Legislation completely distort—
ing the intent of the proposed legislation
and my position as well.

Had this been a result of a misunder-
standing on the part of Mrs. Christine
Stevens, who produced this bulletin, it
would have been understandable. In-
stead, it was a deliberate attempt to
wreck a piece of proposed legislation
which would help to ease pain and suf-
fering of laboratory animals.

I am at a loss to explain why someone
who calls herself a defender of humane
treatment for animals would oppose leg-
lslation which would serve this purpose.
Especially when the excerpts which I
ham quoted from Public Law 89-544
p'il ! out; the limits of th at law in addi-
r, 3.3, Mrs. Stevens has proposed no legis-
lation which would deal with this prob—
lem, leading one to believe she would
rather neglect it altogether.

As a result, many of you have received,
letters from members of this group who
have been grievously misinformed as the
result of Mrs. Sbevens' attempt to thwart
humane legislMon for laboratory ani-
mals.

I would like l3. explain the malicious
statements which she has put forth so
that you will knov. , if the occasion arises,
the answer to thrsc distortions.

First, my bill will in no way aiIect any
funds which may be appropriated for
Public Law 89—644. A: I have said, I sup-
port additional furuxls to implement
89—544.

Second; my bill is an extension of
Public Law 89-544. My bill will establish

and Welfare as the administrator of an:
imal care in laboratory research and ex-
perimentation. It will not eliminate any
standards whatsoever from Public Law
89—544. Rather, it continues fo‘rward
where Public Law 89—544 leaves on”.

Because my bill is still being drafted
and because I have had the support of
the genuine humane organizations for
many years inggsupporting various bills
concerning , _ .31 care,-I called a meet-
ing and maile‘ out copies of the pro-
posed bill in draft form. This way, these
leaders in the humane animal commu-
nity could comment on the bill and oﬂer
suggestions as how to better present the
legislation.

Had I tried to undermine another bill,
I would certamly not have used this 'open
forum. Out of respect, I included Mrs.
Stevens. But instead Of reading the draft
I sent, and then attending the meeting
to voice her opposition, she rushed to
spread malicious untruths. '

I have received, and would like to in-
troduce into the RECORD for my col-
leagues’ information, letters of support
from the Humane Society of the United
States and the American Humane Asso-
ciation, two of the Nation’s largest shu-
mane organizations. Both support the
intent and principle of my proposed bill.

I would like to urge my colleagues to
read these and consider my comments
today when and if more letters result
from Mrs. Christine Stevens’ effort to
stop additional humane legislation.

The letters follow:

THE AMERICAN HUMAN]: ASSOCIATION,

Denver, 0010., July 51, 1967.

iHon. PAUL (3. Rooms.

House of Representatives,
Washington, D.C'.

Dun MR. Rooms: I am most appreciativ
of your kindness in sharing with me yo
proposed draft bill to regulate the use
animals in laboratories.

The American Humane Association favo
in principle the proposed Bill. The Bill woul

appear to be a reasonable approach to sup. ‘

plement PL. 89—544 which, although well
designed to protect dogs and cats prior to
delivery to research facilities, contains other
provisions which purport to provide protec-
tion also for animals in laboratories, which
latter provisions, in truth, are unenforce-
able. That provision, inserted in the Act over
the objection of The American Humane Asso-
ciation, now stands as an obstacle to eii’ec-
tive protection of Laboratory Animals. A bill

like your bill would eliminate this road‘

block.
If you see fit to introduce this legislation,
you may be assured of the support of the
American Humane Association.
SincereT,
RUTHERFORD T. PHILLIPS,
Executive Director.

 

THE HUMANE SOCIETY
OF THE UNITED S'rs'rss,
Washington, D.C., August 4, 1967.
Hon. PAUL G. ROGERS,
Congress of the United States,
Washington, DC.

Dun MR. ROGERS: It was a great pleasure
to receive your letter of July 14 enclosing a
draft c0py of proposed new laboratory animal
protective legislation. In our opinion, the
need for such legislation remains critical, and
we are deeply appreciative of your continuing
interest and enorts.

The provisions relating to laboratory ani-
mals in PL. 89—544 are minimal. At most.
they cover only a fraction of the animals in

 

20% Of the laboratories and, then, only for
the period prior to research. Furthermore, we
are advised on good authority that many
laboratories consider the research process to
extend throughout the duration of the ani-
mal’s stay in the laboratory. Thus, the present
law hardly touches the problem of regulatory
legislation for the use of animals in labora-
tories. :

Accordingly, we would welcome the intro-
duction of effective legislation. We endorse
all of the basic principles contained in your
draft proposal and want to assure you of our
cooperation in working out the best bill
possible. ‘

Your eﬂorts are deeply appreciated and
merit the sincerest gratitude of all true hu-
manitarians.

Sincerely yours,
OLIVE! Evans,
President. '

.11EJELD SERVICES EXPANDED

 

The "world’s largest ﬁeld service of
' experts’? was recently expanded with
the forming of The American Humane
’ . Association’s Southern Regional Ser—
vice Council.

ABack in 1960, it became apparent
"budgetary considerations notwith-
standing —— that our limited number
of field consultants could not possibly
keep up with ever-increasing demands
for service from every part of the
nation.

As an experiment, we formed a
”Midwest Service Council” with the
late Clifton E. Johnson of Detroit as
chairman. Council membership in-
cluded humane experts from through—
out the area.

Coast, with George Crosier of Los
Angeles as chairman. Next came the
New England Service Council with
J. Seth Jones of Hartford, Conn. as
chairman. William Sullivan of Buffalo,
N.Y. accepted the post of chairman
for the Mid-Atlantic Service Council.

Today, our regular staff —- assisted
by volunteer members from AHA-
afﬁliated agencies -- provide prompt,
efﬁcient sewce to the humane move-
ment throughout the nation These
ﬁn 10

centuries of combined experience in

individuals represent more .

FOLLOWING AHA INVESTIGATION FIZZLE AFTER

An out-of—state owner .of an Idaho

ranch was ﬁned $300.00and sentenced. '

to 30 days in jail following a cruelty
complaint ﬁled by TheAmerican Hu-
mane Association.

During a routine inspection, our
special representative -—Jack R. Hannah
-- found that cattle were starving to
death on the ranch.

At one point, he counted more
than 100 animals which had died.

cows did not have milk; baby calves '

died of starvation on Idaho ranch.

The cattle lacked sufﬁcient feed and
water. Small calves were dying because
the cows did not have milk for them.
N o veterinary attention had been pro-
vided for any of the animals. Many

animals were too weak to stand or

eat and had to be destroyed.

Applications for AHA materials and
for our guidance in teacl'iing kind-

teachers in every one of the 50 states
and several foreign countries.

Emergency Rehef

July, 1967

ANIMALS, TOO, SUFFERED WHEN RIOTING BROKE OUT lg DETROIT!

The American HDmane Association‘s EMERGENCY ANIMAL RELIEF (E.A.R.)
Department provided prompt assistance upon request from the Michigan
HUmane Society (MHS),in the riot—torn Michigan city.

E.A.R. and MHS moved promptly on a cooperative basis when it
first became apparent that great numbers of animals were victims of
the worst riot in our nation's recent history. MES equipped special
vehicles for service in the riot areas. "EMERGENCY ANIMAL RELIEF"
signs were prominently displayed on the two-way-radio-equipped ambu-
lance°

Staffed by a veterinarian and an assistant, the ambulance moved
through_devastated areas, giving out food for animals at the various
distribution areas set up in the city. Families with.pets were
issued emergency rations -- enough to feed their animals for at least
two or three days. The MHS veterinarian rendered emergency first aid
to injured animals and referred their owners to other veterinarians
or to the MHS clinic. . '

iany animals had been left behind by their owners. As other
E.A.R.—MHS workers moved through the area, they cared for animals
which apparently had been abandoned or lost during the rioting.

A number of people in the Detroit area have offered funds to
assist in this vital effort for animal welfare and public safety.
However, it now appears that more money is needed to help us cover
the costs incurred for E.A.R. activities in Detroit, and to assure
that future emergency services will be available when needed —- in
all disasters, in all areas.

You can help by contributing to The American HUmane Association.

THANK YOU -- on behalf of Those we Serve.

MEMO TC: Members and Friends of The American Humane Association
FROM: Mel L. Morse, Executive Director

SUBJECT: Activity Report No. 7, October, 1955

GRA ND RA PIDS CONVENTION

 

Only a few days remain until the Annual Meeting of The American Humane
Association in Grand Rapids, Michigan - October 31st through November 2nd.
We're hoping to see all of you there. . . The first day will be the Corporate Meet-
ing of the Association with the election and the consideration of By-Law changes.
A program which will be of great help to all humane workers has been arranged
for the second and third day. Experts will be available for group discussion and
individual conference.

LET'S HAVE THE TRUTH

 

A statement in a recent so-called "Urgent Message" is a complete in-
vention and totally untrue. It is declared in this pamphlet that the three new
Directors, Naramore, Perry and Smith, elected at the 1954 meeting in Atlanta,
managed to defeat a resolution at the August 19, 1955 meeting of the AHA. Board

of Directors, ”which proposed removing the Annual Meeting to be held on October
31st of this year fr om Grand Rapids to another place less convenient for most of
the members. ". . . There was no such resolution considered by the Board. . .
Members will have to draw their own conclusions as to the reliability of other
statements!

ABO UT THOSE PROXIES

 

This same "Urgent Message" very carefully avoided reference to something
that did happen at the August 19, 1955 Board Meeting. The majority of the Board
voted to amend the By-Laws to allow members to vote by proxy. This By-Law
Amendment will have to be voted upon by the members at the Corporation Meet-
ing. But. . . the three new Directors, Naramore, Perry and Smith, were the
only Directors voting against the proxy proposal. . . Proxy voting is considered
one of the most democratic procedures possible. . . Some of those who support-
ed these three Directors at Atlanta will be disappointed that these three did not
favor proxy voting. . . You may draw your own conclusions here, also.

 

 

WORD FROM WASHINGTON, D. C.

 

Our September Activity Report mentioned suit filed against the AHA.
Deposition testimony now shows Rogers Stevens, (husband of Mrs. Christine
Stevens, President of the Animal Welfare Institute) Fred Myers and others
discussed arrangements for litigation to be filed against the AHA.

 




-2-

Fred Myers, National Humane Society Executive Director and former
AHA employee has. only recently been associated with humane work. (See
attached reprint of New York World—Telegram for July 19, 1948.) Myers
resigned from New York Central two weeks later. . . Was. free lance writer
until 1951. First experience with humane work was when he joined the AHA.
This also may explain the tactics used at the Atlanta Convention. . . A lot
of people are blushing now!

The first public notice of the candidacy of Flanagan, Lindstrom and
Christine Stevens bears signature of Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Board
as well as other members of National Humane Society.

United States District Court has allowed the filing of AHA's counterclaim
alleging conspiracy to gain control of AHA, its funds and sources of contributions
against the National Humane Society, former AHA employee, Fred Myers and

others. . . Counterclaim seeks restraining orders and damages.

EXPRESSIONS OF SUPPORT

 

The host Convention State - Michigan - sent us. the following Resolution
adopted by the Michigan Federation of Humane Societies at their meeting in
September, 1955.

”BE IT RESOLVED, That the Michigan Federation of

Humane Societies go on record as supporting The Amer—

ican Humane Association in its ideals and future activities

in the humane work of this state, as well as all states, and

to not suffer by any separation of national humane activities. "

We are happy to add this to the very many other such expressions from Societies
and Federations. . .

HUMANE SLA UGHTERING, EMERGENCY ANIMAL RELIEF AND BULLFIGHTING

 

A very important meeting was held recently at the call of The American
Humane Association to discuss several matters of great interest to the Humane
Movement today, including Humane Slaughtering, Emergency Animal Relief and
Bullfighting. . . To the large group attending from all parts of the country, a
background was given on Humane Slaughtering Legislation which was introduced
into the United States Congress by The American Humane Association. . . It
was explained to this Committee Meeting that, upon discovery that the Bill was
facing almost certain defeat because of an unfavorable report from' the Depart-
ment of Agriculture, it was decided not to force the issue to a vote which might
have killed it for the next session of Congress as well as this. Instead, the Bill
was left in Committee so that it would remain alive with a good chance of favor—
able action in the n xt session.

 




_3-

Report given about new cooperative committee which has. been meeting and

is made up of leaders of the Humane Movement and members of the American

IVf ea t In s ti tut e .

The same meeting discussed Emergency Animal Relief . . A review
was made of specific grants and funds: that were given to local societies by
The American Humane Association which alleviated the suffering by providing
care and feed for stricken animals during recent floods in the Northeastern
states. . . Reports. were also made of services offered in the flooded areas
by local societies affiliated with AHA.

Same meeting reports from Committee Niembers made it obvious that
attempts. to introduce bullfighting into this country may be expected to continue,
a determined group apparently is behind the effort, and that the alledged blood—
less Portuguese type of bullfighting is being offered presumably as a ”softening
up" procedure on the American public.

A report was made on the bullfight that was. presented in San Francisco.
Local authorities declined to stop it in advance, but agreed to cooperate in
close supervision of the show. SPCA officers and sheriff's officers were on hand
to make arrests at the first sign of cruelty. There was no cruelty. . . but there
was no show either. It was described as "tame" and a "farce. " The public was
outraged and disgusted. It was such a flop and received such bad notices that
the promoters themselves. cancelled a subsequent showing scheduled for Los
Angeles. . . The San Francisco SPCA hereby showed another way to combat
the bullfight promoters. There is no such thing as. a non—cruel bullfight. With-
out cruelty and preliminary torture of the animals, there [just isn't any fight. . .
We must keep alert to this problem - we can beat it. . .

CALENDAR FOR 1956

 

Just a reminder that those of you who have not ordered your calendars which
will further humane ideals throughout the country should do so as soon as. possible. . .
Use the calendar for your Christmas cards, either as an individual or as a society. .
Use the calendar to thank your contributors. for past help to your Organization.
The calendar can work for you all year long. It is. a wonderful reminder to
friends. . .

Dr. Robert Gesell

Ann Arbor, Michigan

Dear Dr. Gesell:

Thank you very much for your letter of March fifteenth and
for a copy of the note you are sending to the members of the Federation
of American Societies of Experimental Biology. Like everything else
you have written on the subject matter, I wholly agree with every word
of it and I think you are very courageous and should be congratulated
upon the splendid stand you have taken on this issue.

George Thorndike Angell, the great founder of this Society,
when speaking about animal experimentation, said:

” What can our societies do? We know of no reason why physi-
cians and surgeons should be less humane than other citizens.
Some of them, we know, are among the best and noblest of men.
A few words against vivisection from the more eminent would,
in our judgment, do more to stop it than any law we can enact.

I think, therefore, we should call upon them to do all in their
power to stop vivisection, or to confine it within the narrowest
and most merciful limits. Let us ask their counsel and advice;
and, if unscrupulous and unmerciful men of the profession cannot
be otherwise controlled, then let us ask a law which shall be ap—
proved by the more eminent and humane, and ask them to aid us

in enforcing it. "

Mr. Angell wrote the above quotation in 1884, it was printed in'
OUR DUMB ANIMALS, the magazine we have been publishing since 1868,

 




0
Dr. Robert Gesell March 17, 1953

and I am inclined to think the views expressed by Mr. Angell are as sound
today as they were when he wrote them these many years ago.

It is very satisfying to know that you are continuing to speak out
and express your views on this difficult subject. The humane movement in-
deed needs this voice from within which constantly stresses the truth.

With kindest regards,

Sin ely yours,

\
”AM-Ava.”

President

Dear Member:

Jam. a,

In 1946 I wrote the following letter to Dr Carlson pertaining to the National Society of Medical Research, then in

process of organization.
February 8, 1946

Dr. A. J. Carlson
Department of Physiology
University of Chicago
Chicago, Illinois

Dear Doctor Carlson:

My answer to your letter of January 26th is delayed
due to the absence of Dean Furstenberg from the city. I
have spoken to him since his return and he asks me to
tell you that he is in sympathy with the objectives of the
National Commission for the Protection of Medical Sci-
ences. He also has every expectation that the University
will subscribe $300. 00 towards financial support.

You will find enclosed signatures of members of my
department urging financial support of the commission
by our Federation.

If the work of the commission is well doneit will
be a great contribution to the biological sciences for we
need a comprehensive education of all concerned. In
that connection I would like to suggest that the commis-
sion give attention to the education of the men of sci-
ence as well as of the public for in my opinion much of
our trouble originates in our own ranks. I am not one of
those who believe that the conditions of animal experi~
mentation are ideal. I believe the commission could
raise the question whether the experimental animal is
receiving the consideration to which he is entitled par- '
ticularly as regards survival experiments in which the
animal is likely to suffer. It is my experience that
there are always a number of us who may be too sure of
man 's privileges to experiment on the lower forms. Some
system of scrutinizing the soundness of biological prob-
lems and the skill and wisdom and consideration of the
scientist would do much to convince the public that our
minds are open to all sides of the problem. I doubt the

wisdom of a policy which offers no supervision of animal
experimentation whatever. ‘ The surest way of preventing
interference from the outside by enactment of laws re-
stricting experimentation is to convince the public that
we ourselves see the soundness of proper supervision. Our
committee should be best qualified to accept the re—
sponsibility of this supervision.

I will be on the look-out for you at the meetings.

Sincerely yours,

Robert Gesell

Dr. Walter B. Cannon, the late Professor of Physiology
at Harvard, had seen the need of a restraining force to
contain man's curiosity within proper bounds of experi-
mental procedure and as a result of his efforts, labora-
tories throughout the land voluntarily posted a code of
experimental ethics. The fine inﬂuence from which this
movement started was, however, doomed to suffer from
the lack of a continuity of moral supervision.

Burke, the great statesman, saw in continuity of insti--
tutions the best guarantee to their improvement. The
shocking effects that come from total absence of restraint
are revealed in the following article reprinted with the

Letters to the Editor of the Lancet.

SIR,———What amount of suffering is it legitimate to
inﬂict in the course of experiments on animals? The
question has arisen from a study of some. papers
published in recent years and describing Canadian and
American experiments calculated to inﬂict the maid—
mum of injury consistent with the temporary survival
of the animals, which are then studied physiologically.
A special machine has been designed in which un-
anaesthetized rats, with paws bound together, are
dropped 40 times per minute. In one experiment 10
rats were subjected to 700 falls in 17 1.13 minutes and died
on the average 50 minutes later ; another 10 subjected
to 800 falls in 20 minutes died on the average in 47
minutes. The animals were not unconscious. In another
experiment 30 dogs, temporarily anaesthetized, had
their thigh muscl-es‘contused by-700 to 1000 blows with
a light raw-hide mallet on each leg. The anaesthetic
was then at once discontinued ; 25 of the dogs died after
intervals varying from 50 minutes to about 9 hours.
References to the papers, describing these and other
exceptionally painful procedures will be given to
responsible inquirers on request.

We should be the last to underrate the importance of
experiments on animals, but that importance does not
override all other considerations. There must be a limit
to the doctrine that the end justiﬁes the means. The
1912 report of the Royal Commission on Vivisection,
-5 of whose 7 signatories were eminent medical men,
recommended the principle that is now embodied in the
pain rule attached to British vivisection licences : “ If
an animal at any time is found to be suffering severe
pain which is likely to endure, such animal shall forth-
with be painlessly kiiled.” This rule applies even when

  

 

the main object of the experiment has not been
attained.“

We therefore invite'sCientists to assert with us that
treatments of the kind to which we have referred at the
beginning of this letter are to be condemned as shocking
to a normal human conscience. We suggest that in
planning his procedure every experimenter should
earnestly consider whether the inﬂiction of the pain
involved is really justiﬁable in the interests of medicine
or science, and try to devise techniques that will
reduce suffering to a minimum.

SIR,—Despite the attacks of anti-vivisectionists, the
necessity for animal experimentation for the rehef of
human suffering is more and more generally accepted.
The public realises that laboratory experiments per—
formed under licence in this country, after then
desirability has been justiﬁed to the satisfaction of the
appointed medical authorities, are invariably con-
ducted with humanity.

It is because of the trust that has thus been accorded
by the general public that it is incumbent on the
medical profession to refuse to condone, by Silence,
unjustiﬁable inﬂiction of suffering on animals. A serIeS
of experiments have lately been recorded under the
title of Effect of Chronic Fear on the Gastric SecretIOn

of HCl in Dogs. I do not wish at this juncture to

discuss the scientiﬁc validity of the experiments or the

 

  

conclusions drawn, but to call attention to the cruelty

with which they were conducted. .

Seven dogs were used—as a preliminary they were

operated on to render them incapable of barking. The
animals were kept in metal screen cages, and, in the
words of the author, an attempt was made to induce
and maintain a state of chronicfear in the animals by
strong electric Shocks administered to the animals

through specially constructed grids making up the‘

ﬂoor of the cages. Combined with this form of stimula—
t1on was an electric buzzer whichmight act either with
or independently of the shock. The stimulus was

administered by a mechanical device permitting some '

randomisation of the intervals between the stimuli—~-
74 stimulations being administered within each
succeeding twelve-hour period. During the night the
grids were often short-circuited by faeces; otherwise,
the dogs were stimulated at, irregular intervals night
and day. The experimental period lasted six months.

Duringthis period an occasional break of a few days
allmvedt control measurements of HCl secretion to
be performed on the resting animal. Otherwise, the
arrangements for ,arbusing in the dogs a state of
chronic fear . and intermittent .pain for a continuous
period of six months seem to have been effective.

Science and humanity know no frontiers and no—one
who knows the selﬂess devotibn and humanity of our
American colleagues would doubt that a more general
knowledge of these. experiments at present hidden in a
specialised periodical fwould arouSe‘ Widespread indigna-
tion. It would surely in some degree, involve us all in
the dishonour that, Such practices cast on medical.
research were we to ignore them for fear that attention
drawn to them might furnish cornmunition for un-
scrupulous arguments of antievwisectionists.

LEADING ARTICLE from the “LANCET” of 6th August, 1949

Experiments on Animals.

MOST people in. Great Britain regard laboratory‘
experiments on animals as an unpleasant necessity. . , . _ ,
[experiment has been attained, or not. Moreover,

They accept the practice beCause so much good has
come of it ; but theyrhaVe ensured by legislation that
it shall be used as Soaringly as possible, kept in the
hands of those believed .to he humane and responsible,
and safeguarded by legal ‘reStrictions from abuse.
This position has not'been reached by following any
principle to its logical conclusion. Indeed, principles
carried to that extreme, and then used as rules of
conduct, often prove cruel or silly or both. Clearly
it is as wrong to, let a child die unnecessarily of diph-
theria as it is to regard all animals as a lower creation
designed to suffer for the beneﬁt of man. Though
both attitudes can be justiﬁed on principle, both
offend our humanity. We are thus compelled to
treat this like other moral dilemmas, and pick our
way uneasily along a middle course, never wholly at
peace with our conSc'iences, but at least sparing them
the ﬁnal outrage of one gross evil or the other.

Certainly the compromise owes nothing to callous—
ness. As long ago‘ as 1.871 the British Association for
the Advancement. of Science resolved that no experi-
ment which can be. dome under an anaesthetic should
be done without it; that no painful experiment is
justiﬁable for the mere purpose of illustrating a law
or fact already demonstrated (i.e., such experiments
should not be used' inteaching); and that when, to
obtain a new fact, it is necessary to undertake a
painful experiment, every effort should be made to
ensure success, so that pain is not inﬂicted uselessly.
The Cruelty to Animals Act of 1876 was founded on
this outline; it Obligcs' those who wish to conduct
painful experiments, (it “ any procedure. calculated to
interfere with the normal health and comfort of an
animal,” to obtain a licence from the Home Secretary ;

. and abhorrence,

gang it further requires that an animal suffering from '

severe» pain which is likely to endure should forthwith
be painlessly killed, whether the main object of the

there is now a well-grown opinipn‘ among scientists
that animals should not be used 1n,large numbers for

.- painful" experimentspf the facts can be (established

equally well by the uSe of a few. Within tinsirame of
regulations and customs it is possible to limit'painful
experiments to a very small proportion of experiments
as a Whole, and to ensure that the suffering experienced ‘
is not severe or prolonged.

In other Western European countries, and in
America, though most scientists doubtless impose on
themselves the same humane scale of values, there
are not the same stringent legal safeguards. It will
always happen that the tough-minded and the
tender—minded will differ over what constitutes
suffering for others, whether humans or animals, and
there will thus always be a scatter round the mean
of ordinary practice in the conduct of experiments.
But there may also be examples at which the average
laboratory worker and the ordinary citizen alike revolt,
as is shown in our correspondence columns this week.
CHARLES DARWIN held that to inﬂict any pain which
is not absolutely necessary deserves “ detestation
” and all research-workers of integrity
subscribe to this judgment. They know that to
apply the criterion of necessity calls for unremitting
care and attention; but they also know that it can
and must be done. Since the pursuit of a new fact
can sometimes engross the mind almost completely,
they recognise that they must always be on guard;
and that wherever their keenness may have impaired
their sense of proportion they should seek the help and
criticism of colleagues. In the cases cited by our
correspondents the essential criterion was not applied.

More recently a study on drowning of 160 dogs in fresh
water has come to my attention. It describes how these
creatures were strapped to a dog board in the supine posi-
tion, how a specially constructed reservoir, devised to
flood the upper respiratory passages, was affixed to the
neck and how the dogs were then drowned and studied
free of complications of general anaesthesia.

These ominous experiments make us search our souls
and wonder what the future has in store for us, for they
remind us so inescapably of the "Doctors of Infamy, "
(Henry Schuman, New York), who performed terminal
experiments on men and women without the use of an-
aesthesia. They become all the more ominous when it
is taken into consideration that they were performed on
creatures as sentient as man and in a free and happy
country, and not under duress of a harsh government
barbarized by global warfare. In the concentration
camps, atrocities were sanctioned by the command—
ment that "Necessity knows no laws. ” In university
laboratories they are presumably justified by the princi-
ple that " The end justifies the means. " The studies on
the drowning of these dogs were published in a journal
sponsored by the Federation.

These experiments pose a number of difficult questions.
For example, how much infliction of pain and discomfort
on experimental animals are the people prepared to con-
done? What are the limitations, in animal experimenta-
tion, of the principle that the end justifies the means? Is
it wise to endanger the spiritual values of society by cheap
popularization of medical science in pictorial magazines,
thereby creating a callousness towards animal experimen-
tation? Is it a desireable objective to weaken and con-
fuse the humane societies of this country even though
such procedure insures abundant flow of animals into ex-
perimental laboratories?

A recently organized Animal Welfare Institute is at-
tempting to study questions of this nature in the hope
that equitable or at least partial answers will be found.
The broad objectives of the Institute have been stated in
clear, concise and unmistakeable terms. As outlined
in its prospectus, the aim of the Institute will be:

"'"l‘o promore the welfare of all animals.

.‘To reduce the total pain and fear inflicted on ani-
mals by man.

. While the Institute is interested in every phase of ani-
mal welfare, it will, at present, concern itself particu-
larly with‘ humane safeguards in the use of animals for
research and medicine. .

On the urgent problems of laboratory animals, the
Institute will have the following immediate aims:

1. Care: The establishment of a code for the han-
dling and use of a laboratory animals.

2. Research: The encouragement of medical research

of the highest possible quality as opposed
to mere quantity.

Procurement Programs: The survey of existing -and
proposed programs for the procurement
of laboratory animals in an effort to dis-
cover the best possible method Of satis—
fying the needs of humanity in the ad-
vancement of medicine, public health,
agriculture, etc. , without jeopardizing
practical animal welfare work of the
general advancement of humanity through
increasing consideration for all living
creatures. "

 

Though the Institute is less than a year old and though
it has not yet formulated policies of implementation, its
conservative position has been attacked from both sides
with a fanaticism less becoming the medical sciences
than the anti-vivisectionists who are allegedly guided by
sentiment alone.

The Animal Welfare Institute has from the very outset
invited exchange of ideas from all quarters and has re-
ceived helpful suggestions from members of the Federation
and in continuation of the policy of mutual cooperation
the Institute also made formal application for a booth at
the forthcoming meeting of the Federation of American
Societies of Experimental Biology to present the results
of its studies to members who wish such information. The
following two letters will reveal the position which the.
executive committee of the Federation has taken in re-
gard to the Animal Welfare Institute.

FEDERATION OF AMERICAN SOCIETIES FOR EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY

2101 Constitution Avenue Washington 25, D. C.

January 15, 1952

Mrs. Christine Stevens, President
Animal Welfare Institute

730 Fifth Avenue

New York 19, New York

Dear Mrs. Stevens:

I have watched the development of the Animal Wel-
fare Institute with interest and with both some hope and
some misgivings. The hope was that certain portions
of your program, such as the matters of care, housing,
feeding and handling of animals would be emphasized
and made as a cooperative effort with the National So-
ciety for Medical Research. The misgivings were that
such an "on the fence" organization as the Institute might
fall over into the group of foolish, misguided, misan-
thropic, idle, mischievous or mercenary social perverts
who form the so-called antivivesection societies and who
have infiltrated the humane societies to a large extent.

From some conversation with your father, Dr. Gesell.
I had thought that the hopes might be realized. From

the statements made in the release of January 8 from

the New York State Society for Medical Research, how-
ever, I fear that the misgivings were well founded. Cer-
tainly the great majority of experimental biologists and
medical research investigators do not want the counter-
part of the laws and regulations that the English have
imposed, and are entirely behind the Medical Research
Pound Bill pending in the New York State Assembly.

If there is a real and rational place for the Animal
Welfare Institute, it seems to me that it is in close
sympathy and cooperation with such groups as the New
York State Society for Medical Research1 and the Na-
tional Society for Medical Research, and not in the
orbit of the crackpot organizations. For example, ad-
vice and help on matters of laboratory care, housing,
sanitation, feeding and handling of animals are needed.
The methods of killing the enormous numbers of im-
pounded animals by city pounds and by "Humane." So-.
cieties should be investigated. Some of their proce-
dures are ghastly and nauseating and should be changed.
Certainly no biologist would ever countenance such
cruel measures as these groups condone on the part of
their employees. 2 Your Institute could do a real
service in changing these conditions.

I hope that your Institute will consider most care-
fully its program of activities and its basic principles,
and that it will come to have a sense of social re-
sponsibility as keen and as true as that felt by the ex-
perimental biologists who work with living tissues.

Yours sincerely ,

Foornote #1. The New York State Society for
Medical Research like the Federation, refuses to work
in "cooperation" with the Animal Welfare Institute
(see Federation Letter #2). It has officially severed
relations with this organization.

Footnote #2. The drowning of 160 dogs without
anaesthesia would seem to be countenanced by pub~
lication in a journal sponsored by the Federation.

An answer to an immediate request for detailed in-
formation which would help to correct the "ghastly
nauseating procedures" employed by Humane Societies
has up to this date not been received from the Federa-
tion.

2101 Constitution Avenue Washington 25, D. C.

January 25, 1952

Mrs. Christine Stevens, President
Animal Welfare Institute

730 Fifth Avenue

New York 19, New York

Dear Mrs. Stevens:

'At the winter meeting of the Executive Committee
of the Federation on January 22, the request of the Ani-
mal Welfare Institute for exhibit or display space at the
coming Federation meetings, was considered and was
refused. At the same time, invitations to use exhibit
space were extended to certain other groups for present-
ing display material on animal care and experimental
use of animals.

May I say frankly that the reason for refusing your
request was the serious misgiving that the Federation
Executive Committee has regarding the fundamental
attitudes of the Animal Welfare Institute. The Feder-
ation is unequivocal in its points of view and is not in~

_ terested in any compromise position. For example, it

would unreservedly back an animal pound bill in the
New York State Legislature similar to that introduced
last year. It is also entirely opposed to legislation pat-
terned after the present laws in England. The issues
are straightforward; the Federation comprises a large
proportion of investigators who are vitally concerned;
it knows rather precisely what these biologists want and
it knows that these desires are eminently sensible and
Sound.

If the Animal Welfare Institute were to give a clear
demonstration that its interests and activities are in no
way antithetical to ours- -including a vigorous support
of the type of animal pound legislation we favor--then
I am sure we would consider requests in the future for

exhibit opportunities at our meeting.

Yours sincerely,

Here then are three related events:

1. Dr. Carlson, President of the National Society for
Medical Research, expresses his faith in education.
"The National Society for Medical Research was
conceived as an experiment--an experiment in
public education. It was based on the premise and
founded on the belief that public support springs
from public understanding. "

A Professor of Physiology active in the foundation
of the N. S. M. R. expresses the fear that the Ani-
mal Welfare Institute is more of a threat to sci-
ence than the anti-vivisection movement which
appeals only to the crackpots.

3. The Executive Committee of the Federation cate-
gorically denies its members the usual courtesy of
acquaintance with facts by refusing to admit an
educational display by the Animal Welfare Institute.

The dogmatic attitude of our Committee is difficult to
understand in the light of what appears to be a general

 

 

 




agreement on the soundness of the broad objectives of
the Animal Welfare Institute. Dr. Carlson writes me as
of January 15, 1952, "I have copies of the official pub-
lication produced by the Animal Welfare Institute. I
have no quarrel with any of the statements in that publi-
cation, except possibly? that the Institute as described in
that publication is not necessary in our own country--"
In regard to the refusal of an educational boorh it is to
be remembered that the Institute has not formulated,
nor does it wish to announce specific policies without
sufficient study. Unfortunately the impatience engend~
ered by this desire not to arrive at premature conclusions
has led to the circulation of rumors and innuendo. Name
calling has come to the Institute from all sides, the in-
variable experience Of those who try to follow a middle
course, note, e. g. , Federation letter No. 1.

Anti-vivisection societies, on their part, circu-
late wide-spread warnings of a secret ‘alliance'between
Medical Science and the Institute and a SUBTLE mutual
agreement for procurement of living animals for scien-
tific laboratories. In their turn, the N. S. M. R. condi-
tions uninformed minds to issue statements of this kind
in, regard to the Animal Welfare Institute. "It seemed
that the work of the Committee (i. e. the N. S. M. R.)
might be completed in the near future unless new Ob-
jectives were sought. However, this is not the case. It
appears that the oppositiOn--the anti-vivisectionists--
have changed tactics. They are working in more SUBTLE
ways. Their "professionals" are openly claiming to as-
sist medical research, but behind the scenes are trying
to effect restrictive legislation. Information from an
apparently reliable source suggests that some agents of
the Animal Welfare Institute may be following such a
policy. "

The overwhelming and almost irresistable urge to
see only that which meets with the IMMEDIATE atten-
tion is perhaps the greatest imperfection of the mind
and hangs over man, like the sword of Damocles, poised
to cut him down. Spencer expressed this fear when he
' stated that emotions are the master and that the intel—
lect is but the servant of emotions. 'Lord Acton must‘
have sensed. the role of emotions in his famous observa-
tion on corruption of the .mind, for inability to compro-
mise corrupts the mind in direct relation to the power
which is at the disposal of the emotions.

Some years ago, in a personal conversation, un-
related to procurement, Dr. Carlson summarized the
imperfections of the mind, as he saw them in these con-
cise and blunt words, "There is no such thing as an
open mind." Dr. Carlson, of course, meant that the
mind is not open to all sides of a question at any given
time, for as all of us know, it is always open to either
one side or the other in controversial problems. The
tendency of the average mind to lock in one position
and to resist compromise has had regrettable effects on
many of the decisions of man since time immemorial.
And it would appear that bills of animal procurement
are no exception.

Consider for a moment the Illinois Bill No. 490,
1951, for procurement of dogs and cats through city
pounds. The need Of living animals for the advancement
of medical science is sufficiently recognized to promise
success to a bill which gives careful consideration to all
factors concerned; experimental animals, medical sci-
ence, and society in general.

Bill No. 490 reads well for the experimental animal,
medical science, and society, up to sections 9, 10 & 11
and yet it offers nothing more than vague promises as re-
gards the price which the dog & cat must pay to insure a
flow of animals into the scientific laboratories.

Whether by oversight or by intent, section 9 & 11
would virtually abolish humane societies in the State of
Illinois. No one could shelter a stray animal without
running counter to the law. In other words, the N. S. M. R.
wOuld make decency a misdemeanor. Fortunately, for
all concerned, bill No. 490 was greatly modified before
its passage.

DEPARTMENT OF PHYSIOLOGY

Dr. Robert Gesell

Department Of Physiology

University of Michigan Medical School
Ann Arbor, Michigan

Dear Dr. Gesell:

I have your telegram of the 12th. I will be in New
York on several duties the last of this month and I shall
try to contact you either going to or coming from New
York. I will let you know the specific date in time.

I have copies of the official publication produced by
the Animal Welfare Institute. I have no quarrel with
any of the statements in that publication, except pos-
sibly that the institute as described in that publication
is not necessary in our own country because all of our
medical schools and research institutes are just as
strongly in favor of animal welfare as this new in’Stit‘ute.

I have only one direct experience with a man (Chi-
cago attorney) who told several of us here that he was
paid by the institute. This lawyer appeared at our
legislature in Springfield, opposing our hill just like
the anti-vivisectionists who were there opposing our
bill.

Mr. Rohweder, the Executive Secretary of our So-
ciety, now six or seven years Old, founded by and
sponsored by the American Association of Medical
Schools, has proven during these years to be a man of
ability, industry and integrity. This is my judgment,
and I think you will find most of the deans of our some
ninety medical schools will agree with me. Would you
kindly tell me in writing before we meet why you refuse
to meet Mr. Rohweder? Does the Dean of the University}
of Michigan Medical School agree with you on this issue?

I hope you are in good health. You are eleven years
my junioras far as chronological age goes, but I, too,
try to carry on despite my coronary attack a year ago.

Cordially yours,

A. I. Carlson

Dr. A. J. Carlson
Department of Physiology

Chicago 37, Illinois

Dear Doctor Carlson:

First let me tell you how very glad I am that you are
planning to stop off at Ann Arbor on your New York trip.

In regard to Mr. Rohweder it is regrettable to answer
that my desire not to meet with him was dictated by
circumstances. Since I have not met your executive
secretary, I am forced to judge his intentions by past
correspondence, including his circular letter to the
medical schools Of this country. After very careful
consideration it seemed improper to me to offer fur-
ther opportunity for misunderstandings.

On the other hand, I am greatly encouraged that you
have no quarrel with the statements of the Institute, for
should that represent a general feeling there would be
much to gain from a strong support of the Institute by
the Federation. Surely noharm can come from a dupli-
cation of effort in the direction of humanity.

Animal experimentation, in our country is assuming
proportions of a major industry whose very survival will

depend upon sound humanitarian supervision, and you

will find in my letter to you of February 8, 1946 that I
have felt this way for many years.

I have for a long time regarded you as a very humane
person and can only believe that you are not aware of
what is going on about us. Nor can I be frightened by
problems Of procurement of experimental animals.
There is much more to be feared in the harmful effects
of ease of procurement upon quality Of research and
cheapened regard for life. We need only compare the
quality of. English, Swedish and American physiology
to quiet our fears on this score.

The " Chicago attorney" to whom you refer was not
paid by the Institute. But as to the legislation in ques—
tion I could never acquiesce to any move, even though
sponsored by the American Association of Medical
Schools, which would strike a blow at common decency
which would instill a fear of being kind to animals

Dear Member:

The presentation of the first annual Albert Schweitzer Medal and $500 for
an outstanding contribution by a scientist to the reduction of suffering of
laboratory animals will be featured at this year's annual meeting of the Animal
Welfare Institute. You are cordially invited to attend, and to bring any friend
who might be interested.

The meeting will be held in conjunction'with.the Nbeting of Biological
Societies sponsored by the American Institute of Biological Sciences at Michigan
State University, East Lansing, Michigan, September 5-9. The Animal Welfare
Institute will maintain a booth.exhibit displaying the medal all four days, and
the presentation will be made at a ceremony in Room 22, Union Building, at h.30 P.M.
on September 8. Tea will be served following the presentation, and an opportunity
will then be provided for Animal Welfare Institute members to discuss the work of
the past year and to offer suggestions for future activities.

A copy of the fourth annual report of the Institute will be mailed to all
members shortly.

Because many members will be unable to attend the meeting, owing to the fact
that they live at a great distance from East Lansing, we should be very pleased to

receive communications from those who cannot be present.

Sincerely,

PROGRESS TO‘NARD HUMANE SLAUGHTERING OF FOOD ANIMALS

 

Continue the Fight for a Humane Slaughter Law

 

 
 
 
 

The adjournment of Congress without action on HR 8308, S 1497, or any
of the other bills introduced regulating the humane slaughter of food animals,
appears to bring a temporary lull in our battle to obtain a fair deal for food
animals. YOU CAN DO YOUR PART to bring favorable action when the 85th
Congress resumes in January: I

 
   
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
  
   
 
 
 
  
  
 
   
 

1‘. Let your own Congressmen know that you want decent treatment
in the slaughtering of food animals by talking to them personally
when they are home and urging their support of HR 8308 and
S 1497.

2. Near the end of the year, remind your Congressional repre-
sentatives again that you are desirous of seeing a compulsory
humane slaughter law enacted.

Leaders in Congress have indicated a growing support for humane slaugh~
ter legislation and a belief that if the widespread interest continues, such a law
can be passed early in the next session.

 

 

 

Armour Receives "Beef Seal of Approval"

 

Another major step toward nation-wide humane slaughter of food animals
has been made with the announcement from Armour and Company, one of the
nation's largest meat packers, that all beef slaughter, except that done in accord-
ance with established religious practices, is being conducted by acceptable humane
methods. A total of approximately three million cattle per year are now assured
of a more humane death at all thirty—one of Armour's plants across the nation.

  




-2-

The American Humane Association's "beef seal of approval" was award-
ed to Armour and Company at special ceremonies in Chicago on September 17,
1957.

Armour and Company in co-operation with other
packer members of the American Meat Institute-American
Humane Association joint committee on improved methods
of slaughter, has been field testing the new Remington hu-
mane animal stunner for the past year. It has also con-
ducted extensive tests with the Schermer captive bolt pis-
tol and other instruments of that type. Armour's Manager
of Production Control J. W. Rickord is an active member
of the AMI-AHA joint committee, along with other representatives of the humane
interests and the packing industry. He has been in charge of the testing and in-
stallation of the Remington and Schermer stunners in the beef production division
of Armour's many plants.

 

 

“Seal” Goes to Another Packer

 

The Tarpoff Packing Company of Granite City, Illinois has received the
full "seal of approval" of the AHA for using humane methods in the slaughtering
of all types of livestock. Award of the seals to Tarpoff and Armour brings to six
the number of packers throughout the nation who have received approval of humane
slaughtering of one or more species of livestock.

Other Gains

 

George A. Hormel 8: Company, one of the pioneers in the use of humane
methods in the slaughtering of hogs, is now using the humane carbon dioxide im—
mobilizing method on 95. 2% of all hogs slaughtered by that company.

As of mid-September, approximately 9-3/4 million food animals per year
are receiving a more humane death in the plants of the more progressive packers.
This is an increase of about 7-1/2 million animals receiving a more humane hand-
ling since the introduction of the first humane slaughter bill by the AHA in the spring
of 1955. The interest and efforts of members, friends and concerned people through-
out the country have made these gains possible. In two and one half years, real
progress has been made in changing a system which has been relatively unchanged
for a century or more. This is real progress!

CALIFORNIA LEADS WITH ANTI-BULLFIGHT LAW

 

Assembly Bill 3326, introduced by Assemblyman Glenn E. Coolidge of
Santa Cruz has become a law. This puts an end to any threat of "bloodless"

 




-3...

bullfights in California. Governor Goodwin J. Knight signed the bill into law
with pleasure. Prior to the enactment of this legislation, the Governor had
taken positive action to limit so~called "bloodless bullfights" by banning them
from state owned arenas. The enactment into law of AB 3326 now extends the
ban throughout California.

This California law is a model which humane societies and federations
in other states should seek to have enacted. Renewed attempts to popularize
the theme of the bullfight through art, music, drama, decor and advertising
indicates that we are facing a renewed drive which can well lead to attempts to
introduce "bloodless bullfights" in other parts of the country. Passage of state
laws similar to the California law will be effective deterrents.

As we go to press, word has just come to headquarters that a "lady bull-
fighter" will attempt to persuade the City Commission of Miami, Florida to per-
mit her to put on a mock bullfighting exhibition in the Orange Bowl. The Humane
Society of Greater Miami has sent a strong protest to the City Commissioner and
will forcefully oppose any such attempt.

AUGUST STAFF ACTIVITY

 

Headquarters and Field Staff

 

Field Director McKinney visited ten societies in Iowa, Nebraska and
South Dakota during August. In addition, Field Director McKinney and the Execu-
tive Director made inspection visits to seven packing plants which are using humane
methods to make livestock unconscious before slaughter.

Director Vincent DeFrancis of the Children's Division completed his Consul-
tation visit to the Hennepin County, Minnesota, Department of Welfare and prepared
and mailed 4, 000 pamphlets on child protective services to county welfare depart-
ments and other agencies. The headquarters staff processed 20, 931 pieces of cor—
respondence during August and shipped 2, 136 pamphlets, films, posters and other
material aids to 66 individuals and organizations.

Hollywood Office

 

August was one of the busiest months of the year for the staff of the Holly-
wood Office. Motion picture inspectors worked a total of 170 days supervising the
animal action in 36 motion pictures, 23 of which were being made for television
viewing. One inspector was busy in Utah for the entire month, approximately

 




-4-

half of the time on a theatre motion picture and the other half on a television
series. Another inspector supervised one picture for 10 days on location in
Oregon. The balance of the work was in California on studio ranches and

studio lots. Consultation on 12 scripts for new motion pictures and 5 confer-
ences on miscellaneous matters, relating to the use of animals in motion pic-
tures and on television, and the» previewing of 9 finished pictures completed the
activities of Western Regional Director Young and his staff. All of the completed

motion pictures received the approval of the Motion Picture Association Code Ad-
ministration and were supervised by AHA inspectors.

TO: Members and Friends of The American Humane Association

AHA SEAL OF APPROVAL TO BE A‘NARDED ON PRODUCT BASIS

A meeting of the Joint Committee on Improved Methods of Slaughtering of
The American Humane Association and the American Meat Institute was held May
2 in Chicago. Committee members were heartened and encouraged by reports on
new refinements in humane slaughter methods and instruments, and projected plans
for further testing of them in the field.

As we go to press, there has been no further action, either favorable or

unfavorable, on the humane slaughter bills pending before the House and Senate I
agriculture committees. Action on these bills may take place at any time while
this Congress is in session. You can help to speed consideration of these meas~
ures by urging your own United States senators and representatives to request
that the committees vote upon a compulsory humane slaughter bill.

With the good news that a number of meat packers are using 100% humane
slaughter on one or more species of animal, or in the manufacture of one or more
specific meat products, the committee on standards for humane slaughtering of the
AHA has agreed to award the AHA "seal of approval" to those packers on a species
or product basis. Several major packers are expected to qualify for the seal very
shortly, by their use of humane methods on all beef animals, all pork animals, etc.

ANIMAL SEIZ URE LEGISLATION

 

An animal seizure bill somewhat altered by amendments, has been passed
by both houses of the Ohio legislature and is expected to become law shortly.

A similar bill introduced into the Florida legislature this year was so suc-
cessfully opposed, immediately after its introduction, that the sponsor withdrew

the bill.

Animal seizure legislation introduced into the Pennsylvania legislature
has remained in committee, and members of the Assembly continue to show little

interest in it.

 




With the l957 state legislative sessions having ended or fast approaching
the closing hour, it appears that, out of four such bills initiated, two have been
successfully Opposed and two have become law. In the past ten years, there has
been an intensified effort to force surrender by law of stray animals for experi-
mental purposes. Among the scores of bills which have been introduced, how-
ever, only seven have been enacted into law. The American Humane Association
continues to urge local humane societies to Oppose passage of all animal procure-
ment bills. It firmly maintains that all animals coming into the possession of
humane societies or public pounds should be disposed of through return to their
ownerS,p1acement in suitable homes, or by humane destruction.

MAY STAFF ACTIVITY

 

Children' s Division

 

Highlight in the Children's Division last month was the division's partic-
ipation in the National Conference on Social Welfare in Philadelphia, May 19 - 24.
Two conference programs sponsored by the AHA Children's Division - ”National
Trends in Protective Services for Children“ and ”Legislation for Child Protective
Services" - were well attended and enthusiastically received. The AHA booth in
the exhibit hall was busy throughout the conference and provided ample Opportunity
for interpreting children's protective services as a vital foundation stone in the
Nation's social welfare structure.

The U. S. House of Representatives subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency
held hearings in Philadelphia, concurrent with the conference, and Vincent DeFrancis ,
Director of the AHA Children's Division was invited to submit testimony for the AHA.
DeFrancis’ statement has been distributed to members of the subcommittee, to five
United States senators and five other congressmen who have shown interest in ju-
venile delinquency and who have introduced bills on the subject, and to the forty—
eight directors of children's senses. in the various states. The testimony points
out the value of child protective StMCLn as a preventive measure in dealing with
juvenile delinquency.

Field and Headquarters Staff

 

Sixty-four humane societies and five mimicipal animal shelters received
assistance during May from members of the AHA field department and headquart—
ers staff. Field directors Waldo h’icKiI’iney, Herbert Martin and James Jack, Jr. ,
and other staff members visited shelters and met with directors of societies in
Maine, Vermont, Pennsylvania, lviaryland, the District of Columbia, Florida,
Mississippi, Michigan, Illinois, Endiana, “Wyoming and California.

 




Director of Field Service G. W. Rogers attended the Midwest Humane
Conference in Carthage, Missouri, May 117 and 18, and led discussions at the
41 st shelter workers conference held in Rochester, New York, May 24 and
25. Field directors McKinney and Jack assisted at the Rochester conference
which featured a report on livestock problems by John Macfarlane, director
of the Livestock Conservation Department of the Massachusetts SPCA.

Executive Director R. T. Phillips made seven special field visits on
legal, management and fund raising problems, in addition to participating v
in the May 2nd meeting of the Joint Committee on Improved Methods of Slaughter-
ing of the AHA and the AMI, held in Chicago.

A total of 12, 064 pieces of correspondence went out of the Denver office
during May, and 27, Z53 pamphlets and other material aids were requested
and shipped to 155 organizations and individuals.

Hollywood Office

 

AHA motion picture inspectors worked a total of 106 days during May,
supervising animal action in 31 motion pictures, 20 of which were for television
Viewing. The animal action was filmed on studio lots, California ranches, in
Carson City, Nevada, and in Kanab, Utah. Reading of 14 motion picture scripts,
previewing of l8 completed pictures, and participation in 12 conferences, meet— A
ings and television programs in connection with BKA Week, kept Western Region-
al Director W. A. Young and the inspectors very busy during the past month.

Three of the pictures previewed, "Tip On A Dead Jockey, " “Devil's
Hairpin" and "The Pride and the Passion, ” contained footage made abroad,
which was not supervised by the AHA. "Perri" contains scenes of animals in
their natural day-to—day living. The other l4 films, which received motion
picture association code administration approval, were supervised by AHA

rim

inspectors.

OVEN-COOKED VEGETABLES

 

Since this is the season when we do use
our ovens a lot for roasting turkey,
meat, etc. - have you ever tried cooking
vegetables in a casserole in the oven at
the same time?

You can get just as good results this way
and also save fuel and time. You save by
not having to watch the vegetables while
they cook.

To oven-steam vegetables in a casserole, you, first of all, place pared vege-
tables in the casserole dish. The vegetables may be either cut or whole.
Then, season and add a small amount of water. Cover the dish and bake at a
moderate temperature. If you are preparing an “oven meal", the covered dish
of vegetables can be baked with the other baked dishes.

This method takes three times as long as boiling. But, also all preparation
can probably be made at one time and so gives the cook some free time from
the kitchen while the vegetables are oven—steaming. '

Thought For The Day - For this special holiday season, here is one of my fa-
vorite short Christmas stories -

 

THE DOG AND THE STAR

He was a small dog, of no particular breed and no remarkable beauty. He was
cold and today walked lame from the weariness of his journey. His name was
”Beat IT". At least that was what everyone said to him, but he did not belong
to anyone. Except for those few weeks in the Spring when he lived with his
mother in the packing box where he was born, he had been alone. He missed his
mother at first, he searched the alleys and streets whimpering for days. But
soon the problems of eating and finding shelter and dodging kicks drove her
from his mind.

'When it began to grow cold "Beat IT” became restless; a strange loneliness
gripped his heart. There was an urge to move on, to see that which he knew
not, when lol he heard about “The Star."

Two urchins talked of it at first, but all that the little dog understood was
that in a few days a wonderful transformation would take place, so that each
man would love his neighbor and show a kindliness of spirit that was hidden at
other times.

There WOUld be Singing and great giving of gifts. And the symbol of it all
would be the ”Star”. ”Beat IT” was not sure when the Star would shine to let
all living things know the Day had come, or had it shone long ago and was
remembered now because it once marked a slender moment of Earth's happiness.
There was no one to tell him, so ”Beat IT” knew that he would have to find
the Star himself, or else the wonderful time would pass without his knowing
it had ever been seen.

In the city the buildings hid the sky, and in the country, no star shone so
brightly, so warmly, that the dog could say:
“This is the one!” So on he walked, along
the open roads, across the fields, through
hamlets along his way. He slept by day, and
walked by night, searching the sky for the
light which would tell him the Day had come.
Had it not been for the voices he might have
given up. The wind, the leaves, the grasaﬁg
the trees, all whispered to him, ”Go on, go
on, and find the Star.” And on he went,
footsore, bedraggled, coat matted with mud
and burrs, his brown eyes on the night sky
and the urgent voices in his ears.

Now it was a colder night than he had ever

known, and then itbegan to snow. There were

no stars overhead at all. Exhaustion filled

his limbs, cold wrapped about his Hﬁn.little

body. Suddenly the urging voices stopped;

the gales still blew, but "Beat IT" no long—

er heard the words ”Go on!” This new silence

frightened him; he felt so alone and lost.

The cold and weariness were more than he could bear. Just off the road a light
filtered dimly through the snow. Limping towards it he dragged himself into a
corner out of the freezing snow—swept night. He fell asleep.

In the pale, cold dawn of a new day he was awakened by the sound of sobbing. A
little boy was filling a woodbox from a pile of logs and sobbing into the frosty
air. "Beat IT" had always fled from humans, especially did he recall the sharp
pain of stones thrown by small boys. But now he was not afraid. Curiosity and
a warm unknown emotion flooded his small frame. He gathered his stiff, sore
muscles and stood up. He shook himself and barked. The sobs broke off in a
gasp; then tentatively at first, the boy stretched forth his hand and rested it
on the bedraggled head. It was the first time he had ever been touched with

tenderness and love. His tail wagged wildly;
his pink tongue darted over the grubby hand;

his heart was filled.with a bursting ecstasy.
The dog was suddenly gathered into two young

arms.

Two swift feet dashed through the snow and
carried the dog and boy into the little house.

"Oh, mother, Santa did come — he didn't for-

get me after all! He brought me a dog, a

dog with funny ears and a long tail. Only
Santa made a mistake and left him in the shed instead of the house." The tired
face of the woman standing in the kitchen was startled, dubious, then it soft-
ened. The boy was quick torkme the relenting. "I can keep him, mother, can't
I? He won‘t eat much. Oh, see how little he is! and I'll clean him up and
brush him, and we'll have such good times together! And he likes me, mother,
truly he does! I'll call him."Merry”, because its such a Merry Christmas."
"All he'll get will be scraps." Her tone was grudging, but the look on her
face was a prayer of thanks for a little boy saved from Christmas heartbreak.
"Looks awful tired to me" she said. "Of course, mother! Its a long way from
the North.Pole in Santa's sled." Her worn, rough hand was gentle as it touch-
ed the dog's bruised paws. "He must have done most of the pulling. 'Well, '
he's probably hungry; I'll see what I can find.

She disappeared through the pantry door. "Beat IT" put his head on the little
boy's knee and gazed up into eyes in which reflected the warm, bright brilli-
ance of THE STAR.

Bullﬁghts Stopped
In Mo. and Ind.

All over the United States there is a mount-
ing campaign to induce the public to accept
bullﬁghting as a sport and as an “art.” The
National Humane Society and many other hu-
mane organizations are vigorously opposing
every piece of the propaganda that comes to
their attention. In several places the National
Humane Society and other humane organiza-
tions have forced cancellation of so-called
Portuguese bullﬁghts.

The “Portuguese” bullﬁght is different from
the usual gory bullﬁght only in that “pics”
and lances are not used and the bull is not
killed in the ring. The hull is taunted and
harassed into a fury by matadors with capes.
Horses, the bull and the men often are in-
jured but promoters make much of calling
their event a “bloodless” ﬁght. Promoters of
the Portuguese—style ﬁghts admit, privately,
that they hope that the modiﬁed bullﬁghts will
prepare the American public for acceptance
of “the real thing.”

Difﬁculties of preventing presentation of the
Portuguese ﬁghts were exempliﬁed recently in
Indiana. The National Humane Society, the
South Bend Humane Society and the Fort
Wayne SPCA joined forces in efforts to stop
scheduled bullﬁghts in Fort Wayne and South
Bend. One advertised ﬁght was cancelled as
a result of the pressure but two were presented
as scheduled, one in Fort Wayne and one in
South Bend. Another ﬁght was presented in
Indianapolis.

Larry Andrews, NHS Director of Field Serv-
ice, tempOrarily left ﬁeld work that he was
doing for humane societies in Illinois to lead
the battle against the bullfights in South Bend.
National headquarters of the NHS bombarded
the Governor and Attorney General of Indiana
with protests and tried through NHS counsel
to ﬁnd a means, under Indiana law, of stop-
ping the bullﬁghts.

Although Indiana law clearly prohibits the
baiting or tormenting of an animal, the Indi-
ana Attorney General ruled that no legal action
could be taken unless an animal were actually
injured.

The combined efforts of the South Bend
Humane Society and The National Humane
Society, however, induced the promoter to

Chances Good for Humane

Slaughter Law This Winter

The biggest and most aggressive drive for
legislation ever organized by the American
humane movement is being mobilized for an
all-out effort to persuade Congress to enact a
law requiring humane methods of killing meat
animals. Leaders of the big campaign, in-
cluding Senator Hubert Humphrey of Minne-
sota, Representative Edgar W. Hiestand of
California and Representative Martha Grifﬁths
of Michigan, are optimistic about chances of
ending, in next winter’s Congressional session,
one of America’s most atrocious cruelties.

Composition of a National Committee for
Humane Slaughter, now being organized by
The National Humane Society, will be an-
nounced soon. The National Committee for
Humane Slaughter is expected to organize
local committees in major communities
throughout the country. These committees
will concentrate on informing the public about
existing cruelties in slaughter houses, on or-
ganizing pressure for reform among meat buy-
ers and livestock producers, and on informing
Congressmen of public demand for humane
slaughter.

Three bills requiring humane anaesthetiza-
tion or stunning of animals before they are
shackled, hoisted or cut are. pending, in Con-
gress and ready for action in the session that
will open January 3. These bills, S. 1636,
HR. 7672 and H.R. 6099, may be amended
before being acted upon. Other bills may be
introduced. Many humanitarians and some
Senators and Representatives have expressed
the opinion that the original bills, S. 1636 and

HR. 6099, give slaughterers unnecessary lee-
way. Both bills allow ﬁve years for reform,
and permit the Secretary of Agriculture to ex-
tend that time. H.R. 7672 would compel im-
mediate action.

The Department of Agriculture opposes any
kind of humane slaughter law. The reason
given is that “the Department” believes that
industry should be left to work out such prob-

NHS Board Acts Again

Directors of the National Humane So-
ciety have authorized employment of spe-
cial legal counsel, if necessary, to get the
protection of Federal laws for the thou-
sands of monkeys being imported every
month from India and the Philippines for
production of polio vaccine and for other
laboratories and pet shops. The NHS Di-
rectors acted at a special meeting in Chi-
cago on July 16.

Atrociously cruel conditions under which

 

'monkeys were being imported six months

ago have been greatly improved but many
monkeys still are being shipped in badly
over-crowded crates, Without food or water,
and in crates so badly constructed that they
maim and bruise the animals.

Some airlines and some importers are re-

Enclosed is a money order donation to the National Humane Society. This is my

NIXON HELPS

NHS CAMPAIGN

Vice-President Nixon took time out from the feverish closing days of the Senate sessmn
to help the National Humane Society persuade motorists to "Give Wildlife a Brake."

Delos E. Culver (left) a Director of the NHS and President of Defenders of Furbearers,
told the Vice-President about the NHS campaign to save some of the 300 million animals
and birds that every year are killed by automobiles. Mr. Nixon himself tacked up, in
the reception room of the Senate, the first of 100,000 brilliant red, white and black posters
that are being posted along highways by Scout troops, sportsmen's clubs, and conser-

handled.

Inspectors of the U.S. Customs Bureau
continue to take a very tolerant view of
over-crowding, of lack of food and water,
and of rough handling. The Customs Bu-
reau is charged by law with responsibility
for enforcing humane standards in impor—
tation of animals.

Despite difﬁculties, the National Humane
Society continues to inspect as many incom-
ing shipments as possible and is cooperating
with humane societies in India and in the
Philippines. Reports of monkeys in cruel
condition are passed on to importers, air-
lines, and the Customs Bureau.

The background of the need for vigorous
action to protect the monkeys is shown by
condition of a shipment of 900 Rhesus mon-
keys that arrived at Idlewild airport, in New
York, on February 8. The shipment came
in on a Seaboard & Western plane, con-

signed to the Parke Davis pharmaceutical
plant at Detroit. The monkeys were to go
on to Detroit by truck.

The animals were in wooden crates, with
wire tops and fronts. Crates measured 17
x 18 x 35 inches. Some crates contained as
many as 20 monkeys and most crates had
18. The NHS inspector saw 12 dead mon~
keys in the crates, 3 monkeys acutely ill,
and one near death. Several pregnant fe-
males had aborted in ﬂight. All the mon—
keys were covered with their own ﬁlth. The
shipment had been eight days in transit and
an attendant said that “forty or ﬁfty” mon-
keys had died on route.

The Government of India temporarily em-
bargoed shipments of monkeys as a result of
such cruelties and there was a consequent
sharp improvement. Cages were improved
and fewer monkeys shipped in each cage.
Airlines began giving most of the monkeys
a rest period at a Royal SPCA hospice in
England.

A report on another shipment in June will
show, however, that some shippers and air-
lines continued to do as little for the mon-
keys as possible.

This shipment, of 879 monkeys, left New
Delhi June 9. It arrived on a Seaboard &

Western plane June 14. The National Foun-
dation for Infantile Paralysis was the con-
signee. Cages were 18 X 35 x 17 inches.
There! were six dead monkeys in the crates,
one dying, several ill. Most crates held 12
monkeys. Many animals had a skin disease.

A Customs Bureau inspector arrived some
time after the monkeys had been unloaded.
He stood some distance from the crates,
joked with a representative of the National
Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, and de-
parted without comment on the condition of
the monkeys.

Another shipment of 120 monkeys, 15 in
each cage (22 x 28 x 20 inches,) arrived
June 19 by Pan American World Airways
from Cebu City, P. I. The shipment was
destined for Shamrock Farms, Spring Valley,
N. Y. Food trays were empty. There were
no water troughs. The Pan American cargo
man at the airport said that “they never
water the animals.” A Customs inspector
told the NHS inspector that be checked
only to “see that they are all there,” not on
inhumane conditions. The monkeys had to
sit on wire of one-inch square mesh.

After the NHS sent a report on this and
other Pan American shipments to the Com-
missioner of Customs, in Washington, Pan
American barred any NHS representative
from its area at the San Francisco airport.

Pan American officers told Fred Myers, Exe-
cutive Director of the National Humane So-
ciety, that Pan American had barred the NHS
inspector after consulting with Mel Morse,
Executive Director of the American Humane
Association, and Charles W. Friedrichs, Sec-
retary-Manager of the San Francisco SPCA.
Mr. Friedrichs also is a Director of the Ameri—
can Humane Association.

Directors of the NHS said, when they ap-
proved employment of special counsel, that
they are determined to continue pressure
on shippers and government agencies until
the monkeys are shipped in satisfactory con-
ditions.

Letters to Pan American World Airways,
protesting exclusion of NHS inspectors from
Pan American cargo areas, would be help-

ful. Letters should be addressed to Mr.

John A. Creedy, Public Relations Director,.

Pan American World Airways, 135 East
42nd St., New York 17, N. Y.

 

NOTICE

The annual corporation meeting of The Na-
tional Humane Society will be held in Grand
Rapids, Mich., on Thursday, November 3.

The NHS meeting will follow the convention
of the American Humane Association, which
will be held in Grand Rapids, from Oct. 31
through Nov. 2. Directors of the NHS previ-
ously had decided to hold the NHS meeting
after the AHA meeting, in the same place. The
purpose of this decision was to eliminate in-
convenience and expense to people who might
Wish to attend both the NHS and AHA

meetings.

 

NHS Education Reaches Millions
With Humane Facts at Low Cost

Because Directors of the National Humane
Society believe that mass education of the
public is essential to the ending of big na-
tional cruelties to animals, the NHS Board
devoted a large portion of its recent Chi-
cago meeting to a review of educational work
done by the Society in its ﬁrst eight months
and to plans for further expansion of this
work.

Helen Jones, Educational Activities Di-
rector, presented displays and a statistical
report to the Board, showing that the NHS
has written, or arranged, newspaper articles
about major cruelties that have had a circula-
tion of more than 50,000,000 copies, and has
arranged and presented radio and television
programs with a total audience of at least
250,000,000. '

Major subjects presented to the public
by the NHS efforts have been the national
surplus of dogs and cats and the cruelties
that result from the surplus, cruelties to
animals in slaughter-houses, and mistreat-
ment during shipment of monkeys being
used in production of polio vaccine.

Miss Jones, whose headquarters are in the
New York City oﬂice of the NHS, also re-
ported to the Board that several national
magazines are preparing articles on these
subjects and on other national cruelties.

As an indication of the efficiency and ef—
fectiveness of doing humane education in
the National Humane Society way, Miss
Jones gave the Board of Directors details
about a few typical radio and TV programs
that the NHS has arranged.

For example, Miss Mildred Fitz-Hugh, an
NHS Director and President of the Illinois
Citizens Animal Welfare League, appeared
as a guest on “The Breakfast Club,” a very
popular CBS network radio show. Miss
Fitz-Hugh and Don McNeil, master of cere-
monies, chatted for about ﬁve minutes about
the evils of breeding surplus dogs and cats,
and about other NHS work. The time used
would be sold to a commercial sponsor for
just under $2,500.

Mrs. R. Alger Sawyer, Secretary of the
NHS Board, was interviewed by Maggi Mc-
Nellis on WABD-TV, a New York City sta—
tion. A one-minute spot announcement on
this station costs a commercial sponsor $5500.
Mrs. Sawyer was given ten minutes, or $5,000
worth of time.

Mrs. Philip Sherwood, of Westwood, Mass,
went to New Haven, Conn., to appear on the
Loys Malgren TV show, on WNHC. She
got $1,160 worth of time to talk about
slaughter house cruelties, surplus animals,
and imported monkeys.

And for a ﬁnal example, “The Coffee
Club,” a program on WAAT, Newark, N. J.,
gave a full half-hour to Mrs. Sawyer, Mrs.
Ludwig Bemelmans, and Delos E. Culver,
another NHS Director, for a discussion of

 

Rodeo Stopped

A by-product of the recent attack
upon bullﬁghts in Indiana by The Na-
tional Humane Society and the South
Bend Humane Society was cancellatiOn
of a rodeo scheduled for later presen-
tation in the South Bend Arena.

NHS and South Bend Humane So-
ciety officers told the arena owner that
they would arrest everyone who had any
remote connection with any injury of an
0— animal during the scheduled rodeo. The
Arena owner promptly wired the rodeo
promoters a cancellation of their en-
gagement of the arena.

several cruelties against which the National
Humane Society is working. The half-hour
is priced to commercial sponsors at $2,000.

The NHS Board discussed plans for a new
kind of humane education in public schools
of the nation but was forced to withhold
immediate action by lack of money necessary
to carry through the program that is needed.

breeding surplus kittens and puppies?

The Facts of sze

An army, they say, travels on its stomach. No matter how brave
the soldiers, if supply lines are cut no war can be won. The National
Humane Society has run into that same, hard fact of life. The NHS
can't win the big war it is fighting without money—and much money.
Money in needed to fight the battle for a humane slaughter law;
money is needed to send inspectors to airports in many parts of the
country to protect imported laboratory monkeys; money is needed to
pay for legal action against bullfight promoters; money is needed to
organize committees to prevent breeding of homeless dogs and cats.

And, please note, all of the NHS battles are on nation-wide fronts
and MUCH money is needed. '

If you haven't yet joined the National Humane Society, please do
so. now. Money that you give now will NOT be piled up in a sterile
endowment to guarantee future payrolls; it will be used NOW to pro—
tect animals.

NHS Maps Action
Against National
Dog Theft Rings

Dog stealing is a major racket in some
areas of the United States. Family pets are
the most frequent victims. There is strong
evidence, though yet no legal proof, that
thousands of the stolen dogs wind up in
research laboratories. Others, chiefly pure-
breds, go to unethical pet. shops and itinerant
dog dealers. The racket is unusually vi-
cious because most of the stolen animals
are accustomed to affectionate care and be-
cause their loss brings sorrow to the bereft
owners.

Cooperating with several local humane so-
cieties that have painstakingly unearthed
preliminary evidence against several big dog
dealers who are known to be selling large
numbers of dogs to laboratories, the Na-
tional Humane Society has been discussing
further action with a large national detec-
tive agency. No commitment has been made
but the NHS intends, if possible, to help
the. local societies uncover further evidence
and to learn whether there is an inter-state
racket ring above the individual dog thieves
and the local dog dealers who purchase stolen
animals.

The impediment to prompt and vigorous
action by the NHS is lack of money neces-
sary for the detective work required.

The cost of work that might lead to im-
portant arrests and convictions could run
to $5,000. The National Humane Society
does not now have such a fund available
for this purpose. All of the NHS treasury
already is committed for other humane work.
An effort will be made, in the next few
months, to accumulate enough money to
make the needed detective work possible.

New Executive Group

Elected by Board

The National Humane Society Board of
Directors held an all-day meeting in Chi-
cago on Saturday, July 16. All Directors
were present except Mrs. Elsa S. Voss, who
was on vacation in Wyoming, and Dr. Robert
A. Russell, who was prevented from attend-
ing by business of his church in Denver.

Virtually the entire day was devoted to
reviewing humane work already done and
to planning new attacks on cruelty.

The Board also elected an Executive Com-
mittee, which is expected to meet approxi-
mately monthly with staff members, and ap-
proved a ﬁnancial budget for the next quar-
ter of this year.

Members of the new Executive Commit-
tee are: Robert J. Chenoweth, of Kansas
City, Mo., who is also Board Chairman;
Charles Herbert Appleby, New York City,

who is Society Treasurer; Delos E. Culver,
Philadelphia, who is Society Vice Chairman;
Mrs. R. Alger Sawyer, Scarsdale, N. Y.,
who is Secretary, and Mrs. Voss, of Monk-
ton, Md.

Among the humane-work projects discus-
sed by the Board were slaughter-house cruel-
ties; evil conditions under which monkeys
and other animals and birds still are being
imported for laboratories, zoos, and pet shops;
the national surplus of dogs and cats; mount-
ing efforts to promote bullﬁghting in the
United States; techniques and objectives of
national humane education; organized dog
stealing in several sections of the country,
and organization of humane work in local-
ities where there now is none.

Bullﬁghts

(Continued from page I)

cancel a Sunday afternoon ﬁght scheduled in
South Bend. Andrews and officers of the
South Bend Society has told the promoter that
Humane Officers would be present at any ﬁght
staged and that if a single animal were even
slightly injured, the promoter and everyone
taking part in the event would be arrested
and prosecuted. The promoter cancelled the
afternoon ﬁght and refunded money to ticket
holders but apparently he worked up his cour-
age later in the day and the scheduled night
ﬁght was held.

Mexican matadors who waved their capes
at the bull all over the ring obviously had been
told to be super-careful not to allow harm to
come to the bull. The “ﬁght” turned out to
be so tame that the very small crowd booed
the show.

Another Portuguese ﬁght, scheduled by the
same promoter in St. Louis, Mo., was cancelled
as a result of threats of arrests by Missouri
humane societies.

 

BULLETIN

The American Humane Association
seems to be at least partly respon-
sible for refusal by Pan American
World Airways to allow the National
Humane Society to inspect shipments
of laboratory monkeys at San Fran-
cisco airport.

This was revealed by a letter writ-
ten by Mel L. Morse, AHA execu-
tive director, to Pan American. Mr.
Morse told the airline that it need
not allow itself to be "bothered"
by "needless questions" about mon-
key shipments. Mr. Morse assured
Pan American that it need not pay
attention to any humane society not
"authorized" by the AHA.

Mr. Morse's letter did NOT say
that the AHA plans to do any of the
protective work that the AHA is
helping to keep the National Hu-
mane Society from doing.

 

 

 

NHS Posts Reward

For Convictions of
Turtle Torturers

Along Florida coasts there is a commercial
enterprise and “sport” known locally as
“turtle turning.” The National Humane So-
ciety Board of Directors in July offered a
reward of $250 for information leading to
arrest and conviction of anyone participating
in a turtle turning.

Mary Lou Culbertson, a writer for the
Daytona Beach Evening News, described in
a June 23 article what turtle turning is.

The hunters of the big Florida sea tur-
tles boat along the beach at night. They
seek female turtles that are coming ashore
to lay eggs. When a turtle is found, it is
hoisted aboard the boat and taken to a se-
cluded beach for butchering because the
state of Florida has a maximum ﬁne of $500
or six months in jail for taking a turtle on
the beach. Miss Culbertson watched one
turtle being killed.

“It was said, ‘Miss Culbertson reported,
“that a turtle has to be butchered alive,
carved off piece by piece, in order to be ten-
der.

“The ﬂippers were cut off ﬁrst. ‘Cracker
beefsteaks,’ on the quarters of the creature
were removed next. Then a long knife was
run around the edges of the turtle’s under-
shell. The turtle was still alive. . . . Then
the shell was lifted off and the turtle’s in-
nards, complete with eggs, blood, muscle,
guts and beating heart were exposed. A
man reached down, elbow deep into the
blood, and began to remove the eggs.

“All during this procedure the helpless
turtle watched while it was being butchered.
Its exposed heart kept on heating rapidly.
Tears streamed from its eyes. . . Several
times it heaved great sighs.”

Notices of the National Humane Society
reward have been sent to scores of Florida
police departments, game wardens, and news-
papers.

Slaughter

(Continued from page I)

lems “without compulsion.” There is, how-
ever, no evidence that the majority of slaugh-
terers are even interested in alleviating the
cruelties for which they are responsible.

The National Humane Society has for
months been distributing its folder on slaugh-
ter house cruelties at an average rate of nearly
2,000 a day. Sample folders will be sent to
anyone on request. Humane societies, clubs
and individuals are invited to buy quantities of
this folder, at cost, and help get them into
additional hands.

The NHS also is constantly placing educa-
tional articles in newspapers, and several radio
and TV programs have carried news about
the humane slaughter campaign.

 




FEBRUARY, 1958

SUS Fights in Court and in
ational Publicity Battle to
eep Animals Out of Rockets

The Humane Society of the United
States acted forcefully and effectively
across the nation last month to halt the
use of living animals in experimental

rockets being manufactured and ﬁred by

clubs of children and teen-agers.
On petition from The Humane Society

of the United States and the Minnesota
Humane Society, an Austin, Minn., court
in January issued an order restraining
a club of teen-age rocket experimenters
and their adviser, a high school teacher,
from shooting live animals aloft in their
home-made missiles. ‘

Before The HSUS intervened, and was
joined in its legal action by the Minne-
sota Humane Society, the young experi-

menters had killed two mice in their

rockets and were planning further animal ex-
periments. One of the animal victims was
killed by concussion when the rocket in which
it rode plunged several feet into the earth.
Another mouse was burned to death or killed
by concussion when a rocket exploded.

In Littleton, Colo., the local Board of Edu-
cation voted formally to forbid use of animals,
after The HSUS telegraphed a protest against
use of one mouse in the past and warned that
the society would take “all necessary action”
to prevent use of other animals in future
rockets. Littleton school authorities had an-
nounced earlier that more mice were to be
shot aloft.

In Frederick, Md., two teen-age experi-
menters who attempted to send a bird up in a
rocket and who announced that in future they
would use mice, received a warning from The
HSUS and cancelled their plans for further
experiments with animals.

Adult advisers of youthful rocket experi-
menters were warned by The HSUS, in a na-
tionally distributed press release, not to per-
mit or encourage any use of animals that vio-
lates anti-cruelty laws.

The Austin court has not yet ruled on a
petition by The HSUS and MHS for tempo-
rary and permanent injunctions against use
of animals in rockets ﬁred by the Minnesota
boys but at a hearing held on Jan. 17 the court

YEAST INSTEAD OF
ANIMALS

A Navy spokesman announced
in January that the ﬁrst American
sattelites will carry yeast into space
instead of animals. The United
Press quoted Hilden T. Cox, ex-
ecutive director of the American
Institute of Biological Sciences, as
saying that the yeast cells would
produce “inﬁnitely more signiﬁcant
data than putting a mammal such
as a dog into space.”

 

 

 

Slaughter Bill Slated
ForFebruaryHouseVote

The Poage humane slaughter bill is sched-
uled to be voted on by the House of Repre-
sentatives in the ﬁrst half of February. Vet-
eran Congressmen and other experts predict
that the bill will be approved.

Congressman Poage’s bill, which The HSUS
helped to draft, makes humane slaughtering of
meat animals a legal policy of the United
States government and requires all agencies of
the Federal government to buy meat and meat
products only from packers who use approved
humane techniques. The bill will bring pro-
tection to more than 80 per cent of all animals
slaughtered in interstate commerce and to
many animals killed in plants that do only an
intrastate business.

Early victory in the campaign for slaughter-
house reform was made probable by successful
negotiations between The Humane Society of
the United States and a group of politically
powerful Jewish organizations that blocked
enactment of a humane slaughter law last
summer. The Jewish groups were alarmed
about possible effects of the proposed legisla-
tion on the methods of slaughter prescribed by
religious law.

House Majority Leader John McCormack,
who has almost autocratic power to decide
whether any bill shall reach the ﬂoor of the
House for a vote, held up action on the hu-
mane slaughter bill in response to requests by
Jewish organizations.

There was danger that the bill might be

killed by Congressmen who were concerned by
the fears of this large group of their con-
stituents.

Even before the ﬁrst session of the current
Congress adjourned, ofﬁcers of The HSUS be-
gan a long series of quiet, unpublicized con-
ferences with leaders of many national Jewish
organizations. Gradually the meetings pro-
duced a climate of‘mutual understanding.

The log-jam broke in early January when
R. J. Chenoweth, HSUS President, and Fred
Myers, Executive Director, met in New York
City with a large group representing both
Jewish laymen and the Reform and Conserva-
tive rabbinical organizations. As a result of
that conference, ﬁve large Jewish organizations
agreed to withdraw from the opposition to
the Poage bill in its ﬁnal form. Ofﬁcers of
those Jewish organizations promptly informed
Congressmen McCormack and Poage of their
decision and McCormack immediately sched-
uled the bill for a vote, with his inﬂuential
endorsement.

Congressman Poage wrote to The HSUS,
warmly thanking the society for its decisive
part in making early enactment of the bill
possible.

If the bill is approved by the-House, it then
will go to the Senate. Another bill, S. 1497,
sponsored by Senators Humphrey, Neuberger
and Purtell, is pending in the Senate. Sena-
tors must decide‘whether to approve the Sen-

ate bill or theHouse bill.

 

 

 

 

 




 

Second HSUS State Unit

Organized in New Jersey

Fifty enthusiastic leaders of humane work
from all parts of New Jersey completed or-
ganization of a New Jersey state branch of
The Humane Society of the United States
at a meeting in the Princeton Inn on Jan.
18. Incorporation papers for the unit, as
“The Humane Society of the United States,
New Jersey Branch,” were ﬁled in Trenton.

Like the Connecticut HSUS Branch, organ-
ized earlier, the New Jersey Branch will con-
centrate its efforts on anti-cruelty work in
areas where no local humane societies exist
and on participation in the national anti-
cruelty programs of The HSUS.

Incorporators of the new unit are Mrs.
Edith A. Barnett, Medford Lake; Mrs.
William A. Bender, Bloomﬁeld; James M.
Denelsbeck, Audubon; Mrs. R. Stuvyesant
Pierrepont, Princeton, and William O’Crady,
Atlantic Highlands.

Trustees are Mrs. Allen W. Stephens,
Princeton; Miss Clista Grant, Upper Mont-
clair, and Mrs. Helena Franklin, Woodridge.

Temporary officers are Mr. O’Grady, Presi-
dent; Mrs. Catherine Scott, Neptune, Vice-
President; Miss Serenne L. Everitt, Mont-
clair, Treasurer, and Miss Virginia LaMarche,
Red Bank, Secretary.

The new branch follows; in its organiza-
tional structure, a pattern approved by The
HSUS Board of Directors. The New Jersey
unit is an independent corporation but is
closely linked to The HSUS by its by-laws
and its declaration of purpose, included in
its corporate charter. The organizing work
was done by Alfred B. Lawson, Jr., HSUS

Director of Organization. Mr. Lawson pre-

 

Dog Breeder Helps
Reduce Breeding

Larry Downey of Libertyville, 111., reports
in “Popular Dogs” an idea that ought to be
spread among breeders of purebred dogs and
cats.

Mr. and Mrs. James Works of Terre Haute,
Ind., Mr. Downey says, sell the “lesser” pup-
pies of their Boxer litters only without papers.
They make a written contract with the buyer
that if the purchaser later decides to breed,
the owner will pay an additional $100 per
puppy for papers.

However, upon proof that the bitches of
the litter have been spayed, papers will be
supplied without charge.

This procedure, if widely adopted, would
reduce the breeding of many inferior speci-
mens of purebred animals which eventually
add substantially to the already existing sur~
plus of dogs and cats.

Work toward organization of an

was begun in January. Montgomery County,
which lies immediately north of the District
of Columbia, is mushrooming into a metro-
politan community and is reputed to be the
third wealthiest county in the United States,
per capita, but has no active general humane
society. Members of the HSUS staff have
been handling the majority of cruelty com-
plaints and in Montgomery
County as a personal activity.

New Orleans Laboratories Push

Drive for SPCA Animals

New Orleans medical schools and other
laboratories are intensifying their campaign
to compel or persuade the Louisiana SPCA
to give them cats and dogs from the SPCA
shelter for experimental purposes.

Faculty members of both Louisiana State
University and Tulane University are stump-
ing among civic organizations and issuing
frequent public statements to the press, de-
claring that the progress of science is being
seriously impeded because the SPCA is grant-
ing euthanasia to homeless dogs and cats
that the laboratories would like to have.

The HSUS is actively working with New
Orleans humanitarians, including the Animal
Havens League, to protect the integrity of the
SPCA shelter as a humane refuge for animals.
The task is difficult because an apparent ma-
jority of Directors of the Louisiana SPCA,
an affiliate of the American Humane Associa-
tion, seem to have no objection to sending
animals to the laboratories. The SPCA Board
last year cleared the way for the laboratories
by initiating an amendment to the SPCA char-
ter, eliminating a charter provision that re-
quired ahumane death for animals for which

no homes could be found.

Now the laboratories are trying to get the
city council to repeal an old law that has the
same protective clause for animals that for-
merly was in the SPCA charter.

Laboratory spokesmen have resorted to ex-
travagant and untrue statements in their battle
for supporting public opinion.

Dr. George Davis, assistant professor of
physiology in LSU, was quoted in a recent
issue of the New Orleans Times-Picayune
as saying to a group of business men that
“dogs used for experimental purposes are in
no way allowed to suffer.” Dr. Davis also
was reported to have said that when animals
are experimented upon they are treated vir-
tually as people would be in a hospital. Dr.
Davis did not limit his assurances; he took
all laboratories, everywhere, under his wing.

The HSUS took immediate issue with Dr.
Davis in a letter sent to the Times-Picayune
for publication by Fred Myers, HSUS Execu-
tive Director.

The HSUS letter asserted that the state-
ments attributed to Dr. Davis are “absolutely
false.”

 




“It will be reasonable for the public of
New Orleans to wonder,” Mr. Myers wrote,
“whom to believe in this situation—Dr. Davis
or me. I suggest that it would help to answer
that question if one of the Times-Picayune's
excellent reporters would now ask Dr. Davis
to comment on what I have said. I think
that it would be discovered that Dr. Davis
did not really mean what he has been quoted
as saying.

“If Dr. Davis cares to debate with me, how-
ever, I shall be happy to oﬂer documentary
and pictorial proof, in the columns of the
Times Picayune, that the statements attributed
to Dr. Davis are as false as I say they are.”

In another letter, published in the New
Orleans States, the HSUS told the public of
New Orleans that conditions in some New
Orleans laboratories are among the cruelest
in the nation. The HSUS suggested that
the New Orleans laboratories should provide
elementary humane care for animals already
being used before seeking additional animals.

Ofﬁcers and members of the Animal Havens
League, of which W. A. Osborn is President
and Mrs. Jack Lighter is Vice-President, are
conducting a vigorous local campaign against
the seizure plan.

A bill that would clear the way for send-
ing SPCA animals to the laboratories is pend-
ing before the city council but the council
has been, so far, unwilling to vote on it.

HSUS Help Asked for

Army Animals in Africa

Even in Africa, people turn to The Humane
Society of the United States when animals
need protection.

An American stationed at a Signal Corps
post in Africa recently reported to The HSUS
that military police have been inhumanely

beating them to death. I

commander of the post, and called the report
to the attention of Sen. Richard L. Neuberger,
an HSUS Director.

Colonel Little replied that in one instance
a club was used on a dog and that “the
distress expressed to you by some member
of the Station was shared by me.”

The HSUS is investigating further.

Cause and Effect

 

 

These three pictures show cause and effect—and they explain why The HSUS spends
a great deal of its treasury and its energy on a national campaign to reduce the
breeding of puppies and kittens. The nine puppies above were abandoned by the
breeder—they were left in the parked automobile of a stranger and wound up in the
shelter of the Illinois Citizens Animal Welfare League in Chicago. What often happens
when surplus animals grow up is pictured in the other two photos. Both were turned
out to starve. They got to a humane shelter before they died—but still there were
no homes for them. About 35,000,000 puppies and 50,000,000 kittens are born in
the United States every year. Millions of animals like those pictured here must be
killed every year, or must die of starvation, disease and cold, until the breeding
is reduced.

continued the restraining order, originally
granted on Jan. 10.

At the Jan. 17 hearing the judge also re-
moved the high school teacher, Sister Duns
Scotus of Pacelli High School, from the liti-
gaﬁon.

A ruling on the requested temporary in-
junction is expected near the end of February.

The HSUS took court action after the
cruelty in Austin received national publicity
and it was clear that further cruelty was
intended. The HSUS engaged Perry W.
Copeland, a Minneapolis attorney who is a
Director of the Minnesota Humane Society,
to ﬁle the injunction petition. With the active
cooperation of Richard Anderson, President
of the Minnesota Humane Society, the Min-
nesota society immediately volunteered to join
The HSUS as a plaintiff. The HSUS, how-
ever, has paid all costs of the action.

HSUS workers were not surprised to learn

that many people in Minnesota and elsewhere

in the nation rushed to public defense of the
boy experimenters. Many letters published in
Minnesota newspapers and many letters sent
to The HSUS in Washington applauded the
“intelligence” and the “initiative” of the boys
and reviled The HSUS and the Minnesota
Humane Society for (as one writer put it)
“discouraging future scientists.”

To ﬁght the battle for humane education,
The HSUS sent to Minnesota Miss Helen E.
Jones, its Director of Educational Activities.
Miss Jones, Mr. Copeland and Mr. Anderson
were overwhelmed for days by newspaper
reporters and by requests to appear on radio
and television programs.

The theme of all public statements by The
HSUS was that it is harmful to children and
to society to permit and encourage children
to engage in cruelty or to be indifferent to
animal suffering and death.

In a statement published in the Minneapolis
Tribune and other newspapers, Miss Jones
said:

“All religions and all thoughtful people
recognize that the most lasting effect of
cruelty is the harm done to the moral
values, character and spiritual life of
the person who is cruel or indifferent to
suffering. We believe that in the Austin
cruelties, harm was done not only to the
children there but that continued cruelty
in Austin would have suggested similar
acts to the impressionable minds of
countless children throughout our coun-
try, resulting in continued harm to both
animals and children.”

The Minneapolis Star, largest daily news-
paper in the upper Middle West, pointed
out that “there is no scientiﬁc reason for
the use of mice, dogs, monkeys or living
creatures of any kind in the sort of labora-
tory exercises—they are NOT experiments—t
being conducted by the Austin students. No-
thing of value is added to the rocketry lessons
by the inclusion of any living thing.”

 

$1,000 To Save a Mouse

 

Elsewhere in this bulletin is a report of court action taken by
The Humane Society of the United States in Austin, Minn., to pre-
vent teen-age boys from shooting mice aloft in home-made rockets.
What we want to report in this column, with a bit of editorial com-
ment, is that the Austin action cost nearly $1,000.

That was money contributed by our members, in many cases
with personal sacriﬁce

Was it worth it? Does it make sense to spend that much money
to save a mouse—or even a dozen mice—from cruelty?

Well, ordinarily we would say “no.” In ordinary circumstances
it wouldn’t make sense. Funds available to The HSUS for animal-
protection work are limited—sharply limited. We know of many
cruelties that we can do nothing about because we don’t have the
money or man-power that would be needed to attack all cruelties
simultaneously. Every day we must make choices: shall we con-
centrate on these cruelties or on those cruelties. And common
sense tells us that ordinarily it is more useful to spend $1,000 to
save a hundred million animals from slaughter-house cruelties
than to spend that sum in defense of a single mouse.

It is not that we are less compassionate toward “the sparrow’s
fall” than toward other suffering. It is only that we must do the
most that we can with the tools given to us.

In the Austin case, however, much more was at stake than the
suffering of the few “timorous, cowering beasties” that were killed
by concussion and burned alive in exploding rockets.

What was at issue was whether deliberate, nationally publicized
cruelty, under adult auspices that gave that cruelty a powerful
moral endorsement, was to be unchallenged. Were the humane so-
cieties of America to be voiceless while children all over America
were taught pointlessly to mimic the Russian sputnik scientists?
While children were being taught irreverence for all life?

When we formulated the Austin issue in those terms we had
no difﬁculties in determining our answer. “7 e believe that HSUS
members will approve of our answer.

we did in Austin, use the coupon below. We need your help.

The HSUS and other humane organizations are making a determined
effort to end the worst cruelties of animal trapping. Sen. Richard L.
Neuberger, an HSUS Director, has introduced a humane trapping bill
(5.2489) in the Senate and Rep. William S. Broomﬁeld, Michigan, has
introduced an identical bill (H.R. 9303) in the House. The HSUS is
doing its part by working to inform the national public about trapping
cruelties. The newspaper clipping reproduced above is an example of
what The HSUS is doina. The Tufty column, varied for various locali-
ties, is regularly carried in more than 20 newspapers. The report on
trapping, with Senator Neuberger’s comment, reached approximately
500,000 persons. Other articles on trapping cruelties, arranged by
The HSUS, have attained a total circulation of several million copies.

Humane Slaughter Law

Asked for Sea Animals

Efforts by humane societies throughout the
world to obtain an international humane
slaughter law to protect ocean animals are
nearing a climax. The campaign will come
to a head in February at an international con-
ference of member governments of the United
Nations in Geneva. Purpose of the conference
is to adopt a “Law of the Sea.”

The National Humane Education Society,
Washington, D. C., has been most active in
organizing pressure for inclusion in the Law
of the Sea of a clause requiring that humane
methods of catching and killing living crea-
tures be used whenever such methods are de-
veloped to a practical state. Sponsors of the
proposed humane statute believe that tradi-
tional cruel methods of killing whales can be
immediately improved. .

Humane societies and individual humani-
tarians can help in the campaign by writing
immediately to John Foster Dulles, Secretary
of State, Washington, D. C., urging that the
American delegation to the Geneva conference
support the proposed humane clause.

Indian Government asks

HSUS About Monkeys

‘ Further improvement in care for great num-
bers of monkeys shipped from India to the
United States for laboratory uses was presaged
last month by a conference between staff mem-
bers of The Humane Society of the United
States and the Embassy of the Government of
India.

The conference was held at the request of
the Indian government. It was inspired by
public reports made by The HSUS about cruel
conditions under which monkeys have been
shipped from India to American laboratories.

The HSUS representatives—Helen Jones,
Director of Educational Activities and Fred
Myers, Executive Director—were told that
HSUS reports and other information have
caused agitation in the Indian parliament for
tighter shipping regulations. and closer super-
vision of what happens to monkeys after they
leave India.

Miss Jones and Mr. Myers suggested that
the Indian government arrange for an exact
count of the number of monkeys that die and
are injured on the long trip. The HSUS has
inspected many incoming shipments but never
has been able to get the cooperation of The
National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis—-
the biggest importer—in counting monkeys.

An Indian Embassy spokesman said this and
other HSUS recommendations would be
studied both in Washington and in India.

 




New Program Committee of Board

Plans Aggressive Work in 1958

The new Program Planning Committee of
The HSUS Board of Directors held a two-day
meeting in St. Louis in December, reviewed
work done in the last year, and formulated
an aggressive program of speciﬁc activities for
the ﬁrst quarter of 1958 and a general outline
of a program for later periods.

Members of the Program Planning Commit-
tee are Mr. Oliver M. Evans, Clayton, Mo.;
Miss Grace Conahan, Webster Groves, Mo.;
Mr. R. J. Chenoweth, President of the HSUS,
Kansas City, Mo., and Miss Mildred Fitz-Hugh,
Chicago, 111. Mr. Evans is committee Chair-
man. All members of the committee and Fred
Myers, Executive Director, attended the meet-
ing.

Decisions of the Program Planning Com-
mittee will guide the society’s ofﬁcers and
staff in their work.

The program recommended by the committee
for the quarter (January-March, 1958):

A. Humane Slaughter Campaign

1. In very early January, organiza-
tion and management of a new
national ﬂood of “letters to the
editor” in about 1,000 news-
papers;

. A special bulletin, in January, to
all members and contacts—
about 15,000 persons—urging
letters to Congressmen;

News releases and suggested edi-
torial comment to about 1,000
newspapers; .

As far as is possible, arrange-
ment for feature articles by
syndicated columnists and by
radio and TV commentators;
Printing of 50,000 “one-sheet”
inserts for our humane slaugh-
ter folders, bringing their con-
tent up to date;

6. Appropriate contacts with key
Congressmen.

Campaign to reduce surplus animal
breeding.

1. We urgently need some national
surveys to produce dog-cat sta-
tistics that will give us “news”
material but we probably cannot
afford anything of the sort in
the ﬁrst quarter of 1958. We
will continue arranging mass
educational articles in the press,
aiming at both newspapers and
magazines. ..

Publication of 100,000 copies of
a new folder on this subject,
using pictures and text aimed at
touching emotions as well as in-
tellect and particularly intended
to be a working tool of our new

state and area committees and
of local humane societies.

3. Commissioning to a competent
motion picture writer the job of
writing the script for a 15-min-
ute ﬁlm presenting the evils of
surplus breeding. we will not
be able to ﬁnance production
of the ﬁlm in this quarter but
if a good script is made avail-
able we will use it in an attempt
to obtain a special gift of funds
to ﬁnance ultimate production

of the ﬁlm.
4. Production of 10,000 copies of

a technical brochure for private
circulation among ofﬁcers of
city and county governments,
presenting reasons why, from
the standpoint of local govern-
ment ﬁnance, public health and
welfare, and politics, the local
government units should under-
take campaigns of their own to
reduce the breeding of cats and
dogs. This brochure would eni-
phasize the importance of an
effective scale of dog license fees
and enforcement.

C. Continue laboratory project.

D. Organization of
committees in:

state and area

1. New Jersey (if not completed
earlier);

2. Montgomery County, Maryland;

3. Minnesota.

Production and distribution of 25,-
000 copies of a folder on inhumane
trapping, showing available hu-
mane traps.

Commissioning an architect, with
experience in designing a satisfac-
tory small animal shelter, to design
a “model” shelter in the $10,000-
$20,000 class, suitable for use by
small towns and cities and by small
local humane societies.

G. Preparation of booklet “How to
Organize a Humane Society.”

Several parts of the planned program al-

ready have been executed and others are in
progress.

The Program Planning Committee expects

to meet every three months in order to adapt
work of the society to changing conditions.

He who towards every living thing is kind,
Ah! he, indeed, shall true religion ﬁnd.

what can and should be done immediately
by people who want to see an end of
slaughter-house cruelties. The fate of
pending national humane slaughter legis-
lation probably will be decided in the
next few weeks. The News Tribune
article was arranged by Mrs. Edward P.
Byrne, Chairman of the Washington
State Committee for Humane Slaughter

of the HSUS.

A New

Urgent Message
To

Humanitarians

This message is primarily intended for mem-
bers of the American Humane Association
but will be of interest to all humanitarians.

 




 

To All Members of the American Humane Association

AST YEAR a great victory for humanitarian principles was

won at the Atlanta Convention of the American Humane
Association. At the best-attended meeting of the Ameri-
can Humane Association in all of its 78 years, an over-
whelming majority of individual members and humane so-
cieties present voted for and elected three candidates for
the AHA Board of Directors who were pledged to basic
humanitarian principles and to vigorous action by the AHA
to put these principles into effect.

This autumn the members of The American Humane As-
sociation will again have an opportunity to help return The
American Humane Association to its original humane prin.
ciples and to make it what it should be—-— an active, force-
ful leader of all of the humane organizations of the coun-
try and an organizer and coordinator of true humane work
throughout the nation.

Three nationally known leaders of the best type of hu-
mane work will. be presented as candidates for election to
the AHA Board of Directors at the annual corporation meet-
ing of the AHA to be held in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The
candidates whom we favor, and for whom nominating peti-
tions are now being circulated in accordance with the AHA
by-laws, are:

Robert Lindstrom, New Orleans, Louisiana—Mr. Lind-
strom is past president of the Louisiana Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and now president of the
Louisiana Association of Humane Societies. Mr. Lindstrom
is a businessman who has been widely known for many years
throughout all of the southeastern section of the United
States as an effective leader of all kinds of work to protect
animals from cruelty and suffering.

Mrs. Martha Flanagan, South Bend, Indiana—Mrs.
Flanagan is secretary of the South Bend Humane Society, a
director of the Midwest Conference of Humane Societies,
and is Secretary-Treasurer of the Indiana Federation of Hu~
mane Societies. Active humane workers throughout a wide
section of the middle west know from personal experience
that she is one of the most aggressive and effective ﬁghters
for our cause in the United States.

Mrs. Roger L. Stevens, Ann Arbor, Michigan, and New
York City—Mrs. Stevens is president of the Animal Wel-
fare Institute, a director of the Washtenaw County (Ann
Arbor) Humane Society, and is known and highly respected
by humane workers all over the world as a leader of her
local humane society and of national and international work
that has greatly advanced and strengthened all of the hu-
mane movement in America.

These candidates have agreed among themselves upon the
following statement of basic principles and policies upon
which they will stand for election:

“We View with alarm and distress the lethargy, cynicism
and lack of concern about cruelty and suffering that have
become the principal characteristics of The American Hu-
man Association and the constant trend in the AHA away
from democratic control of the organization by its member-
ship. We believe that these destructive tendencies can be
arrested and reversed only by continuation of a reform of
the AHA Board of Directors along lines instituted by vote
of the AHA membership last year.

“If elected directors of The American Humane Associa-
tion, we will stand for and actively ﬁght for the following
principles and policies:

“1. We will vote to place the American Humane Associa-
tion in the strongest possible opposition to all forms of
cruelty, wherever it exists, by whomever committed;

“2. We will vote to require, as a condition of membership
in or afﬁliation with the AHA, that any humane society
must dispose of any animal that comes under its control in
one of the following ways, and in no other:

a. By returning the animal to its owner;
b. By ﬁnding a suitable new home for the animal;
c. By granting the animal a painless death.

“3. We oppose all pound seizure laws and will vote to
use every available AHA resource to defeat pound seizure

bills ;

“4-. We will vote to provide facilities in the AHA to give
adequate ﬁeld service to member societies and we will vote
to conduct a vigorous campaign to organize humane work
in all parts of America where none exists;

“5. We will favor an amendment of AHA By-Laws to
give the AHA membership control of standards and quali-
ﬁcations for membership in the Association;

“6. We will favor an amendment of the By-Laws to de-
crease the terms of AHA directors to three years;

“7. We will vote to provide facilities for a continuing
campaign to extend AHA membership to every humanitarian
in America in place of the present policy of restricting mem-
bership to a few score persons and societies.”

ERHAPS some members of the AHA do not understand

why the continuing battle to reform and revitalize the
Association is absolutely vital to the whole humane move-
ment, particularly to the hundreds of local societies that are
the movement’s backbone. Perhaps we can best explain
Why the AHA must be reformed by telling you about two
meetings of the AHA Board of Directors both held in Chi-

cago, one on January 21, 1955, and the other on May 14,
1955.

 




 

At the meeting on January 21, the “Old Guard” majority
of the AHA Board voted that “henceforth” a humane so-
ciety shall be granted membership in the AHA, or shall be
allowed to continue current membership in the AHA, only
if the society:

“1. Has a voting membership of not less than 25 in-
dividual members;

“2. Employs at least, one full-time paid teacher if a
humane education society; ‘

“3. Has-at least one full-time paid employee if a society
for the prevention of cruelty to children;

“4. Operates a shelter and a small ambulance and has
at least one full-time paid employee if a society for
the prevention of cruelty to animals;

“5. Operates a shelter and has automotive transportation
available and has at least one full-time paid employee
if a humane society or an animal protective society;

“6. Proves to the satisfaction of the board through its
answers to the Association’s ‘Questionnaire and Sur-
vey’ concerning organization, activities, and program
that its application for membership should be
granted.”

It is notable that these points may serve to measure the
wealth and prosperity of an organization but they provide
no measure of the level of an organization’s humane prin-
ciples or the quality of its work.

The openly avowed purpose of these materialistic
criteria for AHA membership is to provide grounds
for disenfranchising the many small humane so-
cieties in all parts of the country that have acutely
felt the inadequacies of the AHA and that last year
voted for reform of the AHA Board.

At the AHA Board meeting on May 14, the three direc-
tors elected on a reform platform by the Atlanta Conven-
tion tried to add another qualiﬁcation for affiliation with the
AHA by any local organization. Miss J .' M. Perry, one of
the directors elected at Atlanta, moved that, in order to be
accepted as a member of The American Humane Associa-
tion, any animal protective society must “dispose of any
animal received at its shelter in a humane manner.”

Most humanitarians would think that this should be the
ﬁrst of all requirements for any humane organization, but
the AHA Board of Directors voted down the motion, 9 to 3.
The only directors voting for the motion were Mr. C. Ray-
mond Naramore, Miss Perry and Professor Roland Smlth.
Needless to say, Miss Perry and Professor Smith were the
other two directors elected by the AHA membership last

year. . . {I t. e1
Mrs. Stevens, one of our candldates this year, e ec1v y

stated our feelings about all of this in a letter to Mr. Kerns
Wright, Chairman of the Board of the AHA. Mrs. Stevens
said:

“We have certainly come a long way from the
original purposes for which humane societies were
founded when a set of standards can be drawn up and
accepted as a basis for admission to membership in
The American Humane Association, complete down to
the last detail as regards such matters as charters,
incorporation, by-laws, directors, ofﬁcers, members,
meetings, even speciﬁcally demanding such material
advantages as a full-time paid employe and motor
transport, but omitting the most fundamental rule of
honest and honorable shelter operation: the humane
disposal of all animals that enter the shelter.”

To many humanitarians who have trusted The American
Humane Association and who have not been in a position
to watch the decay that has been progressively rotting our
once great federation for many years, the clear implications
of the Board actions that we report here may tax credulity.
What we report, however, is on the record and the implica-
tions are inescapable.

But what we have told you above is by no means the
whole story. b

At the meeting on May 14, the majority of the
AHA Board (with only Naramore, Perry, and Smith
dissenting) voted to try to disenfranchise all but 30
or 40 of the approximately 3,000 individual members
of the AHA.

Hardly a person who will receive this leaﬂet will be
allowed a vote in the 1955 annual meeting of the
AHA if the unprincipled majority of the AHA Board
succeeds in carrying ”out its intentions.

Speciﬁcally, the majority of the AHA Board voted, at the
May 14 meeting, to attempt to railroad through a rump spe-
cial meeting of the AHA membership an amendment to the
AHA by-laws which would allow an individual voting mem-
bership in the AHA only to persons who pay $500 and who,
in addition, are speciﬁcally accepted for membership by the
AHA Board.

This amendment, if adopted, would summarily ex-
pel about 3,000 present members, including virtually
every active leader of humane work in America.

The proposed amendment of by-laws also provides that:
“The Board of Directors may terminate any membership at
any time and shall have full discretionary powers in so
doing.”

Still further, the Board voted at its May 14 meeting to
propose an additional amendment of the by-laws which
would allow two-thirds of the members of the board
to remove any'director from ofﬁce even though that
director had been elected by the AHA membership.

The purpose of this provision, obviously, would be to en-

5

 




 

able the “Old Guard” of the AHA Board to retain control
of AHA affairs and policies, regardless of the wishes of
afﬁliated societies and individual members.

The story is not yet ﬁnished.

At the same May 14 meeting, the majority of the AHA
Board voted to attempt to railroad its proposed amendments
to the AHA by-laws by calling a special meeting of corpora-
tion members in Seattle, Washington, late this summer. The
agenda at the meeting will be a motion to accept the amend-
ments to by-laws proposed by the AHA Board.

The clear purpose of calling such a meeting in
Seattle—thousands of miles from the center of popu-
lation of American humane societies—was to prevent
the smaller humane societies and the AHA’s individ-
ual members from having a vote on a proposal to
change the fundamental character and nature of the
Association.

In our opinion, such political maneuvering is not merely
undemocratic, it is immoral. We have been advised that
it is illegal.

HY is the majority of the AHA Board so intent upon

retaining control of the AHA that it is willing to de-
stroy the very nature of the Association rather than submit
debated questions to the AHA membership and to the hu-
mane societies that do all of the humane work of the
country?

We know the answer to that question and will give it, but
in order to make our reasoning clear, we think that it will
be useful ﬁrst to describe the present condition and activi-
ties of the AHA.

Most humanitarians, we are sure, believe that the primary
functions of The American Humane Association are (l) to
supply ﬁeld assistance and expert counsel to the hundreds
of local humane societies that man the front line trenches
of the humane battle and (2) to plan, coordinate and ex-
ecute national projects in humane education and attacks
upon the great national cruelties.

If the AHA does not perform these functions, it does
nothing.

The fact is that at the time this is written the
American Humane Association has only one ﬁeld
worker to cover the whole of the United States. Since,
obviously, one man cannot even pretend to give even
minimum service to all of the humane societies in the
United States, this lone ﬁeld man is almost entirely
restricted to a very superﬁcial brand of “lick and a
promise” activity in the southeastern states. With
an endowment of millions of dollars, the AHA Board
says that it cannot afford more assistance to local
humane societies than can be provided by its one

ﬁeld worker.

Q-




The highly paid executives in the AHA headquarters out
in Denver do occasionally write a letter to a local society
that is in trouble or in need of help and even more rarely
they may visit a society for a few hours, but every local so-
ciety in the country knows well that it is now impossible to
get real help of any kind from The American Humane
Association.

The National Humane Review, the magazine that is the
principal and almost the only educational enterprise of the
AHA, has been reduced to six issues a year, has been op-
erated since last November without an editor, and is circu-
lated almost exclusively to the people who in all of the.
United States are least in need of humane education.

By far the greater part of the large payroll of the Ameri-
can Humane Association is spent on the purely administra~
tive staff in the big mansion in Denver. The AHA is cur-
rently spending very considerably more on the payroll of its
ﬁnance and accounting department than on its entire ﬁeld
service.

(And at the May 14.« meeting of the AHA Board, the di-
rectors voted a $2,000 salary increase to the staff ﬁnance
secretary.)

We could say very much more about the way in which the
AHA wastes the money of its contributors and its deceased
endowers on inefﬁcient administrative procedures while it
fails and refuses to perform its proper functions, but it is
more important to call attention to the degeneration of AHA
principles. We will close this section of our remarks on the
deﬁciencies of the AHA by quoting the late Sydney Cole-
man, once president of the AHA and of the American SPCA
(the society that operates the New York City Pound). Mr.
Coleman, who probably knew the ineffectiveness of the
AHA better than anyone else in the United States, said a
year or two ago, in an irascible but truthful moment, that
“The AHA could close its doors tomorrow and not a
single dog would miss his daily biscuit.”

HE BASIC DECAY of the AHA is in its principles. For

years past, and progressively, the directors of the AHA
have shunned controversy. They have been unwilling to
advocate or ﬁght for any policy that would bring them into
conﬂict with any “respectable” group that defended or
proﬁted from the suffering of either animals or children.
This obsessive fear; of “controversy” still governs all of the
policies and program of the AHA.

For example, under extreme pressure from the whole
membership of the AHA, the AHA Board once organized
a committee against animal seizure legislation. This com-
mittee met a few times and at least some of the committee
members diligently tried to formulate a policy and program
that would unite the humane movement in opposition to
animal seizure laws. But then, when the heat from the
AHA membership had died down, the committee against

7

 




 

animal seizure legislation was allowed quietly to languish
into inactivity and then was formally killed. The AHA
now has no committee to combat animal seizure legislation
and it is notable that the AHA Board of Directors has not
even discussed this most serious problem of the whole hu-
mane movement since the old committee was killed.

It is relevant to point out, in connection with this bit of
history, that Hugh Paine, chairman of the Board of the
American SPCA, is one of the most powerful members of
the AHA Board of Directors and that until very recently
Sydney Coleman, long the president of the American SPCA,
was unquestionably the dominant member of the} AHA
Board. The directors of the American SPCA have openly
favored animal seizure legislation. The law which now
takes hundreds of dogs every year out of the shelter of the
ASPCA and hands them over to laboratories probably
never could have been enacted without tacit approval by
the ASPCA.

The “Old Guard” directors of the AHA continue to say,
whenever they are prodded into saying anything at all, that
they oppose animal seizure legislation. Any thinking hu-
manitarian will wonder, however, why that same “Old
Guard” indignantly refused, as moved by Miss Perry, to re-
quire that aﬁiliated humane societies of The American
Humane Association dispose of all animals humanely.

It has become customary, when the AHA Board is
criticized on this score, for the board to reply by calling its
critics “anti-vivisectionists.” A careful examination of the
record will show that the AHA Board never replies by dis-
cussing the issues or offering any leadership to the em-
battled local humane societies and state federations.

The fact is, of course, that almost every humane society
and every individual humanitarian in the United States op-
poses animal seizure legislation. The issue is not vivisection,
but a basic principle in the operation of any humane society.

We emphasize the poverty of principle with which the
AHA Board has met the problem of animal seizure legisla-
tion only because this is an area in which the faults of the
AHA Board can be most easily seen. The refusal of the
AHA Board to combat animal seizure legislation is not, how-
ever, the only evidence that the present AHA Board is un-
concerned about cruelty and suffering. It is a fact, publicly
asserted repeatedly by former members of the AHA Board
who are now active in the movement for reform, that the
AHA Board almost never devotes even a few minutes to dis-
cussion of any principle or problem of humane work. In its
infrequent meetings, this board spends long hours discuss-
ing the advantages of bonds over common stocks, enacting
resolutions transferring funds from one bank to another,
and discussing proﬁts and loss. It long ago reached the point
where it had virtually no time for, and no inclination for,
the direction of strategy and tactics of the American humane

movement.

 

 

 

 




Even the most casual worker in American local humane
societies can satisfy himself of the truth of these statements
by asking himself: What policy or program of the American
humane movement has ever originated in the Board of the
AHA? What leadership from the AHA, on any from of the
battle against cruelty, is felt in any local humane society?
What help has the American Humane Association given to
any local humane society since November of 1954?

WE said above that we know why the directors of the
AHA so desperately cling to the power to continue their
do-nothingness, that they are willing to wreck the AHA by
expelling its 3,000 members and scores of its constituent
societies. Having presented the background, we can now
give our explanation of the phenomenon of a small group of
entrenched men and women who are ﬁghting to retain the
power to do nothing.

We charge that the motivation in this seemingly para-
doxical situation is pure selﬁshness.

We charge that what the American humane movement
is witnessing and combating is a conspiracy by the highly
paid professional managers of a few organizations with 7-
ﬁgure endowments (and some of them with 7-ﬁgure in-
comes) to protect their personal interests. These men
dominate the present board of directors of the AHA.

Some of the professional managers of smaller societies
have been hoodwinked into identifying their interests with
those of the ruling group, but many of these men, among
whom are some of the genuine and most able humane work-
ers of the country, are increasingly discovering that the men
with the 5-digit salaries have no intention of giving any kind
of help to the men or the societies below them in the eco-
nomic scale.

The handful of heavily endowed big organizations that
now control the AHA do not need nor do they want any help
from the AHA. They want only to be sure that the AHA
is under their control and will not interfere with anything
that they do.

If they ﬁnd it expedient to give dogs and cats to labora-
tories (as some of them do) they want the AHA so well
under their control that it will never object.

If they wish to charge full commercial prices for any
medical or surgical help given to suﬁering animals in their
clinics, refusing all charity to the sufferers (as some of them
d0), they want to be sure that the AHA will never expose
them nor suggest that their policies are something less than
those of the ideal humane society.

If they wish to spend thousands of dollars on construc-
tion of handsome ofﬁces for their executives, (as some of
them do), they want to be sure that the AHA will maintain
a benign silence.

And if some of them are sending out dog catchers to

9

 




 

 

seize children’s pets while refusing to send ambulances to
pick up animals injured by motor cars (as some of them
are), they want to be sure that such policies will not be dis-
cussed by the Board of Directors of the AHA.

We say to all of the hundreds of honest, conscientious
local humane societies in the United States that want an
equally conscientious and honest national federation, that
they must end the present control of the AHA by the pres-
ent oligarchy of high-salaried sinecure holders. The Ameri-
can humane movement will not move forward until the AHA
is returned to the control of men and women who work in
and understand the terrible problems that face every local
worker. '

A vote for the “Old Guard” of the AHA Board is
a vote to stray further from the basic principles of
the humane movement, and it is a vote against giving
to hundreds of local humane societies the help that
they so desperately; need.

PROPONENTS of the selﬁsh oligarchy that now rules the

AHA have issued several statements since the AHA Con-
vention of last year which attempt to make it sound as
though some sort of unruly and illegitimate rabble took
charge of that Convention. The fact is, of course, that every
person who voted in that convention was a legal and legiti-
mate voting member of the AHA or was a legal and legiti-
mate representative of a local society affiliated with the
AHA. At the convention was the largest proportion of
AHA’s membership that had attended any AHA convention
in all of the organization’s history.

The meeting was conducted under the rulings of a pro-
fessional parliamentarian who was engaged by the AHA
Board.

The vote was counted by tellers appointed by the AHA
Board.

A clean cut issue was presented to the members and so-
ciety representatives present and they responded by voting
overwhelmingly against the do-nothingness of the “Old
Guard.”

It appears that the majority of the AHA Board does not
like the kind of democratic and representative meeting that
was held at Atlanta. The Board majority appears to prefer
the kind of meeting that they planned for Seattle ——- a meet-
ing at which it would be almost impossible for an average
AHA member or society to exercise the right to a vote. It
is perfectly clear that the AHA Board majority chose Seattle
for its special meeting to amend the by-laws because a spe-
cial trip to Seattle would be so expensive for most AHA
members and the smaller humane societies that they would
be unable to attend. In the quiet of a smoke-ﬁlled room, the
AHA Board intended, the by-laws would be amended by vote

of the bigger societies and a handful of people on expense
accounts.

ECAUSE of the confusion in AHA affairs resulting from

the undemocratic actions of the AHA Board, it is im-
possible at this time to foresee all steps that must be taken
to save the association. It is by no means certain that the
AHA Board has revealed all of the steps it plans to deprive
the AHA membership of a vote.

In addition, several groups of AHA members are con-
templating various avenues of legal action to protect mem-
bership rights.

One thing, however, is absolutely vitally important—all
AHA members, and all member societies, must maintain
their AHA membership, in good standing, and plan now to
attend the annual meeting of the AHA that is scheduled
to be held in Grand Rapids, Michigan, this autumn.

The summary of the situation is this:

I. The need for drastic reform of the American
Humane Association has become even more appar-
ent and more necessary than it was last year;

2. The “old guard” majority of the AHA Board
has revealed its lack of humane principles by ﬂatly
refusing, in a record vote, to require that member
humane societies dispose of animals humanely;

3. Desperately ﬁghting to keep control of the
potential power and the huge endowment of our
national federation, a few highly-paid job holders
are trying by trickery to take voting rights away
from thousands of AHA members;

4. It has been made clear that if the plot to alter
the basic structure of the AHA succeeds, or if the
“old guard” is left in control, the AHA will con-
tinue to be a “do nothing” organization, providing
no assistance to local humane societies and offering
no leadership to the humane movement.

5.. To save the AHA, the members of the AHA
must protect their rights—by legal action if neces-
sary—and then the membership must appear at the
Grand Rapids annual meeting and vote for reform.

If anyone has any doubt about the right and the wrong
in this situation, we suggest a simple way of settling the
problem. Ask yourself: “How would a suffering animal
vote?” Would the animal vote to leave the AHA in the

11

 




hands of the people now in control? Or would the animal
vote for people who pledge themselves to place the ﬁght
against cruelty above everything else?

Remember: this year, in the AHA, you have a
chance to vote for those who cannot vote for them-
selves!

SAVE THE A. H.A. I

If you are opposed to animal seizure legislation

. a

If you are opposed to the plan to restrict new A.H.A. membership to persons

who contribute $500 or more

If you believe that the A.H.A. should ﬁght ALL forms of cruelty and not

VOTE FOR THE INDEPENDENT SLATE
MARTHA FLANAGAN, ROBERT LINDSTROM, AND CHRISTINE STEVENS

Are you confused by the charges, counter-charges and falsehoods that
have been circuiated on behalf of the A.H.A. Board in recent months? This
deliberate attempt to create confusion is part of a desperate effort by
the present maiority of the A.H.A. Board to retain complete control of
the organization.

In July they tried to disfranchise 9O°/O of the membership. They were
prevented only because a Federal Judge enioined them from holding the
Seattle meetingJ’he Judge characterized their actions as subterfuge and

 

condemned them wholeheartedly. They had still managed to keep secret

 

the fact that they had enrolled 102 new members in Seattle to pack that
meeting.

Since the Atlanta convention, 240 new members have been added
in the states of Washington, California and Oregon, considerably more
than all of the members who attended the Atlanta convention! Sincere
old members would have had no chance at Seattle. Don’t support a Board
that wants to get rid of you.

DO NOT BE MISLED BY FALSE ISSUES AND PROPAGANDA

 

THE ISSUE IS: WILL THE A.H.A. TAKE A VIGOROUS STAND AGAINST

ANIMAL SEIZURE LEGISLATION AND ONCE MORE BECOME THE LEADER
OF THE HUMANE MOVEMENT IN THE UNITED STATES?

 

Bring this about by voting the straight independent slate and
by voting NO on the proposed amendments to the by-laws.

You have probably received a communication
from the Board of the American Humane Associa—
tion which includes a purported summary of the
meeting of the Board on August 19.. This sum-
mary carefully obscures the real meaning and ef-
fect of the action that the inner circle of the
Board has taken. _
It is obvious that this policy would be a calam-
itous handicap to the growth, inﬂuence and useful-
ness of the entire American humane movement.
To understand the real signiﬁcance of actions. by
the Board at its Chicago meeting, it must be re-
called that in July a United States District Court
ruled that the willful majority of the AHA Board
has been acting unlawfully. The court enjoined
the Board against proceedings with plans to rail-

road radical by—law amendments through a gerry-_

mandered special meeting in Seattle. ,

The proposed by-law amendments would have
put 90 per cent of us, the AHA members, entirely
out of our Association. The unlawful special

 

 

  
  
 
  
  
 
 

  
  
  
 
 

 

meeting was planned to turn over control of our ‘.

organization, in perpetuity, to a mere handful of
people —— people who seem to some of us to be
more concerned about power, payrolls, and per-
sonal prestige than about the prevention of cruelty.

(In an earlier “Message to Humanitarians” we. ‘ '
explained the motives that have driven the inner

circle of the Board to resist all attempts to en-

large and re-activate our Association. If you did '
not receivethat Message, we will send a copy to,

you upon request.) .

The willful majority of the Board revealed, in
the August 19 meeting, that it has not given up the
objectives that the Federal court said it was pur-

suing by unlawful means. The Board majority is '

still trying to achieve the same ends.

The majority of the Board are still determined:

1. To prevent the American Humane Association
from becoming an effective, strong and vital
force in the humanitarian movement.

2. To perpetuate themselves in control, regard-
less of the wishes of the members.

3. To exclude all new members, and to permit
humanitarians to be members of the Associa-
tion only to the minimum extent clearly forced

‘ upon them by the law. - ‘

The three independent directors who were elect.-

ed by the members at the 1954 meeting, Naramore,
Perry and Smith, resolutely opposed the new ef-
forts by the majority to dominate our Association,
stop its growth and paralyze its activities. They
brought home the fact that the United States DiS-'
trict Court has forcefully declared that the direct-
ors should not circumvent democratic processes as
the majority unsuccessfully tried to do in calling
a Special Meeting of members in Seattle to adopt
arfnend'ed «by-laws which would disfranchise 90%
0‘ us. . ‘

They were able to prevent the passage Of. two A

resolutions which had been carefully prepared. in
advance by the f‘inside” group. . w w

 

    

    

First, a resolution was defeated which proposed
removing the Annual Meeting to be held on Oc-
tober 31 of this year from Grand Rapids to an-
other place less convenient for most of the mem-
bers.

The Annual Meeting this year will remain at
Grand Rapids.

Second, a resolution was defeated providing that
“no further notice of expiration of membership
will be sent to . . . members of the Association”
after a single notice to be sent to those whose
membership expired after last December 1.

This resolution, although it was defeated, again
reveals the basic thinking of the inside group:
They would like to get rid of us as members——
although they have no objection to our contribu-
tions! Fortunately, on motion of Mr. Naramore,
this resolution was tabled. _

However, the majority passed three resolutions
designed to accomplish the same purpose of reduc-
ing the number of voting members: (1) No new
members who join after August 18 may vote at the
Annual Meeting on October 31; (2) Any member
whose membership has expired on or before Sep-
tember 30 and whose dues are not received by
September 30 will be dropped from membership;
(3) In the future, no person may become a mem-
ber of the Association entitled to vote unless he
or she has contributed at least $500.

You will note that the effect of the ﬁrst two res-
olutions is this: The majority of the Board, hav-
ing been forced by order of the Court to abandon
its scheme to hold a gerrymandered meeting of
members at Seattle, has taken action to reduce the
number of members who may be able to vote at
the regular Grand Rapids meeting. ,

At that meeting, they propose to, go ahead with
the election of their three hand-picked nOminees
for the Board to oppose the candidates who will
be nominated by members. They also propose 'to
force through the adoption of their amended by-
laws.

We ask each 0f you to check the status of your
membership. Be sure you have paid your dues. If
you have not yet paidyour dues, 'be sure to pay be-
fore September 30. Be sure you are eligible to vote
at the October 31 meeting, regardless of how you
vote. ' ‘

The third resolution — providing that voting
membership in the Association will hereafter-be
open only to applicantswho pay $500 -——- took the
form of an amendment to the proposed amended
by-laws. It can become effective only'if the mem-
bership approve ,it at the Grand. Rapids meeting.
Those proposed by—laws must be defeated. The
humane movement must not be allowed to become
a closed society. , .

They originally proposed, as you know, to bring
about a quick end, in one: sudden blow, to partici-
pation by existing members by eliminating 90% ‘of‘
us —— all who have not paid $500. They now pro.-
pose to accomplish the same purpose by a more

   




gradual process of excluding new recruits unless
they pay this large sum.

We must not permit this to happen. we must
defeat the proposed amended by-laws, by attending
the Grand Rapids meeting on October 31 and voting
against them. We must elect new directors at that
meeting who are dedicated to recruiting more mem-
bers —-— not to excluding persons — and to the ex—
pansion and reinvigora-tion of the humane move-
ment.

It is now or never! The inside group have con-
cocted a scheme by which the Grand Rapids meet-
ing will be conﬁned to those who have paid their
dues by September 30. Unless those members turn
out for the Grand Rapids meeting and defeat the
proposed amended by-laws and elect three inde—
pendent directors, there may be no way in the
future for the members to regain control of our
Association. The Association, as you know, is of
fundamental importance to the development —— or
the non-development —— of humanitarianism in this
country. It must be controlled by its members, by
persons who believe in more humane work, more
recruits, and more dedication to the ﬁght against
inhumane practices.

The inside group which controls the Board has
made it clear that it will adopt every possible means
to achieve its objectives, to perpetuate its control
of our Association and gradually to strangle its
activities. Using the Association’s funds, the “in-
siders” will wage an intensive campaign to bring
to Grand Rapids people who will vote their way.
They will try to divide and conquer by setting
group against group. They will attack the motives
of those who take the lead against them, and will
charge them with secret and unworthy motives.

We are conﬁdent that you will not be deceived
by this campaign, and that you will not lose sight
of the true issues:

Do we want the resources, organization and pres-
tige 0f the American Humane Association to be
used to promote a vigorous, expanding, national
humanitarian movement?

Do we want a democratic organization, operated
on democratic principles and welcoming and seek-
ing new members who will enlist in the cause?

Or do we want to perpetuate an inside group and .
to arm them with by-laws of their own concoction, .
dedicated not to the cause of increasing and im-
proving humane work, but to assuring their own
restrictive control?

If you wish to join with us, we should like to
have you ﬁll out the enclosed card and mail it to
me, unless you have already done so. It involves
no obligation. It merely indicates your general
approval and support.

In any event, be sure: Pay your dues before Sep-
tember 30 . Attend the Grand Rapids meeting on
October 31 . We hope you will vote against the
amended by-laws and (candidates supported by the
inside group: But by all means, attend and vote.

NICHOLAS P. CHOLIS, Chairman.

STATEMENT OF LARRY ANDREWS, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LEAGUE, INC.
BEFORE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE, SENATE FACT FINDING COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC
HEALTH AND SAFETY, IN OPPOSITION T0 PROPOSED LEGISLATION REQUIRING THE
RELEASE OF UNCLAIMED, IMPOUNDED ANIMALS FOR USE IN SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH,
AT HEARING HELD SEPT. 6, 1966, STATE OFFICE BUILDING, LOS ANGELES, CALIF.

+ + + +
Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee:

I am Larry Andrews, President of The National Humanitarian League with headquarters in
Phoenix, Arizona. I have been a resident of that state for so many years I can recall when
we had no water and you had no smog. Now, thanks to help from California, we may get more
water, and with no help from you at all, soon we may have as much smog.

I am appearing before this committee at the request of some of our officers and members
who are residents of this state. As a matter of fact, The National Humanitarian League has
more members in California than in any other state. I have been coming here and assisting
dozens of animal protective organizations and appearing before various city councils for
nearly a score of years, so I feel at home.

You are considering a proposal here today which rightly has been called "animal seizure
legislation." The animal protection movement has been fighting this kind of legislation for
the last 20 years. Most animal protection societies hold that it is morally wrong for them
to make available any animal in their care for the purposes of vivisection. Every humane
society and every SPCA in this country that operates animal shelters have clauses in their
pet adoption agreements that anyone taking a pet from the shelter will not under any circum-
stances ever permit that pet to be used for any kind of experiment. We must, therefore,
recognize that the type of legislation being considered here today raises a moral issue
which has nothing to do with the ultimate goal of anti—vivisection societies. The fact is
that enactment of such legislation cannot possibly have any adverse effect on the program
of The National Humanitarian League or any other anti~vivisection society. Before I discuss
this moral issue, permit me to briefly review the history of animal seizure legislation.

In 1929, the late George Arliss, one of the greatest dramatic actors of this century
and a dedicated humanitarian, along with Clarence E. Richard, who is present at this
hearing, organized The National Anti—Vivisection Society, with headquarters in Chicago,
adding two powerful leaders to this movement. It can be truthfully said that these men--
particularily Mr. Richard--brought to the movement an aggressive, intelligent leadership,
such as has been rarely seen since the days of the great Henry Bergh, who founded the
animal protection movement in this country just 100 years ago. Since 1929, Mr. Richard has
carried on an intensive educational program on the reasons why vivisection should be abol-
ished, with the result that millions of Americans learned for the first time what takes
place in the vivisection laboratories.

This educational program alarmed and aroused those medical researchers engaged in
vivisection; particularily Dr. Anton Carlson, of the University of Chicago. It was he who
started the movement in 1946 to combat what he called "A-V propaganda." He was spurred on
by some of the big eastern medical schools, particularily the Harvard University school
which had been soundly defeated by the Animal Rescue League of Boston in its effort to
obtain unclaimed dogs from that organization which was serving as the Boston municipal
pound. That had been the first open attempt to compel the surrender of unclaimed animals
from municipal pounds in this country and the medical schools correctly blamed the anti-
vivisectionists for their defeat.

Dr. Carlson wrote to leading physiologists in the nation‘s universities proposing they
assist in organizing and financing what he called a "national commission for the protection
of medical sciences.”These letters were mailed out in January, 1946, and among those asked

to help, was the late Dr. Robert Gesell, then head of the department of physiology at the
University of Michigan at Ann Arbor.

Dr. Gesell endorsed the purposes of the organization; enlisted the support of others,
and helped to raise the money to finance it. However, he wrote Dr. Carlson a word of warning
and advice. He said, and I quote from his letter which was introduced into evidence before
a House Committee of the U.S. Congress:

"15 the math 06 the commLLLLon.LL wett done, Lt tht be a gneat contanutLon to
the bLoLochdt AcLenceL, 50L we need a compnehenALve educatLon 05 att concehned. In

LLhety to tugged. It LL my expetLence.thdt theme ate atwaya a numben 05 at amo may be
too Lane 05 man’ A pLLvLLege to expeeoment on the Lowen.60hnw."

There was more in that letter but time is too limited here to read all of it and add
the necessary comment. The result of that exchange of correspondence was the formation of
the National Society for Medical Research, the most blatant propaganda organization in the
country. It is dedicated to the promotion by any and every means of the practice of vivi-
section without restraint, and the utter destruction of the animal protection movement
in America.

The National Society for Medical Research is our enemy. It has no scruples about the
means to be employed in achieving its objectives. It firmly believes in unrestricted
vivisection and believes that the end justifies the means. Its staff is skillful in
propaganda techniques and uses them with such cunning that hundreds of newspapers and
other periodicals have published without change articles that bore little semblance to
the truth. It follows two lines without deviation. One line is that medical research can
do no wrong; the other is that animal protection societies that take issue with it are
"anti-science" and must be destroyed.

For a long time, the National Society for Medical Research met with little opposition.
Animal seizure legislation was passed in the states of Minnesota and Wisconsin with only
token resistance by the American Humane Association. That organization was so certain that
the legislation was unconstitutional that it relied on a suit in Wisconsin to test the law's
constitutionality. When the Wisconsin courts upheld the law, the American Humane Association
dropped the fight. Now, another national humanesociety has announced it will test the
constitutionality of animal seizure laws. But, the views of the nation's courts on the
Constitution have changed and who knows what is or is not constitutional? Naturally, the
vivisectors lauded the court decisions upholding animal seizure laws, but if the trend
“continues, even the practice of medicine may be placed under rigid government control.
Freedom is a two-way street, and if the National Society for Medical Research continues
to be successful in its campaign to destroy the freedom of animal protection societies
to operate without legislative barriers such as the one under discussion here today,
then ALL freedom will have suffered a mortal blow.

The American humane movement found itself in a crisis early in 1950 from which it has
not recovered. The City of Los Angeles enacted an animal seizure ordinance after the
American Humane Association refused to throw its then great influence on the side of
local organizations against the ordinance. If the movement had stood together and taken an
uncompromising stand, we could have won and emerged stronger and our enemy, the National
Society for Medical Research would have lost its campaign to destroy us. But we wavered.
Too many of our leaders were afraid that by taking a firm stand they would be tarred by
the NSMR's brush and stigmitized as anti-vivisectionists.

 

 
   




  

, Dr. Gesell discovered too late that he had helped to open a Pandora's box by organ121no
the National Society for Medical Research. On April 15,1952 he delivered a short paper
before members of the American Physiological Society. I desire at this time to read what
this noted vivisector had to say for the record being compiled by this fact finding committee:

Let me impress upon this committee that Dr. Gesell was no anti-vivisectionist.
To the contrary, he was a vivisector and headed one of the largest vivisection laboratories
in the nation's universities. I cannot emphasize too strongly that this was the very
first time in the conflict between the American humane movement and the National Society
for Medical Research that a leading scientist dared to take issue with the powerful NSMR.

At that time, I was the national field director for the American Humane Association.
Dr. Gesell read his statement at a closed meeting of the physiological scientists. It was
kept secret for some months after that. At the annual convention of the American Humane




---4---

Association held in Boston in October of that same year, the association authorized a Special ,
committee to draft and implement a plan to oppose the drive for animal seizure legislation.

I was made a member of that committee. So was Mrs. Roger Stevens, of Ann Arbor and New York.
Mrs. Stevens is the wife of Roger Stevens,-Democratic party leader and adviser to several
presidents, including President Johnson. BUT-«she also is the daughter of the late Dr.

Gesell.

At the first meeting of the committee named by the American Humane Association in the
Hotel Commodore in New York, I was conferring with Mrs. Stevens when she showed me a c0py
of Dr. Gesell's statement. I quickly saw its value to the-humane movement and asked her
if she could secure her father's permission for us to print the statement in the NATIONAL
HUMANE REVIEW, the official publication of the American Humane Association. She said she
thought her father would be glad to see the statement published. Within a week, I received
a copy of the statement with written permission from Dr. Gesell to publish it. We did, and
it had a profound effect on the humane movement. It was reprinted by the National Anti-
Vivisection Society and others, and thus gained millions more readers.

You can imagine how this was received by the National Society for Medical Research.
It and The American Physiological Society strongly objected to Dr. Gesell's views and to
their publication by humane organizations. Dr. Gesell resented being called an anti-
vivisectionist and publicly stated that anti-vivisection societies had not been given
permission to publish his statement. He was only technically correct because it was not
c0pyrighted and thus was in the public domain when it was published by the American Humane
Association. It can never be restricted as to publication for it is now a part of the
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD; is public property, and is now a part of the record of this hearing.

Dr. Gesell's public statement castigating anti-vivisection societies for publishing
his statement, did not appease the American Physiological Society. A committee loaded
with National Society for Medical Research proponents was appointed and Dr. Gesell was
put on trial. What happened in that inquisition has never been made public. We do know
that one of those who opposed Dr. Gesell was Dr. Maurice Visscher, president of the
physiological society and himself a vivisector for nearly a half century. It was at this
trial of Dr. Gesell that Dr. Visscher replied to Dr. Gesell's statement with this creed:

"Thene can be no caueﬂty'in the puaAuii’oﬁ knowﬂedge."

If you consider this to be an astounding statement for a distinguished medical
scientist to make, it is nothing compared to his incredible performance before the
Congressional hearing on legislation to regulate vivisection. At that hearing on Sept. 29,
1962, Dr. Visscher told the Congressional committee that there is a sharp distinction
between the care and treatment of animals in research facilities and research itself. He
told that committee that he strongly approved "ﬁaWM paomoting the humane theaiment 06
animatb"..."Caue£ty.to animuta LA a caome," he said, "and Ahouﬂd be punished whethet
the cuﬂpnit is a pet ownea, a gammea, a Inuchen, on a Acientibt." He went on to say that
if animals were neglected or mistreated by those charged with their care, the perpetrators
should be punished. But, he made it crystal clear that once the animal was in the hands
of a research scientist for eXperimentation, there can be no cruelty. In other words,

a kennelman can be cruel to a dog in a laboratory by beating it, but no matter what the
vivisector does, no cruelty is involved. And that is the philosophy behind legislation in
most of our states which Specifically exempts those who experiment upon animals from
prosecution on charges of cruelty to animals.

Dr. Visscher is, or was at that time, a noted physiologist at the University of
Minnesota. He was one who pushed for the enactment of that state's animal seizure law. He
was present at the legislative hearing on that bill when Dr. Donald Meek said:

 




   
  
  

---5---

 
 

"No agony ta too acute to tnﬁttct upon an tnﬁtntte nwmben 06 andmatt t5,
tn the Optnton 05 the teatt membea 05 any medtcat ﬂacutty, theae ts the attghteat
chance 06 addtng to the Aum 05 human hnowtedge-~and thtt wtthout aegeaence to the
question 05 whethea such addttton ts tthety to pnoue oﬁ any paacttcat use on not."

 
   
   
   
 

  

I submit to this committee that we are up against the most evil phiIOSOphy that has
been advanced since the days of Marx and Engels. Here we have a double standard of morals.
I, a plain citizen, can be punished under the laws of ANY state for an act of cruelty.
But, no matter how horrible, any acts by scientists are not cruel if they are performed
in the pursuit of knowledge. The ends, they say, justify the means.

  
   
        
   
  
 

  

This state legislature is being asked by the National Society for Medical Research
to help it in its unrelenting campaign to destroy the American humane movement by enacting
this piece of morally wrong legislationu-which would give vivisectors the right to
requisition from any animal shelter as many animals as they want. Or, as Dr. Gesell put

it so well, this law would "pnovtde an tnexhautttbte numben 05 antmatt to an even gammtng
caowd 05 caaeea Actenttatt with but ttttte btotogtcat bachguound and scant tnteaeot tn the
ﬁutunc 05 man."

 
 
     
      
 
  

  

This proposal is put forward as being essential to medical pregress; essential for the
saving of human lives. The legislators of this state are being told that unless this
proposal is enacted into law, medical progress will be halted; that vital research into

the causes of cancer, heart diseases-~in fact, just about every ailment of man except the
common cold—nwill be gravely endangered if not brought to a standstill.

     
   
  
    
   
 
  
  
 
    
  
  
  
  
 
   
 

Don’t you believe one word of it. If this proposal is rejected, as it should be, it
will not deprive the vivisectors of one animal. We are not fighting this proposal—-this
legislation~min the hope that we can abolish vivisection, or even reduce it. We know better
than hat. Let me cite you an example right here in California.

In November of 1961, the Stanford University Medical School urged the Palo Alto City
Council to enact an ordinance that would require the Palo Alto Humane Society to surrender
unclaimed animals to the medical school for vivisection. This was one of those occasions
when California humanitarians asked me to come over and help them oppose the ordinance.
When I arrived in Palo Alto it appeared that our cause already was lost.

One of the first things I did was talk with newsmen. A reporter told me that Stanford
was putting on so much pressure behind the scenes that the council was certain to enact
the ordinance. In polling the council I found that four were committed to vote for the
ordinance; four said they would vote against it, and seven were undecided.

Not since the humane society had been established had any animal ever been given to the
university. Nor were any animals ever obtained from other humane societies and SPCA's in
the stateo Yet, each year Stanford used more and more animals. Council members told me that
Stanford had told the council that unless the ordinance was passed, it would be necessary to
halt important research projects.

 

I was able to convince a number of the undecided councilmen that such statements
were false. I insisted that what Stanford wanted was a bargain basement near at hand
providing a big supply of cheap animals. I recall that while talking to one young,
influential councilman who had graduated from Stanford with honors, he stopped me while
he made a phone call. He talked with a friend at the university and got confirmation that
if the ordinance was rejected Stanford would go right ahead with its full research program.

Less than an hour before the Palo Alto council was scheduled to meet and vote on the
ordinance, Stanford University withdrew the proposed ordinance and the mayor announced

    




i-_6-_-

that fact when the meeting opened. The large council room was packed and scores of persons
were standing outside at open doors. Before the mayor could complete his statement, a
tremendous burst of applause drowned out his words.

That was nearly five years ago and I tell you now that if you investigate, the records
will show that Stanford has not reduced its vivisection program by as much as a Single
animal, but has increased it.

It was the National Society for Medical Research that came up with the argument that
since unclaimed dogs in animal shelters are put to sleep they should be used instead for
"the benefit of mankind." The NSMR calls this policy of humane societies, a "senseleSS'
waste.” It has no compunction at all about converting havens of mercy, built by the
contributions of peeple who Oppose cruelty-~many of them anti-vivisectionistse~into
collection depots for the vivisection laboratories.

The NSMR once proposed that legal means be sought to divert legacies made by anti~
vivisectionists to anti—vivisection societies, over to medical research. Nor is this all.
The NSMR has proposed that the Nuremberg Code be amended. This is the code that was intended
to prevent vivisection upon humans without their knowledge and consent. There are many
research scientists~~vivisectors--who insist that causes and cures for disease will not
be found without experimentation upon human beings. Their argument is a familar one~~the
end justifies the means.

I will tell you something else. The California Legislature will be asked to enact
another bill prepared by the National Society for Medical Research, if it has not already
been asked. It is not enough that California was one of the first states to pass a law
allowing persons to will their bodies or body parts for medical use.

The National Society for Medical Research has drafted a bill that would permit medical
schools to claim the bodies of unidentified persons in morgues, and even the bodies of
indigents also buried at public expense. In an article published in READER’S DIGEST not
long ago, the National Society for Medical Research complained about the shortage of
cadavers for dissection purposes in medical schools. The article decried the spending of
an average of $250 to provide decent burial for the indigent, the unidentified, and
otherwise "unloved and unwanted” humans. The article urged state legislators to write for
copies of the bill and urge its passage.

If this sounds familar it is because this is precisely what you are now being asked
to do—-make available the lost, the "Unwanted and unloved" animals in shelters for

vivisection purposes. . ' *

Dogs today and humans tomorrow.

That is what the National Society for Medical Research wants from the California
legislature. I urge this committee to recommend that any animal seizure proposal be
rejected now as well as the body snatching preposal when that is presented to you.

LET US HAVE MERCY
ON THESE
DUMB ANIMALS

Modern methods of humane slaughter are available and in partial use. Simple
decency demands laws to enforce these methods in every state of the Union

Condensed from Together

PAUL W. KEARNEY AND RICHARD DEMPEWOLFF

ECENTLY, 0n the killing ﬂoor
R of a Midwestern slaughter-

house, we saw—and heard-—
a knocker swing his primitive sledge
hammer a dozen times before he
succeeded in stunning three fright-
ened, bellowing steers. We’ve had
the unenviable experience, in an
antiquated pork abattoir, of obserV—
ing a poorly stuck pig shoved into
the scalding tank while still fully
conscious. We’ve seen lambs and
calves, shackled and hanging head
down, bleed to death in the same
unstunned state.

This medieval brutality is strange—
ly out of place in the 20th century
in a nation which professes the high-
est ideals of humane treatment for

animals. Yet, in many of the 3000 or
more small slaughterhouses scat—
tered from Iohnson Street in Brook— '
lyn to Townsend Street in San
Francisco, such grisly practices are
far from uncommon.

What makes the situation even
more deplorable is that since Au—
gust 30, 1960, we have had in opera-
tion the Humane Slaughter Act, a
federal law which prescribes that
livestock must be made insensible
“by a single blow, gunshot, electric,
chemical or other rapid means be—
fore they are shackled, hoisted, cast,
thrown or cut.”

This law came 84 years after
Switzerland enacted similar legisla—
tion, and long after a dozen other

Pub. House, 740 N. Rush St., Chicago 11,111.

 




THE READER’S DIGEST

countries—and the Fiji Islands—
abolished needless slaughterhouse
cruelty. Yet it is hardly more than a
step in the right direction. It carries
no criminal penalties for violators.
It affects only some 500 packers
who sell meat to the federal govern—
ment. These large houses account
for roughly 80 percent of all livestock
killed commercially each year for
meat — more than 100 million head.
But this leaves some 25 million ani—
mals a year that can still be clubbed,
or shackled head down, alive and
kicking until bled to death, in 2500
smaller packing plants.

In any plant, good or bad, the
meat animal is dispatched by cutting
its throat or otherwise severing its
carotid arteries—because it must be
bled as Well as killed. But the man—
ner in which the creature is brought
to this point is the crux of the prob—
lem.

Because of their size and strength,
cattle must be rendered unconscious
ﬁrst. In many abattoirs this is ac—
complished with a sledge hammer
or maul in the hands of a powerful

man who stands on a platform and 7

belts each animal on the forehead as
it enters the knocking pen. If the
aim is true, the stunned beast rolls
out on the killing floor for the re—
mainder of the procedure. But if the
steer shies and the sledge misses its
mark, a jaw may be broken, an eye
gouged, or some other painful in—
jury inflicted. In this case, the ani—
mal is thrown into complete panic.
The task of stunning it than needs
no elaboration.

The first step in handling sheep,
hogs and sometimes calves is shack—
ling. A shackler slips a chain noose
around one of the animal’s hind
legs, and the beast is hoisted aloft
head down—smoothly and quietly
if all goes well, or with a .bone—
cracking yank if the animal turns
the wrong way or catches a leg

under the door of the shackling

box. Then, ﬁghting frantically, the ,

unfortunate creature is carried by
one leg on an endless chain to the
sticker, whose job is to slip a stiletto
into the struggling animal’s throat
without amputating his own hand.
This preposterous manhandling
causes a bedlam of hysterical animal
screams and squeals, which utterly
panics incoming victims.

Such cruelty should not have
required legislation to remedy. Expe—
rience in Europe with electric stun—
ning, as well as the exemplary work
of a few big U.S. packers, should
have provided ample evidence of
the advantages of more modern
methods. At the George A. Hormel
& Co. plant in Austin, Minn., for
example, 1200 hogs per hour are
handled without animal agony or
human risk. This is accomplished
by means of two ingenious carbon—
dioxide immobilizers (a company
invention), installed in 1950.

The animals are led single ﬁle
along a rubber—lined passage into a
chamber where they WhiH C02. The
gas anesthetizes them for 25 seconds.
They roll onto a conveyer that car—
ries them, silent and still, to the
stickers. Gone are the furor and

LET US HAVE MERCY ON THESE DUMB ANIMALS

panic which formerly made them so
unmanageable. Proof of the system’s
economic advantage is the fact that
Hormel has now installed it in all
the company’s plants.

Another simple but effective de-
vice has been in use for 14 years at
the Oscar Mayer Co., of Madison,
Wis. Here it is a “captive—bolt stun—
ner” that renders animals insensible.
Long used in European slaughter—
houses to replace the sledge hammer,
this tool is a sort of hand—gun actu—
ated by either a powder charge or
compressed air. Instead of a free—fly—
ing bullet, its projectile is a bolt fas—
tened to the frame. After each shot
the bolt is returned to the barrel,
much as is the cork in a popgun.

Like so many progressive ideas,
the captive—bolt stunner ran into a
barrage of objections from many
slaughterers. One major criticism
was that the device didn’t prevent
animals from arriving at the knock—
ing pen in an excited, head—tossing
state. How could you hold cattle still
enough to use the instrument?

Then, a few years ago, foreman
Harold Watson, at the Seitz Pack—
ing Co., in St. Joseph, Mo., had an
idea. He had often noticed how
deer and other wild animals stand
transﬁxed by the beam of an auto—
mobile’s headlights. Why wouldn’t
cattle in a slaughterhouse react to
light in the same way?

Floodlights installed at bull’s—eye
level at the end of the Seitz pens
quickly proved that they would.
Even excited steers led into the
knocking box suddenly stood stock—

still, staring into the beam. Where—
upon the knocker could perform his
job humanely, and therefore swiftly
and economically.

Despite the advantages of the cap‘
tive—bolt stunner demonstrated by
Mayer,.Seitz and a progressive
group of small packers who have
used the technique voluntarily for
years, the device has been remark—
ably slow in catching on. A sizable
number of small packers have pro—
claimed unwillingness to invest in
any new methods until they are
forced to do so by local legislation.

Complicating the picture from the
outset has been the fact that kosher
slaughterers have opposed reform
on religious grounds. The ritual of
kosher killing prescribes that an ani—
mal must arrive clean, whole and
unblemished at the point Where the
rabbi makes the ﬁnal thrust. Ortho—
dox rabbis and kosher packers have
interpreted this to mean that the ani—
mal must be conscious, and they
have insisted that the rugged shack—
ling and hoisting alive, even of
full—grown cattle, is the only prac—
tical means to comply with Hebrew
law.

Hence the new federal legislation
provides exceptions for ritual pack—
ers. And many small non—kosher
packers have lined up behind the
religious groups, arguing, “If they
don’t have to, why should we?”

But a few months ago Canada
Packers, Ltd., of Toronto, came up
with a device that will enable kosher
packers to abandon shackling and
hoisting of living cattle and still

 




THE READER’S DIGEST

comply with religious doctrine. It
is a plain steel box into which the
animal is led or prodded. As a
padded gate shuts behind him, it
nudges him forward so that his head
and neck protrude through a win—
dow at the other end. Here the cut
is made quickly and cleanly.

This simple, inexpensive holding
pen is the ﬁrst known humane han—
dling device to get orthodox rabbini—
cal approval in the United States.

Rabbis Eliezer Silver, nationalx

chairman of the Presidium of Ortho—
dox Rabbis, and Joseph Soloveit—
chik, of Boston, have both endorsed
it. However, few kosher packers in
the United States had shown any
interest in the device at the time this
article went to press.

The US. Senate passed the Hu—
mane Slaughter Act, by a vote of 72
to 9, after seven hours of. bitter de—
bate. Unquestionably influential in
this action was the flood of mail the
Senate had received —— tens of thou—
sands of letters from members of
humane societies, packing-house
labor unions, veterans’ organiza—
tions, church groups and women’s
clubs. Now the law needs to be
strengthened. Canada has recently

pointed the way with strict legisla—
tion covering all meat for interpro—
Vincial and export trade. The new
Canadian law, which prescribes the
use of mechanical stunning devices,
carbon—dioxide gas or electric cur—
rent to render slaughter animals
unconscious, carries criminal penal—
ties for violations.

Meanwhile, one sure way to bring
into line the thousands of small
plants presently untouched by the
federal regulation is to get action out
of the state legislatures. Bills have
been defeated recently in New York,
Michigan, Connecticut, Ohio,
Rhode Island and Tennessee. But
in California, Washington, Wiscon-
sin, New Hampshire, Minnesota
and Massachusetts, humane—slaugh—
ter laws were enacted last year. And
bills are now on the dockets of, or
being prepared in, the legislatures of
all the remaining states.

In the name of decency, don’t
these bills deserve everyone’s sup—
port?

P. O. Box 37|9

George+own S+a+ion

Washing’ron, D. C. 20007
July 14, 1967

To Humanitarians:

Good news! The United States Senate voted yesterday to appropriate
$1,200 ,000 to enforce the Laboratory Animal Welfare Act, P. L. 89-5114,
thus restoring 3/4 of the funds cut by Congressman Whitten's action in
the House of Representatives. Now the differences will have to be
resolved by a Conference Committee representing both Senate and House.
YOUR HELP IS URGENTLY NEEDED AGAIN T0 URGE ALL THE MIMBERS TO ACCEPT
THE SENATE.APPROPRIATION.

PLEASE WRITE TODAY T0 EACH LEGISLATOR LISTED AT THE BOTTCM OF THIS LETTm.
These men are expected to take part in the Conference, and their votes for
the $1,200,000 appropriation are needed.

This is a small amount when considered against the waste _o_i_' an estimated
$200 ,000,000 annually caused by _b_a__c_l_ care and housing 9;; research animals.
Dr. James H. Steele, Chief, Veterinary Public Health Section, Epidemiology
Program of the National Communicable Disease Center, United States Public
Health Service, states that appronmately 10% of research using animals is
neutralized and made unprofitable because the animals involved sicken or
die from unrelated causes. The amount of money spent on this "neutralized"
research is approximately three hundred million dollars! The U. S. tax-
payer has a right to make a strong and bitter complaint at such a waste of
his money in any field; but when it is combined, as this is, with w-
eary animal sufferin , it is absolutely intolerable.

Enforcement of humane and sanitary standards under the Laboratory Animal
Welfare Act will save hundreds of times 5132 cost 9; enforcement because
research animals will have to be decently treated if the law is obeyed
by those who sell or use the animals.

Every Conferee should vote to support the Senate appropriation for two
reasons: 1) To prevent cruelty and abuse of animals and dishonesty in
obtaining them, and 2) To save the huge sums now going down the drain in
research made useless by improper animal care and housing.

PLEASE THANK THE SENATE mews OF THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE for voting for
the $1,200,000 appropriation. PLEASE URGE THE HOUSE mats To ACCEPT THE
FULL SENATE EEcommmTIoN.

If you have not yet written to your gig Co essman, please be sure to do
so now. Ask him to do everything possible to ensure that the House Con-
ferees who represent him on the Conference Committee accept the Senate
recomendation. If you have already written him, you may, nevertheless,
wish to write him again, calling his attention to the Senate action and
asking his help.

IT IS VITAL THAT THE LABcaATORT ANIMAL WARE ACT BE STRICTLY ENFCRCED
AND THAT IT NOT BE CRIPPLED Fm LACK OF FUNDS To INSPECT _T_1_1_E ANIMALS,
THEIR CARE Aggy HOUSING.

Your response to our last letter was of great importance in obtaining
restoration of essential enforcement ﬂmds by the Senate so the humane
veterinarians of the United States Department of Agriculture can carry
out the provisions of the law. Please do everything you can now to
encourage others to join you in writing to the Conferees. The animals'
welfare depends on you and humanitarians like you to act now.

LOOphoIe for the Dognappers

When Congress enacted by over—

whelming majorities the Laboratory"
Animal Welfare Act last year, the“

public might well have concluded that
dealers supplying dogs and cats for the
research market had finally been
brought under federal control. Thefts
of pets and cruelty to these animals
supposedly were ended.

; But Congress moves in mysterious
ways. Although the Senate provided
$800,000 to carry out provisions of the
bill during fiscal 1967, hidden hostility
to this measure became apparent in the
House subcommittee on agricultural
appropriations. House members quietly
cut the total in conference to $300,000.

The result was a major crippling of
the new law. There was no money to
finance inspection of the animal dealers

by the Agriculture Department before -'

licenses were issued. So the Department
was obliged, incredible as it sounds, to
let dealers certify themselves as comply-
ing with the law.

Senator Monroney of Oklahoma,
who fought valiantly to see this law

enacted, has succinctly summed" up the.
situation. “I do not think" we want to
start off a law with self-certification,”
he testified recently, “letting people sign
an affidavit that they think their
quarters are all right. Of course they
think they are all right because they
have been doing this for years, selling
stolen dogs and keeping animals in
the most tragically inhumane quarters
with no exercise pens, and dead animals
lying around the place.”

Although damage has already been.
done, there is still a chance toUrepair
matters. The new appropriation request
for fiscal 1968 has not yet been acted
upon. Those 83 members of the Senate
and 352 members of the House who
voted for the law last year must make
certain, when this money bill comes to
the floor, that their goOd intentions
have not been frustrated by a few
legislators working behind the scenes.
The Agriculture Committee must be
given adequate funds to inspect these
dealers before they are permitted to do
business.

EXTENSION OF REMARKS

OF

HON. WILLIAM S. BROOMFIELD

OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Wednesday, May 31, 1967

Mr. BROOMFIELD. Mr. Speaker, it
has often been said that a dog is a man’s
best friend.

It is too bad that dogs have found so
few occasions to return the compliment.

However, one of those occasions was
last year when the Congress saw ﬁt to
pass into law, Public Law 89—544, an act
to regulate the transportation, sale, and
handling of dogs and cats for research
purposes.

Those of us who saw ﬁt to introduce
companion bills on this subject and who
voted so overwhelmingly for this new act
were disturbed over the instances of out-
right theft of family pets, of the mis-
treatment and maltreatment of these
animals, and the sometimes unbelievably
cruel conditions under which they were
kept and transported

Unfortunately, our concern was not
misplaced

Even now, after this law was passed,
there have been instances of dogs stolen
from homes and then, through some
mysterious grapevine, ending up under-
, going experimental operations in well-
recognized medical facilities.

One such'instance occurred last week.
It was one of the few with a happy end-
ing, not only as far as the people who

will beneﬁt from these experiments is'

concerned, but by the dog as well.

As you will note from the article which
will follow these remarks in the RECORD,
Thunder is now home with his family,“-
with only a large soar to show for his
adventures.

_ But I think that the case of what hap-
penedﬁto Thunder should be a warning
to all of us that we need full implemen-
tation of Public Law 89—544, full funding
and stafﬁng of its inspection function, so
._ that the chances of such thefts will
dwindle in the future.

I have never been a particular advo-
cate of giving money to the Agriculture
Department, but in this instance, I want
to make an exception. I want to urge
my colleagues to see to it that the full
"$1, 500, 000 appropriation for the imple-
mentation of this inspection program so
that Public Law 89—544 can do the job
that Congress intended it should.

PONTIAC FAMILY’s Doc. FOUND AT ANN ARBOR
RESEARCH LAB

(By Dave Cook)

Thunder nearly split his stitches, but after
a three-month absence from home and a
bout of major surgery, no one could blame
him.

His return was so unexpected, in fact, that
his owners—Mr. and Mrs. Jim Shorter of 280
Bondalea—were unable to restrain from in-
dulging in a few antics themselves.

“Can you blame us? We thought he was
dead," exclaimed Mrs. Shorter, a nurse’s aid
at Pontiac Osteopathic HOSpital.

“Even when the Humane Society called and
said they had our dog, I didn’t believe them,”
her husband admitted.

Thunder, 55 pounds of German shepherd-
collie, was driven to the Shorter home late
yesterday by Mrs. Dorothy Dyce, a ﬁeld in—
vestigator for the Animal Welfare Institute.

It was through the efforts of Mrs. Dyce
that the 3-year-old dog—missing since Feb-
ruary—was. located in a research laboratory
at Veterans Hospital in Ann Arbor.

On a routine visit to the lab, one of her
activities as an investigator, Mrs. Dyce no-
ticed one of the four—legged patients still
bearing a license chain—nearly buried under
heavy hair, but still there.

She jotted down the number, put in a call
to the Oakland County Animal Shelter, and
with the assistance of Pontiac’s dog—license
records, ﬁnally succeeded in tracing Thunder
to the Shorters.

Thursday night Mrs. Shorter received a call
from Mrs. Dyce and agreed to go to Ann Arbor
in order to identify Thunder.

' SQUEALING, WHINING

“It was him all right,” she said. “He started
squealing and whining as soon as he saw me.”

A large patch of bare skin on Thunder’s
left side, however, immediately caught Mrs.
Shorter’s attention.

Hospital authorities explained the dog had
undergone an operation in which one lung
was removed and then restored to its original
position.

“They told me it was for research purposes,"
Mrs. Shorter said.

WHY THE OPERATION

“What I can’t understand is how Thunder
got there and why he was operated on when
he still had identiﬁcation tags.

“He’s strictly a stay-at-home dog—can’t
imagine him even trying to get out of the
back yard.”

-Mrs. Dyce, whose work brings her into con-
tact with both laboratory personnel and hu-
mane societies, said she had determined that
Veterans Hospital had purchased Thunder
from a “reputable” Ann Arbor dog-dealer.

“They assure. me the dealer would have
nothing to do with a stolen dog or a dog
that was cared for and a family pet,” she
said.

“We are deﬁnitely going to press an investi-
gation into this, however.”

Dear Humanitarian:

Thank you very much for writing to the Secretary of Agriculture to urge
that research animals be given adequate space and opportunity for exercise.
We have waited till now to acknowledge your communication because it was
not certain whether a second set of proposed regulations would be issued
or whether they would simply be issued in final form, as required by law,
on February 2hth. 'We have just received word that, owing to the enormous
number of letters and wires, all of which have been carefully read by the
veterinarians of the Animal Health Division of the U. S. Department of
.Agriculture, the final regulations will be the next to appear. If you wish
to read them in full, let us know; and we will be glad to send you a copy
as soon as they are published.

We hope the regulations will be good ones. However, we do not know what
they will provide. As we wrote you on December 19th, most of the regula-
tions were good ones--too good in the estimation of many of the big pharma-
ceutical houses and medical schools who wrote in urging that the proposed
standards be weakened. many requests for smaller cages, less warmth, less
light, more crowding, less sanitation, less provision of water reached the
Department of.Agriculture; and hundreds of letters and telegrams from Deans
and Professors in Medical Schools strongly opposed the removal of dogs from
their cages for exercise, saying there was "no scientific evidence" to show
this was necessary. These letters show how badly the new law is needed; and
they show, too, how hard humanitarians must continue to work.

Congress must appropriate funds 39 enforce thg law. Opponents want to stymie
the law by withholding the needed funds to pay qualified veterinary inspectors
from the U. S. Department of Agriculture to inspect the animal dealers' prem-
ises and the laboratory animal quarters. Unless a supplemental appropriation
is provided, no inspectors will be able to go out to enforce the law. And
unless there is strong, popular demand, there will be no supplemental appro—
priation made by the Congress. YOUR HELP gs NEEDED!

Please write your Senators and Congressman today asking their help in
obtaining the necessary funds for the enforcement of P. L. 89-504, the
Laboratory Animal Welfare Act, by the Department of Agriculture. A list

of Senators is enclosed. Please write to those in your state; and ask
your friends to write, too. Your Congressman's name may be obtained from
your local newspaper, library, or political club. 'We musn't stop now when
help for the animals in dealers' premises and laboratories is so close. We
will keep you advised of developments. Please let us know what replies you
receive to your letters. lhanks for writing!

conclusions drawn, but to call attention to the cruelty
with which they were conducted.

’ Seven dogs were used—as a preliminary they were
operated on to. render them incapable of barking. The
animals were kept in metal screen cages, and, in the
words of the author, an attempt was made to induce
and maintain a state of chronic fear in the animals by
strong electric shocks administered to the animals
through _..specially constructed grids making up the
floor of thefcages. Combined with this form of stimula-
tion was an electric buzzer which might act either with
or independently of the shock. The stimulus was
administered by I’a mechanical device permitting some
randomisation of the intervals between the stimuli——
74 stimulations being administered within each
succeeding twelve—hour period. During the night the
grids were often short-circuited by faeces; otherwise,
the dogs were stimulated at irregular intervals night
and day. The experimental period lasted six months.

During this period an occasional break of a few days
allowed control measurements of HCl secretion to
be performed on the resting animal. Otherwise, the
arrangements for arousing in the dogs a state of
chronic fear and intermittent pain for a continuous
period of six months seem to have been effective.

Science and humanityknow no frontiers and no—one
who knows the-selﬂess devotion and humanity of our
American colleagues would doubt that a more general .
knowledge of these experiments, at present hidden in a
specialised periodical, would arouse widespread indigna-
tion. It would surely, in some degree, involve us all in
the dishonour that such practiCes cast on medical
research were we to ignore them for fear that attention
drawn to them might furniSh ammunition for un-
scrupulous arguments of anti-vivisectionists.

' LEADING ARTICLE from the “LANCET” of 6th August, 1949

Experiments on Animals.

MOST people in Great Britain regard laboratory
experiments on animals as an unpleasant necessity.
They accept the practice because so much good has
come of it ; but they have ensured by legislation that
it shall be used as sparingly as possible, kept in the
.hglldsﬂi ,thQse believed to be humane and responsible,

and safeguarded ”by 'légal restrictions from 'abuse.

This position has not been reached by following any
principle to its logical conclusion. Indeed, principles
carried to that extreme, and then used as rules of
conduct, often prove cruel or silly or both. Clearly
it is as wrong to let a child die unnecessarily of diph-
theria as it is to regard all animals as a lower creation
designed to suffer for the beneﬁt of man. Though
both attitudes can be justiﬁed on principle, both
offend our humanity. We are thus compelled to
treat this like other moral dilemmas, and pick our
way uneasily along a middle course, never wholly at
peace with our consciences, but at least sparing them
the ﬁnal outrage of one gross evil or the other.

Certainly the compromise owes nothing to callous—
ness. As long ago as 1871 the British Association for
‘the Advancement of Science resolved that no experi-
ment which can be done under an anaesthetic should
'be done without it; that no painful experiment is
justiﬁable for the mere purpose of illustratinga law
or fact. already demonstrated (i.e., such experlments
should not be used in teaching) ; and that when, to
obtain" a new fact, it is necessary to undertake a

painful experiment, every effort should be made to

ensure success, so that pain is not inﬂicted uselessly.
The Cruelty to Animals Act of 1876 was founded on
, this outline; it obliges those who wish to conduct

painful experiments, or “ any procedure calculated to
interfere with the normal health and comfort of an
animal,” to obtain a licence from the Home Secretary;

and it further requires that an animal suffering from
severe pain which is likely to endure should forthwith
be painlessly killed, whether the main object of the
experiment has been attained or not. Moreover,
there is now a well-grown opinion among scientists
that animals should not be used in large numbers for
painful experiments if the facts can .be established
equally well by the use of a few. Within this frame of
regulations and customs it is possible to limit painful
experiments to a very small proportion of experiments
as a whOle, and to ensure that the suffering experienced
is not severe or prolonged. .

‘ In other Western European countries, and in
America, though most scientists doubtless impose on
themselves the same humane scale of values, there
are not the same stringent legal safeguards. It will
always happen that the tough-minded and the
tender-minded will differ over what constitutes
suffering for others, whether humans or animals, and
there will thus always be a scatter round the mean
of ordinary practice in the conduct of experiments.
But there may also be examples at which the average
laboratory worker and the ordinary citizen alike revolt,
as is shown in our correspondence columns this week.
CHARLES DARWIN held that to inﬂict any pain which
is not absolutely necessary deserves “ detestation
and abhorrencef’ and all research-workers of integrity
subscribe to this judgment. They know that to
apply the criterion of necessity calls for unremitting
care and attention; but they also know that it can
and must be done. Since the pursuit of a new fact
can sometimes engross the mind almost completely,
they recognise that they must always be on guard;
and that wherever their keenness may have impaired
their sense of proportion they should seek the help and
criticism of colleagues. In the cases cited by our
correspondents the essential criterion was not applied.

Rafher. fhey are lawfully recognized agencies for ani-

‘ mal profecfion in California. fhe firs’r of which was

organized and incorpora’red 82 years ago. The Sfafe

Humane Associa’rion of California was founded in
I908 and incorporafed in I909.

The Sfafe Humane Associafion of California is
opposed fo fhe basic principle involved in any pron
posed law or laws which would requirefhe surrender
of animals from public animal shelfers for any purpose
which is nof for ’rhe benefif of fhe animals released.
including fhe purpose of experimenfafion.

The esfablished principle of public animal shelfers‘

is af once fhe removal of los’r. ‘sfray or abandoned
animals from public places fo comfor’rable safekeep-
ing. fhe mainfenance of such animals unfil fhey can
be refurned fo fheir owners. placed in new homes. or
humanely des’rroyed. and af fhe same fime. fhe pro-
vision of‘ a safe. femporary home for owner-surren-

dered animals for which new homes are soughf or for .

which eufhanasia is required or reques’red.

The surrender of animals from public animal shel-
fers for purposes nof for fhe benefif of fhe animals
released, including purposes of experimenfafion. has
never been a parf of fhe principle of public animal
shelfer operafion in fhe enfire hisfory of fhe Sfafe of
California. The proposal fo reverse fhis long-sfanding
principle would no’r only refufe fhe principle ifself. buf
if would acfually require fhe dog-owners of fhe com-
munify fo supporf fha’r very refufa'l'ion fhrough fhe
paymenf of dog license fees. which are now levied for
fhe profecinn of dogs and fhe supporf of fhe public
animal shelfers.

This could only resulf in a serious breakdown of
public confidence in public animal shelfers. and if
would cause relucfance or refusal by fhe greafesf pro-
porfion of fhe public. which now volunfarily employs
animal shelfer service. fo use if. lf would. in effecf.

dog running af large. This could well resulf in fhet

necessi’ry of dipping deeply info ofher fax revenues

. fo suppor’r public animal shelfers which have herefo-

A SAMPLING 0F RECENT EDITORIALS AND AR$ICLES
IN FAVOR OF

HUMANE SLAUGHTER LEGISLATION

THE MILWAUKEE (Wis.) gggggék, June 20, 1957, "The calves are whisked
on to a shackling wheel and hung up, as many as 20 at a time. When
the kill crew is small, calves hang by the rear foot for a couple

of minutes while the rack is loaded. Then they are stuck. Some
were still bawling six minutes after the first rush of blood, it

was noted.”

THE WASEINGTON (D.C) POST AND TIHES HERALD, June 28, 1957, (Edit.)

”Is there any sense to this practice which inflicts wanton cruelty

on animals while subjecting men to work which is degrading as well

as dangerous? Rendering the animals unconscious before slaughter~

ing them would obviate this barbarity. This is all that the Poage

bill would require. It would introduce civilization into our pack~
ing houses."

THE SAN FRANCISCO (Calif.) EXAMINER, April 20, 1957, (Edit.) "Bills
to bring this about are again pending in Congress with the support
of the Humane Society and General Federation of Women’s Clubs,
among others. We would like to renew our support..... Brutality
always brutalizes him who employs it.”

THE BOSTON (Mass.) HERALD, January 24, 1957, (Edit.) "If Congress
passes humane slaughter legislation at this session, much will

have been accomplished to curb misery. And, perhaps, much for

the human spirit as well. The toleration of the pole axe is an
evidence of a deeper social ill than mere inefficiency.” (Reprints
ed in the FORT WAYNE (1nd.) NEWS SENTINEL, June 29)

 

 

THE NORTH VIRGINIA SUN, August 6, 1957, (Edit.) ”For a nation with
pride in its humanity, we should be ashamed of our record in this
legislative area.“

£21~£Q2£§ (Mo.) POST-DISPATCH, April 8, 1957, (Edit.) "Who could
Oppose it?” "—

 

§BLT LAKE CITY (Utah) DESERET Mags, February 20, 1957, (Edit.)
”If by law cruelty to a few animals is prohibited in the case of
bull and cock fighting, how much more important it is to prohibit
cruelty to the 119 million animals that are shipped to market
annually to supply the nation‘s tables with its 21 billion pounds
of meat a year.”

 

.EQEELE (Ala.) REGISTER, May 10, 1957. (Edit.) "By dragging their
feet in the face of rising public demand for the use of more humane
methods in slaughtering meat animals, packinghouses invite the

very federal regulation they oppose."

WASHINGTON MERRY-GO-ROUND, Drew Pearson column, March 24, 1957,
"Note Senators Bennett and Watkins of Utah may prepose that
Congress authorize 'study' of the problem. This is the time-
honored way to block a proposal that can't be fought on its
merits."

EéBZEQBQ (Conn.) nggggg, March 21, 1957, (Edit.) "Humane slaughter—
ing legislation has long been needed in this country, and Ooﬁgress
this year should stand fast against inertia and stubborness.

IEEéBEéEé.(Tex.) GAZETTE April 11, 1957, (Edit.) "We cannot con-
tinue to P036 as CiVilized peeple if we continue to condone some
of the inhumane methods that are used in slaughtering defenseless
animals.”

LABOR'S DAILY, February 23, 1957, "...one of America's most amazing 4
grassroots lobbies rolls into Operation again. Unlike most pressure
groups, this one is not well-organized. Its members belong to both
parties and probably to half a dozen splinter parties as well.

They range from rich old New England dowagers to Chicago packing
plant workers. They are in every state of the union and in.the
territories. They cross every racial and religious line .....

Who are they? Animal lovers! "

THE NASHVILLE TENNESSEEAN, June 26, 1957, (Edit.) ”There is no longer
any sensible argument for these cruel and barbarous methods."

THE LOUISVILLE (Ky.) TIMES, June 24, 1957, by Tom Wallace, ”There are pack-
ers who are unconcerned, or little concerned, or too little concern-

ed about suffering that is inflicted upon animals avoidably. They

should be required to abate that suffering, which their religion for-

bids if they are Americans and practice or profess one of the

religions known in this country.”

 

THE MIAMI (Fla.) NEWS, May 2, 1957, (Edit.) ”Just why the meat in-
dustry should Oppose this reform is hard to understand. The
ammunition used in the stunners costs two to four cents anganimal;
carbon dioxide gas around one cent.” (reprinted in SPRINGFIELD (Ohio)

THE PITTSBURGH (Pa.) POST-GAZETTE, June 17, 1957, (Edit.) ”Senator

but for our own good.'"

 

 

THE NEW YORK WORLD-TELEGRAM.AND SUN, July 15, 1957, ”Congress is
moving steadily toward adopting measures responsive to demands that
the federal government compel better treatment for animal life.”

MY DAY, Eleanor Roosevelt column, March 25, 1957, ”Other countries
have established humane slaughter laws. Such a law requires changes
in equipment and in methods of slaughtering making them economically
sound as well as humane.”

THE DAILY SENTINEL (Colo.) March, 1957, (Edit.) ”If legislation that

good for it - all slaughtering of food animals by commercial firms
will be done by more humane methods.”

 

SAN ANGELO (Tex.) STANDARD, May 3, 1957 (Edit.) ”If it happened to

SAGINAW (Mich.) NEWS, July 9, 1957, (Edit.) ”When a man or a nation
acts in a needlessly brutal way toward any form of life, a twofold

ERIE (Pa. ) TIMES, July 8,1957, (Edit.) ”We feel confident that Congress
will respond to the demand for the legislation and pass the bill. "

KNOXVILLE (Tenn.) NEWS SENTINEL, May 24, 1957, (Edit.) "Man's inhumanity
to man is repugnant. His inhumanity to the animals whose flesh sustains
him is hardly less so. Mandatory humane slaughter legislation now pend-
ing before both houses of COngress should be pasSed.”

 

COLUMBUS (Ohio) CITIZEN, May 22,1957,"The prevalent practice of

Americanism are incompatible.”

NEW YOPK DAILY NEWS, April 1,1957, (Edit. ) "Up to now, meat lobbyists

on the plea that the subject needs further study.”

 

VERNAL (Utah) EXPRESS, April 11,1957,”There has been sufficient
study in the matter to know exactly what needs to be done. The
time is ripe now to do something.

LMLAMI (Fla. ) HERALD, July 9,1957, (Edit.) ”The meat industry has
given a lot of lip service but little action to humane slaughter.
Since it evidently won 't be put into effect voluntarily, a law
seems in order. Americans don't want their food animals to suffer
needlessly.”

THE BETHLEHEM (Pa.) GLOBE—TIMES, July 27, 1957, (Edit.) ”This bill
deserves our support if we want to make amends.”

 

 

THE YOUNGSTOWN (Ohio) VINDICATOR, July 5, 1957, (Edit.) ”'This Operat-
ion is not only extremely painful for the hog, it also provides con-
siderable danger to the worker. The hogs generally thrash around.

Their hoofs are sharp. Workers are often gouged. ' Such evidence should
be enough to convince Congress - and all Americans — of the need of a
law to compel packers to abandon their barbaric, dangerous methods.

 

 

ORANGEBURG (S. C. ) TIMES DEMOCRAT, July 3,1957, (Edit.) "In the name of

HARROW RAILWAY
DISASTER
2.38 pm.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR
THE CO-ORDINATION OF TRANS-
PORT, FUEL AND POWER (LORD
LEATHERS): My Lords, I think your Lord-
ships would wish me to make a statement
to you on the railway disaster that
occurred last Wednesday at Harrow and
Wealdstone station.

At about 8.20 am. on Wednesday,
October 8, the 7.31 am. passenger train
from Tring to Euston was just starting
away from the up fast platform at Har-
row and Wealdstone station when it was
struck at the rear by the 8.15 pm. ex-
press passenger train from Perth to
Euston, which was travelling at high
speed on the same line. The adjacent
down fast line was fouled by the Wreck-
age, and a few seconds later the 8 am.
down express from Euston to Liverpool,
which was hauled by two engines and
was also travelling at speed, collided with
it. The destruction of rolling stock result-
ing from this double collision was alto-
gether exceptional, and it was inevitable
that the casualty list was very great. I
regret to say that 110 persons lost their
lives, including the driver and ﬁreman of
the Perth express. In addition, 159
persons were injured, of whom 75 are
still detained in hospital. I am glad to
say that the great majority of them are
making good progress towards recovery.

A formal inquiry will be opened by
the Chief Inspecting Ofﬁcer of Railways
at Euston tO-morrow; and your Lord-
ships will appreciate that I cannot make

HL 30A 3

any further statement at present. The
Railway Executive have announced that
they will accept full legal liability for
compensation, and all such claims will
receive full and early attention.

Railway Disaster

Your Lordships will, I am sure, wish
to be associated with an expression of
very deep sympathy with the relatives and
friends of the many who lost their lives
in this disaster and with those who were
injured. At the same “time I should like
to pay tribute to everyone who partici-
pated with such unselﬁshness in the pro-
longed and distressing work of rescue, in-
cluding the detachment of the United
States Air Force, who came so promptly
to help us in our trouble.

LORD LUCAS OF CHILWORTH: :
My Lords, we are indeed grateful to the
Secretary of State for taking this, the
earliest possible opportunity, of making;
to your Lordships the statement that he
has. On behalf of noble Lords on this
side I should like to associate myself with:
the expressions of sympathy and con-r
dolence so well expressed by the Secre-r
tary of State, and also with his grateful
thanks to all those who, Without distinc-
tion of class, creed or country, answered
the call of humanity so swiftly and admir-
ably. Perhaps I may be allowed to add
a wOrd of thanks to the railwaymen for
so quickly and efﬁciently obliterating any
outward and obvious Sign of such a tragic .
happening.

It would serve no purpose other than
ill for any comment to be made until the
Chief Inspecting Ofﬁcer has made his
report to the Minister, and I do not intend
to Offer any comment. But I should like,
if I may, to ask the Secretary of State
whether he will give your Lordships an
assurance that the report of the Chief
Inspecting Ofﬁcer will be made public
and placed before Parliament at the
earliest possible moment.

LORD LEATHERS: My Lords, the
inquiry to which I have referred is to be
held in public. There will be no delay
in the delivery of the report to your Lord-
ships. I assure your Lordships that
immediately after all the hearings have
been held the Report will be presented.

MAIL ROBBERIES

2.44 pm.

THE EARL on LISTOWEL: My Lords,
I beg to ask Her Majesty’s Government
the following Question, of which I have
given private notice: Whether, in View of
the general disquiet caused by recent mail
bag robberies, they have any statement
to make.

THE POSTMASTER GENERAL
(EARL DE LA WARR): My Lords, the
noble Earl has spoken of the public con-
cern about the recent mail robberies.
Neither he nor the public can be more
concerned than the Post Ofﬁce itself. I
thank him warmly for this opportunity
that he has given me, both to try to put
the question in right perspective and to
say in general terms what steps are being
. taken to meet a very real and very grave
problem.

It is true to say that these robberies are
only one aspect of what some would
describe as a general increase of law-
lessness; hardly a day passes when we
do not read of some new outrage against
law and order from which the whole
public are sulfering. In spite of all this,
Post Ofﬁce losses have, up till now, been
very much reduced since 1945. In that

year, for instance, the number of inland,

registered letters and parcels lost from
all causes, both internal and external, was
14,500, out of a total of some 142,000,000.
The corresponding ﬁgure for 1951 was
8,000, out of about the same number of
items. Our current losses of mail bags
from allcauses now average under two
per million. The total recorded loss of
currency out of mail bags for the last
twelve months amounts to £290,000. This
ﬁgure includes the alarming and, I sin-
cerely trust, abnormal loss of £240,000 in
the robbery of the 21st May in Central
London.

It is not, of course, for the Post Ofﬁce,
or indeed for any other organisation, to
take upon itself the task of maintaining
law and order, or the apprehension of
criminals. That is, and must remain, the
duty of the police, aided in their work
by the determination of the courts to
impose adequate sentences on criminals
when they are convicted. But subject
only to this qualiﬁcation, it is very
deﬁnitely the responsibility of the Post
Oﬂice to see that its security arrangements
are such as to prevent in every possible

way the loss of mail entrusted to its
charge. ‘

Until the last few months our arrange-
ments, based as they were, on the assump-
tion that this was a fundamentally law-
abiding country, have been not only ade-
quate but steadily improving in their
effectiveness. It has become clear, how-
ever, from recent incidents that these
arrangements, however elfective in the
past, are not adequate to meet present-
day circumstances, including what was, in
eifect, highway robbery with violence in
the streets of Central London by men
who undoubtedly possessed at least some
inner knowledge of the Post Ofﬁce
machine. Since that time our security
arrangements for dealing with packets of
high value have been very considerably
strengthened and the process is continu-
ing—but the House must not press me to
say precisely what precautions we have
already introduced, or what are going to
be introduced in the near future.

In addition to tightening up our own
Post Ofﬁce machine we are working in
very close co-operation with the Railway
authorities, who are solely responsible,
under contract, for all mails committed to
their charge ; and also we are working in
the closest co-operation with the police.
While there is almost always scope in
changing circumstances for improving
joint working arrangements, I should like
to stress that there is no justiﬁcation what-
soever for any suggestion that there is
friction between Scotland Yard and the
Post Ofﬁce. On the contrary the two de-
partments and the Home Ofﬁce are in
constant consultation and are working
together very closely and very happily. I
ask the House to accept my ﬁrm assurance
on this point. ‘

The recent mail losses may, as I have
already said, be part of a general prob-
lem of security and law and order. I, of
course, can speak only about the Post
Ofﬁce side of that problem, but I do
assure your Lordships that it is being
tackled with a real sense of gravity and
urgency on our part. I cannot, of course,
possibly promise that our efforts will have
immediate or spectacular results. I do,
however, promise that we—and I say
“ we ” advisedly, in-that I speak here for
Post Ofﬁce workers and stall at every
level—feel this challenge very deeply.
Since taking over the Post Ofﬁce, I have
come to learn what a magniﬁcent.esprz°t
de corps and pride of public service exists

 




 

621

in that great organisation. Every loss of
mail is a direct blow to that pride. I
can assure you, on behalf of the whole
Post Ofﬁce staff, that its ﬁrm determina-
tion is to do all that it humanly can to
fulﬁl its ﬁne and centuries old traditional
task of ensuring the security of Her
Majesty’s mails.

Awards to

THE EARL OF LISTOWEL: My Lords,
in thanking the noble Earl opposite for
his extremely reassuring reply, and as one
who has had a very happy association
with the Post Ofﬁce, may I say how glad
I am that the excellent and imp-roving
record of the Post Office staff has been
shown in what the noble Earl has said?
I am also glad—and I am sure the public
will share my relief—to hear that better
security arrangements will be made. I
trust that this will prevent a repetition of
the serious type of robbery such as that
which occurred this year in London.

LORD .VANSITTART: My Lords, I
beg to ask the second Question which
stands in my name on the Order Paper.

[The Question was as follows:

To ask Her Majesty’s Government
who pays, and how, for the expenses
of the numerous persons travelling to
and in China via other Communist
countries on ostensible missions of

THE MARQUESS 0F READING:
My Lords, although I cannot say exactly
how these people ﬁnance these journeys,
I believe that their fares and expenses
while in Communist countries are nor-
mally paid by the bodies which invite
them. The question of the use of foreign
exchange in travelling to Communist
territory would not arise, since it is pos-
sible to pay in sterling for a passage to
such places as Prague.

LORD VANSITTART: My Lords,
would the noble Marquess consider ask-

ing the Law Officers for an opinion .

whether there is any Offence in accepting
ﬁnancial favours from a country with
Which we are engaged in hostilities?

THE MARQUESS OF READING:
My Lords, there are one or two assump-
tions in that question which I think per-
haps render it not very valuable at the
moment to ask the opinion of the Law
Ofﬁcers of the Crown. Any suggestion
coming from the noble Lord on these
matters is always worthy of considera-
tion and will accordingly be considered.

LORD STRABOLGI: My Lords, do I
understand that Her Majesty’s Govern-
ment have declared war on any coun-
tries while we have been in Recess?

THE MARQUESS OF READING:
If so, it has escaped the. notice of the
Foreign Office.

LORD VANSITTART: I should like to
point out that I was careful to make no
mention of a state of war, but to state
the fact that we are engaged in hostili-
ties. There is no assumption whatever
in that statement.

LORD LUCAS OF CHILWORTH: My
Lords, I beg to ask the Question which
stands in my name on the Order Paper.

[The Question was as follows:

To ask Her Majesty’s Government
whether they have any statement to
make regarding the negotiations with
the American ﬁlm industry upon the
American ﬁlm agreement]

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY
OF LANCASTER (V ISCOUNT SWINTON):
My Lords, discussions between represen-
tatives of Her Majesty’s Government and
of United States ﬁlm interests, about the
extent to which the earnings of United
States ﬁlms in this country are allowed
to be transferred into dollars, took place
in Washington during September. As a
result of these discussions, agreement was
reached that the present arrangements,
which were negotiated in July, 1951,
should be modiﬁed so as to reduce by
5,900,000 dollars the amount which
United States interests are allowed to
transfer into dollars. Of this amount
1,400,000 dollars is in respect of transfers
which would, under the arrangements as
they stood, have been permissible in the
year ended September 30, 1952, and the
remainder in respect of transfers which
would have become permissible in the
year ending September 30, 1953.

These arrangements mean that slightly
more than half of the total earnings Of
United States ﬁlms in this country are
allowed to be converted into dollars. The
total amount allowed to be so converted
during the twelve months ending
September 30, 1953, will be approxi-
mately 20,000,000 dollars, representing
rather less than 2 per cent. of our dollar
expenditure on imports from the United
States. Under the Anglo-American Film
Agreement, United States ﬁlm earnings
over and above the amounts allowed to
be transferred may be spent only in cer-
tain speciﬁed ways, the most important Of
which are the production of ﬁlms in the
sterling area and the acquisition of over-
seas rights of ﬁlms produced in the ster-
ling area.

LORD LUCAS OF CHILWORTH: My
Lords, I am grateful to the noble V1scount
for his full reply which, in view of all

\ the circumstances, I regard as being very

 




 

Marine and Aviation

625

satisfactory. May I sympathise with him
on his very bad cold? May I ask the
noble Viscount whether Her Majesty’s
Government are aware that the demand
made public by an organisation called
the Employees’ Council of the Film In-
dustry for a reduction in the importation
of American ﬁlms in no way represents
the vast bulk of responsible opinion in
the British ﬁlm industry? Further,
would he not agree that any diminution
in the import of American ﬁlms at the
present time would result in little or no
saving in dollar expenditure, and that, in
View of the fact that we have to rely upon
American ﬁlms for 70 per cent. of shew-
ing time in British cinemas, any reduc-
tion would have a ruinous effect upon the
British ﬁlm industry, including the col-
lapse of the Eady plan?

VISCOUNT SWINTON: My Lords, I
am grateful to the noble Lord for his
kind observation about my health. I trust
that I am audible. Anyway, my health
has been greatly improved by the
stimulating air of Scarborough and I hope
the noble Lord opposite has been equally
stimulated at Morecambe.

I am glad that the noble Lord thinks
that this was a good negotiation, and I
am bound to say that I entirely agree
with him. I think it reﬂects great credit
on the distinguished civil servant who
conducted the negotiations. As regards
the supplementaries which the noble Lord
put, I am sure that my right honourable
friend the President of the Board of Trade
will read with interest the observations
which the noble Lord has mad-e, and I
am sure that he shares the desire that
nothing in any arrangements made with
1the American ﬁlm interests should in
any way injure the British ﬁlm industry.
I might add this, however. The limita-
tion of the number of American ﬁlms
admitted would certainly not be an
effective way of reducing the earnings of
United States ﬁlms, since far and away
the greatest revenue which United States
ﬁlms make is not out of what I may
call the “ rough and tumble ”—eif that is
a good description, and I think it is—
of the bulk of American ﬁlms but is made
from a few absolutely ﬁrst-class feature
ﬁlms which everyone would go to see
and which would certainly be imported,
however low the American quota was.
In any case, a mere reduction of imports
might create great difﬁculties for cinemas

in this country, and, indeed, what is even
more important, for the cinema-going
public in this country, without giving us
any countervailing advantage in the
balance of payments.

SO far as we can see, the Government
have not as yet been able to devise any
more effective way, other than on the
lines of the present agreement, of limiting
the dollar expenditure on ﬁlms. There-
fore, I think we are at one with the late
Government, which twice negotiated an
agreement on the same lines. I am much
obliged to the noble Lord for having
raised these points, which I have tried to
answer to the best of my ability.

EMARINE AND AVIATION
INSURANCE (WAR RISKS) BILL

3.2 pm.
Order of the Day for the Second Read-
ing read. '

THE EARL or BIRKENHEAD: My
Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be
now read a second time. This is a some-
what complicated measure and I shall
attempt to outline its main provisions as
clearly and as brieﬂy as I can. There
has, quite recently, in speeches and else-
where, been a good many references to
other “ hostilities ”—I hope to explain
that term later on. We on this side of the
House expect a certain tranquillity in
this measure which I do not anticipate,
when the Transport Bill matures, from
the noble Lord, Lord Lucas of Chilworth.
I think we are all more or less agreed,
however, that this Bill is an essential and
prudent part of our general defence pre-
Cautions.

As its name implies, the Bill is designed
to give the Government powers relating
to the insurance of ships and aircraft and
cargoes against the perils of war. Cer-
tain powers covering ships and their car-
goes, but not covering aircraft were
included in the War Risks Insurance Act
of 1939, but during the course of the last
war these powers had to be modiﬁed and
extended by Defence Regulations which
amended the 1939 Act to meet the
changing circumstances of the war. These
Amendments, unlike the original Act,
have to be re-enacted annually under the
Emergency Laws (Miscellaneous Provi-
sions) Act, 1947, and we consider it very
desirable that they should now be incor-
porated in permanent legislation. It is

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Marine and Aviation ,

627

[The Earl :of Birkenhead.]
also desirable that certain further
changes, to which I shall refer, should
be made, in order to bring the Govern-
ment’s insurance powers into line with
present-day conditions.

The object of the 1939 Act, and of the
present Bill, is to ensure that should hos-
tilities occur, or even on the threat of
hostilities, ships will not be held up or
the trade of the country interfered with
by lack of insurance facilities. The legis-
lation is, therefore, so designed as to
enable Her Majesty’s Government to deal
with emergency circumstances and, in
such circumstances, to provide insurance
cover which might not otherwise be avail-
able except perhaps at prohibitive pre-
mium rates. In peace time, of course, the
ordinary facilities of the insurance mar-
ket cater fully and most efficiently for the
insurance needs of commerce. At this
point I should like to give, on behalf of
the Government, a most categorical assur-
ance that the Government have no inten-
tion whatever of exercising the powers
to be conferred by the present Bill for
the purpose of interfering in any way
whatsoever with the legitimate interests
and activities of the insurance market in
peace time. That is a most important
point, and I should like to emphasise it
with all the power at my command.

The main provisions of the Bill will, in
the first place, enable the Government
to conclude reinsurance agreements in
respects of ships, aircraft or their cargoes
against war risks; and secondly, it will
enable us to effect the direct insurance
of ships, aircraft or their cargoes against
war risks at any time when there are no
other reasonable and adequate facilities
available or against any risks, war or
marine, in "time of war or other hostilities.
This is subject to the proviso—~which is
1mportant—that risks other than war risks,
that is to say, marine risks, may be
covered by the Government only when
this is necessary in the interests of the
defence of the Realm or the efﬁcient
prosecution of any war or other hostili-
ties in which this country may be involved.
Your Lordships may think that this is
giving the Government a wide latitude
and that, of course, is so; but I think
that that fact must be accepted. The Bill
also includes, as did the 1939 Act, a tran-
sitional provision for the payment of com-

pensation in respect of cargoes which,

H.L. 30 A 8

[ LORDS ]

 

 

 

 

Insurance (War Risks) Bill 628

might be at risk when moving between
ships and warehouse, or vice versa, in the
ﬁrst few days of a war before there had
been an opportunity to insure them with
the Government Insurance Ofﬁce. These
risks are not insurable in the commercial
insurance market, but when the Govern-
ment InsuranCe Ofﬁce is set up it will
accept risks at an appropriate premium.

If I may sum up this matterat this
point, I would say that in the main this
Bill is a re-enactment of Part I of the
1939 Act, as amended during the war by
Defence Regulations, and those provi-
sions of Part III of the 1939 Act which
related to the insurance of ships and
cargoes ; and on its enactment So much of
the 1939 Act as dealt with ships and
cargoes will be repealed. I should like
to make clear what are the additional
powers which we ask for in the Bill
now before your Lordships. These are,
ﬁrst, to insure or reinsure aircraft ;
secondly, to enter into agreements in
peace-time to reinsure foreign ships
against war risks when we are at war or
involved in other hostilities ; and thirdly,
to insure goods moving between ship or
aircraft and warehouse, or vice versa, at
overseas ports.

As regards insurance or reinsurance of
aircraft, it is desirable that the Govern-
ment should have the power to insure
or reinsure aircraft, because certain
British civil aircraft may continue to
operate commercially during a future war,
and owing to the absence of market facili—
ties it may become necessary for the Gov-
ernment to provide means for the in-
surance or reinsurance of such aircraft,
particularly against war risk. There is
also the possibility that certain foreign
aircraft may be taken on charter during
war for commercial purposes, or that
owing to the circumstances of the war,
foreign aircraft may be based upon this
country.

As regards power to enter into agree-
ments in peace time, the 1939 Act autho-
rised the insurance of foreign ships in war
time, but it became necessary during the
last war also to undertake the reinsurance
of foreign ships, and the 1939 Act was
amend-ed in 1940 by Defence Regulation
to make this possible. But even with
this amendment the Government are not
empowered to conclude in peace time any
agreements with foreign countries for the
insurance or reinsurance of their ships in

 




 

629

war time. It is, in our View, very desira-
ble that the Government should be
empowered to do this. In fact, a number
of foreign Governments have indeed
already approached us about the
insurance or reinsurance of their ships
against war risks in time of war, and it
would clearly be an advantage if agree-
ments could now be concluded so that
they were available and. could come into
force as soon as any war or hostilities in
which this country was involved occurred.

Marine and Aviation

[As regards the insurance of goods
moving between ship or aircraft and
warehouse, or vice versa, this is autho-
rised by Section 2 of the 1939 Act, but
it is authorised under that Act only in the
United Kingdom, the Isle of Man and the
Channel Islands. This power was taken
because the insurance markets of the
world have agreed not to cover goods on
land against war risks. The market does
not cover them until they are loaded on
board a ship, and does not cover them
after they have been discharged from the
ship. In the absence of such cover, it
is necessary for the Government to be
able to afford the cover required and,
having regard to the wider and lament-
able range of modern warfare, it is
obviously desirable that in future this
Cover should not be conﬁned to the
United Kingdom, the Isle of Man and
the Channel Islands but should be given
also to overseas countries. This power
is accordingly taken in Clause 2 (1) (e) of
the present Bill. _

Before I close, I should like to draw
your Lordships’ attention to another
change or modiﬁcation that is made in
this Bill. The 1939 Act, as amended by
Defence Regulation, authorised insurance
or reinsurance by the Government only
against Queen’s Enemy Risks—or, as it
was in those days, “King’s Enemy
Risks.” But I have no doubt whatever
that all your Lordships are perfectly well
aware of the difference between “ Queen’s
Enemy Risks ” and “ war risks.” At the
additional risk of fatiguing your Lord-
ships, I will remind your Lordships that
“ Queen’s Enemy Risks ” are risks which
are run when our country is at war with
another State, which then becomes a
“ Queen’s enemy.” “ War Risks ” are
much wider than “ Queen’s Enemy
Risks,” and they arise from other hostili-
ties when countries other than our own
are ﬁghting; they include such things as

H.L. so A 9

[‘14 OCTOBER 1952] Insurance (War Risks) Bill

 

 

630

rebellion and civil war. In View of recent
developments of the conditions under
which our country might be involved in
hostilities, though not technically at war,
it has been deemed necessary throughout
this. Bill to refer not merely to “war”
and “Queen’s Enemy Risks,” as were
referred to in the 1939 Act, but to “ war
or other hostilities in which Her Majesty
is engaged ” and to “ war risks.” If the
Government had had these powers at an
earlier stage, they would have been able,
if necessary, to afford cover in the kind
of situation which now exists in Korea,
where, although Her Majesty is still not
technically at war, ships and aircraft are
nevertheless subject to war risks, a kind
of risk which would be rightly designated
“ Queen’s Enemy Risks ” if the Govern-
ment were formally at war.

Lastly, I might make reference to the
fact that the powers given to the Board
of Trade under Part II of the 1939 Act to
operate a scheme for the insurance
against war risks of goods held for sale
in this country (known as the “ Com-
modity Insurance Scheme ”) are in no
way affected by the present legislation.
I hope your Lordships will agree that this
is a necessary and prudent measure. It
is, I feel, simply a matter of common
sense, and I hope that your Lordships
will give this Bill a Second Reading this
afternoon. I beg to move.

Moved, That the [Bill be now read 23'.

3.17 pm.

LORD LUCAS OF CHILWORTH:
My Lords, the noble Earl can rest
assured that his Bill will have a tranquil
passage, not only because of the charm-
ing and lucid manner in which he
explained its complicated provisions to
your Lordships, but also because the bill
had its birth in the Department at the
time of the last Government. Therefore
it can hardly be expected to be a bad
Bill. I am not going to say very much
except to note one thing, that the noble
Earl was anxious to tell your Lordships——
“ to give a categorical assurance ” I think,
was the expression he used——that Her
Majesty’s Government did not intend to
interfere in peace time with the ordinary
course of business of the insurance
market. What he meant to say, I

suppose, was that, even though Her

Majesty’s Government have powers
under this Bill, they do not intend to alter

 




 

 

631 Experiments

[Lord Lucas of Chil-worthj
the proﬁt ratio of the insurance market
in peace time. I can only add that I
hope Her Majesty’s Government will
always be able to make a proﬁt ;. in other
words, that they will not be saddled with
what I think is known in the City as the
“ dirty paper ” after allowing all the
good paper to go into other hands. We
give this Bill our blessing, not only
because we think it necessary but also
because we agree with what the noble
Earl has said. I sincerely hope that it
will prove to be proﬁtable for Her
Majesty’s Government in the future.

LORD PETI—IICK-LAWRENCE: My
Lords, may i ask one question. Do I
understand that no actual result follows
from this Bill until the Government take
steps to effect this insurance or re-
insurance? In that case, what happens
if a war comes along suddenly and there
is an intervening period between the out-
break of the war or the hostilities, and
insurance activity? If, on the other
hand, it is a provision that is made
before the war breaks out, then I would
like to know at what time the premiums
will begin to be paid.

T HE EARL 0F BIRKENHEAD: My
Lords, I think the whole object of this
measure is to attempt to anticipate the
kind of trouble that the noble Lord
envisages. I explained that as well as I
could. The whole object of this Bill is
to clean up the intervening difﬁculties to
which the noble Lord refers, in order to
be ready, immediately hostilities occur,
to start. our insurance. That is what I
meant.

On Question, Bill read 2a, and commit-
ted to a Committee of the Whole House.

EXPERIMENTS ON ANIMALS

3.20 pm.

LORD DOWDING rose to draw atten-
tion to the unnecessary suffering caused
by surgical and medical experiments on
animals; and to moVe for Papers. The
noble Lord said: My Lords, I am speak-
ing to-day on. an unpopular subject.
People who are normally humane have
the idea that the suffering inflicted on
animals by surgical and medical experi-
ments avails to reduce the suffering of
human beings. I want to make clear at
the outset my own personal position. It

H.L. 30 A 10

 

 

 

632

that even should it be conclu—
sively proved that human beings beneﬁt
directly from the suﬁering of animals, its
inﬂiction would nevertheless be unethical
and wrong. This, however, is not the
aspect of the question which I propose
to raise to-day. I am sure that the
average man and woman in this country
has not yet learned to appreciate the
part played by animals in the great
drama of evolution, or our responsibili-
ties towards‘ animals, or the ill-effects
which follow our neglect of those respon-
sibilities. Many people are sceptical of
the idea that even human beings survive
physical death ; and the percentage which
will accept, even as a possibility, the idea
that animals are immortal spirits in the
process of evolution towards a higher
state, is something quite absurd. There-
fore I shall not approach the subject from
this angle, except to state my own con-
viction that these are facts.

The points which I wish to raise to-
day will not, I think, be regarded by
anyone as unpractical or visionary, .
whether or no I succeed in convincing
your Lordships that they are valid. My
ﬁrst point is that the law designed for
the protection of animals against cruelty
is gravely defective. The second point
is, that there is neither adequate» inspec-
tion nor proper enforcement. Thirdly,
the number of experiments are grossly
excessive and unduly repetitive; and
fourthly, the majority of these experi-
ments are quite unpractical when it
comes to applying them to human
maladies—in fact, they may even be
deﬁnitely injurious. One of. the diﬁicul-
ties in dealing with vivisection and
animal experiments in general is that,
broadly speaking, laymen do not have
access to the laboratories and the places
where this suﬁering is inﬂicted, and
therefore the evidence available must be
incomplete, and restricted to accounts
which the experimenters themselves give
in medical and scientiﬁc journals. It
is not unreasonable then to assume that
the actual situation may be a good deal
worse than there is evidence to show.
On the other hand, what evidence there
is is incontrovertible, because it comes
from the experimenters themselves.

on Animals

The Cruelty to Animals Act originated
in your Lord‘ships’ House in 1876. It
was a humane and honest attempt to
control the terrible cruelties which were

.sectors. The original Bill laid down, by
Restriction ,3, “that the animal must,
during the whole of the experiment, be
under the inﬂuence of some anmstehetic
sumcient to prevent it from feeling pain.
I must apologise, in parenthesis, for read-
ing so much of my speech; the fact is
that, as the old lady said about Hamlet,
it is so fuli of quotations. Restriction 4
‘laid down that if serious injury had been
inﬂicted on the animal, or if the pain was
likely to continue after the effect of the
anaesthetic had ceased, the animal must
be killed before recovering from the
anaesthetic. Clause 5 contained an abso-
‘lute prohibition against performing pain-
ful experiments without anmsthetic, on
dogs, cats, horses, mules or donkeys. All
these humane provisions were whittled
down during the passage of the Bill into
law. Amendments gave power to issue
special certiﬁcates of exemption. Certiﬁ-
cate A allows experiments to be per-
formed without anaesthetics ; certiﬁcate B
excuses experimenters from killing
animals before recovery, and other certiﬁ-
cates permit the employment of dogs,
cats, horses, mules or donkeys

‘“ if the object of the experiment would be
frustrated ”

unless .it was performed on one of those
prohibited classes of animals.

Furthermore, no serious attempt is
made to enforce the law, even in its
emasculated form. In 1950, over
1,750,000 experiments were performed on
living animals, at 478 places, and 3,780
persons were licensed to perform experi-
ments. In 1876, when the Act was
passed, there were about 300 experiments
per annum. To supervise these, two in-
spectors were appointed. Now that the
number of experiments has been multi-
plied by 50,000 the number of inspectors
has been increased from two to live.

In the seventy-six years during which
the Cruelty to Animals Act has been in
force no single prosecution has ever been
brought under it, so far as I have been
able to ascertain. The inspection system
is merely a sop to public conscience—not
that that conscience is a very sensitive
organ, alas. In 1911 the Protection of
Animals Act was passed. This Act goes
a long way to establish the right of
animals to fair treatment, and deals at
length with various forms of cruelty. But
Section 1 (3) reads

634

“ Nothing in this section shall render illegal
any act lawfully done under the Cruelty to
Animals Act, 1876.”

So the Act of 1876 becomes a Cruelty to
Animals Act in fact as well as in name ; it
is indeed the vivisectors’ charter.

At Dartford, on July 21, 1949, a man
was found guilty of not giving his dog
enough food. He was imprisoned for
three months, and was debarred from
holding a dog licence for the rest of his
life. Some experiments in starving
puppies to give them rickets and other
diseases were ﬁrst reported on by the
Medical Research Council in 1921, when
they referred to 400 cases. Deﬁciency
experiments, as they are called, have been
continued until the present day. In 1949
the Journal of Physiology described the
latest results. Imprisonment for the
amateur in cruelty ; honours and rewards
for the professional wholesaler. So much
for my contention that the present law
is gravely defective and that the
machinery for its enforcement is futile
and delusive.

My next point is in connection with the
number of experiments carried out. As I
have mentioned, the number has increased
from 3‘00 in 1876 to over 1,750,000 in
l950. Of course, it must be said at once
that only a small proportion of these ex-
periments are cases of vivisection, in the
literal meaning of the word. There are the
so—called deﬁciency experiments, to which
I have referred, and there are very many
experiments in which animals are infected
with some disease and left to suffer the
consequences. But, so far as I have been
able to ascertain, no sort of attempt 18
made to check the indeﬁnite repetit1on
of painful or lethal experiments. There
is no authority to say, for instance:
“ Why do you want to carry out this ex-
periment? It has already been done, and
you can ﬁnd the report of it in such and
such a publication.” I quote a fairly
recent instance. As your Lordships may
or may not be aware, successive Govern-
ments have been in the habit of subjecting
the ﬂour of which our white bread is
made to a process known as “ agenising.”
This process was devised in New York,
and it consists in treating the ﬂour with
N.C.I. gas to make it look white and to
delay the onset of mould in the bread.
The gas is of itself deleterious, if not
actually poisonous, and some of the few
people who knew what was going on
wondered whether the resulting product

on Animals

[Lord Dowding.]

was altogether good for the health of the
people. So an American experimenter
carried out the test of feeding dogs on
agenised flour between 1938 and 1940.
The dogs developed canine hysteria, with
most distressing symptoms, and I think
all of them died. “Ah,” you will say,
“ Here is a useful experiment at last.
Doubtless the process of agenising our
daily bread was at once discontinued.”
But you would be wrong. The verdict
was that what happened to dogs was not
applicable to human beings ; so the poor
dogs had suffered and died in vain, and
our bread continued to be agenised. But
that was not the end of it. The cruel and
useless experiment was repeated at least
twice more in England, and the results
were described .in the British. Medical
Journal of December 14, 1946, and the
Lancet of August 23, 1947.

Experiments

Again, the reduplication of experi-’

ments in deliberately infecting animals
during the process of cancer research
knows no limits. Of course, it would
be unreasonable to expect the authori-
ties to keep an up-to-date tally of all
animal experiments and to prevent all
duplication. But surely it is not un-
reasonable that, when experimenters
apply for licences to exempt them from
the provisions of the 1876 Act, they
should be called on to state what they
want to do and why they want to do it,
and should be obliged to render a report
on the experiment within a certain time.
Indeﬁnite carte blanche exemptions
should not be given. Subsequent appli-
cants for permission to perform similar
experiments should be referred to reports
already in existence. There is good
reason to believe that the most cruel ex-
periments are never reported on at all.
This applies especially to experiments on
dogs. Some 3,950 dogs were experi-
mented on in 1950, and probably some
of the most “important” experiments
were performed on them. Yet it is rare
to ﬁnd, among the many experiments
described in scientiﬁc journals, reports
upon the vivisection of dogs. It seems
not improbable that physiologists may
appreciate the danger of arousing public
indignation if they give details of what
has happened to these dogs—or if the
physiologists are beyond such considera-
tions, it may well be that the editors of
the said journals exercise a worldly-wise

discretion regarding the articles which
they select for publication.

on Animals

I must not omit to mention the poor
animals which are deliberately infected
with poison gases or exposed to the
radiation which accompanies nuclear
ﬁssion. But so long as man does these
things to his fellow man, it is perhaps
unreasonable to object to his doing them
to animals. The process of preparing this
Motion has been a most painful one to
me, because it has compelled me to read
of many cases of revolting and sickening
cruelty. I do not wish to base my appeal
to your Lordships on sentimentality, or
to attempt to work up a reaction beyond
that which is justiﬁed by the facts. But
this is a subject which is resolutely thrust
aside by the average citizen, by the Press,
and by the broadcasting authorities—in
which I include the Church. They wish
to believe that all is well with the existing
system, and that its only critics are
cranks. They have no wish even to listen
to the evidence, and so my case would
not be complete if I did not adduce some
instances in support of my assertions.

The Journal of Physiology of May 15 ,
1949, contains a report on cats in the
Royal Naval Laboratory at Alverstoke.
They [were exposed to 100 per cent.
oxygen until they «convulsed or died. The
lucky ones convulsed and died after three
days continuous exposure. One was re-
moved . after sixty-seven hours, suffered
convulsions ﬁfteen times at short inter-
vals and was then killed. An unlucky cat
was intermittently exposed for forty-ﬁve
day, then it was given another forty-ﬁve
days to recover, and was then put back
into the chamber where it took a week to
die. The same journal describes experi-
ments on pregnant cats after mutilation
and also revolting experiments on cats’
eyes. There is also a description of the
making of a window in the chest wall of
a cat and the insertion of a light bulb
so that observations might be made during
experiments.

The British Journal of Experimental
Pathology describes what must be given
a high place in the scale of cruel and
useless experiments. A number of rats
were subjected to two severe operations
The ﬁrst was to establish
collateral blood circulation in order that
the rats’ livers might be cut out at the
second operation. Shortly after the

 

 




 

 

637

second operation, the rats died in con-
vulsions, but it was found that the ad-
ministration of a poisonous drug named
“ Ompa ” did not hasten the death of the
rats whose livers had been cut out,
whereas it did kill other rats whose livers
had not been cut out. All the rats died
after varying degrees of pain. So I sup-
pose that the experiment was regarded as
successful. What possible value it could
have to human beings, or even to other
rats, was not explained.

Experiments

A frightful experiment in inoculating
monkeys with rabies was conducted at the
Lister Institute in London and described
in the Lancet of December 19, 1931. The
monkeys clutched the bars of their cage
uttering piercing shrieks which got fainter
and fainter over a period of ﬁve days until
they became nearly comotose. Further
stimulation induced aggressiveness and
violent muscular spasms, sufﬁcient to
throw the animal Violently across the
cage. Three animals bit themselves
severely. Two chewed off the end of a
ﬁnger and one chewed off the whole skin
of the forearm, exposing the muscles from
the elbow to the wrist.

The published accounts of experiments
in Canada and the United States of
America are very shocking, but it may
. be only that their physiologists are less
inhibited than ours in what they choose
to publish. One experiment described
involved the injection of boiling water
into the veins of a dog until it became
unconscious from pain. Then there is a
devilish device known as the Noble-
Collip Drum, which has been in regular
use on the other side of the Atlantic
for the past ten years. It consists of a
rotating drum with a projection from the
circumference which picks up the animal
at every revolution and drops it from a
height of seven or eight inches. Thus

the animal is very slowly battered to

death. Rats and guinea pigs are chieﬂy
used. The rats tried to jump over the
projection, so their paws were fastened
together with adhesive tape. In one ex-
periment described, female rats were
subjected to 4,200 falls in 65 minutes
before death released them. Autopsies
showed bruising of the skull and paws,
broken teeth, and internal injuries to the
muscles, liver, bowels, kidneys, lungs,
rectum, duodenum and stomach.
Further experiments were carried out on
animals which had ﬁrst been mutiliated

and eviscerated. l .have no evidence
that this appliance has been used in Eng-
land; but my point is that there would
be nothing illegal in its use by holders
of certiﬁcates allowing them to experi-
ment on animals without anmsthetics.

0n Animals

Most Vivisectors in this country de-
fend their practices on the ground that
their experiments beneﬁt humanity. But
the true Vivisector will have none of this
mawkishness. Dr. Ludimar Hermann,
late professor at Zurich University, is on
record as having said:

“The advancement of our knowledge, and
not utility to medicine, is the true and sraight-
forward object of all Vivisection. No true
investigator in his researches thinks of the prac-
tical utilisation. Science can afford to despise
this justiﬁcation with which Vivisection has
been defended in England.”

That is a reasonably callous and hard-
boiled attitude, one, would think; but to
ﬁnd the pure, true-blue vivisectionist one
must go to Russia. Dr. Cyon, one-time
Professor of Physiology at St. Petersburg,
in his book, puts it thus:

“The true Vivisector must approach a difﬁ—
cult vivisection with joyful excitement. He
who shrinks from cutting into a living animal,
he who approaches Vivisection as a disagree-
able necessity, may be able to repeat one or
two Vivisections, but he will never be an artist
in Vivisection. The sensation of the physiolo-
gist, when, from a gruesome wound, full of
blood and mangled tissue, he draws forth some
delicate nerve thread . . . has much in com-
mon with that of the sculptor.”

But it is not only the cranks and lay-
men who are shocked and horriﬁed by the
ghastly tale of animal experimentation.
The volume of criticism from doctors and
journals is steadily growing.
Nearly twenty years ago Dr. G. F.
Walker, late medical registrar at Leeds
University expressed the following
remarkable opinion:

“My own conviction is that the study of
human physiology by way of experiments on
animals is the most grotesque and fantastic
error ever committed in the whole range of
human intellectual activity.”

The noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, had
said something of the same nature, though
much less forcibly expressed, when he
stated three years earlier in Toronto his
Views on the indilference of physiologists
to clinical medicine. He said:

“It is true that they have been busy in
the practice of animal research but not sel-
dom their labour has seemed aloof from
humanproblems, and the results incapable
of application to the maladies of man.”

 




       

 

 
 
 
  
 
 
  
  
    
 
  
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
    
   
   
 
  
  
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
  
  
 
   
  
  
 
  
  
 
 
  
  
 
  

 

 
 

 

  
 
  
  
 

 

 
  
    
 
 

 

639 Experiments

[Lord Dowding.]
He added that
“ he could not repress a feeling that they might
have been much better occupied.”

l have with me a booklet in which the
opinions of twenty-four qualiﬁed doctors
and surgeons were collected in 1948 for
the presentation of the Anti-Vivisection
case to the Home Secretary, Mr. Chuter
Ede. it would take too long to quote
extensively from it, but it bears out my
contention that there is appreciable
medical support for the View which I am
here advocating. The acknowledged
medical journals have published many
leading articles and editorials which one
might quote. I will spare your Lordships
any lengthy quotation, but I think I might
quote from the »Medical Times of
March, 1934. It states. in a leading
article:

“Then there is the physiologist. Here we
are up against the most ﬂagrant example of
the uselessness of animal experiment . . .
Such experiments lead us nowhere. In fact
they hamper the progress of medical science.”
And the Lancer, which is normally a
staunch protagonist of vivisection in
general, admitted in its editorial of July 3,
1948, that
“it is notoriously dangerous to apply experi—
mental results from animals to the treatment
of human beings, because human and animal
physiology show subtle but important
differences.”

I must now refer to a new form of
animal exploitation which, so far as
numbers are concerned, has caused
vivisection to take a secondary place. I
refer to the employment of animals for
the manufacture and the testing of many
modern specifics. Calves, of course, have
been used for many years in the produc-
tion of anti-smallpox vaccine. Here are
a few of the other things which are done
to animals in the process of testing
modern drugs.

Insulin: rabbits and mice are injected
With insulin and a count made of the
number winch pass into convulsions.

Supra-renal hormone: rats have their
supra - renal glands removed under
anaesthetic, are allowed to recover and
are then given injections. They are
placed in a refrigerator a few degrees
above freezing point and left there for
ﬁve or six hours. The number of dead
is then counted.

Thyroid: the test is to ﬁnd out how
long iniected mice can live in hermetically
Hi. 30 A 14

 

[ LORDS]

sealed jars. They live in increasing dis—
comfort for about half an hour, when they
die 1n convulsions.

Pain-killing drugs have been tested by
burning the end of a rat’s tail by an
electric lamp and noting the time before
the tail twitches. Another method is to
drop mice into a glass jar heated to 131
degrees Fahrenheit. 1 quote from the
British Medical Journal:

“ When the pain was too great to be borne
by the back paws the mouse kicked its legs

and danced about. The movement of the hind
legs was taken as a sign of acute discomfort.”

The standard time of exposure was thirty
seconds. These tests can give only
approximate results, and manufacturers
have complained of having to satisfy tests
which have a possible error of 30 per
cent. Surely ,it should be possible to
substitute chemical and mechanical tests
for this trafﬁc in ﬂesh and blood. So far
as 1 am aware, the large number of
animals which are used by the manufac-
turing chemists as machines for the
manufacture and testing of drugs is not
included in the Home Ofﬁce statistics of
the number of experiments on living
animals—namely, 1,780,000 in 1950. This
additional number is probably large, and
increasing annually.

I do not think there would be much
point in pressing now for the appointment
of another Royal Commission to re-cover
the well trodden ground of the anti-
vivisectionist case, especially as that case
was so excellently put by the deputation
introduced by Mr. Ronald Chamberlain,
MB, to Mr. Chuter Ede on February 3,
1948, and rejected by him so uncom-
promisingly. But I do think that there
is a case for an adequate inquiry into the
entirely new conditions which have arisen
since the issue of the report of the Royal
Commission of 1912 on which Mr.
Chuter Ede- lbased his decision. If and
when such an inquiry is made, the whole
subject, as well as the report of the inquiry,
might be reconsidered. But it needs no
special inquiry to demonstrate how badly
the Act of 1876 is working to-day; and
it should. require no fresh legislation to
enable the authorities to correct the
defects in its operation.

To recapitulate, I personally should
wish to see the abolition of all experi-
ments bringing pain to animals, and also
{the abolition of their employment as
machines for the manufacture and testing

   

 

 

 




 

 

641

of drugs, but I realise that it is not practi-
cal politics to ask for legislation on those
lines at present. It may be that this state
of affairs will never be brought about by
legislation, but by the spread of the know-
ledge of the place of animals in the
scheme of evolution, of man’s responsi-
bility to the animals, and of the ills which
assail mankind if it neglects this responsi-
bility. The action which I now ask Her
Majesty’s Government to take is: ﬁrst,
to devise means for enforcing the Act
of 1876 ; secondly, to tighten up the pro-
cess of granting permits to experiment on
animals; thirdly, to take steps to put a
stop to the indeﬁnite repetition of experi-
ments which have already been made;
and fourthly, to make some form of
official inquiry into the vast new ﬁeld of
animal exploitation in the manufacture
and testing of drugs, a ﬁeld which has
not been touched by previous legislation.

Experimenn

The time has gone, perhaps never to
return, when Britain could mould the
world to her will by force of arms or by
the power of money. But I am one of
those who believe that the power of
Britain will be exercised, and effectively
exercised, through the example which we
set to other nations of humanity in the
widest sense of the word. May we not
make a start to-day by discarding the old
shibboleths, and approaching this evil of
animal exploitation without prejudice and
With a genuine desire to abolish the pain
and terror to which we subject God’s
creatures in the supposed interests of our
own health and comfort? I beg to move

LORD HAILEY: My Lords, no one, I
am sure, could venture for a second to
question the great sincerity or the single-
ness of purpose which has actuated the
noble and gallant Lord, Lord Dowding,
in bringing this Motion before the House.
‘What he has said shows deep feeling and
great sincerity, and is in full accord with
what we know of his character in other
respects. But he has put forward views
which are strongly at variance with those
held by a large body of scientists and a
large body of public opinion in this counv
try. I do not think it would be right if
some of the points of View which the
noble Lord has expressed were allowed
to go without comment from those who
hold differing opinions. I am not a
scientist, and I am not able to speak on

H.L. so A 1.5

behalf of scientists. But, after all, this
is a question in which every layman must
interest himself, and on which he must
inform himself. There are at stake not
only great moral issues and great ethical
questions, but practical questions of the
greatest importance to the health and
happiness of the community at large.

I may say that, as a layman, my own
interest in these questions was ﬁrst
aroused when I witnessed the great
devastation and suffering caused in India
by the great epidemic diseases such as
cholera and bubonic plague—with the
latter I had a somewhat close personal
and painful acquaintance—and when I
realised the immense losses caused by the
epidemic diseases of animals, such as
rinderpest. This interest was renewed
when I witnessed in Africa the pitiable
wrecks of mankind who were suffering
from sleeping sickness, or when I came
into contact with the horrible disﬁgure-
ment of yaws, almost a universal com-
plaint in some parts of Africa, or when
I saw vast areas of land, untenanted
either by man or cattle because of the
ravages of tripanosomiasis, or rinderpest,
or East Coast fever. It is experiences
such as these which offer one, in a more
insistent and dramatic way than is pos-
sible in this country, proof of the
scourges of nature for which modern
science has to ﬁnd a remedy. I have
witnessed in my own lifetime the grow-
ing measure of control which science has
achieved over these terrible scourges, and
have seen the beneﬁcent effects on the
peoples of the countries concerned and on
their animal population. I have never
heard it questioned that, in regard at all
events to the great scourges which I have
just mentioned, this measure of control
has been effected as a result of experi-
ments on animals, and could not possibly
have been achieved had that agency not
been available.

It was this experience which led me
some years ago to become closely asso-
ciated with the Research Defence Society,
which was founded during the sittings of
the Royal Commission which began in
1906. Their main object was to combat
the activities of certain anti-vivisectionist
societies, which were at that period very
militant in their activities. These bodies
no longer ﬁnd it possible to take so mili-
tant an attitude, for there has been a
great expansion of scientiﬁc education in

 




 

 

 

 

 

Experiments

643

[Lord Hailey]

the last half century. But they are still
capable of creating a great deal of preju-
dice and misunderstanding, and members
of the Defence Research Society, to
which I belong, still have an active func-
tion in serving as a source of information
to the public, both in regard to the vast
debt which society owes to the use of
animals in surgical and medical experi-
ment and also in conveying informa-
tion as to the safeguards under
which those experiments are carried out.
I believe that the men of science who are
associated in the Society of which I speak
are as humane in their outlook on the
use of animals for experiments as any
noble Lord in this House could be: they
would recoil as strongly from the inﬂic-
tion of any avoidable suffering, and they
would readily co-operate in any change
of law or regulation designed to effect
this result. But they are determined to
resist, by any legitimate means in their
power, any unreasonable curtailment of
the power which they now enjoy, subject
to the conditions laid down by law—the
‘ power, that is, of utilising experiments on
animals as a means of gaining the know-
ledge necessary to lessen the burden of
disease and suffering in human society
and in the animal world.

Their task in maintaining this attitude
has, I may say, been somewhat lightened
in recent years by certain views expressed
by the highest courts in this country,
including that of the House of Lords.
These decisions were given in the course
of dealing with the claim made by one
of the anti-vivisection societies to enjoy
exemption from income tax on its invest-
ments, on the ground that it was a
charitable institution. The courts found
it necessary to inquire whether the objec-
tive of the society, so far as it involved
the total abolition of all forms of experi-
ments on animals, would or would not
conduce to the public welfare. They
accepted and fully endorsed the evidence
presented to them on behalf of the
Crown, that the use of experiments on
animals had led to a number of most
'beneﬁcent discoveries affecting human
and animal health, which could not have
been achieved by any other means. They
united in expressing the doubt that the
attainment of the professed object of the
anti-vivisection society in question—
namely, the total abolition of vivisection

H.L. so A 1.6

[ LORDS]

 

 

644

on Animals

in any form—would prove injurious to
the community. One of the Lords J us-
tices, Lord Justice McKinnon, expressed
himself in very emphatic terms on this
point He said that the object of the
society, so far from being beneﬁcial,
“might with reason he stigmatised as malig-
nantly designed for the injury of the
community.” -
That was a pronouncement which must
meet with the support of anyone who
realises that the society had demanded
of the Royal Commission of 1912 that it
should stop inoculation against rinder-
pest; that in 1914 it spent a great deal
of money and effort in order to prevent
troops undergoing preventive inoculation
against typhoid, and that to-day it has
waged a campaign against the adoption
of the system of inoculation against
diphtheria.

I am well aware that the noble and
gallant Lord, in putting forward this
Motion, has perhaps” not gone the whole
way of some of these societies. His own
principles are such as were describe-d in
some of the judgments to which I have
referred. His own principles lead him
to advocate as a ﬁnal aim the abolition
of all forms of experiment on animals,
whether surgical or medical ; but he hesi-
tates to take that step at the present
moment. All he urges is that there should
be an inquiry into the method of the
working of the 1876 Act ; that the system
of inspectorate should be tightened up ;
that control should be exercised over the
issue of certiﬁcates, and that all those
who use experiments on animals should
be forced to declare the purposes for
which the experiments are made.

I do not believe that the scientiﬁc
world would object to any form of in-
quiry in cases where this was shown to be
necessary. It is admitted that in some
respects the Act is out of date and may
need amendment, but the scientiﬁc world
would, I think, with the assent of large
numbers of the public, object strongly to
any curtailment . on the part of the
Government, or on the part of the Home

'Department and its inspectors, as to the

range of experiments which they should
carry out. I feel myself that the result
of any such inquiry would be once more
to stimulate the energies of the anti-
vivisection societies to advocate once
more the total abolition of all forms of
experiment on animals, whether surgical

or medical, with the result that science
would be deprived not merely of the
means of achieving advance in physio-
logical science but also of the means of
testing and standardising drugs, and the
means of testing new processes as applied
to medical science. As a result, we should
ﬁnd that once again there would be a
campa1gn against the use of experiments
on animals, a campaign supported on a
great deal of misrepresentation, and the
misuse, in some cases, of a statement as
to the purpose of the experiments.

Undoubtedly we should run that danger.
It IS a danger Wthh I think the scientiﬁc
world, in this country at all events, would
deprecate. _ There 1s a real danger of mis-
representations of this kind. Let me, for
example, read one passage from the Re-
port of the Commission of 1912, which
referred 1n particular to one of the dangers
to Wth‘h I have alluded. It said:

J e4 We desire further to state that the harrow-
ingdescriptions and illustrations of operations
1nﬂ1cted on animals, which are frequently cir-
culated by post, advertisement or otherwise,
are in many cases calculated to mislead the
public, in so far as they suggest that the
animals m question were not under an anaes-
thetic. To represent that animals subjected to
experiments 1n this country are wantonly tor-

tured would, in our opinion, be absolutely
false.”

It is danger of this description to the
progress of science that I and many of my
friends would deprecate.

pose to say only two or three words which
may perhaps be of some comfort to the
noble and gallant Lord who initiated this
debate. Forty or more years ago I was
Secretary to the Royal Commission on
Experiments on Animals. It was a very
strong Commission. Lord Selby, the late
Speaker, was Chairman, and Sir William
Church and Sir Andrew McFadyean, dis-
tinguished medical men, sat on the Board.
I cannot, of course, recapitulate any indi-
vidual items of evidence, but I am quite
clear that the impression left on the minds
of all of us at the end of that long Com-
mission—it sat for nearly seven years,
when our Report was published—was that
the greatest care was exercised by the
Home Ofﬁce and the authorities under
. them in supervision and ensuring adher-
ence to the regulations. About the value
of the experiments I am not competent
to speak, but we were completely satisﬁed

that the regulations were not broken. and

that every sort of bar was placed upon
the opportunity of inﬂicting unnecessary
suffering —— whatever “ unnecessary ”
means. That may, possibly, put the
noble Lord’s mind at rest on one side of
the question.

LORD WEBB-JOHNSON: My Lords,
I am in complete sympathy with the
noble Lord who moved this Motion in
his anxiety that we should be always
watchful that proper precautions are
taken in the issue of certiﬁcates
authorising experimenters to carry out
operations on animals. It is good to be
watchful; but under the Act several
watch-dogs have been appointed. I
myself for eight years, as President of the
Royal College of Surgeons, acted as a
watch-dog; and I refused to sign many
applications for licences for experiments,
either because the experimenter was not
working under conditions which I con-
sidered satisfactory or because I thought
(a point which has been emphasised by
the noble and gallant Lord, Lord
Dowding) that the experiment had been

. repeated a suﬁicient number of times to

prove that the results obtained were
actually established as facts. Experi-
ments have to be repeated at certain
number of times because the essence of
experimental science is that any result
which is achieved by one research worker
can be repeated by another; otherwise
the statement of the ﬁrst is open to doubt.

In regard to supervision, I should like
to inform your Lordships that my visits
to other countries, including some which
we regard as the most tender-hearted and
civilised, have satisﬁed me that the prev
cautions taken in this country are stricter
than those in any other country in the
world. The British safeguards are, I
think, sufﬁcient. Moreover, your Lord—
ships can take it as a fact that those who
are engaged in experimental science in-
volving work on animals are just as
humane as any of those who oppose ex-
periments on animals. They are just as
anxious to spare the animals suffering as
much as possible. it is all a question of
relative values.

We must not shrink from doing an
experiment which may involve pain and
may require the survival of the animal
after the operation. We must notshrink
from it any more than an experimental
worker, where necessary, does not shrink

 




 

 

647

[Lord Webb-Johnson]

from experimenting 011 himself. I have
put sixty-nine stitches into myself for the
purpose of ascertaining what was the
best absorbable suture material. And
who can fail to be moved by the thought
of Pasteur—of the courage and heroism
of the man sucking saliva from the mouth
of a mad dog in order to make sure that
he had got the poisonous virus of rabies?
Nor does one hesitate to give perhaps an
even greater due to the attendant who
held the rabid animal and who was not
spurred on by the scientiﬁc urge for new
knowledge but knew only what the
pursuit was.

We can also pay a tribute to those
great heroes of the American Army
Corps who in Panama sacriﬁced their
lives to prove what was the vector of the
injecting organism of yellow fever. They
slept in a hut in the discarded and soiled
clothing of those who had died of the
disease ; they slept in a hut with patients
who had yellow fever ; and they slept in
a hut containing mosquitoes who had
feasted themselves on the blood of yellow
fever patients. They paid the inevitable
price. It is a taie of heroism equal to
that in any other ﬁeld of human
endeavour. The suggestion that experi-
mental workers are indifferent to the
suffering of animals on whom they
experiment is very far from the truth.
That does not mean that I do not still
sympathise with the noble and gallant
Lord, Lord Dowding, in his desire for
vigilance.

Before I sit down, perhaps I may refer
to experimental surgery, to which par-
ticular reference has been made. Experi-
mental surgery generally involves opera-
tions on dogs. The dog, in certain
breeds, is an animal of just sufficient size
to give a surgeon an opportunity to
ascertain whether a certain operation can
be done, and the experiment generally
means allowing the survival of the
animal. Take the developments of only
the last few years. Dramatic facts have
been brought to light with the applica-
tion of certain techniques. The blood
vessels in the neighbourhood of the heart
can be joined to each other like pieces
of gut. I saw other experiments when I
was at Harvard just before I came back
from my last visit to America, and I
have seen them repeated since. I saw
the placing of an artiﬁcial valve in the
aorta carrying blood all over the body.

H.L. so B 2

Experiments

[ LORDS]

 

 

648

I have seen the natural valve replaced by
a plastic valve. I saw a dog which had
been operated upon eight months before
and was raced around the track attached
to the laboratory. The only difference
between that dog and any other dog was
that when you listened to the heart you
could hear the “ click click ” of the
plastic ball valve instead of just the
closing of the natural valve.

on Animals

Those things are worth doing. Human
lives have been saved as a result of these
operations on the great vessels. Many
children’s live have been saved, and they
will grow up to be useful citizens, as a
result of experiments on the heart. Those
are dramatic results. And we are now
only just raising the curtain. The blood
can be led out of the body and put
through an artiﬁcial circulation and re-
turned to the body. Thus the heart can
"be stilled while an operation is per-
formed. These things can be done only
by experiment. The blood can be taken
out of the body when the kidneys go on
strike and acute congestion is causing the
patient’s life to be in imminent danger
leading, perhaps, to death within forty-
eight hours or less. The blood can be led
through an artiﬁcial kidney and be
brought back into circulation, and at the
end of forty—eight hours the kidney has
had time to recover and function again.
These things are worth while. It is a
matter of relative values. So, while I
sympathise with the noble and gallant
Lord’s anxiety, I do urge that he should
not press his Motion, for nothing must
be done to interfere with the progress of
science.

4.21 pm.

LORD SEMPILL: My Lords, others
who haVe spoken have said that they sym-
pathise with the noble and gallant Lord’s
views on this matter. I join with their
Lordships who have spoken in expressing
similar sentiments. I was very impressed
with the remarks made by my noble
friend Lord Webb-Johnson. The noble
and gallant Lord, Lord Dowding, in his
speeCh made reference to certain experi-
ments on dogs. I am sure he would not
like a tribute to be paid, wrongly in
my humble submission, to another
country, the USA, since the expen-
ments to which the noble Lord referred
in feeding dogs with bread of the variety
that is served out to-day, loaded with,
amongst other things, nitrogen trichloride,

were ﬁrst carried out in France about two
hundred years ago, and then forgotten.

The recent experiments, which are so
well known and which have been quoted
1n your Lordships’ House time and time
agamand also in the United States of
America, were initiated and carried out
under the direction of Sir Edward Mel-
lanby, then Secretary of the Medical Re-
search Council. I should not like the
statement of the noble and gallant Lord,
Lord Dowding, to go by, as he omitted
to pay tribute to one of the leading men
in this country. Sir Edward has pointed
out the evil of adding this chemical to
bread, as he declares that it then becomes
not suitable for human consumption.

4.23 pm.

THE EARL OF SELKIRK: My Lords,
I should like to thank the noble and
gallant Lord, Lord Dowding, for giving
me the advantage of seeing some of the
notes which he prepared for his remarks
to-day. I am grateful to him. It would
be idle for me to pretend that the sub-
ject which the noble and gallant Lord
has raised is not one of great contro-
versy. I am fully aware that diametric-
ally opposed views are held on this
subject, and are expressed with great
force and conviction. The extreme View
on one side-~and I recognise that there
IS a moral issue in this subject—is that
the conduct of experiments on animals,
no matter what those experiments pro-
duce, is wrong. The noble and, gallant
Lord has pressed substantially that View
himself to-day: that, no matter what
advantage is to be gained from it, man
is over-stepping his dominion in under-
taking that type of work. The other
View is that in the search for knowledge,
particularly medical knowledge, any
sacriﬁce, either human or animal, is justi-
fied. That is the other extreme. These
Views are irreconcilable and I do not

attempt to draw them together ; nor have

I any duty to do so. On behalf of the
Home Ofﬁce, who have no interest either
in the promotion of experiments or in
their suppression, I say that our duty is
to see that the Act of 1876 is carried
out- It is that task which I propose to
try to discharge this. afternoon.

The noble and gallant Lord, Lord
Dowding, has suggested that the Act is
gravely defective and that, in any case,
it is not enforced. I should like to go

ILL. 50 B 5 '

under stringent conditions.

into those two points, because they are
matters on which Parliament will neces-
sarily have to decide. Before doing so,
may I say that the Act of 1876 is, I
think, unique in the world, in the sense
that no other country has an Act of that
character provided for that purpose.
That point was made by the noble Lord,
Lord Webb-Johnson, in the extremely
interesting speech which he made this
afternoon. I should also like to suggest
that some, and perhaps the most harrow-
ing of the examples which the noble and
gallant Lord, Lord Dowding, has given
were drawn from abroad. May I make
the further point that even if the use of
animals for training and practice in
surgery does exist in other countries, it
is specifically forbidden by Statute here.

I shall now run through the Act. of
1876, such as it is. It is now seventy-ﬁve
years old. First of all, it provides that
no experiments on living vertebrates—I
am given to understand that a very wide
interpretation is applied to the word
“ vertebrate ”-——may be carried out except
Such experi-
ments can be carried out only for deﬁnite
purposes—that is to say for the acquisi-
tion of knowledge useful in the saving
of life or the alleviation of suffering and
for certain other purposes of that
character, which are laid down in the
Statute. Before anyone obtains a licence
he requires two signatures, one from the
president of a learned society, and the
other from a professor of a branch of
medical science. The noble Lord, Lord
Webb-Johnson, as, I think, President
formerly of a learned society, gave a
certain number of these signatures, but I
should like the noble and gallant Lord,
Lord Dowding, to note particularly that
Lord Webbulohnson stated that he
refused a number of licences because he
considered the man incompetent or, at
all events, unsuited to carry out that par-
ticular work. The same, I know, applies
in regard to the professor of medical
science, who also has to give his signature
and in many cases its-possibly better
equipped to judge, in the sense that he
would know more of the applicant than
the president Of a learned society, who
may or may not be'so closely acquainted
with the experimenter persOnally. ‘

the whole operation, and if the pain is
likely to continue after the anaesthetic has
ceased, the animal must he killed before
recovery. Experiments can be carried out
only in registered places, and full records
must be kept and annual reports sub-
mitted stating the number and nature of
experiments performed. These
places are, of course, open for inspection
at all times. These, as the noble Lord
has stated, are the basic conditions of the
Act.

Certiﬁcates can be granted which vary
these basic conditions, and those certiﬁ-
cates are known as Certiﬁcates A, B, C,
E and F. I will take them in the reverse
order. Certiﬁcate F deals with horses and
donkeys. A special certiﬁcate is required
before any experiments can be carried out
on these animals. Certiﬁcate E deals with
dogs, on which no experiment may be
carried out unless they are completely
under an anmsthetic, with death before
recovery. It is only under a certiﬁcate
E that such an. experiment can be carried
out. Certiﬁcate C permits experiments to
be performed in the illustration of a lec-
ture. Such experiments must be con-

it it"s-perhaps natural that in regard to
Certiﬁcates A and B a certain amount of
controversy has arisen. Certiﬁcate A per-
mits an experiment to be carried out with-
out an anaesthetic, and Certiﬁcate B per-
mits an animal to recover after the
Before
a certiﬁcate of this character can be
granted it is necessary for the applicant
to obtain two signatures of the type which
i. have already described. Those signa-
tories must state speciﬁcally that the
dispensation sought is necessary—that the
object of the experiment would be
frustrated if the animal were killed. That
represents a fairly strong statement, if I
may say so, from the President of the
Royal College of Surgeons. But, besides
this, the applicant has also to obtain the
recommendation" and signature of the
chief inspector, and has also to satisfy the
Department that the dispensation is neceso
sary. l have been into this matter and I
can say that that stage is not a formality,
either. When the certiﬁcate is granted it

carried out without an anaesthetic it is
stated that .

“No operative procedure more severe than

superﬁcial venesection or Simple inoculation
may be adopted in any of the said experi—
ments.”
Under Certiﬁcate B, where the animal is
allowed to recover, the condition lays
down that strict antiseptic precautions
must he carried out, and if these fail, the
animal must be killed.

Over and above these conditions, the
certiﬁcates are subject to what are known
as the pain clause, which I should like to
read, because I think it is not un-
important. It is as follows:

“ If an animal at any time during any of the
said experiments is found to be suffering pain
which is either severe or is likely to endure,
and if the main result of the experiment has

been obtained, the animal shall forthwith be
painlessly killed;

If an animal at any time during any of
the said experiments is found to be suffering
severe pain which is likely to endure, such
animal shall forthwith be painlessly killed;

If an animal appears to an Inspector to
be suffering considerable pain, and if such In-
spector directs such animal to be destroyed, it
shall forthwith be painlessly killed.”

These are the conditions which are the
background of the law as it stands at the
present time.

The number of experiments which are
carried out (a matter to which the noble
Lord has referred) is, of. course, consider-
able, but I am informed that in practice
almost all this work under Certiﬁcate A
concerns inoculations, the application of
a substance, or the administration of a
drug or toxin. l should perhaps add that
when a certiﬁcate is granted the inspector
has to recommend whether the applicant’s
knowledge, experience and ability are
adequate, and, moreover, that the place
is suitable for the performance of such
an experiment. When the inspector feels
that he cannot make such a recommenda-
tion, the matter is referred to the Advisory
Committee, which is appointed by the
Secretary of, State, from a panel sub!
mitted by the RoyalSociety, the Royal
College of Physicians and the Royal Col—
lege—of Surgeons. I am able to say that
the Home Secretary has recently decided
to add to the Committee a person
nominated by the Royal College of
Veterinary Surgeons.

My Lords, I think it is clear that the
whole object, of, this Act is-to reduce
spliering to the absolute »-ininimum, and

. \,

 

 

 

 




 

 

 

 

65-3

the question which may remain with the
noble Lord, Lord Dowding, is whether
the inspectors are suﬁiciently rigid in
enforcing to the letter the terms of the
Act itself. Therefore, I should like to
say one or two words about the inspectors.
They are appointed by the Secretary of
State and are responsible to him for their
duties. The post is advertised in the
ordinary way and the inspectors are
appointed on the recommendation of a
Civil Service board. Their duty is to
see that this Act is. properly carried out,
and I can only presume that they would
be sacked if they did not fulﬁl their duties
properly. I may add that it is not normal
to select for this post a person who has
ever held a licence under the Act. Their
duties are to Visit regularly all the regis-
tered places on their list, and I am in-
formed that this amounts to a visit nearly
once a quarter. In almost every case
these visits are unannounced.

Experiments

The chief inspector receives some 1,200
reports a year from his sub—inspectors,
and submits an annual report to the
Secretary of State which is presented to
Parliament. As I think anyone who reads
them knows, in these reports, are recorded
the irregularities brought to his notice in
the course of the year. The inspector,
amongst other things, scrutinis-es all
publications dealing with experiments,
and satisﬁes himself that each of these
published experiments has been carried
out under proper authority. This is quite
a considerable work. The Ministry of

[14 OCTOBER 1952]

 

Supply establishments for defence pur- .

poses are licensed and inspected in
ex ctly the same way as any other
laboratory in the country. As I have
already said, the inspector has to approve
the nature of the experiment, and such
approval has also to be obtained from the
Department.

I should like to emphasise that it is

 

 

quite wrong to suggest that this is in any ,

way a formality,
Act (and l have every belief that, so far as
is possible, it is carriedout) is to prevent
useless experiments ; t‘nereeXperiment "for
no useful purpose 'is not'within- the terms
of the Act. It is true, as the noble Lord
has pointed out, that in 1878 there-were
two part-tints: inspectors, whereas to-day
the establishment is for five full-time
inspectors, although, of course, the
number of- reported experiments has
inereased,considerably Since the earlier
date. But the chief-inspectoi' assures me
H.L. so B 5

“The purpose of the

r—_—_—__ __ ._ ..__ ..___ _‘.__—___.-

 

654

that he is fully satisﬁed that he knows
what is going on in every place on his
register in this country. I think perhaps
it is fair to point out that since 1878
telephones and motor cars have come
into general use and it is possible for
one man to cover a much wider area
than would have been possible at the
former date. It is true that there have
been no prosecutions under the Act, but
I do not think that is a wholly satisfac-
tory way of judging the success of the
Statute because, besides noting the
irregularities each year in the annual
report to which I referred, certiﬁcates
and licences have been refused, warnings
have been issued; and in certain cases
matters have been «brought to the atten-
tion of heads of departments or to senior.
oﬂicials of the universities concerned.

The noble Lord has raised the question
of the production of sera. It is true that
this is not covered by the Act of 1876,

on Animals

because it is not regarded as being of

an experimental nature. It is worth
noting, however, that this work is covered
by the Protection of Animals Act, 1911,
so that anyone who is not engaged in ,
experimental work is subject, should he
perform such work, to prosecution for
cruelty in the ordinary way, without what
the noble Lord referred to as the more
advantageous position of the Act of 1876.
”This work is carried out, and inspectors
are appointed, ‘unde~ the Therapeutic
Substances Act of 1925, to look after it.
The inspectors are responsible for ensur-
ing that the places where the work is
carried on are suitable for their purposes
and that the animals are maintained in a
healthy condition. I may say that the
inspectors are appointed by the Ministry
of Health in England and by the Depart—
ment of Health in Scotland. If any sera
are tested, that is regarded as an experi-
ment, and as such it comes under the
original Act of 1876. »

tioiied a number of cases which I do not
think any of us could, hear without being

deeply repellent. I- should say that a fair

carefully investigated. l am assured that
they have been gone into with great
thoroughness. Simply on hearing what
the noble and gallant Lord has said this
afternoon,and without being in possession
of a great deal more detail relating to
the circumstances, it really is not possible
to form a clear picture of what is hap~
pening. I am informed that the Secretary
of State came to the conclusion, after
hearing all that the delegation had to
say, and after making very thorough in-
quiries, that no sufﬁcient ground existed,
either as respected the law or its adminis-
tration, to justify him in recommending
the appointment of a fresh Royal Com-
mission on the subject. I have to say
that there is nothing which has arisen
recently which has caused [my right
honourable friend to take a different View.

Experiments

l have tried to deal fairly and fully
with these two questions—the question of
the law as it stands, and the question of
its administration. I have tried to show
what the law is. I am not saying that the
law is perfect, but what I do say is that
my right honourable friend is satisﬁed
that the inspectors, acting on his behalf,
carry out the full letter of the law as it
exists. The noble and gallant Lord, Lord
Dowding, has not pressed very hard on
the question of whether these experiments
are useful or not. I think that that is a
point which has been fully dealt with by
noble Lords who are much better quali-
ﬁed to speak upon it than I am. I would
say only that the opinions of two Royal
Commissions~~that of 1875 and that of
19lZ-———are on record and can be studied.
Both those Commissions dealt with this
matter, and their views on the question
of the usefulness of experiments can be
fully borne out. I think I have now
covered the points which affect the De-
partment, and I would emphasise that
those responsible are carrying out their
task to the full. I, cannot, i suppose, hope
to have convinced the noble and gallant
Lord that the situation is satisfactory.
Some of , his remarks seemed to me to
convey the impression that he thought
the- Department treated . their respon-
sibilities under the Act ratherﬂlightly. I
am certain that, that is not the case, and
I. ask the noble Lerd to accept my assur-
ance that those who are engaged in this
Work are carrying it out conscientiously
and. to the; best of their; ability. I will
not ‘addanything further, ,_ except to say

4.44 pm.

LORD DOWDING: My Lords, some
years ago I was in the position of one
under authority saying unto the noble
Earl, Lord Selkirk, “Do this,” and he
did it. But that state of affairs no longer
exists. I am grateful to the noble Earl
for so nearly covering the scope of my
recommendations—I say “ so nearly ”
because I think there was one point which
he entirely failed to cover. I also thank '
other noble Lords who have taken part
in this debate, but I will not go into all
the points raised in their speeches. Lord
Hailey was a little concerned to refute my
personal opinions against these animal
experiments altogether, but I said speci-
ﬁcally that I did not want to press them
to-day. As I say, the points that I raised
have been, with one exception, covered
by the noble Earl. I am deeply obliged
to him for the trouble which he has taken
in formulating his reply to my Motion.

~ There are just one or two matters
upon which I should like. to touch. The
noble Earl spoke of the use of animals in
connection with training and practice in
surgery. I did not raise that matter
myself although it was in my mind. I
rather thought that the contention was
one that was not raised nowadays. It
has certainly been repudiated in fairly
strong terms by notable surgeons. But
I am interested to know that it is
still in the minds of the authorities that
these experiments can be made in con—
nection with training and practice in
surgery. I did not go at length into the
sections in the Act relating to pain—~—
which the noble Earl has now explained
e~for 1 did not wish to make my speech
too long. But it seems to me that the
real point is that the person who decides
whether the pain is severe, or whether the
pain is prolonged, or whether it is pro-
longed and severe, and so on, is the
experimenter himself. . Therefore it
seems tome that his conclusionson this
matter are not of any great value, I
was interested to learn that the number
of inspectors is considered adequate to-
day. The noble Earl gave us to under-
stand that each place where experiments
are carried out is visited, roughly, once

 

 

  




 

 

 

657

a quarter. My own information rather
1ndicates that visits are somewhat less
frequent than that. At any rate, if these
1nspectors are able to get round to these
numerous places once every quarter it
Speaks volumes for their industry.

The two noble Lords who have taken
part in the debate suggested that most of
the harrowing accounts which I gave of
painful experiments on animals came
from abroad. That is not the case. I
mentioned only two instances from
abroad. One was the horrible experi-
ment of pumping boiling water into a
dog’s veins, and the other was that of the
dreadful rotating drum in which animals
are slowly battered to death. All the
other instances I gave were of experi-
ments carried'out in this country. If I
did not give sufﬁcient chapter and verse
for them, I can say only that I shall be
glad to supply the noble Earl with fur-
ther and fuller information, but all
information comes out of the published
accounts in scientiﬁc and medical
journals.

The point that I think was not covered
in the noble Earl’s reply concerns the
testing of drugs and sera.
to the manufacture of sera, but it is this
vast new industry of using animals as
machines to test drugs, of which I think
I gave adequate instances in my speech,
which, it seems to me, requires an im-
partial investigation. I would ask the
noble Earl whether he will reconsider
that point. The last Report of a Royal
Commission on this question was pub-
lished in 1912, and I think nobody will
deny that very great changes have taken
place since then. So I would ask him
whether he will be so kind as to confer
again with the Home Secretary to see if
some rather more impartial inquiry that
an ex parte statement from the Home
Oﬂice itself cannot be made into the

largely changed conditions which have ‘

arisen since 1912.

THE EARL OF SELKIRK: My Lords,
I have mentioned the subject of the test~
ing of drugs: that is directly under the

EL. 50 B 7

[14 OCTOBER 1952]

 

 

658

Act as it stands, and all safeguards that
exist apply in regard to this sphere. The
only matter is the number of tests which
are carried out. I should like to ask
the noble Lord one thing: why did he
speak of an “ex parte statement” fro-m
the Home Office? The Home Ofﬁce
have no interest in experiments on ani-
mals or in suppressing the experiments.
They have certain duties laid down by
Statute, and I do not think they can be
accused, if I may use that word, of
making an ex parte statement.

LORD DOWDING: My Lords, I
readily withdraw that word. I was
speaking, of course, without notes and
without preparation. All that was in
my mind was that the statement which
we have been given to-day comes from
the Home Ofﬁce, and I should like to
see an inquiry conducted in which some
sections of the community outside the
Home Ofﬁce were included. For ex-
ample, l was glad to hear that a mem-
ber of the Royal College of Veterinary
Surgeons had been included in the
membership of the Advisory Committee.

have the leave of the House, I beg leave

a statement for the public hearing of the subcommittee of the
House Committee on Agriculture April 2, 1957, to consider

humane slaughter 1e gislationt

My name is Christine Stevens. I am president of the Animal Welfare

Institute and, in that capacity, I have made a study of humane slaughtering methods,

visiting slaughterhouses in the United States, England, Holland and Denmark. The

Institute is sponsoring scientific research on slaughtering methods, including
studies on electrical stunning and on the anesthetization of the bovine species with
carbon dioxide“ This work is being conducted at Michigan State University. The
Institute has collected a substantial body of technical information on the practical
application of all humane methods of slaughter, as well as information on the

historical background and legal status of humane slaughter throughout the world.

So far as we have been able to ascertain, neither the underdeveloPed
countries nor the Communist countries have humane slaughter legislation, How-
ever, laws requiring packers to use humane methods of slaughter are in force in
England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Holland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway,
Finland, Switzerland, New Zealand, Fiji, and parts of Australia, Austria, .

Germany and France,

Why is the United States absent from this list? Why does our country fall
instead into a class with the technologically backward among nations and, far
worse, into a class with those nations whose Communist rulers have no pity for
either peeple or animals and no shame in the perpetration of cruelty? The reason
is not hard to find. It is the packers whose stubborn resistance to humane

slaughter is responsible for this national disgrace.

About thirty years ago humanitarians made great efforts to change the

cruel methods in use then and still in use today to kill the large majority of our

 




food animals, Under this sharp stimulus, the American Meat Institute, which

represents the largest and most powerful members of the industry, formed its

"Committee for Improved Slaughtering Methods” in 19299 The packers promised
to adopt humane methods voluntarily. A major speaker at the convention of the
American Humane As sociation in that year announced with confidence that "the

packers are with us"”

Events have proved conclusively that they are noti Since 1929 the organized
packing industry has carried out formal scientific research on a single humane
method: electrical stunningo As a result of that research they managed to obtain
a regulation against electrical stunning by the Department of Agriculture. The
validity of the research has been questioned by later scientific findings, but the

regulation still stands.

Now the packers are sponsoring bills in. both the House and the Senate
(H. R0 5820 and S) 1213) to do research with government funds and thereby put off
again for two more years at least the enactment of compulsory humane slaughter
legislation; No country in the world has ever achieved humane slaughter for the
majority of its food animals until compulsory humane slaughter legislation has

been enacted“

During the course of these hearings, it will doubtless be observed that
everyone who testifies states that he is in favor of humane slaughter. How can it
be, then, that hundreds of millions of helpless animals continue to be slaughtered
without the slightest attempt to prevent acute pain, terror, and foreknowledge of
death? Actions speak louder than words, and it is time that the packers' empty
words and broken promises be recognized for what they are.) It is time to enact

compulsory humane slaughter legislation,3

 




America's greatest strength is her-moral strength, Americans abhor
cruelty.) It is inconceivable that a relatively small and completely selfish group
should be allowed to continue practicing unnecessary cruelty which is contrary to

the principles on which our country was founded,

Since everyone, even the most implacable opponents of compulsory
legislation, takes the position that humane slaughter is desirable, the question on
which the distinguished members of this committee are asked to make a decision
is whether or not packers should be required to use humane methodsg In order to
do that, the arguments against compulsion should be carefully reviewed and
seriously consideredg The packers offer five arguments against humane slaughter

legislation of this kinda,

First, they say that it isn‘t necessary because they will adopt humane
methods voluntarilyo But they have had nearly thirty years in which to make good
their promises to do so,, Many hundreds of millions -- more than a billion
animals .. have died in agony because the packers have been so successful in
fooling the public, in putting off again and yet again the day when they abandon
their primeval slaughtering methods, If they really plan to adopt humane methods,
how can they honestly object to legislation which gives them two to three years to

put the method of their choice into Operation? Nevertheless, object they do“

Their second argument consists of complaints that humane slaughter is too

expensive for small packers, In making this assertion they do not, of course, say

that the humane stunners (the Cash~X captive bolt pistol, the Schermer stunner

and the Remington stunner) which range in price from $100 to $220 cost too much.
Their complaints on cost have been directed solely against the carbon dioxide
anesthetizing equipment,» Testimony was offered last year by all three packer

organizations at the Senate hearing on the compulsory humane slaughter bills

 




Mr. Larson, testifying for the American Meat Institute, said, "If
you could develop those things,(CO; machines) keep the cost down of the
equipment and operation, it would be fine, we would all go along with you.
If you have to spend $75, 000 or $100, 000 for just that particular equipment
alone, it just could not be done. " Mr. Larson slaughters 150 hogs a week,
and we surely agree with him that 75 to 100 thousand dollars is an

unreasonably big cost for equipment for his size of plant. Mr. Barnette,

also testifying for the American Meat Institute and slaughtering 175 hogs a

week, stated, ”It would cost no less than $100, 000” for the carbon dioxide
equipment, and he further said, ”We hope that something will be developed
that will allow us to join in as quickly as we can in carrying out the slaughter
from as humane a standpoint as it can be. ” Mr. Lilienquist,representing
the Western States Meat Packers Association, said, "The cost of treating
hogs with carbon dioxide gas to render them insensible prior to slaughter

is far beyond the financial reach of the small meat packers. " Mr. La Roe,
testifying for the'National Independent Meat Packers, emphasized the same
points: ”They are not satisfied with present arrangements for slaughter,
and they welcome any improvement, and what scares them to death is these
big figures of cost. ” Mr. La Roe concluded his prepared statement with

the following sentence: “If you will keep it on your docket for 12 months and
call us back to show cause what has been done in the 12 months, that will be
a very reasonable policy and will avoid harshness and the dangerous effect

of sudden 1e gislation. "

Since Mr. La Roe made this statement, eleven months have gone by,
and an extremely important development has taken place. It is now
possible to purchase a carbon dioxide anesthetizing machine for

approximately $3 , 500 in this country, Such a machine will. anesthetize up

-4-

 




to 60 hogs or other small animals per hour. Cost of carbon dioxide is less
than a penny per animal. Including installation cost, the expenditure might
reach $5, 000 M not just 100% or 200% less than the amount the small

packers imagined it would cost, but two thousand per cent less.

At this price? any one of the approximately 500 packers operating
under Federal Meat Inspection, engaged in interstate or foreign commerce,
would be able to afford to install a piece of practical, bruiseupreventing
equipment of this kind. The improvement in his labor relations and public

relations alone should soon repay the investinenta

Earthen if he believes that he could build himself an anesthetizing

machine at lower cost than he can purchase it, there is nothing to prevent

him from purchasing carbon dioxide and building himself a small elevator

for lowering animals into the gas before slaughter.

Last year cheap anesthetizing machines were available in Europe
but not in America. This year, this equipment is available in different
sizes and shapes for all types of plants ranging from $3, 500 to $39, 000*,
the latter figure being cost of equipment capable of handling 600 hogs per
hour. The average cost of installation is about half again as much as the
cost of the equipment, if the packer desires to install a bleeding conveyor,
in addition, he may do so, but i’S is not necessary for compliance with

compulsory humane slaughter legislation,

*Cost of anesthetizing equipment for different sized plants as

estimated by the Allbright~Nell Company, February, 1957:
60 hogs and under per hour 95» 3, 500
60-120 hogs per hour $ 9, 000
12l~150 hogs per hour $ 14, 700
ISL-300 hogs per hour $ 23, 700
SOL-450 hogs per hour $ 31,, 000
451 -600 hogs per hour 35 39, 000

 




With a carbon dioxide anesthetizing machine of a size suitable to his
Operation, and any one of the three stunning instruments on the market,
every packer can humanely kill in a practical and efficient manner every
animal received in his plant. Most would probably elect to anesthetize hogs
and sheep with CO2. and stun cattle with a mechanical instant stunner, The

methods have the approval of the Department of Agriculture’s

Small, neighborhood butchers who do not engage in interstate and
foreign commerce would not be affected by federal legislation on the subject
and would not be required to conform to its provisions, However, any small
packer who wishes to do so can follow the lead of the small Operators who
voluntarily shoot all the animals they slaughter with a rifle or pistol just
before bleeding, This does not require any investment at all other than

the ammunition,

To sum up, if there is any packer engaged in interstate and foreign
commerce who would be put out of business by the costs noted above, I
urge this Committee to ask him to identify himselfg My inquiries have failed

to unearth such a packeri

These inquiries have, however, brought to light a packer attitude
which shows why it will be necessary to enact compulsory legislation if we
are to achieve humane slaughter in our country. A typical response to
current requests by humanitarians to packers to install humane equipment
voluntarily is to the effect that: 1) ”We are going to wait until the research
promised under the packers' preposed study commission bill is done before

we install any equipment“ (this means no purchase of any humane equipment

till 1959 at the earliest and no guarantee that it will ever be purchased) and 2) ”If

-6...

 




the compulsory bill passes, instead of the study commission bill, everybody
will have to buy humane equipment, and so the price will probably go down.

So we‘ll wait and see if it doesn‘t. "

The second attitude is not based on actual cost of equipment or
ability to purchase it but merely on the desire to get a bargain. There is
nothing wrong with this very natural and very widespread desire, but it, is
necessary to recognize its existence so as to avoid the mistaken belief that

humane methods of slaughter will be voluntarily adapted by all packers, or

 

even by a majority of packers engaged in interstate commerce.

No financial obstacles of any consequence exist to prevent immediate
enactment of compulsory humane slaughter legislation, All the bills allow
two years to adopt humane methods, with an extra year in special cases.
Liberal tax allowances are helpful in making capital improvements. The

equipment pays for itself in savings in bruising and operation,

To turn to the third objection made by the packers, they have sought
to assert that it is all very well for European packers to kill animals
humanely, but American animals are so ”fractious" and wild that American
packers can't be humanei Such a point of View shows a total lack of
sympathy for American packing house workersi, The more fractious and
wild the animal, the more essential it is that it be anesthetized or stunned
before slaughter, The accident rate for the packing industry is almost
double that for all industrial activity combined, and it is rising. Why

should any human being be compelled to earn his living in the midst of

bloodncurdling screams, splashed with blood, and in constant danger of

 




 
 

 

severe bites, kicks, deep knife wounds when the knife is deflected by a

 

struggling animal, or being crushed when a heavy animal falls on him?
None of this is necessary. It will be stepped if compulsory humane slaughter

legislation is enacted.

The fourth objection put forward by the packers is based on the high
speed of Operationa Anyone who has seen the high speed anesthetization .
and slaughter of hogs at the Hormel plants or at Kingan and Company, or
the stunning of cattle with a captive bolt pistol at the Oscar Mayer Company,
knows this objection is unfounded, Any desired rate of speed can be
achieved with anesthetization or stunning, The animals come out of C02
machines at any rate from 60 to 600 per hour and a rate of 1200 per hour
can be obtained by running two parallel tunnelsn As for cattle, the attempts
to stun them with a hammer, which so often require blow after blow to
bring the animals down, are certainly no more rapid than accurate stunning
with a mechanical instrumenti The number of cattle killed per hour on any
killing floor depends upon the number of beds in use, not upon whether a

hammer or a humane stunner is used on the animals,

The packers" fifth and last argument is directed against carbon
dioxide, on the peculiar contention that it is no more humane to put an
animal to sleep with this gas so that he will be unconscious when his throat
is out than it is to drag him up screaming by a chain around his hind leg,

letting him struggle and writhe till he sometimes breaks his own pelvis as

 

he is sent over the great wheel to the sticker who thrusts a knife into his
throat and leaves him to bleed to death, This contention is as fantastic as
it sounds, but so assiduous are the representatives of the packers in

claiming that C02 suffocates rather than anesthetizes animals that it is

-8-

  




essential that this Committee have conclusive scientific evidence on this

subject. Following are excerpts from the article ”Stunning Pigs with

Carbon Dioxide” by Dra S. Ma Blomquist of the Danish Meat Research

Institute; it appeared in Danish in "Slagteriernes Forskningsinstitut”
December 15, 1956 and is scheduled to appear in the English journal
"Food Manufacture“ this spring. Dru Blomquist writes, "The narcotic
effect of C02 was demonstrated by Henry Hall Hickman as early as 1827
(Poulsen, 1952). . . .It is known (Meduna, 1950) that an isolated nerve in a
high C02 tension milieu demands greater irritation to react, that is, to
send out impulses, In addition, it is known that the speed of the impulse
along the nerve is reduced; C02 also has the effect of making the transfer
of impulses from one nerve cell to another more difficult because the
connections between the nerve cells (synapses) are partly blocked by the
high C02 concentrationi These conditions make C02 an effective
anesthetic, . , ,3 The reaction of pigs to C02 stunning was investigated during
an experiment carried out by the Danish Meat Research Institute, 70%
C02 in ordinary air was used, The pigs moved around. rather freely
during the experiment and a person with a supply of fresh air followed the
animals during the eXperiment, During the first 15 seconds the animals
were apparently unaffected by the stunning gast They went around calmly
sniffing manure from other pigs and showed no sign of cramps in the
pharynx, larynx or bronchi,» , Nor did they seem to have smarting in the
mucous membranes» 15 seconds after the pigs were let into the stunning
chamber there appeared a state of excitement where they bent their head
backwards and fell over on their side. It was impossible at that point to
make any investigation of the corneal reflex (blink reflex when the cornea

is touched) but 5 seconds after the beginning of the reaction the sense of

-9-

 




pain seemed to have been lost, or at any rate greatly reduced, since the
pigs did not react when their hooves were stepped on with wooden shoes.
At this point all eye movements had ceased. The pigs did not follow a
hand drawn before their head. The skin was still sensitive to a slight
touch. 15 seconds after the beginning of the fit, the corneal reflex
disappeared.» The time periods mentioned were approximately the same

for five experimental animals“

”From the knowledge of the cause of narcoses in general (Moller,
1952.) it can be concluded that the pigs rather suddenly lose consciousness
about 15 seconds after they are put into the C02 atmospherei A few
seconds later there is no longer any sense of pain and after a few seconds
more the animal is generally anesthetized, that is, feeling of pain,
consciousness and voluntary and involuntary muscular movements
disappear, without essentially affecting circulation or any other vital

function, . i . .

”The animals wake up calmly during the course of 1-1/2. to 2.
minutes if they are allowed to lie; 10 to 15 minutes later they have

completely recover ed, "

It is while they are under general anesthesia that the animals are

slaughtered. Thus they are unconscious and feel no pain.

Poultry, too, can be anesthetized using C02. A humane stunning

method. in wide use for poultry is the electric knife’i‘ which is touched ate
the birds‘ heads before being used to cut their throats. The electric
current passing through their brains renders them unconscious. Poultry
can also be humanely killed by stunning with a sharp blow on the back of

the head before bleeding or by cutting the head off at one stroke.»

To sum up, several humane slaughtering methods for livestock
and poultry are easily available to all who wish to use them. Two of the
stunning instruments, the captive bolt pistol and the Schermer stunner,
have been used for decades in different parts of the world to stun animals
before slaughter. Three hundred million animals of all types have been
successfully stunned with the captive bolt pistol, according to its English
manufacturers, a substantial number of these in the United State 3. Those
packers who prefer the Remington stunner, which does not penetrate the
brain, are at liberty to purchase it instead of the British or German
stunners, but this is simply a matter of individual preference, Carbon
dioxide anesthetization is now available at prices suitable to different

sizes of plantss

All that remains is to apply humane methods to the animals. It
would be a deep and terrible shame if our country should fail to act

honorably on this moral is sue.

In every country which now has humane slaughter, the packers
fought against compulsory legislation just as American packers are doing.
American packers fought compulsory Federal Meat Inspection in 1905 and
1906, just as they are fighting compulsory humane slaughter legislation
today On these matters the packers are wrong. It is essential that
civilized countries should have sanitary meat and that it should be killed .
without cruelty0 The only way to obtain such objectives is by compulsory
legislation based on the sound principles common to the bills introduced by

Representatives Griffiths, Hiestand, Miller, Dawson and McMillan, I call

 

your attention in particular to the extremely well-drawn bills H. R. 3029

and H.R. 5671.. I urge you, for the good of our nation as a whole, to

  

recommend the immediate enactment of these bills.

Respectfully submitted,
