and Norwegian Products.

The great whales are the highest form of life in the sea and
have the largest and most complex brains of any creature that
ever lived on Earth. They are highly intelligent and communicate
with each other across miles of sea, often with beautiful musical
sounds

Someday we could communicate with whales and learn
something important from these masters of the sea. But these ex-
traordinary animals may disappear soon, driven to extinction by
ruthless whalers.

If the great whales are to be saved, public pressure must be
brought against Japan, the Soviet Union, Norway and a handful
of other nations that are hunting down the last of the whales with
their grenade-tipped harpoons.

Every 20 minutes, another whale dies, its back blown open by
the explosion of shrapnel from a 1501b. harpoon. Often many
harpoons are fired to kill a mother whale. It is probably the cruel-
lest and most inhumane slaughter in the world. Death is pro-
longed and agonizing as the mighty creature’s blood turns the
seared.

We need your help. Join the boycott against the major whal—
ing nations—Japan, the Soviet Union and Norway. Take a moral
stand for the whales and against the nations that would allow the
extermination of the great whales.

NO NEED FOR WHALE PRODUCTS

Why are the whales being killed? To make mink food, fertilizer
margarine, cosmetics and lubricating oil. There are cheap, plenti-
ful alternative sources for all these whale products. But the
slaughter goes on relentlessly.

Japan once had seven fleets—each fleet consisting of a huge
factory ship and ten catcher boats—and 10,000 workers hunting
down the whales. Today, just one fleet and 800 workers remain,
because the whales have been virtually wiped out. And those
whalers only continue the massacre with a $10 million annual
subsidy from the Japanese government (more than $12,000 per
worker!). The giant Taiyo Fishery Co. recently reported a $20
million loss on its whaling operation. The Russians have been
forced to make similar cutbacks. The last of the whales are dying
to provide employment to a few hundred whalers for a few more
years.

,

ECONOMICS OF EXTINCTION

The economics of whaling are the economics of extinction. It is
more profitable to kill every whale as fast as possible, take the
profits, and invest them elsewhere. The Japanese, Russians and
Norwegians have financed much of their huge shipping fleets
from the flesh and oil of millions of whales.

In one year alone, more than 30,000 blue whales died by the
whalers’ harpoons. The Japanese whalers’ greed for the largest
creature ever to inhabit Earth only stopped‘when their seven
fleets could not find a single blue whale to kill. The blue
whale now exists in such few numbers scattered across the seven
seas that scientists fear it may be past the point of saving.

When the blue whale was gone, the whalers systematically
wiped out the humpback and right whales. They are termed
“commercially extinct”, which means one step from oblivion.
The fin and sei whales were overexploited next. Until a few years
ago, the minke whale, the smallest of the ten species of great
whales, was considered too small for hunting. But now the whal-
ers are chasing down more than 10,000 minke whales each year.

The mighty sperm whale, romanticized in Moby Dick, is still be-
ing decimated for its oil. Sperm whale populations are crashing
because the whalers have used highly questionable data to keep
whale quotas high. Scientific evidence points overwhelmingly
toward eventual extinction for the whales if the slaughter
continues.

The whalers have defiantly rejected the warnings of the scien-
tists and the appeals of conservationists and the world com-
munity. In 1972, the United Nations Conference on the Human
Environment in Stockholm called unanimously (53 to 0) for a
ten-year moratorium on all commercial whaling. The whaling
nations ignored it.

When Panama proposed the moratorium at the International
Whaling Commission in June, 1978, Japan resorted to econom-
ic blackmail to force Panama to withdraw the proposal. As TIME

AGONIZING DEATH

Modern whaling is a savage, ruthless exercise, nothing
like the romantic days of 19th-century whaling. Here is an
eyewitness description of modern whaling by Dr. Harry
Lillie, who sailed as a ship’s sur eon: “The present-day
hunting harpoon is a horrible I 0-pound weapon carrying
an explosive head which bursts generally in the whales
intestines, and the sight of one of those creatures pouring
blood and gasping along on the surface, towing a 400-ton
catching vessel by a heavy harpoon rope, is pitiful. So often
an hour or more of torture is inflicted before the agony ends
in death. I have experienced a case of five hours and nine
har oons needed to kill one mother Blue Whale.

“l‘fwe could imagine a horse having two or three explosive
spears driven into it, and then made to drag a heavy butcher’s
truck, while blood poured over the roadway until the animal
collapsed an hour or more later, we should have some idea
of what a whale goes throughi’

 

 

 

 

 

 

Magazine reported: “According to a diplomatic source, the
Japanese had earlier threatened to cancel a sugar deal worth
$975 million to the Panamanians if the ban was pressed home.”

HIGH INTELLIGENCE

It would be a monumental tragedy if the whales, which have
evolved over hundreds of millions of years, are exterminated.
“We are dealing with special creatures with remarkably devel—
oped brains,” says American biologist Dr. Peter Morgane. “Their
kinship with man at the level of neurological development holds
us in awe and fascination.”

Dr. Hans Gruenberger of the Brain Anatomy Institute in Swit-
zerland observes: “Many toothed whales have reached such a
degree of central nervous system differentiation that, cerebrally,
they are on a par with higher primates and human beings.”

Jacques Cousteau, the famed French oceanographer, states:
“The only creatures on Earth that have bigger——and maybe
better—brains than humans are the Cetacea, the whales and
dolphins. Perhaps they could one day tell us something impor-
tant, but it is unlikely that we will hear it. Because we are coldly,
efficiently and economically killing them off.”

The director of the Cetacean Research Laboratory in the
Soviet Union, Dr. Alfred Berzin, comments: “The sperm whale
brain structure is such that this can be said to be a ‘thinking’
animal capable of displaying high ‘intellectual’ abilities.”

OUTLAW WHALERS

Japan and Norway have flagrantly subverted even the meager
regulations of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) by
supporting whaling operations in nations that have refused to
join the IWC and abide by whale quotas.

In Peru, for example, Japan’s Taiyo Fishery Co. set up a whal-
ing station in 1970 that has killed more than 2,000 whales annu—
ally, including such “protected” species as the rare blue and
humpback whales, outside any regulation. When Peru bowed to
international pressure and joined the IWC in 1979, Taiyo Fishery
Co. persuaded Peru to defy the quotas set by the IWC and con-
tinue the outlaw whaling.

The leading Peruvian newsmagazine, Caretas, commented
angrily in 1978: “In relation to whales, the Japanese have the
fame of Attila the Hun, and granting them an exclusive license to
hunt whales in our seas in 1970 was a bit like making Dracula a
nursemaid.”

Taiyo, the world’s largest fishing company (it sells tens of
millions of dollars worth of tuna to US. canners), has supported
outlaw whaling in Chile for two decades. Seeking to expand the

operation in 1977, Taiyo exported a modern stern trawler, the
Orient Maru No. 2, from Japan. A document filed by Taiyo with
the Japanese government stated: “The purpose of such procure-
ment is its use for shrimp trawling off the coasts of Panama.”

The ship, renamed the Paulmy Star No. 3, was indeed regis-
tered in Panama as a “camaronero,” a shrimp boat. But it never
got within 3,000 miles of Panama. Instead, it showed up in Chile
with a harpoon gun on its bow and began hunting down 500
whales annually of any size or species. Said one Chilean conser-
vationist bitterly: “A harpoon gun is not famous as a productive
weapon against shrimp.”

Another outlaw whaling ship began operating out of Taiwan in
1976. It is the Sea Bird, formerly the Paulmy Star. Owned by
secretive Japanese interests and manned by Japanese, this com-
bination factory/catcher ship has hunted down thousands of
whales, including mother and babyhumpback whales. The meat
has been shipped to Japan as “Product of South Korea.” Three
more whaling ships have reportedly joined the Sea Bird opera-
tion.

Taiyo Fishery Co. has supported two whaling stations in Spain
by supplying harpooners and butcherers and by importing
thousands of tons of whale meat annually to Japan. When inter-
national pressure forced Spain to join the IWC in 1979, Taiyo
influenced Spain to file a formal objection to the quotas set by
the IWC. Spain has announced it will continue its unregulated
whaling.

In 1977, 1978 and 1979 the IWC passed resolutions con-
demning the outlaw whaling operations and calling on all
member nations (meaning Japan) to halt the importation of
whale products from the outlaws. The Japanese government
pledged to phase out the imports through 1978. But in fact Taiyo
Fishery Co. increased Japan’s import of illicit whale meat in
1978 by 50% over the 1977 level. Then in 1979, the Japanese
government announced that all non-IWC imports would stop on
July 5th. But that didn’t happen, either. Japan’s whaling
commissioner Kunio Yonezawa, said that. “We must make
allowances for contracts,” which means that Taiyo can claim
long-term contracts for the outlaw whale meat.

Thousands of tons of illicit whale meat have poured into
Japan since the July 5th, 1979, “cutoff.” The outlaw whaling
ships continue to scour the seas, killing every whale found and
shippping the whale meat back to Japan. Japan is the only
market for whale meat; if the Japanese government would stop
subverting the IWC and halt the imports, the outlaws would be
forced to silence their deadly harpoon guns.

THE SIERRA PIRATE WHALERS

The most flagrant outlaw whaling operation has been the in-
famous pirate ship Sierra. Since 1968, this factory/catcher ship
has roamed the Atlantic, wiping out thousands of endangered
whales, particularly blue, humpback and right whales. A favorite
tactic of the Sierra gang has been to harpoon a baby whale, then
blast the mother when she comes to its aid. Whaling in areas
totally off limits under IWC regulations, the Sierra has extermi-
nated many coastal populations of whales.

Who owns the Sierra? Dummy companies in Liechtenstein
and Cyprus shield their names, but sources in Europe and Japan
confirm that the pirate operation is owned by Japanese and
Norwegian interests. The captain and harpooner are Norwe—
gians. There are four to six Japanese “production inspectors” on
board at all times to oversee the carving up of the whale meat for
export to Japan. All are former employees of the Taiyo FisherSI
Co. In June 1973, the Norwegian manager of the Sierra opera-
tion drew up a contract to sell all the whale meat from the Sierra
to Taiyo Canada Ltd., a subsidiary of Japan’s Taiyo Fishery C0-

 




In 1976, a Taiyo official set up a dummy company in the
Bahamas, C.D. Jaxon Ltd., to import the Sierra’s whale meat in-
to Japan.

In 1979, insurance documents on the Sierra revealed that the
ship was partly owned by a major Norwegian bank, Forretnings-
banken, and a large Norwegian insurance company, Nord og
Sud.

The governments of Japan and Norway have refused to
acknowledge the direct roles of their citizens and corporations
in the Sierra operation. Indeed, there is evidence of Japanese
government complicity in the outlaw whaling activities. Interna-
tional public opinion should demand that full investigations of
the outlaw whaling be made by Japan and Norway.

On July 16, 1979, the conservationist ship Sea Shepherd
caught up with the Sierra off the coast of Portugal as the pirate
whaler, flying the flag of Cyprus, was taking a full load of whale
meat into port. The Sea Shepherd rammed the Sierra outside
the harbor of Oporto and knocked a big hole in its side. Although
the Sierra was put out of action for several months, its owners
made repairs and were set to resume whaling at the end of 1979.

The massive profits from the pirate whaling emboldened the
Sierra gang to expand in 1978. A surplus Japanese stern trawler,
the Shunyo Maru, had a harpoon gun mounted on its bow and
became the factory/catcher ship Tonna, joining the Sierra off
North Africa. Together, they began wiping out more than 100
whales each month.

WHALE SINKS WHALING SHIP

The whalers were too greedy, however, and in July, 1978, the
Tonna sank. It was sunk by a whale!

The last, fateful voyage of the pirate whaler began in May.
While the Sierra was docked in the Canary Islands for repairs,
the Tonna sailed north. For several weeks it combed the seas off
Europe, harpooning 38 fin whales.

By July 22nd, the Tonna’s freezer compartments were
jammed with 450 tons of whale meat. The ship rode low in the
water as it headed south toward the Canary Islands. The captain,
a 52-year-old Norwegian named Kristof Vesterheim, pushed
the Tonna’s engine to full speed to chase down one more
whale. This time, he picked an enormous, 66-foot fin whale.
After the grenade-tipped harpoons did their deadly business, the
Tonna halted alongside the carcass to haul it aboard.

It was shortly after 5 pm. and the sea was relatively calm 220
miles off the Portuguese coast as the 80-ton dead whale, its
blood-spattered body glistening in the lowering sun, was slowly
winched up the stern slipway.

Suddenly, when the great marine mammal was only partly on
deck, it rolled over against the port rail, heeling over the Tonna
until the scuppers were awash.

The converted fishing vessel was not constructed to handle
such a huge weight on its deck. With little ballast in its shallow
keel, the Tonna was unable to right itself. In a scene of supreme
irony, the Tonna wallowed helplessly like a harpooned whale.

Unfortunately for the whalers and fortunately for the whales,
several hatches and portholes into the engine room were open at
the rear of the Tonna. The sea poured in. The electrical control
Panel shorted out and caught fire, sending smoke billowing
through the ship and shutting down all electrical circuits. The
electric winches on deck jammed; the crew was unable to release
the whale carcass that was dragging the Tonna over.

Captain Vesterheim ordered the crew to quickly cut up the
Whale with long flensing knives. But Mother Nature interceded.
AtroDical squall suddenly blew up, sending lashing rain and
surging swells against the crippled Tonna. As the crew hacked at
the whale in a frenzy, the raging sea consumed the whaling ship.

At 7:40 p.m., the Tonna’s battery-operated emergency radio
sent out a Mayday distress signal. The crew of 42, made up of 28
South Africans, 3 Japanese supervisors and an assortment of
Spaniards, Portuguese and a New Zealander, scrambled into
three liferafts.

At 8:21 pm. on the evening of July 22nd, the Tonna slipped
under the waves. Six hours later, a passing Greek freighter, the
Gomasa, rescued the 42 crewmen, who were unharmed.

When the rescued whalers were dropped off at the port of
Funchal in Madeira, the crewmen stated that they had been
whaling “for the Japanese.”

The Sierra gang received a huge insurance settlement from
the Tonna. With that money, another Japanese stern trawler, the
Yashima Maru, was converted into a whaling ship. It joined the
Sierra in mid-1979 as the Cape Fisher and has been whaling
since then in the North Atlantic. Two other pirate whaling ships
were converted in South Africa in 1979. They are the Susan and
the Theresa. Each had $1 million worth of freezing and refrigera-
tion equipment installed below deck. The manufacturer of the
equipment was Taiyo Electrical Engineering Co. of Japan, a sub-
sidiary of Taiyo Fishery Co. The South African government,
alarmed at the activities of the pirate whalers, refused to allow
the Susan and the Theresa to leave port.

YOU CAN
HELP
SAVE THE
WHALES

Boycott Japanese, Russian and Norwegian Products
such as cars, TV’s, stereos, cameras, vodka, fish and skis.

Join the international conservation community in the boycott of the products of the major whaling countries: Japan, the Soviet
Union and Norway. Hit them in the pocketbook, the only place they seem to have any feeling. They will stop the killing if they find
it costs them more than they get from the meat and oil of the whales.

If a product says MADE IN JAPAN, MADE IN U.S.S.R. or MADE IN NORWAY, don’t buy it. Tell merchants why you are boy—
cotting those products and urge them to stock goods made elsewhere.

Tell your friends about the plight of the whales and how they can help. The more people who act NOW, the sooner we can halt
the slaughter. Remember: Extinction is the ultimate crime.

Please write to the leaders of Japan, the Soviet Union and Norway and urge them to end commercial whaling by their countries.

The Japanese whalers make the market for most whale products. These whalers are owned and controlled by the giant manufacturing and
trading companies that produce and sell the vast array of Japanese goods. Write to the presidents of these Japanese companies telling them why
you are boycotting their products. Write Russian companies urging them to demand an end to Soviet whaling.

Sperm whales, male and female.

Unfortunately, they are being ruthlessly massacred to make mink food, fertilizer, marg

arine, cosmetics, whale steaks
and lubricating oil. The great whales face extinction unless an international outcry forces a greedy handful of whaling
nations to stop. Please help.

 

SCIENTISTS SPEAK OUT:

“

. . . cetaceans are large brained, sociable, communicating and sensitive mammals with a broad range of emotions, and

great differences between individuals of a species and even in their small groups, with long memories and strong tendencies

to parental care and other formsof mutual aid. This means, I believe, that the present species are likely over a far longer
w-period- than—human» history, to have deveIOped a mental—culture which we are almost certainly destroying just as surely as—col- . --

onizers of the new world destroyed local human cultures, even if they did not make the indigenous populations extinct.”—
Sidney Holt, Ph.D., University of California, Santa Cruz.
“In destroying our neurological relatives we are perpetrating genocide and will lose the knowledge of another entire

world. What a price to pay for limited, local, nationalistic profit and outright greed!”—Peter J. Morgane, Ph. D., Worcester
Foundation for Experimental Biology, Shrewsbury, Massachusetts.

HIGH INTELLIGENCE

It would be a monumental tragedy if the whales, which have
evolved over hundreds of millions of years, should become
extinct at the hands of man. “. . . there is strong justification for
considering the brain of cetaceans capable of carrying out many
of the same highly complex mental functions as the human
brain,” says American pathologist Dr. Myron Jacobs. Dr. Hans
Gruenberger of the Brain Anatomy Institute in Switzerland
observes: “Many toothed whales have reached such a degree of
central nervous system differentiation that, cerebrally, they are
on a par with higher primates and human beings.”

Jacques Cousteau, the famed oceanographer, states: “The
only creatures on Earth that have bigger—and maybe better—
brains than humans are the Cetacea, the whales and dolphins.
Perhaps they could one day tell us something important, but it is
unlikely that we will hear it. Because we are coldly, efficiently and
economically killing them off.” The director of the Cetacean
Research Laboratory in the Soviet Union, Dr. Alfred Berzin,
comments: “The sperm whale brain structure is such that this can
be said to be a ‘thinking’ animal capable of displaying high
‘intellectual’ abilities.”

Sir Peter Scott, the great naturalist, passionately condemns the
whale-killers: “In light of our present knowledge of these magnifi-
cent mammals, no civilized person can contemplate whaling
without revulsion and shame at the insensitivity of our own
species. Whaling is an affront to human dignity, a debasement of
human values and sensibility.”

The great whales are the highest form of life in the sea and
have the largest and most complex brains of any creature that
ever lived on Earth. They are highly intelligent and communicate
with each other across miles of sea, often with beautiful musical
sounds.

Some day we could communicate with whales and learn
something important from these masters of the sea. But these
extraordinary animals may disappear soon, driven to extinction
by ruthless whalers.

If the great whales are to be saved, public pressure must be
brought against Japan, the Soviet Union, Norway and a handful
of other nations that are hunting down the last of the whales with
their grenade-tipped harpoons.

Every 35 minutes, another whale dies, its back blown open by
a 150-lb. harpoon. Often many harpoons are fired to kill a
mother whale. It is probably the cruellest and most inhumane
slaughter in the world. Death is prolonged and agonizing as the

mighty creature’s blood turns the sea red.
' We need your help. Join the boycott against the major whal-
ing nations—Japan, the Soviet Union and Norway. Take a moral
stand for the whales and against the nations that would allow the
extermination of the great whales.

NO NEED FOR WHALE PRODUCTS

Why are the whales being killed? There are cheap, plentiful al-
ternative sources for all whale products. But the slaughter goes
on relentlessly.

Japan once had seven fleets—each fleet consisting of a huge
factory ship and ten catcher boats—and 10,000 workers hunting
down the whales. Today, just one fleet and 400 workers remain,
because the whales have been virtually wiped out. And those
whalers only continue the massacre with a huge subsidy from the
Japanese government. The Russians have been forced to make
similar cutbacks. The last of the whales are dying to provide
employment to a few hundred whalers for a few more years.

ECONOMICS OF EXTINCTION

The economics of whaling are the economics of extinction. It is
more profitable to kill every whale as fast as possible, take the

profits, and invest them elsewhere. The Japanese, Russians and
Norwegians have financed much of their huge shipping fleets
from the flesh and oil of millions of whales.

In one year alone, more than 30,000 blue whales died by the
whalers’ harpoons. The Japanese whalers’ greed for the largest
creature ever to inhabit Earth only stopped when their seven
fleets could not find a single blue whale to kill. The blue
whale now exists in such few numbers scattered across the seven
seas that scientists fear it may be past the point of saving.

When the blue whale was gone, the whalers systematically
wiped out the humpback and right whales. They are termed
“commercially extinct, ” which means one step from oblivion.
The fin and sei whales were overexploited next. Until a few years
ago, the minke whale, the smallest of the ten species of great
whales, was considered too small for hunting. But now the whal-
ers are chasing down more than 10,000 minke whales each year.

The mighty sperm whale, romanticized in Moby Dick, is still be-
ing decimated for its oil. Sperm whale populations are crashing
because the whalers have used highly questionable data to keep
whale quotas high. Scientific evidence points overwhelmingly
toward eventual extinction for the whales if the slaughter
conﬁnues

The whalers have defiantly rejected the warnings of the scien-
tists and the appeals of conservationists and the world com-
munity. In 1972, the United Nations Conference on the Human
Environment in Stockholm called unanimously (53 to 0) for a
ten-year moratorium on all commercial whaling. The whaling
nations ignored it.

When Panama proposed the moratorium at the International
Whaling Commission in June, 1978, Japan resorted to econom-
ic blackmail to force Panama to withdraw the proposal. As TIME
Magazine reported: “According to a diplomatic source, the
Japanese had earlier threatened to cancel a sugar deal worth
$9.75 million to the Panamanians if the ban was pressed home.”

OUTLAW WHALERS

Japan and Norway flagrantly subverted even the meager
regulations of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) by
supporting whaling operations in nations that have refused to
join the IWC and abide by whale quotas.

In Peru, for example, Japan’s Taiyo Fishery Co. set up a whal-
ing station in 1970 that has killed as many as 2,000 whales
annually, including such “protected” species as the rare blue and
humpback whales, outside any regulation. When Peru bowed to
international pressure and joined the IWC in 1979, Taiyo Fishery
Co. persuaded Peru to defy the quotas set by the IWC and con-
tinue the outlaw whaling.

The leading Peruvian newsmagazine, Caretas, commented
angrily in 1978: “In relation to whales, the Japanese have the
fame of Attila the Hun, and granting them an exclusive license to
hunt whales in our seas in 1970 was a bit like making Dracula a
nursemaid.”

Taiyo, the world’s largest fishing company (it sells tens of
millions of dollars worth of tuna to US. canners), has supported
outlaw whaling in Chile for two decades. Seeking to expand the
operation in 1977, Taiyo exported a modern stern trawler, the
Orient Maru No. 2, from Japan. A document filed by Taiyo with
the Japanese government stated: “The purpose of such procure-
ment is its use for shrimp trawling off the coasts of Panama.”

The ship, renamed the Paulmy Star No. 3, was indeed regis-
tered in Panama as a “camaronero,” a shrimp boat. But it never
got within 3,000 miles of Panama. Instead, it showed up in Chile
with a harpoon gun on its bow and began hunting down 500

whales annually of any size or species. Said one Chilean conser-
vationist bitterly: “A harpoon gun is not famous as a productive
weapon against shrimp.”

 




Taiyo Fishery Co. set up yet another outlaw whaling operation
in Taiwan in 1976 with the factory/ catcher ship Sea Bird, a
former stern trawler built by Taiyo’s Hayashikane Shipbuilding
Co. Three more of these converted Japanese ships were added
in 1977 and 1978, the Sea Flower, the Chi Hsin and the Chu
Feng. Operating out of the Taiwanese port of Kaohsiung, they
roamed the Western Pacific hunting down Brydes whales and
the rare humpback whales. A favorite hunting ground was
Japan’s Bonin Islands. There are reports the Taiwan outlaws
penetrated the Indian Ocean.

The Taiwan whalers were highly secretive. Thousands of tons
of frozen whale meat have been exported from Taiwan to South
Korea, where the 10-kilo packages were labelled “Product of
South Korea” and shipped on to Japan. The Japanese govern—
ment covered up the scandal until it was exposed by American
conservationists.

Taiyo Fishery Co. has supported two whaling stations in Spain
by supplying harpooners and butcherers and by importing
thousands of tons of whale meat annually to Japan. When inter-
national pressure forced Spain to join the International Whaling
Commission in 1979, Taiyo influenced Spain to file a formal ob-
jection to the quotas set by the IWC. The Spanish whalers, who
use the exceedingly cruel “cold” harpoon, killed 432 fin whales
when their IWC quota was 225.

PIRATE SHIP

The infamous pirate whaling ship Sierra roamed the Atlantic
for a dozen years. Owned by Japanese and Norwegian interests
through secret, dummy companies in Liechtenstein and Cyprus,
and flying various flags of convenience, the Sierra and several
sister ships decimated entire whale populations. Only the best
cuts of meat were taken and shipped to Japan aboard Taiyo
Fishery Co. freighters. The ships were captained by Norwegians.
Japanese oversaw the butchering. The Sierra was rammed and

put out of action by the conservationist ship Sea Shepherd in
1979. After extensive repairs, the Sierra was preparing to resume
whaling in 1980 when it mysteriously blew up and sank in Lis-
bon harbor. Portuguese authorities report a magnetic mine had
been attached to the Sierra’s hull.

SOVIET UNION

The vast Soviet fleets have massacred tens of thousands of
sperm whales for oil to lubricate their nuclear missiles. They even
kill 170 California gray whales annually, claiming they are for
feeding Siberian Eskimos. In reality, nearly all the gray whales
are fed to mink and sable, which are then exported to the West
for hard currency. In 1979, a Russian fleet harpooned 201 sperm
whales in the North Pacific in violation of an IWC ban on such
whaling. The Russians outraged the world scientific and conser-
vation communities even more in 1980 with the harpooning,
outside IWC regulation, of 906 orcas in the Antarctic.

NORWAY

More than 1,500 whales are hunted down each year
along the coast of Norway. The Norwegian whalers use a “cold”
harpoon, which is even more inhumane than the explosive har-
poon because it causes agonizing death lasting sometimes more
than an hour. Such killing is totally incompatible with Norway’s
anti-cruelty laws.

Whaling is a barbaric anachronism for Norway, an oil-rich na-
tion. Neighboring Sweden joined the IWC to strongly oppose
commercial whaling. The Norwegian government even pays a
bounty for the killing each year of dozens of orcas, the highly
intelligent and playful “killer” whales that enthrall audiences at
aquariums worldwide. Even more scandalous is the Norwegian
government’s ownership of the factory (Kongsberg Vapen-

fabrikk) that makes and sells the deadly harpoons and harpoon
guns. And the government has failed to conduct an open inves-
tigation of the involvement of its citizens and corporations in the
Sierra pirate operation.

AGONIZING DEATH

Modern whaling is a savage, ruthless exercise, nothing like the
romantic days of 19th-century whaling. Here is an eyewitness
description of modern whaling by Dr. Harry Lillie, who sailed as
a ship’s surgeon: “The present-day hunting harpoon is a horrible
ISO-pound weapon carrying an explosive head which bursts
generally in the whale’s intestines, and the sight of one of those
creatures pouring blood and gasping along on the surface, tow-
ing a 400-ton catching vessel by a heavy harpoon rope, is pitiful.
So often an hour or more of torture is inflicted before the agony
ends in death. I have experienced a case of five hours and nine

“If we could imagine a horse having two or three explosive

AN INTERNATIONAL VOTE FOR WHALES

The nations that have ratified the Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species met at New Delhi, India from
February 25th to March 8th, 1981. In a heartening, even blaz-
ing, display of almost total unanimity, delegates from 39
nations voted to place the fin, sei and sperm whales on Appen-
dix I of the Convention, formally designating them as endan-
gered. Thus, no legal international trade can now be carried out
in products from these species by member nations unless they
take formal reservations to the treaty. Predictably, the two merci-
less whaling nations, Japan and Russia, voted against the pro—
posal, and can be expected to take reservations. However, the
message is clear. Virtually the entire world seeks protection for
the imperiled whales. The 37—2 vote is a clear portent.

Boycott Japanese, Russian and Norwegian Products . . .
such as cars, TV’s, stereos, cameras, vodka, fish, skis, and furs.

Join the international conservation community in the boycott of the products of the major whaling countries: Japan, the Soviet Union and
Norway. Hit them in the pocketbook, the only place they seem to have any feeling. They will stop the killing if they find it costs them more than
they get from the meat and Oil of the whales.

If a product says MADE IN JAPAN, MADE IN U.S.S.R. or MADE IN NORWAY, don’t buy it. Tell merchants why you are boycotting those
products and urge them to stock goods made elsewhere.

Tell your friends about the‘plight Of the whales and how they can help. The more people who act NOW, the sooner we can halt the slaughter.
Remember: Extinction is the ultimate crime.

Please write to the leaders Of Japan, the Soviet Union and Norway and urge them to end commercial whaling by their countries. Their names

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2 May 1979

 

UNITED STATES CALLS FOR WHALING MORATORIUM;
MOVIE STARS JOIN SAVE-THE-WHALES CAMPAIGN

 

 

WASHINGTON —— The United States Government today called for
the International Whaling Commission to adopt a moratorium on
all commercial whaling, reports the Animal Welfare Institute,
the leading American conservation organization in the save-the—
whales campaign.

If the moratorium is adopted at the annual meeting of the
International Whaling Commission (IWC) in July, Japan and
several other maritime nations will be forced to halt all
whale-killing. Japan is a member of the IWC along with the
U.S. and 17 other nations. The U.S. placed the moratorium
issue on the IWC agenda today.

Meanwhile, four famous American stars of screen and stage
joined the save-the-whales campaign by making taped radio
appeals that are being heard across the United States.

Gregory Peck, Katharine Hepburn, Jason Robards and Jack Lord
have made public service appeals of 60, 30 and 10 seconds that
have been sent to more than 4,000 radio stations around the
United States, Canada and overseas.

”Let's harpoon the whaling industry and save the whales,”
says Lord, who stars in the popular ”Hawaii Five-O” television
Show. ”Russian, Japanese and Norwegian whalers are bent on
extracting the last yen and ruble from the great whales. These
countries insist that they abide by the quotas of the International
Whaling Commission, but Japan and Norway fail to mention that
they support unregulated whaling operations outside the commission
that kill more than 5,000 whales each year.”

Gregory Peck, who played Capt. Ahab in the famous film of
"Moby Dick," states: "The real tragedy is that there are cheap,
plentiful substitutes for all whale products. Unfortunately,
there are no substitutes for whales.”

 




Jason Robards, the popular film and stage star, comments:
"The whaling industries of Japan and Russia are systematically
hunting these gentle giants of the sea to the brink of extinction."

Says Katharine Hepburn, one of the world's great actresses:
”The whale and his song are dying. Unless we stop this
unconscionable slaughter, the whale will disappear forever.”

The U.S. action calling for a whaling moratorium came at the
same time the U.S. Congress is considering action that could halt
all Japanese fishing within the U.S. ZOO-mire fishing limit. Sen.
Warren Magnuson, Democrat of Washington and chairman of the Senate
Appropriations Committee, and Sen. Robert Packwood, Republican of
Oregon, sponsored an amendment to the Fishery Conservation and
Management Act that would forbid the U.S. to issue any fishing
permits to nations that diminish the effectiveness of any
international fishery conservation agreement. The Packwood—
Magnuson amendment passed the Senate on Monday.

Japan's subversion of the whaling quotas of the IWC through its
support of outlaw whaling operations around the world could result

in U.S. sanctions against Japan, including a ban on fishing
within U.S. waters, under the Packwood-Magnuson amendment.

Japanese whaling interests own or support unregulated (non-IWC)
whaling operations in Taiwan, Peru, Chile, Spain and the pirate
whaling ship Sierra. More than 5,000 whales are taken by these
outlaw whalers each year, including many extremely endangered -—
and INC—protected -- species such as the blue, humpback and right
whales. The whale meat is shipped to Japan in violation of IWC
resolutions. Sen. Packwood met with Japan's Foreign Minister
Sonoda yesterday to discuss the moratorium and outlaw whaling issues.

SAYONARA WHALES

 
       

The fate‘of the great whales was foreseen more than a century ago by Herman Melville. The author of the whaling classic

' ff’Moby Dick” wrote: “The moot point is, whether Leviathan can long endure so wide a chase, and so remorseless a havoc; whether _

' [he 'must not at last be exterminated from the waters, and the last whale, like the last man, smoke his last pipe, and thenhimself

evaporate in the final puff.”
' ' Jacques Cousteau, the famed

French oceanographer, writes: “Our century, as it turned out,was much more destructive to the

'~ Whales than the period of the great romantic hunts as described in the work of Herman Melville. A hundred years ago, a whaler’s

three—year expedition netted him 37w

_. - “The only creatures on earth that have bigger—and maybe. better—brains than humans are the Cetacea, the whales and
dolphins. Perhaps they could one day tell us something important, but it is unlikely that we will hear it. Because we are coldly,

efficiently and economically killing them off.” 7
Modern whaling is a savage, ruthless exercise, n

othingv like the romantic days of 19th—century whaling. Here is an eyewitness

. description of modern whaling by Dr. Harry Lillie, who 'sailed as a ship’ssurgeon: “The present-day hunting harpoon is a horrible
150-pound weapon carrying an explosive head which bursts generally in the whale’s intestines, and the sight of one of these
creatures pouring blood and gasping along on the surface, towing a 400-ton catching vessel by a heavy harpoon rope, is pitiful. So
often an hour or more of. torture is inflicted before the agony ends in death. I have experienced a case of five hours and nine

harpoons needed to kill one mother Blue Whale.

‘ “If we could imiagineja horse having two or three explosive spears driven into it, and then made to drag a heavy butcher’s truck,
_ while blood poured over the roadway Until the animalcollapsed an hour or more later, we should have some idea of what a whale

goes through.”

ANIMAL WELFARE INSTITUTE

PO. Box 3650 Washington, DC. 20007

 

 

 

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2 May 1979

 

UNITED STATES CALLS FOR WHALING MORATORIUM;
MOVIE STARS JOIN SAVE-THE-WHALES CAMPAIGN

 

 

WASHINGTON —- The United States Government today called for
the International Whaling Commission to adopt a moratorium on
all commercial whaling, reports the Animal Welfare Institute,
the leading American conservation organization in the save—the—
Whales campaign.

If the moratorium is adopted at the annual meeting of the
International Whaling Commission (IWC) in July, Japan and
several other maritime nations will be forced to halt all
whale—killing. Japan is a member of the IWC along with the
U.S. and 17 other nations. The U.S. placed the moratorium
issue on the IWC agenda today.

Meanwhile, four famous American stars of screen and stage
joined the save-the—whales campaign by making taped radio
appeals that are being heard across the United States.

Gregory Peck, Katharine Hepburn, Jason Robards and Jack Lord
have made public service appeals of 60, 30 and 10 seconds that
have been sent to more than 4,000 radio stations around the
United States, Canada and overseas.

"Let's harpoon the whaling industry and save the whales,"
says Lord, who stars in the popular "Hawaii Five-O” television
Show. "Russian, Japanese and Norwegian whalers are bent on
extracting the last yen and ruble from the great whales. These
countries insist that they abide by the quotas of the International
Whaling Commission, but Japan and Norway fail to mention that
they support unregulated whaling operations outside the commission
that kill more than 5,000 whales each year."

Gregory Peck, who played Capt. Ahab in the famous film of
"Moby Dick,” states: "The real tragedy is that there are cheap,
plentiful substitutes for all whale products. Unfortunately,
there are no substitutes for whales.”

 




Jason Robards, the popular film and stage star, comments:
"The whaling industries of Japan and Russia are systematically
hunting these gentle giants of the sea to the brink of extinction.”

Says Katharine Hepburn, one of the world's great actresses:
"The whale and his song are dying. Unless we stop this
unconscionable slaughter, the whale will disappear forever.”

The U.S. action calling for a whaling moratorium came at the
same time the U.S. Congress is considering action that could halt
all Japanese fishing within the U.S. ZOO-mile fishing limit. Sen.
Warren Magnuson, Democrat of Washington and chairman of the Senate
Appropriations Committee, and Sen. Robert Packwood, Republican of
Oregon, sponsored an amendment to the Fishery Conservation and
Management Act that would forbid the U.S. to issue any fishing
permits to nations that diminish the effectiveness of any
international fishery conservation agreement. The Packwood-
Magnuson amendment passed the Senate on Monday.

Japan's subversion of the whaling quotas of the IWC through its
support of outlaw whaling operations around the world could result
in U.S. sanctions against Japan, including a ban on fishing
within U.S. waters, under the Packwood-Magnuson amendment.

Japanese whaling interests own or support unregulated (non—INC)
whaling operations in Taiwan, Peru, Chile, Spain and the pirate
whaling ship Sierra. More than 5,000 whales are taken by these
outlaw whalers each year, including many extremely endangered —-
and IWC-protected -- species such as the blue, humpback and right
whales. The whale meat is shipped to Japan in violation of IWC
resolutions. Sen. Packwood met with Japan's Foreign Minister
Sonoda yesterday to discuss the moratorium and outlaw whaling issues.

when IFII Sonar is deployed worldwide.

On March 15, at least 17 individuals of four species of whales and dolphins mass-stranded on Bahamian
beaches. Just the day before the Navy had tested active sonar devices nearby. Nine of these animals were
dead or dying. Two were bleeding from the eyes, suggesting “acute trauma” according to the National Marine
Fisheries Service.

The Navy denies a. connection between the tests and the deaths. But there has never before been a mass
stranding of such a wide variety of whales.
lFIl Sonar

At the same time, the Navy is preparing to deploy an even louder device called Low Frequency Active (LFA)
sonar on four ships worldwide. LFA sonar sends low frequency sounds as loud as 235—240 decibels into the
oceans in order to find quiet enemy submarines by reading the echo. These sounds travel hundreds of miles.

How powerful is IFII sonar?

2500 times more powerful than the Bahamas tests. The Navy claims these very loud sounds have negligible
effect on sea life, but a mass stranding of Cuvier’s beaked whales in Greece in 1996 has been solidly linked
to NATO tests of a LFA sonar device. Now, rare beaked whales are also dead in the Bahamas.

Will IFII sonar protect our ships and sailors?

Not one. Experts say that LFA sonar will jeopardize our own vessels by exposing their positions as surely as
enemy subs would be revealed to us. Millions of dollars have already been spent on the LFA sonar leap into
the dark. For what? It won't protect our ships. And just the testing of this and other sonar devices is already
killing whales.

Stop Funding th Sonar. Save the Whales.

THIS PLAYFUL GIANT wouldn’t be easy to house train, but Nacho
the .whale made history when he sought a friend and found it in
John Koehler, captain of a whale-watching ship out of San. Diego.

—Siar photo In Stereo Swan!

The 30-foot, 7-1011 gray whale used Koehler's dinghy as a toy and
allOwed himself to be potted and scratched. Naturalists are. baffled by
the behavior of the affable gray whale off the Mexican coast.

WHALE OF A FRIEND

An ocean giant and man play together in a historic happening

By GEORGE BRYANT
Star associate travel editor

SAN IGNACIO LAGOON Mexico — The first
frieIidly encounter between whale and human

ever recorded took place this week A

young, 30-foot seven ton gray whale dubbed
Nacho made history by seeking out the com-
panzfof man, using a rubber dinghy as a play-
{thing} and allowing himself to be patted and
scratched.

Never before in the saga of .ocean research,
natzuralists believe, has a wild whale deliber-
£1;er come seeking human companionship and
Whale experts are bafﬂed by his behavior.

He’ll grow to 45 feet

The young whale — who will grow to a
length of 45 to 50 feet and an estimated weight
of {it to 35 tons—appeared beside our whale-
watitiiing ship, Salado 85, late Monday after-
nennand stayed with us for the next 24 hours.

’ihe encounter took place in this lagoon on

the west coast of Mexico’s Baja California
Peninsula where thousands of gray w‘iales

spend the winter after swimming 5. 000 miles
from their summer range in the Arctic.

The Salado, berthed in San Diego, brings
pconle down here on six-day whale viewing ex-
peditions but no one aboard had ever seen any-
thing like this.

No-t only did Nacho long for company, he
was so persistent at one point that the ship had
to move to allow passengers to. go off in the
rubber dinghies to watch other whales.

Estimated to be 2 years old and to weigh
nearly as muchas two full grown elephants, he
played like a boisterous youngster, rolling and
splashing and diving, nudging and butting the
raft and obviously enjoying the human atten-
tion.

At frequent intervals he would suspend
himself in a vertical position and slide his giant.
head from the water to See what his audience
was doing and to be scratched and petted.

- At no time did he make- any aggressive

move. In fact, his every action was surprisingly

gentle, moving his gigantic bOdy only inches at
a time when being handled by humans.

He appeared beside the ship in the after.
noon while the three dinghies were away from

the ship and played about the hull for an hour,
once seizing the anchor rope in his mouth and
starting to tow it away.

Then the dinghies returned and he went off
to meet them.

He followed the rubber craft back to the
ship and then apparently enchanted by the tex-
ture of the rafts, began nuzzling and playing
around one that had been trailed from the
stern.

Bounced it on his nose

He pushed it and rubbed it, bounced it on.
his nose. lifted it on his back, dove beneath it
and generally acted like a mammoth pup with
a new toy.

Periodically he would slide his great head
from the sea to allow a jet of water from the
stern of the Salado to play on his face cr let the
ship’s 33 passengers stroke ii i s nose and
scratch his checks.

The evening performance went on until fl

Continued from page 1

pm. when the dinghies
were taken out of the water
in the hope everyone could
get some sleep. And it work-
ed. After making a couple
of circuits of the ship and
diving beneath it to make
sure his toy was gone, he
disappeared.

liut he couldn’t have gone
far, because at 5.55 am. he
was back looking for his
rubber playmate and his
new friends.

Back into the water wen-t
the dinghy and for another
three hours he repeated his
act. Even the presence at

another large boat. which ‘

had been» radioed to come
and watch the unique show,
didn’t disturb him for more
than the-few minutes it took
him to swim over and inves-
igate it.

 

 

At one point the skipper

of the Salado, John Koehler,
went into the raft to repair
a line broken by the playful
toss of' the whale and Nacho
(the Spanish diminutive for
the name ofthe lagoon) slid
the forward part of his head
into the air beside the craft
—— towering above both it
and John -- in an obvious
attempt to see what had
changed the weight of his
plaything.

'l‘his projection of th e
head vertically above the
water by whales is known
as spy hopping and there
has been argument about its
purpose.

Some cetologists (whale
experts)maintain it is done
to ”assist digestion while
others say that it is done to
bring the eyes, whichvare
well back on th e head,
above the water.

 

 

 

 

 

and man make history

Well, there was no doubt

about what Nacho was
doing. He .was taking a look
into the dinghy. And having
sat'sfied his curiosity, he
began to play again with
the craft and John, lifting
both in the air and obvious-
ly enjoying he whole thing.

But with all his weight
and power he never once
turned the raft over.

At 9 am. the engines
were started momentarily
and Nacho swam away, giv-

ing the captain a chance to

move the ship farther down
the lagoon so that he could
put some whale watchers
out in the skiffs without
having th e m visited by
seven tons of affection.

It worked for the morning
but on an afternoon trip he
suddenly appeared again.

dinghy and lifting it an inch
or so.

The crewman in charge of
the rubber boat, Mary Stein,
headed back to the Salado
with Nacho in tow. Once
there he broke off to play
around the big ship and she
took t h e opportunity to
speed away.

But that wasn’t the end of
this unique encounter be-
tween m a n a n d whale.
Later that afternoon he was

' Spotted playing with anoth-

er young whale a-n'd, without
even getting close, Mary
sped away, happygin the
knowledge he had found a
companion.

However, as the dinghy
roared off through the
choppy s e a he appeared
alongside. gliding smoothly
at their speed. For minutes
he held the course. as if in
farewell, then disappeared.

 

Naturalists Fay W-olfson
and Richard Phillips aboard

the Salado and other ex-
perts aboard other‘ craft,

say there is no record of
any free whale ever acting
in this manner.

Normally, gray whales
are not aggressive unless
you get between a mother
and her calf, but they are
shy -- with reason — and
certainly don’t seek human
company.

Why Nacho did is a mys-
tery._ But he gave the
scientists aboard an unpa-
ralleled opportunity to ob-
serve a gray whale at close
quarters in his natural envi-
ronment ._. something no
one has evervbeen able to do
before.

Andhe gave the grateful
passengers aboard the Sala-
do the thrill of a lifetime.

7-ton playmate wants only
man’s friendship

 

By GEORGE BRYANT
Star associate travel editor

SAN IGNACIO LAGOON, Mexico -—
To sit in a frail rubber dinghy and pat
th e barnacle-encrusted head of a
seven-ton untamed youngwhale is an
experience comprising equal parts of
sheer terror and wild delight.

There’s the 6~foot gash of the mouth
and, as he slides beneath the waves
and rolls, there’s the 10-foot spread of
his belly and now, poised on high.
blocking the sky, the 8-foot width of his
tail flukes, powerful enough to drive a
steam engine through a brick wall.

You are a passenger on a whale-
watching cruise in a lagoon on the west
coast of Mexico‘s Baja California
Peninsula where thousands of gray
whales are spending the winter.

A nd one of them _-— nicknamed
Nacho by the passengers and crew of
the Salado — has chosen a sunny day
early this week to do what no other
free and untamed whale is known to
have done before: Seek out and thor-
oughly enjoy the companionship of
human beings.

Right there beside you disappearing
in the cloudy depths is size enough and
strength enough to squash you like a
fly —- and he has no controls and no
training.

Nobody has apparently ever been
this close to a wild. free and uninjured
young whale before and he’s acting as
no whale ever acted before. Everything
he does is unpredictable.

And still you,trust him. All hehas
exhibited is friendship and a desire for
affection. And he moves the massive
muscles of his body like a ballet. star.
You have the fee-ling he could part
your hair with his tail flakes and you’d
never feel a touch on your scalp.

As you sit there he rolls over again
like a playiful pup and then slides down.
again into the clouded waters, slowly,
gently. delicately, and you again mar.-
vel at the grace and absolute control of
this friendly giant.

Sheer size
is astounding

And you marvel, too, at the sheer
size of this youngster. Thirty feet does-
n’t sound much when you say it. But
when you see it beside you — five
times the width of your large raft,
more than a third the length of the big
ship ~— it seems incredible. Standing on
his tail this playful youngster would
tower three storeys and dominate the
landscape.

But he is a child, full of energy,
ready for adventure, and most intri-
gued by you and your artifacts. And
you wonder why. How does he differ
from his fellows who, decimated by
Whalers, only tolerate your presence?
Why is he the first whale known to ac-
tively seek out the friendship of man?

he became the first whale to seek human companionship, allowing
people to pet him and scratch h-im. Experts say they are baffled by
the young whale’s friendly manner. That 6-foot gash is his mouth.

 




Plays with
anchor line

Earlier you had stood on the fore-
deck of the ship and watched him seize
the three-inch anchor line in his mouth
and play with it as a dog would play
with a rope.

Some dog, some rope.

When it began to run out nobody, but
nobody, tried to hold it. But when. it ap-
peared he might take it all and then

the ship, they decided to put on the-

winch. That, too, might have failedif
he had wanted to force the issue. But-
fortunately he didn’t. 1Instead he gave a
few tugs. which swung the ship’s bow
like: a weathervane, then let go and
came back to play under the craft.

Later that night he spent hours

'rompingabout with the rubber dinghy;
receiving admiration and petting and
obviously'loving every minute of it.

When he relied, his huge eye wouId

inspect the gallery lining the rail like

an actor seeking applause And then
he’ d flip his flukes or roll under the
dinghy and come Up for another look.

You had the feeling he knew exactly
what he’was doing.

The big question concerns the future,-
There are still three trips to the lagoon
v. to be made by the Salado this year and
more coming up next year. And some
other ships do visit the whale watching

grounds here. Will he continue to come

calling? And, since whales can com-
municate and learn from others, will
he bring his pals?

Could this be the start of a very com-
panionable relationship between man
and whale? Or will he forget us on his
long trip to the Arctic this spring? 0r,

worse, meet the wrong people and die-

because be trusted man.

But whatever happens for good or iii,
no one who was on this trip will ever
forget Nacho —- the first whale to make
a friend of man.

There are no answers. You can dnliy
wonder —— and feel a tremendous
sense of gratitude that you were here
when it happened.

And then he nuzzles the raft again
and you reach down to scratch his
nose, too intrigued and awed by the ex-
perience to be frightened, too caught
up in one of life’s great moments to
care.

His skin is soft and smooth, like w'et
suede, even where white circles indie
cate barnacles have once have hold:
and you can feel an irresistable thrust?
as he moves slowly under your hand
with a power nothing can stay. Ceré
tain-ly nothing you’re capable of doing.

Then he slides beneath the waves Tor
the last time and is gone and the great
adventure is over. But not forgotten.
Not by you or anyone of the 32 other
passengers or seven crewmen- aboard
the Salado 85.

HOW TO LIVEN UP YOUR CLASSROOM WITH A POD OF WHALES

Some class sessions devoted to programs on the whales can be
valuable in getting across simple scientific concepts to children by
combining our knowledge of the whale with dance, mime, painting and
writing. The child's understanding and awareness of the world around
him can grow from this.

Tamar Griggs teaches in the public schools of Vancouver a
program she has developed and calls Whale Workshops. She says,
'Science is not an isolated entity that is learned solely through
memory and experiment. It is integrated into a creative environment
that focuses on the child. Our approach involves the direct experience
of the children: reaching the imagination and touching the feelings
as well as the intellect.

Miss Griggs has given us permission to reprint excerpts from her
talk at the National Whale Symposium, University of Indiana, November,
1975.

"Whale Workshops grew out of my exploring just what it is to be
alive as a human being. The subjects we cover are biology, myth,
evolution, whaling and conservation. The expressions that we work
through are dance, drama, painting, and writing. We work with
feelings, imagination, intuition, and thought. It is a total involve-
ment for children.

"The aims of the WOrkshop are twofold: l) to help children
become aware of nature by giving them an immediate experience which
awakens interest and
concern for the natural
world, and 2) to help
children develop their
inner resources. At the
core of the workshops,
therefore, is the child
and whales. Both are
the focal point. In the
workshops they are inter-
woven so that at times
the child stands outside
of the whale, looking at
factual information, and
at other times he is
"inside" the whale.

There is a dynamic
connection between the
child and whales: 22£_
there is a magically huge
creature we are studying
whose survival is directly
affected by humans. And
yet the whales are inside
us because we can relate
to them only by our
personal feelings and
thoughts.

"We work largely
through the children's
bodies because it is a
vivid way of getting the
children involved. we
ask the children to
feel their own backbones
and to imagine what it
would be like if they
couldn't bend or twist
their backs. Whales are
incredibly supple and
graceful in their motion. Photo by Tamar Griggs

(OVER) Making a spout and blowhole.

 




"We pull the shades down and ask the children to curl up on the
floor with their eyes closed and to imagine the entire room is filled
with water - slowly they are to grow as big as the room and swim
around as if they were whales. After they have had this experience,
they are much more sympathetic to others.

"One of the most surprising things about whales is that they
are mammals, yet they spend their entire life in the oceans. Being
mammals, they breathe air. So we work a lot on breath with the
children. Here's how it goes:

a) Put your hands on your ribs, feel their shape, how they
expand and contract as you breathe.

b) If you were a whale, where would your blowhole be? Close
your eyes, put your fingers on your nose and slowly move
them up your forehead, over the top of your head to the
back of your neck. That's where your blowhole would be if
you were a whale.

Now, what happens when the whale comes to the surface to
breathe? What does it do? (let out air) What happens to
its blowhole? (opens) So it opens its blowhole and lets
the air out. Then what does it do? (breathes in...and?...
closes its blowhole). Whales make a tremendous sound as
they let their air out. On quiet days it can be heard for
several miles.

Can one of you make the sound of the whale breathing?
Everyone try it on your own.

How could you make a blowhole out of your hands?

Let's try to make the sound of one whale breathing. First
let me see your hands above your head. Open them and close
them. At the count of three you will hold your breath, close
your blowhole and when 10 seconds are up (I'll count them)
you are all to let out your air, inhale quickly and close
your blowhole. READY?

"This may develop into making a blowhole and spout out of the
children's bodies. And eventually you may build an entire whale
with each child becoming a part of the animal.

"This is a graphic way of learning. By feeling your own body
and getting a sense of its shape, you can better appreciate the
‘form of an alien species. You are identifying with another life form
through exploring the differences and similarities between you." And
pretty soon you can have a classrom where.....

All the whales are swimming together
And eating together

And bumping heads together

And having fun together with pleasure*
