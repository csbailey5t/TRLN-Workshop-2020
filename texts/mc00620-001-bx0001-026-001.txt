WELL DONE HALEDON CHAPTER _
The Officers and Members ‘of Haledon Chapter of the Inter-

national Anti-Vaccination League, are deserving of all kinds of credit'
»‘ for the splendid ﬁght they made against compulsory vaccination as
a condition of attending the public schools of their community. Through
frthe superb and courageous efforts of Haledon Chapter, the Board of
rEducation rescinded the motion which compelled children to be vac-
Icinated. Other places should follow Haledon’s example and put the
clamps on the machinations of vaccinationists. ‘

Vaccination in the Public Schools

The vexing problem concerning compulsory vaccination in
the public schools has again come to the fore in Haledon where
it has been the subject of controversy for some months. Many
residents of the community, feeling that they are right in their
stand, demand that their sons and daughters be admitted to the
Haledon public schools, regardless of the fact that the board has
adopted a rule requiring all pupils to be vaccinated before they
shall be admitted to the schools. .

Inquiry develops that it is asserted as a fact by some authori’
ties that the State law says Boards of Education “may” pass a
rule requiring pupils to be vaccinated before being permitted to
attend school in their districts. It is also learned that the Supreme
Court has ruled that where local boards make such a requirement,
it is enforceable, but this question has not so far as is known at
this writing been passed upon by the Court of Errors or the State
Attorney/General.

It appears to be an open question up to the present time, so
far as legality goes, whether school boards can or cannot be come
pelled to admit pupils contrary to the vaccination rule that those
boards may have adOpted at the suggestion of the Boards of
Health.

Perhaps it would be an acceptable solution to all concerned
if the highest court in the State should rule deﬁnitely on the
subject.

In the meantime residents of Haledon cannot be criticised
for organizing against the compulsory vaccination of their chil’
dren, particularly in view of the fact that the medical profession
itself is divided upon the question of the efficacy and the safety
of the vaccination principle. Reputable physicians are today the
heads of anti/vaccination societies and other doctors of standing
are continually found writing matter for publication advising
against the practice. That being true, it is not strange that many
many parents object to having their children vaccinated, particu’
larly by any compulsory process.

KILLED BY VACCINATION

Another Victim in Newark, N. J.
A Reprint from The Quest

. .. ’N OCTOBER 27TH, 1926, little Elmer Perry, aged four years, of 35
“ Schalk street, Newark, New Jersey, died in the city hospital of Newark
from ‘LOCKJAW, twenty days after being vaccinated. Little Elmer
was the only child of John and Mrs. Perry, and was vaccinated so
as to make it possible for him to go with his parents on a trip to the
‘ ‘ Madeira Islands. A certiﬁcate of effective, satisfactory, and success’
ful vaccination was given to the parents of the little tot now lying in a grave
in a Newark cemetery. The usual assurances of the harmless character of vacci/
nation were taught to the parents, and of course they listened to the song of
the deceptive vaccination siren, and Submitted their child to the scariﬁer and
the ﬁlthy syphilitic vaccine taken from the abdomen of a diseased animal. In
ﬁfteen days, (the period of smallpox and tetanus incubation) little Elmer gave
signs of being quite sick. In ﬁve days more his condition was so serious that
doctors ordered him to the City Hospital of Newark, where his last hope
perished. In a few hours the child was dead, and before the sun set that day
his little dead body was lying in a white casket in the home of his parents, in
Newark, another victim of the murderous results of VACCINATION.

The Public Health Department and the City Hospital are denying all
responsibility for the death of little Elmer Perry. Dr. Charles Caster, city
health officer has declared—~“THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH
THE VACCINE WE USED,” and suggests, that poor little Elmer “MUST
HAVE PULLED OFF THE SCAB, AND ALLOWED INFECTION TO
SET IN.” Dr. E. N. Snavely, medical director of the city hospital said he was
sure there was “NOTHING WRONG WITH THE VACCINE.” And yet
this child died from LOCKJAW. To clear vaccine and vaccination and their
advocates, it is suggested that this child committed accidental suicide. The child
was ﬁrst poisoned with a pus called by the deceptive name of “VACCINE.”
This pus is poisonous, it is extremely dangerous to health and life, and the man
. who uses it either knows this, or he should not be licensed to practice medicine
even among the cannibals of the Fiji Islands. If he knows the real character
of vaccine, and in spite of his knowledge applies it to a human being, he should
be held responsible for its results by a coroner’s jury, and the extreme penalty
of the law for homicide should be invoked. We are opposed to capital punish!
ment, excepting for VIVISECTORS and VACCINATORS.

John and Mrs. Perry were preparing to take Elmer for a pleasure trip to
Madeira, but, instead, they took him to the cemetery. The home at 3’5 Schalk
street, Newark, New Jersey, is now lamenting the loss of a child who ﬁlled
every room with his sunshine,~ and the parents are regretting bitterly the fact
that they listened to the lie of the vaccinating brood and allowed their dead
child to be vaccinated. Will they now join the Newark Chapter of the Anti
Vaccination League and help save the children of others from the hand of the
vaccinator, as well as avenge the death of little Elmer?

Mr. and Mrs. Perry have declared their intention of putting the case of
their child’s death into the courts of New Jersey, which we hope they will
do. Such a ﬁght would have the backing of the vaccine makers to defend the
character of their products, as well as the support of the profession which uses
the death’dealing product. Money would be supplied from the big treasury
of the “interests.” Some Insurance Companies would use the money of their
policyholders to defend the guilty and remove the guilt from vaccination. And
yet, there are sufficient people in this country who would cheerfully contribute
to a real ﬁght, if Mr. and Mrs. Perry will have the courage to inaugurate it.
By all means let vaccine and vaccination in this case clear its skirts in a court
room, or stand before the people of New Jersey, bearing the criminal brand
of Cain.

 

 

 




 

“INFECTION BY PULLING OFF THE S'CAB,” is the old gag of vac,
cinators. How.could the arm of a child polluted with the rotten poisonous
pus extracted from a diseased animal be infected with the ﬁngers of a little
child? If the ﬁngers of little Elmer Perry had picked off the scab after the .
little tips had been dipped into a sewer, they would be incapable of communi/
eating a poison more potent, more dangerous, more threatening to his life than
that which had been. introduced into his arm by a licensed vaccinator, from
a licensed factory, authorized by Federal law to manufacture that which has
sent its tens of thousands to a premature grave. '

A case like that of Elmer Perry justiﬁes the existence of Anti/Vaccination
movements. A mail robbery in Jersey excites everybody. The death of 1a
vaccinated child is nothing. Will Uncle Sam use all his force to protect the
mails, and refuse to protect American citizens? Shall vaccination be permitted
to escape the consequences of the killing of Elmer Perry, the only child of
John and Mrs. Perry of Newark, New Jersey? . ‘ '

In cases of death, like that of four/year/old Elmer Perry, the vaccine makers
charge “faulty technique.” Perfect technique cannot make perfectly safe an
imperfect product. Surgical cleanliness is a joke in connection .with the appli’
cation of a ﬁlthy ﬂuid from a ﬁlthy source. Would a steriliZed shovel purify.
a sewer? What’s the use'of a sterilized scariﬁer preparing the way for the
.introduction of ﬁlthy matter into the human system? Will care in protecting
the sore of vaccination make the ﬁlthy vaccine anythingelse but ﬁlth? -Vaccine
is fundamentally ﬁlth. Vaccination is fundamentally wrong in principle and '
dangerous in practice. Vaccinators should be held fundamentally and primarily
responsible for death and disease which follow the practice of vaccination.

The poisOned blood of Elmer Perry cries out from the soil of a Newark
cemetery against vaccination and demands that vaccinators shall be held by the
State to a strict accountability for the results of this ﬁendish and barbaric prac’
tice. “Bum” Rogers, the arch/criminal, is being hounded for his Crimes while
vaccinators are licensed, vaccine licensed, and the machinery of murder sup’
ported by State money, in State supported Institutions. Let every reader of
this story of the killing of Elmer Perry write Governor Moore of New Jersey
protesting against a continuation of vaccination in the State. .

Dr. Tebb, in his “Century of Vaccination,” gives similar instances and
adds: “Sir Spencer Wells stated that the infant mortality from tetanus in Cali
cutta'1881/90 almost equalled that from all other infantile diseases together.”

Sir William Osler, in his “Practice of Medicine,” 1924 edition, says: “MC’
Farland collected 995 cases, practically all American. . . . The occurrence of
this'ﬁcomplication emphasises the necessity of the most scrupulous care in the
preparation of the virus, as the tetanus bacillus is almost constantly present in
the intestines of cattle.” ' '
