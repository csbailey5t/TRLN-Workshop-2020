Press Secretary to the President
The White House

Washington, D.C. 20500

Dear Mr. Nessen,

Yesterday a small plane flying the plea: "Emperor Hirohito Please
Save the Whales" flew in full compliance with the law and under
complete supervision of the Control Tower at National Airport.

The Animal Welfare Institute which engaged the plane had informed
representatives of the Secret Service, National Park Police, National
Capitol Police, Metropolitan Police and other agencies present at a
meeting September 25th at National Park Police Headquarters that this
plane would fly.

We also informed the Japanese Embassy by phone of this and of the pre-
sentation opposite the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History by repre-
sentatives of eleven environmental and humane groups of a large banner
stating "Your Imperial Majesty, The Whole WOrld Looks to You as Emperor
of a Great Maritime Nation and as a Distinguished Marine Biologist to
End the Commercial Killing of Whales".

Despite our full compliance with all laws and our scrupulous efforts
to make pleas for endangered whales in a respectful, dignified, and
diplomatic manner, the Animal Welfare Institute has been wrongfully
accused in the national news media of violating the restricted zone
because of statements issued by you.

Mr. Jack Hushan, of your office, informs me that after checking with
the Federal Aviation Administration you learned that the plane had
been monitored at all times and was never in violation and that you
so informed members of the press who later inquired.

We therefore request that youissue a statement correcting the erroneous
assessment by Secret Service Agents which led to your initial statement.

To Concerned Humane Societies

 
   
 
  

From the Animal Welfare Institute

Your request for information on how to help prevent pain—
ful experiments on animals by untrained youths has been re-
ceived. Your concern is appreciated.

  
      
 
  

 
 

Enclosed are several of the publications available from
the Animal Welfare Institute on this very serious subject. We
will be glad to make ten copies of any or all of these available
free on request to any humane society. These copies, in turn,
may be presented to your local Superintendent of Schools and to
Principals with the request that all teaching or projects involv-
ing living animals be carefully scrutinized and that any cruelty
and suffering be prohibited.

     
 
 
    
  
  
   
   
  
  
  
 
   
  
  
  
   
  

The Animal Welfare Institute is prepared to provide one free
copy of any or all of these materials to any teacher on request.

It is suggested that a representative of your society who
is familiar with the local educational system present the mate-
rials or accompany the President or other official when the pre—
sentation is made. It is our experience that these educational
materials are almost always accepted with approval and gratitude
by teachers; however, those teachers who wish to promote high
school surgery and other pain—producing procedures can be expected
to object. If you encounter difficulties, we will be glad to
advise you further.

If your city has an annual science fair, be sure to present
these materials to those responsible for organizing it. Ask
them to establish a firm rule against accepting and exhibiting
any project which involved the infliction of suffering on an ani-
mal. California recently passed a law prohibiting painful experi-
ments in high schools. A copy of this law is enclosed for your
information.

If humane organizations make their presence felt, backing up
their request for humane science teaching methods in elementary
and secondary schools with sound educational materials, cruel
experiments by untrained youths can be brought to an end.

We would be pleased to hear from you concerning your progress,
and thank you for the humane effort you are making.

His Excellency ‘

Anatoliy F. Dobrynin

The Ambassador of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics
1125 16th Street, Northwest -

washington, D.C. 20036

Dear Mr. Ambassador,

At the opening of the International Whaling Commission
meeting in London this June, the Commissioner for the Union of
Soviet Socialist Republics announced that one less Soviet whaling
fleet would sail to the antarctic in search of whales this year.
We earnestly request that all whaling by the Soviet Union be
stopped.

We are deeply concerned over the future use of vessels and
equipment now being retired from whaling, since the history of
the decline of the great whales has been so closely associated
with transfer of vessels and equipment from one country to another.
Quota reductions by the International Whaling Commission this year
will be meaningless if excess whaling equipment goes to non -IWC
nations that are not bound in any way to observe these quotas:
for example, the Somali Republic, Guinea, Peru, Chile and others.

we respectfully request that excess explosive harpoons be
destroyed and the vessels retired from whaling be dismantled or
converted to other uses. 'We would deeply appreciate a favorable
decision by your country. Your leadership in banning the killing
of dolphins and polar bears suggests that similar leadership may
be applied to save the declining populations of the great whales.
May we have an affirmative answer in the near future to the
question of disposal of excess whaling equipment?

Very truly yours,

//

Dear Members and Friends:

You are cordially invited to attend the presentation
of the Albert Schweitzer Award of the Animal Welfare Insti-
tute to Stan Wayman, Life photographer whose magnificent
animal photographs have brought recognition to millions of
the need for protection of animals, both domestic and wild.
You will recall his photographs of terrible abuse of dogs
and cats by animal dealers which resulted in.more letters
to Life than any other article that had ever appeared in
the magazine. You may remember, too, those of the rare and
beautiful white wolves so much in need of protection from
trappers, poisoners and hunters. A display of some of Mr.
Wayman's greatest animal photographs will be on view at the
Schweitzer Award Ceremony.

The Honorable Philip Hart, Senior Senator from Michigan
who is Chairman of the important new Subcommittee on Energy,
Natural Resources and the Environment, will present the
medal to Mr. Wayman. Those of you who heard the Senator
conduct the successful hearings on the Endangered Species
Bill earlier this year know at firsthand his deep concern for
the preservation and welfare of animals. The bill passed the
Senate last week.

A reception will follow the ceremony which will be held
in Saint John‘s Parish House, 32u0 O Street, N.W., Washington,
D.C., at 5:30 P.M. on Wednesday, December third. We very
much hope that you will come. You are most welcome to bring
a friend with you who is interested in animal welfare. Kindly
let us know if you plan to come. We look forward to seeing
you.

Sincerely,

URGENT WARNING

 

To Humane Societies
From the Animal Welfare Institute

The American Humane Association has circulated a memorandum
to all humane organizations enclosing a leaflet entitled "Guiding
Principles for the Use of Animals by Secondary School Students and
Science Club Members." These guidelines do n2£_oppose amateur
surgery, use of disease causing materials (including diseases which
the students themselves can catch and spread), materials that cause
cancer, dangerous radiation or other pain infliction on animals.

The newly passed California law against cruel experiments by school
children makes such activities illegal whether or not they are done
under scientific supervision as per the AHA guidelines. The laws
of the States of Illinois and Maine, both of which have withstood
attempts by the promoters of children's experiments to repeal them,
are also in direct conflict with the guidelines being distributed
by the American Humane Association.

YOUR HUMANE SOCIETY WILL BE ENCOURAGING TEACHERS AND STUDENTS
TO BREAK THE LAW in these three states and perhaps in others if
you distribute the AHA guidelines. Further, all humane societies
should support legislation similar to the California law in their
own states. The American Humane Association guidelines are also
being distributed by the National Society for Medical Research, which
has opposed all efforts to end surgery and other painful procedures
on animals by untrained youths. Don't help the apologists for cruel
experiments by high school students by distributing this anti-humane
material.

Enclosed are guidelines approved by the organizations which
have devoted serious efforts to prevent cruel treatment of animals
in science fairs, elementary and high school classrooms and childrens'
homes.

If you want more information and background material, fill out
the coupon below and mail to the Animal Welfare Institute.

Please send me further information on how we can help prevent painful
experiments on animals by untrained youths.

Dear Reader,

The Animal Welfare Institute needs your support.

We do not employ profeSsional fund raisers. A great deal of our work is
done on a volunteer basis. This appeal to you is made as an inexpensive enclosure
with a regular issue of the Information Report because we believe charitable fUnds
should be carefhlly conserved and expended to achieve maximum help for animals in
need. The Animal Welfare Institute does not have an endowment fund. We depend on
the generosity of the public to make the work posSible. Contributions are promptly
used for the benefit of animals.

You have been receiving the quarterly Information Reports. Should you
wish to have a copy of the annual report and a listing of materials available from
the Institute we will be happy to send these to you with answers to any questions
you may have. '

Memberships are $2, $5, $10, and $100. Larger donations are badly needed
and will be applied to projects in which the donor is especially interested if so
specified. For example: Protection of Whales. Next year's International Whaling
Commission meeting is crucial to the fate of the great whales. At this year's
meeting the proposal for a ten-year moratorium on commercial killing lost by a
vote of 4-6 with 4 abstentions. That vote can be reversed - but it will take
major effort on an international scale. The excruciating pain caused by an explo-
sive harpoon in a whale's intestines (the most common place for a hit as the whale
dives) cannot be tolerated by civilized people - and there is no need to tolerate
it. There is not a single product from whales that cannot either be synthesized
.or substituted for. The United States uses no whale products. All importation
ended in 1971.

 

The Animal Welfare Institute is very fortunate in the high calibre of
working members who serve without compensation. In the last Information Report
you read the analysis by F. Barbara Orlans, Ph.D. of science fairs and the suffer-
ing and death inflicted by untrained high school students in search of prizes.

The cruelty, as is well documented by Dr. Orlans, is often matched by the ignorance
displayed. The Animal Welfare Institute calls for an end to this travesty of
science. We urge both scientists and non-scientists to bring humanity and decency
to science activities by high school youths.

The Animal Welfare Institute welcomes your comments and suggestions on
its work. We would welcome you as a member or contributor if you wish to use the
enclosed self-addressed envelope for that purpose.

Sincerely,

Kai/2’2; $9.

The Animal Welfare Institute is very fortunate in the high calibre of
working members who serve without compensation. In the last Information Report
you read the analysis by F. Barbara Orlans, Ph.D. of science fairs and the suffer-
ing and death inflicted by untrained high school students in search of prizes.
The cruelty, as is well documented by Dr. Orlans, is often matChed by the ignorance
displayed. The Animal Welfare Institute calls for an end to this travesty of
science. We urge both scientists and non—scientists to bring humanity and decency
to science activities by high school youths.

The Animal Welfare Institute welcomes your comments and suggestions on
its work. We would welcome you as a member or contributor if you wish to use the
enclosed self-addressed envelope for that purpose.

Sincerely,

Dear Friends,

The animals that are used for fur need help. Many are
captured by that instrument of torture, the steel leg-hold
trap. Such intense agony and terror does this hideous
mechanism inflict that a large proportion of the animals
caught in its jaws gnaw off their own legs in order to escape -
this means of escape is so common that trappers invented the
so-called "Stop-loss” trap that grips the animal twice so that
it cannot free itself by self-inflicted maiming.

That our fellow human beings would be willing deliberately
to cause such long-drawn-out pain and fear for the mere sake of
a small amount of money is so shocking to many peOple that they
can scarcely credit it, yet the trapping continues, sometimes
by children who beat the victims to death after they are found.

Clearly, it is the duty of humanitarians to work in every
way they can to bring an end to this unmitigated evil. To do
so, it is essential that the basic facts be readily available
to all who seek remedies. At present there is no up-to-date
publication providing this information, and in order to provide
it, F. Jean Vinter, M.D., who wrote the first edition of "Facts
About Furs” in 1957 when she was Technical Secretary of The
Universities Federation for Animal Welfare, has now completely
revised the 47-page manual and made it available without charge
to the Animal Welfare Institute. We are deeply grateful to Dr.
Vinter for this generous contribution. Now we must raise the
funds necessary to print the new edition.

Cost of typesetting, printing and binding 5,000 c0pies is
estimated at $3,000. Won't you please help make this possible
by donating just as generously as you can? These tortured ani-
mals need your help. Contributions to the Animal Welfare Insti-
tute are deductible in computing income.tax.

DEAR HUMANITARIANS:

THANKS TO YOUR GOOD WORK AND THAT OF THOUSANDS OF OTHER HUMANE CITIZENS,
P. L. 89-5hh, THE LABORATORY ANIMAL WELFARE ACT, WAS PASSED. AS YOU
KNOW, ITS ENFORCEMENT WAS ASSIGNED TO THE ANIMAL HEALTH DIVISION OF THE
UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. I BELIEVE YOU WILL BE INTER-
ESTED IN READING THE REMARKS OF TWO OF THE HUMANE VETERINARIANS WHO ARE
RESPONSIBLE FOR CARRYING OUT ITS REQUIREMENTS FOR HUMANE CARE AND HOUSING
OF ANIMALS. A COPY-OF THE INFORMATION REPORT WHICH GIVES AN ACCOUNT OF
THE ALBERT SCHWEITZER MEDAL CEREMONY OF THE ANIMAL WELFARE INSTITUTE IS
ENCLOSED. '

FOR SOME TIME YOU HAVE RECEIVED CIRCULAR LETTERS FROM THE SOCIETY FOR
ANIMAL PROTECTIVE LEGISLATION, WITH WHICH MADELEINE BEMELMANS AND I WORK.
LEGISLATION NEEDS To BE BACKED UP WITH EDUCATION, SO BOTH OF US WORK, TOO,
WITH THE ANIMAL WELFARE INSTITUTE, WHICH DEVOTES ITSELF TO THIS OTHER VITAL
ARM OF ANIMAL PROTECTION. THE A.W.I. PUBLISHES AND DISTRIBUTES MANUALS FOR
SCHOOLTEACHERS (SEE THE ENCLOSED LISTING UNDER "HUMANE EDUCATION"), FOR THE
GENERAL PUBLIC, AND FOR SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS (SEE THE LISTING UNDER
"LABORATORY ANIMALS"). IN THIS WAY, WE ARE ABLE TO INFLUENCE THOSE PEOPLE
DIRECTLY IN TOUCH WITH THE ANIMALS, THE ADMINISTRATORS WHO MAKE DECISIONS
ABOUT FUNDS FOR PROPER CARE OF THE ANIMALS, AND VETERINARIANS THROUGHOUT
THE COUNTRY WHO, NOW THAT P. L. 89~5hh, THE LABORATORY ANIMAL WELFARE ACT,
HAS BEEN PASSED, ARE TAKING AN EVER GREATER ROLE IN BRINGING ABOUT BETTER
TREATMENT OF RESEARCH ANIMALS.

IN ORDER TO CARRY ON THE WORK OF THE R.W.I., WE WANT YOU As A MEMBER; AND
WE BELIEVE THAT YOU, BECAUSE OF YOUR INTEREST IN ANIMALS, WILL FIND IT OF
REAL VALUE TO RECEIVE THE QUARTERLY INFORMATION REPORTS OF THE A.W.I.,
WHICH WILL KEEP YOU ABREAST OF SOME OF THE DEVELOPMENTS WHICH CANNOT BE
INCLUDED IN MAILINGS FROM THE SOCIETY FOR ANIMAL PROTECTIVE LEGISLATION.
FURTHER, WE SHOULD DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT CONTRIBUTIONS To
THE R.W.I. ARE OEDUCTIBLE IN COMPUTING INCOME TAX, THOUGH THOSE To THE
SOCIETY FOR ANIMAL PROTECTIVE LEGISLATION ARE NOT (S.A.P.L. IS REGISTERED
UNDER THE FEDERAL LOBBYING ACT).

IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE A.W.I. OR WOULD LIKE SOME ADDITIONAL INFOR-
MATION BEFORE BECOMING A MEMBER, PLEASE LET ME KNOW. WE WOULD WELCOME You’
AND HOPE TO HEAR FROM YOU SOON. YOUR MEMBERSHIP WILL HELP ADVANCE THE WEL-
FARE CF THE ANIMALS FOR WHOSE RIGHTS WE ARE WORKING.

WASHINGTON. An appeal to Emperor Hirohito to end
commercial whaling by Japan was made by conservationists
today. ‘

The Japanese whaling industry kills more than 40% of the
35,000 great whales killed annually. All but one of these
species is listed by the United States Government as in
danger of extinction. The United Nations calls for a ten-
year moratorium on commercial whaling.

In a recent interview, Emperor Hirohito, a distinguished
marine biologist, stated: '"I believe that if people
would treat nature carefully it would be possible to
protect the environment and permit life and nature to
flourish."

' The Animal Welfare Institute, Defenders of Wildlife,
Fund for Animals and Friends of the Earth stated in
conjunction with a plea to the Emperor at the time of
his visit to the Smithsonian Institution, "The traditional
Japanese reverence for nature is widely acclaimed by
all peOples. The Emperor and Empress personify this living
in harmony with Nature. The depredations of the whalers
are therefore a great disservice to Japan. There is no
need for whale products in the modern world economy. But
Japanese and Soviet whalers continue to ruthlessly hunt
down the last of the whales. It is a tragedy for all
mankind that the eight species of great whales are now
listed as endangered species.

"Emperor Hirohito would do a great service to Nature
and future generations of man by leading Japanese public
Opinion to put an end to whaling in Japan."

Dear Friend of Whales,

The Emperor of Japan is scheduled to visit the United States
September 30 - October 13. Emperor Hirohito is a marine biologist.
He is revered in Japan. Although tradition precludes his making a
public statement on the whales, his influence is enormous, and it
is of great importance that he be made aware during his visit of
the depth of feeling in our country on the fate of the whales.

Please write to him respectfully requesting him to do every-
thing in his power to obtain a ten-year moratorium by Japan on the
commercial killing of whales. The Emperor may be addressed:

His Majesty

Emperor of Japan

Embassy of Japan

2520 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W.
washington, D.C. 20008

Demonstrations are being planned in cities which the emperor
will visit: Williamsburg, Virginia, Washington, D.C., WOods Hole,
Massachusetts, Chicago, Illinois, Los Angeles, California, La Jolla,
California and Honolulu, Hawaii. Please let us know if you wish to
take part. If you do not live in one of the cities named, a demon-
stration in your own town will be helpful, too.

Thanks to your efforts and those of a constantly growing army
of whale protectors, there are, at last, some real signs that the
whales can be saved, but countering these are powerful forces being
unleashed by the greed of the dying whaling industry. The campaign
to save the whales has reached a critical point. WE MUST PERSIST.
WE MUST CONTINUE TO INCREASE THE EFFECT OF THE BOYCOTTTUF UKPXNEEE
AND SOVIET GOODS.

THE CAMPAIGN SO FAR

253 demonstrations using AWI whale campaign materials have been
held in 156 different locations throughout the United States and
Canada. Many friends of whales have organized two or more demon-
strations. MORE ARE NEEDED.

The Animal Welfare Institute has run 85 half and full-page ads
in 67 newspapers including The National Observer, The New York Times,
The Los An eles Times, The maami Herald, The wall ShheEE"JournaI, The
DETlEETTimes Herald, THE—Portland Oregonihh: Newsda , The Hartford—‘-
Courant, The SeaEtIe TTmes, The San Die 0 Union, The Phhhlana IhaIne)

san Francisco Bay Guhhdian, Parade, The—WEShington Posh and The—35 an
TTﬁes in Tokyo. This 1ast-mentioned‘53 was headed "Kn AppeaT—Eo Ehe
Japanese PeOple" and it elicited a quick response from the Japanese
Whaling Association which ran a rival half-page ad attempting to
persuade the reader that "whale populations are now on the increase"!

 

 

MORE AWI ADVERTISEMENTS ARE NEEDED IN ORDER TO INFORM MORE
PEOPLE OF THE FACTS.

The editor of our local newspaper should receive a letter from
E0

ygg,'§§hing readhhs join in the boycoEt of Japanese and Russian
goods. Let them know that they can obtain free fliers, bumper
stickers, and buttons from the Animal welfare Institute to distribute
to friends and others interested in helping to save the whales. A
copy of the new AWI flier is enclosed, and we'll be happy to send
you as many as you can pass out.

 




 

If on can or anize a demonstration, let us know. We'll gladly
send you a l Eﬁe information and materials you need, free gf charge.

EVERY PUBLIC ACTION FOCUSING ON THE NEED FOR A TEN YEAR
MORATORIUM ON COMMERCIAL WHALING AND THE BOYCOTT WILL HELP END THE
SENSELESS KILLING.

Here are a few statistics which you may find useful in letter-
writing. Japan has 77 joint fishing ventures in 38 countries. So-
called "dummy" whaling companies have been set up in Peru and
Korea, neither of which nations adhere even to the weak restrictions
of the International Whaling Commission.

Whaling factory ships are no longer being built by any country
because there are too few whales left to make the necessary invest-
ment pay. Existing factory ships are obsolescent and probably down
to their last few years of life, but at present killing rates, major
whale populations could be virtually wiped out before the factory
ships give out. There is every commercial incentive to do just that.
Japan exported over two hundred million dollars worth of fish to the
United States in l9737"“THE‘WE513_UEEEEe§E_WH§Iing industry is now
capitalized at little more than one fourth of this amount.

Japanese whaling is conducted by subsidiaries of the giant
conglomerates which include manufacturers of cameras, automobiles
and electronic equipment. Enormous financial entities such as
Mitsubishi and Mitsui constantly adjust to changes in the course of
making billions of dollars in international trade. A few years more
or less of whaling would affect them to about the degree that a
mosquito might affect an elephant. But to the whales, it means the
difference between life and death both of individuals and species.
To human beings it means the difference between preserving the great
whales as a basic part of the ocean ecosystem - an ecosystem on which
the continued availability of oxygen depends. These are matters that
do not bear comparison with commercial profit, and when the commercial
profit in question is necessarily short term and minon,as is now the
case with whaling, the fact of even having to argue over its con-
tinuance would be ridiculous if it were not tragic.

PLEASE KEEP WORKING FOR PROTECTION OF THE WHALES.

You are cordially invited to become a member of the Animal Welfare
Institute. The uarterly Information Reports sent to members will bring
you current deveIopments in the fight to save the whales. Please join
with us and order materials for the campaign.

CONSERVATIONISTS STILL VIEW WHALES AS INDUSTRY PAWNS

 
 

Conservation groups observing the 27th meeting of the
International Whaling Commission in London, June 23-27, 1975,
voiced discouragement at the Commission's actions and once again
called for the ten year moratorium recommended by the United
Nations.

    
     
   
   
 
 
   
 
 

At the 1974 meeting the moratorium was cast aside in favor
of a management scheme which, in theory, would give protection
to the most depleted species and stocks. This year, however,
when the implementation of the scheme came to a vote, the whaling
interests again were able to apply enough pressure on the
Commission to obtain major compromises.

  

On key quotas, the Scientific Committee's recommendations
were ignored where they did not fit in with industry requirements.

Touted as a meeting in which scientists would make objective
decisions on whale populations and the commissioners of the
fifteen member nations would follow their advice, the 1975 meeting
fell pathetically far short of its advance publicity. By the time
the seemingly endless compromises had been haggled out, 32,578
great whales were scheduled for death by the explosive harpoons

of IWC nations. The Commission took no action in behalf of the
small whales currently being slaughtered despite a thorough
report on dangers to their populations submitted by the
International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

       
   
      
   
   
 
  
    
  
 
   
 
   

Sir Peter Scott of the world Wildlife Fund called for a
moratorium on commercial whaling and assailed the current minke
whale overkill. "What are you going to do about it?" he asked
the Commission bluntly. The answer was a reduction in the minke
quota in the southern oceans from 7,000 to 6,810 (to include the
approximately 900 not included in last year's schedule) and even
such a small saving of whales was fiercely opposed by both the
major whaling nations, Japan and Russia. The industry's attitude
was the same on sperm whales. Hard as these two countries tried
to fill their quota of 8,000 males and 5,000 female sperm whales
in the southern hemisphere last season, all they could find and
kill were 6,677 males and 3,497 females. Yet the Japanese and
Soviet Commissioners again aggressively demanded the 8,000-5,000
quota. It is evident that the intent is to kill as many as

OVER




possible and leave the numerical quotas floating well above the
whalers' most optimistic hopes. Indeed, in its 27-year history,
the IWC has virtually made it a policy to set quotas above what
the industry could catch despite increased effort and new tech-
nology.

Not only on total species quotas but on other conservation
measures the big two showed their colors. When the Scientific
Committee recommended that the antarctic seas be divided into
nine areas according to sperm whale pOpulations in the regions,
the Soviet Commissioner, Mr. Nikoronov, told the commission that
such a division would be tantamount to reducing the kill of
sperm whales by 50%. He threatened his fellow commissioners in
the classical IWC manner ordering them to "seek a compromise...
otherwise we shall reserve our decision to ourselves and do
what we find appropriate."

Did the Commissioners stand staunchly by the scientific
recommendations? Not at all. Instead, they asked the Scientific
Committee to backtrack and divide the antarctic into six areas
the number the Russian whalers were prepared to accept.

When the Japanese Commissioner, Mr. Fujita, sought to raise
a key percentage (recommended by the Scientific Committee in the
computation of all quotas) from 10% to 20% because he said the
smaller percentage would lower the quota on sei whales by 38%,
a remarkable new scheme surfaced, known as "the Graham line"
(after the British Commissioner of that name). By a strange
coincidence, computations following the Graham line exactly pro-
duced the number of sei whales Mr. Fujita had been demanding!“

In a remarkable show of contortionist ability, the Commission
voted for "the Allen line" (a straight line named after the
Chairman of the Scientific Committee) for all the whales except
sei whales in the antarctic where the "broken" Graham line
(which elbows its wa at a 90 angle into the danger zone for
the whales' survival) won their approval. This means that in
one of the areas of the antarctic where no sei whales at all were
to have been killed, had the scientific advice on their safety
been followed, 540 are now scheduled for slaughter. In another
area 110 additional seis will be available for harpooning. At
an estimated $7,000 per sei whale* that amounts to $4,550,000.

The new Mexican Commissioner, Dr. Andres Rozental, a lawyer
who played an active role in the 1973 conference when the
Convention on International Trade in Threatened and Endangered
Species of Fauna and Flora was drafted, focused badly needed
analysis on a quota-raising move involving three species instead
of one as its author had claimed.

 

*a figure confirmed by the head of one of the three major
Japanese whaling companies who regularly attends all IWC meetings

In the recurring "Graham line" discussions even the United
States finally agreed to its acceptance for a single year when
Mr. Graham explained it affected only the two sei whale stocks in
the antarctic. But Mexico voted against this motion and explained
the vote by pointing out that minke and sperm whales would also be
affected - about six hundred whales. The Norwegian Chairman,
Mr. Rindal, grumbled, "We were assured only two sei stocks were
affected," and Graham had to backtrack: "Sorry if I misled the
Commission in that respect," he said.

Mr. Graham also put in his oar when it came to funding for
shooting the rifle-barrel style "discovery marks" into whales -
marks that can only be "discovered" if the whale is later har-
pooned. Graham said he was concerned about the contributions to
the fund for marking "as the UK organizes the whale marking
thing." No concern was expressed by him or any of the other
Commissioners for the part of the Scientific Committee's Report
which states: "...due to the possibility of mortality associated
with marking, it may be dangerous to mark protected stocks which
are at a very low level." And the Committee itself wants "pro-
tected" species to continue to be marked "for return in catches
taken under special permit." Last year 17 blue whales, l3 hump-
backs (how will their songs be affected by the painful marker in
their flesh?) and one bowhead were so marked.

With respect to the killing of lactating whales and whales

below the minimum length, South Africa has the dubious distinction
of leading the world, according to the IWC's report on infractions.
Although its catch is relatively small, compared with Japan and
Russia, South Africa acknowledges a large percentage of error:
20.59% for baleen whales, 6.74% for sperm whales, and 6.96% for
minke whales. South Africa prOposed that international observors
be posted on all catcher boats - not merely on the huge factory
ships or at the shore station where the actual killing cannot be
supervised - but the proposal was rejected as "impractical."

Mr. K.J. Botes, the South African inspector at the Australian
land station, reported that "22 lactating sperm whales were landed
during the 1974 season. It could not be ascertained whether or
not these whales were actually accompanied by calves when killed."
Mr. Botes recommended "that an inspector be appointed to each
whale catcher even if this is possible for only one season es-
pecially to ascertain the numbers of lactating whales thus BEE-
vidin a comparison with a season without an inspector on board."
(Emphasis supplied.) _' __ _— '

 

 

No one knows how many orphan whales are left to starve after
the harpooning of their mothers. What happens to the gunners who
shoot the mother whales? In most cases, withholding of the bonus
they get each time they kill a whale is the only punishment Japa-
nese harpooners receive although their Soviet counterparts may be
fined in addition to losing the bonus. Infractions reported in
pelagic whaling, however, are fewer than at shore stations. None

OVER

 




at all have been reported for the North Atlantic because, strange
though it seems, this is the first year that the lWC has formally
acknowledged that whales killed in this part of the globe should
be counted in the quotas! The North Atlantic quota for 1975-76
totals more than three thousand. As for whales killed for "scien-
tific purposes" these still do not appear on the schedule and
their numbers remain one of the IWC's many well-hidden items -
appearing only after a year's wait in the annual report of the
Commission.

A proposal to kill between one hundred and five hundred
Bryde's whales was rumored outside the precincts of the Scientific
Committee, the IWC's Sanctum Sanctorum where no mere journalist
has ever been permitted to set foot and from which the observers
for conservation organizations are likewise excluded. There is
no way even for scientists on the committee to assess the scien-
tific competence involved in such off-the-record killings because
the national commissioners have full jurisdiction in granting
scientific permits.

The large majority of the Scientific Committee has or had
connections with the whaling industry. Few of its members have
any compunctions about whale killing for profit.

The reader may indeed wonder at the strange machinations of
this curious international body which the U.N. observer, Dr. Kai
Curry-Lindahl of Sweden, characterized as "inoperative" because
of the, as he put it, "veto right by a minority, which, in effect,
makes this convention inoperative."

However, any attempt to improve the convention meets with
opposition. Even the modest suggestions approved by an IWC
committee may not be circulated generally. U.S. Commissioner
Dr. Robert White suggested that, after circulating the draft to
member nations and assembling their comments, the proposal should
be sent to other nations. But Mr. Fujita and Mr. Rindal echoed
one another in pronouncing this "premature."

The IWC still belongs to the old guard. Yet this year's quota
cuts (approximately 8,500 whales) were larger than any ever adopted
in the past. The boycott and demonstrations have had an effect.
Their continuance is essential if further needed protection for
the whales is to be won. Indeed they are needed even to hold the
modest gains won this year. When the antarctic fin whale quota
was cut to 220, Mr. Fujita stressed that this must be the decision
for this year only, and Mr. Rindal reassured him that indeed that
was always so. The Chairman's reassurance that the reduced fin
whale quota is "only for the coming season which has always been
the case," makes clear the transitory nature of any protection the
IWC may give.

2520 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20008

Dear Mr. Prime Minister,

We are informed that the factory ship Tonan Maru No. 2
and her nine catcher boats will not sail to the antarctic in
the 1975-76 whaling season. We understand that a second
Japanese whaling fleet may also be dropped. We earnestly
request that all whaling by Japan be stopped.

We respectfully ask that you ensure that all excess vessels
and associated whaling equipment be dismantled or completely
rebuilt for other use so the tragic history of the whales
will not come to its final conclusion through continued transfer
of whaling ships and harpoons from one company or one nation
to another. Your action in preventing any further use of these
vessels for whaling would be most deeply appreciated throughout
the world.

We earnestly hope you will make a favorable decision now
before it is too late.

Our fellow countrymen would warmly welcome such a decision
while you are still on our shores.

Very truly yours,

ANIMAL EXPRESSIONS
A New Publication of the Animal Welfare Institute

When Charles Darwin wrote Expression of tbe Emotions
in Man and Animals, he tried to obtain illustrations for it
by having people act out a feeling and pose before 'a cam-
era or by having sketches made of an animal expression.
But the actors and artists he relied on were so far from able
to equal the brilliant and original thinking detailed in the
text that their efforts throw a deceptively old-fashioned air
over the book—a book which is, in many ways, so much
ahead of its time that modern thought has not yet caught
up with it.

Animal Expressions, a collection of 106 photographs
published by the Animal Welfare Institute, brings the pow-
ers of modern photography in the hands of gifted observers
to bear on Darwin's thought.

Published with a Foreword by Dr. F. J. Mulhern, Dep-
uty Administrator of the Agricultural Research Service,
United States Department of Agriculture, it has a practical
as well as a scientific and humane purpose: to acquaint
persons who have responsibility for maintaining animals
with some basic animal expressions and to encourage fur-
ther observation and study of such expressions and the ef-
fects on the animals of the emotions they communicate.

Leading photographers who contributed their work in-
clude Erica Anderson, known internationally for her photo-
graphs of Dr Albert Schweitzer and Lambaréné and who
has now founded the Schweitzer Friendship House in Great
Barrington, Massachusetts; Stan Wayman, whose work is
known to all readers of Life magazine and whose prize-
winning animal picture stories have brought understanding
of animals to millions; Baron Hugo van Lawick, foremost
photographer of wild chimpanzees, whose wife, Baroness
Jane van. Ilawick Goodall, has acquired an unsurpassed
knowledge of these remarkable animals in their African
homes; and Ernest Walker, author of the classic three-vol-
ume 'Mammals of t/se World, whose skill in capturing ex-
pression is the result of a lifetime of sympathetic study of
the animals for whom he has such great respect and ad-
miration. In appraising the photographs, Darwin’s system
of showing them to others to obtain their reactions was fol-
lowed, with particular reliance on three outstandingly well-
qualified individuals.

Dr. Michael Fox’s experimental work in animal behavior
and psychology made his comments on the photographs of
especial interest from the standpoint of these disciplines.
The evaluation of Ernest Bélanger, originator of the "Ot-
tawa System,” shown in the AWI film, "Laboratory Dogs,"
brought a more personal but similarly keen observation to
bear, based on his experience in handling large numbers of
individual animals under laboratory conditions. Dr. Mul-
hern, from a broad experience in regulatory veterinary med-
icine, added an American directness to the analytical French
and the scientific British views. There was surprising unan-
imity of appraisal of expressive gesture and facial delinea-
tion, chief differences being in the form rather than the
content of verbal description.

Subsequent comments by persons looking through the
published photographs indicate that there is broad under-
standing of animal expressions by people of the most di-
verse experience and education. It would seem that industry
is the main requirement to build as large a body of photo
graphic evidence of Darwin’s early observations as may be
desired for any purpose.

One copy of the 54-page publication will be sent free
on request to veterinarians and persons employed by re-
search institutions in the management of animal colonies or
care of animals. Others may purchase it at cost price, 75c,
by writing tothe AWI at the address above.

AWI BOOTH EXHIBIT AT THE
CONVENTION OF THE AMERICAN
VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION

Veterinarians attending the 104th annual convention of
the American Veterinary Medical Association in Dallas, Tex-
as, July 9-13, demonstrated a strong interest in the wel-
fare of research animals and in the implementation of the
Laboratory Animal Welfare Act, P. L. 89-544, as illustrated
at the AWI exhibit. Two panels contrasted the best and
the worst in care and housing of research animals. On the
good side photographs of chimpanzees at Holloman Air
Force Base were featured in the charge of veterinarians.
Dr. Jerry Fineg, who was present at the convention, was
shown giving cough medicine to Billy, a young animal
whose features were immediately recognized by other Hollo-
man veterinarians visiting the booth.

Other primate care and housing featured the Oregon
Regional Primate Center, the outdoor quarters at the Uni-
versity of Florida at Gainesville, the Delta Regional Pri-
mate Center, and Parke, Davis. Good care and housing for
research dogs included photographs from Bowman-Gray;
School of Medicine, the Veterans Administration Hospital
in Minneapolis, Brooklyn Jewish Hospital, and the Veter-
inary Virus Research Center at Cornell University in Ith-
aca. Outstanding cat quarters at Purina Research Center and
Ontario Veterinary College and guinea pig cages at Dart-
mOuth Medical School were featured. Loose housing for
guinea pigs, rabbits, and cats at Thudichum Research Cen-
ter, Galesburg State Hospital, were shown, and for livestock
at the National Institutes of Health, Poolesville facility.

In the panel showing bad conditions for research animals,
the premises of animal dealers were emphasized, though
some photographs from research institutions were also
shown. The photographs were selected to point up abuses
which must end when P. L. 89-544 is fully enforced. Cap-
tions included: Lack of Veterinary Care, Lack of Shelter
from the Elements, Lack of Light, Dead Animals and
Disease Hazards, No Food except Offal, Lack of Space,
Feet through the Mesh, Animals Hosed along with Cages,
Overcrowding, and Debris and Filth. With each such head-
ing the relevant section of the regulations promulgated Feb-
ruary 24th by the United States Department of Agriculture
was mounted, and the issue of the Federal Register in which
it appeared displayed.

In the center panel of the exhibit was the Albert Schweit-
zer Medal. A leaflet listing the medallists was available to
all who wished this information; and the first annual
Schweitzer award, which went to a veterinarian, Dr. Rob-
ert Bay, in 1955 for outstandingly; humane care and man-
agement of research dogs, was featured.

The new AWI publication, Animal Expressions, was
completed just in time for the convention; and its popu-
larity was such that an extra emergency air shipment sent
the first time all copies ran out was also completely used
up. (Animal Expressions, is described in the adjoining ar—
ticle.) Also available on the basis of one free copy to each
veterinarian was the AWI manual, Comfortable Quarters
for Laboratory Animals, the 103-page illustrated publication
showing a variety of well-designed animal quarters for dif-
ferent species of research animals. Hundreds of copies were
examined by veterinarians at the booth and taken.

Film releases on the AWI film, "Laboratory Dogs,” (see
page 3 of this Information Report) were available. The
only publication for which a charge was made was Studying
Oar Fellow Mammals, by Ernest P. Walker (published by
the AWI, 174 pages, illustrated, $1.00). Here, too, the ex-

tent of the demand was much underestimated, since this-

CONSORTIUM FOR CHIMPANZEES AT HOLLOMAN AIR FORCE BASE, ALAMAGORDO, NEW MEXICO

 

Experimental chimpanzees have a three acre area at their disposal and may enter an air conditioned building at will, where food,
water, and resting shelves are, available. The Consortium was designed by Dr. Jerry Fineg, a Lieutenant Colonel in the Air Force
Veterinary Corps, as a means of giving the chimpanzees greater freedom of movement and still maintaining control of research

subjects.

 

AWI Booth at the Convention of the American

was the first time the AWI had exhibited at an AVMA
Convention. Children were offered free copies of "Good
Kind Lion,” written and illustrated by one-time Pam/a
editor and cartoonist, Fougasse, and "You and Your Dog.”

International Veterinary Congress in Paris

Dr. James Steele, Chief, Veterinary Public Health Sec-
tion, Epidemiology Program of the National Communicable
Disease Center, United States Public Health Service, made
the summation at the Seminar on the Laboratory Animal
Welfare Act on the last day of the AVMA Convention.
He took a keen interest in the AWI exhibit; and since he
was flying directly to Paris for the International Veterinary
Congress, which is held once every four years, he requested
that the AWI ship to him by air express for distribution
there one hundred copies of each of the following: Com-
fortable Quarter: for Laboratory Animals, Animal Exprer-
.rz'om, Film releases on “Laboratory Dogs,” AWI Informa-

tion Reports Vol. 15, No. 5, and. Vol. 16, No. 1, the Lab-—

oratory Animal Welfare Act, P. L. 89-544, the regulations
promulgated by the Secretary of Agriculture February 24th,
and listings of materials available to veterinarians free or
at cost price from the AWI. These were immediately dis-
patched to Paris.

Dr. Steele emphasized the importance of raising stand-
ards in research animal care and housing, particularly in
those places Where research results are being neutralized
and made unprofitable by poor conditions for the animals.
He estimates that about 10% of current research involving
experimental animals is so neutralized and that the approxi-
mate loss in money is $300,000,000 per year.

 

THUNDER AND THE
NATIONAL SOCIETY
FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH

The National Society for Medical Research reacted typ-
ically when a dog wearing its license tags was noted in a
hospital animal room by the Laboratory Animal Consultant
of the Animal Welfare Institute, Mrs. Robert Dyce. In its
July Bulletin the NSMR alleged, ”It is a matter of record,
however, that he [the dog] was impounded as a stray, held
for the required time by pound officials, released to an
animal dealer, and sold by the dealer on May 12 to the
Veterans Hospital in Ann Arbor.” It further claimed, "One
report states that the dog had been held in the Pontiac,

    

Michigan Pound for 9 days, and the owners notified by a
postal card during the time that their dog was impounded."
These statements are not corroborated by the sworn affi-
davits of any of the persons involved in this case.

It is unlikely that it will ever be. known where the dog,
Thunder, was during the three months that his owners
were seeking for him. They repeatedly searched for him
at the pound. They received no notification from the pound
at any time that he was there and would have reclaimed
him. immediately had they been so notified. The pound has
no record of his ever having been there.*

These facts are noted to keep the record straight, since
it seems to be the desire of the NSMR to suggest that the
AWI was somehow responsible for misrepresenting facts.
There has been no such misrepresentation.

A most interesting fact was brought to light by the in-
vestigation of the United: States Department of Agriculture.
inspector working under the Laboratory Animal Welfare
Act, P. L. 89-544, which had gone into effect for dog deal-
ers only the day before Thunder was returned to his own- .
ers. The dealer, Edward Radzilowsky, alias Rogers, had ob-
tained a license on the basis of his own affidavit. When he
returned to the hospital delivering more dogs and learned
that Mrs. Dyce had observed the license tag hanging from
Thunder’s neck, he removed the tag and, according to his
own sworn testimony, discarded it! This is the usual
system followed by dog dealers, and the piles of collars
and tags found on dog farms have long caused great con-
cern to animal protective workers seeking to prevent the
sale of owned pets to scientific institutions. Fortunately,
Mrs. Dyce had already taken the tag number and notified
the Oakland County authorities, who located the owners.
Mr. Radzilowsky made no similar effort to locate owners
after he removed the tag; and had Mrs. Dyce not taken the
number, it would have been impossible ever to have brought
about the happy reunion between the seven Shorter chil-
dren and their pet.

The Veterans Administration Hospital treated Thunder
kindly and released him promptly to his owners. He was
examined by a member of the Scientific Committee of the
AWI, Richard Pearce, D.V.M., and found to be recover-
ing well from the experimental surgery he had undergone.
He is now in good health at the home of his owners.

* If P. L. 89-544 had been in effect at the time the dog was
acquired by the dealer, he would have had to identify the dog
with a United States Department of Agricultu;g,,ta.g-.and would
have had to record his identity on a U.“ ”INA. form. "

TENNESSEE LAW ”\TO PROTECT DOGS
AND CATS SOLD FOR RESEARCH

Tennessee is the fourth state to pass legislation regulat-
ing the sale, transportation and handling of research dogs
and cats. The bill passed the Tennessee Senate by a vote of
28-0 on May 18th and went into effect ”July first. Pres:-
Scz'mz'tar staff writer, Kay Pittman Black, whose reports on
dog dealers shocked thousands of readers, Senator Joe Pip-
kin and Representative Elbert Gill, sponsors of the legisla-
tion, and the Memphis Humane Society which worked
actively for its passage, combined to achieve this rapid suc-
cess. The Hargrove case, initiated by Laboratory Animal
Consultant Dorothy Dyce of the Animal Welfare Institute
(see Information Report Vol. 15, No. 5, November-De-
cember, 1966) showed the need for the new Tennessee
law as it did for the Federal Laboratory Animal Welfare
Act, the major provisions of which are similar.

The Tennessee law contains several additional provis-
ions, however, among which is the requirement that to be
licensed a dealer must never have been ”convicted of cru-
elty to animals or of a violation of this Act.” Action by the
State with respect to the Hargrove dog farm in Medina,
Tennessee is expected, since William and Roy Hargrove
were convicted of cruelty to animals September 2, 1966,
were fined and served jail sentences.

Because of the destructive amendment to the regulations
forced on the United States Department of Agriculture un-
der the Federal Laboratory Animal Welfare Act by Agri-
cultural Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman, Jamie L.
Whitten of Mississippi, the Hargroves have thumbed their
noses at federal law and have obtained a license under the
name of William Hargrove, Jr. The license was granted
on Hargrove’s own affidavit.

 

BILL TO STOP
WALKING HORSE CRUELTY

A bill to prevent “soreing” of Tennessee Walking Horses
was introduced for the second time in the United States
Senate on May eleventh by Senator Joseph D. Tydings
(D., Md.). Co-sponsors are Senators E. L. Bartlett (D.,
Alaska), Clifford Case (R., N.J.), Gaylord Nelson (D.,
Wis.,) Claiborne Pell (D, R..,I) Jennings Randolph (D.,
W. Va.) and Stephen Young (D, Ohio).

In introducing the bill, Senator Tydings said, ”Mr. Pres-
ident, last year the Congress acted, with my full support, to.
end unnecessary pain and mistreatment of animals used
in scientific research. In so doing, we recognized our re?
sponsibility to protect from unnecessary and cruel suffering
those creatures which cannot speak for themselves. I am
proud that we took this action. It was long‘ overdue.

“But there is another widespread problem of cruelty to ani-
mals which also requires corrective legislation. I refer to
the widespread injury of the beautiful Tennessee walking
horse in order tq alter its natural gait.

”Most of us at some time in our lives have attended a horse
show and were thrilled to see these magnificent animals
proudly prancing around a show ring. The Tennessee walk-
ing horse’s back stride is long; its front feet barely touch
the ground.

"However, unscrupulous owners and trainers of horses,
particularly Tennessee walking horses, have discovered that
if the horse’s front feet are sore he will lift them quickly
from the ground and take a long striding step. This soreing
is accomplished by use of chains or tacks on the feet, or by
applying a burning. agent to the pastern, the area just above
the hoof. These burning agents vary, but the most common
are an oxide of mercury salve known as 'creeping cream,’
and an oil of mustard mixture called 'scooting juice.’ Other
cruel techniques recently developed involve driving nails
into the feet, or injecting irritants into the sole area near
the heel. These are more difficult to detect, especially as
the trainers often then cover the wound with a pad and
place an artificial foot over that. The horse moves in ex-
treme agony, crouching on his hind feet with his head
drawn back and the ears back. Often the pain is so severe
that the horse will try to lie down: in the ring.

"The exhibitors and trainers who practice this cruelty
claim that they have to follow the practice of inducing the
'sore lick’ to win a blue ribbon, asserting that many judges
prefer the sore gait. However, these despicable practices are
condemned by responsible organizations and by some State
legislatures. The Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders’ and
Exhibitors’ Association of America officially prohibits the
soreing of Tennessee walkers for show purposes, and pub-
lished a notice, effective September ‘15, 1964, announcing
that ‘due to flagrant violations by exhibitors’ it will take
disciplinary action. The American Horse Show Association
also prohibits the showing of horses ‘equipped with arti-
ficial appliances, such as- leg chains, wires or tacks, blister-
ing or any other cruel and inhumane devices.’ But some of
the biggest shows do not belong to the American Horse
Show Association, and judges do not always follow the
show rules. .

"Last year, when I introduced my bill on this subject, the
Department of Agriculture repented unfavorably on it, be-
lieving that these abuses were limited and capable of being
handled by the horse associations. Subsequent to that re-
port, however, veterinarians from the Department visited
some of our large horse shows, and what they saw changed
their minds about the needfor this bill.

"The bill I introduce today, for myself and Senators Bart-
lett, Case, Nelson, Pell, Proxmire, Randolph, and Young
of Ohio, would prohibit the interstate shipment of horses
that have been injured for the purpose of altering their
natural gait. This cruelty has been observed at nearly every
Tennessee Walking Horse Show held 1n the United States.
My bill would effectively curb this cruelty by giving the
Secretary of: Agriculture authority to inspect Tennessee
walking horses. shipped in interstate commerce. Bedause
sored horses could not be taken to competitions outside their
State, this vicious practice would be effectively curtailed,
and hopefully, even eliminated altogether.”

The American Horse Protection Association, founded by
Mrs. Paul M. Twyne, is leading the campaign for enact-
ment of S. 1765, and inquiries may be addressed to her at:
1830 North Ode Street, Arlington, Virginia 22209.

 




FIGHT FOR FUNDS TO ENFORCE THE LABORATORY ANIMAL WELFARE ACT

The Congressional battle for funds necessary to imple-
ment the Laboratory Animal Welfare Act, P. L. 89-544, has
been the subject of editorials in newspapers throughout the
country. The story is told in The New York Timer June
27th, and the sequel, after favorable Senate action, in the

Editorial from
THE NEW YORK TIMES, TUESDAY, JUNE 27, 1967

Curbing Animal Abuse

When Congress last year passed the Laboratory Animal
Welfare Act, it reflected the nation’s determination to es-
tablish minimum standards for the care of dogs and other
animals used in medical research. But whad Congress did,
one man has now undone.

Providing animals for laboratories has become a thriving
interstate business. Many dealers trim costs by keeping ani-
mals in crowded, unsanitary conditions, transporting them
in pens too small for them to stand or turn around in and
failing to provide sufficient food, water and exercise. The
new law was intended to curb such abuses.

However, Mississippi’s Representative Whitten, chair-
man of the House Agricultural Appropriations subcommit-
tee, has succeeded in cutting the funds requested to enforce
the law in the fiscal :year beginning July 1 from $1.5 mil-
lion to a mere $300,000. This makes proper inspection of
animal dealers impossible.

Even before the present slz’ash, insufficient funds and
personal pressure from Representative Whitten prompted
the Agriculture Department to revise downward in April the
licensing standards it had promulgated only two months
earlier. Instead of granting a license to a dealer only after
inspecting his premises, the department has now agreed to
permit the dealers to license themselves by certifying that
they are in compliance with the Federal standards.

The inspection will follow when and if the funds ever
become available. Since it is more difficult to withdraw a
license once granted than it is to withhold it in the first
place, this shift in position has already complicated enforce-
ment of the law.

The members of the House as usual feebly deferred to
the whim of one of their Appropriations subcommittee
chairmen. The Senate has an obligation to repair Mr. Whit-
ten's sabotage.

THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR, IULY 26, 1967

Repair the Cruelty Loophole

The House of Representatives now has an opportunity to
repair the damage done to the Laboratory Animal Welfare
Act (PL. 89-544) when Congressman .Jamie Whitten suc-
ceeded in slashing to $300,000 the requested appropriation
of $1,500,000 for implementation. Subsequent creditable
action by the Senate has readjusted the figure to $1,200,-
000. Next inlthe order of procedure will be a conference
between the Senate and the House, to resolve differ-
ences.

The vital point is inspection of laboratories and dealers'
premises, for the purpose of controlling registrations and
licenses according to compliance or non-compliance with
the law. The Department of Agriculture, whose responsi-
bility it is to see that P.L. 89-544 is implemented, is well
organized and equipped to do an efficient job of inspec-
tion and certification. But without sufficient funds, inspeco
tion cannot be carried out. Without inspection, dealers will
continue to certify themselves as complying with the law———a
practice which will severely hamper the department in its ef-
forts to prevent a recurrence of the hideously cruel condi-
tions which made the public demand a law for the protec-
tion of laboratory animals.

PL. 89-544 was passed by an overwhelming majority in
both House and Senate. Neither body should allow its pur-
pose to be thwarted by hostile influences. The Senate-House
conference should be called promptly, and the House con-
ferees should take this opportunity to remedy Congressman
Whitten’s action by agreeing to the Senate figure of
$1,200,000.

COMMITTEE FOR CONSTRUCTIVE LABORATORY ANIMAL LEGISLATION

Dear Mr. Hamilton,

I hope you will not think me presumptuous in writing you regarding your
letter to Miss Rosalie Gordon of Good Shepherd Foundation, a reprint of
which, with her reply, she is circulating.

It is tragic isn“t it, that anti—vivisectionists rate the purity of their
ideal of abolition of all animal experimentation higher than the welfare
of laboratory animals-and the alleviation as far as possible, of their
suffering.

I believe you agree that the remarks made by Miss Gordon re: "the running
feud” between Christine Stevens and HSUS are quite unjustified as far as
HSUS is concerned. —

Miss Gordonus‘criticism of the Rogers—Javits bill shows a lamentable lack
of understanding of the problems of obtaining sufficient funds for renova—
tion and construction of animal facilities. I wish she would read the
testimony given by Dr. Shannon, Director of the Nat'l Institute of Health,
at the hearings on P. L. 89-544 before it became law. He stated the desir—
ability of making funds for animal facilities more attractive than for
other uses; and HSUS was delighted at their success in obtaining as pro-
vision in the Rogers-Javits bill, the higher matching level of 66 2/3%

over the originally specified 50%.

It is difficult to understand, too, why anti—vivisectionists apparently
ignore the provision under Section 9 of the Rogers-Javits bill for sub—
stitution of less highly organized or non-sentient models for animals.
This is the most hopeful sign on the horizon leading to abolition; yet
instead of encouraging federal law to promote this substitution, they
ignore the R—J provisions for it.

Our committee was instrumental in publicizing, in this country and Canada,
the enclosed information compiled by Promoters of Animal‘Welfare in England.
We sent their pamphlet to Anti—V Societies and humane societies throughout
the country, with requests to publicize the information. Yet Anti—V"s

show no interest in getting replacement written into federal law so that

it may be utilized to the fullest extent.

The ways of Anti—V's are strange, aren't they? And it is the laboratory
animal that pays the price for their purity of sentimento

Sincerely yours,

133 VAN NORMAN ROAD
MONTEBELLO, CALIFORNIA 90640

Dear Charlotte Parks:

Again we cross swords. Frankly, I find your brand of reasoning nothing short of weird, just as
I do the specious arguments of those who share your peculiar philosophy. I refer eSpecially to your
astonishing inference that it is the anti-vivisectionists who are responsible for,or indifferent to, the
sufferings of laboratory animals, rather than the men who are inflicting the sufferings.

I also challenge your assumption that there is any such species as a ”laboratory animal.” A
laboratory animal is only one who has had the misfortune to fall into the hands of a medical experi-
menter and been deprived of that freedom from abuse or exploitation which is the animal’s inherent
right no less than it is yours or mine. From any ethical standpoint this right cannot be argued or

denied.
You are further mistaken in accusing us of putting the purity of our ideal of abolition above the

welfare of the animals. We have contended, and sufficiently proved to any reasoning person, that
the Rogers-Javits bill, as well as its predecessor bills, will do nothing to alleviate the sufferings
of animals in laboratory experiments, but instead will legalize and help perpetuate a vicious and
criminal practice. The bill hardly even makes a pretense that it will do otherwise, giving nothing
more than superficial lip service to any humane goal.

I may. as you charge, show ”a lamentable lack of understanding" of certain phases of the bill.
But I do have a fair understanding of the English language. And when the bill baldly states that
anesthesia Shall be employed “except when the use of'such anesthesia will defeat the purposegf
the experiment,” I believe it means exactly what it says. How do you interpret these words? Would
you like to base your right to protection from abuse or suffering on—a—s—imilarly worded bill of rights?

Clarence Richard of the National Anti-Vivisection Society summed it up decisively when he
stated: ”If the most horrible torture that the minds of men can conceive is "necessary” for a vivi-
sector to get the result he is seeking, he can set aside the regulations. Therefore, in this respect,
the proposed law is nothing but a sham.” Do you need a better reason than this to oppose the bill?

You are likewise in error when you charge that anti-vivisectionists ”ignore the provisions under
Section 9 of the Rogers-Javits bill for substitution of less highly organized or nonsentient models
for animals.” There is no such provision in the bill. Section 8 contains a halfhearted recommenda-
tion for”selecting the least sensitive or nonsentient biological models commensurate with particular
experimental purposes.” This is far from being a ”provision” of the bill or the putting of such a
goal into practice. With the multi-millions planned for the construction and expansion of animal re-
search facilities--with still more millions earmarked for "development of instruments” (the notori-
ous Noble-Collip Drum being a typical example of such an instrument)--can you really. believe all
this will be swept into the discard to substitute a ”non-sentient biological model?”

Yes, indeed, we are profoundly interested in having such ”replacement" written into Federal
law, and would support any legitimate measure to that effect whole-heartedly. To that end we are
united solidly behind the admirable efforts of Miss Eleanor Seiling of United Action For Animals,
whose masterly summary of the Rogers-Javits bill I recommend for your study, along with the out-
standing analysis written by Clarence Richard. There is no refuting the judgment of Miss Seiling
that "the Rogers-Javits bill represents one of the most diabolical attempts ever tried to cover up
what is happening to laboratory animals.” As Miss Seiling further pointed out, the "Financial As-
sistance” clause of this bill, which would make Federal funds available for the development of
”animal colonies,” "more efficient biological models” and “development of instruments” would
result in the waste of still more millions of dollars and the further squandering of public funds.

But since we are more concerned with 'moral considerations than financial waste, I refer you to
one experiment, picked at random, among the numerous examples cited in UAA Report. It is that of

 

_2_




a little monkey on a grid floor, "pushing levers desperately to avoid electric shock.” Jolting their
animal victims with electric shocks is as you know one of the more common pastimes with which
scientific men engage themselves. I don’t know about you, but we who oppose these merciless
practices could more easily receive these terrifying jolts of electricity into our own bodies than live
with the haunting knowledge of this little monkey’s desperate efforts to avoid the punishment it had
done nothing to deserve. Do you contend that such heartless episodes as this will cease if you pass
the Rogers-Javits bill? Isn’t it obvious the vivisectors will claim this type of experiment is una-
voidable as from it they will learn something about the problems of human behavior--the human be-
havior of vivisectors, at least? If they consider such torment "necessary” are you going to con-
vince them it is unnecessary or that they can learn as much from a ”non-sentient biological model?”

HSUS, which proudly acknowledges its role in sponsoring the Rogers-Javits bill, presents an
excellent case for the unspeakable tortures involved in animal experimentation. They refer to the
”extreme agony” suffered by many, stating, "Animals are scalded, beaten, and burned so that their
reactions may be studied until they die. Millions of research animals every year die slow and miser-
able deaths of laboratory-inflicted poison, irradiation, cancer, exotic surgery, disease . . . ” etc. They
rightly point out that the ”petnapping” act, P. L. 89-544, Signed into law with such a flourish, ”can
dgwnothingtohelp the monkey‘strapped in a chair while suffering hundreds of electric shocks. it can
do nothing for the animals that are burned or beaten until they dieiof shock or internal injuries,"’etc.,
etc. Yet the HSUS answer to these hideous crimes against creation is to urge the passage of the
farcical Rogers-Javits bill. They further make the astounding assertion, "In fact, this legislation
would be'welcomed wholeheartedly by many excellent researchers who, themselves, deplore current
cruelty to animals in laboratories and would welcome pressure on their less reputable colleagues
who are abusing animals.” Their less reputable colleagues? Indeed, you can search through the
medical journals and pour over laboratory experimental records, but I defy you to distinguish the
”less reputable colleagues” from their "more reputable colleagues.” Where would you draw the line
of demarcation between the two? Is it by their reputation and prominence in their fields? By the
amount of subsidy our government deems them worthy of receiving from the public funds?

What about Dr. Maurice B. Visscher, President of the National Society for Medical Research,
who testified, ,“Kindness to animals is the rule in all laboratories,” a testimony which seems to be
refuted by the investigations of HSUS. Among other atrocities committed by Dr. Visscher was the
experiment of SLOWLY CHOKING DOGS TO DEATH BY lNTERRUPTlNG AIR FLOW TO THE
LUNGS AND BY lNGESTlON OF SALT WATER. ls Dr. Visscher one of the "excellent researchers”
referred to by HSUS or one of the ”less reputable colleagues?”

In Visscher’s University of Minnesota, Dr. Owen Wangensteen, who is being presently glorified
the world over as the man who trained the heart-transplant doctors, experimented on 60 dogs in one
”scientific procedure” by tying off the ends of their stomachs so that nothing could get through into
the intestines. The results: violent vomiting and ruptured esophagus, which even a non-scientist
could have predicted. In this same reputable university hundreds of gentle animals have been beaten
to death in a Noble-Collip Drum, their front and hind legs taped together so the animals couldn’t
break the fall, resulting in scrambled intestines, ruptured lungs, hearts, livers and spleens, teeth
knocked out, bones broken, etc. Are Dr. Wangensteen and the other perpetrators of these experiments
"excellent researchers” or among the "less reputable colleagues?”

 

Let’s consider Dr. Lester Dragstedt, past President of National Society for Medical Research,
who said on a National Broadcasting program, “All animals used for medical research are completely
anesthetized.” Some of Dr. Dragsted’s experiments consisted of cutting the stomachs of dogs into
two, three or five pieces so that all digestive juices could be drained to the outside of the body.
Irritating substances were put into these pouches to cause inflammation, ulcers and hemorrhaging.
After the dogs had their stomachs mutilated and made into different kinds of pouches, to quote the
doctor, ”The dogs were prepared with severe burns over the entire abdomen, chest and thighs with
a hot soldering iron,” resulting in "extensive third degree burns covering 30 to 40% of the body sur-

face,” after which the stomach secretions were again drained from tubes. Not surprisingly, some
dogs died in a short time--others lingered longer. Dr. Dragstedt wanted to use monkeys also, but
found them hard to manage when it came 'to stomach pouches and collectiong gastric secretions."The
monkey,” he said, "is a disagreeable sanimal to work with." In other words, he preferred, as do most '
vivisectors, to use the trusting, docile dogs. Other experimenters have also mentioned the coopera-
tive nature of dogs, Again I ask, is Dr. Dragstedt one of the ”more reputable scientists” or one of
the less reputable ones?

Dr. Hans Selye, another "reputable researcher" has replaced the notorious Russian vivisector
Pavlov in subjecting animals to "stress” experiments, which includes poisoning them, crushing their
limbs, exposing them to extremes of heat and cold, breaking their legs, forcing them to swim to er
haustion, taping their paws together to prevent their climbing and placing them in revolving drums,
subjecting them continuously to screeching sirens, and scores of similar procedures. The high regard
in which Dr. Selye is held by the scientific world and our own government is evidenced by the fact
that up to 1963 the Federal Grants he received from the National Institute of Health to conduct these
experiments totalled $728,926. Does this make him ”reputable" enough?

And in all the world today there is no more honored scientist than Dr. Christiaan Barnard of
heart-transplant fame, feted by all heads of state from the president to the pope. Wouldn’t HSUS con-
sider him eminently reputable? Yet biographical notes inform us that in 1960 Dr. Barnard duplicated
a Russion feat by transplanting a second head onto a dog. When this ”feat” was first performed by
vivisectors in Communist Russia the whole world expressed its horror at such senseless brutality.
Was it less brutal and meaningless when performed by vivisector Barnard? Dr. Barnard is at present
savoring all the highest honors that this world can bestow. Let him rejoice in the world’s accolades
over his unnatural deeds while he may. They cannot compensate for the fate that awaits him when
he has passed over and learns that the law of Divine retribution is sure and unfailing for those who
violate God’s law of mercy and justice for all His creatures. Be sure that the animals he has tor-
tured will be there to bear witness against him. *

I could continue detailing these hideous experiments without ever running out of excerpts to
quote, multiplying horror upon horror. My only object in quoting them is to demonstrate that there is
no distinction between the "excellent researchers” and "their less reputable colleagues.” A reput-
able vivisector is as wholly contradictory as an honest thief. Can anyone honestly oppose cruelty
to animals and still pay tribute to the materialistic god ”Science?" Far more accurate is Robert G.
Ingersoll’s definition of vivisection when he said, “All the cruelty which the human, or rather the
inhuman heart is capable of inﬂicting, is in this one word. Below this there is no depth.”

If all decent and clear-thinking people who believe this would join forces to demand that the
crime of vivisection be outlawed, rather than regulated, the impact of such united action would be
felt around the world. Eventually such action must come, for to paraphrase Lincoln’s statement on
slavery: ”If vivisection is not wrong then nothing is wrong.”

l?th.Annual Report of the president of The.Animal Protective League, Inc.
October 1952 - to September 30th 1953 —

This past year has been a very active one for the League. We have engaged in a
varied program ~ carried out at minimum expense — and one which produced a maximum
in the field of humane education and direct service to the welfare of animals.

In October we contributed $h00.00 to the American Fondouk at Fez, Morroco ~ in
accordance with the unanimous consent of all members present at our 1952 annual
meeting. _

We engaged in and contributed a considerable sum toward the direct relief of ani-
mals - such as donations of canned food where excellent work for animals is being
done - payment of Veterinarian services for injured animals where worthy persons
were unable to pay for the care 'o‘f their injured animal - the cost of build.ing a
large dog house for three dogs at a trailer camp in South Milwaukee, and numerous
other acts of direct aid to animals lost or injured on the highway. It was through
the direct efforts of Marjorie Flegel that we were able to provide the dog house.

We compiled and printed a pamphlet against rabies inoculation, and distributed
5,000 of these. According to the Milwaukee Sentinel it was the plan of the State
Dept. of.Agriculture to introduce a billtfor/the compulsory inoculation of all dogs
against rabies. After the distribution of our pamphlets a bill was finally intro—
duced, but not in its originally proposed drastic form. The bill introduced pro-
vided that all dogs vaccinated against rabies.be exempt from any state or local
quarantine that might be imposed for the control of rabies. This bill had.wide
support among hunters ~ especially around Eau Claire. There were thousands of let-
ters sent in to the legislature by our members and friends opposing this bill —

At the hearing, only myself and.Mrs. Bergheger of Madison appeared against the bill.
The State Dept. of Agriculture had a new forty'minute sound movie to support the
claims for inoculation. The bill passed both houses and was signed by the Governor.

We supported a bill to regulate the sale and purchase of unpedigreed dogs and cats.
This bill failed to pass due to the various amendments which were attached to it
by the Senate.

In.April we had an exhibit booth at the Wisconsin Kennel Club Dog Show - held in
the Milwaukee.Arena, at which we distributed over 2,000 pamphlets on vivisection
and over one thousand copies of "Living Tissue”.

In May we sent to the Indian Parliament 500 pamphlets on vivisection - lb copies

of the book ~ WHY VIVISECTION — and some rare and excellent pamphlets and photo-
graphs on the importation of, and the use of, monkeys for vivisection. This mat—
erial was sent at the request of Dr. Kapur, of the India Society for the Protec—
tion of Animals in London, England, and also.at the request of Rukmini Devi.Arundale,
of Madras, India — member of Parliament and at whose request a bill has been intro-
duCed in the Indian Parliament forbidding vivisection of animals in India and for—
bidding the exportation of monkeys to the U. S.

On May 15th we held.our Annual Spring Meeting at which we sponsored the premier
Wisconsin showing of that most remarkable film on the steel~trapping of furbearing
animals - produced in color and sound ~ for Defenders of Furbearers, washington,
D.C. Immediately following the meeting I took the film "TRAPLINES" to Madison in
an effort to aid the passage of 2hOeA - a bill compelling trappers to inspect their
traps every 2h hours. This bill had three times been defeated in the.Assembly and
it seemed hopeless to bring it up again. The film was shown for me by the Dept.

of Conservation to 25 legislators — within a few days the bill was again brought
up for reconsideration and passed the Assembly by'a majority of seven votes. It
immediately passed the Senate by a voice vote.

 




-2...

I wish to quote here a letter sent to me under date of June 10th, 1953 — by
Senator Raymond C. Bice - the sponsor of the bill.

"Dear Mrs. Thompson:

I am happy to inform you that Bill No. 2h0~A finally
passed the Senate on Friday, June 8th. I asked that it be immediately
messaged to the Governor for his signature.

There is only one thing left that could happen to
the bill, and that is the Governor's veto. I am.sure the Governor
will sign this bill, but I am going to consult with him before I
leave Madison this week and try to determine how he feels about this
bill.

I wish to take this opportunity to thank you and
your group for the splendid support you gave me in one of the great-
est battles of this session. Without your help throughout the
session this bill would have met defeat.

Sincerely yours,

(signed) R. C. Bios,
Senator, 32nd District."

We supplied Senator Bice with the finest descriptive pamphlets with photographs,
etc. for each.member of the legislature ~ all sent to us by Defenders of Fur—
bearers ~ and these were placed on the desks of the legislators by Sen. Bice him-
self the morning on which the bill came up. Assemblyman Ludvigsen, of Hartland,
did wonderful work for the final passage of the bill in the Assembly. He was es-
pecially impressed by the picture ~ TRAPLINES. In a letter to me, June 8th he
said: "I am quite sure that the opponents of the bill were thinking more of the
convenience of the trapper than they were of the prolonged suffering of the four-
footed creatures caught in their traps."

.After all of our hard.work and our joy over what seemed certain victory, Governor
Kohler vetoed the bill on the grounds that the state did not have the means to en-
force the bill and that it might cause hardships to the trappers in severe storms,
and that the State would not grant the Conservation Department any additional sum
for the enforcement of this bill. Both we, and Defenders of Furbearers were
utterly and completely shocked at the veto.

On July 22nd I showed the film TRAPLINES and gave a short talk before a group of
state conservation teachers taking a summer course at Wisconsin State Teachers
College. This was so well received that I have been requested to repeat the film
and the talk before two more classes on conservation during the Fall term at State
Teachers College.

we have just completed.mailing 5500 pamphlets and letters to ministers and.religious
leaders throughout the U. S. in an effort to gain their support in the observation
of World Day for.Animals — October hth ~ imploring them to speak in behalf of the
animals and to aid in the establishment of more humane consideration and treatment
of all animals.

On August 10th we presented Mr. Geoffrey Hodson, of New Zealand — in a public lec-
ture at the Pfister Hotel ~ Mr. Hodson, a writer aid lecturer and humantarian of
world-wide fame gave a remarkable and most inspiring lecture on the EXTREME URGENCY
OF THE HUMANITARIAN CAUSE.

 




-3-

Our plansfkm'the coming two years is to increase our program of humane education —
take advantage of every opportunity to show TRAPLINES, and to co-operate with
DEFENDERS of FURBEARERS in promoting and sponsoring an antiusteel trap bill in

the 1955 Wisconsin Legislature.

Remember that ours is a humane educational society — that is the primary object
of our society.

Increased education will do more than any other means to promote individual active
humane consideration for all animals.
