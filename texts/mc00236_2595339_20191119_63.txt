~ 3 o necessity. I do not Wish to discover what things are
necessary; but ‘what that predicate 18 which attaches to
“ them when they are so. Nor, on the other hand, do I wish
to arrive at a correct verbal deﬁnition of necessity. That
the word is commonly used to signify a great number of
different predicates, which do. actually attach to things, .
appears to me quite plain. But, this being so, we shall
be using the word correctly, whenever we apply it to any
one of these; and a correct deﬁnition of necessity will
attained, if we enumerate all those diﬁerent predicates which
the word is commonly used to signify : for the only test that
a word is correctly deﬁned is common usage. The problem
which I wish to solve is diﬁerent from either of these. It is
a problem which resembles them in its universal application.
There is a solution of it not only for necessity but for every?
thing that we can think of; and in many cases the discovery
of this solution appears to me to be of fundamental import-T“
ance for philosophy. The nature of this problem may perhaps
be exhibited as follows: When a man says ‘ A is necessary ’
or ‘ red ' or ‘ round ’ or ‘loud ’ or, whatever it may be, he may
be wrong in three ways. (1) He may be using the word .5
‘ necessary’ in a sense in which it is not commonly used.
For instance the thought which he intends to convey may be
that ‘ A is red’; and then, whether A is red or not, he is
committing a verbal error in saying that ‘A is necessary '. l g ’.

(2) He may be using ‘ necessary ’ in one of the many senses
in which other people use it, but he may be mistaken in
supposing that A really has the predicate, which he rightly
denotes by that word. (3) He may both be using the word-
correctly and also be right insupposing that A has one of the
predicates which ‘ necessary ’ commonly signiﬁes F and yet
he may be wrong in a different way. For While rightly
thinking that it has one of these predicates he may be
mistaken in supposing that it also has some other of them.
That ‘ A is necessary’ we must grant him to be both verbally
and substantially correct ; and again that ‘ B is necessary ’ :
and yet in so far as he includes with that predicate which A.
really has the predicate which B really has, his statement
that ‘ A is necessary” may be very incorrect. All this is
obvious enough, and such confusions have been fully recogz
nised as a frequent source of fallacy in reasoning. What
wish to point out is that this mistake is not a mistake about
the meaning of a word, nor yet about a question of fact. The
question which we must answer in order to decide whether a
man is mistaken in this way is quite different from either of
the two questions : Is he using this word correctly ‘2 or Has
the thing in question that predicate ? For there may be no
doubt at all that we should answer Yes or No to either of these
questions ; and yet there may be much doubt as to what the
predicate in question is. While never doubting that certain
things have certain predicates, and that all these predicates
are commonly signiﬁed by the same word, we yet may be in
doubt whether there is anything in common between these
various predicates and, if so, what. We ma be right on both
the former points and yet be wrong on this. . This, then, is
the question which I intend to raise, in asking what is the
meaning of necessity. My main object is not to discover
whether any or all propositions of the form ‘ A is necessary ’
are true or false, nor yet whether they are correctly expressed ;
but what their W is. .

C} i But, though this question is the one I mainly want to
answer, I see no means of reaching my conclusion except by
a partial discussion of both the others. Their relation to it
is indeed peculiar. Logically it is presupposed in both of
them : fer ‘ A is necessary’ is not true or false, unless it have
some definite meaning ; and, if the word ‘ necessary ’. is
usually applied to certain predicates, it is predicates With
some deﬁmte meaning to which it is usually applied. We
might then be tempted to say : We must know exactly what

knowledge of what we are talking about will often lead us to
see that what we had thought true of it is false. But the
order of discovery is generally just the reverse of this. We
must have judged correctly that certain collections of objects
were three in number many times over, before we could know
exactly what three was. And so here I must examine the
cases in which things are said to be necessary, before I can
discover what necessity is.

(If? ( Now it would appear there are three classes of entity which

are commonly called necessary. We may call a connexion
necessary, or we may call a thing necessary, or we may call
a proposition necessary. And there is at least one pro

which may be common to all these three. All three of them
may be forced upon the mind. We may have the feelin of
compulsion with regard to them. We may feel compelled
to believe that two objects have a certain relation, or that a
certain thing exists, or that a certain pr0position is true.
But this feeling of compulsion, though it may probably have

been the origin of all our ideas of necessity, has certain prof

perties which prevent us from identifying it with them.
For it accompanies different beliefs at diﬂerent times and in
different persons. If we were to say that a necessary truth

is one, belief in which is accompanied by a feeling of come”

pulsion, we should have to admit that the same truth was
necessary at one time and unnecessary at another, and even
that the same truth might be simultaneously both necessary
and unnecessary. But it is certain that necessary is often

used in a sense which would exclude this possibility. Neces?

sary truths, it would be said, are truths which are always
necessary: and whether there are any such or not, we
certainly mean by them something different from truths,
belief in which is sometimes accompanied by a feeling of
compulsion. Nor can it be said we only mean such truths
as are wally accompanied by such a feeling. For the
truths which are most commonly regarded as necessary do
not now generally excite any such feeling when we believe in
them. A belief in the truths of arithmetic, for example, has
now become so habitual, that we obtain it with the greatest
ease. And, if it be said that these beliefs are nevertheless
all of such a nature that they would generally excite the
feeling of compulsion, if we tried. to believe the opposite, it
may be admitted that this is true. Probably in most cases
we should ﬁnd it difﬁcult to believe the opposite of those
truths which we call necessary. They would force themselves
upon us in spite of our efforts. But there is no reason to

believe that any truths have this property gladly. It :2".

“£9?“ 61““22110033

would be a bold assertion that no one ever had believed or
would believe with ease that two and two make ﬁve. And
it the statement be- general only and um universal, it would
apply to many more truths than are commonly thought to
be necessary, as, for instance, to the existence of the sun
and of the earth. It can scarcely be maintained that such
facts have failed to be called necessary, solely because it was
not perceived that their opposites were hard to believe. The
most plausible way, then, in which it might be attempted; to
show that the meaning of necessity always involved a refer?“
ence to the feeling of compulsion, fails at least to cover the
distinction between necessary and existential truths. The
most plausible expression of this theory would take the form:
That 18 always necessary, belief in which would generally
excite a feeling of compulsion, if we tried to believe its
Opposite. And this deﬁnition of necessity, while it is doubt?
ful even whether it would apply to most cases of supposed
necessary truths, certainly fails in that it will apply to many“
others as well. 4
It seems questionable how far this feeling of compulsion is
to be identiﬁed with the impression from which Hume sought
to derive the idea of necessity. But his account of how we
come to think events necessarily connected certainly implies
quite a diﬁerent meaning of necessity, which must be care?
fully distinguished from this. What he says is that when a
succession of two events has been repeated often enough, the
mind has a habit of reproducing the idea of the second on
the occurrence of the impression of the ﬁrst. He does not
seem to maintain that it [glgcom to have the_idea of
the second event., But unless he does mean this, where is
the impression of necessity for which he was seeking ? Either
he must mean that there are constant successions among
mental events just as there are among physical; but in that
case. it would seem that the succession in the mind can give
rise to no idea different from that to which the hysical
succession might .of itself give rise. Necessity in t is case
means merely constant succession, and Hume’s reference
to the habits of the mind is quite superﬂuous. Or else he
means that the mental habit does actually compel us to
think of the second event on occurrence of the ﬁrst. 'But
in this case he is illegitimately transferring to the contents
of the mind that very idea of necessary connexion which he
is seeking to deny to physical events. For, on his own
showing, we have no title to say anything more of mental
contents than that they do succeed one another in certain

ﬁxed sequences. His question is: What is the meaning of [33:53;

events that are thus related and two ideas that have the
relation of similarity. In so far as he appeals to this diﬁ'er-
ence he may be taken as allowing that there is an idea of
necessary connexion which is not identical with that of
constant succession; and this idea may be that which we
assert of a cause and its effect, whether it really does apply
to them or not. Only by his denial that this is the case-‘7 ’ “
by his assertion that there is nothing in common between
the idea of a necessary truth and the idea of a causal
connexion-#does Hume really contribute anything to the
question what the latter means

<17: .jWe have it, then, suggested that there are two forms of
connexion commonly called necessary, and that there is
nothing in common between these two ; and this View seems
still to be held by those who oppose a ‘ real ’ to an ‘ideal’
necessity. In order to decide whether it be a true view, it
will be necessary to discuss at some length each of these
two forms of necessity, which are at ﬁrst sight so different:
%—the necessity of necessary truths and the necessity of real
causes.

'-’ " , Now the line which Kant took in answering Hume was
based, in part at least, on a denial that they were so different
as Hume had thought. Kant pointed out that truths, which
Hume had allowed to be necessary, on the ground that they
were analytic, were, like the relation of cause and eﬁect,
synthetic. The truths of arithmetic were both synthetic
and necessary, and, if Hume had considered this, it would
have destroyed his reason for allowing no common element
between ideal and real necessity. Kant, however, does still
allow that there are such things as analytic truths, and that
they are necessary. Though, therefore, he classes together,
as having a common element, two forms of necessity, which
Hume had separated, he still allows another form, which
may or may not be different in meaning from this. He does
not decide the question: In what sense are analytic truths
necessary? Now, if we take the view that the sense is
different from that in which synthetic truths are necessary,
there would seem to be two alternatives open. Either (1)
it may be said that ‘ necessary ’ here merely means ‘ analytic ’ ;
that the two conce tions are identical. In this case it be?“
comes an analytical truth that analytical truths are necesl?‘
sary; and no exception can be taken to the separation of
this meaning of necessity from all others, if only there be
any meaning in analytic truths. But, at the same time, this
necessity becomes utterly unimportant. It is impossible to

draw from it any inferences with regard to the truths that [54“: '

asserted of it on the ground of a synthetic truth. But if (2)
we say that the necessity of analytic truths is not identical
with their being analytic, then that they are necessary is a
synthetic preposition. And only, while this synthetic proposi-i"
tion is necessary, can any analytic proposition be so. Even,
then, if there be some special necessity attaching to analytic

propositions it is secondary to that which attaches to some
kinds of synthesis.

€777 {But there is much doubt whether any truths are analytic.

Any proposition, it would seem, must contain at least two
different terms and their relation; and, this being so,
the relation may always be denied of- the two terms with?“
out a contradiction. It takes two propositions to make a
contradiction: the law of contradiction itself excludes the
possibility of any single pr0position being both true and
false, or self-contradictory. And hence the deﬁnition of an
analytic proposition as a proposition, the contradictory of
which is self-contradictory can apply to nothing. If, on
the other hand, we take the deﬁnition that it is a proposition
of which the predicate is contained in the subject, then either
its meaning is that that predicate is united in some way with
the other predicates, which-along with it deﬁne the subject:
in which case the analytic proposition is as synthetic as you
please; or else the predicate is simply identical with the
subject. But in this latter case, where the supposed analytic
proposition may be expressed in the form, A is A, we have
certainly not two different terms, and therefore we have no
proposition.

(,2 ; Moreover, the law of contradiction itself, than which

nothing is commonly supposed to be more plainly analytic,
is certainly synthetic. For suppose some one to hold that
N ot every proposition is either true or false. You cannot
deny that this is a proposition, unless you are also willing
to allow that the law which it contradicts is not a proposition ;
and he may perfectly well maintain that this is one of those
propositions which is true, and the contradictory of which,
your law, is false, although this is not the case with every
preposition. Whereas, if you urge that it is included in the
notion of a proposition that it should be either true or false,
either your law becomes a pure tautology and not a pro ”‘
sition, or else there is something else in the notion o a
proposition beside the property that it is either true or false,
and then you are asserting a synthetic connexion between
this property and those others.

..~.. We may, then, safely assume that there is no such thing
as a special necessity belonging to analytic truths, because
there are no analytic truths. But I do not wish to deny
that the law of contradiction is necessary. Nothing would
generally be thought to be more certain or more necessary
than this; and hence it will be a particularly good instance

in which to examine what may be meant by calling a syn?

thetic truth necessary.

What then is the necessity which attaches to the law
of contradiction?

Now there are several other predicates which have been
or are commonly associated with necessity as belonging to
truths like this: eternity, for instance, absolute certainty,
and universality. It may, then, turn out that necessity is
identical with some one of these or with the combination of
them all. If, on the other hand, we ﬁnd it impossible to
identify necessity with them, there will be some probability
that any remaining property which may belong to the truths
in question will be that which is meant by their necessity.

First, then, to consider eternity. If by this he meant that
the truths in question are true at every moment of time,
it cannot be a mark which distinguishes necessary from any
other kind of truths. For, universally, what is once true, is
always true. Every truth is true at every moment of time;
whereas, when we talk of necessary truths, we certainly
mean that only some truths are necessary and that others
are not. That every truth is true at every moment of time
has not indeed been universally perceived ; but it needs no
long discussion to show that it is so. Truths which have
been supposed to be exceptions are such as assert that so
and so exists now, whereas it did not exist in the past or
will not exist in the future; and it must, of course, be
admitted that things do exist now, which neither have
always existed nor will always exist. But the amt, is not
the ﬂying; the truth is that the thing existed at some moment
of time, which we designate conveniently as present or past
or future, because we thereby point out its temporal relation
to another existing thing, namely our perception of the
truth. That Caasar was killed on the Idea of March, to take
Hume’s example, if only it be true, was, is, and will be
always true: no one will deny this. And it is also true that
that particular date was the present once and is not the
present now ; and these propositions also are eternal truths.
For by ‘now ' nothing more is meant than a particular date,

which we all can distinguish from other dates in the objecﬂm ‘
tive time‘series, by the fact that the perceptions which fall Lii‘ﬁi

‘11” But if, on the other hand, by ‘ eternal ’ truths be meant

truths which are true at no moment of time, then it would
seem that in the same sense all truths are true at no moment
of time. This is, indeed, only a more accurate way of
expressing that same pr0perty of truths, which is popularly
expressed by saying that they are always true. For a truth
is not to be regarded in the same way either as a particular
conﬁguration of matter which may exist at one moment and .
cease to exist at the next, nor yet as matter itself, when it
is conceived to exist at every moment. The truth that some;
thing exists, it would seem, never does exist itself, and hence
cannot be accurately said to occupy any moment of time.
Accurately we should express that eternity, which is the
property of all truths, by the negative statement that they
are incapable of change, without thereby implying that they
are capable of duration.

i Eternity, then, will not distinguish the Law of Contra?

diction from any other truth; and yet we should be uni?
willing to say that it was not necessary in a sense in which
some other truths may be distinguished from it. Perhaps,
absolute certainty will furnish this distinguishing mark.

<2} 1, Now if absolute certainty be understood in a psychological

sense, it will not furnish a universal mark. That we are
more certain of the Law of Contradiction than of any other
truth, I will admit, though it would be difﬁcult to prove it.
But then it must be admitted, on the other side, that there
was a time in the history of the race when men were very
certain of many, particularly the most contingent, truths,
before they had even thought of the Law of Contradiction ;
when, therefore, they could not be certain of it at all. It is,
indeed, remarkable that all the truths, which we now con?
sider particularly necessary, are so abstract that we cannot
suppose them to have been thought of or believed in till after
many other truths had enjoyed a long lease of certainty.
That necessary truths are, then, universally more certain
than others, cannot be maintained; and if it be said that
nevertheless, as soon as both are thought of, the necessary
ones become at once more certain, or that they are capable
of .greater certainty, it is fair to suspect that this is said on
the a '__ ' ground that, since they are more necessary, they
must E5 niore certain. Empirical evidence of it is certainly

not forthcoming. Yet no one would hesitate to say, for the
lack of this, that necessary truths do diﬂ'er from others. It y M,
would seem, then, that certainty, in any psychological sense, 1 ". " f

can not be that which makes a necessary truth what i—t is.
If certainty be used in any other sense, it may be discussed
more conveniently, after we have considered universality. A
’55:“! The universal certainly. would seem a more likely candié
date, than either of the others, for the honour of identiﬁcaf"

tion with the necessary. They have been ranked together

by Kant as joint marks of the ”a“ But here again it is
necessary to make a distinction of meaning. For, in the

ﬁrst place, a truth may be said to be universal, in the sense

already considered as meant by eternal, namely that it is

always true. This, we found, would not serve to distinguish 2
any one truth from any other. We must, then, ﬁnd some

other meaning for universality if it is to be identiﬁed with
necessity. And we have obviously got a universality of some

sort, which is not this, in the Law of Contradiction. For

it asserts that every pr0position is either true or false ; and
inasmuch as it thus applies to every instance of the class

‘ preposition ’ it may be said to be universal. But this
suggests a distinction which is not without importance. For

what is true of every proposition is that 354 is true or false ;

it is not true of any proposition that every roposition is “

true or false ; but it is this latter which is said) to be neceS; ‘

sary. The necessary, therefore, is not universal in the sense

of being a property common to all the instances of a certain

kind. If, then, we are to say that necessity is connected

with universality, we must say it in the sense that every
necessary proposition is one which asserts that some property .r g .
is to be found in every instance in which some other property “" '
is found. But is this true of all necessary pmpositions ? It J 5i;

assert nothing about a number of instances. There are not
several instances of 5 and of 7; there is but one 5, one 7
and one 12. And yet we assert a connexion between them
which is commonly held to be necessary. It is indeed true
of every collection of things which number ﬁve that, if you
add to them a collection which numbers seven, the whole
collection will number twelve. But different collections of
ﬁve things, are not diﬁerent ﬁves; and though a proposition
about collections of ﬁve things may be universal in the sense
in which the Law of Contradiction is universal, that is no
evidence that a prOposition about ﬁve itself is so. It is not,
then, true that every reposition about a universal is a
universal proposition. Pfor every number is a universal in

numbers makes no assertion about a number of instances.
It has indeed been suggested that propositions such as the
Law of Contradiction might be more properly expressed in
a form analogous to arithmetical propositions; that we
should say, not: Every proposition is either true or false;
but: Proposition is either true or false, just as we say:
Man is mortal. But there seems reason to suspect that
these propositions are really universal in a sense in which
arithmetical propositions are not so, and that ‘proposition ’
is not a property of propositions in the same sense in which
any number is a property of the collection of which it is predié"
cated. For even granted that ‘ Man is mortal ’ has a mean?"
ing, how can we get from this to the proposition ‘All men

”6 mm“? except by adding that the property of mortality p: ’

is 913993;: connected. with the other properties of humanity,
wherever these latter occur ? Whereas from the pr0position
that 75+; 5 ‘,=, 12, you can arrive at the conclusion that all
collections of ﬁve and seven are equal to collections of twelve,
without the premise that 7 + 5 7"".12' wherever they occur;
for the reason, which seems to be true though it will hardly
be thought convincing, that 5 and 7 never do occur. For
myself, I cannot perceive that ‘Man is mortal' has any
meaning at all except that ‘ Man is ,9114’9113 mortal’; and
similarly with the Law of Contradiction, since propositions
do not occur in time and therefore cannot be said to be
always” either true or false, the ultimate expression of it
would seem to be that 9y" prOpositions are either true or false.
5‘ " lWe must, therefore, say that some necessary propositions
are not universal in the sense that they make an assertion
about a sum of instances, whereas other necessary proposi?‘
tions are universal in this sense. This universality too,
then, will not furnish the meaning of that necessity which
belongs to necessary truths. But is there, perhaps, some
third kind of universality which is common both to the
propositions of Arithmetic and to the Law of Contradiction,
and indeed to all propositions which have a primafacie claim
to be considered necessary truths? There is, I think, a
sense in which, not indeed strict universality, but a certain
generality may be claimed for all of them. They may all be
said to be propositions of a Wide application ; and a discussion
of what exactly this wide application is will furnish my answer
to the question what is meant by that necessity which may
be truly ascribed to necessary truths. It will then only
remain to inquire what, if anything, there is in common
between this so-called ‘ideal ’ necessity and/causal or ‘ real ’
necessity. .

This generality of necessary truths is what I take Kant to
have. established in part of his diverse proofs that they are

.91.. But whereas he expressly maintains that if you
see a truth to be absolutely necessary you may infer it to be
a . , my contention is that you can but show it to be

afﬁrm, and that. you then add no new or true fact about it,
but only a new name, when you also dub it necessary. The
theory, brieﬂy stated, is this: Thatagmpriqm: means logically
prior, and that any truth which is logically prior to some
other true. proposition is so far necessary ; but, that as you
get more and more true propositions to which a given truth
is logically prior, so you approach that region within which
the given truth will be said to be absolutely necessary or

' ' There will, then, be only a difference of degree

a "a... is...“
between necessary truths and many others, namely, a differ-T“

ence in the number of propositions to which they bear a
certain logical relation; but there will be a difference of
kind between this logical relation and any other of the
notions by means of which it has been sought to give a
deﬁnition to necessity. If there be any truths which have
this legical relation to all other propositions, then, indeed,
the application of these would be not merely wide but
absolutely universal; such, it would seem, is the Law of
Contradiction and, perhaps. some others : and these, perhaps,
might be said to diifer in kind from all others in this respect
also. But into this question, which is exceedingly difﬁcult,
I do not propose to enter. It is sumcient for my purpose
that there ' are some truths. commonly called necessary,
certain axioms of geometry, for instance, which have not
this absolutely universal application, but which have a
very wide one: and that this, at least, may be said of all
necessary truths.

‘ i The logical relation, by means of which I prOpose to deﬁne

necessity, is one to which constant appeal is made in philo?‘
sophical arguments; but the appeal is almost as frequently
misused. It is said that one proposition is presupposed,
or implied, or involved in another; and this argument is
considered to be ﬁnal. And so indeed it is, if only the pro-”f
position in question is really presupposed or implied or in?
volved. It would seem, therefore, desirable that we should
be clear about what this relation, which may be designated
generally as logical priority, really'is: and such clearness is
essential to my deﬁnition of necessity. I propose, therefore,
to try to point it out, but, without attempting to assign its
exact limits, or to give an exhaustive enumeration of the

various kinds of logical relation, which may all be justly “1am ’

may all be justly

called by this one name. It needs, I think, only to be seen

in any instance, in order to be recognised. Thus when we
say: Here are two chairs, and there are two chairs, and ‘n' 5253-1"

at;

therefore, in all, there are four chairs; it would commonly
be admitted that we presuppose in our conclusion that
25,41“ 2 ~71; 4. Yet it is plain that many a man may arrive
correctly at the number of objects before him, in an enor-T
mous number of instances, without envisaging the 30-?
called , abstract propositions that 2 2+ 2 =2 4, or 3 ‘+ 1 a 4, or
1 :11 1 ;ﬁ 1 f+, 1 .‘= 4. These, therefore, 'are different proposi-
tions from those which we commonly make about four objects,
and yet they are presupposed in all of them. Similarly,

when a man says : This is white, and that is black, and there-2A

fore these are different objects; we should say be implied
that black and white are different. And this in itself is a
common enough case. But if we go farther and say: That
things which have different properties are diﬂ'erent; this is
a principle which is involved in every particular judgment
of 'diﬂerence that we make; and we should be unable to give
any reason for our judgmentthat the thin are diﬁerent,
except that this and that property, which along to them
respectively, are different. These then are cases of logical
priority, and we‘ can determine whether other supposed
cases are also of this nature, by considering whether they
are like or unlike these. And by no means all cases of
inference are of such a kind. For instance, if one says:
There has been a horse here: and we ask why; his reason
may be: See these hoof-prints. But that a horse made them
is by no means presupposed in the fact that there are hoof?“
prints there. And yet the inference may be perfectly valid :
both propositions may be true, and the one may follow from
the other. All propositions, then, are not connected by way
of logical priority ; whereas some propositions are. And
what universally marks a prior pr0position is that it may
be true, even though the particular proposition, to which it

is prior, should be false. And thus a logically prior proposi;’”‘-

tion is universally prior both to one false and to one true
proposition. And, moreover, what Kant showed is that
there are a number of propositions 10gically prior to almost
every true ‘ernpirical’ judgment that we make; and such
empirical judgments form an immense majority of all the
true propositions of which we are cognisant. They cannot
be true, unless the propositions they involve are true: but
these may be true, even if the empirical judgments are
false.

tionsmand that they approach to universality in the sense
that many of them are prior to a very great number of other
truths, will hardly be denied. And that they coincide to
a remarkable degree with the class of ‘ necessary truths ’
seems no less evident. But moreover they seem to coincide
with the class of ‘ most certain ’ propositions, in any sense of
certainty which is not psychological. For any one who is
looking for a perfectly certain proposition from which to def"
duce his system of philosophy Will in general try to show
that it is logically prior to all other propositions. We may
take as an instance the famous ‘ Qggitcaetgosam ’. Here the
conclusion that ‘I am,’ because I think, is made by way
of logical priority: and it really is logically prior. How far
Descartes used the same argument in defence of the Pm-PA
position that he thought, I am unaware: the certainty that
he primarily claimed for it is certainly a psychological one,
namely that he could not doubt it. But modern idealistic
descendants of his constantly claim superior certainty for
the ‘ gogzto' itself, on the ground that it is logically prior to
other propositions. Many will say straight out that thought
is presupposed in all existence and all truth, and will draw
the conclusion that the existence of thought is therefore the
rimary certainty. Others will say, in more popular forms:
on cannot deny that, whatever you think, it is implied that
you do think it; and therefore the ultimate certainty is that
you do think it, not that what you think is true: if you deny
that you are making a statement, it is impossible to argue
with you. Whether or not the statements Which are. thus
argued to be more certain are really logically prior, is another
question ; but it is worth while intmg out that those who
use this argument are admitting t e proposition that ‘ Logical
priority is a test of certainty’ to be at least as certain as the
proposition which they endeavour to establish by its means:
this proposition is, at all events, logically prior to their argu?
ment. -

5 And so, if we say that no proposition is necessary in itself,

but that when we call it necessary we can only mean that
it is connected in a certain way with other propositions, it
may be asked: But what of this connexion ? Is not that
necessary in itself? I should answer: Only in the same
sense as those propositions, which it makes necessary, are'

necessary. For every statement of the form: This is in?“

volved in that, is itself a proposition; and when we say: If
you admit that, you must admit this: they are necessarily
connected; we only mean: This follows from that; and the

general principle that what follows from a truth is itself true 1-5,. 1

truth of what is implied follows from the truth of that
which implies it, that is necessary. The connexion itself
is not necessary, but the truth, that if it is there, then a true
conclusion may be drawn, is necessary. It remains, then,

cause or effect of some other thing, is evident. The question
is then of that necessity which is involved in the notion of
causality. Whether there be any causesgrwhether from the
existence of; one thing'you can ever validly infer the existence
of anotherxis a diﬂerent question. But that if there be a
cause, it is’necessarily connected with its effect, and that its
effect is necessary, Will not be questioned. The question is
merely of what this necessity means. And my answer to it
is, I fear, deplorably brief. For I entirely fail to see that
there can be any relation between the two things, except
that from the proposition ‘ The one exists” there is a valid
inference to the proposition ‘ The other existed’ or ‘ will
exist ’. If it does really follow that, since one thing exists,
another has existed or will exist, what more necessary relation
can be desired ? The en posed ‘ real ’ necessity will, then,
like the supposed ‘ ideaf’ be reduced to logical necessity.
There will, indeed, be a diﬁerence. The existence of one
thing is certainly not presupposed in that of another: the
relation between them 18 certainly not that of logical priority.
If we are to infer the one from the other, it must be on the
basis of the principle that whenever it is true that one thing
exists, it is also true that some one other thing has existed
or will exist. And this principle may itself be necessary, as
logically prior to other propositions. But the particular
causal inference always requires not only this for its premise,
but also that some one thing does exist. In this, however,

 

there is no reason to dispute that the necessity is logical. ..
