From Mrs. M. E. DICKIN, O.B.E.

Founder and Hon. Director of
THE PEOPLE’S DISPENSARY
FOR SICK ANIMALS OF THE POOR;——-

To the Subscribers, Supporters,
and all Helpers of the P.D.S.A.

In gratitude to the many thousands of animal lovers
without whose support the P.D.S.A. could never have been
started, or have become the world—wide movement it is to—
day, I am giving a brief outline of what is happening among
_suffering animals in the countries where the P.D.S.A. Flag

is ﬂying to-day.

In doing so, I trust that this short record will bring some
comfort to them that wherever the P.D.S.A. is at work, the
world is a better place for the animals; and some recompense
for the part they have taken in building up the work; and
also, that they will feel that their money entrusted to us to
spend for the alleviation of animal suffering has been spent
as they would wish.

WHY THE P.D.S.A. FLAG WAS HOISTED.

In 1917, the sufferings of the animals of the Poor in our
slums and overcrowded areas became such an intolerable
burden, that it was felt that something must be done, how-
ever small, to make a beginning to remedy this vast under-
world of silent suffering.

It seemed so unfair that these dumb ones to whom we
owe so much, and whose capacity for suffering is so like our
own, should be left to endure their misery alone and unaided.
Any man, woman or child in pain can turn to the Medical
Profession, and if they cannot afford to do so, they have a
wonderful hospital service for their beneﬁt.

Animals in pain can obtain the services of the Veterinary
Surgeon if their owners can afford it. But what about the
sick animal whose owner has no money to pay for treatment?

What help was there for them, with their broken limbs,
wounds, and all the innumerable forms of suffering which
attack the various organs and nerves? The dumb, down and
out animal, who cannot tell its owner what is the matter
with it—and if it could, what could its owner do?

11

 

 

 

 

 




Something ought to be done, I thought. And, surely,
Life teaches us that when something ought to be done about
anything, it is of no use to wait for somebody else to do
something; the only solution is to do it—no matter in how
humble a way. And so, a cellar in the East End of London
was very kindly lent to me, and having engaged the services of a
well—known practitioner of long experience, the P.D.S.A.
began its work in this modest way.

It can therefore be said that the P.D.S.A. Flag was
hoisted in 1917 as a symbol 'of Justice for suffering unable
to voice its pain. ' ' »

OUR CARAVAN DISPENSARIES are known in nearly
every part of England, for they have worked in slums, crowded

‘ - -‘ towns and countryside. Ship—building centres, docklands, factory

 

and manufacturing areas, colliery and mining districts, have all
' i been visited, and terrible are the cases which have been brought
to the Caravans and deplorable the condition of the animals
in many localities. ‘ I

FOr miles there are vast areas where one passes nothing
but factory after factory, pit after pit, slum after slum, where
there is nothing to help the animals, lamed and crippled, as
they draw their loads, raw and somethimes blind with mange,
with limbs broken and shrivelled, or self—set in amazing con—
tortions, of teeth which will not permit their owner to masticate
or even swallow; of animals hideously injured and maimed.

We destroy the serious and incurable cases; and when
treating the others instruct the owner how to look after the
animal, for on Caravan Tours as in permanent Dispensaries,

7 WE TEACH AS WE WORK.

_ One Caravan Dispensary is now an “Old Age Pensioner,”
for it has travelled 170,084 miles around England, and 156,780
Cases have been brought to its doors.

In addition to its practical work, the P.D.S.A. has lectured

II will now give a few instances of :—

The type of suffering we treat:

the places we visit:

the many ways in which we have helped animals:

the various foreign bodies we have removed from them:
the ignorant treatment we have seen.

Only a few instances of animal suffering which have
:passed through our hands.

Please multiply these cases many HUNDREDS OF
THOUSANDS of times and it will give some idea of our

experience and the work which is being done by the P.D.S.A.
.1. WE HAVE TREATED :——

Gums and tongues of animals so putriﬁed that they were‘rotting
away.

Canker in ears that have left ﬂesh as red as a steak.
Animals simply alive with lice eating into the ﬂesh.
Wounds with maggots eating away to the bone.
Torn and bleeding mouths.

Nails in Horses’ and Donkeys’ hooves, penetrating sensitive
parts of the foot.

Neglected hooves, so bad‘ that the animal rolled rather than
walked:

Ill-ﬁtting shoes.

Crushed toes.

Septic teeth: diseased jawbones.
Sore backs: swollen tendons.
Lame-ness from many causes
Painful corns. l
Colic.

.Laminitis—that acute pain which causes Horses to rest on the
back part of the foot, so great IS the agony 1n bad cases.

Dog Whose shoulder had been stitched with two 3 inch horse
nails and some cobbler’s wax.

Cat who had been given a piece of sponge fried in fat to eat.
When. the Cat swallows this, the fat dissolves, the sponge
swells, causing gastric trouble and great thirst; the Cat
drinks, the sponge continues to swell, and. the Cat dies.
A method of destroying Cats, both in England and on.

IV.

WE HAVE WITNESSED the following ignorant
treatment :— ‘

Dog with tail dropping off due to piece of wire twisted‘ round
its tail to cure “worms.”

Pony whose owner had blistered a hind fetlock by throwing a
kettle of boiling water over it to «cure lameness.

Horse—leg almost raw to the bone, fomentations of hot water
and 1-lb. washing soda having been rubbed in, followed by
applications of turpentine and ammonia. '

Dog whose inﬂamed ears had been treated with Blue Vitriol.

Cat to whose scalds Lysol had been applied.

Dog with painful abscesses between toes. Owner said he
understood they had to be broken and had been advised
to stamp on the past!

Dog with several raw burns; had been badly injured by motor
car, and owner had fomented injuries by applying hot ﬂat
irons.

A Coster gave his Horse a dose for worms. To do so, he tied
its head back to a beam. He then gave 1 pint of linseed
and turpentine—what proportion of turpentine he did not
say. On returning a few hours later, he found the animal
in such agony that he sent for the P'.D.S.A. The medicine
had gone down the windpipe into the lungs, instead of down
the gullet into the stomach. It died in a few hours, and
the post mortem showed the lungs practically burnt up by‘
the turpentine.

building of a Hospital are now in hand.

In N. Africa—~One Hospital in Tangier and a Caravan
Dispensary. '

In Roumania—One Hospital in Bucharest and another in

The growth of the P.D.S.A. in foreign countries cannot
‘ be estimated by its work in these countries only, for it also
treats the animals of :—

Spaniards, Italians, Germans, Swiss, Arabs, Czecho—
Slovakians, Portugese, Balinese, Malays, Chinese.
Hungarians, Poles, Greeks, Russians, Turks,
Austrians and Albanians: and each owner carries
the teaching of the P.D.S.A. into his own land.

Truly it can be said that it is fast becoming a

GREAT INTERNATIONAL MOVEMENT.

I7

 

 

 

 




 

I will now brieﬂy describe the state of the animals

abroad as witnessed by the P.D.S.A.

WE

WE

HAVE SEEN :—

Donkeys and Mules in mills pulling a long pole round’ and
round to crush olives, who have been blinded with a hot .
needle so that they can work better.

An old dead Pony who had been killed by a pole—axe after
thiriteen blows. It took twenty minutes to kill it We were
to .

Donkeys who have had the nostrils cut to prevent them braying.

A Pony in a ﬁeld with a broken leg. Pieces of bone protruded
through the skin, the leg septic and the ﬂesh was so rotten
that it could be picked off by hand.

We have seen and heard the cry of a Horse Whose eye was
being cut out to “spite the owner.”

Dog beaten severely by the owner and turned adrift, but it
always returned. The owner then cut the animal open with
his knife and ﬁred ﬁve shots into its body.

Cats simply walking skeletons.

Dogs, enduring the agony of strychnine poisoning, whose tails
had been cut off when alive. This is done to take the
number of animals destroyed to the authorities. We have
put many of these poor creatures out of their misery.

Many Dogs with only three legs; the fourth leg having been
injured, had been simply cut off!

In the above cases the P.D.S.A. has given help where possible.

HAVE TREATED 2——

A Mule whose eye had been put out with a stick.

A Horse with twenty wounds.

A Donkey with ﬁve terrible burns made to make him “fat and
“strong.”

Donkeys and Horses who, having gone lame, had boiling water
poured over the limbs; also others whose owners have tried
to hide harness galls by plastering them with used motor
oil and sand, which set like tarmac over the sore.

A Horse tethered in the dried bed of a river suffering from colic
and a broken pelvis.

A Horse who had red hot rusty nails inserted through the skin
as a cure.

A Donkey carrying a weight equal to two heavy men, hardly
able to stand.

Many Horses. Mules and Donkeys who were standing on three
legs, the fourth leg either dislocated or broken.

Horses with gaping wounds. severed arteries and torn muscles,
the result of being attacked. by wolves.

Scalds, burns, wounds of every description, dislocated limbs,
canker. mange. damaged eyes, ears and hoofs, harness sores,
raw mouth, abscesses, colic and festering sores are daily
occurences.

18

 

 




 

 

 

WE HAVE DESTROYED :—

A Dog tied to a tree and left to die; one mass of raw ﬂesh":
through mange.

An old,_blind Cabhorse in a piteous condition, three large sores.»
on 1ts back, and knees broken through constant falling.

A Donkey whose bowel was trailing on the! ground, all water
passmg through a hole in the bowel. It was working in
this condition.

A Mule and a Goat which were being skinned alive, as the-
skin _is worth more money when taken from a live animal:
also it is eas1er to skin, as it is too weak to kick or struggle. '

A Horse who had had a nail in its foot: the owner had“
practically cut off the whole of the hoof and left it until the
foot had fallen off believing that a new one would grow:
and many thousands of similar cases.

Also hundreds of thousands of starving pariah Dogs.

WE HAVE TAKEN :—

Thousands of nails, knives, packing needles, thorns and sharp-»
pomted sticks and spikes from owners who were driving
their animals with these instruments of torture.

Leeches from the bleeding mouths of Mules and Donkeys who
have picked them up in the water they drink.

Sharp cruel bits from the mouths of animals.

WE HAVE HELPED :—

Horses and Donkeys to foal: Dog's to whelp: Goats to kid: Cows.
to calve. We have found these poor animals under most
distressing conditions; their moans are pitiful, and they
are often weak with straining or impossible delivery, and."
they are left to die alone after hours of agony. The only
attention these animals receive from their owners is when
they tear the young one from its mother before it is due,
so that the mother can get back to work sooner.

Not only at our Hospitals, Dispensaries and Caravan:
Dispensaries do we treat such suffering, but to reach it, the
P.D.S.A. abroad crosses deserts, fords rivers, climbs moun—
tains, inspects fondacks and the loading of animals on boats,
visits primitive farms, quaysides, native villages, huts, sheds,
cellars, and all kinds of out of the way places. _

It has been said, “You have your own work at home to
finance; look after the animals suffering at home before going
so far aﬁeld; Charity begins at home.”

Our answer is, “We have begun at home, for Charity
truly begins at home, but true Charity does not stay there.
Pain is pain wherever you are, nerves quiver and throb in:
the same way all the world over.

19

 




 

Can we then possibly refuse to go to the aid of such
animals? Can. we remain silent and not ask for money to
'help us to continue our hard work?

Living in the midst of such animal misery, can we, like
the Priest, pass by on the other side, or the Levite, simply
look at it and walk away? No, we dare not. Like the Sama-
ritan, we can do no other than take the oil and wine.

Abroad the P.D.S.A. is ﬁghting ignorance,

superstition, callousness, suspicion and

apathy. But in 90‘ per cent. of the cases the

battle has been won, and a better under—

standing of the nature and need of animals,

with a willingness to help them has been our
reward.

FINAL REMARKS.

Our Policy.

It has always been the policy of the P.D.S.A. to help
the owner of the animal as well as the animal; we always go
as a friend wanting to give a helping hand. Therefore, we
do not prosecute in cases of cruelty—we dare not do so. If
we prosecuted, we should never have gained the conﬁdence
of the people, we should never have reached theirheart, or
would they have come to us with their animals.

Ignorance is generally the cause of cruel treatment. “I
{did not think, I did not know”———how often we have heard such
remarks both at home and abroad.

Under a sketch of a guillotined head of a workman by a
French Artist the following words by Victor Hugo were
written 2——

This head of a man of the people
Instruct it, moralize it, enlighten it
And there will be no need to cut it off.

This is the policy-of the P.D.S.A.—to instruct the owners
upon the needs of their animals, to enlighten them upon their
responsibility to care for them.

It is also the policy of the P.D.S.A. to go out and ﬁnd the

sick and injured animal. \Ve do not wait until they are}

brought to our Hospitals, Dispensaries and Caravan Dis—
pensaries.

We believe it to be our duty to go and seek that which
is hidden away; to ﬁnd the suffering which no one sees.

I have already told of the conditions under which we
often work and also of the places we visit.

Our Reward.

The gratitude of the animal and of the owner is our
ample reward for long hours of toil and the demand upon our
sympathy and the strain. upon nerve which our work entails.
To feel the hearty shake of the hand or to see the tears well
up into the eyes of an owner——to witness the joy of a child
when a pet animal is returned sound and well; or to grasp
the offered paw of a dog after wounds have been attended to,
to hear the whinny of welcome from a stable, to witness the
many ways in which animals of all kinds, as well as their
owners, will try to make you understand their gratitude—
all these various expressions more than compensate our
labour.

Our Gratitude.

The rapid growth of our work from the early days of the
“Cellar Dispensary” to the present time has only been possible
through the great generosity of animal lovers in all classes
of society and how my Staff and I wish we could ﬁnd words
to thank those who have made it possible for‘us to do our
work! The Headquarters of all our work, the P.D.S.A. Sana—
torium in Ilford, was a gift; its stables, kennels and the
necessary equipment have nearly all been gifts.

Every Caravan has been a gift from someone to whom
the animals in out of the way places make a special appeal.
Each Ambulance, a gift from someone who could not bear
the thought of injured animals in the streets.

Each foreign country in which we are established is the
result of money given only for work in that particular country.

We can only try to express our gratitude not only to
donors of expensive gifts but to the many hundreds of poor
people who have sent their mite. The Flower Girl in the
street who for many weeks brought the money obtained from
the sale of her last bunch. of flowers each day; the little slum
boy, who had been given 1d. for sweets, who brought it to
the Dispensary “to help the Dogs”; the old man who for many
months came each Saturday evening to clean the windows
and wash the ﬂoors of a Dispensary “to save the funds”——
we would thank them all.

2]

 




 

And our many sympathisers and workers who have given
so much of thelr time to organise various -money raising
functlonse—how much we owe to them!

Especially we would express our gratitude to our regular
subscribers who not only send their annual. subscriptions but
many times during the last few years have responded to our
appeal for help when we have been in special ﬁnancial diffi—
culties.

For our work will always cost money; much money.
We have to ﬁnd nearly £60,000 a year for its support. We
are still a young Society and legacies are few, and as we do not
believe in hoarding money, but believe it is our duty to spend.
it for the purpose it is given, we often pass through times
of great ﬁnancial stress. During such times, we turn to our
supporters telling them our great need and they have never
failed us.

Our Future.

The P.D.S.A. is Non—Political, Non-Sectarian. It is a
common platform on which men and women of all national—
ities and creeds can meet to plead the cause of the animal
and to work for them—for the keynote of our work is Action.

\Ve are not content to talk about what we want to do.
or merely to express sympathy for animal suffering, we have
tried to do something.

By our remedial and educational work we are a part of
that mighty effort which through countless agencies is ever
seeking to voice the cause of the oppressed, and to support
the weak and down—trodden, without which civilization would
sOOn return to barbarism. ‘

\Ve, therefore, claim a place in that vast army of re—
formers and pioneers who, l’)elieving that all life is one, can
never rest until every member of the whole family of life
receives just and proper treatment. Althoughthe animals
are only lesSer brethren, still they are brethren and, as such,
demand our care and protection.

We stand for any animal that is suﬁr‘ering—i—n—especially
the animal that is down and out-wthe old Horse or Donkey
who has long since earned his rest, but who is being worked
until the very last ounce of strength is squeezed out of him:
the stray Mongrel whom nobody wants, but who wants some—
body very badly indeed to whom he can conﬁde his misery:
the mange—eaten Cat whom no one wants to touch, but whose
gratitude is expressed in the blinking eyes nearly blinded with

disease—these are typical of the misery we are out to alleviate.

The injustice of their sufferings, the pathos of their
dumbness, their utter dependence upon us for all that makes
their life bearable, and the callousness, the lack of under—
standing, to say nothing of the actual cruelty which they
receive from man, are problems not to "be solved in this world.
It may be said: “Oh, but animals were never better treated
than they are to—day: much kindness and." good treatment is
shown to them at the present time.” My reply is: “I speak
not of these animals, but of the hundreds of thousands both
at home and abroad, who for the most part live and certainly
suffer and die in misery. _

The speechless animal with quivering nerve, with broken
bones, the animal who suffers as we do: for these can we
work, for. these we would hoist Our Flag—that symbol
of protection and responsibility—~—throughout the world.

The P.D.S.A. only awaits the support of the generous
animal lover upon whom it is entirely dependent.

A FEW SAMPLE» QUESTIONS.

“Please Sir, has one of Spot’s ribs come through the skin,
as I tore my hand open on something sharp sticking out of
him when I stroked him last night?” With the ,aid of a local
anaesthetic, a Zia—inch darning needle was. removed from the Dog
between the ribs, just over the heart. It must have been in the
body for some considerable time, judging from the state of the
needle.

“Why does my Dog scream every time its mouth is
touched?” \Ve found jaw broken and rotten to such an extent
that it would have been possible to remove all teeth by the
hand.

“Can you tell me why my Horse keeps scratching its
stomach?” A. visit to the Horse revealed that the poor animal
was in severe pain from a twisted bowel.

“Why won’t. my Dog eat, Mister?” The Dog had been
forced by the ignorant owner to swallow huge lumps of gristle.
One lump had lodged at the back of the throat and had to be
removed under anaesthetic.

“Oh! please ganor mother wants him ‘done in,’ but can
you cure him?” asked a small boy, accompanied by his smaller
brother, “Do curei him, we love him so.” A small Pup was
handed to us suffering from a slight skin disease. We were
able to tell the two small boys who had brought it that the
Puppy would get well.

“Why does my Cat keep laughing?” asked a small boy.
A small bone lodged between two teeth was scratching the
Cat’s cheek each time it tried to shut its mouth.

“I want to know why my Dog is so vicious and snaps if
I touch him, please” inquired an owner. The Dog’s eye was
terribly inﬂammed: the lid puffy and distended: the cause was
an oat grain in the eye lid.

“Why doesn’t my little Dog get well?” asked an owner.
The Dog was suffering from a painful skin disease and almost
raw in patches—the eyes and mouth being very swollen.
The owner had peppered the Dog, including the eyes and
mouth, ‘to cure it.’

“Can you tell me what’s the matter with my Horse?”
said a Gipsy. “l’ve pushed pepper pods into him as he won’t
pass water, but he gets no better.” The Horse was suffering
from bladder trouble and the intense agony of the burning
pods. .
